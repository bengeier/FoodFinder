{"text":"The food was very delicious. We had the garlic mussels and Cajun shrimp. Food is served in bags. No cutlery unless you ask for it. It's very messy but well worth it. The corn was a highlight if you like sweet corn. The service was not great, that was the only downfall. Otherwise, I'd love to try all their seafood!!!!"}
{"text":"This location got yellow on the food safety pass I would not come back here ever again  I ordered a pound of shrimp,mussels,clams it took 15 mins for our food,I checked out the Ontario food safety of this place if they got yellow it must be DISGUSTING especially under the new management"}
{"text":"The portions at all the captains boil are ALOT smaller now went here recently and ordered 1 pd of mussel shrimp & clams came out to be about 10-13 shrimps,9 mussels ridiculous for the price I have no idea wth is going on it could be the new management that's running this place or with corporate but like a lot of people Have been saying the cap boil is just failing even their sauce has changed its now thinner the cap boil sauce  Because all i see is OIL  I remember when I first had this 2-3 years ago when the sauce was thicker and now it's just all oil DONT EVEN BOTHER GOING TO CAP BOIL if you really wanna pay over priced seafood in a plastic bag of OIL disgusting"}
{"text":"My husband and our extended family (11 of us in total) visited this location and the food was great - nicely seasoned, fresh and served warm.  I preferred the Captain's Boil non-spicy (I don't do spicy at all) and it was a perfect blend of flavour and spice. We also tried the mild and medium and they were enjoyable for the spicy eaters as well. The Cajun medium was spicy enough for our party, but the Garlic Butter was very disappointing - bland and borderline boring (the garlic was barely there).  We did the clams, mussels (huge), shrimps, fish & chips, chicken tenders, Cajun seafood fried rice, sides of corn and potatoes and 3 sizzling plate combos (1 with rice and 2 with udon; fish and chicken). Note that for the sizzling plate combos, you only get the additional seafood before 4pm.  Everything was excellent. Definitely get the rice (so good) and it'd be perfect to go with a pound of shrimp and a pound of mussels (or whatever) between 2 people - just enough. FYI re: the sides - when you order corn, it's just one piece of it (not a whole corn on the cob - probably just a third), but the potato servings are big. Contrary to the corn, if you order a potato, you get a whole potato and they cut it in half, so order a potato side with caution. Wish they served more of the corn than potato. And better to have the corn/potato mixed in the bag with the seafood and seasoning rather than on its own.  The sizzling plate combos were awesome (definitely worth getting, but go before 4pm because the extra seafood isn't available for dinner). The chicken teriyaki was perfect - nicely seasoned with big, chunky pieces of chicken. The serving size of the combos are huge, so you can go with an empty stomach, share or have some for take home. The udon noodles were nice and again, provided in generous portions.  The only downside was the consistency - we had also been to the location at Sherway Gardens and it was different.  At the Newmarket location, there were no buckets on the tables to dump the garbage/seafood shells. The server said she would come by every so often to clean up the mess for us. This never happened and made the meal particularly messy (it's already messy eating there as it is). It was actually an ongoing complaint for our entire party. The food was good, but the constant mess and piles of seafood shells overshadowed some of the positives. Also, because we ordered so much shellfish, it would have been nice to have been provided with extra gloves without having to constantly ask. So the food was good, but the service could be improved.  In relation to the Sherway Gardens location, there were buckets on the tables (thank goodness) and the service was great. The only downside here was that the food was incredibly salty to the point where I wasn't enthused about visiting another location. I also had the non-spicy Captain's Boil shrimp here and my husband had the medium Cajun mussels and all we pretty much tasted was salt. So the food wasn't as enjoyable, but the dining experience was better (and much less messy). The only reason why we decided to try the Newmarket location was because of a family event and we're all big fans of Hot & Juicy in the U.S. (same thing, but American). What I liked about Hot & Juicy was not just the seasoning (not at all salty), but that they also serve softshell crab (yummm) and the service - they constantly checked on us, brought extra gloves without asking and they even tie your bibs for you! Okay, that last point is a bit much, but the service was exceptional.  I'd try Captain's Boil again, but maybe another location to see if the seasoning might be different. I'm not sure why one location's seasoning would be different from another, but I hope that anywhere we go, it will be less salty. Ideally, I would take the food from the Newmarket location and serve it in the Sherway Gardens location and that would be perfect."}
{"text":"Quite unique food and flavor, but the seafood is not anything superior, especially for the price. Shrimp and mussels were ok, but the crawfish was terrible, small and not fresh. Fries was pretty good. Also, the oil penetrated(?) the gloves and got my hands pretty dirty."}
{"text":"Let me just say that I have been to other boils in the GTA before and one thing that disappointed me was that Captain's Boil doesn't state that they use PEANUT OIL for their deep-fried foods. Considering how prevalent and fatal peanut allergies are, they should state it clearly on their menu that they use peanut oil. Thankfully I asked the server who initially was unaware, and later confirmed that they do use it. IF YOU HAVE A PEANUT ALLERGY, AVOID!!! There are several other boil spots in the GTA that do not use peanut oil."}
{"text":"Food: 4/5 Atmosphere: 4.5/5 Service: 5/5  Food: MUST GET THE CORN IN WITH THE SAUCE! The corn soaks up the sauce so well! Captain's Boil sauce is a mix of the other three sauces. It comes in no spicy, mild, medium and hot. I love spicy, and their hot wasn't a dying hot, but you definitely can feel your lips burning after. I had the mild before the spicy, and it wasn't flavourful enough for me.   Lobster captain's boil sauce in mild: hard to share this if you have a lot of people Shrimps: Must order Mussles: takes in the sauce really well Clams: small pieces, might not be worth the price since they charge you per pound Cajun fries: Simple and delicious Seafood rice: Can't actually see any pieces of seafood in the rice, I'm not sure if it was just seafood flavouring infused into the rice or not. It was still good, but don't expect chunks or even pieces of seafood.  Atmosphere:  Fun and laid back environment. Awesome to go with a group of friends. Very messy thing to eat. Food served in plastic clear bags, shells left on the table. They provide you with gloves and a bib. I just wouldn't recommend this for a first date.  Service: Great! They don't really check in on you, but there's always someone running around, so you can easily wave them down. I've been to the North York and Downtown location. Both places are great. They don't automatically refill your water, you have to ask frequently. At least, we did because there's just so much MSG in the sauce, so we downed our glasses of water pretty quickly. Easy to order more. Food comes really fast, which I guess isn't hard since they don't have to plate it. I feel like they are really good with large groups at both places.  Final thoughts: I would go again, and I have been many times. Drink lots of water after. They only seat you if your whole group is there. Although, one time we had a group of 9, but they still seated us with 8 people at the North York location. But I guess that didn't matter since we didn't take up an extra table."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Captain's Boil for a while and now that a new location has opened closer to home I had no more excuses. We tried the shrimp and mussels in the captains boil sauce which was really good. LOTS of garlic and butter in the sauce. The seafood was large and worth the money. I especially liked the mussels because they were bigger than you typically get at other restaurants. At lunch, the sizzling platters are great to get a variety of stuff. I also recommend getting corn on the cob and eating it with the sauce or just plain.  I would definitely say that you get your money's worth here."}
{"text":"I was pretty excited that this was opening in Toronto. We were a party of 5, and waited around 30 minutes for a table on a Thursday night. The service was okay, though this one waitress spoke very softly and I couldn't understand much. The food was great, the Captain's seasoning voted the best. We had shrimp, mussel, clams, crab, some corn. The cajun fries were good and the fried rice was great. The one-size-fits-all gloves were too loose for my tiny hands, so it was mildly inconvenient. Then we saw guests on the other table who brought their own gloves, so that's noted for our next visit!"}
{"text":"Within two weeks of my last visit, I've already been back. This time with 12 people. We went at 4, so we beat the rush and had really awesome service. The server informed everyone of how things worked, and she was really attentive with bringing drinks and re-filling water, cleaning up and letting us finish drinks after paying. Probably due to the time, but we didn't feel rushed. We were there for a total of 2 and a half hours, but people were continually ordering food and drinks.  Updates from last time... changing table is now in the ladies washroom, but I don't think there is one in the men's.. which I believe there should be.  They went from two types of wine (1 red, 1 white) to 2 of each colour.   But most importantly..... the food remained as awesome as last time!"}
{"text":"I would have given this 0 stars if I could have...Food was alright but the experience was completely ruined by our server. We asked for the corn on the side so we can eat it blandly without so much sauce but it came served in the same bag as the saucy seafood. We told the server that we wanted the corn on the side, like when we first ordered but she said she could not do anything unless we wanted to order another order. We told her that she got the wrong order and she told us she could bring some water to wash off the sauce........ It was such a ridiculous response that we had to ask someone else, who eventually gave us another corn, but took the saucy corn back (probably to serve to someone else or they might have washed it down like she said and brought it back). Let's keep in mind that we are talking about corn, not crab or shrimp...but corn... Should not have been that difficult."}
{"text":"The crawfish I had on Monday was very small and not fresh. All its taste was the salty sauce not the sweetness of crawfish. 18.99$/bls was not worth it. I'm  probably not coming back that place."}
{"text":"The experience of eating out of a plastic bag with plastic gloves is just too weird and unappetizing. Its also messy.  Ordered the clams.  Ok portion for the money but the Captain's Boils sauce was way too garlicky.    Would go again and try other offerings if they served food on proper dishware."}
{"text":"Having heard about the place and getting pestered by many of my friends, I have finally decided to give the Captain's Boil a try. At 5:00 pm the tables were already full so definitely recommend making a reservation if you are going with a group.   Got crayfish, shrimp, and clams.  Pros:   Service was friendly and fast.  The spicy cajun flavour goes with everything!   Found a piece of clam meat in every shell, so no scam there.  Like what so many other yelpers have said, get the seafood fried rice!   Cons:  The name; not really befitting for an eatery.    Although I'm not necessarily an environmentalist, the amount of plastic a single person can use during his/her meal is mind-boggling.   The bill from the food does add-up so do order in a group-sharing mentality.   Recommendations:   Its not about the meat in the crayfish, its the flavour. The real gold is that bag of left-over sauce, so don't waste it!  Definitely recommend a pound of chicken (goes well with the sauce from the seafood) if you are extremely hungry and don't want to break your wallet."}
{"text":"Great place to get your Cajun seafood fix. Doesn't necessarily live up to the same standard as the Cajun food you can get in the states, but like I said... It helps hold off the craving until I can get myself to New Orleans. Fries are actually really good there so I get that every time. Whatever seafood you choose, the Captains Boil seasoning is a must and an obvious. My only beef with this place is that every time I've gone, they've been out of crawfish."}
{"text":"The service was attentive and quick but the chicken was too bland. My first thought was \"did they leave the taste in the kitchen?\" Where is the subtlety in this food? Unfortunately I needed all the Teriyaki and hot sauces to finish my meal. Might give it another try with something else on the menu to form a better opinion.  On my second visit, I tried a Cajun chicken with lotus roots. This time, the taste is definitely there. It gets a fair rate because of the very spicy sauce, but presentation gets 0 (zero). There is ''casual'' but this is a messy spectacle. All the food is mixed up and served to you in a large transparent plastic bag. I was distressed to see this content being plonked down onto my table. (I am a trooper but this is definitely not for everyone). Low marks for serving cheap paper plates with USELESS tiny plastic forks that don't do the job. Final thoughts: If I ever give it a 3rd and last try, it will be to eat the seafood with my hands. Other than that, I will avoid unless I am desperate."}
{"text":"If you're into fresh seafood this place is definitely not for you.  Almost everything comes from a box.  Tried the boiled shrimp and crab legs both w/Captains Sauce.  Found it lacked flavor.  The fried shrimp platter was definitely a Costco special and the chicken wings weren't good either.  Wasn't horrible but definitely not good enough for a repeat visit.  Very disappointed to say the least."}
{"text":"Went around 7pm on a Wednesday for a table of 4 and the wait was about 30 mins which isn't bad compared to what I've heard from other people.   They took our number down and they notified us as soon as our table was ready which is neat since we don't have to wait outside in the cold (long lineup of people waiting already)   Expect a messy meal, the gloves provided tend to fall off easily. We ordered shrimp, mussels, lobster and crab legs as well as corn.. Was thinking maybe full or half the corn but instead it was about 1/4 of a corn. Food was good, service was ok...We got seated in the basement floor beside the washroom. Expect to pay around 30-40 per person. Something I'd try once just to experience it."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this dinner! Had the shrimps and mussels with a side of corn; these were all reasonably priced.  The cajun seasoning was pretty delish - just the right amount of heat. I don't see any reason to complain about the plastic bags, as they are quite transparent about this aspect of the restaurant. Plus, foregoing the plates and having the entire surface of the table to eat out of is actually pretty convenient.  Sidenote: they had a couple of TVs on but preferred showing premier league soccer over the NFL playoffs. Great seafood though!!"}
{"text":"Recommended this place to all seafood lovers. I tried all and here are my thoughts: -Shrimps, lobsters, clams: must try (if you only want to order 1 dish, try shrimps then). Crawfish is ok (i dont like much because it takes a lot of effort to remove shelf and not so much meat) -Sauces: def. get the captain boil sauce. Then lemon pepper (a bit salty), and cajun. No need to try garlic sauce (no taste but smell) -Corn: must must must.. Kinda expensive but worth it ****if you come as a group, order 2 lbs or more, ask them to put each lb in separate bag (otherwise there is not enough sauce for a bag of 2 lbs)"}
{"text":"Place was clean and food was great. Husband and I ordered 2lbs of crab legs and 1lb of mussles. The service however was not great. Server was nonexistent. Had to go looking for her twice because we had been waiting a long time to order more beverages and to get more ketchup for our fries. Other than the service it was a good experience."}
{"text":"Sad thing is you can't do half pound or something, it needs to be full. Might be pricey but dang! It is sooo good and really worth of the price they're asking!!   If you know you're a messy eater, this might be your olace or might not be your place lol."}
{"text":"Group of 5 people, no reservation. We went on a Monday night and ended up waiting about 45mins. Nothing crazy. Might want to make reservations if you don't like waiting.  Service was great and everyone was very attentive. The food was good as well. We had one order of shrimp with garlic sauce, one pound of shrimp with lemon pepper sauce and a pound of clams with garlic sauce. Everything tasted great. Though I do wish they would have let me mix garlic sauce with lemon pepper (you can only choose one of the sauce options, it's not mix and match).   I will say this, Captain's Boil doesn't seem to know what lemons are. Or maybe they ran out? They substituted all of their lemons with limes (even the ones that came with our raw oysters)  The waiter mentioned the cajun fries were super spicy but we found it didn't have much taste ... they were just like regular fries. We also got the sweet potato fries. They were good, nothing special.  The one thing I didn't enjoy was the raw oysters. While they were nice and cold, they didn't taste fresh and didn't sit well with me.   I will say one thing, while this place is overall pretty good ... if you're expecting it to be like Boiling Crab out in California, you will probably be a little disappointed."}
{"text":"1)Indoor environment: 4 out of 5 2)Service: 4 out of 5 3)Price: $$ 4)Taste: 3.5 out of 5. -Captain's boil sauce smells creamy which I didn't expect. -Personally think how Chinese season -seafood tasting better. -Mild was not spicy at all. -Lobster was fresh and big. -Seasoning for crawfish was outside and inside has no taste.  -Shrimp tasted the best of the meal."}
{"text":"An interesting concept with good food. It has been busy every time I eat in or come in for a take out, and that is a good sign for their future success.  Basically, the food is quickly blanched and then put into plastic bags with the sauces that you have ordered. This is a no cutlery, no plates restaurant but all foods come in plastic bags with the sauces, and you are equipped with plastic bibs and many pairs of plastic gloves. A great place to come if you a comfortable with those you are eating with and maybe not so if your are meeting the in-laws for the first time. A tree hugger's nightmare.  There are many types of seafood, shrimps, mussels, clams, crawfish, lobster or crab legs. You pick your sauce and the heat level (although I seem to find everything quite overwhelming with garlic, no vampire issues here)  You can also pick sides like white rice, okra (never really a fan but it is very good here) corn, potatoes etc. They have some new veggie options like broccoli, mushrooms, enoki mushrooms and carrots. Unfortunately, the enoki mushrooms don't cut it, they are just too delicate to be blanched and served this way (think blanched lettuce).   Keep in mind that your bevvies are served in  plastic cups with a straw and become quite sloppy/slippery when you have to touch them with your grubby juicy saucy fingers.   I enjoy the food but complain to my wife that i am breathing / burping  up garlic breath for days after. (once again, no vampire issues at my house)  Comments/Complaints/Suggestions  Food - good, garlicy and spicy Service - very attentive Wash Up - they actually have a sink in the middle of the restaurant area that you an clean your messy hands in, a great idea"}
{"text":"Nice setup inside, new construction so everything is newly finished.    I had never been to one of these \"boil\" restaurants before but I had seen some pics so I knew what to expect with regards to the food being served in the bags but I didn't realize there was no plates, just paper on the table.  Everything seems to be plastic.  Order a beer, you will get the bottle and a plastic glass.  Ask for water, you will get plastic glasses.  The amount of plastic/garbage is kind of disgusting after you look at the table when you are done.  Food: We ordered the shrimp and the lobster among two people.  The taste was okay/good but you have to clean the shrimp yourself (deshell) and you have to remove all of the lobster meat yourself.  You are paying around $38 for a lobster and while I know lobster is expensive normally you could probably get 2 lobsters for that price in China town.  Overall it was an experience.  If you go in thinking of it as an experience then you might enjoy it more than thinking it is going to be an amazing dinner experience.  There are so many of these different \"boils\" opening up, I am curious to see if the market will support them.  Some are already closing down."}
{"text":"Food served in plastic bags and dropped on to the table.  We had clams, mussels and shrimp. Too much sauce in the bag. At least 1/2 cup of sauce left in each bag after we ate the food. Messy You wear plastic bibs and gloves Had to reach into bag to grab food. Watch your sleeves.  Food was just ok Aiming to be Louisiana style boil but it's not.  $25/person for the cheapest items on the list.  Poor servers Definitely a disappointing food experience."}
{"text":"I love it. Me and my husband was talking about to give it a try,luckily we didn't wait for too long that day ,and we love the food and service is nice too, we can't wait to get back again soon"}
{"text":"Awesome place, service, environment and food were all great! Love the gloves and bibs, probably needed double gloves since the glove can break. Captain's boil sauce was the best! I had the clams, mussels and lobster! They prep and cut the lobster for you so all you have to do is to fork it out from the shell, easy to eat!"}
{"text":"The captains boil is one of my favourite restaurants. The sauce is amazing and superior to similar restaurants that i have tried in the states ie) hot n juicy crawfish, boiling crab. This restaurant is a must go! My favourite is their captains boil sauce with shrimp and corn and obviously the Cajun fries. Drooling just thinking about it"}
{"text":"I called to make sure that the crayfish was live. The person that answered the phone said yes they always get live. But I'm from California and this does not taste anything like live crayfish. I wish people would not lie about live or not live. There is a big difference... sorry you get 1 star"}
{"text":"First time going to captain boil for my birthday, had a part of 20 people where they saved us a table upstairs. Even though it was a Wednesday night the place was very busy!! The food was pretty good, server was really nice. There wasn't crawfish, but everything else was pretty good!"}
{"text":"Well worth the wait! We ordered the Captain sauce and the spices brought out the flavor in the snow crab, king crab and shrimp. The corn was also tasty with not too much butter. The prices are reasonable and good size portions....can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Perfect food place clean environment newly just grand open  Love their corns man!!also the clams are so recommended!!!!friendly staff also serve with pleasant! I will definitely come back again"}
{"text":"The place was amazing!!! Walked in and the decor was gorgeous, super clean and very friendly staff. I love seafood and this place definitely satisfied my craving. With various seasonings and seafood to choose from, your cravings can met at this place. I recommend trying the seafood fried rice, has I really nice spice to it. I will definitely return for more and recommend it to all."}
{"text":"Carcinogen. What happen to having some Plates?  Plastic everything and disposable cups/utensils. I'm not the most environment person. But this is definitely The most environmental not friendly restaurant I have ever seen. I don't think I'm going back."}
{"text":"Great seafood place. All the food was fresh and the Cajun fries are amazing! Dungeness crab took a while but worth it!"}
{"text":"Honestly this was one of the best seafood experiences Ive ever had in Canada! Its an american style restaurant that Ive been waiting to to find in Toronto! I ordered 2 lbs of crab and and shrimp with the corn and chose the captains boil sauce wow all i have to say is I took the rest home because I did not want to waste anything! You will not be dissapointed if you like seafood also crawfish coming in January! Ill be back next week!!"}
{"text":"Too messy for no reward... I can't think of a situation where I would go back. Maybe a third date?"}
{"text":"Great mix of spice! Menu provides options for different individuals. If you want a spicy challenge, try the fire fire!"}
{"text":"Was excited to see that a Captain's boil was opening near by so when they finally opened their doors we went in for a low key birthday dinner to see what they were all about. We got there about 6:30 pm, party of 5. The place was smaller than what you would expected for a restaurant of this kind. As we entered, we were greeted and had a short 15 minute wait despite a few empty 2 seaters and a booth for four available since reservations are only available for parties of 6 or more. On first glance of the menu, everything seemed pricey for portions sized in lbs with each additional topping of corn, sausages potatoes etc being extra as opposed to what was seen in the pictures. Corn was advertised at $1 per piece, potatoes $1.50 per piece and sausages at a whooping $6.99. The waiter was very helpful, thoroughly explained how we should order, made recommendations and even brought and extra female sailors bib for me since mine was a pirates bib.   We ordered 3 shrimp, 1 king crab and 1 mussels in mild captains boil sauce along with regular french fries and sweet potato fries for the table. We were all given little gloves, and our food came piping hot in bags drenched with their signature sauce. I was genuinely surprised at how much food was in the bag: my corn on the cob was half a cob as opposed to the quarter shown in pictures, I had an entire potato cut in quarters as opposed to two pieces and a generous serving of sausages. I had some mussels from a friend and it was delicious considering they would not be something i'd order. I loved that there was an automatic handwash station readily available because at some point some of the sauce had sneakily got on our hands somewhere even with gloves! Each table had a roll of paper towels  which was great but best of all I think my experience exceeded my expectations.   It isn't like any other restaurant you'd visit downtown. The vibe is really fun and feels like it jumped out of a kid's book, their look and feel of the restaurant and all its components, menu, design and rope lighting etc. together with the experience of how the food is served is pretty great and well executed. We had a lot of fun, there's something about putting on a bib and getting down and dirty in a bag of saucy seafood that makes dining here great. Shells we discarded right on top of the table and that's fine because it's all part of the experience. Felt great to eat somewhere new and in the end our bill for 5, where we each had a bag of seafood, 4 pops, some extra toppings and two sides came up to only $136. I pay more for some restaurants downtown for a two person date and granted they are upscale and food cant be compared at the same caliber, Id rate the experience at Captains boil as a good as any of those experiences. Something different and fun and worth while to enjoy with friends."}
{"text":"Not worth the hype imho. The food was mediocre at best... The sauce was nowhere near as flavourful as a boil should be, they do not devein the shrimp ($12.95/lb) which is stupid beyond belief. It's not hard to cut open the back of the shrimp, shell on, and devein it. It also allows the sauce to penetrate better and it's easier for patrons to peel. SO Y DONT U DO THIS? How lazy can you be? The sausages ($6.95) were very salty--I recommend this joint to look into sourcing different sausages. Corn was expensive $1/half cob. We also got the seafood fried rice ($10.95) which was rice, shrimp, scallops, corn cooked in the sauce and topped with a pinch of green onions. Ok, for something that greasy I would have appreciated something to balance all the oil out like more green onions, peas or cilantro. Just to freshen it up a bit. Other than that, it wasn't special.   The setup was alright, bibs (standard), gloves and disposable paper tablecloths and a big sink out in the open with sensors so you can be as messy as you want. They open late too but I don't think it would be a good place to go post drinks or post club, wayyyy too much work.   Crawfish were \"not in season\" lame. Crawfish is what boils are all about. What an outrage.   I don't recommend. I suspect that restaurant management took a trip to LA and tried out real boil and thought they could do it here. Not like this."}
{"text":"It got me excited when I heard about this place. While I'm waiting by the entrance to get my table cleaned up, I was a little turned off by the how messy everyone's table looks like, and the crustacean is in the plastic bags lol. Okaaay... So we ordered shrimps, clams, cajun rice, king crab, and just for shits and giggles, fries. Fries are nice and crunchy. Pick your own sauce for the sea food you order and voila! It's delicious! I say go visit this place for the tasty food and experience."}
{"text":"I'm one of those people that uses Yelp pretty frequently, but never actually posts reviews. Until now!  I went to this location a few days ago.  I had done some research before going, so I kind of knew what to expect. Good thing I did, or else I would have been pretty disgusted. Food in a bag, eating with your hands and food on the table isn't usually what I like to see at a restaurant. But I wanted to try something new. I figured out the menu after asking a few questions and ended up ordering the shrimp with 1 half piece of corn. The corn was delicious. The shrimp was not!  I ended up with food poisoning!!  I didn't eat a number of them (good thing I didn't) because they were kind of mushy and pasty.  They didn't quite taste right, but I thought that was because they came as whole shrimp with heads and feet and everything and I'd never had them that way. Nope. They were just bad. After spending the next day home from work, I looked them up again and found Google reviews that were similar to mine. And like some of those other reviews, I found the service to be pretty bad, as well. Next time I'll be checking Google and Yelp before I decide to eat adventurously."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday Evening with my friends. Surprisingly, though the restaurant was packed, the service was still great. The staff was very attentive to all our needs!  Food was top-notch! Moreover, as bonus, there was a Grand Opening 10% off deal!  The interior of the restaurant was very open. The tables were well spaced, not like the ones at the location on Yonge."}
{"text":"We went to Captain's Boil yesterday, and couldn't help racking up a huge bill! We ordered lobster, clams, snow crab, king crab, dungeness crab (all with the Captain Boil sauce) and cajun fries. Everything ordered was superb. Every member of the staff was extremely helpful. Like another review I saw, it's recommended that you come before 6:00 PM to nab a seat."}
{"text":"Foods taste vert nasty, prices so high and Server are soooooooo soooo horrible  Never coming back here again"}
{"text":"Wow, what a great experience! Love the food, love the staff and love the concept. When you first arrive the bib on the table says it all. Expect to get messy. The food is super tasty yet served in plastic bags. Yup!  Like John Catucci says. You gotta eat here!"}
{"text":"Outstanding. Amazing seafood. Great aura. Love the creativity of dining in. Love the spices. I'd come back over and over again!"}
{"text":"My first time trying this franchise. My friend and I couldn't come before 3 PM so we couldn't get any of the combo deal ones. I ended up getting one pound shrimp with Captain's Boil seasoning and corn (medium spicy). I think my friend got some kind of seafood fried rice (also mild or medium level of spiciness).  I was about to be impressed by the cute plastic bibs they give you and disposablr plastic gloves when the server just dumped a tied plastic bag onto our table. To our surprise, it was my one pound of shrimp with half a corn also covered in the sauce. I was expecting them to at least put the shrimps on a plate. We were at a lost as to what to do, then decided to dump the contents onto the table and eat them. It's certainly an unusual way to serve and eat (the table was covered with disposable, sort of waxy thick paper) and made me question how sanitary this place might me.  The fried rice was a bit bland but the over-abundance of the sauce from the shrimps was enough to make up for it. The sauce was more spicy than I thought but the garlic flavour was too strong. Other than that, the shrimps were pretty good and fairly easy to peel. The service was okay."}
{"text":"The food was great but the services gave me a reason to give them a 2-star. This is my second time on Captain's Boil, but first time on this location. I wouldn't have any negative reviews or complaints I guess, if I haven't tried their branch first along Yonge, (which I would give 5 stars for both services and food).   Here, one of the servers kept going to our table to give us food that we didn't order. It was like 4-5 times. I also made reservations since I know it's a Friday night, and it's gonna be busy. But we still had to wait for 15-20 minutes because according to them, there was just some confusion about our reservation, though I did confirm. I'm not sure if it was because I did my reservation on Yelp. Anyway, still, the food was great."}
{"text":"Every since this location opened, I have been going here so much.  I think last week I ate there 3 days in a row.  I really like the lunch special with the fried fish, rice, and a couple of shrimps, mussels, clams, and crawfish.  The caption boil sauce is addictive.  I also really like the shrimps with the captain boil sauce. I like to ask for more garlic in the captain boil sauce.  My wife really likes the shrimps and now her new favorite are the clams.  Overall, I think this location is the best out of the other ones (yonge and markham) I have been to when it comes to food, decor and service."}
{"text":"made reservations for a large table but we had to wait an additional 45 minutes on top of that for them to get the table ready...  but onto the food...it was pretty delicious, we tried the mussels, clams, and crab. kinda sad they didn't have crawfish when we got there but i guess we'll have to try it another day.   flavours were great, corn on the cob is a must! make sure to wear dark coloured clothing! i had a few friends who regretted wearing beige pants haha! also...you'll REEK of garlic after you leave so don't wear anything too nice!"}
{"text":"First time at this location but would 100% go back again. The service was phenomenal and the food was so good. We had the king crab and the seafood fried rice. Captains boil sauce and garlic sauce. The seasonal stuff is a bit pricey but definitely worth every penny."}
{"text":"First, I would have to say that I absolutely love the whole concept of this place. I have only heard of a place like this in the states, but have not had the opportunity to try it. I was very excited to hear a similar place would be opening in Toronto.  This is a great place for groups because of the experience. Each table comes with a much needed roll of paper towl, gloves and a bib. It does get very messy! (Definately not a place for a first date)  If you dont know how this works, first you chose your seafood, then sauce.. lastly your spice level. We ordered King crab, shrimp, mussels, seafood fried rice and corn on the cob... All in the broilers sauce (a mixture of all 3 sauces ) with medium spice (which was pretty hot). The king crab was very meaty and worth it's price. The fried rice comes in a very large portion (enough for 3 people) and it is made with scallops, shrimp, green onion and corn... very tasty. The shrimp was our favourite, but they do not unvein it.. which was annoying to do with the gloves on. I do not recommend the mussels ..they were the gigantic  ones that taste cheap. Portion of shrimp and mussels were very generous. The corn was $1 for 1/3 of a cob.. serious rip off. The amount of food we ordered could easily fill 3 people.. and our bill came up to 88$. Id give the food overall 4/5.  Now I have to mention how horrible the service was. We seated ourselves, had to flag down staff for a menu, and flag her down again to order. When we received our food.. we waited 5 mins for her to walk by... to ask for a tool to eat our crabs.. to then realize we didn't receive our gloves.. and waited another 5 mins to get her attention again. Everytime we looked back we could see staff standing around talking... it was DEAD.. only 8 customers in total. So no excuse for the poor service. I rate the service 1/5  It was a fun place to eat.. with good food. I would come back here when the crawfish is in season. It has only been open for 2 months, hopefully the service will improve by then."}
{"text":"I've tried a few locations now (both Yonge St. locations and this one), and this is definitely my favourite. They are far less busy for an early dinner, and they accept reservations. My main gripe with the Yonge/College location is that the quality is very hit or miss. Sometimes you'll get a lot of sauce, whereas sometimes it'll just be pure oil. The seafood isn't always fresh. However, at the College St. location, it's always been great quality. The service is great, very friendly and attentive staff. Despite living closer to the Yonge/College location, I'd definitely travel to the College St. location as they haven't let me down!"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant twice already. And obviously, i did lurve my first visit. We tried their shrimp (captain's boil sauce & mild), crab legs (garlic & mild), mussel (captain's boil & mild), wings & fries and steamed rice. Superb! All seafoods were served hot (but they're in a plastic), the rice were in a styrofoam cup. We have 'gloves' but they're thin and since there are spikes in the foods, they got punctured right away. And you'll eat with your gloved hands on a brown paper covered table. It is a nice experience with great foods. The staffs are friendly. But if you'll go there in big groups, make sure you have the patience to wait since there are a lot of people eating there, it might take you time before you will be seated."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on a weekday. We got a table right away. We ordered the fish teriyaki (came with 2 mussells, clam, crawfish and shrimp) and 1 lb shrimp. Fast and good service. Food was more than enough for the 2 of us. Sauce was good (captains boil) but shrimp lacked flavor. Wouldnt mind coming back again. Theyre 1 star away from LA's Boiling Crab level."}
{"text":"Zero star, if possible.   Got there on father's day at around 1:30pm. It took 10-15 min for the waitress to come and greet us. She said that they were out of the fried shrimp basket, Dungeness crab, and the sizzling plate. We asked for a minute, as two of the three things we were planning to order were sold out of according to the server. We called over another server to get clarification because I couldn't understand how everything in the sizzling plate was sold out and yet we can still order it all individually... It turns out that they are not offering the deal today, and yet there is no sign or any restrictions on the menu.   We were looking forward to a nice family lunch with our grandfather and left disappointed and hungry. They choose the busiest day to get rid of the best deal on the menu, and lie about it being sold out."}
{"text":"So fun and delicious. Enjoyed my seafood with my with the Captain Boil sauce in medium heat. I love spicy food and that is the perfect spiciness for my taste bud ! Cute concept of no plates and utensils. Definitely recommend corn with the seafood. Yam fries were yummy. Don't recommend the fish and chips and chicken fingers. Stick to the fresh seafood."}
{"text":"I'm guessing that anyone that been here and given it such a high rating doesn't know how to eat shellfish properly. You need shellfish forks to get the meat out of lobster and crab. Not having them you miss out on so much meat content. I would happily change my rating to 5 stars once they get shellfish forks! Service and food quality were outstanding."}
{"text":"+1 star for the friendly service. I came here on a weekday night and added my name to the waiting list. It was a 30 minute wait for a table of two. So we left to get a drink nearby while we waited. The hostess texted us when our table was ready. We ordered shrimps and mussels in the captains boil sauce. We asked for it to be mild. The waitress informed us that the captains boil sauce already had a bit of spice so we changed it to non-spicy. Thank goodness she mentioned that because it was the perfect amount of heat for us. For those who can only handle a bit of spice, definitely stick with non-spicy for the captains boil sauce. We also ordered wings, Cajun fries and corn. The Cajun fries were extra crispy which I loved! The wings were decent. You have a choice to either have your corn on the side or mixed in with your seafood bag. We chose to have it on the side but ended up mixing it in the bag after because it was too bland to eat on its own. Overall, it was a fun eating experience and I would come back to try the other three sauces on its own. The gloves don't really help to keep your hands clean. By the end of my meal, sauce went through but who cares! Just wash your hands afterwards. The table next to me didn't even bother with their gloves."}
{"text":"I ordered take out from the 476 Yonge St location, and decided to eat at home rather than dine in. I ordered the Cajun seafood fried rice with snow crab legs with the captain's boil sauce. I enjoy spicy food, yet I didn't want to get anything too spicy to make sure that I was able to really taste the seasoning used. The rice and the crab legs were medium heat. I paid around $35 (taxes included) for the meal. The rice portion was worth it as was the crab legs. I must say that this is a messy meal to eat, so be prepared. The captain's boil flavour was a little overwhelming for me. There was a bit too much butter in the mix and after a while I had that nasty buttery taste in the back of my throat. The rice had the same buttery taste making it impossible to taste the shrimp, scallops and corn. I don't think I would go back to the captains boil..On a more positive note..... I enjoyed the plastic bag the crab legs were packed in and the bib that was provided."}
{"text":"Definitely recommended for seafood lovers.  The shrimp are big and juicy, crab is fresh.  Prices are fair.  We loved the Captains Boil sauce.  Just be ready to eat out of plastic bags with your hands - but gloves are provided if you like."}
{"text":"The two of us tried it a few weeks after it opened. The staff was very helpful but were a bit undertrained and uninformed. Given more time, it could only get better.   The 3 stars only were for some limitations and disappointments. You get a pound of whatever fish/seafood you choose. While tasty, I was bored of what became working thru a pound of shrimp. No 1/2lb orders are allowed. Also the garlic bread of 3 small but thick slices were skimpy for the price. The corn was very good. So order carefully and make sure you bring lots of friends to split the order.  We won't be returning as it was good but not good enough for what we paid for dinner."}
{"text":"Have to start by saying that I have been to authentic seafood boils in the southern US, so was excited when I spotted this place for lunch. But there's where the similarity ended. A \"unique\" presentation style that didn't sit well with us. Let's start with the positives. Decor was good, clean and bright. Nice seating layout with comfy booths available. Liked that the partitions were high enough that your table is private. Server was OK, fairly quick and attentive. Tried to order a beer, but was told that they actually don't have their license yet....so the previous poster Bao D. is full of BS. Think he might be associated with the business, in fact pretty sure he was working when we were there. Yes, it might be a good place to have a beer and watch a game,....but not yet. Most of the food quality was good, to very good. You pick your mains, in my case it was mussels and shrimp. Pick your spice preference and heat preference and your sides. There are no sides offered with the main, everything is extra. My mussels and shrimp were fresh, hot and very tasty. Wife ordered the lobster but at $34.95 we didn't think it was worth it. Overcooked and mushy and maybe a pound and a half, but probably closer to a pound. Now to the presentation. I get the prep of the food in a BPA free food grade plastic bag that allows the cook to infuse the flavour and spice. Gets it into all the little nooks and crannies. But then the whole bag is literally dropped in the middle of the table. No plate, no utensils. I get the seafood boil, it usually is with your hands, for peel and eat shrimp, crawfish etc. But not in a messy plastic bag that you have to reach into to get your food out. I ended up splitting the bags open and using them like a plate. We also ordered sweet potato fries and okra as side dishes. Both done well, but again, no plate for sharing or utensils, so everyone at the table has to reach in with their mucky hands and grab. Again, I ended up dumping half the fries out on the paper covered table so I could corral them in my \"general\" vicinity.  So overall, food was ok to great. Not crazy about the presentation so probably won't be in a rush to go back."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Captain's Boil. I've already been here twice since they're grand opening in December, and I'll definitely be back for more. I went during a Saturday night and had to wait around 45 minutes, but they take down your number and will call you when your table is ready.   Favourite seafood: Lobster, shrimp and mussels Favourite sauces: Captain's Boil (lemon pepper, cajun and garlic) and Lemon Pepper  You can customize the spiciness levels here as well. It ranges from mild to fire, but keep in mind that mild does have a bit of a kick it to it so I would recommend ordering down a level.   The whole lobster is around $35 (changes depending on the season), and it's perfect for sharing between two people. It's definitely a must order every time I stop by. The shrimp is also one my favourites as well, however, you do need to peel them (but totally worth it!).   We ended up ordering the crawfish as well which ended up being overrated. They're mainly just shell and barely have any meat to them. I would definitely not recommend ordering the crawfish. Definitely not worth the price.   Anything that you need to peel (ie. lobster or crab) can be a bit challenging but you can ask them for scissors! I didn't learn that until my second visit and it just made everything sooooo much easier.  Everything does end up getting really messy at the end. They do have a sink located within the main dining room which is super convenient. Keep in mind that the aromas of the restaurant do cling to your clothes!  Atmosphere: 4/5 | Service: 4/5 | Price: 4/5"}
{"text":"All I can say is meh. Friends recommended this and said it was amazing and a must try. We went with high expectations and it was just okay. I'd say the price of the bags is kind of high for what you're getting and it didn't taste that great. However, I will say the Cajun fries were delicious! But I went to a seafood restaurant and all I ate was fries because I found the breaded shrimp and the bagged crawfish to be flavourless and therefore difficult to eat."}
{"text":"To think that a restaurant with multiple locations would have a billing system to separate bills, nope not here. Staff needs more training. Not coming back."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night at 7:30 and was seated at 7:45! After reading all the reviews on Yelp I thought I would have to wait over 2 hours but I guess I came at the right time. We got 1 order of shrimp with the house seasoning mild, 1 order of mussels with garlic sauce, and a side order of their cajan fries. The seafood came out quickly but they forgot our fries until we had to ask about them, which was when we were basically finished our meal. It would have been nice to eat it all at the same time but the cajan fries were really good so ill stick with a 5 star review.  I had a great time and will definetly be back! =)"}
{"text":"The shrimp was absolutely delicious and fresh. Unfortunately I didn't think the same for the king crab legs. That tasted a little gummy.   I enjoyed the wings and fries, as well as the fried rice. I would come back for the shrimp again next time and try the other options.   Service was really good. Shidell was lovely on the phone."}
{"text":"Heard about this place from a friend that went to their North York location. Apparently their north York location is jammed packed and some folks were waiting like 2 hrs.... So when I saw this place in my neck of woods.... I came by to try it out.   Came on a Friday night around dinner time with the gf. A bit of wait... But not too bad. I ordered the shrimps in their captain's boil sauce with med heat. It's combination of all of their three flavors together. Added some sausages and corn to the mix too. Gf got the dungeness crabs and clams. Dungeness crab was with the captain's boil sauce mild heat. Clams were with garlic sauce. Everything tasted really good. Loved that the flavors got right into the meat of the seafood. Loved the optional salt pepper lime sauce they give you to dip your seafood in. It adds a diff taste to the palette. Only thing wish they had was some type of bread to dip in the sauce. They were out of garlic bread :(   Service was very nice. Our server checked up on us at the right time without being too obtrusive. Also,  filled up the water for us too.   Would definitely come back!!! Apparently they are putting in draught Sapporo!! Can't wait! This is a great addition to the community!"}
{"text":"This is a chain so while I didn't come to this location I wanted to write a review about the overall \"Captain's\" experience.  I came here after hearing a lot of buzz about the franchise and wanted to see for myself what all the fuss was about: Seafood. fusion sauces. bags.  And overall, that's what I got - and while I thought the food itself was mediocre (alright for taste, but pretty pricey for what you get) I wasn't so impressed with the overall experience.   The amount of wastage for a meal was almost unbearable - just looking around the room and seeing people chumping down food in plastic bags with plastic gloves is frankly unappetizing Our entire group came away feeling more empty about our impact to the environment than the \"alright tasting\" food we consumed.   The quality of food took the backseat to the draw of the experience, I think a lot of people came here for the same reason I did: to be there for the gimmick rather than having good quality food.  The meals was smothered with sauce, you couldn't really taste the seafood at all. So if you're a real foodie, I cannot see you coming out of here with a smile.   So, until this chain (and similar other chains) can prove they can environmentally sustainable, I highly recommend avoiding this place all together."}
{"text":"My review of this place is simple. The concept of how they make the food and the novelty of eating with your hands has an appeal that is quite limited. We went in here thinking it was going to be a nice seafood restaurant. When we sat down we thought the plastic bibs and the cheap disposable gloves were a bit odd. When we went to order we found out the sizzling plates are only available until 4pm after that it is just bags of seafood that they plop on your paper covered table.   The service was abysmal as they needed to be prompted several times to give us water and then never refilled our glasses. They kept delivering the wrong food to our table.   The concept of digging food out of plastic bags just didn't sit well with me. Perhaps if those bags had been in buckets or even better if the food had been in buckets it would have gone over better. The sauce was laced with garlic and even their mild was too hot for my daughter  This was our one and only time we will ever go there."}
{"text":"Dropped by for a visit after all the recommendation from my friend.  Oh boy were they ever packed.  Waited about 10 minutes for a table, but definitely worth the wait.  The hostess Ava greeted us at the door, kept touching base with us until our table was ready.  Our server Shaine greeted us once we were seated.  Very knowledgable and answered any question that we had. We ordered clams, lobster, mussels, and a WHOLE snow crab.  Apparently is a limited item, must try!!! Both the lobster and snow crab are really fresh.  Note on the side: lots of parking compared to other location.  Right off the highway.  Patio available!! We couldn't get a spot on the patio. (Longer waiting time). Draft Sapporo!! We finished the meal off with a menchies in the same plaza!!!!  Definitely will come back for more freshness!!!"}
{"text":"If you like and appreciate seafood this place should be avoided at all costs. Mussels were way overcooked but would make for an excellent squash ball. All we could taste from seafood rice was butter. Final straw was the shrimp with its poop clearly visible (fries were the 'best' part ). Brought this to the waitstaffs attention. The kitchens response to the shrimp was 'this is what we should expect'. We left 3/4 full bags of everything. No attempts made to offer alternative food options or discount the bill. This place is a gimmick and you should not make the same mistake as we made. I am honestly baffled by positive reviews when EVERY component of our experience was poor."}
{"text":"This place is freaking awesome. We had the muscles with captain's boil sauce spicy and it was sooo good. We also got some garlic bread to dip in the extra sauce.  Highly recommend this place. We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Service not very good.  Not attentive, literally had to walk from my table to the front to get the things I needed throughout my dinner.  Looked like they wanted to get rid of us.  The gratuity was auto charged, otherwise they would not have gotten a good tip.    They get 2 stars for some of their food was good, especially crab and lobster."}
{"text":"I went here with my boyfriend last week and we both ordered the sizzling plate special with a side of fish + assorted seafood. The boil seasoning was very salty compared to the one near Yonge and College and the fish was really salty as well without the teriyaki sauce. Won't be going back to this one again. Since the location is hot, it seems like they don't really try too hard in the kitchen (salty seasoning, shrimps aren't deveined) Also, don't bring your boyfriend here... Server was eyeing down my boyfriend and also had the nerve to *ever so gently* touch him on the back when handing over the debit machine. LOL! Hope this helps everyone. :)"}
{"text":"Love this place! the seafood is fresh and the Captain's Boil sauce is delicious. The baked potato adds a nice balancing touch to the saucy bag.  Warning: it can get messy eating with gloves and bibs but it is worth it. Avoid wearing white shirts.   You get to choose the sauce and the hotness level of the food. It is a fun experience eating with your hands."}
{"text":"Seats for an hour, and food for half an hour to wait. One order until pay has not come up, had to be cancelled, the food did not imagine the delicious."}
{"text":"Love the fun experience of messy eating. Captain's Boil sauce is superb! I loved it so much that I even poured the left over sauce on rice and ate it!  Fish teriyaki, on the other hand, was not at all my favorite. I think it's over priced for several over-fried thin slice of fish.  French fries were too salty.  I'd recommend to just stick with choose-your-own seafood menu."}
{"text":"The worst customer service I've experienced. The restaurant was empty and had three waiters and I had not been served for a long while. Terrible. Super slow."}
{"text":"Come here for the lunch specials daily until 4pm.  $8.95 for the Chicken Teriyaki with rice or $10.95 for the fish teriyaki with rice + a bag of seafood with your choice of sauce(2 shrimp, 2 mussels, 2 clams, 2 crawfish).    Both teriyaki were tasty.  Seafood was very good too.  Very good value for lunch and quite full after."}
{"text":"The food is soooo good there?and so does their service?but parking is tough?especially in weekends"}
{"text":"It's a boil place (eat with your hands [gloves supplied], food comes in bags [food grade, just served, not cooked in the bag]).    Clean, comfortable seating, good table space, tv's are well placed.  Tried this on a Monday night with my partner.   Hostess and service was efficient and friendly on the way in and out.  Prices are reasonable.    Food was good: Cajun fries were good; broccoli and lotus root were nice; lobster (signature flavour), snow crab (plain) and shrimp (med spice) were very good.  Gloves were good, my fingers didn't smell of fish on the way out. Great place to answer the need for a seafood fix."}
{"text":"Good seafood, but not the best. The experience itself is amazing. Wearing an apron and gloves and eat is different!"}
{"text":"Never been to a place like this before and it was great. But one thing i was mislead on was the King crab leg, for the amount of money you pay and the picture they placed on the menu you would have thought you'd get more than one leg. But nonetheless it was a great tasty restaurant."}
{"text":"Great food! Love the concept. However, they have a policy where they won't seat you until your party is all there. Given that there's a line up out the door and their entrance is so congested, they made us stand for 15 mins waiting for others until they could seat us. Actually just staring at our table."}
{"text":"Great service excellent staff ask for Amanda very pleasant and courteous! 5313 Yonge St.."}
{"text":"Wait staff was very patient and nice. They cheerfully answered a lot of questions. Each of them deserves strong commendation for the service. A lot of food is offered - we ordered too much! Oysters were among the best I've ever had (as good as those from New Orleans), although maybe a bit expensive at $2.50 each. Mussels were tough and not particularly flavorful. The captains boil signature sauce did not do much for me; I should have chosen a butter and garlic sauce or something more basic. Fried shrimp were typical of a Low to medium priced chain. French fries were excellent. However, I have been to much better seafood restaurants in a similar price range."}
{"text":"A bit pricy, but it was such a fun experience to eat here. Don't wear long sleeves or nice clothing, since you may get food on it although they gave you plastic gloves and napkins.  The medium spicy was really spicy. My friend and I ordered a pound of shrimp and a pound of mussels, so it didn't cost that much. But, we still needed to get desserts after..."}
{"text":"Highly recommended. The crawfish in captain's boil sauce and mussels in garlic sauce were fantastic. I would recommend getting the corn as well. The service seemed somewhat unenthusiastic and I was really confused that they have a wall of beers and don't actually serve any of them. Would definitely go again."}
{"text":"I went here this week and the place was quite busy. Food was good and not too expensive, but too salty for my taste. The second floor only had one washroom, so there was always a line up. At a restaurant with messy food and people washing their hands all the time, I would expect more washrooms."}
{"text":"Great food, and affordable. The spice is just right. Using hands to shell shrimps and crab is a great experience."}
{"text":"Definitely worth trying. Seafood is very good. Chicken breast is also great. We selected their \"captain sauce\" which is a combination of the 3 sauces. Everything is lovely. The waitresses were polite and friendly.  Be sure to dress down! They give you bibs and gloves. You eat with your hands, with some help from the plastic forks. But the gloves are super thin and the sauce did get through. Your fingers would get dirty. It's fun and I wouldn't mind eating in that way once in a while. But this may not be for everyone."}
{"text":"So glad we made reservations! The place was packed and rightfully so!   We ordered clams, shrimp, lobster and crayfish as mains with a different sauces and varying degree of heat. Everything was fresh! It was so good I didn't pay much attention to OKC blowing out GS!! Personally I liked the captain boil sauce with medium heat the most.  Also think anything above medium takes away from the fresh seafood.   Staff is friendly and attentive. Decor also adds to the overall dining experience. Nicely surprised that they have Sapporo on tap!"}
{"text":"I love trying out new places and since this was in the location of our previous favourite dim sum restaurant (sadly closed) we thought what they hey, why not. We ate here about a month ago and had fries and shrimp with different sauces.     Now I can tell you why not:  1) The service: definitely lacking.  The waitress kept pacing the restaurant but not stopping to check on us or give us the water and beer we ordered. It was our first time and we told the server as much, but she was not helpful in guiding us and looked at us like we were imposing on her time with our ignorance.  2) The food is scalding hot.   The corn on the cob we ordered, we ran to the sink (the sink everyone in the restaurant is supposed to use to wash up after their meal) to run it under cold water and bring it down to handling temperature.  3) The atmosphere is loud and forced. The generic pop music is blasted so you have to shout to talk.  Looking around the restaurant you just see people quietly try to wrestle their food and generally looking uncomfortable at being made to eat like horses with feed bags.  3) The food is served in a PLASTIC BAG!  Scalding hot food + melting plastic =food that tastes like plastic with cajun sauce.  Where do you put the shrimp shell? on the table!  SO 4 people cramped in a small booth with drinks and 5 bags of food have nowhere to put their refuse other than anywhere and everywhere.   A disgusting mess.  Yes you get gloves- but they don't help and the bibs ties tear.  Expect to get dirty if you eat here or wear your painting outfit.  We ate as fast as our burned fingers would allow, paid our bill and don't plan to ever return.  I love seafood but the only type of client I can seen repeatedly coming here is a group of frat boys wanting cheap shrimp/seafood where they can make a mess and talk with loud self-importance about nothing.  This is not a place for families, it is not a place to take a date and not more than a novelty on Yonge street.   I highly recommend staying away!"}
{"text":"All your food is brought to you in plastic bags not buckets which is the norm. Hope plastic is BPA free! Garlic bread disappointing given the price and taste. You wear gloves and bibs to eat. Small narrow and busy restaurant. Sauces you choose from are underwhelming when it comes to taste."}
{"text":"Went here one night with my buddies, both my kids, and wife. Booked a reservation the day before, arrived on time and was seated at the table shortly after. The food was okay but definitely not worth the price you pay. Had one friend order the Dungeness Crab, another order the lobster, and three of us ordered King Crab Legs, mussels, shrimp, and clams. The only thing going for this joint is that spicy sauce that food comes in......can drink it all day long. That being said, wasn't worth the $400 we spent there. I mean really, charging 6 dollars for a few slithers of sausage and a dollar for 1/3 of a corn on the cob is borderline robbery if you ask me. The other issue I have is that the table isn't cleared while you're eating but rather at the end so can someone remind me why so much tip is involved. It was difficult to continue eating because it's messy to begin with but when you add shells, bags of sauce, and dirty paper towel, it really isn't so fun. The overhead is so low because your food is served in plastic bags, the rice in Styrofoam bowls, and table is cleared when you're leaving. I guess that's why I noticed the manager/franchise owner laughing at the cash counter (probably laughing all the way to the bank). And correct me if I'm wrong, all that plastic and Styrofoam can't be good for the environment, can it? Last time I'll be eating food like this."}
{"text":"This place is overrated in terms of the experience. The Louisiana style dining does have a charm but it still isn't worth the price tag. I would expect to have some basics down, but $50 for crab is a bit pricey. All prices are based on lb.  The lunch menu looked more appealing. Not to mention that no kids menu. For Dinner, however, suggest that you go next door to the Red Lobster for a better experience and food get rather than dress like a pirate (read plastic gloves and plastic bib) with an oversized garbage bin on your table."}
{"text":"I'm glad to find this restaurant in Toronto. I believe it's the first one in town. It's definitely worth trying. Seafoods are super fresh and yum. We ordered shrimps, mussels and clams. Price is good. Some people complained about the price. Come one! It's seafood at the end of the day! Love their Captain's Boil sauce especially when it's slightly spicy. Will come back."}
{"text":"An enjoyable eating experience. The food was awesome, perfect seasoning. Service was above and beyond. My new favourite seafood place."}
{"text":"Got takeout out twice. Amazing food and great portions. I recommend getting the captain boils flavour. Will be a return customer :)"}
{"text":"The food was okay, but the service was garbage at the Newmarket location \"Yonge & Sawmill\" VERY slow, and the My didn't even check to see If we were okay, like waitress/waiters do."}
{"text":"Good experience if you want to go somewhere different. Love the Captain Boil Shrimps, Mussels and Cajun Fries. We also ordered Lobsters and Clams. The only thing I suggest is if you're not into clams don't order it as you won't get much of it, 90% of it are just the shells . I would order mussels instead."}
{"text":"This was a great experience, we enjoyed the food and the service. This place is a must for the flavor and for the environment.  I recommend the snow crab legs and the mussels."}
{"text":"Great service, even better food. Made me feel like I was down south. Well seasoned food, I recommend the captain boil's flavour. Good music. Not to busy mid day. Server was attentive."}
{"text":"Great seafood, great captain's boil sauce, which tastes bold and gritty.  Not your everyday place as the prices are through the roof (considering they must save a ton on not having to clean any dishes)   If you don't like seafood then this isn't the place for you.   If you love seafood, this is a great place to spend $50."}
{"text":"I had to eat in their down town place for first time and it was a total fun experience, eating with hands wearing gloves was so different that I have a funny and silly feeling first! I had fish entree coming with the small shrimp side and it was delicious."}
{"text":"My second visit here.  First time was on the first few weeks of their opening. During that time it was chaotic, forgot our orders, disorganize, when my friend wanted a to go for the leftover shrimp, they didnt give her anything, so she carried it in a bag just like that..ewww!!!!   Went back the second time:  Better service, kept on refilling our water, food came out fast, no mistakes with our order, and gave us a container and bag for the leftover shrimp, kept on checking on us, easy to flag down the server.   Food review:  Ordered the lunch special fish teriyaki with other seafood in captain boil sauce $10.99, plain fish teriyaki only $10.99 (not on lunch menu), fried chicken wing with cajun price $10.99, shrimp in medium heat captain boil sauce $12.99 and coke  $2. All bill with tax and tip was $59 and had leftover shrimp and fish to go.  Food is great but i wish i just settled with mild heat as medium heat was a bit spicy for me. Hubby enjoyed the fish. Daughter enjoyed her chicken wings and fries and she would not even share her food with us lol. Im surprised she like the shrimp too. But i wish they have dessert option. Big tip of the day. Come during lunch time for their special and no line up and Place not that busy. Will come back again."}
{"text":"Fish teriyaki sizzling plate is a smart option if you want to try a few of the seafoods they serve on the menu. Great price too! We went for a late lunch, no disappointment. Friendly and helpful servers too."}
{"text":"Well.. I wish I could say it was good, but it wasn't.. The food had a strong smell of chlorine... Even the spices couldn't cover it.  The service was too intrusive   Will not try again"}
{"text":"This is how I described it to a friend:  \"We went to a place called Captain Boil. It's interesting but not for everyone. They give you a bib, and transparent gloves and serve your food -- boiled seafood with some sauce -- in a transparent bag. Yes, really. You eat without utensils and it is really messy but it was a unique and fun experience.\"  It is definitely different. It is a little pricey depending on the seafood you get. I heard the lunch option was a little more affordable. It is novel enough that I would come back again at least once, but I know for me once more will be it and it will get old after that.  The food was tasty and fresh and to be honest better than I thought. With sides, tax and tip, it was $70 for 2 which is not the range I want to spend on food too often  3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Food was tasty too much butter is used. Don't come here expecting food to be light"}
{"text":"The service here is really slow. The wait staff spend too much time socializing at the bar and aren't really attentive. The table behind me yelled \"excuse me\" at least 7 times before someone came to help him.  The captains boil sauce is good, though it's really buttery and salty. The mussels in garlic sauce was great!   Everything is served in disposable containers/plastic bags - some even double bagged, dish/flatware is all disposable, bowls in styrofoam, drinks in paper or plastic cups, bibs and gloves are all plastic, rolls of paper towels being used.   It was an experience, but I will probably never go back. The waste produced doesn't sit well with me."}
{"text":"We went to the Newmarket location and had muscles and shrimps which were delicious, we also had lotus roots but We didn't like it.The whole system works well. Their service is fast and people who work there are all nice. The food is pricey but worth it to try.I love having gloves and apron but I don't think using too much of plastic is environment friendly and I don't like it and it's a personal opinion; I have asked them about plastic bags and aprons and they said they are trying to provide more environment friendly products.Because of that I would like to give them 4.5 but since I can't, I'll give them 5."}
{"text":"Went to the north York location and decided to give this one a try.   I have been to new Orleans for their seafood boil and I was really excited that there was finally a seafood boil in Toronto.   Ordered 2lbs of the crab, 1lb shrimp, 1lb mussels and they were all pretty amazing. Ohh and the Cajun fries(those are delicious) I would suggest the Captain's Boil sauce as it is a petty good mixture of the other 3 sauces.    The only con is that there is not that much sauce in the bags compared to the north York location and I wish the bags came with corn and sausage like in new Orleans.   Tips: get the muscle instead of the clams, snow crab instead of King crab, add lots of corn!  Also, the service is great here and there is not a lot of wait time like the north York location  which is about 2 hours for a 2 people walk in (call ahead to estimate wait times)"}
{"text":"American quantity over quality feel. Salty, typical orange colored sauces and flavors. Nearly all the main dishes are listed as market price. You'll never make a bigger mess eating in your life. Nothing special."}
{"text":"We came here on a Friday evening very excited with the promise of great service and delectable food.  Waited a few moments before being axknowledged by the staff, it was not busy. Ordered promptly as our group of three were ravenous.  Shrimp fries and cajun fries came first. The shrimp fries seemed a bit off on taste and I would not recommend. The cajun fries were awesome!  Two of us ordered the shrimp bag with the captain's boil seasoning in medium heat, the other ordered crawfish.  My order came first and I dug in. Sausage and potatoes were added in and full of the yummy seasoning (love garlic, good amount of heat).  My two friends however waited an additional 30ms for their boil bags though they were ordered at the same time. We try to be polite and not be upset, but this is an unacceptable amount of time to wait, especially if one person is eating awkwardly alone!  Apparently the kitchen had \"messed up\".  When the last boil bags were brought it was at 11 30 pm, places closes at 12. My friends felt  rushed to eat and what made this situation worse is we were essentially the last ones there, cleanup had started.  I feel that cleanup should start after your customers have left, or at the other end of the establishment where no one is eating. We were not comped on our bill or provided a courtesy. As a manager, this should have been addressed (manager was aware).  I often think of you cause a stink, companies are more likely to address the issue.  Food being pretty good, I still am  not sure I would return given the circumstance or lack of consideration.  My only other comment would be for them to up their beer game. Very limited in the overall drink selection."}
{"text":"Love love love! I don[t know who came up with this but this is genius! I've been to this place many times (both college and yonge locations) and have never been disappointed. The Captain's boil sauce is to die for."}
{"text":"Lovely. Even when i walk in with no reservation, they still table us within a few minutes. Great food, unfortunately i would like it to be cheaper what that is based off seasonal pricing so it is fair"}
{"text":"We ordered crawfish, mussels, shrimp and lotus root today. The Cajun medium hot shrimp is the most popular among three, crawfish with captain book was also good, but not easy to manage. Service needs some improvements, we sat in a booth far most to the cashier, we waited about 10 mins to get the orders done."}
{"text":"This place is great! I went there on a Saturday night around 8:30 PM. The restaurant was fairly busy. We were promptly seated. The server did not seem too familiar with the menu. But nevertheless it was pretty easy to figure out. We ordered 1lb of snowcrab legs - fantastic but my 11 yr old son ate most of it. He complained about it being too spicy (medium) but kept eating anyways!, 1lb shrimp with sausage added which was very good and enough for 2 people. 1 seafood fried rice - amazing! I could have eaten just the fried rice. And a yam fries. The bill came up $72 including tax which is not bad for a great seafood meal. I would definitely go back for a 2nd visit."}
{"text":"The place is clean, washroom is okay, service is okay, friendly. Had the garlic clams, very fresh. Captains boil sauce with shrimps, not very strong flavour so wouldn't get that sauce again. Shrimps were fresh but not sweet.   Compared to good catch boil house, I like good catch better as more options available.   Nice atmosphere good for gatherings. A few booths available"}
{"text":"Heard about this place through a friend, decided to try it out. Our server was kind and thoroughly explained the menu to us, and I must admit that it was exciting to see all the yummy seafood! On the table was a set of plastic gloves and a plastic bib which added to the fun experience of dining at The Captains Boil.   We ordered the clams with the garlic sauce and it was phenominal. The large pieces of chopped garlic was so fresh that it was spicy, if it was minced it would have been better. As with most clam dishes, you order it as a side dish and not an entree (unless you are ballin). Next was the mussels with cajun sauce which was delightful. The cajun seasoning was the most flavorful of the three that we tried. I dipped my cajun fries in this sauce as it had some sort of smokey buttery flavor, very unqiue. My friend recommended the shrimp with the captains boil sauce which was apparently a combination of all three of the sauces (lemon pepper, garlic, and cajun sauce) but to me it was simply the cajun sauce with less flavor (lighter on the palette). I'm not a fan of peeling the shells off the shrimp so next time I will ask for peeled and deveined shrimp lol For $1 you can add a corn on the cob to any of the dishes (or plastic bags rather) and the flavor of the corn will pretty much adhere to any sauce you want it served with. For dessert we ordered deep fried chicken wings with cajun fries (clearly I'm a fan of sweets) which was mediocre at best.   Overall it was an interesting dining experience as I have never eaten out of a plastic bag with gloves before lol Skip the bib but roll your sleeves up because it was a mess. By the end of the meal, I had cajun seasoning all over my face and I walked around without knowing it. Our server was very attentive, you can tell that she knows how to create a fine dining experience for her customers. I must point out that it is a small restaurant so the couple next to us was able to eavesdrop on my dirty little secrets. Bring your loved ones here for a unique dining experience. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend arrived around 10:35pm and was told they're closed, even though the sign and website says they close at 12am. So we asked when is their actual closing time if its not the same as displayed. The male employee then said \"we dont actually follow the times\" and looked at us like we asked the most stupid question.  So if you plan on eating at this restaurant at night, I suggest you call first, since it seems like their closing time depends on their mood."}
{"text":"The seafood is good but the price is on the high side. For the price of the dishes, the portion is a bit small. There is not enough choices of the spice."}
{"text":"Interesting experience. Went on a weekday at 4pm and there were a lot of empty seats.   A lb of cajun shrimp for 12.95 was quite filling. You choose the level of spice. Medium spicy wasn't too bad but still hot. The shrimp came boiling hot at first but cooled down quickly. It was a lot of work peeling them! Not the best idea if you're super hungry.  Wings and fries are 10.95. Cajun fries tasted like Popeyes but no complaints. Wings came with six and were breaded. Pretty decent.    Our waitress was nice but she never came by until we wanted the bill."}
{"text":"We got seafood rice with shrimp, corona, and 1.5LB lobster with Captain's boil flavor. It was really good, well cooked and everything nice. Enjoy your food!"}
{"text":"My second time going here. The food itself is amazing. The only problem is our entire party of 3 got food poisoning when we went on Saturday the second time around.  2 days in bed is enough to keep me from coming back."}
{"text":"Smaller than the Yonge St. locations. Located near YamChops and the Mod Club in the heart of Little Italy. Been to the soft opening in August.   Had mussels, clams and lobster and all was cooked to perfection (not overcooked).  Their Grand Opening is soon. They have an awesome special happening now where all food items are 10% Off until Sept 18, 2016. Worth going!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went on a Thursday night, not too busy. Total bill was $100 + tip (only two beers, the rest was food) so a bit expensive for most.  The Good: Service was fast, friendly, considerate, informative. The food was good (king crab legs, fish and chips, fries, corn) but not exceptional. The ambiance was fine - newly renovated of course.  The Not So Good: First, when you spend $100 for two people on a meal, you are hoping for a bit of professionalism with the staff. Unfortunately, most of the servers were dressed in some sort of mix between yoga wear and skater wear. Please, no more lululemon! One disturbing note: one server had skater shoes on and on the bottom sole, clearly visible, was inked in black: \"403 F*** You\". Really? As a server you think that's appropriate? What if kids came in and saw that? So, server \"professionalism\" is not there. And, heck, maybe some people don't care.  Second, they do this strange thing of putting your bill on the table, adding to it, crossing things off, etc. When we asked, the said \"it's so we know that you got all of your food\". Ok, fair enough but what happened to the old days where \"memory\" was used? Worse, at one point they asked, \"did you get everything?\" Well, either use the silly bill system or not!  Finally, I really can't say the food was great. Good, sure. But Calgary has so many great places to eat it will be hard to justify going back here (especially at the prices) The fish and chips were good, but nothing you can't get at a dozen other places. The crab legs were good but a bit fishy and the way they serve it (bag) means some parts are really spicy and other parts not so much. And, sure, the corn and fries were fine.  I doubt we will go back anytime soon. Maybe in a few months to try some of the other items but only in a pinch."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night and tried our luck without reservations. We ended up waiting an hour. The waiting area was pretty cramped and we waited along the staircase going up. We ordered a pound of mussels with captains boil sauce and a pound of shrimp with mild sauce. On the side we ordered Cajun fries. The first couple of bites were really good but after a while I realized there was way too much garlic flavour. Probably not the best place for a first date since you'll be eating with your hands as well. Our fries came at the very end and our server was nice enough to remove it from our bill. I'd recommend trying it out once but I probably won't go back until the crowds die down."}
{"text":"A good place to eat in small or big groups. I've came to this location twice and both experiences were 5/5.  I loved the first meal when I went the first time that I ended up getting basically the same thing on the second run. I had the clams in the Captain Boil's sauce and it was bomb! Such good flavour and very easy to eat. I tried the seafood rice dish but found some of the stuff that comes with it wasn't for me (the crayfish). I also discovered that the garlic bread dipped into the sauce you get from the clams is SO GOOD and would recommend you try it!  Prices are average, staff was very present if you needed something and very helpful if you need help making a decision.   My friend tried the lobster bisque and would not recommend it including since it came in a small Styrofoam container and was watery and barely any lobster meat in it. Also was $6..   Would still easily recommend this place for anyone to try!"}
{"text":"I made a reservation on a Saturday night to this location and luckily I did because there was a line up for seats. I ordered a pound of shrimp with corn with the captain's boil mix. It's quite tasty and flavourful and salty but at the same time that's what makes it so good. I also ordered garlic bread which wasn't anything special to me. It's literally just toasted bread with some butter. I would prefer if the bread and butter were toasted together so it's more crispy. The only thing I hate is having severe garlic breath after this meal. I had to brush my teeth that night at least 3 times but still could taste the garlic."}
{"text":"Honestly upset that this place is really mismanaged by the staff....reached there at sharp 10:16 pm on a Wednesday night and saw the chairs up on the tables and the cleaning going on ! Asked them their online timings say they close at 11pm....and the waitress was like \"sorry we are closed...as our last order is 10:30 \" Seriously it was not even 10:30 !!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great fresh seafood, great service, great atmosphere! We tried out this restaurant on Mothers' Day and it did not disappoint!  Seaside eateries on the East Coast of Canada pale in comparison to what we experienced here. Friendly greetings at the door, easy to follow menu, tools (scissors, crackers, ample plastic gloves and a full roll of paper towels), and helpful advice from the service team all added to the phenomenal food.   We started with a plate of fresh oysters served on ice accompanied by little containers of horseradish, seafood sauce, Spicy Cajun Sauce, and lemon wedges. A swig of nicely-warmed Sake washed them down our gullets to our grateful bellies. mmmm mmmm mmmm good!  When we donned our \"uniforms, i.e. bibs\" and dove into our \"feed buckets, i.e. plastic bags\" of crawfish peering out of delicious spicy Cajun sauce, snow crab legs bathing with cobs of corn in delicious garlic butter, and the best Seafood Fried Rice I've ever had.....we were indeed in Euphoria!  Bonus: I loved that we were never rushed, and when we were done, a very cordial server presented me with a long stem rose to celebrate Mothers' Day.  Another Bonus: HD TV over our booth was playing the Blue Jays versus Mariners baseball game. Go Jays!!!  I am giving this recent addition to Newmarket's culinary scope....FIVE STARS!!! No one will walk the plank today!  Signed....Captain Nancy !!"}
{"text":"If you like seafood this is the place for you. Our family of four arrived on a Friday evening around 6pm and got a booth. The interior looks like a boat and the tables have paper tablecloths and giant plastic bibs and gloves. It looked like a set up for some serious shellfish eating!   We ordered a pound each of lobster ($34.99/lb) and snow crab legs ($18.99/lb) plus fish and chips ($10.99) for the kids, and a plate of Cajun fried rice. They have a few domestic  beers on tap. We each ordered a pint of Canadian. Service was knowledgeable, friendly and prompt. The manager/owner came over to chat and see how we were doing. Always a good sign.   With the seafood, you order it with the sauce if your choice and it is boiled then tossed in the sauce. It arrives in a bag and you basically dig in. They give your seafood tools (scissors and crackers). All the food was excellent. Yes it was messy but that was the fun of it.  Whole bill came out to $90 plus tips, which I thought was excellent value considering we had a full fresh seafood dinner, alcohol, and went home with extras too.   Great experience. Will definitely return to Captain's Boil again!"}
{"text":"It's honestly such a different dining experience than your average restaurant. I found the food was worth the price. Not too expensive, not too cheap. The cajun fries is a must if you go here. However, because this is on such a busy street, our car got towed. Did not know the side street parking laws as we weren't from the area. The more you know, I guess."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time or your money. Chinese owned and operated. They make it very apparent that they are not interested in you or your money unless you are Chinese. Very rude, yet so happy and polite with the Asian customers. It's a shame what this country has become. Shame on you China-Boil. Overpriced junk."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a meal here with four others and it was delicious!  I've been to another location before and this, by far, had better atmosphere.  It's a large space with lots of tables and it was nice and bright.  It's perfect for large groups.  We ordered shrimps, mussels, king crab, and clams and enjoyed all of them as they were perfectly cooked.  The service was friendly and courteous and the servers were mostly knowledgeable, especially given that they just recently opened.  I would definitely be back here for another visit."}
{"text":"We came in at 11pm on a Tuesday and there was no line. We were the only ones in the restaurant, but we were told that they had hour long waits right before we got there. They have a nice selection of food on the menu, but their most popular are the seafood in bags of sauce. Delicious options for sauce and spice levels. They didn't have crawfish in yet when we went so I will definitely be coming back to try that. The sauce was very tangy in garlic and tasted delicious. Definitely recommend for a new experience in dining, very similar to Boiling Crab in the states. They currently have their promotion of 10% off your entire order until the end of November so go now!"}
{"text":"I've been a Captain Boil go-er ever since they opened in Toronto. For the first time in my life, I've experienced pretty bad customer service.   Went here on a Saturday night with my family for my Mother's birthday. There was no 'Welcome to Captain's boil' here, which to my surprise happens at ALL the other locations. The server we got was very absent minded and not attentive. We asked for another pair of gloves, he was reaching for them in his pocket, stopped and told us 'I'll be back'. He continued to serve 3 other tables and disregarded giving us the gloves. We had to ask him TWICE and both times he forgot. So we had to ask other servers.   Mind you, it's only this little issue, but if you read between the lines here, customer service was subpar. We went on to tell the supervisor, he said it was busy, overwhelming and these servers were 'inexperienced'. Other locations are 10x busier and still have AMAZING customer service. There seems to be something lacking in the training here.   Overall, the food was great and everything came on time. They just need to focus more on their training and teach their servers to be ATTENTIVE and at least smile.   We had a terrible experience here and we will not be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"I went with a party of 3 and the service was excellent - friendly and very fast. We ordered 2lbs of shrimp and muscles and they were all decent, I didn't find the garlic in the sauce to be overwhelming but wasn't blown away by the taste either. Also I know some people aren't bothered by it, but pleaseee de-vein the shrimp! Overall though I'd probably go again to try the other dishes, why not."}
{"text":"I don't understand why some people are complaining about the lack of utensils and the mess. This isn't one of those restaurants where you randomly go in not knowing anything. It's all word of mouth, so don't deny that you know!   YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GETTING INTO. DON'T BE A BABY AND COMPLAIN.   ANYWAYS, food was great! Service was fast and courteous! And atmosphere was pretty fun and chill.  I'm always skeptical of seafood places. Every single one I've ever been to, whatever I order (usually shrimp) ends up feeling like a Goodyear tire. So please imagine my surprise and satisfaction when I tear into my bag and find saucy shrimp softer than I don't even know what!   I got the Captain's Boil sauce mix because I'm greedy, and have decided that it is one of THE best sauces I have ever tried on seafood. It's buttery. It's spicy. It's rich and warm. It's like an old millionaire sitting by his fireplace, drinking some good ol' red.   The service was fast and efficient without seeming frazzled, which I very much appreciated. They checked up on us not too much and not too little. Enough to let us enjoy our seafood with each other. Enough to come back and refill our water when the spiciness got too much.   EXCELLENCE.   As for the atmosphere and the ambience and whatever else, think of Jack Astor's, but with functioning lighting and the music turned down a little. There were a good mix of people wearing suits (Why?!) and people looking super casual and everyone else in between so wear whatever makes you feel good.   Spacing between tables was pretty decent. I didn't have anyone shoulder me in my crotch when going to the bathroom, so that's a plus.   The only reason why the lost a star, and really, if we're being honest, they lost HALF a star, it is because of the lack of what one of the other reviewers mentioned.   In a place like this, the gloves serve only as a hindrance. It's hard to eat with them on without feeling like Johnny Depp in a certain Tim Burton film. So what happens? THE GLOVES COME OFF.   So, I would have reallysupermuchoappreciated it if they had hot cloths or lemon water bowl-thingies to give out once we were finished cramming our faces with crustaceans.  That being said, there is a sink by the entrance where you LITERALLY have to crab walk in order to avoid getting sauce in someone's hair, but the extra accoutrements like the lemon water shouldn't have been too much to ask for.   At the end of the day, would I go here again?   YOU BETCHA."}
{"text":"Hmmm the sauce is yummy,  love the the mussels and the shrimps, very meaty mussels and shrimps.  I didn't get to try lobster or crab because they were simply too expensive.    I think the idea of Captain's Boil came from the states.  I've tried one of the most popular ones in Los Angeles called Boiling Crab and Captain's Boil just can't compare.  Seafood at Captain's Boil just tastes like seafood that you can normally get from a regular supermarket, whereas in LA, the seafood tastes more refresh.   Anyways, it's good enough!  The price is reasonable, at least for mussels and shrimps!  The restaurant uses a lot of one-time use cutleries but beer and drinks in a soft plastic cup?? Come on!  I don't remember Toronto has many boiling seafood places couple years back, but lately I've noticed more and more are coming.  Count me in as a return customer but I am going to try other new places as well."}
{"text":"We came on a Tuesday night and we were seated promptly. The service was quick and friendly, and the server took the time to explain how the menu worked. We ordered the shrimp with corn, vegetables and potatoes, which was very flavourful compared to other places that we've tried. We will definitely recommend to our friends!"}
{"text":"This place was great! Exactly the experience we expected to have at a seafood boil. The bibs, the gloves and the piping hot seafood in bags coated with delicious asian inspired seasoning. It's messy, it's fun and a different dining experience. It's quite amusing how people who give this place a bad rating expected fine dining experience at cheap prices. Like give me a break seafood is expensive. You pay for what you get cheapo. Do some research before going then maybe you'll get the concept. Nothings more frustrating than diners who complain because they don't do get it and are disappointed when they expected a romantic lobster dinner. GO TO THE KEG OR CHARCOAL OR WHATEVER OTHER CHAIN RESTAURANT YOU WERE EXPECTING IT TO BE. ya I'm talking to you miss I've been in the industry for blah blah blah.... this place is amazing. I definitely recommend the lobster, snow crab and shrimp with the captains sauce. Note: sometimes they forget and don't bring the crackers just ask and they'll bring some over. Also again for those who done research Captains Boil advertises their bags are biodegradable, BPA free and FDA approved. Enjoy I can't wait to go back next week."}
{"text":"First time came,if seafood is your favourites ,this is the one you may like.The service was good and helpful,place is clean and cozy which is what I like,definitely will come again."}
{"text":"Amazing place. Great customer service. #comingback again for sure. I always go to the spot at Yonge and finch but it's not as nice as this. Yonge and Shepard is super crowded and I only went there because I really love the seafood. We have a hiccup with the lobster and the waitress and the kitchen took care of it promptly. The Cajun sauce is perfect lol my bf keep licking it clean because it was that yummy. I Always have to drag him to go to captain boil but he is in love with this spot now too. It's spacious and decors are modern. Good for big hangout and pigging out. Definitely this is gonna be my spot from now on !"}
{"text":"This is best captian boil. I have been to the Yonge and Sheppard location before. That's where I fall in love with their seafood. But last few time I visited there the food wasn't up to the standard anymore. Most of the time the sauce was way too oil.   But this captain boil actually taste exactly the same as the captain boil I fell in love with. I am so happy I found this by accident. We were actually there to eat at the Spanish tapas place in the plaza but was disappointed by their customer service level and just came into this captain boil because it close the kitchen way later. When we walked into this captain boil the sever, Augus, greeted us and place us in a booth. We ordered our food and the food comes so quick. And the flavour is up to my standard he checked in with us quite often to make sure we are doing okay. very happy with the experience here."}
{"text":"I never tried some thing like this resturant before but I loved it and would defiantly come back again and even though it was packed the service was quick !"}
{"text":"Got food poisioned and really bad diarrhea after eating here, my friend had the same symptoms and vomited right after she had finished the meal!!! The sizzling plate is not heated at all and the food is rather cold,  we order fire heat but it's mysteriously sweet and not spicy at all, couldn't believe this place's quality went down that badly!!!!"}
{"text":"3.5 STARS  Had a lobster (medium spicy), 1lbs of shrimp (fire spicy), corn, sausage, potatoes, cajun fries, and a bottle of Sapporo.   Lobster was very moist, and perfectly cooked.  The shrimp was great with the lime and pepper they provide.  Fire is very spicy, even for spicy food lovers! It was almost unbearable at first, face numbing, but after a while we got accustomed to it and it was really good.  We got every thing Captains boil flavor, which is a mix of everything, similar to The Boiling Crabs \"The Whole Shabang\" Flavor was great.  Fries were crispy, kind of like KFC/Taco Bell fries with Cajun spice sprinkled on top. They could have better distributed the cajun seasoning by tossing the fries.  On the menu when they say cob they actually mean half a cob, so at $2 half a cob it's a little pricey, but still worth trying.  $10 for a couple thin slices of sausage was too expensive in my opinion, probably won't get this again. Should be around $5 instead.  They did not have crawfish when I went. They should have a better system of telling people what is and what isn't available.  Service was pretty good, they forgot about our garlic bread though. At that point we were so full, so we weren't really upset.  Will be back again to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Came here around 4pm, so there was no wait. But apparently they were already fully booked for dinner and they just opened yesterday!  It's their soft opening, so they are offering 10% off till the end of November.   Service was very tentative, however staff wasn't very knowledgeable of the menu and portions of the items. But hey I guess they just opened so best to give them sometime to get used to everything.   My hubby and I ordered the shrimp, mussels, snow crab and corn. All with the Captain's boil sauce which is similar to the whole sha-bang at the boiling crab in LA (LA had more flavour). We got it all with medium spice level, which was perfect. I dipped everything with the optional lime and salt and pepper for some extra flavour.   I found the shrimp tasted the best cause it absorbed the sauce the best. The corn is a must!  Even if your not a huge seafood fan its a nice experience. Devouring your food served in a plastic bag with no cutlery just a bib and gloves. Great for pictures! FYI, if you have long nails it will definitely poke a hole through your gloves, I went through 2 pairs.   The crawfish wont be available till next week, so we will be back to give that a try!"}
{"text":"Food was good, HOWEVER I came in 2 hours before closing and as soon as I sat down they began to mop the floors and the smell of cleaning products was disturbing. I pointed out that the smell was not helping the appetite, to which she responded ok and continued to mop. No tip for her."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: decent sized spot for a seafood boil restaurant. Went on a Sunday night and my party of 8 waited about 15 mins. Sinks are located in the dining room which is convenient since bathrooms are downstairs   Service: no complaints, knowledgable about menu. Forgot our servers name, petite Asian or islander female, was awesome.   Food: 4 stars. Great flavor, only complaint is that the garlic pieces in the bag were undercooked so it gave it that \"sinus burn\" feeling similar to horseradish and wasabi. And crawfish was priced at 16.99/lb. I'm from SoCal so I'm used to it being 11.99/lb.   Overall. I recommend!"}
{"text":"Seeing as I live in Toronto, seafood boils aren't exactly common so there has been much hype with this place.  As soon as I saw a post on IG, I knew I just HAD to come check it out and I was finally able to with some fellow foodie friends.  This was their second time at Captain's Boil so they knew what to order.    Shrimp - Complete with the head and to those of you who are curious, no they are NOT deveined.  I personally don't mind this at all since I grew up eating shrimps this way.  I'm also one who will suck all the goodness from the head (get your mind out of the gutter people).  Hey man, that's where all the flavor is! Shrimps are cooked to perfection so that they're easy to peel and the meat isn't sticking to the shell. The sizes were also pretty average. I believe we got the Captain's Boil flavour which had a bit of a kick to it.  5/5.  Lobster - If you're going with at least a couple of other people, this is definitely worth getting because it's priced seasonally however if you're looking to splurge for just yourself then I say go for it.  We had this with the Garlic Sauce which is a must if you love garlic.  5/5.  Chicken Wings - Yuh damn right we got chicken wangs! It had a very light coating and was fried to perfection.  Was also just a dry lemon pepper rub which was very simple.  You do have the option to have a dip on the side but we just had it plain. 5/5.  Fries - The wings we got actually came with fries and not just any type of fries, they were like Costco fries.  Though they were plain, they were very good.  So good that my friend who usually skips on carbs pretty much had the entire basket, so yeah.... 5/5.   Potatoes - Just like most boils, you can add some fixings such as potatoes and corn.  My friend just ordered one to have and for me to try.  Was definitely a nice aadd-on to one of our meals.  5/5.  Mussels - What I personally loved about these mussels was that they were big.  Usually the size of the mussel meat itself isn't that big but these certainly were so they were worth the cost.  Plus they were delicious! 5/5.  Clearly with my above ratings, I'd go back here.  Congrats to their success!"}
{"text":"When I came into this restaurant I was a little underwhelmed. The tables are wobbly, the place was crammed and they serve water in a plastic cup. However, all these impressions were shoved aside when the bags of delicious mess came along and the real fun starts. I guess I walked in not expecting anything but it was very fun eating with your hands. The meal is extremely messy and you'll soon see a mountain of carcass pile up in front of you with fragrant garlic chilly oil leaking out of the bags of whatever they serve you.   The Cajun fries is a must get, it was extremely crunchy and fried to perfection. Dip it in the sauce that came with the shrimp/lobster/snow crab that you may have ordered. The quality of the ingredient is not shabby. The mussels are surprisingly fat, the shrimps taste juicy and fresh and the lobster was yummy. Did I mention the Cajun fries ? In addition we ordered a bowl of rice. We rolled it into a ball and dipped in the sauce. That was fun and tasty as well.   Overall I enjoyed my experience there. The fun factor is certainly worth noting. Aside from the positives there are some downs. They are a little strict about the \"whole party must be present\" rule. We were only missing 2 but couldn't get 6 people seated. The place could use some work. It feels like they bought yard tables and stools. Very flimsy. The downs are apparent but the yummy food and experience makes up for the flaws."}
{"text":"Nice place, food was tasty, lobster in boil  was expensive and didn't have much to eat as its small, so always order anything but lobster, great fries and rice, i like the shrimps very much, lobster bisque soup was too thick and only had two pieces of lobster, and I didn't like the taste. A bit different from traditional one"}
{"text":"LOVE the captain boil sauce with fire spicy! I ordered shrimp, snow crab and clam. And all of them are very delicious! I came here lunch and dinner within a same day, lol. Consider it is seafood, the price is reasonable."}
{"text":"The food here was pretty good but nothing special where I would crave this. I actually enjoyed Good Catch more than this place for this kind of food. We ordered the cray fish, crab legs, clams, cajun fries, sweet potatoes fries and seafood fried rice. Cajun fries are always delicious but spicy. However we specifically asked for no spicy for all the food except for the fries because the baby can't eat it and the seafood fried rice was made extremely spicy even for an adult. It was a mistake and I have to give them credit for making a brand new one and for not charging us for the sweet potato fries and giving us a free apple juice (because the baby was crying from the spiciness). The three stars are not for the incident but because for me personally, it's not something I would crave and make me want to come here. I wouldn't not come here ever again but it was more of a one time experience for me."}
{"text":"We went there Friday night and it wasn't too busy. For appetizers we had the Calimari. The main course we ordered Lobster, King crab, Shrimp, Mussels and Cajun Rice. Everything was delicious! I would just go back for the rice. Service was great. Will come again and I love the hours."}
{"text":"Overall experience: 9/10 Food: 8.5/10 Atmosphere: 7.5/10  Service: 8/10  The Captain's Boil is a great place if you're looking for an informal dining experience with friends/family. No, the restaurant doesn't provide plates or cutlery, but it does serve up great food and a fun atmosphere.   We tried almost everything on the menu. Hits of the night were the dungeness crab, lobster and shrimp. The mussels were great, however would not recommend ordering multiple pounds as the taste gets a bit overbearing after a while (as compared to the lighter, sweeter taste of crab). Crawfish is one I would avoid; some friends found it a bit creepy to dig through the little bugger for a tiny piece of meat.   Your whole party needs to be present before they will seat you, and they will only hold the table for 15 minutes.   Some tips: - wear black! (white would be a disaster) - ask for a second set of gloves that you'll switch into halfway through the meal (also expect that your fingers will still get a bit saucey) - before the meal, lay a paper towel on your lap for spillage and easy access - move your drinks to the side of the table so if you are passing food to somebody else, the sauce doesn't drip in...  THE BOTTOM LINE: the no-frills joint provides an informal, fun atmosphere and delicious seafood."}
{"text":"Came here to try their sizzling plates for lunch. The servers were very helpful and friendly. Ordered a sizzling plate with fish and rice, and one with chicken and udon (+$1). Each plate also includes 2 shrimps, 2 mussels, 2 crawfish, and 2 clams. The food arrived in around 15-20 mins, quicker than I expected.   Everything tasted great until I found something in the udon plate. I found a piece of metal mixed in with the udon on the side. I called the server and she was shocked when she saw it. She immediately went into the kitchen to investigate and came out telling me that it was probably from the udon package as I was the first one ordering udon that day. Soon afterwards, the manager came out to apologize and offered to void that udon plate. They also offered me ice cream at the end.   The restaurant itself looked pretty clean, but that incident shocked me and hence the 3 stars. I'm sure this doesn't happen everyday, but it is important that the food is clean and safe for all customers."}
{"text":"Their lunch sizzling plates are priced at $10.99 and they include 2 crawfish, 2 shrimps, 2 mussels, 2 clams, either chicken or fish, and a side of rice or udon (+$1). You can also choose the sauce and level of spicyness. I didn't expect so much variety for only $11!!  However, what I dislike about these plates is that they are extremely oily. At least 0.5 cm of oil at the bottom. I always tell them to use less oil but it's always the same amount. The portions aren't huge, but I can never finish a plate because the oil makes the food very heavy and unappetizing. I understand that the oil helps the food to not stick to the sizzling plate, but I know that even if way less oil is used, the food will not stick.   I also tried the newly launched lobster roll, lobster bisque, and fries combo for $15. The lobster used is very fresh and there are quite a few pieces in the roll! The lobster bisque is just average. Not much lobster taste, more on the watery side. The fries used here is much like the fries sold at Costco's food court! Very crunchy and fresh!!  The service here is excellent! The servers are very friendly and helpful. They always check if you're satisfied and if you need anything else.   2/5 - lunch sizzling plates  4/5 - lobster roll  5/5 - service"}
{"text":"My friends and I were really excited to try this place because it is similar to the Boiling Crab in California. It isn't as great, but close. I ordered a pound of shrimp, rice and two corns. The sauce I got was the mild captain's boil. It was spicier than I expected but it was perfect for me (I constantly needed my water but not enough for me to sweat bullets). The corn is a must if you're a fan, super amazing with the sauce. I also took some of my friends cajun fries and they were delicious. *warning, chicken tenders come with a lot of fries so dont get extra* (my friend had a lot of fries for left overs because she wanted cajun fries so she ordered them on top of the tenders).  With a pound of shrimp,  rice and two corns, it came to a total of $18 (with tip). I was satisfied in terms of fullness.   Only thing I wasn't too fond of was the service. It makes sense that they weren't at their best because they opened 10 days ago but the server wasn't friendly and didn't know their menu well. We eventually got a better server and were happier with him.    I would definitely recommend this place. With better service, I would give this place a solid 5/5."}
{"text":"What the hell happened to this location!? The flavouring is total crap and it's like they have made their money and gave up.   The favour is gone. The hype is dead."}
{"text":"The menu is simple, follow a couple of steps: pick your fish, flavour and spice level.  We tried the oysters, the shrimp, king crab, Cajun fries and then the Cajun fried rice.  You are given plastic gloves, paper plates, plastic cups and plastic cutlery. A bucket arrives for the shells.  The fish comes in clear plastic bags. The fish is steamed and then seasoned. The fish is really delicious. The flavours we chose were spicy and garlic.  Get ready to get dirty eating here!  We enjoyed the food but the plastic plates, cups and cutlery is not my choice. Especially for the prices. Also I didn't like getting our food out of plastic bags."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place to see what the hype is about.  Left extremely disappointed. Went on a Sunday evening with 4 other people, slow service but also they forgot my order and ran out of lobster (but yet I saw it being served to another table...).  Forgetful and slow service, I guess that's what happens to a business when they get too comfortable. The one thing that bothers me the most about this experience though is the WASTE...anyone else cringe at the thought of their garbage? Do they even separate greens from all that plastic? Everything is plastic...think about what that's doing to our environment.   For the cost and experience I would not recommend.  The food is ok, but not something I would try again not recommend."}
{"text":"It's an interesting concept to cook your seafood in bags with various sauces and then eat with your bare hands with gloves on.  Only problem is that their sauces really aren't that great and typically overwhelms the flavour of the seafood itself.  We tried all the seafood choices, and the worst was the crawfish, very little meat and some grit to go with it as well.  Corn was just horrendous.  The shrimps and clams were ok.  Kids seem to like their chicken fingers with fries and fried rice.  Okra and lotus roots were very standard.  The best thing about the evening was that our waitress was fantastic.  We also received 10% off our bill, don't know how long that promotion will last.    Unfortunately it's not a place that the true seafood connoisseur will appreciate and we won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Within a week of their grand opening, The Captain's Boil already has a line up out their door! I came in around 1:30PM to avoid the lunch rush, and was seated pretty quickly.   If you've been to The Boiling Crab in the states, this is something similar. Seafood lovers like myself are given a bib and plastic gloves. All the items on their menu are served in a plastic bag and even their water cups are plastic! They certainly don't need a dishwasher!   I didn't get a chance to try out their lobster, crab or crawfish because they were all sold out, and the crawfish was not yet available. We opted for what was left on the menu: King Crab legs, shrimp and mussels. We paired them all with the Captain's Boil sauce, and just to put it out there, if you can't handle spicy food, go for \"mild\"!   You're given a little container of salt to squeeze some lemon juice in, used as a dip if you'd like the Vietnamese style of eating your seafood. I personally enjoyed eating the shrimp with just the Captain's Boil sauce (mix of garlic, cajun & lemon pepper). The seafood is fresh, and the King Crab was meaty with a sweet tang of freshness!   On the side, we ordered the cajun fries, which I will order one just for myself next time! I'm glad this concept was brought to Toronto, and so close to home! Till the end of the month, they are offering 10% off discount! They accept reservations, and you'll need to make one. Trust me!"}
{"text":"I usually come here for shrimps and mussels with Captian's boil sauce. The sauce was good and spicy. Oysters were amazingly fresh and meaty. Prices are reasonable. $29.99 for a dozen of oysters."}
{"text":"My first time ever being at a captains boil, and it was a lot of fun, great service and delicious food. The server was very knowledgeable about the menu and very pleasant, we drove all the way to Newmarket to try it."}
{"text":"I loved it! I went at lunch so I didn't have to deal with lines.   I love the concept of eating with gloves and that the bibs are all decorated with different outfits.   As for the food, I tried the chicken teriyaki special with a seafood mixture in the captain's boil sauce. The seafood was great and the sauce was really tasty. I thought the chicken teriyaki would be bland, but it ended being really good too."}
{"text":"Been to a few seafood boil places in the U.S. And Canada, Captain's Boil in Newmarket definitely one of the better ones.  I highly recommend you give this place a try!  Keep up the great quality and service Captain's Boil Newmarket."}
{"text":"Up from Boston in the US. Ate here last night and really enjoyed it. Being so much good seafood is available in Boston I was impressed by how good this food was. Cool concept of no utensils and using a bib and gloves. I was skeptical until I had my first bite. The flavor was incredible!! I had muscles and shrimp with a side of Cajun fries.  I would've given 5 stars except it looks rundown a bit by passing by and inside. I also ordered a side of Lotus root because I've never had it... I still haven't because it was left off the order. Prices well at $34 Canadian dollars for it all. I will return next time I'm here."}
{"text":"Long waits. 3x longer than promised.  Didn't order Cajun fries or boiling crab. We did order shrimp and clams. They served us RAW shrimp! See pic below.  Offered us free meal to compensate, then tried to back track and offer 1lb of shrimp free instead. When we called her out, she tried to make us feel guilty by saying she would pay out of her own paycheck.  When we asked to speak to the owner, she told us they were not here, then changed her story to say that they are too busy to see us.   Too busy to see customers who just got served food that was unsafe to eat. I guess they dont care."}
{"text":"Had heard about the place and always had a wait time of 1 hour. Finally got to try it for lunch with my family and was absolutely delicious! The whole experience of eating sea food from bags, while wearing gloves and bibs was fun for the whole family.  I liked the side options of adding corn or okra to the mix.  A must try if you love your seafood."}
{"text":"I had a pleasant experience and Cajun flavor shrimp was delished. Crawfish was small, must be the season I hope. Expect to soend, it comes with the territory if you are eating seafood. May the Yummy be  with you!"}
{"text":"Service seems to be getting worse and worse...  Went twice and both times had a bout of mild to moderate diarrhea. So eat there at your own risk.  Once had a table that allowed me to see into the kitchen...floors were filthy and water everywhere on the floor...clean plates seem to be racked close to said flor"}
{"text":"The concept of the whole thing is really good. A bit messy, so come with clothes that you don't mind getting stained. They do however provide gloves and a bib.  We ordered the mussels, shrimp and crawfish in the captain's boil sauce... it was all good.  SERVICE HOWEVER, could be a lot better. The servers are not attentive at all and I have to wait and ask as well just for them to top up my water. Also, they keep bringing orders to our table that doesn't belong to us. It was so disorganized and a bit annoying.   The food was good. But if the service was better, I could've given 4 stars."}
{"text":"Fun place to be. If you like to get messy. Don't wear white, even though you are provided with a bib, food does fly. I love they have a hand washing sink at the front. The server was attentive and did refill water and ask how everything was during our dining experience. My only issue is most of the items on the menu havé seasonal price stickers.  I think they should inform the customers what the daily pricing is for most of the items or use post it notes to let the customers know. As stated in other reviews, the crawfish was tasty, there wasn't  enough meat so order something else. The crab was delish with the captain's boil seasoning. A little pricey, but a fun experience."}
{"text":"We were excited to eat here, until they delivered the food. The service was really slow. When the food finally arrived, at different times, the lobster was undercooked and they forgot the potatoes. The crab legs lacked seasoning, as did the shrimp and lobster, and the shrimp was not good. The food did not appear to have been cleaned and that was completely unappetizing. We had to ask multiple times for eating utensils, only to once be told they were out of them. The manager came out and apologized. The entire meal was overpriced too! For three people it was more than $160. We planned to take a large group to eat there, but after our experience we changed our minds. Disappointing. I strongly suggest looking for other seafood options rather than eating here."}
{"text":"The service was fast for a busy Saturday night. The staff were friendly and on top of everything. We were seated fast and got our drinks asap. The food was great ."}
{"text":"The Food is sooo delicious!!! Servers are friendly, with great customer service. And higlhy recommended resto to dine in. We're gonna come back again!"}
{"text":"Food is good and service is super fast! I'm not a fan of their Cajun sauce, I actually find it too oily and not too much other flavor. The captains boil sauce is good though!  One star less because I found the price a bit too high. 1 corn add on is 1.25 and its only 1/3 of a corn. I kicked myself for getting it considering I found corn for 15 cents each over the weekend.... :(. I think potato is worth the add on since it's filling and they give you a full potato lol.  We got shrimp and claims with those add ons and had calamari and Cajun fries on the side. A bit too much for 2 people, could've skipped the fries. Came to 60$.  Honestly found it pricey, would've been 50 without fries and that's a pretty expensive meal to not have any left overs.  Overall.... I probably won't be back unless I'm truly craving it. Sauce wise, I find good catch better but captains boil is more conveniently located."}
{"text":"It's an experience. Come prepare to eat messy. Smile and reminisce when you where a kid and ate with your hand. The place gets packed and the best time to come is before 6 so that you don't feel rushed. The Captains choice seasoning was delicious. I ordered it with no spice and I wouldn't recommend it for kids it still has a little kick because they use paprika. Some items are overpriced. Maybe just try the shrimp. Overall, if I come back I would just get shrimp and add 2 corns and potatoes to the bag. Makes a difference when the sides have the seasoning versus you order on the side. You can also order a side of rice and pour some of the sauce on it..."}
{"text":"I come here all the time, it is so much fun to eat. The captains boil sauce is very delicious and I also really enjoyed the garlic as well.  The service is also good. Servers always come by to check up on us and refill our waters. Very friendly staff.  I usually go at night and it can get really busy but I usually make reservations so I don't have to wait long. Overall, I would recommend this place to all seafood lovers!!!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for the traditional, New Orleans-style seafood boil, this place ain't it.  The seafood itself seems hit-or-miss: the mussels are large and plump, the shrimp are also large and meaty, but the crawfish are a little bland and of the frozen variety.  Though to be fair, I recognize we live in Toronto and we don't exactly have access to an abundance of fresh crawfish in the city - the only ones that seem fit for human consumption must be fished out from a store freezer!  But I digress...  Not sure if it was just a mismatch expectations of the meal, but I think the best thing about Captain's Boil is pretty much the Captain's Boil sauce mix flavouring.  Nothing like the Zatarain's stuff of the South, the garlic paste mixed with a bit of lemon and Cajun seasoning is more thick and sweet than the traditional brothy boil.  One of the fun parts kept from the tradition is eating straight off the table with a plastic bib tied around your neck; leaving piles of shells and discards in the aftermath.  With no plates, cutlery, and just a one-size pair of plastic gloves and a roll of paper towels on the table, it's satisfyingly messy.  Tips:  - For a table of two, be prepared to order 2-3 lbs for the table - The corn is pretty good but one order is only half a cob - Don't bother getting the Cajun Cajun sauce, it doesn't hold much flavour - Don't wear silk or white clothing - red sauce splatters are inevitable! - Not a tip, but the sailor-tie bibs are adorbs..."}
{"text":"Food and service is pretty good - but I'm not a big fan of the no utensils and bowls kind of culture here.  You have to eat with your hands (they give u gloves and a bib), and most of the seafood is served in plastic bags (imagine buying raw seafood in a grocery store - those types of clear bags!!).    The captain boil sauce is yummy - but I didn't like the lemony one.  Lobster and New Zealand mussels were slightly over cooked, although flavour is ok.  Prices are relatively high too, although I guess that is expected for eating seafood.  Overall, not somewhere I would crave to come back to, but I would eat here if my friends suggested it again."}
{"text":"WARNING - don't wear white. It's going to get messy!!!   Captain's Boil is something else!  My friend and I came here for an evening meal after work - we were extremely excited to come here after hearing so much about it. What a treat. :)  We ordered the 4 way flavour of: Shrimp, Mussels and Dungeness Crab, Seafood Fried Rice  The only thing I would hold back on is maybe the Rice, I felt like the sauce was what they used to coat the seafood, and that you could save a lot of $$ if you order the plain rice and douse it with the leftover sauce. BUT everything else was absolutely yum.   However, Captains boil can really be a hate or love. For myself, I LOVE peeling things and using my hands to eat, however I know lots of people that aren't too fond of doing that (or frankly, just too LAZY to do it) so this wouldn't necessarily be their cup of tea.   Flavour, ambience, and service was on point.  Check it out if you feel like making a mess!"}
{"text":"Watch out when they price out the King Crab Legs!!  I went for lunch with a friend of mine a few days ago, and part of our order was the King Crab Legs. We ordered 1 lb.   When they came out my friend said, these don't look like a pound to me. It basically was a single leg. We didn't say anything because we couldn't be bothered.  Yesterday, I went to the grocery store and saw a 1.1 lbs bag of king crab legs. Then I said to myself \"we got gypped!\" There was over 4x the amount than what we received.  Now, the food was excellent especially the Captain's Boil sauce.   So I am giving 3 stars not for the food but because we were taken."}
{"text":"I get the concept but unfortunately this didn't work for me.  Way too messy especially when your wearing light clothing.  I felt it was pricey for the amount of seafood you get.  The amount of shrimp in my bag did not seem like a pound to me. And I don't mind shelling them myself but having to remove the heads and legs is a bit much."}
{"text":"Reasonable price for the portion. Tasty (but wow that was a lot of butter)! have fun while eating all the seafood =)"}
{"text":"We had a party of 5 and shared some snow crab legs, mussels, shrimp, cajun fries and cajun seafood fried rice. This came out to about $20/person, food was served quickly in plastic bags and you get a bib and gloves to eat with - definitely need that to help reduce the mess! Food was a bit spicy and getting a side like rice or fries is definitely needed to be full. Overall food was good and an enjoyable experience to just dig in with your hands!"}
{"text":"What an awesome experience! Had their seafood fried rice with mussels and dungeness crab. Wow the flavours are fresh and beautifully collaborated. It's a great experience with no cutlery and only gloves. Word of advice don't order their garlic sauce if you're planning on kissing that night. Cheers!"}
{"text":"The Captain's Boil is a dining experience. Just like Korean BBQ and Hot Pot some work is required, but that's the fun and experience. The seafood is boiled, but nothing is cracked or pealed. Food quality was good, but because everything is covered in sauces its not for seafood connoisseurs. The food boiled in individual plastic bags and dropped on your table. This is a step up from Red Lobster, but don't expect a seafood house.  Recommendations - Don't wear anything fancy, the sauce may get on you - Wear the gloves and bibs, it looks silly but it protects you - Roll up your sleeves before starting - Best meat is in the king crab legs - Stick to the main seafood options, not the sides (fries are good, nice to dip in the left over seafood sauce) - Leave yourself some time to eat, the service is quick but you order as you eat - Stick with Captian's Boil Sauce, or Cajun - Mild to Medium is a safe bet. Hot is quite spicy  Enjoy."}
{"text":"Good for what it is. It's different and is thus worth trying at least once. Just a tiny warning, Medium spicy is very hot, and that's coming from a guy who can eat pretty spicy. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I have been to location twice and I got to say the food is good but it is way too overpriced for WHAT YOU GET. Both times I have been here were weekend nights and there's only one table inside on a Saturday night at this location. Which seems strange when restaurants would be packed on a Saturday night in downtown toronto!  I have ordered the Cajun flavour every time and it is delicious. However, the bag they give you is full of potatoes and corn every time. The bag of clams and shrimp is mostly Cajun sauce and butter and potatoes. In each bag, you will find minimum FOUR POTATOES. Like seriously ?!? I did not pay a hefty price a bag of potatoes and corn. That being said, the shrimp and clams quantity is very little.   They try to fill you up on the potatoes. I came with a friend each time and we aren't full at all by ordering 2 large bags. I'm sure people don't go to a seafood restaurant to eat potatoes. It's quite rediculous how the restaurant will put 4 potatoes in each bag.   The seafood is mediocre and most people just like the sauce that is coated on the seafood. The sauce is good I have to admit. I cannot say the seafood is very fresh as I've had very fresh seafood boils before. The clams was very rubbery and some are very tough to chew.  The Cajun rice and fries were good to go along with all the greasy seafood.   The service is always fast and friendly here. Due to the restaurant having only one table on a Saturday, I feel uncomfortable dining in the restaurant as there's more employees than customers. No one wants a dining experience were the employees are staring at the customers table non stop because they don't have any tables except you.   Overall, food 3/5 Service 4/5"}
{"text":"Now that the seafood boil trend has been going for a while, I feel like I can come here without having to work through the crowds.  Our group came in and we ordered the Captain's Boil, and the two other seasonings with mussels, clams,  and shrimp.  I ordered a fish and chips for myself as well as a side of corn.  First of all, the place is very conscientious of hand washing, with a washing station at the front entrance.  When you go downstairs, the washrooms have a sink inside as well as in the hallway!  Bonus points for that.  Also bonus points for their caesars which use a fresh stick of celery in it.  Food was a bit garlicky for my taste though.  The seafood came nice and hot, but the flavour of the garlic overwhelmed the seafood for me.  When I took the last piece of clam out of the bag, I couldn't taste the freshness of the clam anymore even though I could tell the seafood was fresh.  I was glad I got the fish and chips, which was perfectly fried and had generous portions.  It didn't help that the minced garlic tasted like it came from the industrial sized tubs you can buy in bulk pre minced.  I did use the sauce to dip my cajun fries with though, which is the best application of the sauces.  In short, I think I enjoyed everything about this place except the boiled seafood."}
{"text":"Well it definitely didn't live up to what I expected after seeing the reviews & posts on social media saying to was good.  Decided to have my stepfather's b'day dinner there for a group of 20, didn't realize they didn't offer appetizers only side orders & add on's. Nor did they have a children's menu. Nor did they have sparkling wine, but the red wine-Sandbanks Chardonnay our server suggested was excellent! Okay, where else to continue from....so our guest (older folks) were caught off guard with the presentation of the food being in bags & no plates, styrofoam cups to eat our seafood rice out of (kind of odd). The crawfish was a \"No\", too much work with no real meat reward! The shrimps, chicken slices, seafood rice, chicken wings & garlic bread...Delicious!!! Our waiters were excellent but the overall production of the staff at this restaurant didn't appear experienced within their field of work. There should've been pitchers or glasses of water on the table. When they served the water it was in a plastic cup with a straw...plastic (growing up my mother would say it's a big insult to serve water out of plastic), thought this was so tacky.  B'day aspect for this restaurant...they don't have any. When I called a male person advised they could do ice cream with a candle (but he seemed unsure). Got there & during the b'day celebration it didn't happen...thank god we brought a cake! The singing of \"Happy B'day\" by the waiters was pretty on point! Okay...the good stuff...the billing. Crazy, they advised that they couldn't spilt the bill but could figure out each persons total..this was a mess...forget it...figured it out ourselves but it ended the night on a sour note with some of the guests that required a separate receipt. Just foolish how they have this system.  Overall would I rate this as a 10/10, no, we all said wish we had opted for a buffet...we were still all hungry after leaving. This visit is a full stop...don't think any of us will return, except the b'day Celebrant-my step-father & mother!"}
{"text":"Finally we have a captain boil in Mississauga too.  It's a very big and open restaurant. When we came it was empty.  The server told us to choose where we want to sit. After we waited for the waitress ones she came we  ordered shrimp and a king crab leg, fried rice and corn and a shrimp bucket.  The food came very fast cause. It was nice as always."}
{"text":"Very bad service! I ordered Cajun fries and they ended up not putting it into the system.. Then I asked for it and they gave me a Cajun fried rice... And I'm now still waiting for my Cajun fries"}
{"text":"I wouldn't really get the crawfish because they're really small and hardly have any meat in them. The oysters are great though! The service is a little on the slower side but that's because they don't have a lot of servers."}
{"text":"I'm a huge seafood person and loved this place! Whenever I travel to the US I always end up at The Boiling Crab (exact same concept as captain's boil) and I've always raved about how good it was and hoped that one day we would have one in Toronto and finally we do! Of course I had to try it and loved it! It's definitely comparable to the ones I've been to before and now I'm happy that there's one closer to home!   I went with my family and fiance (who are also big seafood eaters) for dinner on a Saturday. We wanted to do an early dinner around 5pm which I'm glad we did because it got really busy and the place isn't that big. There was a line up starting to form outside around 6pm. We pretty much ordered 1 pound of everything except for lobster and got the mild captain's boil flavour on everything! We also shared one order of their fish and chips which was ok...I've had better. Prices were what we expected so we weren't surprised but it is on the pricier side. And we had no issues with service.   If you love seafood and don't mind working for your food and getting messy then you'll like this place!"}
{"text":"Unique hands-on dining experience that I would definitely recommend trying once!   To see what the hype was about, my friend and I came to The Captain's Boil to try this seafood dining experience. So, this restaurant is known for its seafood served in bags, dining with gloves (provided), and wearing a bib (also provided). I would definitely say it was fun to experience this for the first time. My friend and I ordered the Sunday special (1 lb of 2 of: Shrimp, Mussels, or Clams) and the seafood fried rice. We ordered the mussels and clams in the captain's boil sauce and \"fire\" level of spiciness. *WARNING: The \"FIRE\" level is definitely very spicy!* The seafood, in the sauce and spice, was only okay. The seafood fried rice was also decent - definitely a nice dish to share as it is a large portion and makes for a good complement to all the seafood! I think the price was decent for the portions - a little on the higher side, but would rate it $$ and not $$$.   The only thing that I REALLY liked was the service - the servers are extremely friendly and open to providing recommendations."}
{"text":"Since they increased the price of the lobster from 15$ to 42$ this place is dead.. 7:15 on a wednesday and only 6 other people.  Seafood rice overcooked with a few shrimp and couple if scallops.. Shrimp and crab legs over cooked.. $80 dollar bill to eat out of a plastic bag.. This place will be gone soon"}
{"text":"Absolutely great!  Staff were helpful. Even cut open our crabs for us. The food was Devine. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Amazing first experience. Shrimps were great! Went for the Captain's Bowl sauce - medium spicy heat. It could've been hotter. Garlic bread and Cajun fries were amazing as well."}
{"text":"Man, this place has got something going for it. They are very wise for getting into the seafood fast food game before it has become a mainstream thing, and damn do they do a good job. A very unique dining experience to say the least. You order a main, seasoning, and the sauce you'd like it smothered in. Then, put on your protective gloves as the food comes steaming hot in a plastic bag. Everything was very flavourful, and the cajun fries almost reminded me of tater tots (which is a very good thing). Highly impressed with this unique concept, and I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"It was our first time going to a restaurant like this. Definitely needed an explanation of how it worked, but overall the server helped us out a lot in the beginning. The food didn't take long at all to get to the table. It was delicious, and more than enough food for the two of us.   My only issue was that after we finished eating we had tons of garbage on the table and the server never came back to take it away, or ask if we wanted dessert or the bill. At the end of it, we were happy to just sit and talk to each other but we even waved down another server and got no reaction."}
{"text":"Purchased a Groupon for the family. Garlic beware!! however, each bite gets you going for more oily seafood. It is the sauce that is heavy. Cajun seafood fried rice has a kick to it. recommend order okra and lotus roots as vegetables side extra, as it goes well to cut the grease"}
{"text":"The service that provides is really bad. We waited for half hour and asked several times about the food. It turns out that she didn't even pass the order to the kitchen. The taste is okay but the service really need to be proved!  Just definitely will not go to this restaurant again:("}
{"text":"Wow. Well to start I can see why we were the only table in the restaurant..  we kept it very simple, we ordered snow crab, lobster and sausage with corn and fries. Fries were hot and fresh, the snow crab was hot and very good but when it came time to eat the lobster we opened the bag and not only was the lobster covered in lobster sh*t but there were lumps of orange matter everywhere.... I used my camera flashlight to inspect it and it was lobster eggs all over the bag. Not only tragic but extremely disgusting. It wasn't the waiters fault and I could tell he felt bad and took it off the bill but total meal ruiner."}
{"text":"Another fun and delicious casual seafood restaurant in Toronto.  You will be eating with your hands (with gloves and paper towels) so don't you worry about looking spiffy in front of your date because you need to get down and dirty.   You get to choose the (1) type of seafood, (2) the spices/ taste/ flavour and (3 )the level of spiciness. Dishes are ordered by the pounds. There are also rice dishes where you do not need to use your hands for.   They have liquor licence for beer, soju, sake, etc.   Their seasonings all have garlic so if you are not a garlic fan, beware.   Definitely coming back for more! They have other locations on York Mills in Toronto and newly on Steeles in Markham."}
{"text":"If you are not afraid of salt overload you could give it a try. Had clam and shrimp with captain boil sauce added corn and lotus. It's fun experience to eat with hands and all very messy. So probably not ideal place to take your date. The only thing I remember is how extremely salty everything taste maybe the sizzling plate is better choice."}
{"text":"Staff was great. Super friendly and attentive.   Washroom had no soap, paper towels, didn't flush properly and automatic door didn't work.   My review on the food is probably bias because I'm comparing it to my experience at The Boiling Crab in LA(which was better but kudos to bringing this to Toronto). We ordered clams, mussels, crab, lobster, king crab, Cajun fries and seafood fried rice. We got different sauces (captain boil sauce, butter garlic). I found the sauce to be too strong in garlic taste and too bland in flavour. The fries didn't taste like Cajun fries and the seafood fried rice was whatever.   The should use thicker heavier duty bags to put their seafood in as the shell punctured holes and put a bit more sauce in it.   I'd go back after they've settle in a bit and when they get crawl fish."}
{"text":"Had an amazing night at captains boil. This place just opened up near Yonge/empress. The only downside about the location is paid parking only nearby.  We with a group of 6, reservations required esp when they just opened up. Fairly small restaurant maybe 10-15 tables of 4-6.  The pricing is not too bad, everything comes in a bad. You choose the spice. The corn was amazing, the yam fries were way better than normal Cajun fries.  Lobster was amazing and well worth it only $28 each.  Snow crab legs was also my fav it was on sale too the way I went, I think $18 instead of the listed menu pricing also had a pound of mussels, clams and 2 pounds of shrimps all good fillers.  The fun part is using your hands and making a mess. Bibs and plastic gloves required.  At the end I saw another table get some water and lemon but not sure why mine did not get that to wash up.  We also ordered beers $25 for $5 for premium like corona and Heineken which was a deal.  Id come back for sure!"}
{"text":"If you're seafood lover like me, please don't mind the messy!   Good tasty seafood! I got shrimp (most value thing), snow crab leg (most favourite) with captain's boil (mixed all flavour), and it tastes awesome. You can add some corn into the bag with the seafood so you can get the flavour for the corn. Compares to other locations, good point that they have the bucket to put the seafood shells so you can avoid the messy look on the table as much as possible. ;) the sauce is pretty much the same but feel like a bit less salty (good for someone who complain about how salty the other places are)  About the place, they're new opening still so it's still a bit quite during the day. It's a little smaller than the other locations but give me a cozy feeling and quite nice. 10% off till September 18th.  Strongly recommended to have a group of friends or family to share so you can try different type of seafood for a cheaper bill!  Service is good since everyone is so welcoming and friendly. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"We got here on a Saturday at 7:30pm and the hostess told us it would be about a 45 minute wait for our table of 2 (we were expecting over an hour). But after 20 minutes, I got the text notification that our table was ready! I guess the hype has died down or we lucked out! It was still packed when we went in though. The hostess said that tables of 2 usually get seated much quicker.  We ordered lobster in captain's boil flavour & medium heat, one order of shrimps in garlic & mild heat, and one order of crawfish in cajun & medium heat, and cajun fries. The fries were great and I recommend getting some sort of carb or non-seafood item to eat in between.   The medium heat was not too hot but still had a (big) kick to it. I would've ordered just one thing in medium because your mouth really starts to feel the heat after a bit. My favourite flavour was cajun. The crawfish was a little overrated...it was good but I wouldn't order it again...too little meat for the amount of effort needed to eat it. Shrimps and lobster were delicious.   One thing I would recommend is to not order only items that require effort in taking off the shells. All three of our seafood items took so much effort to get to the meaty goodness, I got full way quicker because I was eating much slower due to the extra effort to take off the shells. I can't wait to try the clams and mussels and dungeness crab next time!   The service was actually really good for us. Again, maybe it wasn't as busy that night. We got our food fairly quickly, like within 10 minutes of ordering. Our server literally filled up our cups of water every single time it was close to being empty (which was more often than not because of the medium heat!)   I would definitely come back here, but only for a special occasion, as it can be pricey (I think...I wouldn't know, I wasn't the one that paid LOL)."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and got the sizzling plate, comes with fried fish and assorted seafood for $10.99, a pretty good deal.  Cajun sauce in mild was delicious.  Instead of 2 crawfish they now give 1 extra of mussel, clam, and shrimp.  Will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"One of the newer Captain's Boil restaurant franchise that serves up hot steamy seafood boil out of bags. Food is pretty consistent throughout their many locations (I've been to the first one on Yonge, Yonge downtown, Scarborough and now Bayview location). We came to this location because a couple of months ago, Groupon had a deal for this location and knowing their quality of food, we obviously bought one. We got 3lbs of mussels, 2lbs clam, 2lbs shrimp, 1lb snow crab, deep fried shrimp, cajun fries and cajun fried rice. Our sauce was of course, Captain's Boil in medium and garlic butter (for mom). Location was easy to find, place was clean and service was great. Only complaint was their other locations had automatic doors/sinks to the washroom which meant that I don't have to rub my oily fingers all over their doors. This location does not have it so I had to leave some marks - sorry!"}
{"text":"Watch out for the cap'n boil runs! LOL. The cost was pretty expensive for what you get. Maybe because we ordered the seasonal lobster and snow crab legs.  In any case, we ordered everything on the menu all with Captain's boil sauce. It's the best sauce out of all of them.   The sauce is pretty good but I think it was a bit oily. For what you pay to what you get, I don't think it was really worth it, but it was still good.  Service was fine and the food was ok. 3.5 stars but rounding down. It's a fun place to go with a bunch of your friends to hangout and eat. Something new everyone can try."}
{"text":"Perhaps it's because it grew up with it, perhaps because Red Lobster was the only other option in the small city I grew up in; I've always had a negative view of western - style seafood. Bland and overcooked isn't how I want to describe a nice dinner with premium ingredients. Luckily, Captain's Boil is none of those things. (Though it comes with the caveat that it may be 'New Orleans' style, which  is mostly creole flavours).  At The Captain's Boil, the premise is actually quite simple, pick your seafood and pick the sauce. 15 minutes later, they drop a plastic bag on your table with your food. You put on your bib and gloves, and chow down. Literally.  As low brow as that sounds, the restaurant is remarkably well thought out. Bibs and gloves are on the table when you arrive, and there's a large sink off to the side, so not every one is trying to cram into the washroom to clean off their sauce covered hands. You can have a beer if you want, but they don't hard sell the liquor. He did give us each a lime and small plastic container of salt that looked like a college bar tequila shot at the beginning of the meal, but it turns out that it was supposed to be for seasoning the seafood.  My only qualms with the food is that the undercooked garlic in the sauce gets quite bitter if you're over indulging  (like I tend to do), and the Creole flavour is not for those who can't handle spice.  All in all, it's great place to eat, and for things like whole prawns and dungeness crab, the price is pretty reasonable. It's not a fancy dinner by any means, but a great place to hang out with a group of friends.  HHHH - four hedgehogs out of five    http://wp.me/p4qTTI-3p"}
{"text":"With fresh beer and seafood and service is really good here as they have an upstairs and a downstairs. I find that this location is usually packed; why not be they're so good. Food portions here go by the pound. This restaurant is a really good location for someone who truly loves to eat seafood. I will definitely be going back in the near future."}
{"text":"The Captain's Boil sauce was tasty, but too greasy. The garlic sauce contained excessive amount of garlic. Are we eating garlic or is it a sauce to flavour the food? Service, mediocre. The seafood quality, average.   My biggest problem was the amount of plastic that was generated as garbage. Please change this, otherwise we will never return. Try and follow a plastic bag in its entire life cycle. You will be dead before it decomposes. Let's be mindful and leave a clean and liveable plant when we are done. No?"}
{"text":"Went on Father's Day and they were out of Dungess crab and chickens slices, me being allergic to seafood immediately became a problem. The service was friendly but slow. The sausage pieces I got were not worth the 6 bucks (portion size and what it was wasn't worth it)"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with my SO and his friends. With a reservation, they don't seat you until majority of your party is there. Despite the hype with the concept of eating saucy seafood in a bag, it was a dismal experience that spiralled downhill when they brought us incorrect orders twice. The staff even questioned amongst themselves how did their colleague whom took our order got it wrong twice.   SO and I shared the clams with garlic sauce and snow crab legs in lemon pepper. I love garlic, but there was an excessive amount of garlic in the garlic sauce and with empty clam shells in the bag, I questioned whether there was equal number of loose clam meat that corresponded to those empty shells. As for the snow crab legs, my SO is pretty good with getting crab leg meat out, but these crab legs weren't having it; too much work to fully enjoy. They are not pre-split and when asked for something to help cut the shell, they give you a dinky scissor-- don't even have proper cracking tool for a seafood restaurant.   The Cajun seafood fried rice was really good and the only saving grace.    It is messy, that is a given and part of the experience. However the gloves they give you don't even protect your hands from the sauce and grease. Might as well forgo the gloves and eat with your bare hands. Wear something you don't mind getting it dirty, the plastic bib provided don't help either.   The copious amount of trash created with your meal... Holy sh*t"}
{"text":"The lobster in garlic sauce and mild is better than captain boil mixed sauce. I like the shrimps basket that comes with Cajun fries. The seafood fried rice is also good but I put some captain boil sauce with it and it becomes better,  otherwise, I think it's a bit dry and not enough taste. There isn't much seafood in the fried rice as well so that's the bad side. The mussels are good and very meaty. I had it with garlic sauce mild and captail boil mixed sauce mild. Both sauces are good with the mussels so it depends on personal preference. Also ordered a pound of clams but I prefer the mussels over the clams. Overall, this place is pretty good and service is acceptable. Make sure to make reservation, otherwise, you may have to line up for table."}
{"text":"Went there before the grand opening, food was great, staff was friendly, overall a great experience"}
{"text":"This place is yummy and the service is nice and friendly. The lunch special is the go to, so much food for a great price. Get the chicken sizzling plate!"}
{"text":"We've always enjoyed Hot N Juicy in US.  We never wanted to line up at the North York location.  Came on a Saturday night and got seated right away.  We ordered 2 lbs of shrimp, a pound of clams and a pound of king crab.  Lotus root as a side in the bag is a nice option.  Shrimp were very good size and so hot out of the bag my fingertips still tingle from the temperature.  We got the captains boil flavoring for all.  Clams were good too not too small.  King crab was tasty but my husband thinks it should have been more than 1 leg.  Very nice dinner out with our baby.  Music wasn't overly loud either."}
{"text":"Amazing!! Really satisfied, the lunch special was fantastic, I can't wait to come back here for dinner!   Best $10 lunch you could have in Newmarket, trust me!!"}
{"text":"A bit overhyped in my opinion :( We went there super early because we didn't want to line up but when we got there it was pretty empty...The decor was cute with ropes hanging and there were cute, different styles of plastic captain bibs laid out on the tables. The waiters attended us quickly but the wait for the food was unexpectedly long...like 40 minutes and they got it wrong the first time.  We ordered the teriyaki fish sizzling plates because it was inexpensive around 11 dollars. It wasn't what we expected because the seafood was already on the plate when served instead of in its plastic bag. The rice was undercooked and the bottom touching the plate was overly crispy. There were many pieces of fried fish which were good but there was no sauce and they turned out to be dry. The crawfish were frustrating because although they look like mini lobsters...there was very little meat and were difficult to dissect. The clams and mussels were delicious and saucy. The shrimps were mediocre. The plate in general wasn't unified because there was barely any of the Captain Boil sauce. We chose mild spiciness but we rarely got any heat at all.  Thinking we ordered a bad item, we decided to get a 1 pound bag of mussels for 11 dollars (plus we really wanted to use our gloves and eat with our hands) with Captains Boil and medium spiciness. It was much much more delicious, hot, spicy, and saucy! There was actually alot...maybe like 20 mussels? We used some of the sauce here for the rice on the plate. My glove got pierced early on tho but using a fork didn't kill the experience.   Will probably come back but will remember to only order bags of mussels and clams !"}
{"text":"We had made reservations here for a group of 8 on a Saturday, and was offered only 5PM or 9PM seating. 9PM worked perfectly for us as it was going to be dinner part 2 anyways ;) Leading up to the night, a friend of mine had mentioned it was an \"experience\" but his main qualm is that while the food was good, he hates eating with his hands. Perfecto - i love eating with my hands!  The servers are patient to explain the concept of the ordering system but there were a few hiccups in getting the order right and our drinks out. once the food came it was a bit difficult not to get dat sawce all up in your face, hair, everything, but made for a good laugh. CLAMS were fat and fresh, and LOBSTER is never a bad idea. regardless of whether the seafood was previously frozen or not, i liked that everything came piping hot, and well-cooked. CAPTAIN'S BOIL sauce was deliciously buttery and they are not shy with the heat. mild gives you a faint hint of tingle, but medium starts numbing your lips a little -- even for those of us who enjoy heat, we were a-ok at capping it at medium. once you go el capitano, there's no going back. any of the other sauces then tasted far less flavourful and you just wish you had opted for the trio sauce because you may or may not use your shells as a scoop and luge for extra sauce pooling in the bags...  CORN ON THE COB gives you a nice reprieve from the intense flavours, but we didn't have stomach-space for anything more.  Not sure what the upstairs is like, but I'd avoid being seated downstairs, if possible. Lighting is a bit dimmer, and as there are only a couple of tables outside of the washrooms you don't get the same bustling ambiance.  I agree with the previous comment re: eco-friendliness of this place, particularly as the shells don't get composted and all waste is rolled up in the paper tablecloth and thrown straight into the trash. Looking forward to see how they might change this in the future."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb. Im not the biggest seafood fan, but this place has opened up my views on seafood. The seasoning is on point. If you are a fan of savoury foods, this is the place that will satisfy your cravings. We normally do the shrimp and mussels because they're the meatiest and you get a bang for your buck. We also do the \"captains boil\" seasoning medium spice. It has a real kick :) ps, go for Cajun fries!!! Also, service is great. Especially the downtown one. I recommend going during the weekdays or afternoons where it's not super busy. But if you do go at peak times, make sure you have a party of 6 or more or else they won't accept reservations. I made that mistake once and had to wait 2 hours to be seated. But it's okay, the food was yummy, will go there again tomorrow. Happy yummaroo"}
{"text":"Meh.  *******  PROS:  Decent prices  Food was okay  CONS:  Server could split the bill by total but not by items  Serves fish and chips but doesn't have malt vinegar   Serves chicken fingers and fries but  doesn't have plum sauce   Loud, obnoxious music  ************  I probably won't go back. The server told me they had been open for about five weeks, but they still didn't have their shit together."}
{"text":"Really straight forward menu! I wouldn't go for the chicken as for the lunch special but rather the fish teriyaki. It absorbs a lot of flavor and you get assorted seafood right up til 4pm. 2 mussels, 2 clams, 2 shrimp, and 2 crawfish. I'm super addicted to the sauce!"}
{"text":"omg what a great experience  from the bibs to the seafood served in clear plastic bags full of sauce.   we ordered a lot of food, the mussels in the caption boil sayce was my favourite. it was the best value and the best flavour.   the king crab was expensice and a lot of work to eat. i also did the captain boil sauce and i feel like it over powered the crab. i would do just garlic sauce next time. however i probably wouldnt order it again due to the high cost.   the shrimp was ok. very easy to peel and also very good value. but my fav was the mussels.  my husband isnt a seafood guy, so he ordered fish and chips which came with the cajun fries. i read a lot of reviews raving about the fries but i wasnt blown away by them either and it might be because i was so enthrolled with the mussels. as for the battered fish, i wasnt impressed because it didnt taste fresh and i didnt love the batter. i prefer a more flaky beer batter with icelandic fish. stick to the seafood at this place and you will not be dissapointed!  my son had the chicken fingers and (regular) fries and it was excellent! great big pieces of battered chicken and the fries were well liked by my four year old.  it was a large portion and good value."}
{"text":"It's a busy restaurant. You order the seafood and choose the sauce, later on you'll be served in a table with apron. Seafood is contained in plastic bag, you'll have to ask for the shell fracker and napkins, etc. The taste is actually quite good, I really like the sauces, however it's not too filling only eating lobster/King crab(which are what I ordered), u may need some sides but they only have fries. Service is okay, up to standard and you can always get a server, totally understandable in a busy restaurant! Just a bit expensive, a new style of dining I'd say."}
{"text":"This is our favourite location to go to! We initially went to the one in North York but found this location and were thrilled as it's closer to home. We haven't tried the location near Pacific Mall yet though. The service was great, food was fast, and the food is delicious! If you're a seafood lover you'll definitely enjoy Captain's Boil. The sauces were difficult to differentiate but the deep fried shrimp tempura was amazing, and so were the Cajun fries. The chicken was very tender, and the shrimp and mussels were delicious. Although a bit pricey, good for special occasions."}
{"text":"Went to this location a few times. I was able to order a glass of Chardonnay with my meal. I prefer seafood with wine and not pop, beer or water. My most recent visit  Feb 2, I was told wine is no longer on the drink menu. This was very disappointing. The food is excellent but to eat oysters without wine is unheard of. Put wine back on the menu or offer customers the option to bring their own. Not a good way to keep customers."}
{"text":"We were there Thursday night 8:15, and we did not have seats until around 9. We ordered crawfish, clams and snow crab legs with lotus roots on side. The other three were fine. The crawfish is so bad. I understand that they are not fresh fresh. They definitely are using those frozen ones. But i was expecting something edible. But it was just so bad. It has watery mouth feeling, the meat is too bad that taste like paper. We had captains boil sauce medium spicy. I really dont like the sauce. Its too greasy and lack of flavor.  Other than the food, the staff are fine. They just forgot to offer us tissues or any tools for cracking the legs. And yea its unreasonable pricey. After that we went to Mc next door to fill our stomach."}
{"text":"I had the $9 lunch special: sizzling chicken and a side of seafood. A few pieces of chicken, rice in the middle, a bit of corn, all on top of a hot sizzling plate drenched in oil. Then it gets all drenched in teriyaki sauce. It was way too oily and not very flavorful.  The bag of seafood soaked in sauces as alright. I'd say this place is only worth it if you come during lunch hours and get a special. I saw their dinner prices and it was way overpriced for the quality you get."}
{"text":"I've been to other farther locations and discovered that this one opened up near me so I had to go. For those of you who are new, you are provided  a pair of gloves and a bib per person because it can get a little messy here! :D lol The service was pretty mediocre. Went with a couple friends and ordered Cajun seafood fried rice, was a bit disappointed though because it was super dry but it was the only problem we had. I usually get muscles and shrimp and highly recommend getting Captains Boil flavour because it's all the seasonings in one and tastes amazing! If you're a sweet tooth like me get the yam fries! :) I wouldn't recommend getting crawfish because unfortunately, there is barely any filling in there. Overall, this is a good place to go to if you love seafood."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant with a few friends as it is relatively new. We were excited to try the food and loved the concept. Unfortunately, the service was not good at all. Servers were not stopping by to help with our orders or provide service...  The food was slow to be made and they forgot one of my friend's order. They didn't stop by for us to let them know for a long time. Overall, the food was not bad, but this place has some work to do still to improve the service."}
{"text":"The Captain's Boil is exactly what you would expect from a chain seafood resto. The food was at expectation, and service fast enough.   However, issues like service staff spilling hot sauce from the bag on my friend and not even helping to clean it, or offering his meal on the house is a no no. I get that it's a chain, but human decency people!  I liked the crawfish with the house sauce, though the crawfish are not as fresh as they should be, but it is Toronto so what can you expect. Sides were mediocre, beer selection small."}
{"text":"Excellent service, good food, and nice ambience and decor. We definitely will come back to this place!!"}
{"text":"my worst lunch experience in years. Arrived at the restaurant at 11:20am and it was locked. sign on the door said they open at 11am. As I was walking away an employee pulled up in a car and unlocked the door and like a fool I went in. I started with a lobster bisque that had no resemblance to lobster bisque. It was a starchy gumbo with about a 1/4 oz of shredded canned lobster meat floating on top. My main course arrived before I had time to have 2 spoonfuls of soup. I ordered the fish teriyaki. What I got was about 6 bite size pieces of breaded fish with no teriyaki glaze or sauce to be found. The food was hot and the rice was ok but bisque that is really gumbo and teriyaki fish without teriyaki sauce is unacceptable.I doubt this place will still be in business in 6 months"}
{"text":"Nice place to eat. Even though the place can do away with having some plates and silverware but hey want to stick with their custom idea of eating in bags on the table with hands.  Nice seafood experience."}
{"text":"This is definitely the first of its kind in Toronto, and hence hard to compare on the Toronto standard. I think if I was in California, I would probably rate this place 3 stars. I do like how they give gloves, and a whole paper towel roll. I had ordered snow crab and clams, but they forgot my clams and when I asked them to cancel the clams they ended up bringing them 40 minutes later, so they went straight to take out. I found the wait staff should take more initiative to check everything is okay, I had to almost hunt down staff that would pay attention to me. If I am making eye contact with you, it means I need something, not because I like to look at you. Eventually when I got the wait staff's attention they would forget about it. It seems to me like the wait staff got hired because its a friend owned restaurant, not because they actually want to be there.   I do like the sauce marinade, just look out for garlic breath the rest of the night! I found the seafood rice to be too buttery tasting for my preference, but my friends seemed to like it. I will be warming up my clams today, hopefully they taste as good leftover as they should be fresh! My friends said their mussels were pretty tough, and I am not a fan of shrimp I have to peel. Overall I think the pricing is very reasonable, except for the corn which is 1 dollar for a third of a section. I will probably be back again to take my family to experience their first seafood boil, but I hope as their restaurant matures so does their service :)"}
{"text":"Few locations have opened up in Toronto recently, I visited the North York location at yonge and church. There is often a long line around dinner time but otherwise fairly easy to get a table. This location has seating up stair as well I believe. The offer New Orleans crawfish boil style meals. We tried the crawfish, shrimps, oysters along with a couple of corn cobs and potatoes. We flavoured everything with the captains boil and it was really good but really messy. The crawfish is not really worth the price, it's a very small amount of meat for a lot of work and because it's not common in this area it's pricey. Found great value in the more common seafood dishes and the corn on the cob was really buttery and flavourful. Don't waste money on the potatoes as they just cut a boiled potato in half and throw it in the bag."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday evening at around 8pm.  Pros  - Good tasting food - Good portions for the price    Cons - Slow service"}
{"text":"For the price that u am paying, I would expect they clean out the poop from the shrimps. However that is not the case. It is also impossible for me to take it out myself after it's cooked. The flavour was just ok."}
{"text":"super fast service. Food was good, too. Captain's sauce with mussel was the best. Side of corn with butter was yammy, too."}
{"text":"Excellent service. I'd recommend garlic sauce if you want to keep the original taste of seafoods. Must try their whole lobster with the captain's boil sauce. If you go with a group, you could order sausages and Cajun Fries to share. I like the clams and mussels too.  There are three green parking nearby. I was so lucky to find a free parking spot in the neighborhood, but two hours limit.  New location is beside famous Hollywood Gelato. Pretty a good idea to have a scope afterwards."}
{"text":"Love this place! I usually come here when I'm craving some seafood. Just don't go here for a first date. Haha unless you're super comfortable eating in gloves in front your significant other.   I always order the shrimp with Cajun fries. Just amazing! I double glove so the smell doesn't get to my hands after. Messy to eat but oh so delicious!   This place is very accommodating as well. There are days when I can't eat the whole pound so I split it with a friend which is very nice of them do.   Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this new place out!! Captains Boil! I am a seafood lover and especially shellfish. I came here with foir other friends so we could try different shellfish and such. We ordered the King crab legs, clams, crawfish, mussels, lobster, Dungeness crab and we all had it in a mild Captains boil base, we also added okras, corn, lotus roots and corn with garlic bread, fries and chicken tenders. This was a very good meal the boil base tasted excellent with just enough flavour. The shellfish was served fresh and not frozen. It's a messy dinner and everything is served from a plastic bag. I strongly suggest you wear the bibs thats offered. There is also a hand washing station near the back of the restaurant. This place gets crowded and expect your bill to be on the high side. Everything is add on cost. Your bill can easily be racked up to $60-85/person. When i went there were no land lover options, other then chicken tenders. I notice now they offer teriyaki chicken. Which is great. This is a great place to try a different twist in seafood. Not as close as true seafood boils. I have had in the Louisana, but it was a interesting take with a northern twist."}
{"text":"I had a terrible experience at this location, the waiter and some random dude who I assume was the supervisor refused me when I asked for my sauce on the side of my meal then they still charged me an extra $2.00 for putting it with my corn, saying it's some special recipe as if I was trying to steal Mr. crabs crabby patties recipe.   There food is bland, the captain boil sauce had excess oil in it, you couldn't even taste anything, I lost my appetite once the \"supervisor\" started talking and I told him cancel my order, \"I didn't like his tone of voice with me\" he refused to.   Very unprofessional, wannabes! And the waitress had no clue about anything, do they not get trained???  I ended up getting sick from the food, God knows what he did to it.   I told all my friends and family to never go to this location! They give Captain Boil a horrible reputation."}
{"text":"I have been going here once a week lately. I have overcome the messy hands and started really enjoying their food. I love the value of their sizzling plate combo with spicy captain's boil sauce (not available after 4pm). I tried both fish and chicken and loved them both. The harmony between butter and Captain's boil sauce is very addictive. I also love their mussels in garlic sauce. Great place for friends gathering. But somehow every time I go I feel like I'm at a eating battle so focused on eating."}
{"text":"What's not to like about seafood in a bag mixed with flavourful sauce? I believe this concept originated on the west coast and finally made its way to Toronto a while back. I've tried two of the Captain's Boil locations and had similar experiences in each. Be prepared to wait a while (unless the hype has died down by now...) - I think the longest I've waited was almost an hour before finally being seated, sigh.  I would recommend getting the shrimp and clams for the most flavour. I've tried the crawfish and the king crab legs as well but for the price you really don't get that much meat. Also recommend the Captain's Boil sauce for everything, which is basically a mix of all of the other sauces! The side of corn is pretty good as it's soaked in the sauce and the cajun fries are decent.  3 stars mostly because it still doesn't compare to the one I had in LA, and for what you're getting it is slightly overpriced."}
{"text":"This brought back some memories of a place I visited in Las Vegas.... Hot and spicy crawfish. Although not as good, the food and service were both great. Price was reasonable and would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Incredible experience!  The fish was so fresh, perfectly seasoned & cooked, we had a fun & enjoyable night out, at an affordable price too We'll definitely return! Kudos to the chefs and staff for making dining out what it should be! These days it's hard to find a restaurant that has such great food & service, we loved it here!"}
{"text":"Went with my family for lunch. The server was uninformed and clueless about the menu. Simple requests honored at other locations were not honored here. Will take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"I live 5 minutes away.  So I went there alone at 6pm to ask for a table of 4.  Then went home and took a nap before going to pick up my friends and arrive 2 hrs later.  We still had to hang out next door at Hmart for 30 more minutes.   So now we get seated.  The table is simple, just a paper sheet ready to be cleaned away.  I look to the table next to me and quickly realize, the food is served in plastic bags and you basically eat with your hands, with a big offering of plastic gloves and napkins for you to burn through.   Theres really not much point to letting you pick sauces when the captains sauce is just a mix of the 3.  That being said, I think there's a bit too much garlic in the sauces.  So maybe they should have a 30%, 50%, 70% choice to garlic like how bbt places do it lol...  The lobster was really well cooked.   The crab was nice too but the price of ONE leg is just ridiculous.  Mussels were ok,  can't go wrong but honestly tooooo much garlic....  clams were ok.  Is kinda nice to just dig in with your hands, makes for a different and fun experience.  Just a bit too pricey to want to come again.  I like cooking, so I'll probably make my own seafood instead.  That being said...still a good job overall.  I was with good company, so that always makes it more enjoyable.  If you plan to go, get one of the ppl on your group to go ask for a spot before you all go there and wait for 2 hrs+ together in the cold lol..."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant before and ordered the sampler. We substituted out the crawfish for chicken. Or you can make your own platter. Step 1 choose your fish, lobster, shrimp, mussels or crawfish. Step 2 choose 1 of 4 flavours. Step 3 is choose your heat. And it ranges from non spicy to fire. Then step 4 is your add ons which are fries, rice, etc. Menu is limited. The waitress is helpful and helpful. Food came right away and was delicious. I recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Toronto's first seafood boil chain with a Vietnamese twist.  It gets messy but it's fun and delicious. Definitely worth a try.   The downtown location is the newer, second location of this trendy new restaurant. I've been to both, and they're both identical in terms of menu, service and food quality. I was pleasantly surprised by how tasty everything is. Captain's boil sauce is really good, and is really the only choice. I don't like things too spicy, so I opted for the mild spice level, which already has a slight kick to it, and was the perfect amount of spice for me. The lime and salt combination that they give you to compliment the seafood really shows the Vietnamese influence.   Stick to shrimp and mussels at this place! The snowcrab and lobster is expensive and not worth it. The shell for lobster and snowcrab legs are too thick for the flavour to truly soak into the meat anyways. Personally, I feel like that it's a money grab. The shrimp, mussels and even clams are amazing. (I'm a little hesitant to recommend clams because there's a lot of of empty shells in them but they're very tasty)   Two pounds of shrimp is a surprisingly large amount of shrimp. I recommend 2 pounds of shrimp/mussels per person with a side of cajun fries. Oh and make sure to add corn to your meal! Corn soaked in captain's boil sauce is amazing.   The gloves they give you are helpful, but aren't 100% protective. They easily ripped from the sharp edges of the shrimp shells. Again, this meal is MESSY, so if you're going out somewhere after, be warned. Service is a little slow, and the servers can get confused with all of the different orders, but that's only to be expected as I came in a party of 16 people and everyone got different orders in various mixtures of pounds, sides and spice levels.   They're very picky on reservations. If you said table of 8 for 7:00pm, you have to show up with at least 7 people for them to seat you. I remember an incident at the North York location where they wouldn't seat a party of 6 because their resos said party of 8. Be punctual!  Strongly recommended to come here to try at least once. It's a great experience."}
{"text":"Place was nice and cozy, good music. Service was relatively fast, not much people on a Saturday night surprisingly (around 9pm).   Recommendation: Get the LEMON PEPPER seasoning!   We got 2lbs Clams (lemon pepper) and 2lbs Mussels (garlic). Are the clams first, delish! A little small and most of them were out of the shells themselves. Mussels, tasted bland, so we ended up transferring them to the lemon pepper bag lol. Much better!  2 people, 2lbs of 2 \"catches\", after having calamari to start and Cajun fries, a bit much so we took some mussels home. It was a good seafood dinner though"}
{"text":"Came here 3 times, once during the week for dinner, once for lunch and once with a large group of my co-workers During the week in the evening it can get pretty busy, service was horrible with the large group but they offered us 10% off and fries on the house which was great.  Food wise, flavour is amazing!!! Staff there suggest 3-4 lbs. per person which I think is crazy and I am a big eater. I would say 1 lb. per person is good enough. The lunch special is great if its your first time cause you get to sample the seafood and its a huge portion on a sizzling plate. The best combo in my opinion is for sure mild w/ captain's boil sauce on mussels, I add corn to my bag and get their cajun fries. The fries have quite a kick to it but if you ask they have plain fries too. They are huge and flavourful, shrimp is good but a lot more work to clean. Other seafood items can get a bit pricey. Overall good food and a fun experience eating with bibs and gloves. My co-workers said this was the best place we ever went for lunch!  *If its your first time here: Get the cajun fries, one lb. of mussels with mild/captain's boil sauce"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of seafood and so I decided to check it out for my birthday! We ordered the Dungeness crab, snow crab, seafood fried rice and sweet potato fries. We ordered the seafood with the captain's boil sauce medium hot and it was very good but could use more spice for sure. The rice was really good and the fries were not bad. Otherwise, the service was okay. Our waitress seemed pretty shy and forgot to bring us some things we asked for but she was nice. Maybe just new? The one thing that was a little weird about this place is that there was no real cutlery, plates or cups; everything was disposable. I understand the seafood comes in a bag because that is what they steam it in but styrofoam bowls and plastic forks? I felt like I was back at a frat party drinking my beer out of a plastic cup lol. My parents were a little horrified at first about that but when we tasted the food, we left happy!  Overall great food, okay service and decent prices but get some real flatware and dishes. Would definitely go again for the food but don't expect fine dining!"}
{"text":"Came here on a busy weekday afternoon and luckily they had a spot for 2. We ordered crawfish, mussel, crab legs, shrimp and cajun fries. They were all pretty good with the mild captain boil sauce.   My only gripes were that the Alaskan king crab legs were real expensive just for one.   It is a messy experience but it was very enjoyable. Your bill will be hefty but it's seafood so what can you expect than a premium for this type of food. You should expect a long wait if you go with more than 2 people."}
{"text":"Had a good lunch with their lunch special and added an order of a pound of shrimp with captain's boil sauce. Very satisfied. But i prefer the service at their new location in sheppard brimley."}
{"text":"Came here with my brother last week for their lunch special and a pound of shrimps and mussels with their captains boil sauce and it was amazing! The service is very neat and fast. Also the atmosphere of the place is very welcoming. It was a good thing they opened a new location much closer to my dads. Thanks for the good service!"}
{"text":"I'm not usually in the habit of eating my food out of clear garbage bags, but in the case of Captain's Boil I make the exception.  We ordered the mussels, shrimp, crayfish, snow crab, Cajun fries and Cajun seafood fried rice (yes we pigged out) with the especially tasty signature Captain's Boil flavour in a medium spice. All were delicious, the crawfish being my least favourite. If you are more than willing to put the work in to getting a measly piece of tail meat and some brain be my guest.   *update*  Went for a second time and still pretty tasty. Service was great and I've got my order for 2 down to a T. An order of shrimp with the lemon pepper flavour with mild spice, mussel and snow crab both with the Captain's Boil flavour with  medium spice and the Cajun seafood fried rice. If you like spice and can handle spice go for medium,  but even for me it was nice to have a milder subtle flavour like the lemon pepper for a change of scenery or everything seems to taste the same.   All in all,  a great place to quell any seafood cravings."}
{"text":"This place was so overpriced. You are literally paying 50 bucks for oily seafood in a plastic bag. The good had no flavor what so ever. We also had the same seafood rice that taste old. The rice was hard. I need to warn you not to waste your money here."}
{"text":"Barbarians everywhere! Eating with their hands ... piles and piles of scaled  shrimp covered with sauce that can only be described as Cheeto coloured. Despite all this and the blaring 90s pop meets dubstep soundtrack ( who thought of this?), Despite all this... the food is pretty decent. $12 will get you a lb of shrimp , $1 a piece of corn to go with it. The sauces come in a variety including captains boil (a mix of Cajun, garlic and one other). My girlfriend and I got a pound of shrimp and pound of mussels. She was a big fan of the mussels... I was not. The shrimp were good but you had to take off both the head and tail. (apparently some people just eat the heads! Yum)   Everything ended up tasting like the hot Captain's Boil sauce we got it in. I don't know if I would order the crab here because it would just end up tasting like the sauce. You also get super messy."}
{"text":"I didn't know what to expect but it was a good experience. Food is really flavourful and the service was really great. If you have a beard you might want to reconsider."}
{"text":"Finally tried Captains Boil, and it didn't really live up to all the hype. I think it's more of a novelty experience rather than good fresh food.   Service was just ok, our server disappeared and others had to look after us....  No plates or proper cutlery is provided here, you do however get a bib and plastic gloves yay...   Started with the oysters, wish I hadn't..   Mussels were over cooked, but the captains boil seasoning was tasty.   Had the King crab in the garlic butter sauce. There was way too much garlic in that sauce, and the butter was very liquidy.. Garlic tasted like the bottled stuff and not very fresh and completely overwhelmed the dish. I love garlic but this was just too much..   Crawfish was ok, hardly any meat as they were small little guys.   Wouldn't go back as i think seafood deserves better.."}
{"text":"Came here on Monday for lunch with the family. We did not have to wait, which was expected. Who eats this heavily for lunch except my family?! I have been to a similar restaurant like this in Jersey City, NJ called Just BeClaws, of which I am a big fan. So I was excited to try this, expecting to like this place just as much.   Upon entering, the place looks modern and new. We were seated at a booth. Each person was given super large plastic gloves and bibs to eat with. We ordered 1 lb of King Crab (captain's boil sauce), 1 lb of mussels (Captain's boil sauce) and 1 lobster (garlic sauce), fried shrimp with cajun fries, and chicken teriyaki rice. While everything was very tasty, I do have a couple complaints.   Firstly, we asked for no spice, I feel that the server should have informed us that the Captain's Boil sauce itself was intrinsically mildly spicy itself. While I like some kick in my food, my parents and my brother cannot handle much spice. Secondly, they did not give us proper tools to eat our food with. I understand we are suppose to eat with our hands. but it is extremely difficult to eat King Crab and Lobster without scissors and lobster crackers. The other restaurant I went to provided each person with their own scissors, lobster crackers and tiny forks to pick at the lobsters and crabs. Do they expect us to bite the shell open with our teeth? I'm a dentist by profession, and I would strongly recommend against that. Thirdly, the price! How is 1 lb of King Crab 1 crab leg? that seems a little ridiculous. Perhaps they added the sauce and the plastic bag into the weighting. There is definitely something off!  Seriously $34.95 for 1 crab leg? I know when I ordered 1 lb of King Crab at Just BeClaws, there were at least 4 separate legs. Lastly, I think it would be a good idea for them to have a bucket for each table to place the shells. It would just make eating a lot cleaner, and you do not accidentally pick up something you have already eaten.  Despite all that, this is a fun place to eat. The Captain's Boil sauce is definitely delicious. However, I would not come back on a regular basis.  Maybe something fun to eat once in awhile for the experience.  Food 4/5 Service 2/5 Decor 5/5 Value 1/5"}
{"text":"Quiet an experience. The service was okay, friendly but not thorough; it's understandable as this place was very busy. The food was just as expected. We ordered the shrimps, mussels, crawfish, corn and fries. Order crawfish only if you are a fan of crawfish cause shelling is not very fun. And I probably won't recommend corn as you will only get like 1/3 of an ear for 1$. Good experience but probably don't worth to go back again."}
{"text":"Nice taste and fresh way for eating seafood. Clams are the must order. Fire is just right spicy. I'd also recommend corn, by side."}
{"text":"I didn't actually go into the restaurant but I ordered from here on Uber eats and I must say one of the best seafood I've ever eaten! Will definitely be checking out the actual joint asap"}
{"text":"Went on a saturday night no waiting . Great Customer service, loved the scenery. Now on to the most important part FOOD . Hated the cajun fries, loved the plain fries . Loved the plain wings , corn and sausages. I ordered the crawfish with corn and sausage. I Love crawfish but I found the boil sauce a bit too greasy and I didnt like  that garlicky smell it was a bit overwhelming for me and I love garlic maybe it was their particular recipe who knows.  Ask for an extra pair of gloves you definetly want to double up. Hopefully they change to non latex rubber gloves one day so much easier. They clearly dont give  you a pound of crab legs Ive gotten more at the groccery store and found that 35.00 price tag outrageous Never  ordering that AGAIN. Overall  Im glad I finally went and got to experience this fun way of eating."}
{"text":"Very overpriced for such a simple recipe. Server was rude and forgot to include scallops in our order. She insisted it was at the bottom of the bag. Unless they were microscopic sized, we didnt see any."}
{"text":"So I went to this place twice in a span of two weeks, that was my first mistake. I will start by saying it is definitely an experience that even with this rating I recommend you try out once. What I struggled with a bit here was what/how to order, lots of options plush seasoning combos to choose from and with only 2 people you cant try everything.  For me, what I really liked was the mussels and the shrimp. The crawfish were way too much work, the clams were just so-so and the sausage add-in totally not worth it. The other thing that was odd was the pricing for the corn/potatoes in relation to the quantity. They are both about 2 bucks but you get a full potato versus like a third of a corn cob....doesnt make sense at all.  In terms of sauces, the captains boil is good mixing them all. I would not do just the garlic but instead go with Cajun as a standalone option.  Side note: Our waitress literally said \"Our fries are better than Costco's\" which was by far the strangest common I have gotten at a restaurant. I have never had Costco fries but no matter how good they may be I would not be comparing my restaurant fries to them!!!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of boils! With that said, this place hit the spot. My group of 7 lucked out and got seated immediately upon walking in. I literally tried EVERYTHING on that menu.  Every seafood choice they offered down to their rice plates, down to the steamed okra. The only ones that stood out to me were the mussels and shrimp.  Even then, everything seemed too buttery and after a few minutes,  the sauce started clumping/coagulating.  The crab legs, clams, and mussels were tasty,  don't get me wrong.  Ultimately,  I left 100$ broker and it wasn't a memorable boil for me.  I would come again given the opportunity though."}
{"text":"We've been loyal regulars at this location since it opened last year but we've noticed over the last few months the quality of the food has declined bit by bit.  When we came in the new year, a few changes - Prices have increased; chicken tenders for our kids are now $9.95 which is pricey for what you get as well as the quality (3 small to medium sized chicken fingers) and fries were overcooked and some parts of the chicken fingers were so dried out and old that my children weren't able to chew them and spit them out. When you look in the inside, the meat looked dried out and there were gaps in the middle between the meat.  - Price of sides (we normally order Lotus Root) has also increased by about 20% as well - Lunch special for 8.95 is now gone, so it's 10.95 for the chicken teriyaki sizzling plate during lunch hour - I think the seasoning has also been adjusted; we used to order the Mild which was just a teensy bit too spicy for us. Now it's less spicy but it's also much less flavourful and the meal as compared to all of our other ones, were bland. Chicken and clams were overcooked. - Service has declined significantly although we were the only ones eating in the restaurant. The server did not come even once to check on our food, refill water or help clear dishes. We had to waive down the server to get our bill.   Too bad - really used to enjoy this but with the price increases, significant decrease in food quality (the decrease in service I can live with), this one's falling off our rotation!"}
{"text":"There is such a thing as eating TOO MUCH SHRIMP.    3.5 for the Boil.   You order your preference of seafood by the pound - choose from mussels, clams, shrimp, crab, crawfish.  They also have a selection of sauces to choose from and you can adjust your spice level accordingly.  I would only recommend the crawfish if it's your first time and you've wanted to try it before. Be warned it's way too much effort for very little reward.  The shrimp in lemon pepper and Cajun sauce were fresh and very flavourful, hence the seafood binging that ensued. Their sides are pretty basic as well, corn, boiled potato, fries, garlic bread (I'm pretty sure it's from Costco).    Service was okay, I wish they'd have given us a little more time to mull over the seafood options. However, the staff was really attentive throughout the night.  It's an interesting experience eating with gloved hands and a bib. I really enjoyed it because it's different and fun.   We ended up ordering 3 pounds of seafood, with a few sides and drinks for $60 so not a bad value overall."}
{"text":"A very nice restaurant. Easy parking, we found the parking space right besides the restaurant. Nice staff?our server is very friendly and take good care of our table. And the fantastic part, the seafood is so fresh and delicious with different sauce. The snow crab and clam you definitely won't miss. I also like the side vegetable such as lotus root which is healthy and yummy. A pleasant visiting and I will come back from time to time."}
{"text":"I am not too sure what the hype is about. There was a long waiting line which took me about an hour and half. Experience was alright and interesting as many of you have heard by now, you use your hands to eat with gloves on. Menus are basically seafood which I love but I prefer using utensils. I'd suggest to avoid this location for a first date kind of thing. But other than that, it was interesting and kind of fun. As for the flavour, it definitely has flavour but beware of having a good garlic scent both in your mouth and on your hands even after washing them afterwards.  If you don't mind getting down and messy with seafood then this is definitely the place for you."}
{"text":"Got the Cajun Lobster. Very flavorful. My friend got the crawfish, which had very little meat and seemed very difficult to open up to eat. Good services. Some things like extra corn ($1 for like 1/3 of a corn?) seemed a bit expensive.  Quality: 8/10. Services: 7/10. Value: 6/10. Overall: 7/10 (Not an average)."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday evening. Was told they dont reservations for 4, but didn't have to wait very long (15 mins). Ordered the cajun fries, corn, the lobster (my fav!), fresh snow crab, 1lb mussels and 1 lb of shrimp. Loved the mild captains boil sauce. The medium kicked it up a notch and was a bit too spicy for me."}
{"text":"The captain's boil is messy, flavourful, and a fun experience. The concept of this primary seafood based restaurant is simple; pick your seafood (you're charged by the weight) and your flavour and your spiceness level. It comes served to you in a clear bag, which you have to dig in yourself (hence, the messy part). The bag contains all the spices and flavour, so you're given gloves and a cute bib to wear so you don't stain your clothes (believe me, this happens even with the bib on). It's fairly expensive and if you're not there with a small group (e.g. 2 people), you end up order just some of the items on the menu. The flavour can get kind of boring after eating the same thing, so be sure to add some side dishes. Personally, I don't think it makes the $$ worth it  I would recommend coming for lunch, when they have their lunch special which is the \"SIZZLING PLATE COMBO\" *A choice of Teriyaki rice served with our seafood assortment* Teriyaki: Fish Teriyaki or Chicken Teriyaki and Seafood Assortment: 2 Crawfish 2 Mussels 2 Shrimps 2 Clams. It's less than $15 from what I remember (but not very filling).  Service was good. They accepted reservations no problem, and we arrived on a weekend for lunch (it was fairly quiet and empty)."}
{"text":"Hands down gotta be one of the better seafood boils location in the City. The service was on point 100% not to mention fresh seafood made to order.  If you haven't been to a seafood boil yet, this place is the place to go. This location is much bigger than its sister locations Yonge St. or College St. - they also went all out on decor and even have a bar area.  You can watch the ball game or a hockey game while eating delicious seafood boils and washing it all down with a cold one.  The Captain's Boil franchise is already great, but this location is also run by a great family - yup most of the staff are family. This is why their service is top notch.  Note worthy: they have a washing station in the middle of the restaurant. Excellent idea for those people like me who do not like gloves or bibs - wash your hands right near your table instead of going all the way to the washroom.  Plenty of parking in the plaza. Eat then go shopping in Vaughan Mills."}
{"text":"We went out for my mom's birthday, on my sister's suggestion that we try The Captain's Boil, though she had never been. My mom LOVES lobster. Loves it. So we get there, get our table and settle in. The core concept itself is not the issue at all, and the food actually wasn't bad. That said, if you are mindful of the plastic filling our oceans and choking sea turtles or whatever, skip it. The food is all served in plastic bags, cutlery is plastic, water cups, wine glasses... plastic.   My mom, dad, husband and sister all ordered things which required claw crackers to eat. They brought only two crackers and buckets, and when we asked if we could get more, they said they had run out of them but would bring the sets when some returned to their kitchen, which never happened. The restaurant wasn't close to full, so I'm not really understanding why they wouldn't have a set of crackers available. My sister then noted to one server that her corn didn't come to the table. Then mentioned it to another server who said it would be right along, after he CHECKED HER LOBSTER BAG to see if the corn was in fact there, as if she was some common corn thief!   The service was downright inattentive. Our water was filled zero times throughout the nearly two hours we were there. We also had to ask for the bill after sitting there with an empty table for a considerable period of time. Again, the restaurant certainly wasn't at capacity, and at one point I counted seven - yes, seven - staff just standing behind the counter, talking to each other and seemingly doing nothing.   I foresee this chain shutting down real quick (though maybe only this location is so incredibly deplorable that I would caution others against going), not just because it's gimmicky, but because they don't have the service - and claw crackers - to back it up."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time with a group of friends just after they opened and it was a fantastic experience. They have really made the place a unique dining adventure for seafood and even non seafood lovers. Can't wait for a return visit."}
{"text":"Food is good but worst service ever. Manager extremely rude. Will never go back. I had to wait for 1 hour and after calling me to let me know my table is ready I had to wait another hour. Go to red lobster or any other fish restaurant."}
{"text":"Food was tasty and fresh,highly recommend the lobster with their signature captain's boil sauce. Excellent service and roomy booth, seafood lover must try!! Good to know they guys doing all food items 10% off during soft opening. We will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I called on Thursday to make a reservation to find out they don't take them. Friday night I phoned 4x but nobody picked up the phone. I decided to come anyways on a Friday night at 6:30 and the wait wasn't too long. We were able to get a table after 15mins and ordered lobster and king crab. I wanted crawfish but they were already sold out for the night. We also ordered calamari and seafood fried rice. The seafood fried rice only had a few small shrimps and small scallops. Food didn't take too long, however, each seafood order was served in a bag with your choice of sauce (lemon pepper, garlic, captains boil or spicy). They provide bibs and plastic gloves as it gets very messy. The food was good, I wouldn't say amazing or mind blowing. The shock came when the bill came and the market price for each was $55! A lot pricier than expected. Not sure if I would return or go for a nice dinner elsewhere at those prices!"}
{"text":"Ate at North York location, party of 7.  The server was very knowledgeable and friendly.  Our food started coming in 10 minutes and was piping hot. Overall the servers were very attentive and food was delicious. We had a great time feasting seafood. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"****updated day of*****  Just ordered food here. Found bugs and am highly disgusted now with this because the quality and cleanliness isn't there. Will post pics of bugs in my shrimp and will have to report to health inspectors.   Disappointed in their quality. Had a few times where the shrimps were undercooked and mushy. The corn they gave was almost bad ! And tasted like it was over cooked to make it seem fresh yet the corn was completely white. Anyhow this is still my favourite location for their seafood boil, but the quality and cleanliness needs help ! Bring it back to the same quality as before plz.   This is my favourite location. They have the best service and their sauce taste the best cause it's very heavy with tons of garlic and spices !  If you love spicy and seafood then this is the location !!  The service is extremely fast and friendly. I eat here 1-2 times a week with my boyfriend getting takeout lobster, clams , shrimps!"}
{"text":"I went to The Captain's Boil with a few friends after it came highly recommend by a friend. Since we went mid-week there was no line, but there was also no one at the front. It took a little longer than we would have liked for someone to notice us and seat us. Once we were seated the server was extremely friendly and explained the process as was our first time.   I ordered mussels and snow crab with Captain's Boil seasoning with no extra spice. It was amazing! The crab was perfectly cooked and came out if its shell very easily. The mussels were HUGE and were also cooked perfectly. I loved the seasoning. It had the right amount of heat without being too much. I added on corn and lotus root. The corn was sweet and cooked perfectly as well. The lotus root did not have much flavour and I did not care for the consistency. I would not get it again, but that is more due to my taste than anything.   My friends ordered lobster, shrimp and clams. They said it was all amazing as well. For the add-ons they chose sausage and potatoes. The sausage was amazing! I wish I had ordered some. While I didn't try the potatoes, my friends all said they were good.   We ordered garlic bread for the table. I wasn't impressed. It seems like the Texas toast garlic bread you can buy frozen at the grocery store. It worked well to soak up the sauce though!  The only thing I didn't like was despite the restaurant being almost empty, our food was all brought out at different times, so two of us were already eating while the other two were still waiting. It was a good 5min before they brought out everyone else's order.   While it is a more expensive place to eat, the prices are fair given how much seafood you get. Based on the service and taste alone I will be returning."}
{"text":"Came to this new location with my family for a birthday dinner. Had an amazing time and the shrimp and lobsters were great. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Heard about this place from BlogTO but ran into the restaurant by accident while out shopping, we walked in at around 4pm, got a seat quickly because it wasn't dinner time yet, we ordered 1lb of shrimp, king crab leg and a lobster, got the captain's sauce. Food came fast, the food was nice and hot, the sauce was really tasty it was a mixture of Cajun, lemon juice, garlic and butter, the flavours were great really went well with the seafood and the mild version had a nice kick."}
{"text":"I came here with my brother and cousin to celebrate my cousin's birthday.   We had a feast of food: snow crab legs, lots of shrimp, crawfish (not frozen, we were told), mussels and clams. For the most part, we ordered everything with the Captain's spice mix and either medium-fire. The best items were the shrimp (big, tasty) and the snow crab legs. The clams were good, the mussels were okay and I wasn't too impressed by the crawfish. There's only a tiny piece of meat that you can eat in an otherwise biggish crustacean.   Service was friendly and the food came out quickly enough.   Hot tip: Bring your own gloves. My brother brought us all pairs of blue nitrile gloves, which made eating MUCH easier."}
{"text":"Now that I'm in a seafood coma...let's try to remember my overall experience lol.  So we arrived around 7:20pm on a Friday night and I anticipated a wait-time, but when we got there, there was a long line of people.  The hostess informed us it would be about 1-1 1/2 hour wait.  We drove all the way from Brampton, so we said ok we'll wait.  The cool thing is, they take your phone number down, then a text is sent to your phone to confirm your wait...then when a table is ready, you get another text and then you have 10 min from when your text is sent to get to your table.  I think it's a good idea in case you don't want to wait in the cold as there really isn't a waiting area.  In exactly an hour, we got our text that our table was ready and it was game on.  We wasted no time at all, as soon as our server came...we ordered and the food was coming out nice and hot.  We ordered... 1 lobster, 1 lb. of shrimp, 1 lb. of mussels, 1 lb. of snow crab with corn on the cob, raw oysters and Cajun fries.  All of our items that were served in a bag had the signature Captain's Boil seasoning with medium heat.  Anything spicier than the medium would have been unbearable to enjoy as the medium was spicy enough.  It was greasy, spicy, garlicky...finger licking good!  Everything tasted fresh and I can't really complain about the food.  We got all our seafood in the same flavour, but I still liked it.  Some ppl might get bored of it so switch up the flavours for different things, but I liked the captains boil seasoning on everything.  The Cajun fries were great!  Nice and crispy with the Cajun seasoning.  Now the oysters!!! I wish I had more, they were nice and big...hit the spot for my oyster craving lol   If you're scared to get dirty...don't worry, you get gloves, bibs and a whole roll of paper towel, but you might still get dirty lol  The downside to this place, is that it is a bit small.  They can't really do much about that but it's not a big restaurant.  I know they had a few tables downstairs and I think upstairs too.  Also, I asked if they had the shell/nut crackers for the crab and lobster but they didn't have.  I'm not sure if they don't have any or they didn't have any when I asked, but you would think they would have that as a necessity for cracking open the shells.  We got scissors and they don't work that well :(  So it was a bit of a struggle to break open the lobster claw.  Our server was very pleasant and made sure we were good with everything from beginning to end.  Always topped up our water, which is a must with the grease and spice!  The food was great and I would definitely go again!  For the overall total of our bill and how full we were, definitely worth coming again!"}
{"text":"I had dinner here to celebrate a friend's birthday, we both wanted seafood and she knew of this place, but this was our first time there...if you're expecting fancy, you won't get that here...what you will get is good, fresh seafood and a fun time...at the table is a plastic bib with cellophane gloves, your first clue that utensils are not happening...also at the table is a full roll of paper towels, can you say messy...we ordered clams in a medium spicy sauce, crab legs in a garlic, medium spicy sauce and a basket of fried shrimp...the clams arrived first, in a plastic bag...nothing fancy, just eat with your fingers...the crab legs also came in a bag (ask for scissors to cut the legs)...nothing was over cooked, just delicious, flavourful seafood...note: it's substantial amount of food...could have used some wet naps after feasting...the wait staff is friendly and will only approach you if you have a question or request the bill...not a noisy place even though it was busy...nice touch: the bill comes as if you were requesting a split bill as well as having the full total, smart thinking there...there is chicken on the menu for those who are not seafood eaters...definitely will got back."}
{"text":"I mean this place is more for the experience than the food really. I ordered a pound of prawns. Tasted ok but nothing to yell home about. The cool part was putting on the bib and gloves and eating, along with the pirates/nautical theme of the restaurant.  Would I encourage seafood lovers to come here at least once for the experience? Definitely.  Would I go again myself? Nope. Food was whatever and kind of pricey."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this food. Focusing on one thing and doing it well has served this chain well. The shrimp were fresh and tender, clams juicy, corn sweet and succulent, potatoes with skin on, okra were bright green and tender with no hint of slime. The medium spice was spot on, giving a little burn to the lips but not overpowering the taste of the seafood. Sous-vide plastic bags are kitchy but seal in flavour. Sauce was rich with a lot of depth and care to balance of spices. Service was fast and friendly, they could stock some better wine. Delicious and highly recommended."}
{"text":"Do NOT waste your money. One of the worst food experiences I've had in years. The manager's service is worse than the sauce and the sauce is worse than the seafood.   If you like seafood, go ANYwhere else.   If you want to go for the Instagram pictures, sure. Having said that, you're better off stealing a photo and saying you went.   Gross, just gross.   Recommendation: turn around and go anywhere else.   After spending $90 on dinner, we ended up eating dinner at Pizzaoili."}
{"text":"I'm giving this a 2/5 only because it was spacious. Other than that, terrible service. The waiter that seated us came to check only once out of the hour and a half we were there. Our order came 40 minutes after we ordered."}
{"text":"The food was alright but I found medium spice quite bland. I guess it was alright for the price. It was a different experience for sure."}
{"text":"It's 7pm on a Sunday and it's almost empty. Draft beer is served in a plastic cup and it's room temperature. No exaggeration. Service is horrendous. Had to correct 3 of the 6 items ordered. Observed a worker that had an A&F track pants on that walked around and was very indifferent as he interacted w the tables. I assume he's either the manager or the owner as he spent most of the time behind the bar in  front of the till. Can y see the lack of service if this guy is in an authority position .  Starts from the top. Too bad I was hoping this place would succeed as I live 5 mins from this place. Food was not good except for the fish and chips."}
{"text":"If you're looking for some good 'ol comfort food, make your way to this seafood spot. The servings are great for sharing with friends and family who are ready to get down and dirty.  My must-tries: Shrimp, mussels, and lobster claws (a pound each), all DRENCHED in Captain's Boil sauce. And get some extra buttery creole seafood rice while you're at it.  My tip: Order some cajun fries on the side, and dip them in the sauce your seafood came in. HEAVENLY."}
{"text":"I'd been dying to try this place for quite some time and it did not disappoint. My friends and I ordered the shrimp, snow crab, mussels, Seafood Cajun fried rice, Cajun fries, and clams. For the sauces, we picked captains boil which is their signature flavour and garlic for the clams. One waning when selecting the heat level however, not being one for spicy food, medium spice was too much for me and I ended up having to settle for mild. All else, everything was so tasty and the whole experience of eating with our hands just out the entire experience over the top. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and I've always had a fun time. I went with some friends so we shared our food so we could sample more things. We weren't fans of the shrimp because it was just too much work to clean and eat, especially with the gloves but the cajun snow crab legs in medium heat were so delicious. We loved them so much that when we went back the second time, we all ordered our own cajun snow crab leg servings. We also ordered a side of sweet potato fries and asked for corn in our seafood bag. The servers were great and the music was good (hip hop/R&B). My only negative would be that the gloves are too thin and we kept getting holes in them when we were handling the crab legs so the cajun sauce would seep into the gloves. Not the end of the world but it was just uncomfortable to have slippery fingers inside an already slippery glove. The servers were quick to give us replacement gloves when we asked so that was good."}
{"text":"I like the place and their food. But the fact that the food is expensive, they can't even give free refill for their soda. Like really? I paid $150+ for my orders and non of us couldn't get more soda. Smh."}
{"text":"If you are fan of seafood and want something different and fun, check out this place! Had heard a lot about eating with your hands and using disposable bibs/utensils with the seafood served to you in plastic bags so had to try it out. Although if you are of the more environmentally conscious mind, you might not like the experience as there is a ton of plastic that does get thrown out after an one time use.  Was expecting the place to have more of a no-frills decor and to run like a fast food/take out joint but that isn't the case. The decor is modern and like a normal restaurant. Even with coming before 6pm for dinner, the place was somewhat packed. We waited for a while for them to clear our table. I will admit the service is a tad slow and you have to ask them to refill your waters but for the experience, it's worth it. After reading from the reviews and countless people saying the crawfish and lobster weren't worth it, we decided on a pound of mussels with cajun seasoning mild flavor and a pound of shrimp with the captain's boil seasoning mild flavor. The seafood came out quickly while we had to wait longer for the side of seafood fried rice. We would have wished the food came out together so we could eat the food together. For the value of the mussels and shrimp, it was definitely worth it. The mussels were juicy and big. We definitely enjoyed the captain's boil seasoning over the Cajun seasoning and though even I like spicy things, I found the mild seasoning on the Cajun spice to be quite spicy. The seafood rice complimented the seafood quite nicely and it was good that it wasn't as spicy as the seafood. I wouldn't be a regular at this establishment but for the experience with others and getting messy while wearing plastic gloves and bibs, it's a fun experience! Also thankful to have a sink nearby so you can wash your hands afterwards."}
{"text":"Yelp categorizes this as a Creole restaurant, but it's not really. I mean yeah they have okra, but it's not like anything you'd get in the South. Same with the boils. The concept is right but the execution is off. I got the snow crab legs with okra and corn abd the signature spice blend, and my partner got the lobster roll and broccoli. He said the lobster roll was amazing, but the portion was way too small. The broccoli was good but not great. The snow crab legs and okra were definitely tasty (but not like what you'd get in the South, which is what I'd hoped for), but the okra was slimy instead of crispy, and they didn't give me any tools to open them, so I got little tears in my gloves and the sauce leaked through. They did give me a cracker after I asked for it, but no picks. The beer selection was also pretty limited. Overall I think it'd be a fun place to go with a group, but it's more of a gimmick than great food. The high point was the extremely friendly server."}
{"text":"What can I say. I love this place! I've been quite a few to this and other locations.   My favourites: Extra buttery Creole Seafood fried rice 1lb of shrimp with the garlic sauce  I've also had the lobster, mussels, crab and clams. All yummy.  Wednesday's visit I tried out the new lobster roll and bisque. A huge let down. A slice of cold not crispy bacon strip on the cold lobster served on a warmed hot dog roll. Minus the bacon it still didn't wow me. The lobster bisque is not lobster bisque.    The staff are always lovely to interact with."}
{"text":"I went with my friends on a Tuesday afternoon around 2pm, best time to go, there were very few people so the service was fast and there was no waiting. As soon as we sat down we got waited on. The staff that we interacted with were extremely friendly. We were notified that some of the items are seasonal. I got 1lb of crawfish + Fries= $23. One of my friends got 1lb of mussels + chickens strip and fries= $20. Food was well seasoned.   Over all the experience was good. Yes some things are pricey like the lobster and crab legs but they have options so you're not breaking your  bank account. PLUS there play list was amazing."}
{"text":"After seeing all the hype about this place, it was finally my turn to try it out! Came here on a Wednesday night with a group of 4. After reading all the reviews about how ridiculous the wait time can get, we decided to come earlier and try to avoid the line up. I came at 545pm and was seated right away, there were still a few free empty tables at that time, but by 6-ish, they were all filled up. If you come with a bigger group of people though, definitely call ahead and make a reservation. Because when I arrived at the restaurant, there was someone in front of me asking for a table for a group of 7, and they were told that there was nothing available until 9pm. You can park right outside the restaurant on Yonge street after 6pm on weekdays. It is metered parking.   The service was pretty good. For a pretty small restaurant, they have a lot of waitstaff. So we felt like we were pretty well taken care of. Our waiter was able to answer all our questions about the menu, and provided some good recommendations on which sauces go well with which seafood.  We tried all the seafood on the menu except for the crawfish which wasn't available, and the king crab which we thought was a bit too expensive. The king crab was $35/lb, and we were told 1 lb is only 1 leg. Everything was very good! My favourite seafood was the mussels, as I found that the meat absorbed the sauce the best. My favourite sauce was the cajun, it had a very nice kick to it! The Captain's Boil sauce was also very good. We had the clams with the garlic sauce, the clams with the sauce were generally pretty good, but I think it came with a bit too much garlic. Some of the clams I bit into was just all garlic, and then I had to make sure to check and brush off the excess garlic before I took a bite. We also got corn and cajun fries. The corn was $1 each, which was half of a small cob. It was very refreshing after eating all the seafood. The cajun fries was good as well, nothing special, tastes just like the ones I get from Popeyes.  I realized that this was my first time eating an entire meal without any utensils. It was a lot messier than I expected. But was definitely a very fun experience! Probably not a good idea for a first date though =D"}
{"text":"Back again and this time, I gotta say.. \"Meh, I've had better\"! To be honest, I'm starting to think that The Boil Bar might be superior despite the fact that The Captain's Boil has more franchises. I mean, seafood is always delicious but here were my main issues today:  1) The clams weren't hot enough 2) Both the Captain's Boil and Garlic sauce were way too salty 3) The market price of lobster was insanely expensive? Is it really $40?! And the meat also wasn't the freshest 4) The shrimp wasn't fresh either, the meat was mushy and didn't have that nice bounce  Sooo.. Yea. That was one pricey lunch. I walked out nice and full but in retrospect, I'm not sure it was worth it. Definitely won't be getting the lobster again!"}
{"text":"Hands down my most favourite seafood place!   I usually get a pound of shrimps in Captains boil sauce and usually go with spicy. Words cannot explain how amazing the sauce is, it just pairs so well with everything!  I also get a pound of the mussels also in the Captains Boil sauce but i like to choose fire for the spice level. The mussels are pretty big and will definitely fill you up. I have gotten the clams in the past, but i feel that its not worth it. The clams are really small and some times you get empty shells with no clams :(. You're definitely better off getting the mussels!  On the side we usually get the seafood fried rice and their Cajun fries.  The fried rice is amazing just on its own but its even better when you eat it with the seafood that had been doused in the Captains Boil sauce!  I also love the experience of eating here as they give you a bib and a pair of gloves to eat with. So you get to eat with your hands! Yes it can get really messy but trust me it will have you going back. I have gone there 3 times in the last couple of months."}
{"text":"The shrimps with sausage are the best meal on the menu. Had it several times over, and the taste is still as good as the first. Portions on the meals are also quite large compared to the other locations. I'd highly recommend eating in the restaurant as the sauce can gey quite messy if you do take out. Also this location gets quite full, so it's best to plan a reservation, otherwise you can expect some very long (30n-1h) wait."}
{"text":"Very interesting dinning experience with lots of disposable plastic garbage .   You are welcomed by the poly food gloves and paper table cloth. Even the dishes are served in plastic bag which is said to be safe to contain food. The only dish served with ceramic plate is the Seafood fried Rice. Actually it tastes very good with lots of shrimp and scallops.  I took the server's advice and chose the most popular sauce. It tastes like a combination of garlic, butter and some other spices."}
{"text":"Went to Captain's Boil for dinner on Saturday night. Waited for around 45min but luckily there is a Galleria grocery store at the back to kill time.  Service was excellent and our wait staff explained the menu to us.  Food: We ordered - Shrimps with cajun sauce in medium with a cob of corn I love the cajun sauce and the kick of spiciness. There's a lot of garlic at the bottom of the plastic bag. The waitress pointed out 1lb of shrimps isn't a lot but we could've gotten less.   - Crawfish with captain's boil sauce in mild The crawfish were very small. May be we didn't know how to eat it. There were not a lot of meat so it isn't worth it. The sauce seems more buttery than the cajun sauce.  - Lotus roots with lemon pepper sauce in mild Lemon pepper sauce goes well with the crunchy lotus roots.  - French fries Very crunchy  Overall, new experience and the sauce tasted good. The seafood seems fresh and the price was very reasonable."}
{"text":"Messy in a great way nice Fresh fish quick service but maybe bring a lobster cracker next time.  A con I had was at times I wanted to taste more fish then captain boil seasoning which at times is a little overpowering.  Should've ordered more corn,  lotus root is a good deal,  cheap prices well worth it."}
{"text":"Disappointing options, there is no appetizers, no soup, basically no options except plastic bags of seafood on crate paper. What kind of seafood restaurant doesn't have a seafood chowder or something.  It charges an unreasonable price for something so downmarket. The one thing they have is their sauce, as their seafood isn't even that amazing.  Low-end restaurant masquerading as higher end, and not reasonably priced. Low value for the money, you have better options.   Disappointment, would not recommend and would not return."}
{"text":"LOCATION: Easy to Find.  SCENERY: Calm.  SERVICE: Fantastic, Extremely Friendly and Helpful. Happy Faces all around. I was beyond impressed.  FOOD: It was okay. I mean, I've been to all their locations; I'm a huge fan. But at this particular location, they steam their meals instead of boil so it's not as flavourful. I guess they are doing it that way cause of health reasons.  OVERALL: I LOVED IT!"}
{"text":"The sauce was mediocre, I had way better ones in the states from boiling crab and the boil. The service was also slow, I know they are busy, so hire more people to handle the amount of people?"}
{"text":"I was taken here by my hubby for my birthday.  I failed to check the recipes and pics prior to the date and went despite my hesitancy it was for my birthday with my family so I went. So basically it is seafood or chicken boiled and poured into plastic bags.  It's handed to you in a plastic bag and you are given plastic gloves to eat it with.  That's it. Shrimp and crawfish are whole and you need to pick them apart with your hands. I was r ally grossed out and didn't eat my shrimp.  The flavour was ok.  Nothing exciting there.  Oh each table had paper towel rolls with food dirt left on them from previous patrons.  Nice touch.  I must say great idea for the owners as there are no dishes or glasses to wash. Just garbage!  I will not recommend this place and I will never go back."}
{"text":"Make reservations if you have a large party. Sat for 10 mins before we had to call over a server. Afterwards service was more attentive. Concept is simple, food comes with seasonings that you choose, served in a plastic bag. Gloves are supplied but bare fingers work best. No crawfish as it's mating season so we will be back. Shrimp and snow crabs were cooked perfectly. Mussels were overcooked. Overpriced for lotus roots and broccoli sides. Captain's Boil seasoning is delicious but choose the others for contrast."}
{"text":"Busy busy busy.  I think it's because we went when it first opened, maybe 2 weeks in.  Had to call in advance a few days for the reservations.  went with a party of 6.  No utensils, all they give you is a bib.  So it's an interesting take on seafood cuisine.  I was all down for it.  When we got in, one of the servers was quite rude but eventually, we got our table, and ordered a bunch of stuff:  Lobster ($28) Snow crab legs ($19) Shrimp ($10) Mussels ($10) Clams ($10) Corn ($1 each) Cajun Fries ($5) Sweet Potato Fries ($6)   The best seasoning is the Captain's Boil (obz) which is everything mixed together (cajun, lemon pepper, garlic butter).  You can also choose spice level, we just went with mild for everything and found it perfect to go with the sauce and the food we ordered.  If I went back again, I would try the crawfish as well.  The snow crab legs were mediocre.  Lobster and shrimps were the best in my opinion.  They serve beers to go with your food, which is nice. 5 bottles for $25.  The placs is small, but they do have 2 levels, a few tables in the basement. Near the washrooms.  But overall, it's loud in there!  Not sure if the prices changed but they're reasonable to an extent, not really good value but it's a good experience for sure. I would go back to introduce friends and family to the new way of eating."}
{"text":"Yechhhhhh. I had chicken fingers and glad I did because the bibs, leaky plastic gloves, olastic ans styrofoam dishes grossed me out. When our large group left, the table was a mound of garbage. How does \"boiling\" and then serving seafood in a plastic bag make it any better?"}
{"text":"So we finally decided to try this place just because we can:... I've always wanted to eat food wearing plastic gloves that remind me of dying my hair.  Step one select type of seafood, step 2 select sauce, and step 3 select spicy level.  Adds on can be included in the sauce seafood bag or separate.  We ordered the shrimp with broccoli and lotus root.  My SO ordered the crab legs which came to 6 legs in a pound plus garlic bread and corn.  The food tasted fine.  The seafood tasted fresh and it was cooked well.  The lotus root was amazing in the Cajun sauce!    I would say the service is perfunctory as opposed to friendly.  They do their job dropping off your food.  They just don't feel like they want to do more than they have to.  And for a place that has no cutlery, at least not for us, I feel like they should make it more entertaining.  Instead I was left to my own devices to play with the shrimp feelers."}
{"text":"If seafood is what you're looking for. And u don't mind getting your hands messy . This place is for u. As sooon as u walk in. RICHMOND Branch.    Different aroma here. Smells really good.  Its got fun vibe here .really good for a big group. As u get to try more variety.  Shrimp & Mussels   sizes .not tiny and not too big.   Buttered garlic and captains mix    is our fave.    We ordered mild  . ha  but it still is on the spicier side.  It was very goood though. We ordered some side of rice   so perfect actually. Thier crab was yummy tooo.   Meaty . It's worth ur time peeling. With beer  . It's perfection.  Cajun fries are spicy   but in a good way. It's delicious.  They fill you water fast  tooo.  All 7 of us walked in hungry  .walked out satiated and happy  Reasonable price.  Seafood is fresh. Fun place. Will definitely go back ."}
{"text":"An experience of its own.  Boiled seafood in a plastic bad- no plates. Grown folks wearing bibs and eating with plastic gloves. Take all your social media pics early as it will get messy.  I ordered 1lb of clams and 1 lb of shrimp with corn. The clam was delicious, nice and soft and the captain boil mix with extra hot was amazing tasting. The shrimp was a little challenging to clean- as I am not a fan of looking at the shrimp heads but it was still delicious. I also ordered a side of chicken wings. Surprisingly unless you are going for big ticket items like lobster and crag legs..it is good value. I had no carbs in my meal- just seafood- corn and chicken wings and I was completely full.  If you are looking for an adventure- this is one worth taking!"}
{"text":"Went there last night for the first time with my boyfriend. The whole experience deserves five stars. The food was delicious and the service was amazing. The manager brought us our wine himself and made sure everything was okay. The servers make you feel like you're at home. Will definitely return"}
{"text":"Boiled seafood served in plastic bags. Sounds simple, but it's actually a really cool idea!    You first order your seafood by weight with a choice of spice including cajun, lemon pepper, garlic sauce or \"Captain's Boil\", which is the combination of all three. My preferred spice is definitely the Captain's Boil. You get the best of all three flavours and it tastes great!  My favourites are the clams and the king crab legs.  I definitely come here more for the experience, but taste is on point as well."}
{"text":"Service was great. Wasn't crowed at 10 pm ( closing is 11pm). Received food quickly and the waiters were very polite. I enjoyed my food ( I had shrimp, snow crab legs, and sausage... they were out of corn). Next time I am in Toronto I will be returning ... this is my go to seafood spot."}
{"text":"A very messy but memorable meal! First impression when walking in the door was great! The decor and ambience are stellar and we were greeted with a smile. The menu is nice and simple which I like. Once you've chosen your dish, put your bib/gloves on and get ready for some fun! My wife had the shrimp and I had snow crab, both with captains boil sauce. Medium has a great kick and would definitely suggest it. Both were very fresh and had tons of flavor. We also got corn and broccoli on the side. I would definitely return with friends to have a good chuckle watching everyone eat their delicious food with no cutlery! Highly recommend for the amazing service and fantastic food! A+"}
{"text":"I jumped on the foodie bandwagon and gave this place a try with my family! When we went, we had a pretty bad experience with the wait time because the wait time kept getting longer and longer! We initially was told by the hostess that the wait time would take 45 min and we had to constantly follow up with different answers. We eventually ended up waiting for almost 2 hours! Had we known this from the beginning, we would have gone to another restaurant and try this place another night. This definitely soured our experience. Luckily the food was pretty decent - loved the Cajun flavours! I highly recommend the shrimp and the mussels because I feel that they are the best value from the menu compared to the other seafood items which can run up your bill! Definitely also try their Cajun fried rice and their fries! In terms of service, it was average but I think it's partly because they are quite busy and really could use more staff. Overall, this place is pretty good, but I'm not rushing to come back."}
{"text":"The food is prepared well and I prefer the sauces here more than some of it's competition.   But the portion sizes are overall smaller and almost always for a significantly higher price.   They have my  taste vote but not the value vote."}
{"text":"Gluten-free review:  There aren't many gluten-free options here and cross contamination is high. Everything is fried in the same vat so their fries are contaminated with gluten from the battered items they offer. I believe the seafood is also cooked all together so if you have allergies to some seafood and not others then you shouldn't risk eating here.   The wait staff also don't seem to be educated well on allergies. When asked if the fries were gluten-free the waiter said no because it wasn't breaded. When I asked if it was fried in the same vat as their breaded items he said yes but the heat should kill everything. I informed him that's not how gluten works and cooking it in the same vat would create cross contamination. He seemed very surprised by this. Not a good first impression.   I had a a few bags with each of the sauces and different seafood. Everything was tasty but I ended up bloated with a stomach ache later that night, so I'm guessing this was either due to cross contamination or gluten in the sauces.   The only gluten-free alcoholic drinks listed was sake or soju for $17. Everything else was only beer, which was around $5. Other than the massive price difference for the gluten-free drinks, they didn't have any cider or wine, which is pretty standard at most restaurants.   Aside from the gluten issue, I think paying $30 per person (before tip) for a meal here is not worth it. Food was tasty, but not worth the price tag or the health issues.   TL;DR gluten everywhere and staff uneducated about cross contamination"}
{"text":"Fun and tasty exactly once but I'll never go back. I wished that we could have tossed some service in a bag and dumped to on to my table. Waited 30 min for our first drink, meals were delivered 20 min apart, waited another 20 min for our bill. One of the sides we ordered was missing, but we didn't have an opportunity to ask for it.  The food tasted great, but I question the value - $40 for 1 king crab leg and 2 pieces of corn was a bit outrageous."}
{"text":"It's an interesting and unique experience, and a decent place if you're craving seafood. However, it may be a bit too pricey for what you get; depending on what seafood you end up choosing.  The mussels we had were probably the best value, they were big and a good price. Lobster however was not really worth it in my opinion. There are places you can get more lobster oomp for better value.  In terms of their sauces, their specialty, Captain's Boil is definitely the best choice. You can get the other ones if you want more variety.   keep in my mind, it's a messy experience regardless of what you get."}
{"text":"Came in on a friday night after finding out they opened just this week. Space is super clean and huge. I've been to other captains boil before and always felt rushed and crowded but this one was comfortable and relaxing. They have a huge sink for people to clean their hands throughout their meals if you wish to choose so (it does get very very messy!!)  As you are seated you are given this cute little plastic apron and some plastic gloves. The table also supplies a large roll of papertowel and a bucket for your shells.  Menu is very straightforward.. they have an entire side for seafood and then another side for other dishes like chicken wings, cajan fries, okra, rice dishes and etc. Prices were also quite fair as well.  We opted to do the lobster and shrimp in a bag as well as the chicken wing/fries and cajan seafood fried rice. For two people it was too much food!!! The shrimp was cooked in their captain boil sauce and the hottest heat they have. It has a really spicy kick to it... and i love spicy food but i was crying for water constantly!! The shrimp was cooked perfectly.. not overly chewy and had easy to peel shell. The lobster we opted for the milder spice and that was quite tasty too. The lobster is sold at seasonal price and for this one we got it was 38.99. They did however overcooked the lobster slightly as it was more rubbery than i liked.  Chicken wings and fries basket were also great in portion size for 11.99. Fries were a tade spicy and we had a total of about 6 wings in the basket as well. The fried rice comes in a big plate and can easily be shared amongst 4 people.  Service was also top notch. Everyone was super friendly and making sure everything was going ok. I am so glad captains boil came into our area!!! Coming from the east end originally... were happy to slowly see more and more yummy asian eats!!!"}
{"text":"It's good but its not as good as Boiing Crab in Vegas, When I went they had crawfish on the menu but didn't have it in stock.   FOOD: 3.5/5 The food was good considering this is the first seafood boil in Toronto and first one in Canada that I have had tried. Somethings were a little bland but others soaked in the flavor very good. I had the snow crab legs, shrimp, clams, and mussels. The mussels were the cheapest and probably the best, 75% of the clams they gave me were closed, I tried to flag down a server but they just seemed way to busy.   SERVICE: 2.5/5 Theyre new I get it, they were also busy I also understand but I asked for water 3 times and got it on the third try, I also got a pop but never received it. Servers also dont know how to coordinate when to help you as I was helped AFTER people whom sat down AFTER me.  My guest and I sat in the basement which was awkwardly placed beside the washroom, I think they also have a upstairs + the main room,  WOULD I RETURN?: Yes the food is decent and for seafood its alright for the price. but hopefully next time its not as busy."}
{"text":"Seafood boil was quite the hype in Toronto, I think in 2016. Since then, they've rapidly expanded and other brands have opened up.  Anyways, if you love seafood, I would say try at least once to see if it is your thing. They have some lunch only items like the teriyaki sizzling plate which is great value and you get to sample a bunch of stuff. But their real specialty is seafood in sauce within a plastic bag (sounds silly the way I write it but that's really what it is).  The prices vary depending on what you are getting (crawfish, lobster, mussels etc). If you just want the experience, I would recommend shrimp/mussels/clams as these are cheaper than the other options. One problem with the clams is that most of the meat falls off the shell. And pretty much for most of the seafood you're getting the taste by licking the shell. There isn't that much meat on crawfish. This is a place that you can spend hundreds, or under $50 for two depending on what you get. If you want to be super cheap, you can get fried rice and that will fill you up.   How is the taste? I would say it's alright. The Captain's Boil sauce is a very buttery sauce with chili flavor depending on your spice level. The garlic sauce was extremely garlicky. There must be like 20 gloves of garlic in one bag. You'll want to brush your teeth afterwards. I liked the captain's boil sauce much better.  Service is your typical Chinese service. Don't expect to be pampered which is alright with me.  Would I come again? Maybe for lunch. I'm not a huge seafood person. Most of the weight comes from shells (nothing wrong with that). I find their sizzling plate pretty tasty and reasonable. Their lobster roll combo also looks nice and I might try that."}
{"text":"This is a passed on review. My parents went there for dinner and were not impressed. Small plastic bags of food? I mean, I get the concept myself but it's just not something people from Newmarket would enjoy (in my opinion). I can see younger people from the city getting into the idea but the place is so over priced that generally only older people can afford it anyways!   They had the same problem as others with the pewnie potato and were overall not too wowed on flavour.  Overall they left disappointed and hungry, so hungry that they stopped by the Golden Arches on the way home! After tip, the meal for two rounded off at 75 bucks only ordering meals with no appetizers, no alcohol (only 2 sodas served in small plastic cups) and no dessert.   The only thing that wasn't terrible was the service. They said their server was very nice and understanding of their utter disappointment in the meal. They said it seemed like she knew that the place wasn't exactly a 5 star establishment.   Side note from myself: I was excited to try this restaurant before I heard this review. Now I will never visit. The amount of waste in plastic bags, cutlery and cups is ridiculous (I doubt it is biodegradable even if so, how is washing real plates  worse for the environment?)  Next time you want seafood, make the drive to red lobster. It's a half hour away but at least you'll enjoy yourself (and probably for less $)"}
{"text":"Great place and definitely an interesting experience might I add. The only awkward thing is using that damn gloves to eat the food. I'm Filipino and we have hand-to-mouth eating experiences like this one, but the only difference is we actually use our bare hands. But when you're using gloves to eat, it's a bit awkward and a lot messier to be honest. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the experience and the mess.  My family and I ordered a few things - Cajun fries, sweet potato fries, chicken, 2 pounds of shrimps, clams, mussels. We decided to not get the pricey items (lobster) and stuck with the other seafood. The crayfish is also not available and in season. The sauce that they mix with the seafood in the plastic bag is sooo good. We even ate that with rice and it was delicious. Just a note for those with sensitive taste buds,  you might find mild as actually a little spicy so be careful when choosing your spice level and sauce.   Can't wait to visit this place again!  It's really great for a big group!"}
{"text":"Great experience eating with your hands (kind of). The gloves are a bit annoying at times but I guess there's no other way to keep it clean. Other than that, it's a great concept. I came with my family and had a great time. The wait was around 25 minutes on a Sunday around 6pm. It's really busy but I think it's worth the wait given that we hardly have any place like this around.   The food was really good. I love the concept of ordering food and it comes in a bad with your preferred spices. We ordered some shrimps, mussels, clams, rice, chicken,  sweet potato fries and Cajon fries. The crayfish is out of season so they weren't offering it. They were all mild flavours but some thought it was still a little spicy so if your spice tolerance is low...then you're on your own. Love the spices and the sauce. With rice, it's fabulous.  Overall, it wasn't too cheap but wasn't too expensive either. For a family of 5, we spent around $100 and it was pretty filling. We weren't all you can eat full, but the right amount of full.  Will definitely come back again. Great for special occasions with a big group!"}
{"text":"I voted for Captain's Boil for a NOW Magazine contest where they were looking for the best seafood restaurant in Toronto. Of course, I have been going to Captain's Boil for a while now and I always love it (better than LA Boil lol) so I voted without hesitation. Well, they won (as I knew they would) and then I got an email saying that because I voted, I get to dine for free at their new location at Queen and McCaul and a winners party. I was ecstatic! This location is very nice. Serving staff is attentive, they have a great bar, and the seafood of course is fresh and comes out quickly! My food was out in 5 mins after I ordered lol. I will definitely be back and this location might be the one I frequent most often."}
{"text":"Love the food! I've been there 4 times already! The captain's boil sauce is the best!"}
{"text":"First time there and for sure not last. The server was great. Food was delicious."}
{"text":"This establishment is close to the North York/ Finch subway station. Quite small though so make sure to make a reservation before going or you will be waiting! Going on weekends are quite busy but definitely worth trying. The idea came from boil bars in the states. The concept is quite unique... essentially it is eating seafood out of plastic bag. Quite a variety to choose from, from lobster to crab to shrimps and mussells. There are also 3 different flavours to choose from.  When we went, we decided to try the King Crab and clams with the mix sauce (of 3 different flavours) in a mild spice. The sauce itself is super buttery and delicious!!! The seafood was cooked perfectly and two bags are definitely good enough to share for two people. We also opted for the chicken wing and the cajun fries. The fries are spicy but very tasty! Chicken wings are also classic deep fried asian wings that we all quite enjoyed! Save your sauce from your seafood and dip your fries in there!! Definitely a heartattack on a plate because of the butter and sodium but it was worth it.  They now have a second location in the downtown core (Yonge and north of college) and another boil bar in the markham/scarborough border (Siver star plaza) so this concept of seafood in a bag is definitely expanding!"}
{"text":"Best, best seafood place. The captain's boil sauce is greatly recommended! Service was amazing along with the food!!! Sausage add ons were amazing as well, it has a great crispy skin. Definitely coming back again!"}
{"text":"Where do I start!? I have been drooling over the pictures from previous reviews and I just had to try it. I must say that the Downtown location is 1000% times better than the North York location. If you don't want to wait in lines in the cold, I suggest paying a visit during the weekdays. The food is delicious! I had the shrimp and crawfish with cajun fries that I shared with a friend. It was A LOT of food! Between the two of us, we had to take breaks. We ordered the Captain's Boil seasoning/sauce in medium. Take it from a person who loves spicy food, after a while your mouth will be on fire! Perhaps mild will be the better choice for those who still want flavour without the after-kick.  Between the two of us our bill came to about $40 altogether, so $20 plus tip isn't a bad to price to pay for the amount of food we got. The wait staff were friendly and even came up to refill our water and check in on us. If you need an extra bib or another pair of gloves, just ask. They're happy to provide it for you. Ladies, bring a hair tie and avoid wearing anything white. Gentlemen, don't wear long sleeves, and bring breath mints! Most importantly be prepared to burp seafood for the rest of the day or night. Mmmmmm..."}
{"text":"Overall, I was very impressed with the quality of the seafood here.  They don't have crawfish yet (they said they will ship into the restaurant later this week), but you can choose from lobster, mussels, clams, (I would love to try that next time), shrimp, dungeness crab, and king crab legs.  It's a wonderful selection of seafood and it's so cool to be eating them out of a plastic crab for a boil.  I adored how the seafood was boiled perfectly so that everything tasted so good and fresh.  It reminded me a little bit about how Chinese restaurants cook the seafood so perfectly each time.  Well done!"}
{"text":"Absolutely extraordinary place! Seafood is really fresh. Thry own crasft beer is delisious! Love this restaurant!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food! If you are first time customer, try captains boil sauce! It is the best. But dont expect good service  https://youtu.be/fHw_HN87jbM Check out my experience here  Oyster: $16.95  Yummy, fresh, but smaller than expected  Shrimp: $12.95 1lb Taste really great and shrimps are large!  Crab legs $19.95 1lb The best dish i ordered!  *Service: 1/5 score Not helpful not friendly, seems ignorant  Refused to give us larger tables (but then gave the large table to 2 white girls)"}
{"text":"I dined at Captain's Boil on a Thursday with 10 coworkers. We made a reservation well in advance and I would suggest the same if you have a group larger than 4. The service was prompt and the food was brought to our table quite quickly. If you are generally a clean eater like I am, get ready to step outside your comfort zone because there is no way to dine here without getting a little messy. The plain fries were a key non-saucy component of our meal. I would recommend going straight home after you dine here and having a shower and washing your clothes because you will smell of food.   THE GOOD: A unique dining experience and food was tasty.   THE BAD: Food served in double plastic bags. Drinks served in plastic cups. Plastic gloves and bibs. It would be nice to see less garbage created.  Only 3 stars because it really isn't my type of dining experience."}
{"text":"The Captain's Boil is an experience. This is why I'm rating it a 4. If you've never shelled your own lobster or cleaned a shrimp, this is something you need to try.  We went as a group and ordered a combination of shrimp, lobster and crawfish. The lobster was by far the best thing we ordered, and was on special at $20 for a full lobster. The shrimp were tasty, however after sitting in a hot bag for too long, they do become over cooked. For a lot of work and very little meat, the crawfish were not worth what we paid for them. We ended our meal with complimentary ice cream. The table agreed that it was possibly the best mango ice cream we've ever had.  I highly recommend getting the Captain's Boil seasoning on your choice of seafood. I got the mild version and it was the perfect balance of garlic, spice and seasoning."}
{"text":"The bags of seafood gradually started to arrive at our tables.  Our tablemates got an assortment of different seafood like clams, mussels, lobster, crawfish, snow crab legs so we were able to somewhat try out what there were to offer (they also offer king crab and Dungeness crab at the restaurant).  Everything was so delicious!  I was especially content with my seafood that both ended up arriving in Captain Boil's sauce.  The Captian Boil's sauce is a mixture of their three other sauces:  Cajun Cajun, Lemon Pepper, and Garlic Sauce.  It was quite spicy too since I had chosen a medium heat.  The crawfish actually were quite large and had a lot of meat in its claws too -- normally when you eat crawfish, you just eat the head and body and there is little meat inside the claws.  The snow leg crab was gigantic!  This was more than enough for me to enjoy and the meat from the crab leg was firm and dense.  Dipping into the Captian's Boil sauce made it even more scrumptious."}
{"text":"Visited Fri Jan 19, 2018 for dinner.  They recently had a groupon deal, so the place seemed busy because of that.  I like that they customize your meal for example more or less spicy and you get to pick the sauce. They accepted reservations which is was good.   Pros Ordered shrimp basket, lobster, clams, 4 corns and mussels.  The food was tasty and fresh, but the sauce is a bit overpowering.  Really large portions, took home at least 1/3 of our dinner.   Cons Plastic cutlery, plastic bib, plastic bags and plastic cups makes the meal look and feel cheap. For a $100 meal, the cutlery should be metal, food served on plates with exceptional service. No vegetables or carbs with my meal, a bit of corn but hardly a balance meal.  It's a messy meal and your hands will get dirty, it's tricky trying to use the gloves.  Parking can be tough to find along Bayview.  Auto-gratuity is part of the Groupon deal, I prefer choosing how much to tip.     Protip - Serving the food in a plastic bag is just a gimmick, the food is not cooked in plastic bags.   Damage - $93!!!"}
{"text":"We went on Friday Night. Tasty seafood, good service. Really good place."}
{"text":"If you're really really into seafood, this is the place for you! Cutting into the crab and lobster to find the meat is a lot of work and energy. I wasn't a fan of this. I also had the Captain's Boil sauce which was spicy but the actual meat doesn't taste like it unless you dip it in after carving it out. When you finally dip, you see a lot of oil.  We had the  * lobster ( Captain's Boil / mild heat). A lot of work to cut through to find the meat. A very large size portion for just one person. It comes very hot so watch out!  * snow crab legs (Captain's Boil / Fire Smokin Hot). Not too much work to get to the meat and a perfect portion to eat if you want side orders. * fried shrimp basket served with Cajun fries. The fries were good. I would recommend serving them with a different sauce (chipotle, or any mayo based sauce). We only got ketchup and mayo.  * fresh oyster platter. Wasn't impressed as I felt the sauces with the oysters could have been better. I just really got hot sauce and I think seafood sauce.   Service was great. Towards the end it took a while for them to come to our table so we could get our bill. There's a sink outside so washing hands is convenient!"}
{"text":"I feel like this place is definitely underrated. I came here for dinner with a friend and really enjoyed the experience of eating out of a bag, with captain boil sauce all over our mouths and hands.  I HIGHLY recommend the mussels with captain boil sauce. If I was to go back, I think I would just get the mussels and call it a day.  We also had the shrimp and snow crab legs- shrimp with Cajun sauce, and snow crab with garlic sauce. Personally I felt the captain boil sauce to be best and flavourful.  Highly attentive staff at this location makes the experience even better!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a weekday. The inside looks nice and modern; there weren't that many customers when we went at around 12:30PM. Interestingly enough, there is a sink in the dining room for people that would like to wash their hands immediately after indulging in some messy, cajun seafood.   For two people, we ordered a pound of mussels (captain's boil sauce and mild), a chicken teriyaki rice dish (captain's boil sauce and mild), and a basket of regular fries. The food came extremely quick (like 5mins or less); I assume most of it is ready to go and it just needs to be assembled into a serving dish and/or bag for customers to enjoy.   The mussels were juicy and I feel like they are the most easy to eat with your hands compared to the other seafood that was offered. The captain's boil sauce was great, really buttery to the point where I don't even want to think about how many calories it was haha. The fries were crispy, seasoned, and little bit spicy. They are definitely a must if you need a filling side because ordering and eating straight up seafood can get pricy and even boring.  The only real complaints about the food I have is about the chicken teriyaki rice. First of all, it's not chicken teriyaki. It's just chicken slices with captain's boil sauce on it. There's no teriyaki sauce or other garnishes such as beansprouts in the dish, which is sorta misleading. I also wish it had more sauce on the rice; I had to pour some of the sauce from the bag of mussels onto the rice which made it so much more enjoyable to eat.   Secondly, this restaurant uses disposable EVERYTHING as mentioned in other reviews. From the bowls to the utensils, the paper towels, the table cloth, the cups -- I believe everything is just wrapped up in the paper table cloth at the end and dumped at once for easy clean-up. I know convenience is important and it's probably the most cost-saving but I wouldn't doubt Captain's Boil's carbon footprint to be outrageously high.   The service was nice, and it wasn't too expensive. The bill came up to around $30 for two people which is pretty good. We were definitely full by the end of it. I would come again but probably only for lunch because the rice dishes are only available at that time and they are pretty cheap, tasty, and filling."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch on a Sunday at around 1:30pm.  The greeting I received at the door was friendly and welcoming.  Sitting down at a spacious booth in the modern, recently renovated restaurant raised my already high expectations.  The tables are dressed with a fresh layer of plastic for each customer, along with bibs to protect your clothing.  If you're looking for fine dining, this is not the place.  If you want a fun and delicious experience, then I thoroughly encourage you to go.  I ordered the a pound of shrimp, with Captain's boil sauce (a mixture of all three sauces).  Served in a bag, the presentation was somewhat lacking, but we're beyond such formalities now.  The \"pound\" of shrimp was a considerably more generous than a pound, and they also threw in a side of corn for free.  The sauce was perfect, treading the fine line between spicy and flavorful.  I thoroughly enjoyed my experience here, and would recommend it to anyone.  A word of warning though, stick to what they're good at.  The bags of seafood are incredible, however the deep fried fish and fries are somewhat generic."}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time had lobster, clams, crawfish and shrimp sides were corn and potatoes. Loved the lobster cooked to perfection as we're the clams, didn't like the crawfish as much spice level was good (order fire) and potatoes where huge all in all a good feast loved the lobster"}
{"text":"The Captain's Boil has docked in Newmarket! Toronto's most popular and fastest growing seafood boil restaurant opened its newest location (their tenth location in the Greater Toronto Area) at 16640 Yonge Street, Unit 3!  The King Crab Legs were succulent and huge! Nothing beats the pleasure of cutting open the King Crab Legs with the provided seafood scissors and finding a huge smooth meat of crab leg meat. It was simply amazing with the Captain's Boil sauce (which is a perfect blend of all three sauces -- Cajun, Lemon Pepper, and garlic).  We had such a great time eating through the bag of king crab legs!  After each deshelling of the crab legs, I dipped it into the Captain's Boil sauce before placing it into my mouth.  What further made these king crab legs so good was that the shell of the crab was quite thin, making it easy to cut through with the provided seafood scissors when extracting the meat.  In other words, the crab meat to crab shell ratio was beautiful. :9  The Sizzling Plate Combo contained chicken and the assorted seafood items that I had described above.  This was such a great deal for $10.95.  One person can easily get full on this for lunch.  The seafood was fresh and the rice mixed with the Captain's Boil sauce was again very yummy!  We actually had one of the clams still closed so I informed the server at which point the manager came over to inspect it.  Shortly, the server returned with a clam that was fully cooked and open.  Yay!  Everyone loved the Cajun Seafood Fried Rice too.  It was extremely buttery and the rice was stir fried so well with shrimps too."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the concept! Food was really good and service was on par! Portions were on but we needed 3 bags to get my husband and I full. Would come back"}
{"text":"Very unique concept. Eating with your hands, out of a bag - truly an experience. Don't wear your Sunday best, as it does get very very messy! The sauces are quite spicy. We tried mild, and the heat level really added up. The service is lacking a bit, as well some things on the menu were not available (fried shrimp). Music was loud and wasn't fitting with the overall ambience of the place.  Apart from that, definitely worth the try. All the food was tasty."}
{"text":"Came at lunch and had their combo deal (1lb of shrimp/mussel/clams + potato/corn + beer) and their sizzling plate. The captain's Boil sauce is the way to go: a combo of their other 3 sauces: Cajun, Lemon Pepper, and Garlic in a buttery base.  Fun bibs and plastic gloves to keep you clean"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love eating with their hands/ gloves, no plates, and with a bib??  We went on a Monday night at 8pm and still waited for half an hour. Crazy busy.   Food wise, pricing was reasonable for the quality. Definitely recommend the shrimps and the oysters. They were super fresh and juicy!! We had ordered a lot and still couldn't help it but got a second order of each. As for the sauce, definitely enjoyed the garlic and the captain boils specialty. Lastly, you can't forget an order of Cajun fries (super crispy) and the corn on the cob!!   All in all, service was okay and food was delicious. Definitely worth the hype. Its a must go for seafood lovers! Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I came here yesterday for the first time after wanting to try this place out for a long time. We got seated in a booth right away, it was close to 5 so it wasn't that busy. The bibs, plastic gloves and menus were already placed on the table. It took quite some time for our server to come take our orders even though it wasn't busy at all.   We ended up ordering a pound of mussels, clams and crawfish (seasonal price of 16.95), with the captain boil's sauce mild, as well as a side of Cajun fries. I wish I read the reviews here earlier on, but DO NOT order crawfish! There's very little meat inside and it's like most of the time you're sucking on the shells. Definitely do not recommend! My favourite would have to be the mussels and clams, the sauce really soaked up on them so they're really flavourful. Also mild is actually a bit spicy and has a kick to it. I can't imagine how spicy medium and hot would be (I can't eat spicy food that well).   Although I found the sauce to be flavourful, but I also thought it was a bit too saucy and oily. The oil seeped through my gloves. And towards the end of our meal, I was sick of the sauce and didn't want to do anything with it anymore.   Maybe because of the sauce and the spice itself, my stomach felt really uncomfortable later that night. However, my cousin was fine, it was just me that was having issues. I also wonder just how fresh the seafood are..  Overall, this isn't somewhere I'd go too often - because of yesterday's experience and the price!"}
{"text":"Won't recommend this location. First, I asked for warm water but was served with warm water from the tap. The taste of the sizzling plate and mussels was the worst among the many locations I have been. The clams were smelly. Won't go back.  FYI the management: the location is in Newmarket and the date is April 5 lunch."}
{"text":"A try-once-kind-of place. Decent food and fun group atmosphere. The busy atmosphere lends itself to the overall experience. The hands on approach style of eating makes for many lol moments-not too great for first dates unless you don't care to hind your sloppy ways of pigging out-nothing like seafood served in a bag to bring out the best in you. The menu is very focused but does offer some variance of sizzling dishes. I would recommend to anyone that want an different dining experience. The price is the least appealing factor; it is very pricey for what you get and the wait time for tables is bordering ridiculous. From the offered seafood boiled menu, the shrimp would be the best economical choice-always get the corn...a nice contrast to the salty taste! Overall a nice experience but the price leaves something to be desired. Like I've said....a try-once-kind of place."}
{"text":"dope food dope service cuh. you know I ordered that king crab cus im a king you feel me my g haha. good options especially for the spiciness, there's 4 options (non-spicy, mild, medium and my mixtape aka fire af bruh)"}
{"text":"If your craving for seafood, this is a place to go...I have tried something like this for Vancouver before...  Who needs to go far away if we have it now here in the city. At first I thought it would be a little pricey since it's per pound but I was wrong since the price is very reasonable and the foods are very flavourful...We tried almost everything in the menu and I can say that I like the shrimp and mussels the most more than the lobster, crab and crayfish and as you can taste the flavour the most.  Definitely worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Let's get messy!!   Calling all seafood lovers...you must try this place. It's absolutely delicious and satisfying. My boyfriend and I ordered shrimp, mussels, and snow crab with the captain's boil sauce. It was really flavorful, so flavorful and tasty that I would dunk, slather, and swirl my shrimp in the leftover sauce that was in the bottom of the plastic bag.   My recommendations?   1)Don't wear white or anything that you don't want to get dirty because it  is a very messy meal.   2) Wear the bib! I personally think they are cute, but also practical in catching potential stains from the sauce.  3) Go on random, non peak hours. It's a first come, first serve basis because they do not take reservations. (I went on a Sunday, a bit before noon)"}
{"text":"At first I didn't understand the appeal of eating out of a bags with our hands but, man, this place is awesome! I definitely recommend mixing the shrimp with the captain boil's sauce. Crab legs were also so good! Recommend those with the garlic sauce!   Even the chicken wings were good. Definitely give this place a visit, you won't be let down!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is welcoming. The waiters are friendly. The bib's a bit small. The gloves too big. The shrimps are awesome. The crabs legs are yummy. The captain's boil sauce is highly recommended. The price is average for seafood."}
{"text":"Their seafood friend rice is devine. I gotta learn how to make it so I can eat it all the time"}
{"text":"Went on NYE and the place was absolutely packed on all 3 floors. The wait time was 45 minutes, hostess was nice enough to let us wait for a table away from the door where the people waiting were hovering over the tables.  Once we finally sat down, the food was as advertised. For a table of two we ordered a lb of shrimp and snow crab in the captain boils sauce in medium spicy... But I think our snow crabs for mixed up with the table beside us because ours ended up being very garlicky.. And not spicy, but the table beside us had it too spicy. We didn't notice until the end though.   The best part of the meal was the fried shrimp and Cajun fries, very fresh and hot out of the fryer.   Overall, the experience was great as it was good to get our hands dirty with some deliciously flavoured seafood. Just don't expect it to be a cheap night for what is essentially boiled sauce and seafood."}
{"text":"The food quality was ok.  This restaurant is all about the sauce. As you can tell from the pics, there is nothing else to this other than straight boiling those seafood, which imo is not really the best way to cook seafood.  The captain sauce is spicy, evem if you ask for non spicy.  The lemon sauce was pretty good.   Crayfish is a total waste of money.  Basically after deshelling, the edible part is less than the tip of a pinky size.  Best to order shrimp and mussels.  The mussels are also those sold at chinese supermarket frozen kind boiled with sauce, not the fresh kind.   Came here more for the fun and experience, and for that, it is an experience for a date.  However if you plan on coming here to share food which most likely would be the case given the type of menu.... just make sure your date doesn't have a cold or the flu.  It is pretty unsanitary with everyone dipping their hands (even if in gloves as you eat with the gloves on) into the food bag.    Restaurant:  Bring sunglasses, in case you get seated near the windows.  They don't have drapes and their window faces west.    Tables are closely set together so there were times i accidentally sprayed a shell or sauce onto our next table guests.  Just pretend nothing happened as they also didn't notice.  They probably pretended the same.  Staff: Talked really fast... i know you repeated the menu several times but my first time here and i can't have those seasonal prices memorized with the speed of their talk.  Most value order: One lbs shrimp or mussels and an order of rice to get filled up, and the corn is great balance since the sauce is super salty."}
{"text":"This is the second location I tried. The downtown one was inconvenient on this day so my friend and I made plans to meet uptown for some boil!  We came just before 6 I think and were worried we would have to wait forever (I had waited 3hrs to eat dinner at the downtown location last time haha) however we were lucky and the upstairs was almost completely empty. What I really liked about this location was that the upstairs looked really new and also very clean.   I enjoyed having waitstaff who were eager to take our orders. Perhaps because we were upstairs it did take a tad longer to get our food (I'm comparing to the downtown location which I remember had our food come out really quickly)  The atmosphere was nice. The music wasn't overbearing and I had a great time. The food was just as good as the first time. I definitely recommend coming here just a bit before dinner prime time if you don't want to wait forever haha  Can't wait to go again :)"}
{"text":"Went last night for dinner second time at captains boil and thought the food tasted just as great.  A bit busy had to go an hour earlier and get on the wait list for a spot for 4 but the service was great inside.  Shrimp has great value, wouldn't recommend the crawfish a bit hard to get into and salty taste"}
{"text":"I love the captains boil seasoning on shrimp, mussels, and crab especially! The best part is pouring the leftover sauce onto rice. I once asked if I could buy the sauce and they said no."}
{"text":"A couple of months ago i went to a captains boil for the first time, the food and the experience was outstanding and i had to go back. I came back to the captains boil but this time a different location. The food really is out of this world, all of the flavours are right on and give the customer the option to choose from so many different things. The customer can choose the type of meat they want between crab, muscles clams etc, the flavour if they want more of a plain flavour like a lemon or a mix of everything called captains boil lastly you can also choose the spice that you want on your meat.   The food all comes in plastic backs and you east with you hands. All of the seafood was cooked very well and we loved our captains boil snow crab and our garlic muscles. The only thing that was a slight disappointment to this location was the service. The waitress was very nice don't get me wrong but wasn't really sure what was going on. She had to come over and show us the receipt to make sure she had everything we ordered and had to come back later asking us what we were missing... We only ordered 3 things.   The food is really oily which makes it hard to be the only thing you eat in a night, as it goes right through your body.   Overall the captains boil is a great restaurant for a night out. The food is great and so is the atmosphere of the restaurant. The restaurant is not very busy on weekdays which is good as the food is able to come out really quick."}
{"text":"First time here and came on the recommendation of my daughters. Menu is easy navigate, meat, sauce and temperature. The supplied bibs, gloves and scissors are essential to enjoy the \"hands on\" experience. Had the shrimp and snow crab, Captains Boil Sauce and medium sauce. Temperature was great served hot in the bag! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"2.5 Stars  Food - was okay, not bad (3 stars) Price - was okay as well (3 stars for seafood meal)  The big thing that I don't like about the place is it's extremely environmentally unfriendly.  Your food is served in plastic bags.  You eat with disposable plastic gloves and bibs.  This brought the rating down."}
{"text":"If you want to have a good time and a lot of food I would go to this place. The food is in plastic bags and so it's a cool environment and way to eat food. Go here you will not be disappointed unless you don't enjoy good food and a good time"}
{"text":"Have been here more than a handful of times now. I really like seafood boil restaurants.   Ever since eating at the Crawfish House in Seattle, I had hoped one would pop up in Toronto. This one is same concept of Creole style boil with a slight twist of having Asian inspired spices.  Best part of this restaurant is getting to eat with your hands! It's a lot of fun. But you will smell garlicy after.  Best sauce is the Captain Boil sauce (a mix of all 3) although if you can't handle spice, maybe go for the Garlic.  Spicy means spicy here, so if you just want a little bit of spice, Mild/Medium may suit you.  Ever since they opened up, I see lots of other competitions popping up in Toronto. A good thing in my opinion. But none have beaten the Captain :)."}
{"text":"The Captain's Boil sauce (a combination of their three other flavour options) is super delicious. Mussels were huge (9 or 10 in a pound). Fun and tasty experience. Lunch time was pretty sedate though. I would come again with more people in the evening."}
{"text":"I got the Sizzling Plate Combo with the Seafood Assortment. It was teriyaki fish and rice on a hot plate, plus a bag of 2x (crawfish, shrimp, mussels, clams) - no guarantees that there's a lot/any meat I them. But the lunch special is definitely worth it.  Mild was pretty spicy for me. It's really messy.  Only thing I felt bad about was that there was so much waste - from the plastic bib, gloves, bag of seafood, table \"cloth\" / sheet, napkins and cardboard rim so you don't get burnt from the hot plate. I know it's part of the novelty or else it wouldn't be that special. But I just felt bad for the environment  =("}
{"text":"It's been so long since I've had a seafood boil. My first and only experience (and definitely delicious) was back in Vegas in 2011, so I was definitely due for another seafood boil experience. When I found out about The Captain's Boil, I knew I had to dine here very soon!  We went on a Thursday night at 6:15 and were told it would be about an hour wait. They took our phone number and said they would give us a call when our table was ready. The table was ready at 7 and upon sitting down, we were immediately given bibs, gloves, and a roll of paper towels.  For our first round, we ordered a pound of king crab and mussels, both in the Captain's Boil sauce and mild spice, plus a side of cajun fries. The mussels and king crab arrived relatively quickly, and after a few obligatory selfies in our bibs with the bags of seafood boil, we dug right in! You could definitely taste the Captain's Boil sauce (cajun, lemon pepper, and garlic) in the mussels as the mussels absorbed the sauce and the shell had quite a bit of sauce scooped in. The cajun fries took awhile and arrived when we were almost done both of our boils. At this point, we were ready for another round.   For the second round, we ordered a pound of clams with the garlic sauce and the shrimp in the Captain's Boil sauce. We found the garlic sauce VERY garlicky so we threw our clams with the shrimp to mix in with the Captain's Boil sauce. And just like the mussels, the shrimp soaked up the sauce and making it nice and juicy.   Overall, an enjoyable dining experience. The mussels and shrimp were my favourite as they absorbed the sauce the best, although I personally don't like peeling and \"working\" for my shrimp. While the king crab was nice and meaty, at around $30/lb for a single leg, it'll be hard to justify ordering again on a future visit. The clams were nice, but I would recommend AGAINST ordering the garlic sauce alone, as I still have a garlicky taste in my mouth even after having a few mints and brushing my teeth. The Captain's Boil sauce was a perfect blend, and for someone who has a high tolerance for spice, I found the mild to have a bit of a kick to it.  At almost $90 (after tax and before tip) for two people for four pounds of seafood and a side of fries, I would say the value is great and I would definitely go again. Had we known the downtown location opened the day before, we would've gone to that location as it is more of a convenient location. Although it did take awhile to get refills for our water, the servers were personable and acknowledged the long wait times and somewhat slow service."}
{"text":"What more is there to say that hasn't already been said?  This is the fourth location I've been to of this of this rapidly growing chain and is pretty consistent in food and service. I purchased two Groupons and they were nice enough to accommodate both of them, even though it says in the fine print that it's limited to one per table; they just separated the tables a bit, so that there were two tables (ha!). It was pretty busy for a Wednesday night, but I imagine most of the diners were also redeeming Groupons as it was expiring soon.  The Groupon included 1 lb of mussels, 1 lb of shrimp, cajun fries, and cajun seafood fried rice. If you refer to my previous review, I'm a fan of the mussels and shrimp as I find it absorbs the sauce the best. And I recommend you get the Captain's Boil so that you get the cajun, garlic, and lemon pepper altogether!  Another thing I mentioned in my previous review was that it took awhile to get refills for our water but at this location, there seemed to be one server designated to refill water. And the water was definitely necessary even when ordering medium heat for our mussels and shrimp. The cajun fries had a bit of a kick to them too, and a pretty big portion at $5.95.  Not sure if I would come back to this location specifically, as it is a bit out of the way for me, but I will definitely be back at one of the many Captain's Boil locations."}
{"text":"me and my friend went to this location it had to be the worst service the asian waiter with glasses did not do anything we asked for water and didnt even bring it to us we had to ask twice and for the gloves for the lobster we had to grab ourselves because the gloves didnt work because it only had 1 layer it wasnt even busy at the time he couldnt do anything i dont even know how he got the job knew the owner maybe? at the end i was waving my hand asking for the bill and he was just ignoring me looking into space i dont know whats wrong with this guy we finally get the bill its 60.96 i throw in 61 he sees it and goes would you like the rest of your change? trying to be funny? i said no its good like you dont deserve anything"}
{"text":"First time there after seeing many good reviews. The best deal I think is their lunch combo with seafood assortment. Their dinner main selection are way over priced. We had the crawfish and it wasn't anything we had hope or expected. Besides being spicy, it had no taste. The kids menu was ridiculous that usually kids menu have drink and desert included. Their kids drink is $3 on top of the kids portion of shrimp selection and ice cream is another $4.50. So kids meal can easily being $15. I get seafood is not cheap but really feel like being robbed there."}
{"text":"It's just not pretty to watch all that mess. I felted like attending a clumsy elementary school dinner. They didn't give us water with lemon or wipes to remove the smell of our hands (I removed a glove because I was biting the plastic).  The seafood had good quality. I was excited to watch all those shrimps with head (sucking on their heads was delightful). The lobster was complete as well, I had the chance to eat some of the green stuff in the head that some other places remove. The oysters were a lil too chubby for my taste (I like them flat).  The Cajun fries were crispy in the out and creamy in the insides. My friend from Barcelona found them too spicy, she couldn't stop eating them tho.  The mechanic is simple: Pick the seafood, pick the sauce, and then, the degree of heat you want on your meal.  We tried the Cajun sauce-non spicy, and the Captain's Boil (the mixture of all the sauces) with mild spice. I liked the intense flavors of both options. The Captain's one had a lot of chopped garlic, while the Cajun was challenging to decipher what the main ingredients were.  I'll go back, however, I would appreciate if they stop using that crazy amount of plastic... What about easily washable buckets??"}
{"text":"Definitely a welcome addition to the Toronto food scene. Had dinner here on a Saturday night (8:30pm) a week after they opened. With all the hype surrounding this place, be prepared to wait as I saw a party of 3 try to get a table and were told it would be about 2 hours (they only take reservations for parties of 6 or more). I've haven't tried the seafood boil in the US so I don't have much to compare it to but I enjoyed my experience nonetheless.   We ordered the shrimp, mussels, clams and corn with captain's boil sauce (which is a mix of lemon pepper, garlic and cajun) and non spicy as the heat level. Plus a side of cajun fries. Everything was very good - flavourful and juicy. But my favourite would have to be the mussels as I felt it soaked up the sauce really well. The fries were nice and fresh but could use a little more seasoning. As for value, shrimps are your best bet. They were decent sized and came with quite a bit in a lb as opposed to the clams and mussels which is predominantly shells (especially the clams). Corn was delicious (an order of corn is actually only half a cob)!  Based on the portion I got, I think the prices are relatively reasonable considering that it is seafood but I can't speak for the lobster and crab. (Side note: their menu states Crawfish at \"Seasonal price\" but they actually don't offer it yet. I believe they're still working with their suppliers on that).  I didn't have any problems with the service. Attentive and friendly. When they mixed up our order of clams, they quickly exchanged it and checked back to see if we were happy.   It does get really messy but that's what makes it fun! Certain parts of the shrimp can be pretty sharp which can poke holes through your glove. So my fingertips ended up being filled with sauce anyways but the waitress was nice enough to notice and give me a new one.   I left Captain's Boil satisfied and full. Overall, worth checking out especially with a group of friends!"}
{"text":"A pound of shrimp with the Captain Boil's Seasonings (Cajun, Lemon Pepper, Garlic Sauce) will do you good. The shrimp are huge and everything's marinated in this plastic bag. They give you gloves and a bib cause things can get pretty messy here!"}
{"text":"I learned about the eat-shrimp/crawfish-in-a-bag initially from Kicking Crab in Westminster, CA. Good eat!   I read the reviews for similar establishments in GTA.  I will sua that it is not quite that Louisiana flavour but it ain't bad either.   Never ate at the restaurant itself because of the following reasons: 1. Cheaper to eat at home 2. Easier to eat with cleaner hands 3. Seafood is already more expensive here than our neighbour down south.  4. You can add extra spices at home to make it taste almost similar to the Louisiana flavour.  5. Eat the extra sauce with rice/potatoes.  6. Wait time for take out is ten minutes. Then you are ready to eat! They give us the bibs and gloves anyways, which we don't use.  Will I come again?                 -I did."}
{"text":"I love this place ! The food is Awsom . Really enjoy eating the shrimp with my hands. I recommend the very spicy and sacuse shrimp.. a little pricy but worth every penny"}
{"text":"Made sure i didn't have high expectations when we came in since i'm use to eating at places like these in cali, but this was really good! Everything was tasty, not too salty and not too bland. The spice was spot on (we had medium) and the service was amazing (our server was a friendly asian girl). The difference between medium and mild is very noticeable - mild wasn't spicy at all. Adding lotus roots to the seafood was delicious! We were disappointed they ran out of okra but will definitely be back.  This was well worth the pricy cost that usually comes with satisfying your seafood cravings. People who complain about pricing need to understand that we aren't conveniently located by the coast. This is as good as it gets. They also have a convenient app that sends you a text if you're on the wait list so you can walk around while waiting for a table. Love that we have a place like this around."}
{"text":"This is my second time coming here and this place is still hella packed. Came here on a Sat night around 9pm and it was a 2hr wait! However they do have a system of adding your name to the wait list and texting you when a table is available. My friend and I killed time at the arcade at cineplex and loblaws. The wait wasn't actually 2hrs, it only ended up being an hour long.   For $80 (includes tax + tip) ordered 2lbs of shrimp,1lb of mussels, cajun fries (ask for ranch sauce!), 2 pieces of corn, 2 orders of sausages, 2 bowls of rice and a diet coke AND WAS COMPLETELY STUFFED. Didn't even finish all the sausages/rice/fries.   Flavour: got captains boil in mild for each bag and it was perfect. i suggest getting an order of (cajun) fries just so you have something to change the taste/flavour up.   SERVICE:  - ok service straight up sucked but i love this place too much to only give it 3 stars.   - they forgot to put a corn in my friends bag and forgot to bring us our rice  - when i asked for ranch sauce they kept forgetting to actually bring it and when they did, it was friggen mayo  TIPS:  - they give you lime with a bowl of salt & pepper. they don't really explain what to do with this, I made the foolish mistake of squeezing the lime into my shrimp bag and not even noticing the salt & pepper. WHAT YOU SHOULD DO is ask for extra lime and squeeze all those babies into the bowl and dip your shrimp/seafood in the sauced up bag and then into the lime bowl - SOOOO good trussssssss miii  - ask for ranch sauce (its free!) for your cajun fries, it makes all the difference  overall i'm probably going to eat here as often as i go for sushi (once a month). dinner here does hurt your wallet but i think its worth it - completely full and satisfied. the music is really good too! they just need to improve their service and make the pop refillable (canned pop - like whats that about)"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with a friend. Normally I'd go to the Vaughan location but we decided to go to this location instead.  The experience here has been mediocre. My friend ordered fish and chips while I ordered the sizzling platter. They gave us mayo to go with the fish and chips so my friend had to ask for tarter sauce twice because he forgot.  My sizzling plate tasted okay... it would've tasted better if the rice wasn't undercooked.  While we were eating customers came in while it was windy so the table setting flew off the table and at us. I picked most of it up after 5mins because none of the servers bothered to come clean it up. A server did come about 15-20mins after to reset the table.   Next time I crave Captains Boil I will most likely go to the Vaughan location and not this one."}
{"text":"This place is my go to for when I'm craving seafood boil.  The service: Very friendly, the vibe I get from this place is family oriented. There wasn't a set server for each section of the restaurant like how it is with traditional restaurants. Everyone just works together which is pretty nice.   The food: My go to here is snow crab legs. I normally don't eat seafood except for the occasional craving of snow crab legs. I typically get 1lb snow crabs in mild captains boil sauce and an order of fries to share. These two orders are enough to fill me up but not for my dinner companions.   Ive yet to try the lunch special but it seems like a really good deal. I'll definitely be coming back and recommending Captains Boil Vaughan to others!"}
{"text":"I went to Captain's Boil. on a lunch day, they had a very good lunch combo deal for 8.99 with chicken teriyaki and an assortment of captain boil seafood in captain boil sauce. We had also ordered a pound of shrimp in cajun sauce. Trying the food, it was pretty decent, the price and sauce was pretty okay, considering in terms of shrimp. Some of the other items i saw were a little too pricey and didn't seem to be as worth it. but if you stick to shrimp and that lunch special you can't really go wrong, the best thing is to mix the captain boil sauce with your rice, as the flavor is a perfect rice mixer. I feel like one problem is that the seafood itself is not as fresh as it could be, although i think that is probably because they assume the sauce which has a very heavy flavor would cover it.   i would recommend others to try it at least. and overall the dining experience was okay, it seems like a better restaurant to be enjoyed with a group of people moreso than just 2 people. Overall there isn't much to write about other dishes as i have yet to try them, but will endeavour to go with a bigger group to try it at some point in which it may or may not change this review"}
{"text":"This is a very interesting restaurant. Everything is hand handling besides the rice. The food is very good because the spice is good. The king crab was the best of all. It's messy but enjoyable. We could try again in the future!"}
{"text":"I went to Captain's Boil to throw a surprise party for my friend, and I must say, the service we received this time was amazing.  I went early to set up decorations, and the waitress helped me put up streamers as well as provided me with tape and candles for the cake we had.  She also took the cake in the back so that when we asked her to, she would bring it out to surprise our friend.  The service the entire time was friendly and helpful!  The food, as always, was great.  I recommend adding corn to your bag of seafood next time, because the sauce makes the corn taste amazing.  I also recommend trying the new lobster roll.  Although the portion is small, (as with most lobster rolls), it tastes soooo good.  It comes with a side of fries as well as a lobster bisque.    And of course, one can't go to Captain's Boil without getting the Cajun rice.  Tip: put the Captain's Boil sauce from your seafood bag onto your Cajun Rice.  It makes it taste so much better!"}
{"text":"I was hesitant to try Captains Boil - I'm honestly not sure why, they have done a fabulous job renovating and it's super clean...  - when we finally tried it... WE LOVED IT! Super fun atmosphere, delish food, and good service. Friday night is half price wine!!!!! My husband usually builds his own boil, and I'm a sucker for the sizzle plate. Good prices - very clean - good for date night or family fun. TIP: don't be afraid to use the gloves ;)"}
{"text":"We went to a fantastic seafood boil restuarant in Chicago called The Angry Crab and it was outstanding both in terms of food and atmosphere.  When we noticed that new chain of seafood boils (with the exact same menu and concept ...) had opened in Toronto we were excited to try it.  I am sorry to report, however, that the food was absolutely horrible.  One of the worst meals I have had in the last 365 days (and that includes my own cooking).  We ordered 1lb of clams in garlic sauce, 1lb of mussels in captain's boil sauce, 1lb of shrimp in garlic sauce, and 1lb of shrip in captain's boil sauce for a total of approx $90.  The food was disgusting: 1) OILY ... all the food was coated in and dripping with heart attack inducing amounts of oil. 2) FLAVOURLESS ... both flavours we tried and ordered in various spice levels had no flavor.  Just the taste of oil. 3) 1LB of CLAMS WAS MAINLY SHELLS ... most of the clams had fallen out of the shells so the bag was full of empty shells, we only found 5 clams total. 4) EVEN THE VEGETABLES WERE OLD ... for example, the corn that we added to the bags was old and shrivelled.  And drowned in oil - the okra was basically just an oil sponge. 4) the only decent item was the side of garlic bread we ordered  A thorough waste of money and calories.  We ended up throwing out most of the meal bc it was basically just oil.  Do yourself a favour, save your money and skip The Captain's Boil."}

Just the taste of oil. 3) 1LB of CLAMS WAS MAINLY SHELLS ... most of the clams had fallen out of the shells so the bag was full of empty shells, we only found 5 clams total. 4) EVEN THE VEGETABLES WERE OLD ... for example, the corn that we added to the bags was old and shrivelled.  And drowned in oil - the okra was basically just an oil sponge. 4) the only decent item was the side of garlic bread we ordered  A thorough waste of money and calories.  We ended up throwing out most of the meal bc it was basically just oil.  Do yourself a favour, save your money and skip The Captain's Boil."}
{"text":"We went to a fantastic seafood boil restuarant in Chicago called The Angry Crab and it was outstanding both in terms of food and atmosphere.  When we noticed that new chain of seafood boils (with the exact same menu and concept ...) had opened in Toronto we were excited to try it.  I am sorry to report, however, that the food was absolutely horrible.  One of the worst meals I have had in the last 365 days (and that includes my own cooking).  We ordered 1lb of clams in garlic sauce, 1lb of mussels in captain's boil sauce, 1lb of shrimp in garlic sauce, and 1lb of shrip in captain's boil sauce for a total of approx $90.  The food was disgusting: 1) OILY ... all the food was coated in and dripping with heart attack inducing amounts of oil. 2) FLAVOURLESS ... both flavours we tried and ordered in various spice levels had no flavor.

{"text":"I was very impressed with the freshness of the seafood of this location. One of your servers named Rhoelin made it a comfortable experience and her personally made everything enjoyable. I have never cracked a crab leg before and she explained it well. Of all the captain's boil I've been too, this is my favourite. The place is super clean and everyone is friendly."}
{"text":"Yesterday was my first time going and I'm already craving another round! I love the concept of just eating with your hands and the whole experience was fun. Stepping outside the box vs fancy dinner with 12 different kinds of forks/spoons lol just dig in with your hands! Service was fantastic, food was delicious and everything came out quickly. I do however wish more crab legs came in a bag and wish there was a certain price to do an all you can eat option. I was spending more than I could afford to get full and I never left being entirely full. Either way, it's a good treat and will return."}
{"text":"so glad Captain's boil has opened up all across the city! I no longer have to go to the states to enjoy delicious seafood. Love the crawfish, alaskan king crab legs, and sometimes they have specials with fresh whole lobster and live crab!!! the fresher the better"}
{"text":"Went here as a group of 4 and ordered 2 pounds of mussels, clams and a pound of snow crab legs in medium spicy Captain's Boil sauce, as well as their cajun fries.   I don't usually like spicy food, but I thought that medium spicy was bearable. The food itself was very tasty (especially the snow crab legs!) but I did find the serving size to be a little small for the price. The cajun fries was very crispy, and very satisfying when dipped in ketchup and Captains Boil sauce.   One of us was on a keto diet, and the restaurant was quite accommodating in serving the seafood plain with a side of garlic and melted butter.   All in all, food tasted good, wish it was more filling for the price, service was good and I will probably return."}
{"text":"with all the hype going on, i needed to try this place for myself.  hype-  New experience eating seafood out of plastic bags with a sailor moon bib (what i like to call it) and the most rip-able gloves   sauce: we ordered different sauces for each lb of seafood and concluded that they all taste similar once you've tasted the captains boil (since its a mixture of all the sauces) *for those who do not eat butter, do not get the garlic sauce. its just butter and loads of garlic! (man do i love the chunks of garlic!) **mild seems to be a bit more than a kick for me, so go down a notch  Quality: king crabs legs were bomb, full of juicy meat! (1lb per person), clams were good as well. Shrimp were not as fresh since there were some mushy ones in my bag =/  super sad that they were out of craw fish on a thursday night! T_T   atmosphere: upstairs was bright and loud, downstairs was dim, quiet! I was seated downstairs and I wasn't very impressed because the ventilation wasn't that good and felt very warm. Thank god there was a TV at least or else it would've felt very sketchy.   verdict: go for the experience not for the value.   Tips: make reservations or go early & maybe not the best place to go on a first date, its pretty messy!"}
{"text":"By far one of my favourite spots to go with friends. At atmosphere is fun and entertaining. Not only the atmosphere but the people around and especially... The finger licking seafood! it's an awesome place to get your hands and face dirty.   The servers were very nice and checked up on us occasionally. And for the price point, the price was very good for what you are getting. Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I had been waiting for so long to try Captain's Boil and it did not disappoint.  I ordered the shrimp in the Captain's Boil, mussels in the Captain's boil, crawfish in the Captain's boil, corn on the cob and fries. Starting off with the crawfish, it was my first time trying the crustacean. They were a little hard to eat and had very little meat in them, so considering the night that I went that they were at the market price of $16.95 for the pound, I think I would pass on them next time. The shrimp and mussels however were amazing.  The portions are huge and easily sharable. I was in a group of three and we got one bag each of the seafood mentioned above.  Make sure you get the corn on the cob inside the bag. The fries tasted like Costco fries which I have no problem with at all, they made a great side and provided a nice change in texture in comparison to all of the seafood.  Keep in mind even with the gloves provided (which are huge), your hands will still get oily.   The service was great both times I have gone. The staff was friendly and the food arrived at the table shortly after ordering. In fact I'm almost certain it took us longer to decide what to order than it did for the food to come to the table."}
{"text":"The server we had was lovely and that was the only good thing about this restaurant.Sorry to say this was the most disgusting restaurant I've ever been to. They should advertise that you eat out of a plastic bag that you have no idea where the bag has been. Everything is plastic or styrofoam. When my mussels came half of them were empty so your paying for all the liquid in the bag not the mussels.  I needed to wash my hands as I was covered in sauce so the manager told me where the sink was at the back of the restaurant and both don't work. Apparently the female manager had a discussion with my son in my absence and suggested I had alcohol on my breath which I didn't and I may pursue legal action against her.  If you like to eat with a fork and knife and you like a plate I wouldn't suggest not eating at this place, it is horrible. I felt like an animal at a trough. They charge way too much to have plastic and the food is in a plastic bag.  YUK!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. We had a reservation booked for 8pm and we still had to wait an hour before we got seated. The food was nothing out of the ordinary as it is basically seafood soaked in a sauce. 1 pound of king crab leg basically equals to one leg. Also because everything is based on weight, most of the items on their menu has shells on it, which adds onto the weight so the portion you get to eat is not a lot. Although they gave us fries on the house because we had to wait so long, I definitely won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I'll give a basic negative/positive review   Positive - the team - cheerful, friendly , at tentative, knowledgeable, courteous, helpful and genuine   Negative- no cutlery (I know this is the point however I'd like something to help dig out the meat from the lobster/crab claws  Positive - price was in my opinion very reasonable For the amount you get   Negative - sides should be that ..... On the Side, not stuck in the bag with your seafood, I wasn't aware this came in such a way  Positive - being able to get messy with your hands and no one looking at you disapprovingly as they are all digging in   Negative - from the menu you don't get a sense of how much food you will be getting so you're not sure how much to order especially on the sides   Positives - decor is nice inside, clean and have a handy washing station to clean you're messed up face   I do want to go back to the team for this location as for me it was the best part of the experience ..... Everyone of them were so happy to be serving you it really made the evening worth the money before you get to the food, which for me was delightful however my partner dos thing the sauce was lacking a little flavour on her choice"}
{"text":"Been here for the first time and it exceeded my expectations. Everything including the special house sauce and seafood quality were on par or better than what I could get in other good seafood restaurants. Service was also impressive. Thanks Nia and Amir!  I look forward to coming back again!"}
{"text":"Came here with my husband for lunch a couple weeks ago. We showed up just after 1:30 and it was pretty empty when we got there, except for a big birthday party that was waiting for people to arrive. We ordered shrimp, lobster and dungeness crab with captain's boil seasoning (a mix of all 3 of their seasonings), and it was REALLY good. The shrimp was a good size, and the lobster and crab were both 1.5lbs each. We also got the cajun fried rice, which had really amazing flavour. We ordered one more rice to go because we liked it that much.  Our server was awesome, cheery, and knowledgeable. We were served everything quickly, but I think we got lucky in that area. Once everyone from the big birthday party arrived, service became so slow that three parties walked out - two due to lack of service, and one because I think they just weren't into the menu. One more party was about to leave, but they stuck it out and got their orders in. There were three people on the floor, but it seemed like only one of them was covering all the tables, including the birthday party. It seemed like the other two didn't really help pick up the slack until people started complaining.  We'll be back...hopefully we'll get the same quick service."}
{"text":"Just a hype. I tried the Cajun fries, mussels with garlic sauce, lobster,snow crab,king crab, shrimp and crawfish with all of captain boils signature sauce. I do have to comment that everything was overly salted. It was however I great new experience. I would recommend the shrimps mussels and snow crab. The king crab was a rip off as you only get 3 pieces."}
{"text":"The night started off with great service. The décor and ambience is great.  The seafood is served in bags, a cajun-asian inspired boil. The shrimps, snow crab legs and mussels were absolutely delicious. This is the perfect place for anyone who loves spice and seafood, the location is very spacious, we did not wait for a table !"}
{"text":"The food was really salty. Really cool concept with the seafood in the bags. The flavour is not that impressive. \"Not spicy\" is actually spicy, so I can't imagine how spicy \"fire\" is. The servers are really friendly and the place is really small and crammed."}
{"text":"This is my first time trying The Captain's Boil after the massive Chain open up and the thousands of photographs that appear online from The Captain's Boil, and boy, I've gotta say, I'm quite impressed! I highly recommend making reservations when you come - especially if you're coming on Friday nights, Saturdays and Sundays!  Walking in, I wasn't super impressed with the service we received. There appears to only be one person who answers the phone and in addition, this is the person who is the host(ess). Even though we had reservations, we had to wait for the person to finish coming off the phone before seating the many parties that were waiting. However, the service after you have seated is quite good because there are many people who serve you.  At the tables, there are plastic gloves and cute pirate costume bibs for you to wear. There are only two types of rice - a seafood fried rice that was slightly spicy and a meat (chicken, beef or fish) with white rice. Both of these, I believe were $10.95. The garlic bread came in a basket of three pieces for $3-$4 - this frozen garlic bread, you can purchase in supermarkets. We also got the calamari, which were mainly of the tentacles (I actually liked this better than the top section that's usually served from calamari). The calamari also came in a basket in a decent size for it's cost. The oysters were $16 (they're market price) for 6. These oysters are much larger than the regular ones you get on Tuesday or Wednesday night specials at bars, and had a slightly larger fishy stench than the oysters I have. They also only gave three types of sauces, which I didn't think was super worth.  For seafood, you choose the number of pounds of that particular seafood you would like to have, then you choose how it's cooked (garlic, cajun, garlic and cajun and I believe there was one more option). Some of these seafood are market price, so you would have to ask at the time of. Lastly you choose the level of spice - I recommend mild! The seafood comes really quickly in plastic bags. Something I really like about this place is that they don't like about the amount of pounds of seafood you are served! We ordered a pound of clams, and we felt like there was more than a pound! The lobster only came as 2lb and it was $40 for this, which is fairly reasonable at this cost.  The gloves are a clever idea to not have your guests get their hands dirty, while really grubbing into the meal. In addition, you get a whole roll of paper towel along with your meal in case things get really messy!"}
{"text":"Food was okay (the taste of the seafood was overpowered by butter and sauce), but the experience was fun. We are definitely glad we tried it (sort of). The main problem we had was the amount of garbage created from one single table. One 6 person table filled up an industrial garbage can. Everything that you use there is non-reusable ... From the bags and bibs, to spoons, to styrofoam bowls, to drinking cups and table mats. All VERY wasteful and not helping the environment. We'd love to come back, but only if they improve on their waste practices."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of my friends for a get together dinner. We were 8 people so was able to make a reservation.  However, even if you made a reservation,  they aren't going to seat you until most/all your party is present. It was a good thing that we were able to make a reservation because the line up at the door was extremely long. Our server was very helpful and friendly. I would have to say the service level was good. The food on the other hand, I thought it was only average. In my opinion, this place is fun for a group of friends. But they didn't have everything that was listed on their menu - for instance, they were out of snow crab legs, and two other items when  I was there. The prices per pound was pricey too. Overall, this place was fun but in my opinion, there are other seafood places that I have been to that are better."}
{"text":"TLDR: Food arrives hot and fast. Mild captain's boil sauce isn't spicy at all. The garlic sauce is packed full of garlic and is pretty salty. Fries are good. Don't wear nice clothes here - you'll leave smelling of fish.   What I Liked: Extremely quick service - For small parties during off-peak hours (i.e. anytime that's not a socially designated mealtime hour), expect to be seated fairly quickly. After my friend and I were seated (under 2 minutes) and had ordered, our food (1lb shrimp, 1lb clams) arrived at our table in under 12 minutes.  Portion sizes - 1lb of seafood is enough to fill up the average diner without causing the \"-itis\".  Cajun fries - while they weren't especially \"Cajun\" (to me, they didn't have any distinct flavour other than salty), they were crispy and came in a good size for 2 people.   What I Didn't Like: Smell - Obviously, I knew this was a seafood centric restaurant. However, the entire place smelled super fishy.  Shell disposal - There was no bucket/bin provided to dispose of leftover shells.  Paper towel dispensing - Each table is given a paper towel roll to wipe up messes . However, it would be more convenient for the diners to have the paper towel roll on some kind of stand/dispenser to make tearing off sheets easier. The way it is now, the tops of the paper towel roll get dirty from people holding it in order to tear it."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a place for seafood, this is definitely the place to go. Although things might get messy, thats the fun part! They give you gloves and bib just in case the sauce gets onto your clothes. The service is fast and friendly. I would recommend getting the captains boil sauce which is the combination of all the sauces they have. The pricing is fairly decent and affordable if you're looking for some great seafood. The interior layout isn't so bad and makes you feel comfortable when you're eating. The only downside of ordering some of the seafood is the clams sometimes are very small and you get very little meat in the inside and sometimes the mussels aren't fresh (only a couple) but how would you know to pinpoint the non so fresh ones when your cooking it. And also ordered takeout of mussels with the combination of all the sauces and it was very dry and very little sauce which was a disappointment. Other than these unfortunate situations i would recommend this place to grab seafood!"}
{"text":"Everything was amazing. I really want to try the King Crab ! The Cajun fries are really salty but It's nice to balance it out with the saucy goodness from the bags of seafood you receive. The \"Fire\" hot sauce is no where near as spicy as they try to intimidate - but I'm a spicenaut so tell me otherwise  if you gon try it. Definitely a good place to get your seafood fix. The Mussels were my favourite but I really want to try that crawfish"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and good service! I was really looking forward to dining here as there is nothing close to \"The Boiling Crab\" or \"Hot and Juicy\" here in Toronto until \"The Captain's Boil\". Captain's seafood boil is on par with the American versions.  Food: My party ordered the clams, shrimp, mussels, king crab, lobster and cajun fries. The BEST item was the clam!!! Very juicy and soaked up all the sauce. The shrimp is also a good go to item because it is very easy to eat and juicy. Also ordered some corn, $1, which was tossed in the bag to soak up the sauce. All of the food was served in plastic bags that you can dig right into using your hands (or gloves provided).   Sauce: Order the Captain's Sauce, which is a combination of all three lemon/pepper, cajun and butter. But be aware as their spicy is SPICY!!! I usually love a good kick, and would recommend going for mild.   Service: Make reservations!!!... But unfortunately, they only take reservations for parties of 6 or more. I recommend coming early. Went on a Friday at 7:30pm and other patrons were told there was a 2 hour wait for a table for two. Luckily for us, we made reservations and only had to wait about 10 minutes for our table. Servers were attentive, frequently refilling our waters. The food came out in random sequences, but I think that's because we all ordered different levels of spices. One order was missing corn/sausage but that was eventually brought out.  Atmosphere: The restaurant is three levels and has moderate space. We got seated on the main floor and it was cosy with a modern nautical theme. The tables are lined with brown paper so you can throw your waste right there. There are tables in the basement next to the bathroom, I wouldn't want to eat down there... But hey, if you're desperate! There are plenty of TV's on the main and basement to catch any game.  I'm already anticipating my next visit! Can't wait to come back when they have crawfish."}
{"text":"The food was amazing, fast and yummy! Had lots of shrimp, and the seafood fried rice was good.   Must try!"}
{"text":"YUMMY I LOVE IT I got shrimp mussels and clams with the mild spice captain boils sauce and it was awesome  had good flavour and the seafood was awesome I would have to say my favourite was the shrimp but make sure you get rice because it can be salty  also you should add corn but you can pass on the potatoes  prices are average  a negative is the waste of plastic and paper cause they throw away everything  overall I would say you should definitely try it !!"}
{"text":"I love this place!!! My boyfriend took me here yesterday for the first time. We ordered 1lb mussels, fish teriyaki, and one live snow crab in captain boils sauce. Best thing ever!!! The crab is so fresh and the mussels are huge! I can't wait to go back. It find it a little bit pricey but it's well worth it. Cravings satisfied."}
{"text":"Came here on Sunday at 6pm for family dinner. The place was busy but we were lucky to get a table right away. There's limited parking and the restaurant itself is small.   We ordered two of the clams, shrimp, king crab, muscles, shrimp fried rice and deep fried shrimp basket and 5 side corns and it cost $290. We got mild and fire hot all captain boil sauce. The flavour was really good. I only ate the mild but by the end it got really really spicy!!! The service was okay, we felt rushed to eat and get out since it was getting busy. Overall it was a fun experience and evening with the fam jam!"}
{"text":"My favourite place when I'm craving seafood, and not so much sushi. Food is absolutely delicious. Food is served in bags of sauce heated to perfection, and is rather decently priced. You can choose your level of spice and the type of sauce (Captain's Boil sauce is the best) and feast upon the food with your hands. They provide bibs and gloves so why not play with your food?  Even if you're not a big seafood eater, they do have other options including chicken tenders (deliciously seasoned) and teriyaki fried rice. All options are delicious.   P.S. Cajun fries are the best thing to have ever been created."}
{"text":"Great for seafood lovers and non-seafood lovers alike (but more for seafood lovers)! This location is just south of Yonge and Finch and gets very busy. Avoid coming at peak times, unless you want to wait 20-40 minutes - and there is no waiting area, so you'll either have to wait outside or inside the korean supermarket next door. Each table comes with a bib for everyone (wear it), plastic gloves (wear it), and a paper towel roll. It's kind of gross when you see the paper towel roll with sauce all over the top or bottom from the previous diners. There are TVs to watch the local game or news and I really enjoy the R&B music in the background.  In comparison to similar restaurants in Toronto and Chicago, I would rate this better because: 1) it's slightly cheaper; and 2) flavour is better. Be warned, theres a huge spice difference between mild and medium. As sad as this sounds, I actually like their chicken tenders and fries the most here. Portions are massive and fries are crispy on the outside but tender on the inside. You can ask for fries to be cajun or regular.  My only suggestion to this business is PLEASE invest in reusable dinnerware! It kills me (and the environment) to see all water/pop/drinks being poured in disposable cups to everyone every time we go.. And whenever we order rice, it's served in a disposable styrofoam cup too! AH!"}
{"text":"It used to be my favorite seafood restaurant   I used to visit captains boil at least once a week. Well no more. Service has gone downhill considerably, specially at the Yonge and college location. The waiters try really hard to ignore customers and are often rude and unwelcoming. The last straw was when I was given oysters 1/3 of the size they regularly serve and expected me to pay the same prize. Well no more. I believe that for the prize I can get better food somewhere else and much better service."}
{"text":"Tie that bib tightly because if it slips off, the mess on your gloves won't help you fix the problem. Cut my thumb on a snow crab leg but both those and the shrimp were a good feed. The Sapporo was good and cold and the service was attentive."}
{"text":"Finally have one in Mississauga.Always like shrimp with corn and potato. And I feel the website is very clear and fast to order. You can choose the exact time for the order to pick up. And there is 10% discount online."}
{"text":"Went here recently for a birthday. Definitely make reservations for weekends, gets pretty busy. Ordered a pound of shrimp, snow crab legs, and lobster, with corn and sweet potato fries on the side. Bill was pretty reasonable for 2 people and for the amount we got. I would be careful with the sauce, I can eat spicy but the medium for me was super spicy. The captains boil sauce is great, definitely not like boiling crab but comparable. Only complaint is that the tables are way too tiny. All our food was brought out at once and we had no room so we had to put everything in the same bag to conserve space. A special feature I like is that they have a hand washing station outside of the washroom. I probably wouldn't go back unless it was someone's birthday just because I prefer my seafood boiled instead of steamed. Makes it easier to get inside the shell."}
{"text":"Ordered King Crab Legs (great but expensive), Snow Crab Legs (skinny and not worth it), Crawfish (totally not worth it), and shrimp (best value) along with potatoes and corn (both great). Captain's Boil flavour and medium spicy. Service was slow and lacking. Water refills rare. I would come back again but only order the shrimp with corn and potatoes."}
{"text":"Such a simple, yet delicious concept for fresh seafood delivered right to your table.    All is charged by the pound end depends what your ordering.   All freshly boiled seafood comes in a plastic biodegradable bag and is great for ordering a variety and sharing with others. 3 different levels of spicy to add as well might i mention.    Service is prompt and napkins are of plenty.    Put on the cute big and get cracking."}
{"text":"I love Boils, my favourite place is Hot N' Juicy Crawfish in Vegas which is is a MUST when I go to LV. I was so looking forward to trying this place. Weekends the line ups are long and there are no reservations. I managed by going before the regular dinner crowd around 5 p.m. It's basically seafood, boiled in a bag with their blend of spices and it literally comes in a bag and handy gloves for you to dig in and eat with your hands. I believe that there is no better way to enjoy seafood, especially shrimp when you have to peel and eat it. I'm only giving this place a 3 because the seafood is not the freshest but overall including the portions, cost and flavours and service it's an OK place and I would go again. I had the Shrimp with the Captain's boil blend of spices at Fire heat. The flavours were great and Fire level of heat was just right, it has a nice warm burn but not gasping. The server was good enough to tell me that they had a Volcano level of heat that wasn't on the menu and if I wanted something truly hot it was available. Fresh shrimp at it's finest has a certain \"crunch\" to it, there's no other way to describe it and their shrimp didn't have that crunch; if you've had fresh shrimp you will understand what I mean. Since seafood is the main fare of this place, freshness is a MUST so for this reason i rate the food at around 2 to 2.5 as it wasn't the freshest of seafood. Service is pleasant. The place is simple and really it's put on your bib and get eating so doing anything else that is not food related is restricted unless you want to spread sauce and juices all over the place. It's street parking so be prepared to walk a couple of blocks."}
{"text":"I've seen so many pictures on social media of the delicious seafood offerings and unfortunately missed the Yelp Elite event at Captain's Boil earlier this year. I felt the time was long overdue to check out Captain's Boil, and none better than at this newest location which recently opened up in Richmond Hill.  I called to make a reservation for our party of 11 earlier in the day and was initially told that they would not be able to accommodate us at a single table/area but rather would need to divide our group. However they were thankfully able to seat us together in the end.  The decor is clean and contemporary with lots of wood details including two large woodworked murals on opposite sides of the space. The light fixtures are interesting with some nods to nautical themes.  We ordered shrimp, mussels, clams, corn, lotus root, and sausages in several of the sauces, which includes lemon pepper, garlic, and Captain's Boil signature sauce which combines the former two flavours with Cajun seasoning. We also ordered steamed rice, sweet potato fries, and the Cajun seafood fried rice. Having tasted the shrimp, mussels, and sausage, I can vouch that these were flavourful and not at all overcooked. In my opinion, your best bang for your buck is with the shrimp as all seafood is priced per pound (shells on). The Cajun seafood fried rice packed lots of flavour. If you're spice intolerant, be sure to specify mild or no spice, and you may be better off sticking to garlic seasoning.   One of the things that kind of bothers me about this place is that everything is served in either styrofoam bowls or plastic bags with plastic cutlery.  They also give you plastic gloves to 'cleanly' eat your seafood with. I realize that this makes it easier for the restaurant to dispose of everything at the end of each meal, but it does carry significant environmental impact.   From opening to 4pm, they have a special of either fish or chicken teriyaki with rice (udon for extra charge) for $10.99, which also comes with two pieces each of crayfish, shrimp, mussels, and clams. This is a great value considering that a pound of shrimp will cost you $12.95 per lb and it doesn't come with any sides. Looking forward to coming back to try their lunch special. 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"I got really bad food poisoning from here Fml. I was at the restaurant on Monday April 18 with a friend, at 2 pm ordered the shrimp. I threw up on my ride home it's Friday now and My stomach still feels fuxked  will go to the doctors tomorrow."}
{"text":"I had a fun experience here.  The food was very tasty and the experience of eating with a bib and gloves was definitely a change from other restaurants - I recommend it to go at least once to try it out.  For me, it was very reminiscent of Bubba Gump Shrimps in California.  It's a little pricey however so watch out for that.  Food: 4/5, we got the shrimp and mussels with corn in both.  One with captain boil's sauce and the other in lemon/garlic.  The captain boil's sauce is quite spicy so watch out.  We also got the cajun fries and while it was great, it was SUPER spicy.  I recommend you get medium if you want spicy and go for the spicy if you can really handle it.  The mussels were A LOT better than the shrimps.  I may want to try the crawlfish next time.  Service: 3/5, nothing out the ordinary, the guy comes and you see him at the end.  It's just like other restaurants - not much \"service\" here.  Ambiance: 3/5, fun atmosphere with music and great seating for chats/hanging out.  The downtown location also seems to have more space the north york one so I would recommend coming to this one.  Price: 1/5, fails a bit here as it can be $30+ per person which is higher versus other similar types of restaurant level and you may say that going to a higher-end is better. It's not a place to go often but worth a try."}
{"text":"omg Love this place! For a sea-food maniac like myself, this is close to heaven as it gets.  everything here is delicious and fresh - from snow legs to crawfish, from shrimps to mussel, just order whatever and eat it with your bib, your hands, and it's on! :)  it's messy, it's delicious, it's spicy. Hot is actually sooo hot because they use ghost pepper! I tried to use gloves in the beginning but realized it wasn't worth it, they rip with the shrimp shells anyway - bare hands work best!  don't expect nice china or fork, don't expect salads or cute-tsy food, Oh also, it's probably not a \"first date\" place - there's just no pretty way of getting through this. Do expect: flavor, yum, over the top taste bud explosions. This is where ppl show their true colors, and you should know not to get in the way between me and my shrimp!  Recommended!"}
{"text":"Mediocre food. Came for a quick lunch with a friend in between classes. We both ordered the fish teriyaki (with seafood platter) lunch special for $10.95. Came with white rice topped with a few specks of corn and scallions, fish coated with too many greasy batter, a few large whole shrimps, 4 mini clams, and 2 giant ass mussels (yum). I couldn't have any of the sauces since all contained butter and I'm pretty sensitive to dairy products, but I did have the hot sauce (spicy level 3) and holy crap it was really spicy!!   Price was pretty good for seafood, but food presentation and taste was pretty disappointing. The photos on their website looked way better and the actual platter today did not come with crayfish. The clams were also too small (where is the meat??) and the fish was 90% batter.  Next time might try ordering a bag of seafood and try some of their sides (lotus root, okra, etc.)"}
{"text":"Came here at 5 so there wasn't really a line up:) food came quickly we ordered 1lb snow crab and the seafood fried rice. Loved it! It's a pretty interesting dining experience- the table gets really messy at the end so make sure you don't wear a white shirt haha. The only thing is the food is pretty spicy even you don't add extra spice.. So I wouldn't recommend if you don't like eating spice:).  Come earlier so you can skip the lines! Or make a reservation."}
{"text":"My DC and I were super-excited about going to this place. I love The Boil in Lower East Side. How did I miss Toronto Boil for a whole year?!  My visit was very disappointing, 1 star. But I want this place to do well, and the problem might be inexperienced staff who are learning the ropes (we did go before the official opening), so I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt.  In short, there was WAY WAY too much butter in the bag and it made the boil gross. You might think that you can't have too much butter, but you can, and it is disgusting.  We asked nicely about this. Our server told us that the kitchen said they put half the normal amount of butter. Checking out other people's boil on the way, it didn't seem like anyone had anywhere as much as we did.  Our server didn't offer any remedy, and being nice Canadians, we didn't ask for one. But my DC is never, ever going back to this place and I had a bad stomach ache. It's too bad, the okra was really tasty, once I scraped all of the gross goo off, the portions were generous, and the price was great for snow crab. Hopefully they get their act together.  If you do decide to go, ask for low butter and send it back immediately if it looks gross. Seriously, don't be nice, they need to learn not to serve gross food."}
{"text":"recommend this restaurant, very satisfied with food,service and $$ worth it.. must try ..went here tonight for my mom's bday. place is so busy, love the food and people/server are very polite ,fast . make sure to make reservation so u don't have to wait to be seated .."}
{"text":"The food was not good. I had the lobster in butter & garlic sauce. Wife had king crab legs in the same sauce. The butter was margarine-y & the garlic was that pre-chopped, packed-in-oil stuff. GROSS.  The whole eating with your hands out of a bag thing is ridiculous. We had ordered a bowl of white rice to share with our meals. This is served with one plastic spoon in a Styrofoam bowl. How can we eat with only one spoon between us? Why Styrofoam & plastic spoons. Ridiculous to the extreme.  Will never, ever return. Cannot fathom how this place could get any positive reviews."}
{"text":"I Love this place. I love the quality of seafood, I love the sauce, and the heat when you go for Fire level. I also love their cajun fries. I come here very often, and always take the fries, Shrimps and Mussels in their mix flavour sauce, and choose Fire - as level of heat. I tried their oysters also, real good. Will keep coming back."}
{"text":"Cajun fries are just ok. Seafood I asked for was super spicy when I asked for medium spicy. Food had lots of flavour. Place is small but not busy during afternoon. Would definitely go back for more. Great addition to the area and something different."}
{"text":"Although it's no boiling crab, it's the best Cajun seafood place to go!  Captains boil was the first place to open in toronto as a Cajun seafood bar. All the others soon followed.   The shrimp is my favourite. I have had the king crab legs and they're okay. If there are any body builders king crab is one of the best protein options you can get. The captain boil sauce is on the spicy side just as a heads up. And the Cajun fries are spicy af.   Overall 5/5 service and food. The hype is still real so make a reservation!"}
{"text":"Nosferatu beware...If you have an aversion to garlic then stay away, we had to walk through a crowd of 5 outside in front of the entrance and their associated plumes of smoke....they were the staff and we were the sole customers.  Loads of garlic and plenty messy, the gloves they give out are too small. I really wanted to like this place, the vibe was great, decor etc but the garlic and mess were a put off."}
{"text":"Had the Shrimp and Mussels with Captains Boil Sauce which is apparently there most popular sauce as it is mixture of their other sauces in one. It was quite delicious but definitely messy. You get a plastic bib and gloves to eat the seafood. Had the Cajun Fries as a side and it was good. I also tried their Fish Teriyaki on a sizzling plate and it was delicious. It does get quite busy and they only take reservations of parties of 8 or more. Staff are great and does a good job in welcoming new patrons to the restaurant. Overall, had a great experience and definitely would recommend with places to others! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"If you're a seafood lover read the rest of this review later and just go now...just make reservations first. Alright, here goes. I love seafood over everything else. So, I also get easily dissapointed with bad food. But, this place is heaven for a seafood lover.  Everything I ordered was extra spicy. The mussels and the crawfish are delicious and yet feature on the bottom of my favorites here. The crab legs had me just focus on the food and forget about the world. The Cajun fries are something that one must just try here. It adds to the experience  (and I cannot even explain how!) The Cajun Shrimp was a notch above the rest. I must admit I am a shrimp fan and this by far one of the best shrimp dishes that I have tried at any restaurant here. My friends found the place a little expensive. I felt it was worth the price unlike some fine dining places (which this is not.)"}
{"text":"Always a big fan of Captain's Boil. I won an Instagram contest of $100 gift certificate for their TCB holidays contests in December. I went there with my boyfriend and my parents around February or March. We were quickly seated and service was also good. It didn't take long to get out foods. We ordered 2 lobsters, 1lb mussels, 1lb shrimps, 1lb clams, 1 lunch special with chicken and 1 lunch special with fish. And of course, $100 did not cover all the expenses.  I always take them in Captain's Boil sauce (a blend of the 3 other flavours they have) and mild - for a hint of spiciness. My parents loved it very much as it was the first time they were having this kind of blend with seafood. And since we live close to this restaurant, we will definitely come back, let's say in a few weeks :)   I'm not sure if this location has daily specials. If they do, we'd take the Sunday deal, which is \"Choose 2: Shrimp, mussels or clams, with a total of 1lb for $12\". Their individual 1lb price is $12 and $14 (for shrimp and I don't remember the other one)."}
{"text":"Always a big fan of Captain's Boil. Did you know that they have daily deals? My friends and I went there on a Sunday and the deal is Choose 2: Shrimp, mussels or clams, with a total of 1lb for $12. Their individual 1lb price is $12 and $14 (for shrimp and I don't remember the other one). So this is a really good one for seafood lovers like me who wants both shrimp and mussel but don't want to get 1lb each. I always take them in Captain's Boil sauce (a blend of the 3 other flavours they have) and mild - for a hint of spiciness.  Service was good too, except that it was a bit hard to get the servers' attention as it was very busy."}
{"text":"The Captain's boil franchise is undoubtedly the best of its kind in the GTA. You order seafood by the pound, which comes in a bag mixed with the sauce you pick. I've tried the captain's boil sauce, which is a mix of the other three sauces they offer. Love it!  It is not too watery, and very intense, which pairs well with the seafood. I've tried the mussels, clams, snow crab, shrimp and seafood platter.   Their clams are fresh and flavourful. The shrimp is cooked just right. Out of all these foods, I prefer the shrimp because it is a perfect compromise of flavour, price and the amount of work I have to put in to get to the flesh. The price for the snow crab legs is around $18/lb which is fair. I don't quite remember the pricing for the other items.   The cajun fries are okay, although I don't know if I would order them next time. The reason is, I am not a fan of the type of fries that they offer, which somewhat reminds me of high school cafeteria fries. Despite this, the cajun seasoning adds a nice touch.   Service was very attentive and the wait for the food is blessedly short. They provide scissors and crackers for the crab legs in case you have any trouble getting it open. They also provide these flimsy transparent gloves that you can use to eat, but they don't do much to keep the sauce out, might as well eat with your bare hands.   There is parking in the plaza, although it can become difficult to find spots during peak eating hours on the weekend. Captain's Boil is also available for takeout."}
{"text":"The Captain's Boil finally arrived in Scarborough and while I cannot compare it to their other locations, I thought it was pretty decent for what it is. This was my first time trying these types of boil restaurants and it was exactly like I expected it -  a tasty (but salty) fun-to-eat seafood mess.  I think the fact that we ordered too much decreased my overall enjoyment of this place but the initial experience was very pleasant. We ordered just about all the standard options - clams, mussels, shrimp, and crawfish in the captain's boil sauce, which was a mixture of cajun, lemon, and garlic sauces. The sauce was nice and flavourful with the spices, but after a certain point it was just too much flavour - a blast of salt and garlic especially. I probably met my weekly sodium intake from one meal.  I enjoyed the clams and the mussels the most. The seafood was pretty fresh, and we only had about three dead clams in 2 pounds. I would not recommend getting the crawfish as they're an extra hassle to eat while providing little meat.  The corn was excellent - it was sweet, crisp, and extremely creamy from the butter. The fries were also super crisp and were straight out of the fryer as it was piping hot.   There were no problems or hiccups with service at all which was nice to see as the place just recently opened. They were very attentive with filling our water, the food came out quickly, and there were no mix-ups with orders.   I definitely enjoyed the captain's boil overall and would come here once in a while for a good boil type seafood fix."}
{"text":"I'm glad to see a newly opened Mississauga branch of Captain's Boil! My significant other who has never tried the Captain's Boil before thoroughly enjoyed it and I found the experience here stacks up (if not better) than the other locations out there.   Upon walking in I loved seeing the big brightly lit SAUGA sign and the wide open space and the super massive screen by the main bar area.   The food was excellent. Everything arrived piping hot and fresh. We ordered the southwest lobster roll and ordered it with cajun fries instead of the regular at no extra cost (huge kudos for that). The cajun fries were crispy and were delightfully spicy. The lobster roll itself was loaded! The butter soaked toast enclosed the cajun mayo lobster with a lot of cheese and bacon bits on top. It was a bit on the salty side with all the contributing salty components so perhaps a reduction in salt would be good.   We also went with a pound of shrimp in their signature captain's sauce with two corn (best bang for your buck if you were wondering!). The shrimp was fresh and sauce was amazing. This time it wasn't salty and was a perfect balance of garlic, spice, and lemon. The corn was buttery and creamy and soaks up all the sauce nicely.  Minor hiccups occurred but was understandable being a newly opened restaurant. There was a slight order mix-up as another pound of shrimp arrived after we had gotten our order and the waitress looked rather confused. Otherwise, the service was great and our main waitress was really friendly and explained the menu and recommendations thoroughly. Waiters and waitresses were definitely attentive here and handled us well! I was semi disappointed we couldn't try the sizzling plate for dinner but if the feedback is good, perhaps it could also be offered as a dinner item. Otherwise, I'll definitely be back and come in for lunch to try it!  P.S. Loved the fact that all the bags here are biodegradable and are okay for the environment!"}
{"text":"This place gives you a variety of seafood to choose from such as clams, mussels, shrimps, crawfish and lobster. We chose shrimps, clams and a lobster for a family of 4 with each a pound worth and the Cajun seafood fried rice. The lobster was special price. Was told by the waiter the lobster is 1.5lbs at $41 CAD.  We chose th captain's boil sauce for both shrimps and clams which had a nice kick to it. The lobster was a garlic butter sauce. Each item comes to your table in a plastic bag. They provide plastic bibs and plastic gloves to each customer to peel and eat. The lobster was not 1.5lbs, more like 1 lb. at $41 CAD, it was not worth it. Lobster was fresh but too expensive. The reason I gave it 3 stars is the Cajun seafood fried rice which had great flavor, a bit spicy and had more seafood in it than the pound of clams! The other reason is the fact that everything is presented to you in plastic. Fried rice had shrimps, scallops and octopus in it which was nice. They provided bowls and spoons for us. Overall a messy way of eating and not environmentally friendly."}
{"text":"Food was great. Meal comes in a bag and all the juices and flavor are ready to dip your protein in. Gloves and bib provided which is extremely thoughtful. Service was HORRIBLE. Our server was literally eating her own dinner at a table across from us and she didn't check in is once she and the other workers dropped our food. 3.5 my seafood was delicious... Definitely missing the Mark on service though."}
{"text":"I went to the restaurant with two other friends for lunch on Monday. It was quite filled for Monday lunch, almost all tables were seated. It smelled very nice the minute we went into the restaurant, made me more excited for my lunch.   All seafood order came in minimum one pound. To starting the meal, we ordered one pound each of shrimp, mussel, and king crab. Too bad that they did not have crayfish and snow crab that day, really wanted to try :'(  We chose the famous cajun sauce for shrimp, lemon pepper for mussel, and captain boil for king crab. We all think cajun sauce taste the best. It smells like some herbs, and taste a little spicy. If you like garlic and creamy taste, captain boil sauce will be the best choice. Lemon pepper is so so. We ordered another two pounds of shrimp and one pound of clam, all with cajun sauce. I think the concept that eating with hands from plastic bag is fun, but the taste of the food is so so. Overall, it is just boiling seafood shaken with sauces in bag."}
{"text":"This is probably the best kind of seafood I have ever had in my life! There is also really great service from the staff here. I think the person who helped my table was Hilary and she always made sure we were having a good time. Im going to come back here again in the new year for sure!"}
{"text":"I went there once with my family. I think its something that you have to try once. The food was little salty, not really my type. We waited about 25mins to get a table and it was in the basement. Oh, and its not worth the price."}
{"text":"Food came really fast. Great for group gathering! Food was good. Really busy during the night time. (Should call and make reservation in advance)"}
{"text":"This was my first time trying this type of food in Canada.   We wanted to get the craw fish (this was a few weeks ago) but they didn't have it in stock. So we ended up getting king crab legs, clam, and lobster. Captain's sauce on king crab and lobster and garlic on clam. Garlic sauce was bland and we loved the captain's sauce, it was a little spicy (can choose spiciness) which added an extra kick.  We ordered the sweet potato fries but we were disappointed to find out that they didn't have spicy mayo to go with it, only had ranch dressing, which was subpar.   King crab legs - one leg's shell seemed more crisp compared to another leg, which was a bit soft when I clamped down on it with the plier; meat was plentiful and went well with captains sauce  Lobster - cut lengthwise for you, also went well with captain's sauce  Clams with garlic sauce - felt like I could have made this at home  Eventually I'll come back for the craw fish but I'm in no hurry."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time because my brother was raving about this place and I loved the vibe they had going on here! I loved the experience, the services was fast and friendly but the food was ok. We ordered the shrimp, crawfish, snow crab, muscle, chicken, oysters in various sauces and had other side orders. My favourite had to be the oysters and crawfish but I can't get over how greasy the sauces were. I'm not a HUGE fan of seafood so I wasn't very satisfied but overall it was fun. It's the experience that made up for the food really.    Would recommend to any seafood fans or people are looking for an experience but I wouldn't come back unless I was with a big group of people."}
{"text":"This is the 3rd Captain's Boil location at which we have eaten. The Bayview location is good. We did not enjoy our meals at the York Mills location. However this location on Yonge was the best so far. The lobster comes in a bowl rather than a bag and this is a big improvement. The Captain's Bowl seasoning is my favourite but others enjoyed lemon pepper or just plain steamed. The sides are large enough to share for two or three people. It's not inexpensive with an average cost of $55+ not including starters or desserts. But lobster is generally not cheap and the meal was very enjoyable."}
{"text":"Service was fast, clean, friendly. Ordering was easy... Way too much garlic sauce in every dish ordered.  Don't bring somebody here on a first date."}
{"text":"I've been to the Yonge and College location previously and enjoyed the experience immensely so I was happy to see a new location open on Queen. First of all, if you are not fine with getting your hands dirty (well you do get gloves) and eating with your hands then read no further as this is not the place for you. If getting your hands dirty is fine then continue on.  The selection of seafood is ok. They have the stuff you'd expect such as shrimp, lobster, clams, mussels, crawfish and crab. They also offer a fairly extensive selection of sides which ranges from corn and okra to calamari and chicken wings. You order the seafood by the pound and then you would choose your sauce flavour. I've only tasted the Captain's Boil which is a mix of the other 3 sauces so I can't speak to how good the others are but I would recommend doing the Captain's Boil.   My table ended up ordering some shrimps, clams, and mussels. We didn't bother with the crawfish as it takes too much effort for the little meat you get. We also ordered a side of Cajun fries, fried rice and shrimp basket. Our favourite were the clams and shrimp basket. The shrimp (not the basket) was overcooked and the Cajun fries although pretty good were not as amazing as people say. The fried rice was also a little bland.  Service here was ok nothing particularly amazing and it wasn't very busy for a Saturday night so we got our food very quickly.  It was a fun night overall and everyone enjoyed the food and the experience. Definitely recommended, a nice change from other restaurants."}
{"text":"Our office is just a few blocks away along the Queensway. Saw that a new location was open so we checked out for lunch. Nice location with lots of detail in the design. Seemed like a much more relaxed environment than the other locations I've been too.   Calamari was delicious! Perfectly crunchy and seasoned. We also tried the canjun fried rice. It was quite a large portion and was super tasty. My main order was the teriyaki fish with rice. Wow! Was that a good deal. If you're there before 4 pm for the same price of $11 you get the fish, rice and a seafood assortment which includes 2 mussels, 2 shrimp, 2 crawfish and 2 clams. It was a great way to get a taste of everything.   Staff was extremely friendly and accommodating. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Cajun Sauce, OMG, it was absolutely delicious, when I finshed, I wept, for there was no more food, and the bill had come. I got the the sizzling plate combo which includes chicken teriyaki with 2 crawfish, 2 mussels, 2 clams, and 2 Shrimp and with your choice of side and sauce, I picked, broccoli and sausage, with Cajun, the flavours that were packed into that sauce were endorphin exploding and adrenaline pumping. My mom had the same, but with fish and the Captain's boil sauce, which after tasting the cajun, was good, but some what mediocre, and my dad had the crawfish with the captains boil sauce, with corn and potatoes. Customer service was impeccable, she was friendly, very helpful, and even showed my father how to demeat the crawfish. Then the bill came a little over $100, it was very pricey, but well worth it, for very special events."}
{"text":"First time trying food served in a bag. Got crawfish, mussels and shrimp. It was ok, captain's boil sauce made it better. Also ordered the fried rice and regretted it, looked nice in the picture but it tasted awful!! They also gave us tiny Styrofoam bowls to eat the rice from. With all the plastic and styrofoam this is not environmentally friendly."}
{"text":"What we ate:  - 1 lb shrimp - 1 snow crab - okra - lotus root  Really fun meal. The cabin seasoning on the shrimp had just the right amount of heat and the texture of the shrimp was perfect. The snow crab was tough to eat, no surprise there, but would have been a bit easier if they'd provided small forks to use (we did ask for a cracker and got one). The captain's boil seasoning was also tasty. Lotus root and okra were simply boiled (think the Lotus root came with butter) and were nice additions to the meal. Solid service."}
{"text":"Reservation / Waiting:  if your hungry don't go unless you have a reservation and if that's the case your  not even guaranteed youl be seated right away. No place to wait other than the stairs and the small ante area were traffic is constant.  - the text feature is quite nice too.  Space:  too crowded the space is too small and it tends to get too loud  Food:  - Not bad shrimp and muscle prices were reasonable however the rest I find too expensive - I can tolerate heat however I find their  medium is too spicy for me therefore I ended up ordering just the plain with garlic   Overall  It's the experience and I won't mind coming back with reservation and avoiding the peak time/day"}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday night with a friend.  Unfortunately they do not take reservation unless you have 6+ people so we got no choice but to wait.  I am so glad Yonge street is pretty lively at night so to kill the 2 hours wait (yes 2 hours wait time!), we decided to go to a nearby izakaya spot to eat something small and chat a little.  Returned 1.5 hour later and was told the table is almost ready which took another 10 minutes.  It was already 10pm by the time we got our table but the store was still VERY busy.  We were seated at a booth that is good for 6 people, so my friend and I were very happy with our booth seats (tons of rooms for our jackets!).  I ordered the garlic sauce clams with non-spicy while my friend ordered the snow crab legs with Captain's Boil own special sauce and medium spicy.  Food came after around 15 minutes and we were dug into it right away!!  Seafood in a bag is pretty cool, but make sure you roll up your sleeves and wear the gloves they provide because it will be VERY messy.  Food wise, the crab legs were pretty good, although a little too spicy for me, but the snow crab legs tasted fresh and the sauce was good.  My friend loved it after she took a first bite and didn't stop eating then no matter how hard it was to remove the shells WITH tools!  My clams on the other hand was perfect for me!  Large clams with tons of garlic = super tasty!  To top it off, we ordered the Cajun Fries which surprisingly was very good as well.  My friend totally destroyed it!  Just a heads up that the spice (powder) on the Cajun Fries leaves an interesting spicy aftertaste on your tongue which i think is one of the reason why it makes you want to eat it after and after again.  Food was good.  Service was okay, some servers sounded a bit harsh which is understandable due to how busy the place was, but they were all very attentive!  4 stars out of 5 ,mainly due to the long wait time and average service.  I will for sure be back but maybe when the hype cools down a little so I don't need to wait 2 hours again!!"}
{"text":"I actually order takeout from this place frequently. It's alright for why it is. The price is fair for mussles and shrimps. I literally live across the street so I get food here out of convenience. Their combo is garbage though. Fried rice is terrible and their \"teriyaki\" sauce is also terrible. So if you go, stick to the boil seafood and nothing else."}
{"text":"We came as a group of 5 and we each ordered a pound of either mussels or shrimp. Most of us got the Captain's Boil sauce in Medium and one person got the garlic sauce. The Captain's Boil sauce is definitely the winner here! We were also given individual containers of lime and salt/pepper to dip our seafood in - great refreshing way to cut the richness/spice of the sauce! Tip: add some corn and sausage to your order, these were both SO good. The corn was my favourite - it soaked up all the sauce making it both spicy and naturally sweet from the corn, YUM :) The food comes piping hot which is how we like our seafood :) We also got the Cajun fries which was a good way to start the meal. Definitely will be back!!"}
{"text":"First off the food was pretty good, we ordered the mussels, snowcrab, and crawfish. The food was on point and fresh. The reason why I only give it a 2 star though is the server Nia was rude and non-helping. It was our first time there, she sat us down quite quickly as the restaurant wasn't that busy on a Wednesday night. She handed us the menu and left. She came back 5 minutes later asking what we wanted. Undecided yet, we wanted to know the price for the lobster, crab, crawfish etc since they were all listed as seasonal pricing.   As I asked for the price for each item that was seasonal pricing, she progressively got annoyed with me and gave me a clear indication that she wasn't happy with me asking. It was expected that she would have at least given us a run down on all the seasonal prices in the beginning and somehow now I'm being the annoying guy for wanting to know the price before ordering.    TL:DR - Nia the waitress was rude."}
{"text":"Great service, very fast and friendly. Food was great and fair price. Loved the captains boil flavor with clams. Would recommend and definitely coming back asap"}
{"text":"First off, my only experience with seafood has been Red Lobster. So when I had the food here I was thrown off. You can choose a sauce. It's not just buttered. And they have crawfish, which I don't recommend if you are really hungry.  But anyways. I had a good time here. It is a total experience, not just the food alone do you enjoy. It's getting your good in a bag and eating basically off the table. It's wearing the bib and the gloves. And on top of all that the food was good. I had the snow crab legs. Was cooked well and the Captain's Boil sauce was really flavourful. I also had this rice dish, can't remember the name of it, but it was good. And th service was really good. Our main server was really nice.Took the time to tell us how things worked. Also he gave a little speech thanking us. Was really nice."}
{"text":"Best Captains Boil location. Space, atmosphere cleanliness, and theres even a hand wash sink in the dining room for your convenience. There is no language barrier with the servers and little wait times."}
{"text":"Made resos a month ago. Didnt have a phone number cos rogers said it wasnt subscribed or some shit.  I came 17 min late with 5 of my friends and the asian hostess said no. They said \"15 min or no table\" and they never told me. Anyways the wait lounge is the size of a closet and i felt like i was on a human cargo ship waiting for freedom with other ppl. Go to the other location in downtown."}
{"text":"What could be better than a mess of sweet King Crab legs, soaked in a garlicky, spicy savoury sauce and served in a plastic bag?  Not much. But toss a few moist red skin potatoes into the sauce and you have a feast.  Of course there is a lot more than just crab legs.  It gets down to a variety of seafood selections, varied sauce options, and a selection of add-ins and side dishes.  It's all so tough to choose.  Just order something, put on the bib and plastic gloves and dig in!"}
{"text":"Oh, another great seafood place!  I stopped in for lunch on my way to Chatime (yes, almost every day) and I wanted something different.  Normally I just go straight to the King Crab Legs, but for lunch?  Too much garlic before afternoon meetings.  On the lunch menu they had a Lobster Roll, so I gave it a try.  Done as a typical example, with lobster stuffed into the sliced top of a hot dog style bun, it was a nice meal, especially when I was nowhere near Massachusetts.  The only problem is, when I eat seafood, I like a lot of it.  A Lobster Roll is a nice snack, but not hefty enough for a busy afternoon.  I'll try something different for lunch, and suit up in the plastic bib for dinners.  Be back soon!"}
{"text":"Second time in was not like the first. The portion seemed smaller, and for a $50 meal I was not quite as impressed. Gotta back off a star since my first impression was likely too enthusiastic..."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed this place. I've now been twice: once as a couple and once as a family.   The service was excellent both times and we had a great time.   Not sure if the concept is for everyone, after all, the food is boiled in a bag, but we liked it. It's SUPER messy and they used disposable plastic cutlery and gloves so be prepared with clothes you may be prepared to stain!  It's a bit pricey but the portions are generous and we left full and happy. Nice addition to for unique restaurant choices in Newmarket.  All in all, worth a try!"}
{"text":"The serves was efficient, friendly and quick. Yet despite the exceptional service, an upset stomach and other unpleasantries that quickly arose from eating resulted in my 2 star rating."}
{"text":"Excellent!!! I got the snow crab legs with broccoli, okra, and the medium heat \"captain boil\" sauce. My veggies were put in the same bag with the crab legs and sauce and it was delicious. I highly recommend and will be returning!"}
{"text":"The food was good if not a little unhealthy. I really liked the environment of the restaurant and the service was great. It's a great place to go with close friend to enjoy some seafood but I would avoid wearing my best clothes to that place as eating can get a little messy."}
{"text":"Excellent Service Excellent Food Dana our server was polite.smiling and professional.  Enjoyed it thoroughly.  Will go back."}
{"text":"I was a little skeptical at first with the food that comes in bags but everything I ordered was great. My server Nia was super friendly and the restaurant itself was clean and well presented. Fast service and great food. Will come again."}
{"text":"This place makes me feel like a kid again. We got to play w/ our food, eat w/ our hands, and wear bibs around our necks. It was messy, but I enjoyed it.    My friend and I ordered a pound each of shrimp and mussels. Both were flavored w/ Captain Boil's sauce, which is a mix of all the other sauces (Cajun, Garlic, Lemon Pepper). The seafood came in plastic bags, and they were fresh & flavorful. I particularly liked the mussels since they were huge, plump, and soaked up the sauce well. Also, even at mild spicy, there was still a nice kick to it. I was surprised that I got full from the seafood (+some cajun fries) as well.   I'll be back to try their clams, crab, and crawfish."}
{"text":"While eating with your hands off the table is fun, the food is not great and the portions are small for the price. The lobster we got was 80% cartilage and not much actual meat.  The scallops in the rice were so tiny (we think Bay scallops cut in quarters) you could barely see them. The sauce is salty. Will not be going back, nor would I recommend anyone else going.  We were all still hungry (after spending $150 on food for 2 adults & 2 kids) that we went to Wendy's afterward."}
{"text":"Ended up there for a family members birthday and ironically am not a fan of seafood. The chicken fingers and fries were really good though with Cajun fries and the corn dunked in boil sauce was extremely flavourful.   The staff was decent but one person in particular was not very helpful. We mentioned my cousin had a shellfish allergy, and asked if her food could be cooked separately and in different oil, (as most restaurants are usually very accommodating with allergies ). The waiter's response? \"We don't serve shellfish here\".... Clearly she wasn't paying attention to us so to save herself an allergic reaction, my cousin just had to eat corn and fries."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Mouthwatering amazing. Get ready to be uncomfortably messy, but a worthy price to pay for the taste. I tend to binge on this succulent food, so I usually don't feel so hot the next day. But I guess that's my fault."}
{"text":"This location does not taste the same as the downtown locations. It does not taste as fresh and I did not enjoy my food. The only reason my review is 3 stars is because the service is good."}
{"text":"Visited for the first tinge on father's day just after 4 there was no line up but as we ate the place got busy. The staff was always checking up on us yet our food took three times as long to come I watched two tables who came after me and a large group get their food before my table of three even got a cup of water.  Once the food came it was extremely hot temperature wise and the captain boil flavour was just the right amount of spice. We ordered mussels crab legs shrimp lobster and Cajun rice. The Cajun rice is a popular choice highly recommend."}
{"text":"Went and it was an okay experience. Food is fresh which is great. One of my servers was really nice, but a bunch of the other servers seemed a bit cold. We went during lunch so service was speedy. Didn't take long to get our food. It was definitely a different dining experience. But I found the food to be a bit bland. I was expecting flavourful and lots of spice, instead I just tasted butter with some seasoning. The seafood was still enjoyable, but not as flavourful as some other reviews had me believe.  I would go back maybe one more time during the summer, give it another chance. But if I have the same experience then I probably won't make the trek out there again."}
{"text":"I love The Captains Boil, I was so excited when I heard they were docking in Newmarket!  This location is much bigger then a few other locations I've been too and it has tons of parking. I've tried quite a few items off their menu, and my favourite has to be shrimp or mussels. You do get more meat technically with shrimp, because everything is by weight, and with mussels you get shell. BUT they serve quite large mussels so I still end up full. Just be careful with ordering heat levels. They do not joke around with spice, medium is more like hot and hot is more like extra hot. So tread very lightly.   Service can be a bit slow at times, even when they aren't busy. So I would advise management to talk to staff about time management and tending to customers with servers.  I'll be back! Love my seafood!"}
{"text":"Been here 3 times already n referred lots of friends there. It's was the experience first time that got me back here. The feeling of going all out bare with your hands. 3rd time a friend from NB said they boil the crabs n lobsters perfect. I would recommend everything n the lotus root side"}
{"text":"Amazing experience at this place. Wait is a little long. One the pricey side but it's sea food n ur getting really good stuff. They know how to boil the crabs n lobsters to perfection. Love their sauce options. Would highly recommend the lotus root for side."}
{"text":"Neat enough concept, very poorly executed. I definitely don't enjoy eating with flimsy little gloves on, while my piping hot food is in some crappy plastic bag leaking out all over the table. My experience would have much more enjoyable if they provided the option of a plate/bowl and cutlery. Even your leftovers have to be taken home in a sloppy bag, it's gross. This place is expensive and overrated, and the sauce leaves a bad aftertaste. As far as the menu goes, I'm not a fan of the extra costs associated with ordering sides, when the main protein is so darn expensive to begin with. Nobody just orders a bag of meat."}
{"text":"Tasty food, great service, but so much garbage!!!  I enjoyed the food, especially the Captain's Boil sauce. We tried 3 different types of crab, mussels, shrimp and the lobster. All delicious.  Service was great. The server took the time to explain the menu (for us first-timers) and they were very attentive throughout.  I didn't realize that this meal would generate so much non-recycled garbage though. Styrofoam bowls, plastic cutlery, bib, gloves, cups, serving bags and straws.... and everything including shells went into the same garbage bag. I'm not sure if I'd come back because of this."}
{"text":"Its okay.. but not amazing. The food was good but the portions are small surprisingly. The sauces were okay as well. It helped that I got a little spice kicked into it or else it would have tasted a little bland for me.   We got the king crab legs, mussels, and shrimp with a side order of the fried shrimp/fries basket. It was fun eating them but be careful because they tend to serve it really hot so it takes awhile to peel them off.  Service was good and friendly. Since it was our first time there, our waiter took the time to explain the menu etc. and even checked up on us. The place was quite nice too and there wasnt a lot of people when we came around a Sunday afternoon.  For two people it was around 69$ plus tip. Honestly for the amount of seafood we got my partner was a little annoyed with the price.   I would go back if I haven't found a better place like them in the future."}
{"text":"I have discovered this interesting restaurant with my MealPal account. Got fish and chips, both very yummy. But I must say chips (french fries) were exceptional. Not sure which spice hey used, it wasn't to hot, just the right amount, I was planning to eat half but end up eating the whole meal :)) When I pick up my meal I have seen the atmosphere in the restaurant, looked pretty cool. I would definitely try this place eat-in when I am in the area and when I am craving for some sea food !!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. Tip: get garlic bread to sop up the amazing Captains Boil sauce mix - which is a combination of garlic butter, lemon pepper, and Cajun. We had lobster, snow crabs, oysters, clams, and shrimp. The teriyaki fish is to be avoided as it's rather bland.   We'll be back!"}
{"text":"This is just like The Boiling Crab in the US. We ordered the shrimp, corn on the cob, and Cajun fries- delicious! Service could have been better- we had to wave them down to get their attention."}
{"text":"Very nice food, I like the medium spicy captain's boil source shrimp.  Keep wanting going again"}
{"text":"Having seen so many ppl post about Captain Boil, finally being able to open in Scarborough, decided to give this place a try and I was disappointed.   Unfortunately, there was no system in this restaurant. They didn't have enough servers, not sure if they were expecting to be this busy but there was simply no service.   We ordered and the food came initially, first 15-20 mins was probably ok, afterwards everything went down the drain. They made a mistake on our food, left it on the table, unattended for a good 10 mins. It's just 2 answers, you either take it back and change it or you just refuse it...why did that require 10mins? No idea!   They ended up taking it back and nothing came back.  We order clams, mussels, snow crabs, alcohol and etc...   We later found out there was water dripping in our food from the ceiling.  Which really upset me to the maximum.   Asked to speak to the manager/owner, no one attended to us. Ended up taking a video of the water dripping. No apologies were in the beginning until I said if I get sick from the water dripping, that's when they got intimidated.  I was very very disappointed and upset....lost and NEVER COMING BACK!!!"}
{"text":"The food was alright. Had medium mussels captain boil rub. The sauce was mostly oil which was kind of a turn off, but it tasted good.   Also had the Cajun fries which were pretty good - probably the best part of the meal.   The gloves they provided were useless as the oil leaked right through them onto my hands. The bag also leaked right through to the table.   Would give them a 3.5 if I could as their service was pretty good, they kept checking up on us and made sure everything was alright."}
{"text":"What could have been an unmitigated disaster of an evening was adequately fixed by their Supervisor, Alvin.  Couple weeks ago, we visited this place with a party of 10. We had made reservations a few days earlier which was a good thing as when we arrived, a long list of people were waiting in the tiny waiting area that they have.    They should really revise the policy of expecting 80% of the party to get there before seating you - as only 8 of us made it on time while the last 2 were looking for parking nearby. Most other restaurants expects only 50% of your party to be present before being seated. Anyway, small annoyance.   Once we all checked in, we asked to be seated upstairs and proceeded to order our food and drinks.  Beers and pop arrived fairly quickly, and so did the first round of seafood boils.  We loaded up on mussels, clams, shrimps, chicken wings and cajun fries.  Notably missing were the fries, but our server assured us it would be forthcoming in the next few minutes.  Eating seafood without utensils was not a foreign concept to us as Asian cuisine sometimes calls for us to eat with our hands.  The thin, clear plastic gloves provided are a nice touch.  For the sauces we had settled on garlic, cajun and the in-house sauce called Captain's boil.  It was hot to taste and hearty, definitely a highlight over the other sauces.  It tasted similar to the cajun albeit with a sweeter aftertaste. Shrimps were juicy and fresh, definitely not frozen. Clams size wise, was just right. These were my favourite.  Mussels were large, and cooked to perfection.  Quantity wise, since the mussels were so big, you don't get as many as you would say with shrimps and clams.  They were all delicious!  Chicken wings were really good as well.  Be careful you don't burn yourself as everything does come piping hot!  Within less than 5 minutes, we had finished the first round of seafoods.  Still no fries.  We ordered round 2 of more or less the same, more chicken wings and regular fries. And waited.  And waited.  A bag of clams and mussels came.  Still missing were more mussels, shrimps, wings and the fries.  We waited once more.  We ordered another round of beers. Beers came quick within 5 minutes.  And waited for the rest of our 2nd round.  Finally, at the 35 minutes mark, I was getting restless and concerned and spoke to Alvin the aforementioned supervisor.  He tracked it down and came back within minutes that our 2nd round of orders were lost by the kitchen.  How do you lose your customers' orders?  Much less a big party where by your own policy, a 18% gratuity would be tacked on for parties of 6 or larger.    Alvin apologized profusely and assured us our missing orders that was retaken would be expedited ahead of everyone else's in the restaurant.  True to his word, all of our orders were rushed out and came within the next 10 minutes.  The fries were big, crispy and fresh, the cajun season provided a nice salty and spicy flavor to it.  Reminds me of the NYF cajun seasoning actually.  By this time though, even though we wanted to order a 3rd round, we were not confident in the service as it was getting to be late in the evening.  Alvin would also comp us all of our fries orders, all 6 of them.  A gracious gesture.    When our bill came, we noted that the 18% gratuity had been waived. Still, for their gesture of saving the night, we still tipped the 18%.  Overall, an experience worth trying at least once, Captain's Boil is the first of its kind in Toronto.   We finally have a seafood boil much like the popular California Boiling Crab chain.  Only time will tell if this place will improve on its service and offerings in the future.  My gf and I do plan on returning sometime in the future to try the crab and lobster, and hopefully, our orders won't go missing...again."}
{"text":"First of all, I need to comment on the service (which if you scroll down, you will see is something quite a few people have issues with). The servers were nowhere to be found. They were all chatting at the back and generally ignoring us. Our actual server also decided to go home and leave our table with no one attending to us. After finally flagging someone down to get the bill, he told us they don't split bills. Then why did our original server tell us that this was something they could do? We had to talk to the manager who eventually did it for us, but it was a hassle. Also they have a bunch of beers on display like Tusker but they don't actually serve it... why display it then? They have draft beer on the menu too.... but don't have any. And the gloves they give you are ginormous and keep slipping off your hands so you get messy and gross. Finally, one person at my table ordered chicken fingers and he got his meal 30 minutes after everyone else with no apology given. It was pretty obvious they forgot his meal until we reminded them.  This is all a shame because I really really enjoyed the food. Get the captain's boil with seafood and add in a corn and it's delicious. Literally, it's the only reason I am giving 2 stars. If they addressed these issues, this place would be great. But as is, I am not going back, the service is so bad."}
{"text":"I am an avid captains boil goer. However, I have to say this was my favourite location. The flavours, spices and dare I mention; the butter, was perfect. The service was not too great but the food never fails to leave me satisfied and yet craving more EVERY TIME!"}
{"text":"First restaurant of this type that I have ever been to. It was pretty good. Had the shrimp and snow crab. Lotus was good also, never had it before in a bag :) Cajun fries are delicious. Recommend."}
{"text":"Best seafood in town, love their spices and seafood sauce they use on the crab legs, it's pricey so expect to spend about $75-$100 per person"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I was disappointed with Captains Boil at Rutherford, would rather drive further to the one on Yonge next time. I had brought my family in as our family is a fan of seafood and they were not impressed. We were a family of 6 and our bill was over $300.00 so you would think the service would be better.  We had order muscles, shrimp, crawfish, fried rice,  chicken wings and beer. A little of everything. One of our biggest is complaint is how cheap they were on the sauce we had to asked for it to be brought back to the kitchen to add more sauce, even then when it was brought back there was nothing so what's the point of complaining again. At the Yonge location, the bag and seafood is drenched in sauce which makes it flavourful and something you can put on the rice. The rice which I usually love and had order 2 plates was plain - you would think with the way it looks that there would be so much flavour. It tasted like there was absolutely no seasoning, this would have been great to have the sauce from the bag. Even asking for Tabasco sauce for the table, the server had brought only one small container not even enough for one person, really????? At least one for everyone please! And she gave me a look when I had asked for more.  My last complaint of the night is, with staff standing around you would think the service would be quick and smooth. Nope!!!! Completely wrong! We had asked our server if we could do another order since we had 2 people coming later) and he told me I would have to order through my server and walked away.... wow really? Oh and while eating the lights turned off on us and we had to ask 3 servers to have it turned back on.  Was disappointed is being kind."}
{"text":"This is the fourth time being at this location. Since they just opened a couple of months ago, I did see there are many changes and improvements along the way.   The first couple of times, we waited for roughly 10 mins in the lobby to be seated even though the place wasn't even full. Three staff came to address us, but none of them directed us to those available tables. Since they just started running the business, I understand that it takes time to improve the operational side of the business. And yes, for the fourth time, the improvement is obvious which I am glad to observe that. The waiters and waitresses are very friendly and energic. They come often and ask for additional requests and helps.   The menu selection is very limited to a few seafood options and chicken slices. Also, they just three types of sharing orders other than the boiled seafood or chicken. However, I don't reduce the rating based on that since it's a franchise and they don't get a chance to add more options by themselves.   I would say this place is definitely recommended as a group of people because the booth and the lounge are big to accommodate the size of the people. Since the restaurant offers alcohol, sharing food and the sharing boiled seafood & chicken, people can come here to enjoy sports games and enjoy the time with friends."}
{"text":"We tried pretty much all the seafood here except the crayfish.  All tasted fishy and not fresh. The seasoning they use is flavourful but it's not a real creole experience.  They don't boil in the actual spices they put them in after in a bag. Hey everyone. We live in Toronto. There is no Fresh Seafood here. Are you all dumb or something? To pay a premium for boiled frozen seafood in a Extra PBA cancer producing bag that no frills uses for your produce. Common people. You go here once to try it. That's about it. If you come back it means your stupid. If you like it and keep coming back your are really stupid. Dum dum place made for dum dum people. Its not even real creole. You realize they boil the frozen seafood,then put it in a plastic bag with seasoning and a slop of butter, and then serve it to you? If you butter and season your ear wax with seasoning it will taste ok also."}
{"text":"I was super excited to try this place after my Instagram was flooded by posts from various food bloggers but I left feeling  unsatisfied and disappointed. Found the food a bit too salty for my taste and the freshness of the seafood not up to par. The sauce wasn't as flavourful as it  looked. The staff were knowledgeable and helpful. It was a fun experience but definitely not worth the hype."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! When we first went they had just opened and therefore didn't have a liquor license yet and the staff were still somewhat unfamiliar this their menu items. Have returned since and noticed many improvements.  The shrimp, mussels and crab were excellent! The concept of eating with plastic gloves and bibs makes it a very fun and playful eating experience. The place gets quite crowded at dinner and the prices are a little steep but most of the food is awesome! We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Had a bad server experience here but it shouldn't take away from the great food that was served. A little pricey but this is a good place to bring a small party and share amongst friends and family. Just watch where your belongings are! The server I had cleaned the table while my watch was still on it and they threw it in the garbage :("}
{"text":"Love the food - not a place you wine and dine- a little messy than you think. But food is awesome - might have long line, so be prepared to have it take home and eat if the line is too long. Certainly enjoyed the 10% off"}
{"text":"Their special sauces will be the reason for me to come back. If you ever go there choose captain's boil sauce- you won't regret it.  Pros: Sauce! Fresh seafood Eating with your hands is fun Prices Cons: Service is slow  You need to bring your own calculator (Servers would split your bill and don't know how to use calculators) Terrible choice of music (who would eat to loud EDM/trance/hard rock?!)"}
{"text":"Didnt really know what to expect when i brought my friends here to check it out. Came, servers were really nice.. But the servers that served me didnt really know anything about the menu when we asked questions.. Im not really familiar with seafood so i had a lot of questions a lot of questions about what certain dishes tasted like, and if these dishes were popular.  My friends and i basically ordered blindly and stuck to what we knew which was the 1lb of chicken slices, 1lb of shrimp, shrimp basket, and cajun fries.  Food was good. Service was good, not the best."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try and was very disappointed in the service, because there was none. I was seated by the hostess, given a menu and that was it. Fifteen minutes pass then I got into my car and went to another restaurant. Thanks Captains Boil."}
{"text":"First time - fairly messy but fun, you get to put on a bib and gloves. A roll of paper towel is provided per table. Seafood allergies are near impossible to accomodate - they use the same stock to boil their all of their seafood in. Probably wouldn't revisit the franchise unless it was a special occassion (i.e. Birthday). Food overall was decent but you'd probably get a better quality crab or lobster elsewhere. I would recommend getting the clams and the mussels. NTS: learn how to eat/crack crayfish properly before going next time. There was a lunch special that was a pretty good deal but i think you had to get it before 3:00 pm... who eats seafood that early?!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best sea food I have ever eaten. Place feels a bit cramped up for space besid3s that the service and taste and quality of food is exceptional. Quicktip Only order the captain boil sauce"}
{"text":"Please improve your service, and don't forget to place the order for the customer. We have waited about 30 mins and nothing came to our table because they forget to place our order."}
{"text":"Love the captain's boil sauce with a medium heat... amazing.. always get the shrimp.. always want to come back again and again.."}
{"text":"This restaurant open a week ago, with alot of hype. And I have to say it lived up to expectation. Few words of advise. For the cost conscious buy, still to the shrimp and mussel's. They are very cost efficient. The crab really good, and huge but you only get one pound. Which is normally 1. Still, get it. It's worth it.   Fires are awsome with the sauce in the bag.   The fried rice is not very Cajun. Its more Asian but still taste goods.   Oh and the sauces used have a hint of Asian influence to them. So not authentic cajun but still good because they are unique to this place."}
{"text":"Tried Captains boil at different location, this is the worst one. Ordered medium spicy captain boil flavor, totally different taste and felt uncomfortable after. Disappointed, won't come again."}
{"text":"This location of Captain's Boil has quickly become one of my family's go to spots for both dining in and grabbing take-out. Whenever we come here we're always greeted by the staff and service is always super quick. Our normal order is usually a pound of shrimp with the captain's boil sauce and their seafood rice, which is always very flavourful. I've also tried their clams and mussels which I would also recommend. I believe they have 4 sauces you can choose from, however I always stick to the classic captain's boil sauce. In addition, you can choose from mild, medium and spicy depending on your spice tolerance.  Overall, I would definitely recommend this place as staff are friendly, service is great and food always hits the spot!"}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try.....wrong move.  Small tables sitting nearly side by side to the next person. All the food comes in a plastic bag. And you will have to dig into it to get the food out. Not sure why they can`t serve them in a bowl or a plate. And so by the middle of the dinner we have an empty messy looking plastic bag in front of us. And they don't seem to expect to remove it away from the table until you leave.  About the food. Nothing special. I can name tons of seafood places that's way better than them. As for the price. The shrimps and clams are just average. But charging $37 for that small lobster? I can get a 1 1/4 lb lobster full meal at Lobster Trap for around that price. We ordered a lobster and we have to ask for the cracking tool. And he just gave us 1 tool. Do they expect us to  crack open the craw with our teeth?! Will never go back."}
{"text":"Delayed review but this is the rating  When we got in, there were a few empty tables, which I thought was good because it was a weekend evening. However, we still had to wait about 5 mins to be seated... it wasn't like there were no staff, but their priority was to have two people cleaning up tables, while a queue starts to form by the door. They saw us standing there but pretended not to. And it wasn't one of those scenarios where they had hostess/wait staff distinction.   Anyway we got seated, ordered, waited for our food to come. No water was served to us, no napkins at our table at a place where we had to eat with our hands. We had to ask for all these multiple times.  Then the food came. At a place that sells and advertises seafood, I am beyond disappointed at the quality of the seafood. I have been to a competitor, and the quality was much better. You can't be a seafood joint and not have good seafood. I am sorry people. The fried rice was not good and tasted full of msg.   The captain boil's sauce deserves a mention. It's actually very good. But imagine having that with low grade seafood. Hmm. I am not coming back again."}
{"text":"First time here with a party of 4 ppl on a Saturday night. We had to wait an hour and a half which wasn't too bad as I wasn't starving yet (there were so many people, I didn't even get to go in and smell the food first). There's also lots of bubble tea (^.^) and other places to lurk about while you're waiting.   We were seated after ~2 hours later and was served immediately which was really nice for a place so busy! There are three floors and we were seated on the main.   Food: SHRIMP, clams, mussels, and Cajun fries. We had about 5 pounds of the shrimp, all in the 3 different spices and one mixed. My fave is the Cajun and my spice tolerance just matched the hottest one on the menu. But if it were not for the shrimp shells, I don't think I would of been able to close my mouth for the rest of the night.   You get a bib and gloves which I thought was super fun. Oh and no plates, no cutlery, and the table is covered in what seems like thick white paper the servers can just toss out once we were done being savage.   But BE WARNED. You will smell like seafood/spices for a while as I've been told several times by my family when I got home.   A bit more on the pricier end, but I'd say it is worth it, especially with a larger group of people."}
{"text":"One of the male waiter (blonde asian dude) told my family and I to \"Do the math\" and rolled his eyes when there was a misunderstanding with the amount of steam rice that came out. We we're just trying to figure out/clarify how many steam rice we ordered in total and he proceeded to make a comment like that. Totally inappropriate and rude. Thank god we were just visiting! Never coming back here again, taking that flight to LA's Boiling Crab very much more worth it because they have a more friendly and accommodating staff!"}
{"text":"I have been to other locations and never had service as bad as today (fathers day). We got seated and we waited for 15 minutes before flagging a server to place our orders. Once the food came out it took another 15 for everyone at the table to receive their food, not to mention that our drinks didn't come until we started our meal. Further more when we asked for a bucket we were told by the server that they are only given when you order lobster or crab. We ordered mussels and shrimp, our table ended up being a pile of garbage because we didn't have a bucket to put it in and nobody came by to clear it. Also took forever to get the bill. Furthermore, it's worth mentioning that at ever stage of the meal we had to flag a server. Worst experience  avoid this location!!"}
{"text":"This location cannot handle delivery orders properly. They canceled my order after 30 minutes waiting time without giving me any chance now order anything as all kitchens are closed."}
{"text":"This location systematically cancels orders submitted via Foodora. Therefore, This place cannot claim Delivery availability"}
{"text":"The crawfish it's too small and nearly nothing besides the head~the crab legs tastes great, wish there could be more~mussels are the best among all seafoods, and shrimps are the second best in my view~ the corn and lotus roots are the must try~"}
{"text":"Came to Captain's Boil for dinner with my boyfriend - new to the seafood boil type of cooking.. Loved it! Service was okay - there were many tables available when we arrived but it took a long time for the servers to organize which table to seat us at.  You will definitely need to get your hands dirty for this - they provide you with plastic gloves, which does 60% of its job. I'd suggest you avoid wearing white even though they provide you with a cute bib!  Highlight of my favourites: * King Crab legs  * Clams * Shrimp (in Cajun Cajun / Captain's Boil sauce) - Spicy  So yummy!! I have to come back to try their crawfish.  It wasn't in season when we went - will re-visit soon :)"}
{"text":"Interesting concept but all the seafood eventually just tastes the same coming out of the bag. The seafood wasn't particularly fresh but pretty decent. Also thought it was a bit pricey too"}
{"text":"We were a party of three sitting in very tight uncomfortable tables. Half the menu was unavailable at 5PM. So how do you expect to hold up for the rest of the night? The description of the food from the server was not very clear. We asked about ingredients because of certain dietary restrictions. The server left to ask. We were not asked about allergies after we ordered. We order the mussels, the Dungeness crab, the lobster and the cajun fries. The fries were underseasoned and the cajun very unevenly distributed. Most of the staff were very absentminded. We repeatedly asked for water and beverages. Service was very poor. We paid $100 for three people and we were not even full. The food is not particularly tasty. It is the average Captain's Boil and there was nothing special about it. I would not go again because the next day I had MSG throat. This is the condition of consuming too much MSG the previous day and your throat hurts a lot."}
{"text":"This is the second location of Captain's Boil & I decided to give them a second chance. Service was very disgusting. When we needed something the servers just ignored us or are not perceptive enough to get us what we needed because we had to wave like a crazy person to get attention.   We ordered the King crab legs, lobster, crayfish, mussels, shrimp, butterfly shrimp. No drinks. For people, that was $110 taxes and tips included. Really not worth your money.   We asked the server if the food was enough for three people, she said yeah. But in reality, it was good for like six people. So the servers will always tell people to over order, do not fall victim to it."}
{"text":"My first immediate reaction was: Dear god. All this plastic!?! :( environmental waste.  The food was delicious, just a bit too oily. There is grease everywhere. I really don't like the concept using disposables: the bib, plastic gloves, served in plastic bags, etc...  Would recommend eating with your hands instead.   Great value! $10 = for the meat/rice dish + assorted seafood  I am hoping they participate in proper composing or have a biogas digester."}
{"text":"I went to eat with my mom and niece. We had shrimp, mussels, chicken wings, fries and a bloody Cesar. The Cesar tasted great, the seafood was perfectly cooked, and the fries are amazing. Would recommend the experience!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge seafood fan so when Captain's Boil finally arrived to Scarborough/Markham, I had to go try it. I've gone a few times now and I think it's a really neat concept. I like that its super simple. Just sauce and seafood cooked and bagged for your enjoyment. There's nothing fancy about it. Perfect for a fun night out with friends and family and the portions are decent. If you share the seafood among your table, you get to try a bit of everything, feel full, and all at a fair price. I like that you get to choose the sauces and how spicy you'd like it. Oddly enough.. I LOVEEDD the cajun fries here!  The only thing is, after the end of each meal, I feel a bit sick because of how intensely salty the food/sauce is. I would say order rice or bread to dial it down because the sodium will make some very nauseated. They're always happy to provide lemon/lime so that's helpful too. :)  This place gets packed after 6 so make reservations if you plan to go! I have made reservations every single time and once I get there, I'm just glad we planned ahead. haha. Service is really quick too! OH AND i recommend you double up on the gloves for less of an oily mess after!"}
{"text":"Had my post bday dinner here with my boyfriend earlier and told myself, once i get home i have to give this place a review.  The place just recently opened, i believe and since ive heard that there's a mock of \"boiling crab\" like the one from cali, i knew i had to try it.  It kinda sucks that you cant really make a reservations, although the person or the receptionist knew people from the outside and asked how many to dine in and how long it'll take.. i think that was a good customer service.  The place is packed! People were standing outside waiting to be seated but my bf and i was lucky enough to be inside, away from the cold and the heater was directly to us.  We waited for a good 10 mins, or maybe less...which was good. Server was very attentive, knew what was good in the menu. Gave us water and rang our order. The food, i'd give it a 8.5/10, only because there was limited flavours, but i really liked the mussels and the shrimp though. The captain boil's flavour was actually pretty good. Getting our food didnt even take that long, but it was a good service though. I was pretty surprise that the place is 3 floors, having a small area in the basement, the main and im guessing the upper for parties or venues. Over all, it would be nice if they had one in Mississauga or somewhere in Downtown Toronto.  I'll go back again when the crawfish is in seasoned, too bad they didnt have it when i went."}
{"text":"If you are really into seafood, I would recommend it but generally just a restaurant you'd try once and keep it at that.  Lacking in proper service, it was extremely difficult to get the attention of our server, our water was never refilled-we asked one of the other servers but we were ignored. It also took forever to get the bill, they probably wouldn't even notice if we dined and dashed . We voiced our dissatisfaction to the manager but it seemed as if she didn't really care.   The food is alright but absolutely horrible service!!!"}
{"text":"I really don't understand the hype about this food joint.  We ordered the halibut and chips and the lobster roll.  They missed our order twice, we had to wait about 45 minutes for our order.   I guess they knew how bad their food was and hoped we would leave (they knew I was recording for a review, will post the video on Youtube shortly).  It was definitely NOT worth the wait.  This would probably be the worst seafood we ever had.  Maybe it could be the expectation that seafood would be fresh at a fish market. (More on the fish market later).  The halibut was dry as cardboard so you know this was frozen.  It's not just about the dryness, it was like they found a piece of frozen fish at the bottom of the freezer and left in the fridge to defrost for months and cooked it after all the moisture evaluated.  Hope this give you some sense of what it taste like.  If not, imagine a McDonald fish sandwich as a gourmet meal.    Now on with the lobster roll review.  For those of you that had the opportunity to tried a Boston lobster roll would surely vomit with the Buster's lobster roll.  To use an analogy, it's as if these guys collected left over bits from lobster meals for months to use for the lobster rolls.  There were no reconizable lobster meat in the roll or any detectable lobster taste.    You have to be desperate to eat here!"}
{"text":"Waste of money. The food has barely any flavour it all tastes the same which is odd for seafood."}
{"text":"Jenny, our server, made our visit amazing! She created a great atmosphere and experience for us! We went on a Friday after lunch/before dinner and it wasn't too busy. The food! YUM! We got food drunk  Cost is worth it!   The wash station, bib & gloves... oh and the tools to use to eat, so great!!   Messy, fun and good meal!!"}
{"text":"Can not believe how amazing this place was! The fish teriyaki was to die for. I love that there was modern music and a great environment. The corn and okra is recommended. If you're in town it's a must to go!"}
{"text":"We came here with a group of 7 people - make a reservation (only for parties of 6 or more)! They're quite busy, especially since they just opened. We ordered the 2 lbs of shrimps, clams, and snow crab legs, and 1 lb of the mussels with some corn and potatoes, as well as cajun fries, the seafood fried rice, and the sausages, and it came out to about $23 a person after tip, which was pretty fairly priced for the amount of food that we got! They unfortunately don't have the crawfish right now - out of season! The service here is polite and quick, and they really want you to come back! They gave us 10% off our meal and promised 10% off on our next meal, and also didn't include a tip, which was a pleasant surprise! All in all, it's definitely a place worth checking out, especially with the cold winter months coming up - nothing like boiled seafood drenched in garlic, spiciness, and lemon to warm you up!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite sport bar / seafood restaurant yet in Mississauga. This location really step up their game to the next level. With the 4k TV around the restaurant I am sure will be coming back for all sports events ! Seafood and any other dishes on the menu are very well presented and the flavour is very nice. Highly recommend anyone who's in the area to come check them out!"}
{"text":"Ever eat out of a plastic bag? Me neither. I have now though. This place is the spot if you want to eat seafood out of a plastic bag. Here is how it works.  Step 1: Choose a type of seafood Step 2: Sauce (chose Captain Boil's sauce) Step 3: Heat (chose medium and it was probably too hot) Step 4: Choose some sides that they throw in your bag (corn, potato, rice, fries, etc)  First of all, this place brings the heat. If you choose hot, I just have to say good luck to you. Secondly, GARLIC. This is probably the most garlic you will eat in a single seating, so be warned. This is not really a great date spot. Better for groups.  A pound is easily enough. I didn't think it would be, but the food just kept coming out of that bag.  The food comes quick because it is basically boiled seafood that is thrown into a bag and coated in sauce.   TIPS: Don't cut your nails before coming here, you will need them. Dip your food in the sauce in bag once peeled. The food is hot when it comes out, so give it a few minutes to cool down.  Once your done, you will want to get away from the table right away because it will be so messy and gross.   Overall, this place was great and I am planning on trying some of their different offerings."}
{"text":"awwwwww yehhhh!!!! get it in ma bellehhh !!   Came here on Friday night with momdukes, need a change from the local eateries and omg! it was such an awesome experience. The staff and customer service were outstanding and the food was delicious !!! piping hot and super fresh.   Definitely worth the hype!!!  We ordered the Shrimp in the Captain Boil sauce (a mix of the 4 sauces) with a mild spice, the mussels in lemon pepper w/medium spice, the lobster and a side order of cajun fries. They tape the paper order to the table so the staff circulated with the bags know where to go. I think that's a great idea so that nothing is missed, everything is keyed and then scratched off the paper when it arrives. Seafood was fresh and the pieces of pieces of shrimp and mussels were quiet big. The sauces do a have a kick to it so be careful... if you tend to eat super spicy I'd bump it down a notch so you're not flaming from the mouth.   All in all, I had a great experience here and can't wait to tag along with friends looking to try it."}
{"text":"If you love seafood you would love this place! Great experience as well as you use your hands to eat the food (they provide gloves and bibs for you since it can get messy. This place provides fresh seafood and this is what makes them great! Very friendly staff as well. The location is close to a subway station so it is very convenient."}
{"text":"First time and last time visiting. Admired the novelty, however we will not be returning. Service was terribly slow despite the restaurant being empty, the chicken teriyaki was horrifically bland, and I think tainted with salmonella. It sent my boyfriend to the hospital with food poisoning and violently vomiting for the first time in his life. The other people in our party ended up with upset stomachs but nothing as bad as my boyfriend, as only he had the chicken. Avoid this at all costs, unless you enjoy visiting the ER."}
{"text":"The concept of this place is a novelty for Toronto so I was excited to try it out.   We went as a party of two and ordered a pound of mussels (lemon pepper, medium) and clams (Cajun, medium) with Cajun fries on the side, a half dozen raw oysters, and beers.   Service was serviceable and there was an adequate amount of paper towels (meaning an entire roll). The atmosphere was busy and the decor was fine.   On to the food...unfortunately. To put it bluntly, the mussels tasted like those white rubber erasers dropped into a vat of spicy chicken seasoning and boiled for an hour. The seasonings and grease overwhelmed any hint of shellfish flavor that might have remained after cooking.  The best part of our meal was the oysters (fresh with decent condiments) and the beers (cold) because neither of which was boiled, to our relief.   Maybe it's growing pains or the fear of sending out  a bad clam but I would give this place another chance when crawfish are in season. Until then, Yelp is telling me this review looks pretty epic so I'll end it here."}
{"text":"Sea food not fresh, shrimp is really soggy like those discounted ones from super market."}
{"text":"Just about everything here was subpar. Do yourself a favor and skip this place.   First the drinks, we ordered 1 coors light, 1 apple juice, and a Diet Coke. They brought out 2 coors, OJ and coke classic. They were only willing to switch out the coke and insisted we ordered OJ. We didn't even mention the extra coors because of how difficult the waiter was. This was there last time we saw her for the rest of the night.   Our food came pretty quick, brought out by a different person each time. The oysters were tiny but at least they were fresh. We asked that the lotus roots be cooked separately from the rest of the boil because one person had an allergy. They instead brought out every one of our sides separate from the boil (rather than just the lotus roots) and unseasoned. The potatoes were particularly bland. The clams were about 80% shell, maybe every other shell or every third shell had an actual clam inside. The king crab legs were not fresh. The lobsters were the only thing that's passable here.  Because of how little food we got vs what we expected, we ordered the seafood fried rice after. We had to flag down a different waiter because we couldn't find ours. The rice was unremarkable. No one came to check on us and no one offered to refill the soda the entire night.  Came out to about $50/person for bad food and non-existent service. At least the restrooms were clean."}
{"text":"Food was bland, I was eating mediocre $40 lobster out of a plastic bag. Left feeling sick."}
{"text":"A generous 2.5 stars, in a (nut)shell, The Captain's Boil is just Ok.  On the plus side, the restaurant is clean, same goes to bathrooms, relaxed atmosphere (will come back to that), nice decor, menu is more New Orleans than NE.  Once they take your order, food arrives in plastic bags (see photos), each item separately, limited menu, slow service, \"no hand wipes\" that's when you say Whaaaat? They do have disposable bibs and (slippery) vinyl gloves, but no bucket or bowl to dispose shells, nor plates ^_^  We ordered Lobster, King and snow crab (they didn't have dungeons crab), shrimps, okra, fries, and corn on the cob.   Food tasted previously frozen, and I would be ok with that if not for the prices, is outrageously expensive."}
{"text":"Messy and delicious. What a fun experience, if you love a bag of fish and getting dirty then youll have a great time at this place. I will definitely come back with friends."}
{"text":"As odd as it sounds, eating seafood out of plastic bags is not as bad. Sounds gross but it's a unique concept and you don't have to worry about getting messy because pretty much everybody eating there is going to get messy.   I'd recommend the mussels with the captains boil sauce. We tried other sauces but I'm telling you captains boil is the best!   The Cajun fries are okay in my opinion. Nothing special but if you're up for more flavouring on the fries I just dipped it in the captains boil sauce we had from our seafood. Yes I know sounds gross haha.   Wait is not fun. I suggest making reservations unless you want to wait or loiter around. At least they will text you when your spot is ready."}
{"text":"Ordered everything on the menu. Food was great. Service was ok. One of the lobsters that we received had no meat.  Almost looked like they served the shells from another table. Asked the server to replace the order and was denied. Will not return."}
{"text":"Fast food. Flavourful.   This is our go to spot for pay-by-the-pound seafood. Very flavourful, prices are decent. Always going to come back.   First time here we ordered 2 steamed rice, one king crab's leg, and 1 pound of shrimp in Mild Captain's Boil. Delicious.   Second time here we ordered their fried rice and 1 pound of shrimp.   Yum."}
{"text":"The 2 good things about this place is the taste of the food and the fact that they played the NBA games on television. Other than that I was not pleased about anything else at this place.   I came here for my sisters birthday and entered the restaurant a bit late. I walked in and sat down with the party of 4 and was not asked if I wanted anything. What if I wanted a beer? Now that I think about it, I was actually ignored the whole visit. The whole table was verbally ignored for majority of the dinner. Besides the few times they filled our waters. I thought there were ghosts serving us. Another thing we found annoying was that there was no bucket available for seafood shells and waste. We were told to just leave it on the table, and by the end of our dinner the table was filthy. They did not tend to it at all. Even when we were served dessert, you would have thought they would have cleaned the table. Nope! We had to maneuver around the waste that covered the table. We also had to sit by the window that had a partially covered vestibule that had a large partition that defeated the purpose of the vestibule. All of the cold air was seeping through the crack and my whole party was freezing cold for dinner. @thecaptainsboil I'll be sure to come back if I'm looking for seafood and a cold and haunted experience. Seems more like a Halloween theme you should save for next year. Jimstar Out!!"}
{"text":"Excellent place to enjoy lots of seafood. They are brought out in a bag marinated, and you eat them with your hand.   Their food quality and service were pretty good, especially considering the price (1 pound mussel or shrimp were around $10). I recommend Captains Boil sauce with shrimps and mussels. Also, their chicken tender with cajun fries were amazing!  They give plastic gloves and apron, but your hands would get a bit oily regardless.  I strongly recommend this place if you are a big seafood lover"}
{"text":"I went here not knowing what to expect but was PLEASANTLY surprised by the fresh fantastic seafood and \"manly caveman\" eating atmosphere. The place offers bibs and gloves so as get on your seafood couture for the evening. We ordered a number of different varieties including snow crab, mussels, shrimp and even corn on the cob. All with the Captain's Boil sauce which was delicious as other reviews recommend. I opted for a bit more spice which definitely added an extra kick.  Be prepared to get messy though...that said they offer plenty of paper towels and extra gloves if you need them. I also suggest going in a larger group which allows you to sample a lot of the different options for a cheaper price. Will definitely return for another seafood feast."}
{"text":"My favourite restaurant to date.  I went to the finch location and then the markham one as it is closer to me.  Loved both!  The service is excellent and the food as well as atmosphere is amazing.  There are four different sauces to choose from, a large variety of seafood such as three different types of crabs, lobsters, shrimp etc.  The portion sizes are good and the french fries are amazing.  Better than costco even.  My personal favourite is the cajun seafood fried rice.  10/10 experience and will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Went here with some friends during the long weekend to close the end of summer.   Place was packed. I've been to the location on Yonge and Finch and Yonge and College.  Still think the Yonge and Finch one is the best.   This location gave very little sauce/seasoning with the muscles that I ordered - sadly I had to scrape the bag of what little sauce was left.   We also ordered a bottle of Soju -- and four times, the servers poured water into our cups of Soju. I get they were just trying to fill our water cups, but it happened four times with the bottle of Soju clearly on the table.   Luckily we had an amazing and understanding waitress that took our complaint to the manager. We were given two free bottles of Soju -- thank you management and the wonderful waitress!! Very thoughtful of you.   It was a decent experience. The best pro I can say about this location is the size of the space which is big enough to fit larger parties. Good option if you don't feel like going all the way downtown."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Waited over an hour for the fries and wings. They forgot to add it to the order and then when we told them, they still got the order wrong."}
{"text":"Came here today on my lunch break. This replaced the Wonderpho that was here, which I actually kind of liked. Not too full on a Friday afternoon. Server was friendly. Mostly the same menu as the other locations, you get your choice of seafood, sauce and spice level.  Ordered a lunch special which was a chicken teriyaki with a seafood platter (normally) including 2 shrimp, 2 mussels, 2 clams and 2 crayfish. The crayfish is seasonal though so they gave one more of each instead. Got the Captain's Boil sauce, medium, and switched to udon instead of rice ($1 extra).  The udon itself was quite bland, the teriyaki sauce that you pour over disappears, so it's good there was plenty of sauce from the seafood. The seafood itself was mediocre, the shrimp and clams don't seem particularly fresh. Mussels were the best because of largest surface area for sauce and ease of eating. Portion size was larger than expected for the price ($9.95)."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Oyster and king's crab leg are my number one choice! Will go again for sure!"}
{"text":"I've seen Captain's Boil mentioned on Instagram many times and some friends of mine have been raving about it so when a couple of visitors from Florida were in town, it was a great time to try it.  Our party of eleven arrived a few minutes early for our 7:00pm reservation and we had two tables, side by side, waiting for us. The lighting was intimate and the decor, with its broad wooden beams on the walls, was reminiscent of a dock or wharf. It was more upscale than I imagined, especially since it's a rustic theme where you eat with your hands. They do provide bibs and gloves.  We ordered shrimps, clams, fried rice, corn on the cob, chicken wings, Cajun fries, and snow crab legs. Most of us chose The Captain's Boil spice mix, a mixture of Cajun, lemon pepper, and garlic (lots). You can also choose your heat level, from mild to fire. Medium was just right for me.  All the seafood we had was fresh and properly cooked. Our Floridian visitors approved. The snow crab surrendered its meat easily. The seasoning was delicious. I ended up pouring it all over the Cajun fries. Yummm! We all enjoyed the food and the prices were lower than I expected.  Previous reviewers mentioned service as a weak point. We didn't experience that. Our server(s) were very attentive, checking in with us several times and refilling our water glasses whenever necessary. I guess they solved all their teething problems.  Auntie D, a very fussy diner, enjoyed herself so much, she's already been hinting about a return trip. If she approves, it must be good! We'll be back."}
{"text":"I've been here four times in the last four weeks and I have to give them points for consistency. The seafood has been fresh every time and the service has been great. I even have my own personal server now, Nia. ;) She's great!  My personal favourite is the snow crab with Captain's Boil spices, corn on the cob, and Cajun fries. The spicy garlic butter is delicious! My fellow diners usually go for the clams and shrimps. Tonight, we tried the crawfish and nobody was crazy about it.  Their ice cream is always good!  Each visit, I've been with different friends and family. All of them said they'll be back. So will I."}
{"text":"I got the fish and chips and the fries taste just like costco fries! I loved them. They gave a big size portion for fish, I couldn't even finish. Our server was really nice, in fact, he was too nice, to the point where he would over talk. But that's okay because he did a pretty good job serving. It was my friend's birthday, and I tried to discreetly ask for a birthday surprise thing, just like you would at any restaurant, but they ended up coming to our table and asking the girl for an ID to see her birthdate. I understand that they want to verify that it's actually the person's birthday since they're getting a free dessert, but I mean, c'mon, we wanted it to be a surprise. Plus, it's literally just two scoops of ice cream with a candle stuck in it. Other restaurants give far more without asking for verification. That ticked me off a bit."}
{"text":"Yes, \"Get Messy\", but I'm glad that they didn't mess up our orders for our large group of people.  Visited different locations before, and I have to tell you, this location is the best.  The manager knows her menu very well, and I'm happy that she didn't miss any items on our order.  Their staffs are very helpful, too.  Very fresh seafood~!!  I love their mussels the most.  Shrimps, Lobster, and Snow Crab Legs are also very good too.  Four different flavours and I love them all.  You can choose your heat level... but for me... I only can have non spicy or mild... haha~!   Must order their Fried Shrimp Basket and you can change the fries to their Cajun fries~~~ Love it~!!    We had our plastic bibs and gloves on, but still got very messy while enjoying our food.  Love that they use foot pedal for their sink, and the sink is located in the middle of the restaurant.  I can clean up my messy hands easily :-D"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the top five meals I've ever had. King crab, potatoes, and corn in garlic sauce and it was perfect. We also tried the calamari and the kids had wings and fries. The people were so friendly and the food came out quickly. We were visiting from the US and the first thing we asked was if they had locations there. Sadly, nothing in the US just yet but we have our fingers crossed!"}
{"text":"The owner of this Calgary location is a total scam artist. He has not had crawfish in for over six months!!! The reason he has no real supplier of CRAWFISH. He just gets them at a local Calgary River like everyone else...he admitted it to us. It clues in for us when he said he has no crawfish because the ground is frozen. How can you not have your main featured item in stock for over half a year! It is a total joke and the other seafood he sells is NOT FRESH! It tastes frozen and he masks it with all these spices so people can't tell. The owner also owns Buffet Yangtze so you know he uses the same second rate frozen seafood he serves there...also st Captains Boil. What a shame it is a known  National Brand. He won't update his website to say he is out of Crawfish either...he wants your to come down expecting Crawfish but it's is NEVER in stock!!! So you are forced to buy overpriced shrimp and mussels instead!!! If you do not believe me go there yourself"}
{"text":"It's so addicting! If you want the bang for your buck, get the shrimp, clams and corn. These three soaks up a lot of the sauce. Don't get crawfish because it has too little meat and it takes a lot of effort to eat one. If you are adventurous you should try lotus root because it's crunchy and works well with the Captain's boil sauce!"}
{"text":"(We went yesterday) We called around 9 pm to check when is the last call for their kitchen and received firm answer the last call is at 10:30. We made it to the restaurant at 10:22 yet the waitresses told us the last call finished at 10:20. We asked them why dont they simply tell us the last call is 10:20 instead, the tall waitress with a ponytail replied \"i am sorry but what do you want me to do BUDDY\" with an attitude. Seriously, you call a customer \"buddy\" when you are supposed to be apologizing for your mistake?! And even when we were steping out of the restaurant in anger the same waitress swore at us thinking we wouldn't hear it. This is extremely unprofessional. Unbelievable.  I would give 4 stars for the clams and shrimps with garlic souce as I went three times to this location prior to yesterday's visit. Service was okay for all three times."}
{"text":"It was incredibly messy. I had the Lobster. And 2 sides. Which can be ordered as 'sides' or inside the bag. The Lobster looked like it would not be filling but in the end, I felt full. You have to order a minimum of 2 pounds but that's with crust and everything.The sheer effort required to break and suck and eat....It fills you up.......and wipe your clothes, your hands, your face...Oh My! Spread plenty of tissue on your lap. That definitely helps. I tried the Captain's Boil sauce. It was great!  The Lobster is kind of steep but I guess it is only to be expected."}
{"text":"This location clearly have the most lazy ass employees. We got there at 10pm. They told us the kitchen is close.. but the sign state closes at 11pm. we're never gonna  set foot on this location  again."}
{"text":"Group of 6 of us went here and had a great time. They don't take reservations so be prepared to wait. It was fairly busy and we ended up waiting about an hour for a table but they do take your phone number down and call when your tables ready. We ordered the lobster, king crab, mussels, shrimp, Cajun fried rice, and a bunch of sides. We tried all 4 flavours(Cajun, lemon pepper, garlic sauce, and Captains Boil) at medium heat. Food was very tasty. Service was very friendly and gave us some good recommendations as first timers."}
{"text":"The sign should read: Garlic, Butter and things from the bottom of the ocean.  For most, they would lineup like a lemming behind that sign. People LOVE their Red spiders with claws.   I don't.  Well I like Garlic, and the rest of my friends like the rest. I may be lame, that's fine. My review will be entirely based on the shit-eating gleeful grins on their faces when the bags of crustaceans arrived.  They were elated. Eating there is as close to feeling like Julius Caesar as I have ever felt.   BEWARE: if you are like me, and don't eat things that look like red spiders with claws, DO NOT ORDER THE CHICKEN. It is sad. I have never eaten chicken that was boiled. I dont even think they salted it. But I cannot fault them at all for it, the clams and Red Spiders with claws smelled very well spiced.  The waiters were lovely, the place has a great vibe.  Look, this should be self explanatory, but the entire table was a fucking mess. Gloves or no gloves.  By the end of it, you will have eaten like a whale, and judging by the belts that were being loosened, you feel like one.  Also, I didn't find it very expensive, and the animals I was with ate 5 of everything.  This isn't a very helpful review. I know."}
{"text":"Went with the hype and decided to try out this place. It was an hour wait but it reality, it took about 40 minutes for a table to be ready.  The hype train is mostly right. The crawfish and sausage were delicious. Captain boil sauce is the way to go! The cajun fries are basically Popeye's fries. No difference at all. If you love that, then this place is for you!  Service was actually quite good despite being so busy and packed. I could see everyone having a great time eating with their hands. Its more of an experience than the food per se. Taste was good but not wow. So keep that in mind. Its about going with people and sharing food. That's what this was about in the south usa anyways.   It can get pricey depending on what you order. Go with the crawfish and sausge and corn! Best combo :D 4 stars ****"}
{"text":"We happened to be in the College / Yonge vicinity and came across this place.  What a find! Not a lot of tables, but loved the concept.  You order seafood, order the spice for it.  They do it up as a boil, deliver it in a bag and put it on your table. VERY casual dining. You must get your hands right in there to truly enjoy.  Since we are largely talking shellfish -- mussels, shrimps, crab -- let's face it folks - it's not going to be cheap. I have to say though, thought it was fun and good value for the money.  We had the crab -- it was cut and quite easy to eat -- and YUMMY. We also had the mussels and the rice. The rice portion was large -- next time I would probably pass on it and go for more crab!  Anyways - looking for a fun and messy time? Give it a spin!"}
{"text":"Never been to a seafood place where you only use your hands? No worries! You can finally do it in the comforts of Captains Boil with the following provided by the excellent staff:  1. Pair of plastic gloves   2. 1x bib for you messy eaters   That's all - if you want a different dining experience and see if your date is all that adventurous as he/she claim to be? Captains Boil will be your litmus test.   Wondering where to start with the menu?   Begin with a pound of mussels & shrimp (I'd recommend choose Captain's Boil sauce, don't ask why) add in a few orders of buttered corn of cobs and you're ready to roll :-)    The staff are friendly and they'll be more than happy to guide you into your virgin experience of eating messily with your hands. It's like being a kid again!"}
{"text":"First time here, and it lived up to the hype.  If you like to get messy, and love seafood, then this is the place!  No cutlery, you leave the shrimp shells on the table, and you wear a plastic bib and gloves!!!  If you're high into manners when eating, then please check your snooty attitude at the door.  This place is about food, at good value!  Service was excellent.  Wait staff seemed really nice, and knew what they were talking about, even though the Richmond Hill location is relatively new.  Décor is really nice too, very trendy and clean.  Get the Sizzling platter before 4PM, and you get a bonus (2 crawfish, 2 shrimps, 2 mussels, and 2 clams).  The Captain's Boil sauce is a bit spicy, so even Medium is rather spicy for the less adventurous.  All in all, a wonderful and unique experience!  Will return very soon."}
{"text":"Came here with my parents on a Sunday. Service was great, the food was okay. Lacking flavours in their sauces. We ordered crayfish, shrimp and chicken tenders with fries and some corn. The garlic sauce was great but overpowered by the amount of butter it took to make it. Same with the captains boil sauce. The fries were fantastic, I love comparing it to costco style fries. Chicken tenders were good but the order only came with three. My mom left her phone here and we didn't realize until we drove 30 minutes back home. My mom called it and someone from the restaurant answered. That was very kind of them to hang on to it!"}
{"text":"I am conflicted about how to rate my experience at The Captain's Boil (TCB).  The source of conflict is that I could see why some people enjoy the food and find the dining experience unique.  However, TCB is not everyone's cup of tea.  I will try to be as fair as possible, and as concise as possible.  Why you would like TCB:  - The shellfish is fresh and not over-cooked.  And when it is so, the natural sweetness comes through  - You buy the shellfish by pound.  For the same cost, you will get more seafood here than at a regular Canadian seafood restaurant  - The Cajun sauce and The Captain Boil's sauce are flavourful  - Eating with hands can be fun  - The decor is welcoming, causal yet effortlessly tasteful  Why you would not like TCB:  - You must order one pound of same shellfish.  You cannot mix 1/2 pound of 2 things in one order.    - Eating with hands could be too much work for some people  - The sauces are so salty, rich and oily that they are most definitely not good for your arteries.  But then, this is why they taste so good  -  The side orders are over-priced.    - Plastic bags and disposable dinnerware  My opinion:  - I liked the freshness of the seafood and the value proposition.  I got bored eating one whole pound of the same thing.  - I found the Cajun sauce delicious.  I would suggest TCB to introduce a sauce that is less salty and oily as an healthier option.    - There were many empty shells in the orders of mussels and clams, to the extent that I would suggest people to avoid ordering clams and mussels, just for the value of money sake.  - I am not a big fan of the plastic bags concept.  I consider TCB a fun experience.  I may take tourists to it if they are interested."}
{"text":"Food and service were great. We got shrimp, Cajun fries and rice. Everything was tasty. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"We thoroughly enjoyed the king crab and fried rice - will definitely go back! Great friendly service too!"}
{"text":"I've been to so many Captain's boil locations that by now I can point out which ones have the boil best sauce. This one did not live up to my standards. Service was mediocre and unattentive.  As for food, I ordered the usual: shrimp, crab legs, corn, potatoes, and rice.  The quantity of shrimp was small the quantity of crab legs was even smaller, the corn was OMG tiny! for $1.25 a piece and the potatoes were...potatoes. Oh, and the rice was pretty hard and dry.  If you're craving Captain's Boil you're better off going to their original location (ie. Yonge and Finch)"}
{"text":"I've tried the Captain's Boil at the North York location prior to visiting the one downtown. Both are identical in terms of the food and menu offerings. Overall, the flavours were consistent and not too overpowering. I've tried the shrimp, clams, crab legs, and many cobs of corn, all of which were generous portions.   Only downside to my recent visit was this unattractive, unappealing, and a bit daunting, yellow sign that was posted on their door upon entry to the restaurant. A conditional health and safety pass.  Hopefully that'll get fixed up upon their next inspection."}
{"text":"AHHHH captains boil... the place that started the GTA trend of boiling seafood places. Firstly, I like the spaciousness of this location compared to Willowdale. Secondly, the service was pretty good. Not amazing, but not bad. I am actually so confused about the reviews on here....mostly everyone agrees on the good food but some people say service is spot on, some hate it, so I think that's what's bringing down the stars on here.  Third, food is great. Best things are clams, shrimp and muscles. In captains boil sauce, medium spicy. We even took some home and it tasted even better cold for the later night! Overall, good place, would return!"}
{"text":"The simple concept they have is when they serve their boiled seafood in plastic bags mixed with their homemade Captain Boil's sauce. Though you can choose to not have any sauce but I think it's only worth it best when you do otherwise it is just boiled seafood that you can homecook :)  Order your seafood by the weight with a choice of spice including cajun, lemon pepper, garlic sauce or \"Captain's Boil\", which is the combination of all three. Though I haven't tried the other spices before, the waitress recommended the Captain's Boil sauce and I definitely don't think that was the wrong choice. Tastes great and you get the best of the world: all three flavours!  The clams, snow crab legs, and shrimp was very tasty full of flavour. Highly highly highly do not recommend the crawfish. The taste is disgusting and it is not worth the price nor even just eating it in general. There is not much to eat from it and it has its own taste that is not good. It would be a waste of money to get it.   Overall, try once but it'll be awhile before coming back again."}
{"text":"This place ranks amongst the top for me when it comes to boils. Everything was fantastic! Care was given for everything! The lights, the decor, the atmosphere, the place is amazing. This place is MUCH larger than the captains boil at yonge and shepherd. I literally walked in at friday night and was seated right away. What?! You mean I dont have to put my name on an ipad?! Incredible. This coupled alone with lots of parking would bring back most. Then we sat down and had our food, the attentiveness is amazing! Checking to see if we needed anything all night to make sure we  were comfortable and we were satisfied. We made a small request with the lobster and it ws promptly done! This place blows LA boil out of the water with its canon! It was tastier, service was better, and overall better experience. Sorry to yonge and finch captains boil, but our stomaches have been stolen and now belong to captains boil vaughn"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to this restaurant with great expectations as we love seafood and Cajun cooking.  I would have given a 1 star rating if it had not been for the food which was actually very good.  The service was absolutely terrible and very disorganized. There is a combination of bad attitude and just plain inexperience with how to create a good customer experience. We arrived around 5:30 pm with no line up and many open tables. It took over 10 minutes to be greeted while the hostess was chatting at the bar. After being seated, it took over 15 minutes to have a server come by and after I had to ask another server to find our server. After ordering 2 beers, another 15 minutes. This was very disturbing and really spoiled our dinning experience.  I realize this restaurant has only been open for about 1 month but I expect much more. Where is the management who should be overseeing customer service???  One other issue: the air handling system seemed to be off and the place was extremely stuffy. So we asked about this. Then all of a sudden there is air flow!  Such a shame. Poor management, inexperience, and certain employees who have no concept of how to serve customers and display bad attitudes.  If I return to give them another try, I am going to wait a while until they hopefully get their act together."}
{"text":"This isnt my first time in this location but the last time I went was horrible, service wise. We literally waited for more than 30 minutes for each food to come and the moment we followed up with our order they told us they had an issue with their printer,  and said that our food is gonna come after 5 minutes. We patiently waited for all the orders to come but after 5 minutes we only received a piece of corn which we ordered and at the same time another guy brought us calamari which we already got. Overall, I wouldn't brag on the taste of the food but the service was really horrible. Management need to cooperate with each other. Lastly, whats more disappointing is that the supervisor of the restaurant was the one who took our order."}
{"text":"Food was really good, place was well maintained. Staff was super friendly and I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Toronto's finally caught up with the west coast. If you don't compare it to Boiling Crab, it'll be a very delicious experience! Overall satisfied!"}
{"text":"I've been to Captain's boil before, but at a different location. Initially our server was very helpful and explained the menu to the entire party members. We ordered 3 shrimp bags, one fish and chips platter and one lobster sandwich. Shrimps were nice and tender. Fish and chips needed lemon juice as they were dry and the lobster sandwich sandwich never came. When asked for it, they claimed to have forgotten it.. if you wanna go I'd suggest going to a different location where they don't forget what you ordered and the service is way better."}
{"text":"This is my first Yelp review, prompted by the most recent purchase at this location. I have come to this location multiple times over the past 1.5 year, and I always do takeout (don't like eating messy in public). So I cannot say anything about their service for dining in. In fact, their takeout service has been really good every time. So my review is focused on their food, which I would rate 4 star based on previous experiences, but only 1 for the most recent one.   Previously the food was relatively fresh and sauce was thick and flavorful. There was only once when the sauce (Captain boil sauce) was too salty, but I was okay with that. However, this time the sauce was extremely bland! It not only lacked salt, but also there was no butter taste. The flavor just lacked so much intensity that I would think it's diluted with 50% water! Secondly, the shrimp tasted like it had gone bad in a weird way. The shrimp almost had a metallic and sour taste to it,  so I could not even finish that one shrimp. Not wanting to risk it (bad seafood is dangerous), I tossed everything. If I were close to the restaurant, I would have gone in to get things exchanged/refunded.   Anyway, I don't think I would go in this specific location again in future. Will give the other stores a try, because I actually miss how good the sauce was when it was at its prime."}
{"text":"I came around 6:30 on a weekday and there wasn't much of a wait. Perhaps this means the hype is dying. You come here mainly for the experience. Maybe a gimmicky way to get people to pay for an overpriced bag of boiled seafood but it was quite fun. Everyone gets a bib and gloves, though I think they should give you a box of gloves as they get soaked pretty quickly!    My favourite sauce is Captain's Boil, though the garlic one was quite good as well (very heavy on the garlic and butter). I think the price for the mussels and clams is OK, but it does get expensive when it comes to lobster/crab. The truth is - boiling seafood in a bag of sauce is extremely easy to make at home and the premium on lobster/crab could be better used on wok fried styles that you can't replicate at home. The food was good though, so next time I'll get mussels take out as a snack. As expected, seafood is costly to get full from."}
{"text":"I ordered a pound crawfish with captain boil sauce and a pound shrimp in garlic sauce online. My husband likes the shrimp more, I like the crawfish. Will definitely order again for a sports night."}
{"text":"Since when did it become okay to serve food in plastic bags? Turn off number one. I brought my boyfriend for his birthday expecting this place to live up to the hype only to be completely and utterly disappointed. We ordered snow crab legs, shrimp, mussels, broccoli, potatoes and rice. The snow crabs were not pre-cracked and were incredibly difficult to open as we were not given any tools before asking. Turn off number two, the shrimp were not de-veined meaning we had to put even that much more effort into our dinner. The only thing we didn't have to do was kill the shrimp ourselves really. The mussels were okay. The broccoli was $7 for not even a head of broccoli, menu says it would come in garlic sauce but it was just steamed with butter. The potato was just that, a potato in a bag, cut in half and tasteless. I would tell you about the rice, but unfortunately or not, it never made it to our table. After struggling with a few shrimp and one or two crab legs, we gave up frustrated. We really just wanted to leave and were completely turned off by the whole experience. After waiting and waiting for a waitress or a staff member to come by, I had to seek out the manager myself, and tell him about my experience. I offered to pay for a small portion of the meal yet he still came back with a $35 bill, claiming that as a manager, he's powerless to make any changes. Will never be returning to any of these franchises again."}
{"text":"Just finished eating here, food was amazing but service was the worst. Young Asian waitress with glasses clearly does not know how to serve customers. Me and my boyfriend were the only people in the restaurant and she did not acknowledge us or refill our water once. Instead she chose to have a seat and eat with her friend. Classy. Hire better employees."}
{"text":"Their downtown location is fairly new, however when we arrived there there was a line up and we waited 30 mins to be seated. We ordered two bags of shrimp with captain boil special sauce and mild spice. However, after removing the shrimp shell's you dont taste the fancy sauce. Probably I should ask for a dip sauce. The experience of eating the sea food with gloves by it self was a great experience. Service was fine. For sure I suggest this place and probably will go there again."}
{"text":"Had a great meal with my family. Kids thought food in bag idea was fun, I was grateful for the plastic bib and gloves as dinner can get a bit messy! Highly recommend mussels and clams, both served in garlic sauce - very yummy and mussels were huge. Fried shrimp basket and fried calamari were great. Sizzling plate combo of fish teriyaki, not so good. Fish was over cooked and chewy. Also recommend Cajun seafood rice as everyone loved it and it was spiced just right (and it was served on an actual plate with a real spoon!). Biggest problem I had with restaurant was that it said bags food are served in are bio-degradable which is nice to know, except that everything else is served to you in either plastic cups, plastic spoons, styrofoam containers, plastic straws and is just picked up and tossed at end of meal. I'd be much happier if they used glass and porcelain and metal cutlery. At least then you know it's being washed and reused rather than a one-time use and tossed into trash. That aside, meal was very good, and everyone left full and happy. Service was awesome too. Very attentive staff and patiently explained menu to us newbies."}
{"text":"Captain's Boil is one of those places that you just go once just to try it out. The concept is neat though it can get messy and the crab shells cut through your gloves so the greasy sauce gets into them. You get a choice of a few sauces for your food and can choose the level of spiciness. We got the Captain's Boil, non spicy sauces for everything. The seafood tasted good but by the third pound of food, everything pretty much started tasting the same. Do yourself a favour and order a side of fries to throw into those bags full of sauce after you finish all the seafood. Your inner fatty will thank you.  The place is pretty pricey though and the wait for us was 1.5 hrs. Service wasn't great either. Waiters looked overworked, no one gave us water and hard to flag people down to order more food. Cool concept but for the price you pay, I prefer going to a steakhouse."}
{"text":"This review is based more on the headache this place gave me than the food.   I knew it would be busy because I can see the restaurant from my condo. I made reservations over 3 weeks in advance for 12 people for Boxing Day. They said they would call me the week of just to confirm again.  The week of my reservation came around and I didn't receive a call. Having no faith in people being able to do their job, I called them on Christmas Eve to make sure my reservation was still okay for the Saturday. They said there was no such reservation under my name.  They took my reservation again and I hoped it would stick this time.  Saturday comes around (the day of my reservation) and they call me around 3pm to confirm my party for 7pm. I called no more than 10 minutes later to change it to 8pm with no issues. I made sure to get the guy's name just in case they lost my reservation again. I won't throw him under the bus here though lol  We arrived at 7:45pm for our 8pm table as requested, only to find out that he didn't actually change the reservation to 8pm and gave the table away. The hostess asked us to wait 10-15 minutes for them to move tables around to make space for my party. It took more like an hour.   I make reservations because I'm not the type of person who will wait more than 10 minutes for restaurant lineups, no matter how good people say it is. I get hangry! My friends and I had to wander into Hmart and pretend to look at makeup to keep warm because there was no space to wait inside.  the lineup in the restaurant was going up the stairs and next to people eating beside the entrance. I would hate to have people hovering around me while I'm gorging.   Anyways we finally got a table upstairs. Food arrived quickly except for the lobster which took awhile. They screwed up my sauce twice, but being so hungry, I just ate it anyways. I had to ask three times for ice even though I first ordered it with my drink.  Clams, shrimp, lobster, and cajun fried rice were plenty for two people. Captain's boil sauce was delish, but really heavy. You'll have garlic breath, but I love extra garlic so no shame here.   It's fun for the novelty, but pricey for what it is. I probably wouldn't go there again just because of the ordeal it took to make a reservation and get a table.   Oh yeah, no crawfish (not in season). And dungess crab was sold out on a Saturday.   Good luck!!"}
{"text":"I think its interesting but I won't go back.  Its messy, really messy. You can barely hold onto your drink. Seafood was good but i dont want to peel shrimp. Sauces overwhelmed the seafood. Expensive for what you get."}
{"text":"This restaurant is definitely my favorite seafood restaurant. If u want to enjoy nice seafood and want a excellent service. This one is design for you! All the waitress and waiter are so nice they will recommend u the seafood depends on your personally flavor. High recommend seafood lover!"}
{"text":"Was just here tonight Dec 27 around 7 pm with 3 other of my friends.  While the food was some what decent compared to their other locations this place still fell short.  We were promptly seated although they were quite busy.  Our server did not come to our table until 15 minutes after we were seated and asked us if we had been here before, which we said no. He went through how to order in a rushed tone. We asked for water, and when he came back we were ready to order.   We ordered 4 lbs of a variety of seafood, each lbs had its own add on (ex. Mussels and sausage, shrimp and corn etc), the rice and Cajun fries.  When we got our food, one of the orders was wrong (gave us 2 lbs of clams when we just asked for one).  They checked and confirmed our order was screwed up, but no apology.  When our last order finally came (shrimp and corn), the entire bag had just ONE corn.   I didn't know I was paying $1.25 for each small slice of corn.....either it was per piece or they just gave us one corn slice.  Secondly, most of the clams we got were empty. The ones that were open had no meat, and there was a bunch not opened (likely dead).  Our server never came to check on us, and we got water refills from other servers.  Overall this experience errs on the dissatisfied and disappointed side, especially since this was not a cheap meal.  If I ordered a plate of fried rice and got one shrimp in it, I would laugh and just eat it since its not expensive.  But when your spending over $100, and dont get good food, at least give me good service.   Very mediocre food, pricey AND bad service.....well what can I say?"}
{"text":"Three stars for the service. During our whole time there it was friendly and helpful and we felt welcomed.  The Captain's boil is one of those places you go once for the experience but wouldn't be inclined to go back again. You order your \"catch\" by the pound - lobster/crayfish (seasonal), crab legs, clams, oysters, shrimp, and chicken if you don't want seafood. You pick your sauce - we picked the Captain's boil sauce. The food comes in a clear plastic bag.  The clams were good. Many fell out of their shells and drowned in the sauce it becomes too salty. We got it with mild spice, which actually tastes better than the one with no spice! The shrimp was average. It was hot! Be careful when you're eating them. Your mouth is more used to hot food than your fingers. We got one pound of clams (11.95) and one pound of shrimp (13.95) and portions were definitely not enough. I'm a small eater and even I was still hungry.  We ordered a side of cajun seafood fried rice. The rice was kind of like the kind you get when you order sticky rice. Good, but so salty and so buttery. You have been warned. Minimal amount of seafood and not worth 11/12 dollars.   I'm not one to be particularly passionate about the environment but I was kind of shocked at how much waste just two people made. Shrimp/clam shells, the plastic bags, paper towel (there is a whole paper towel roll for you to use), the plastic bibs, the plastic gloves, the plastic cups they give you for water (!), the can of Coke, and the brown paper table covering would all go to the garbage. Two people! Can you imagine four or even a bigger group of ten?  It actually made me a little uncomfortable and trust me when I say I'm really not one to be very passionate about the environment as bad as that sounds. But this was bad.  I wouldn't come back. It was mildly interesting to eat out of a bag with gloves but it's not worth another trip. Service is great though."}
{"text":"I love their fish platter with captain's boil sauces but only available after lunch. Their lobster is also good and little more pricey.  I always been to Sheppard and yonge and other locations but at Bayview it's first time, and I found it's very congested and cozy, also low lightings. Otherwise it was okay."}
{"text":"So good!  We came for lunch, not only did we eat some delicious seafood, but we had so much fun! From the bibs to the gloves and eating with our hands this dining experience is pure joy!  We shared the shrimp and mussels both with the Captains Sauce (which we highly recommend: A blend of Cajun, Lemon-Pepper and Garlic)  We'll be back and we're coming for the lobster, crawfish and crab next!  Bravo Captains Boil nice to have some more options in our North York neighborhood!"}
{"text":"2nd time coming to a Captains Boil ever and I have to say it's good only if you believe it's worth the mess. I got shrimp and also had a chance to try the mussels. I love the Captain's Boil sauce because it combines all 3 flavours offered. The CB sauce is not too salty and is very smooth -- great for seafood. In terms of spice, anyone who is accustomed to regular hot sauce (tabasco or sriracha) Medium is fine and you can probably handle the hottest.   I also tried the fried cajun rice (a little spicy) on the side -- it's very delicious and well seasoned, would recommend it! I also suggest adding corn into the mix you choose, it's great mixed with the seasoning.  Overall an interesting experience eating with your hands... if you have the patience for it haha. They do however have options that don't require you to eat with your hands. Probably would only come back if it were for an occasion."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday dinner with the wifey. We ordered the lobster and the crab with a side or corn on the cob with the standard Captains Boil sauce. The seafood was fresh and the sauce was damn good. Corn on the cob with this sauce is a must have. Service was good and the experience was fun with food served in bags and the bib and plastic gloves and all. Although very pricey if going with the lobster and crab option but definatley worth it for that special occassion."}
{"text":"I think,I'm just not into the whole boil in the bag seafood thing because I sort of found this disgusting.  Also this must be the worst name for a restaurant ever -   Q \"Where's the Captains Boil?\" A  \"On his backside\""}
{"text":"I had a fantastic lunch at Captain's Boil. The service was polite, the food was flavourful and filling, and the place was clean with great decor. My table ordered a pound of shrimp and the seafood sizzling plate combo with the Captain's Boil spice at mild. I highly recommend both dishes! The shrimp was crisp and succulent, and the sizzling plate had a nice sampling of their seafoods. Next time, I'm definitely trying the mussels at a higher heat level! (On a side note: if you're looking for good value, don't go for the lobsters or crabs)."}
{"text":"It is a long wait. I was thinking if those plastic bags are food graded ok for serving hot food.  I appreciate new concept but i am not sure how the chefs handled.  Overall food is ok and a new way for me to eat."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the fish teriyaki lunch special. The food was very hot (served on one of those sizzle platters mmm!) and the seafood side was delicious! It is definitely a good value. I really liked the Captain's Boil sauce.   The only complaint I have is that we ran out of water and spent a long time trying to get more (waiters kept forgetting about us, forgot to get us water even after we asked, kept trying to flag them down)."}
{"text":"Yay for seafood!  This new captain's boil chain opened up in lieu of the golden elephant pho place. Good change? Yea, I'd say so.  Went here with a friend and we ordered 2 lbs of clams, 1 lb of mussels, and a Cajun fried rice. Needless to say, we were both stuffed to the max, and our bill came up to be around $48 for 2.  The captain's boil sauce is bomb! It's so good. However, if you taste it for too long then it can get gross because it tastes very buttery. Imagine the calories in that sauce....  My overall experience was pretty good, but 1 star off for the gross fattening feeling in my stomach that's still lingering... and it has been at least 5 hours since I've eaten at captain's boil."}
{"text":"Based off the popular Boiling Crab restaurant in the states and it hit pretty close to the taste. So why the low rating? The ridiculous price they charge for such a novelty.  Everything is boiled in a bag with the spices mixed in. The spices are just a mix of butter, garlic, lemon, pepper, and cajun. All this can be easily replicated at home for minimal prices and done better by anyone who has minimal knowledge of cooking.   Some fun facts about seafood:  Shellfish and crustacean in general have heavy shells and yield very little meat. For a lobster, on average yields about 25% meat to weight ratio, but also depends on the lobster. It never reaches a threshold greater than 35% from my experience weighing it (small sample size I know, but more information can be found online). Shrimps tend to be around 50%, but can be deceiving when cooked as water is lost in the process and they shrink. I'll admit these were decently sized and good \"value\".  Mussels - $10/lb - the meat is only 25% of the total weight UNCOOKED, so yes 75+% of what you are paying for is shells and butter  Clams - $12/lb - 25%-35% meat ratio uncooked, yep....same as above  King crab - $35/ONE leg!?!? - I love how the server tried to up sell us on this saying they're \"big crab legs\".....almost flipped the table . You know there is an issue with pricing when the crab legs are more expensive than an ENTIRE LOBSTER. Yes, god damn $29/lobster....which by my guess would be a good 3 or 4 pounds.   I have nothing against restaurants that charge a premium, but there has to be something more than the novelty.   What are you getting exactly?  Food that is difficult to execute and takes time to prepare? Nope Maybe the food is visually appealing? Nope Great service? I'll say too early to judge, new restaurants tend to struggle An overpriced one-time experience? Yep."}
{"text":"I give a 1 because: Rice was greasy and gross Lobster included all parts and barely meaty, they gave more head lobster than tails cheap The food was so greasy, the sauces were all super greasy. If you want to eat like a mess go here.  They serve you bags of food like you are a dog. No effort into presentation or ease of eating. I suspect they have frozen bags ready to be boiled in the back. Then just heat up and serve disgusting"}
{"text":"good staff and great food. The cajun fries and shrimp are my fav!"}
{"text":"I wish the service was a bit better :(  Anyways! I dinned here with my family for uncles birthday and there was about 9 nine people. I called ahead a made reservations. We were seated promptly. PS!! It was my family's first time at captions boil so they had no clue what they were getting themselves into.  Our server explained how it works to the best of her ability. The food was excellent, no complaints. I just wish that I didn't have to ask for a refill on water and soda constantly.  Overall my family and I cannot wait to go back :)"}
{"text":"Pfft.  Waste of money.  LA Boil across the street was a million times better, both in terms of quality of food and value for money.  We went during the grand opening lobster special, so a whole (small) lobster was $16 - regular price is FOURTY ONE DOLLARS?!?  Gross.  The garlic butter was all garlic, no butter; the Cajun flavour was also all garlic, with a shitload of curry-like flavour (nothing against curry, but it ain't Cajun).  For $20 we got 1/2 a crab; $7 for okra that wasn't even cooked properly....oh, and the beer selection sucks.  Our bill, with tip (it's not the server's fault the restaurant sucks) was $75, and that's a crime.  Seriously disappointing - a crappy place jumping on the boil bandwagon."}
{"text":"The Captain's Boil was a place my party and I chose last minute. We tried most of their seafood dishes, and a few sides of fries and calamari. Nonetheless less, I would most definitely not go here again. Let me break it down...  Pros: Amazing staff that were quick and attentive. The food came out promptly, still hot and fresh. Customers were provided the right utensils and equipments to eat comfortably without ruining their clothes and dirtying their hand. Therefore service, and the atmosphere itself was great.  Cons: Despite providing a great service, the seafood dishes itself felt overwhelming when it was seasoned. I was unable to appreciate the natural aroma and taste of the seafood itself due to the fact that it was drenched by the seasoning. All I was able to taste was a whole lot of butter and garlic.  Overall, great staff, management and decor. However, stars were greatly reduced due to the overwhelming masking of natural aromas."}
{"text":"Come eat like a bunch of hungry raccoons and test out your inner primal cave man skills at the Captains boil. The specialty here is Seafood folks. Served in the ubiquitous bags eaten on the table with minimal cutlery. I first had tried this concept at Hot N juicy Crawfish in Vegas and it was incredible. I've also heard the boiling crab in LA Koreatown is another American example. Captains boil has done a good job in copying this concept. However I didn't find the flavour as good as H and J. You can order a variety of Seafood - crab legs (dungess, snow, king), shrimp, mussels, lobster (when in season), clams and chicken (for the land lubber). Then you choose your sauce (Cajun, Lemon pepper, garlic or mix all three (Captains boil). Oh yes the you can order level of spice and that's how it works. You can order a variety of sides and of course some nice draft beer to wash it down. The food is a decent 3.5/5. We went with mussels and chicken (for my daughter) with fried rice. Food was garlicky however I wasn't blown away. I'd like to come here and try a few other dishes."}
{"text":"Yum. Still a solid 4 the second time around. Bagful of seafood is delicious. Get the clams is so worth it with Cajun sauce. Lobster and dungeoness crab are $36 market price right now but it's worth the splurge. They're meaty! Skip the other crabs there's barely anything in them. The lotus root and corn are yummy add ins you can throw in your seafood bag. Portion size is good. You actually get full from ordering one or two items. You have to order the right items though."}
{"text":"Bomb food & fast service! Highly recommended. When we arrived it was pretty packed but the server told us it'll be an 10 min wait and it ended up being only 2 mins. Food came really fast and it was delicious!! My favourite was the mussels & shrimp in captains boil sauce.  Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Will not come back here again for these reasons:  1. We ordered snow crab legs and king crab , but it was hard to crack open without proper utensils. We asked for scissors but they only offered ONE scissors per table ..are they that cheap that they can't afford to buy more scissors per table? So I have to wait for my 5 other friends to finish using it before getting my hands on it not to mention how dirty the ONE pair of scissors got?   2. We asked if they had any seafood picks and all they had were plastic forks. Having to wear over-sized plastic gloves without proper utensils and one scissor per table was just a delightful experience..   3. The  sauce was tasty but extremely oily, needless to say my stomach didn't take it well and i had a diarrhea the next day.  4. Can they be any more environmentally friendly?  Between all plastic bags, plastic utensils, plastic gloves and paper we used I can't imagine the amount of excessive waste they generate in a day. I hope they invest in more environmentally friendly cutlery, perhaps from all the money they save on scissors? Is it even healthy to eat hot cooked food out of plastic bag?"}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday around 8pm as a party of 2 and we had to wait 2 hours to be seated and another 20 minutes for the food. We were initially told the wait was going to be 1.5 hours but ended up being 2. We left our number, went somewhere else to kill time, then came back.   Despite the wait, we really liked this place! They had one pound snow crab for $18.99 so I got that in captains boil sauce in medium spiciness and it was perfect! Loved the garlicy buttery spice!! :d My friend got the clams in garlic sauce and he was very satisfied as well. And omg the cajun fries were prepped fresh and were seasoned just right. I couldn't stop eating them lol.   The only downsides other than the long wait was the service. I think most servers tried to be attentive despite being really busy, but there was one or two that were rather rude. I think if they were less busy they would've been much more nicer though. Also, things get reaaaal messy as you eat everything with your hands. Once you eat your food, everything you touch, like your drink, gets sauce on it which got on my nerves a little bit lol. Not only that, the gloves were really loose on my hands so the red sauce would touch my cheeks when I'm simply trying to put food in my mouth, making things even messier.   But the downsides are so minor. Food was very good and with the 10% soft opening discount, our bill was only $35 ish (ordered 1 lb snow crab, 1 lb clams, cajun fries, and 2 cans of pop). Wooow good food and such a good price! I left the place happy and satisfied. I'm glad this wasn't another over-hyped place. I will be back to try other things on the menu (def not on a two-hour wait though) and I'm going to stick with the captain's boil sauce again! Loves!"}
{"text":"3.5/5, +.5 for service  Well, this is definitely a unique addition to the community, and the hype blew up very fast here. I definitely wouldn't think I'd be served food in a plastic bag, nor would I actually be expected to eat from food in a plastic bag!  All that aside, to enjoy this experience you actually have to dine here. Unfortunately they only take reservations for 6 people or more, though under exceptional circumstances they will take reservations for 4. The first time I tried to dine here on Saturday night, I arrived at 9:15pm and was told the wait was 2 hours long. I noped right out of there, but only after I made a reservation for Sunday night at 8pm. Since I was only a table of 3, AND because I reserved in-person, I was granted to be first on the 8pm waiting list that night.  Sunday night came and I got my table after about 10 minutes of waiting. We were seated upstairs, where there are two large seatings and two small seatings available. There's a dedicated server upstairs, so waving down someone to take our order wasn't hard at all.  We had the lobsters, king crab, two rounds of clams, and raw oysters. We had the captain's boil sauce for everything except one of the rounds of clams, in which we had the garlic sauce instead. The clams with garlic sauce and raw oysters came first, and I must say the clams were very good considering they were only $11.95. There were a couple of clams whose shells weren't open though. The raw oysters were on the smaller side, and I definitely preferred Nomé's raw oysters over this place.  The lobsters and king crab were both very good as well, and despite the fact both were only 1lb, they packed a lot of seafood meat into both shells so it was enough to share. The captain's boil sauce was okay, but I didn't find it mix very well with the garlic sauce. Next time for me I would just go with the garlic sauce and the cajun cajun separate.  After all this, the environmental side of my mind wanted to wonder if all the plastic bags and disposable utensils get recycled or reused eventually. While I understand the convenience aspect of this kind of dining, I really don't like supporting restaurants that clearly don't have an environmental mandate when it comes to post-dining cleaning.  Service was excellent, and I liked how there was always a server in the upper level to handle tasks for its customers upstairs. He was also very knowledgeable about the products and knows very well about its specials.  To sum this long review up, I will likely return for special occasions. However I really want this place to be transparent on how they contribute to benefiting the environment, considering the large amounts of plastic bags they use in making these meals."}
{"text":"+.5 for service  Captain's Boil has opened its third location at York Mills and Don Mills, which is more accessible than the other two locations if you're driving. There's ample parking here as well since you're sharing the lot with three other very busy restaurants.  In terms of the three locations, this one easily has the biggest restaurant space, and IMO has the most unique design. The lobster painted on the wall was very well done, and there's lots of TVs around so it feels like a sports bar (no, it's not a sports bar).  I came here on a Saturday night with my family and the place was full seated, but there was no lineup. Considering the lack of advertising for this place (found out thru someone who works here) that's actually pretty good. Having been to Captain's Boil before I have a good idea of the menu, although there are some items here that are exclusive, at least from what I remember, such as chicken slices.  I ordered the usual pounds of clams, one with captain's boil sauce and the other with garlic sauce. I also decided to try some of their exclusive items, such as chicken slices and red sausage. Their clams are a lot bigger and juicier than the Yonge/Finch location, which was quite nice. However, what really surprised me were the chicken slices. They were really juicy! I didn't really have much expectations as I thought they were just normal chicken slices, but nope...definitely some of the best I had. The red sausage was also very good as well.  The sauce itself was similar to the other locations, so I assume the same formula was used. However the cajun sauce is a little oily for what it is.  Service was excellent, which was impressive considering this place just opened. I was told the workers here had training in the other locations before they were moved, which was really smart of management.  I definitely recommend this location if you're coming from the highway, and for those who haven't tried Captain's Boil because of location...give it a try now!"}
{"text":"Overall a poor experience. They were short staffed, which is fine, but we did wait an extremely long time for our food (which came at different times so I waited even longer for my meal).   My main issues, other than the wait:   1) There was a short wavy dark hair in my food (it was under a piece of shrimp I lifted up, so I know it wasn't mine). I didn't bring it up to the staff because I was hungry enough after waiting that I just moved it off my plate.   2) Not a huge issue, but one of my mother's two crawfish had eggs still attached to it. I found it pretty disgusting but some may find it appetizing.    3) At the very end, I was going to tip *cash* to the waiters so I did not include it in the credit payment. The male waiter got sassy as he gave the receipt and mentioned in a demanding, expecting tone about how the tip is not included in the total. Cool guy, I was going to give you some pocket change but nevermind. Also, tipping is still an OPTIONAL practice, depending on how much the customer has and is VOLUNTARILY willing to compensate you extra. You are not entitled to a tip."}
{"text":"Best night ever during fall break in Toronto!!! Got denied table at a hoity toity seafood restaurant, came here instead for one last dinner before going back to NC. Got a table right away, ordered clam, shrimp and mussel, had a blast with friends!! The taste was extraordinary! And I keep eating until I can't stuff even a bit down my stomach any more! The staffs were really helpful and friendly! Totally fell in love with this place will definitely try it out again in the future! This is a place for you to have a great night with friends or just a fun date night!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for a late lunch and ordered their sizzling plate and got chicken with rice, chicken with udon,corns, large basket of chicken wings and clams. They gave a lot of chicken which filled us up nicely. However I didn't taste anything special about their captain's boil sauce on the clams. Overall a decent meal and affordable... but I felt like the sizzling plate had a bit too much butter. Before 4pm the sizzling plates are $8.95."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my partner one day. We were hoping that it wouldn't be busy, and luckily for us, it only started to get busy after we sat down. The place filled up within 30 minutes and it was just after 1pm!  The atmosphere is very casual. It was surprisingly quiet when we got there. Once we started eating, we realized why it was so quiet--everyone was just too busy eating their food and crunching on shellfish!  The service was good. They forgot our cajun fries order, but it wasn't a big deal--we just ordered them again in the middle of our meal. The servers are all young adults and Asian. They were friendly and helpful with making choices from the menu. They also give you a bib and a whole roll of paper towels, along with plastic gloves to eat with. Very convenient!  We ordered the lobster, dungeness crab, shrimp, and cajun fries. The lobster was our fave, then the crab, then the shrimp. The lobster had some meat, but not very much of it. The crab took a lot of work to eat but had a decent amount of meat.  The overall quantity of food was good for two people. We were told that people tend to order about 3-4 lbs of food for two people, so usually 3-4 items from the menu.  We didn't realize until afterwards that there was a backside to the menu where you can also order other cooked dishes such as fish teriyaki with rice. It's okay though because we were there for the seafood boil! The fries were so crunchy and spicy and it was probably a bad mistake to read the reviews that suggested dipping the fries in the sauce--it was soo good but soo bad for you. As for flavours, we got mild for our level of spice. It was definitely spicy enough to leave us sniffling a bit by the end. Captain's Boil flavouring was also our preference over the cajun one, which seemed to lack a bit of salt.  Finally, the bill was quite hefty. For two of us, it came to $115 including taxes and gratuity.  I don't think I'd come back on a regular basis but it was definitely a neat experience and the food was pretty good.  Note: Make sure you don't wear anything nice and fancy when coming to this place! It gets messy and your hair and clothes will also smell like food afterwards."}
{"text":"The restaurant decoration is very special, I ordered king crabs, shrimps, mussels and clams with different flavours, they all are tasted good! and the staffs are nice too, good food, good service, will come back again!"}
{"text":"I went to this place 3 times. It is not because their seafood are spectacular, but just wanted to take my family to try.  We tried 1lb each of everything on the menu. The mussels were over cooked. The best were the lobsters. It never disappoint me or us everytime I ordered them.  However, I was worry the plastic gloves and bags while I was eating. It just made me wonder because nowadays ppl are talking about BPA and other chemical....  Overall, they have some nice sauce and very good lobsters with great price. If I go again, I will just order lobsters instead."}
{"text":"Be the 1st to comment! love the seafood in Cajun spicy style, taste awesome Particularly in winter! Love this new one for its location and lots of Parking, good service and nice ambience."}
{"text":"I am a sucker for seafood. Love this place for seafood. Very flavourful . can be a bit too salty at times. You are given a bib and gloves and just eat away. Great experience. Relatively fast service. Go early beat dinner rush hour or else you will have to wait"}
{"text":"Quite pricey. The food was great but I didn't like the flavor i chose."}
{"text":"They just never get to seem to have enough food for when you need it or want it.   Been here more than 5 times since it opened, and 4 out of 5 times, they run out of food items or forget something that we've ordered. Growing pains of a new store and a staff needing to settle in I suppose.   Most people try to compare it to The Boiling Crab in LA, which I've had more than a few times. Captain's Boil is a few notches below Boiling Crab but, that being said, I think CB has great potential to grow if they just nail the basics down, and consistently."}
{"text":"Food was good but the service was what killed it for my sister and I.  We went to Captain's yesterday evening and were seated for a while without menu's. The server finally comes and asks if we've been to Captain's Boil. My sister said yes and then the server asked what we wanted to order. How can we decide what we want without even looking at the menu??  We ordered the snow crab legs, mussels, clams, 6 oysters, and cajun fries. I also ordered a drink and it never came until I asked the server. The oysters were disappointing for the price point. Small and about $2.67/oyster. Besides the oyster,s the food was great. I enjoyed my non-spicy boil sauce.  Service really killed my first time experience at Captain's Boil. When crab legs are ordered, it's normally expected to come with crackers. I asked for a cracker and they were dirty as if someone just used it. Since the server wasn't very useful I just used it because it's not like I'm eating the shell or eating off of the cracker.  Next time I'll just go to LA Boil for a better experience. I shouldn't have even tipped 15%, service was very disappointing."}
{"text":"Really nice place, I do recommend!!! ***First of all: loved the way they encourage you to eat by hands, bibs and plastic gloves are given to us! We all know that sometimes some kind of food is okay to eat by hand, or even better, they are suppose to be eaten in this way. But when we are in a restaurant sometimes we don't feel so comfortable, but here you are totally encouraged to do so.  All the food was amazing, I have no words! Just need to recommend you to try the king crab, delicious!  Service is pretty good, people are kind and always smiling! Place is clean and comfortable!  Thank you The Capitain's Boil's crew!"}
{"text":"This place is not very allergy friendly. Most of the seafood is boiled in a bag and all of these bags are boiled in the same pot. Due to leaky bags and not changing the water frequently, they cannot ensure that food has not been cross-contaminated between the sauces or the seafood.    This would be a great place for seafood lovers that do not have any allergies or people that love spicy food, as the portions seemed generous and the prices reasonable. Unfortunately, the only menu item that I could safely order was the calamari (which was delicious, I will admit).   The atmosphere of the restaurant is fun, they give you bibs and gloves and encourage you to get messy.   The seafood served here is very fresh and arrives at your table quickly."}
{"text":"We were there for a late lunch on a weekday when the restaurant was not busy so service was fine and the food was mostly delicious.  We ordered the king crab in the Captain's Boil sauce and the chicken fingers with fries (it was a dollar or two more than just fries). The king crab was delicious smothered in the Captain's Boil sauce. The chicken fingers were nothing special - deep fried from frozen sort of thing. The Cajun fries were no good sadly and I love fries so this was very disappointing. The fries to start with aren't that great and then they overseasoned it with Cajun spice which made it inedible and it was a tad overcooked. *thumbs down*  Also, I wish they had stored the gloves in boxes (if you've been to Fishman Lobster Clubhouse, you will understand) instead of just on the table because they're so light, they fly away easily, and I wouldn't put it past them to pick them up and set them on the table again like they are \"clean\" gloves."}
{"text":"Came back here yesterday with a group of friends. Wow. What a difference one week makes in terms of the service and the food... my 5 star review from last week was given a little too hasty.  We were a group of 6, and our orders were split up into 3 couples.  OUR ORDERS: First order: 1 Dungeness Crab (CB Sauce Medium Spicy), 1 lb of clams (CB Sauce Fire Spicy), 1 lb of clams (CB Sauce Medium Spicy), 1 Cajun Fries, 2 cobs of corn Second order: 2 lbs of clams and 2 lbs of shrimp (All CB Sauce Fire Spicy) Third order: 2 lb of clams, 1 lb of shrimp, 1 lb of mussels (CB Sauce Not Spicy), 1 sausage, 2 cobs of corn  What ensued after was just a clusterf*ck that made us all question if the initial success of the restaurant had gone to their heads.  First order was fulfilled fine, except they forgot our 2 cobs of corn, which is not a big deal. The Dungeness Crab was not as meaty as last week, the meat inside was all shriveled like they had starved the poor crab for weeks.  Second order was totally wrong. They came with 2 lbs of clams with CB Sauce Medium Spicy, and they never wrote down the 2 lbs of shrimp even though they asked for a clarification when we ordered. So we sent the 2 lbs of clams back and told them we're looking for Fire Spicy and that the shrimps were never ordered. They came back with 2 lbs of clams on Medium Spicy AGAIN, with 4 cobs of corn in the bags even though the second order never had any. After three tries of having the server confirm and fix our orders, they finally came with the shrimp, which had another 4 cobs of corn added to the bag. On top of that, about 20% of the clams were closed. We asked our server what could be done about them, and he kept saying he would take care of it. After asking for the third time, he finally took it back into the kitchen and gave it back with the clams opened up.  Third order was even worse. They came with all the seafood on MEDIUM SPICY. We sent it back telling them it was for NOT SPICY, and they came back again with all of it on Medium Spicy. It took a couple of back and forth exchanges with them to finally get the order right.  Needless to say, we were very confused. They were very disorganized. Yeah, we got like 8 half cobs of corn free in the end, because they didn't end up charging us for it, but it did not make up for the amount of time that was spent chasing down our servers and continuously telling them they came with the wrong orders. I'm happy that at the very least, they tried to fix everything, but the amount of times that we had to deal with them to fix it was just too much. They should be more organized than that.  Overall, no qualms with the taste of the food. The idea is great and I am a huge fan of it. Service was just wtf, but I think I have shared enough on that front. Value is not as good as last time I went because the seafood just seems to be less meaty. Would I come back? Maybe in a few months. Hopefully they will be more consistent with their service and food by then."}
{"text":"Having been to other seafood boil type restaurants I kind of new what to expect.  What I didn't expect was to see such a stark contrast between this Captain's Boil and other boil types.  The experience was fantastic.  The decor here is absolutely amazing I couldn't help but look at certain styling cues and imagine how I could incorporate them in my household. The food came out quite quickly, and piping hot (a big requirement for my table and I).  The seafood was absolutely tasty, our favorite by far was the Cajun sauce on almost everything :)  Being a newly opened restaurant I was surprised by how good the service was.  We never felt rushed, the waitress was knowledgeable when it came to menu offerings and even gave us a how-to for the newbies at the table.  The experience was great, and for those who haven't been to a seafood restaurant like this were laughing and smiling while crushing crab shells over good eats.  We'll definitely be back here!"}
{"text":"I never experienced something g like this before I ordered the shrimp cajum medium spicy very unique Concept and the bag was impressive that they boil the slices in the bag definetly coming back again"}
{"text":"I have been to Boiling Crab in Los Angeles and because it was so bomb, I was hoping for Toronto to have something similar. When Captain Boil first opened a couple weeks ago, honestly I was pretty excited. Finally, something that can satisfy my seafood boil craving that I had for months.   Came down here on a Saturday night around 6:30 pm. Thinking the line wouldn't be bad but I was wrong. There were so many people already lining up outside, and names and phone numbers piling up on the book. The waitresses call you when its your turn to get a table. Since we came all the way down here determined to eat at this place, my friends and I decided to wait. Luckily, since finch/yonge area is pretty packed with cafes and other stores, it wasn't a problem finding a place to sit and chill and wait. We finally got a phone call at around 8:50 pm. Tip: Go later at night on weekends past 9 pm. The wait is not bad afterwards. Apparently, you can take out the food by ordering in the restaurant and waiting for them to prep for the food.. this is a good idea if you don't want to wait in line. I honestly don't know if I want to wait in line for two+ hours again...   When we sat down, they gave us bibs, paper towels and plastic gloves. One really good thing I really liked about Captain Boil more than Boiling Crab was the restaurant providing plastic gloves. Boiling Crab does not provide gloves so plastic gloves help your cleans stay clean majority of the time (until the glove pierces). The bib was cute and protected your tops.  Also, I really liked the washroom how everything was automatic (door, faucet, paper towels, soap) which means they really care about being sanitary.   The service is decent and we were served quickly, but the waiters/waitresses need to take more initiative to ask if everything is alright, etc. I saw that most of them like to just stand around in the back (our table was at the back) when they had nothing else to do.   We ordered: 2 lbs of shrimp (captain boil marinate), 2 lbs of mussels (cajun, captain boil marinate), 2 bowls of cajun fries, 2 corn on the cobs. This is where I compare the food to Boiling Crab. The captain boil marinate, personally, isn't very good. I prefer the sauce to just be cajun. However, their cajun mussels tastes way different compare to Boiling Crab (Boiling Crab was way better). The shrimp was decent but you can tell the shrimp wasn't marinated in the sauce long enough. The shrimp barely had any taste other than the head of the shrimp. You will need to dip the shrimp in the sauce after you finish peeling them. Furthermore, the fries: one batch had too little cajun and one batch had too much cajun. Too much cajun made the fries difficult to eat because of the stingy feeling on the tongue. I don't think I'll recommend the cajun fries unless the waiters can add less cajun dressing. Therefore, taste-wise I think the food here is just good but not spectacular.   The pricing on the shrimp, mussels, fries, and corn were also fair game. It wasn't super expensive but its just about what a seafood boil restaurant would charge. Also, we chose to not get the lobster, crab, etc.. because it was super expensive ( I don't think its worth it).    Overall, the experience was good but again, it did not satisfy my seafood boil craving because it just didn't taste the same as boiling crab. Boiling Crab tastes 10x better and I think I will have to jet down to the U.S. to eat it again. I don't think this place is worth lining up for two+ hours.   I'll probably come here once in a few months but not anytime soon given the long line ups. If Yelp didn't have a 5 star rating system, I would have given Captain Boil a 7/10 rating."}
{"text":"Truly good seafood ! We were riding around Calgary and stumbled up on this place and decided to give it a try . The staff was friendly and accommodating . The seafood was fresh and really tasty . Several flavors to choose from or you can get a mixture of all the flavors . Crab , lobster , crawfish , and shrimp ."}
{"text":"Captain's Boil never disappoints and I find this location better than my usual 230 Commerce valley. The staff is extremely courteous, food came out very fast and piping hot. They also had a 10% discount on food only when checking in o Yelp...so even if it's further up from me, I'll be returning to this location."}
{"text":"Four of us ended up here for one of our best friend's birthday dinner.   He was excited. The other two guys were excited. And yes I was excited too.   They were very quick to seat us. Overall I will say the service is very good. Attentive and expedient.   Now onto the food. You order your seafood and sauce. As well as some sides. I ordered the Cajun shrimp and the king crab in lemon pepper sauce with lotus root. They made sure my sauce selections had no dairy which was awesome.   Then the waiter asked me if I wanted the root in the same bag.  I said, \"pardon\"?  Same bag?  Apparently all of the seafood and veggies are boiled in bags. And that is how you get them served. So put on your plastic gloves and get used to it.   Also, the shrimp are peel and eat. I hate peel and eat.  Anyway, the seafood was cooked perfectly. The sauces were good.  We also split a fried rice and it was pretty tasty.   Overall, since the crab is market price, the total bill was likely about $90 including tax and tip. Expensive, yes. But the seafood really is amazing.  Especially the crab.   So if you want great seafood, can get past the plastic bags, and have a spare hundo, this is your joint!  Will I come back?  Yes. But likely sparingly.  Only because of the cost."}
{"text":"Awesome seafood and they serve them in a bag. Great experience. Love the clams the most, no need to open any shells, snow crab is awesome as well."}
{"text":"Great food at a fair price.  First time trying seafood prepared this way and I must say the flavors are delicious!  Came in just before noon and there were plenty of seats available.  Looked over the menu and decided on the teriyaki fried fish with rice.  They brought out a sizzling hot plate along with a mixed bag of shellfish seasoned with cajun spices and butter.  Overall a great dining experience and the food was great as well.  Will definitely come back to this location in the future."}
{"text":"My group of 7 had made reservations for a Friday night but wasn't seated until half an hour after the time we had. Seemed like the hostess was just standing there and not really helping out her team. Service was good however when we were seated. To start, we had the raw oysters (think it was half a dozen for $16). For mains, we had ordered the mussels, clams, lobster and shrimps with captain's boil sauce.... It was delicious!! For those that are too lazy, mussels and clams are the way to go. It was our consensus that the lobster wasn't worth. For those that can't handle spicy like myself, the \" no spicy \" option still has a kick, so beware!!! We also had the fried shrimp and fries which was a good deal in my opinion. I also loved the chickens wings and would definitely recommend. Overall, good experience for big groups despite long wait times! However, probably won't be visiting anytime soon because I was underwhelmed with all the hype around this place."}
{"text":"My rating might seem a bit harsh, given that they did a lot of things really well. But some of the transgressions were borderline offensive, which makes it hard to recommend this place to anybody.  First, the things they did really well: - Service was very friendly and attentive - Seafood was fresh and cooked perfectly - Concept is fun, and the atmosphere was very cool  These are good things, and the staff at Captain's Boil should be proud of them. What I cannot abide though, is the value you get for what you pay. That, and some of the stingy approaches to the menu items made me feel like I'd been robbed after eating there.  We ordered the shrimp and the king crab legs, and both were cooked perfectly. But the king crab was $35 for a SINGLE LEG. I don't care how well you cook it, that's ridiculous and misleading, given the pictures of multiple legs on the menu. Similarly, the menu shows a crawfish boil with corn and sausage. But they still don't have crawfish, and all the other items in that picture are extra. So we ordered corn for $1, and we got half of a corn on the cob. Seriously, that's so thrifty it's almost shameful.   In summary: - The quality of the food is great, but the prices are unreasonable given the small portions and the simplicity of what's being offered (seafood boiled in a bag with one of four sauces, and then \"plated\" in said bag).  - It's a novel concept, but it's also a cheap way of cooking, and the price should reflect that. Novelty is not enough to justify what's being charged for a single crab leg.   I get that the rent on Yonge Street isn't cheap and the grand opening discount helped make the price easier to swallow. Even after the discount though, you can get more food for less at Red Lobster, and they at least have the decency to offer free biscuits. In the future, I'm just going to go there instead, or better yet, buy the giant crab legs from Costco and just do it myself."}
{"text":"Service was great but food mediocre. The sauces were too oily and was separating in the bag. Plastic everything made it difficult to use. Not very environmentally friendly either."}
{"text":"Before the details, I will start with a disclaimer. Captain's Boil has many locations. Like any multi-location restaurants, my experience at the 5313 Yonge location should not be taken as a precedence for other locations. I arrived at Captain's Boil around 6:20pm on a summer Friday night evening. I was greeted and informed by the hostess that there's a small wait for a table for two. She took down my number and put me on wait list. The wait list is managed digitally and notifications were sent via text. I immediately received a text acknowledging my spot on the wait list. While I waited, I wandered off to Structube. And this is where I will digress a bit. Thinking that I have about 30 minutes to spare, my wait time was put to good use. Structube was having a decent sale. Within 10 minutes of walking around the store, I finally purchased the 3rd piece of furniture for my condo - a study desk. I thought I still had a lot of time to spare, so I took my 3rd stroll around the store, and that's when I got a text from Captain's Boil that my table is ready. I replied \"1\" to the text as instructed, indicating that I'm on my way back. At this point, I had 10 minutes to walk back. So I quickly grabbed a sales and cashed out. Oh I was hungry. I wanted to eat everything at this point. They sat me down at our table, and gave us a walk through on their menu. (OH please, as if I didn't study the menu ad Yelp reviews ahead of time. I'm no noob.) They told us that they are few pounds before they sell out of crawfish and that we should order quickly if we wanted crawfish. That's a smart sales tactic because it really made me panic. I am a die hard fan of  ????? / Sichuan Hot and Spicy Crawfish. (For those who aren't familiar with this Chinese cuisine, check it out here: http://kaleidoscope.cultural-china.com/.../8Kaleidoscope12562...). I already had my mind set on having crawfish before I set foot in the restaurant. Actually, I really much know exactly what I would like to order, including the sauce and spicy level, from studying their menu days before. Here's what we ordered: - Crawfish in Captain's Boil sauce with 2 orders of corn - Shrimp in Cajun sauce with an order of lotus root and an order of sausage Both medium spicy. At first, we were informed by our waitor that our food portion isn't enough for two people. I wanted to have a taste of the food first before I order more, if necessary. I refused to put on the bib and struggled a bit to get into the set of plastic gloves they provided (they stick to skin so I had to wiggle a bit.) Food came REALLY fast. Two plastic bags of steamy boiled seafood were dropped on our table within 5 minutes after we ordered. They must knew I was hungry and feared for the hangry monster that I was about turn evolve into. Shrimp came first. I dug my hand in the bag. GOD IT WAS HOT. I felt the burn through my plastic gloves. Okay, no pain no gain, and this BETTER be worth the burn. And it did. Everything in the bag was soaked in a generous amount of Cajun sauce. There's also a good amount of chopped garlic in the sauce, which enhanced the Cajun flavour. I found that the lotus root tasted the best in this bag as it absorbed all of the Cajun goodness. I discreetly ate most of the lotus root. The sausage and shrimps were also amazing. I couldn't stop eating from this bag and neglected the bag of Crawfish. As previously mentioned, I've had fond memories of Crawfish from another cuisine. Captain's Boil did not live up to my expectation. The Crawfish was much smaller than what I had in the past. Captain's Boil sauce is meant to be a mixture of 3 sauces (Cajun, Honey Garlic and Lemmon and Pepper). For whatever reason, I didn't take a liking in this combined flavour. And the sauce did not soak through the Crawfish shells so the tiny bitty piece of Crawfish meat was not flavoured. I had to dip it (and sometimes double dip... shhh) in the sauce. Even the corn didn't soak up any flavour. They tasted like regular steamed corn. As a result, we finished the Shrimp first and made slow progress with Crawfish. I had to stop eating because my ear started ringing in pain from the spiciness. My lips were trembling as I was eating but I couldn't stop.. The spiciness wasn't the type that hurts your tongue or makes you want to stop eating. I thoroughly appreciated the spiciness until I noticed the ringing pain in my ear. At this point, my lips were swollen and my earlobes were hot. I drank about 5-6 refills of cold water. We didn't end up ordering more as I was getting full. When the food came out, I actually thought that the portion was small and that we'd need to order more. (The table next us ordered 7 pounds of seafood for 2 people, whereas we only ordered 2 pounds plus sides). The grease filled me and the spiciness stopped me from ordering more. The bill was less than what I expected. About $25 a person. MMMMM Cajun sauce on Shrmp, Lotus Root and Sausage. I am craving you..."}
{"text":"If you're looking to get [respectively] down and dirty for dinner, this is the place to go! For my clean freak friends, don't worry, there are plastic gloves for your hands and a bib to protect your clothes. The original captain's boil sauce is my favourite and garlic second. In terms of the seafood, the crab legs are the tastiest. I would recommend ordering that out of everything. What I wouldn't suggest splurging on is the crawfish. If a shrimp and lobster had a baby it would be the crawfish. Unfortunately, the crawfish is mostly shell with the tiniest piece of meat that it's really not worth it. You'll end up just sucking the sauce from the shell more than anything.   The clams are good and I would get the garlic sauce to go with it. The servers are great."}
{"text":"I've been to the North York location last year and going in I knew I wasn't going to love it. The idea of hot food in a plastic bag just doesn't appeal to me. All I can think of is carcinogen! However, I saw that they had some teriyaki special for lunch at the Scarborough location so I decided to give it another try.  We got the chicken teriyaki, fish teriyaki, fried shrimp basket and lotus root. Both the fish and chicken teriyaki came with 3 mussels, 3 clams and 3 shrimps.  We got Cajun Cajun for the chicken teriyaki and it was too spicy for me. Otherwise, I prefer it over the fish because the chicken was so tender. I love the Captain's Boil sauce that came with the fish teriyaki. However, this dish didn't wow me. I think it's because of the way it was fried and the lack of sauce on it. For the price ($8.95 for the chicken and $10.95 for the fish), I thought you get a good amount of food. Although the sauce was needed in order to make everything taste good, it was overly salty.  The shrimp basket ($12.95) came with Cajun fries and 10 shrimps. It was average. I thought the fries tasted better than the shrimp.  I didn't know that the lotus roots came plain and that it cost extra to add sauce. What I did was put on the lotus roots in the teriyaki so that it can soak in some sauce which worked out well. This is an unique dish to order since you don't see it any many places (especially not at a seafood restaurant).  My conclusion of this place is that it's wasteful. They cover the table with paper, the lotus roots come in a bag, they gave us Styrofoam bowls, plastic utensil and cups to use. Everything was to be disposed of at the end of our meal. I know I'm not the most environmentally friendly person but even this is a bit too much for me. I don't see myself going to anymore of the Captain Boil's chains."}
{"text":"I went on a Saturday at 12pm. The food was amazing. The Captain's Boil sauce was to die for and was truly impressive. The quality of the seafood was fine. The staffs were attentive and were always asking if everything was okay. The atmosphere and the decorations were outstanding too. The only thing that gives it a minus is the really overpriced drinks. In conclusion, I would definitely come back again tho."}
{"text":"Great seafood. Make reservations otherwise you'd have to wait.  Very similar to Hot N Juicy in Vegas - been there a few times and craved it in Toronto. So good to see a very similar concept in TO. Tried the shrimp and crab in the captain's boil seasoning in medium - it was good!"}
{"text":"We ordered the cajun fried rice, shrimp with broccoli and ocra,  and cajun basket.  Everything was delicious,  I had no complaints.  The service was friendly and super quick!"}
{"text":"If you love seafood and spice...then this is the place for you!!! Get the Captain Boil sauce with double or triple fire.. amaazzzing!!! Totally recommend the lobster, shrimp, crab and calms, I wouldnt recommend the crawfish.. not much meat to it.  Definitely a favourite and a must try!!"}
{"text":"Absolute best seafood I've had in awhile! We came on a day where they had the fresh crab legs available and they were amazing and well worth the wait and price! The wait staff was very friendly and helpful when answering questions we had about the menu and overall we had a great time. If you're familiar with the Hot N Juicy chain in the states, this definitely outshines them! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Came for an early dinner  Tried the shrimp, mussels, crab All using the captains boil special sauce  Also added corn and potatoes  3lb of seafood was good for 2 people  It was really tasty while we were there and I enjoyed it  After we left though, I had a lot of tummy issues and my dining out partner also didn't feel  great  Not sure if it's the seasoning they use or added msg  I know they got a conditional health pass so maybe that's why (I think 1 infraction was not keeping food cold enough so that could definitely make someone sick)"}
{"text":"It was a lot of work to crack all the crab shells by hand for little meat. You'd have to be in to that kind of thing to enjoy it. Their cajun spice had this curry like flavour to it and didn't taste very cajun at all. If u want this hands on experience then this is great, but if you just want to eat seafood you're better off going to a Chinese restaurant and just ordering lobster. The crab was $40 for 1.5 pounds which wasn't much, and the lobster was $30 also about 1.5 pounds."}
{"text":"I am an avid customer of this particular location and I generally don't have any complaints. Most of the time, you get to choose where to sit. Your bibs and gloves are already laid out on the table and they immediately bring out water to you. The service is always on point (at least for all the times I've been here) and they tend to check up on the table every once in a while. They also upgraded their menus with a few more new items/combos (they have daily specials now too).   I always order the pound of shrimp and mussels in the captain's boil sauce with a side of steamed rice. If it's your first time, I definitely recommend trying anything with the special captain's boil sauce - it's literally just all the sauces mixed together but it's SO GOOD. I like getting the shrimp and mussels because they're both much meaty-er than let's say, crawfish (which I do not suggest to get at all because of the bare minimum meat). Speaking of, if you get the sizzling platter, which is also really good, it typically comes with crawfish, shrimp, mussels, clams, rice and your choice of fish or chicken HOWEVER, you can substitute the crawfish with more of the other seafood(s) included. The cajun fries and seafood fried rice are also really good... honestly, I'm just a big fan of Captain's Boil generally.   Overall, this is a good casual place for seafood and to get messy with family and friends. They cater to big groups and give free ice cream when it's your birthday AND their music is always bangin'."}
{"text":"We went for lunch with my parents when had come down to visit us. The price is reasonable for seafood restaurant (we stuck with shrimp, mussles and clams) and at 1pm there was no lineup. The decor was also not too bad. However, the food itself leave much to be desired. First off, there are only 4 flavours to choose from but considering one of the flavours is just the other 3 combined you realistically only have 3 flavours. Or 1 depending on how you look at it. From the other reviews, we ordered the combined flavour. We asked for non spicy for the mussle and mild for the others. The mild was way too spicy to be called mild and after the third bite we were all pretty much over the flavour. Not sure how it's possible but it was bland and over powering at the same time. The flavour over powered the delicacy /sweetness of the seafood, but other than spicy and greasy there was no distinct taste. Unfortunately, the sides (corn and potatoes) were also in the same bag with the same sauce so there was no getting away from it. Even the chilli fries had the same flavour.   In conclusion, I feel I could have made something much tastier at home and I wouldn't come back again. For that price I'm better served either to biermarket for their mussles and fries. The seafood I've made at home has been tastier and cheaper."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious of a gem in Etibicoke! I had the lobster taco and fish and chips and both were absolutely stunning! Would definitely come back and bring friends! Also they're staff were beyond kind like above and beyond. Next time I'm definitely going to try the bags of catch!"}
{"text":"Service was terrible. My brother had been standing in line for about 15 minutes BEFORE BEING SERVED. The fact that he had to complain about it was ridiculous. Even more absurd was that people coming in after him were being greeted while he was standing RIGHT IN FRONT of the staff in the waiting area. When my mother and I arrived that's when we finally got service.  Now as we're seated the same thing happens. People are being seated after us and those we people are able to put in their orders while we're sitting their waiting. We had to flag down a waitress to order our food. And what a mess that was. When our food finally came mine was missing. And when we asked about it, out waitress said she would check in it. That's when she literally disappeared off the face of the earth. Apparently it had gone to another table. But did our waitress tell us that? No. We found out from another waiter. And it was that guy who managed to turn around our night. He apologized for the problems we encountered and thank goodness he was our waiter for the rest of the night.   Onto the food...  It's actually quite good. I had the clams with the Captain's Boil seasoning in mild heat. I wasn't about to get the medium given the way our night started. Anyway, it was delicious and that sauce is so good it's down right evil. I wish I had bread to sop it up with. Or rice. Next time I'm doing that. We ordered ice cream for dessert and the salted caramel ice cream is delicious. Not to salty and not too sweet. The lemon sorbet was nice and tart and not creamy. I hate when you get a sorbet that's creamy. And the chocolate ice cream was the opposite: creamy but not too sweet. We shared among the three of us and it turned out to be an alright dinner.   I don't recommend this location. Is go back but I will be visiting one of their other locations."}
{"text":"This is our second time at this location. And again it was amazing. The restaurant was clean, service was awesome, the food was tasty and the entire experience was well worth it. Our server (Akeva) was very friendly and patient with our larger group. We'll definitely be back. Again."}
{"text":"3.5/5 but more towards 4.   Now coming from where I live we don't really have a place like this. So I was very excited to go to this place and devour all the seafood. So after readying some reviews about this place they were either very bad or very good so we were a little apprehensive about trying this place but I've been wanting to go so badly. The service there was amazing, the girl serving us was very attentive and since she knew we haven't been to the place or a place like that she made sure to help us out and that we were enjoying our food. We ordered the Cajun fried rice, crawfish, dungeon crab, and the Cajun fries and we ordered our seafood with the Captain's boil seasoning. Now the seafood itself was just decent, the fries and rice were good, the thing that was really good was the seasoning on the seafood. It was amazing. If it wasn't for that seasoning, it wouldn't have been that great. Now if you haven't tried a place like this then of course I do recommend it but if you have this place isn't anything different or special."}
{"text":"Oh baby, this place is wicked good.   I came here for a birthday and they easily accommodated or group of 12. They were efficient, fast, and very quick on their feet to our drinking needs.  Although my friends can be boisterous, they made it look like an easy task! Individual bills were correct and glasses and bellies full.   I ordered the clams medium Cajun spice, crab legs butter and garlic flavour, garlic bread, Cajun fries, pei oysters and BBQ wings. So much goodness. I woke up the next morning still tasting garlic. I loooooved it.   I think what I liked most about the dining experience is the lack of plates. I liked the barbaric feel to it all; eating with your hands, throwing the carcasses to the table top and washing it all down with some ale. Greasy fingers and all.   I would return any day of the week!"}
{"text":"Our new favorite place. Great seafood but horrible service during Sundays. We went during the weekdays and it is way better service."}
{"text":"Great service, great atmodphere, booths are very roomy and they had rnb jams i looovedd it!! staff real attentive and friendly, way better experience than downtown location. Will be back to try the lunch special."}
{"text":"I was so amped to try this place after trying Boiling Crab in LA. We ordered everything in Captain's Boil sauce, mild and it was amaaahhhhh-zing!!! The muscles in particular were large and flavourful, no sandiness at all. The clams on the other hand were quite fishy tasting so I would skip those. I didn't order crawfish based on others' reviews that there was barely any meat inside. The shrimp was also very scrumptious with juicy heads. I saw neighbouring tables order king crab - it looked absolutely divine but at $37/lb I didnt think to indulge this time. The corn is a must order - when every niblet of corn is covered in buttery goodness, you just melt. We used our muscle shells to scoop sauce and use as a sauce plate for everything else. When you first get the bag, turn it upside down and shake. I brought some wet wipes and that came in handy afterwards. They have a sink at the front of the restaurant and they provide each table wih a paper towel roll but it was hard not to dirty the roll every time someone reached for it.  The missing star is because either they are understaffed or they are really inefficient and I think it is the latter.. when we first arrived we were told 20-30 min wait.. no problem we went to walk around waiting for their call. We got the call about 25mins later and when we got there still had to wait another 5mins. There were 2 larger tables and 2-3 smaller tables open but either not cleaned or not set up. I saw 3 staff huddled around the counter looking at a bill or something. For a place that doesn't really need to service the customers much once they get their orders in, this is pretty bad. The other thing is near the end of our dinner we started smelling sewage backup coming from the downstairs washroom area. I had used the restrooms prior to the meal so there was no problem at first but afterwards we all agreed there was some foul odour and we couldn't wait to leave.. good thing we were already finished. We were seated next to the stairway to go downstairs where the washrooms were."}
{"text":"Nice place.. Value for money...Very tasty... Different experience... Worth a try... Best calamari ever..."}
{"text":"Found out about this restaurant via a friend. Got super excited to try it and was very glad I did. From other reviewers we already knew that there would be a wait, so the 6 of us went right when they opened, but still had to wait an hour for a table to be ready for us (we hung out at the timmies across the street to pass the time). The host will take your name down and call you once the table is ready (crazy busy for a Sunday night). The server was great at explaining the menu to us as it was our first time. She gave great recommendations on which sauces went with which type of seafood the best. She did tell us not to order the sizzling plate combo (said it wasn't worth it); recommended the cajun seafood fried rice and fried shrimp basket to share. During our visit we ordered the following, we got all the sauces mild: Cajun Fries Cajun Seafood Fried Rice Shrimp - Cajun Mussels - Lemon Pepper Clams with Sausage - Captain's Boil  Snow Crab - Garlic King Crab with Corn - Captain's Boil We had loads of fun putting on our bibs and gloves for the meal. When the food came, the server also took her time to explain to us how to open up the crab legs just in case we didn't know. Pop is 2.5 per can (so no refills). Loved the corn with the Captain's Boil sauce, and their cajun fries. The clams here were my absolute favourite seafood out of the items we ordered. Looking forward to April when crawfish comes in season! Overall, prepare your stomachs and wallets for this restaurant, but well worth the messy experience!"}
{"text":"Perhaps eating out of a plastic bag, rice in styrofoam cups with plastic spoons and peeling shrimps and leaving the shells on the table is novel for some, but it truly interfered with my enjoyment of the meal.   I ordered a pound of shrimp in the Captain's Boil sauce. It was delicious! But truly, I prefer not to see the face of my shrimp.   I'll definitely order from the Captain's Boil again, but it'll be take away!"}
{"text":"This place did a really good job with social media..  Can't say I would go back..  Good thing about this location is there isn't a line up.. If you're looking to go..  I must say the servers were very friendly!!  The seafood however is way below par..  We had lobster, dungeoness crab, mussels, clams, shrimps, crawfish, fried shrimp with fries, and Cajun seafood fried rice, lotus root, and corn.  The lobster wasn't fresh.. The meat was soft.. Same deal with the shrimps, also wasn't fresh..  The clams and mussels were re-ordered  Crawfish was very tasty!! But lots of work for little meat..  The crab, Cajun seafood fried rice, and fried shrimp was really good..  The bill was $55/person, the bulk of the bill went to shrimps and lobster which the quality was very disappointing..  Very messy eat with your hands type of restaurant which I like!!!!! Get lots of napkins ready before you start eating! The oil will seep through the plastics gloves!! The add a shit ton of butter into their sauces!!  Nothing special but worth a FB check in if you're into that..."}
{"text":"Love this place and probably one of the very few restaurant with this style.. flavors are great.. wish the prices not sooo steep and sometimes the music can get really loud"}
{"text":"The service was a hot mess. Probably messier than the aftermath of what was left from our lunch. During prime lunch time, they only had two staffs running the whole restaurant. We felt irritated by the poor service but guilty at the same time that they were so overwhelmed + short staffed!   Half of our foods never arrived - we saw the table seated next to us ordered the same items but seated after us received theirs, I knew ours were either forgotten or given to another table by accident. An hr into lunch and with no seafood left on our table, the sides were still nowhere in sight! We were fed up with the wait and cancelled the other half of the order.   As if the missing food items weren't enough to drive us away from ever coming back, hair was found in our bag of King crab legs. Bag was snatched out of our hand when I notified the staff. No apology was given. And the new order wasn't served for another half hour. My poor mother in law watched us eat for majority of the meal.   Lobster, King crab legs, shrimp - all taste fine but nothing to write home about. The captain boil's sauce (a blend of lemon pepper, Cajun, and garlic) was my personal fav. The chicken wings were outrageously small in terms of portion - I would advise to sticking to their seafood or other sides. Overall - It's a matter of time before a handful of knock offs open up - captain's boil needs to straighten up its act before competitors come on."}
{"text":"It was a great experience! On your table, they provide cute plastic bibs with gloves. Trust me you need them! I thought I could do without gloves but boy was I wrong. At the time, crawfish were not in season. So we had the clams, shrimp and mussels with the Captain Boil Seasoning + the Cajun Fries.  Once the food came in plastic bags, it did not remain long in there! It was great! I enjoyed the mussels the most then the shrimp. Looking back, I wished I skipped on the clams. They were not memorable.   And the fries reminded me of Costco fries, which I love. My other friends got the Lobster and King Crab and regretting nothing! They enjoyed their food.  I am glad Captain boil opened in the downtown core."}
{"text":"I've been waiting sooooo long to come and try one of these boil bars that's been all the rage lately and to be honest, my first experience was great.  We had ordered mussels with sausages, clams (which I think was the best), snow crab legs and cajun fries. The flavors we tried were - cajun, lemon pepper and Captains Boil (which is a mixture of cajun, lemon pepper and garlic sauce). The Captains Boil was the best one.  Whenever I tried seafood at restaurants - it was usually overcooked to the point that it's chewy like rubber and the meat would've shrunk to some tiny toy size. But here - that wasn't the case - just thinking about it makes me want to go back ... the mussels and clams were so plump, juicy and perfectly cooked. The crab legs didn't really have much flavor to the meat but that's rather obvious cause the seasoning was put on AFTER it was cooked so all of the flavoring was on the shell.  The cajun fries was.. underwhelming in comparison to the cajun fries at Five Guys. Usually my fiance fights with me for the left remaining cajun fries - but that didn't happen during our visit to Captains Boil.  The gloves provided sort of helped with keeping our fingers clean - but a lot of the oils seeped through it - maybe I should've double gloved (don't know why I didn't think of it earlier..) Service was friendly and fast. They answered every question we had and gave us a thorough explanation of how ordering worked.  Overall, great experience - I would come back again."}
{"text":"4.5/5.   I've heard about The Captain's Boil for a bit over a year. This place has franchised supppper fast around the GTA, and it finally arrived in my city! I noticed the place was renovating for a Captain's Boil opening, and anxiously awaited for its arrival. LO AND BEHOLD, on my way to BP in front of this plaza, I saw a flashing OPEN sign at The Captain's Boil and figured that since I was dining in anyway, I may as well try this place I've been putting off.   I entered the storefront, and there was no reception at stand. I wasn't even sure if I was hallucinating because I didn't see anyone inside when I was looking in from outside. However, once stepping in, a young gentleman named Kyle welcomed my sister and I to The Captain's Boil, and seeing how it was our first time there, he explained how the menu worked. My sister ultimately ended up buying the lunch specials, which are sizzling hot plates. I tried Fish in Captain's Boil flavour  - Mild, and she tried Chicken in Captain's Boil flavour - Medium. Both were listed as $10.95. I also ordered a side of Sweet Potato Fries for $5.95. My sister's dish arrived first, then my fish and fries came shortly after. We were the only table eating in, but hey, fast service so ;)  The fries were super crunchy and a good amount of sweet. I also think it was a fair portion for the price tag. I then put on my gloves and gave it a go at the seafood. I. LOVED. IT. The sauce/flavour started to feel heavy (fatty) near the end of my meal, but I guess that's part of the deal. I also tried my sister's chicken. I prefer the fish a lot better because it has a crunch to it. I should mention that crawfish was supposed to be included in the lunch special, but it's a seasonal item. Since we didn't get our crawfish, we got 3 of every other seafood item that came with the lunch special. I'm normally not a fan of oysters but the oysters here had an UMF to them. Deeeelicious.   Service was good. There was an older woman working who asked how our meal was, and Kyle offered water several times during our stay. At the end of our meal, we had to wait a couple minutes before we saw anyone that could serve us. Another table of 2 had entered in after us, so I guess everyone was prepping food for them.   Washrooms were spotless.  Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Seasoning was perfect! Every dish we ordered, from seafood to cajun rice tasted sooooooo goooooood! Please please add more locations! Lol peel region please??"}
{"text":"I would have given it 4 stars but its not because of the food. Service was inconsistent. I come here most of the time with family and sometimes friends. Some days they're fast and some days they're not. I understand that they probably have some staffing issues but this place is bigger than the ones in downtown Toronto and you'd think they'd hire more people. Like I said, it's not the food but I would probably go to Queensway location for better service."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! Compared to other locations, this one is very spacious which is great if you have kids or in a group of more than 6. I will definitely recommed going to this place specially during lunch time because of the combos that they offer."}
{"text":"Apologies for my last review. I have since learned that I have a sensitivity to king crab. My friend and I had a really fun meal here. (Seriously, if you put any kind of premium on a novel dining experience, come here.) I loved the mess of this place -- your food comes to your (plastic sheet topped) table boiled in a bag of seasoning liquid, they give you plastic gloves to eat with, as well as a plastic cup, plate, and utensils (just try not to make a mess; you can't do it!) -- though I did half-mind all the garbage we produced. Seasonings were fine, but a little one note. Fried rice was nothing to write home about. I would rate this place a 3.2."}
{"text":"3.5/5  *The restaurant was spacious and spotless! I liked how they had a big sink at the front with sensors so you wouldn't have to use the washroom and dirtied the handles.  *there were bibs, paper towels and plastic gloves on the table.  *service was average, not the most attentive.   *I would not come back to Captain's Boil on a regular basis as it's quite expensive.   -Lobster ($29.95) and Shrimp ($12.95) in Captain's Boil sauce:  The lobster was cut lengthwise, and both the shrimp and lobster were cooked perfectly. While I understand the concept of the restaurant was to use your hands, but at some point it was extremely difficult to eat the lobster without lobster crackers. Half way through eating we also realized that there was no where to put the trash/empty shells.   While the Captain's Boil sauce was supposed to be the combination of all three sauces, the garlic was overwhelming. I love garlic but this was way too much and the sauce was under-seasoned for our taste. I also thought the shrimps had much more sauce and flavor compared to the lobster, perhaps the shrimp was smaller hence the sauce was able to penetrate easier?  Half-way through I decided to order the Cajun Fries. I thought the fries were quite crispy and fluffy on the inside, but it felt very.. powdery? They could have better distributed the cajun seasoning by tossing the fries as it seemed they were just sprinkled on top."}
{"text":"First timer... wouldn't say I would frequent much as it gets messy. We tried pretty much every seafood menu item offered. Don't get the shrimp appetizer just frozen shrimp. Large portion but not fresh seafood. Loved the whole crab I would go back and order a bunch of these.  Mussels not that great they are the green muscles so they are most likely frozen. I would never order this again.  Fresh shrimps not that great either, mushy  Dungeness Crab and clams I would recommend.  I wonder if they cook all the food in the plastic bags? Not very safe if they do. Boiling food in plastic bags... hmmmmm...  Not much on service as they just drop bags off at ur table and don't really check on you.  If your looking for an experience eat here you'll get messy and you will always remember eating here. It's like when your deciding on a family outing...  take them here.  Not an environmentally friendly restaurant.  Everything they use in there goes straight to the trash, cups only plastic not even glass cups for a beer lol  Plastic cutlery if u ask and plastic bags upon plastic bags.  Maybe there is a better way this company can help the environment I wonder if they even recycle all that plastic."}
{"text":"Captain's Boil is my go-to place when I'm craving seafood. I usually go to the one on Queen, but my boyfriend and I decided to go to the one on Yonge and college for it's convenient location after Christmas shopping.  Going in, we didn't feel too welcomed. Some workers weren't that enthusiastic. They let us pick a table and then we called them over when we were ready to order.   We got 2lbs of crab legs in captain's boil flavour in medium heat, and a fried shrimp basket. That's our usual order.  The food? Pretty damn good as usual. We got a lot of meat in our crab legs. The flavour was amazing. The fried shrimp basket was subpar, but we usually get it for the fries that come with it, which is better than Popeye's fries in my opinion.  Service was OK. They listened to us and gave what we wanted, but their attitude was pretty downcast. Looked like they didn't want to be there today, kinda bummed us out too. That's why I'm gonna take off a star."}
{"text":"Lobster was great. Flavourful. I suspect that there is MSG in the Captain's Boil mix. Customer service sucks! They should offer lobster crackers to make breaking the lobster shell easier."}
{"text":"Always a great experience - both with the food and the staff - at this Captain's Boil location!  I've been here too many times to count, but on my most recent visit the waitress was so pleasant it prompted me to write this review. I can't remember her name, but the service she provided was A++++. This location always seem to be short staffed, but despite the chaos our server  consistently took the time to check on us to make sure we had enough water, and that the food was up to our expectations.   The Captain's Boil sauce (a mix of all three sauces) is my go-to. It's deliciously spicy and VERY flavourful. I love the shrimp, but I find it hard to peel sometimes, so I order the mussels a lot more. The sauce + some rice is very, very satisfying! The only small complaint I have is the $2 for extra sauce (when there wasn't much to start with!) While most of the time the sauce to seafood ratio is perfect, there have been a few times where my seafood barely has any sauce on it, and when I asked for extra I was charged the $2. Not the biggest deal, but I get confused when my friend's bag is saturated with sauce while mine is barely enough to coat half of my shrimp.  Gloves and bibs are provided for an exciting hands-on eating experience. It's a mess, but there are plenty of paper towels and a hand-washing station for you to use. Overall a very fun dining experience - and the price is reasonable for seafood!"}
{"text":"It is a fun and different experice, would recommend it to anyone to try it out. The evironment if the restaurant is okay-ish, not as high end and nice as other places in the area. The food was delicious, although a bit salty. It was expected since the seafood was marinated with different spices/sauces. Parking is a hassal in the area like usual. 1 serving of the seafood that you ordered might not be enough for a meal, i had to order something else on the side to be filling"}
{"text":"Earlier this month I met a friend for lunch at the recently opened Queen W. & McCaul location. I ordered fish (halibut) & chips; the fish was quite good but the chips were the real standout: spicy and fairly thick - though not like wedge fries. The venue's décor was quite nice and unique, and they even have a hand-washing station. My friend generously shared mussels and a couple of shrimp from her order with me; the former was quite unique in texture and flavour and the latter bigger and tastier than the shrimp I usually have - and I generally don't have shrimp very often.  My meal was large enough to feed me for lunch and dinner (leftovers at home).  Our server was quite friendly and helpful when my friend repeatedly asked questions re. the menu choices and the food itself.  As the venue's close to home for me I'd like to go back and order 2 or 3 choices from their somewhat extensive side dish menu to try making a meal that way."}
{"text":"Don the plastic gloves and bib and you're ready to eat cave man style. The menu is simple you order what fish you want to eat, then you decide on four flavours ...mild, medium, Cajun and Captain's s boil. Next you pick your side which is cooked in the same bag as your fish. There are other sides like sweet potato fries and garlic bread and Cajun rice with shrimp. Sleeves rolled up its time to dig into the piping hot bag of mussels, shrimp, clams,  crab or lobster. Everyone shares,  it is a feast and a lot of fun. Looking for casual dining and good food I would try the Captain's Boil. My only disappointment they did not offer coffee or tea. We had brought a birthday cake but was disappointed we couldn't have a coffee to go with our cake. Oh and staff were nice  too."}
{"text":"I've been here many times, and there's a few reasons for this:  delicious food, great atmosphere, great location, and friendly staff.    The king crab legs are my favourite.  Toss in a side of corn or premium sausage for a great combination.  I'd recommend getting the captain's boil sauce and medium spice for the crab legs.  That's the best combo i've tried it in.    The experience is one of a kind in Toronto! to that, i am sure there will be many copy cats popping up soon but always remember this place started it in Toronto.  The messiness is a good test for a first date.  IMO, If the girl/guy is uptight with getting a little messy, maybe it's time to reconsider a 2nd date. haha.    Jokes aside, CB offers a fun dining experience with amazing seafood.  Definitely a must try it!! I've seen the rare negative posts on Yelp and been looking through those people's profiles - some people you just can't satisfy, no matter what.  Please don't come to a place that serves high quality seafood and expect food court prices."}
{"text":"It was my friends and I first time at Captain's Boil. As we arrived, bibs and gloves were on the table. I'd recommend asking for an extra pair or two of the gloves because they can tear in the midst of eating.  Reservation can only be made with a party of 8 or more. Gratuity of 15% is automatically applied if you're a party of 6 or more. We were a party of 6, gratuity was not automatically applied lol (Great!).  They ran out of crawfish, dungeness crab, and snow crab -  not pleased.  Party of 6, we ordered: Lobster (wasn't worth the $30), Shrimps, Clams, Chicken Teriyaki with Rice, Cajun Seafood Fried Rice, and Cajun Fries. My boyfriend and I ordered 2lbs of shrimps with the Captain's Boil sauce and cajun fries. Def recommend everything minus the lobster!  The service could've been better- The lobster claw wasn't properly cracked or cracked at all. lol  I'll be back with my family :)"}
{"text":"Service is amazing, food is good, my mom and I ate till we were full for $23.  We ordered 1 lb shrimp with Cajun medium spicy and the chicken sizzling plate with garlic. The chicken sizzling plate was on special for $9 which was an amazing deal because it comes with seafood too. Sauces taste really good but seafood quality was not as high compared to California's Boiling Crab. Regardless, will definitely be back and try other locations."}
{"text":"We went to this Captain's Boil for lunch. This is a new location on the York Mills strip. It was nicely decorated and not very crowded. The service was brisk and efficient.  I ordered the king crab legs and cajun seafood fried rice. My friend ordered the beef lunch special and the 1 dollar special. The crab legs was very good and seafood fried rice was delicious. My friend also enjoyed her food.  Would we go back? Sure, since the food was very good."}
{"text":"Love this place. I'd eat here once a week if I could; not even lying. Nice to bring a couple people and share."}
{"text":"Pretty good seafood, though a couple of my shrimps tasted on the verge of becoming spoiled. With tax and tips and a 10% grand opening discount, our meal was $28 per person. It was a fun experience to eat with  fingers and get messy with the food. Good Cajun fried rice and fries too. Not many vegetable options though. Will come back again."}
{"text":"It was my first time eating here and I was pretty excited! We came here for dinner on a weekday and it was surprisingly quite busy. We wanted to try the lobster roll and got the bisque combo for just an extra $2. The roll was pretty good but the bisque was too sweet for my liking. Next we had the 1/2 lb wings which my partner really liked (much to his surprise). We dipped them in the Captain's Boil sauce that we got with our clams, and it was so tasty! I also love the station they have in the center of the restaurant for washing hands!"}
{"text":"This spot is a unique dining experience in the GTA. Clean, friendly and full of delicious, fresh seafood, you will not be disappointed.  A great pick for the whole family or as a fun experience for friends or your adventuresome date. You will find lots to eat, drink and enjoy.  There are both seafood and non-seafood options, as you please.   Indeed, this is literally a hands-on dining experience. But, fear not. You are provided with bibs and gloves to keep things clean. If you're looking for something else, the menu has you covered.   I enjoyed various sharables. Crab cakes, calimari and mussels were all top notch. For my main course, I tucked into a fresh bag of clams and delicious corn.  The clams were tender, meaty and sweet. The corn was much the same. A great combo.  Excellent experience all around."}
{"text":"Ordered the fish teriyaki lunch. Pretty good assortment of seafood (2 clams, 2 mussels, 2 crayfish, fried fish, 2 shrimps) and rice. Although it's called teriyaki fish lunch, it doesn't actually have teriyaki sauce. You can choose which sauce and spicy-ness level. Their signature Captains boil sauce is very flavourful (tastes like garlic-Cajun sauce). Medium spicy has a pretty good kick to it. All for $12 + tax. Definitely worth it.   Lunchtime wasn't very busy so it wasn't hard finding a table."}
{"text":"Hi went to The Captain's Boil tonight with some friends. It was our first time and a great experience. Nothing really like it elsewhere. I would like to say that the food was amazing, however it was just okay. The sauce was very runny and way to much butter. Our server Thomas was amazing. He was on top of everything and catered to our every need. I would come back for the service alone.  If you haven't been before, you should try it at least once."}
{"text":"Came by here after passing by Red Lobster but i was told it was going to be a 30 minute wait so i was like eff that my stomach cant wait 30 mins i am outta here.  As i was getting into my car in the parking lot i saw a shimmering light a far from me.  It was a Captains Boil strategically located close to a red lobster. I was like alright i wanted lobster lets get lobster here, Red Lobster's lost. The place is big and brand new with 4 big tvs with sports on.  It's Cajun cooked seafood and deep fried food as well.  Order mussels cooked in the all famous Captains boil sauce and mild hot sauce.  It was very tasty and messy because all the food is given to you in a clear plastic bag.  I've also ordered lobster in lemon peppersauce in mild hot sauce.  It was a 1.5lb lobster at a $40 price point.2  I also ordered chicken wings and cajun fench fries.  The lobster was okay id imagine if youre ordered a lobster you would get some sides or buns for appetizers but no just lobster.  Chicken wings you get 6 wings and the french fries just tasted  like french fries nothing cajun about it.   The service was fast and courtesy.  Ill probably try out other boil seafood restaurants and compare them with this location.  In the mean time ill probably go back after i taste tested other competitors.  1 thing is for sure there cajun taste hell of a lot better than Popeyes cajun spices.  The captain boils special sauce is nice but honestly i can probably buy 2 Lobster and boil it at home.  In the end for those 3 items order it cost me $75 between two ppl.  I felt like i could have some awesome meal if i were to spend that kind of dough at the Keg.  Anyways on to the next scene. Stay classy Etobicoke!!!!! Capt. B Gets 3.5 out of 5"}
{"text":"Came here for late night seafood. To try out if this location is better than the other. Service and food is definitely way better here. The seafood is fresh and hot. The shrimps were juicy compared to the other location.   There are lots of people that go to this location. Therefore you should make reservations to avoid the wait."}
{"text":"The design of the place looks great.  The interior of the store theme matches the type of food their selling.  But the music they play doesn't really match   When we first entered the restaurant there was no hostess to greet us. We just stood at the door for a few minutes until someone finally came to seat us. They were not as busy as the other location. There was no wait and a few empty tables.   The seafood came really fast which surprised us since it only took about a minute for the server to bring the food.   The shrimps here were not fresh. When we got them they were warm and dry and lacked sauce. At the other location the shrimps would come out fresh and steaming hot. It was very disappointing   Service was not that great. When we asked if we could get more sauce, the waiter just charged us for mini containers of both the flavours of sauce we had without informing us that there are additional charges. The extra sauce container was really small and not worth it comparing to other seafood boil places.   Overall experience at this location isn't too good. But the other locations are great."}
{"text":"I definitely recommend the shrimp with the captain's boil sauce. I had a pound and it was enough for me. My boyfriend doesn't eat seafood so he had the chicken fingers and our dinner was fairly affordable compared to what other reviewers have been saying. We came around 5 and there were plenty of tables,  although they seem to make you wait even if there is availability. Also, no one warned me that you need as bestos hands to eat the shrimp; it was HOT! Cajun fries were so yummy but really spicy."}
{"text":"A great and welcome addition to an area that desperately needs more options.   Captain's Boil is a chain, so don't expect top quality here, but for what it is, it provides a simple and fun atmosphere to have lots of fun eating seafood. Great for groups and for family, and very good friendly service."}
{"text":"Excellent service, delicious food! It was our first time and the waiter was very knowledgeable and helpful. The lobster and snowcrab legs were delicious and the sausage mixed in was amazing!  We got the Captains Boil mix for the seasoning and it was awesome.  We'll definitely come again!"}
{"text":"The place is very crowd, king crab leg is flavourless The only okay thing is the corn You have to ask them for a cracker!"}
{"text":"Such a neat idea! I had a pound each of muscles and clams in the special sauce. The sauce was good but very heavy. I would probably try the garlic butter next time so it doesn't drown the flavour of the shellfish. It's a fun place to go and get dirty. Do not dress up (even though they give you gloves and a bib you still get saucy). They also have a washing station in the middle of the restaurant which was clever. Apart from the shellfish there isn't very much variety so for those guests that aren't huge seafood eaters, they're restricted to chicken fingers and fries or sausage. Do not get the boiled chicken.. that was a disaster. Also, not sure how I feel about actually boiling plastic bags..."}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday with my family and it was great :) Service was very attentive. I would recommend the Captain's Boil sauce (there's a reason why it's the most popular). I was also pleasantly surprised that the mild option for spiciness level actually did contain some spice LOL. We had ice cream for dessert and it was really good -- you get three scoops!"}
{"text":"Today I went to Captain's Boil straight after work in business casual attire, you can imagine how that turned out. (see picture)  Not being a huge fan of sea food normally today was an exception. To be frank I was dragged into the restaurant not by choice. What makes this restaurant stand out clearly is the mess that the food comes in and the aftermath. The experience is quite unique but my favourite aspect of the meal was the Captains boil sauce - a combination of Cajun, lemon pepper, garlic sauce and a hit of whatever spicy sauce you prefer. WOW.. it's something you have to experience for yourself.  I would not reccomend getting the crab or lobster from a value perspective, our table of three shared the 1lb of mussels, shrimp and Clams. DON'T forget to add corn and sausages addon feature, the corn was very sweet and mixed with the captains boil sauce made it amazing.  Will try it again, maybe try the lobster but it was $36.95 per 1.5LB..."}
{"text":"Such a disappointing lunch. We anticipated so much more after having had a really delicious and fun dinner here in April. We ordered the lobster roll and bisque combo, some wings and the fish and chips. The wings were \"off\" and we sent them back. We are grateful they took them off the bill. The lobster bisque was watery at best, although there was some slight hint of flavour. The fish appeared to be previously frozen which is a real drag, since this is an exclusively seafood restaurant. The lobster rolls were so tiny, that I honestly didn't see mine buried in the fries. It was prepared with a strip of bacon and some lettuce on a very dry bun...maybe my aim was too high, having been to Boston where they claim it's a lobster roll and it actually is... The fries were good, which was a saving grace. We were also quite concerned by the use of plastic cutlery, plastic cups and foam plates. Are these environmentally friendly???? None of us will return after this experience."}
{"text":"Overrated and not really worth what you are paying.  Got the crab, king crab leg, clams, lobster, crawfish and cajun fries.  The Captain's Boil sauce is really good, it would honestly go well with anything.  Crawfish was too small to have any substance to them.  Cajun fries were good, same ones you can get at Costco.  They tell you the price per pound, but when the bill came for our two separate tables everything looked like a fix price.  Did the two crabs weigh exactly the same?  Did every item coincidentally end in $XX.95?  Not a very straight forward pricing structure.  Service was great as our server described everything in detail.  After this meal though we had to go get some Korean food in the area."}
{"text":"Such a fun and different way of eating your food! Your given a bib and gloves to eat your meal, which is served inside a bag with the sauce of your choice. If anyone's ever been to The Boiling Crab in Los Angeles it's pretty comparable. If you like spicy I would recommend the 'fire' heat choice. I got medium heat and it definitely had a kick to it but not as much as I would have liked."}
{"text":"Delicious.  I'm a bit bias because this was the first seafood boil restaurant in have been too but nonetheless the food is tasty and the exprience was fun.  We tried the lobster, shrimp, & mussels in the Captain's Boil sauce (the trifecta) and cajun in non spicy, and mild.  I love spice but ate with someone who does not, and mild has a kick to it so people who do not like a picture food I would suggest no spice.  The atmosphere is fun (2nd tip: wear the bib!), the service is quick and friendly and there was no line up.  BUT I did not like the lower floor set up, they have a waiters station where they keep the water for customers right next to the washroom- I'm sure I'm the only one with this issue though."}
{"text":"Came to this location twice and the experiences were polarizing. The first time was amazing - we were a group of 3, the waitress was friendly and helpful, the clams, mussels, and shrimp cooked with the Captain Boil sauce had amazing flavours and a good kick, and even the fries were hot and crunchy! Of course, the fact that we were eating food from a bag with our hands was also quite a novelty!   In fact, we liked it so much we brought our friends back for a second time less than 2 weeks later! Unfortunately, the experience was nothing like the first - we were a group of 8 this time, it took almost 30 minutes to flag down the waitress (not the same one) to place our orders and she seemed like she didn't even want to be there, they served our cola drinks warm and when we asked for ice, she looked at us as if we were being ridiculous. It took another 30 minutes just to ask for the bill and the place wasn't even busy! We left extremely disappointed and not even full - just got tired of waiting.  The food is good overall but probably won't visit this location for a third time due to the poor service - they don't seem to be friendly towards big groups."}
{"text":"Walked by this place once a week and was wondering about the new trendy boil restaurant. Tried it on a random Wed night, walked in with no reservation, sat immediately (for 2) at 5:30 pm. We got a booth and the seats already have the plastic bibs and plastic gloves for the big mess you are about to face.   FYI, you can only order by the pound-- lobster and king crab at Market prices. We ordered 1 pound of lobster with the Captain's boil sauce (mild hotness), 1 pound of crawfish with mild Captain's boil sauce, 6 oysters (already shucked) and Cajun Fries. The pace at which the food came out was good, not all at once and immediately came in plastic bags all hot and greasy. The service also was good--waitresses easy to flag down for more water or plastic gloves.   The lobster was overcooked but the sauce was very good. Garlicy, spicy, a little kick, acidic. I would probably get the lobster with just butter and lemon the next time. The crawfish with the sauce was delicious! Way too spicy though. The crawfish were a bit small, but you can still do what you want to do with the crawfish--suck the flavour with the heads! We couldn't finish the entire bag so we took 1/2 the pound left over home. The oysters were huge, I forget what kind they were but from Washington. Very meaty and bitter. I don't know why they gave limes, lemons are usually the best with oysters but with the lime and cocktail sauce, yums. Finally, I was expecting just cayenne peper with the fries but the fries were very crispy and done to order, but way too spicy. With the crawfish spice and Cajun fries, my mouth was burning! I was tempted to ask for milk!  All in all, good service, good food. You would probably need a reservation later in the evening but I'd come back. I'd order the lobster with just butter and lemon but would like to try the other stuff. I also saw there was some special during the day, so I will probably try that. Recommended."}
{"text":"This restaurant is packed all the time but for good reason. The seafood is tasty and it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Flavor is amazing. Food is really good. Something different, it's an experience but, the food is not worth going eat, the food is decent."}
{"text":"They had run out of crawfish. Huge disappointment. However, quickly forgotten after submerging into a bag of 1lb lobster. Their Cajun mild sauce is fantastic, as are the Cajun fries and corn on the cob."}
{"text":"Aiyay Captain!   We ordered mussels and shrimp both on captain boil, medium and mild. Extra add ons for corn and sausage special. Got the fried rice too.   Our shrimp was great! Fresh and just so good with the sauce! The sausage was fantastic too so make sure to get that add on.   The mussels would probably be frozen they are new zealand one. The one u get in mandarin. It was that bad with the sauce too but i prefer the shrimp.  The fried rice is spicy with bay scallops and shrimp chopped up. Its good for 3 people and damn it tasted like butter a bit too much butter. But still decent.   All in all it was great. Steven our server was cool and attentive. Goodjob guys!"}
{"text":"So this would be the newest trend happening right now in Toronto. In my personal opinion, I'm not a fan. Now this is just me, the service was great, the spices used were nice. However, the \"freshly frozen\" seafood didn't match up in quality with other seafood I have eaten. Plus I don't like eating with gloves on, so the whole idea throws me right off. In total probably 3/5 stars.  Would I go back again? Perhaps, but I wouldn't wait an hour for it. Let's be real, when I get \"hangry\" I prefer to eat right away."}
{"text":"I am not going to lie I am not 100% a fan of this type of food. HOWEVER I always get amazing service when I pick up food. I have no idea what her name is but she always has positive attitude and is so welcoming.   I come back because the food is always consistently good and the service. It is always hard to find good service at restaurants. So I appreciate it, Thank you"}
{"text":"Highly recommended for all seafood lover!! Went with my friends and it was a great experience,We love the seafood and it was flavorful. We order shrimps, clams and lobster with the captain's boil sauce and we really enjoy the captain's boil sauce!! Amazing!!"}
{"text":"Not worth the money. Too expensive. Doesn't make up for it in flavour. Go to The Lobster Trap. It's way tastier and way way better!"}
{"text":"I love garlic! Smelled it when i entered. Ordered medium spice garlic mussels that were delicious. Spice was there but not uncomfortable or overwhelming.  If i have a single critique it is ordered items come out separately. My wife's meal came 10 minutes after mine making dining together not possible.  Will return."}
{"text":"Awesome pace to dine, Customer Service was awesome and the food came out in a reasonable time."}
{"text":"I was not impressed at all. I ordered the crawfish and my wife ordered the snow crab. Both tasted terrible, no real flavor to speak of and It was almost like the seafood was on the verge of going bad. The only redeeming feature of the meal was that the beer was cold.    The staff never stopped by to see how our meal was like they knew it was going to be a bad response. We ended up paying way too much for a meal that was not worthy of being served...should have just brought it in a garbage bag since that is what it was.  Save your money and go to Red Lobster instead!!!"}
{"text":"Let me tell you 45 minutes waiting for the food is totally worth it.  I got their crawfish with the captain boils sauce on mild, it was DELICIOUS. They served you in a plastic bag, which does feel like you're eating at a fish market. Its a fun idea, but when you look around and seeing plastic bags everywhere, kinda puts me off... When you asked for a bowl, they gave a plastic foam bowl and take out spoon. It really makes me upset, like its great for business, no needed to hire people to do the dishes. It hurts to see a place that is not so eco friendly.  Food is amazing, but hope they could change to an eco friendly place.   Service was alright, we have to asked 3 different waiters for gloves. And the the guy that served us sounds dead inside. But good food, satisfy this foodie here."}
{"text":"I honestly love this place.  It's a completely different experience....GIVE IT A CHANCE.  I always hear all these people complain that there aren't knives or forks, get over it.  The food is wonderful!!  I have to give a special mention to Charleine, she is an amazing server, super friendly and really good fun and so sweet!  No bias that I'm also a Charlene.  Listen.... one note, maybe go one less spice than you think you can handle if you're getting captain boil cause it's spicy! I got the garlic medium it was spicy but the captain boil mild was spicier!  Unfortunately my parents got the medium captain boil and had to pack most of it home cause it was too HOT!   The Cajun rice was amazing! Definitely will always order from now on :) Cajun fries are also good like the Costco ones but with a kick.    Give it a shot you'll love it as long as you keep an open mind.  If you're stuck up and expect a napkin on your lap, fork and knife, forget it!"}
{"text":"Was a fun experience as well as delicious!  Loved the bibs and gloves.  If you love seafood,  it's a fun way to enjoy.  The size of the shrimps and crawfish was decent.  I felt worth the experience."}
{"text":"Great place. Good music.  Even better food. Love the house sauce. The captain boil sauce. Won't make a mistake choosing that. Their fries are amazing. Served hot and crispy with a bit of salt making you want to order more. A huge surprise were their wings! For a seafood place their wings are amazing. I would say it's better than a lot of wing places. I wouldn't mind just eating wings from there. It's that good!!"}
{"text":"Got the lunch special - sizzling plate combo with fish ($11). It includes two crawfish, shrimp and etc.  The portion size is unexpectedly bigger than I thought I'd be.  The rice was flavourful and buttery but really oily. I enjoyed the fried fish but it was really salty to my liking. I had to take off the fried batter cause it was that...salty. The crawfish, mussels, clams and shrimp were super salty too. I ate everything with my rice and still have a lot of fish left after finishing my rice.   I've never consumed this much sodium in my life. I felt very thirsty after lunch.  Service was below average. The waiter never came to check up on us nor refilled our water. We had to get the waiters attention for everything.   Overall, the food wasn't that bad other than it being really salty. I would probably go back to try their seafood."}
{"text":"Best example of how restaurants loose their character and quality when they focus more on opening up new branches. Captain boil used to be the epitome of spicy-boils in Toronto. Taste and quality were undeniable. But my recent visits proved it they have forgone both. I take blame on not giving them 5-stars when they were worth for. So here is my average - 3-stars - 5 for the first visit, 4 for the second, and 1 stars on my last two.   Adios Captain Boil !! It was good knowing u."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time for dinner. We were seated with menus by the host. Right off the bat our server asked what we would like to order without considering if we have been here or not. I found that she was assuming we knew what we wanted without giving us the time to look over the menu or asking if we have any questions. Our server was very friendly and she meant well, though we knew english wasn't her first language so it was very difficult to understand her.   Overall the seafood was fresh. All items on the menu had a lot of flavour and was cooked to perfection. Maybe next time our server will receive better training so that others can have a better first greet experience."}
{"text":"I love this place!! So delicious and friendly service, I love the okra and house spice on everything!!! Love the crab, shrimp !! Everything just good delicious fresh food!! It's our go to place!"}
{"text":"Alright so do you love seafood? Well this place is definitely it. Basically you choose a lb or 2 or more f whatever seafood you'd like along with the sauce and the spice level (along with any sides). It's that simple. You have this cute bibs along with plastic gloves to eat your food. Fair warning is that when you order items that you need to break apart (like lobster) your hands will still get oily even with gloves.   Although I was with a group of 11, 3 of us decide to share the food and costs. We ordered the lobster, 1lb of clams, 1lb mussels, 1lb shrimp, and Cajun fries. Regarding spice level we chose medium and our sauce was the Captain sauce. Fair warning again the media is really spicy. Going for the hottest sauce is probably for bragging rights but I doubt you'd enjoy the taste of the food as it would be hidden in the heat. That much was filling for us 3 and we only paid 32$ each tax and tip incl."}
{"text":"Fun place for seafood with a group of friends or family. If you are trying to keep it classy for a date, this is not the place to go. They provide bibs and gloves, but the sauce will leak through the gloves and there is no way to eat this gracefully, but that's half the fun! It's a bit pricy, so it's more economical to go with a bigger group of friends and share. I have tried the most of the meats and they are all pretty good. When choosing your flavour I recommend getting the Captain's Boil. Also get regular fries and dip it into the meat sauce and it's a very nice touch!"}
{"text":"Went here to celebrate my wife's birthday. Had the lobster, clams, mussels. Chicken teriyaki was too sweet I think it was the sauce, but the rest was delicious. It was a quiet on a Friday night but I guess it was freezing outside so the people decided someplace warm. Overall the food was good."}
{"text":"This was my first time going to a seafood restaurant and Captain's Boil did not disappoint. The menu is straightforward and simple and the novelty of wearing gloves, a bib and eating your meal out of a bag is hilarious. The food was great and came out surprisingly fast. The servers were friendly and very attentive throughout the night. Overall it was a great experience and I would highly recommend it for any seafood lovers."}
{"text":"Excellent service & food. Expected the portions to be smaller because I used a Groupon, but they honored the voucher exactly. It did get very messy, and there was a lot of garbage in the end - but we knew what we signed up for. Only annoyance was the display of beers by the bar that we figured they had available for sale, only to find out it was simply for \"decoration.\"   Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Delayed review but here it goes ... Now our go to place for our seafood fix, or shrimps . Growing up in an island and ending up in Toronto, it is very H.A.R.D to find quality seafood.  Believe me I've looked. Other than a rather expensive place for my lobster fix this is the next best thing and even better is that my hubby and I can walk out happy after a 2 digit bill ! Yes you heard me right we paid about $40 and we were happy .  since they weigh food (A pound a bag), The secret is in the shell ,   there was less shell or thinner shells in shrimps and mussels  therefore more meat for us to enjoy ! Simple math .. I hope they don't  change the price after reading this though. we ordered a pound of shrimp and a pound of mussels in the captains boil signature sauce nonetheless and we were happy as clams :-) because the sauce was so rich we paired it with only a steamed rice. On other occassion we would order corn too . We tried the Cajun rice which they said was their bestseller and no complains here but hubby and I are good with plain ole steaming white soon to be covered in CB sauce rice. A word of WARNING for the spicy intolerrants their non spicy has a little  kick, Cajun being a naturally spicy flavour , so you might want to go easy on experimenting if you want to enjoy your meal.   And now that there are a lot of these branches popping like kernels I sure as hope they don't change any of their menu or quality as this island girl and her king would be sad fo sho!"}
{"text":"Not the freshest seafood.  Expensive and greasy. Seems like cajun seasoning throughout which is not bad.  Will not repeat.  One and done.  Some may love it however.  To each his own."}
{"text":"YUM YUM FUN! I had a great time earlier this week at the Captain's Boil!   -food was FANTASTIC! Some people wrote about how the seasoning was a little bland for them, I thought it was perfect. Not too salty, not under seasoned.  -the king crab leg was suuuuuper meaty and satisfying, I highly recommend it.  -seafood fried rice was excellent, perfect seasoning -service was a-okay, they were attentive but not overbearing although I wouldn't say they were exceptional or anything. Very neutral experience.  -the wall of craft beer is deceiving... Was expecting a nice list of beer seeing as how they were displaying so many great choices on the wall behind the bar but only had very average choices that you can find anywhere.   The only things that I would change are the temperature of the sink out in front (water was freeeeeeezing!), beer selection (either serve better beer or take down the huge selection from the wall), and I wish they gave us a waste bucket for the seafood shells. It gets a bit messy/crowded to be eating next your growing pile of shells. Otherwise, I had a great time and a great meal and can't wait to get my next gluttonous seafood fix. Yum!!!"}
{"text":"Food was really good.  I had the captains udon and seafood.  Service was almost horrible.  Took awhile for the girl to even come over and take our order.  Food just came out randomly.   Out of 8 people mine was last, but I mean everyone else was well into eating.  We were not given refills on water without asking for them.  It even seemed like we were an inconvenience to the girl serving us.  Luckily the only thing that saved the service was the guy who helped out after our water request and we never dealt with the girl again thank god.  The food was good but wouldn't come back to this location based on service alone."}
{"text":"I kept hearing about The Captain's Boil, so I decided to check it out with some friends.  Service was efficient. Our order was taken promptly and food was brought to our table without having to wait too long.   We had a Groupon, however; in addition we ordered some more items off the menu. The seafood itself was pretty good; however it was MESSY!  I'd read reviews previously of people saying that this, but it was a little more than I'd expected. We were left with grease spots on the table due to the leaking sauce from the bag. Even with the plastic gloves, I still couldn't quite contain the mess.   Overall, the food is good but be prepared for the mess! Also, while I can't really complain about anything, I can't say that I'm anxiously waiting to go back."}
{"text":"So good! Really good food, really nice waiters, but too cramped. I could probably reach over to the next table and grab their shrimp. Other than that, food is amazing and I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I can't say it's jaw dropping good but it's decent. Shame that they charge small sides like corn and potatoes. In the states those come for free so it sucks when you have to pay $2 for a small piece of a side.  Mussels and shrimp are delicious. At $12/lb and 15/lb, the king crab was massive for a pound. But don't know if it's worth it.   Gets super busy after 630. So come before then. Staff is friendly but sometimes you have to wave them down.   Try it out!"}
{"text":"Going in not sure what to expect, I was pleasantly surprised by the atmosphere, service, and quantity of food as it felt like a buffet. We got the shrimps and chicken slices with a side of fried rice which I would highly recommend getting. It's definitely a fun experience going with Friends or taking someone out on a really casual date as you eat with a bib and gloves. However, the only con I would say is the morning after as it's a complete shit storm :D .Overall I'd give it 3 boils out of 5"}
{"text":"Loved it !!!  The whole experience was real nice . The service here is on point .  The flavours of the food and literally finger licking good.   Would suggest you trying this place once in order for you to love it .   Be aware you eat with your hands . So no white shirts and for first date get ready to get down and dirty ."}
{"text":"When I came here, the place was empty and we had the full attention of the staff - and they were exceptionally nice.  This was the first captains boil franchise that I tried and they met my expectations.  Comparing to other of these types of establishments, I'd rate them on par and would definitely go again."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying this is a really really good restaurant to go to. Their portions are unbelievably good, and the food is of great quality too. The added bob is a bonus it helps to stop you from getting your attire dirty as you dig into the delicious food. As gloves are also provided so you don't have to worry about fingers getting dirty. Service is really good here as they have an upstairs and a downstairs. I find that this location is usually packed; why not be they're so good. Food portions here go by the pound. This restaurant is a really good location for someone who truly loves to eat seafood. I will definitely be going back in the near future."}
{"text":"As soon as I walked in, I knew it was going to be a messy meal. People had their bibs on and were wearing gloves. This place lets us humans be our primal selves and eat with our hands in a socially acceptable way!! It helps that the food is delicious.   It goes without saying that there is lots of plastic in use...plastic cups, bib, gloves and even the table cloth. Hopefully its all recyclable material because this kind of hurts their green footprint...  The lunch special is a must for me. Before 4pm, you can get a fish or chicken teriyaki plate for $10.95. There is just something about fried fish that tastes so damn good so thats what I got. The lunch plate came with 5 pieces of fish, 2 crawfish, some clams and some mussels. Super filling.  Service was somewhat incapable but I think thats because the location and the employees were new...they didnt know any of the beers!..nor did they know our orders when giving us our food! Overlooked though, food was great!"}
{"text":"So the food is not bad at all. I'm very happy with the freshness and flavor but there are many drawbacks to this place.     You will be greeted immediately with a sign on the front window that shows you a time limit.  When you get inside you tend to understand why. You will be crammed in like sardines. Basically inches away from the person next to you which sucks cause its a messy experience.    The cost is immense. You will not leave feeling full. I went with a friend and the bill after tax and tip was 50 bucks each. I had immediate remorse after eating here.   The experience just isnt there with this place. It feels like they try to rush you in and out.   The cajun fries dipped in the sauce that the fish comes in was just insanely good though.   Wouldnt go back."}
{"text":"Finally opened on the west end! Long to try the infamous Captain's Boil sauce since their first store in Toronto and it finally opened down the street, how convenient!  Took my mom here on her birthday, cuz her only request was lobster lol and she loved it. They were having a lobster special for their grand opening. So it was a pretty good deal. And its my mom's first time trying seafood served like this, i ordered everything for her to try. I cane here to try their sauce cuz ive been to other places so i picked the Captains boil sauce for everything. Overall, food was good. Service was okay, the guy who took my order barely understood english and wasnt sure what i was saying. We came around 6ish so it was still quite empty, but there was a crowd waiting soon around 7pm. Sat for a long while before anyone came to serve us drinks and take my order. Also didnt quite explain the me u well so my mom had no clue what we were getting lol but it was fine, i did all the ordering and she enjoyed dinner."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try last night! BOY OH BOY, we did not have reservations because they only take reservations for parties of 8+, so we had a 1 hour wait when arriving at 9:30PM.  This place is definitely not huge, they do have an upper floor and a lower basement floor but are for large parties.  The main floor consists of tables and booths, and the booths definitely take up a lot of space, makes it a little crammed.    We ordered the whole lobster in garlic sauce, clams in garlic sauce with mild spice, mussels with lemon pepper on mild, and cajun fries.  I can't really take spice personally, so my mouth was on fire, but it was sooooo good!  Their prices are definitely not cheap, but it is 100% worth it because the size of the seafood is huge!  All the food was boiled well, and everything was fresh.  I do wish they had the lobster claw clippers rather than a pair of scissors for me to cut through the thick claw, or maybe I just didn't know how to use the tool.    Service was good, except we had to ask for extra ketchup like 4 times, but the food was too delicious for us to care about that too much.  One of the servers, not sure if he's the manager, came by once we payed our bill and checked in with us to see if everything tasted great and if we had any feedback, definitely appreciated that.  I will definitely be back again to try more dishes with my other friends!   HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"}
{"text":"Visited here with a few of my friends on Wednesday night to give it a try, I usually visit the locations closer to uptown.  The advantage of this location is that you can make reservations, and they're also not as busy compared to other locations.  The seating is more spacious, and the area is nice in Little Italy!  Service here was excellent, servers checked in on us very often, and the food quality was on par with other locations, seafood was well cooked.  Our waters were always topped up, and buckets were replaced, basically the table was kept clean.  It was nice, because other locations just leave you tossing everything on the table, and if gets overwhelming when you have too many shells. The only dish we all didn't really like was the chicken tender, it was too salt, and tasted more batter than chicken.  Mussels could've been cooked a little less so that it's not as dry, but all our other seafood (crawfish, clams, shrimp, and snow crab legs) were cooked well.    Would definitely revisit this location if I'm downtown the next time I decide to go."}
{"text":"Since i am a vegetarian, I had to choose from limited options. I ordered lotus root, okra, and potato with steamed. Initially they served just the dish in a plastic bag and it looked wierd. But then the waitress said that I need to eat this with gloves. Since I am from USA this seemed somewhat new and I wanted to try it out. I have to say I loved it. I ordered medium spicy but it was very spicy; exactly as I wanted. It went well with the steamed rice and i enjoyed the taste. as in the waitress' words, \"This food is about getting messy.\" The reason I took of 1 star is limited options I had."}
{"text":"The worst seafood I've ever had. I'm pretty sure their \"butter\" sauce is margarine or something else fake. I felt so sick after eating there. Please Torontonians do not let this place set the standard for seafood in our city."}
{"text":"Terrible. Food comes in a bag that was steamed. The pop was literally warm, got attitude when I asked for a seperate glass with ice. Not good value. Food tasted terrible.   Would not eat there if it was free."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere, very reasonable pricing! Lots of flavour, ordered the oysters, chicken wings crawfish, shrimp, snow crab legs and chicken teriyaki... wasn't a huge fan of the chicken teriyaki but everything else was so flavourful.... we will be back,it's nice to eat with your hands once in a while :)"}
{"text":"We ordered 2 sizzling plate combos - one fish teriyaki, and one chicken. It comes with rice, fish/chicken, and a seafood platter made up of 2 mussels, 2 shrimps, 2 oysters, and 2 small lobsters. You can also choose which sauce it comes with (cajun, garlic, Captain's Boil) and the spice level. It costs around $12 and is only served until 4 PM.  I'm so glad I chose this because it was delicious and filling! The cajun sauce was bomb and mild spiciness was just right for me! The server was really friendly and recommended us to try the Captain's Boil sauce next time (it's a mixture of all the sauces).  I love the decor and ambience of the restaurant too. The bibs were hilarious! There are also hand wash stations situated within the eating areas!!!!!!  Note that the menu doesn't have a variety to choose from besides the seafood-in-a-bag items (there are literally only two options for the sizzling plate dish)! But it was tasty and overall a pleasant experience :)"}
{"text":"Food- Captains boil is a place where you can order different types of seafood like lobster, crab, shrimp, mussels, chicken bites (for non-seafood waters) and mix them with different sauces. The food is served in a plastic bag, you're given plastic gloves and plastic cups to hold water. I ordered the shrimp with medium captain boils sauce. Quite messy, greasy sauce... pretty good flavours but found it overwhelming when it got greasy towards the end! A great seafood experience though (for you seafood fanatics).  Price- fair. about 10-20 depending on what type of seafood you want.   Verdict- it was just okay. Would come back if I'm really craving seafood."}
{"text":"Boiled seafood in a bag. No utensils nor plates. Essentially the only thing in between you and your food is your plastic gloves (literally).   Came here with parents and ordered shrimp, mussels, okra, corn, fries and crawfish. We really just wanted to see what the fuss was about. Needless to say it was a good experience for a first time visit. Very unique concept that really lets you play with your food.   In terms of this specific location (I know franchises have been popping off) - it was great to have a 10% off coupon to invite people in the neighbourhood to try it out. Staff was attentive and the location was very clean. Located where Bersalino used to be at Sheppard/Brimley.   Not sure if I would come back without the coupon but rating it a good experience overall."}
{"text":"Never disappoints! One of my fave places to eat when I craved for seafoods! The clams with mild lemon pepper sauce plus lotus roots is my all time fave! Yummy cajun fries and the okras are a good match to the captain's boil sauce. Be prepared to eat messy even with the bib and gloves provided but you'll have fun while you're at it!"}
{"text":"Get their seafood fried rice! They use the captain's boil sauce for it and it is AMAZING!   Obviously the bags of seafood are just as delicious, but the fried rice was just a surprise!"}
{"text":"Quite wild is that they bring the seafood over in a plastic bag, steeping in sauce. Shrimp were good, sauce was tasty, all quite messy, well supported by there being bibs and gloves to keep most of the mess off the diner. This would not be a good place to go for a formal date in fancy clothing, there is plenty of risk of mess."}
{"text":"I came to The Captains Boil for the first time today with a party of 8 people. They are very strict on seating if you have a reservation and will not seat you until the entire party has arrived.   That being said, once we were seated the wait was worth it's weight in gold. We were seated downstairs in the basement at a table that was the right size for our group.   Our server Michelle immediately attended to the table and asked if she could get us drinks. We ended up waiting and placing our order shortly after as we were all starving.   We order Muscles, Oysters, Shrimp, and Lobster. All of which has various flavors. I found the Cajun and Garlic to be quite enjoyable.   Some people may find the fact that you eat with your hands and have no plates strange, but once you get over it its actually a lot of fun. They provide bibs and gloves so it makes it less messy, but anticipate leaving smelling like you just went for a swim in the ocean!   I will defiantly be back! I will tell my friends too!"}
{"text":"They're known for their seafood feasts here but it's not cheap. I love their clams, shrimps and snow crab legs and I wouldn't recommend their mussels since they're super tough and old. You get to choose the seafood you want the sauce for each order, I would recommend the garlic or Cajun. Overall it's pretty good since it's just steamed seafood in sauces and it does the job if you want tons of seafood for a meal."}
{"text":"Came here with my girlfriend for our 4-Year Anniversary. Wow. I never thought I'd have to make up a food-term; although, \"fall-off-the-shell\" comes to mind.  Now I know shellfish is normally tender in and of itself, something was different about this. I was pulling rather than breaking, squeezing rather than cracking. The meat was easily available with minimal work compared what's expected.  I've had shellfish many times throughout my life; tails, legs, rolls (my favourite), but never as a Cajun Boil, and never with an Asian flare to it. That flavour. My goodness, it was last night and I'm still thinking about it!  First they give you your beverage (as expected). Next comes the Sides; we both had the Cajun Fries, the spice factor was perfect -- great way to wet the appetite. Finally, the main course; we had both the Lobster & Snow Crab, Captain's Sauce, Medium Heat.  While the Snow Crab was delicious, the Lobster truly shined. I didn't know shellfish could have flavour like this -- and I love shellfish already as it is! They have 4 sauces; with the 4th, the Captain's Sauce, being a culmination of the first 3.  I'd say if it's your first time; go all in:  * Get the Lobster * Captain's Sauce * Medium Heat * Pick whatever Side * Sapporo Beer to chase  Sapporo is actually my favourite beer to that also worked out. This place is amazing; try it out. Next stop for us is Louisiana.  P.S.: It gets busy around dinner. Go there about 45 minutes before you intend to eat, get your name on the list, and either come back or hang around the area until they give you a call."}
{"text":"Good seafood selections! Flavour is on point. Service was quick and the crews were friendly. Its a good plAce to bring your family. It' s fun to eat. My only problem, PARKING LOT!!! It was a pain in the buttocks to find parking!"}
{"text":"I would give this place a 3.5 stars.  The good: The special signature sauce that they have is really tasty, made up of a combination of the individual flavours. I loved how much the food was smothered in this sauce (high sodium alert). The lotus root as an addition is perfect.  The okay: The service was acceptable, wasn't great but wasn't awful. The Cajun fries were just okay.   The bad: Since it's mainly one sauce, it can taste about the same. You really have to be good with eating seafood. Prepare for your hands and teeth to get messy. If they provided some tools, it would've been useful for the lobster.  Tips: Coming for a table of two gets you a seat faster."}
{"text":"I have been to three different captain boil in downtown Toronto and the one across Vaughan Mills. I was super excited that Newmarket was finally getting their own Captain boil.   This was the first time that I did take out and I must say it was definitely not the same as eating inside. It was still delicious but even more messy since you would be cleaning up your own mess at home.   They were super quick in getting my order ready too. Everyone greeted me as I walked to the back to pick up my order. Lot more people working in the Newmarket location than the downtown locations. I got mussels, shrimps and fries. Cajun fries were a must, they were still crispy on the outside and packed with flavor. The mussels and shrimps were delicious, were warm by the time I got home, would have been better if they were hot. That was uncontrollable.   Would definitely come here again. Preparing this at home would just take too much effort and time."}
{"text":"Came here twice already! Definitely worth the experience if you have never tried something similar before.   They don't take reso for parties less than 8. My honest advice is to come here on a weeknight. For weekend, try to arrive before 5:30 or after 10 then you should be good to go. (P.s. we waited for 2.5 hours on a saturday for a table of 5.. we also arrived at 6:30...)   Tips: dress warm if you do decide to wait in line, the indoor waiting area is extrmemly small, you will most likely be forced to wait outside.  Ladies! Bring a hairtie if you have long hair! The table would become a murder scene by the end of night! Juice flies everywhere and don't come here with a date! Be prepare to get dirty (no pun intended)!  Got shellfish allergies? No problem! They have non-shellfish dishes. But why come here if you can't enjoy the deliciousness?  They didn't have crawfish both times I went there... I am not sure if they ever restock but it's pretty lame coz I really wanted to try it.   All the seafood tastes great on the menu. Try all their flavors! I also really like their rice!   Overall: 5/5 frigging love seafood! It's heaven for seafood lover!  Service: 4/5 it gets busy I get it, no worries!  Food: 5/5 flavorful, unique, delicious!  Ambiance: 4/5 loud, not great for small parties.   bon appetit! Xx"}
{"text":"It was great, we had shrimp and snow crab legs with the captains boil sauce. And the server was great as well we had originally ordered the crawfish but they weren't what we thought they were so she brought us the shrimp instead."}
{"text":"First time here, food was pretty good. Had the clams, fried rice and Cajun fries. Love how this place looks, one thing that bugged me was our waiter smelled like smoke. Kinda a turn off. The food was great but it being my first time I wasn't really blown away. Would go back because of the food and it's affordability $13 or so for a pound isn't bad"}
{"text":"i've been here twice and it's better than the york mills location (food wise). The service is just as good at both.   5/5 on customer service (quick, and always attentive)  5/5 on food (comes out hot and tasty) + cute bibs lol   it does get really busy but i could tell the staff work together so it doesn't look like they're overwhelmed    i bet the kitchen staff are always on a roll during high volume hours   i'll be back and i highly recommend"}
{"text":"This is great seafood. However the way they serve food is terrible for the environment. Even though they have bags that are food-grade BPA, whatever, there are still huge amounts of garbage generated for each table. However, I'm not sure if they have an alternative serving style to resort to. I love the sauce they put on their seafood and the way they cook it is simply scrumptious. The service leaves much to be desired. Been sitting for 30 mins for food - took 7 to get a glass of water and our menus. Great food. Terrible service."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time with a group of friends for a birthday.Surprisingly they are super strict about attendance. Even though we made reservations and more than half of our party was present, they still wouldn't seat us and let us stare at our empty reserved table...kinda weird. (The don't take reservations unless its a part of 8+)  My bf and I shared a pound of Clams, Mussels, and shrimp in Captain Boil's sauce, mild spicy. We wanted to try crawfish but they didn't have it. The Captain Boil sauce is a mix of all three sauce (garlic, cajun, and lemon pepper). I loved the sauce, it was really good and super garlicy. We added the corn too which was really good as it absorbed all the flavor but note the corn is $1 for only half of the corn which i found expensive and silly.  Everything was served in bags and you eat with plastic gloves which was convenient. However the sauce does go through the gloves so you need to be really careful with what you touch. I don't like how they reach over you serving you the bags of seafood though because the bags have sauce on them and it would be deadly if they accidentally get the bag on you or your clothes.  I liked the Clams and the shrimp the most. The sweet potatoe fries were good - strange how it was served with ketchup. i just went ahead and dipped it in my Captain Boil sauce. The Cajun fries were super crispy and yummy - wish it had more cajun powder on it though.  Overall it was a really good experience. The food was good, ingredients were fresh, flavors were there, but quite expensive.  Note, when you leave the restaurant you will be like a walking cajun seafood - All the cajun smell will stick to your clothes and hair and body, just like after eating at a korean restaurant."}
{"text":"Great place! Can get crowded at times but it's well worth the wait. King Crab for the $$ is a good choice. Spices and seasoning is on point. Goes great with a beer."}
{"text":"Clams are amazing. They're nice and juicy. I would recommend the Captains Boil sauce on everything.   Mild is perfect for me but the fiancée loves spicy food and got fire! He was sweating and I was dying when I tried his sauce.  No spice - not spicy at all  Mild - a little kick (recommended to start from here)  Medium - more than I could handle but fiancée sticks to this one from now on. Has the perfect amount of spice for someone who doesn't wanna have a stomach ache later lol  Fire - the name explains itself. Not for kids   2lbs per person is perfect for us. We always get clams with either shrimp or the king crab.  Side of corn for a dollar is a steal and the sausages are great for $6.95 right now. I might cheap out when it's back to $10...   Forget the gloves and get dirty! Have fun and come right at 5pm if you don't wanna wait too long for a table of 2 (always on a weekday).   Lastly.... Still haven't tried the crawfish yet! It's never there. I'll need to go back and try it.    Comparisons: I love the boil in NYC for their sauce but considering that's a tad far, captains boil is a great alternative!"}
{"text":"Super salty! It's a place to try once and that's all. They ran out of crawl fish when we were there. Don't like eating out of plastic plates and utensils."}
{"text":"I want to give 3.5 stars. Their seafood is quite fresh. We ordered the shrimp ($12.95/lb), mussels ($10.95), clams ($12.95), claw fish (MP) and the seafood fried rice ($10.95). We also added okra ($5.95) and corn ($1 each) into the bags. Maybe because we chose Captain's boiled as flavor for all the seafood, they all taste the same haha..however, the seafood is fresh; mussels and clams have lots of meat. In terms of the seafood fried rice, it's actually quite interesting because it reminds me of Popeyes. lol I would go back and try their fries next time."}
{"text":"Came here on a Monday hoping we would be able to get a seat because it just opened on the weekend. Staff was very friendly and attentive,  this is the first time I have been to a boil restaurant and I throughly enjoyed it.   My girlfriend went to boiling crab in California and said the sauce there was better but I really enjoyed the captains boil sauce.  It was a mix of Cajun with Asian flavours so good!  Next time I will get it really spicy but got mild because of the GF.   Get the corn and soak it in the captains boil sauce. Amazing."}
{"text":"Very original concept and very good food for seafood lovers/likers who wish to try different seafood things than the fancy or the Chinese styles.  Waiters are nice and good advisors. For them, not much to do otherwise (no dishes... you use your fingers; no plates, no forks, all in plastic otherwise).  Just 3 things on the par... - pretty expensive at the end if you really want to enjoy it and be full - no desserts (or no one invited me for having one) - no lemony napkins at the end of the meal to wash your hands... bring some!!! especially if you plan to go elsewhere afterwards (yeah yeh.... washroom and soap can do it... but still... )... I nice thing to have in such place ( they give you some at any fried chicken places)"}
{"text":"Thought it was just a new hipster place in town but after trying it,  I was impressed with how good the seafood was!  It's not craw fish season so they had none. We were told it's like a mini lobster but there isn't much meat in them anyway. Got the shrimp instead, also mussels, Dungeness crab, and Cajun fries.   They have technically 4 sauce choices: cajun, lemon pepper, garlic, and captain's boil (all 3 mixed together). They kind of all tasted the same too me after a while and I just remember Cajun and captain's boil being the best.   Fries were mediocre. My friends and I were already full from the seafood and the fries ended up being an overkill. Everything else we ordered was delicious and worth trying!"}
{"text":"I am not a sea food lover, but my girlfriend is. She got a pound of muscles with the captain boil sauce and I got a large chicken wings with Cajun fries.   It was an awesome experience because everyone is eating with a bib and gloves on. I had chicken wings so it wasn't so bad for me. The Cajun fries are delicious and would definitely go back just for the fries  I love how the waitress filled up my water everything it was empty which is a major plus. They helped get the machine asap which I like so I can just pay and get out.   Parking is kinda tough if it's full you'll b looking for parking. Evening time it's too packed so that's why going first thing on a Saturday is a pretty good idea!"}
{"text":"Second time at a Captain Boil and this location was better than the first! This location has friendly service and on point with everything! The fries are to die for... I had to order another side of them they were that delicious and crispy and everything I want in a fry...  In the vaughan area which is convenient for me and there's tons of parking. The other location was more in the downtown area and difficult to get parking.   They played really great music, loved the vibe, will definitely come back again soon!"}
{"text":"The food is flavourful and the service was great. Honestly the seafood tasted fresh but the seasoning is quite salty. Like it tastes great but my tongue was kind of numb cause it was so salty. But I mean overall it's a great place and be price was reasonable."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever. On top of that, the food wasn't even good so I don't understand the hype. It's not hard to buy a few pounds of seafood and make it yourself at home. The biggest complaint I had was the service. We were served by an asian girl with a short buzz cut and she was extremely rude. It was so hard for us to get her attention, and half the time, she was just standing around doing nothing. At the very beginning, she was alright, but as time went on, she started giving us more and more attitude. At that point, we still thought we should tip her because maybe she just had a long day, but when we requested for water, she said okay and left us hanging around for a good 10-15 minutes. While we waited, she would occasionally look at us then quickly glance away. Eventually we asked another server for the bill and left and we didn't tip a single cent to her. It was the first time we didn't tip at a restaurant because I've never been given service THIS bad before. Stay away from this location if you don't want your meal ruined by terrible customer service."}
{"text":"One sentence: it's a lot of work LOL I'm sitting here tired and full at the end of my meal. I had shrimps, mussels and snow crab. All very well cooked I choose awesomely all with captains sauce in mild. My bf got the crawfish the mussels and the shrimps. He was not so lucky took him an hour to eat only the crawfish. He will definitely not be getting those again if we come bAck. Everything was good EXCEPT the seafood rice was yucky and covered in oil with no taste will definitely not get that again. If we r craving shrimp and mussels we will be back"}
{"text":"Captain's Boil is one of these places where you have saw pictures all over FB because one of your friends have already tried it.  So, why shouldn't I as well?  Since we have heard night time is the busiest, we decided to try it on a Saturday afternoon.  With no reservations under 6 people, the wait wasn't that bad.  10 mins.  Between two of us, we ordered 1lb of Shrimps $12.95 with corn in the bag, 1lb of mussels $10.95, Cajun fries, and 1lb of crawfish $17 bucks.  I really love how they cook everything in a bag, since we don't know which sauce (Cajun, Lemon, Garlic)  to get it with we gotten the EVERTHING aka Captain Boil's sauce hehe.  The food came up QUICK!  Actually, too quick to wonder if they are already cooked and steaming'ly waiting for their patrons LOL.  And without hesitations we put on our gloves and bibs and opened up the bags slowly to not burn ourselves.  IT WAS SO GOOD! ... but WAIT where the heck is my $3 corn? (yes, I was digging into my Shrimp bag)  Yep, they forgot it Arrrrrrrrrrgh (no pun intended here, but I think I actually made that noise tho).  Yes,  after another quick U turn to the kitchen, they brought it ... in a separate bag.  Either that bag is much bigger than the rest or the corn was for Ant Man, as far as I can tell, there was only 3 pieces of corn in that bag.  Each piece is  1/2 - 1 inch thick.  YES $3 bucks of corn at a grocery stores can get me a dozen of actual full size, non-chopped cobs of corn.  (Note to self - don't get the extras).  I'm usually a big fan with seafood, but the crawfish *sigh* they are like mini lobster and due to their size, they look kinda cute.  Not going to lie, I felt a bit bad breaking them apart to eat really, just the tiny little tail of theirs L  Don't get the crawfish (not worth it).  BUT the shrimp and mussels on the other hand is well worth it!  Very tasty too!  The mussels were cooked just right and its not tiny J  The shrimp I believe is the BEST deal.  At T&T frozen shrimps will cost you $7-10 / lb.  Here's only $12.95 and it's well marinated + cooked for you.  I will definitely come back again to try the lobster and King Carb.  Parking is a pain at this location.  Try college park or on the street by TPS headquarters .  Highlight of the visit: Getting my money's worth for the corn. I mean the lack of corns.  Food (Taste): 5/5 Food (Presentation): 5/5 Kitchen (Delivery Speed): 5.5/5 Service: 4/5 - had to ask for napkins and more water Ambiance: 4.5/5 - a bit too loud Fun Factor: 5/5 - FUN!! My fingers smell like Cajun sauce for a full day and a half :)"}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday night with a party of 8. The first thing I noticed when walking in is the ambiance and nautical decor, which really made the franchise restaurant comfortable and cozy. Despite being a new restaurant which opened last week, the staff were well-trained, very friendly and attentive to our needs. Our glasses were always kept full and the scrap buckets were always kept empty!   As for food, we had sweet potato fries as appetizer and clams, mussels, lobster, and king crab for main. The seafood came in bags and were served piping hot- an indication of fresh, high-quality ingredients complemented with a generous douse of their signature cajun spicy sauce. We opted to try as many sauce-seafood combinations as we could, but my favourite has got to be their clams with \"fire\" sauce. Apparently this was not the most spicy sauce they had to offer, but it still packed a kick and catered to my intense craving of all things spicy.   We ended the night with strawberry ice-cream, which was complimentary as part of their grand opening. To top it all off, we received 10% off! It was a wonderful dining experience and this new location definitely did not disappoint. Now I know where to go when I crave seafood in the upcoming winter months!"}
{"text":"This is my first time coming to this location as my boyfriend and I have been to 2 other locations in Toronto.  My first impressions of this place was the restaurant was nicely designed and very clean.  I came here with a group of 20 people for a birthday dinner.  The moment my boyfriend and I arrived we were seated immediately as we were the first of the 20 to arrive.  The waitress was very friendly and asked if we wanted to start off with a drink, we kindly refused and said we would wait until the rest of the party to arrive.  Fast forward, we all have ordered our food and everything is going well except for the little mix up with who ordered what, but that was \"figured out\" quickly.  The food was okay, I have tried better but it was still good it also came out right after we ordered them which was a plus. The waiters were attentive and friendly.  Now time for the bill......they DO NOT do SEPARATE billing which is complete bs!  They basically give you one bill and make you figure out yourself what each group ordered.  What a complete nightmare!  I mean everyone remembered what they ordered but having to figure out separating the bill amongst eachother was so time consuming and aggravating.  I understand that their system does not allow them to separate the bill (this needs to change as other captain boil locations have systems where they are able to do separate billing) but the least the waiter could've done was assist us with the billing by cross referencing what she had put down on her ipad for what each group got....but NOPE they were too lazy for that.   Once everyone paid, the waitress came back and told us we were short $40.00.....ughhhh well if they had done their job in the first place by SEPARATING THE DAMN BILL WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH THIS AGAIN!!! Some of us already overpaid (my boyfriend and I included) by compensating for the bill being short.  Once we solved the issue of the short $40.00, she then comes back to us saying we are actually short $100.00 seriously.....huge argument between us and the staff.  The birthday girl told the waitress she used to work for the food industry and had counted the money in front of them and cross referenced the bill with what we had paid for....basically she did their job for them because they were too brainless to figure it out themselves.  At the end, they were wrong and they had miscounted the money, I mean c'mmon before you go out telling the customer they're short money double check or triple check before you make yourself look ridiculous.  Anywaaaaaaays, I will definitely NOT be coming back to this location, such a headache this place was.  They definitely need to revamp their billing system as I see majority of the reviews here are having problems with it.  I recommend you going to the other locations to save yourself the headache."}
{"text":"Love this location. Its is spacious. They even have a private function room good for 50 people. Servers are good. Food is awesome. We ordered 2 bag of shrimp in captain boil sauce, 1 bag of lotus veggie, 1 bag of mussels in captain boil sauce, 1 shrimp basket, 1 order of cajun fries and 1 platter of seafood fried rice plus 4 pop. We paid $101 plus tip.  He lotus veggies is so good. The only downside, they don't serve sizzling teriyaki chicken or sizzling teriyaki fish after 4 pm. They still have the sizzling platter with seafoods from 12-4pm. We will definitely come back. Probably we will try their function room."}
{"text":"Captain's boil!!  Time to see what boils it this Resturant!  Starting off with customer service. The waitress was good. She wasn't dull or treated it as a job but she seemed excited to make my first captains boil experience be a good one.   Food quality. The quality and flavor of the food there is really good. Never tasted something like this before. At end I used the garlic bread scrub off all the sauce and eat it all up hahaha. I had the captains boil sauce.  Food portion. In my opinion the portion is a bit small for the price. I had the daily special. I wasn't full and I go for another round so the price is somewhat okay.   Lasting impression. Captains boil is a good place to hang out if you like sea food. Great for dinner party as well.  Below is just a small sample of what you can get there.  Lobster Crab legs  Shrimps Crawfish etc  What I like: Clean Good selection of sea food Sauce is amazing Good service  General look and feel of the Resturant is nice.  What I don't like. Price is a little high but then again it's sea food."}
{"text":"Queen Street West location:  Compliments all round are pretty much seconded and would be somewhat redundant.   Service was great as was the food.  I wouldn't want it every day but it was an excellent experience.  Dessert menu was simple mostly ice cream in nature.  One small quibble.  Two doors to enter or leave.  The inner door was no problem because it was in the correct \"open out\" position.  The outer door \"opened in\".  Both doors should \"open out\" to make emergency exits barrier free.  Just saying ...  This location was accessible!"}
{"text":"First visit. no shell fish, lobster, dungeness crab. Waited for 40 min since i ordered. Food is good but Poor service."}
{"text":"Interesting twist - boiled seafood served in plastic bags!  Location/decor: -It is locate on west side of Yonge street where you can't miss it with the signs. -Inside, it is long and narrow where I think they overpacked the spot with tables as you are pretty close to your neighbors. With all the tables, the noise level is quite loud but I think if you get one of the box seats it would be quieter. -Service is friendly and fast where plastic gloves are provided for you to eat  Food: -General idea is that you are ordering different types of seafood with your selection of sauces. The ordering is done by weight e.g. 1lb and etc. -For the 2 of us, we ordered the following: 1lb of shrimp in garlic sauce, 1lb of clams in captains boil sauce, 1 dungeness crab in medium spicy captains boil sauce, sweet potatoe fries and a corn. -The food comes as it is cooked so we had our shrimp, clams and then crab. -Flavourwise - the sauces were pretty good. We really like the garlic sauce for the shrimp. Our favourite dish was the clams in the captains sauce - it was a good portion of meat in them. Crab was also fresh and tasty -However, the letdown was the corn which was really a small piece e.g. 1/3 cob which they charged $1 and wasn't worth it.  Overall, there was neat novelty to eating the seafood out of the bag so it is definitely worth to try once but the flavours didn't completely blow me away. I would come back to try the mussels and crawfish for next time."}
{"text":"Cool concept!  It's not often that I eat an entire meal with only my hands (although we got gloves). This would be a good place to check out for avid seafood lovers. We ordered the lobster, king crab, mussels, potatoes, sausage (with the Captain's Boil sauce) and Cajun fries. Everything was good for the most part but the sauce was a bit too garlicky and I would recommend the Cajun sauce instead. The king crab priced at around $20/lb ended up only being a single crab leg which was kinda overpriced... All in all, it was a good experience and it's something I would recommend trying."}
{"text":"It was my first experience at Captain's Boil and I was definitely not wow'd as I thought I would be. Prices are pretty pricey and my friends and I didn't get full. I wouldn't recommend this place if youmve got a big appetite and tight pockets. But if you got the money you'll enjoy."}
{"text":"The 3rd Captain's Boil and I had a better experience here than the downtown location. Maybe because it wasn't busy that the service was much better perhaps. However I did enjoy my food better here as well. I totally recommend getting the sausage and potatoes !! Of course you can't forget trying the crab, shrimp and clams as well"}
{"text":"Total bill including tax and tip $155. Not coming back.  Fried shrimp (frozen tempura you can buy at the grocery store).  Fried calamari (thin and full of batter).  Crab cakes (thin and full of potato filling - no crab). Lobster sandwich (4pieces - no taste). Fish & Chips (fresh fish). Seafood Fried rice (nice cajun spice). Dungeness crab (big shell - no meat). 1lbs shrimp (good size shrimp)."}
{"text":"Didn't know this place existed until just recently, and I'm super glad a friend introduced it to me. The restaurant had its grand opening just a couple of days prior, so despite it being fairly busy, we were seated right away. The staff were all very friendly and attentive, the atmosphere was great, and our food arrived quick. I ordered the mussels with potatoes in their recommended Captain's Boil sauce, which came in a big bag we ate out of with a bib and some gloves. It was absolutely delicious and the experience was extremely enjoyable! Although it was a bit pricey, I highly recommend giving this place a try! I've already made plans to go back again."}
{"text":"my first time going and I am absolutely amazed by the incredible flavours. the juices from the sauce were exactly on point had the lobster mussles shrimp like I said the flavours finger licking good down to the last bite.  for sure I'll be returning 100%"}
{"text":"The food is superb. Excellent service. Whats not to love? Although i wish there was an option for a non spicy crawfish, it lit my tongue on fire!!! Buts its alright keep rocking Cap!!!"}
{"text":"The woe st location vaughan mills and sherway gardena are the best everything else comes second and tinge and finch is dead last"}
{"text":"Ok let me start by saying this I absolutely love the captains boil and have been to MANY locations  my first experiance with the captains boil was like 2/3 years ago at the yonge and finch location  and since then I've been to little Italy , Sheppard and mccowan, tong and college  sherway gardena and vaughan locations and vaughan is my top.3.gollowed by sherway and the ready are pretty good BUT the tong and finch location has Fell OFF  when it comes to the food also when u tell them that th3 food has been served and therea a problem with it the staff are condescending and act very intitled the firat time I had to tell them about the sizzling plate fish and the breading was OFFF th3 attitude I got was well thats how it is when I am a very experienced captain boiler then I got a sizzling plate and the clams legit yes they were open but it was slimy bad clams that even tho they were opened still were under cooled and then they gave me 4 extra clams cooked properly wen I left o was sick for 3 days and at the end of everything after telling me th3y would give me a r3fund they gave me a 10$ coupons n then changed the rules foe the sizzling plate to a done in special only one week after I recieved my coupon I urge every one to stay clear of the yonge and finch location!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"My friends and I went on an eating spree today and our first stop was Captains boil at the Yonge location. It was 2 pm and no line up (yay), it was perfect since we knew that line ups could take up to an hour or more. We got captains boil crawfish, shrimp and mussels, all medium spicy. It was more delicious than I can capture on photo. A bit on the pricey side but it was well worth it, considering the freshness and flavour. Only complain would be the service. It took a while to get our orders, even though there was only a few customers at the time. Other than that, our experience was great!"}
{"text":"I've only eaten here twice, the 1st time had quick and attentive servers, while the 2nd visit we encountered brain-dead zombie servers!!   I'll start with the service - which wasn't consistent for both visits. The 2nd visit everyone was ignored while the derpy servers had a frat party at the back counter.  I literally waved both arms in the air for 5 Mins trying to get their attn. NOPE - even when they did occasionally turn their heads ...they never saw my desperate motions to interrupt gossip time and order more food.   Oh yeah - THE FOOOOOD!!! 1st time = Delicious and mouth watering shrimp  2nd time = Arrrrr Matey's ABANDON SHIP!! The shrimp was bland and seemed like it had been microwaved for 1 minute then brought to the table. It arrived in the black no of an eye and was hot from the inside not outside. The sauce was just oil with a seasoning that had not merged with the oil. Like they had gotten a divorce and refused to be in the same bag together. But agreed only to please the shrimp - as long as they didn't have to sit beside each other.   Sigh - again, I boasted about a place being soooo good and built it up with my friends. Only to bring them There for the shiest meal.  And it was my friends birthday   He did however get to wear a cute plastic pirate Bib - so there's that."}
{"text":"So freaking good. Snow crab legs and muscles are my picks. Didn't like the mushy shrimp and didn't feel good after eating. Seafood fried rice is okay. Not a lot of shrimp and the mini scallops are kind of a joke. Cajun fries yummy for a cheat treat. They need a better, more sanitary paper towel system."}
{"text":"Tonight's dinner was exceptional. Lobster in the captain boils seasoning and shrimp in the lemon pepper sauce was amazing (as always) we shared the fried rice and there was TONS of seafood in it! Staff is so friendly! Will be going back again!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time coming to The Captain's Boil. Overall I would say my experience was positive as I had enjoyed the food and I was with good company. The interior was nicely decorated.   PROS: This restaurant is good for seafood lovers, groups of friends and for messy eaters. Nice vibe.  CONS: This restaurant is probably not the best for people with history of cholesterol, gout or high levels of mercury so just be aware if you have those medical conditions. Another thing to be aware of is THE AFTERMATH.  What is THE AFTERMATH? Basically after you eat their amazing food drenched in different sauces, your farts and burps will have the most extreme smell. This would be the perfect meal to eat if you plan on creating the MOST ULTIMATE DUTCH OVEN. So if you plan to eat here with someone you share a bed with....just know that both of you will have to be able to handle the smell of the aftermath. I'm not joking.  PRICE: Reasonable. I mean...if you want to get 9 lbs of shrimp then it will be expensive. You can make it as cheap or expensive as you want.   SERVICE: It was okay. The kitchen and waiter had some communication issues or lack of organization. For example, each person had ordered 2 different types of seafood (1 shrimp and 1 mussels with a corn in that bag), we had received many orders missing corn or missing an entire pound of something. So we had to always ask where our food was and when we did receive it, it was missing the corn or the potatoes. So we had to ask the waiter to double check what we had already asked him to double check. The manager in general was good, she kept telling our table that she will take care of it. But there seemed to still be a discrepancy with the kitchen and serving staff as we had to ask for missing food items.  You know how in McDonalds they have the metal tray area where it has Chicken nuggets section, McDouble section, Big Mac? I think they do something similar with their food where everything is in a bag in a section and they just grab what they think is what they need. Because we kept getting out orders without corn or without potato when we had asked. And every time it was \"checked on\", there were still missing items. Food tasted good when it did come. I like the captains boil sauce (everything mixed together).  THINGS TO IMPROVE/CONSTRUCTIVE FEEDBACK:  a) Preparation - water refills took forever. Why not have pitchers of water ready for a large party? The food is salty but delicious and we were REALLY THIRSTY. Another thing is there were no napkins on the table. We had to request 4 times before the waiter could remember. It was a busy Monday, I think the workload on the waiter can be reduced if the napkins or paper towels were on the table. Same with ketchup and extra condiments. Have all those things ready to go so the waiters can focus on taking orders, getting bills rather than prepping what should have been prepped prior to. Just a suggestion. :)  b) ENSURE PROPER HEALTH AND SAFETY?  The restaurant looked very clean. One thing that REALLY BOTHERED ME was the fact that one waiter dropped gloves on the ground and then put the dirty gloves onto the table for the next customers. If you drop a glove, throw it out. It costs like 1 cent per glove. I was turned off by that as people walk all over the ground in the snow and then a glove gets dropped on all that mud/dirt/cigarette butts/poop/whatever you stepped on and then into someones mouth (via the glove). I didn't want to call the waiter out as there were many people. Hope someone from management addresses this as this standard of practice is not acceptable. Many people were around to see the waiter drop the glove and then put that dirty glove back onto the table.   c) Cleaning up Table  I saw a few of the waiters struggle to clean up a table full of shells and bags of wet sauce. They pretty much wrapped it off and carried it away...but there was some leakage. Perhaps bring a garbage bag so that you can shove everything in there and not worry about spilling shells or sauce onto the floor. Less mess, more efficiency.  Overall good food! I would come back. This is a new restaurant so they have a few things to figure out, but those are easy fixes. Would definitely recommend this to friends."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim because my friend and I were in the area. We came at night and the place was crowded but luckily got a table. The table itself was so small, it was better for one person than to share it. My friend and I ordered cajun fries and 1 lbs of shrimp and 2 lbs of mussel. I felt ripped off because we are paying for the shells as well but we only wanted to try it for the experience. The sauce that came with it was alright, I was not wow-ed by it. I like it how these types of places gives you bibs and gloves but what concerns me is the amount of garbage they accumulate in the end due to all the seafood arriving to the table in plastic bags."}
{"text":"Yum! Really enjoyed dinner here. The wait is always very long (at least 40 mins on a good day) but definitely worth it! I tried the garlic flavour, cajun and the captain's boil. They were all pretty good, but the garlic was very light, you couldn't really taste it.. My personal favourite was the captain's boil (which was a mix of all the flavours).  I personally can't stand spicy food, so we chose to go with the mild. It was a little spicy after a few bites so if you don't like spicy food, the normal would be a better choice.  LOVE their cajun fries, they were sosososo good. Probably the best fries I've had in my life. The corn on the cob is also a definite must try! Try dipping in into your favourite seafood bag to get some of the wonderful flavour.  Love the food in bag and DIY concept.. But it could get annoying towards the end.. One thing that really shocked me was the lack of tools for the crab... All they had was a pair of scissors that you had to ask for.  Not sure how they assume you can get to the meat without any sort of cracker/seafood fork/tool.  As for the smell... They give you a pair of gloves, however, even after double gloving, I could not get the smell of seafood to go away!!!!!!! I tried washing, scrubbing and using hand sanitizer and nothing worked!  Overall it was a great experience and the food is delicious! Will definitely be back for more :)"}
{"text":"I've been to many crawfish restaurants in the states and this is the first time having it in Canada. I didn't know what to expect but I didn't care because its hard to find a restaurant like this in Canada. Captain's boil sauce is yummy however a little bit oily. Medium is a good spice. Cajun fries were the best fries I've ever had. Crawfish were the perfect size and boiled to perfection. We also ordered clams but one of the clams were closed so when I opened it... it was filled with mud. I tried telling the waitress that mud was inedible but she seemed like she didn't understand or didn't care... And usually in the states, the restaurants include potatoes and corn with 2 lbs of seafood order but its was a separate price and tiny which kinda set us off. Maybe I'll come back, but at a different location."}
{"text":"More like 3.5 stars ~  We made resos for a holiday evening and boy am I glad we did. The place was rammed - I mean line up going up the stairs and hovering over ppl eating kind of rammed. At the end of our meal the server was saying there was still a wait-list of 60 (!!) and it was already 930pm. But note they only take resos for groups of 8 or more so go at an off time if you don't have a big group or better yet, wait till the hype dies down - it's not thaaaat amazing.  The food was pretty good all around. We got captains boil seasoning in mild and holy mother garlic. It was delicious but we were vampire repellant for the next week. Seriously. The next day I had a few ppl tell me I stink.   Shrimp, mussels, corn, Cajun fries yummy. Lobster so-so and snow crab was not very meaty. Order rice to make into balls and dip it into the sauce in the bottom of the bags - delicious. They forgot the crab and it took like 30 minutes after we were done everything to finally get it after we inquired (and with the wrong seasoning) (and we were already full at this point).   They don't give enough extra gloves so you need to keep asking and they rarely top up water in the dinky glasses they provide so you need to keep hounding them cus that food makes you thirstyyyyy.   Aside from some flaws it was a very fun experience! Messy and loud and devour food with your hands! Not worth the hype for a 2 hour wait but ok if the line isn't crazy. Cost us $25pp and we were full (didn't order drinks tho). Extremely messy and smelly. Wear rags or make sure you wash your clothes asap or burn them. Shower a lot. Don't breath on ppl. Leave your jacket/scarf/purse in the car. Don't go on a first date within one month of coming here. You will stink for days. I am serious."}
{"text":"(3.5-stars for now because I've only been here once and it's not enough for me to say that it's the best. I do plan on returning and re-review this establishment!)  Got brought here for a surprise dinner and boy, was I surprised! Not only because I rarely get surprises...but also dining here with my almost-bare-hands!! Yup, do not expect any utensils here besides a pair of plastic gloves and a bib. Addition to that, everything is served in a plastic bag! Last thing, don't worry about having sauce all over your face because for 1) you don't have to worry about class; everyone will be eating out from a plastic bag with their hands and 2) the food's too yummy for you to even notice.  We ordered a pound each of the Clams with Garlic sauce, Shrimp with Captain Boil's sauce, Mussles with Cajun sauce and a side of Wings and Cajun Fries.  First off, the clams were my favourite! The sauce was laced with pieces of chopped garlic that some say that it adds a kick of spiciness to their tastebuds (as for me.. I did not taste the spice from the garlic pieces. I suppose, it hits everyone differently). This sauce is just perfect for any seafood!! Next, the shrimp! Most of you were probably wondering about what is in the house sauce and that is... *drum roll please* 3 of their sauces combined! Mix the garlic, lemon pepper and cajun sauce and there you have it, The Captain Boil's sauce. Pretty interesting, huh? Upon tasting it, it wasn't my cup of tea... 1) I cannot handle much heat and 2) I prefer a sauce that's not too \"musky\" if you know what I mean. For those of you that can handle heat, you have the option to one-, two- or three-level it up (i.e. mild, medium and fire). The mussles had a similar taste to the house sauce except it's a lot spicier (well for me at least, haha) with a whole lot of meat! These mussles were pretty decent in size I must say.  Alright, so as for the Wings and Cajun fries, they taste like the way they look. However, I do appreciate the light batter for the wings and how big the wings were. The fries could use more cajun seasoning and they could also balance out the fries with the wings as I felt that they were 'too' generous with the fries..  As you might all know that I'm really big on service. Let me tell you this: service here is exceptional! Very attentive, clear and our server was confident with all the items on the menu. Kind of disappointed that I did not get to try their crawfish since they were out however, I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"3.5/10 been wanting to come and try out this new joint in vaughan. We ordered 2 pounds of muscles 1 pound of clams 1 pound of snow crab w/corn and one side of Cajun fries. The sauce we decided on was the captain special sauce with the fire heat.  The sauce was super greasy and oily you could not taste any spice or seasoning. Not only that but we order fire and it wasn't even a bit spicy ! Most disappointing thing was the food came out super fast but was Luke warm and not hot in temperature which really tuned me off . Service from the staff was awsome and spot on. Just the food itself wasn't what it stood it too be."}
{"text":"Fun and delicious! The sauce is super tasty, and they don't over cook the seafood.  The mussels are my favorite. They are HUGE ones, and they're amazing."}
{"text":"Hard to get seating also the quality and quantity of food has decreased significantly."}
{"text":"The kitchen was a mess, completely forgot one of my order which is a main course shrimp in Cajun source. We waited for 45 mins and had to cancel the order. Would never come back to this restaurant, prefer the one in Richmond hill."}
{"text":"I thought it was average. This is the first time I've heard of this in Toronto, but I've been to one of these places in California. I thought that the one from California was better.  The food was okay, but I do wish there was more in the bag or it was a little cheaper cos it's really just sauce that they shake up in a bag with seafood.  Will come back to their other location though because I really liked the overall experience! Plus the food was okay."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of friends and not a single one of us left here unsatisfied. I wish we had one of these back home! The Captains boil sauce is absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"I've been here a bunch of times so there's nothing very surprising or new to me. The lobster's great! Mussels were okay. It's my friend's first time and she really enjoyed it. The taste was decent and service was good. The one thing that I did not like is their gloves are really thin... your hands are gonna get oily regardless. But overall I like this place."}
{"text":"This is my first time going to Captain's boil but have heard many things about it! Firstly, I will say... be prepared to get dirty! You have to peel and crack open shellfish on your own and they're soaked in sauce so there will be splashing and they're slippery suckers (a la Pretty Woman).   Then portions are really good! I got 1lb of mussels boil with the Captains boil broth which is a combination of all 3 flavours. It was really good, garlicky, with some lemon and tang. The mussels themselves were excellent, they were nice and meaty, not little ones! Mussels in general are easier to remove than shrimp or crab and I was feeling lazy. Recommend, esp if you are lazy and don't want to make a mess.  I also got the fried shrimp basket that comes with a heap of Cajun fries. This was really good too! The shrimp was juicy and meaty, not one of those skinny ones with a lot of batter. The batter to shrimp  ratio was good. Fries were delicious also and comes with a nice mayo-tartar-dill tasting dip and ketchup. This could be a meal all on it's own!  I also got the fried rice and was surprised that the portion size is very generous! Not dry and the scallops and shrimps have a strong presence. Not like other seafood fried rice where you have to dig for the occasional shrimp and scallop. Recommend!  My first visit was really enjoyable and the staff are relaxed and friendly. I would definitely come back and recommend others to give this place a try if you love seafood!"}
{"text":"Let me say the flavor of the food was amazing, but everything else was absolutely not up to par when it came to service.    First, by the time someone acknowledged us it was 15 mins after we were seated on a Friday night at 7pm and it's as if we were'nt there.  We then ordered our meals (4people) and this is where big surprises came.  We ordered 2 appetizers and 4 entries.  All the entries were served in plastic bags which was  a surprise and basically thrown in front of us to eat from the bags.  All the meals came at random times.  The staff said it's because it's cooked fresh to order and this is how they serve.  It took over 15 mins to get them to bring calamari sauce to our table then of course the calamari was cold    We then asked for a knife to cut the fish from the fish and chips order and the manager said they do not have utensil, but then a staff brought a knife.  My lobster entrée was served with a plastic fork which could not pull the meat out and I had to ask for a regular fork.  Another entree of mussels did not have meat in at least six of them and it took them awhile to bring a replacement order which of course was thrown in front of us.   Getting use to eating from plastic bags is an unusual concept, but this is how this chain operates.   The young staff were pleasant, but we felt the manager was extremely rude to us not and as soon as we asked for the bill, then the service was fast and pleasant.  Btw, they DO NOT do separate bills for both couples which I found unexceptable.   I personally would not go back to The Captains Boil specifically because of the service, but the food I must say was delicious."}
{"text":"Food was great !! I'm a seafood lover, will definitely come back. I came with a couple of friends and we ordered Lobsters, King Crab , Cajun Seafood Fried Rice and a pound of mussels all with the Captain's Boil. The seafood is highly recommended. Will definitely come back again :)"}
{"text":"My friend was raving about this place . I was so excited to finally try it out.  The place is fully packed by 6pm Sunday afternoon. We put our name down on wait list and was seated very fast. The waitress/hostess were very polite and attentive.   First and most important thing about this place I LOVE LOVE is Everything is cooked well done! or at least close to well done While still tender and flavorful! I HATE under cooked seafood! I do not know how many times I have been grossed out by raw certer slimy  calamaris, funky fishy tasting risotto(due to they tossing rice in too early), 50% cooked shrimps--which triggered me to develop shrimp allergy in my adult years! I don't know how restaurants in Toronto think making food tender requires them to be severly undercooked is good way to go???????? Also since things r cooked thru so even the table is so messy there isn't INVASIVE Raw seafood smell. Also raw seafood is very invasive to digestive system while boarder line non sanitary, that easily triggers food allergy.   We ordered 3lb of snow crab legs, 2 lb muscles, 2lb giant shrimps, fish n chips with Cajun fries, sweet potato fries, sweet corn with butter. The seasoning we picked Captain boil flavor.   Everything was very delicious, I have the best time! Snow crab were LARGE and meaty! Unlike the medium crab u get from Red Lobster, u gat a massive full sized snow crab. Because the crab is so big so its easy to work with , the meat is very easy to come off .I just snap the leg in half n the meat just slides out. I didn't even bother using the scissor till cutting the claws. The claws were huge too. If u are crab lovers, u will be fully satisfied. The cause is pure butter with seasoning, the captain boil one sauce seems to be garlic Cajun spicy mixture n it coats the meat so deliciously . $18.99 a lb is not bad price at all.   My bf had the best Cajun fries with flaky fish. The fries were soft n fluffy, coated in seasoning, and the fish was fresh.  I am NOT huge fan of huge frozen muscles. I like small fresh muscles. I had bad experience eating big muscles that were not cooked thru n fishy inside. I was surprised these muscles were well done however still tender and not fishy like the ones I have had.   I didn't get to eat the sweet corn, I was so fixiated in my crab legs, by the time I ate the whole half crab I was fully. But everyone was saying the buttered corn was so sweet n delicious.   we were making plan to come back later this week as we were eating. So def a place worth trying. And the thing is the seafood is very messy, seems would have be very fishy all around, however despite how much seafood around the whole place, the place is not so fishy, my none seafood eater bf was able to tallorate the smell n didn't seem to bother him at all when a  lot caucasion fellas who would high tailed at first sight of seafood. In the past I have had bad experience with crab legs at some restaurants when the crab wasn't fresh or they didn't clean up the crab well(if they didn't clean up the gunk build up on the shell) before cooking that the smell was too fishy n bothered me . This place the seafood (body)seem to be cleaned before they cooked them. I know restaurants suppose to use a brustle brush to brush off the gunk outside of their shells. They must hv been doing that or they receive shipments of crab that's pre cleaned n frozon.  Either way. I was impressed.   They have chicken wings, baked chicken breast n vegetables etc.on the menu for pl who don't eat seafood.  It's good to go as a group to share. make sure dress down in case shell fish flake off sauce on yr shirt/sleeves even tho everyone wears their store bibs :):)"}
{"text":"It was REALLY saucy. I love garlic so it was great for me...but the sauce really takes away from the seafood. You're basically just eating the sauce. The king crab was kind of a rip off for $36.xx and you only get one leg. The sauce didn't soak up into the shrimps enough. Clams and mussels were ok. Mussels were huge. Had the Dungeness crab with lime and pepper. The sauce was surprisingly better than I expected. Eating here is pretty messy but I guess it's fun with good friends and a few beers. However, I strongly believe I could do this better at home"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of cajun seafood and have had mixed to none existent opportunities to have it in Toronto. Captain's Boil does a good job of satisfying that urge and offers up boiled seafood in bags which you can add flavouring like garlic, cajun or all mixed together in a \"captain's boil\" which is highly recommended. Lock and load your gloves & bibs cause eating here is messy but good fun as long as you accept what it is and dive into the saucy goodness at the bottom of those bags. The menu isn't limited to seafood, they have awesome cajun fries, corn and plenty more in an ever growing menu. The cajun shrimp here is the best I've had in the city and your pretty much guaranteed to have a good time here unless you get sauce on a nice shirt you shouldn't have been wearing to eat here. Only real downside to the place is they can be a little inconsistent with the captain's boil sauce. Sometimes the mixture is cajun perfection, and sometimes its just red sauce that leaves you wondering what went wrong. The location on Yonge near Wesley is the weakest of all the locations I've been to. If its your first time going try to avoid that specific location as they are stingy on the sauce and their proportions on the sauce mixes are a far cry from the other locations."}
{"text":"3 stars for now based on my recent experience.  Came here on a Friday night with my bf and the place was jam packed. I tried to make a reservation earlier but unfortunately they don't take reservations unless you're a group of 6+. Upon entering, someone greeted me, said the wait for two people was 45 minutes and then ran off. She did not take my name?... Waiting 15-20 minutes, we decided to get take out instead because we really wanted to try this place out. We originally wanted the crawfish but that was unavailable so we opted for the mussels and shrimp cajun style and cajun fries. I ordered non-spicy and I'm not even lying it was hella spicy. I can handle heat but this was just burning my mouth.   The layout of this place is bizarre. You have very little seating (2 floors) and there are people/servers running back and forth in a narrow hallway. There's also no where to sit if you're waiting for a table."}
{"text":"Captain's boil has really made it's mark into Toronto's \"it\" spot with their casual dining experience. Unlike most seafood places that makes an upscale experience, you get to indulge with your hands at the Captain's. The whole experience they don't give you a plate, everything is served in plastic bags.   Be ready to spend quite a bit of dough. They charge the food by pound.. and you wont be satisfied with just a pound of one item. Then you choose what sauce they smother your food in. Definitely try the Captain's Boil sauce! Also, spoil yourself and get the king crab. It's a hefty 40$/pound. But its definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Despite all the hype, Captain's Boil still exceeded my expectations. The concept is quite simple, yet complex at the same time. The sauce is one of a kind. I thought it would be your normal Cajun flavour (like Bubba Gump's) but it wasn't. I would highly recommend both the shrimp and the mussells. Some of the other items might be too pricey though."}
{"text":"2.5 Star for lunch Experience which offers Chicken/Fish Teriyaki with a side of seafood for $10.95  We were here on Saturday around 2:00 pm for a late lunch. The restaurant was not too busy and we were seated promptly and was given a cup of room temperature water in plastic cup. (suggestion: maybe some iced water would be better?)  Chicken Teriyaki with Captain Boil Sauce Medium Spicy  - The chicken was tender and flavourful - The hot plate was sizzling hot when served   Fish Teriyaki with Lemon Garlic Sauce Fire Spicy - The hot plate was warm with no sizzle at all!  - The fish was mushy and more batter than fish - The sauce was lurk warm and the seafood was not really cooked through, especially for the clams and mussels which has this mushy texture  The 2 craw fish on each of the order were probably the worse. The tail meat was tasteless and mushy. We ended up just have one bite and left the rest untouched.  Maybe the side seafood would have tasted better if it was served/prepared in one of the bags instead of just putting them on the hot plate and served with sauce on top? At least they would be hot instead of warm?  I would not recommend the hot plate special! Serving those the way it was really not really represent the real seafood boil experience! Ordering something from the actual menu probably would be the best bet.  My first ever Captain Boil's experience was a disappointment. Maybe I should not have order those specials.."}
{"text":"Ate there during the first weekend of opening and the staff and I believe the hostess who was the owner didn't notify us that there was no crawfish. Crazy!! Very disappointing! So we ordered everything else on the menu and the sauce wasn't flavourful. If you've had real crawfish at a real crawfish place then you would know this place is really hyped."}
{"text":"I have no idea why these places are popping up everywhere. It's truly a gimmick. No crawfish? What's the point?! My friends and I have been to a Captain's Boil location a couple times and they never have it. What is the point?!  Had the mussels, shrimp, clams, crab here and the shrimp was by far the best protein. The sides were good though."}
{"text":"If you have a craving for seafood then this is your place! I had a fun experience with a group here on the weekend; we ordered a variety of seafood, which comes to you in bags piping hot. You order a few sets of sides to go with the meal (the fried rice and the fries were tasty companions) and then just spend the rest of your time prying delicious seafood out of exoskeletons - all while wearing a bib and plastic gloves. What's not to like?  Everything came out super fast. Also, they have sake which was unexpected but welcome. We shared shrimp and lobster with the spicy Captain's Boil spice rub and I was quite happy with both. The shrimp were sweet and fresh, and the lobster provided lots of meat and was perfectly cooked. I heard that the crawfish weren't that great from a meat-to-effort ratio perspective but everyone was generally happy with their choices. If you are just looking for some well-cooked seafood this is easily as good if not better than ordering the same at a nice restaurant, and you'll get much more.  The ambiance is one that makes you feel okay wearing a bib and plastic gloves - nothing fancy about this place but that's not why you're here. This is about one thing: fresh seafood in large quantities. Do not bring people here who aren't also seafood nuts, or who are vegetarian - they'll manage with a few non-seafood options but it really isn't gonna be that great for them.   In conclusion, this is certainly worth the visit if you are a sea-fiend in need of a fix!"}
{"text":"fatasitic seafood lunch. love the shrimps with captain boil sauce. We chose the medium"}
{"text":"This place is alright. The food is decently priced and you get a lot of seafood for a good price. The spicy flavor was VERY spicy for me, so beware of that. If you order the fries they give you a HUGE serving. The fries taste really good if you dip them in your sauce. My one negative comment is that I wish they had more flavour options. They only have 2-4 choices for the sauces and if you want a non-spicy option you are left with very limited choices"}
{"text":"This place is not for the faint of heart! There is a LOT of mess, oil, garlic, FUN and YUMMYNESS to be had.  It's a fabulous place to go and have a wonderful evening.  It's not a typical restaurant, and it's quite an experience.   It can be a little costly, but seafood normally is - so it isn't shocking or out of the norm for those who enjoy going to seafood restaurants.  I had dinner with my SO and we shared 5 lbs - yes - that's a lot (we had leftovers). 2 lbs of mussels, 1 lb of crab, 1 lb of crawfish, and 1 lb of shrimp.   I think it's a unique and fun experience since you get to eat with your hands, but yes - there are lots of oils, but its flavourful, and not overwhelming as others say.  Its great because everything is made to order, so if you order a few things, and mid meal you feel like you want more, you can let your server know you'd like to order more.   Service can be a little slow (I also found this) because the place can be busy on a Friday/Saturday evening."}
{"text":"If you don't want to read this entire critique, I would recommend going to the downtown location on Yonge between College and Wellesley. The service there is way better and quality of food is better as well.    I've been to this York Mills location 3 times. The first couple times were in the summer of 2016, and I would have given it 4 stars. However, I just went on Feb 14, 2018 and I must say, it was nothing like how I remembered it.   I didn't recognize any of the servers on my most recent visit, and I noticed that the quality of service has worsened tremendously. Our server was not professional and didn't seem to care much about his job.   We tried to order a pitcher of Canadian and our server had no idea what we were talking about--even though it was clearly an option on the menu. His reasoning behind his confusion was, and I quote, \"Sorry, I didn't know what you were talking about because I don't drink alcohol\". Unfortunately, I don't consider that a valid reason to not know the menu.   When the pitcher arrived, the waitress said that it was a pitcher of Sapporo. When stating that we had ordered Canadian, she then said - in an unfriendly manner - that they only had Sapporo. Normally I would just roll with it, but as Sapporo is a premium beer, it is more expensive. We expressed that we weren't interested in paying more, and as a result, the waitress rudely said that we could cancel the order. There was no apology for the misunderstanding and the waitress quickly took the pitcher back to the kitchen and began aggressively yelling in a different language. This wouldn't have been an issue except we were literally seated 3 feet from the kitchen and could hear it all.  Fast forward to when we were paying for the bill, we noticed that the pitcher was still being charged. Thankfully, we were able to get it straightened out.  Another minor issue was when we weren't given the small bowls with plastic spoons when our seafood fried rice arrived. Normally I would let something that small slide, but given the attitude which had been displayed by our servers throughout this experience, it really didn't help their cause.  I understand that it was a busy night, but it wouldn't kill that waitress to smile every once in a while. Additionally, I think it is appropriate for servers to know which beers they have on tap, the difference between domestic and premium, and even basic etiquette and professionalism when taking orders. I would recommend that our server takes 15 minutes out of his day to read up on the alcoholic options his restaurant provides. We could have avoided being charged for a premium beer that we didn't even order, and it is useful knowledge to have in his line of work."}
{"text":"Went with my family a couple of weeks ago and OH MY GOODNESS is this one of the most unique restaurants I have ever been to (and trust me, I've been to unique ones). Almost like a unicorn I though the concept was imaginary or some lies that my friends have told me, but when I saw the adorable bibs, gloves and bags of food I knew I was in for a treat. Since it is me, I ordered 2lbs of food which consisted of 1 pound of clams and 1 pound of shrimp. Even though I have a weak tolerance to spice, I decided to try their famous spice and sauce they usually slather on their food. The sauce was delicious, with a variety of flavours included in the rich seafood.   If you are a neat freak, this is not the restaurant for you. If you have ever wanted to eat with your hands and be messy in public without the guilt, GO HERE! Worth going to over, and over, and over again.  5 burps out of 5."}
{"text":"I had never heard of this place before but my friend recommended it and I am glad she did. However, the experience at first wasn't great as the hostess informed us (on a Saturday night) that we may need to wait for 2.5 hours.  1.5 hours later we ended up calling them (they do take your name and cell phone number so they can text you) and luckily most of the people ahead of us did not want to wait.   I have never heard of seafood boil before and it was definitely a new experience. The food came fairly quickly and the staff were quite efficient despite having many clients.   Tried 2 flavours of shrimp, crawfish, Cajun fries and mussels. The crawfish and mussels are my top 2 so far that I have tried.   Recommended"}
{"text":"It's really good,  the portion  of the lobster is about 1 kg. However the king crab are bit lest and not fresh ! I will come again , but i wouldn't order the king carb any more"}
{"text":"Yummy food at a great price -- can't really ask for more! I've been 3 times and will keep coming back. We've had the crayfish, shrimp, crablegs, mussels and claims. Everything is delicious and we love the \"captain's boil\" sauce which is a mix of all 3 of their sauces. Great for groups and adventurous eaters who don't mind getting a little messy. Note that they only take reservations for groups larger than 6. If you're less than 6, expect a wait."}
{"text":"I want to give this place 3.5 stars,  but can't seem to so I am rounding up.   I went to my first seafood boil in California 5 years ago so I was pleasantly surprised to see we got a Seafood Boil resto in Toronto finally.   Note: this is seafood boil,  its not to be meant fancy so leave your pretentious attitude at the door and don't wear your Sunday best.  You eat with your hands,  its messy, but so is life sometimes, so learn to love it and you'll enjoy yourself.   We went to the Yonge and Finch location on Jan 21, 2016 around 7:45 and we were a party of 3. We didnt have to wait even the main floor was full.  We were led to the small dining area in the basement and the hostess also informed us there was seating area upstairs above the main/ground floor which explained the stairs leading upwards to the left of the entrance.    The server was friendly and all off the staff that we saw seemed to be university/college aged kids.  They were polite but a little inexperienced but happily provided us with more gloves and drink refills. They did keep forgetting our corn which we were told takes the longest to cook and we got that towards the end of our meal when we ordered an addional pound of snowcrab.   The food itself was great.  We had lobster,  clams,  and lots of delicate,  sweet snowcrab and everything was fresh.    For sides we chose cajun fries and sweet potatoes fries and corn. Though everyone (all other reviews) seems to be facinated with anything cajun (because we are in the Great White North), skip the cajun fries.  They're just seasoned frozen fries.  The real standout are the sweet potato fries,  which are probably frozen too but they are CRISPY.  Any sweet potato lover knows you always run the risk of getting soggy sweet potato fries. Whatever they are doing to the sweet potato fries,  works and they are one of the best servings of sweet potato fries we had ever had. The corn was 1/3 of a cob for $1  Seemed a little expensive for 1.5 inches of corn on the cob.  I would skip this in the future.  We dipped our fries and corn in the sauce at the bottom of the bags like true fat kids in training. Just do it, its ok.  Unless you're eating like this every day of your life. Then maybe don't.   As for flavours,  my favourite was the Captain's Boil which is a mix of all the other ones. Be stingy with you heat selection as it tends to build. You might be thinking \"it's mild.  Mild.  Mild\"  Then the heat hits you and you're gulping down your drink to put out the fire in your mouth.   We had a great meal,  the atmosphere was casual as we wanted and the food was great.  We definitely will be back here in the near future we hope, but see its pretty busy because its the first Seafood Boil place in Toronto and it just opened up a while ago."}
{"text":"Funny, I live about 5 minutes from TCB and I just discovered the place today. I usually go to the group of restaurants that are north of Hwy 7 on E. Beaver Creek.  My wife and I each ordered a King Crab leg @ $49.00 each. Plus, the potatoes and corn.  It wasn't cheap but the food was excellent. My wife likes her food super spicy and she was not disappointed. She asked for Fire plus! So that's 4 peppers instead of just 3!  I asked for Fire and that's what I got.  However, the food wasn't just hot, it was also flavorful.  This place was also generous with the garlic and my wife fell in love with the chef!  I think that the sauces were excellent, I had the Captain's Boil and my wife had the Cajun.  I also had 6 Oysters on the half shell as an appetizer.  The oysters were from the west coat and were quite decent.  Initially, I was shocked when the main courses came in a plastic bag and we were told that there are no plates and we eat with our hands.  (I right away knew that this wasn't Alo).  Mind you, it's pretty easy to get used to eating with your hands.  Those bibs that they gave us certainly came in useful.  The scissors that they provided to cut the crab were ingenious.  These scissors were specifically designed to cut large seafood legs.  The cracker was built into the scissor.  It took no time at all to get to the meat.Overall, the Service was good. The Restaurant decor was nice and the Bathrooms were clean and modern.  Nothing to complain about.  The meal was pricey but we ordered the most expensive items on the menu.  You get what you pay for.  The sauces really distinguished this place from other seafood restaurants. Way more interesting than only getting melted butter.  I will recommend this place to friends and hope to come back soon."}
{"text":"My first (and probably only) experience of Captain's Boil was definitely disappointing. I came here for my birthday with 11 other friends, expecting a great time while trying something messy and new. Instead, all we thought while leaving was that we overpaid for an over-hyped meal of mediocre food.  Pros: you get cute bibs and the concept of bagged seafood in a spicey, garlicky sauce is enticing.  Cons: pretty much everything else...  They have several different selections of seafood for you to choose, plus sides for extra. You get to choose a sauce (Captain's Boil is the obvious choice, which is a sort of chili oil/garlic combination) as well as heat level. It skews high, so if you choose \"Fire\" make sure you're up for it!!  Crawfish (seasonal price, around $17 at the time): these were absolutely tiny and had almost no meat - skip this one unless you like to eat shells only.  Dungeness Crab (seasonal price, around $40 at the time): we didn't even try this because of the outrageous price...they may have upped the price since opening on this item. Lobster (around $30 each): this was probably the best item on the menu, I enjoyed my lobster which was meaty and the Captain's Boil sauce really enhanced the flavour Mussels (around $12): we asked the waitress if these were frozen - and if so, we'd get the clams instead. She gave us clams. Clams (around $12): nothing really special but pretty decent with the sauce. Shrimp (around $12): these were very over-cooked and many of the shrimp felt mushy, which is probably a sign that they weren't fresh. Skip these. King Crab (around $40): didn't get a chance to try.  The best food items were the corn and cajun fries, which is pretty sad for a seafood restaurant.  Service was also pretty terrible - one of my friends didn't get her food until we were all pretty much done. They said they cook everything in batches so her order was 30 mins later than all of ours. That's not really our problem is it? One waitress got really flustered by this situation and started bitching to another waitress about it. While it was clear she was passionate, that's also not a very professional way to behave on the job...  At the end they comp'd my friend's seafood (not even her whole meal, just the crawfish) but at that point she was already so disgruntled that she didn't even end up eating anything. Unhappy friends is definitely NOT what I wanted for my birthday.  Also, the waiting area is extremely tiny and you feel like you're in everyone's way all the time. Given it's winter, we had to cram inside but it was so uncomfortable.  Perhaps just growing pains, but this is one of those \"tried it, never again\" restaurants for me."}
{"text":"Came with a friend. Depending on the time if day arrive early and be prepared to wait for a table as this reaturant is popular and there is limited seating.    We ordered a pound of shrimp, mussels, and a lobster all with different seasonings. We also got a side of Cajun fries. Quick service, yummy food.   Definitely a place where you're paying for the experience!  Eating with your hands and wearing a bib!  Pricey for those who are on a budget but well worth it every once in a while."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place after a few of my friends recommended it and all I can say is WOW. If you are looking for a fun experience and some really tasty food, I definitely recommend this place.  We arrived around 6 PM on a Sunday evening. The restaurant was about 1/2 full. We were greeted and seated right away. My boyfriend and I had never attended before so our server explained the menu and process to us and took our drink order. The restaurant was tastefully decorated, everything was clean and tidy. They call the servers \"pirates\" which I think was playful and fun.  The menus were very easy to understand, giving you a three step process of choosing your seafood. The seafood is seasonal, so some of the options may not always be available. They also have a chicken option if you don't like seafood. Then you choose your sauce and then your spice level.  I ordered the lobster with garlic sauce and no spice. My boyfriend ordered the chicken with the captains boil sauce and our friend ordered snow crab legs with the captains boil sauce. She also ordered oysters, and my boyfriend and I got garlic bread.  The seafood was to die for. The sauce was amazing. The lobster and crab were cooked perfectly. My boyfriends chicken was delicious.  When you eat, you do not get a plate. The food comes in a bag with what sauce you ordered, you get a pair of plastic gloves, a bib and pair of nut crackers and you go to town. It was a really different experience.  After you are finished, you throw all your left overs in a can on the table. There is a sink station in the middle of the restaurant where you can go wash your hands off if you got dirty, which you will.  All in all, I had a very positive experience.  For 5 oysters, garlic bread, three meals, 5 beers and dessert our total came to 145.00.  The service was great, the food was great. We will defiantly be returning."}
{"text":"The sauce is delicious (we got the signature) the fries were also great. I am still fighting garlic breath hours later due to raw garlic in the sauce but, it was worth it because I have a vacation tomorrow anyways ;)  As for the seafood... The lobster and king crab was okay albeit overpriced but, the shrimp had that mushy texture that no longer fresh shrimp has.  I also don't like the gloves, they get stuck in your mouth as you try to eat because they're so baggy and that in turn gets into the food... They pretty much seeped through after the first couple of shrimp anyways.  Perhaps a giant fingerbowl and shell bucket would've been better.  I would go again, yes because it's so close but, I'd get my own bag which entails a limited option and I would get the side of Cajun fries for sure."}
{"text":"So I've been anxious to come to this place for few months now since I am a big fan of crawfish. That's my destination whenever I go to California or in States.  Me and my gf ordered 4 lbs of Crawfish, 1b of mussels, clams and shrimps.  Tried two flavours, garlic butter and Captian's boils seasoning.  I was very impressed with the bold taste and seafoods were quite fresh. Our spice level was medium and was right on. (May be too spicy for those don't eat hot stuff).  Crawfish was $16.95/lbs which was little pricey for those who don't eat (since not much meat) but as for us, it cured the crave!!  We liked the deco, and service was good.  Came on Tuesday night at 7pm and was already line up so expect for waiting time.  Will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Came here after hearing about the hype about the North York location. There was 10% off special for their grand opening.   We ended up getting a few pounds of mussels, clams, shrimp, and added some sausages and corn to some of the bags. We had a variety of sauces including captain's boil, Cajun, and garlic.   The seafood absorbed the flavour of the sauces and was quite delicious. This was one of the most satisfying seafood meals we've had in Toronto. Highly recommended, but probably not for a first date."}
{"text":"It was a cool place & concept to try out due to the massive attention it got through social media.  The area has limited parking and the restaurant is pretty small so don't be surprised if you end up waiting for a table as it does get busy.  The waiters are nice and super quick to getting you the menu items you've ordered.    This is how you order: you choose the type of catch you'd like (Ex: crawfish, lobster, crab, shrimp, etc...) - then you choose the type of flavour/seasoning (cajun, garlic sauce, lemon pepper) and then how spicy you'd like it.  I was initially going to get the crawfish and lobster but unfortunately they had run out which was a downer because it was only 13:00. I then proceeded to get the shrimp and crab with the Captain's Boil seasoning with mild heat and it was awesome!  You get super messy and that is why you get your own bib and gloves.  Sauce everywhere! Definitely try this chain out and hopefully they have all menu items available."}
{"text":"The food was great.fast service and friendly staff.i highly recommend trying this different experience for seafood.will be hoing back again and will be spreading the word about this spot.5 stars for sure."}
{"text":"Pretty good food, very similar to the Boiling Crab in the states. The price is quite high for what you get, but it's an unique experience and quite fun to grub with your friends. I would come back,  but only when the hype dies out. We waited almost 2 hours in line? Thankfully Yonge Street has many attractions to offer.   Expensive, but decent seafood and fun way to eat."}
{"text":"Had shrimps and clams and they both taste bad. They didn't even taste fresh. The restaurant should improve the quality of the ingredients otherwise they taste like they have been stored there since Ice Age!"}
{"text":"I had a sudden crave for Captain's Boil, and decided to give this location a try. I went with my family and friends on a busy Friday night. I think this is the biggest location in Toronto, and I believe it has a capacity of 100+ seats. They also have a big party room that can hold at least 30 people. I think it would be good for private company events/ birthday party. The good part is they do take reservation for weekends, and have a huge parking lot.  Service for this location was great, but I think they might be a little under staff in a restaurant this big. I saw all the staffs running around like crazy, but everyone was attentive and helpful. One good thing is that they kept walking around and asking everyone if they are good with everything, while refilling their water. Eating this food got me really thirsty especially, with the garlic sauce it was quite salty. Prepare to drink lots of water.   I acted like it was my first time eating at Captain's Boil, and I asked the server to explain everything to me. He took us through step by step from choosing our catch to choosing our flavour and even clearly explain the different level of heat. He also made very useful recommendations such as getting the French fries extra crispy, and dip it in the Captain's Boil sauce. He was right about that and it was very delicious (highly recommended). In the end, I ordered the Captains Boil Lobster, Garlic Sauce Shrimp and Lemon Pepper Mussel. The flavour was very good and consistent compared to the first time I had Captain's Boil.  The only downside from this restaurant is they do not have mixed drinks. I really wanted some Mojito to enjoy the tasty seafood. However, my overall experience at this location was excellent, I will be back and also recommending people to come here. I am also looking forward to try other locations in Toronto.   Service: 5/5 Environment: 5/5 Drinks: 4/5 Food: 5/5  Overall: 4.5/5"}
{"text":"Good food and service. Abit pricey but I'll still come back . Nice decor and very clean."}
{"text":"The competition for seafood boils is heating up near Vaughan Mills, first with the opening of Boiling Harbour and now with Captain's Boil. Captain's Boil is located next to Yang's Teppanyaki, for those like me who circle around trying to find this place.  I ordered the shrimp and the mussels in garlic sauce. It didn't take too long for the piping hot food to arrive. Both the shrimp and the mussels were tasty, pretty much the same size as at Boiling Harbour. However, I liked the flavor of the sauce more at the Captain's Boil. It's less oily. There is definitely less sauce here than at Boiling Harbour, which is great if you don't want to drench your gloves in the sauce, but not great if you enjoy drinking the sauce. You're not provided with a bucket for shells, but asked to leave them on the table. I found that to be unpleasant.  The wait staff was super attentive. I was able to get water refills regularly. They kept asking if I needed anything and how things were going, to the point that a number of them asked one right after the other."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner.  They have seafood in bags with your choice of sauce.  I enjoyed the lemon pepper.   Nothing out of the ordinary.  Something to try at least once."}
{"text":"Decently long line on a Sunday and they don't accept reservations for parties under 8. Small wait area so expect that you might just have to wait outside, however they do have a good system where they will call/text you when your table is ready so you could just wander around until your table is ready.  The table is line with a thick white paper and there were bibs and gloves, which was smart because it gets really messy. I wish the gloves were slightly thicker or better because mine kept ripping when it would get caught on a sharp edge of shrimp shell or other such things which meant my hands did get a little messy but at least it's better than going bare handed.  There was no crawfish, which I was informed about when I had originally called in seeing if I could book a reservation, however we opted for the clams, mussels, and shrimps with a side of cajun fries. We tried three different sauces, captains, cajun, and lemon pepper. Definitely out of all three captains was the best sauce. Lemon pepper tastes a little weird, I didn't like it. It has an almost plastic-y taste. Cajun was pretty good though, I might opt for mild next time, my mouth was on fire. A good fire. The seafood itself was very tender and well cooked. The cajun fries were delicious but to be honest, the spice level made it hard to taste anything after eating the seafood xD.  After dinner I've never food coma'd so hard in my life. The copious amounts of butter make it hard to function afterwards and I smelt like garlic and butter and spices for a long while after. Even brushing your teeth won't help.  Overall pretty good considering there isn't anything like it around Toronto that I know of."}
{"text":"i think this place might be infested with COCKROACHES! we ordered fries with the bag of seafoods that we ordered alongside. There was something black but i just thought it was a burnt fry from the corner of my eye until i picked it up and it definitely didn't feel like a fry. I called the server over and showed it to him. He said he would be right back as he examined it. He came out of the kitchen saying it was a burt potato skin! I argued with him and he then went back into the kitchen and came out with an actual burnt potato skin and he looked down on me like i was an idiot who has never seen a potato skin before.   I am never going back. Worst experience ever. The cockroach was huge and they had the decency to tell me it was a potato skin... ridiculous!"}
{"text":"Love the food we got 4 pounds of shrimp captain style with a few Saporas hit the spot."}
{"text":"Where has this place been all my life, I think I'm in love. I was recently brought to the Boil by my brother who wasn't an avid seafood person before, until he came here. I, on the other hand, am a huge seafood lover so this was right up my alley. It's basically Cajun meets Asian flare. We came during at lunch durning the weekday, so it wasn't busy at all. The menu is pretty simple and straight forward. You pick your seafood, you pick your sauce and you pick your spice level, done! It seems like everything is done family style so it would be awesome to come with a bigger group. You get a bib and a pair of gloves and the whole thing is supposed to be MESSY! All the seafood is served in bags where you can also throw in some extra stuff if you like (potatoes, corn, whatever your heart desires) and they have an abidance of side dishes too.   They have one lunch special which is basically like a mini sampler of most of their seafood. For $11, you get crawfish, mussels, clams and shrimp (2 of each), side rice and a choice of either fish or chicken teriyaki. My brother and I also decided to share the king crab legs. For sauces, I HIGHYL recommend you get the Captain's Boil, which is a mixture of their 3 other sauces. I choose the medium spice level, which I thought had a perfect kick and was not overwhelming at all. My brother can't handle spice at all, but he was able to do mild. Everything was delicious and super messy. I absolutely loved the mussels and wish I had more.   Despite having gloves, it's possible to still get a little messy and I like that they have a hand washing station to clean yourself up afterwards. Service was great and I would definitely return if I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"Ive come to this restaurant only a couple times, Food taste nice. Today I had an order of mussels, and 30 minutes after i was throwing up and had terrible nausea. Never again. Oysters are also WAY too overpriced $35 for 12 oysters Ridiculous  Atleast have good quality oysters for that price."}
{"text":"What to try??  The lobster special! The garlic bread dipped in their captain boil sauce!  I came here for the grand opening. They opened for a month already and they had the lobster special for the whole month! Basically a whole lobster for ~$16 marinated in any of the sauces they have. What a steal!  I thought the restaurant was relatively clean and the restaurant was spacious. We ordered clams, shrimp, and mussels as well. The service was relatively quick and the waiter who served us was also very nice in explaining the menu.   The food was fresh and the taste was there but sometimes the captains boil sauce can be overpowering for some people because it's basically all their sauces mixed together. If you want to tone it down a notch, I'd say Cajun sauce is the other choice to go for. The lemon is also a very classic sauce and if you like garlic, the garlic is definitely very garlicky.   All the food is priced by weight so I'd say rule of thumb, one pound is good for 2 ppl. You can also throw in some sides like corn or okra or fries that you can balance your seafood heavy meal.   Last tip?  Follow them (the Oakville location) on Facebook and instagram to get the latest promos and specials. The lobster deal is definitely worth it and only come once in a while. You don't want to miss out some great deals at this restaurant since we all know eating seafood at regular price can definitely add up!"}
{"text":"If I could give it a 0 Star, I would. Terrible service, terribly run place. Unorganized waiters, flavour tastes watered down compared to other locations. Took 15 minutes just to order. Been here before when it was under a different owner and it was great. You had your own server that was assigned to your table and you were greeted with a hostess at the front door. They seem to have changed owners recently and now this place is just like any other restaurant you find in a low-end plaza. I suggest going to a different location."}
{"text":"First timer! Great place service and food were exellent. A little messy but it's a broil all worth it !! Busy place but there is lots of seating if ur craving seafood this place beats Red Lobster hands down!!"}
{"text":"Great experience I will definitely go back. The concept is amazing. 8 of us went out. Tried all sorts of different menu items, only downfall, our reservation was for 8 n we were seated at 9:00. But it was worth the wait."}
{"text":"Great food! A bit of a messy eating experience but really enjoyable when going with a group. We got a mix of different items on the menu, the spicy cajun shrimp was delicious! The lemon pepper flavor was good too.   We found the service to be pretty good as well. It's a different experience so worth trying!"}
{"text":"Okay, it was Friday after shopping at Vaughan Mills. We crossed the next plaza and went here. We liked  the menu!  Got to try the sizzling plate with crawfish, mussels, rice teriyaki, fish, clams with Captain's Boil sauce. We also ordered a pound of shrimps, fish and chips and chicken wings. I loved the sizzling plate!  Why only 4 stars?  Can't complain about service. Staffs are friendly. One star less for slippery floors!  It was like a skating rink. I got nervous with my daughter carrying her baby. Kept telling her to be careful. I had to hold onto the chairs on the way to the washroom. Only to find the women's washroom was dirty. Hope they will do something about cleaning this place. Most specially the slippery floors."}
{"text":"Went to the new Mississauga location and service....needs some work. Manager or Supervisor was friendly and greeted us at the door and told us at that it would be a 5 min for a table of 3 and he'll get us when our table was ready. We sat and waited at the door for 20 min before I got up to inquire how much longer it would be just to find out that our table has been ready just no one came to get us or let us know. Food arrived and we didnt have bibs and gloves to eat with. went the whole meal without a bucket to put our crab and shrimp shells in. even though we asked twice. and people who came before AND after us recieved one, I honeslty think they forgot or just didnt care. it was half price wine night me and my mom shared a bottle and a 1/2( a bottle and a 1/2 is 42oz =2 9.3oz glasses each ) over the coarse of 2 hours. once again i dont think they realised that it was only 2 glasses each I think they just panicked when the second bottle was ordered because they then proceeded to escort us out the door to make sure we werent driving. (we were ubering btw and told them that twice). We get its a new restaurant and theyre still trying to fine toon things and be cautious but you can tell that everyone there is fairly new to the industry."}
{"text":"Very similar to LA BOIL just down the street. This one have the look of a more upscale place. They had a Canada day promotion which gave each guest a free pound of shrimp, mussels, or clams (pretty sweet deal). A group of 8 of us ordered a lobster, 2 dungenous crabs, and 2 king crab legs, in addition to our freebies and a few sides. Food came very quickly as soon as each order was ready. We had the server visiting out table consistently for 10 minutes dropping off bags of shellfish.   Unfortunately where this loses stars is for the pricing. With the lobster, king crab, snow crab, and dungenous crabs all listed at market price, expect to spend 35-45 dollars per item. With the free promotion we had just enough food that almost everyone was satisfying and the bill still came to about 25 per person. If we had to pay for the items in the promotion, it would have been north of 40 per person. I couldn't help but think there were plenty of options within a stone's throw from Captain's Boil where 40 would get you a much more complete and satisfying meal. This place is definitely a novelty, and I'm sure there will attract a number of first time customers. I think the majority of those first time customers won't be converted to frequent guests."}
{"text":"I'm a little bit conflicted about this place! I came here for a friend's birthday, and I really enjoyed myself. The food was decent, but the experience was what really knocked it out of the ball park for me. Something about eating with your hands is just so much fun. I don't understand why people are saying it's primal because I still eat with my hands all the time, haha.   I got a pound of shrimp with the Captain's Boil sauce in medium heat. It wasn't that spicy in my opinion, so if I decide to visit again, I'd definitely opt for the fire heat. Like other reviews have said, the sauce can get a bit repetitive after a while. I did get a good amount of shrimp for my money though, much more than I expected. I ordered a small side of wings with it (since I'm not a huge seafood fan). The wings were alright, but the ketchup was kinda overly sweet and watery. It wasn't Heinz, but I'm not going to be super picky over ketchup.  One of my friends had ordered the fried shrimp basket (came with Cajun fries), so I used their tartar sauce for the wings to switch things up. The fried shrimp was very good, but I could see why people said the Cajun fries were overly salty. The spices just aren't evenly distributed.  Two of my friends weren't fans of seafood, so if you're coming along with a group and you're like them, then there are other options. However, these options can be quite limited (basically just chicken). I found the chicken to be quite boring in comparison to the seafood, because the sauce just didn't mesh well with it. It... tasted wrong for lack of a better phrase. The lotus root my friend also purchased was good though. A bit thickly cut, but not too much stringiness.  It would be good to come in groups, because you're able to try most of their menu that way. Be warned that it can get busy very fast, so make a reservation if possible.   Service was very lovely. Our waitress came by multiple times to ask how we were doing and to refill our water cups without prompt.   A concern that I had was how much plastic was being used (the tablecloth, the bags, the gloves, etc.) and thrown out. I understand the hype about this place is eating out of bags, but I wish there was a more environmentally friendly way to go about it.   Overall, this is a scattered review (forgive me, it's 3AM). The Captain's Boil is a fun place to eat and definitely an experience to try out if you have the time and money. I don't know if it'd become a regular joint for me, but I wouldn't be opposed to returning"}
{"text":"DE-LI-CIOUS. The boils are very very good. When first going you need to \"book\" a table which basically mean putting your name and number on a list for them to contact you later in the evening. We had a table of 2 and a wait of 30 minutes for our table   Once called and seated we ordered the mussels, the seafood fried rice and the fish and chips. They gave us bibs, gloves and cups of water. A cute little tidbit is that there are different bibs for boys or girls!   The mussels came first, and these come with the option of 3 different sauces: Cajun, lemon, and garlic. You can choose to mix them all creating the captains sauce. I definitely recommend this sauce! The mussels were perfectly cooked and smothered in the Delicious sauce. The seafood fried rice is a little spicy but the seafood in it is cooked perfectly, not rubbery or raw! The fish and chips though are lackluster in comparison to everything else, however smother that in the captains sauce leftover and your meal has improved!   The only reason I have taken off 1 star is that the service could do with some improvement. Because it is so busy it's hard to grab a servers attention. The tables are quite small and are usually still covered in the previous persons meal before the server can clean it up. Hence there's a secondary wait time to simply sit down at your table.   All in all, we paid $30-$40 for our meal and we left very satisfied."}
{"text":"Captains Boil offers top notch seasoned sauces with their seafood choices.  If you havent been to captains boil yet, youre definitely missing out! Captains boil takes on the Louisianna style seafood boil, where you choose your choice of seafood (crawfish, shrimp, lobster, crab legs, clams and mussels) choose your sauce and sides. It is then bag boiled so that all the flavours are infused within the seafood. Don't forget to order the Cajun fries!!.  My usual order is snow crab legs, 1lb of crawfish and cajun fries!! I usually dip my fries in the cajun sauce!"}
{"text":"The sauce were ok, nothing to shout about. The mussels were bad, but my friends said they loved it, so maybe it's personal preference. Fries were highly overpriced eventhough it tasted like supermarket ones. Worst part of the night is the oysters. Oysters were served with this small ass lime, which did nothing to hide the sandy, slimy taste of the oyster.  The only good part is their service. Our waitress was very friendly and helpful.  Overall, wouldn't pay another visit."}
{"text":"Go here if you want crappy ass customer service and seafood that'll satisfy your craving.  Been to this location a handful of times because the seafood always hits the spot for me. Every time I've gone the service just gets worse and worse and continuously turns me off from going back again. I have one too many stories about their service (or lack of) but I'll keep this review short & sweet and not a long rant."}
{"text":"Came here specifically for the lobster because it was special price and really enjoyed the lobster and the sauce and okra!  I took two stars off because I think the service was very basic for a unique restaurant (eat with hands from a plastic bag). Its messy, but fun! So I would expect a bit more of a sense of humour or some sort of \"character\" from the waiters just to make this whole \"experience\" more interesting instead of just taking orders and bringing them to the table. I mean, even a simple \"hi how's your day\" small talk ya know? More of that southern homey feel is lacking...(but then I think they were all Chinese and ESL...)  Again, not complaining about the food. Sauce Tasted great. Size was inconsistent though. Other member of my fam was considerably larger and meatier than mine.   Will I come back? Hmm probably not unless the special price of lobster was the same $15.95...the original price is $41...not sure if I want to pay so much for just lobsters and with not even a single side dish included.  I would choose the Keg if so."}
{"text":"Tried out The Captain's Boil on Thursday.  Parking was a bit of an issue as it's mostly on-the-street parking and back of the restaurant parking.   It was a bit early for dinner but there was a few tables occupied at the restaurant.  We put on our bibs and they provided plastic gloves for you to wear if you want to eat with your seafood.    We ordered the following: 2 lbs of shrimp in Medium heat, Captain's Boil sauce, 1 lb of shrimp in Mild, Garlic Butter, 1 lb of clams in Mild Cajun Sauce, 2 bowls of steamed rice, 2 orders of corn and 2 orders of okra.  Bill came to $100 excl tips.  The shrimps came out and then the clams, then we had to wait for our rice and sides.  I wished they all came out together.  Also, I'm not sure why the wait staff do this but they curl back the plastic bags when they serve the food.  I would prefer to curl back my own plastic bag of food.  The sauce was good especially Captain's Boil, Medium with the Shrimp.  The only issue I have is that there should be more sauce 'cos I like to add the sauce to my rice.  The Cajun sauce with the clams has a more smoky spicy flavor and it was good, too.    It's bit pricey here but I can see this place being very busy.  Will I come back?  Sure, but not too soon 'cos it's expensive."}
{"text":"The wait is crazy and the people checking you in and have no idea what the are doing. However it's fun and the food is good. Shrimp, crawfish, mussels and clams are the way to go."}
{"text":"Always wanted to try this place out when they opened.  Can't say anything bad about the place other than I don't think it's great great value for your money but it's not too far from it. I know it sounds weird but it's super fun to eat with your hands!   The seafood, thank god, wasn't over cooked at all. All the sides were delish, from their okra to corn and fries.  Personally I'm not a big fan of crawfish but I can see why people like it. The crab was good, shrimp was good, pretty much everything was really decent.   If you want to have a whole new eating experience, this is the place to visit."}
{"text":"First time coming here and it won't be my last.  Service was amazing and the food was out of this world.  Loved eating with my hands and getting into my meal.  I ordered the lobster and was highly impressed.  Just a warning they do give you a bib but don't wear nice clothing.  We had it everywhere.  So good"}
{"text":"I wrote my review on tripadvisor, so i won't get into too much detail here.  They, too screwed up our reservation, but after expressing that this was unacceptable, they accommodated us for the right time.   The food was far from good. Way too much butter, I almost puked after dinner.   They screwed up all our orders, not the right sauce, didn't get corn etc.  And the food did not come all together, party of 12, 6 of us finished our food, and three still didn't get their food.  Manager was extremely unprofessional.  All Chinese workers...i'm Chinese, so with the service we received, I wasn't surprised why they spoke the way they did and dealt with the situation the way they did.   It was a bad experience not just the service, but the food, never again will we be returning to this place."}
{"text":"I think the real word has trickled out on this place--5 of us went on a Friday evening and we were one of only 2 occupied tables.  Utterly confusing ordering process, with 2 waiters and their manager talking over and correcting each other while explaining it all to us.  Mediocre food at best, overpriced, nice setting.  Loud Musak we had to ask 3 times to get reduced so we could hear anything said by others. Avoid anything with lobster (frozen, mushy, bland); fried rice with seafood was the high point--very tasty and large serving.   We won't be back, but maybe worth a visit by folks who've never had mud bugs or like eating with their hands....  Same food at the Yonge location, but for some reason it tasted better there.  Decent paced service at both."}
{"text":"Went back here. I always stand by the food, it's very good.   However this was the worst service I've ever had.  I had made a reservation, upon arriving the server told me she would seat me in the VIP room because there were no tables ready for us. Fine. After being seated nobody ever came to our table to take our order, my father had to get up and ask someone. She took our order and came back with a drink menu for drinks. We ordered and everything came out. As the food was coming, I asked for scissors and crackers for my king crab. I asked not once, not twice, but FIVE different people to bring me them. We also ordered the rice, normally we get bowls and spoons no problem, however we had to ask for them and wait ages again. During our meal, nobody came to check on us or anything. I grew more and more annoyed because I still hadn't gotten scissors, who in the hell wants to eat cold crab. Finally I got them and we finished our meal. THEN we waited another 15ish minutes for someone to bring the bill........no one. My dad again had to get up and go ask someone.   Throughout the night we never had one consistent server or anyone who went out of their way to make the evening nice.   Super upset and annoyed."}
{"text":"Simple but delicious food. With a group of 6 we ordered 9 pounds combined of shrimp, clams and mussels. We also added corn, sausage and potatoes to the mix with captain's boil sauce with both mild and medium spice.   Potatoes were just ok but the sausage and corn were both delicious soaked in sauce. The medium spice packed a pretty good kick and somewhat overpowered the flavour of the seafood. The mild spicing was our favourite. We also ordered some extra clams with the lemon pepper sauce and the garlic butter sauce but captain's boil was definitely the best.   Unfortunately crawfish was unavailable due to supply issues (according to the server)."}
{"text":"This location has the food! Their lunch special is the best deal!  Have been back to this location several times and will keep coming back.  This Captain's Boil has the best food."}
{"text":"Awesome. One of my favorite place in Toronto. Recommend \"captain's boil's source' 'medium' spicy."}
{"text":"This is the second time we attempted to dine at The Captain's Boil.  This will be the last time we will eat at this restaurant.  After a lengthy wait, we were seated.  Looking around we noticed messy tables filled with plastic bags, sauce, oversized plastic gloves and bibs. The menu was small and concise.  Our waiter quickly reviewed it with us and was insistent we order immediately.    Our party of three ordered 3 of the 1 1/2 pound lobsters in the Captain's Boil sauce along with an order of sweet potato fries and an appetizer of shrimp.  Kind of odd to receive everything in large plastic bags.  Still wondering if there was BPA in the bags and we were all semi-poisoned!!!   Great fries, mediocre seafood.  The gloves were huge and cumbersome making it difficult to navigate the shells.  The food was very hot so trying to get it out of shell was actually painful.  The restaurant has no silverware/cutlery except plastic forks.  Since they couldn't locate any crackers, we fought with the plastic forks to get the lobster and shrimp out and into our mouths.  Finally we were given some crackers that were seriously the worst quality ever!!!!  You would think for a total bill of $156.00 they could've at least provided us with decent crackers????  The sauce the seafood was cooked in was decent but to be honest, I prefer my lobster steamed.  The sauce just made things messy.  And, I mean MESSY!!!  They can't have much in the way of overhead costs at this place.  Everything is disposable.  And, you basically do it all yourself.  They take your order, serve the food out of wine buckets and every so often (after begging) pour you water into a plastic cup.  Your only means of cleaning up is from a paper towel roll balancing upon each table.  My next seafood experience will be at a restaurant with a nicer ambiance where they have working crackers, glasses to drink from, cloth napkins and china plates.  Funny thing is, I'll bet my bill will be no different!"}
{"text":"What a few weeks can bring...  I went here again for their $11 lunch special which is their Chicken Teriyaki and rice with a small boil.  One noticeable change from before was the boil is part of the plate rather than a separate packet.  This makes a significant improvement overall when it comes to space.  In my previous review, I had commented that going to their 2-seater tables and getting the lunch special is a bad idea because of the space the boil and plate would take up.  But now that it is in one plate it should be doable now.  (We got a big table so I can't fully qualify but I can use my imagination).  I had requested no crayfish this time so I wasn't affected by it.  And I had the Captain's Boil sauce this time rather than garlic and it had a little more \"bite\" but no \"heat\" sort of like little pinches on the tongue.  Interesting, I like both this and garlic sauce I had before.  They're different enough so I can't really choose which one I like more.  The service was way better than before, I didn't have to ask for water this time around.  So overall they had addressed my concerns from my previous review so 5/5 right now.  It's still a bit slow for a quick lunch though, we were here for a little over an hour, but that's moot."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this restaurant because eating with my hands while wearing a bib seemed alluring to me,  for some reason.  First of all the service was fine. They seemed very concerned with offering refills on water but when I needed the bill they all were no where to be found. We had shrimp, crawfish with the captian's broil seasoning, corn, lotus root and cajun fries. The shrimp have the heads on and are not deveined. The waitress was bewildered as to why this would be unappealing. I had to Google if eating the vein was harmful before my partner would continue eating. It's not, it just muddies the shrimp flavour because it is shrimp poop.  Do not waste your time with the crawfish. There is little meat on them and I think the idea of crawfish is more alluring that the crawfish themselves. They are also really sharp and stab you all the damn time. The corn was overcooked. The lotus root was fine and so were the fries.  Really, it's exhausting to dismember and devein your food for over an hour. I want somebody to do that for me when I go pay for food. Why are people lining up for this?  I really do not get the hype. It's a pass for me."}
{"text":"I found The Captain's Boil on Instagram and thought they offered an interesting and different concept. It was quite the experience and it was lots of fun to eat with your hands and manage the gloves and the bib and the slippery beer bottle.  My boyfriend and I tried the shrimp in Cajun sauce and the mussels in garlic sauce. The thing is, you have to tackle a pound of a very distinct and powerful flavour, I got a bit tired at the end. The fries helped, but then, it was Cajun fries so in the end everything tasted Cajun, and after a while the heat gets to you (or at least it did to me).  The experience was very cool, and the food was just OK. I think I'm fine with doing this just once. But yea, I would recommend people to try it.  We had to wait for maybe half an hour to get seated, but I had heard worse so we were mentally prepared for that."}
{"text":"full disclosure went during a Yelp Elite event. but the FOOD WAS SO GOOD and service was excellent! like so fresh and the flavours were good and eating with your hands how fun is that? highly recommend"}
{"text":"Very good food with a fair amount of options on the menu. The hot was certainly NOT spicy so go all out. I had he snow crab with corn and the wife had shrimp with potatoes. Both were very good. Service was not exceptional but we enjoyed our meal."}
{"text":"Finally came here with my best friend to see what the hype is all about. It was better than I expected but not really my cup of tea.   We got a pound of shrimp, a pound of mussels, a pound of crab legs, fried shrimp, an order of sausage, and two orders of rice (bestie's an over-orderer). We got the Captain's Boil signature sauce in mild for everything.  When I initially looked at the sauce flavours I didn't find them very interesting, but it turns out that the mix of three tastes kind of like coconut curry, which was nice. The mild still packs quite a punch! The sauce is also quite greasy, which was surprising. I'd have preferred less oil, but it does go nicely with rice.   The mussels were huge and plump but overcooked. The crab legs were frozen, which was expected, but the quality was lower than what I was expecting. The best were the shrimp - dense and a decent size, with meaty bodies and delicious heads. I also really enjoyed the sausages- I'd throw them in with my seafood next time. The fried shrimp was a waste of calories and money.   Service was great. I thought the bibs were really cute! The lack of utensils and napkins kind of threw me, especially since the gloves they give you don't really protect you at all - but I loved that there was a nice, large sink right in the middle of the restaurant for you to wash up in.   We came straight after work and we still had to wait! Reservations are definitely recommended. I'll probably be back once with my mom to show her what it's all about, but I probably wouldn't otherwise return. It was a fun enough novelty!"}
{"text":"We heard commercial on radio saying it's a great place to watch NBA games, so we went... And found out they have very few sports channels available. The Raptor game wasn't available.  All of their four TVs were sharing one Bell box, very disappointed!!! If you spend thousand dollars on commercial ask for people to come and watch sport games while eating, why not put a bit more on your TV channels?"}
{"text":"If you have frequented the Boiling Crab in California then this is the step sibling. Firstly, this restaurant is devoid of graffiti marks and crustacean decor that BC have. In fact, it really lacks decoration. As for the food, is good but could be better. It feels like they cheat you on your order. Last time I came I ordered a pound of shrimp expecting a bag of shrimp and sauce. Instead, I got shrimps with potatoe cubes on the sauce. As a result, I get less shrimp on my order. It is hard to compare but at other similar restaurant such as Boiling Crab or Kickin Crab you  dont get cheated at least right in your face. Shame on Captain Boil! Also, they dont provide you with fresh sliced lemon on the side for garnishing.   Sadly, I cant recommend going to Captain Boil for all good reasons."}
{"text":"For a boil, this place is a bit over rated.  As for the website- \"We take the freshest catch of seafood and crawfish straight from the Fishermen.  Allowing you to enjoy the full flavor of the sea.\"  I have a feeling that some of their seafood is probably frozen and not \"from the freshest catch\". I got the shrimp, mussels and snow crab legs. I had to ask 3 times for some crackers and they didn't have any so I got a flimsy pair of scissors. Hint- if your main attraction is seafood make sure you have the proper utensils. The actual seasoning is good as I got the captains boil mix. The price point is ok if you are conscience of what you order, as it can quickly get out of hand. One of the best side dishes I had was the Cajun rice.  My girlfriend really enjoyed the Cajun fries as well. Overall I wasn't too impressed and probably won't be trying it again."}
{"text":"First time we tried to go, we called they said no reservation for less than six people. When we called to make reservation they said they don't take reservation for less than party of 8. I said but I called earlier and was told reservation only for party of six or more.  They said no. Told us to wing it. We got there and was told minimum 2 hours wait for our party of 8.  Second time, our friends came before us and got a table.  We got there and 3 big ticket items being crawfish, crab and king crab legs are sold out.  We opted for the shrimp, clams, mussels and lobsters all in the captains sauce. It was very garlic and heavy on the peppers. Lost the sweetness of the seafood.  I ordered the Cajun rice and got the fries instead.  Still ate it.  It wasn't bad but nothing spectacular.  All in all, it is a good experience and novelty thing to try but definitely not going to be a regular spot.  It is really expensive, too expensive."}
{"text":"Busy restaurant with major seafood vibes! We ordered a lot! Lobster, shrimp, clams and mussels!   The captains boil sauce is ok, I prefer the garlic sauce or would have liked lemon pepper. Staff are friendly and efficient and it's a seamless meal service. Bags, glove and a plate that's all you need. Nice to have the crackers if you can get em, or you will have to improvise."}
{"text":"A decent seafood experience. However a bit too intent on garlic and not enough diversity in sauce flavours. Also they don't have enough lobster crackers, which makes eating a bit of a challenge. Nonetheless decent service, friendly staff and good for families and friends to spend around 1-2 hours."}
{"text":"This place is becoming a regular favourite spot for a seafood fix! I always get the shrimp, clams and king or Dungeness crab. You get to pick whatever sauce you want and my fav is med heat captains boil which is a combo of lemon pepper, garlic and Cajun. You got to wear faaaancy gloves, a bib and get messy!!!! Don't wear white or anything you mind getting dirty. Also don't bother with the crawfish. Too much work for little bit of meat!"}
{"text":"It is really disappointing how inconsistent the Captain's Boil is.   Our first experience here was excellent! We came for dinner with a group of 7. Our waitress was fantastic, extremely attentive; our food came quick and it was exactly like the pictures! Lots of food, and we left stuffed, we even took some home.   Our second experience wasn't so great. We came for lunch with a group of 10. We had reservations ahead of time, but there was only one other table when we got there. The waitress wasn't bad, but not really around much. The food was super slow to arrive. We waited for over an hour to get our food...I got the lunch special, I found it to be really really greasy. It was so greasy I couldn't eat much and left hungry. The whole experience took about an hour and 45 minutes."}
{"text":"Super overrated. The sauce over powers any of the seafood flavour. Also, eating with gloves isn't great, even though it sounds like a lot of fun. It gives off a cheap dining experience; there are no dishes and everything is disposable -very environmentally unfriendly."}
{"text":"Due to many stories, arrived before 6pm to avoid the long lineup. The hostess was welcoming and helpful. The servers were nice and knowledgable, they gave realistic suggestions and warned customers who ordered more than average. Once seated, there's a plastic bib with different outfit designs, a pair of plastic gloves and a roll of paper towel.  The seafood came out piping hot and it felt fresh. The servers repeat the order while dropping off the plastic bag of goods. Ordered the first 3lbs of seafood (crawfish, mussels, clams) in mild and that was more spice than expected. Was excited they had crawfish as many people had said its a seasonal item or sold out early. Had to order another lbs of shrimp not spicy at the end. Chose captain boil's flavour was packed full of butter and garlic (on a date: bring gum). One pair of gloves was definitely not enough as the claws of the crawfish kept ripping the fingers.   Overall, it was a nice experience, a bit on the pricey side and lacks variety. Maybe a place to come back on a special occasion."}
{"text":"I ordered a Seafood Fried Rice through MealPal and was thoroughly disappointed... The portion size was big enough but almost all of it was just rice! I think there were 3-4 pieces of shrimp and some corn here and there. I understand MealPal offers cheaper meals but all of the other restaurants I've ordered from had provided much higher quality lunches that don't skimp on ingredients."}
{"text":"My friends and I tried this place for the first time. Most of the dishes were delicious. I personally had the clams and it was my favourite. Best tasting and least amount of mess. But my 3 stars is really for the expensive price my fiancé paid for his dungess crab. He started off eating for the legs of the crab. When he was done that, he turned over the shell and saw that the whole shell was empty. Usually there is a lot of meat still in that part of the crab, but it was empty. The service was great from some servers and not so great from others. All in all, I would recommend you go and try it for the experience, just don't get the crab."}
{"text":"Food was excellent, staff was courteous and friendly, atmosphere was good, place was clean and price was reasonable.....what more could you ask for. First visit and definitely won't be my last!"}
{"text":"So I have been here a few times.  Not sure what the big deal is. Theres so much plastic waste it makes my heart hurt. Please god tell me they green bin the organic waste.  But I must say if you come here, come at night. The difference between quality of service and food is HUGE!!  Parking: Tonnes. It's in a plaza in Newmarket. More than you would ever need.  Decor:  Typical captains boil. What's cute is, they have a sink at the front for your hand washing convenience.   There are booth and table- booth hybrids.  It's bigger than the Thornhill location.  Service: Ok.  At night, some of the best service I have ever had. Full restaurant and you couldn't tell by how attentive our server was to our and all the other tables she was taking care of. Thumbs up.  At noon: Two tables, three servers. Friday ( says alot) They were too busy looking cute I guess.   So there was an oops with my meal. Wrong thing. .  She went to the kitchen to see if they would fix it.  She left the plate in front of me and came back and said that yes they would replace it.   Seriously, as if they wouldn't, she literally had to ask if they would fix their mistake.   Food: Night food was way better than the day food. Seriously.   The bag stuff is meh. Oh. Everyone e who I ever talked to about this knows this story.  I'm not even sure why it makes me so mad. A 10 pound bag of potatoes can be bought for $2 on sale. You can order potato as a side in your your boil bag. For 1.50. I got half a medium potato which was cut in half. Half a smallish potato. Omg.   Lunch got the terryaki fish. It was deep fried and over cooked. Didn't have any sauce so it was hard and dry. I'm not sure where the terryaki sauce was.   Timing: In the evening -Went with 9 people  and again with 2 people and we were in and out in an hour and we ordered a lot of dishes.  At lunch with 10, we were in and out in 1 hour and 30+. It took an hour for the people who ordered bags of lobster and crab to get them.   I've been. Don't need to go back"}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday evening with my bestie and had still had to wait for about half an hour. I would suggest calling ahead of time to make a reservation.   The menu was very simple (which is good) and had steps for you to follow. You pretty much pick your seafood, the seasoning, and the spiciness. Their prices are listed per pound to make things easier. They have cute plastic bibs for you and a roll of paper towel at the table side for your convenience. I wish they had those wipes that they give at wing restaurants, though. The waiters and waitresses were friendly, but food could be executed a bit faster (I do understand we visited during opening week).   I ordered one pound of garlic clams, and one pound of lime and pepper shrimp. I looveeee garlic, but their level of garlic was a bit too much for me. No mints, or brushing of teeth, or mouthwash got rid of that garlicky taste in my mouth for two days. We ordered a side of garlic bread and a side of fries. I'd say if you need some carbs, go with the fries. The garlic bread was a bit cold, and not toasted at all. Will I come back? Maybe when the hype dies down, but I feel like this is something one could easily make at home."}
{"text":"I came here to eat with some friends. I have been to the markham location before.  The staff is very friendly. This only opened up a week ago so they don't have a liquor license yet, one of my friends was a bit disappointed but we understand. On the downside, the servers seemed a bit inexperienced (almost forgot to take 2/4 of our orders) and 2/3 of the stalls in the bathroom didn't have toilet paper.   Regarding the food, I got a lobster roll. The amount of lobster in it was disappointing for the price. It tasted really good though. The only issues I had were that the water tasted weird like in a really stale way and the ketchup was very runny."}
{"text":"My experience at The Captain's Boil Newmarket was outstanding! The food was amazing, the environment is on point, the staff was super friendly and attentive. They were contantly coming to the table asking if everything was right. Our server, Charlene was incredibly amazing. She came up to us with the best energy, she explained the menu to one of my friends who had never been to the captain's boil, asked what drinks we wanted, brought them within seconds, gave us a few minutes to choose what we wanted and came back to take the order. The food came quickly and absolutely delicious. She was so friendly and welcoming. She's a keeper! I've been to many different TCBs in the GTA and this was definitely my best experience. We will be back! :)"}
{"text":"Good service, reasonable price. I went there twice and the service was excellent, the staff are friendly and patient. The food there was good and the seafood was fresh. Although the lobster and crab was a little bit pricey, the others weren't expensive at all."}
{"text":"The worst of all locations. Why are they even still open? First visit, they were out of corn and only had mild sauce (hot sauce was given in the side). Second visit, they had absolutely no corn and no other sauce option except mild. What a waste of time! One the the plus sides of captains boil is their amazing sauce combinations. This location sucks!"}
{"text":"Expensive for what you get.  Flavours and spices become kind of gross after the first few bites.  Did I mention how overpriced it is considering we are basically eating food boiled in sauce, then served in a plastic bag?  Don't think this chain will last very long, place is always empty and seafood is always expensive.  Decorations are nice though, this is more of a come once for the experience and don't bother coming back type of establishments."}
{"text":"Good for the experience. But if you are looking for an expensive midnight snack, then this is the spot for you! Taste-wise, pretty good. I got the snow crab, clams, lobster, and crawfish for a total of $100 before tip. Definitely would not get full off of this and I'm a slim dude. Again, good for the experience but would not return for a second go. P.S. the music is live though. House mix."}
{"text":"First time here for dinner, there was a 20min wait. The food was tasty and the idea of the restaurant was new to me. Got a pound of snow crab legs and shrimps. Both delicious. Medium spicy is a little hotter than we expected. Also got lotus root as a side. These were more than enough food for 2 people. Would come back to try the rice platter and fries"}
{"text":"Wait times are short and the captain boil sauce is delicious.  I would recommend the mussels and shrimp because they are cheaper options. Not only that you get more meat per pound compared to crawfish.  My only complaint is that the food in general is covered is soaked in oil."}
{"text":"This location is a no for me. I found the staff here quite stand offish/ unfriendly and unwelcoming. This is also a bigger location I found but only had 1 bathroom stall. And the music selection could be more lively. The menu had less than the one I previously visited. I asked the waiter if all the restaurants carry the same menu he said yes. I went to the one on the Queensway and they had more on their menu."}
{"text":"Great services. Servers were welcoming and nice. Great menu selections. More than 1 bathroom stall."}
{"text":"Love the seafood here. I can stuff my face and meticulously deshell my food without shame. Lol. I always get Captain's Boil Fire for the sauce, which isn't even spicy. I like the mussels and lobster. I took one star off because the sauce does get a bit too salty and oily. It's really good, I just wish it's less salty. Makes you so thirsty. And you definitely need more than 1 mint after your meal. More like 5 pieces of gum, because your breath will be super garlicky. Maybe not a first date spot unless your date is definitely cool. The calamari is also good and crunchy. My suggestion if you're going here is to wear short sleeves or sleeveless dark-coloured clothing, unless you are not planning to get messy. Oh and bring lotsa minty gum! Or Listerine strips! Hahaha."}
{"text":"Decided to go try new seafood dishes. The taste of the food was pretty good especially for their special sauce. They served a little quick and their service was nice too. However, the amount of food was actually less than i expected but good experience :)"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Great food   Waiter didn't bring our drinks but we were charged for them. Visa machine didn't work."}
{"text":"Best seafood restaurant I've been to in Toronto!! Definitely a must-visit if you like seafood or just an interesting eating experience."}
