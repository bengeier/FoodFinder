{"text":"Excellent Yemeni food. Only options are chicken or lamb (prefer the lamb plates). They only take cash or debit. The plate portions are more than enough. Gets very busy, with lines. The food is made fresh and is usually ready in 20 minutes, would recommend you call ahead, they take orders over the phone. Most of the traffic was for catering or trays (2 large lamb plates go in one small tray $40 - good for 4-5 people.)"}
{"text":"Very good Mandi, comparable to what you get in Yemen, Saudi and Jordan. Big lamb portions. The Meat one meal is for $17.5."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here on a whim because I randomly came across this place on Yelp! It had good reviews, and the food looked amazing. They have 2 entree options to choose from (the lamb, or the chicken) and we chose both. For $40, we had a party tray of food and 2 pops. There was definitely enough food for 4 people (or lots of leftovers for lunch for the next 2 days). The rice with the raisins, almonds, and fried onions was something neither my boyfriend or I have ever had, but it was delicious. The crunch, the sweet, and the savoury! The lamb and chicken were flavourful and fell off the bone. Would definitely be back again.  There are only about 4 tables (of 4 each) inside the restaurant, so it's not ideal for large groups to eat-in. Take-out would be best in that case!"}
{"text":"Their food is so delicious. I love it. If you want to taste Arabian food go to this place. It's not expensive too."}
{"text":"The restaurant does not have much of a selection, however, the one dish they do is excellent. The dish is rice spiced well with caradamon and peppercorns, the only reason I know those were in the rice is because I saw them. The reality is the rice is spiced very well because it is balanced, no one spice overtakes the other and the rice is not overly spiced, and the incorporation of meat flavour makes the rice so good you can eat alone and be satisfied. The rice is topped off with deeply cooked onions, raisins and almonds. They offer the rice with your choice of lamb, lamb shank or chicken. Lamb is 2 large pieces from different parts of the lamb, chicken comes in quarter, half or whole and lastly there is the lamb shank. I tried the chicken was not a fan it was bland and over cooked to western standards, but the use of slow cooking worked wonderfully on the lamb which was so tender it slipped of the bone and it worked well with the light seasoning. The place is very clean and the tables and chairs are unique. The two men working are very friendly, all in all the place is very nice and nice change from the standard type of restaurants."}
{"text":"This was the second time i came here. The first time we got 1 lamb and 2 chicken. The lamb was the best i have ever had. It falls of the bone right as you pick into it and it was delicious.   Came again for my dad's birthday and i was hoping it was the same consistency. I was shocked that it was the same. Fall. Of the bone lamb and chicken.   I recommend this restaurant to everyone."}
{"text":"Very good mendi I recommend it to everyone, the portions are big each portion is enough for at least two.. those who are talking about saudi and Uae mendi know nothing about the dish coz it's originally a Yemeni dish there is no such thing as saudi or Uae mendi  Owners are pleasant and very friendly.. definitely going back"}
{"text":"Chicken was ok but the lamb was really delicious at first we really liked it but the place is so dirty and disorganized. I could see the dirt everywhere specially the door for employees was black of the dirt. After all my husband got sick because of the food and his immune system is weak to bacterias and specially dirty food. So the food was dirty as much as the place and plates are so expensive we paid 42 for 2!! Never going there again"}
{"text":"Great mandi but I don't know how the price is justified . I mean $17 for a plate ? Doesn't that even sound a lot ."}
{"text":"The Food is unbelievable (Tasty + Clean and Fresh ) and like no other place in Toronto for Yemen Mandi Food. Amazing crew with professional talented 5-10 min max waiting time for the order.   These type of restaurant is a 100% worth to try.   Good Job Almonasabah !!!"}
{"text":"I tried both the meat and chicken they were great.. Best food I had in a while.. The portions are large too . Don't expect to sit there as there is limited space but do give it a try."}
{"text":"The best Yemeni food ever. The lamb taste amazing and juicy. Definitely I will come back again.."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time this weekend.  Had the lamb and chicken.  Lamb was succulent and chicken was moist.  I like that these guys want to do a few things but do it really well.  I will definitely be back.  I also hope that they maintain consistency.  This will keep people comimg back."}
{"text":"Blown away by the subtle but exquisite flavours of the lamb mandi. I can't wait to go back again. Get both chicken and lamb to share!"}
{"text":"This is delicious, authentic mandi. It's not too heavy in oil, or grease, or spice or masala, but it still manages to be tasty without being overbearing.  The chicken mandi is so soft and the raisins and fried onions make the rice delicious. I'm definitely a fan! This is great, filling food that isn't heavy on the stomach!"}
{"text":"Best Mandi I ever had Very clean kitchen  They love to cook and it shows  Call to order early they get sold out quickly"}
{"text":"What a cute little Yemeni food spot. Went with a friend today and got a half chicken plate to share. Good portions. The place is small and looked to be extremely busy with take out orders. There isn't much room to sit. The man taking the orders at cash was super sweet and nice.  If I'm ever in the area again would stop by !"}
{"text":"I finally found the best mandi restaurant in the GTA which serves authentic Yemeni or Gulf food. This is the closest mandi match to the mandi I travel all the way to Dubai for. You can never go wrong with the lamb mandi. Chicken mandi is great too.   Dine in area is a bit small but can reasonably seat 3-4 families. It's more of a take-out place."}
{"text":"I got the chicken, and i like it. very flavorful, small and best for small groups. My friends loved their meat option, but the saudi mendi is actually better in all fairness.   4 stars for the flavor fullness and the decent price and huge portions."}
{"text":"The food is good. The place is dirty, I entered the place and I found leftover food on all the tables (all dirty & unclean). No customer service, no washroom available for customer, altough its a dine in resturant."}
{"text":"Delicious and authentic mandi ! The meat is soft and tender and melts in the mouth. The rice are flavorful - with raisins and almonds and fried onions. We ordered the chicken and the lamb amd both were spot on ! Highly recommend the food here.   Knocking off one star due to the lack of hospitality... even though the timings are until 10 pm - they start clearing out at 9:30 and refuse to seat you after 9ish. Takeout is available until 10 pm though. The staff is not too friendly but oh well. ( we went on a weekday, maybe it's different on the weekends ).   Plenty of parking abailable and the prices are also very reasonable !"}
{"text":"This is our family's favorite place. They have the moistest meats, and same quality every time."}
{"text":"Amazing lamb mandi!!  The meat was truly delicious!!  Rice was cooked to perfection... lovely, simple place. Their fresh hot sauce is a must try as well.  Loved it...  wish they made Harees as well..."}
{"text":"Amazing quality food, really enjoyed the lamb fall of the bone. First time I've had Yemeni food, and it did not disappoint. Don't let the looks from the outside keep you away!"}
{"text":"Great mandi place, haven't seen many in the GTA and brings me back to my times in Dubai. Definitely recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"Best Mandi in town. It is hard enough to find Mandi... yet here we have someone making daily fresh and authentic Mandi."}
{"text":"Where's the sixth..sorry tenth star? Because the food here deserves it.   I grew up in the middle east and even after decades of being in Toronto never had the opportunity to eat mandi.. I was always on the hunt. Then one bright morning I thought why not turn to Yelp.. (seriously why didn't I do this before).   That's it. I saw. I came. I ate. I died and went to lamb heaven.   I've been here multiple times now and I still recall how I confusingly looked around to find a plastic knife the first time.. Only to realise that you don't need one!!! That lamb will break off as you touch it. The rice is so perfectly flavoured it reminds me of my childhood. The nuts are a perfect addition and the chutney gives it the perfect little spice kick. What is not to love! It's a complety perfect meal. Ive also tried the chicken and it's totally brilliant.   I might go on carb free diets but I will break that any time someone says let's go to Almonasabah.."}
{"text":"One of the best mandi I've had anywhere. Would have given 5 stars but I hate eating from a styrofoam plate. Also he forgot the salad and there was no washroom in the restaurant. Nevertheless its a great option for a takeout."}
{"text":"The rice did not have any of the usual flavors expected of a Mandi. The meat was tender and moist. Overall it tastes like a pulao with the meat cooked seperately so the rice does not get the flavors. The price does not match the quantity favourably. I will not eat here again."}
{"text":"Having tried the Mandi all the time in Dubai I would say this is not exactly Mandi but the closest thing to it here in Mississauga.."}
{"text":"Just Yummy!! I loved the lamb Mandi plate... but it is more of a takeout place than a sit down restaurant.. I highly recommend it for takeouts!"}
{"text":"Good food but they have only four table for 16 people, and give food in take away packing with if required use of paper plates and plastic spoons and forks. How can they expect people to eat mandi with paper and plastic."}
{"text":"Mandi lamb full and a chicken quarter, was good enough for the 4 of us. Brilliantly done, with meat falling off the bones, and the rice garnished with roasted nuts and raisins .. likewise the chicken was equally done very well .. you just can't have a bad experience with such menus, that offer you a wholesome meal, delivered to perfection, without jumping into too many other items, unless the real cook has gone on a strike. Lastly, they have very friendly service .. and a goto place anytime."}
{"text":"OMG finally we've got to have Yemeni food in Mississauga, amazing and tasty food , the lamb was perfectly done ! Good luck and most of all keep it up"}
{"text":"I ordered a large lamb and a 1/2 chicken thinking it would be good for 2 people. We ended up eating Mandi for dinner and had enough left overs for next day's lunch. So the portion is quite large. But I wish the portion would be smaller and the price a little lower to correspond. That's my only little complaint but the food I too amazing and I still recommend it. Mandi is not easy to find so definitely check it out.  Taste wise it was delicious! Whatever spice they are using, it is excellent! The brownish onions add a nice touch to the rice. I've had various middle eastern style rice like the Afghan Quabuli and the Iranian saffron rice. This rice stands out nicely on its own.  The meat is quite tender but I've had more tender meat before. The meat here is still excellent. The lamb has no gamey taste which is important to me. The chicken is very similar to Iranian style chicken with those little red cherries served on rice. Great taste."}
{"text":"Best lamb mandi in the city. The owners are supper friendly. I have tried the place for different portions, main plate and catering menu (Whole lamb Mandi). Both orders were so delicious. I would recommend to call in advance for your orders"}
{"text":"Lamb is delicious, a bit pricy but worth the meal. Highly recommend to go and taste the food"}
{"text":"Expensive but really good food.  I think 25 dollars for one person meal would be the average pricing.  there is less space to sit but it can accommodate 10 to  12 people."}
{"text":"Taste like heaven, good customer service, clean and well done food, amazing, i didnt taste mandi in Saudi like this! Try everything specially lamb mandi"}
{"text":"I wouldn't normally write a review for a place that I only ate takeout food from, let alone when I didn't even pickup the food myself so don't even know how the place looks.   However, Almonasabah deserves this review for now regardless as the food was DELICIOUS.   I ate the chicken mandi - theirs is a rice dish with bone-in chicken, almonds, raisins, fried onions, and mixture of spices. We asked for ours to be made with no raisins. The dish was fragrant, flavourful, and fall-off-the-bone tasty.   4 of us shared one whole chicken mandi + small lamb mandi, and had leftovers.   The menu is pretty basic, and they do what they serve very well."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Yemen food and it was delicious! I had chicken mandi - the chicken was incredibly tender and full of flavours and the rice was very tasty, too. Price was a touch high, but food was great. Will go back and try the lamb next time!"}
{"text":"A great taste you cannot find elsewhere in the GTA. Was my first time trying Yemeni food, and I loved it."}
{"text":"It's a little weird that most of these reviews are done by people in united states?  I went there expecting great food based on the reviews, however, i was disappointed before i even got to have food.  I don't think this place has a permit to serve food as it says \"Catering and Takeout only\". I asked for the washroom, and they said they didn't have any, what kind of a restaurant doesn't have a washroom? I went to the store beside it for washroom and the guy said he has a washroom but doesn't open it for customers, complain to the city.  Food: Maybe I don't know specifically what a \"Yemeni\" Mandi is like, but i have had several Mandis in different middle eastern countries (Saudi, UAE), and this was NOTHING like them. To be fair though, it wasn't bad, the meat was very tender and juicy, the rice was cooked good with a generous topping of raisin, nuts and fried onions. However, it was not authentic mandi as far as i can tell. Authentic mandi  - the rice is cooked with either the meat itself, or the essence of meat so it would have a taste (Al Mandi on bloor has authentic mandi).  Also, the pictures you see, is not how the food is served - the food is served in plastic containers, even if you choose to sit down and eat (which further increases my doubt in their permit for dine in - i could be wrong).  Service:  The owner was hidden in his kitchen for the most part, customers would come and would ring the bell repeatedly before he would decide to show up. Our group was the last to be served by them - AT 6:00 PM, are you kidding me?  Somebody came after us and they were straight up told that they are sold out and they should have called and confirmed if they had food - not cool homie not cool.  They left saying out loud \"Boy, this is a weird place\"."}
{"text":"I gave this place a try, and loved it!! Had the lamb and it lived up to every great review! Will definitely be going back once a month!"}
{"text":"I found this little gem of a place due to yelp. My friend and I went there and were really impressed.   Their portion sizes are huge! The price is fair for what you get. Their lamb Mandi is on point and it's defiantly a must try place. I've tried the chicken as well but I preferred the lamb."}
{"text":"A must try! I hope owners and recipe never changes. AMAZING lamb mandi!!! Only tried takeout. It's similar to biryani but different. We got one lamb Mandi and asked for extra piece of lamb. That was enough for two. Lamb was soft and flavourful. Rice was amazing too."}
{"text":"First mandy in Canada and it's excellent rice, seasoning , chicken and lamb. The meat is very well done and melting with the rice. Also, the almonds and raisin are kindly covering the dish. Worth the value."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the exterior...this place serves steaming generous portions of perfectly tender lamb shank on an aromatic bed of rice with raisins and almonds.  We stopped by this place after using Yelp and we were not disappointed.  The complimentary mint tea to finish the meal was a nice touch.    Strongly recommend you supporting this small business!  You  will not be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Last time I had mandi was over 15 years ago in Saudi Arabia. I must say that this came pretty close to being the real deal.  We ordered the rice and lamb large portion. It was like magic on a plate. The flavoring of the rice and the tenderness of the Lamb was perfect.   For a person like me who is fed up of eating Biryani this is the best alternative now.  Will definitely be going back time and time again."}
{"text":"Was really disappointed with this place. First time I went they said they don't have any food left and I have to call in before I come... With all these reviews I was still tempted to go back and called to place a order. Went to pick it up and literally waited 30 minutes till someone served me. The guy was busy in the kitchen and not paying attention. The chicken itself was good but the rice was definitely undercooked. The sauce they give they cheapen out on. Will definitely not be going back again."}
{"text":"yemeni cuisine? what's that? look no further than almonasabah  bare interior but that just doesn't matter s'all about mandi  a kind of rice dish like a milder biryani flavours are toned down  topped with sweet raisins, crunchy fried almond slivers, tasty browned onions  the chicken's decent, but please order it with lamb -- tender to the touch  like the others say, the order is to be shared good luck soloing  gripping and unique, the food here is a real treat i've endless praise for  a trip to this spot is a walk to remember i want moore mandi"}
{"text":"Excellent meal ! A typical Yemen meal. I am glad to live in Toronto where everything is available and o don't have to fly to Saudi every time o crave lamb and rice. I'm sure not simple to make but it was a simple meal. A perfectly cooked rice with a ton of aroma and flavour and the Lamb was soft fall off the bone and chicken was full of flavour and tender. If only they were not that far, but worth the drive. The menu is simple and reasonably priced and be warned huge portions !"}
{"text":"What a gem of a find! Absolutely love their food. Menu is simple but you can't go wrong with either of the options. The lamb is to die for. The rice with all the toppings is just the cherry on top. Must try in life!"}
{"text":"Really excellent and tasty food!  We ordered a chicken mandi plate and lamb mandi plate. Both meats were so moist and flavourful. The rice was equally as delicious and topped with onions, almonds, and raisins. Definitely more a take out kind of place and will absolutely be returning!"}
{"text":"Clean, cozy spot for some amazing Mandi! This place takes cash or debit only. Service was very friendly and fast. Both their lamb and chicken Mandi are delicious. I also tried their shafoot which was also very good. Definitely will be going here again next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I am not an expert on Yemen food. Had it once. Ordered the chicken and rice. I thought it was very flavourful but a little too dry. Service was good."}
{"text":"Important Tip:  Bring at least 2-3 other friends/family members if you're planning to dine IN Almonasabah!  There are a few tables, but their menu is better suited for groups.  Their Chicken/Lamb Mendi, similar to Biryani, but not as many spices, is the only item on the menu AND it's absolutely HUGE.    Behind my friend and I was a table of 5 men...eating the same portion as my table of 2 chicks, so hopefully that gives you an idea of the portion sizes.  Price is in line with the portion.  Although both meats were very tender and flavourful, I thought the Lamb stood out more.  I loved the addition of the fried onions, almond pieces, & raisins in the basmati rice.  Delicious!  Unless you're in a group, I wouldn't recommend ordering the half Chicken/Lamb.  Staff suggested this option and it was my mistake to not ask for the price until time of checkout.  Basically it was $17.99 (price of lamb) + $14.99 (half of chicken), so between 2ppl, we basically paid ~$40...definitely better if there was more than just 2ppl sharing. :S  Staff was very friendly!  Food came out shortly after ordering.  There was a nice complimentary tea, made in-house, to enjoy with your Mandi.  Wished that there was more stuff on the menu, especially the option of having some kinda ethnic dessert.  Options available were for catering.  Wouldn't hesitate to go back again...when I have a group together!"}
{"text":"Excellent food!  I was a little hesitant to try this place however my friend and I eventually decided to give it a go.  We ordered the chicken mandi and it was just simply delicious. The texture of the chicken was EXTREMELY soft, and the raisons + almonds + crispy onions + chicken skin (very similar in texture to flame grilled chicken, but completely different taste) along with the rice was just a remarkably good combination.  I will surely visit again."}
{"text":"I tried Lamb Mandi plate and it was really tender and the rice was spot on. It's my second time here and I am definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Chicken and rice and everything nice! Some of the slow cooked chicken and/or lamb on rice I've ever had. Simple and great home style food. Aaaand it's halal.  This is a small business your heart and stomach will feel great supporting! Enjoy."}
{"text":"Laham mandi ya habibi! Authentic yemeni lamb mandi 20+tax for a single plateof lamb mandi Pricey yet 2 mid size couple who are not too hungry can be satiated  I saw group of 5 asians \"eatperimenting\" In 1 single mandi plate Gotta love the fact they don't hold back on the lovely nutty raisin garnish with lamb is cooked to tender juicy perfection  Right amount of spice in the rice!!"}
{"text":"I was impressed by the reviews. Tried it once. It is nothing like Mandi...Even the spices weren't the same. It did give me this encouragement, that I should cook Mandi at home. It was still better than the one I had from Al Monasabah..and, I am not a good cook :)"}
{"text":"Best food I ever tasted in a long time great food portions. I came from California just to try there food and it definitely deserved the long trip I recommend it to every one who loves great food."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! We found this on a fluke one day while in the area and walking by. The mandi here is so delicious and full of flavour.   We have tried the chicken and the lamb and they were both a huge hit in our house. The meats are cooked perfectly and gave flavour in every bite.   The service is great here too its mostly a takeout place."}
{"text":"Simple yet Amazing. The food is really good and the portion sizes are huge, I still don't know how they make it taste so good and fresh."}
{"text":"Tried mandi for the first time and I loved it! Portion was reasonable and the lamb was perfectly done, soft and falls off from the bone! I would go back on a regular basis if they had different options in the menu but I would definitely go back every once in a while if I start craving for the mandi plate!"}
{"text":"The mandi is very flavorful. The nuts and toppings on rice adds extra flavor. The lamb is soft. The only thing I did not like is the potato tastes a bit different, possibly uses a bit too much turmeric powder. Other than that a must try, portion is big, good for 4 adults if you order lamb mandi and half chicken for $37.23 incl tax."}
{"text":"This is literally the best mandi in town bar none either lamb or chicken that is so soft it melts in your mouth. When I first started going there more than a year ago the portions were huge and generous and matches the price you are paying.  Then all of a sudden the meat they give you was cut in half, the container became smaller and even the chicken became as small as a tiny chick.  In the past I literally could not finish the whole plate of lamb, and there was so much meat I could eat from it a lunch the next day. Last time I went there, when I got home, I opened the container and I was where the fu*k is the meat !! It was just a bunch of rice with a couple of pieces .. I was shocked, pissed and mad.  A month later I said let me try again, maybe it was a one time thing!! The container was literally even smaller and the chicken this time was tiny. I wash the containers and keep them, so I will post a pic. This is the same order size I used to order and always the same guy, the owner, who was giving me the food .. so you can't blame it on a employee.. anyway, I stopped going all together.. I expect this place to go under because of his greed !!!"}
{"text":"Simple location with just a few tables and mostly for takeout, simple menu... Chicken or Lamb... and they do it GREAT!"}
{"text":"The best Yemeni chicken mandi ever. hands down the best I've had so far in the GTA.. The chicken is flavored right to the bone. The rice is perfectly seasoned.. The fried onions and dry fruits give it a tangy and sweet kick. Chicken or lamb. I promise you won't be disappointed!"}
