{"text":"There was nothing about our dining experience that will draw me back to Upper Crust. While the atmosphere has potential it did not live up to our expectation. Where I was seated there was a glaring florescent light, from the kitchen, right in my line of sight. Our warm seafood dip was a good appetizer but we ran out of the baguettes and asked for more. Our waitress returned with about 6 broken pieces and said \"we're running low\"---it was 7:00 p.m. Our meals were disappointing ....my husband's lobster pot pie was described by the waitress as having a creamy sauce .....very little sauce and overall very bland. My son-in-law ordered the Rock Mac n Cheese.....he was stunned at the size of the serving as it was a very small amount considering it was listed as an entree. It too was very bland and extremely dry. Not sure if it was our waitress's  first night but she was inattentive and basically seemed distracted. After running our bill she returned to the table and mumbled something,as she was turning away, that resembled \"thanks\". There was no one at the doorway as you left to say \"thanks for coming\"...\"how was your dinner?\" Very impersonal vibe."}
{"text":"This rating is for the bar and music only. I had a special guest in town and arrived there this evening after dinner at Kindred for a drink and to hear music before heading home.  We were not given the time of day whatsoever. It was like both bartenders went out of their way not to make eye contact.   They went from side to side around the bar looking to serve but kept averting eye contact. If was not busy. After about 10 minutes (way too long to be waiting for any sort of acknowledgement) I waved at one of them in a slow wave sort of way. Still nothing.  When I began to talk to my friend about leaving and just having a drink at home. The people seated in front of us felt bad and said we could lean in and order over them. I laughed but was embarrassed it was getting to that point. Finally, that other patron flagged down one of the bartenders and told her that we would like service.  Again, she just barely looked at me and said one second and walked away. I waited AGAIN and finally went with my friend to grab our coats which we did slowly. And then headed out. No one from the restaurant ever asked us if we could be helped, said hello or anything. They just let business walk out the door.  My friend was in town from NYC and I was so embarrassed I took her there. Won't happen again  Sad because I had been there exactly a month earlier for my birthday dinner and received wonderful service from our waitress and the food was excellent.  Horrible bar service with nasty looks on their faces. I will not beg you for a drink.  It smelled horribly of a fish market when we arrived.... Not like cooked fish but like fish market. Not good.  The music was super sleepy. Hello? Do people want to fall asleep while eating dinner and hanging at a bar?"}
{"text":"The food is incredible the presentation is a piece of art What an amazing addition to davidson. It can not get any better than that will bring all my friends here"}
{"text":"Very Disappointing. This was our second time at this restaurant and I am unlikely to return. I stood at the entrance watching waiters walk by waiting to be acknowledged. Once we were seated the waiter was very nice by the service was very slow. Almost 2 hours to have dinner. The oysters tasted watery, lacking the fresh ocean taste. At $28 per dozen the expectations were high. The entree was pretty good but couldn't make up for the long wait to place our entree order. The dessert was lukewarm. $179 later and I could have gone uptown and had a much nicer meal. Can't recommend this to anyone unfortunately."}
{"text":"Had an early reservation because I can't wait too long after a tough day at work. We were able to choose from from several table options since most reservations were later. We started with some great cocktails. They do have a fantastic bar and knowledgeable bartenders. We started with seafood chowder and raw oysters. They chowder was delicious and the oysters were the best I've tasted outside of Charleston and the Pacific Northwest.  We decided to share some king crab legs. They were very clean and steamed just right. We added a bread appetizer, which was bread from the bakery downstairs.  Very fresh and delicious.  We ended with white chocolate key lime pie, which wasn't too heavy and had just a hint of line flavor. Our waitress was attentive but not overbearing and got us in and out without making us feel rushed. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Good food but the owner threatening the chef in the middle of the dining room make this a non-returner for me.  We all heard the owner tell the chef that she would fire her if she took her cut hand to the doctor, was unacceptable, not only is this a public display of a civil rights violation and completely illegal, but it is the kind of atmosphere that turns your stomach no matter how good the crawfish dip is.  Shame"}
{"text":"We were looking forward to a nice birthday dinner for my husband at Upper Crust, but we were underwhelmed at best. They didn't offer a Pinot Grigio on the wine list and the beer selections were slim. Our entrees were just ok, nothing special at all.   We much prefer the venue downstairs--personalized service, interesting food in a warmer atmosphere.   Love dining in our town of Davidson but this missed the mark........"}
{"text":"Sara is an amazing chef. Wonderful intimate space with a club atmosphere. Check out the seafood tower."}
{"text":"Lived up to the hype! Was hoping for a place with a cool vibe, warm atmosphere AND good food. Nice to find all three in Davidson. The hostess and wait staff have been spot on both times we visited. So far we've tried four different dishes and everything has been delicious! We also especially enjoyed the live music both times we were there. Comfortable and cozy, we loved it! A few more beer choices and I'm in heaven, close to home!"}
{"text":"Dined at Upper Crust last night with 9 friends and everything was perfect! Our server Dan was very helpful with recommendations on wine, entrees and dessert all of which were spot on! My Heirloom tomato w/ mozzarella was the best I've ever had at a restaurant and my \"Day boat\" Flounder was fantastic. They also had live entertainment (very talented) who was very appropriate for the crowd and size of the room. Loved everything about Upper Crust!"}
{"text":"We came here the third week it was open and just came to get drinks. The drinks were decent. The atmosphere feels a little bit generic."}
{"text":"I have to agree with Kay S. Took friends there 1/15 for dinner.  Lovely table facing the fireplace, but only after asking for it.  Seafood dip appetizer was lovely, but from there not so much.  Lobster Pot Pie served barely warm, and no sauce, but did have lots of lobster.  Rock Shrimp Mac and Cheese tasted good, but if there were 3 pieces of cut up shrimp I'd be surprised. And the portion was tiny for an entree at $15,95,  Our server was attentive and pleasant  We decided we would only go back for the bar and not dinner.  Such a shame as the first time everything was top notch."}
{"text":"So amazing!  Told that Charlotte didn't have a good seafood restaurant. ...but Davidson does! So great, staff, food, drinks..all amazing!"}
{"text":"maybe i had high expectations from all the great reviews.  drinks were great.  nice selection. fancy special.  peel n eat shrimp r plump and tasty.  chicken ravioli are tasty with the spicy marinara.  raviola was bland.  very disapponted in the louis salad though.  crab was very strong tasting and overpowering.  nice lettuces.  intersting dressing.  nice decor. friendly staff."}
{"text":"Not good. 2 out of 4 plates at table were sent back. My filet was a poor piece of meat and the presentation was not great.  The staff was very polite and dessert was very good but this experience was not great which was a let down as we invited our foodie friends up from South Park to eat:("}
{"text":"Food is excellent.  Beer selection above average (they strive for local which is a bonus in my book).  I have been there three times this year and might go back for a fourth.  The last two times I have had their seafood pot.  It's really for two, but I get it and take the rest home.  My wife had fish the last time and it was terrific.  Great ambiance, especially when they have live music.  As other reviews have said, you need to be prepared to have a 2 hour meal if you go here - otherwise, try somewhere else."}
{"text":"Wonderfully fresh seafood served amidst tasty organic offerings, with an eclectic, yet affordable, wine list and in an atmosphere that just feels perfect.  The beautiful brick interior and heavy wooden beam ceiling provided wonderful acoustics for the live music tonight. Service was wonderful! My shrimp were cooked perfectly and the artisan bread assortment appetizer was highlighted by the most creamy butter. The sugar encrusted bacon dark chocolate brownie with vanilla gelato  dessert.....well, let's just say, \"Foodie Nirvana!\""}
{"text":"Incredibly disappointed and will never go back.. We had 4 courses, drinks and spent a good bit of money .. We were having good conversation after dinner with friends that we here to have dinner and were told the there were8:30 reservations for the table that we were at.  This is not nyc and the food wasn't that good to warrant running us off .   I know tables need to be turned but don't forget that when someone spends $250 for dinner they might want to hang out for awhile ."}
{"text":"Yelp needs to post the full name, Upper Crust Bar & Social Club, because the name fully describes the gem. We are from out of town & found this place on Yelp. We were unsure about going. The entrance is a single door the opens to a staircase, so we stood there, half expecting a speak easy & needing a pass word. We were pleasantly surprise by several friendly hostesses. You need a reservation, which we didn't have, but we were fortunate to get a place @ the bar. Personally, I think this made the night. Cindy & Jess, the bartenders, were wonderful in conversation & recommendations. Jess makes everything on the menu sound like you got to have it. We started off with specialty cocktails, bread basket, & oysters, all excellent. It was fresh & tasty. Followed by a zesty ceviche with a glass of wine for me & a florentine ravioli for my wife. The ceviche was good, different for me. I think it would fit better for me as an afternoon hors d'oeuvre on a warm day. The ravioli was very good & more fit our mood. I did have an excellent shrimp bisque that was perfect to end my evening. My wife had a dark chocolate brownie with gelato. All in all, a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Had dinner there with my wife. Service was outstanding. Food was great. Very friendly atmosphere. Gladly recommend as a nice place to enjoy dinner with friends as well."}
