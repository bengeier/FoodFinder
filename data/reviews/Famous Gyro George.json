{"text":"Back to the Gyro George of old! Several years back I left a bad review because it was poor. Re-visited on a report from a friend and was pleased to the place all cleaned up and neat. The dining room was changed and things were open and orderly. Food was delicious, I ordered a Philly gyro and wife has fries and regular gyro. All were fast, tasty and fresh. Counter help was talkative and polite and I was thanked by both workers as I left. Welcome back and see you again soon Georgie!"}
{"text":"Well, it was fast. I'll give them that. Eight minutes from the phone call in the parking lot to the gyros in my hand. One regular one chicken or whatever lunch meat shredded they call chicken. After one bite from each I can say the soggy pita will never touch my tongue again. The 2 stars was for the polite cashier who took my 14.95."}
{"text":"The owners are really nice and the gyro meat and pitas are good so I hate that I can't give a better rating. But the sauce is truly awful. It's not at all authentic: it has a gelatinous look and feel and a bland taste. It's as if they use cheap yogurt containing gelatin instead of authentic Greek yogurt. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Gyro George is the real deal. I moved From NYC to Cleveland. Drove by on the way to a job and just happen to stop in to get one of the best gyros I have ever had. The owner super nice guy you definitely have to stop in this place instead of going to a chain or franchise. I'll be back often do you try everything on the menu. Very affordable seven dollars for lunch."}
{"text":"Ate here last week and got it to go....Superb Gyros... REAL tzatziki,....not that fake sour cream crap other gyro places use....stuffed with meat, lettuce, onions and 'maters  ...came back today for 2 fer Tuesday...two delicious rolls of Gyro for 6 bucks...WRONG!!!  I guess you have to get 'em to go for them to be any good.....and don't buy 'em on special...we got our plates with a warm pita base.....a FEW slices of  COLD meat....a sprinkling of lettuce...ONE ring of raw onion...that's ring...not slice.... and a cherry tomato cut in half...(where's the shocked eyes emoticon???)  Very unprofessional to lower the quantity and quality of your produce because you have it on special...give the customer what you give on everyday of the week....don't piss on us because you're doing a two fer deal....and change the grease in the fryer once in awhile."}
{"text":"Very good food  the portion is perfect , will fill you up just right . I got the rise n shine for 4.99. It's a very nice looking plate of eggs sausage hash and toast . Definitely will recommend to others . Family owned and the people are so nice . Will come again ."}
{"text":"Just went in found out the are reopen. Great food so much I had leftovers!! I going back again and even to grab something before I go into work.  I would highly recommend this place. Great food!!"}
{"text":"Yuck. Meat so old I actually thought they put bacon on my gyro. Three slivers of wilted lettuce and old tomatos. Probably late in the day and just old product but still.  Sidelines across the street has way better Gyros and it's a bar!  Lesson learned..."}
{"text":"their chicken gyros are THE best by far. I literally crave them now! my boyfriend and I highly recommend them."}
{"text":"Good gyros and fries. Breakfast is pretty great too.  If you go late enough you'll probably catch the guys sleeping. Just hurry and order your food and let them get back to sleep. Watch going after the bar closes. You'll end up with all the Parma tavern d bags"}
{"text":"Warning: Don't come here if you're on a diet, or you're screwed.  I love their breakfast, I actually crave it sometimes. $1.99 for a filling breakfast? YES PLEASE. I've frequent here a few times a month and only ever gotten breakfast, so I can't speak on behalf of their lunch and dinner items.   I'd eat the ham and cheese omelette everyday if I wouldn't die from coronary artery disease within a month. YUMMY!  Pretty sure it's family owned, lots of greeks.. always. But whatever, they're nice and they know how to make addiction-worthy hashbrowns - so I don't mind the family reunions in the dining area.   Bonus points: They're now open 24 hours. Why settle for Denny's when you're plastered? Your drunk ass deserves the best! Try this place out!"}
{"text":"This place is shit! The food is food. The cook does not use gloves at all. They touch all things, boxes, brooms, cabinets, and at times money. Then go right back to cooking. If the practice cleanliness this place would be much beget. Just because of the \"urban\" location, they can, an should be cleaner like at their other locations. Ijs..."}
{"text":"Very good breakfast menu. Service was prompt and they took care of us. They didn't seem jumping with glee to be at work, but they aren't sacrificing our experience because of it. I will way that some of the things they charge for is loopy. I was charged $.25 per 2oz cup of syrup. That was crazy. I'd vote it higher if not for the service and the charging of maple syrup."}
{"text":"For the 3rd time. Gyro George in North Olmsted is officially reopen for business"}
{"text":"My wife and I went there after getting a Groupon offer. While the quantity of food was great, the quality was so-so. The fries were greasey as were the \"chicken\" tenders.  The place has no air conditioning and the carpeting was dirty. If you must try them, get your food to go."}
{"text":"I used to get my gyro fix here when I lived with my friends in Shaker, well actually my post-bar food fix. The alternatives are slim in the early hours of the morning, but this place quickly won me over and had my repeat business for months until I moved crosstown. The building is quite dilapidated on the outside, and a bit dingy on the inside, but it's the product that matters here, and the product is pretty damn good at 2:30am. I've had gyros, burgers, polish boys, and assorted deep-fried fixins, all of which were satisfying as well as alcohol absorbing. I.e., just what I needed.  Check it out. It is what it is. And it's tasty!  I must also note, only because it makes me laugh, that at the more \"urban\" locations the  stylized/anthropomorphic Gyro George gyro mascot dresses the part. It rocks a \"double G\" chain, backwards fitted cap, and some fresh kicks. The gyro seems to have been cooked a bit longer too, giving it a darker complexion. The other locations feature a cartoon gyro with lighter pita exterior and less baller accessories. Just sayin!"}
{"text":"Breakfast was great. Fast service.  Only one place of toast for 3 eggs kinda sucked. Coffee is good. Right off the highway. Pretty convenient."}
{"text":"Very good. Co worker suggested 8 check this place out, cause I'm new to the area. Very worth it. Gyro sauce is different then most but is delicious.  Breakfast looks amazing. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Good gyros, made quick. No frills, no BS, just a good gyro, and what seems like homemade tzatziki, which judging on the outside, thought it might come out of a can.   The staff is friendly and efficient, and have a good product. The prices on the gyros seemed average, though Tuesday is buy one get one free. All the prices on the breakfast food looked really cheap, and this place has the feeling of a diner that does up everything right.   I was in and out in about two minutes since it doesn't take long to shave off gyro meat, but will be back for the convenience and quality."}
{"text":"had breakfast at Famous Gyro George last weekend and liked it quite a lot. as others have said, the decor needs to be updated.  breakfast portions were really big and the food was good. the potatoes used for the home fries could be seasoned more but overall a really good breakfast. My girlfriend and her mother and nieces also liked it and I'm sure we'll be back."}
{"text":"We were going to give this place another shot and came here at 10 PM on a friday night. ...And we saw a lady inside lock the doors as we approach the building.   Don't come after 10PM during the so-called 24hrs open days. They may lock the doors right in front of you."}
{"text":"the worst gyro I ever had and for mother's day? really? how do you NOT have feta cheese and call yourself Greek? what the hell!"}
{"text":"Glad to see it reopen. Bought two gyros...one a regular and the other was the big beast. Both looked good and tasted good. Couldn't believe the amount of meat and veggies that were on both gyros. I will go back to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Pretty good location on main street.  Gyros are the item to get.  Have had breakfast there but it is better at home.  They have raised the prices on the Gyro special twice in the last 2 years.  It used to be an excellent deal on Tuesdays 2 for 5, then 2 for 5.99, now it is 2 for $6.99.  Kept in mind it is only the lunch size gyro.  The fries are good, but they are deep fried and can be a little soggy.  Still they are good..  The seating is ample.  You do place your order at the counter and get your drink there but they will bring it to your table if you are dining in."}
{"text":"always great food, great service, quick turnaround, dine in....free soda refills.  would be 5 stars if they hadnt cut back on the gyro portions the last few years..."}
{"text":"I dont know why people are saying its dirty... when I went everything looked ok. The decor is outdated, and it kind of reminded me of my grandma's house. Yes, cluttered. But I didn't stay. I got my stuff to go.   First of all, it was the first time I had gone in to this establishment, Even though I have lived down the street from it for about 10 years now. I ordered the gyro platter, not really knowing what it was. $9.99. The portion was giant! I got fries (meh), onion rings (amazing onion rings), and a HUGE gyro piled high with meat, lettuce, etc. The gyro itself was good. I didn't finish it. I'm ordering a regular next time. I'll be eating that thing for days. I'll be sure to go back if I ever want gyros again but its nothing special."}
{"text":"I come here every once in a bluemoon to indulge on their cheap breakfast items. I just found out today that you cam call to order food and they have it ready. Ive had their gyros before and thought they were pretty good. This place has been at this location for as long as i remember and is open pretty late. I believe they serve breakfast at all times of the day. They also give you 5% off if you purchase using a debit/credit card.i havent had any bad experice here and i dont really plan on it.   One thing i dont like about this location is the street in front of the store as well as the parking lot. During heavy rain this place floods pretty bad and its something i notice when im just passing through."}
{"text":"best gyros in town! they are stuffed full and delicious. the sauce comes on the side which is a 10/10 for me!!! super friendly and great environment! the dining area was spotless!! definitely worth your money! i would give 10 stars if i could!"}
{"text":"The gyros are great, this is what they specialize in so no surprise there. Its everything else that sucks about this place. First let me start with how they fool you with the prices. Clearly placed signage says 3 cakes and 3 sausage for 2.99... I get in order the 2.99 plus 1egg w/cheese sub'd for a cake...6.49...wtf...second, the chicken is super tiny and dry as hell...8.99 wtf...the sausage taste cheap, like the kind you put in the microwave. The pancakes was just short of cornbread...I can only mess with buttermilk cakes fron this point on... Third, every table was wobbly, no cushion in the chairs, dirty dingy walls and booths...the place just felt and looked dirty...thank God for the smell of food in there...chicken, fries, the cleveland plus 2 drinks equaled 24 bucks...which also equal me never going back...its clearly not worth it..at all...save your money until they make some updates..."}
{"text":"I used to hate gyros.    Then I visited Famous George's.  Now I love gyros.  The gyros are damn good and cheap.  They serve some other stuff too (breakfast and chicken tenders and random stuff) but the gyros are king.  The only thing I wish they'd do a little differently are the fries.  A little too soggy and greasy for my taste.  Other than that, Famous George's is awesome."}
{"text":"Great order time. Never eaten anything of the menu besides breakfast. Which is always great."}
{"text":"I came to Famous Gyro George on a very cold night when the roads were slick. He could tell I was a Vegetarian when I ordered the Felafel. I took it to go and it did not take long; about 15 minute for take out.   It was the MOST DELICIOUS felafel that I have had in years (I'm in my mid 60's age wise). It was so good that after I finished it, I phoned the establishment to reorder another one but there was no answer and so I learned that they close at 8pm and are only open M-Saturday and closed Sunday.  I strongly recommend this place for their FELAFEL. I even went back today (Sunday) to order 2 more felafels, only to then see that they are close today. Well, it's only around 3 miles from work and it's right on my drive home; so hopefully tomorrow."}
{"text":"Gyros are pretty good-- I wouldn't get the beast again like I did last time, but it is nice they give you options. There's regular, jumbo and beast. Service is definitely not the most friendly but it is what it is. When I am in the mood for a gyro, it's a nice option to have for lunch since I only work down the street. Don't expect much when you eat inside, but I wouldn't say it was dirty or anything like some of the other reviews. Overall, I would say if you want a gyro- GO!"}
{"text":"I love gyro George the owner is excellent he takes pride in his restaurant and he always interact with the customers. The food is homemade and is always fresh I've been eating here for 2 years now and if I want a good gyro I come here. The breakfast is also very good and you can get plenty of great deals on meals here. Go Gyro George."}
{"text":"Agree with one of the reviews here-its in the middle of the industrial section on ridge rd. If you want a couple of Gyros to take out pretty quickly,  this,is the place. Sure, it looks worn out, but but it is what it is. Gyros,were good. Some days you don't want fancy lol ."}
{"text":"We are dealing with local chain, here.  The service at this location is pretty good.  The portions are varied when it comes to gyro.  This evening I received extra gyro meat and plenty of veggies too.  The mystery gyro meat was still in good shape, not dried out, the cucumber sauce was awesome, and fries were just about perfect.  The gyro combo at $8.99 is good value for dinner and could feed 2 with fries.  Of course, to one really hungry person, this also works.    If you are not subject to just dropping in, tuesday is 2 gyros for $5.99!"}
{"text":"Just had their lunch gyro special and it was pretty good.  I agree that the gyro sauce was bland, but that's OK.  Staff was helpful, I would go back"}
{"text":"The sauce was sour, pop tasted bad, ripped stalls, not busy and several tables had dirty dishes,  I don't think I will go back any time soon."}
{"text":"Perhaps back in the day this place was hot and happening but now it looks a bit drab and worn down. But I was determined to get a good corned beef sandwich that day. I ordered the biggest one they offered. It was a bit pricey for my taste, around 10 bucks, but like i said I was determined. The wait wasnt very long. The sandwich itself was huge! and as for the taste...DELICIOUS! After searching places around my little area for a good sandwich I finally found one! I will be definitely coming back here."}
{"text":"The question running through my head after eating here the other day was wondering why I willingly wasted my money eating here. I regret eating here and I won't come back again.  My siblings suggested going to eat here since they ate here frequently with friends. I wanted to try this place since I haven't been to this franchise before for gyros. When we got here there were only 1-2 cars and the place inside was empty. We got 2 Wednesday specials (each was 2 gyros, 2 burgers and fries for $10 so $20 total). We waited a bit for our food and the whole encounter was uncomfortable, the people who took our order weren't smiling or wanting to interact with us the whole time like they didn't want us there. As a business how do you expect to make money if you're not willing to serve your customers, especially being the only ones in the store?? It didn't make sense to me.We took our food to go and ate at home.  When we got home the french fries were limp and mushy, but understandable since we got the fries to go (however, I've gotten fries to go before and were still crispy by the time I get home). Then when I tried one of the burgers, the patty was very thin and it was mostly lettuce yet the burger was very greasy for me (barely a burger without the meat). The tzatziki sauce for the gyro didn't taste like what tzatziki sauce should taste like at all, very watery and bland like diluted cream. The only redeeming feature of this meal was the gyro. The meat in the gyro was good and the pita was soft but that wasn't enough to persuade me to eat there again.  In general, this place was more of a quantity over quality place. If you wanted to come here to get a lot of food at a low price, you would probably like going here for the Wednesday deal. Otherwise, I wouldn't bother coming to waste your money on something that isn't a gyro."}
{"text":"Refused to give me a plate today to eat my lunch . . . \"If you want a plate it's a $1.00 more\".  Balding man mid 40s working the counter told me today.  Don't go here with rude service like this!"}
{"text":"Famous Gyro George is a place that I have gone by a few times without thinking twice about it. I was with a friend and the subject of how amazing breakfast was came up and I remembered about this place. Thanks god I did. The place might look a little shabby on the outside, but the inside is very nice and has that diner feel. We were immediately were greeted by a very nice lady. We ordered breakfast and sat down. She talked to us while we were waiting for our food and despite paying ahead at the counter, she served us water at our table. I got my breakfast before my friend and as soon as a I smelled it I couldn't wait till my friend got his. The hash browns with onions were incredible and the eggs and sausage were cooked to perfection. It was one of the best breakfasts I have ever had. The total price for three eggs, three sausages, texas toast, and hash browns with onions? $4.70. An incredible deal. I'm definitely coming back sometime soon to try out their gyros and other foods."}
{"text":"They used to have great breakfast potatoes.  About 7 years ago, the fried potatoes for breakfast were the bomb.  Then they added some allspice type seasoning and ruined them.  When I asked to,get some made without it, the argued with me to the point I just walked out.  Decided to give it a try today, called first, and was assured I could get them without.  The main order seemed to still have something on them.  Will not be returning.  Let the customer decide what they want on them please.  2 stars.  Their bacon is good, and they have Texas Toast which is why they got the 2 stars."}
{"text":"Over the course of the last year, something has changed. The quality of the food appears to be on the decline.   Got a couple of gyros and what they call a philly steak sandwich. Gyros were bland. The sauce has gotten to the point where it seems it is just thinned out sour cream. The philly steak shared nothing with an actual one, except the name. Swiss cheese, gyro meat, onions, and mushrooms on a bun. It was ok, but definitely not what was expected.  Place was empty, and this was at 7pm on a Friday night. Every place near them was busy. Guess this is a sign. Probably have had our last meal here. Too bad, because it was a great place to eat a decade ago."}
{"text":"Gyros are great heaping portions and they even have a lunchtime special for $2.99 but this place is very unclean....I watched them cook it and took my food home to eat it."}
{"text":"The 2.49 breakfast special is awesome!!! Eggs,sausage,Texas toast, and homefries. Coffee extra. But with tip you are out the door for less than 5 bucks."}
{"text":"Decent food , I bought the same gyro kit from Aldi . Pita bread was dry . Little bit dirty place inside ."}
{"text":"This IS NOT HEALTH FOOD!  F.G.G.'s is a Fast Food Gyro delight!  Great Gyro's.  Good combination platters.  Excellent Specials.    You know what you are going to get when you go here.  The staff there is special.  I do not know how else to put it.  I am assuming they are Greek....this is their baby and they truly own it in the sense of adding their personality to it.  Its not fancy dining by any strech, but its great for what it offers.  The menu selection is HUGE.  Sadly I have never eaten anything else there b/c I am obsessed with their Gyro's.  Everytime I go there I simply think to myself \" I wish I could\"  anyways....they have Great Gryo's.  I think you should give them a try"}
{"text":"Best gyros around. They have great fries and various sizes of gyros. I haven't been to their other locations but this one is great. Tiny little dive on the inside but so delicious. Great prices too."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time or money here. The customer service is terrible and they think it's no big deal to find hair in your food!"}
{"text":"Friend, you think you've seen a greasy spoon? THIS is a greasy spoon. Of course, this place mainly does gyros (it's called Gyro George's, duh). A friend suggested we hit this place before seeing a movie in the area, and I can't totally complain about his suggestion.   The gyro I ordered was just what I would have expected from one of my favorite N.Y.C. gyro carts back in the day, and the chicken wings he ordered, one or two of which I stole when he was in the bathroom, were pretty freakin' great.   Like I said, don't expect to be blown away by ambiance. You can smell the grease in the air, and it's located right next to a towing company that brought back some pretty painful personal memories. That said, what do you want for five bucks? The Louvre?"}
{"text":"Its Gyro George.  Best TV commercials ever.  Gyros are OK.  Gyro omlettes are dope.  Not really up to most Yelpers standards but if the put \"gastropub\" or some bullshit in the name , people will flock..."}
{"text":"First off go to the one on Harvard Ave off I-77 in Cleveland. The others aren't nearly as good or giving in their portions. its open 24/7 every Friday and Saturday and I can tell you that you will hear the funniest conversations between all races. The food is delicious, the decor outdated and the staff ambivalent at best...but the food is AMAZING. If you go on 2 for Tuesday or 3 for Friday be prepared for the food to be a little cold as its pre-made. Just stick the meat in an oven at 200 for 10 mins and it will be fine. I love this place and go once every two weeks. Give them a try and support your locally owned establishments."}
{"text":"I was quite surprised when I walked up to the counter with four breakfast orders written on paper and said I wanted to place an order for carry out.  This unwelcoming, rude women said no, too much.  I asked what the difference would be if four guests that were seated at a table each ordered breakfast.  A young man (maybe her son) said it's okay.  Then she stared to argue with him.  He started ringing the order in on the register while she kept telling me too much, too much and giving me the stink eye.  Will never bother them again with a $37 order.  Rude!"}
{"text":"Aghh, mediocre gyro, but the onion rings were delicious.  Tried both the chicken gyro which was quite dry and the jumbo gyro which was just not as good as others I've had recently. Wish they had fried mushrooms on the menu."}
{"text":"Really good breakfast, hot food, prompt service by courteous staff!  The gyro breakfast is especially good!  We do not eat the morning meal out often, but FGG is one place we will go to!"}
{"text":"gross .. this place is FILTHY .. I was scouting out a table to eat at as my husband waited in line to place our order & each & every table was sticky & dirty .. so b/4 ordering I feared about the cleanliness of the kitchen & opted to not get food poisoning so we left b/4 ordering any food .. the Heath Department would spend a day in this joint writing up violations .."}
{"text":"Owner is very nice and really loads the gyros up with meat. The beast when taken to go fills the entire bottom of the to go container with meat/tomatoes/onion. Very good spot. Breakfast is also very reasonable, only a few dollars for eggs hashbrowns and gyro meat. Well definitely continue to go here."}
{"text":"Kitchen is nasty.   Gyro meat was dry like had been sitting around a while.  I won't be back"}
{"text":"Found a metal washer in our food.. so disgusting. When I called they didn't seem to care."}
{"text":"Only giving a star rating because this won't let you post without it. This was the worst experience I've ever had at any restaurant. Attempting to order and you can't see the menu because of the glare from the lights. Don't worry though. The guy taking your order won't help you by telling you what is on the menu or offer any other solution. Then when you get what you order it will either be over cooked or reheated from earlier and that sandwich you ordered will be nothing but toppings. Never returning. Total waste of money and time. Next time going to Happy's across the street."}
{"text":"I love gyro George!! Come on a Tuesday and get 2 gyros for $6.99!! Everyday there is an awesome special, including breakfast! Check out the decor, some awesome vintage finds and retro pax man while you wait!"}
{"text":"Drove by the other day, and decided to stop in for a quick, inexpensive meal.  Great unassuming little place, with flavorful large gyros and gyro sauce (tzatziki?)!  The service was great too, and it has a dining area too.  This is fast food with a non fast food taste!  Going back again soon."}
{"text":"I'll admit, I did not expect much after walking in the door. This is one of the  divey-ist places I have ever been to. REALLY a \"don't judge a book by the grease on the front\" sort of place. All that being said, the moment I bit in to that messy gyro filled with tzatziki sauce goodness, I found love in a hopeless place. No wait, that's Rihanna... It still fits.   Man, was that good food! Between the low price to food quantity ratio, I was in a very greasy heaven. On Tuesdays they even have two gyros for 6.99! Take my money! The fries...oh the heaping pile of fries. Just delicious! Everything I ate here was wonderful.   My only complaint is the decor. Please please give this restaurant a little love, or maybe just take down the titanic picture and turn off the infomercials. Rose and Jack in a sad embrace next to jazzercise women from the 80's, not great for food consumption. I'm glad I looked past the exterior and got in to the deliciousness, but I don't know a lot of others who can. Just a little love George's way. I hope his name is George or this restaurant title is misleading..."}
{"text":"Live locally and have never tried it. Today I did and was impressed. Got a gyro to go and thought it was good. Friendly service also!"}
{"text":"This review is for the Gyro only.  This was the best Gyro I have ever had.  The meat was perfect.  Too often with gyros, the meat is too crispy on the outside and is too dry to eat.  The gyro today, was perfectly moist and will be ordered again.  The gyro came with fresh cut fries, which, while good, were overshadowed by the gyro."}
{"text":"a Gyro George gyro has all the appeal of a plateful of shit. it certainly looks like one. even their tv commercials make their gyros look like partially solid diarrhea. im not joking. its that gross. anyone who would eat this crap is beyond common sense. the brunswick location is probably the worst. they don't even put the gyro in a pita and wrapper, but simply lay it on a styrofoam plate with onions and lettuce. gimme a break. why does cleveland make such awful gyros. if you want a good gyro, go to any Greek church festival in the summer- there are several. they have real Greek food, not the crap slopped up in 'Greek' fast food joints."}
{"text":"Sorry -- meant to post this one for the Brunwick location, not Parma...this location was not open New Year's Day    You know, the cool thing about places like this is that you pretty much know what you're getting going in and there are no surprises. So, if you're looking for a place to brunch  with Buffy and Misty and the other girls from the club, uh, pick somewhere else.   IF, on the other hand, you're looking for a no-frills, bang-for-your-buck type of place (and aren't a card-carrying member of the clean police), this be the place.   So, it's New Year's Day and I was jonesing for a Gyro. I eat maybe two a year. And today, for some reason, I had to have one. And thanks to my buddy, Steve, for telling there was a Famous Gryo George in Brunswick, a quick 20 minutes from where I live. By the way, if any of you need THE best auto/truck/boat detailer around (and he comes to YOU), send me a note and I'll share his contact info. If that's not yelp-friendly apologies to management and feel free to strike this part.   Anyway, drove to B-wick and found FGG in what looked like an old Friendly's or something similar.  The nice lady at the counter took my order, gave me a tray and said they'd bring the food out.  Got just a regular gyro (they have many platters and sizes) and found it to be EXACTLY what I had a taste for. Nice, flavorful meat sitting on top of a yummy pita or whatever they call it, lettuce, tomatoes, and yogurt sauce on the side. It was kinda too big to eat like a sandwich so I just used my knife and fork, which were perfect examples of \"no-frills.\" See, they WERE metal, but when I started cutting the fork bent in my hand. OK, they are metal--or barely metal-or a metal lookalike. Who cares; they did the job.   Got a chance to see plenty of other dishes as the place was busy and everything looked very good. Paid 5.99 for a regular gyro and worth every penny. And I saw a sign saying that on Tuesday's it's two for one! You are not going to beat that.   Oh, and I brought home bakalava. Haven't tried it yet but it looks absolutely gorgeous plus it's about the size of a hubcap. OK, not quite that big but it's at least twice the size of what I usually see.   So, steer the Club Girls elsewhere--unless they love honest food and killer gyros at very reasonable prices. In that case, they'll love Famous Gyro George just like the rest of us."}

The nice lady at the counter took my order, gave me a tray and said they'd bring the food out.  Got just a regular gyro (they have many platters and sizes) and found it to be EXACTLY what I had a taste for. Nice, flavorful meat sitting on top of a yummy pita or whatever they call it, lettuce, tomatoes, and yogurt sauce on the side. It was kinda too big to eat like a sandwich so I just used my knife and fork, which were perfect examples of \"no-frills.\" See, they WERE metal, but when I started cutting the fork bent in my hand. OK, they are metal--or barely metal-or a metal lookalike. Who cares; they did the job.   Got a chance to see plenty of other dishes as the place was busy and everything looked very good. Paid 5.99 for a regular gyro and worth every penny. And I saw a sign saying that on Tuesday's it's two for one! You are not going to beat that.   Oh, and I brought home bakalava. Haven't tried it yet but it looks absolutely gorgeous plus it's about the size of a hubcap. OK, not quite that big but it's at least twice the size of what I usually see.   So, steer the Club Girls elsewhere--unless they love honest food and killer gyros at very reasonable prices. In that case, they'll love Famous Gyro George just like the rest of us."}
{"text":"They raised their prices.  I don't know if it's the fact they are open 24 hours or just felt the need to increase their prices because the prices you see in the pictures and menu here have pretty much all been raised.  The food is still decent though.         The other Gyro George I usually visit is the location on Euclid.  One of my favorite things to order is a Polish Boy and a small container of Gyro meat to go.  Their Polish Boy is still around $5 with the side of Gyro meat for around $3 on top of receiving a small little extra sauce cup of coleslaw for the Polish Boy for well under $10.  The Polish Boy at this establishment is now $7.99 and their to go portion of Gyro meat in the same container was around $5 and I didn't realize until later I was charged more for extra tzatziki sauce!  My entire order was around $13!  Basically $5 more for the same food I would get at the Euclid location.  I figured this location had raised their prices due to the fact that it was open 24 hours and that's expensive for any establishment to achieve and maintain.        Even though I paid more, I didn't mind actually.  A good Polish boy and fresh Gyro meat at 3:30am is definitely worth it.  The reason I came here is because the two Taco Bell's around this location both closed early on a Sunday night/Monday morning by almost 2 hours at one of the locations.  They must've been slow because after working in fast food myself a lifetime ago, if you do not maintain a certain amount of customers after so long according to their profit potential, they will close early.  So, that's something to be expected.  Since I was in the area, I used the Yelp app and found this place still open and I do love a good Polish boy sandwich so I gave them a try.        Overall, I would give this establishment 4 stars for just being an all around decent place to eat but since the other Gyro George locations are still cheaper I feel that this location loses a star because price is important.  It's not too fancy, dated interior works but I would go to Gyro George rather than Denny's after midnight.  If I ever get a 3am craving for a Polish boy, I do know where to go now."}
{"text":"I ate off the truck on Euclid. Everything was really good, fresh, and inexpensive. Jumbo Gyro and fries. Nice and greasy but not the bad kind of greasy."}
{"text":"I love this place. The employees are super friendly and out going always smiling.. I stop by a few times a week for breakfast and coffee and a couple times a month for lunch. The big azz breakfast is the best deal in town"}
{"text":"What a rip-off.  Paid  $5 for a \"Big BLT\" 3 pieces of bacon, 3 little shreds of lettuce, and 2 tomato chips. Won't be back. Stay away."}
{"text":"This has to be one of the best gyro George restaurants I've ever been to!  nice and Tall tables and comfortable seating they also have two flat screen TVs. The staff is very friendly and the restaurant is spotless clean I can  recommend this place for quick dining. Service is very fast for takeout!"}
{"text":"I'll admit, this place is like a blast from the past & could use a little tlc but otherwise my experience here was a pleasant surprise. Although I only got the fresh cut fries, the were definitely made to order; hot & fresh...could've been a smidgen more crispy but delicious overall. My husband loved his gyro & said it was better than any of the places back home near Stow.   But I'd have to say the best part about our visit was the owner. He seemed a bit abrupt at first when he took our order but turned out to be very sweet and interesting to speak with. He took time out of his busy day & made sure my husband & I were happy with his food and really got to know us. Good old fashioned customer service is almost non existent these days & his encouraging words were greatly welcomed. If this location wasn't an hour or more away my family & I would gladly return."}
{"text":"During a health crisis and having been at the Hospital for days, we stopped by Gyro George, against my will, to have breakfast.  Now the inside is still a little dated, but the breakfast was outstanding.  Very economical, and well prepared.  The home fries with onion were beyond great, eggs cooked to order.  Because this was so good, we are updating our review.  It has been almost two years since we first posted and they have done some work with the cooking.  And while I was here, staff From Gallucci's were ordering breakfast.  That says something!"}
{"text":"This is another one of those difficult reviews to write because the food was good. I enjoyed my gyro- cooked perfectly, seasoned well and with a great cool tzatziki sauce. I was comfortable with the price of the lunch special- gyro, fries and a drink for $8.  The cleanliness of Gyro George's is a whole different story. Everything was covered with some form of filth. The tables were all littered or sticky, the station where drinks and condiments live was disgusting and the floors were sticky. but don't worry, because towards the end of the lunch rush, they'll come through and mop the entire place with a bucket of water that has an overwhelming chemical smell. I tried holding my breath until I could leave, but it wasn't enough.  He was literally mopping under people's feet and then didn't put up a wet floor sign.  The condition of the restaurant was enough to keep me away."}
{"text":"The gyro meat is well seasoned. The eggs are cooked to perfection. The hash browns are crisp. My daughter loves their pancakes. You order the food and pay up front. They give you your cups and bring the food out when it is ready. We've never had a problem with their service. They keep my coffee cup full but DO NOT bother you every few minutes like most places. If you want something else you just go up front and ask."}
{"text":"The gyro meat is good for what it is. They have decent breakfast specials if you can get there before noon. Then there is another set of breakfast specials that end at 1. You can get 3 eggs and hash browns for $4 and some change. If you get there super early, maybe before 9 or something, they have a breakfast special of 2 eggs, 2 sausage links (or bacon), hash browns and toast for $2!"}
{"text":"The is food very bad save your self eat some where else.and the people that work there are dummies it like one big rat hole next too two junk yard and the Cleveland dump.save your self eat some where else"}
{"text":"And Zeus proclaimed, \"Come now and gorge!\" Like the sirens luring Ulysses, this clarion call spelled certain doom for my hunger. Backstory: I never noticed gyro places that serve breakfast, lunch and dinner till I started driving an ambulette through Cleveland's worst neighborhoods in 2005. Up till then I thought gyros only came around with the county fair or East 185th street festival. I didn't know city dwellers craved gyros so much. It was quite a revelation.  The first one I always saw was by Indian Hills in the East Cleveland/ Euclid/ Cleveland demilitarized zone. Lovely neighborhood. Fast forward to 2009. I'm now a west sider and the Greek Village Grille opens up. Gyro prayers answered. This kept me satisfied until I saw the late night tv ads, followed by the Superbowl ad. That amazing jingle, that hypnotic belly dancing toilet paper roll alleged to be a gyro. This was the Norton furniture of Greek cuisine! I always told myself that if I craved smashed up lamb face, I was gonna hit this place up.  And all these years later I finally went. On an eight degree winter Sunday morning. I got the jumbo and breakfast for the wife. It was still piping hot by the time I got back to Lakewood some 20 minutes later. That's good to go containers! They're embossed with the logo btw. Collector's item. Was hoping maybe they had tee shirts. Didn't see any. I could always make one. I've been meaning to make an Arslanian Brothers tee since I was like ten. Anyhow, the food is solid, staff friendly and price point low. Pretty much the kind of place that gets my repeat business. Do I want a bumper sticker of the gyro for the whip? Fuck yes I do. Way cooler than those lame-o Malley's stickers. I climbed the Mount Olympus of calories and slew the minotaur dwelling in the labyrinth of my stomach."}
{"text":"The people working here are weird. They take no interest in you whatsoever. It's like they're thinking...there are so many places to eat why are they bothering us? Speaking of weird so is the food. I ordered eggs, sausage, and hashbrowns. It looked good, and that's the only good thing I can say about it. It was totally blasé and I'm being kind. When I got the check I apologized for bothering them on there day off. Got the same expression she gave me when I walked in.   Now I know why there is never more than two cars in the parking lot. Only be one if they carpooled."}
{"text":"This food gave me a serious stomach ache. It tasted mediocre & the \"aftermath\" was terrible. My husband bought us gyros and I had the chicken gyro with lettuce and tomato. Not good.   If you're in Slavic Village, go to Wendy's, or Mr. Hero, or the Red Chimney is far better than this!!"}
{"text":"I keep going back here again and again because the food is always greasy and offensive -superb. The service is appropriately tense and aggressive. For a gyro place, perfect.  The Pepsi products are a bit more expensive than at some other places, but the food is quite reasonable when you consider all the steps involved in turning several animals into a fifty pound wheel of reconstituted  flesh. (Their portions are quite large, even the small gyro or chicken 'meat' sandwich.)  The tables are a bit too slick with grease and close together, but the acoustics are pretty good since no one is ever there so you don't hear other people's conversations like at some other restaurants.  I've been to George's other restaurants and I like them too, with the exception of the \"Famous Gyro George\" bistro in Olmsted Falls and the Parma locations, and only because the Greek chatter gets way too loud for me."}
