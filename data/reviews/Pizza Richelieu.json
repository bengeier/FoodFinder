{"text":"I tried out Pizza Richelieu after reading Jennifer B.'s recommendation.  All I can say is that the pizza was simply scrumptious and delicious.  I only came here to take out an order, so I can't comment on the restaurant area.  What I can vouch for is the pizza, which is mouth-watering and has the most delicious savoury sauce.  Underneath the mountain of toppings and cheese, the crust did end up getting a little soggy... so much so that the grease leaked out of the box right on to my crisp white shirt!  I was horrified at the grease stains when I got out of the car, but after eating a slice, I forgot all about it because... YES, the pizza was THAT GOOD.    I'm telling you, there must be some sort of magic in that stone oven for me to overlook the stains on my lovely top!  I'll definitely be back the next time I'm in the area... only this time, with a gigantic plastic bag to protect me from the grease!"}

{"text":"Had one vegetarian pizza, kinda disappointed me, it's super dry and feel like it's from some fast food restaurants. Personally don't recommend this places for pizzas, don't know other food though"}
{"text":"Pour les environ, meilleur pizza en ville!"}
{"text":"Était très bon avant mais plusieurs petites déceptions maintenant... Plus de jus de pommes ou d'Orange pour les enfants, les portions ont rapetissé, doigts de poulet trop cuits, plus de frites avec les repas d'enfants... Et méfiez-vous des ailes de poulet: dégoûtantes. La pizza est toujours bonne... Mais vaut mieux la manger chez soi."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza - fait dans les règles de l'art !"}
{"text":"The pizza here is amazing!  All the food is made from scratch.  The pizza sauce and crust are very good and the toppings are fresh.  Don't just come here for the pizza get the salad and desert.  They are also amazing!  This place is like having a home cooked quality meal, without doing all the work!  I would highly suggest eating here."}
{"text":"Tout simplement le meilleur resto en ville, je n'ai jamais été décu et j'y mange depuis des années !"}
