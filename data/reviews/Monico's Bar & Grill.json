{"text":"Great food service was good but small and parking is a problem after I have been there several time I started to go in on a Saturday afternoon with my grandchildren and was stopped when I opened the door and was told I had to leave no one under the age of 18 which I didn't know it was a problem so I haven't been back because the bartender was rude not saying I won't go back just felt it could have been handled better and more respectful"}
{"text":"Pretty small little hole in the wall bar, but the food here is really, really good. I don't frequent here a ton just because it's too smokey for my liking but our golf league will stop by for food sometimes and everything is typically really good. The french dip is my go to, but I've also enjoyed the pizza (white pizza is great as well) and they are known for their \"stuffed breads\". It's basically like a stromboli or calzone.. the buffalo chicken one is killer!"}
{"text":"Fun, neighborhood-style bar where everyone knows your name or are ready to make a new friend.  It's located along a 3 way intersection, which can serve as a nice reminder to stop in as you pass by.  Inside, there is a large, square-shaped bar in the center of the room which is surrounded by a few booths and small tables.  Cozy surroundings, and there are several TV's set up around the room to catch the current sports game.   Nice variety of menu items to choose from. Homemade soups are usually the go to, along with their Antipasta Bread.   It consists of everything that a antipasta is prepared with, but is wrapped, and baked inside bread dough, and is served with a side of dipping oil.  Superb is the word!  Monico's is a nice spot to go to for a quick drink and to have a chance to catch-up with the local news of the day.   Note:  Smoking is permitted and parking can be tight."}
{"text":"Yea, been here a few times, definitely not enough to become established as a \"local.\"  It's o.k., not much else around.  The food that I have tried is pretty typical bar food.  Actually, the only thing really worth trying in my opinion are the breads.  Which are actually very good.  Their wings are absolutely awful.  Frozen, breaded and simply nasty.  But the breads and a few of the sandwiches are really good.  Not much room to move around and It's dark and dingy.  It's doesn't smell, too bad.  If you are a guy you don't have to worry about putting on your Sunday bests, that's for sure.  Watch out for Plum police who are always sneaking around the roads near by."}
