{"text":"2.50 millers at night, live music and a new lounge area. the food is wicked too. Steven, one of the chefs, make amazing food. some of my favorites are the chinese take out burrito and the new og burger burrito. it has an awesome atmosphere that doesnt draw the annoying college crowd."}
{"text":"This place is one restaurant - C.A.S.A/Sun Ba with two different locations split up by Munchies and Slices on Mill.  I went to the Sun Ba about a month ago (used to be the former Chronic Taco) and their menu sucked.  They gave a lot of excuses that they 'weren't officially opened yet' and their new location would be the more relaxed bar/restaurant with more food.  Today we went to the new location and the same exact menu and same excuses.  And whomever is coming up with their food names needs to take a Spanish 101 class (El Chorro translates into diarrhea).  Won't be coming back here again."}
{"text":"I've been there twice and had very poor service both times.  I also got food poisoning from one of their salads this past weekend.  I will never go back!  Read the worst reviews posted here.  They may sound like horror stories but they are the average customer experience at CASA.  Stay away!"}
{"text":"YUM. I eat here at least once a week because  cant get enough of the Humanitarian which is grilled veggies, hummus, and chicken.  They  usually have a neat craft beer to offer. . We usually have Brittany as our server and she rocks the house They have switched to an all burrito menu and the concepts are pretty unique.. I like the fact that you can for go the tortilla and just eat the filling. Their green chili mac and cheese is to DIE FOR. The chef  even comes  table side to ensure you've enjoyed your meal. They did make some changes but life is about change and the food is good enough to adapt."}
{"text":"I love the OG burritos! Unfortunately I was treated very rudely over the phone. I work on mill and wanted to do a quick to go order over the phone, when I called to place the order they started the new menu and weren't serving burritos for the evening. I asked what was being served and he responded tacos I needed a little more detail and asked what kind, the gentlemen responded he had no time to speak with me over the phone and no time for the phone call. So naturally I said ok and he hung up. Very disappointing coming from a loyal customer"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Great service, great food, nice and refreshing place to hang out! Oh and the server Thomas is absolutely fabulous!!"}
{"text":"CASA is a disappointment.  It's really hard to understand how the managers of this place can allow such inept staff.  The bar itself is perfectly situated in the heart of tempe and is composed entirely of patio seats.  You would think that you really couldn't go wrong with a setup like this in sunny Tempe, AZ. 

Service:  Unfortunately, the owners/managers have decided on a staff of security and bar tenders who would rather talk to each other then make sure that their guests are enjoying themselves.  Their waitress although pleasant and apologetic cannot seem to get you a drink in under 15 minutes and will likely forget an item or two off your order.  I don't know if they are woefully understaffed or they are just slowed down due to their chatty staff and the fact that their kitchen is actually located at a neighboring bar two doors down!

Drinks:  It truly is a shame their staff is terrible because their drinks can be quite good.  I love their mojito I just don't when or if I will actually get one do to their ineffective staff

Food:  Their food is a big miss.  Basically they have decided to take random cuisines and repurpose them as burritos.  Fettuccine Alfredo burrito?  Thanksgiving dinner burrito?  Chicken in broccoli maybe? I really don't know what they are thinking.

This location has so much promise I hope the management can turn it around but after visiting this place 4 or 5 times it doesn't look like it's going to happen."}
{"text":"Food was amazing. We loved the vegan options. Would give this place 5 stars if it wasn't for the horrible service. 

We had to grab the servers attention constantly and remind them what we just asked for last time they came by. I mean come on. It wasn't that busy. Made the experience a lot less enjoyable. I was a server before and there is just no excuse. 

So if you have plenty of time and patience maybe it would be worth it for you because the food is fantastic.."}
{"text":"Checked this place out a few nights ago. Since it's spring break at ASU, I imagine every bar on Mill was nowhere near capacity. This place had a smallish, chill crowd with a relaxed vibe. I imagine when all the students get back, that could change. I thought the layout was nice, with a prominent bar smack in the center. Ordering drinks was easy and the bartenders were laid back. I'd definately give this place another visit."}
{"text":"Don't expect good service here.  This was my third time is the charm visit and they failed.  We sat there with empty glasses at the bar and got passed for 20 min.  When we finally asked for our check it took another 15 min.  I'd go into detail about my previous times here but it's not worth it.  I'll just say this was right on par.  So long CASA."}
{"text":"Usually great but tried showing mom around my college town and went upstairs after grad night and the girl bartender was too busy on her phone to care about making money! Okay! Bye!!"}
{"text":"I loved this place! I got the guacamole, which was delicious and way above average. For my entrée, I got the Vegan Carne Asada with added portabellas-it was nothing short of awesome! There was a great selection of beers on tap, as well and the bartender was super friendly and the service great. This will be the first place I visit the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Terrible I waited with my friend for 20 min. Could not even get a hello and we sat in the middle of the bar in front of 3 bartenders. Worst ever so we moved on. Over crowded and over rated. I would skip this stop."}
{"text":"I've got to dock this place one star. I absolutely HATE when people knock a new restaurant for bad service. It's inevitable that a brand new spot will have some growing pains while training everyone, dealing with turnover, figuring out the menu, the p.o.s., etc. So, I didn't begrudge C.A.S.A. some pretty bad service to start.

The thing is though, it hasn't improved over the last few months. I'd like to preface this by saying there are a few nice, competent, friendly servers there (they're both brunette women - try to sit in their section), but the majority of the servers are just bad. I doubt many of their servers have prior serving experience as many of them only perform one task at a time. Let me explain. We (a group of two) arrived at the same time as the table next to us. The server greeted them, took their drink order, put it in and WAITED AT THE BAR for the drinks to be made before giving them their drinks and making his way over to us. You don't have to be a career server to know that this is a massive waste of time. The restaurant was absolutely empty - dude had two tables - yet he managed to simulate the experience of dining at an overcrowded and understaffed restaurant.

In addition to the bad service, the food has gotten worse. The vegan carne asada was so ridiculously good the first time I ate at C.A.S.A., but it seems to get drier, blander, and smaller every time we come. Unfortunately, it doesn't look like we'll be back too often."}
{"text":"Came to casa 2 weeks in a row on a Wednesday night with friends. Wore a pair of black cat Jordan 13's and was let in last week no mention of a dress code. This Monday came back only to order a vegan item from their menu wearing a pair of Jordan 6's and was turned away because \"jordans are against dress code\". I pointed out to the bouncer that I had been in last week wearing Jordan retros and his excuse was too specific to be believable, but trust will not be trying to get in ever again. Be careful shaggy haired bouncers wearing teeshirts with holes and 99cent flip flops will turn you away because apparently the money you have only spends well at footlocker and house of hoops. Will gladly take my $, j's and challenger to buy food and liquor from a place that doesnt use salty discretion to allow customers in on a week by week basis. This place is a joke, not a bar or restaurant if you have any doubts the atmosphere and food are definitely not worth the risk of possibly being able to spend your money here.

*Updated*
Didnt even think it was due to racism but after reading further reviews it all makes sense. The last visits I made to this place were with a large group of white friends. I am actually (believe it or not) half black and half white but extremely fair skinned and wear my hair straightened almost all the time. This week when I returned the only difference was my company. Rather than being with a crowd of white friends I attempted to get in with my clearly black, but mixed half white half black boyfriend. If you're anything other than black go ahead and try this place wearing whatever you would like. What your wearing has absolutely no affect on getting in this place unless it is your skin."}
{"text":"Great food and drinks, vegan options!  Staff was very friendly and helpful. Absolutely loved this place!"}
{"text":"I've been to C.A.S.A. many times.  I work on mill & even tho there are tons of bar options, I just like coming back.  The vibe here is great & they play awesome reggae.  $2 coronas is a plus, they have some cute waitresses (Ashley is my fav), & they have a gluttonous burrito that's the bomb!!!  Mac n cheese (add chix, bacon & green chiles).   They are new, juggling growing pains & massive crowds so the service isn't 100% perfect (thus 4 stars) but I've had pretty damn good experiences when there.  This is probably why I've been nearly 10 times in the last month."}
{"text":"Only giving this place 1 star because I can't give then 0. Been here multiple times and each time was extremely disappointed. Expensive drinks, poor service, and food is nothing special. This place has great potential with its location but needs a change."}
{"text":"The bar and atmosphere was whatever, but I give this place 5 stars for service. Came out to Phoenix for a road trip and have been getting crap service everywhere we went. Casa was a thankful refresher from that. Our server was Amber and she was absolutely amazing. She was constantly checking on us and was more than friendly about different places to go and see. Not sure if the other servers are as good as her, but she was the best."}
{"text":"Had the vegan carne asada 2 days in a row there and thought it was amazing! BUT I became so violently ill that I thought I had food poisoning. Something in the food was either not properly stored or maybe it wasn't vegan but steer clear!!! Had horrible bowel reactions, couldn't keep food down, appetite give for 4 days, head hurt severely, horrible! Almost went the ER..."}
{"text":"Used to love this place but the service has gone way down. Many of the servers have bad attitudes and wont come take your order even when they aren't busy. My friends and I sat at a table right across from the bar and didn't get any service. We had to go to the bar for menus but even after that no one came to get our drink order."}
{"text":"Beer was good, Moscow Mule was good. There are two very serious problems though: 1) There is only one bathroom, one toilet, unisex. 2) It is downwind of a large dumpster. The entire bar smelled like a dumpster. I had to put my shirt over my nose to keep the smell out. If you can deal with the smell and the bathroom, you're golden."}
{"text":"the host was nice! But we got a table they had no drinks on the 2nd bar the person never came back to take our order we wanted to order drinks/food and she saw us but just kept talking to some random person and ran out of water! ya water! so we left!! 

Never going back sorry"}
{"text":"C.A.S.A. is the shit! Had my shot of Jameson, my craft pils and ordered the pulled pork burrito loaded with potato salad, mac & cheese. Their burritos are huge. If you haven't been, GO! Definitely going back."}
{"text":"I really liked the atmosphere here-- the seating was really open, and it seems the owners were strategic about how they would shade the area during the day. Kudos for creative simplicity.

Music is fun-- I wasn't familiar with all the music but a friend of mine said some of it was the cumbia and reggaeton he listened to in middle school 10 years ago.

Overall really laid back place without being dive-y. I'll definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool. I like unique food and this place delivers. Their burritos are different then anywhere else. Who puts green chili pork and mac n cheese in a burrito? These guys do. If you want some good burritos that are very unique this is the place for you. 

I agree with some of the other reviews, the service isn't the best but it is not the worst either. Check it out."}
{"text":"Love this place! The homemade salsa is amazing and the atmosphere of this place is super laid back and inviting. I ordered the chicken burrito bowl- delicious. I have also had the pleasure of enjoying their famous Mac n cheese burrito... AMAZING! The service was great; our waiter, Thomas, was very attentive and on point. 


If you enjoy awesome and creative food and delicious drinks then C.A.S.A. is for you! Forgot about these haters and create your own experience and opinion."}
{"text":"Casa is great! Our server Holly was great! They have these things called buckets of booze (100oz of booze for ten bucks) and they make them strong. Really relaxed atmosphere, they play reggae and remixes. Crowded for a Tuesday night, great fun. Recommend for anyone!! Cheers!!"}
{"text":"Wow the chicken caesar was so good and all that I wanted from a wrap and more!! Great service and great food :)"}
{"text":"Food & drinks are overpriced, service is shoddy, only redeeming factor is the location/setup."}
{"text":"Wouldn't recommend this place with all the other competition on mill ave. they used to have a whole vegan menu with numerous selections. I see they have a new owner or management now, not sure which but that must be the reason why their vegan menu is gone and has been reduced to one vegan carne asada burrito which is painfully mediocre. I won't be coming back eat. They are incredibly stingy and cheap with their \"free chips\" too."}
{"text":"Nasty, gross, disgusting-enough said.
I will NEVER return, so turned off by the crowd and the place."}
{"text":"Took my friends here from my hometown because they had never been to mill ave and it was late, we were all just trying to find somewhere fun to dance and drink.. the music wasn't great but hey you can't please everyone in that department but even the drinks tasted like they had no alcohol and we had all bought buckets. The last thing that really threw me off was that the security just let my friend in but had asked to rummage through my wallet sized purse and gave me a look like I was hiding something in it? Mind you my friend has like the biggest purse filled with stuff so like idk it made me feel not welcomed? If you're gonna check a girls purse make sure to check her friends too so you're not singling anyone out you know? Even she was like \"what the heck? Rude.\" Idk. There was like maybe 5 people there this time but when I normally come there's like not even standing room.. idk just giving my opinion!"}
{"text":"Their vegan tofu burritos are fire. Definitely will be a regular here, at least during the day."}
{"text":"Spent over an hour on the patio tonight and when somebody bought bottle service we were told to leave our seats with food and drinks.  A packed patio and the only table we had been sitting at got told to move because of bottle service. Complete bullshit, I work in food and beverage and I'll be calling to talk to the manager in the morning. We had over $50 tab and we got told to move. Terrible customer service. I WILL NEVER RETURN AND TELL ALL THE PEOPLE I KNOW WHO GO TO MILL AVE TO AVOID THIS PLACE."}
{"text":"OMG where to even begin... This will be an interesting review to whoever interested...

Fiancé and I arrive at around 8pm yesterday (Sunday). Guy who carded us was nice and friendly- said to get a table we would have to go upstairs...as the entire area downstairs was occupied by nasty, and I mean nasty girls giving lap dances to strangers most likely (seen this all before lol). So off we go upstairs. All we really wanted was a quick dinner and a drink or two.

Took a table and realized after 5-7 minutes that getting service was going to be a hassle... Idiots working here apparently. Finally we were acknowledged, ordered two burritos, the Chinese takeout and some pork with Mac n cheese burrito. The food was the only positive about this place. Got two drinks as well.

Food arrives... No silverware.. No napkins.. Ummmm we are eating burritos???? Fiancé goes up and asks if she has silverware. All she says is \"Nope.\" Ummm how about you go get some?? Why this place hires apparently incompetent people is beyond me. Btw, this girl has the haircut to her shoulders with the half top knot on her head. Yeah, best interest to let this one go.. Maybe she was drunk is all we could come up with. Never got silverware.

We're about finished with dinner and a couple walks up to our table. The guy straight up asks us if we want to buy cocaine. Fiancé responds with a simple, \"Not a good idea buddy, I have a DEA license.\" Guy gets scared and says don't say anything. Fiancé has to walk to the bar to get the check from the worst waitress we've ever experienced, finally gets it, and we're about ready to go. Cocaine guy says, \"would you be mad if your girlfriend made out with mine?\" That was our cue to leave so that's what we did. 

This place is suchhhhhhh a joke, it's almost laughable. Our waitress didn't give a sh*t, good luck with a real job if you can't even handle that one sweetheart. The place is filled with low lives. What a joke! Glad we got out of there and we WONT EVER be back. I'll make sure to tell all my friends and family as well. Disgusting"}
{"text":"I would give 0 stars if I could. I took my friend out here for her birthday and bought her and myself a drink. The bartender, Nathan, was an asshole as soon as we walked up, but it gets better. I buy two drinks for $5 each. I tip him $3.00 when I shouldn't even have tipped him that. I check my bank statement a couple days later and NATHAN decided to steal money from me and charged my card $25 instead of the $13 on my receipt. 

I am a server myself and would NEVER steal money from a customer.. Let alone be an asshole to them and then steal their money on top of it.

I called the bar to tell them I got charged the wrong amount and they told me no manager was there and assured me they would have the manager call back. Never called me. I called two more times just to have the same thing happen. I live 40 minutes from this bar so I don't want to drive up there just for them to ignore me even more. 

I have never been so upset with an establishment in my life and I will be sure never to go back to this bar and will make sure everyone I know that goes to Mill Ave knows that this bar has employees who steal money from their customers!"}
{"text":"Gary & Max are absolute legends!  Those two guys are always hustling and make it such a joy going out!  CASA buckets are a must for any weekend!"}
{"text":"I originally gave C.A.S.A. 5 stars taking into consideration that they were brand new (only open a week or two when I went) and probably had some kinks to work out. Maybe they didn't expect so much traffic. Maybe they were still training the staff. 

Well I've been back five times since then. I have had horrible service every single time. The food is still good, but not half as good as it was the first time. The first time I went the vegan carne asada was juicy and heavily marinated. But the last couple times it's barely been marinated at all. Between the excessive amount of incompetent servers on the floor and the annoying amount of off-duty employees sucking down cocktails at the bar, there's typically around 15 servers downstairs at a time. And yet it still takes 10 minutes to order my first drink. 

Many of the servers do that annoying thing where they can only handle doing one thing at a time, even if it's grabbing water for a table with full drinks while another table has been waiting ten minutes for a cocktail that's melting at the edge of the bar. For god sake, please learn to multi task and prioritize. 

What's Still Good:
* Patio
* Cocktails
* Prices
* Vegan options
* Food 
* Friendliness

What Sucks:
* Service
* Food is not as good as it used to be 
* Bro vibe
* Epic amounts of looming employees"}
{"text":"I like the look and vibe of this place. But after suggesting meeting my cousin at this place, I realized that I enjoyed the look of it more than the drinks or food. I ordered a mojito that tasted like sweet and sour mix, not sure if they have a pre-made mix that made it taste like that. It did not taste like mint at all unfortunately. I am the kind of person who can mostly drink anything.. like almost anything. But I had to send it back. I asked for a margarita instead and also chips and salsa. Buttttttt I just couldn't drink this one either. When I lifted my straw syrup was stringing from the straw. It tasted like the same sweet and sour mix mixed with simple syrup. I told the waitress I couldn't drink this one either.. 
The chips and salsa were not good and had no flavor, at all, and came in some sort of squirt bottle ? We left soon after and I didn't drink anything, yet I was still charged for one of the drinks. I'm willing to give this place another chance since it's conveniently across the street from my apartment and looks fun on a Sunday.

Tldr: Don't order mojito or margarita. And don't order chips and salsa if you appreciate good salsa."}
{"text":"The manager was a complete A-HOLE!! My girlfriend and I ordered 2 burritos, after waiting forever, they eventually brought ONE burrito that wasn't even correct. We're pretty sure the waitress was drunk. So the manager came over and my gf said, we just ordered and they brought the wrong order, so he asks if we had a receipt, and I didn't b/c I signed and didn't take my copy. But gf tells him, we just spent $27, in which he replies, we don't have a burrito for $27, so a little irritated at this point, I jump in and say no, that's TWO burritos and a beer for $27. At this point I think he was pist b/c I called him out for that stupid comment, so he throws a $10 bill at me, and tries to get me kicked out. I was super pist, but b/c my gf was there, I didn't say anything else. How does that guy manage any joint, he obviously can't even manage his attitude!"}
{"text":"CASA WAS great. They had the best unique burritos like my personal favorite barbecue chicken dinner now after their recent addition of their taco joint and \"new menu\" these burritos are now gone substituted by a mere 4 meat choices which have the option for added Mac and cheese (eye roll). I will only be coming for the booze not the food. If anyone who is anyone at CASA reads this PLEASE BRING BACK THE OLD MENU!!!"}
{"text":"Awful. The only decent thing about this place is the set up (cool upper deck seating with a nice view). This is the ONLY good thing about his place. I went in last night for dinner and was blown away with the awful service. We were not greeted. Sat ourselves upstairs (as the \"bartender\" sat behind the bar and texted) we sat without menus or being greeted for 5 min. I then had to ask for a menu, was given one menu (for two of us and no drink list). After we looked over the menu still no server in sight... We waited another five min before I had to get up walk down stairs and ask for two waters myself. Again we waited... FINALLY our server (who was nice but seemed to be totally lost) showed up. We asked for a drink list which took another five min. Still no drink list... Asked again and finally she brought it up to our table. 

We ordered our food, still no drinks.. About five minuets later we finally received our beers. The food arrived shortly after which surprised me since everything else took forever.. The only problem was we were not given any utensils,  no napkins, no side plates. Had to ask the server to bring all theses things. After a few minuets she returned and I took my first bite of our carne asada tacos... They were cold, not just a little chilly, it seemed like they were sitting in a fridge prior, the meat was bland and cold and the tortillas were stale and also cold. We also ordered a grilled chicken burrito. It was terrible, once again it was cold. At this point I was just so confused and told myself they couldn't possibly mess up the tortilla chips until I tried one. The chips were drenched with salt, I'm not talking a little too much salt I'm talking about chips COVERED in salt. They were awful and inedible. 

I'm so disappointed everything we ordered was just pathetic. I asked our server for our tab as soon as she was in sight and asked nicely to speak with a manager. A manager came up and I informed his of how awful the food was and also told him that the staff should be a little more aware of their surroundings. I work in this business and I know how it important it is for everyone to work together.. This includes the front and back of house including managers. I felt like the servers and bartenders were not trained correctly and the manager I spoke with totally agreed. I don't remember his name but I know he is the bar manager. 

***Note to the owners of this place. LISTEN to your bar manager he seems to know where the problems are and he seems to really care about making changes to better this place. Your staff really needs to get on the same page and work as a team. I won't be back, and if things don't change soon I recommend their bar manager leave for a place that will last. Without a strong team there's nothing. 

Very disappointed I was excited to try this place."}
{"text":"was disappointed to see that all the cocktails on the patio were served in styrofoam cups which take a million + years to decompose. would love to see you guys take a positive step towards sustainability by using a compostable cup since you are probably going through so many. eco products & green paper products sells great compostable cups for a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"IF YOU LOVE RACISM AND BEING PROFILED THIS IS THE SPOT FOR YOU. First off I would like to say the only reason I rated them one star is because yelp wont let me give them less. I have been coming to CASA religiously for the past year (don't judge my drinking habits) and after what was witnessed this past Saturday I will never return again. First off their mediocre food and signature \"bucket\" drinks aren't worth witnessing the securities racism when deciding who gets in and what attire is appropriate for their business. Last week a complaint was filed about racism and nothing was done. I've witnessed the security turn away black men because they were wearing athletic shoes, basketball shorts, army pants (he was in ROTC) and even a white t shirt. BUT BEST BELIEVE IF A WHITE FRAT BOY COMES IN WEARING A FUCKIG WHITE TSHIRT RHEY BARELY EVEN CHECK THEIR ID. All of this sadly was brushed off my shoulders and I contributed to societies ignorance and went back. Last night I was sitting at the bar when I saw this young man (black) get kicked out. My two friends who were also African American got up and went to check on the young man. When I asked why they cared her response was \"too many of my people are dying not to make sure he's ok\" I respected their answers and watched from a distance. They came back after making sure he was gonna get a ride home safely only to return to the security not letting them in. The security grouped them together and said their \"friend\" who got kicked out allegedly had a gun. After getting the cops involved and tears shed nothing was done. Me and my friends then decided we weren't gonna stay there and witness this obvious racism any longer. WHILE waiting for our uber the other security starts to laugh at my friends because of how upset they were over the situation. He then turned to his fellow employee and said \"IT SMELLS LIKE A BUNCH IF MONKEYS OUT HERE\" this is where I draw the line. No bar or business deserves to be open if they can't accept the people that they serve. I am absolutely disgusted by CASA an will be making it known that they promote racial slander and profiling. Too many bars on mill avenue to choose from to are about a FUCKING bucket."}
{"text":"Love this bar going to rage extremely hard and these guys support my drinking habits!!!"}
{"text":"Never had the food here so I'm just commenting on the bar portion of the resto but I've been a couple times when I've visited tempe and been impressed each time. Not your typical long taplist kind of place, as there were several surprises such as anchor steam (severely underrated on draft) and deschutes red chair. Most importantly they have michelob ultra, which is amazing because my friends and I like to buy that for each other as a form of icing each other. We call it getting mich'd. 

In addition to their sweet bar, I like the staff too. One of our waitresses gave us dinner recommendations, and in general they are fun to talk to and seem to enjoy working there."}
{"text":"Stopped by after work, looking for someplace new and was pleasantly surprised. 1) It was Taco Tuesday, $1 street tacos 2) On Tuesdays happy hour is extended until 8pm 3) The Reggae/Island music selection set the mood 4) Service was fantastic 5) Caipirinha cocktails for $5 are great. Will definitely return to try the other dishes!"}
{"text":"0 stars!!! Some creep invited tons of girls to the table and when our gfs popped the bottle the guy got mad/aggressive with our guy friend and tried to tell me that \"I better put my hand down\" when I tried to say let's stop when we'll leave even when we were invited by him???? Just cause he bought a table we weren't allowed to stay. Just shows if you pay money they'll let you be aggressive and fight."}
{"text":"Was originally planning to go to Bison Witches for brunch at 10 am, however Bison wasn't open and C.A.S.A. was. It was perfect. We had a group of 8 or 9 and found a spot that accommodated all of us.  They are also dog friendly :)

I love the patio. They were only serving their limited breakfast menu when we got there but it was great. I don't know who decided to put sweet potatoes in a breakfast burrito but their burritos and breakfast burrito bowls are pretty damn good for a small little patio bar on mill that has only been open for 2 weeks.

I'm looking forward to trying their lunch menu and of course drinks :)

I love that they are open early and I absolutely love patios in AZ this time of year.

The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because they brought me a burrito instead of the bowl that I ordered. The contents are the same and it still tasted really good."}
{"text":"I am sitting here as I type this.   I finally got a beer after 8 minutes of sitting at the bar  -- they are NOT busy.   I waited another bunch of minutes to get bartender to take my food order .    A whole bunch of employees just talking to one another.  Wish I left instead of torturing myself with this social experiment.    Spend you money somewhere else.

I will say the food was very good."}
{"text":"Stopped in here one night during our Mill bar hopping. They had a live DJ and the drinks were good. If more people were here in this interesting little place, I think it'd be pretty fun.

Ask for bartender Mike."}
{"text":"Your welcome. You can get burritos here, some drinks and stuff. Has a nice patio with misters. Cool stuff"}
{"text":"Excellent vibe, great staff, affordable drinks and food is really delicious.

During summer, even though it is an open bar, water sprinklers & fans do their job keeping the place fresh.

During winter, heaters do the trick.

Great for any day of the week, specially Sundays to relax and watch few games.

Dog friendly"}
{"text":"Stopped in last night pretty late. First time and we loved it! The $9 buckets are a bargain and can be filled with whatever you choose. Been to Tempe many times and have never stopped by. Now we will be back much more often. Even though it was raining, the umbrellas and outdoor environment were still a blast. Quick service too!"}
{"text":"Reading these reviews I assume Churro Does mean Diarrhea, cause that's what I got from that taco stand. I sat at the bar the bartenders were okay looking. Interesting conversation but then I decided to order tacos. 
First off I saw that the meat was open in a tiny cooler but tipsy I said watevs. BAD IDEA. I went home and the next day got sick. (No explanation needed) thought it was another restraunt till my doctor told me it takes 24 hour for food poisoning. 

The service could have been better also."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place until I walked in. First of all, no one greeted us or said hello. My friend and I were awkwardly stared at by the staff as we sat ourselves. We then waited at our table for 15 minutes before having to get up and asked to be served. When the waitress finally came to our table I was shocked at how little she knew about the food. When she came back with our food we had to find our own plates and silverware. To top it all of the food was horrible and over priced. So disappointed in this place. I do not recommend it to anyone who is looking for a a decent dining experience."}
{"text":"Okay, so here's a story. Basically a group of my friends and I, maybe like 6 people total, decided to go to mill for my 21st birthday. We decided to go to casa because they had a good deal on their buckets. 

The moment the bouncer lets me in he told me \"next drink is water okay?\" Thinking it was a joke because it was my 21st I giggled and walked away. So we went upstairs and ordered 2 buckets for the table. Our waitress was a gem! 

The moment our drinks hit the table the same bouncer showed up immediately almost out of thin air and asks me if we can't talk outside. I was extremely cooperative and went with him. Mind you at this point I've had maybe 2 drinks and was perfectly fine. He escorted me outside the gate to give me a stern talking to (it was not even 9pm) about how it was time for me to turn it. He told me that I didn't listen to him when he told me to get water and that it was for my safety. I kindly explained to him that I felt fine and thought I was acting fine. If he needed me to leave I wouldn't have fought it that is his job after all. But I feel as if he had it out for me from the start. 

So he allowed me to go back upstairs at this point I just wanted to go. I was humiliated and ashamed but I had done nothing wrong. 

My friend I was with decided to talk to him before we left to explain how he ruined the night. Before my friend could ask why he wanted me to leave so badly, he told her verbatim \"well she was acting like she was mentally retarded the minute she walked in here\" while he held her arm really tightly. We grabbed the head of security after this comment and tried to get some answers and feel a little better. Brent was very kind and heard us and even wished me a happy birthday. 

I most likely won't be back there after this incident. I felt embarrassed and profiled for being a young woman. Every single word the bouncer said to me was said in such a rude manner."}
{"text":"Apparently they have a dress code although I feel us being turned away was due to some racist bouncers! Avoid this place please and don't give your business to them. ZERO STARS!"}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving C.A.S.A 2 stars is because the outside patio is an awesome place to go hang out during the day - good food, good drinks, great staff.

At night (at least in the lounge) I will NEVER go back. I payed $6 for a margarita and it tasted like straight ass. You are a professional establishment...how do you mess up something as easy as a margarita? That shit was undrinkable. It somewhat resembled a combination of milk and orange juice. When I asked the bartender to taste it, he refused and just poured another shot into it and told me to quit complaining. Pouring more tequila in it is not going to make it taste better. I'm not one to complain but it really was that bad. Both myself and my friends that I was with ended up leaving pretty much our entire drinks.

Bottom line: you are a Mexican restaraunt and you still managed to fuck up something near and dear to my heart."}
{"text":"It's rare I give 5 stars, but the tacos here are great. Good service, better music. 

Unfortunately, I'm going to go with a 4 star review because the Moscow Mule drink that I received was flat. But I'm willing to give it another shot due to good service."}
{"text":"People have a whole crap ton of negative things to say about this place, but I enjoyed my visit. I got the Vegan Chinese takeout burrito, super freaking good. My boyfriend ordered a mac and cheese burrito (not the vegan one) and loved it. They had deals on mojitos that night, and those were pretty good. Great service as well."}
{"text":"Hi Everybody,

I really thought I was done with these but the story I have is waaaay to good not to be told. A couple of close friends and I went to see the Ryan Davis Standup at the Tempe Improv. I do need to state that one of my close friends that was with me) is a very good/famous professional heavyweight fighter named Cain Velasquez (this is very relevant to the story). At the end of the Stand up we all decided to go the Piano bar on Mill Ave to hang out and have a good time.  Overall the night was going great but we decided to head back to our car that was parked in the garage next to Casa Sumba. Cain's wife was one of the members in our group. At this time his wife is over 5 months pregnant.  She needed to stop for quick bathroom break, so we decided to stop there.  The plan was to go in and have drink while Cain's wife handles her business. The bouncer at the front was a bald guy with red facial hair.  As we walked up the bouncer the bounces goes right for me and checks out my clothes which I thought was very silly cause I was wearing normal size everything. He did see that I was wearing Jordan sneakers. With a smirk on his face, he let me know that \"Jordans weren't allowed in the restaurant\". I honestly thought he was joking.  

Now Mill Avenue as whole has a reputation for trying to block certain demographics from entering their establishments. I have had issues when I college (nearly a decade ago) getting into places at night when I was wearing very similar clothes as other people that were allowed in. All of these places that I have issued with back then are now out of business. THERE ARE SEVERAL OTHER REVIEWS THAT STATE RACE as the reason for a poor experience at CASA Sunba.

Once I could see that the bouncer was really going to deny my access, I became dumbfounded. He was literally the first bouncer I have ever seen that has turned away Cain. 99.9% bouncers know who Cain is and love it when he comes around. I could tell this bouncer was/is special. Like I said I have been denied access to places before, so I usually just laugh it off and go about my business. The problems came from my friends being more pissed than I was. The group I was traveling with was pretty diverse but I was the only black guy. I don't think they were used to getting turned away over petty BS. Well they learned that day. I am always glad to share my experiences with people of other races.  

I was trying to tell my friends that are was okay and that these things always turn out for the better. Cain's wife was very unhappy but still needed to use the restroom. The bouncer had zero reason to not let her in and might I add again she was 5 months pregnant. The bouncer actually had the nerve to stop her and give her hard time about going in. He actually blocked her and held her up. Now I was nervous. I don't care if you are bouncer that does tabeo 7 days a week. You are NOT tough enough to stop Cain if he goes off. There probably weren't enough bouncers on that entire block. The bouncer was very lucky that he let her through when he did and he was the only smart thing he did was not touch her cause I knew that would be an instant problem that he couldn't handle. 

The bottom line is I understand policies and people doing their job. I also identify a bouncer with ego issues and whatever else that dude had. I'm glad the situation didn't get any worse and overall my night was a blast. However neither my friends or I will ever go back to CASA Sunba. I will try to post a pick of me that night so you can see what I was wearing. It really doesn't matter because the Jordans were apparently the issue. It is 2017. How are wearing Jordan shoes an issue? If this is the restaurants policy then it obviously needs to be changed. If the bouncer took it upon himself to impose his on policies then that restaurants needs to think about restaffing. I'm sure this post will deter some people of color from going in. I'm black and Cain is Mexican and I A LOT of Latinos LOVE Cain. 

If you know me then you know my background and that I'm telling 100% truth about everything. I made my profile photo the same photo of our group that night. I could easily think of ways to blow this whole thing up but I don't think the actions of few should affect the people who had no part in these events.

Thanks for reading!"}
{"text":"This place is a shit show! They literally sell buckets of alcohol to all the belligerent night owls in this tiny tiny establishment that is outside. It is 2 levels but super small, and sometimes they host block parties that get super crazy. That's the only reason I go here is to see sick djs. Otherwise I would not come. There's no bathrooms, people are over served, but the drinks aren't that expensive and there's a cool patio upstairs. It's just really really dirty and the crowd is annoying!"}
{"text":"I have now been there 3 times and each time is it getting worse and worse.  They could possibly have the worst service of any restaurant I have ever been to.

Last time I sat at the bar with a friend and watch our food sit on the counter for 10 minutes when the bartender finally turned around and realized there was food on the counter.

Today we went and sat on the roof. We ordered at 12:15 and by 1:00 we were still waiting for our Mac and Cheese Burrito.  The server told us they had a big party while the owner then came over and told us the health inspector shut the kitchen down for a half hour.  Either way I will not be back.

Only good if you have at least 2 hours to kill for lunch"}
{"text":"Never tried the food, but just wanted a beer. Happy Hour was long over at 6pm, but the sunset special saved the day - $2 corona's til the sun sets. The bar downstairs needs some more shade because the sun is pelting the back of your head at all hours of the day. Decent TV's though at the bar. I headed upstairs to polish off the beer and it has a simiiar view as the Rooftop Bar just up the street. Kinda looks Vegasy with the couches all around, but we are far from Vegas and this crowd looked more hip than tourist. Skinny Jeans hell. Still, a great view and good beer prices make this a decent new addition to Mill."}
{"text":"The worst!  I ate here a lot when it was Chronic Taco and had great service and food.  We had to wait 45 minutes for our meal and we were table checked one time.   I ordered what they called Ceviche, that was gazpacho that they served with ONE piece of shrimp!  Too many places on Mill Ave. to find a better dining experience than to waste my time and money here."}
{"text":"The food was great! The staff was friendly and the bar tender even came out to pet our dogs. I love that they allow dogs on the patio but I wish the patio could be bigger! I love that the vegan options are clearly labeled and while everything is pretty much a burrito their is still a lot of diversity on the menu.. I ordered the vegan \"Chinese takeout burrito\" and it was amazing!"}
{"text":"Found this place by accident returning from the Tempe Art Festival. What a hidden gem. We stopped by because the were not overcrowded with Festival goers and it was on our way back to our car. What a surprise!  I ordered the Chinese Takeout Burrito which consisted of crispy Sweet and Sour Chicken, fried rice and spring rolls all inside a flour (or wheat) tortilla. It was huge and wonderful tasting.  I would have loved each item individually but it was extra special in the tortilla.  Nothing was mushy or mashed together. I would order this in a heartbeat. 

My hubby got the teriyaki chicken burrito and said it was fantastic.  We are definitely going to make a special trip from Gilbert to have lunch. 

Be aware that this is inside a dark bar but understand there is outside seating. Definitely worth a try. The. Young chef is brilliant. Congrats.

Went there with hubby and chef friend today. Again the food was great but the music was excessively loud and we could not hear to talk."}
{"text":"I have been to CASA several times and have always had great service along with great food. All th eemployees are very cheerful and want to help you in any way they can. I am a big fan!"}
{"text":"RACIST!!!! RACIST!!! i was on mill ave last night for typical saturday night fun!! never have i seen such incompetence. last night they escorted a drunk guy who they thought was a threat out of the bar, and two girls left to check on him and then they refused to let them in because they were black!!! 
NOW GET THIS 
one of the security guards looked at the other in front of the girls as they made it clear they weren't allowed back in and said, AND I QUOTE \"it smells like a bunch of monkeys out here\" 
ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!! disgusting!!! never returning!! do not support subpar businesses who's employees are already rude and shitty, BUT NOW RACIST AS WELL."}
{"text":"The most racist bar ever. I was standing in the restroom line then two people came and stood right front of me. The security is always standing right front the restroom door. So I told him, and he acted like there's nothing happened. Dose that happen because I'm NOT WHITE and the security and those two people were WHITE. Is this a WHITE privilege  ???????????????????"}
{"text":"Wow what a great place to grab a bucket for only $5 our bartender Josh made fantastic drinks! Must come back!"}
{"text":"Service is sketchy , didn't feel welcome here and I was so ready to get my to go order. I'm not threatening in any way shape or form, but from the bouncer to the dude taking my order I felt like my business was not appreciated. 

The tacos were also way too spicy, and my ex girl is from Mexico so I know you can make street tacos without the fire and still be flavorful. 

Beer was nasty!  The whole place it just seemed really like an awkward display of bro macho and fake transplant that decided to make Mexican food at an open air bar with a Scottsdale touch of snobbery. 
I will not comeback

{"text":"Bad service and food could be good if they actually included all the ingredients.. From what I have heard the Mac n cheese burrito is the only thing worth eating here. We had the Carne asada burrito and the casa chicken. The carne asada burrito is just chopped beef with Taco seasoning you buy from Walmart and that's about it, maybe it could be better if all the ingredients were in it. The casa chicken was again missing ingredients but much better than the burrito. This is my personal experience try whatever you want maybe you will have better luck. :)"}
{"text":"I have been a customer here for the last 4 years and to be honest I will never be back because of their staff and to be specific their bartender Josh North is the main problem. He treats his friends like they run the place and personally he's kicked me out because my girlfriend didn't give him the light of day. The kid is selfish and is ruining a Tempe/Mill staple. His fiends are disrespectful and bring the vibe of the whole venue down. Untill he is gone me and my whole fraternity will not be spending a dime at this location."}
{"text":"Tremendous burritos! I had the vegan Carne Asada burrito, it was huge and delicious. They also have a macaroni and cheese burrito with pulled pork & green chiles that looked amazing. Great beer selection with plenty of craft beer options and imports on draft and in bottles and cans. This place is fantastic. Highly recommended, the only drawback is the outdoor seating, when it gets hot in Phoenix it's nice to get inside! But they have misters and shade so it's not too bad out there."}
{"text":"OMFG! We all had the vegan carne asada burrito. Four hours later all doubled over with the worst stomach pain ever! STAY AWAY! DIRTY! I had to get antibiotics for an infection. F*** you Casa!!"}
{"text":"This waitress was really rude and in a terrible mood, you have no right to take this out on customers."}
{"text":"Went to Casa with a large group Saturday night. It was the first stop of the night and we hadn't had anything to drink yet. With a large group it is more difficult to order drinks. We had split transactions and we were gonna pool cash tip at the end. But the bar tender say one transaction without tip and refused to to serve us anymore drinks. Even though we tipped after finally receiving our last drink from a different bar tender. And then refused to serve anyone that was seen with is that night. She was completely rude. I get that place was crazy and I'm sure they deal with a lot of drunk rude people but we were not them."}
{"text":"Holly is amazing! She found us a table and served us right away, even on a Saturday night
 LOVE HER. will return just because of her service!"}
{"text":"I CAN NOT believe how RACIST these people are. Do not support Casa on Mill! Security are notoriously shady, this seems to be the hub for shenanigans but you will never see me as a customer again."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely HORRIBLE if i could NOT give it any stars i would. but y'all need to hear about this.... my boyfriend turned 21, today, March 7th, 2018... we decided, hmmm we should go to mill... seven of us.. (i've been 21 since January 5th) i waited to switch my license till THIS MORNING with my boyfriend so we could get them together (not the point) all of us get to mill and end up at this \"C.A.S.A\" place. guy says they'll check ID's once we get in, all seven of us get comfortable, and Miss \"Vanessa\" comes up, i have my UNROTATED license and she flipped... she told me i have to leave because it's past 9pm, it was about 8:45, first of all... I'm still 21, the license still had my valid birth date, i then said i have a SECOND state ID (mmj card) and that was a big deal to her and steroid midget dude at the front Mike were not having my cards. i mean i'm still 21, mother still gave birth to me on that day? and she said i had to leave like i was 12, AND this girl wearing barely ANYTHING and it was NOT cute let me tell you, a crop top in a 200 pound girl is NOT cute. i got served a drink somewhere else sweetie, got my beer, you got a bad review, and lost 7 customers. ?"}
{"text":"Food is good. DONT order a mojito if you know what an actual mojito is. Super disappointed. Come here for a trash time, no questions asked. Mostly for ASU kids with no class but lots of money to spend on a place that masquerades as a cultural spot but really Americanized as fuck. Usual story on Mill."}
{"text":"Whoa - this place really has hit or miss reviews! Luckily, the day some friends and I went, it was a hit.

Here's what I loved:
* Great location on Mill Ave
* Comfy patio
* Helpful servers
* Good cocktails
* Bandidas - delicious sandwiches! (get the ham; trust me on this one)

Everything was a bit pricey, but with so many positives, I can overlook that."}
{"text":"Great food great vibe.  I went there for brunch this past Sunday and the food really was delicious.  I had the chicken and waffle plate and it was huge but I shared with my 2 year old son who you can see quite enjoyed it as well (see picture of the kid devouring the chicken).  The chicken has a little zing and the waffles are topped with bacon and ham and a whole lot of yummy.  My friend had the chorizo burrito and her 8 year old son had the breakfast sandwich and they both really liked their food as well.  The menu is not too extensive but very unique and enough of a variety to pick from.  I myself do better with less options because otherwise it takes me way too long to order.  They also had a live DJ playing and the music was great! Not too loud or crazy, just some very chill music that really added that extra touch to the ambience.  The info at top says it's not good for kids but we took ours and had a really great time."}
{"text":"I love the vegan carne asada. It can be a little salty at times. I typically get the bowl and omit the beans as they are not vegan and get extra rice. Would love extra lettuce instead but I refuse to pay extra for a few shreds of lettuce."}
{"text":"The burritos are so amazing I don't even know where to begin. The chinese take out or the mac and cheese burrito is what I would recommend. Also, I love that you can sit upstairs outside. It's really enjoyable. The buckets are the way to go when you want to have a drink. They have awesome deals when it comes to them. When you wanna grab a drink during the day, I would come to casa and grab a bite as well."}
{"text":"Fantastic patio delicious food. Loved the Green Chili Chicken Bowl and would go back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"\"WE DON'T LIKE MEXICAN'S HERE!!!\" These are the exact words from a bouncers mouth Friday night! I heard him say that to a very nicely dressed Hispanic man who was NOT disorderly, was NOT intoxicated, when I asked this young gentleman what happened he said, \"He didn't like me apparently\". ATTN: ALL LATINOS!!! DO NOT SPEND MONEY HERE! I am Latina and very offended by what I witnessed!"}
{"text":"I didn't know Facebook was a form of ID. The bouncer would not let my friend in because she didn't have a Facebook. He then proceeded to call us both bitches. So professional."}
{"text":"Great place to drink on the patio on a beautiful Phoenix day!  Great drink selection and friendly servers."}
{"text":"The bouncer examined my ID and then refused to let me in with the excuse that \"You stink.\" 

I had just showered and put on clean clothes an hour before. 

The asshole also neatly bent my ID in half as if that's some kind of actual test. Why then don't they do that in airports?

Just some power tripping mental midget. Fuck this place."}
{"text":"CASA was once one of my favorite places in all of the valley. The vibes were great and the best part was their unique burritos. Just recently they've expanded their brand and opened a taco shop done the street. 


I came to the original CASA yesterday and EVERYTHING had changed. First, the waitress brought out a plastic tray with plastic forks, knives and napkins. 2.Their signature salsa is gone, and replaced with very watered down salsas with no flavor. 3..And this is worst part, their ENTIRE menu has changed. They have nothing from the original menu. Prices are higher and product is cheaper. For example, my favorite dish was the \"Big Shrimpin\" burrito previously. Now there are these taco plates and just 4 burrito options. Yesterday i got the Cabo Shrimp, which was disgusting. The rice was stale and crunchy. It was definitely old. The shrimp was way too over-seasoned as well. To me, it seems like they just bought way cheaper food in bulk, slashed the menu and now it tastes like a nasty chain restaurant. 


4. When the waitress came for our plates, she dumped them in the trash right in front of us! Throughout our meal I was speaking with the waitress about the changes and she was disappointed too! 


I'm telling you, I used to go to this place if not every Sunday for brunch but at least every two weeks. No lie, the burritos WERE amazing. And it was cool to order the secret item of the chips and queso.
It saddens me to write this review of a place I used to love. PLEASE MANAGEMENT AT CASA BRING BACK THE OLD MENU! The old menu was what got them where they are in the first place! Unfortunately, I won't be going back for food again, maybe some drinks. But I can go to any other place on mill now for a drink, this place was just unique.
Thanks for reading."}
{"text":"Don't come here unless you totally want to be disrespected by bartenders. Super bad service. On top of slow and rude attitudes from the bartenders, the clock hit 2 so we were leaving and the bartender thought it was funny to spray water all over me and my best friend. Sooooo unprofessional, and he thought it was funny like a child. Like who would EVER in their right mind think that was okay? It got all over our face and hair. So disrespectful. Never giving any money to this place again!"}
{"text":"We visited early on a bit of a cool day and the misters were blasting over almost every table and chair in the entire place. After we finally located a place that was relatively dry, someone finally did shut them off. We had some annoying flies swarming us, especially after the food arrived, which was not pleasant. Our server was working for the first day and did a decent job, especially considering that he had clearly not been trained. We only had one round of drinks, which isn't enough to judge the quality of the bar. However, I get the impression that this is a bar first and foremost, rather than an eatery. Aside from these points, the general location and outlay are quite nice, especially for downtown events around Mill. 

Yet, I would not recommend this as a place to eat. While the food is cheap and different from your typical bar burger, it was a bit on the bland side. However, the small bits of carne asada that I got were very tasty. If they could increase the size of the tiny bits of meat and build the meals more around it, they could probably have some pretty good dishes. The chips and salsa were also pretty good. Our server nicely brought us a squeeze bottle of the salsa to use, rather than the tiny plastic cups that we started with."}
{"text":"I like this place. Great drinks and interesting food. This place has proved you can put any meal into a burrito and make it taste good. 

2 cons: 
The outside bar is separate from the inside bar.
The outside bar has all the good drinks but attracts a horrible crowd 

The outside bar is nicer and has more to offer. The inside bar is pretty much like a pricey dive bar. I wish they could combine the two."}
{"text":"What happened to this place?! Completely changed their menu to not appetizing food and now the margaritas come out of tap!!! Also, the waitress wouldn't take our food order, said we had to go to the bar. Excuse me? You won't take our food order, just the drinks?

Very unfortunate because this used to be our go to place."}
{"text":"I think the only reason we drank there was because of the outside bar and DJ. It was a good time for sure."}
{"text":"The food here used to be great but has gone way downhill in recent months. The music is way too loud. Otherwise it would be a good place to have drinks with friends. As is, it's so loud that I can't really take friends there for a drink after work.

It's a real shame because they have an awesome location and a nice patio."}
{"text":"Sunday FUNDAY started here. Yes it is 110 degrees today, let's sit outside and drink.....
IT'S OK WE'RE PROFESSIONALS.
First off, loved the bar staff, very attentive and friendly.
2nd.......probably the best Mimosa I've ever had. Fresh squeezed OJ is a game changer when it comes to a Mimosa. I had 2 then switched to margaritas.
3rd, if I wasn't hungover and sick of drinking beer, I would of got the $9 bucket of beer, then every bucket after that is $5. I couldn't start off that way today. 
Now Im not a fan of the music they play, and they play it loud, so everyone in the bar is just yelling at one another, even my wife next to me was yelling at me.  This is not the atmosphere i want to be in for very long as I nurse my hangover from Saturday night.  IM TRYING TO RALLY HERE PEOPLE......CAN YOU TURN DOWN THE BASS PUMPING CRAP?    Kidding. Do what you want.  Head ache plus bass is not a good combo coming out of the gate. 
Fun place, fun staff great place to start a day of drinking as long as your not hungover."}
{"text":"Don't let you in if you're wearing Jordans. Loosing out on business and no explanation. Comedy"}
{"text":"I give them an A for effort, but there were several things lacking.

My first beef was their lack of vegan machaca, if the menu has items listed they should be available. The second being was the less than stellar service. Our water was only refilled long after being empty and asking, the bottomless chips and salsa had a bottom after the first cardboard dish. 

My Chinese takeout burrito was, inventive but not my favorite item. The spring rolls (in the burrito) were far from fresh being crisp on the surface bush mushy inside of that. 

Overall I was not impressed, maybe this is better suited as a outdoor drinking patio, that apparently permits smoking.."}
{"text":"My friends and I chose to go during the day, and went to the upstairs seating to avoid the crowd. There was fake grass upstairs, and the weather was nice; overall, the view was pretty. However, there weren't many covers upstairs, so I had to squint and shield my eyes from the sun for most of the time.  

The service was good - I thought that the server checked in quite often and was nice. I ordered the pineapple cider, but was slightly disappointed; it was pretty much juice and not much alcohol was evident. I didn't like the drink because it was way too sweet - I would rather buy the ciders from the grocery store than drink at CASA. The prices are on the medium-high range, as expected on Mill, 

Nothing was offending about the place, but the reason I'm giving this place three stars is because the bar was just a-ok. I've been to better bars before, and this one just didn't feel special. I wouldn't avoid CASA but I wouldn't seek it either."}
{"text":"This place is terrible. We were visiting our son who goes to school there and decided to take him out for a night of fun with him and his friends. I witnessed something that disappointed and disgusted me. There had been a male Patron who had been tossed out for apparently having a firearm. It is of note It's that the man was of black decent. These two girls who are friends of my son, who were also of black decent, said that they had no idea who he was but they were going to make sure that he was safe and ok. After making sure that he was indeed safe, the two friends tried to renter the bar. Security had said that they were not allowed in because they were friends with the male patron that was removed. After a long discussion, they didn't let the girls back into the bar. What came next truly shocked me. As they were waiting for a ride home, a security guard turns to his coworker and said \" it smells like monkeys out here\". That is WRONG!!! I will never be back to this place."}
{"text":"I don't know what the deal is with the low reviews, this place is great. My favorite on mill. During the day they've got half off of their 20 drafts on tap, and $5 mojitos. The vegan food is great too, I always get the quesadilla with portobello. Good music playing too. 

Oh and the salsa is so good."}
{"text":"This place stinks like poo. I got my toes stepped on like a hundred times.  ..Would recommend."}
{"text":"Lovely patio on Mill avenue with a great craft beer selection and interesting food. Beers run about $6 with $1 off at happy hour and burritos are around $9. You can take any burrito item and make it a taco- interesting twist. My boyfriend got the green chili pork mac and cheese and really enjoyed it. I stuck with the appetizer bean burrito which was more than enough! Ask for the free chips and salsa with purchase of a beverage. I thought it was funny that 10 taco items are strictly sold at Wednesday taco time and not the entire time? Maybe place it on a separate menu so it's not as confusing?"}
{"text":"I feel bad about writing a one star review... but I feel as though I have given this place both the time and chance to recover.

The first time I came in was for one of the infamous burritoes. I was happy to know that they had a large vegan menu because of the vegan chef. I tried the Chinese Take out which was huge and consisted of fried rice, orange tofu and an egg roll. All the other vegan options sounded great so we were excited to come back. This was a few years ago, maybe 2012.

The next time we returned they were out of many things, so I had to get the chinese take out again. It was good, I just expected to try something new.

The next time we went later in the afternoon. Service wasn't great. It seemed as though they were upset we weren't drinking. I get it, but we came for the food. We always tip 20%.

We were driving home from California and wanted a burrito. We called a to go order and none of the vegan items were available. We gave up. Still around 2012.

This past week we called in a to go order at 8:45 PM. I politely asked if they were still serving food, to which they said yes. I am in a local vegan group who has been raving about their new vegan menu. Sadly, I called and they were out of everything but none other than the chinese take out. OK. I ordered it and my husbands non vegan choice. They said it would be 20 minutes.

We showed up at the 22 minute mark and the security looked at my husband and said \"yeah?\" to which my husband said we had a to go order. Not super welcoming. Long story short the food wasn't ready for another 20 minutes. 

I'm sad to say that if they actually had the items they so often run out of, it might be worth the drive for us. We now live near Gold Canyon. 

Overall, food is meh. Service is not good. Not coming back."}
{"text":"I'm giving one star because of their anti firearms policy. 
Even after speaking with the owner about it, he explained to me that if he didn't have the sign up that Tempe police would bully him. I find that very hard to believe. This is Arizona for gods sake. He also tried to tell me he was for firearms and was an ex navy seal. When I asked him where he was stationed and his M.O. He had just told me \"around the world\" 
I find it hard to believe he was stationed anywhere. 

I will not return until he stands up for our right and takes that sign down."}
{"text":"Said they lost my card, but still were able to charge it..with a 20% tip. Menu is a culinary abortion. Service is constantly bad with an attitude. This place won't last another summer."}
{"text":"I have allergies and walked mill to find a place to accommodate me for brunch. The chef Joey came out to my table and personally took my order. He then delivered to me the most amazing meal. The guy behind the bar is a sweetie. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"0 stars. Place has such a beautiful location, lots of potential but the whole management and crew need to be replaced. Rude, disrespectful & no customer service. Bathroom is disgustingggg and emoloyees wear leggings and sandals but they make a big deal about dress code...."}
{"text":"It's our go to spot for great burritos and tacos (on Wednesday). Perfect place to go on a sunny day!"}
{"text":"It's tiny and hard to find seats. I used to go there for the Mac N cheese burrito but now the taco shops is next store and doesn't make them anymore. 
The rooftop patio is plain. I don't really get why this place is hyped all the time. The location carries the whole thing. The beers are ok priced and that's about it"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. Atrocious. Do not come here because they do not care about the consumer."}
{"text":"Checked in here Saturday night, just getting around to the review today. Probably best for C.A.S.A that I let me steam simmer down two days before writing the review. It was an overall bad experience, the only thing that I can compliment the establishment on is the great heaters they have. Those bad boys kept the whole patio toasty. Service was so/so, nothing to complain about. Over priced drinks, small food portions (small price tag however), and bad customer service from the other staff besides our waitress. The bar staff and the security must not have realized we spent a good 300 dollars there as a group that night because they treated us like they wanted us gone. The place has great intentions, just not quite there yet."}
{"text":"First time here. A bit disappointed. Ambiance is okay. Great music. Not the best service. There's no inside or air conditioning and it was 107 today. The misters worked wonders though. It was nice to sit right on Mill Ave. 


Seeing no one else with food should have been a red flag for me. I ordered food nonetheless. I ordered Carne Assad tacos and a Moscow mule. Initially I had no intention to drink but I waited so damn long to receive a menu and have my order I felt like it didn't make sense not to. From when I got there to when I ordered I kid you not it took nearly 45 minutes. I contemplated leaving a few times but I stayed because the reviews are so decent I just had to try. 

I had to ask for just meat and cilantro. They normally pre-mix everything in the tacos. I asked for corn tortilla, was served flour. I was too hungry to send it back. The damn carne asada was soooooo oily and salty. Unnecessarily salty actually. Bland rice. Bland beans. It wasn't until after I received my food that I realized that his place is known for its alcohol buckets. Not the food. 

Eat here at your own risk. Might be a cool place to come hang out when it isn't too hot and want a place to go have just drinks with friends."}
{"text":"Quant bar/restaurant in downtown Tempe. I sat upstairs on the patio. Great view up there. The nacho fries is a must. Wouldn't think these would be so good but you have to order these. The ceviche was good and it was taco Tuesday $1 tacos. These were very good as well!  Great place"}
{"text":"It was a terrible experience. My friend's order came out an hour late, and cold, so I went and re-ordered it from the waitress who was furious that I was merely asking for a re-fire of the dish.  But then, later, after dancing I went to the bar for water, when a security dude grabbed my shoulder and ordered me to close my tab and leave.  I thought he had mistaken me for someone else, and nodded and continued to drink some water, but then another security guard began shoving me out, off of the patio.  He wouldn't hear me out and was extremely aggressive. Rude, weird staff.  Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night on my birthday.  The drinks were really good, in particular we enjoyed the margarita, moscow mule.  The strawberry daiquiri was not frozen but on the rocks and tasted so so however it was pretty potent as far as alcohol content as it felt like a knock out punch to both of us.  

We had the pulled pork burrito with cold macaroni and cheese in it.  Neither one of us cared for it.  We also ordered the trio dip: salsa, refried beans, and guacamole.  The salsa was decent, the refried beans was some of the best I've ever had ... so yummy, unfortunately way too much was given and it's not good to eat so much refried beans even if they taste healthy and good.

The guacamole was out of this world.  So fresh tasting.  We both enjoyed this the most.  Waitress Ally was great.  Her personality and demeanor helped us enjoy our time there even more.  We will come back.

Overall I had  really great time here.

Live music ended by the time we arrived at 8:30 PM and we were left without a DJ.  Music could be better. lol."}
{"text":"I have been to Casa for close to 3 years now and can say at times I have had decent service and decent quality food and drinks, but today I honestly had enough. I came out with one of my cousins from another country who had a clear form of identification that stated her date of birth as well as every amount of information needed to get into the bar. Her form of identification clearly stated she was 32... Not 21 or 20, but 32. If she was close to the age of 21 I would clearly understand the situation at hand but I am a loyal customer for many years and have tried to hold back, but I have had enough. The bouncer treated us like garbage and not once even attempted to reconcile the situation. At the worst I would've understood him if he spoke in a kind manner, but he immediately took to anger and frustration as if I was trying to harm him in some way. This place needs to reconsider their employment or else this matter will continue to happen."}
{"text":"5 stars goes to the burritos.....zero stars for not answering their phone very often and not lowering their extremely loud, horrible music. Take out is the only way here, unless you're into the obnoxious Mill Ave scene."}
{"text":"If you go to Casa during the day expect to wait 10+ minutes to be greeted/have your order taken. Don't be surprised if you see the servers standing at tables socializing while you wait. Luckily we like the vegan options and the drink deals aren't bad"}
{"text":"Wife and I were looking for something different!!  AND WE FOUND IT!!!   Teryiaki burrito was the absolute bomb!  So looking forward to trying the Mac Green Chili next time out!!   Music was a little loud for my liking but still an excellent time all in all!!"}
{"text":"Don't go here with an out of state license without expecting to spend at least a half an hour outside the bar while the bouncer inspects, bends, asks five other people and then calls the cops to make sure that your IDs ARE in fact real. Then weren't even compensated for our inconvenient wait. Nothing like being 23 and 25 and treated like underage college kids. Maybe investing in a scanner would be a quicker solution."}
{"text":"Yea...no. I was a little put off that I had to surrender my ID when ordering a Moscow Mule because of the copper cups.  I guess the new thing is people are swiping these for the copper, but I guess there is nothing can be done about that.    I ordered the burrito bowl with chicken and it came out with beef and chicken.  I don't eat beef. When it came back to me sans beef it was completely different than what I ordered (different sauce, no guacamole, etc).  We had to continue asking the server for the drink menu as he kept taking it to give it to another table.  I had high hopes for this place for some reason but can't say I'm impressed enough to go back."}
{"text":"fun music and vacation atmosphere in the heat of tempe summer...

but we won't be back. 

margaritas were so salty, beers were watery, and food was too spicy - the kind of spicy that drowns out the flavor (and this is coming from a Thai-Hot kinda girl).  

Food/drinks are reasonable, but it was a total waste of money."}
{"text":"We had four parties convening on Mill Ave last Saturday for the Territorial Cup basketball game and, not wanting too much of a hassle, we agreed on the ol' \"first ones to find a good set up texts everyone else and we'll meet there.\" Jenny and I were the first to arrive and, after vetoing a couple chain establishments, found a table on the patio at CASA Sunba. 

Our server was excellent, discussing the draft and mixed drink selections with us, and taking care of our party as members trickled in. I enjoyed a couple beers and our friends had the street tacos, which they said were very good. The patio was the perfect place to people watch on a gorgeous game day.  

Plus the patio is dog-friendly which, as a dog lover, is a huge plus to me."}
{"text":"I've been here SOOOOOO many times and I have never been treated so horribly at an establishment until today. Two gentlemen invited my 3 girlfriends and I to their table and gave us PERMISSION to have champagne. When my boyfriend arrived, I went to dance with him, and one of the two guys saw, and he snatched the bottle from my friend's hands and claimed we STOLE his bottle. Only one of my friends had a small amount- no one else. We all had our own drinks. Then he tried getting aggressive and said my boyfriend popped the bottle- which he had just arrived. Nearby people even said we did not take items without consent, but we were wrongfully accused and asked to leave. Casa supports chauvinistic men who are just there to pick up women and kick them out when rejected. I haven't been to Mill Ave in over a year and I remember why now. 0 stars if possible!"}
{"text":"C.A.S.A. how I have tried to like you. I would say I've been there 30+ times and certainly more than that if you consider it's previous life as Chronic Taco (same owner, same problems). For the purpose of this review I will stick to the outside bar since that is where I have spent of the majority of my time. 

I will start out with the one positive that the food here is fairly decent for inexpensive bar food. They have a creative twist on several entrees that make it worth the occasional stop in. 

Location-wise the sun makes it difficult to enjoy this place year around and it can be down right blinding during sunset. Location isn't what really kills this place though. It is the lack of any operational savvy by the management team and disengaged owner. I certainly see Scotty there fairly often but he never seems very interested in anyone other then his friends. I often joke when I get dragged here that they will certainly mess up my drink run out of a key ingredient (like soda water) or just in general make a mistake. However, it's not even the mistakes that kill this place for me. It's the horribly rude bartenders and managers. It's so bad it's almost funny. They give me someone else's credit card back and glare at me like it's my fault ? Ok C.A.S.A. . I've tried. I hope you are successful, but I just can't come here anymore."}
{"text":"If you type in \"vegan\" while you are standing on Mill, Casa comes up. I was trying to take non vegan friends to a vegan place. Well, while I ALWAYS appreciate vegan options at ANY establishment, Casa is not a vegan restaurant. 

It's more of a bar or patio club. Fun for more of a drinking atmosphere. Maybe if a collage bar scene is what I was looking for, my review could be better. 

That being said, we had the vegan tacos. They were ok, but not excellent. Once again, I love any place willing to give the option, and I certainly liked them more than eating meat! They were just sort of plain. 

Another cool option I love in any place is the ability to do lettuce tacos instead of tortillas! The call it \"Kush\" style here. 

The service was great, the outdoor seating is lovely, but don't be fooled, this is not a vegan restaurant. It's a bar, that serves tacos, with one vegan option. Kudos Casa!"}
{"text":"The bar vibe makes you feel like you could walk out onto a beach.
Coupled with their burritos this place is great!"}
{"text":"Typically I love this bar but I had an awful experience there the other night. When I went to the restroom the lock on the door ended up jamming. At first I was trying to stay calm and after a few minutes passed and many failed attempts at unlocking the door I realized I was locked in with no way out. I called my friends on the outside and tried to get people's attention. When they finally unlocked the door security very rudely asked me if I even tried unlocking the door and told me there was nothing wrong with the door.  They were not even concerned that I couldn't breathe and was starting to have an anxiety attack. They then kicked me out because they said I was 'too drunk' instead of asking if I was okay. 

P.S. A security guard named DJ recognized how poorly the situation was handled. So SHOUT OUT TO DJ FOR BEING NICE!"}
{"text":"Giving this place 3 stars because I have not tried their food but their drinks are great and an awesome deal. I came and tried the margarita bucket and was impressed...$10 for a bucket of a margarita is an awesome deal and they were delicious. I was not impressed with the service though. It took forever for us to get a menu and to ever see our server, we had to hunt him down for our check because he rarely visited us."}
{"text":"Deceptive pricing.   Bought a bucket sized beer.  Was told price was $9, which was already too much. Got the bill it was $14.  Bartender is a liar.  Don't do business with this place.  I'd give it a negative if I could."}
{"text":"Came back and this place was amazing. Our server Ali was super helpful probably the best in the business! I had the Mac and cheese burrito and it was out of this world. The buckets were fairly priced for a ton of alcohol. Definitely a bang for your buck."}
{"text":"I had a terrific first experience there, I admit I didn't try the food but the service was top notch , the drink choices and pours were good and the vibe (DJ) was excellent. It is a bit small and gets crowded but if you don't mind feeling a bit like a sardine give it a go. I'll be back there for sure!"}
{"text":"Did you say $5 don Julio shots?????
 $4 margaritas????? You can bet your *** that anytime you come here you will hear this. To me that is music to my ears! Why? Oh because I LOVE tequila. Just no gold tequila unless it's in a margarita that's okay. 

Now if you are already feeling it from prior drinks elsewhere and are looking to eat this is a place to come when you have friends with you to sit upstairs and take it easy and knock some more drinks back.  Because during the time you wait depending on your waitress you might have to wait a bit you might not. Now when my friend and I went on Friday we weren't concerned really on how long it took between things until we wanted to pay for our tab. Apparently the waitress was down stairs serving as well. We easily could have ditched our tab in which my friend was saying we should do but since it was Friday the 13th I felt like we would get bad juju for something like that. So we had to search high and low for this waitress of ours and told another waitress we needed to leave right now and had to get our waitress then she came running. When you are working multiple tables on multiple levels I don't expect prompt service on a Friday night just a good place to come for drinks really because the Mac and cheese burrito is okay at best. Nothing spectacular just better drunk food then filibertos nonsense!"}
{"text":"All I really have to say is 8$ BUCKET of margaritas... once I heard that I was in. Two of these bad boys and you're done. Also you get to keep the bucket, and refills that day during happy hour are cheaper! Amazing specials, live music, and mac n cheese burritos... that is all

Must check this place out!"}
{"text":"do not eat at this place the chicken taco's gave me family diarrhea, this place should be closed down for good. do not eat at this place you will get sick. you've been warned"}
{"text":"Me and my friend came here on a Sunday. We ordered a Mac and cheese burrito which was delicious and chips and salsa. The server forgot to bring the salsa at first. We weren't even mad, but they were so generous and brought us bean dip with our salsa! The atmosphere is great and everyone is really nice. Will definitely return"}
{"text":"I frequent Casa on the regular but will not be returning. My friend from the East coast flew in and I wanted to show him a good time on Mill Avenue with my first stop being Casa. Upon arrival, my friend was turned away because of his expensive shoes because they were \"high tops.\" We took our business elsewhere and will continue to do so. No reason was given for the exclusion of his footwear and the bouncer was very rude about it stating the manager on premise \"was not available.\""}
{"text":"This is a good place to eat, if you like to NOT eat your meal in peace! It's located on Mill Ave so that already describes the type of place that it is. It's an outside bar/restaurant, and I'd much rather go here to drink than to sit down and eat. They have an upstairs area as well but that too is also always crowded.

First time I came here I didn't know better to order beforehand so when I got there I had to awkwardly sit at the bar and order food while everyone else was socializing and drinking because apparently no one goes there to sit down and eat. I tried both the vegan burrito and the vegan tacos and that's this place's saving grace honestly because I wouldn't come here for any other reason! Second time I came I called in to pick up my order and even THAT wasn't helpful because no one knew where the heck my food was and they kept sending me on a wild goose chase to different people/places to find it, talk about no communication! 

The food itself however, OUTSTANDING! Both the \"carne asada\" burrito and taco vegan options are so delicious, it makes me not miss meat at all! It tastes just like something you would get an authentic Mexican restaurant, I couldn't even tell that it was made from plants! I will continue to come here for their vegan food for sure, but only if I call in AND if they know where my food is when I arrive!"}
{"text":"If you are on Mill Ave looking for a place to eat.....keep on walking!
There are far better places to go to than C.A.S.A.  It does look inviting and I had a totally different experience when I 1st went there, but my 2nd time....I will never go back.  We came with a group for a birthday lunch and a few of us already experienced the food and ambience, so we were excited to have a birthday lunch and let everyone in on the positive experience.  Holy Moly....with the exception of our waitress the service right down to chef Joey and the management staff was HORRIBLE.  The food presentation on ONE order was not up to par and that ONE order made this whole experience unexpectedly bad.  The veggie rice bowl was ridiculous in every aspect.  When it came out it looked like crap.  When the person questioned the order....OMG, chef Joey stormed out....and copped an attitude.  
How dare we....
It was so ridiculous it was almost entertaining.  He could barely contain himself when we questioned the veggie rice bowl.  I think he watched way too many Chef Gordon Ramsey shows.  Look at Sunny B's write up...then look at her pictures.  You will see what I mean.  Joey was so unprofessional, ready to fight and so unwilling to rectify the situation.  To make matters worst management came over to inquire about the situation and did nothing.  Not only did they not give any options or did not take the veggie rice bowl off the tab, it was a bad experience that 8 of us encounter and the 8 of will never come back.  Oh. Believe me we are telling our friends and co-workers avoid this place....because you don't want  to deal with Joey storming out of the kitchen!"}
{"text":"Great party place in Tempe. Good help, friendly and a great place to watch football on the weekend."}
{"text":"While back in Tempe for work a couple weeks ago, one of my employees and I were looking for a place to eat dinner before I had to catch a flight to Milwaukee.  I told her that we had to walk over to where Chronic Taco used to be for a moment of silence (check out my review on Chronic Taco.)  There appeared to be a business there, but we weren't sure it was open until a young man outside told us that since we were standing there, we HAD to come in.

Wow, am I ever glad that we followed his advice!

The place looks completely different from Chronic Taco (same owners, though, I'm told) and is a totally different vibe.  Since it was a Monday night during the sweltering heat that is Arizona in July, the place wasn't busy.  The very friendly (and hot) bartender told us we could sit wherever and brought us menus.  That's when I saw it....

MAC AND CHEESE BURRITO!  AHHHHHHHHHH!

Being from Wisconsin, seeing that made me very happy.  The fact that they had a vegan version made my employee happy, since she is vegan.  We both ordered ours with carne asada (mine real, hers fake) and it was by far the most delicious thing I've had in a long time.  The salsa in a bottle was heaven- great flavor, without too much cilantro, which is good, because I'm one of those rare people that cannot stand the taste of cilantro.

The only reason that I'm going with 4 stars here, instead of 5 is that had that guy not been outside to tell me that C.A.S.A. was there and open, we probably would have gone someplace else (and missed out on the heavenly mac and cheese burrito.)  There is nothing outside to lure you in.... but don't worry, I will be telling everyone how much I love it and can't wait to go back to Arizona.... which will NEVER be in July again."}
{"text":"Even though it was freakin hottt out I still had a blast. The DJ killed. I suggest ordering the bucket drinks and really get in a good spirit. Mist sprayers did help cool down the crowd. Cheap drinks and good music. Can't beat that."}
{"text":"This place never fails at being just terrible. Don't get me wrong, love the mojitos, but dang is the service just BAD. I always try to give it the benefit of the doubt thinking that they have GOT to have things figured out by now, but I am always wrong. Always. 

Shall I explain why? Oh ok, if you insist. 

One of the first times I was there, I ordered a salad. Waited 10 min for silverware. 2 of the MAIN ingredients were not present (pomegranates and avocado) . When I asked why they said they were out of pomegranates, and didn't know why the avocado wasn't on it. So they bring me the avocado, and might I add that it was 10 minutes AFTER I finished the wimpy salad. When I get my bill, guess what I was charged for...A SIDE OF AVOCADO. I voiced my issues to my server, and then never saw him again. Then drinks took forever, when it was not even busy. I just had it. I have never been so baffled with the service at a restaurant so I asked to speak to the manager just simply to tell him how things were going so he was aware of how things were being handled. Let's just say he wasn't good with constructive confrontation. 

Went there the other day and had the same lousy experience. BUT I do want to say that our server JAMILA was really nice and on top of things for our table. 

Just a few side notes of things that surprised me. 

1. 3 dollars for ROX. 
2. Signage of deals for the day/hour are not clear. 
3. The amount of ice they crush into the glass is very overwhelming. We ordered the buckets and it was all ice! I was bummed with how much of a buzz I didn't experience."}
{"text":"The chicken-fried Caesar salad is amazing.  Great outdoor seating. Bartender is very nice and helpful in recommending epic concoctions."}
{"text":"Great dive bar atmosphere. Tasty beer selection and the burritos are amazing! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I enjoyed this restaurant.  I had the Chicken Cesar  and really likes it.  The beer selection was nice.  There were plenty of  craft brews.  The two man band was good and fun.  I will come back!"}
{"text":"Had never even heard of Casa Lounge but so glad I discovered it!! We went to see our friend Marc Norman from Ghetto Cowgirl play and we were not expecting much... thinking typical dive bar on mill... Not the case at all!! This place has a great happy hour with amazing burritos!!! We will definitely be back!!! Thanks to our friend for introducing us to something fresh!"}
{"text":"DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS BAR.  The bouncers are not respectful and do not care about the well being of the customers.

Bar bouncer was mean and irresponsible on Thursday night May 10th. 
A drunk girl was removed from the bar. After removal she was standing by the misters outside the bar and a bouncer made her move about 3 feet away to the edge of the sidewalk by the street. A man from the bar handed her a styrofoam cup of water and the bouncer violently grabbed it from her hand and dumped the water into the street. The bouncer was an older white man with either very short hair or a shaved head. He had a few days of beard growth. 
I saw the drunk girl in the bar and had been watching her. She was drunk but was not causing any problems. 
She was clearly over served by the bar. I doubt they let her in that drunk. Each person that is let into the bar has to walk by a bouncer and show their ID. The bar is at fault either way as they either let her in drunk or served her too many drinks.
This is a college bar. The bouncers should be responsible adults who know how to handle students. This particular bouncer did not and should not be working there."}
{"text":"CASA is my favorite bar on Mill Ave! The live music is always entertaining, their burritos tickle my taste buds & it's a great place to people watch! Although it's an outside bar, the sprinklers keep us nice and cool. This place has a San Diego type of vibe to it, doesn't get any better....highly recommend!"}
{"text":"A terrible experience to say the least. I am 22 years old and have been going to CASA as a regular for the last year. Last night (after being in the bar for about half an hour) a bouncer tells me that I need to leave because I was wearing a headband.... because bandana headbands symbolize gangs?? And if they didn't have the white girl take it off then they could get sued for not applying same rules?? They also have a rule against wearing Air Jordan's or Timberlands. It appears as if it is more of a racist establishment than anything. I have spent a lot of my money here and live down the street. Will continue to give CASA horrible reviews for this incorrigible and unfair experience. So sad really, loved it until I hated it. It really bothers me that a local neighborhood spot could be so exclusive to particular patrons."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast, inside dining was closed just the patio was open. It was 30 degrees in Tempe this morning, I did not want to sit outside. I was so happy when they accomedated us to sit inside, they even went outside to the patio area and got us some coffee. Great staff and the breakfast burrito was yummy. I will go back again."}
{"text":"Coming from California, the only thing I knew about this place was their buckets and how fast you can get trashed. So when I was in town I knew I had to pass by. I came by on a Monday night so I can understand why it wasn't packed. It lived up to its hype but it wasn't anything super spectacular. 

The bucket is any cocktail in a small bucket. It took time to finish it and I was sharing! If I downed it I'm sure that I'd be drunk in an instant. My only thing is that there are no prices for the bucket on the menu. I heard that it was $8 but when we paid it was $16? Dunno if it fluctuates depending on the day but knowing that ahead of time would be nice."}
{"text":"Draft beers are served in plastic cups. Food is served cold. Enough said. I was really routing for this place because I thought the concept was cool and it is sometimes really packed."}
{"text":"Teriyaki open tacos are well worth the price. The bartender was pretty chill too. Worth a visit!

Update: The security really are as horrible as the reviews will lead you to believe. They offer water cups with lids, but you can't take them with you. After I dumped the liquid out, they still tried to yank the cup out of my hand!"}
{"text":"I went for a birthday party, it was during the day and it was pretty cool. It is a 2 story bar and grill. 

I'm giving it 3 out of 5 stars for two reasons: 1. There was only 1 waitress with at least 50 ppl waiting for service so she was super busy. 2. 

We've asked for certain things that was on the menu however, we were informed that they did not offer upstairs. We would have to go down stairs for what we wanted. So we had to settle for what they had upstairs. 

Their bucket drinks of Long Island were good. The drink will sneak up on you fast! All the drinks are made fresh, there are no mixers!"}
{"text":"The chips and salsa here are great.  The salsa is homemade and you can taste it.  Second, the atmosphere and location are casual and convenient.  That's the end of the positives.

As for the rest of the food, the carne asada tacos were made with \"home made\" tortillas that tasted 3 days old and meat that was cooked 3 times as long as necessary.  It was like beef jerky wrapped in a dry corn husk.  The mojito was incredibly weak and had not a hint of rum.  The pastor sandwich was ok but forgettable. 

The management was worst of all.  We were told by our server upon arrival that it was happy hour and beers were half off.  When we received our bill, beers were full price.  When the server was confronted he apologized and spoke with the manager; he returned to us saying there was nothing he could do and he fought for us.  The manager never stopped by the table or said a word to our table about the miscommunication.  Whoever the manager was today should be fired and ashamed for being a coward; you're an embarrassment.

Bottom Line:  do not go here.  Take your money and go anywhere else."}
{"text":"Probably one of my favorite bars in Tempe. Love the outdoor seating as well as the roof top. Their burritos are incredible. They had some live music going on one night I was there. Really wish they would do more of that."}
{"text":"Tried to call the restaurant on Sunday as we think we left our credit card there. Try call the number and its says \"Can't take your call right now\" . Messaged them on Facebook and they did respond stating they were in fact open on Sundays. I asked if I could get a valid phone number, no response. They messaged me and told me I have to drive back and ask if the card is there. We are visiting and have no card. They refuse to provide a valid phone number. Not sure how they supposedly take reservations or run a business without every answering their phone. Not very friendly customer service."}
{"text":"Service was bad and bathrooms were practically porter potties. Dana was a cool bartender though, and so was another girl that I never caught the name of."}
{"text":"some loser ass security guard with slicked back black hair took my bucket after the server said i could have it. get a life"}
{"text":"Terrible service. The server(Kayla) had an attitude and was rude when my friend asked to turn one of the portable heater. Security never ID'd us at the door but when my friend and I wanted to use the restroom and take pics they decide they wanna ID us.Came as a group to celebrate a friends birthday and will not be back, and won't recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Great place, Patrick the bartender was super attentive and explained the food options in such detail you couldn't mess up the order. Mac n Cheese burrito and Carne Asada tacos were great, def brought some home. Not sure about some other reviews about this place, but I had a great time! Please keep it up guys. Very relaxed with great vibes btw.


Another great experience, I brought my friends dad, a POW fighter pilot and his service dog. We all had a great experience, many thanks to our server Halie(sp?) super awesome. Just one of many visits to come! Thank you guys. It meant the world to get my friends dad out of the house and him have a great time! Can't at thank u enough"}
{"text":"Shame on everyone at CASA, including the security guards, that sat and watched a belligerent man hit a woman in the face and did NOTHING.
People. We are human. Remember to look out for one another. We out here just trynnna eat some tacos, and our hearts break as we watch this happen at a place we love. Nobody wanted to step up. Nobody wanted to call police. Everyone just snapchatted, laughed, and instigated this type of unacceptable behavior. I'm disappointed, but proud that my friend I were raised better than to let something so disgusting go by unhandled.

For the record, I have been to CASA almost every weekend. To see people I recognize working and doing nothing about this situation has really left a bad taste in my mouth. It's a shame because out of all the places on mill CASA really has the best drinks and music, but to see their workers so immature about a situation like this WHICH WAS HAPPENING ON CASA PROPERTY is pathetic. This happened on September 18th 2017, so for whichever CASA employee in charge of monitoring this yelp page...I highly suggest you go back to that day and see who was working because they represented CASA in the most negative light."}
{"text":"I had a friend come from out of town to visit and he was denied entry because he was wearing basketball shoes. He wore nice jeans, a polo, but got dress coded for wearing \"high top shoes\". Didn't realize Mill turned into Vegas over night. None of the bouncers could give a justification for the policy. Gladly went and spent our money at other bars."}
{"text":"We were sitting outside having lunch. One of their guys dropped a whole tray on the sidewalk. They just left it. Did not care people had to walk in it. Didn't care. I watched 4 employees walk over it. Sick wrong. Nice."}
{"text":"I went to Casa a few weekends ago with a girlfriend. I've realize the wait staff on Mill Ave in general isn't that great but Casa may take the cake for the worst. The waitress we had appeared to be drunk. The drinks were so so and expensive. I like that they have a dog friendly patio, but that's about it."}
{"text":"This place is fun. The staff are friendly and welcoming - seems like a good place to work. We were there mid-day on a weekend and the crowd was mostly younger. Good beer selection and they have a 32 oz. bucket gimmick that looks like a good idea if your intention is to get drunk. AND there's a Vegan section on the menu. 

Mr. H asked about sides and the waitress said the burritos are huge and a side would go to waste. The burritos are pretty big, but Mr. H needed a few bites of mine and a beer. So if you're a hungry man or have the appetite of one, you might want to order some chips with your burrito, or have two beers. Burritos are Chipotle size.

I ordered the Humanitarian burrito, which is like a salad burrito - fresh, tasty, filling, but still felt healthy-ish. Mr. H's Solo Mexicana burrito was equally tasty and filling, but a little heavier and he loved it. Great vegan variety/options. We will definitely be back and would love to take friends and family here (probably not at night on a weekend, though, because, it's Mill Ave.).

We didn't see the inside, or the roof top patio, but the street level patio is similar to a Dos Gringos without all the bright colors. They had misters on the patio that spray outward in the direction of the sidewalk at chest level, which worked because it was breezy. Smoking could definitely be a problem here because they allow it on the patio and even if someone who's smoking walks by, you can't avoid it. The patio is dog friendly, but it is not enclosed so make sure your pups don't escape and run into traffic!"}
{"text":"Saturday funday with the beau and pup. Got there at about 2 - there were about 3 other tables there. Pretty dead ish. Solid service, not amazing, but solid. They were very sweet and welcoming to our fur baby - great pet friendly patio. They even have a chicken and rice dish for $5 for 4 legged family members! Such a cute idea. On a 100 degree day the patio was cool and comfortable. Misters and fans do a great job. Ordered the nacho app - hands down the best nachos I've had in years. Great portion. We shouldn't have finished it because it was so much, but we did cuz it was so good! Carne Asada was so flavorful that we had to follow it up with the steak and potatoes burrito. Nom nom nom. By the time we left at around 4 the place was packed. New favorite spot."}
{"text":"Please stop by c.a.s.a. and see for your self their food is amazing, Mac n cheese burrito with carnitas is to die for, OG burger with a fried egg is the best burger I have ever had no joke, c.a.s.a. loaded fries are crazy good just picture it string fries topped with a four cheese sauce, black beans, pico de gallo, carnitas(shredded pork), bacon and a jalapeño sour cream....mmmmm. Or how about a fresh fruit mojito nice and strong with premium rum. I recommend the rasbery mojito and the orange and cucumber mojito, or how about their 3 amigos premium margarita only 4 dollars. Shots of fireball for only 3 dollars, or a shot of Don Julio blanco for only 5 bucks, you can get a beer and a shot for only seven bucks cant beat that they even have a sky bar on the upper deck where you can get many different sky fusion flavors for only 3 dollars, this is my favorite spot."}
{"text":"I love this place...I've been here 3 times now, and love introducing it to new people. The burritos are awesome and I enjoy the staff. To be fair, you have to dig the vibe they give. If you're expecting a fancy, sit-down restaurant, don't come here. This is still a bar at the end of the day, and the most popular dive bar I've ever seen. I love it"}
{"text":"Never even got to try the food. Had a server walk past us 3 times and not talk to us at all while we were sitting in her section. Finally moved to the bar because we were sick of waiting and the bartender knew nothing about the menu. she then told us if we wanted a mojito we had to go downstairs to get our drinks. Sat there for 40 minutes and didn't get a drink or food. Supposedly their food is great, but they definitely need a staff check."}
{"text":"One of my favorites on Mill. Pretty chill before 9-10pm and the best variety of burritos you've seen. I highly recommend the Chinese take out burrito!"}
{"text":"I had a great time at Casa this afternoon while the manager of Casa told me to \"eat shit and fuck off\".

We were enjoying our afternoon at Casa when the neighboring table decided it would be a prime time to light up a cigarette. I don't take kindly to inconsiderate smokers thinking they can smoke wherever they want so I told the guy to put his cigarette out. He decided that his right to poison himself was more important that anything else and jumped up and immediately got in my face.

This guy started yelling at me while I stood my ground and said to the guy that if he touched me I would love to defend myself by any means necessary and get the nearby cops involved. He got really aggravated and kept yelling at me a few inches away from my face. Eventually he realized he wasn't going to win the fight and calmed himself down. A minute later the manager came over and started yelling at our group.

I told the manager what happened: how the guy at the table next to use tried to assault me on their property. The manager didn't care to hear my side of the story and instead kicked me and my friends out of Casa because I told the guy to stop smoking.

Fortunately I can use the internet to find out what the law in Arizona is with smoking on a patio. I'll quote from http://azdhs.gov:

\"For an area to be designated as an outdoor patio where smoking is permitted, the area must meet the requirements defined in the rules A.A.C. R9-2-108. This area must be a contiguous area of the public place or place of employment and controlled by the proprietor of the public place or place of employment. This patio area must have at least one side that consists of: ...

- Have no overhead covering or an overhead covering that consists of:

    a. Permeable material, or
    b. A combination of open space permeable material\"

The crazy thing is Casa has an overhead covering that is a combination of open space permeable material. Great thing they are aware of Arizona laws!

I came back and asked if the owner was available to let them know about their violation of Arizona laws. Instead I was greeted by the same bouncer/\"manager\" that kicked us out earlier. I tried to tell him that Casa was breaking the law and he laughed in my face and literally told me to fuck off. Very professional. I have reported Casa to the Arizona Department of Health Services and I hope they do an investigation. 

I will never return to Casa after the ridiculous treatment I received from the so called \"management\". I felt like I was talking to a toddler in the middle of a tantrum rather than a manager of a bar on Mill Ave."}
{"text":"Used to love it here. Great food & drink spot without it being too crazy for Mill. Recently over-priced drinks & now even poorly made. New weird staffing issue between upstairs/downstairs - so don't try to switch if you decide to hang out longer than expected... New wait staff & bar tenders please!"}
{"text":"I went to Casa, ordered my first drink of the night and got squirted with a water gun by someone standing near the entrance of the bar. The water soaked my shirt, shorts, and some of the droplets landed in my crown and coke that I had just ordered. 

I got up and walked to the front and asked the guy who squirted me nicely to please not squirt me with the water gun. Turns out after I saw his t-shirt close-up, that he was one of the security guards (Jason). 

He explained that he was trying to squirt a female patron that was standing near me. I said no big deal man and please avoid squirting your gun my direction because some of the water landed in my drink and I'll have to order a new one. 

I returned to the bar and found my original watered down (literally) drink gone. As I was ordering the replacement, the same security guard came up and said I had to go and tossed his water gun at me. Pretty pathetic that I disrupted his attempt to score with one of the female patrons! At any rate, this was my first and last time visiting this establishment. Typically, immature and childish behavior on this level is attributable to a poor management style. 

Fortunately, I make enough money to go to LA or Las Vegas on the weekends which is where I will be going after I move to Phoenix in July and complete the purchase of my new house.

I would not recommend this place to my worst enemy. Just imagine if I had been tipsy or intoxicated.. He would have probably called Tempe police and tried to have me arrested."}
{"text":"I have to give this place a 5 star rating. We ordered the trio sampler appetizer. I loved the bean/cheese dip. Didn't care as much for the hummus. I ordered the pulled pork burrito and it came with mac n cheese and potato salad inside. This was one of the best things I have ever eaten. My friend ordered the thanksgiving dinner burrito with stuffing cranberry sauce mashed potatoes and turkey with gravy on the side also one of the most delicious things. I am glad I got to split these because they were both so good and one burrito is plenty for one person. I loved the atmosphere and music. The waitress was nice. Wish she filled my water a bit more but still good overall."}
{"text":"Have been here twice now, and am struggling between 2 and 3 stars.
I haven't had any problems with the food (mac and cheese burrito is awesome, big enough for 2 separate meals).

The service is horrible. Both times it took almost 20 minutes to get food and the place was not busy by any means. Server didn't check in at all and we had to ask for the bill and water refills. When asked questions about what was in the food, the server had no clue.

Also - our PLASTIC utensils were dirty! It seriously looked like they re-use plastic utensils. It couldn't even be wiped off with a napkin. Both my friend and I had to dip our napkin in our water glass in order to clean the plastic utensils. Why would plastic utensils be so dirty like this - GROSS!!!

Also, during the day when there is no one on the patio and the big doors are closed, we seriously thought this place was closed. It needs to be a little more inviting on the outside. 

Sorry, but I miss Chronic Taco!!"}
{"text":"Had a great experience. Had very cheap beer, half price during the day for draft beer. Bartender was even better. Gabby was a great bartender who was very quick and gave great conversation. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere in the evenings and a cool vibe. I could have had better service on an occasion or two but I would attribute it to an inexperienced server. Will give it another chance and worth checking out."}
{"text":"We recently visited Arizona and this was one of the spots where we ordered food from. Now as far as their vegan choices, I'm not sure if things recently changed but the menu only showed the mock carne asada burrito and tacos, nothing else. I asked the bartender and she said that it was all they served that was vegan. So if you are looking for a variety they are not going to have a variety. The bartender was friendly and helpful with all of my questions and the order took about 20 mins for 6 carne asada burritos, 5 tacos and 2 sides of guacamole and chips $100. What took off 2 stars for me are their prices for what you get and the fact that the \"carne asada\" tasted weirdly like a sweet and spicy Mongolian beef (which sounds appetizing, but not when you are looking for something resembling closer to a California carne asada burrito). My kids ate a couple of bites but didn't finish it because of the flavor and spice involved and after I had a night full of tummy aches with them. My husband and I found the burrito to be average in size and taste but not what we expected and not worth the price."}
{"text":"For the BEST caipirinha anywhere, go to Casa and ask for Vinny. Caipirinha is the national cocktail of Brazil, and for a truly authentic experience, Vinny is your man!  CASA also has delicious fish tacos, so for an unforgettable Sunday afternoon, caipirinhas and fish tacos at Casa with Vinny is the way to go!"}
{"text":"Insulted, verbally abused, disrespected, and one of the worst customer service experiences we have ever had in the state of Arizona. Not only did the manager yell at one of our family members, but was trying to make something be blown way out of proportion.

One of our family members ordered carne asada fries with no spicy flakes. They came back with chicken fries with a ton of spicy flakes. Waitress said we don't have carne asada \"sorry\" and that was fine so we said can you take it back since we didn't order chicken nor spicy flakes.

Then another waitress said \"oh we do have carne asada\" so we reordered and emphasized that we didn't want spicy flakes or spicy seasoning on the carne asada. She received this order and understood \"no spicy.\" Sure enough our order came out and there was extra spicy flakes on it. We were puzzled and didn't want to disturb our server again so our family member just ate a few fries. When we told the waitress that we didn't think it should be on the tab. The male manager got involved. 

He was disrespectful, talking down to us about fries that we multiple times ordered to be non spicy. Sure this is one small order mistake but got escalated real quick. The manager gunned down us with verbal abuse and making us feel like we were stupid. 

Never never never never never returning to this place ever again. As a yelp elite I've come across some bad service but this one takes the cake! Adios and never again!"}
{"text":"I am totally giving CASA five stars because this hole in the wall establishment is genius!! The food is amazing!! I have had the loaded fries burrito and OMG.... Mind. Blown!
Sooo good, so huge and stuffed with yummy ingredients ! You wouldn't think their burritos would work, but it is freaking awesome! 
They brought me the nachos and I almost fell out of my chair because they were MASSIVE... You definitely get what you pay for here!

The only think I can add is that it was a little dirty and had a funny smell, but I think that lent to the ambience !"}
{"text":"The worst spot on Mill.

I will preface with the only reason I went back to this place - El Jefe was on a 30 minute wait and I had a concert to get to at the Marquee so I was pressed for time. 

The food was horrendous:
4 people ordered steak tacos on flour tortillas - 4 people got steak tacos on corn. The steak was cold, flavorless and chewy.

The bean dip, also cold was full of lard and tasteless (I'm not even sure how they did this to those poor pinto beans). 

Our waitress was subpar and the music made me want to shove a fork in my ear. 

Not going back, ever."}
{"text":"I really don't come here for any other reason than to sit outside and enjoy a bucket of their beer with friends. Their outdoor patios are what really entices customers, not really anything else. I've never had good service there, the food is alright, definitely more enjoyable after a few buckets of their drinks. The service is absolutely abominable, but I don't blame the servers/bartenders, I blame the owner who is drunk and obnoxious 95% of the time. I will come back, but will do my best to avoid sitting next to the owner who made his intention of the evening giving himself and surrounding patrons lung cancer from his disgusting chain smoking habit. Gross."}
{"text":"Casa is a pretty cool place
All patio bar, too and bottom floor
I didn't notice until last week that they have a lounge on the East side of the building, I will have to check that out. The Mojitos at Casa are really good and the bartenders are very nice and friendly. The crowd that goes to Casa varies but mostly younger college 20 year olds. Seating can also be a hit or miss depending on the day. Will have to come back to try the street tacos."}
{"text":"While street parking is available we ended up parking in one of the area underground garages.  At just $3 it's less of a headache that driving around trying to find a spot.  We walked up to find that C.A.S.A. was essentially an outdoor bar we were a bit thrown off.  No biggie but it's something worth noting.  Dining outside in Arizona can be pretty toasty.  Thankfully they have the usual misters that take the temperature down a notch.

It's also worth noting that after doing some research we found that there is an indoor 'club' area where food is also served.  We had no clue since the entrance was tucked away behind a wall. Not to mention, we went by the sign that said, \"Order food at the bar.\"  Once again, no biggie.

Unlike their online menu their menus at their location not only provide photos but are clearly marked which burritos can be made vegan.  In addition, when talking to the bartender they gave us the heads up about vegan options as well.  There was a wide variety of fare....all made into burritos.  I chose the Mac and Cheese while my husband went for the Chinese Takeout.

I will say it wasn't the best vegan mac and cheese I've ever had, but it still hit the spot and had a little bite to it.  As for my husband's burrito.  It contained fried rice, chicken, and spring rolls....yes, all inside of the burrito.  There were absolutely no complaints from him.

While I wasn't blown away by our experience we found ourselves in Tempe the following week and decided to stop again.  This time around I tried the veganized Chinese Takeout burrito.  Winner!  That vegan Chinese Takeout burrito kicked butt.  The tofu was perfectly prepared.  Not too squishy, not too tough.  And the taste was delicious. Definitely a repeater. My husband enjoyed the street tacos he ordered but he was quick to admit that he wished he had gotten the Chinese Takeout again.

When you arrive at C.A.S.A. chances are you're not going to get warm and fuzzies like you would if you entered your local bar.  That's not to say the staff isn't polite, it's just a different vibe.  Add in the heat of eating outside and attempting to shout your order to the bartender over the loud music, and  I'm sure some may not be that thrilled with the experience.  For us it's no big deal.  For the chance to get our hands on some food that comes with a different spin and has vegan options we found it worth stepping outside of our normal comfort zone.  We will definitely be returning to try the remaining concoctions that are offered."}
{"text":"My salad with Chorizo was delicious and well priced. My coworkers loved their Mac and cheese and salad too. Service was excellent. Our server made a coffee run to get me some iced coffee. It was so nice. I don't know why this place has such low stars. The atmosphere was great too and the patio was packed on a Tuesday afternoon."}
{"text":"When one burrito isn't enough get two  C.A.S.A sun bar on mill ave is a fun place for happy hour!! Burritos and buckets, you can't go wrong with that specially with their unique burritos as you can see the Mac and cheese burrito on the top and the \"Chinese take out \"  on the bottom which includes 2 egg rolls and fried rice and their special orange chicken. Talk about a fusion! Try it out now in Tempe !  #tempeeats #phxeats #azfoodie #bestfoodphx #azeats"}
{"text":"CASA used to be my favorite place on Mill Ave. I went there for lunch at least once a week because the Mac & cheese/ BBQ chicken/ coleslaw burrito was so freaking amazing esp with the salsa they used to make. I literally used to take everyone who visited me to CASA to eat this burrito with their salsa because I considered it to be an iconic food of Tempe. 

Today I finally went back to CASA after a long time because I was dyyying to eat this burrito again. I got there and was super disappointed to see that the entire menu has changed. I got the new carne asada / Mac & cheese burrito. Which was just astonishingly gross and chemically tasting. I took about 3 bites and boxed it up hoping my bf's stoner roommate will some day be high enough to consume what would otherwise be a sad waste of ingredients. 

Sad to say it but, RIP CASA. 
Only the buckets can save you now."}
{"text":"I used to love coming here for a girls night or to start the night off with a good drink. Until I watched my bartender poor only cranberry and sprite from the shooter into my bucket. No alcohol. I watch my drink since I am a female and young and you all know how that goes. So I watched her make my drink. I asked for a vodka cranberry and sprite.....I get my drink back with NO vodka. I told her \" you didn't put the vodka in\" and she goes \" um.......yeah? ....I did!\" Like as if she couldn't remember adding it in or not. My drink was super bubbly...and as a social drinker you would know the alcohol dilutes the drink. I go over to my friend who had ordered the same and hers tasted completely different than mine. Mine tasted like straight up sprite and cranberry juice. So I go to the other bartender and I asked him to add vodka in it and he says \"why?\" And so I explain what happened and he tells me \" but why would she do that?\" Like ummmm I don't know? You tell me! He continues to argue with me saying she wouldn't do that when I had watched her make my drink! He didn't help me and I ended up just leaving my drink at the bar. Needless to say me and my friends don't come here anymore."}
{"text":"The security guards at this place SUCK hardcore. They totally ruin what could be a great bar. They take their jobs waaay too seriously and they're super aggressive and straight up disrespectful to people. The bouncer at the front was such a jerk too. He let my other friends in then stopped me (the last one in our group) and then closed the rope and wouldn't let me in as he stood there talking to this other girl, all while holding, flicking and bending my ID for about 2 minutes before he let me in. Wtf?? He saw we were a group then just kept only me back in line while playing with my ID? Wtf is that? So messed up. When he finally gave me back my ID and let me in I snatched it from him and muttered a few words that I'm pretty sure he heard. Such a jerk. These guys need a reality check. Get over yourselves. 
Also - there weren't any paper towels in the girls bathroom all night AND the air dryer didn't work, which I thought was ridiculous."}
{"text":"I've been by here quite a few times and it started really good. They had amazing burritos. They were different and you might have been scared to try them but once you had them you loved them. The Chinese take out and the green chili mac and cheese ones were awesome! However, now I would not come for food. Thier menu options now are very limited. As in 4 options just need to decide if you want it in a burrito, bowl or taco. And the four items they have literally tap basics. So you want steak, chicken, pork or shrimp? Then decide taco, burrito or bowl and that's literally the menu. So you would think with limited items they would master those right? They were ok nothing bad but nothing I'd remember either which is bad if you want repeat business. 

Only reason I gave any stars is because staff is always awesome and if all I wanted was to just sit and drink it would be a great place. So yea if you just want drinks, this is a good place. Food, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Awful place. Awful service. If you want to find the douchebags on Tempe go here, including the staff. The manager just kept staring at the girls coming in and didn't care about any of the customers. I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Came her with my girlfriend for a Friday afternoon lunch and drinks...must say...awesome! The food is fantastic and they have a ton of vegan options. Personally I had the terryaki chicken burrito and it was great! The girlfriend got the vegan carne asade burrito and loved it. Make sure to check out their deal with the \"booze\" cup and save yourself a ton on mixed drinks. Our bartender, Misael, was awesome and very attentive. We will be coming back!!!!"}
{"text":"love this place, chronic burritos...when i went there last time, my boyfriend and i had looked through the menu before we left. when we got there, they were making a bunch of changes to the menu and didn't really have much!! at least compared to the usual menu...just would have been nice to see that online! they said their new menu wouldn't be ready \"for awhile\", was just wondering if anyone knew about the status of that. still minimal menu or what?"}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Plus they had a dog food menu. We had the teriyaki chicken burrito and the stake tacos. They also have a large beer selection on tap."}
{"text":"Love this place! The staff is so nice and welcoming! I love the atmosphere of people! The mac n cheese and breakfast burrito is my fav and so is the salsa! On Sundays they have $3 mimosas til 3pm with freshly squeezed orange juice, better than RnR in my opinion. I also love that it's pet friendly, so I can take my little Yorkie there with me. They give your dog water and they also have a dish specifically for dogs if you need to order it."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best bars on Mill. CASA has both an outdoor section that is more of a bar and an indoor section that is a club (typically only open on the weekends). The bucket drinks are a great deal and refills are only $5-6 if you feel inclined. Overall it's a good atmosphere although the music selection can be odd and outdated. I'd recommend finding a seat upstairs where it's also easier to get bar service."}
{"text":"Multiple vegan options. An some are unusual, like a vegan carne asada as well as vegan quesadilla. We had both. It was a lot of food. And the homemade salsa has some heat. Recommended."}
{"text":"I love stopping by CASA on their outside balcony because you get a great view of Mill Ave and they have great specials. The special that reels us in time and time again is the $2 Coronas before sunset. We always make it right before sunset so we try to get as many beers as we can before they cut us off. It's nice sitting on the balcony sippin on some beers watching the sunset over Mill Ave. You gotta get them at the bar downstairs but we've ordered on the balcony and the bartender brings it up. (we just tipped a little better). We have tried their tacos, they are alright...pretty small but they're pretty cheap so you get what you pay for. Great spot for day drinking and I'd say a great deal if you are looking for a happy hour or a place with drink specials,"}
{"text":"We came on a Monday night and it was not packed at all. This place is very close to ASU. I've been told this is a place that you go to to get drinks that come in large buckets so you can get super trashed as quickly as possible. That sounds like my kinda thing so I wanted to try this place out.

One thing that really irked me was that for the buckets themselves, they didn't have the prices on the menu so you don't know how much they cost. I ended up ordering a Jack and Coke bucket that cost me $16. A friend who goes to ASU told me that they usually cost like $8-10 so I didn't know where I went wrong and had nothing else to compare it to. The bucket itself took a while to finish for two people but I still don't think it's worth $16. I can get a whole fifth of whiskey and liter of coke for $16 so that's gonna be a nope from me."}
{"text":"Get the buckets and the crazy burritos! Great place to Sunday Funday but at night or on slow times the place has a strange crowd of townies with dogs lol But bring a crew and get a round or 3 of buckets and it's like they're not even there!"}
{"text":"The steak dinner burrito is amazing! It has steak, mashed potatoes, gravy and peas in it! Service can be a little slow if they're busy but who cares!  Relax and enjoy the awesome burritos!"}
{"text":"The fact that this place has only 3 stars is criminal. The first thing you need to know is that you gotta go on a wednesday when they serve theyre amazing tacos. There are two that are high on the draft board and need to get scooped up. One is the mac n cheese fried chicken one, it is soooo goid. Awful for you but dope, the second one is the green chili pork one, soo fantastic. You cant go wrong. Beer is a little over priced but its a nice two story lounge. Super chill and puts you right on mill where you wanna be."}
{"text":"Blatant Racism! I wish I could give Casa zero stars. They don't even deserve one. I was there July 30th with two friends celebrating my 21st birthday. It was a Sunday night so the place was dead. We sat down and ordered our drinks. We were sitting right by the bouncer. Two African American men walk up, show their Id's and were turned away because of the SHOES one guy had on. These men were dressed nicely and were being polite JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE!!! The bouncer became cocky and laughed as he turned away the two men at the gate. I have never in my life experienced such blatant racism. If this is how CASA treats human beings, they deserve to be shut down. It's sad that in 2017 this is happening. My friends and I walked right out after the two men were turned away. I will never spend a single penny at this bar."}
{"text":"Went here on a Monday night with my girlfriend to kill time before a movie. We sat ourselves and waited for 20 minutes without a server coming over or anyone acknowledging our existence. I then went to the bartender and order 2 drinks. The bartender acted annoyed that someone ask about a drink. The bartender let me know she was sending a server out to bring the drinks. I returned to where I was sitting to wait another 20 minutes. A security guard then came to check our IDs and that my behavior was strange. After he scrutinized our IDs we left."}
{"text":"Came to buy a Corona and check out. The bartender gave me a large bottle, I asked if they carried the regular 12oz size, he said no. I told him I don't want the large one (was driving and didn't want to get a buzz), to which he tossed the bottle and walked away before I could ask what drinks they can serve in a cup or bottle. I tried getting his attention for five minutes after and was ignored the whole time. Way to deny a fellow Arizonan I nice cold drink pal.  Walked next door and enjoyed a cold one."}
{"text":"Holy crap. So I ran in Pat's Run yesterday as part of a group of about 30. Coming here was planned ahead of time and we had the whole top patio reserved for us. It was fun lots of good people, the weather was perfect, we were all high on endorphins. So we're there, everyone's hungry and eager to relax, have a drink and eat some good food. I was starving, like ready to gnaw my own arm off for a bit of protein.
So we discover there is one server for our party and wait patiently for our orders to be taken. Finally it comes to our turn.  I'm not sure if I some how offended our server, or pissed her off, but she did not like me. I don't know why, I was sitting there talking with friends the whole time. I wasn't loud, wasn't complaining about anything, this was in fact the first interaction I had with her. We were all dressed the same so it's not like she could say my outfit offended her,  I just don't know what her deal was. She took the orders of the three people on my right, then the person directly across from me, and then the two people on my left and started to walk off. I said \"excuse me\" twice and was not acknowledged. Someone else at in the group I was sitting with had to physically tap her on the shoulder and tell her to take my order. She did not apologize or even ask what she could get me. She stood there and stared at me. I placed my order and she walked off. A  few of us went down to the bar and ordered drinks, and then drank them and then stood there and waited...and waited...and waited. About 45 minutes after we ordered we noticed that people that ordered after us were getting their food. The food looked really good too. Big sandwiches, big burritos, and big bowls, which is what I ordered. The bowl was served in one of those Chinese take out boxes and consisted of eggs, meat (bacon, ham or chorizo), potatoes, onions and peppers and were full to the brim. So finally our server comes around and takes our drink orders. Another 15 minutes go by AND WE GOT FOOD!!! Well, everyone I was sitting with got food. I did not. I had started to notice that the portions were getting smaller and smaller. So everyone starts to eat and our drinks come out. Again, everyone but mine. 
Finally my food comes out after everyone I was with had finished their meals. 75 minutes after I ordered I finally had my food.The Chinese takeout box was less than half full and was getting cold. The bacon was limp and clumped together, the food was bland and tasteless. No salt and pepper, no flavor. Even the bacon was bland. THE BACON was bland! BACON! Ugh.I ate half. Still had no drink. By this point I was grumpy, hungry and defeated. I don't get it. I don't know what the deal was but  it is safe to say that I would never come back here."}
{"text":"so good. green chili pork mac n cheese burrito will change your life. Moscow mule is good here too"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times for drinks, but was worried about coming here to eat after reading some of the reviews.

A co-worker told me it was good so I decided to give their Taco Wednesday a try. I had the Chronic Taco and the Fried Chicken/Mac and Cheese Taco. The chronic was just average, but the other taco was great! The chipotle sauce was surprising spicy and the chicken was very moist.

The waitress was very nice and gave us free chips even though we didn't order drinks. The food came out pretty quickly too.

Overall a solid and filling lunch for $10."}
{"text":"Went here with a few friends for Sunday Funday, seating is hard to find so you may have to stand until you can grab a table... But the food is amazing!!

We ordered chips & guac to share for starters. The guac was made fresh & had a lot of flavor. For entrees my friends & I shared the Mac N Cheese burrito & chinese takeout & YES, it is as tasty as it sounds. The burritos are large & decently priced.

Service was decent & fairly fast. Great chill atmosphere if you are just looking to relax with some buddies... & also great live band!

If anything I will be back for the bomb burritos!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has always been one of my favorites. It has been through three transformations by the same owners. As a burrito shop, it was one of the best. I was a little disappointed when they restructured it to be C.A.S.A., but quickly fell in love with their unique sandwiches. Our work time crew frequently suggested this restaurant for lunch. We indulged in sandwiches such as The Fidel, and their amazing OG Burger ... until today. This is their first day of a new menu consisting mostly of burritos. Our lunch party was shocked. Our favorite selections were now gone, and in its place were several burrito choices. My choice was the #11 Chinese Buffet. A burrito with fried rice, spring rolls, and orange fried chicken. Sounds glorious right? The rice did not taste good, and there was too much of it. The orange chicken was good, but I was set off by the spring roles that remind me of the sort you find at the grocery store. The rest of my party of 6 were not impressed by their selections either. The only approval was a co-worker who selected the BBQ chicken with coleslaw and macaroni and cheese. This, is possibly the only edible thing on the menu. 

Had they taken contents of the old menu, and put them in burrito form, it may have been acceptable. The Fidel in a burrito? OG Burger with fried egg in a burrito? Glorious.

Enough about the food. There were some other issues. This is the first day of their menu, so some of this MAY be somewhat excusable. Our food took a long time, with one of our party waiting over 15 minutes for his meal while the rest of the group was eating. You would think that on their first day of a new menu, they would ask their regulars for input.

C.A.S.A. is now removed from our selection of lunch-time restaurants."}
{"text":"Unprofessional staff and can't handle the heat when a customer gives constructive criticism. There are other bars with that same great tasting food and drinks"}
{"text":"Be very careful if you're VEGAN The server brought me a burrito with chicken in it! 
I was eating.. what I thought was vegan burrito and the first bite into it I said wow I guess they have mock chicken.. but then I shredded it and it acted just as chicken. so when my bf asked the server she was like oh yeah that's chicken. I'm like wtf when I ordered my food I told you I'm vegan and I pointed and said the vegan option with Tofu! not once did the server apologize she was kind of bratty took my food and ordered the correct one for me. the wrong meal was not charged but the correct one was. not only was that so disrespectful regardless of why I'm vegan you should never serve a vegan person any animal products. needless to say I was so sick that night vomiting and had bad acid reflex. they did end up giving me the right burrito which was very good btw. but I'd never go back obviously they don't respect vegans as much as they seem to even though they do have options for us. vegan friendly? not so friendly."}
{"text":"Security said manager said no high tops. We couldn't get in with Nike high top boots. We walked away, but two white dudes came in with high tops and crocs. They got right in. Asked another security guard why they got in, and we didn't, they said the rule was made last week. Only sandals and low top vans//sketchers can get in. Can't even discuss how sickening it is that they're this way with their entrance selections. When two guys behind us got right in with the same shoes... it's honestly appalling."}
{"text":"If anyone can get them to answer the phone please share your secret! 

On a serious note, employees are extremely rude over the phone. If it wasn't for the delicious food I wouldn't go back.."}
{"text":"I was here for a race, and the marathon actually finished right on Tempe Beach so there are restaurants all around. This area is mostly all about the \"college town\" vibe but I love it! It has just the right amount of rowdy and laid backness for me. I kind of stumbled upon Casa and I am so very glad I did. Sweet music and the patio bar make this the most perfect hangout joint. There are lots of adult beverage options to choose from, along with 3 different ciders on tap, ALL delicious. Also get the carne asada tacos with lots of cilantro and onions. The tacos are just cheap enough for the broke college student (or traveler on a budget, either way) and so very good. The bartenders were super cool too. There's plenty of seating and it's all outdoors with big TV screens to watch the game. Go in January!! It's like 70-80 degrees every dang day out in AZ! I love it. Can't wait to go back in the not so HOT months and do some more exploring in the PHX/Tempe/Scottsdale area."}
{"text":"Went with a group of co-workers for lunch.  Patio was didn't have enough space for our large group as there were only a few tables open so we sat inside.  The service was relatively slow but done with a smile.  Our drinks took awhile to arrive and they screwed up two of our orders, one minor and one major that caused that person to get their food very late.  They were apologetic but didn't offer anything in the way of discount or free dessert.

Several of us ordered the mac and cheese burrito because it sounded amazing.  Was tasty, but very filling.  The chips and salsa was tasty and while we ordered just one portion it was enough for the whole table to try some.  Salsa was tangy and had a little heat.  Most of the group enjoyed their food although some at the other of the end of the table were not as pleased but I couldn't speak to why.

Overall not a bad place to eat but not good if you are in a time crunch. Probably won't be back for awhile but I can see really wanting to have that burrito again some day."}
{"text":"I have nothing bad to say which is shocking. I'm a food critic and this is the best and most interesting food on Mill. Bathrooms are updated and clean. Beautiful graffiti artwork and design. Amazing grass loft. Friendly chill good vibes. 5 stars and I've been here at least 20 times before writing this review. Awesome dog dish on the menu too."}
{"text":"They have a super fun patio with a great view of Mill Ave and A Mountain, it's perfect for when the weather is nice out in the fall and early spring. The booths are large enough for a big group to gather around a table and all see each other, which is nice. You don't always have that option at a bar. 

To drink: I ordered a Dark and Stormy and it's just like a Moscow Mule except with rum. I highly recommend it! 

To eat: If you are hungry, I'm a big fan of the Thanksgiving Dinner burrito and it's plenty to share for two."}
{"text":"\"You are alive. And you stand up and see the heat lamps on the patio and the people on Mill Avenue that make you wonder. And you're listening to that song, and eating that mac 'n' cheese burrito stuffed with green chile and shrimp. And in this moment, I swear, we are infinite.\" - Perks of Being a Wallflower"}
{"text":"Went here because my friend's band was playing. It is a small cozy little place, but is decent. They have a lot of local bands play, and they have decent prices. They do free refills on soda. And the fireball is $3.50 and you can get it as a fireball coke for the same as the fireball shot. So I'm happy cuz I like the fireball coke. I got hungry, so I decided to try one of their burritos.... They are a bit expensive... $9-$10 or so, but they are fairly big... I only ate half of mine and I was full. I got the Chinese take out which had crunchy sweet and sour chicken, fried rice, and egg roll bites in it. It is an interesting idea and may not sound very appetizing, but it is good. The only complaint I have is that it is a bit on the spicy side... I wasn't expecting spicy in sweet and sour chicken.... other than that it was great! Nice staff... however there is a $10 minimum if you're using card."}
{"text":"Wow What a Terrible Terrible place! Please do not go here!! My boyfriend and I wanted to grab a few bites to eat so walked down mill and I liked the outiside patio feel so we decided on that.  We ordered our food and we each got a specialty cocktail, I had a mojito which was actually pretty good and my boyfriend had some sort of fruity caiprihana, nonetheless he didnt like it and was so strong it over powered the taste.  Thats really not a big deal to me but what was so horrible is what happened after we asked our waitress if we could order something else for him, a few minutes later she was walking back with what I assumed was the bar manager DJ, well the way he marched down to our table holding the drink it was beyond obvious he was looking for a fight.  He started to argue with us over the drink and asking why we didnt like it, and actually told us that these are \"$10\" cocktails that you cant just send back while throwing the cocktail menu down on the table, umm what happened to customer service??  And he acted like we were some teenagers looking for a free drink, I've lived in plenty of places where the drinks are more than $10 so the fact that he had to mention the price showed me how pathetic this place is.  After about 5 minutes of back and forth arguing, and mind you so loud that I'm sure the other patrons could hear we asked him to take off the drink and left as soon as we could.  I couldnt even finish my food.  Please stay away from this place, I cant even believe this place is still in business after the horrible customer service we've experienced!"}
{"text":"They over charged me well tipped Themselves $10  which is BULLSHIT when I go all the time we had 5 ppl two tabs and tipped $24 cash so they are greedy as hell"}
{"text":"We stopped in for a drink.  It was very hot outside but they did have the misters going. I wanted to go upstairs but it was closed.  Next time I want to check out the upstairs.  Downstairs was a bit crammed outside."}
{"text":"I went to CASA with a friend on Friday to get a couple drinks. We had tried to go here a few weeks back, but the place was way too packed. On this night, we were able to sit up at the bar under a heater, which was perfect. This place has a surprisingly nice cocktail menu, with many imaginative options. I had their take on a Moscow mule, the light and stormy. It was fairly tasty, but not fantastic. My friend had their take on a white Russian... and this thing was fabulous! It was a white Russian with rumchata in it and cinnamon on the top.... so good! They also have a wide variety of beers on tap. My friend was talking about one of the beers and before I could tell her to ask for a taster, she had one... now that's good service. I'd like to come back to try some of their interesting food options (mac and cheese burrito... oh ya!)."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely HORRIBLE. I live very close to mill so I go to a lot of different restaurants and I'm completely surprised this place is even open considering how shitty they treat customers. I think her name was Gabby and she just seemed inconvenienced that we were there even though it was the middle of the day and dead. Wanted to get food too but thought that would be too much to ask...I'll stick to my other spots."}
{"text":"Nothing special here. I've been here a few times for happy hour and can't say I've been impressed on any account. I like the concept of the outdoor bar but the service has been sub par in my experience. Don't be fooled by the $1.50 tacos; they come in bite sized portions. I'd recommend trying something else in the area."}
{"text":"Casa sunba is a unique location and concept.  It takes a lot of guts to have a outdoor restaurant serving lunch in Tempe in the summer.  There is also a indoor area with a concert venue however during my lunch visit it wasn't open so that will be another review.
First of all the beer selection is pretty decent with several varieties on tap.  There is also a full bar.  Even though this is a outdoor only place, the abundance of misters and fans keep it pleasant out.  The food is also where the uniqueness of this place really shines.  The majority of the choices are burritos but definitely not the normal kind.  Mac and cheese, fried chicken dinner and Chinese takeout are some of the options.  I had the BBQ chicken dinner burrito as it was the special of the day and although it was good it did suffer slightly by the mac and cheese and cole slaw in the burrito taking a lot more real estate then the chicken and really overpowering it.  My son was joining me for this trip and he had the vegan steak burrito and it was excellent.  I don't know what they are using for their steak substitute but it is amazing, it tastes and feels exactly like real meat and has a delicious flavor.
The service while adequate was somewhat lacking but I think this was mostly because the bar was only staffed by one bartender and she seemed to be having a hard time keeping up with a busy lunch hour.  All in all a decent place with a unique concept that I will be trying again."}
{"text":"Brunch is awesome here. Although their selection is limited to burritos and tacos, it was still very delicious. I was able to being my dog and get him food too. Mimosas are bomb and so cheap. Loved it. Will be returning for the ahi tacos again!!!"}
{"text":"Came for Sunday Funday! It was great!! I love the space! The mimosas were only $3. The DJ was perfect! I will definitely go back. Didn't try food but saw a ton of ppl with the burrito so I'll have to check it out next time."}
{"text":"They have an interesting selection of burritos (i.e: thanksgiving dinner, mac n' cheese). So a group of us went out for a birthday for a happy hour meal. We ordered drinks and then our food, so far so good. Drinks came back, I had ordered a well so I knew the alcohol wouldn't be prime, but it tasted pretty bad. My fault, I should've known better. Moving on, we get our food after a decent wait, it was pleasantly hot. So after it cools we dig in, the burritos lacked flavor, general consensus from everyone at our table. So time finally comes for us to pull the trigger and demand our tabs after waiting for our server/bartender, the guy put it all on one check. Splitting the check was an extremely difficult task for him, commanding a computer to do it must've been too much for him to handle. After he messed up splitting it up a few times I questioned my total and he decided to return my question with a condescending rude response. Moral of the story: buckets of alcohol aren't a good deal, the food is bland, and the staff are the worst part. Won't be going back. I would rather use my bucket to shit in."}
{"text":"I was in town to hang out with a friend and was taken to CASA. It's definitely a college bar, lots of college kids there. 
I really like there $10 bucket drink deal. 
At one point though they took our table to make room for more people which was odd. They took about 6 tables out which kind of sucked."}
{"text":"Fun, casual restaurant.  Friendly staff, Good vegan options, nice drink menu. I would definitely return here when in Phoenix"}
{"text":"Although I am only giving it 3-Stars and could find a list of things that are awfully wrong with it, I'm going back! 

I had read the bad reviews about the service...blah blah blah...but they are true.  Its not just that one bad server is destroying the whole place. The whole bar is a mess.

Bad things: 
1.  Girls Softball playing on every screen when the NBA playoffs are on?  wtf?
2.  Mojitos took forever! 
3.  Street Tacos took even longer!  damn.  But then we found out our server forgot to ring them in. nice. 
4. Service was so random and they couldn't decide who was taking our table.  When we left, we still didn't know who our server was. 
5.  This is listed as a \"tapas\" restaurant on Yelp but most definitely is not.  It just has a random assortment of California-type Mexican food items.  
6.  They have so many staff memebers/security guards on that its overwhelming.  I understand the owner is trying to prepare for the unexpected but damn, just get competent ppl and not an army of...well....you know.  

Good things: 
1.  The mojitos that took forever were great!
2.  The HH prices are good enough to get me back. 
3.  The location is awesome.  


I really hope they get it together."}
