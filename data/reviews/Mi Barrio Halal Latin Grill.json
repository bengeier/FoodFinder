{"text":"I love their food! We drive 20 mins to this location when we are in need of good Dominican food ! Love the portions that they give as well as the vibe . Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Stopped by while getting car serviced up the road. Having lived in LA for years and from NY, always looking for good ethnic food. This place is a winner. Tried the beef and chicken stew- excellent! Esp the beef. Also tried the baked chicken- a little tamer on the flavors but yummy and falling off the bone. Got the mac n cheese for our side- BEST in Charlotte so far. It was delicious! And the portions are generous. We'll definitely be back!."}
{"text":"Great little spot specializing in Dominican and halal cuisine. Really clean, friendly and helpful staff. Most of the entrees and sides seemed to be out on a buffet hot and ready to go, but today I went for the Philly combo w/fries and they prepared it fresh in the back. The food was great, and the combo was only $6. But the cashier only charged me for the sandwich, so mine was actually only $5! The empanadas and sweet plantains were looking pretty tasty, so I'm sure I'll  be back soon."}
{"text":"This is cafeteria style comfort food. Large portions of food with good prices. However, since the food is sitting out on the line the quality takes a hit. My chicken was pretty dry! The sides I had- rice and mac and cheese were not excellent but they were not bad either. I just drowned my entire plate in hot sauce and enjoyed my meal.  I would come back for days when its all about quantity and not necessarily quality."}
{"text":"Great food and wonderful atmosphere. In my few visits I've had the rotisserie chicken, the greens, cabbage, peach cobbler, sweet potato pie, goat stew and of course the rice and peas. All were excellent. The cobbler was ridiculous and the rotisserie chicken was crazy good! It is waaaaay outta the way for me, but always worth the drive. You will definitely need a take home box and the prices are more than reasonable."}
{"text":"The food is really good with huge portion. The lamb shank is so tender and flavorful. The price is reasonable too. I had rice + lamb shank + vegetable + ice tea while my husband had rice + 1/2  whole rossiterie chicken + vegetable + soda and the total is only $24. I think that's pretty good deal."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely delicious! I had goat stew with arroz con gandules (rice and beans). I didn't really like my Mac n cheese as a side but I'm pretty picky about my Mac n cheese. The passion fruit juice was the absolute best. I had 2 cups and wanted more. My husband had curry chicken, arroz con gandules and broccoli. I thought the food prices were reasonable ($10.99 for the goat meal and $7.99 for the curry chicken). The passion fruit juice was a little pricey at $2.25 each but there are free refills and it was worth every penny. The food is served from a buffet so it wasn't piping hot, but not did it taste like it had been sitting there all day. There was a nice variety of food to choose from and we look forward to coming back in the future"}
{"text":"tired of eating out? want some home cookin? well this is the place that makes u feel right at home. there's an amazing selection ready for u to make a platter....rice n beans, chicken, beef, goat, plantains, collards, cornbread, candied yams n the list goes on!!  they call it Dominican but def a fusion of soul food as well in the sides. will def be coming here again n again n again!"}
{"text":"The food was actually amazing.  I am only downgrading to 4 stars because of the wait, although this is often the case with food truck vendors.  Nevertheless I would highly recommend them to anyone in the area for a great, reasonably priced lunch."}
{"text":"Cool spot, not big, the AC was not working apparently as it was a little warm in there, but the food was good. The service was not too bad either, but this is a place you visit for the good food. I had the rotisserie chicken which was very good, and the mixed rice (moro de gandules), and I definitely enjoyed it. They lost abstar because my tamarind juice was bottled and not all natural, and also because my wife asked for salami and got fried ham instead. What was that about? We may be back as the food was good."}
{"text":"Just sharing off a plate and enjoyed the tender tastiness of the turkey wings, yellow rice and maduros. Unfortunately, they were out of rotisserie chicken on this visit, but I will come back to try it and maybe their collard greens. Prices are reasonable and portions are huge. You can easily share/ have leftovers for another meal. The ladies working here are friendly and quick to fix your order. Too bad this place is a ways out from where we live."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, authentic atmosphere, very reasonable prices for the quantity (under $10 for what can essentially feed two people)"}
{"text":"The food at this restaurant is great but sorry to say the service has much to be desired. For an example the server asking you three times what do you want because his attention is somewhere else. Or better yet asking for variations in plating such as substitutions and it can not be done until you decide your not going to purchase. Not mention their snarky attitude towards questions. Chef T is an awesome guy and his food is stellar, but his staff needs training in good attentive friendly service."}
{"text":"Great place, great food at reasonable prices. Staff is great they make you feel like your eating at a friends house. Menu has a lot of options from a snack to lunch for a large group. I love the authentic dominican food. The restaurant always looks very clean."}
{"text":"Poor customer service, way to expensive for such little amount . Employees are rude and cheap !"}
{"text":"A Latin halal restaurant?! My wishes have been answered! We were so excited to try our Mi Barrio. They were on the other side of Charlotte (about 25 min from the airport) but it was definitely worth it. They have a variety of halal Dominican and Caribbean dishes. Everything was so delicious. Prices were great and the young lady that took our order was very nice and helpful. There is lots of seating as well. The only item that isn't halal is the turkey leg. My friend that ate with us is vegan and there were lots of sides/options for her to choose from. If we are visiting Charlotte again we will definitely be eating here."}
{"text":"Disappointment, never had a letdown as unexpected as this place. Their Food Cart in uptown is so good I figured the brick & mortar location has to be phenomenal, man I was wrong.

Walk in at 11:30 1/2 an hour into lunch service and tell the girls I'd like the chicken/lamb combo over rice, they said it wasn't ready and I'd have to wait 10 minutes. I thought, sure no problem, I really wanted the combo and I needed to stop by the Asian Supermarket across the street real quick anyway so left and came back 15 minutes later.

11:45 \"Still not ready, just take a seat and we'll be with you soon.\" At this point I'm still the only one in the restaurant minus the two girls behind the counter. I've already invested 15 minutes, what's a couple more? 

12:00 I'm asking how long because I've got to be in Monroe very soon. They had served 3 other customers ahead of me because they were ordering rotisserie or jerk chicken, they told me to come up and choose my rice. They then gave me my drink and said the meat would be ready in just a second. I also decided on a side of plantains for $1.99 since I had been staring at them for while now. They rang me up and I sat back down. 

12:10 finally walking out the door... I feel like they only had me come up and choose my rice and pay so that I wouldn't leave. I wish I had. But I received the food so finally, time to see if it was worth the wait.

Meat was good, a little dry, not as moist as the cart in Uptown. Lettuce and Tomato were fresh, tomatoes were great. The rice was notably bland, I don't understand how the rice at the cart has a mellow, complex spice and aroma to it and at the restaurant it literally has nothing to offer. The plantains were simply burnt, not blackened with spices, burnt. Trust me, I know plantains.

It was also more expensive than Uptown. It 'appears' that you're getting more food than the cart but it's just more bland rice and less meat. Not a great trade off.

Service was nothing to speak of. No apology for the wait, and no interaction at all the entire time I waited, even though for most of the time I was the only patron at the place. They have zero customer service awareness.

Take my advice, go to the cart at Trade and Tryon. They can handle 5 times the amount of customers in a third of the time with better food. Chris and his team up there are just so much better, if the food wasn't great and his team so friendly, this visit would probably be the end. 2 Stars because apparently the food is the same, but what a bummer today's visit was..."}
{"text":"It's a good place to eat a quick bite, the food taste delicious but the servings  are inconsistent. I went in and ordered off the menu the oxtail stew. The meals comes with 2 sides. The gentleman helping me was nice and put my order together. I paid and sat down to eat. As I was sitting there I noticed other patrons walk up and order the same meal I did. They paid the same amount but their plates had twice the content mines did. This happened multiple times,  which meant I didn't get what I paid for.  If you're giving one patron more food than the others when both are paying the same price, it create inconsistency.  Inconsistencies are never good for a brand because it breeds contempt.  I'll go back, but I'll be watching very closely next time."}
{"text":"We came to this place after reading the reviews here. Definitely not authentic. My husband is Dominican and there was nothing Dominican about this place. The food looked old and stale, the Woman standing behind the counter did not even smile or greet us, just gave us the stare down so we left."}
{"text":"I love love love this place! The staff are sweet. The food is amazing! I haven't had better Dominican food in Charlotte so far. It's never super busy in my experience which is shocking because it's so good with great portion compared to the price."}
{"text":"Service is always great, and the food is always excellent. Definitely try to make it a point to stop here when I am in the area!"}
{"text":"*HALAL*- awesome gem of a  place found  while traveling! Would never have imagined to find a halal Dominican restaurant near downtown Charlotte while road tripping , but so glad we came here . 

You can Create your own combinations of a variety of dishes so the possibilities are your choice . We chose the lamb over white rice - SO GOOD! I personally think this was better than the famous Halal Guys Cart in NYC 10x better , and the sauce was soo tasty . Def recommend .
Also got the Jerk Chicken - soo tender and juicy and great taste ; had that with the vegetable rice and cabbage . 
Got a order or fried chicken to go - perfectly cooked .
They also have a variety of fresh juices . I got a carrot juice - tasted exactly how it's supposed to.

Wish we would have gotten more things to try because they have a ton of meat dishes but were soo full from everything , and definitely going to come back thru! 

The also have free Qurans for you to take  , which just made me love this place even more 

Overall great place , quick and friendly service!"}
{"text":"these are the same people who own the halal carts around the city but the portions here are way better. The staff are friendly, the food is super affordable and the portions are more than fair for the price. The only reason I would prefer the cart over the restaurant would be the rice the cart uses which is long-grained vs the short-grain the restaurant serves. Either way I definitely plan on going back to check out the dominican food."}
{"text":"I am dominican, i know real authentic dominican food. Especially beans !! && when i say im a picky eater im a picky eater ! This place out beat every dominican food joint in the entire state of North Carolina. The beans so good i can literally drink them !!!! if you like beans you know what i mean !! you must try"}
{"text":"Very good food, I'm from Miami and been looking for a place with some good down home Dominican food, I found this gem and it is my go to spot for the mango! So happy I went it, fresh, authentic you can't complain."}
{"text":"Good food ordered the jerk chicken it was nice and spicy. I've also ordered the chicken and rice that's good also just stay away from their fried chicken it looks nothing like the picture advertised. When we complained he said you should of went to Popeyes"}
{"text":"Based on one visit this place is good- really good. The place is clean. The staff helpful and the food might darn fine.  Portions are large for the price.  I plan to go back and try some other items and that says a lot.  Recommend you give this place a try"}
{"text":"The food is really delicious and flavorful. I tried the Dominican Burger and it was really tasty. A delightful blend sweet, savory, and spicy. They also have a buffet of Dominican soul food which looks really good. The food is said to be halal but I couldn't verify if it was hand slaughtered zabiha. Also there wasn't really anything special about the fries... So that's why I only gave it 4 stars. Other than that the owner is really nice and sweet. Chef tony is also really accommodating and gracious and he'll customize you're order if there isn't a long wait."}
{"text":"The oxtail was kind of a let down . Cabbage ok. Rice and beans pretty good. Large portions.  Overall a felt kind of ripped off. the portions were good.The taste oxtail had nooo flavor. 13.74 price should have got Mexican"}
{"text":"Small hole in the wall with great food and service.  If you like to eat a lot, this place serves so much food I had to tell them to stop at one point because the plate was over flowing with food.  Super cheap too."}
{"text":"Best macaroni and cheese around! Went a while ago and had the nicest guy helping us have been back several times since then and the food is always great!"}
{"text":"All I can say is AMAZING!!!! We ordered the lamb & chicken gyro & also the Philly cheesesteak & it was sooooo freaking good the best I ever had!!!!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at this place a total of probably 20 times. The food is really good and their off days are rare. Despite being in a sketchy Strip mall, the place is always clean and well-kept. Their employee turnover seems high and your portion size is very employee dependent. Portion sizes have gone down since their opening and the prices charged are not always consistent with what's on the menu. I asked for a side of Bacalao when the menu clearly states a side of meat is $3.99 The employee stated that the owner says it is now $6.99 for an additional meat. My last few visits I noticed a careful rationing out of food and the fact that portion sizes are becoming smaller and smaller. Disappointing..."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I'm always in the look out for hole in the wall ethnic eats and this place does not disappoint. It's located in a somewhat sketchy shopping complex and out of the way for me but worth the drive when I'm craving something authentic. It's clean, staff is friendly, and prices are great. My favorite Dominican spot! I love the ox tail and beef stew! 

P.S. Everthing tastes great but their sweet plantains need work! They are too hard! Sweet plaintains are supposed to melt in your mouth!"}
{"text":"If I could give a lower score I would not even trynna be funny my food and my grandmas food was disgusting I will not spend my money here ever again"}
{"text":"Another small, quiet shop tucked away in a corner that is a must try.  The ordering process is super quick and easy but could do with some signs or something for the food.  The staff could speak a little louder but they are courteous and respectful.

The oxtail was great and the rotisserie chicken was flavorful, albeit a bit too dry.  The yams are a must as well as the fried plantains.  The lentils and rice side is good and the mac and cheese, though soggy, was great.

This isn't the fanciest of places but I think it's a great spot to get some good food really quick for good prices."}
{"text":"This place is totally worth it! Latino food made with Halal meat! Halal meat is already something special here because it is rare any restaurant use it. The difference in good quality is phenomenal! Yummy and tender chicken stew, cabbage cooked perfectly and they stay steady thought out the day! Food is ready made so it also makes the place extremely convenient!"}
{"text":"Everything looks delicious and my husband, being the foodie that he is, ordered majority of the meats to try. Everything is yummy!! 

We pass this shopping area all the time. Originally we wanted to try the spot next door but passing by the windows, we saw the steam table and decided to give it a try. 

The employees are very polite and patience as we were trying to decide what we wanted. Restrooms are pretty clean with a changing station. Something that small restaurant like these do not often have. 

We will definitely stop by again!"}
{"text":"I love the food here. The decor is kinda cheap-looking and it's set up like a cafeteria. But really good, reasonably priced food."}
{"text":"Food is fantastic. Authentic Spanish food. Prices are extremely reasonable and portions are huge."}
{"text":"The first time I came here the portion was BIG, NY style then it started getting smaller & smaller. It's been months that I've come back, today I decided to try again. And I was shock because the new girl there today was friendly and prompt. Some of the other girls there before her was not always friendly. The portion was still smaller than the cart on Tryon, but it was good & service was on point."}
{"text":"Very flavorful Rotisserie Chicken, moist yellow rice, delicious lemonade.  Will definitely try again.  Another customer stated that the mac and cheese was very good, I'll have to try that the next time. No AC on during my dine in visit but the food was worth sitting in the warm temperature!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service. They don't skimp on the portions at all...I got a ton of oxtails,rice and greens for about $11.00.... Meat was tender and flavorful and staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Terrific food, all of my favorites but the atmosphere is take out not bring a date and have fun. There is a small dining area but no heat ( it is winter time). The service is friendly and fast just not a romantic spot."}
{"text":"The Philly cheese steak is good but 9 out of the 10 times I've been there they can't seem to make my sandwich right so no more for me."}
{"text":"The food is good here..... But each time I visited my food was luke warm. I like my food steaming, good thing I live close by I always had to use my microwave after I order. Oh well, I probably won't be returning. Can get the same food at Soanas fresh to order"}
