{"text":"Happened to have Tong Garden because it was close by, and not pizza! The hot and sour soup is okay, thick and heavy on the white pepper, not my favorite. Silver Palace on Rt. 88 has a much better version. 
The steamed dumplings are tasty, but I almost want to bet they are pre fab, not made in house. 
My favorites are anything and everything spicy, although I always request extra spicy, and the Kung Pao chicken, and beef have both been tasty. The version of Ma Par Tofu was good, but heavy with oil. 
Consistency is usually there, but a few occasions, I was told a different cook was in the kitchen, and it tasted like it. Sweet and sour pork ordered for someone was a disappointment.
Tong Garden is okay for something different, reasonable prices, and always friendly service. Not a regular go to, but it'll suffice in a pinch."}
{"text":"Tong Garden on Brookline Blvd is my favorite Chinese food, their chicken and shrimp egg rolls are to die for and the sechuan beef is excellent. The owners are very nice people as well. I've been going there for 5 years and I've never had a bad meal."}
{"text":"I have tried the chicken lo-mein, it ok.  the ginger chicken (I get it extra spicy) is super yummie!!!! the general tso's is a hit or miss.  the hot and sour soup is ok.  the Mongolian beef is super yummy!!!! the fried rice is ok. the veggie egg rolls I don't like. will add more as my family and I try new dishes."}
{"text":"yummy, yummy chinese food.  thank heavens for there being one in brookline.  great food.  friendly, fast service.  decent prices.  funny kid who jumps out and tries to scare me every time i go is great in store entertainment.  very simple decore.

i always walk here when i order since it so close and they always have it ready before i get there.  usually get the general tso's.  must try the other menu items someday."}
{"text":"Got some take out and I really wasn't impressed. Dish smelt like smoke and taste watery and burnt. Better options nearby. Really wanted to like a business on the Blvd but I probably won't be coming back. This is my second time trying it..."}
{"text":"Great food at good prices. Very generous portions. And FAST service. Great service. The owners/Employees are very nice and friendly people. I go there for take out and also to dine in."}
{"text":"This is my sister's, my sister's ex boyfriend's, my friends, my family, and my favorite Chinese restaurant. The food is delicious and the workers there is so wonderful. Nothing comes close to this restaurant. When you walk in you can smell the delightful cooking. When you sit you get treated like royalty, and their service is great. You get to order what you want and while you wait you can read the horoscopes on the back of the menu. It is clean and kid friendly environment. Ton of people are there everyday. When you get your food you and bite into it you can taste love in the food. No matter what you get. You get what you expected and so much more. I can't enough good things about it. I just love the Tong Garden."}
{"text":"good no-frills old-school chinese grub on the doudy eastern end of brookline boulevard.  some nicer lighting / interior design would do them well.  
  i love the mongolian beef and the hot n sour soup is delightful on a frigid cold winter day in pittsburgh ...
$4-5 lunch specials.  can't be beat."}
{"text":"Tong Garden (Tong's Chinese Restaurant) is a wonderful little family run restaurant. It is located on Brookline Blvd. The dining-room is nothing to write home about. Simple tables and chairs in a somewhat tattered setting. Children's magazines and toys can often be seen in the corner as the owner's children often play, watch TV, or do their homework in the restaurant. The food, however, more than makes up for the lack of ambiance. Simply put, Tong Garden has some of the best Chinese food in Pittsburgh. The Mooshu and Kung Pau are excellent, the sweet and sour chicken is made with large strips of succulent chicken breast, and their soups and sauces are wonderful. If you have the chance, try Tong Garden. Highly recommended. Cash only."}
{"text":"Very good and reasonable prices. Nice size portions. Best shrimp I have ever had in a Chinese restaurant"}
{"text":"Doesn't get much worse, folks. I was \"weekending\" in Brookline and stopped in for takeout since my favorite spot around, Silver Palace, was closed for vacation. My General Tso's was soggy, the Crab Rangoon was missing all the crab...and rangoon, and it was just all around pretty nasty. I hate saying that, but it's true!"}
{"text":"I have been eating here for over 13 years and have always had a good meal. They portions are generous, the food is tasty, and the service is quick!"}
{"text":"Chose this place based on the previous review. I live in the Banksville area and have been searching for a decent place for Chinese takeout for years. Particularly, my wife and I have been searching for a restaurant with ample, fresh veggies (with rice and brown sauce or with lo mein) and crisp, tasty tofu. I called Tong's for the first time without referencing a menu and simply described what I was looking for over the phone. They said, \"Yep, we can do that\" and then told me it'd be ready in 20 minutes.

I got there and it's as unpretentious as the reviews say. A regular walked in behind me and asked where the kid was and apparently he was in vacation in China. While waiting for my food (I was early), I perused the menu and noticed that what I had ordered (mixed veggies w/ brown sauce and an order of General Tso's tofu) didn't exist on the menu. I was charged a reasonable amount in spite of this and it turned out pretty good. Not my favorite tofu to date (Mandarin Gourmet downtown wins that) but definitely satisfied my craving. Vegetables were also very, very good. They included zucchini, carrots, broccoli, onions and other good stuff without the typical \"filler\" veggies that you find at cheaper places. With that being said, this place was a buck or two cheaper than everywhere else I've tried in a 10 mile radius. 

Bottom-line: Best Chinese restaurant this side of the tunnels. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We've been getting take-out from this place for years, and I have yet to eat better Chinese food in this city. My favorites would be the appetizers, especially the Fried Dumplings, The Egg Roll, and the Crab Rangoon. The General Tso's Chicken though is tender, sweet, and rich, and the Beef Fried rice is steamy, and light, yet sticks to the ribs, the little meat bits being packed with flavor. I also crave the Sweet and Sour Chicken, and I cheat!  I just dip it in that red candy syrup. Rules are made to be broken.

Be mindful of the little ones when you stop by to pick up your food too. One of them is always doing their homework or showing you their toys."}
{"text":"I saw some good reviews on here for The Tong Garden, and I've lived in Brookline my whole life, just haven't ever tried this place.  So I ordered the General Tso's lunch special and tried it out.  Came to $5.95 and was a good portion of meat and rice, I ALMOST couldn't finish!  But I did.  

One note if you order the General Tso's, wait at least 5 minutes before you eat it.  Be especially careful when dipping the chicken in the sauce, which is about the temperature of lava!  Even about 15 minutes after I got it, it was pretty damn hot, so be careful!  

Other than that, my lunch was delicious.  I'm going to have to try some more things here.  I usually order my General Tso's from China Village on Library Road next to the Castle Shannon Storage, and I'll probably continue to do so.  I think it's $4.80, you get about the same amount of chicken, more rice, but it's more flavorful.  The lady there is really nice too and is impressed every time when I ask for chopsticks.  But I will be back to Tong Garden to sample some more dishes."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place when I haven't gone shopping yet. The food is very good and portions large. I love the steamed tofu with vegetables and brown sauce (which is a variation of the Ma Pa Tofu (or something like that - they don't mind special orders). They are also pretty fast. The ambiance leaves something to be desired but for the price and food quality (esp. for take out), it's great to have them in our neighborhood."}
{"text":"I loved the food here. The egg rolls were the best I've had around the area. It wasn't filled with cabbage like other places. The portions were huge. Everyone in my party had left overs for the next day. The only thing was an issue with parking."}
{"text":"Not a fan. First time I had sweet and sour chicken and it was completely overdone. I'm talking crispy and the chicken had dried out and shriveled away from the breading. The second meal I had was general tso's and it was soggy. I actually didn't finish that. 

Gave it 2 stars because the woman at the register is nice, the mixed egg roll is good and my dog enjoys the white rice"}
