{"text":"I don't usually write reviews but this place has won me over. Excellent quality food. Free range chicken. The salad that comes with the combo is delish! I love this place! The owner is very friendly."}
{"text":"Delicious and authentic.  Large portions, veg and gluten free friendly.  Friendly staff.  Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!!! Very diverse menu and fresh food! The atmosphere is very nice and lively. The place is clean and the owner is very friendly..... This is a Restaurant I will DEFINITELY be eating at again!!! I highly recommend people to come and eat here!"}
{"text":"the restaurant is currently closed, they are remodeling and changing their name to \"AZ Kebob\"

consistently great food, service is sometimes slow though, but the wait is always worth it. the staff is exceptionally friendly and always remembers me when I come in. 

i recommend skipping the fries if you get a lunch special and get the rice instead. goes much better with the kebob.

*EDIT* I incorrectly assumed this was action of the existing management. This was incorrect. Its under new ownership and the menu is totally different. Sadly the quality has greatly declined and the prices have gone up. Won't change my star rating for  Skewers but I'll certainly be giving a lesser review of the new establishment."}
{"text":"The doner kebab salad is excellent. Staff friendly, very clean dining area. Didn't give five stars because it took a bit long to get our food. But you should definitely check this place out--the food is worth trying. I went once and then iRan back heheh"}
{"text":"Great proteins and really nice customer service. Not to mention the flavor of my Shish Kebab wrap is off the chain. My wife's Doner Kebab and my sons chicken tenders were cooked to perfection. Great eat and will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I love this places , I just found out that the owners father just past away in LA , and they will be closed for the next few days , I can't wait till the owner comes back so I can give him our condolences ...."}
{"text":"Seriously good Persian food in North Scottsdale. Make sure to get a side order of sweet potato fries. I always get the chicken kebab plate with rice and salad. They give you a good size salad with lots of fresh veggies and homemade dressing."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I live in the West and East Valley.  We meet half way at Scottsdale Road and Mayo Blvd. for lunch.  Two of the restaurants that we previously visited closed down and we had to find a new restaurant for our luncheon.
Based on the Yelp reviews we decided to give Skewers Persian Grill a chance. We were not disappointed.  The moment we walked in we were greeted warmly. The guys were very helpful and very entertaining giving us old girls a giggle or two.  Oh, and the food was delicious.  We all had the Doner platter served with a lovely salad,  The portion was very big and all three of us took half home for our husbands.  No cooking tonight!   Very clean no frills restaurant. This will definitely be our meeting place from now on.  Thanks guys, \"you made my day\"! We will be back!"}
{"text":"What a great lunch place - food is awesome and employees are delightful.  We shared an entrée of Chicken Kabob which came with a bowl of lentil soup.  Both were tasty and delicious.  We will be back."}
{"text":"The food I had was really good! I had a wrap, she had a salad. We shared hummus.

IF you don't mind paying a little more than usual for this kind of food, the food is really good. ($30 for two at lunch time) The Gyro meat was full of flavor! The hummus wasn't bland like other places and the pita was fresh. She said the salad was really good too and didn't taste like Dirt as the other comment said.

They lost a star because I went there last Saturday (7-6-13) afternoon for the second time and even though the sign said they were open 8am-10pm that day, they were closed. I hope it wasn't for good!"}
{"text":"Skewers has your typical Mediterranean style food, nothing over the top extravagant. I like their falafel pita and hummus platter. I would like to see them have less expensive menu options that maybe included a side. Customer service was good, no complaints."}
{"text":"Excellent casual Mediterranean restaurant.  Food is very reasonably priced if you are looking for Mediterranean.  The entrees come with rice, pita bread, a salad or soup.  I have tried both chicken and filet mignon and they were nicely done and not dry.  The rice was very tasty and the salad was appetizing.  You can eat in or take out and the portions are huge.  My boyfriend picked up the food both times so I cannot comment on the location and the cleanliness of the place.  My boyfriend also said that the chef/owner is a very nice guy.  I can tell you that I would definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"Really nice for such a casual place.  Nice folks too.  Food was quite good.  Not Good Fellas fantastic but then again it isn't 20 miles away either."}
{"text":"Just had a great lunch at Skewers, and I'm happy I finally made it down. For around $11 I walked out of there feeling full and satisfied. During this trip I got to try their falafels, lentil soup, doner, and shish kebab, and I've added some pictures for you to see the deliciousness.

The falafels were a bit dense, much like a cake donut, but were definitely tasty. The tahini and salsa concoction served with them soaked right in, and after munching on a couple of those, I got my lentil soup. It was light and refreshing, and also packed with good homemade flavors. Finally, after finishing that, I got to eat the doner, served with dill rice, and try some shish kebab. If you like juicy gyro meat, the doner here won't let you down. I wish they would have served the plate with a little extra tzatziki, but oh well, I can ask next time.

I really enjoy getting kebabs or tenderloin from different Middle Eastern joints because they are all flavored differently. There's always some little twist to the spices that make each unique. Skewers flavors theirs with a mixture of sweet and savory. I want to say that they use a little sumac to flavor it. They also serve it with a lemon wedge to squeeze on the kebab to taste. It was delicious and tender.

Alright, time to wrap this up. Skewers is going to be a welcomed addition to my lunch rotation. I'm a sucker for good Middle Eastern food, especially on the cheap, and I had nothing but a good experience here. The owner was warm and genuine, and he really cares about his food. I love seeing that pride, and I'm looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Skewers so I'm not sure if the service and quality is normally this way, but we were very disappointed after a lot of great reviews. 
We came for lunch and there were about 5 other tables with customers seated already. None of them seemed to have food. We ordered the sampler appetizer and I got a Greek chicken salad and my fiancé got a wrap. It took the 3 gentleman behind the counter almost 45 minutes to bring us our order. Other guests were already complaining on the wait and they seemed to be out of various things like French fries and eggplant dip which they had already  had customers pay for. When we finally got our food with the substitutions they had to make it looked really good. I went to take a bit of my salad and found a long black hair in it. We just left the food and headed to another place for lunch. I guess I should have noticed that all 3 men had long hair and no one was wearing a hair net. We will never be going back to Skewers again."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  It's very high quality meat and prepared perfectly.  I like the Persian room,  but this place is much better for a quick lunch without the wait or tipping requirement.  They now have lunch specials that are a great deal also.  Get here!"}
{"text":"Just average.  $14 for a chicken skewer plate and iced tea.  Nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"This place stinks!  If you have ever had real Persian, this is not it. It is Mediterranean fast food with high prices and slow service for what it is. Definitely a disappointment."}
{"text":"New spot that takes the Western palate a little further into the realm of Persian cuisines.  Dishes that won't weigh you down, served by an attentive staff, with attractive lunch options."}
{"text":"A few weeks back Hubby and I were taking care of something nearby and he went to Skewers Persian Grill to get us food to go.
He got us a gyro wrap, a kebab koobideh (minced meat) wrap and dolmeh.
I have a recent new appreciation for dolmeh and they were very good, gyro wrap was great as well. Lots of yogurt dressing.
But, the koobideh, oh my, that koobideh was the best I ever had. It was delicious."}
{"text":"Went here after a movie once, excited to try something other than Pita Pit or Paradise Bakery for fast-ish food in the Scottsdale 101 area. I absolutely LOVE falafel, so I ordered the falafel wrap. I can be kind of picky with my falafel, but I was not a huge fan of the falafel here. It wasn't terrible, but I just did not like it much compared to other falafel I've had. The salad was good otherwise though.

If I'm in the area I'd probably give this place another shot as it was clean and the service was good. I would be ordering something else though!"}
{"text":"Very clean family owned business. Food is top, coming from someone who's knowledgable on Persian cuisine. Fav. Place to eat at whenever hungry: Sprinkle that sumac on yar meat!!"}
{"text":"Though I am a bigger epicurean  fan of the Turkish flatbread for my doner kebabs I LOVED the kebabs at Skewers.  The taste is very authentic and the service is super friendly.  They show their true pride and enjoyment in feeding others the tasty dishes.  I had the wrap and my husband had the dinner.  The dinner was very large in portion, as was the wrap, and well worth the price.  This is a new favorite place of ours!"}
{"text":"SO good! We were going to go to The Persian Room but there was a 20 minute wait. We really felt like Mediterranean food and I remembered that this place was close to opening. We took a chance and luckily they were open! Very similar menu to Persian Room, but not as robust of course, with some smaller options like wraps. Very fairly priced, considering the quality of the food was close to Persian Room, but half the price! We will be coming back."}
{"text":"Ahh, a great find with this mom & pop restaurant inside a strip mall!

I got the doner kebab plate to go, and really liked the dill rice that came with the entree. 
I practically lived off doner kebabs while studying abroad in Europe, so it's hard to live up to those expectations. 
The lentil soup was a little too salty, but went great with the rice as long as you're not eating it by itself. 

I say skip the regular fast food fare if you're here for a movie, and try out something different (probably preaching to the choir though, fellow yelpers).

For $11, the portion was great as well, since it served as both dinner and lunch the next day. 

Save your receipt for 10% off on your next order!"}
{"text":"I had the combo appetizer and it was the BEST.  Loved everything on it, falafel was crunchy and delish, eggplant dip was totally homemade tasting, dolmeh yummy, hummus was also really good.  I also tried my daughter's lentil soup and it was great as well.  Price was reasonable and my portion was large, had to share it.  Would definitely come back the next time I'm visiting Arizona.  If you want to eat super healthy this is the place!!!"}
{"text":"I am not a huge persian food fan, but the food here was delicious.  I went with a friend and we both loved it.  I had a salmon wrap and the salmon was tender and juicy.  It is so easy to overcook salmon and this was cooked to perfection.  The young man at the front counter was exceptionally friendly and helpful.  He also came around to the tables while we were eating to check with everyone on how things were.  The chef/owner also was very friendly and nice.  Prices were not cheap, but were reasonable for the amount of food we received.  Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"This place has definitely gotten on the ball with regards to being open when they say they will - we finally returned and the food was great! The only issue is that they messed up our order twice - we were the only people in there, and there were 2 cooks and a cashier, so not an issue of being slammed. That being said, they corrected both problems immediately. I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and great service. The owner is very proud about his food which you can tell by the delivery. I hesitate getting chicken skewers because they tend to be dry, but these were nice an juicy. Everything is made to order and fresh. Also loved the appetizer platter and the dill rice"}
{"text":"One of the best dona kebabs in town. I had the dona fries, they were loaded with meat, feta cheese and sauce. I don't think they are on the menu but the staff was overly friendly. They listened to my odd craving and built me just that. I'd definitely go back. They give a ton of food, I was starving and probably only finished about half of my portion."}
{"text":"Great Gyro Salad. The gyro meat is really tasty. Friendly staff. Food is done with love so it make take a little bit to get but it's well worth it. Try it. You'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Great food.  Had the Shish Kebab Wrap it's beef tenderloin with seasonings and it's was just great. Took a little while to cook. But it was worth it. Prices are not cheap about 11 dollars for the tenderloin wrap and a drink but it was great tasting."}
{"text":"Ehhh at best. The chicken was good but the beef not so much. The salad tasted like dirt unfortunately And the rice was not good either. I recommend getting some condiments to help the overpriced under portion plates go down smoother.  Very Nice people and friendly service.  Not sure if ill be back."}
{"text":"Very nice place to eat. I was in the area, so I decided to stop by. I was definitely impressed with the quality of the food. Price is what it is for this kind of food. You get what you pay for, high quality Persian food. I got the sultan plate with beef kubideh and tenderloin kabob. Both were outstanding. Will out it on my favorite list when I'm in the area! Keep it up..."}
{"text":"Came in to check the place out. Owner was chatting it up with a customer who he seemed to know or was familiar with. She was making all kinds of adjustments to her order that was taking forever. He was friendly about it but would have been nice to move her along some. 
On to the food...ordered the chicken kebab plate to go.  Came with chicken, lentil soup (or you can choose salad), dill rice, pita, half of grilled tomatoe and 2 sauces-tahini and a red sauce. Not usually a fan of chicken breast but this one was pretty good. Not too dry. I liked the red sauce. Never had it before with Persian food but it was flavorful. Dill rice was nice touch over regular white rice. Lentil soup was pretty yummy too. 
Overall ill be back. Except for the owner chatting it up a little too long with another customer, I'd say good experience so far. He's a friendly guy so can't fault him for that. Seems excited to open his place up. 
He says he makes his own falafel so lets see how that one tests out next."}
{"text":"I was so looking forward to try this place and my son and I were so hungry and I took him out of his car seat and tried to open the door at 11:55 am and the doors were locked. There was no sign to let customers know. Very disappointed.finally got to try it on a different day and nothing to rave about sadly to say. Sandwich was messy and taste was just ok. Make sure one of the employees takes his glove off before grabbing something from the floor and going back to preparing the food for customers. I can't stand bad hygiene."}
{"text":"OMG.  Shocked to see the good reviews on this place.  Worst tahini sauce I ever had.  Completely watered down with no flavor left and terrible consistency.  Dried out falafel balls, barely edible.  American cook/server has no clue what Persian or Mediterranean food is.  Poorly trained and had no knowledge of ethnic dishes, it was laughable.  Can't even remember all the other items we ate, because frankly, we could not even eat them.  It's just all wrong."}
{"text":"This is our second visit to this gem. The food is outstanding. The ingredients are fresh and the seasoning spot on. The fesenjan is particularly good. The service is pleasant as is the ambiance. There is good soft music. The portions are large. This place deserves your attention, and don't be frightened by the unknown. The seasoning is very acceptable."}
{"text":"Awesome food, authentically Persian, awesome service. Everything is extremely fresh. The owner came out after we gave compliments and gave us Turkish coffee and the best baklava I've ever had."}
{"text":"Have been here twice now. This is a small place, but very nice. The people are very friendly. They really want you to have a good experience and enjoy the food. The first time we got the food to go because we were heading to the movies and didn't have enough time to eat in. We snuck the food into the theatre. Once the light went down we took the food out. Because the theatre was dark we really couldn't see the food. So we had to completely judge it by taste. We both took a bite and looked at each other saying with our expressions YUMMO!!! The second time we made sure we had time to sit and eat before the movie. Once again everything was great, everyone was friendly, and you get plenty of food. We'll be back."}
