{"text":"New kitchen manager is making some great food these days! AWESOME fish fry on Friday night. Soup is outstanding and service is friendly and fast, and fun! There's also a new appetizer on the menu that is quite tasty  - spring rolls with a raspberry sauce and a cucumber/garlic pepper sauce - just outstanding! Service is friendly, too!"}
{"text":"Wow!  This place is awful.  Rubber greasy curds. Dirty greasy chicken fingers and very small portions.  Take out order is never correct. Do yourself and your colon a favor and pass"}
{"text":"When I go to the Club Tavern, it's a little bit like going home. No, really, I used to live upstairs. I wouldn't call it fine dining, but the food is good. I'm a big fan of the Moose Burger, though I change it up a little bit. It comes with 3 slices of cheese, ham, mushrooms, and bbq sauce, but I have them ditch the mushrooms (i'm allergic) and add bacon and a fried egg, because i LIKE my burgers to give me heart palpitations. Monday night taco nights are pretty awesome, The tacos aren't anything fancy, but they're cheap, and help to offset the copious amounts of tap beer I tend to imbibe. (note: if you drink it straight from the pitcher, it still counts as ONE beer) Club Tavern also offers a pretty good breakfast, and they have specials for the early birds. Best bloody mary in town, (except mine of course, but I live 1000 miles away now...) Happy  hour at the Club was always my favorite. 75 cent pints of Miller High Life. Not the world's greatest beer, but definitely affordable during happy hour. I always like to visit the Club when I get back to town."}
{"text":"Took my friend out for her birthday. Things were going okay, but at the end of the night, I GOT DOUBLE CHARGED!  3 TIMES we went back and tried to resolve the issue... they said their computers were down 2x, the last time Moose himself came out  and checked my receipt and said \"we'll have to see about that, come back at a later date.\"
Situation not resolved, never got double charged reversed to what it should have been!!! Horrible!!!
 Also there was a psycho bitch next to us who was extremely drunk even started playing with my hair without my permission, we complained but they let her stay , yet they cut off my friend who was neither as obnoxious nor drunk as aforementioned woman.
I'll NEVER GO THERE AGAIN!!!"}
{"text":"I used to love stopping by this place on Taco Mondays. I think you used to get 5 for a dollar at one point and you could get a pitcher of spotted cow for like $9 so you just couldnt beat it. Slowly they started upping the prices etc.. I think they must have gotten a new fish because for the last couple years its had a metallic taste... It's one of those things where they seem to have chose quantity over quality.."}
{"text":"Club Tavern catered a company picnic for us, and they were amazing!  We chose to go with the grilled picnic, so they grilled right on site for us, at a local park.  They were there nice and early, so the food was ready right when we had requested.  All the food was delicious, at the perfect temperature, and there was plenty of food.  We did not have to worry about running out at any point!  The guys did a great job, and were incredibly nice.  Moose even made sure to tell me that next time we could do more \"kid friendly\" food, such as mini corn dogs, as we did have a number of kids there (it was a family picnic for our employees).

I would definitely recommend Club Tavern for your catering needs.  They have the big catering truck that they will set up on site, and make sure everything is perfect.  Will definitely use them again!"}
{"text":"Under no circumstances play league volleyball here unless your cool with: 1) no rules, 2) really rocky sand that you'll cut yourself on, 3) games starting late, even the first game, 4) canceling volleyball with 30 min notice and perfectly fine weather. The bartenders are nice, but it takes the stars to align perfectly to actually get one of them to take your order, even when the bar is dead. Something new has happened each week we've been there for volleyball that has us scratching our heads. I guess they keep it interesting! Go for the free beer on the first 70 degree day of the year, but maybe not the other 364 days."}
{"text":"Horrendously managed. Terrible service. Very rude and the managers seem to treat their employees with no respect. The drinks a watery and the tap selection is average. Food is ok but not worth a trip over to this joint. I don't recommend."}
{"text":"745 on a Friday night with two of my buddies.   We all got the fish fry plus some deep fried shrimp.   Service was attentive, but everything seemed to go wrong.  Out of sirloin and a certain beer.   Forgot to give us the soup until after the entree arrived.  Fish was average for the price, I couldn't imagine it was made to order.  Cole saw sucked,  it was soggy lettuce smothered in warm mayonnaise."}
{"text":"The Club Tavern is an interesting bar. It has a wide range of crowd members from the youthful to the middle aged.  I've been to this bar on numerous occasions for volleyball, and hanging out. and for most times its been a pleasant experience. The drinks are fairly priced, there is a lot of space so you don't feel crowded and usually the music is fair. 

Some points of concern though arrive with smoking. When will they make it a state wide band to smoke in bars and restaurants.  The bartenders also seem a little snobby on occasion. 

I wouldn't say this is the bar to go if your looking to have a great night but if you want a fun/interesting night with some interesting characters make sure you visit."}
{"text":"Not my favorite live music venue in town.  They pull in good local acts weekly, and the drinks are tasty and inexpensive enough, but it's a bit too loud to enjoy the performances without blowing out an eardrum.  Do stop-in to see Moose, though - he's cool."}
{"text":"I am really torn here.  I really thought I liked this place. The food is very good and the atmosphere is welcoming.  I was here again on 9/20; when I returned from the bar to pay my check, my beer was already cleared from the table. It felt like I was being pushed out the door.  I will have to think about  whether or not they want me to return."}
{"text":"If I want a burger, I go to Club Tavern. I have now been there probably 8 times, and have come away extremely happy every time.

The burgers are big, juicy, and bursting with flavor. I have tried a number of different kinds, and each one was good in its unique way.

Each time we go, my wife gets at least 1 bloody mary, which is a meal in and of itself. She claims they are the best bloodys she has had in the Madison area. In fact, the menu comes with a page full of bloody mary styles. Always a good sign!

I have never been in the bar area, so I cannot comment on that. But the food in the restaurant is absolutely wonderful."}
{"text":"Probably would have rated a 5 but our waitress could have been a little more attentive (another waitress stepped in and was great). Our fries were a little cold but the scoop of loaded potato salad was awesome!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for late-night fun, this is a good place.  Great live music and dancing, reasonably priced drinks, and several TV's to keep up on your sports.  Didn't eat here, so I can't speak to anything else"}
{"text":"The Club Tavern was recommended to us by a friend, so off we went.  First off, it is Seat Yourself, and this night there was no wait.  The tables and booths are well spaced and accommodate many different group sizes.  Tonight we had 5 in our party.  The beer choices are very good with many options on tap. For Friday Night Fish, there were many choices from small eaters to big, baked to deep fried.  I ordered the standard meal - deep fried cod with pub chips.   The meal came with soup and a build your own salad.  The clam chowder soup was really good with loads of clam meat and veggies.  The salad bar had a wide mix of greens, vegetables and sides.  At the end of the salad bar was a small plate of brownies - you have to look close to find them but the searching is well worth the time - eat dessert first!  When the fish arrived, I enjoyed two nice pieces of fried cod.  The wait staff is very pleasant and helpful - not too pushy or shy - just right.  We left the tavern very full and happy. If you are looking for a nice place for a Friday night dinner with the family, you won't be disappointed here."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast on Sunday. Slooow service. Worst breakfast I have had in Madison/Middleton. My partner had the Prime Rib, which was fatty & greasy. I had eggs & bacon. Eggs were dry, potatoes hard, bacon very overcooked and toast dry & tough. How hard is it to screw up breakfast? Have had mostly mixed experiences there. Not again."}
{"text":"Stopped here for the 1st (& last) time around 1:30 Friday afternoon. Place was very dreary and quite filthy, which was kind of expected upon entering the dining area after passing by an open door to a supply area which was in complete disarray. Sign told us to seat ourselves. There were 2 other couples in the room, all (I assume) waiting for food, plus there was an employee working w/some ice (maybe for a later-in-the-day salad bar??). We waited for maybe 7-8 minutes w/no acknowledgement of our presence, and as my wife kept looking around at the dirtiness of the place, she could no longer take the thought of eating anything prepared in a place like this and we left."}
{"text":"I have been there a few times to see bands. Every single time, I place the same drink orders. Every single time, it is with a different bartender. Every single time, it is a different price. Through out the night, 6 beers(not all mine), even some specialty beers, should not cost over $50 with tip. The bartenders are always going to the furthest away register to ring up. I find that rather fishy. I have not been back in some time. I do not plan to either. Also, went for a Halloween costume contest at midnight a few years ago. Arrived at 11:45. Contest held at 11:30. Was not happy, were told we would have won hands down. Just not well run, if you ask me."}
{"text":"Stopped in with Michael F & Brianna L on a Friday before a Badger home game at around 10pm and had a pretty good time.

Of course this isnt going to be like a bar on campus and I was honestly pretty glad.  That scene is ok sometimes but others, a guy just wants to play some darts or hear Flo-rida's \"Low\" 3-4 times in 2 hours.

On this night, Z104 was DJ-ing if you could say that.  I think they had a 1.5 hour loop playing and that was about it.  Drinks were fair, ~$3 for Beam mixers and bottles of domestics.  Bartenders were mediocre, not very friendly I'd say.  Place was damn big though and it wasnt too packed.  There is still smoking in Middleton remember.

Crowd was quite interesting and I'd say the place's selling point.  Wide variety from a large middle-aged chick with her ass hanging out of some short sweatpant material shorts to a crowd of good looking co-eds looking to just chill around a table.  

Nothing really crazy going on, but we were kind of on avoid mode this night.  Walked to Bristled Boar in around 10 minutes at around midnight.  I will defintely be back."}
{"text":"A friend proposed Club Tavern for fish fry.  None of us had ever been there.
While the food overall wasnt the WORST I've had, I wouldnt recommend eating there unless someone buys your meal for you, or youve been stranded on a desert island for 5 years and this is the first \"real\" meal you've had in ages.  To some, it may make you want to go back to the island...atleast food is fresh.

We arrived 10 mins after the 4 other people of our party, after 20 more minutes the waiter came back to see what we wanted to drink.  Forgot to note, for a Friday night at 7:30 the place was pretty much empty in the dining area.

I ordered a diet pepsi and the others ordered random alcoholic drinks.  My soda was flat, watery and had some kind of scum on top of it.  I thought I may be crazy, so everyone at the table tried the soda and agreed it was disgusting.  Waiter came back and I asked for a diet dew instead.  Received a diet dew that tasted a little less flat.....but now the glass had a leak in it while went everywhere.  Asked for a glass from the bar w diet pepsi.  It seemed a little less flat, but not by much.  Atleast that glass was clean.
Friend ordered the hog heaven, bloody mary with bacon infused vodka.  He said it wasnt the worst drink, but mainly tasted like greasy bacon fat, not a smokey bacon flavor.  Didnt try it myself.

After the soda ordeal, it had been 20 mins since we arrived I ordered some Moo-skis as an appetizer, which are listed as hashbrowns covered in bacon, onion, and cheese from what i remember.
20 mins after that waiter came back to take our order.  I gave him my order of all you can eat fish and asked about the appetizer.  He said \"oh ya, forgot about those, theyll be right up.\"
5 or 6 minutes later, he came back to check our drink status, and said \"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaand.....you had moo-skis.....theyll be here soon.\"
5 or 6 mins later again he brought out the moo-skis.

They were hashbrowns on a small side plate with a small layer of shredded mozza on top.  Very plain and greasy tasting.  Realized there should be bacon and onion...which i found tiiiiny few far between pieces inside hash later.  For the 3 or 4 dollars, would have been better used for just plain hashbrowns at a diner for a dollar.

Finally get the all you can eat fish which had 2 pieces of pollock, beer battered fries, tartar, and coleslaw:
Fish: ok sized. breading was hard(which i like), taste ok. Not worst Ive had, but no where near good.
Fries: Were best part of the meal.
Tartar: Different, paprika or something in it for a red color.  didnt taste any dill.
Coleslaw:  Im not sure you could even call this slaw.  It was literally a small cup of mayo, with maybe 2 tiny forks of cabbage.  Im not exaggerating that it was a little liquidy...it was literally SOUP.

Ordered a 2nd piece of fish which I got 5 mins later w more tartar.

We were still eating and I ordered a 3rd piece of fish.
He came back with our checks after 10 mins.  We laughed that the forgetting of the fish was on par w our night.  2 friends paid seperate and we had 2 parties of 2.  Super simple orders, but he ended up bringing the bills up wrong 3 times so we had to continue to correct.  Had to take our payments one at a time which added another 10 mins.

Finishing up our bills........and kitchen staff brings me the last piece of fish about 30 mins after ordering it and when we were getting up.

Maybe it was a one time bad experience, but considering how dead it was on a friday night....Im guessing our experience is pretty representative of the food/wait staff which is a shame since the place really has a nice flair or feel inside it.

The best part of the experience was the upbeat classic 80s music.

We  all received buy one get one coupons upon leaving.  Not sure if it was just us or everyone gets them.

30 mins after getting home, I spent lots of time in the bathroom as it all came rushing out the bottom pipes.  I have an iron stomach and don't get messed up by much.

girlfriend edit:  Reminded me she didnt get the salad she ordered and had to ask.  Also noted her old fashioned came w cherries and olives in it, which is taboo? Supposed to be one or other?  Im a crazy WI who doesnt order many OF's, so not sure about this."}
{"text":"Impromptu stop on our way home from Wisconsin Dells and what a surprise! This place used to be a speakeasy and it still has that charm. The staff is extremely welcoming and accommodating and the food was delicious! Definitely try their moose balls and the barbecue ribs fell right off the bone. It's the kind of place that you will remember."}
{"text":"Good place for lunch if you are looking for a burger.  Not a flat little prepackaged slab of meat, but a burger pressed by hand, seared, cooked and juicy.  Not fancy.  Truely dark, but it's a tavern."}
{"text":"A group of us went there for the Friday fish fry. The food was great! I also had a Bloody Mary, it was really good. It's nice that the bar is separate from the dining area. My only complaint is that it was very dark at the salad bar. It was hard to see what I was grabbing. Our waiter was great. Very friendly and funny. We will be back."}
{"text":"I'm sorry to do this, Club Tavern, but you've left me no choice. 

For nearly FIVE YEARS I've been going to the place almost every single week with my friends. This was our home away from home. This was our Cheers. This was literally the place we could go where everybody knew your name. I can say there was a time in my life where I could come here on a Tuesday night and play Mario Kart 64 on their massive projector, drink all night and get a plate of wings and leave only 10 bucks lighter and with a smile on my face. I could almost guarantee I'd meet someone new each week - a friendly tavern-goer just looking for some chit-chat over a few beers, or a wise, aged traveler just looking to tell an interesting story from their lives; the way a bar should be. I looked forward to coming here every single week.

That chapter has been closed - probably forever.

How quickly this place has gone to shit. How quickly Moose has chased away all the good bartenders that made the place what it was. How quickly the quality of food has once again fallen apart, the entertainment has become lackluster, the floors have become inexplicably stickier.

I have not been back here in months now. I sometimes long to go back, but I quickly remember that the good times are over. It is a sad shell of what it once was, and it serves to only remind me of a past that will never be relived. Now it's just another dive bar.

It's been real, CT."}
{"text":"I can't believe that The Club came up as a \"Speakeasy\".  No.  The Club is a Bar and Grill - but mostly a bar.  There is nothing unique or even interesting except maybe it has the worst music stage I have ever seen. It is like the band is playing in the loft of a barn.  Sound quality is terrible. Moose (the owner) used to book some decent bands now and then, but no more. The food is standard bar burgers.  The taps are dirty and the place stinks.  But nice place to drop in if that's what you are looking for."}
{"text":"Nice local place. The history of this Tavern is very interesting if you are into history. The price is not bad people that work there are great. The fam damily like to go here"}
{"text":"Six of us went here for Friday night fish. It was just okay. The salad bar is not beautiful as was described by another reviewer. It was nice and had what you needed to make a decent salad, but not what I would describe as beautiful.  The service was great.   The fish was edible, but there is way better fish fry out there.  One in our group had the jambalaya and said it was delicious.  It looked good and there was a ton of it.  This place is old and it shows.  It could stand a few updates.  

It is a terrible place to see live music.  It is great for the band as there is a perfect place for them to play.  The listeners, not so much.  If you are not facing the stage, the sound is terrible.  There is limited table space in the bar in general.  So getting a spot facing the stage is challenging.  You can do it, but then you may be standing in front of people and usually they don't like that.  It's a good thing there is not a cover charge."}
{"text":"Do not get involved in their Brewer giveaway nights! No bartender is aware of promotion or rules which are clearly printed on posters.!  Wearing Brewer gear a requirement to win tickets and jersey. Three people in the place with gear on,not one of those won!? Hmmmm.........When asked,reply was Ben won[10 seconds after game concluded..]..Of course\"Ben\" could not be found! . A fraud! Doubt anything awarded!"}
{"text":"We stopped here for lunch on a Saturday afternoon. Haven't been here for a long time and couldn't remember why. I had a fantastic Wisconsin po boy, which was a cod sandwich and my wife a cob salad. Both were very good but it took a long time to get the food on a very un-busy day. The place is a real dump though. The floor with the broken tiles and the dust and debris gave us a bad feeling about how the food would be and we were prepared to leave. Well the food was fine but eating here is not a good experience. There was no table service this day, maybe there never is, so I ordered at the bar and had to sort of chase a bartender down to order and pay. Again, not so good. I know that they still have good live music here in the evenings and in the dark this bad look of the Club might not seem so bad. I have to wonder why someone doesn't clean the place up if you're going to serve food or really just to be clean. We like rustic tavern restaurants but this goes beyond that. Not on our go back to list."}
{"text":"I totally love this place. Have been going for years. It's a Middleton staple! Great food menu and a nice dining area separate from the bar. As for the bar, I love the live music, trivia, and divey atmosphere. Moose, the owner, is super friendly."}
{"text":"I've played here as a musician, I've attended shows here, and I've eaten at the restaurant.  The Club Tavern does all of these things fairly well.

They have a wide variety of local and national acts, often with no cover, usually starting at around 9pm (some bar bands start later).  A lot of the music is excellent.  However CT's sound system is not very good.

I've had a burger here-- it was ok, a steak sandwich-- far better than I expected-- and prime rib-- WAY better than I expected.  Prime Rib came with salad bar and was quite affordable.  Salad bar was as good as any salad bar.

I'm not much of a drinker, my wife has a had a few things, I believe she had a long island when they were on special and found it very watered down.

If you're looking for a combination restaurant/live music/dive bar, you wont find any place around here that does all three and does all three decent to well.  That's the great thing about CT."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a burger and wings.  The Bartenders were efficient and nice.

The burger was ok.  The wings were overcooked and hard.

Will go back."}
{"text":"Club Tavern was a decent place to play trivia with a decent beer selection, but the service left something to be desired. We ordered cheese curds and it took the kitchen 45 minutes to bring them out without an explanation of the delay. Decor was your standard Wisconsin bar, and restrooms were moderately clean. The free Trivia was fun, but beyond that we didn't see too much of a reason to come back."}
{"text":"I've gone here a few times to see bands. It's alright. The bar is fairly large, and they have volleyball outside. I've never been impressed with the barstaff. Not exactly running up to greet you and get your order, and the mixed drinks are always a bit off. I've never had any of the food, but I've heard it's decent. I will go here again if there's a band I want to see(because it's only a few blocks from home), but you'll never hear me say \"Whadya say we go to the Tavern for a night of fun?!?!\""}
{"text":"The Club Tavern is a diamond in the rough! The food is always good and the chefs specials are always so tasty! One of my favorite \"specials\" was the cinnamon roll pancakes with cream cheese drizzle. Pair it with a bacon Bloody Mary with a beer chaser and your set! Great live music and Moose the owner is always so friendly and remembers his customers. Only downside is the parking is difficult but parking on the street solves that problem."}
{"text":"I give the stars for the music. I don't know what has happened to this place in recent years but don't go there to eat anything. It's overpriced food that is just ridiculously nasty. I've been going there for many years but I won't eat there anymore and some of my friends have said the same thing. I saw that used to have this catering truck sitting out by it and I was like who the heck would never cater food from that place. But I would highly recommend it if you want some good music and some drinks with friends. So not a family place. Also I used to really enjoy the atmosphere and its historical story. I kind of wish they would do a little more to emphasize that. It's one of the neater things about it"}
{"text":"We came here for Friday fish fry.   They serve a baked Walleye that is the best I have eaten in a long time.
Atmosphere is not 5 star, but the service is.
Quantity an quality of food was excellent and the price is just right"}
{"text":"Came in at 1:00 pm, bar was filthy and cluttered with glasses and dishes. Only 1 bartender who was deserted by her help. Not her fault but waiting a long time for a simple cheeseburger. This used to be an clean tavern with good service, no longer true. Adding insult to injury, my burger came overcooked on a stale bun, this place is a disgrace now. Oh yeah, they left a large rock right outside their door that I almost killed myself on tripping over it. Don't come here!!"}
{"text":"I dont know why people are ripping Club Tavern a new one, I love this place!! The drinks are cheap; I've purchased vodka tonics for $3 and top shelf for $4!  Its never too packed and the bartenders are always beyond friendly.  They probably also have the best bloody mary's  and chaser Ive had for those hair of the dog mornings.  And plus they have a slot machine there that pays out in cash, you cant really beat that!"}
{"text":"I gave this place so many chances in hopes I was there during someone's bad day but I've come to realize this place just generally sucks.  The second star is only because I have sympathy for hospitality employees working in a shitty situation and because my shot of Jameson was about 2.5 times the normal size - thanks.  The service here is always slow and on their terms.  Four of us ordered drinks and then asked for menus.  They were quick to take the order but nothing after that happened quickly.  About 40 minutes after we ordered (wings, chicken tenders, moose balls and a breakfast skillet) they informed my friend they were out of hollandaise sauce - fine, no big deal.  Ten minutes after that they brought our food out and, as he was setting our tenders down, informed us they were out of moose balls.  We only ordered two appetizers for two people so not having one of them was a bit of an issue.  Our tenders were missing the fries that the menu said they came with.  My friend's wings were so dry even sauce didn't make them better.  My other friend's skillet was disgustingly crunchy and her eggs were hard when she ordered over easy.  Clearly the kitchen prepared the food and then let it sit under the heat lamp for 15+ minutes.  In the end they took the Moose balls off and gave us some other form of balls to go and apologized.  

I'd be surprised if this place is still open in a year.  It's filthy everywhere, there might be 15 stools in the whole place that operates correctly or isn't missing half of the vinyl on the seat.  The doors are propped wide open for all of the cigarette smoke to waft in. We certainly won't be returning."}
{"text":"A quiet bar out in Middleton, it's certainly not the worst, but it ain't the greatest either.

Having now played 2 sessions of their \"intermediate\" volleyball leagues, I'm wishing the second one ended sooner.  They need to drag folks in, so they make you play, come hell or high water.  I've heard rumors of sand volleyball...in the snow.  Maybe I'm just bitter. cold.

The food is nothing worth writing home about.  The sandwiches are pretty standard fare and nachos are decent.  I'm a sucker for seasoned fries and they're pretty decent here, so I'll add another star.  Unfortunately, the beer isn't cheap, nor were there other obvious specials.  Look around and find somewhere else if you're out for an evening of drinking.

The TVs aren't all that great for a sports bar, which the Club Tavern tries to achieve, as far as I can tell.  There is a projector and large screen, but I haven't seen it used.They've got a couple of pool tables and dartboards as well.

The bartenders aren't terrible, it just takes some time for them to warm up to you.  After my 4th or 5th trip there (again, because of the volleyball league), they were friendly and joking around with the crew."}
{"text":"Heard about this place. Thought I would try it. Bar was dirty. Not wiped off. Took 10 minutes for a bartender to ask what I wanted even bough the place wasn't very busy. Asked for a menu. Got one. Tried to get their attention at least 4 times to order food. Or another beer. No luck. Waited over a half hour. Empty glass in front of me. Watched several other customers wait as well. Place appears to be well staffed but they were oblivious that there were customers there!!  Had to even ask twice to pay and leave! First time I have ever NOT left a tip! Won't be back again. 
Beer was cold....only plus."}
{"text":"Moose is the owner of this kingdom!! 
Seat yourself for lunch. 
Waitress (Kelley) was super friendly knowledgeable of specials and quickly brought our drinks. 
They have Wednesday and Friday fish during Lent and fifty cent wings (boneless or regular) on Wednesdays, and three other lunch specials in addition to the menu. 
They have a beautiful, fully stocked salad bar which includes three soups ( today's were French onion, chicken enchilada and chili) 
I ordered the all you can eat soup and salad bar, a diet Pepsi and my boyfriend ordered the two piece beer battered cod with baked potato , a Goose Island IPA and one trip salad bar and we had six boneless teriyaki wings for the table.     
The salad bar was fresh with romaine lettuce, mushrooms, cheese, cottage cheese, real bacon bits, shredded chicken, tomatoes, fresh baby peas, black olives, hard boiled eggs, seven dressings, nut seeds and homemade croutons. Also a pasta salad, a potato salad and coleslaw.  Uber delicious; I also had two cups of the chili with cheese and oyster crackers. 
Only low: no beans in the chili, but tons of tomatoes and celery, onions and ground beef... Great flavor!! 
My diet Pepsi was gigantic and comes with free refills. 
My BF's fish was crispy golden outside and perfect and piping hot inside. Baked potato perfect (extra butter on table and lots of fun condiments in a cute little basket too) the wings were perfectly seasoned crispy hot and came with celery sticks, ranch or blue cheese, and wet wipes for our hands.  Extra napkins on table.  
Waitress Kelley was attentive to our every need. She made an effort to speak to us both and even placed the check between us; not assuming that my man would pay just because he's a gentleman. (These little things matter to me when I eat out with wait staff service.)
The facility itself was clean, cutely decorated with a separate full bar and stage for karaoke night every Monday and Wednesday nights. 
Slots, darts, and pool too. 
Their restrooms were immaculate? 
Overall, a really great place for a nice quiet lunch or dinner and even a dancing area for those weekend nights. 
I recommend this restaurant for families, date night, business luncheon, and they even cater events! 
There you have it.... Give it a try; I think you'll agree...you'll want to come back here just like me"}
{"text":"Surprisingly good food.  The cheese curds were decent, but I really enjoyed the \"buddah\" boneless wings with ranch dressing.  NOM!  One of our party had some cheese-stuffed burger that looked to die for.  I wish I would have ordered that.

The staff took good care of our party.

It's not the cleanest or brightest place to hang out, but the food is really good.  

There are a lot of food places that have bars, but don't be mistaken - this is a bar that serves food.  Bar first.  I wouldn't send my parents here, but I'd go back when I'm craving a good bar burger."}
{"text":"Fantastic for St Patrick's Day - I've been looking for a worthy destination since Irish Waters closed five or so years ago, and have finally found it! Great meal, great value, fantastic, speedy service and perfect atmosphere. 

Only thing lacking is the quality if the corned beef - if it were a little better of a cut, I'd have given it five stars.

Yum."}
{"text":"I'm reviewing the Club Tavern & Grille as the restaurant today.  I stopped in for a late brunch on Saturday.  I asked about the prime rib and egg plate.  I was told that the breakfast portion of the menu stops at 1:00 pm but she'd ask if a late order could be placed.  She came back and I was able to order it as the kitchen still had the breakfast items out.  So the extra star is for that and the nice attention by my server.

The cut of meat was cooked well and smelled great.  The flavor of the meat had a strong seasoning.  It was not off putting, it was just a bit more than I was looking for.  The American potatoes on the other hand had a strange taste to them.   I didn't send them back because I didn't need them.  I will know to change them out or skip them all together next time.  The Eggs and Toast were as expected.  Top that off with a beer and I was good.

The dining room has seen brighter days.  The floors need to be redone at the next available chance.  But the decorations and stone walls have always been part of the charm of this divey tavern.  The Staff have always been nice and accommodating in the Grill or in the Bar.  I chalk up this spot as a better bar than restaurant but if you keep with the basics ( hamburgers, fries, fried foods ) you are going to be okay."}
{"text":"The wait staff were non-existent, the food was atrocious, the mixed drinks weren't drinkable, and the atmosphere was filthy. What more can I say? Ick."}
{"text":"Great for their sand volleyball leagues and a super fun referee, but double check the schedule as the games magically seem to shift without notice. 

The food is not so great and neither is the beer on tap. I've felt the repercussions of their dirty tap lines way too many times the next day after one beer or two, so stick with canned and bottled beer. Their seasoned french fries are delicious if they're served fresh and their wings are ok."}
{"text":"Visited for the first time for Friday Night Happy Hour.  Admittedly I wasn't sure what I walked in to...the interiors are divey and I didn't have food, but I was compelled to write a review because I had one of the BEST bloody mary's I've had in the area!  Shrimp, sausage, cheese, pickle...ordered extra spicy with a perfect about of kick....I will be going back just to have another!  Nice work Club Tavern!"}
{"text":"Four of us came here to enjoy some drinks and music. Great selection of beers on tap and daily deals. On the other hand, The bartender forgot to put our cheese curds until we reminded them the second time (wasn't busy). Bearded bartender was quite rude and short, seemed as he didn't appreciate our service."}
