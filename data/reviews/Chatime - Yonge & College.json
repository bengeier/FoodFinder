{"text":"Milk tea with pearls is the standard and also Chatime's most popular item. But there are so many other great options to choose from. 

I recently tried the yogurt lemon tea and found it amazingly refreshing and tart. The brewed Oolong milk tea with pearls and red beans was interesting - the flavour was slightly herbal with a smoky after-taste. I'm happy I got it with no sugar because the red beans add a fair bit of sweetness.

If you don't like to stray too much from the basics, try the roasted milk tea - which adds a slightly stronger flavour to their original milk tea. I had mine with coconut pieces and wasn't disappointed. 

Given the high traffic at this location and almost unlimited number of possible drink customizations, service can be understandably slow at times. But you can tell the staff is trying their best to keep up the pace and despite my complicated orders, I always receive very friendly service."}
{"text":"I was at the Yonge & College location last night to get my usual RMT and Jasmine green tea for take-out. There's only 2 people working, 1 at the cashier and the other one was making the orders. Sometimes the cash person would go and help the other. It was a very slow phase, was standing for probably 20 minutes until I got my order. When I got home, the jasmine green tea wasn't correct, it's probably switched to someone else's order. It tasted like lychee (sweet and sour), but it's labeled as jasmine pearl green tea. I didn't want to go back cuz I don't live close by.
What a dissapointment. Lesson learned, when you get take out, always try a zip first before leaving the store."}
{"text":"The worst Taro Smoothie in the world. A smoothie is suppose to be ice chip free and smooth. Every sip was me biting into an ice chip. Better off drinking powder and milk bubble tea. I think there were actual pieces of Taro in the smoothie?????!?!?!? Well it didnt add to the flavour thats for sure!!!!!"}
{"text":"The service is good but after I bought a cup of milk tea today at yonge&college, and I found this in my milk tea"}
{"text":"Good tasting drinks.

If you're craving for some tasty drinks, be sure to drop by Chatime. Chatime has a great selection of drinks including bubble tea, lattes, tea, mousses, smoothies, and coffee.

I ordered the matcha mousse and it was delicious. It was well made with the right proportions of mousse, sugar, and matcha tea. None of the ingredients seemed overpowering or bland, they were just the right amount.

The menu is decently priced with patrons being able to purchase a large drink for around $5."}
{"text":"After wanting to try this place for a looong time, I finally went today. Like most bubble tea places in Taiwan, there are many, many options to choose from, different kinds of tea (e.g. traditional milk tea made with black tea, tieguanying, jasmine, green tea...etc), different 'fillings' (bubbles, grass jelly...etc). If you want to add bubbles to a drink that doesn't have one it's an extra $0.50, which is pretty reasonable. The flavour of the place is really good -- one of the best I've had in Toronto for sure. I like that they also give you options for either a hot or cold drink, how much ice you want, and how sweet you want it. 
So, i'm giving it three stars for two reasons. One: It is just so ridiculously expensive for milk tea. In Taiwan, a basic milk tea goes for about a dollar, and 'fancy' ones go for less than $2. I know, i know, we're in Canada, but still, the basic ingredients are simple, it shouldn't cost an arm and a leg. I just can't bring myself to get this (again), despite how much i like it. 
Second: The person who was working behind the counter had trouble understanding the order.. as a result, out of the three drinks we ordered, two were wrong. I ordered a milk tea with bubbles and red bean and there was no red bean (i was so disappointed, especially for $4.50 a drink)! Another ordered no sugar, but there was sugar.. Also, even though I ordered it 50% sugar, the drink was still incredibly sweet, i can't imagine what it would be like if it were the full sweetness.. but then again, maybe they screwed up the sugar part too and didn't give me 50%.. 
Anyway, the place is decent, but unless I win the lottery (you're looking at $5 milk teas after tax..), I'll just get my bubble tea fix elsewhere."}
{"text":"Perfect for when you need your bubble tea fix at College Park!

The service is friendly and reasonably quick for being so busy. 

They carry macrons and a small selection of cakes too!"}
{"text":"Got myself Coconut milk tea and the other is Matcha Milk tea  Bubble tea is just too good to not have!

Service was quick even in the rush - was still good!"}
{"text":"Chatime has the best bubbles in downtown. Tea is consisent too, still a bit weak for me, but I still come here often. 

This location can be quite busy, but not as insane as the Dundas location. Seating is less cramped here as well.

How fast you'll get your drink depends largely on two factors:
1) The staff who is serving you. Some days, they are very efficient. Some other days, they are less professional, just chatting with each other and taking their sweet time making your drink. 
2) If a pick-up order from a delivery company comes in"}
{"text":"Just visited their latest location here at Yonge and College. If this location and their staff wasn't new, I would've given them 2/5 instead but today I'm lenient and would review again when they settle in :)

This location has one of the best interior designs I've seen at Chatime with floral patterns. Its nothing big but their seating area is relatively vast compared to other locations because the store shape is more squared.

The drinks were perfectly alright in taste - just like any other Chatime.

Why I wouldn't give them a high rating though?
(Note: I went after the BOGO offer ended)

- Cash only; credit card system under maintenance (thank goodness my coworker brought cash or else we would have commuted for nothing)
- Chatime Vicinity card machine is not set up yet = 4 points gone down the drain
- Staff wasn't as polite in taking orders especially when it was more complicated
- Slow service and still in training perhaps
- One milk tea drink was missing our requested pudding topping yet we still got charged for it

I won't be visiting awhile for now.
Hope they gradually get better!"}
{"text":"????chatime?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Dropped by Chatime on a Saturday afternoon for a quick drink. There wasn't much of a crowd inside so the wait was very short considering it takes me quite long to decide on what drink to get. 

I decided to go for the classic roasted milk tea with grass jelly. Service was fast and the person at cash was very diligent and made sure to double check the order before letting you pay.
 
Prices are the typical of all bubble tea places, around $5 for a drink, more if you want extra toppings/add-ins. Each add-in is $0.50. What I usually do is go for a drink that already has toppings included in it, so I can save that extra $0.50. 

Will definitely return considering its fairly close to UofT campus!"}
{"text":"I have a bubble tea addiction. Especially to chattime. Even more so, I'm in love with their milk tea smoothie. Very few chattime have it around the city. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Place is pretty spacious, despite the amount of space they have to work with.

They have a screen that explains how to order a drink. I didn't know you could choose to have it warm or cold on most of the options.

They've got milktea of the month which provides incentive to try something new. Never thought of getting chocolate flavoured for example, though I just realized they may have forgotten that it was monthly deal...oh well.

Orders are fulfilled quickly, but there's a problem with when they come to take your order. My issue with this location is they offer uber eats, and if a large order comes in, they pretty much drop everything to process the uber order. This includes customers waiting in line. If they've already taken your order they will take care of it first if it's not too time-consuming.

During the course of my stay, an uber order for 8 drinks came in. They stopped taking orders cause the person taking them also went to help make the drinks. Later on, another uber order came in and you can hear the person shout out \"uber order 2 drinks\". They didn't stop the line though for this one

Delivery people came in really quickly, like literally a few minutes later looking for the orders.

Like really, I don't think uber customers deserve higher priority than people that make the effort to come into the store, even if the app is designed so that all parties involved must rush to meet delivery times. But it's good to see that they try their best I suppose to meet those delivery times."}
{"text":"In awe at their new \"Twilight\" series, I decided to come here and give it a try. Me being the curious person I am, I asked a bunch of questions and the cashier was very nice in explaining all of the drinks to me in detail. 

However, this is definitely the first time that I've been to a Chatime where certain drinks were sold out - and to my luck, it was 3/4 of the drinks in the series. So basically, I was forced to have the Hibiscus Sunset Tea. I asked for tapioca and she recommended me not to get it because it messes with the gradient and \"specialty\" of the drink.. so I listened.

Honestly, the drink wasn't special at all. It could easily pass for any passionfruit tea and I probably would've enjoyed it better had I gotten tapioca with it. I would not order this drink again, but this location is fine. Well-staffed, nice staff, and relatively clean."}
{"text":"I've been to numerous Chatime locations, and this one is definitely the slowest, but as other Yelpers have mentioned it could be that the staff are still new.  My main concern is that all the drinks seem to be more diluted.  They're starting to taste quite bland and you can only taste the sweetness from the flavoured powder or flavoured syrup and only with a slight hint of tea.   

If you watch the staff making your drink, you'll notice they'll start filling half of the cocktail shakers from one of the drink dispensers labeled as \"ICE WATER\".   So I'm not quite sure, how much tea actually goes into the bubble tea anymore. Maybe they're trying hard to stretch out the tea and sell more drinks made with more water, since water is a lot cheaper than tea."}
{"text":"Favourite bubble tea shop in the area. Get the taro coconut smoothie in large (you'll want it all). Every topping they offer are excellent as well. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place is always soooo busy and full of students. Great location in one of the main arteries, but the wait for a drink reminds me of waits at Starbucks on busy days. I usually get the Original Milk Tea with Pearls and regular ice and sugar. Tastes great, want to check out if they have a slush version as I love my ice. Okay place if you have time to wait for a drink and aren't annoyed by crowds.

Don't order the Taro unless you want the weirdest consistency. I can't even explain it - but feels maybe like what spoiled milk feels like and tastes pretty gross compared to Real Fruit Bubble Tea which IMHO has the best Taro Bubble Tea."}
{"text":"This was my first time today at this location, and I can definitely say it's not as busy as the dundas location. Thank god. The location here is quite spacious and today a really friendly cashier greeted me and even said \"hi, how are you?\" With a big smile on her face!! No one ever does that at chatime! So I was a bit surprised lol. 

Anyways, I ordered my usual grass jelly roasted milk tea, but this time instead of 30% sugar like I usually get i asked for no sugar. Personally, I found it a bit bland and will go back to 30% next time. Reason why I won't give this place more stars is because there were only two staff working  so wait time was a bit slow."}
{"text":"My favourite teas are the lychee aloe green tea and the roasted milk. My boyfriend loves the taro with pudding. I also really liked this popcorn flavour they had awhile ago. We're always tempted by the seasonal flavours."}
{"text":"I live right around the corner from this Chatime and I have nothing negative or positive to say about this location. 

Just like any other Chatime expect pretty long line ups and only three (max four employees) working. I will be coming back because I always have cravings for Chatime and I have never had a problem with this location."}
{"text":"I always have to wait in line, Service was ok . I dont feel like coming back there again"}
{"text":"I've always gone to Ten Ren. But was recently introduced to Chatime. LOVE their hot roasted milk tea latte with pearls. It feels like a warm hug. I've been twice so far. It's popular but I haven't had to wait too long. The space is big so I'd like to go one day and hang out after work with some friends. Next time I will ask for no sugar as I feel the pearls make it sweet enough for me. Their price is better than Ten Ren's in my opinion. The service was great too."}
{"text":"I used to love this location  but tonight is the third time I come in and leave after waiting for over 20 mins without being served. I just got their elite stats card after buying so much  and I was excited to use it. But seems like this location is either a training center or they just don't care . On a Saturday night 4 people only working is non sense . I guess it's so long Chatime yonge and college"}
{"text":"I've been to this Chatime a few times and it's usually because its close to Ryerson and right off College station. I ordered the newest flavor of Chatime which was the Roasted Blueberry Muffin Milk Tea and ordered their Strawberry Milk, both with rainbow jelly. They are usually pretty efficient and quick here. Limited seating at this location with a few tables. Can't really say anything bad about Chatime. I've always been a huge fan of their bubble tea. Hands down. 5/5 stars."}
{"text":"Great variety of teas, very fast service. The only problem is the sitting area is too small and often crowded. Other than that great place to get your bubble tea"}
{"text":"Okay, where do I start? I loved Chatime. I'm a huge bubble tea lover and whenever I see a place I pretty much have to go try it out. After being in Toronto for a couple of days so far I can say that this has been the best bubble tea I have tried out of all the places I've been to in different cities. 

Walking into the shop, they had awesome music going on and a huge selection of bubble tea. There was a huge line which usually is a good thing. 

I picked the coconut milk tea with pudding, boba, and coconut jelly. I love how they cater to what you like. You can basically pick the ice, sweetness, and topping levels and even pick between their top 10 flavors. 

I'll definitely be coming back here many times during my week-stay."}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few times since they've opened. Super convenient location right at Yonge and College intersection and  not as busy as the Chatime on Dundas. 

I have found the menu and drinks I've received to be made pretty consistently. The space is also nice and spacious. There are usually several tables open. The staff is also super friendly.

However, each time that I've gone, they've been progressively getting busier and busier, but the number of staff does not seem to have changed. Currently, I would expect a 15-20 minute, which isn't too bad compared to other Chatimes. I hope they continue to expand to meet up with the demand."}
{"text":"The best thing about Chatime is the quality of their ingredients.  They seem to have better tasting tea and pearls than their competitors.  They have their own tea plantations that supply their tea!

They are also consistent.

What is hit and miss between their stores is service.  The service at this one was decent - probably because it wasn't busy early Sunday afternoon - the previous night the one on Dundas was bonkers with a line out the door.

Small sitting area / fortunately no problem finding a seat but can see this being difficult during prime time.

Prices are standard for Toronto.  They take credit, debit and cash."}
{"text":"I love Chatime with a passion. This new location is a much welcomed addition to the neighbourhood. The drinks are amazing as usual (try matcha mousse or qq lychee) and they will look up your vincinity account for you if you forget your card like I tend to do. They even kept the chrome old school coffee dome from the previous coffee shop tenants and that made me happy because it's very pretty. They also have a tv that shows you tweets that were hashtagged with chatime tags. Anyway not much else to say except that this is a Chatime and they are the king of bubble tea!"}
{"text":"I remember back when the very first Chatime opened at Bay and Dundas a few years ago - I used to go there almost everyday because it was the best bubble tea place at the time. Thanks to the Chatime boom, a lot of other bubble tea chains in Asia made their way over, and now I'm happy to have a nice selection of bubble tea shops to go to when I'm craving it.

So that's really the problem. There's so much competition around Chatime that it's not as special as it once was. Just around this Chatime location, there's a Jules, ShareTea, Chachago, HiTea, Tea Shop 168 (ok, don't ever go there), and CoCo just recently opened a bit down the street. Chatime has a pretty good roasted milk tea that other stores don't carry, and their taro milk tea is probably the best (but for a taro slush, go to ShareTea for their Handmade Fresh Taro). Their QQ grapefruit juice is pretty good too, and their hot almond milk tea with sweet potato is my favourite drink from them (although it's unfortunate that it's only available for a limited time in the winter).

While that seems like a good selection, I find that a lot of their other drinks tend to taste bland if you ask for less or no sugar. Now, you might suggest to just get more sugar - but the point of the drink is not to just taste the sweetness of the sugar, it should be infused with other flavours. Their oolong milk tea tasted like water without any sugar, when it should taste like oolong tea with milk. Also, their fairy vanilla milk tea was flat out gross, would definitely not recommend.

The line at the Bay and Dundas location is ridiculous at times, so it's nice to see that this location is emptier and there's a lot of table space for you to hang out, or even study as they provide wifi. Now even though they tend to be emptier, the service is a lot slower as there are fewer workers, so you'll still have to be patient. I find the workers here to be much friendlier than the other Chatime locations, so that's a plus.

Although Chatime is not my favourite bubble tea place anymore, I am thankful for what they've brought to the Toronto bubble tea scene. Thanks to them, we're not just stuck with Tenren's, Tea Shop 168, and Bubble Tease (ehh...) anymore, so for that I give them an extra +1."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend to grab some bbt before class started. We decided on getting the Strawberry Au Lait Pudding. The person taking our order put down Strawberry Au Lait (no pudding) and we didn't realize it until later on (ok, that was our fault that we didn't mention anything about it). Another girl was making it and I think she made a mistake cause another girl slapped her on the arm and she paused before going to the back with our drinks. Finally she came back with our drink (what was she even doing in the back??). By then we were in a hurry to rush back to class cause we waited 15 mins for both drinks when there was NO ONE in front of us and 5 people who order after us got their drinks before us...

Aside from the service though, the drink was pretty good itself. Reminded me of Starbucks Strawberry and Cream Frap but better. I think it's cause of the tarty-ness that I really enjoyed. I'll be back next time to get the one that comes with pudding next time and hopefully they'll get it right."}
{"text":"Been back a lot and I really enjoy the service from these three tearistas specifically. Unfortunately, did not catch their names but I believe the two girls are sisters, look very a like! And the male who's been there for a very long time with glasses are always welcoming. They never get orders wrong and always present themselvew with great attitudes unlike many other tearistas I've encountered."}
{"text":"This is probably the fastest Chatime I've ever been to. There was no line when we arrived and the barista finished making my drink before I even paid! 4 stars for speedy service and convenient location."}
{"text":"FYI, Use spc card to get a free topping!

Chatime is still my all time favorite milk tea spot after I tried every brand of bubble tea places. Their tapioca is always fresh, you can tell by the chewiness of each pearl. I know a lot milk tea places don't have fresh tapioca because they taste soft and soggy, which is no good. 

This location is always busy, free Wi-Fi."}
{"text":"I love going to this Chatime location because unlike the Dundas location, there's no need to squeeze through tables and the line (especially during winter time). I've been to this several times ever since it opened and had been a great spot for when I wanted an after-work bubble tea. It's right by College station which is also a bonus. 

Sometimes my drinks would taste less or way too extra sugary (I always get extra sugar in all my faves or TOTM) but it's never a huge issue. Sometimes the Mango Juice QQ tastes a little bitter mango-y but it depends on who's making it. Again, doesn't matter to me because I end up loving the taste anyway. 

My only complaint would be that I wish the waiting area for your drink was more spacious. It's also the walkway to the washroom or some customers wouldn't move inward so there's more space for others to wait. Sometimes you end up up against their little banner displays near that one table and/or the table where people are sitting. Which ends up being awkward if your backpack or behind is saying hello to their faces lol."}
{"text":"not bad not bad at all. 

It is just like every other Chatime, but an experience deemed it worthy to get a review. 

When we arrived, there was a small hold up. No, not a line up, but a hold up. Due to some malfunctioning of the machine. However, I observed the concentrated facial expression of the Tea Shop barrista and thought that she handled the situation quite well under pressure. The minute she fixed the machine, they were able to print a whole series of orders in one go, as well as handling the upcoming order with ease. The quality of tea that day was perfect as well, so I thought that's worth mentioning."}
{"text":"This place gets really busy sometimes so I do applaud the efficiency of the employees. They are also very kind and they make good suggestions about what you should try and how much sugar you should put in your drink for example. 

The reason why I would not rate this place higher is because of the amount of ice they put in their drinks. Don't get me wrong, I love some ice in my drink but I do not want a whole iceberg in there. I even asked for very little ice and instead, half of my cup was filled with ice. My drink tasted good for the first 10 sips. Then it just tasted like water. 

If I am paying $4-$5 for some bubble tea, I would want it to taste like that and not some water that has \"hints\" of tea flavour."}
{"text":"So happy that a Cha Time opened in this area. It's just steps from the College subway station, super convenient. While it does have a steady flow of customers, I have been a few times now and never had to wait more than 5 minutes. This location doesn't have the same crazy lineups like the original one at Bay/Dundas. 

The space is nice and bright, with a few tables. I usually get my tea to go, but I often see Ryerson students sitting in groups studying. They are part of the Vicinity rewards program so you can collect points every time you buy something and earn free drinks. 

As for the tea itself, it's the same great Cha Time menu and you can adjust the ice and sugar levels to your liking. The classic black pearl milk tea is always good, but I also like the brown rice tea, coconut milk tea, and caramel milk tea. I haven't tried their hot tea lattes yet. The tapioca consistency is usually good, although once the pearls were a bit too firm. 

Service is always friendly and polite. 

This is my new go-to if I'm just looking for my bubble tea fix. If I want somewhere a bit more serene to sit and stay for a while, I prefer Jule on Carlton."}
{"text":"During my lunch break today and other afternoons in the past few months, I took the subway from my work at Summerhill down to this location & it's worth the trip everytime. They make the best quality Bubble Tea   I've ever had. I always get the Taro flavor from them and they make it really well with fancy state of the art equipment. What makes them unique from all other Bubble Tea places, is that they give you the ability to customize your levels of ice & sugar, and other ingredients, which I love because I don't like a lot of ice in my drink. One day, I hope to get adventurous and try some of their other flavors too. I've also been to the Burnhamthorpe location in Mississauga and again I had no issues with my drink there either, which proves that their product quality is consistent no matter what location you go to. 

In terms of customer service however, I like this Toronto location better as the wait times are shorter than the Mississauga shop and it's less crowded. 

Pricewise, it's a little expensive but you do get what you pay for so I don't mind.

It would also be nice if they could later on introduce a snack menu like some of the other Bubble Tea places."}
{"text":"Amazing but MAKE SURE when you order to ask for less ice so that you get more tea, and if you are expecting sweet tea ask for extra sugar because you won't taste it if you get it alone. I had the matcha latte and immediately regretted the whole thing because I couldn't taste the sugar."}
{"text":"Good small and busy bubbletea place right downtown at Yonge and College. Nothing special and not bad."}
{"text":"I love Chatime but this location is too disappointing. It is close to work so it's convenient to go on my break. However, the baristas are extremely slow. The baristas need to develop a better system to make the drinks or stronger trainers to make sure the production of drinks is not slowed down. Chatime lineups are insane. I ordered 6 drinks once where there was no line and I still waited 20 minutes. Please increase your efficiency because I will just save my money for starbucks because they are more efficient. I do not want to waste my breaks waiting for a beverage and not even having time to enjoy it."}
{"text":"Wintermelon milk tea was made poorly the first time I came here.... Super sweet. Service is pretty slow too. Second visit they messed up our order twice. Needs improvement."}
{"text":"Yepi! another Chatime opened just on my way home-work!
It is clean, and modern and drinks as good as any other Chatime location. So cool!! 

As it is new, staff is still training and wait time is a bit longer than the Dundas place, but it will get better (and they will stop putting their fingers inside the cups when handling them). They do not have yet the machine yet, so cash only and no Chatime reward card to use. (reason for my 4 starts rather than 5)

Now just open a Rikuro cheesecake store just beside and I'll be even happier!!"}
{"text":"Another Chatime!!! This one in southeast corner of College Park 

The decor in this one is quite nice and modern, lots of wood panels up the walls. The girls behind the counter were very helpful and seemed ready to quickly rideout the \"learning curve\". The Grand Opening special runs until August 26th and is BOGO - buy any drink, and get another regular drink from their choice of 3 drinks (pineapple teair, grass jelly roasted milk tea or passionfruit tea) for free!

The drink was fine, and seems like there's more comfortable seating than other Chatimes. however, I can tell when the inevitable lineup happens, because you KNOW it will, it will be quite a squishy lineup.

As of right now - they are still cash only!"}
{"text":"Sometimes I like coming here more than the Dundas location. I have been going here ever since it opened. I always get the classic (#1) the pearl milk tea, with less sugar which is still sweet enough for me. It's a good place to hang out with a group of friends and just talk. 

I do recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Not everyone is perfect which is how I justify some of the experiences I've had here. Does it deter me from ever coming back? No way! Because the good always outweighs the not-so-good.

One thing to be said about this location is that they're quite quick. Many times they have a line up out the door, but I'm impressed by how quickly they work. There have been instances where my order is wrong, but for the most part they've been consistent with their drinks. The location has more available seating than the one on Dundas depending on the time which is why I prefer it. It's right by College station which makes it convenient.

I've always received great customer service here. I once spilled a drink on myself while on a date - I'm talking half the contents of a large bubble tea forming a mini swimming pool in my lap. One of the Chatime brothers tried to salvage my dignity and quickly offered me a clean rag to mop myself up and then proceeded to mop up the floor. They're actually the best."}
{"text":"Really small cha time in a central location = packed all the time. Waited literally forever to get a drink :(

TBH ever since they started posting calories on the menu I've hugely refrained from buying chatime, but I will still do so once in a while until I finish up my gift card haha. 

Ordered the QQ mango with half sweetness and it was still way too sweet :( can't even imagine what regular sweetness would be like"}
{"text":"I was pretty excited to hear about a new Chatime opening up since I usually have a good experience here. Step in and you'll notice that the inside is nice and well-designed. It was pretty quiet on a Saturday afternoon when I went so that's a plus. The Vicinity rewards system IS working at this location now. The main problem is that the bubble tea here doesn't taste as good as the bubble tea from the Dundas location. The tapioca was hard, and there were no little lychee bits in the tea, which the Dundas location usually has. Not say that it was bad bubble tea. It was fine, but just not the usual Chatime level! just Chatime prices. Also, I was the only one ordering and it still took them a pretty long time to make my order for some reason."}
{"text":"Ok so I ordered 6x pearl milk teas for me and some friends to go at this location on wednesday one out of the 6 I drank had a piece of scrap metal from the metal scrubs so I'm guessing they didn't clean the drink dispenser properly because as I was chewing on the tapioca I felt something in my mouth that wasn't right and it turned out to be that, I called the store back to let them know what happened the guy just apologized twice and said I'd get a free drink next time.
Also note I wasn't pissed off or anything i just wanted to them them know about this and that their cleaning should be done more carefully 

Anyways still got my receipt don't know when I'll come back again, I just called to let them know what I found in my drink so hopefully they do a proper cleaning of their drink dispensers next time"}
{"text":"Chatime is usually a hit or miss for me. Sometimes their tapioca is too hard and sometimes the drinks are overly sweet even when you ask for less sugar. There are plenty of other bubble shops that have better, consistent quality. This location is very convenient for students that go to Ryerson however, imo there are better bubble locations around the area."}
{"text":"This is a newish location ; it was told it opened 1+month ago. 
The menu is identical to other Chatime locations. 
Let's start off with all the positives: 
  - super friendly staff 
  - excellent location
  - spacious sitting areas
  - not as busy/crowded as the one near Dundas/Yonge
  - consistent menu as other locations 

The store has been here for a little while, however it seems like they still haven't \"settled\" in. A few negative things with today visit:
- drink of the month (wintermelon mousse) wasn't available as they don't have mousse, but they couldn't substitute it another drink. But there's big signs advertising for drink of the month everywhere.

- vicinity card system still doesn't work; cashier scanned it a few times and still didn't work. Cashier told me it \"worked\" but I knew the point wasnt added.

- they still don't have any napkins seriously. Napkins are kinda like the essential for a restaurant business IMO. The cashier was apologetic and quickly ran to get us some brown paper towel to use instead.

- they are understaffed. It was fairly busy today but there were only two staff working which meant the wait was longer. I honestly feel bad for those two as they worked non stop. 

Overall, I would have given it 1-2 stars if it wasn't for the friendly staff that served us today. I am a fan of Chatime and have been to different locations many times and it had always been pleasant experiences in the past.
I hope  Chatime management at this location will look into addressing these issues. I will give this location another try when I am in the area the next time. Hoepfully by then everything will be smooth."}
{"text":"There are pros and cons with this location. It's faster and less of a line up but the service is horrible. 

I ordered two drinks but the girl got confused and I had to repeat myself multiple times. They don't give you a bag when you order where the other one always gives you a bag. It took 10 mins before they did. 

Also, they hand the drinks wet and drenching in bubble tea. ?"}
{"text":"Chatime is one of my favourite spots for bubble tea!  They have so many options to choose from on their menu and their drinks are so refreshing. Even their tapioca tastes very fresh. Also, their smallest size is still very generous. The one complaint I have with Chatime is that their drinks overall seem to be sweeter than bubble teas elsewhere; their honey green tea is overly sweet and not quite what I was expecting. Overall, a great place to grab a drink with friends!"}
