{"text":"Had a great box lunch, roast beef sandwich
The roast beef was fresh cut not prepacked 
Veggies fresh. Everyone working had a really good attitude and friendly.  I will be back"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised, ordered a avacado/bacon turkey sandwich for delivery and it was delicious, came with chips on the side but they forgot my pickle, but thats ok. This place is 20x better than the other sandwich shops and it was quite filling, will be back again, lets hope they dont forget my pickles next time."}
{"text":"This place is DELICIOUS! Everything I have gotten there has been good... From the Mac and cheese sandwhich to the spicy skyler to a salad everything is fresh and yummy. The past time I was there they ran out of romaine lettuce for the salad I ordered and had to use a different kind of mixed greens so they gave me a discount as a courtesy. Very nice people who value their customers!"}
{"text":"Had the Greek salad with Chicken and the Spicy Skyler panini, both were excellent. Mom & Pop place very clean, good menu."}
{"text":"Where do I begin?  I was the first one through the door this morning and yet there were crumbs on the table I can only assume were from the night before. I ordered an egg salad on wheat which when upon returning to my office I found had been put on wheat toast and served with stale chips and missing the pickle that was supposed to come with it.  The sandwich was dry even though I'd ordered it with extra mayo.  Five people came in after me and there was only one employee working.  I can't believe the place I experienced is the same one getting all of these good reviews."}
{"text":"Best sandwich shop in Las Vegas lot of options and all delirious second visit same good quality"}
{"text":"This place has only been open since April 2015, but it seems like they have been open much longer, based on the level of service we received, and the number of patrons coming through the store.

I went 8 miles out of my way to give this place a shot, and am very glad I did.

Definitely s great place to come for a great meal; whether you are starving, or just feeling a bit pecking."}
{"text":"Food is super delcious! Yummy sandwiches, warm soups, and fresh salads. My only complaints is everytime I order something in my order is wrong, whether it's the bread or the condiments, and they move super slow. Yummy food but mediocre customer service."}
{"text":"We drove from the strip to Tups because we saw many good reviews about it. We ordered the Turkey Panini and the Pastrami Ruben. The turkey panini needed more turkey in it and the pastrami panini had a little bit too much sauerkraut. But over all nice delicious food and nice owners. The lady gave us the macaroni salad to try for free. We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Came in for a healthy salad due to being on a detox. They not only took the time to ask what I can and can't have, they created this amazing salad that made me not even sad that I couldn't have a bite of my husbands sandwich that he got which he loved! I can't wait to come back and try all the other sandwiches on the menu! Would def recommend this place"}
{"text":"Love this place I have tried salads and sandwiches and so nothing has let me down. No matter what you get that will be the best choice."}
{"text":"I was having a rough day at work and went to lunch. Deciding to try something new i found this little Gem Called Tups'. This sandwich shop is family owned and the service was great. They make you feel welcome and even ask if you need some recommendations on their menu. I tried the Rueben and i was completely blown away. This sandwich was cooked to perfection and don't even get me started on their Macaroni salad! The flavor was phenomenal and i intend to go back, i took a menu just for all my friends at work. Love love love this place."}
{"text":"Ok, I wasn't expecting much from a sandwich place, but man was I blown away!! The wait was a little long but he personally apologized and all was good. I got the turkey avacado sandwich with dijon mustard... YUM. My sisters food looked so good too. I would deffinantly come back!"}
{"text":"Amazing sandwiches and amazing service. Very big portion sizes. I have ordered several sandwiches and they are all delicious. My favorite is Jan's chicken Parm."}
{"text":"Great variety, amazing quality and excellent customer service by everyone who works there.  This sandwich shop rocks!"}
{"text":"Small family owned cafe where the food is really good and the workers are really friendly."}
{"text":"I got the chicken parm sandwich and it was delicious. With a side of coleslaw and potato chips, I left the restaurant with a smile."}
{"text":"Hidden behind a wall of fast food joints, Tups is a fantastic sandwich shop.  Great ingredients and friendly staff."}
{"text":"This place has the freshest sandwiches around. They have something for everyone.  I am not a pickle eater, but their pickles are the bomb. I would buy them from them by the jar.  I have had almost everything on the menu. It is worth the trip from North Las Vegas to Windmill just to have a piece of healthy HEAVEN!  (Sorry S*****) Keep up the good work looking forward to you expanding and delivery service."}
{"text":"Had KJ's Chicken Bacon Pesto Wrap and it was delicious. Friendly people and good music playing as well. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"always a pleasure to go here. staff is super nice and the sammies are always on point!"}
{"text":"Got the Dylan, great sandwich. If you are in the area and are hunger for a good sandwhich, this is a must stop."}
{"text":"The best sandwiches in town. Period. I haven't have them all but i will one day. They're now serving crepes which I'm sure they're amazing as well"}
{"text":"SOOOOO GOOOOOOD! The girl at the counter was a sweet girl and engaged in a nice conversation with me. Food was awesome. I just wish they had more dessert options. Not just the HUGE cupcakes lol. Other than that really yummy. Get some organic chicken and turkey soon please!"}
{"text":"I was a big fan of this place when it originally opened a couple years ago. I knew it changed owners so I hadn't been back in a while. I stopped in yesterday and the lunch rush had just passed so I got a chance to talk with the new owners while the husband made my sandwich. I love supporting local small business so it was really cool to get to know them. Had a funny moment when she was describing all the popular sandwiches because she basically named off every sandwich on the menu. 

Anyway, the food is even better and the owners are class acts. Followed up my great experience by buying lunch for our whole office with them today. Everyone is full and happy. Glad that I have another go to lunch place near by!"}
{"text":"Best sandwich shop I've been to in years! Very clean with fantastic owners and staff.  Received excellent recommendations from the fun hostess at the register.  I had a Spicy Skyler panini, my wife had the Chicken Parm, my daughter had a pastrami Ruben, other daughter had the turkey avo... I had to try a few bites of each one and couldn't pick a favorite, I loved them all!  Super great service and food.  We will come back to Tups next time we're in Vegas."}
{"text":"Tried Tups for the first time Saturday late afternoon.  Ordered two Classic Beef sandwiches to go.  They were prepared quickly and served with coleslaw and pickle (did not get chips for some reason). The sandwiches were nicely prepared, with a generous amount of lean roast beef, some terrific horseradish sauce, tomato, lettuce, and sweet pickle.  A;nice touch was packing them in cardboard containers rather than styrofoam-- very eco-friendly.Would highly recommend, and will certainly go back to sample other items from the menu."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a weekday. Good sandwiches, and wide selection on the menu for such a small place. Only drawback was they had kind of weird summer hours, close at 3pm so we barely made it in time and couldn't eat in the restaurant."}
{"text":"If I can make a sandwich at home, then why should I get one out? Sandwiches like these are the answer. 

The service here is wonderful. Everyone is kind and more than willing to accommodate anything you need or want. They aren't the fastest, but if I was in a hurry, I would have called ahead to place an order. 

We tried three sandwiches - the mac and cheese panini, the spicy skylar, and the pesto chicken and bacon. 

The mac and cheese panini was my least favorite. It was a little bland. The mac and cheese needed more seasoning. 

The spicy skylar was really good. It had the right amount of kick and the perfect combination of meats and cheese. I wouldn't change anything about it.

I ordered the pesto chicken and bacon as a sandwich instead of a wrap, and I was so pleased with my choice. The sandwich was stuffed with chicken and cheese. The pesto wasn't overwhelming. It was subtle. The cheese and chicken were the stars. 

The sandwiches are about $10, but they are huge, so I don't mind paying that. 

Overall, this is a good place. I hope they can do well, but the shopping center location could be a challenge."}
{"text":"Got the Spicy Skylar and it was the best Spicy Italian style sandwich I've ever had! Toasted with Italian bread makes the bread all crispy and delicious. Will always stop by here whenever I'm in town"}
{"text":"Best sandwiches I've had in Vegas so far. Can't wait to try their Paninis. I have tried the Classic Beef, Turkey Avocado, and the Grand Slam. Quality ingredients and generous portions will keep me coming back until I've worked my way through their whole menu. Great owner and employees always make it a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Family owned & friendly with fresh ingredients that melt in your mouth!! Try the Ryan or Turkey Avocado.  We stopped in on our way out of town (to Phoenix).  Owner helped us with directions and pit stop ideas.  Super place : )"}
{"text":"Found this place on Restaurant.com for our recent Vegas trip.  Nice little salad/sandwich/panini shop in a strip mall.  
Nothing fancy but everything is prepared for you on order, fresh, toasted hot, simple and not overly salted which we LOVEd.
The owner and crew were very pleasant and came over to check if everything was OK and also to have very friendly conversation (we went in between lunch and dinner time and it was not too busy).
Don't forget the pickle-on-a-stick - The best we've had so far!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Friendly good food and great atmophere. Very high quality specialty sandwich shop. You will not be dissapointed."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are amazing. The spicy italian sandwich with the pepper spread is absolutely delicious. It'a family owned which is great. The people are really friendly, which is refreshing considering most businesses treat you like a number. I will be a regular here."}
{"text":"Bad meat and bad customer service!! I ordered the roast beef Panini and the roast beef was green and shiny.  I called to complain and their response was we just cut it so it cannot be bad.  My company used to order from them all the time -- no more."}
{"text":"The GF and I were out and about in the kingdom of Hendo.  When there was a lull in the action and hunger needed to be destroyed, the infamous question...\"Where do you want to eat?\" was thrown out into the universe.

So one begins to bracket......when it's all said and done.....the digital sorcerer pulls from the pocket.....the digital stone of knowledge that is yelp.

Tups presented it's self with numerous happy reviews and so this would be the order of the day.

We made our way down to this obscure shopping center on the southeast corner of Eastern & Windmill.  Obscure for some...but upon further self reflection...I have have been her numerous times.  I have sought everything from avocados, to cough syrup, to a spinal adjustment.  Familiar.....yes.

When we arrived on a Saturday afternoon, Tups was empty.  But quickly another couple would roll in behind us and so would a take-out order.  Tups is cozy.  I would imagine this place during a weekend day would fill up quickly.  Don't let this discourage...more on that later...

There is a simple but complex menu presentation.  This was explained by the nice lady behind the counter.  The said that she had tried to downsize the menu but when something is taken off....the butterfly effect happens and those seeking a particular Tups sandwich are automatically crying out.  Not a bad problem to have for a business owner, and so it remains on the menu.

I ordered up the \"The Spicy Skyler\"-An Italian roll with salami, pepperoni, mortadella, capicola, ham, ghost pepper & provolone cheese, roasted peppers and hot giardiniera spread (http://www.whatsuptups.com/#!menu/soabe).  This a panini and it was delicious!  FRESH tasting & delicious!

My meal fell with the happy hour established by the establishment.  A major bonus is you get a fountain drink (I ordered a Pellegrino..does not count) and a bag of chips for FREE!  The mac salad was a cup of carb laden, sweet, starchy goodness!

I chatted up the nice lady (she is not Tups...Tups is gone) and found out she and her husband are the new owners for the past four months.  Clearly....a solid small business is continuing to continue on....even though it's changed hands.  I have no doubt that if I resided in this neck of the valley...I would absolutely be a frequent visitor!"}
{"text":"Tups has best sandwiches around this town. Very fresh   and clean as well. I love there new sandwich called KJ!! Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed this little sandwich shop. It's homely but the staff and food are top notch.  I had the Italian Stallion and Chocolate Lover crepes. Can't think of a way I would improve either."}
{"text":"The Turkey Caprese sandwich was excellent,  with a delicious Red Velvet Cupcake for dessert. The place was busy for lunch as I expect word is getting around they make great sandwiches using fresh quality ingredients.Everybody working there had a great attitude as they were working hard to put out good food."}
{"text":"Amazing sandwiches. The owner is very sincere and direct with customers. I'm coming back in the future"}
{"text":"Was here the other day and had a triple club sandwich.  The sandwich was amazing and looked just like the picture. The flavors were on point and the service was great. Great little sandwich spot."}
{"text":"You guys can go ahead and close the investigation, I figured out what the name means: \"Tups\" is from one of the owner's last name: Tupy. The more you know! ;)

Billed as a specialty sandwich shop, I think the Village Greek Salad ($11) is the best in town. It's huge and easily makes two meals for me, even without the side of pita bread. The feta vinagrette is amazing, and made in house. 

Shop is family owned and operated, with two (awesomely sweet!) teens running the register, grandma supervising, and dad(?) running the kitchen. As the signs say, it's fresh food not fast food- wait time is reasonable for the freshness, portion and quality are on par with the pricing."}
{"text":"Sandwich guy here....not sure how I missed this place. I've got family right behind this strip mall. Skip to the chase: Reuben panini was ridiculously good. Great press for crispy bites. Yum. Got a little free Mac salad with it. Pretty interesting as it has cinnamon in it. The slaw has bite to it, apparently. Wish I knew that before ordering. I'll get it next time! Thanks Yelp. Would have hit housefire  chain shop had I not seen this. Coming back in a few days. I'm an egg salad snob so curious to have this next."}
{"text":"I am not much of a sandwich person, but this is one of the few places I come to when I want one. Their chocolate chip cookies are amazing as well. Good price, good food, happy tummy!"}
{"text":"I love sandwiches. I make it my goal to try every local sandwich place I come across. Tups is one of the better places I've discovered. The staff is very friendly and makes you feel at home. They're all so happy to be help and seem genuinely excited to be working. 

The food is made with fresh ingredients and very tasty. I don't even like macaroni salad and I managed to finish mine (it was amazing)."}
{"text":"The service was a little slow for just one sandwich and the price was around $10 for what I ordered. It was an excellent sandwich but a bit expensive considering the size was small. They do give you a complimentary side,your choice of cole slaw or potato salad. Not a fan of either so it didn't matter to me. Overall Tups is a decent lunch spot."}
{"text":"Always great sandwiches!!!  Try the turkey avocado, Italian Stallion or the Spicy Skyler....ALL AMAZING!  Will return again and again!"}
{"text":"Small little sandwich shop. Friendly staff and great customer service! I ordered the spicy panini, with macaroni salad and a side of chips. The cup of macaroni salad was delicious! It was on the sweeter end with a good zing of tang. Usually side dishes are mediocre, but I found that the salad was awesome.  They recommended the spicy panini to me, but I'm sensitive to spicy foods, so they were able to mix the cheeses to tone down the spicy. The wait time for my sandwich was a little longer than I expected, but you can tell that they put a lot of time and effort to make a quality sandwich. The sandwich did not disappoint. It was fresh, delicious, and the perfect amount of spicy. 

I'm visiting from California, and whenever I'm in town I'll definitely be dropping by to try the rest of their menu. The food, staff, and decor makes his place an absolute go-to whenever I'm in the mood for a sandwich."}
{"text":"I had the nellie and a side salad and must say the nellie was GREAT. I also appreciate good customer service along with good food and this family owned shop nails it.....I suggest you stop in and give it a try I signed up for yelp just to post this review thats how good it is

ps the walnut cranberry cran-walnut bread.....where can i buy a loaf???"}
{"text":"Haven't ordered a sandwich from here in a while, so I put an order together on uber eats. I got the spicy stalker, and first thing I noticed is it didn't have the panini bread and didn't seem toasted at all. 

This place was a decent 12 dollar sandwich shop, because of their attention to detail, and every sandwich was unique and tasted that way. The sandwich I ordered was not the quality I was used to. At least tasted decent, but to top it all off, they were out of coleslaw and all I got with the sandwich was the ruffles. 

I'll keep my rating at 3 stars, and try picking up an order earlier in the day, to see if maybe that could make a difference."}
{"text":"So I've been coming here every now and then for over a year now, and I've always wondered why I haven't seen Scott Tupy for a while now. Turns out that he sold this business to a very nice and energetic Asian couple! They kept the name and the style of the place but changed around the menu quite a bit. Their service is very friendly, and the food came out quickly. 
I chatted with the new owners for quite a while and got to know them a bit. And to keep this update brief, I want to happily report that the quality is the same as Scott had it before he left. As always, my lunch was delicious and I'm always glad I came back.
It was very nice to meet you today, Clyde and Esther! I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"This place was okay. We ordered 2  sandwiches (one cold and one hot) and a salad and the order took aaaaaages. There was only one couple before us and they were already making their food when we arrived. In the end, It was good...but the wait time just killed it for me. My daughter's cuban sandwich was pretty delish, though. The portions were generous, especially on the salads. But it's not cheap."}
{"text":"I decided to go to this place after seeing so many great reviews. I was not disappointed at all. They have a great variety of hot and cold sandwiches, salads and wraps. They also offer soup during the \"cold\" months in Vegas. Each sandwich is made after ordering and can be \"customized\". 

Customer service is great. I'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"I got there right when it closed & all the food was put away. They were nice enough to serve me anyways. Prepping all their ingredients again so everything was fresh. I'm so glad they stayed open because the food was excellent! I got the Spicy Skylar & Zack Attack because I love Saved By The Bell. All came with delicious sides. The staff was really welcoming & friendly. They didn't try to rush me out since I was the last customer. Definitely coming back & telling all my friends Zack, Kelly, Slater, Jessie, Lisa & Screech to stop eating at The Max & go try out Tups because that's what's Ups! (That rhymed) GO BAYSIDE!"}
{"text":"Best sandwich panini and salads around town! Great local service yummy natural meats was completely satisfied and will be returning shortly!"}
{"text":"I stopped by the shop on my way home from work right before they were supposed to close. I walked in, half expecting to be rushed a little by the people working since I was walking in 5 minutes before close - Instead I was greeted with smiles and warm conversation. The owner is incredibly friendly and energetic and definitely keeps you engaged while you're waiting for your food.

I ordered a Chicken Parm Panini and a some sort of sinfully decadent brownie dessert to go. It took my about 10 minutes to get home, but the sandwich was still phenomenal - I can only imagine how amazing it would have been if I had eaten it there. The sandwich also came with a healthy helping of potato chips, a pickle and my choice of potato salad, macaroni salad, or coleslaw. I ordered the macaroni salad, which was both unique and delicious! And don't even let me get started on the brownie - wowza! Excellent food, family owned, friendly staff - definitely 5 stars without a second thought.

Definitely will be coming here often and I highly recommend it to anyone in the area!"}
{"text":"Excellent sandwiches and colorful characters. I'm back for the third time and still loving it! My favorite is the Nellie, named for the staff member who invented it (gotta have it on the cranberry nut bread). The turkey avocado is superb and the Mac n cheese panini is on my hit list. Such friendly folks and just awesome food! I love this place!!!!"}
{"text":"This place makes an excellent pastrami sandwich.  The meat to bread ratio is correct, the serving size is just enough and the marble rye was a nice understated player in the mix of flavors"}
{"text":"Tups for lunch today. Little tucked away specialty sandwich place on eastern and windmill. Had to come in and try the Mac Attack sandwich. With creamy Mac & cheese, bacon, honey ham, tomato, American and cheddar cheeses. So good! Very filling and so cheesy. Free pickle and chips with every order too."}
{"text":"Absolute gem of a spot and a great location too.

The owners are really friendly and obviously passionate about their food. I can't wait to go back and try more!

I was in the mood for a simple ham and cheese but didn't see it on the menu. I think they could see my baffled look on my face, asked me what I was looking for and then made me the best damn ham and cheese panini I've ever had. My friend had a mac n cheese sandwich which was good, but not as good as my custom job!

Really friendly service, reasonably priced, great location and amazing food!

I'll be back"}
{"text":"My new favorite sammich shop in town. Not sure how new it is, but it's really good!

I'll be honest, I've tried one sandwich here, the Chicken Parm, and I probably won't ever try anything else. It's that good. Generous portion of chicken, great sauce, cheese, and they even put fresh tomatoes which is a great compliment. You also get a pickle, which is really good. I did have one of their fresh chocolate chip cookies and that was delicious.

Family owned and operated which makes it even easier to support. This place isn't like chain sandwich joints where everything is likely packaged and processed, yuck. Everything is fresh and made to order.

Absolutely love this place!"}
{"text":"The wait for the food was long (it was 10 min before they even started making my sandwich, 20 min before I got it).  The seating was very cramped. The older gentleman making the food was extremely rude to the younger man running the cashier over very menial issues (ruining the environment).  The sandwich was good, but no food is good enough to make me come back."}
{"text":"Tups makes a great sandwich! I had the Turkey Avacado without the avacado and it was very tasty. The customer service was great - very friendly. The price was ok - about $12. I wished I could have chosen a different side - it's just plain ruffles. I was able to eat outside in the shade - the weather was nice that day. Overall, I'd recommend this sandwich shop and would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Gotta say I'm a bit disappointed today. I have ordered from this mom and pop deli several times as I live near by and have always had nothing but great service and delicious food.  I love supporting any local business. If I was writing this review any other time it would have been 5 stars, but had issues today. First off, the sandwiches always came with chips and either coleslaw or potato salad. I received neither. They said they changed their menu two months ago, but I had an order a month ago and still received it. If I was told no more chips, I would've gladly purchased them. They forgot to include my coleslaw or potato salad on my Jan chicken parm, although the sandwich was still amazing. My turkey avocado, I asked with no bacon, as I don't eat pork, well they included it so as much as I wanted to try it, I threw it out because of the bacon, and again missing the coleslaw or potato salad that comes with my meal. I have been a customer since they opened, hoping that this place isn't loosing its touch....."}
{"text":"Ordered via grub hub and it was a good meal for the office meeting. I had the spicy Hot Italian and it was great."}
{"text":"Solid food and really nice people, if it was not so far away from my house i'd go more often"}
{"text":"Closed at noon today?  Thanks for wasting 20 min of my lunch.  Not even a sign.  I'd think a place like this would thrive on lunch service, but you aren't going to do that when people don't show up to work.  Oh well. Someone else will get my money."}
{"text":"That Little Ruby, is fire!!!!!! Great  combination of spices and meat! The sweet peppers are great on this flavor giant of a sandwich. This is a great little spot to get Bespoke sandwiches and worth every penny!!!!!!!!! Great customer service!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great sandwich spot! Really enjoyed the Ryebread. The workers have great customer service. Would like different chip options besides just ruffles even cheese ruffles would be nice. Great tasting me very fresh will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Skylar sandwich was delicious.  I was a little hesitant with ghost peppers, but the sandwich is zesty and balanced where I can taste the food - not burn my mouth.  He nailed it with the balance because the spicy lingers on my tongue in a flavorful way."}
{"text":"$33.00 Double Decker Club Sandwich, Apple Pecan Salad

OMG pricey right? Yeah it was a little bit but that includes tip and delivery .. and their food is REAL food and REAL good so worth it. 

I did order the double decker club and it for sure was a huge sandwich but it wasn't cut in triangles therefore i think i might've got a different sandwich than what i ordered but regardless it was AWESOME :) i love TUPS food and for the convenience of being able to order via YELP, pay, tip and have someone knock on my door in 40 minutes with my food it's worth it. That salad was BOMB! Thank you Tups i heart u!"}
{"text":"It was just what we were looking for after a short flight from WA state. Thank you Tups for the fast, friendly and delicious services."}
{"text":"Can't ask for much more than this out of a sandwich joint. Really diverse menu of hot and cold sandwiches, plus salads and other items. Sandwiches come with chips and a pickle. I had the Mac Attack, which is delicious mac and cheese with even more cheese and bacon and ham! Sooooo good. Everyone working was very friendly and helpful. I'll be back again and again."}
{"text":"I read some reviews on this little shop and thought I would give it a try. Very pleasantly surprised. Promptly greeted upon arrival and given plenty of time to review the menu and decide on my sandwich choice. 

Amazing sandwich. Excellent service All adds up to a loyal and frequent returning customer."}
{"text":"I love good sandwiches!  Since it was my first time going to Tups I invited two friends to join me.  We are all foodies and fellow sandwich lovers so we saddled up and headed a couple of blocks west.  We. arrived just before the lunch rush so we started taking to the staff one of who was a partner in the shop.  They're a new business and they went out of their way to make our sandwiches awesome.  They didn't have a breakfast sandwich on the menu but we're still able to make exactly what I was looking for.  I think they're off to a great start and with a little time might become a neighborhood favorite.  

I recommend everyone giving this new business a try.  It's a great way to get out of the house and support your local community.  

PS: You meet yo nicest people in sandwich shops. 
While we where there another neighbor came by and the conversations start flowing.  Good times with good people."}
{"text":"We ordered from here on a whim because most places were closed the day after thanksgiving and we will NEVER order from here again! I wish there was a return policy because the food was that bad!!"}
{"text":"My coworkers and I finally tried this place out ! Our new go to spot and they are right next to our plaza ! Met the owner a couple of times and she was very nice. Dropped off a menu to our shop this morning and thought we'd give it a try. The food was so fresh and good ! I had the turkey avo panini. Amazing and so fresh. The panini also came with a pickle chips and a cup of slaw for 8.99."}
{"text":"Awesome, family owned sandwich shop! Immediately greeted with a smile. When I asked what was good the lady behind the counter suggested a pesto chicken! Had a friendly conversation while I waited with employees! Took the sandwich home and it was everything I could want out of a pesto chicken wrap!! Delicious!! Thanks Tups!"}
{"text":"What does \"Tups\" mean? Is it a nickname, inside joke or the secret ingredient in their Giardiniera recipe? 

Tups is located in a funky shopping center, which by the way Google maps will point you in the wrong direction if you're heading east on Windmill, just a heads up. 

This small family owned deli only has only a few seats inside to sit and enjoy your lunch, so if you plan on dining-in watch out for those busy feasting hours. They offer the basic deli menu items; soups, salads, sandwiches, coffee and espresso. I ordered the half roast beef sandwich and The Greek Village salad. When I ordered my sandwich I was asked if I want everything on it, I said yes to this, just no onions and mayo. When posed with a question like that you assume your meal will be stacked with plenty of veggies, cheese and maybe an in-house tapenade, nope. I basically got two slices of roast beef, a tomato and some wilted lettuce, it' s like my 6-year-old niece made lunch for me. Believe it or not the Greek salad saved the day. 

The Greek Village salad was about $10, but this thing could easily feed a small  of Mediterranean food lovers. It comes filled to the brim with romaine, tomato, cucumber, red onion, green pepper, feta cheese & kalamata olives dressed with olive oil, oregano and parsley vinaigrette and served with three pieces of soft Pita bread. This alone was enough to feed me for lunch and as a side salad during dinner. Totally worth the price tag. 

The customer service here is well above most snacking spots from beginning to end, which is more than I can say for most of the 5 star dining spots in the Valley. I'm not fully sold on this place as a solid go-to sandwich location, but that could change with my next visit."}
{"text":"Tups is a specialty sandwich shop located on Windmill and Eastern in the Smith's shopping center near Go Raw Cafe. Walking in, it's a bit small, so don't come here as a party of 8 people, you'll take up all the tables lol Everyone was smiling and welcomed us in, and we were offered their paper menu so we wouldn't have to strain looking up at their sandwich menu. Man this place has an incredible amount of options. I counted 8 Salads, 12 Sandwiches, and 11 Panini's! Everything is also priced around $5.99-$10.99 as well! Awesome! 

Mac & Cheese Panini $7.99- This is the one that grabbed my attention first so I went with this! Mac & Cheese with bacon, tomato, and provolone all warmed between two toasty pieces of bread! Soo gooey and tasty and was the perfect sandwich if you're craving comfort food. The portion was also really great sized so I took the other half home with me.

The Spicy Skyler $9.99- This is what my boyfriend ordered and comes with salami, pepperoni, mortadella, capicola, fire roasted ham, ghost pepper & provolone provolone cheese, roasted peppers and hot giardiniera spread. They told us they would put the giardiniera spread on the side since we've never tried it so we could adjust the heat on our own. This was also soo tasty! Like a Meatlover's Pizza!

All sandwiches also come with their homemade macaroni salad (super slaw) and normally I don't really care for potato salad or macaroni salad but theirs was soo good! It was somehow very fresh yet being rich without any kind of mayonnaise flavor, super good!

 My boyfriend has also come back many times to get The Spicy Skyler after our first visit. Can't wait for my next visit! I'll probably try their Pastrami Reuben Panini next time :)"}
{"text":"Wow! What can I say bad about this place but NO! The food here is great! Along with that the most nice people you ever going to meet! I will be going back here again, thanks guys the food was great!!"}
{"text":"ordered here for the first time today, it was fantastic! We got the turkey avocado sandwich and I got the turkey Panini. We each split the apple walnut salad; food was excellent, driver was awesome we couldn't be happier. Thank you !"}
{"text":"Heard so many good things about this place. Believe me, I was looking forward to loving it. But...it was only ok. Maybe 2.5 stars but definitely not 3 star.  Maybe it's because I've lived in NY, Austin, and SF--all places with great sandwich shops--I expect a lot from a \"great sandwich\"? or because because people rave about it?   Maybe everyone who loves it iss right--and tonight was an off night? Turkey avocado sandwich for $10 had chinzy amount of turkey coldcut (not actual turkey, which I expected given how much people love this place), there was a little more turkey on one side but the other had only 1 thin slice of turkey that didn't even reach the side of the bread. Avocado? literally zero--as in zilch--avocado. And the man did not even tell me they were out. Disappointing. The sandwich was dry a bone--toasted bread was too big, and hardly any mayo, only a few pieces of cucumber, and a few crumbles of bacon. The chocolate chip cookie was tiny but very good/homemade. If other people are into it, that's great, but from what I experienced I'm sorry to say it was a real letdown."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness ! Can I say .... delicious!!!! Yelped a sandwich spot and I was lead  to this place. I'm simply so happy . I'm a sandwich lover as is , but this spot has it all . Whatever your craving . Fresh and tasty ! The guy here was super friendly and nice ! Suggested the little ruby ! It's amazing !"}
{"text":"I really like this place it's fresh and really good, iI'm definitely going back more. Loved it"}
{"text":"Just got a grilled cheese & it came with tortilla chips.  Weird.  Please go back to the regular potato chips."}
{"text":"Small very friendly courteous family run business offering fresh sandwiches, paninis and salads. We ordered the Classic Roast Beef ($11.00) which was roast beef on marble rye bread with horseradish sauce, tomato, lettuce, red onion, american cheese and pickled veggies. Sandwich came with pickle and chips. Was and tasted homemade and was really really good! The iced coffee was excellent too. Clearly fresh food. Much better than any generic boring plastic tasting sub chains throughout the area. I look forward to trying more from their menu.
FYI: The reviews showing pictures of soup, potato salad and macaroni salad are old reviews and they no longer offer these items, I wish they did though."}
{"text":"Wanted to update everyone. 

We went here every day for 5 days straight, about 10 times in 2 weeks and I went twice in one day multiple times. I told many people about it and brought 5-6 people with me a couple of times. If you dont get their CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES you are missing out on something magical haha!!!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered for delivery a sandwich to work since we get so busy at times we are unable to leave for lunch. I ordered a sandwich with no cheese and when I had received the sandwich it had a cream cheese spread and was missing the bacon.  After calling them back to explain I was missing the bacon and there was cream cheese on the sandwich that I had not ordered. They willingly asked me what I wanted them to do and I felt bad making them drive back to give me another sandwich but his response was \" whatever you want us to do I will do, because our goal is to make the customer happy.\" I will order again from this shop just for that reason alone. Very pleased with not only the way my sandwich turned out but the excellent customer service."}
{"text":"I'm typically not a sandwich person, but they have a list of specialty paninis that are unique and sound delicious!  

Tups is located on the southwest corner of Eastern and Windmill.  It's an easy find.  Very small sandwich shop, but clean and modern looking.  Staff was very friendly, and I enjoyed their enthusiastic personality when I had questions regarding their menu.  They all were very excited and happy to explain the menu for you!

I was debating between the Spicy Skylar and the Mac N Cheese panini, but I ended up settling for the Mac N Cheese panini.  The Mac N Cheese panini was a great choice, but I'm sure either way, I'm pretty sure I would've been happy with one or the other.  

Mac N Cheese panini only took about 10 mins to make.  Includes bacon on the inside as well.  Very hot when it was served.  It was easy to eat, and the flavor tasted like homemade mac n cheese with some bacon to make it better.  Comes with coleslaw and pickle.  I could only eat half since the portion was large, so I took the rest to go (and I'm not normally one to eat leftovers, but it was so delicious).

Next time, I would love to try the Spicy Skylar!"}
{"text":"Love this place ! I go to the massage school nearby and come here almkst everyday for lunch. Great menu and amazing staff. My favorite is their homemade mac n cheese panini !"}
{"text":"I am in love with this place! I wanted to try a couple of items before I did a review and I am glad I did. You will not be disappointed if you come here. Keep up the great work!!"}
{"text":"Food is 5 stars!! Location needs to be upgraded. You cannot find anywhere to sit during the lunch rush. Everyone that works there is very friendly and outgoing. Love the spicy skyler!"}
{"text":"I don't really know what to say other than WOW!....

The sandwiches here are REAL, everything is delicious and fresh and just darn good.

Seriously you will not be disappointed. I waivered on trying this place several times and my only regret now is that I wasted my time ordering subs that are more expensive elsewhere.

#TUPS4LYFE"}
{"text":"Small mom and pop type shop! I got the turkey avocado sandwich and when they asked me for a side I said no thanks. They said it was free but I said I was dieting so one of the people asked if I wanted fresh strawberries cut up as my side instead! Great customer service! My boyfriend got the roast beef and the first thing out of his mouth was \"oh yeah\". Coming back again definitely!"}
{"text":"Yelp guided me here one afternoon during lunchtime. It's a small shop inside of a strip mall with minimal seating.  It's family owned and operated, and they couldn't have been more nice!  They made suggestions, and were patient as I took my time making a decision.  I settled on the roast beef panini and my mom had the Reuben.  It was all very good.  Sandwiches are served with chips and a pickle.  There is a selection of canned soda or Snapple for beverage choices.  

The only issue I had was with the restroom.  It had a terrible sewer smell and someone had clogged the toilet.  So, it wasn't greatly maintained.  

All in all, my experience was A-OK.  If I am back in this neighborhood, I would frequent this place again!"}
{"text":"I have been looking for a sandwich shop ever since i moved to Vegas, and I have seemed to have found one.  Tups is fantastic family owned  shop.  The owner is a very kind person, who is open to hear how his sandwiches are.  I went in with my sister and we got a Ruben and the Nellie.  Everything tasted fresh. the bread was so crisp and perfectly toasted.  The combination of the turkey, bacon, vegetables, and cranberries was a very unique blend. It was a beautiful sandwich.  the employees were also really nice, and joked with us as well.  I will definitely come back anytime I need a grand sandwich in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"An accurate depiction of a hidden gem. Tups is a small corner sandwich shop in a shopping center on Windmill and Eastern. 

Came here with a friend for lunch earlier and we were both very impressed! The menu held a great variety but wasn't overwhelming at all. We ordered The Ruby and The Masaerati Pastrami both of which were delightful. The sandwiches were filled with flavor and I couldn't think of a single ingredient that could make either of the two better. 

The restaurant itself is very small with about 5 two-top tables for dine in. There was one person working- taking orders and making the sandwiches; he was kind, worked quickly, and provided great suggestions. 

Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Occasionally stopped at this local sandwich shop and got pleased with their service. Great sandwich and just the best coleslaw Ive tried so far. Everything fresh cut, nicely arranged and zesty taste!!! Much success to you guys!"}
{"text":"Love their sandwiches!!!! Can't wait to go back. Great, small, family-run business that I look forward to supporting."}
{"text":"The roast beef panini was pretty good and the macaroni salad was pretty good too. I could say the roast beef was pretty tender, but slightly plain, which masked its flavor relative to the panini bread. The people were very friendly and they are definitely not a chain sandwich shop. I plan on going back again. Oh, and their fresh baked chocolate chip cookies are awesome!"}
{"text":"Janelle and her team are amazing. I order lunch from here all the time. It's fresh with lots of options!!

They just catered lunch for 20 people for my office and I can't wait to use them again.

You must try their Italian sandwich!!"}
{"text":"I am changing my previous review. After a huge misunderstanding, Janell called me today and offered a sandwich for free to come in and try. (We had previously had a miscommunication over the phone with another staff member.) The sandwiches were delicious and I appreciate the wonderful customer service. Also, I very much appreciate them taking the time to rectify the situation. We live right around the corner and will be visiting regularly!  The Cole slaw was great and the portions were a good size for lunch or dinner. If you haven't had a sandwich from here you need to come in!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to try this place since it was rated 5 stars. Little did I know how disappointed I would be. The service was awful. The cashier had no idea what she was doing and worked at the pace of a snail. She swiped my debit card numerous times not knowing that the order had already been approved and the receipt had already printed out (I will be checking my bank account when I get back). I ordered the hot ham and swiss on marble rye bread. Easy right? Wrong. When my sandwich was ready, it was cold. I ordered a HOT ham and swiss. They took it back and threw it on their panini grill. 

When I got the sandwich back, I found a piece of someone's hair in one half. When I tried a bite of the other half, I found it lacked flavor and pizzazz. I was hoping for a more. Unfortunately we are spoiled in Las Vegas and have other places I would rather spend my money at with better quality food. 

I would not recommend this place for lunch ... What a let down."}
{"text":"Tups is awesome. Family-owned and run, excellent food with very fresh ingredients, friendly staff, nice little sandwich shop feeling. They have been so great every time I've been there (7 or 8 times so far). Wouldn't even dream of going to the other sandwich places in the neighborhood. They even named a veggie sandwich after me (I got to create it myself), apparently it's gotten very popular, just ask for the \"Tom\" (its not listed on the board yet). Just to warn you though, it isn't a huge place and there's only so many places to sit. So don't go right at lunchtime if you expect to find a place to sit. Its much better to go when its not as busy anyway so you can sit and relax and just enjoy one of the best sandwich places I've come across in town."}
{"text":"Out running errands and was looking for lunch. Almost pulled in to Jack in the Box when we spied the sign for Tups in the strip mall behind. We both prefer local owned small places as a rule so gave it a go. Great selection for all tastes and friendly service. I ordered the Zack Attack sandwich and husband  had the Italian Sub. Small side of macaroni salad plus a nice sized portion of fresh potato chips accompanied our sandwiches. Sandwiches were fresh and plenty of main meats were on board. Definitely recommend for an easy tasty lunch."}
{"text":"My wife, son and I love a good sandwich shop and Tups fits the bill. Every time we walk through the door we are greeted with a smile and a lollipop for my son. The food is top notch and you can tell they use quality ingredients. Coming from a family of small business owners I understand the importance of customer service and a quality product to develop customer loyalty. Tups provides all this and more!!!!  Check them out."}
{"text":"I drove by on my way to the bank and had to come back, I was intrigued!!  Glad I did!!  From the moment I walked in I felt welcome, such amazing customer service.  I ordered the Egg Salad and it was delicious.  I am SUPER picky and this was one of the best Egg Salad sandwiches I have had.  I will for sure be back and refer everyone I know.  Keep up the great work."}
{"text":"A little local hole in the wall. Great atmosphere and attitudes from the peeps that work there. Food was awesome and I asked them for a recommendation and got the perfect match to what I was feeling. I definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Tups is a local sandwich shop that got new owners around March of 2016. I stopped in to check them out after checking on Yelp and I was so pleasantly surprised.

Quick note! They have a happy hour from 3-5 pm everyday which includes free chips and a drink. Awesome deal! 

They have cold sandwiches, salads, and paninis. The sandwiches and salads can all be made into a wrap as well. Prices start around $9-$12 per item. 

Today I shared a Zack Attack (cold sandwich), the Mac and cheese grilled cheese panini, and a Greek salad. This came out to about $30 and some change. There was so much food that we took home half of everything. Their menu is huge and unique and I had a hard time choosing. They have over 20 sandwich choices.

The food was really good. It was fresh, flavorful, and unique. It's like a sandwich shop with their own unique twist on everything. I thought the price point was just a smidgen high, but after tasting the food, talking to the staff, and wanting to go back I thought it was great and well price pointed ESPECIALLY if you go during happy hour. You could get a drink, entree, and chips for about $10. I do recommend both of these sandwiches. The grilled Mac and cheese sandwich had bacon and tomato and was delicious.

I gave the place a solid 5 because of the interaction with the staff and the quality they are putting out. One of the employees heard the ice machine wasn't producing more ice so they offered to get me ice before I said anything. It's a family owned place without the hole in the wall feel even down to their take out boxes and I just dug it."}
{"text":"I liked it even more than I thought I would!
Cute place, right down the street from me, with an excellent menu.
We had a more traditional roast beef, the chicken caprese sandwich, and a kid's grilled cheese. The cashier was super friendly and offered to make the kid's GC even though it wasn't on the menu AND agreed to do a side of mac & cheese, even though that wasn't a menu option either. Will definitely be back for lunch and so happy they're open for dinner now, too!

I only wish there was more/better seating. The only thing inside is a couple high-tops."}
{"text":"Haven't been able to stay away from this place. Their turkey panini is amazing. Great service. Better food."}
{"text":"Delicious sandwiches and excellent service! All the flavors of the avocado turkey sandwich and gobbler were amazing, would definitely return."}
{"text":"I work close to the restaurant and a very nice get away from the work lunchroom, however I'm telling you if the Sammy's weren't good ... I wouldn't patronize. The food is solid and the side salads are a great addition to a over all fine lunch.
Keep it up Tup !!!"}
{"text":"What an awesome break! Excellent BLT w avocado! Worth going out of your way for. Awesome eats at reasonable local's prices."}
{"text":"Great spot! I went for the first time today and got the roast beef panini sandwich and it was perfect. They are fast (10min), friendly, and everything was fresh. The prices are fair and the quality of the ingredients were great."}
{"text":"Very East Coast-style sandwich shop. Not much seating but quick service for a busy Saturday afternoon. 

The quality of sandwich ingredients were a bit of a letdown for the reputation of this place and the amount of meat for $10-11 average price was poorly adequate. A sample of the three-mustard egg salad was worth it because it was not good. A little similar to egg salad on a poor buffet with no hint of mustard, nevermind 3 mustard at all. Very dry in texture, if that makes sense. 

Classic roast beef definitely used old/poor roast beef that was not rare and sported that iridescent sheen/fish scale-looking film. Maybe that's why there was a special offering a free iced latte with the classic roast beef? For a sandwich shop, this is kind of unacceptable to have crappy roast beef. Hot pastrami sandwich was good albeit a little fatty in quality. The breads they use are fresh and tasty but when a sandwich uses thick-sliced bread and only has a 1/2\" layer of meat in between, you are eating mostly bread. The veggies on the sandwiches are fresh and good; tomatoes a bit cheap in quality. Another letdown when you have a few vegetarian sandwiches on your menu. Pickle spears are excellent! The best part of the lunch was the triple chocolate cookie. 

Overall, I would give a second trip/chance to Tups and order other items."}
{"text":"Excellent variety of sandwiches made with a personal, creative, thoughtful touch and what tastes like good quality ingredients. Wonderfully personable family ownership. A good last mintute find."}
{"text":"I love sandwiches! I love local businesses! I love places close to my house! So for me Tups hits all the right criteria I need it too for a lunch spot. Friendly staff and some interesting sandwiches, like the Mac and Cheese Sandwich I can't wait to try.

My only gripe is that I wish it was a tad cheaper. I ordered the Turkey Avocado and my fiancé had the Italian sub, one bag of chips and one Pelligrino italian soda (that they forgot to place in our bag.. boo) and our order was $25.12 before tip. The sandwiches were really tasty and loaded up with all the trimmings, I just felt a little silly paying almost 30 bucks for a sandwich based lunch, to go. 

Even though the price was a tad too high for my personal liking I will be back to try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"This new place just opened and it is absolutely delicious. Met the owners, talked with the cooks and even the dishwasher about how amazing the food was. I ordered the ham and cheese panini and it came with some optional greens, chips and slaw. The cold slaw was delicious. And my mother ordered the caprese panini and it she loved it. We will definitely be coming back. We had a good experience here and it just brings a small mom and pop type feeling in the atmosphere while you eat."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing sandwiches. This place is unassuming because of the location. Hidden away in the back of the plaza next to a smoke shop is not where you expect to find the best sandwich you'll ever eat. Not only is the food incredible, but it seems to be a family operated business and everyone working there is SO nice and helpful! For less money than you would spend on fast food, I definitely recommend checking out this hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Excellent Reuben sandwich made with high quality ingredients. Great atmosphere. Potato salad could use a little seasoning. Will go again and definitely recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"I like this place. I like that I can walk here from work. I like that I can order online for pick up or delivery. I like that their prices are pretty decent.

I'm a fan of their sandwiches-- in particular the turkey avocado and the roast beef panini. They have their specials on a chalkboard outside the door or on their website so make sure to check those out before you make a decision.

It's quick, convenient, and pretty delicious."}
{"text":"Very good sandwich. I don't think I would drive across town for it, but I will probably start coming here instead of capriottis when I'm in this area. The dining area is teensy, so you might have to take it to go or eat outside. My sandwich was stuffed with meat, and everything was nicely flavored."}
{"text":"This is a great sandwich shop. Very fresh ingredients, fast friendly service at a reasonable price. I just wish my clothes wouldn't smell for the rest of the day every time I eat there."}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting much from this tiny little shop, however the grilled Tuna melt I had was outstanding.  The Tuna here is pretty heavy on the citrus and dill side so please be aware of that.  The staff will gladly give you samples before you order. The bread had nice grill marks and was crisp and delicious.  They have a pretty decent selection of sandwiches hot and cold and prices are reasonable.  For around $8.50 I had a nice sized sandwich, macaroni salad, and a delicious pickle.  I'll be visiting this place again for sure!

Edit: I'd also like to add that the staff here is seriously TOP NOTCH! Super attentive, great with suggestions & descriptions."}
{"text":"We visited this petite, family owned restaurant on our last trip and plan on returning as long as they will keep having us.  This time we shared a turkey avocado sandwich (sliced turkey on toasted whole grain wheat bread with avocado, mayo, tomato, bacon, cucumber, red onion, green leaf lettuce and micro greens) that included pickle and coleslaw.  Fresh, flavorful ingredients along with personal service appear to be the hallmark of this restaurant's offerings."}
{"text":"My first time and my first bite of hot pastrami Reuben was so delicious.  My children love this place when craving for sandwiches.  TUPS is now my vocabulary."}
{"text":"Been here 2 days in a row now. First day had the turkey avocado and was very good and fresh! Love the macaroni salad! Husband got the cole slaw and said macaroni salad was better. Second day had the southwestern salad and was filling not amazing but good. Husband had the spicy skyler and he said it tasted almost like pizza! Deff check this place out if your in the area!"}
{"text":"Call the asylum cause this place is certifiably, clinically DANKIES! Seriously tho, I might need a doctor because I'm about to die and go to heaven after eating the mac n cheese panini (thank the Lord I also have this bomb-a latte to give me strength).

Go here. The people are so kind, the food is amazing, and they play \"Since U Been Gone\" by Kelly Clarkson while you eat. 10/10 would smash  (that panini)."}
{"text":"Food was very delicious and the people are very nice and gave a warm welcome!!! I had the Turkey Avocado and my wife had the Caprese Panini and both were amazing. The coleslaw was also very good. The place is small but the food is bomb. Wish we lived closer!"}
{"text":"Great service-very friendly!  Ordered the Spicy Skyler and a build your own turkey on marble rye.  Everything was delish-just one small comment-the rye bread was a little dry-like it had been sitting out all day...but it still tastes great and we will definitely go back for more!"}
{"text":"If your are tired of eating at those famous sandwich shop food chains then your definitely need to come and check this place out. I love a good o'l turkey club Sammich. And I lucked out cause they have it and had great reviews on their sandwiches. I had the turkey avocado club and it was delicious. My only complaint would be my other half of the sandwich didn't get any avocados. I will comeback if I'm in the area again and hopefully i can try their salads and other specialty sandwiches oh FYI this place is not cheap spend about $11 for my meal. This is why I can't give them a 5 cause for that amount of money I deserve a whole avocado."}
{"text":"We have been getting sandwiches from here since they opened.  I got hooked on the \"Nellie\" but they all seemed to be good.  I'm a little worried though since lately they have been making mistakes on our orders and sometimes the sandwiches just aren't as thick as they once were.  I got over the change to \"no potato chips\" but the latest trends are concerning.  There are some different people making the sandwiches these days so maybe additional training will cure the problem.  Hope they can remain the best!"}
{"text":"so I was feeling adventurous and saw this sandwich shop with all 5 stars so I thought I would check it out. I was not dissapointed! I can truly call this a gourmet sandwich shop. I ordered 2 different sandwiches that completely satisfied my taste buds. very nice owner. just wants to make his customers happy"}
{"text":"I was out running errands and had heard of this place on Eater Vegas, so I decided to stop in and try it. Its a quaint little family sandwich shop with some classic deli sandwiches. had the Corned beef on Marble rye with thousand Island dressing and coleslaw. This is one of the best Corned beef sandwiches I have had in Las Vegas. I was enjoying how friendly and attentive the staff was. The son is in high school and works here after school, so he can one day be a cook or chef. Pretty cool deal. The sandwich....Meat was tender and flavorful with a perfect topping of coleslaw that had that perfect bitter bite I prefer. I also had a side of Mac Salad that had a pinch of cinnamon on it that gave it an interesting flavor. I may try this myself one day. And a pickle no sandwich complete without one on the side.

I can't wait to go back with Josie and have her try a few things. This to me is a dine in just because of the hot sandwiches you would want to eat them hot off the grill. They have cold sandwiches as well and I look forward to trying them all. It is my goal this year and forever more to try and support more family local establishments food or otherwise. 

Give this place a try its conveniently located and tucked behind some fast food joints off of windmill and eastern. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"It was just okay. I had the pastrami on marble rye. Meh. 
The macaroni salad has cinnamon in it which is weird and not great."}
{"text":"Took a little while for my panini to be ready, but i was very happy to wait for this one. I had the turkey panini, with avocado - it was delicious and crispy. Also the simple side of macaroni salad was good, nothing too fancy. Overall solid sandwich place, price is ok. Overall 4/5"}
{"text":"Great little mom and pop sandwich shop.  I had the turkey panini, wife had the rueben.  Owner was very nice and offered up samples and free dessert.  The sandwiches were awesome.  The turkey panini was literally to die for.  Will be going back again."}
{"text":"Our favorite sandwich place ever, I've never had a bad meal here. The macaroni salad is so special, and the turkey panini is beyond amazing. I wish they were open on Sundays"}
{"text":"Tups is located in the Smith's shopping center on Windmill and Eastern.   

Under new owners, the menu is still pretty similar.  We ordered 2 hot sandwiches.  The spicy skylar and the little ruby.   Both sandwiches were served with chips and a pickle.  

4 stars for freshness.  The sandwich did take a bit of time to make, so call ahead if your not into waiting.  

3 stars for taste.  Both sandwiches were ok.  Nothing blew my socks off, but it wasn't terrible either.   

I felt they were both a bit heavy.   Just my personal opinion.   I definitely see why ppl love the sandwiches here, just not my style."}
{"text":"Very satisfying little place. Everything is neat and delicious. Their coleslaw is probably the most unique and flavorful coleslaw one could get around town. My personal favorite is their hot pastrami on rye and their tuna sandwich. And to top it off, they have a refreshing yoghurt parfait. Definitely recommend it for lunch!"}
{"text":"Ok.  My wife and I use Yelp all the time but we've never written one before but I had to this time.  My wife and kids and I were visiting our family in Vegas and we wanted something not too expensive but not fast food and processed.  Looked at the reviews and gave it a shot.  It was amazing!  It was the best panini I ever had and the Greek salad was fresh and HUGE.  The two ladies there (I think it was a mother daughter team) were so welcoming and friendly.  We are texting our family to try it.  If you go there you will NOT be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I love this place! First, every person who works there is so kind and so helpful (shout-out to Nikki and Mary!). Second (which should also be first), it is so delicious. A co-worker and I had lunch from there first. I had the Zack Attack - AMAZING. She had a salad that was so big she was able to save the rest for another whole meal. 

Then I tried their catering and delivery service for a small meeting I was hosting for 10 people. They were so accommodating. All I had to say was my budget, the number of people, and the salads/sandwiches I was interested in getting, and they made it happen like magic. They included plenty of side items too (macaroni salad, cole slaw, and pickles). We had the classic beef, turkey avocado (no bacon), the vegetarian sandwich, and the greek salad. It was PLENTY of food, we had left overs for the office to have for lunch the next day. Mary called me with plenty of time before the delivery was scheduled for to let me know she had all the utensils and napkins, but no plates. She said if I needed them, she would pick some up before the delivery. I didn't need her too, but thought this was so nice of her to offer and to really think of everything. 

I am so curious as to know where they get their bread from, it is so good. I will 100% be eating there/ordering there again. They are a great, family-owned and operated place that we need so desperately in this area."}
{"text":"Excellent sandwich excellent service. I had the spicy Skylar Panini with extra ghost pepper cheese. It was spicy, but you cannot really judge that by me , because I like things that are stupid hot, and this was not stupid hot lol but it was very very good, and the owners are awesome. Definitely give it a try and you will come back for sure."}
{"text":"Small sandwich shop. I had the turkey panini and it was very good. Came here due to other yelp reviews and was not disappointed. After eating at the strip this was a nice change."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place out since it's near my work.. 

If you like simple made sandwiches and paninis then this place got you covered..

i had the chicken Parmesan panini.. and like i said.. very simple.. it came with some chips and a piece of sliced pickle.. 

a little over-priced for a simple sandwich / panini / salad.. 

the guy working there didn't seem like he wanted to be there.. (maybe having a bad day).. but did check on us to see how the sandwich was.. 

overall.. not bad.. bread was a little hard and chewy.. chicken was good.. 

probably come back and try something else"}
{"text":"Super excited to try this place...great reviews made me have to check this place out. Living close by is a plus.  When I checked in, the owner gave my a free chocolate chip cookie, just baked, for checking in!!"}
{"text":"All I can say is OMG. Wow, absolutely delicious, fresh, made to order food. Super friendly and fast service, I am so impressed. I found a new favorite sandwich shop. And it's right next to my hair dresser!! Amazing!!! Large menus, definitely something for everyone!"}
{"text":"The mac & cheese panini from here showed up as a featured item on Yelp. Little did I know, this place is literally within walking distance of my house! I decided to give it a try and stopped by to grab that delicious looking mac & cheese panini. 
The place is very small and has about 2 or 3 tables if you want to eat there. It's your standard small sandwich shop, very similar to what you can find in New York. 
The panini was so good! The mac & cheese alone was amazing so when you mix that with fresh tomato and crispy bacon it is absolute perfection. You can choose a side of macaroni salad or cole slaw. I chose macaroni salad and wasn't very impressed with it. I think they add cinnamon to it which made it taste really weird.  It also came with a pickle that tasted like it wasn't pickled long enough. I've never had a pickle that tasted half like a pickle and half like a cucumber. This is why I gave them 4 stars instead of 5. I will definitely be back to try more!"}
{"text":"My fiancé found this little gem online so we decided to stop by for lunch. Neither of us were prepared for the quality of food we were about to eat. I had their Primo Sandwich and it was amazing. Portion sizes were huge, all the ingredients were fresh, the employees were super friendly and our overall experience was amazing! I would definitely come back here, still so many items on the menu I need to try!"}
{"text":"Panini can go one way or the other. AMAZING or just WHATEVER. There's a lot of mediocre paninis out there, and a part of me may have given up a bit. Gotta try the TUPS when I'm in the area, right?

The SPICY SKYLAR is THE ULTIMATE for those who love a kick and spicy foods. It was so amazingly delicious, I quickly regretted swapping my half with her grilled cheese panini with bell peppers. It was NOT even a comparison to have a sandwich full of flavor from the meats, to the mayo and butter on the bread, and the extra kick, followed by this super SIMPLE (kinda bland after eating something so flavorful) grilled cheese sandwich. Now, I'm not knocking it out. If I've never had a car, I'd be content with a civic. But if I've test driven a BMW, the Civic is gonna be plain. 

This sandwich was in fact so good that I wanted to come back the next day to eat it one more time. It is VERY filling, and half is enough. 

MY AWARD TO BEST PANINI OF MY LIFE goes to TUPS. I would love to come back and try their tuna sandwich and the melts. MMM MM GOOOOOOOD."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp even though I am in the parking lot all the time going to Smith's Food. Food was great, service helpful (explaining menu items), clean deli and bathrooms too.
My husband had the  Zack Attack: A fresh roll with turkey, salami, cappicola, provolone cheese, tomato, red onion & lettuce with dijon mustard & avocado mayo. 
I had the \"Build your own\".. Both were fantastic and full of flavor."}
{"text":"It's really unsettling that a BLT took 1 hour to be prepared and delivered to Jackpot Joanies (we are 2 doors down from their establishment). We didn't even want it toasted! When I called an hour after ordering to see where our sandwich was, Tyler told me \"I completely forgot\" and laughed. I honestly can not recommend this place to any of our customers anymore!! Then, we were still charged full price! Laughable!"}
{"text":"Great sandwich shop! The bread is tasty and not a boat load of grease like other panini places. Friendly staff and fresh tasting ingredients."}
{"text":"A little on the expensive side, but completely satisfying. The crispy panini bread alone is worth coming back over and over again. They make sure that your order is delicious and filling. Comes with chips, a side and a pickle. Go here if you're looking for the ultimate sandwich."}
{"text":"Great subs. Good bread makes all the difference. Sandwiches were huge - we both saved our other halves for dinner. We had the Spicy Skyler and Italian Stallion. Will definitely be back."}
