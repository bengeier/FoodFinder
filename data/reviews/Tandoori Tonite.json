{"text":"I ate a small meal, and was by myself, so my experience is limited, but I can say the tandoori fish I had was excellent-- good quality and cooked to perfection! So if I closed my eyes, this would be 5-stars. But the place suffers from rather dreary decor and feels a bit shabby, so that would make take-out a better choice. However, even then, the presentation of the food is a little bland-- the side salad was just a lifeless mix of a few greens."}
{"text":"This little joint is now under new management. But the quality and the deliciousness of the food can not be compared to any restaurant in and around the area. I have been there 3 times now and will continue to go and every time I go I try different item from the menu and I have Zero complain. Very friendly family runs the business and always fresh food. They have the best tandoori and naan I have ever had and when it comes to the price, it talks about itself!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, delicious ,, teekha chatpata as all Delhi foodies like !!!! Chicken takatak and mutton karahi were delicious.. courteous staff.. must visit for all food lovers who likes spicy food!!!"}
{"text":"Sometimes it's amazing to find out about a hidden gem that not even Yelpers really knows about (yet). On the heels of an article published on the CBC's website on January 25th by Suresh Doss, we made our way to an industrial plaza in Brampton in search of acclaimed naan and Butter Chicken.

It's a difficult spot to find, as it's tucked away along the side of the plaza, nearly entirely obscured from street view, but driving around the plaza will help you to find it if lost. The plaza is located on the East side of Hwy 10/Main Street/Hurontario, south of Sandalwood Parkway and north of DT Brampton.

As others have mentioned, it's not a fancy spot, but excellent for takeaway and some limited seating dining in. But if there's one thing we've all learned over the years it's that fancy looking and good food don't necessarily go hand in hand. Sometimes it's the businesses that might be less appealing at first glance that are the true diamonds in the rough.

We ordered naan and a butter chicken to share and were invited to have a seat and wait and once ready (they make everything to order) they would bring it out to us. While we waited, I would say nearly a dozen people also staggered in exclaiming that the CBC article had lead them here - so kudos to Suresh and his article for helping to put this place with a great story and great business owners on the map!

The food came out and it didn't disappoint. Perfectly cooked garlic flavoured naan, light and fluffy inside (perfect for holding/mopping up the sauce) and a little crisp on the outside from the tandoor. The butter chicken truly was fantastic, a rich velvety sauce, perfectly seasoned, with a fair amount of chicken. I say fair because it's not the least amount of chicken I've received when ordering this dish but there was far more sauce than meat, and I would have liked to have seen a little more. But then again for the price, you might as well just order a second helping (so cheap!).

Overall an excellent find, and thrilled that I went and I definitely will come back again!

Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"Never disappointed... we've eaten here many times, both eat in & takeaway. It isn't fancy (think Indian greasy spoon) but the food is exceptional. The beef keema naan just might be the best thing I've ever eaten, the butter chicken lives up to the hype, the tikka masala sublime, the garlic naan brilliant.  Even the plain white rice benefits from their scrupulous attention to detail. 

I cannot over-state how good this place is... if you want the very best Indian food Brampton has to offer, and there are a lot in Indian restaurants in Brampton, Tandoori Tonite has to be on your radar."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. I don't write too many reviews but I am taking the time to do so. Please try this place. Only ordered three items from here but each one absolutely amazing. The tandoori chicken is the best I have had in years and the fish was meaty with less batter and more fish. The biryani is just right and loved the pricing. The gentleman who was cooking and serving was extremely friendly and even gave me kheer while I waited for my order. I will revisit."}
{"text":"This small restaurant in an industrial strip plaza was a nice surprise. Don't plan on eating in, there are a couple of tables but the atmosphere is busy & it is Smokey from the tandoor oven. We ordered the butter chicken, vegetable briyani, naan & a fried fish. The fish was incredible & the other dishes were very good. Everything was tasty & fresh. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"We reached the venue by 8:50PM .. not a dine in place, but had seating enough for just 2 families .. the food was good .. best seekh and reshmi kababs that I've had .. the nihari was good .. karahi chicken was chicken masala, and the chanas were home style. The lady owner took care of us well, and I noticed a stream of deliveries. Prices were very reasonable, and fresh tandoori, garlic and mince meat naans were a wow. Will have them on the list for deliveries and catering."}
{"text":"Cosy little place, recently opened.  Open kitchen in front of dining area.  First time trying.  Butter chicken and naan are soo good.   Soft and thicker like afghani naan.  Good amounts of chicken, unlike other places.  Kebabs were also great... Different not what I was expecting.  Fresh and right amount of spice.  Chicken biriyani was flavourful, perfectly cooked and well portioned.  Prices also good for the serving you get.
Recommend for quick yummy meal."}
{"text":"Small business but fantastic food with great prices. There are a few tables but probably more of a take out place!"}
{"text":"This is great home style cooking. I loved that I got to see my naan being made. We got several things for take out and everything was well liked. Great value for money as well. This will be one of my go to takeout places!"}
{"text":"This place has opened recently. Located a bit inside the Fisherman Dr., behind the plaza. But it's worth finding it for the taste of their food!! 

We had KingPrawn Masala and Lahori Fried Fish with Afghani Pulao Rice.
The prawns were really fresh, perfectly cooked retaining the crunchy texture. Lahori fish was soft and fluffy, much better than many other fish fries we have tasted. It has an open kitchen concept, your food is prepared fresh in front of you... and the good part is, you can give your preferences of spices and any other suggestions you might have to make it according to your tastebud  :-)

Just keep a note, it's mainly a takeout place, with a limited sitting arrangement for small groups. If you prefer to dine in (like we do), reserve your seat in advance."}
{"text":"So i bought a groupon 12 for $20 worth of food ,called and placed my order for veal biryani and butter chicken the owner said it would be ready in 20 minutes.
Went there it is located in a very small little plaza , entered the shop it was empty with stuff all over the place .The owner/cook came and he said oh i have the veal biryani but i dont feel like giving it to you  i asked why he said instead take the mutton biryani , as the veal biryani is stale .Well i said can i check the mutton biryani as i m not comfortable buying it so he is like oh you dont trust me ? Well i redeemed my voucher and came out never ever going there again
Butter chicken was just average and biryani was ok ."}
{"text":"Thanks to an article written by Suresh Doss as part of his CBC Metro Morning series, a pal and I make the trek out here. Be forewarned: you might have a bit of difficulty locating it in the industrial plaza. But don't give up, this restaurant does exist and once you find it, you'll be so happy you did. 

The inside is small, with two tables with seating for four at each. It's mostly considered a take-out joint so be prepared to eat and go! The menu is a constant evolution of this family business. They have a hand-written menu posted to the wall, where you'll find classics like butter chicken which is what we ordered. Obviously, it won Doss over so we had to try it. 

Alongside garlic naan, the sauce is creamy and rich. It has some hints of garam masala and cinnamon and of course, has huge chunks of chicken. The garlic naan is light and makes a perfect addition to the curry. 

It should be noted that while we were here, at least four or five different groups of individuals stopped into the restaurant because of Doss' piece. So I suspect that Tandoori Tonight will be having a bit of a moment, thanks to the piece. I know the next time I'm back in Brampton, I'll be supporting them."}
{"text":"This best for take out. Just a wonderful, delicious find. The food was yummy and not greasy like most Indian food. I ordered the tandoori chicken, channa masala & chicken briy, and garlic naan. This is probably the best naan I've had. The service was fantastic. Very friendly. The prices are very reasonable and the portions are more than enough. I would definitely recommend you try this place one."}
