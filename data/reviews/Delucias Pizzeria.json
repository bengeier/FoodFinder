{"text":"They have some great pizza options. It was a little pricey but delicious authentic pizza. I ordered because I had a coupon for buy one get one pizza and ordered one pizza with spinach and feta. I did not eat there but the atmosphere seemed nice and family oriented. The staff was friendly on the phone and when I picked up my order.  On their website there's also a coupon for a free cookie."}
{"text":"This place sucks, I've been here five times for pizza and pasta and it just sucks. The ladies who work there are rude. They yelled at a person who took two stalls in front of their store for having a big truck and having disabled person in a wheel to move their truck. And park far away to go to a restaurant in the same complex next door."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place in town. Yes, the thin-crust pizza is VERY good, but most every time there I get the wings (get them baked--call ahead!), one of the sandwiches, and either the ravioli or the lasagna...with extra meatballs. Wow, it's always better than I remembered.  The people there are nice, the location a good bit away from the Vegas scene, and the atmospere is downright perfect. Yes, they have nearby delivery, but what a lot of people do is call ahead (say, 45 minutes) and pick up their food after getting Starbucks or groceries from the adjacent Smith's.  Delucia's Pizzeria's dine-in experience is also wonderful, truly the best IMHO. You don't HAVE TO dress up, and you can ignore the big screen TV there, but there's no way you can miss the fantastic food you're about to enjoy. You'll be glad you ate at Delucia's."}
{"text":"High on price and low on friendly customer service. Food is good but over priced. If paying for overpriced food, at least be friendly to your customers."}
{"text":"Delivery is always late and food comes cold. Manager is also rude when calling to complaint.  Will never order from this place again. \"Stay Away\""}
{"text":"I have never been so disappointed in my life after waiting for 40 minutes , I received my order went home and opened the pizza boxes and BURNT BURNT to a crisp , I called and explained to them that the pizzas are burnt they said to come back and I could get a new one . However I live 10 minuets away and the kids were hungry and couldn't waste any more time to on driving back and waiting another 40 minuets to get pizza , so I told them I wasn't able to come back today then she said she could give me 10% off my next pizza really not coming back NOPE not for a 1.50 off 1 pizza after I sent $40.00 bucks ..  SO DISAPPOINTED"}
{"text":"This is not a place to spend your hard earned money. the pizza is a 3 out of 10 and a frozen Digorno puts it to shame. The staff is rude and un attentive. The signs on the street  have been painted shamelessly to look like the lunch special is $5.00 when its really $5.99. This place will never get another dime from my pocket."}
{"text":"The pizza reminds me of the pizza I would find on the East coast. It tasted good I'm just not a huge fan of pizza crust that is floppy. I also like a little more cheese then they put on my pizza."}
{"text":"Best Italian Restaurant around here, owner is here all the time to make sure your meal is a 5 star meal and boy it is! I had pizza, calzone, lasagna, garlic knots and pasta and all of it is great. Great service too. Must TRY!"}
{"text":"Great New York style Pizza!  The crust is perfect. The toppings are not dry or overcooked.  We dined in. But you can also call in your order for pick up or delivery.  (If you're within their delivery area.)"}
{"text":"Don't speak English  way over priced always a hassle not worth the time or money. They say new lower prices it's  not true. Realy not all that. Done with these people .one time had a staple in our pizza. What should take 1 min takes five because they don't speak english...done"}
{"text":"The pizza is alright and good for the price. What I Didn't like was when we ordered for take-out and the lady on the phone asking for more information about our credit card than needed. I called to speak to a manager about the event and the lady that took our order answer and said the manger wasn't in and shes running the store so I could speak to her. I just politely said thanks but no thanks and hung up. We then canceling that card since we thought it was shady and haven't gone back even though the food was good. I recommend cash only."}
{"text":"Where to begin....  1.  Driver got lost - took an hour and  half to arrive 2.  Pizza was gross - didn't begin to look like quality pizza.  3.  Too expensive for the quality we were served. 4.  Got food poisoning. 5.  Spent the entire next day feeling hungover.    I wouldn't attempt if I were you, if only for reason 4."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service !!! Not a welcoming environment at all. Not specific on promotions, not a welcoming vibe, over charged prices !!"}
{"text":"Delucias pizza reminds me of pies from back east!!!  The flavor and the crust is awesome!!!! We get it once a week. Honestly , don't do the wings unless you like the little tiny kinds with no meat. Salads are good, garlic knots, just not the wings!!!!"}
{"text":"I didn't realize that this pizzeria was New York style only. I'm not a huge fan of thin crust pizza, so I asked if there were any thicker crusted options. The woman taking my order offered to use a larger dough and stretch it out to the smaller size I wanted to achieve a thicker crust... at no extra charge!   The pizza still ended up being thin, but it was really good so I didn't mind. The wait was a little long too. It's probably because we opted to dine-in during the dinner rush on a weekend.   4 stars for excellent service, good pizza, and a chill atmosphere (with ESPN!) I don't spend a lot of time in NLV, but I'll def come in again when I'm over here."}
{"text":"Not nearly as delicious as North Side Nathan's BUT their pizza crust was worth stopping in for. Spaghetti and lasagna portion was normal size and nothing to brag about. The service was friendly but EXTREMELY slow. Do yourself a favor and call it in even if you decide to eat there."}
{"text":"Just moved down the street from this place.  I went one night and order pasta for $10.00.  It was in large aluminum container which wasn't even one third filled for some pasta and Alfredo sauce.  I should have just went to the supermarket brought the items and made it myself for less than $5.00 and had ton of pasta."}
{"text":"This place us amazing!! Very small but intimate :) all the food is yummy and made when u order it! Everyones really nice and the prices aren't bad either! favorite food: calzones!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Got the Yelp offer for $15 for $30, and then read that it was for dine in only which led to our first dine in experience. (I've had delivery several times). The place was dead so we sat ourselves at a table and the manager came over and gave us menus and explained that their prices had changed and they were in the middle of changing out menus so the prices listed would be off. No big deal. She got our drink order and brought it out. We decided on a calzone, a Stromboli, (both of which you pick your three toppings), an order of medium wings, and chicken strips and fries for our little guy. The manager was very sweet and asked how we would like our food to come out, in which order, and when we wanted our little guys food too. She then went back and helped to prepare our food, a little odd to see a manager serving and cooking and maybe one other employee in the kitchen. Oh well.   The wings came out and they were EXCELLENT!!!! Crispy. hot. Great sauce. And great bleu cheese! Yes! We were skeptical because usually at pizza places we find the wings either slimy, crappy sauce, cold, or watered down gross bleu cheese; none of which was the case here. We made it a point to figure out which night was 50Â¢ wing night after that (Tuesdays FYI). My sons chicken and fries came out hot as well and he went to work. Not long after my calzone and the husbands Stromboli came out. Yum yum yum. Excellent pick. My husbands Stromboli was EXTREMELY greasy but he didn't mind as he knew it was from the sausage, and all he did was tilt the tray to drain the oil so it didn't make the bread soggy. No big deal.  The one thing that was kinda crappy was that I had to actually get up and walk to the counter twice for a refill, probably someone should have been looking out for that. We also had to flag the manager down for boxes and the check. When the check came I gave the manager my yelp coupon, that I had just purchased before walking in the door. She then informed me the owner stopped taking yelp coupons \"a long time ago\" and no longer accepted them. Uhhh, I just bought this. And we wouldn't have ordered what we did if I didn't have it.... After a moment of awkward silence and me getting angry, the manager said she would call the owner and ask. She took my phone with her (ok?) and went into the back. she came back a few minutes later and apologized profusely saying the owner had just approved this new yelp coupon and hadn't told her. Not her fault, that's fine, as long as I can use it. So that was resolved after that.  Overall great food !!! Nice manager. But if you're gonna dine in, don't expect much in the way of service."}
{"text":"When I first walked into this place I felt like I was stepping into a pizza joint \"back East.\" From the darkened interior to the dimly lit menu board, I love the feel of this place.  The people who work here are friendly and I enjoy watching the owner stretch the pizza dough. She's good!  On to the pizza. I love it. Again, it reminds me of a traditional pizzeria from the east coast. The flavors are simple but well done. They use just the right amount of toppings so that the pizza is slightly floppy without having things fall off in your lap. I recommend the meatball pizza. Also, the garlic knots are very, very good. They're always warm, steamy, and slightly chewy.   And believe it or not, the brownies are also good.  I didn't think that the pizza was too expensive. The portions are large but good quality."}
{"text":"Not impressed! I'm from NY! The first time I ate here I got sick eating the wings, I really think the grease was old and needed to be changed the pizza was ok... I gave them another chance last night and tried the Zeppolies! Disappointed again! They tasted just liked old grease and a waste of money! I tossed em out! Don't know if they went through a management change or what but I used to hear good things about them!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed!!!!! Ordered an eggplant parm meal. Basically, what I really got was eggplant and a quarter of the parm. VERY VERY LITTLE sauce and VERY VERY LITTLE CHEESE. Also, the cheese that was on there was like rubber. It tasted like cheap fake mozzarella instead of a good brand. I needed a knife to cut through the cheese. I wouldn't order from there ever again. I can almost guarantee the chefs are no where near Italian nor do they have any idea/experience in how to cook Italian food. I wouldn't give any stars if I could."}
{"text":"Me and my buddy went in there for the 2 slice and a salad + drink offer...40 mins. later it came out...We were the only two in the joint...Pizza is OK, owner runs the joint and pizza cook seemed baffled about how to make a pizza...We watched her (we know how to make pizza)..Place has a cute atmosphere, and thats it...Prices are good if they new how to run the joint...  This place could be great if it wasn't run by the owner/waitress lady whom I think I saw sitting down at the video poker machines at Smiths...???"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised! Coming from the East Coast, I've been spoiled with some excellent pizza in Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Philly, and NYC. I was craving a \"slice\" from home and decided to try the neighborhood pizza shop. The service was friendly and the pizza was bangin'"}
{"text":"If I could give this place negative stars I would. I made a yelp account months ago just to post about this place and here I go again....6 months later I gave this place another try after TERRIBLE service....the food is decent...and especially around here where else can ya really go?? Cause quite frankly I was sick off little Caesar's and pizza hut. Anyways yesterday my mother called ahead spoke with someone and explained ALL we wanted was a large pizza and Caesar salad. We just wanted to call ahead so we would have plenty of time to get family to the airport especially with holiday traffic and flights. Well the girl on the phone said no. Sorry. Bye. Just hung up  I understand policy and im sure you have been left to hang in the past. But I just find this crazy and just horrid customer service.  I cannot believe your still in business.   I work in fine dinning. I would be fired for your rude actions. On my second occasion!!!! Especially the day after Christmas at YOUR prices!!! You should be ashamed!! I know first hand what great service is.  If u dont believe me I will screen shot my restaurants reviews on yelp and show u how many times im praised for my exceptional service. Wow unbelievable."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite pizza place in Vegas. Their pizza is delicious and typically made to order as I most often take advantage of their \"two slices and a drink\" special. Hard to beat that value as I am stuffed for under $7. Rare in this city."}
{"text":"You know, I really should have listened to all the negative reviews but I'm a bit hard headed and so I had to learn the hard way.  I spent nearly $50 on food, and let me just say that my experience was absolutely horrible.  Customer service was no good and the food was even worse.  Just take a look at the chicken fingers that they expected me to eat."}
{"text":"I give it a 3 stars based on the overall experience. The cheese slice, was good. Not great. They promote that they are using \"Grande\" Cheese. I believe its mixed with something else. The pizza sauce wasn't great, but above average. It was NY style pizza def. Service was great, and I will definitely be going back for 40c wings, on Tuesdays. What brought it down was the Fettuccine Alfredo, I saw the cook, pull out a bag and put it in the microwave. for 10$ (14$ w/chicken) I expected they atleast make it there. I mean u could pre-make it, but wow, alfredo sauce from a bag? very dissappointed. it was bland, and no flavor. The other food that people around me ate, looked good, garlic knots, strombolis etc. So it definitely looks promising for my next visit. till then, it only gets 3 from me."}
{"text":"To say I'm disappointed with their establishment is an understatement. After being a LOYAL and FREQUENT customer for 4yrs it's sad to say I'll never do business with them again.  We have referred friends, family, co-workers, and for that matter strangers at the grocery store.   There was a mix-up on a pizza order of ours. They had always left about 2 slices for us just cheese. (We have a toddler lol) But it came in all pepperoni. Not the end of the world, mistakes happen. We called to let them know and also mentioned they did not stamp our receipt  (for their \"loyalty\" program)  The manager expressed her apologies and offered us a free 12inch cheese and said she would double stamp our receipt the next time.  I went in to pick up an order on Christmas Eve and reminded the manager about our double stamps. To which she took such tone and demeanor towards me that I was uncomfortable. She proceeded to say she never promised that to us. And I asked her, what do you think that I am making this up?  At this point I'm near speechless because this lady \"knows\" me, she's seen me a million times, we've always been friendly.  She said \"Well I never told you we'd give you double stamps and we already gave you a cheese pizza JUST because you didn't get two slices of cheese on your order\"  It was Christmas Eve. My feelings were totally hurt, never would I make up such a thing. Hey, I'm just the customer and was offered something by them for a mistake they made. I didn't ask for anything. If they offer something, honor it! Do not make someone feel guilty or uncomfortable about it! And surely don't say you didn't offer it when I know darn good and well that you did. She was so rude to me. I still can't believe it happened!  I told her to keep the pizza, they had just lost a loyal customer. Got in my car and placed a pick up order with Old School Pizzeria."}
{"text":"Terrible terrible terrible!!! My pizza was burnt and tasted stale and old. I don't know if they heat up pizzas from the day before but it tasted that way. I ordered my food for take out and when I saw how burnt and not edible the pizza was I called to let them know I wasn't happy and they only offered a small discount on my next visit. Pfffft like I will visit here again! The lady on the phone could have cared less and she I'm sure saw the pizza she boxed up and knew it was burnt. I want to see this lady feed her family food just like I got but I'm sure they get fed better. She should have offered a free meal on another visit or that day offered to correct the burnt one. Clearly by other yelp reviews and pictures of burnt pizza that others have posted you can see this place is not a legit pizza place but not even edible. The prices on their menu, website and take out menus all have different prices too which makes the place not look honest. A response from the owner filled with excuses like I see she's done on other reviews means nothing to me you'll never win me back."}
{"text":"I think these guys should be rated higher.  I live nearby and this was my families \"go to\" pizza.  They have a military discount and various specials through out the week too.  We always got the large pepperoni and mushroom and were never disappointed.  You can tell they use the best ingredients.  Pretty close to pizza back east."}
{"text":"Great cheesy bread and wings. I find it's best to call your order in ahead of time so it'll be ready when you arrive."}
{"text":"Attention! North Las Vegas has good pizza, Rhia! (pizzeria)  Couple buddies of mine wanted to eat out in the afternoon after playing the Nintendo Wii the night/morning before.  We decided to go with Delucias Pizzeria.    As soon as I walk in I noticed the smell of brownies. What the heck? I thought this was a Pizza joint not Mrs. Fields!  Anyways, it felt like a homestyle restaurant, and I loved it. We were greeted right away and you can see dough being kneaded, tossed and stretched right thru a glass window. Fresh!  Two big screen TV's with sports on. Bathrooms were clean.  Luckily, they had a gameday special.  Which was the 18\" cheese pizza, 20 wings with up to 4 flavors, and a big serving of fries all for $26 bucks.  The wings and fries alone was worth it.  Keep in mind we split it between 3 hungry people and we had leftovers for a 4th person.  As for the pizza, it was BIG with plenty of cheese plus we added pepperoni.  Why the star deduction? The dough was dry. =\. I will be definitely coming back here."}
{"text":"This is definitely not 3 star pizza. I've ordered quite a few times & it has been very good, every time. I could also tell that the fries are cooked in clean oil, because of their freshness. I'll give them a shot on their other items very soon."}
{"text":"Good pizza, nice service, decent menu, nice location. It's a decent pizza joint but nothing really sticks out. There are too many pizza joints that simply have better pizzas.   Oh and they charge for ranch? Foul!"}
{"text":"Ordered philly cheese steak pizza, and wouldn't suggest it.  They put tomato sauce on it and almost no cheese.  The ceasar salad was really good, the croutons were fresh, salad was fresh and really good quality.  BY FAR THE BEST GARLIC BREAD!  It was amazing!  Fairly expensive though."}
{"text":"Over priced pizza and appitizers.   Decent tasting pizza and fried zucchini.  2 stars given for the zucchini   Staff is unprofessional.   Eating area and restroom isn't sanitary.  My advise would be to stick with Little Caesars or Pizza Hut"}
{"text":"Super disappointed with the meal I received here on 4/6/17. We were staying in the area and wanted wings. We saw they had a wing special - 30 pieces for $21.99. Awesome!! We called in an order for the wings and an antipasto salad. We were able to choose up to 3 sauces for the wings, so we got hot, teriyaki and garlic parm.  We asked for delivery but the wing special was only available for takeout. No problem. She said it would be 25 minutes. My boyfriend left the house after about 20 minutes, and was gone for almost an hour! Waiting an hour for wings and a salad is ridiculous, especially when you pick it up! My bf said that someone dropped a pizza and had to remake it which is why the hold up, but we didn't order pizza so I'm not sure why or how that affected our order. Either way the wait time is LONG!   The food was a disappointment. The wings were super tiny and had lots of crunchy parts and bones and hardly any meat. No wonder they were so cheap! The salad was not an antipasto salad at all. It had ham, salami and cheese but it didn't even look appetizing. The dressings were for sure from a bottle. It's safe to say this was my first and last order from Delucias."}
{"text":"A very typical mom and pop shop - the wait staff definitely likes to gossip. With that said the food is delicious! My husband I frequent here for the $5 pizza deal at lunch time. We also use this place as our go to for wings. They have a great variety of flavors all of which are delicious. I've also tried most of their pasta dishes which are all very good. A tad pricey for dinner time but still one of my favorite places for lunch."}
{"text":"I'm from Brooklyn New York. What this place calls pizza makes we want to get on a plane & go back there. To have a good pizza one needs a good sauce,this place ain't got it!  I was making better sauce when I was 10. I'm on my 3rd antacid pill & I ate there over 5 hours ago.  I should have known better,it was the middle of lunch time & the place was empty. I'll stick with Enzo's or Sunset Pizza from now on!"}
{"text":"I hate be the first to review a business and not give it props, but I wasn't impressed with Delucia Pizzeria.  When I first moved into the area there wasn't anything not even the Smith's shopping center over there.  When I saw they were putting in a pizzeria I was excited and was anxiously awaiting its opening.  I was disappointed however.  The prices where high and the quality was not what I had hoped for.  I even tried it a second time just to be certain.  It was certainly not my cup of tea."}
{"text":"This is the  is worst pizza place u can go to everythings gross health dept needs to visit this place asap and they say Italian ya rite"}
{"text":"I ordered their lunch special that they have outside for $5.99 after taxes it was $8.44 I didn't know taxes were 29% - but whatever. Food was.. edible... to say the least. Better off going to Little Caesars and getting their $5 pizza. Much better, tastier, cheaper and fresh. The one I had was sitting in their warmer for I don't know how long.   The customer service was good. The guy who took my order was cool and the girl who handed it to me was nice too. I just wish their pizza was better."}
{"text":"Always great pizza, ice cold Shock Top & great, friendly service!"}
{"text":"With the name, I definitely thought I was in for some good NYC pizza. The only similarity is the size of the slice. The pizza is overpriced and doesn't taste that good. The kids didn't even go back for a second slice."}
{"text":"Food sucks and service worse!! DONT go here. Latina cooking was so sweet and only thing that shines at this joint. but early forties white lady sucked. She was gossiping in back kitchen with no regard for all to hear. When she brought my waters , food , etc... I responded thank you and she said ugh huh. what the fuck does ugh huh mean? is it so hard to say your welcome? NO CLASS! DONT GO HERE Minus 10 Stars"}
{"text":"Horrible service! Owner us very rude and blamed us for being busy slow with service."}
{"text":"Ok I had several issues with this place. To start I had called in for delivery and the person who answered was extremely rude. Now when someone is new to a place they generally will ask questions regarding the menu which is what I had attempted to do but she acted as if my questions were bothering her so I ordered a simple supreme pizza with the garlic fries. I called at 7 she said that it will arrive within 45-55 minutes. Ok so I wait and wait 8:15 come around and still nothing. Oh and btw it's right on the corner from where I stay. Ok so it finally gets here and the pizza is cold. Like really cold and so are the fries. So I call and again it's the same rude woman who answered the first time. And again very rude in tone and her choice of words. When I told her the food was cold she says well I know they just walked out of here with the pizza and it was just made. So I say well when it got to me it was cold. So she offers me 10%off my next order. At this point I just want my money back because this is really bad customer service. So her next suggestion is that she can have them remake the pizza and fries ad have it re delivered out to me because they don't do refunds.    I believe that it would have been ok if she didn't have such a nasty attitude like she is a customers first point of contact and if she is nasty then me being the customer is put off and wouldn't want to deal with it. I've seriously have had better customer service at the dmv then I did at this place."}
{"text":"We have had way better pizza for a lot cheaper. We was pretty disappointed with my experience. We ordered the 18\" white pizza and cinnamon dessert for $32 (it seemed a bit expensive off the bat). To me the sauce and crust are the two most important parts of a pizza and there was minimal sauce and a very thin/flavorless crust. The pizza really had no taste and was cardboard thin. The dessert was not very memorable either. It had a very sweet glaze with a tasteless dough. Everything tasted burnt which made the experience even worse. Although the staff was friendly, I would not go back."}
{"text":"Ok so the first time I tried these guys I gave them 2 stars. I don't know why it took me over a year to try them out again but I should of done it earlier! I remember the pizza was just ok.   This time I tried their wings because it was 40 cent wing Tuesday. 60 Wings for 25 bucks is not a bad deal at all. They have some good choices for your sauces. The 6 flavors I got were Spicy Bbq, Lemon Pepper, Garlic Parmesan, Medium Hot, Tangy Carolina, and Honey Barbeque. All were good.   I also had two orders of the garlic knots. Man they are addicting! You cant eat just one! Comes with marinara sauce to dip it in.   They have all other sorts of food items, like chicken fingers, wraps, and calzones just to name a few. Their large menu has all these and more so if you cant make up your mind, just pick something and come back another time to try the other stuff.  These guys have all sorts of specials. If you check in you can get 5 dollars off any 18 inch pizza. They also have a 10 for 20 dollar offer. If you look on their in store to go menu and website, (www.deluciaspizzeria.com) All the daily and weekly specials are on there. My favorites are the 2 slices of pizza and a drink for 5 dollars lunch deal and 40 cent wing Tuesdays.  Service is good. They are a family owned restaurant so you know they are always trying to work hard to earn your business.   Some random info: Hours are Mon thru Thurs 11 am to 9 pm, Fri and Sat 11 am to 10 pm. Closed Sundays. They have a flat screen HD tv so you can watch your favorite sporting event while eating or waiting for your food.  So Delucia's im glad I checked you out again and I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"This small mom and pop shop is so the perfect spot to turn around a bad day. The staff always puts a smile on my face. The whole atmosphere makes me feel like I'm an a small town. Their pizza is ooey-gooey cheesey perfection, and you can't beat their specials. I work down the street and always look forward to my lunches here. To all the employees: Great job guys!"}
{"text":"I ordered chicken fingers and French fries, its enough to feed two people. It tasted great and the customer service was good. The price was fair."}
{"text":"Crappy beat down place!! They gave us all burnt food and still refused a refund! I'd say go else where! Service sucks, food is terrible, the employees have no customer service!!! This place is a joke!"}
{"text":"Best pies on this side of town.  Always fresh and consistently delicious! Never disappointed even my 4 children love it! Highly satisfied!"}
{"text":"I am VERY picky about my pizza. Unlike my wife who can handle Dominos and Pizza Hut, I need a great tasting New York style pie. Delucias fills that greatly. The pizza is awesome and the delivery people are great. BUT, the people on the phone suck. They're usually rude and curt. I'm constantly put on hold for a simple order. But once all that is done I have to give them props for great pizza."}
{"text":"Just because its close doesn't mean its good!  This place is super disgusting and a bunch of idiots work there, especially the one answering the phone.  Don't go to this place unless you want them to continuously screw up your order and then have an attitude when you call them on it.  I paid $1.99 a piece for 24 oz cokes, which were flat as water. So that is over $4 for two flat cokes. I ordered salads with my meal with is an additional $1 ea.  They forgot them.  So when I called back about the salads I was told I would get a 2 liter coke delivered with my salads.  Nope, that didn't happen. The androgynous person on the line said I didn't speak to him/her and that they can't grantee their fountain drink.  WTF are you kidding me Pat!!  The man or woman, I can't figure out the voice had the nerve to think that I would order from them again and get their crappy food for my coke to be free at a later date.  Unless you want nasty greasy food and a messed up order, avoid this place like the plague!!!"}
{"text":"I used to go here all the time and loved it but recently the pizza is greasy and they some how changed the mozzarella sticks, which I no longer enjoy.  I placed an order on line and the owner/ manager would not let me get half extra cheese and half pepperoni, he/she stated extra cheese has to be on the entire pizza....... terrible service in my opinion.  I haven't gone in months to this place."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and that will be enough for me. The first visit I stopped in on a lunch break around 11:20 am. I noticed a sign outside promoting a 2 slice and drink deal for $5.99, so I asked the lady at the register for that. She rolled her eyes and said they had only opened at 11, so I'd have to wait for the pizza to be made. The lady made me feel like I was bothering her by coming inside and ordering during regular business hours. If they open at 11 then why not have pizza ready or close to ready at 11? I arrived almost a half hour after they were opened she should have been prepared to serve customers and with a friendlier tone. I had planned to eat inside, but asked for it to-go since I felt uncomfortable eating inside because of the vibe I got from the employee. Whens she handed me the food she never said thanks just \"here you go\" and then went back behind the counter. I often eat at Cugino's on Decatur near the 215 (walmart parking lot) and they also sell pizza by the slice and sometimes run out because they get busy and the older guy there always takes the time to make fresh pizzas and first warn customers how long it will be for the pizza to be ready. I never mind waiting there and wouldn't have minded waiting here at Delucia's if the service and food were worth it. The pizza I had was not cooked all the way. The crust was raw in a lot of spots and I couldn't even eat it. Complete wast of time and money.  I met hubby for lunch earlier this week and he picked the spot, being this place, blah. He knows I love pizza and thought we could try this place. He didn't remember this was the spot I told him about not that long ago that served me somewhat raw pizza and that I didn't want to go back. Since he took the time to search the place out I figured I'd give it another try. This visit there were 2 different ladies working behind the counter and they were very friendly and a big change from what I experienced a few months prior. I decided this time to try the pizza again, but this time priced at $6.99 I chose a special that included 2 cheese slices and a side salad. When I opened the box and saw the burnt spots on the 2 cheese slices, it just didn't look appetizing. I bit into the first slice and the crust was stale tasting and burnt. I looked underneath the slices and sure enough it was burnt. I couldn't eat much of it because the flavor was just terrible. I moved next to the side salad. When I first opened the container and saw the salad, I thought it looked very good. The lettuce looked very fresh, but when I mixed up the salad, I found rotten veggies under a big pile of black olives. Gross! Hubby had the same problem with his pizza being burnt and he called a bit later to let them know and they did offer him 10 percent off the next order, but really that's it? The proper thing to do would be to refund the order or better yet, remake the order and try to keep a customer. I noticed in other reviews and pictures that other customers have been having the same issues with burnt pizza and the business responds, so clearly they are aware that this isn't just a random issue, but an issue that keeps happening. I know darn well that the person making my food saw what she boxed up and should have never served it to a customer in the condition it was in. They are fully aware of the type of food they are really putting out. No 3 strikes for me, it's 2 and you're out!"}
{"text":"Best Italian sub I've had in a LONG time. They do not slump out on anything. And the staff is always very nice."}
{"text":"Came here with the kids to find a new pizza place. Ordered pizza and wings to go. Went home. Started to serve the pizza and as I took a slice of pizza out there was a long hair that came with the slice. Immediately lost my appetite. Called them and advised them of the hair I had in my pizza. All the lady says is to send a picture to her. No apologies until i became really upset about this. She took my name and number down and I never received a call. So I guess trying a different pizza place turned out a disaster!    This place is hilarious and they like to cover themselves. Please if you are reading this message don't eat here. They don't wear gloves while they are making the pizza. Just nasty. They need to be shut down. I have ordered pizza from them and the same thing happened to them they had hair in the pizza. Someone needs to either shave or wear a hair net. I won't stop until this place goes down. Pathetic just horrible service!!!!"}
{"text":"Staff was unprofessional and unwilling to accommodate. They had a special running (which only saves $4) and refused to allow me to get the larger sized pizza (making them more profit) despite me wanting to pay the difference.   Prices were way too high for a hole-in-the-wall pizza spot.   Person cooking wasn't wearing gloves while making pizzas. They smelled like cigarettes.   The location was empty and clearly they weren't trying to change that."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and I have noticed an inconsistency of their dough when baked. So I'm not sure if it's due to different cooks or not. Today's pizza dough was medium well with a stiffness meter of a 7. The flavor of the pizza was good. And as far as a small pizza joint goes, they're very good. Everyone was friendly and attentive and no signs of any pests or other critters. I believe that once they are consistent on the baking and not over baking the bottom of the pizza, I would reconsider the star rating."}
{"text":"Oh my. What the heck. Ordered 30 wings via telephone for delivery. Person on the phone lack needed skills to correctly take a phone order. Delivery was fairly quick but the delivery person could not operate the automated security gate. The cheese fries were undercooked so completely soggy and nasty. Finally, the wings were rubbery and incredibly small. Not again.....not for 40 dollars nor for free. Sorry DeLucia's......very unsatisfactory."}
{"text":"I have been there only once and ordered the ham, pineapple, red onion pizza to go. I absolutely loved it and definitely would go back there. The pizzas are a little more expensive than some other places but the quality was really great and the pizza tasted super fresh. Probably the best pizza I have had since a long time. :)"}
{"text":"Food is good, for the most part. Made to order, so typically hot and fresh. Sometimes the pizza can be too soggy.  Staff is friendly and efficient. Prices are reasonable. Definitely a nice change for this side of town. Located next to Smiths. They deliver, but again, sogginess can be a problem (we experienced this last time) so try to order a \"basic\" type pizza to avoid this."}
{"text":"Soggy pizza soggy jalapeno peppers, soggy mozzarella sticks. Sucky place will NEVER order or recommend."}
{"text":"Daily \"special\" pizza served cold. Toppings even colder like they were taken out of the cooler and thrown right on the cold pizza. Wings served cold and the accompanying French fries. Very SMALL portion of fries. Blue cheese of poor quality. Way too long of a wait for simple order. WAY over priced for the quality and portion size. With all the options around I'm surprised they are in business. I will try again to form a better opinion of this location. I hope to have a better experience that I can share in here."}
{"text":"Ordered a large peperoni pizza and two orders of bone in chicken wings. NY style thin crust pizza cooked perfect and the parmesan garlic wings were amazing! We will order from here again."}
{"text":"Not sure how this place has 3 stars. It is by far the best new york style pizza available in las vegas. I come from south green valley 40 min drive each way as often as i can for the excellent pizza they have there. If you are looking for the taste of an authentic NY pizza this is the place. I am from NY so my opinion holds a much higher value than that of a local or non new yorker. VERY GOOD PIZZA. Its that simple. I just wish there was a location closer to henderson !   Ps please move store or open another !!"}
{"text":"So.... We, boyfriend and I, walk into this place unsure of what to expect. It wasn't busy. Kind of cute. While standing at the counter, I first smell the scent of a recently lit match and then a chocolatey smell overwhelms me. Boyfriend orders a Stromboli and I order Spaghetti with meat sauce.   Loving chocolate as much as I do, I'm getting distracted by the smell. Takes me a few minutes and we find the BROWNIES! The lady at the front counter says it's her own recipe. They're still warm. Excited, we buy one and forgo the normalcy of dinner before desert and taste. Moist, delicious, warm gooey brownie.   Food was delicious, although there was more sauce than I'd like, but that's a personal preference. =)"}
{"text":"Place is extremely dirty! Manager is VERY rude! I'm assuming she's the manager since all the other workers look 16 and she looks 75 and sounds 100....overpriced for what you get. A very bland cheap product with more attitude than quality.   STAY AWAY this place is not worth it. Little Caesars makes this place look like a dump!!!"}
{"text":"Each cheese pizza I've had here seems to short of sauce.  I was interested in trying other menu items, but the lackadaisical staff was a turn off.    Last week I made the mistake of suggesting this place to a co-worker.  She paid $9.95 to receive 5 under seasoned & over-fried chicken fingers.  She paid an additional cost for greasy fries and a soda with.  When she asked for ranch dressing, the staff huddled together to decide whether or not they were going to provide it.  She's still upset with me."}
{"text":"We ordered a 14\" white pizza, 14\" pepperoni pizza, ten chicken fingers (garlic parmesan and honey bbq), a large salad and garlic bread. Over $60 later, let's just say we are very, very unimpressed. The garlic bread was burned, the chicken fingers were very small and the garlic parmesan was just preprocessed garlic with no taste. The pepperoni pizza was generic, nothing special and the white pizza was not worth it's $19.50 price tag. Giant globs of ricotta cheese with some basil leaves look like a way of trying to make it more gourmet, but it just ended up compromising the overall pizza. The salad was okay, my only suggestion would be to get more dressing varieties and to not have giant pieces of lettuce. Kind of hard to eat. The only saving grace is that the employees were nice. We won't be ordering again."}
{"text":"Awesome awesome awesome pizza! Tastes like its straight from New York! They also deliver which is a plus for my preg stomach when I get a craving! Order the 18\" with mushroom and ricotta cheese...its awesome!"}
{"text":"I'm the first to post a review... Sorry to say it is NOT a good one... I redeemed points on my credit card to order a few pizzas, wings, fries,  and a desert... They said I had a \"dine-in\" or \"pick-up\" only coupon and would not deliver it. They would deliver anything I ordered except the free pizza that I had the coupon for. I will attach the pizza coupon so everyone can see it because they did not want me to send it to them.  I do not like posting bad reviews but when a business does me this wrong, I can't just let it go for others to suffer."}
{"text":"Fast, easy to order, that even tell you if they have a better deal then a coupon we love the pizza here and staff is pretty cool too Their canolis are small but yummy! We've been ordering here for a few years now and will continue !!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is very friendly and inviting. The staff very helpful with suggestions from their menu.  So many selections, and the personal pizza is a pretty big size for one person. Their fries were perfectly crispy."}
{"text":"Consider this an FYI update: dDring my past two visits over the past couple weeks, the salad served with the pizza/salad combo has shrunk.  As opposed to getting a large plate of salad (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gGS9Os0UBBO8BosD3VnwqQ?select=3KRA-B0_j8K1nLB16COlFA), it looks like plate sizes have been downgraded to litlte bowls (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gGS9Os0UBBO8BosD3VnwqQ?select=PJYrZmFJ46mCyUX8_NRNgg).  The value of this lunch combo goes down a bit since the price remains the same, but quality of food is still the same as well."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is consistently good and they use all fresh ingredients. The meatballs are even made fresh there!   The Calzone crust is not too thick, covered in garlic butter, and it is stuffed full. The sauce is served on the side for dipping.  They deliver as well but going in for lunch or dinner is a good option.   I've heard that the Chicken Parm is wonderful as well."}
{"text":"Pizza not bad remember three stars is A-OK rating with yelp candy was very polite and kind to me I see previous mentions of lacking customer service. I had a coupon she didn't make me feel like a cheapskate for using it, it was for $20 off! I ordered two specialty pizzas garlic Legacy and the carnivore. The place looked clean though I did not inspect it with a fine tooth comb. The Garlic legacy was very tasty I thought it could've been done a little bit more when I got to the crust it was very doughy I personally like a little bit more sauce but I can order it that way next time The carnivore was a bit greasy but considering all the grease in the meats it's understandable salami was excellent quality and that crust was done well."}
{"text":"Got here for an early lunch and this was my first tome dining in .. my date has gotten stuff to go here before so I've always known I like the sauce and the quality for the prices especially supporting local but Candy (sorry if it's with a K) made this a definite 5 Star dine in experience by getting our appetizer order in while we decided on our lunch choices , having our waters refilled and for keeping communication open and always being helpful while having our stuff to us fresh and ready with a smile.  We also got to enjoy the Kentucky derby while eating cause they had it set up on the tv for a nice cozy north town spot with cool specials especially 20% off military Monday's this place is worth giving a shot .  Especially if you're just looking for a yummy slice of pizza or some fried mushrooms that taste delicious"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Slow and not friendly. Smallest calzone I've ever bought, suck a waste of money!"}
{"text":"I enjoy the pizza here, I've never had a bad experience. I love the The Victoria pizza, I add mushrooms to mine and it's amazing! You have to try the honey BBQ wings--this honey BBQ sauce is good! It does take awhile to get your order but you watch them make it while you wait and it makes you appreciate the freshness of their ingredients! Freshly tossed pizza crust right in front of you!"}
{"text":"I live close to this place, I have lived in my home for about 6 yrs... I have tried DeLucia's a few times...  I was not impressed those prior times, i thought the dough was tough, sauce had no taste...   Well i stopped in there and got the 2 slice special with drink for 5 bucks...  I really liked those 2 slices... It folded nicely, the crust had a nice crunch, sauce was ok, cheese was good,,, I wont order a whole pizza and take it home.. I usually order it have it there then go home...  I think this is the case with this place... Have the pizza in the shop,, tastes much better...I will order pizza from here in the future...I do reccommend this place if you are in the area..  07/30/2013 Got the wings that are on special for 40cents a peice... STAY AWAY,, they sucked so bad...  Not the place to go for wings they still would of sucked at 10cents,,,  I got the  med heat wings ehhhhh they were no better than the hot food deli at the walmart... The other 15 were garlic parm...  LMAO,,, Total fail.. Pizza decent wings PWECK....  You lose a star for the wings,,, SORRY"}
{"text":"The lady who took our order was nice. She even brought us water to drink when she saw that we were on a family bike ride. Thank you!   But...... The other lady who came on shift after her ehhhh........I am sitting at the table nearest to the front door. She walked in with a cigarette in hand that she had just put out (obvious) and walks right into the kitchen, washes her hands, and then proceeds to answer her cell phone all while talking to a lady who came in looking for a job. Once she completed the phone call she put her phone down and began making a salad for guest that were seated with her bare hands. NO she did not wash her hands after handling her phone. Due to the unhealthy sanitation standards, unfortunately we will not be patronizing this establishment again."}
{"text":"Thank you guys for great customer service, fast delivery, and amazing food! We ordered the family feast and it was cheap! And fed my family of 5 dinner and lunch the next day. I can judge a pizza place if the pizza is good with no toppings besides cheese. And this was excellent!! Perfect thin crispy crust! The sauce was DELISH! The cheesy bread was so yummy as was the marinara. The wings were great my kids devoured them. Chicken fingers perfectly seasoned and homemade fresh! The fries as my 5 yr old said were EXCELLENT lol and thank you for the extra hot sauce! Only downside was I want more pizza so we will be ordering again soon! Thank you!"}
{"text":"I'm from NY and Delucia's Pizzeria reminds me of NY. You walk in and it smells like an authentic NY pizzeria. It's like my little piece of home here in Vegas. The pizza isn't overly saucy and the cheese isn't gross like some of the chains. The pizzas are made to order fresh when you order. One of my favorite items on the menu are the garlic knots. They are actual KNOTS. Most places give you garlic bread or sticks or even huge roll looking things. Delucia's gives you garlic knots just like NY."}
{"text":"Really quite good!  Reasonably priced, lots of selection! The pizza I had delivered was delivered HOT and the ingredients were fresh. LOVE the garlic knots! Sauce isn't the best, but still very good. Will update my review when I try something other than the pizza."}
{"text":"Best family-oriented place to hang out. Best damn food I found in a long time. The lasagna, spaghetti, meatballs, Pizza, Wings and french fries. Every bit of the menu is great. Well worth stopping in I'm sure you'll enjoy it as much as I have."}
{"text":"Poor customer service. attitudes and stank faces all over the place. charge for ranch. no debit or credit. and still charge refillls."}
{"text":"We stopped in on a recommendation and we are glad we did! The pizza had an original, creamy sauce and yummy fresh cheese. Our wings were fried fresh and tossed in mild sauce (next time I'm trying BBQ!) The fries were crispy and delish! We loved the home made ranch dressing with our wings. The owner is super friendly and all the employees inquired about our meal! The TV wasn't loud enough to be distracting and we were able to converse without having to yell over it. Would definitely hit them up again!"}
{"text":"Look, it's hard to find great pizza here in Vegas, especially on the north east part of town. I am from the east coast and I grew up with the best pizza around and I have been searching and searching for something that even comes close. Delucias is by far the closest I have found. They have thin crust, delicious sauce, and good toppings.  The only downside is that the atmosphere needs some work, but the food quality is great which is why I always go back."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad experience at Delucias. The pizza is decent and the baked ziti is awesome. It's the perfect last minute dinner on those weeknights were cooking just isn't happening. Don't expect everyone working to be warm and fuzzy, they are to the point and friendly if you aren't rude. It's a pizza joint not a 5 start restaurant. I have learned not to order their white pizza but it's good otherwise. Pro tip, order a side of hot wing sauce to dip your pizza in."}
{"text":"This place is garbage. I went in along with another customer and we literally were standing there ten minutes. I said hello r u guys open.... The white lady working in there today said yeah we will be there in a minute with an attitude. I rang the bell a good four times. She was talking under her breath about me and my disabled daughter. I do not appreciate this at all and hope you guys know that you lost 2 potential customers."}
{"text":"Smiling, friendly, and home like service. Chicken parma was very good. Pizza was great. Cosy cute place.   We got a coupon and tried for the first time. Will be going back."}
{"text":"The yelp ad says they are closed today, but when I called they were open until 9 tonight. I should have follows yelp's instinct.  I ordered their special one topping pizza, hot wings and fries for $29.99. Thought it was a bargain. Asked for a pepperoni pizza and extra crispy fries.   Picked up the pizza, told them the Yelp ad said they were closed today so they should look into changing it. Got home, the entire bottom of my pizza was burnt. Yuck! My pitbull had a hard time eating the crust. The fries were also soggy. So much for extra crispy.   We will not be returning. Yuck."}
