{"text":"Sardine has one of the best Brunches in Madison! Very casual and family friendly, with a menu that has something for everyone! While your there be sure to order a Bloody Mary! Delicious!"}
{"text":"We ordered the mussels here and my husband was throwing up later that evening.   I think he ate a bad one.  You have to be really careful when cooking those things as  they can make people VERY sick if not cooked properly.  I wouldn't eat here again."}
{"text":"By FAR the best restaurant I've been to in Wisconsin! The oysters were as fresh as you can get them on any coast. The duck was cooked to perfection, & all the appetizers are excellent! I can't wait to go again. Definitely make reservations, you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Partway through a long bike ride, we became ravenously hungry. We were right by Sardine on a sunny Sunday, and stopped in for brunch. It was DELISH! A little pricy but very interesting options, super flavorful. I wish we'd had the foresight to get there a little less starved so we could have eaten on the deck, but we took the first available seats to get some food fast. I don't know how we've lived here for so long without ever going here before! But we will be back, and now are excited to try dinner too."}
{"text":"Have been wanting to try Sardine since it opened and I was mostly not disappointed. Some things I observed:  1. Apparently, Sunday night is NOT a good time to go; it was crowded (oh well) but more importantly, they seemed to be out of EVERYTHING. Salmon? No. Whitefish? No. Signature sardine appetizer? No. Beef carpaccio salad? No. This leads me to number 2...  2. Rather disappointing rainbow trout with watercress cream, which my dining companion resorted to given dearth of salmon and whitefish. Presentation was nice, but it was a little bland. He raved about the accompanying vegetables (carrots, vidalia onions, etc.) but considered the trout forgettable enough that we actually forgot the leftovers on our kitchen table and had to toss them the next morning.  3. That said, the warm duck confit salad was awesome. I am normally anti-frise, but I was seduced.  4. Charcuterie plate appetizer was a welcome substitute for the sardines. I devoured the duck liver.   5. Tables were a little close together, close enough that I was embarrassed on behalf of the guy at the adjacent table when he asked what \"haricots verts\" were and the waiter was like \"green beans.\" Awkward.  6. Foie gras? Such an illicit thrill for a Chicagoan!  Bottomline: pretty tasty, and I will go back."}
{"text":"Very cool, trendy atmosphere w a great view of the lake. Had the spinach, goat cheese, tomato, bacon omelette w/ frites and salad. The omelette was very good and the frites were AWESOME!! Our server was very friendly and the only complaint was that once the food was served, we didn't see him again til he dropped off the bill and noone ever came around to refill our coffees or check in on us. Id definitely go back, they had several items on the menu I'd love to try"}
{"text":"I really love Sardine as a special treat to myself. Easily the best bloody mary in town, delicious food, wonderful view, well trained staff. Really the only thing that keeps me from giving a fifth star is the lack of vegan options for my significant other. No matter how much I enjoy a place it cannot become a regular spot if I cannot bring my mate! Please please please I beg of you to add a vegan dish to your brunch menu, and you will get the fifth star! :)  In all seriousness I have not had a single plate of food, drink, or cup of coffee that I have not enjoyed. I don't even mind enduring the pretentious sort of crowd and long waits this place attracts or the hefty price tag. It is all worth it for a well made bloody mary, perfect latte, and oh my how I have dreams about that duck salad."}
{"text":"First, enter from lake side parking, not the official street address.  Large open floor plan, small and focused menu with a handful of yummy signature drinks, including a version of a Pimm's Cup.  Gotta try the Sardine appetizer (obviously).  Whitefish entree was very good, the seafood crepe even better!  Staff was pleasant and helpful."}
{"text":"Sort of a predicament.  We went for brunch and the food sucked.  Look Sardine, learn to cook eggs.  It's not hard.  They do it for a 1/4th of the price at greasy spoons across the country.  When you order over medium eggs, the yolk shouldn't be solid.  YOU SHOULD NOT FUCK THIS UP WHEN YOU CHARGE 12 dollars for two eggs and a 3/4th inch segment of ring bologna and the end of a dried out brat (billed as the 'german sausage' - god, fuck off, for fuck's sake.  German sausage...).  Also, when you make an omelet, you need to do a little more than insert some tepid chunks of brie and mushroom into a folded over egg-pancake.  Omelets are light and fluffy.  Not chunky and soggy.  Gross.    But we still liked it because of the atmosphere.  Really kickass view of the lake.  If you go at noon and you concentrate real hard, it's almost as if the you're not looking out onto a frozen lake. (It was winter.)  Sun shines right in, reflecting off cars in the lot.  It's like not being in Wisconsin. I almost felt like I was home for a second.  Thank you, blinding sun."}
{"text":"I love love love this place! We came up here from Chicago for a mini vacation and decided to try Sardine. Such a great choice! We had the Steak and mashed potatoes, and I believe the salmon. Both were fantastic, one of the best steaks I have ever had! Our waiter was amazing as well, very attentive, nice, and friendly, but didn't overdo it either. We ended the dinner with their amazing creme brulee. Definitely will go back here if I am ever in Madison!"}
{"text":"Fantastic bar menu... great drinks, great atmosphere. Excellent brunch.  Really like this place."}
{"text":"Brunch is a meal that I rarely venture out for.  I see little appeal in rising early after a Saturday night of debauchery just to guzzle mimosas and eat eggs, but Sardine may have just become my Sunday morning salvation.  Last Sunday four friends and I ventured to Sardine just after 1 P.M. without reservations or calling ahead to be seated immediately.  The restaurant was completely full but our server Adam greeted us quickly.  The noise level was high, but tunes by The National, Arcade Fire, and other great hipster jams provided  a comfortable noise cushion.  We started off with mimosas which were perfectly balanced, crisp, and sparkling.  Round two consisted of Salty Dogs which are simply a greyhound variation served tall with a salted rim and a fresh slice of grapefruit.  Both drinks offer an effective defense against the common cold, scurvy, and sobriety making them a winner in my book.  I settled on the pork sausage dish which came with a fresh salad and two eggs any way you'd like (over easy in my case).  The sausages were well spiced and exceptionally flavorful. A crispy risotto cake was wonderful change of pace from ordinary potato variations that are ubiquitous on brunch menus.  Sardine is a great brunch spot that I will return to for it's food, service, and ambiance."}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed with a visit to Sardine. It is one of my favorite, go-to places in Madison--either for brunch with families, dinner out with a large group of friends, or date night. Great service, great food."}
{"text":"Sardine has a lot going for it: great location, great ambiance, views of the lake. However, I was a little underwhelmed by the food. I've been here a few times, for brunch and dinner, and I thought the food was good, but a tad high for the quality I wanted.  I've also had mixed experiences with the service. Because I've been there before, I knew that the front desk was in the MIDDLE of the restaurant, but there aren't signs. I've seen people just wait by the front door, and it just made me feel bad for them. No one really comes up to them and tells them that the host/hostess is in the middle.   That said, this place does have good seafood, and if you're looking for a nice lakefront view, this place has got it going on."}
{"text":"By far the best meal I've had in Madison.  My fiance and I went to Sardine last week for our Wednesday date night and left sublimely happy. Not only was the food flavorful and complex enough for me to want to keep eating, but it was reasonably priced.  Do yourself a favor and get either a Manhattan or a Scottish Fog."}
{"text":"I ordered my lamb chops medium and it came out bleeding so I asked to have it cooked a little more. The waitress was really nice and understood why i wanted it cooked more but by the time I got my plate back, everyone had already finished their meals and my lamb chops were completely overdone. The waitress said she understood why I was frustrated but I didn't want everyone to wait while the chef cooked another plate so I said it was fine. She didn't charge me for the plate which was nice of her but I don't expect this type of mistake to happen at a restaurant with high reviews... I'm pretty disappointed. Maybe I'll try back another time...."}
{"text":"We tried Steamed Mussels,Steak Frite and Grilled Salmon,everything is delicious! And I have to say the location is very good.But it's best to make reservations first cause it's really popular at Saturday nights."}
{"text":"The mussels and lamb chops were incredible!! Also the cocktails are delicious, especially the cucumber corpse revival! Love this place as a Friday night date night with my boyfriend!!"}
{"text":"Terrible experience. The service was incredibly slow. It took 90 minutes for our food to arrive, and then they blamed us. They said that because we ordered oysters that our food would come in courses.   The portions were so small after waiting for so long that we'll have to go to culvers for food. The price for what we ended up receiving was shameful.   I wouldn't recommend this for anyone."}
{"text":"The space is absolutely lovely, with simple colors, heavy wooden beams, some light industrial touches, and cozy nooks too--there are farm tables and tables with lake views. The food was lovingly prepared and I had the salmon which was perfectly grilled and served with delectable mushrooms and smoky lentils. The mussels came in a cream sauce that we soaked our bread in--yum! Great cocktails and service, too. Don't hesitate--just go."}
{"text":"As far as a staple here in Madison, they always hit the mark. Food is consistently good to wonderful. Atmosphere classy, but casual. Has a way of being family friendly without being over-run with children. Only once did I have a small piece of cheese wrapper in my food. Not quite five star, but the waitress was apologetic and it was taken off our bill without us asking. Given how many times I've been there, at least once something wasn't going to be perfect, their response to the situation was five-star.  We take friends here from out of town for dinner all the time.  I wish they had more iced coffee drinks to offer, but beside that, no complaints."}
{"text":"Great place for drinks and appetizers in the bar and meeting friends for dinner! One of my favorite Madison restaurants. Excellent bistro fare- super fresh seafood, especially the oysters. Great atmosphere and friendly  professional service. A must go to in Madison!"}
{"text":"I've been to sardine several times for both brunch and dinner. The food is decent, but never exceptional. In all of my visits I have never been wow'd by a dish. At this price point, it should happen on a more frequent basis, or at least once. With that said, you will likely have a decent time. I've had nothing but good service, and the interior is nice with several tables providing excellent views of the lake."}
{"text":"Great food, great cocktails, great beer selection, great service.  I really like this place. I actually went here for my classy bachelorette party a couple years back. :) When they open up the outdoor seating onto the lake it is like paradise.  Last evening we dined at Sardine and shared piccolo fritto which was a wonderful combo of asparagus, eggplant, cauliflower, and zucchini. We also sampled the lobster croquettes which were phenomenal.  After that, we were quite full so we shared the house salad and shared a penne with smoked salmon dish. The salmon was really great and the textures and flavors in the pasta dish worked very well together.  For dessert we shared an amazing hazelnut chocolate ganache with crunchy crust and caramel.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"The dining room is airy and spacious, so it can be difficult to hear conversation at the table. The service is typically good.   The drink menu is pretty good, but many of the wines by the glass are of pretty poor quality.  The food is honestly not all that good.  I don't think a city more sophisticated than Madison would tolerate the mediocre quality fare that Sardine regularly dishes up.  I've tried nearly everything on the menu and have often been disappointed.  But the restaurant is all right.  I didn't appreciate, however, the staff booming Arcade Fire the other evening when I was hosting some business guests. Oh, and the food is chock full of raw garlic.  Beware."}
{"text":"We had a lovely experience here, while visiting from Chicago. The ambiance is great - charming decor, lovely staff. We started with the Charcuterie plate and for entrees we had the Trout and the Duck Confit salad. Both were delicious. Our server was the perfect balance of attentive yet not intrusive - great timing. We'd definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I had trout and my roommate had lamb chops. Lamb chops are really great! Except for food, I like the restaurant because they have fresh little cute flower on every table."}
{"text":"Fantastic! I took my son and 4 other college students there when visiting this past weekend. We had a reservation and were seated immediately.  Four of us had fish dishes that were excellent. One had the lamb and another the hanger steak. Everyone loved their meal. The service was top notch - the college kids loved everything about the restaurant as did this mom.   I would highly recommend Sardine. Make a reservation because it was packed!"}
{"text":"So, I have probably eaten at Sardine over 20 times.  I love it.  Everything here is amazing.  While I am sad they took the skate wing off the menu, I have now discovered a whole new world of roasted chicken, duck, lamb, and most importantly, sticky toffee pudding.  LOVE.  And the oysters are amazing.  AMAZING.  Great service to boot.  The hostess with the short brown hair (the one without glasses) is sort of snooty though."}
{"text":"My family is from San Francisco, and devotees of great food.  Sardine's brunch is always on the agenda when they come to visit. We are all obsessed with their creamed eggs, and Belgium waffle.  One of the best brunches in Madison."}
{"text":"So glad I finally got to try this place! Great experience in every way... Fantastic service, delicious food, cozy and unpretentious ambience. I loved it.   We tried the Warm Duck Confit salad, the Arctic Char, Orecchiette, and Mahi Mahi special. I'll say that their seafood dishes were delicious. Perfectly cooked with an emphasis on the fish-- couldn't recommend them more (especially the Char... That has to be one of my top three dishes in Madison).   Warm Duck Confit was great. I probably would try another appetizer if I returned, but I enjoyed it and I'm glad I ordered it.   Overall, can't say enough good things. Friendly and efficient service, reasonable prices, delicious food, great atmosphere. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best house infused cucumber vodka...ever! Loved the food and sitting on the water view deck. The only complaint was slow service...she forgot our oysters that we ordered and food was really slow."}
{"text":"Sardine has to be one of the best lunch/brunch spots in Madison during the summer, I love the view of the lake. The decor and atmosphere of the restaurant makes you feel like you're hanging out in a small Seattle restaurant. The food most definitely delivers as well; I'm yet to have a bad meal at Sardine. The menu is pretty limited, but when they cook something, they do it well."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch was fantastic. I had the Croque Madame. She had the Crab (plus other delicious things) Cake. The Croque Madame was one of the best ever, including those I've had in France. The ham was thick and grilled so that there were delicious charred parts. The béchamel was top notch. I have no idea why they include frites.. completely unnecessary, but they were great too. The crab cakes were crispy on the outside and smooth savory deliciousness all the way through. We're at four stars only because the service was super slow and the ambiance suffered from overcrowding. I think we spent about an hour and a half with no appetizers and no dessert. It took us forever to get drinks, though they were strong enough. One other note for Sardine - the tables are really packed in there. We were next to a family with kids and had to protect our drinks and food multiple times from people moving around. Give us a little space, eh? Overall, will definitely be back. And despite wanting to try other things on the menu, will most likely repeat my last order."}
{"text":"I've only come to Sardine for brunch and keep meaning to head back there for dinner but I just haven't had time.   Overall, I really enjoyed my visits.    Brunch is usually crowded so make a reservation (especially during prime dining times!).   If you don't have one, you may be waiting for a while but grab a drink and take a look at the menu.    I give the staff credit as they do a pretty good job getting the unreserved in as soon as possible.   I like to sit either at the bar or at the pub tables in the bar room.  I love the vibe in the bar room.  The views of the lake are wonderful so I will have to try and snag a table in the dining room some time. Their bloody's are quite good and they have a very interesting beer selection.  Food wise, I've tried lots of items but my favorites were the Norwegian salmon, Warm Duck Confit salad, & Braised pork sandwich.  Sardine remains one of my \"go to\" Brunch spots when I'm in Madison!"}
{"text":"The ambience and gorgeous lakefront view makes Sardine a great dining experience however the food is just so-so."}
{"text":"Quite delicious for brunch. I am not normally a sweet breakfast food person, however the buckwheat waffle with a mimosa seems to be a perfect combination."}
{"text":"Second time at Sardine.  We got there early to have a drink.  Honestly, it was difficult to decide...do I want wine?  Do I want beer?  Do I want a signature drink?  I chose the Inspector Clouseau.  Delish!  We all got the wild mushroom soup.  OMG A-mazing.  You have to get that soup when they have it.   I ordered the steamed mussels.  I literally could have drank the broth.  The mussels are perfectly steamed.  And you get a large portion of frites.  My husband got the hanger steak and it was like butta.  We got a side of sautéed broccoli rabe.  Very nice.    I can't wait to return in the summer when we can sit outside for a view of the lake."}
{"text":"Brunch was quite nice. Solid omelet and frittata special. Very good bloody mary. Nice seats outside, although view hampered by plants."}
{"text":"the food is so so, not very surprising to me, and I forgot what's the taste right after I walked out the restaurant. The plates are so ugly that I don't want to use them and see them in my life time again. Service is just fine due to too many people."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner at Sardine. The waiter was very helpful especially when we were ordering oysters! I have been to Sardine a few times and the service and ambiance are always great. It's a great place to go with a group or a dinner for two. The brunch is also great."}
{"text":"Just moved here from Miami via NYC. I've been to a lot of great restaurants and not so great. Sardine at least for a dinner unfortunately will not get high marks which is too bad because the service was so horrendous it \"over-powered\" the actually decent dishes. Wow talk about a disaster in service it really made me think my goodness if I had probably had a nirvana experience with a dish I would have to drag myself back here to bare the service to eat here again."}
{"text":"Food was excellent. Great service. Nice wine Selection."}
{"text":"I've been to the Sardine for both brunch and dinner. My recommendation; come for the brunch, pass the dinner.   Brunch here is delicious- their Bloody Mary's are excellent. I had a pork sandwich, which came with frites and greens; everything was delicious! Service was very attentive and friendly, and prices were very fair for the quality of the food. Portions were huge: I had enough left over for lunch the next day.  Expect to pay twice the amount for dinner without an increase in quality or size. I went with a group of friends. We had a round a drinks before dinner and shared a cheese platter. Drinks were all good. The cheese platter, be warned, isn't your typical cheese/crackers/bread plate that we expected. We got four little chunks of cheese (not even a mouthful apiece), 4 grapes and 4 minuscule slices of pear. I think it was $15- you're really paying for the experience more than the food, and the cheese wasn't even that good.   For my entrée I got the Hanger Steak. For $30 I expected more. The meal consisted of 5 small slices of meat on some soggy greens with a piece of crusty bread. NOT worth it- the steak was well cooked, but there wasn't nearly enough of it to justify the price. With no real sides, I was highly disappointed I paid that much for so little. All the people at my table were shocked at how disappointing my meal was. 2 of the other people in my party got the mussels/frites which they seemed to enjoy- portions were good and price was fairer than my steak. My other friend got the trout, which was pricy but tasty.   Overall, I highly recommend the Sardine for their brunch, but recommend staying away for dinner unless you're really looking for something spendy. Atmosphere is nice and the restaurant is really gorgeous, but I definitely won't be back for dinner after that disappointing experience."}
{"text":"I went for a late brunch with some friends and was pretty disappointed. At one in the afternoon the place was half empty (which probably should have been a warning), but the waiter was still so preoccupied that it took thirty minutes to get our drinks. Once they were delivered, our waiter vanished for another long stretch of time.   Our group ordered some burgers and the duck confit salad. The burgers were absolutely amazing and generously portioned, but the duck confit salad was insultingly stingy. It consisted of a sparse handful of green beans and endive leaves, five potato chips, and a bit of duck. Any time a dish comes with frisée, I expect it will be more on the dainty side, but this was ridiculous. Hamburgers should not be the highlight of a French restaurant. Save yourself the money and eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"Best steak I had in Madison.  It was done medium rare,wine is very very good and pasta is always al dente."}
{"text":"From the moment my husband and I stepped into the restaurant we felt a snobbish vibe. We walked in not knowing where the host stand was (it's in the middle of the restaurant) and the waitstaff ignored us. When we finally asked a waitress if we could sit outside she said we had to see the host, and then pointed us to the imperious looking host at the inconveniently located host stand. When we approached him there was no hello, just an imperious look. We asked if we could sit outside. The host's only words were \"are you going to eat?\"  I said yes, and he showed us to a table outside. It took too long for a waiter to grace us with a word. I asked for a glass of the specially priced wine and was told I could only get the \"special price\" if I sat at the bar. I HATE THAT. Well, since I was thirsty I ordered full price wine (it was before 5:30 after all).  My husband and I both ordered the caesar salad, which was very good, and a good sized portion. We also both had the fish of the day. When the fish arrived it looked huge but upon further inspection the size of the fish was miniscule compared the oily bread the fish was served on. The fish was tasty, but the \"bread bed\" on which it was placed was untouched by both of us; it was slathered with aioli and over the top greasy. The asparagus that it was served with was too large and stalky, i.e. not tender. Two entrees and two drinks, with tip, $80. Too much for a so-so experience. Sardine was much better when it first opened: more friendly, better food."}
{"text":"A great place to go if someone else is paying. Great sea food, excellent decor and if you reserve, a view of lake Monona."}
{"text":"Outstanding...excellent service, delicious food, nice atmosphere. Definitely going back there."}
{"text":"If I was judging on ambiance alone, this place would easily get 5 stars.  It used to be our go-to place to bring out of towners for a nice night out to dinner (pre-Graze).  And truly, I have not had a bad dinner here (though I will always miss the skate wing!).  My issue with this place comes with the Brunch.  The best service we have received for brunch has been \"acceptable\".  What I don't understand is why their brunch chef cannot cook an egg.  I enjoy the yolk runny, and I guess the only way to get them this way is to specify barely over easy or sunny side up.  Poached was almost hard boiled, and even when I asked specifically if the baked eggs had runny yolks, I got overcooked eggs.  And for the prices here, I expect more.  I'll still go here for dinner, but there are a ton of other places in Madison I will be frequenting for Brunch."}
{"text":"Oysters. Ersters! Love 'em. Always a nice, fresh, elegant selection here.  The mixed drinks are not to be missed, especially the basil smash.  This is the kind of place you want to order a round, have some nibbles, order another round, and continue down the nibbling path until an entree strikes you as one to split/share, or just be greedy and keep it to yourself. No shame.  The prices are definitely at a \"splurge\" level (at least for us), but whenever the hubby and I do decide to go for it, this place never ever disappoints. The staff is accommodating and friendly, the atmosphere on the deck is delightful. I took a good friend from out of town here as a showcase of Madison, and she was certainly impressed."}
{"text":"We've been to Sadine a couple times, and never been impressed.  The main room is too loud, the service has been regularly poor, and the price is high for the rather average quality of the food and minimal menu.  But tonight was the topper that will prevent our ever returning.  Went for dinner with the hopes of impressing a prospective employee.  The view was beautiful.  But 60 min to get the appetizer, and the waitress made a terrible wine recommendation.  Another 30 min and we finally got some quite average food.  As usual, it was hard to talk over the noise.  After finally escaping, there was complete consensus that we wished we'd gone elsewhere.  We'll definitely do that with the next interviewee."}
{"text":"Great place for dinner or brunch. Fantastic food and attentive service plus a nice view of the lake."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the Seared whitefish, shrimp and wild rice dumplings, sauteed baby bok choy, shiitake mushrooms and sherry cream sauce.  They provide a small carafe of water on the table."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Sardine for both brunch and dinner for awhile, and just ended up there twice in quick succession. One time out of the recent two, I needed a reservation for 12 that happened to change twice. Everyone I talked to was great, no problems with the changes, and the hostess set our table a bit apart from the Saturday night holiday madness. While I wouldn't say that the food tends to arrive quickly, I've always had good service (even with the group of 12), nice recommendations, and good advice on ingredients or substitutions when I've asked. I don't eat red meat, so that's always appreciated.  While it gets loud at busy times (and it does get busy), I like the industrial/bistro atmosphere, and especially the view over the lake. Ask for a table near the lake windows (or, when it's warm, the outside tables!) for a bit more intimacy. There's a wide selection of beers and wines, including reasonably priced and quite good house wines, and some lovely specialty cocktails.  For appetizers, I've recently ordered the picollo fritto and the cheese plate. Recent unexpected favorites among the picollo fritto items have been fennel and lemon. The cheese plate had a nice variety of cheeses, many of them local -- cheddar, blue, chevre, etc -- as well as fruit and a unexpectedly delish vegan \"salami\" made out of figs and nuts. I had salad and fish for dinner on both of my recent visits (the salmon once and the mahi mahi once), and both were fresh, grilled nicely, and clearly served quickly. Well marinated, hot, moist, and flaky. The lentils that came with the salmon were a bit on the salty side, but the bok choy & fennel with the mahi were a lovely sweet-and-sour complement. Yum. My husband is a fan of their cassoulet and their steak (although, warning, the steak does come with both frites and butter). Overall, their fish seems reliably great, but I haven't been thrilled with their pastas when I've tried them in the past. The orechiette sauce, for instance, is oily and a bit too heavy on the garlic and olives, which overwhelms the broccoli rabe and tomatoes. Sad, because I adore a good broccoli rabe. As far as desserts, I've tried a bunch of different items, all good. The chocolate cake and the sorbets (rotating, often in unusual flavors like olive oil or buttermilk) are favorites.  So: while I wouldn't say that everything is fabulous at Sardine (hence the 4 stars), there are a lot of very good options. It's a nice place with a good vibe, accommodating of large or small groups, and definitely on my Madison favorites list. It's worth the trip (or a few!)."}
{"text":"Hi -  We came here to meet friends on Sunday Brunch after the Madison Marathon.  First - the address \"617\" points you to the \"entrance\" at 617 Willy st - which is NOT a real entrance.  Wish they had a small friendly sign to inform you to \"walk around\" to the lakeside \"real\" entrance... we gueassed at that.  We were here for the Brunch time eats... after the Marathon. Had a small group, and a rez - and were quickly seated - not crowded anyway.   Our server was \"Spencer\". Everything was pretty much fine, except for Specncer. We order drinks - he forgot two - had to be reminded. We order our lunch time meals... ie - Omelettes with spring salad and frites Spinach, roasted cherry tomatoes, goat cheese and bacon * 10 This was really good - finished it all - and the \"french fries\" (frites) are real thin and crunchy - great.  Some others had sandwiches - some had the Frittata - all were  good  Various plate servers brought out our meals, but Spencer was not to be found. He never came over to see how things were going, etc...  Next was dessert - we flagged Spencer, and all ordered things to share. All were great - but he mixed up one order.... we didn't bother at this point.  SO - for our Brunch, it was a really nice time, great and unusual pairings for the lunch time menu....  Everything would have been great - except for Spencer.  We then had a table discussion about the \"tip\".... since the bill was over $100. How do you communicate your \"rating\" to the server ? Do you chat, write on receipt, talk to mgr, what ? I felt sorry - paid the total bill - and left a 12% tip"}
{"text":"I've been to this place many times, most often meeting friends for drinks. At times, the house red wine has been nearly undrinkable, and I'm pretty easy to please with wine. I ate dinner there with a group of 6 about a year ago, and we all agreed that the seafood did not taste fresh at all and the dishes were not creative or really very flavorful. I probably should have learned my lesson, but I went back recently to try their happy hour oysters. I received a plate of east coast oysters, many of which were so small that they didn't even appear to have anything in the shell. Most places would give these away as an extra on the plate for free.   It's too bad- this place has great ambiance, and they usually have a good tap list of beers, but don't bet on the food. I'm amazed at the rave reviews I always see..."}
{"text":"I love Sardine. My husband and I moved away from Madison a few years ago and Sardine is the standard against which we measure all restaurants. In addition to the great food, cocktails, and amazing staff, it's the large bar area that really makes this place. The white table cloths are nice every once and a while, but the bar is the perfect place to sit on a Thursday night for dinner or just drinks. They also have a great range of food options at different price points."}
{"text":"If you're looking for brunch in Madison, this is it. Come right at 9, or make a reservation, to get a seat by the windows.   The special this morning was a dish of baked eggs over tomato ratatouille with pesto and parmesan, served with crostini. Everything about it was perfect.   Husband got a half-dozen oysters, three of their four varieties, and was sequentially impressed with each pair. The plate of cured meats, olives, and duck liver mousse might have been the best thing he's eaten all week. He's currently spooning the mousse out of the small bowl because he's out of bread but he can't stop eating it. Meats were perfect and sliced just right.   The atmosphere is light and airy. The staff is knowledgable and very obliging. If I could start every day with brunch at Sardine I would be perfectly happy forever."}
{"text":"There have been very few places where cheese plate, salad, drinks, main course, and dessert were perfect and didn't have any excess silly ingredients that nicer places are apt to throw in there for prestige, but Sardine is one of those places. The price isn't out of this world either, and the atmosphere is posh and mature, unlike a lot of places downtown.  Try their seasonal artisan cheese plate from Fromagination and their salads with arugula--excellent on the palate!   Sardine is perfect for birthday dinners and anniversary dinners if you want a step down in price from L'Etoile. And clientele and servers are dressed nicely! Well played, Sardine, well played."}
{"text":"Great vibe inside and one of the few places in Madison where you can eat 'near' the water. Only a few tables outside.  Good seafood menu"}
{"text":"The best grilled salmon in the world but the last time I went there I didn't have a good Shirley temple"}
{"text":"Food quality was OK, but The dishes are over priced. The service was mediocre; you would expect much better service for the price you pay. Looks like they don't put much effort in their dessert and coffee; they just focus on main dishes.  The duck confit was supposed to be wam, but was cold and the meat was very dry! I thought duck meat is tender and has fat. My mom had the beef cheeks and she liked it; I tried some; it was good! The lemon tart had an artificial taste: too citrusy and sweet at the sane time; not sure if they made from scratch. The parts with whipped cream was better because it balanced the taste. We also got an appetizer, melted goat cheese and toasted bread which tasted good but was a bit too heavy for an appetizer.  Location wise, the lake view is nice! And the ambience is OK! It was cold inside; so we were cold the whole time. Outside was chilly too, so we couldn't switch our seating area. The server brought ice water, we had to ask her to change to water with no ice. Its good if she asked in advance so wouldn't be a hassle for her.  Don't order coffee at this place, you will be disappointed! My mom ordered coffee and they gave a her cold coffee from a container! She asked the server to change it; the second time it was warm, but not freshly brewed!"}
{"text":"Upon recommendation from a friend of my son we made reservations last night. Nothing until 8:30 but she said there was a bar. When we arrived around 7:45 it was three deep at the bar and it took a while to get the attention of a server. With drinks in hand finally we were positioned just right to make a table coup in the bar area. Honestly these were probably the best sets in the house because they're taller and you can see more. So slightly after 8 we were ready to start...  Jessica brought menus and was totally okay with us ordering one course at a time, never rushing the experience.  She was also very diligent in double- and sometimes triple-checking with the kitchen to respect our allergy requirements.  If you've ever heard, \"Um, yeah, we'll try,\" you know this is a big deal.   We started with salads - I loved the mâché with fennel and oranges, and my son moved unenthusiastically through his house salad. We both ordered the roasted half chicken. I had the frites (yum) and he the Parmesan polenta (also YUM). They have a terrific selection of rosé wine, and on a super hot day it was the perfect accompaniment to our meal. Dessert was a gorgeous lemon tart that he inhaled.   The place was near-empty by 9:30, so we decided to stay for a nightcap.  Here was my only disappointment for the night: when I asked for an apertif menu (which seemed reasonable since they had a pretty extensive bar), all she could recommend was Riesling or prosecco. I was hoping for a unique brandy, or even a simple glass of port. Room for improvement there.   The atmosphere was fantastic. Would highly recommend, with your expectations realistic."}
{"text":"The family, girlfriend, and I went there for bruch. They did a great job of converting the old factory beautiful dining space, and the view of Lake Monona is spectacular.   I had the spinach and cherry tomato omelet, which was great. So did my sister, and the waitress made a big fuss about getting her a whole new meal when a small bug was found in the greens. Not that it bothered us, we're used to that with organic vegetables, but it showed they have committeed service. They also appear to have a good bakery selection.  Brunch is very reasonably priced, which is why we went early in the day. I still can't open up my wallet for dinner there."}
{"text":"Overrated. Staff is sweet and fast for groups. However, the menu is overpriced, especially at brunch. The seafood cakes are not light and bursting with seafood goodness, rather deep fried and odd. The waffles are bigger than the photos appear, but still for the price... Try elsewhere. I do recommend Sardine's Friday happy hour. Oysters and mussels and wine on special. Also, I have tried the duck, lamb and steak for dinners. All were prepared well. Be ready for the steepest playing charge in Madison. Though we called ahead, we brought cake for a friend's birthday and were charged per person, plus."}
{"text":"I've been twice and really enjoyed both meals.  The wine list is fantastic and the bar staff personable.  The mussels and the burger are both as good as any I've had."}
{"text":"This place is adorable and the wait staff are good, which is why I'm giving three stars. I ordered the Baked Creamed Eggs this morning which came with clear runny yokes-clearly not cooked all the way. For better or worse, I ate it since I'm pretty liberal with  food consumption as a returned peace corps volunteer. While I've never gotten sick from raw eggs before, I'm now sitting at home with a bad stomach on the one weekend my mom is visiting in town."}
{"text":"Counting down the days until I can sit outside and enjoy a meal and a good glass of wine. Hurry up summer!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and ambience. Great service and worth every dollar!"}
{"text":"Sardine had all the makings of an excellent dining experience, but it fell a bit flat in my opinion.   As a visitor to Wisonsin, I was very excited to see a Cheese Plate appetizer and ordered it immediately. When it arrived, I was SUPER disappointed that not ONE of the cheeses on the cheese plate was made in WISCONSIN! How do you have a cheese plate in the CHEESE STATE and not represent your own products?   As for appetizers, the scallops were tasty but TINY. And an odd number of scallops (3), makes it difficult to share. The smelt was interesting and pretty good, not something I had had before.   I had a salad as well and the dressing was really too oily.   Overall, I was not impressed with Sardine. Especially due to the lack of Wisconsin cheese on the cheese plate!"}
{"text":"I'll be honest - I haven't always had the best luck at Sardine. I've been there twice for dinner and both times, things were off. A salad was missing an item listed prominently on the menu, a creme brûlée inexplicably had salt on top (I'm talking a LOT of salt - as if they'd grabbed the salt instead of the sugar when caramelizing). So when a friend suggested having brunch there, it was with misgivings that I said yes.  Maybe Sardine is just better in the daytime, maybe the beautiful natural light in the restaurant blinded me, maybe the Bloody Mary adjusted my attitude, but I enjoyed this visit very much. I had the mussels and frites, with a side of bacon. Yeah, okay - that's happy food to begin with. But this was delicious. The fries were thin and nicely browned, the mussels were cooked perfectly and the bacon was nice and crispy.   I thought the vaunted Bloody Mary (or \"vodka salad,\" as my friend called it) was just so-so. Points for horseradish and beer back, though.  I'm still not sure I'd do dinner again at Sardine, but they've definitely won me over on the brunch side of things!"}
{"text":"Mastering the art of French cooking. Mussels w/ frites are required, regardless of what else you order. The sauce they come in is so simple, yet so perfect. You'll want to soak it up with the bread and ignore the margarine spread altogether. The chicken paillard was cooked to perfection, with a crispy exterior and a juicy center, done evenly throughout the cut. I'd never had ratatouille before, but theirs is delicious with a nice tang."}
{"text":"Hands down THE best restaurant in Madison.  I have been dining here since it opened and am so thankful this restaurant graces this city with its presence. I noticed I have done them a disservice by not writing a review sooner. Every single time I have dined at Sardine's I have not been disappointed, except for once. I let management know and they were immediately responsive and rectified the situation. Leave it to a truly outstanding restaurant to handle things properly. This is a special occasion place and not a day goes by I don't wish I could indulge in some of their delicious butter that accompanies the bread basket, their moules et frites bathed in a delicate white wine broth or a glass of their Provencal cocktail. The items on their menu will awaken the lesser known fifth flavor (after sweet, salty, bitter and sour) of \"umami\", deliciousness that is unbeatable. Bon appetit!"}
{"text":"Sardine is my brunch go to spot. They have good cocktails and great breakfast food.  Today I had the pulled pork sandwich with egg, tomato and frise on sourdough. It was great and quite filling. I took half home.  Another favorite of mine is the buckwheat waffles.  The orange cinnamon butter is excellent and makes the dish. In the summer it comes with fresh berries.  I have had great dinners here as well."}
{"text":"I'm a brunch girl,  so that's what I've tried here!   Yum! The arugula omelette was really good--better than what I make it home, but it also had a hefty dose of butter and cheese (maybe not so good for my arteries...). The accompanying side salad was nothing to write home about, but nice to get some greens in!  At first, their bloody mary seemed pretty run-of-the-mill. However, by the end of the meal, I felt like I was floating...pretty strong for just one bloody! Sneaky, sneaky Sardine!  Most impressively--my brunch group of 10 was handled flawlessly--seated easily (I had a reservation), drinks filled as needed, orders came out together, and separate checks given without any hassle. Fantastic!"}
{"text":"This place is great.  First of all, if you are dining for brunch I recommend you sit outside.  The tables have a nice view of the lake and it's always a pleasant experience.   The food here is great.  I have been here plenty of times and tried different things but there are several standouts that I need to recommend for anyone.  First of all for an entree get the skate wing, you won't regret it.  It is delicious, full of flavor and covered in a lemon caper butter sauce that I find myself craving as I write this.  If you like oysters this is also the place for you, they have a decent selection of East and West coast oysters that are delicious and fresh.  For desert don't miss the molten chocolate cake.  Each cake is baked to order and has a wonderfully rich chocolate filling that is simply amazing.  The interior of the restaurant has the feeling of being converted from a rougher old building into a very clean and well renovated space.  The dining room is open and social, and the decor is classy, a perfect place for celebratory dinners or simply a good meal."}
{"text":"Lovely atmosphere, especially in the summer, when you can sit on the deck in front...I also love the well-designed bar...the Roast Chicken dish and vegetable tempura are outstanding, but the other food has been hit-or-miss, often with too much salt, which (happily) is easily correctable...would love to see some new menu items at some point..."}
{"text":"My husband and I heard great things about Sardine so we were eager to try it out. However, we were thoroughly disappointed by our experience. The layout has the feel of going out to a large chain restaurant (like the Macaroni Grill) and as others have mentioned, the noise level made it difficult to have a romantic night out. We had heard that the warm duck salad was good, so we tried it and were pleased (the only positive of the evening.) We also ordered a side of fries, and we got fries that we could have gotten at any other restaurant for half the cost. When we moved on to the main courses, I had the skate which was served with fingerling potatoes and greens. The skate was interesting, but the potatoes were completely burnt on one side (they were served good side up) and the charred taste was overpowering so I was unable to enjoy them. The greens were so bitter that they weren't edible either. My husband got the halibut, which was cooked well, but the sauce it was in had no flavor and did not complement the fish well at all. For the amount of money we spent, I'd much rather go enjoy a quiet meal at Harvest or L'Etoile."}
{"text":"Went for dinner with a group of 10. The service was great all around. Shoutout to the bartender who was kind enough to whip up some sangria on the spot - you should add it to the menu because it was amazing! Everyone was thrilled with their meal. I ordered the lamb dish and it was to die for."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place but didn't and wouldn't recommend it.   The decor is really very nice and lovely. The cocktails were delicious.   The service was not great. When we walked in we took a moment to discuss if we wanted to have a drink at the bar which was pretty full (we were early for a reservation). A server asked us if \"we knew what we were doing\" -um yes this is not my first time in a restaurant. The server at our table was a little on the obnoxious side but okay. I was most annoyed with the check being delivered as our dinner plates were cleared - we were never asked if our entrees were okay, not offered a dessert or coffee menu. Not the best service.  I was really excited about dinner but it was only so-so. My pork tenderloin was very, very dry. I would not go here again based on how poorly this was cooked - the crust looked great but the center of the meat was so over-cooked. My husband had the cassoulet and it was okay but underwhelming. The beans tasted as if from a can and overall the dish was just alright.  Probably not going to go back here."}
{"text":"Yum!  Great brunch and freshly made food.  I have been here about 6 times, and have always enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner once - and was fairly underwhelmed. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't as good as I expected. In fact I don't even remember what I had... and when you pay as much as one would at a place like this, it should be memorable - that's the dinner.  The brunch on the other hand, was fantastic and we intend to go again. Mickey's still beats them in the bloody mary department, but the quality of the brunch menu items are by far the best we've had in Madison! Service is quick and efficient as well."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Madison! Great views of Lake Monona and I love the menu. I can always count on a delicious meal for brunch and for dinner. Love the atmosphere and the service is great. I've taken my kids to brunch on several occasions and they love the food.  Kids can draw on tables with crayons while waiting for food and generally they're very attentive to kids.  Make sure you make reservations on weekends and evenings. Brunch is the best in town, which makes it a very popular place."}
{"text":"Pretentious is the closest description I can think of.  Went on a Sunday night and received my order in this fashion;  appetizer, entree, wine, desert and all within 20 minutes.  $17 for a scallop app which consisted of two, count 'em, two scallops.  Waiter seemed very rushed and put out that we were eating dinner close to 9 at night.  High prices don't bother me if it's worth it, but this was nowhere close to it.  Will not return"}
{"text":"We had brunch here on Saturday. I had the creamed eggs and they were delicious! Everyone said their omelettes were perfect.  The service here is always perfect. It's our favorite restaurant in Madison.  The drinks were also very good. My friend had the drink with beet infused vodka; very refreshing and unique. The bloody Mary's are perfectly balanced; spicy, salty, tangy, yumm!"}
{"text":"A regular brunch spot for my wife and I. Maybe a little on the pricy side, but a nice treat. I'm in love with the mussels, but the buckwheat Belgian waffle can't miss either. Great bar to have a coffee/cocktail at while you wait for your table."}
{"text":"I've been to Sardine several times and they've never done wrong.  Both breakfast and dinner are always excellent and when coupled with their beautiful interiors, superb waitstaff and gorgeous outlook on to Lake Monona it is perhaps the best restaurant in Madison.  The only possible complaint I could make is that the appetizers might be a little over priced but are otherwise all excellent.  And I don't believe you'll find better seafood in Madison."}
{"text":"Over the past year or so I've noticed a gradual decline at Sardine.  Not sure what the problem is, but they went from consistently great food and great service to inconsistent and overpriced food and mediocre to poor service.  I still love to indulge in the oyster happy hour in Sardine's bright, welcoming bar.   But my last attempts at dinner and brunch left a bad taste in my mouth.  My boyfriend and I came in for dinner on a slow weeknight in the spring- we were ushered to a table in a bar, and nobody acknowledged us after that despite our efforts at waving someone down.  We sat for nearly 20 minutes before heading elsewhere.    Went with an old friend for brunch on Sunday- my omelet (spinach, chevre, bacon, and roasted tomatoes) was fantastically fluffy and tasted perfect.  The \"frites\" that accompanied the omelet were limp- overly soggy to the point of being wet and overly salty to the point of being inedible.   I've had this problem with their frites probably every time I've ordered something that comes with them, so I suppose I should know better by now.   Their bloody mary is among the best in Madison (although my first one had a giant chip on the rim, it happens, and it was replaced).    Probably would have been four stars instead of three-  I was just shocked at the service.  My friend noticed that our server didn't smile once, and barely spoke.  Sunday brunch is legendary in the service industry for being a killer hangover shift so maybe that was it, but he failed to mention the specials- we had to ask a table nearby- and didn't check on us once.  In fact, in the hour and forty five minutes we were there, our coffee was only refreshed once and water was not refilled at all! Not what I'm used to in a place where quality service is clearly built into the price.  (i.e. $17 for two crab cakes and a side salad on the brunch menu)  Sardine is going to need to step up its game if it's going to survive the slew of new upscale joints in downtown Madison."}
{"text":"We had our wedding dinner here with a small party of 12. It was wonderful. Brunch here is fantastic with a glass of cava.  You can't beat the charming atmosphere and lovely views!"}
{"text":"It apparently took us nearly three years to return to Sardine for that coveted happy hour! It's not like we haven't been back to Madison since then but Madison is full of great spots. That said, our drinks and meal from the bar yesterday afternoon were exemplary. First of all, the views! Sitting at the bar with the ability to glance out at the water was to imagine being in coastal France. Even though this isn't really a French restaurant, it is French-inspired and that inspiration extends very strongly into the aesthetics, including the music. Just trust me, though- the bar is where it's at. Beautiful zinc top, white subway tile, a very cordial bar staff and then there is the menu. I had the Provencal drink, which consists of vodka, lavender, lemon and sparkling wine. You would really be hard pressed to find a more summery, dreamy drink, which, of course, was perfectly executed. The food menu for the bar is comprehensive but somehow appropriate and the quality and quantity make every selection a great value. We went on a Sunday, so the specials did not apply. However, the prices were still more than reasonable. The Sardine version of a hot dog is $7 and everyone in my party agreed it was not your average dog. My sandwich was salmon, so a bit more pricey but well worth it. And every sandwich comes with their amazing frites and a generous helping of mixed greens. The salmon sandwich is served on toasted sourdough with an olive tapenade. It was really my dream sandwich. At the risk of gushing, I will just finish this by saying that Sardine, at least at the bar, is the perfect combination of European sophistication and Midwestern casualness. It all just works."}
{"text":"Excellent service and venue, food was very good, portions were good,. Prices were reasonable. We had a large group - 13 - and they handled it nicely. Possibly a little slow and we had to not get dessert since we were going to a play. But overall, everyone liked their meal and no complaints."}
{"text":"Sardine is high on the list of reasons why returning to WI seems to be a good idea. I'm no food critic but this place deserves kudos for their efforts and success.  I've had some amazingly and unforgettable pieces of meat, incredible sides and salads, and lovely wines here. Sardine has quickly become a necessary stop on my visits to Madison.  My understanding is that one of the owners or chefs worked at Zuni Caffe in San Francisco. It doesn't surprise me because it has the same fresh take on traditional fare.  In addition to the excellence above, Sardine has a warm and inviting atmosphere. Its busy, maybe a bit noisy, but the energy of the space is contagious. But you won't be feeling claustrophobic in this place. There is plenty of breathing room.  Anothe important point to mention is the hospitality and proficiency of Sardine's staff. Their exceptional service lends itself to an extended evening, including bellying up to the bar to taste the bartenders concoctions and hanging with this friendly crowd."}
{"text":"Sardine is our go-to brunch spot. It's always busy but if you call the night before or morning of for a noon-ish spot you're good. Tie for best Bloody Mary in the city with Graze. Food is great bistro Belgian-style fare (muscles, frites, etc.), great oysters as well. Decor is a similar French/Belgian seaside bistro feel, with lots of light. Staff is always great."}
{"text":"The food was good, but was overpriced-- Cheese appetizer plate--$15----3 tiny pieces, no crackers or bread, 3 slivers of apple & 5 grapes. REALLY?"}
{"text":"Fantastic location, just steps from the water and the building itself it very nice as well.  We go mostly for the oysters, they have several varieties (the East Coast being my favorite).  Casual and trendy, worth a visit."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a lot and had great meals, but on visit this week, I felt for the first time like the food did not justify the cost.  The cocktails were great as always, the charcuterie and goat cheese apps were top notch, and the mussels were good, but the steak and salmon entrees were nothing special, and frites were subpar.  I'm sure we'll go back, but we may stick to brunch and cocktails and appetizers."}
{"text":"Loved our brunch today. We sat on the patio and each had the spinach omelette dishes. They were cooked to perfection and the flavor melded just right. My husband tried the Bloody Mary. It was good but he could have done without the chopped onions in the garnish. The service was excellent as well. Our server was friendly, quick, efficient, and was never intrusive. We are looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"I had really high hopes for this place based on the reviews, but we found it was about as average as most other places in Madison.  The service was attentive but slow.  It took 1.5 hours for our entire meal without dessert.  Our server was also mostly nonexistent throughout the meal and various other people delivered almost every aspect of the meal for her.  We only saw her for placing our orders and for her delivering our drinks and check, not at any other time.  Other staff took care of all other aspects of the meal.  The restaurant was very chilly when we first arrived, so I needed to wear a coat initially (we were told when we arrived that the heat had just been turned on in 10 degree weather!?).  The scallop appetizer was amazing and perfectly cooked, but was $14 for two (yes two) scallops.  My husband had the leg of lamb special and was disappointed.  While one medallion was perfectly cooked, the other medallion he received was the butt end of the leg and was overdone and tough.    My ribeye was tasty, but the cut of meat was disappointing, so much so that I didn't even finish half of it.  It was a very thin steak (about 1/2 inch) and was full of fat and gristle.  I ordered the haricots verts as a side and some were literally crunchy and under cooked and others were mushy.  We didn't send our food back because by this point we had already been here for an hour and didn't want to wait another hour for a new order.   Gave it three stars since I believe three stars is average overall."}
{"text":"Great brunch.  Great bloody (and other cocktails).  Great atmosphere.   The brunch menu doesn't change, but so what. Sardine does it right. Always.   Rezzies recommended."}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY WORST PLACE I HAVE EVER EATEN! My 6-person family went here to eat thinking it would be the newest hottest place to eat in town. It was a failure. We got there at 6:45 for a 7:00 reservation, we then had to wait a full 1 hour and 30 minutes, in the mean time they gave us a \"free\" appetizer while we waited then proceeded to charge us at the end of the dinner... The food was also horrible, it was cold when we received it and it was poorly made. We were also promised that our drinks would be free because of our major delay which wasn't true either.  Finally, the waitress was extremely rude when our requests were made, making excuses as to why our food was cold or not. Will never be going back to this place, Over priced, terrible food, worse staff, long wait, and a terrible interior."}
{"text":"Sardine is our go to place in madison for dinner. John and Phil have created a welcoming hangout that never fails us. On Valentine's Day we sat at the bar in our favorite spot - the corner where you can lean against the wall. We had fresh oysters with mignonette sauce and they were so good and cold and not briny. On weekdays they have a great happy hour so the oysters and the Stella's were half price. The one and only thing I wish were different is the acoustics - it can get so loud. Wait - one more beef; there is this one big booth in the corner of the bar that is perfect for kids because they can't get out and you can't reserve it and that has been made very clear to us by the hostess. So that is fair enough but one time we saw that it was empty and we went to sit there but were told that it was reserved and that really hacked me off."}
{"text":"Simply unreal. Just amazing! Just finished one of the best meals I've had this year. From the first moment I entered the restaurant I knew I was in the right place.   A very thoughtful wine list with some of the less traveled parts of France (Loire, Beaujolais) represented. Fair prices.   I had the salmon, which was perfectly done and deliciously seasoned with buerre Blanc, tomatoes, spinach and tomatoes. Unreal.  Greatest salmon I've ever had.   I also had the chicken liver toasts which were simply outstanding.   Service was personable and didn't miss a beat. They have a gem in Michelle, who was more than happy to talk about wine, and also make some recommendations for other great spots in Madison.   One of the best meals I've had this year. Food and service could not have been more on point.   I will be back before I leave Madison this week.   Fantastic!"}
{"text":"Brunch: Ok, brunch menu is limited for me (lactose). But I ordered their CRAB, BACON AND ROCK SHRIMP CAKES - holy yum. I'm not really a fan of \"fish\" stuff for the AM times, but this was fried and crunchy, good crab, shrimp, and bacon chunks. Tasted smoky, really good, held together well. Expensive, but good. Beurre Blanc on the side, and good without it. Taste 5/5, Price 2/5, Total 4/5"}
{"text":"We made a reservation for brunch for Father's day, and brought in-laws with us.  5 of us arrived there in time, but we were told by the hostess that they needed to set up a table and would take a few minutes.  Fine, so we, including our 8-year old kid, waited.  We could see some one finally started setting up a table for us.  The place was packed, but 20 min. past our  reservation time we finally saw our table ready.  Then, we realized the hostess was missing when the table was ready. When we looked around, we saw her chatting, taking pictures, having a good time with other guests.  25 minutes past our reservation time, she decided to make us wait longer and didn't want us to interrupt the great fun she was having.    Then, it took forever for someone to come over to take our order and took another 30 min. to serve food.  By the time, we were all too hungry and our father's day was semi-ruined.  We've always found the hostess somewhat unapproachable - but she was particularly indifferent to our dismay that day."}
{"text":"The food is excellent, the ambience is pleasant.  The two stars was earned by our inattentive server who had my appetizer and salad delivered at the same time, and, for some reason delivered the salad dressing separately from the salad, and only after I requested it. I'm a vegetarian,  so was interested in the many sides Sardine offers. The braised lentils is made with bacon, so I appreciate him informing me. However, he didn't offer to ask the chef to adapt the recipe, which many restaurants offer. I doubt we'll return."}
{"text":"Yet again, another time I wish I could give a 3.5 star rating. Sardine is a wonderful restaurant serving French/American cuisine just off one of the lakes of Madison.  We come here frequently and my rating tries to serve as an average of what we have encountered. Sometimes we come here and have just an Ok experience and other times our socks are blown off.  I'll start off by saying the decor and location of the restaurant are both pluses.   Wait staff seem to be hit or miss; we have had multiple occurrences where our bread is never delivered to the table, leading us to prompt the the wait staff to bring it with the entree. Timing seems to be an issue as well, where waiters or waitresses space visits to the table in too large of time intervals.   Food options do rotate and we consistently find the steak frites and fish options to be spot on. We consistently enjoy the goat cheese appetizer. Other options like the pork or lamb seem to be cooked past a desirable doneness and poorly spiced.   I do focus on more of the negatives in this review, however, I still enjoy going to Sardine and thinks it's a good place to go on a date, double date, or a quick drink and appetizer."}
{"text":"This was honestly one of our favorite meals in Madison. We started with drinks at the bar and the care the bartender took in making them was something to behold! They were absolutely perfect. It was a special occasion, so we started with oysters and a charcuterie plate. Both were amazing. My husband had the duck breast (he said it was the best he ever had) and I had a perfectly done steak y frites. The waitress helped us choose a bottle of wine which we very much enjoyed.  I highly recommend. Also, there's something about the ambiance that makes me feel like I'm somewhere else. Maybe it's the modern look, the visible oysters on ice in the window. I kind of felt like I was in Seattle. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"A really decent meal, Sardine managed to give me my fish fix, even in the middle of a stark Wisconsin winter. The evening started out with a fantastic Veltliner at the bar, though I was tempted by the great beer menu (Anchor Steam Ale? In Wisconsin?) Then, onto the $35 prix fixe: Lobster and fennel ravioli in a rich, creme fraiche-y sauce really knocked my socks off. To follow that up, sea bass en papillote (steamed in parchment paper) with greens, potatos, and herb butter. The preparation was excellent but the fish could have been a little more flavorful. Definitely not bad for Madison, but not great for the price I paid.  Dessert was a series of sorbets, all bursting with flavor, but a little over-frozen (little ice flakes and such, as if freezer-burned).  I liked it and would definitely come back for lunch, but might hold off on coming back for dinner."}
{"text":"I want to like this place because of the aesthetic, but the food makes it hard.    I eat vegan/vegetarian, so maybe that is why the food I've had here had been so bad. Maybe their animal-based dishes really shine.  I've had dinner here three times, and can't recall anything I consumed. I just remember not wanting to come back.  Most recently I went for brunch. I couldn't order my beloved mocha because they don't have any non-dairy milks! That is odd to me, in Madison, in 2014.  I ordered the cremini and Brie omelette, and couldn't finish it because of all the damn cheese. I was raised in Wisconsin and lived in France, so I know and love my cheese. It makes me sad when people think there is \"no such thing\" as too much cheese. The highlight of my meal was the fries.  I've always had great service and the bartenders have been phenomenal. I guess I'll stick to this place for drinks alone, which seems silly."}
{"text":"FINALLY! A place where I actually enjoyed some good seafood. Being from a coastal city/state, I need my fish/shrimp/crab/etc. fix every so often!  After extensive research, my sister and I found this place randomly and read the reviews and despite some of the negative comments, we proceeded to eat here since the pros outweighed the cons.  [FOOD] I ordered the scallops to share with my sister. It was $14 and I was assuming we'd get 4. We got 2 scallops...and...that's probably the only reason why I gave Sardine 4 out of 5 stars. 14 dollars for 2 scallops?? These scallops better be made out of gold! But...the taste was to die for. Like butta'! The taste was almost good enough to make me forget the price but not really. lol.  My sister ordered the salmon and I ordered the pan-seared whitefish. If you look at their menu, there isn't much selection for a place claiming to be some kind of seafood restaurant but honestly, if you get the whitefish, I kid you not...you could really care less about the other dishes. The cream sauce with red potatoes and mushrooms complemented the fish so well, it literally melted in my mouth. SO GOOD! I got a side of sauteed spinach and it was filled with garlic...mmm. Best combination!   A lot of comments said that the portions were too small for the price but my entree was perfect for my sister and I because I walked away full but not disgusted. (They give you as much bread as you want in the beginning anyway.) Since this is French inspired, did the French ever make overwhelming portions like us Americans do? I don't know. lol.  [SERVICE] The service was very good, considering it was a little busy, and our food came out in very good time. The crowd around us seemed older and a little more refined (60 year old fashion designers or whatever sat beside us) so this definitely isn't a college pub that you can walk in and create a racket but the bar area was very big!  [ATMOSPHERE] The view was awesome, too bad it was raining otherwise I'm sure we would have tried to sit outside. Casual, semi-elegant feel...this would definitely be a great date place.  [PARKING] If you don't know your way around, you'd have to turn onto a few different streets to get into their private lot but it's not too hard to figure out.  [PRICE] This is the only area where I give it 4 out of 5. The scallops were way overpriced even though they were heavenly. Overall, a bit overpriced but they sure make awesome food!  If I ever come to Madison again, I'm definitely coming back here!"}
{"text":"How does this place not do better than #24 on rating  in Madison ?? Wow  Caesar and orange and  water cress salad  Scallop appetizer with rhubarb jam !!  (Amazing)  Sea trout entree (cooked to perfection..) with haricot verts and potato -  Everything was great  The chocolate ganache with hazelnut crunch and caramel looked amazing but we just didn't have the room !! Wish we could have !!  You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Aah Sardine, I want to like you so much, but your food is too salty and buttery, even for French food.  Appetizers: Moules frites: pretty good!  Too many fries though. Charcuterie plate: not super great, and looked kind of unorthodox (lettuce?). Mousse was hard to spread, not enough pickled vegetables, and selection of meats seemed limited.  Main courses: (super large portions) Poussin (aka young chicken): tender and tasty! Potatoes were caramelized. Watercress was a bit acidic and bitter, but together the dish was well balanced. Duck confit salad: very disappointing.  Too salty and acidic overall.  Duck was tough and chewy.  Poached egg had no flavor and was watery on the inside.  Would absolutely NOT recommend.  Ambiance is very hip and chill for both couples and groups, with tables against the front for lake views during the day.   Service was a bit slow, but our waitress was absolutely lovely.    Sadly, everything was great except for the food."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for brunch on Easter Sunday and it was delicious!!! We had mimosas to drink, they had a great flavor and came decorated with a strawberry and an orange peel.   As for food, we had omelettes which came with mixed greens (had a great vinaigrette dressing) and frites (skinny fries). My boyfriend created his own omelett since he's kind of picky (ham and onions). I, on the other hand, had the spinach, roasted cherry tomatoes, goat cheese and instead of bacon I chose ham. It was absolutely delicious! The cheese made such a great taste with the tomatoes and the mixed greens with the vinaigrette. Yum, Yum!  But that's not all, we also ordered the Buckwheat Belgian waffle with whipped cinnamon orange butter, sliced banana and pure maple syrup. OMG!! It's to die for... What a perfectly cooked waffle (which I don't usually like or eat) and the flavors were outstanding....  Definitely recommend this place and we would definitely go back again! I gave it a 4 because I've only been there for breakfast, so i haven't tried much and I did think it was a little pricy (we spent $50 for 2 people with drinks and tax/tip). But really worth it!! Plus it's right by the lake and the sun shinning on my face was really soothing!"}
{"text":"Great place for good food. Somewhat pricy. Awesome appetizer mussels. Takes a while to get the food during happy hour."}
{"text":"If a restaurant's job is to make you feel welcome, relaxed and happy, Sardine does it very, very well. The setting, service, and food is top notch. We arrived early for our 8:15 Saturday reservation and the place was bustling, but a spot opened up at the bar so we ordered cocktails to wait for our table to come up.   The entree choices are carefully composed plates. There was the whitefish, pan seared and placed atop wild rice and squash flavored with chorizo. Light and flavorful. Also beef cheeks, long braised and super tender, deeply meaty flavor. And the moules frites, with the addictive creamy broth. Cauliflower gratin was a worthy addition.   Desserts! Individual cheesecake with an unexpected and fabulous cornmeal crust. But really, the salted caramel pot de creme takes the prize.  Thanks, Sardine, we had a great time!"}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant. Was a little skeptical but was blown away by everything. The duck salad was to die for, steak was amazing, chicken lover was incredible, mussels were delish..."}
{"text":"It's been years since the last time I went to Sardine...and I can't believe I had allowed so much time to pass. I was reminded today of their awesomeness at brunch.   My boyfriend and I got two items and shared because that's what winners do. The best item we had was the grilled ribeye (tender and perfectly seared), which comes with poached eggs, sauted broccoli rabe, spinach, and cherry tomatoes. It's all covered in a light hollandaise with truffle oil. I ordered some pieces of baguette to soak up all of that goodness. The second, also delicious, though not quite as impressive item was the grilled pork sausage. The sausages were pretty good, though the crispy polenta-ish cake that came with it stole the show.   Coffee was fab: smooth, rich, perfect. I had a bloody Mary which was zingy and pretty tasty, with a sweet pickle garnish. Wish I would have been given a choice of beer back (whatever light beer that comes with is just not quite my thing).   The weather was perfect today, and so we waited for a table on the terrace. We had coffee at the bar, and it was only about 20 minutes before we were seated. Not bad for a late morning on a Sunday."}
{"text":"Sardine is overlooking the lake and sweetly tucked in an older warehouse, with convenient parking available. We arrived around 5:30 on a Friday night with no reservation. The bar area was packed, but we were quickly able to slide onto a couple of barstools that just opened up. The bar staff, dressed in crisp white button up shirts and white aprons, were both friendly and attentive, as well as knowledgeable of the menu. It was obvious the very  well staffed restaurant really enjoyed working with one another.   My friend started with oysters, they offer two different kinds. She tried both and enjoyed them. We ordered the Sardine burger (delicious unusual topping of figs) to share that came with fries, the beet salad on a ricotta whip that was out of this world and finished with a Door County cherry cheesecake with a cornmeal crust, which was so light and creamy, perfection.   There were so many unusual menu items to choose from, it's worth a visit!!!"}
{"text":"Brunch. 1pm. Sunday.  I figured we were safe, there wouldn't be a wait so late in the day - \"normal\" people go to brunch at 10:30am, right?!   HA.  Foiled again.  I was amazed to see how packed Sardine was at 1pm, with a 45 minute wait for a table for two.  Wowzers.  Expectations were high when we finally were led to a seat.    I liked the ambiance from the start, warm and inviting yet elegant and classy.  A panoramic view of the lake doesn't hurt, nor does the country-style wood floors, exposed beams and linen table cloths.    We started with cocktails (it was after noon, after all) and I would go back simply for the bloody mary ($7). Just the right level of spice, thick and loaded with all the fixin's, properly served with a  side of beer.    Vegetarian brunch options are either a Belgian waffle or an Omelette, all reasonably priced at $8-10. The Omelette was fantastic, filled with arugula, mushrooms, scallions and cheese and served with tossed greens.  BOTTOM LINE:  I would definitely be in favor of putting this on the heavy brunch rotation. While I don't eat oysters, they offer an inviting happy hour deal ($3 drafts, 1/2 priced oysters, if I recall correctly) from 4-6pm and I love the space so I look forward to checking that out!"}
{"text":"Great service!  Impeccable!  Oysters were great!  Frites were delicious!  Were they cooked in lard? Cause they didn't taste like vegetable oil fried frites.  Steak was great!  Only downside was the skate, unfortunately the expo didn't detect the strong ammonia smel and it somehow made it out. But the server fixed it right away.    They also couldn't combine the tables outside into one and we had to split our group.     But great view and overall good food!"}
{"text":"Sardine is wonderful! I have been here numerous times for both brunch and dinner. Their meals will not disappoint. If you are considering dining here, DO!  Last night, we stopped for dinner. I had their punch cocktail to start at the bar. It was strong, but sweet and tasty. After we moved to our table, the waiter brought out bread and butter. We decided this was not enough of an appetizer for us!  As a table we shared the cheese board and also the charcuterie. Both were fantastic! I would recommend both.   For entrees, my boyfriend and I shared the lamb nightly special and the whitefish. Both meals, so good!  My whitefish was super savory with the skin a little crisp (my favorite). Served on a bed of wild rice with a side salad with pepitas...yummm. The lamb was served with sausage and on a bean dish cooked in bacon fat...so good!  To finish the night off, we enjoyed the chocolate cake. It was just the right amount of sweet.   What a great meal!  From other visits I would recommend any of their seafood, the chicken, burger and also the cheesecake. However, you can't really go wrong with any of their entrees!"}
{"text":"Fantastic brunch. There was a bit of a wait but well worth it! We asked to sit by the window and got a table with a great view of the lake. My friends were raving about the lattes (bonus points for having almond milk on hand). The burger was juicy, flavourful and came on a great brioche bun. The smoked salmon was fresh and very tasty. We also got a brioche french toast for the table which was light and a great way to start our meal. We were just passing through on our way back to Chicago but would definitely come again."}
{"text":"Went with a group for dinner to celebrate a friend's birthday mid-February. Bar was the site of some Onion Beer Tasting event that night and was incredibly crowded, loud and pretty young. The dining room was much better (calmer). Of the 6 of us - 4 loved our food. Most curious was that 3 got the steak frites and 2 were thrilled. The 3rd ended up with a steak that, while cooked medium rare, tasted as though it has been marinated in liquid smoke. For days. When we notified our server of the issue she was unfazed and didn't really offer any remedy but to cook it more (???). This was neither the first, nor the last, time that night that our server seemed indifferent to us / her job / her tip (???).   Service and craziness in the bar certainly left something to be desired but otherwise, nice drink / wine menu, very good food for most of our group (the other person who wasn't thrilled ordered the skate wing and found perhaps that it just isn't to his taste), tasty desserts and a simple but upscale atmosphere (in the dining room)."}
{"text":"It's hard to go wrong here. I've been 5 times and haven't been disappointed in the food or service. The Duck Confit salad is a special treat.  Too bad the outide seats overlook a parking lot to the lake."}
{"text":"Favorite things -  MOULE FRITES FRITES House burger with FRITES  Need I say more? :p Definitely come for brunch, it's much more affordable for the same portion of awesomeness.   No matter how full you are, please please please get the FRITES. best frites in the world. nice skinny and crispy. and aioli? awesome!!!  For cheaper menu during dinner, ask for the bar menu! they serve you all the same. Burger with sharp cheddar is so tasty!! Love the delicious aioli.  Also, try the lobster croquettes. very nice batter crust, and very soft and creamy lobster inside!!!   For others with a sweet tooth during brunch, get the waffles. really tasty!  Parking lots available, usually not a problem to find parking.   Tends to get busy during weekends, so if you have a bigger group, CALL AHEAD!"}
{"text":"Sardine is a waterfront restaurant with multiple styles of seating: booths, tables, bar, bar tables, and by the lake (good luck, pal!) I'd been here once before but felt like generating another review for visitors of MC3. So I went again, and here I am, writing this while my friend's golden lab is snoozing at my feet.  I had the toulouse garlic sausage for an appetizer and the hangar steak for an entree. Both were delicious. I was a little concerned the hangar steak would be too skimpy, but the portion was just right, and I didn't feel stuffed. In fact, I had just enough room for dessert.  That's when things went a little south. I'd been looking forward to the bread putting that appeared on both online and offline menus, only to be told that the item was winter only and hadn't yet been removed. Uh, hello, it's June! I was partially motivated to come because of the dessert, so that was a little disappointing, and the crepe that they substituted was pretty bland. The worst part, though, was when I asked for a single scoop of vanilla ice cream, and it took like 15 minutes to get there. I honestly could have probably biked to the Chocolate Shoppe and back with a scoop before it showed up. To add more spit in my face after insult, the single scoop of vanilla cost... $6 dollars! Are you kidding me, bruh?!  Overall, though, these are minor, and I do recommend Sardine highly. I'm just a little ornery because bread pudding happens to be my favorite dessert."}
{"text":"My wife and I visited Madison from Phoenix, and met some friends for dinner at Sardine. Wow...what a great spot! The food is amazing...we all shared plates, and everything was outstanding. Really cool, hip atmosphere - great lively crowd and great spirits/beer/wine selection ...we sat on the deck overlooking Lake Menona...beautiful setting. The waitstaff was super friendly and accommodating....this place truly exceeded expectations...2 huge thumbs up."}
{"text":"The Arctic Char is amazing. Wait, everything is amazing!!! The hanger steak, the desserts, the appetizers, oh my! Love the ambiance. Parking a bit tight sometimes."}
{"text":"Pleasant surprise in Madison. Was traveling from Chicago up to Canoe Bay for a romantic getaway with my wife, and we stopped in for brunch. Wow. Authentic french food, great service on the water in Mad town. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I was here once before a few year ago; this time we invited three friends to join my wife and I for dinner.  We met up early on Saturday night at the bar and had a blast catching up;  our hostess took us to our table when it was ready ( very European!).  The main dining room was not very crowded (not very noisy) so we took our time and had a great dining experience.  Three of the five had the Skate Wing special, I had the Halibut and our friend had the Ribeye steak.  The service was efficient and non-intrusive.  The food was well prepared and we all had an overall good experience.  Highly recommended and would definitely return."}
{"text":"I always enjoy this French bistro on Lake Monona. The weekend brunch is one of my favorites in town. For dinner, the cassoulet and steak frites are my favorites. Also love the duck confit salad and the salmon with braised lentils."}
{"text":"I was a little doubtful that Madison could execute French cuisine well, but this place proved me wrong :) The bar area was tres chic Euro with tiles, lights, and bonus points for reminding me of the cute bistro my boyfriend and I first went to on our first date. The squash soup I ordered was a deep orange, smooth, creamy and delicious. To take down its sweetness there was some broccoli rabe puree mixed in. For my entree, I was also wowed by the skate wing garnished with capers. The little potato slices it was served with were cooked JUST right with the right amount of seasoning. If the dish could be improved at all, the skate wing might have been cooked just a little less.   Granted after all this food, I did not have room for dessert, but the creme brulee sounded tantalizing! We also had a gracious, attentive server. She was more than happy to substitute hericots verdes (green beans) for the broccoli rabe my dish came with, making my dinner all the more delicious.   I might also take away this place's paper menus and replace them with more formal ones. Otherwise, bon appetite at Sardine, and you will be glad you came. Sardine is easily one of my more favorite restaurants in Madison!"}
{"text":"Went for brunch today and food was utter disappointment. My smoked salmon sandwich was destroyed by thick layer of mustard. Any cook should know that mustard can easily overpower any dish and who puts mustard on smoked salmon? Overall everything including bread was just dripping with some grease or oil. Huge bush of greens was also dripping with some oily dressing. Low quality food."}
{"text":"The menu changes which is nice. They have a very nice wine and beer selection that also changes. I went with a friend on a weekday and we enjoyed ourselves. Our server was very polite and considerate, especially since we stayed for a significant amount of time. I thought the food was great, and the price was acceptable for what we ordered."}
{"text":"Classy brunch on weekends. Frites and mussels are great as well as heavenly croissants."}
{"text":"I desperately wish I could give this beautiful lakeside spot my highest rating but unfortunately our dinner there last night left much to be desired. Although we were seated almost immediately after arriving (a big plus in my ravenous state), there were no specials to choose from & we weren't given any recommendations for cocktails even though I, for one, was definitely interested. I ended up ordering a white wine I'd never heard of because, surprisingly, there was no chardonnay on the drinks menu. I thought a white would pair well with oysters on the half shell which it did but I was never even offered a second glass, even after wolving down the oysters (which were delicious). Anyway our main courses of salmon and lamb met with mixed reviews. My fiance said the salmon was fantastic (I did have a small taste & it was admittedly good), however the lamb was nearly impossible to cut; it was so bone-ridden & veiny. I actually had to have it recooked beyond the degree I would normally want it cooked just so that I could attempt to cut it. I'm not sure what the problem was but for starters it was nearly all bone and precious little meat. I dare say unacceptably small proportions for a $28 dish. To boot, I got my dish back just as my partner was finishing his meal so it felt like we barely even dined together (you know how it goes with oysters, they are gone in 2 minutes flat). For desert we ordered my favorite, creme brulee. We also ordered expressos (decaf since it was already very late). Years ago I studied & worked in France for a total of five years so believe me when I say I do know my creme brulee! Although this one was unarguably delicious, I would think for a restaurant of this caliber they would know that the carmelized top should be much, much thinner than it was. Suffice it to say that you shouldn't need more than a whisper of a tap of your spoon to crack it, not a sledgehammer. But it was delicious nonetheless. Just not 100% authentic which I would have expected at a restaurant of this caliber. All in all, I left on the hungry side, altogether far too sober side (neither of us were offered seconds, even my big burly boyfriend) and the bill was still $120 (with tip). Ouch. Definitely pricey for the amount of food. I do love & appreciate that we have a fine French restaurant in Madison, however Sardine needs to step up their game. At least my Westie is happy with the two little lamb chop bones he got to enjoy today!"}
{"text":"Had an amazing brunch here on my last day in Madison. It was recommended as the \"best\" brunch in Madison and it didn't disappoint. I had the braised pork breakfast sandwich and shared the buckwheat pancakes with a friend. Their brunch cocktails are also wonderful and the bloody mary is supposed to be the best in town! Service was impeccable. Definitely head here for brunch if you can!"}
{"text":"Where to begin?  Well, how about at the beginning.  The magnificent, hand-crafted, custom made pewter bar that spans some 50 feet of the open, 100-year old plank wood and new \"period\" tile floor with stunning views of lake mendota!  A classic cocktail or wide-selection tap beer with Nate is a must to get you started.  Wine list - by the glass or bottle - is great, too. The menu is superb with lots of variety for every taste.  Try the perfect duck confit salad with lardons - yummy - to start.  The skate wing in brown butter sauce with broccoli rabe and fingerling potatoes is a tremendous entree. There's a great bar menu, too, if you want to make things a litte simplier.  Don't forget to say 'bonjour\" to chef and owner Phil Hurley."}
{"text":"Hmm.... I would say be careful. I gave this place 3 stars because I do like the atmosphere (patio view of the lake is awesome) and I feel like if you ordered the right items it could be a great experience. You could also feel ripped off though, and that's what happened to me. At these prices, you shouldn't have to be that cautious.  The Sardine Manhattan signature drink was very good. Not a huge bourbon fan myself but this was strong, smooth and smelled like gold.  ***Warm Duck Confit Salad*** Saved the meal and a star. Incredibly flavorful. Fresh greens with tender duck, bacon, tomatoes, and a poached egg spilling over it all....oh wow.   DISAPPOINTMENTS  Scallop appetizer I ordered based on reviews and I forgot about the guy that said you get two scallops. At $17, that's annoying. The creme fraiche and rhubarb worked well and they were pretty darn good but I did not understand the super bitter broccoli rabe with it. Meh. To add insult to injury they serve this on a HUGE plate, emphasizing the fact that you're either going to be broke or hungry upon leaving.  Charcuterie plate I'm no cured meat expert but nothing about this was that good, except the pate."}
{"text":"Only been to the bar. Nice atmosphere, good service, not too loud, reasonably priced drinks."}
{"text":"If your looking to splurge or go out for  a romantic dinner Sardine is a great choice!  The food is exceptional and the atmosphere is really nice. The downside is the space is cramped and it's difficult to maneuver around.  I had the mussels and they were amazingly delicious, the frites were cold however. The wine sauce was so good, it made me almost forget about this. The sauce takes it from three to a four star- yes it was that good!  Only brassiere V has mussels that compare."}
{"text":"Stunning views, French Bistro interior, delicious food and wine, do you want me to keep going?  A little bit of Paris right in Madison.  If you are looking for a fun and romantic spot, this would be it.   Service was spectacular and didn't miss a beat, food was presented beautifully and my eyes did not deceive my taste buds or stomach.   Happy Hour specials were perfect.  White or red house wine (delectable), $3.00 Stella's, oyster specials, sausage plate, warm olives and crusty french bread.   Sardine Burger was unbelievably delicious and moist. Frites were perfectly seasoned.  Next time I have to get the mussels!"}
{"text":"We came back for brunch and it was even better than expected. Reasonably priced with a few, well-curated options. The service and atmosphere -- impeccable.   Our out-of-town guests, who had toured several other food establishments in Madison with university faculty,  said this was the best place they tried in Madison. Win!"}
{"text":"We have been here a few time and love the atmosphere. However it can be a bit loud. The food has always been very good, and love the oysters. In the summer a small outdoor seating area is available. This is one of my favorite places in Madison."}
{"text":"After living in Madison for several years, I finally made my way to Sardine's. The ambiance is very homey. It is upscale but isn't \"In your face\" fancy.  I was not impressed with our server. While I was there with a group of friends and we were chatting, we had to wave him down 45 minutes later to take our order. My wife and I shared the honey crips apple salad for an appetizer. I was disappointed with it. The fruit was fresh but it was doused in dressing and it made the greens soggy.  For my main meal, I had Pan Seared Arctic Char. The fish was cooked beautifully and seasoned well. The risotto had a good flavor to it.  For dessert, we shared the banana pudding. This also was a disappointment. Overall, the atmosphere was nice but the food was not impressive. The overall experience was also lessened by the poor service. Maybe a 2nd try will give me a different opinion."}
{"text":"I've been to Sardine a few times for brunch and if I were to review just that I'd probably give it four stars, (five stars -1 for price.) My wife and I have heard nothing but great things about their dinner and last week she chose to go here for her birthday.  First off, I have to say the ambiance and overall feel of the place is amazing. One of, if not, the best dining rooms in Madison. The service was good, not overly friendly but overall efficient. Although, I think she forgot to put our entree's in until well after our appetizer arrived. The table next to us ordered at the same time we did and they were on dessert by the time our entrees came.   The food was, well...disappointing! We started with the grilled shrimp, polenta, and pancetta app. Easily the highlight of the meal, the shrimp was well cooked and the creamy polenta was absolutely perfect. Our only complaint here being; for $13 we thought they could have served up more than two shrimp on the dish. I made a joke that they needed to change the name on the menu to creamy parmesan polenta with shrimp. I mean, what's the food cost on that plate for polenta? About .40 cents?   For Entree's my wife ordered the Pan Fried Chicken Paillard. I had the Pan Roasted White Fish and a side of Frites. My wife's chicken was cooked well and perfectly crispy, but otherwise flavorless. She said the ratatouille was the highlight of the dish because it actually had some flavor. I ran into the same problem with my white fish, it was virtually flavorless as were the fava beans it laid on, and the garlic bread crumbs were almost non existent on the dish. My dish was lacking so much in flavor that it forced me to keep salting and peppering until i went too far and over salted. The frites were cooked well and seasoned properly, but...seriously!?!? Where's the aioli? They serve their frites with, what tastes like, straight out of the jar mayonnaise. I don't mind mayo with my frites but for a \"French\" restaurant, serving frites with a side of Hellmans, I have to say, \"FAIL!\" They seemed pretty popular too, as three of the tables around us had ordered them. An aioli seems like a simple improvement. The portion sizes are nothing spectacular, either. My wife and I shared the frites and were both glad I ordered them. I think we would have left hungry without them. My wife was also quick to point out that half of their entrees are ripped straight out of an Eric Ripert cookbook. She proved this to me when we got home.  Overall, Sardine, we still love your brunch and will be back, but for a nice dinner at your price point...you will not be our first choice, or second, or third. This decision is based solely on the food. Perhaps I should just learn my lesson and avoid seafood all together in the mid-west, or maybe I went into this place with too high of expectations."}
{"text":"I've only gone twice so far and its been an amazing experience. I love this place. The crab cakes are to die for..."}
{"text":"We've been to Sardine several times and it is one of my favorite restaurants in Madison.  Make sure at least someone in your party has the duck confit salad...large enough to share and it is excellent.  My entree fave is the skate wing; a dish one doesn't see very often and they prepare it perfectly.  The restaurant has a rustic converted warehouse look.  Excellent service - attentive without being intrusive. A few minor areas I think they might improve upon: my better half and I both found the chairs to be uncomfortable and paper menus / dinner mats seem cheasy for fine dining.  But an overall very nice dining experience.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"This place is really nice with a French bistro decor. The view on the patio of the lake was really nice. We had an excellent waiter.  The food was really good, with a good selection of side vegetables. The Grenache dessert was unbelievably rich and delicious."}
{"text":"It was nice to sit outside and look at the lake.  The food was good.  The violet cocktail was very good. All was as expected.  My only complaint is this: It is simply unacceptable for a restaurant that calls itself nice or upscale, or french, to have the same soap in their bathroom as in the bathrooms in rest stops on the highway.  I guess it means that the place is wholly acceptable when my biggest complaint is about the soap in the restroom."}
{"text":"Our Supper Club group decided to try Sardine for our February dining experience. I'd heard it was amazing so I had high expectations.  The place was bustling. Lots of patrons; staff were darting about. The ambiance was definitely upscale. Our waitress came by to take our drink order. There was a decent wine list and a cocktail menu but I was in the mood for a Bloody Mary. Our waitress brought our beverages and left us to peruse the dinner menus. I did not feel rushed here. They seemed to expect us to take our time. The Bloody was not spicy enough for my taste, but in general everyone else seemed to enjoy their beverages.  Our waitress returned and told us about the dinner specials. I ordered the cassoulet and the french onion soup. Soup, salads, and oysters were delivered to the table. My french onion soup was definitely spot on. The table seemed pleased with the salads and oysters. After a respite, the waitress returned to clear the appetizer plates. My partner remarked that he had not gotten his appetizer - the piccolo frito. I don't know if I have ever seen a server actually run, but our waitress immediately spun around and ran off to the kitchen. She quickly returned, apologized, said it would be out immediately, and that it would be removed from the bill. So, yes, it was a blunder, but I was definitely impressed with how she handled it. When she delivered the piccolo frito she again apologized and warned us we wouldn't have much time to enjoy it as our entrees would be here momentarily as well. The piccolo frito was very good and I do recommend it.  Our entrees were served. The cassoulet was delicious, very rich, I wasn't able to finish it. Everyone seemed to really enjoy their entrees.   I didn't really pay attention to the bill until after I had paid for it. That's when I noticed blunder #2. They charged us for the piccolo frito which our waitress had said we would not be charged for. I'm sure if I would have pointed it out she would have corrected it, but I didn't notice it until after she had returned my credit card. I was also surprised to see that my soup side, the french onion soup, was $11. They seemed like a lot for soup, even outstanding soup.  I definitely give them kudos on the food and ambiance. Also on the service despite the blunders. The prices were high. This will fall into a special occasion restaurant for me, not something I can afford to eat weekly."}
{"text":"Always love this place. Great brunch. A great Restaurant Week stop. All good.   The duck confit is delightful. This is a good place to meet with friends and family if you can afford it."}
{"text":"Oh Sardine, how have you eluded me all this time?  For those of you that run along Lake Monona, you may have ran past this hidden gem thousands (a little bit of a hyperbole) of times.   Its location is absolutely amazing, but the venue itself is very conspicuous. I almost wish they were flashier, with a giant neon sign that said SARDINE, so I could have noticed it earlier.   Anyways, a bunch of friends and I collared up and came here for restaurant week,    The moment we went in, it felt like we were walking into a cabin lodge that while comforting, also had a modern and classy vibe to it.   I love the red and white brick walls, which accented well under their lighting. Their tables were also impeccably set, with napkins and utensils neatly placed at every seat.  Our friendly waiter came immediately, introduced himself, and asked if we needed anything.   The service was amazing all night, and our waiter really knew the menu. We were a curious bunch, so he basically outlined every item on the menu for us in a detailed manner.   Most of us ended up going with his favorite dishes, and got the Smoked Whitefish Croquette, Duck Confit and Profiteroles.   The croquette was extremely creamy, with tender pieces of whitefish enveloped in melted cheese, all packed inside the perfectly fried breading. There were also some spinach leaves, cucumber and onions to balance out the tastes. The sweet, yet very light sauce kept the plate refreshing.  The entree, the duck confit, packed forkful of flavors with every bite. The duck, having been coated in a layer of fat, was cooked to a perfect temperature, with the meat that will slide off the bones. The skin was slightly charred, providing a rough texture to match the softness of the meat. The duck was sooo juicy, so I didn't even need to really use the blueberry sauce. The duck thigh was also laid over a plate of green beans and cabbage, giving it even more depth.  Finally, our courses ended with the profiteroles: vanilla bean ice cream sandwiched between two powdered sugar pastry puffs laid over stands of chocolate sauce. I really didn't want it to end, but it ended in the best way ever. Honestly, who doesn't love ice cream and pastry puffs? That's like saying you don't like puppies, and everyone likes puppies.    Anyways, make yourself happy and go to Sardines. Like now."}
{"text":"Always great.  Mimosas were really good but the price(s) of a large caught us by surprise after seeing the signs for their Mamosa special, which must be smaller. Main meals or brunch were all fantastic."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  The steak frites was very good, as is the brunch that we have gone to several times.  The belgian waffles are SO good!  I'm trying to figure out what is in them, because there is a certain taste that I can't figure out.  They are addictive!  Omelets are awesome, too.  Not the overcooked, rubbery kind that restaurants tend to serve.  And they come with a salad and frites!  Perfect.    Service on the other hand, is not so great.  On our last visit, I asked the waitress for more coffee twice and she kept forgetting or disappearing.  Finally, *after* she brought back our change, she magically appeared with the coffee.  Sigh."}
{"text":"After living in Madison a few years and almost covering all of the better restaurants in the city, I truly feel that Sardine is the best restaurant in town.  The quality of food is very high as well as the execution.  If casual french food isn't your bag you won't like this; but for those that do it really is worth the trip. Duck confit salad is excellent, mussels are good and well priced with great frites. pork chop is excellent as well the omlettes at brunch. the burger is very good as well--though was a little overcooked my last time there."}
{"text":"Don't hate me. I'm not in love with Sardine.  Positives: 1) Great service! 2) They take reservations 3) Good coffee, unlimited refills. 4) My friends loved it.  I ordered the creamed eggs, which were both oily and watery (runny whites) at the same time. I didn't hate them, but I also didn't finish them. I was quite bummed since a lot of people raved about the creamed eggs in their reviews here, but I just wasn't a fan. With so many great brunch options in Madison, I'm not sure I'll return. Their mussels and frites do look tempting, though...perhaps one day."}
{"text":"This has to be the best restaurant in Madison!  A very relaxed open atmosphere in the Machinery Row loft.  I love the look of the space - exposed beams and ductwork, gorgeous tile and pewter bar.  I also really like the flip out windows at the kitchen - you can look in and see what is going on.   Checkout this article for why it made the Best Eats 2006 at the Isthmus newspaper.  http://www.isthmus.com/eats/article.php?article=5178  The food is out of this world - french bistro.  Don't miss the warm duck confit salad, skate wing, and steak w/ frites.  All are delicious.  I have not had a bad dish there yet.  The prices are very reasonable for someone used to Chicago restaurant pricing.   Newly opened, the place is very popular.  In fact, at one visit we had a 5pm reservation (due to an event that evening) and at 4:45, there were about 10 people waiting to get in!  If you like Sardine, you should also check out their breakfast & lunch place, Marigold Kitchen, which is right off the square."}
{"text":"If you are going for French food don't. The closet they come to French food is their French fries. The bar is great, good drinks, good food by bar standards, great oysters. As a restaurant they get poor marks. The chairs are uncomfortable, the wait staff is too busy to provide good service and the menu is limited."}
{"text":"I really do love this place. I like the decor, the food is amazing, and the staff is friendly. I must admit, I have only eaten here for brunch. The three or four times I've been here I've usually ordered the Grilled Norwegian Salmon. It is served with a poached egg, some beans, a light frise salad, and bacon lardons. Delicious every time. On one occasion I did get an egg that was too under cooked for my liking (runny whites). I let the server know, and I got a perfectly cooked egg in a matter of minutes. The Bloody Mary's are also quite special here. It seems that they put more time into their Bloody Mary concoctions here versus most places. During the summer I always try to wait for a patio table. I'll usually have a drink at the bar. Sitting outside and enjoying the great view of the lake is worth the wait. During the colder months I try to request a table near the windows. Brunch items can run from $8 for waffles to $18 for Salmon or crab cakes. Checks can run a little on the steep side, but you get what you pay for!"}
{"text":"We have been back to Sardine a number of times for brunch and once for dinner.  The atmosphere of Sardine has such a cool pleasant vibe I always expect a more creative experience.  Brunch is good and dinner was fine, just not overly remarkable."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Madison!  I loved this place before we went to Paris and when we came back I loved it even more.  The best duck confit!  The service is great!  The atmosphere can get a little loud but it feels like a French restaurant!  Great wine selection too!"}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere here so much I swear they could serve me carrot sticks and I would be happy.  That being said they have a really solid brunch and tasty dinner.  Love their bloody mary.  Get the baked creamed eggs!!!  So good!  They present everything beautifully and I have never had anything I didn't like."}
{"text":"This place was great. We went for dinner over the holidays and had a great dinner. We didn't get to enjoy the lake view since it was covered in snow, but the space was fantastic. We started with an arugula salad and scallop dish. Both were fantastic. I had the lamb chops and my husband had the rigatoni with sausage(sounded so boring but was great!). We had a fantastic time and would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I think their food is pretty bland in general but not terrible by any means.  The problem is their frites.  They should be brown, they should be tasty.  They are white, they are starchy and bland.  They are not crispy.  They flop.  Brasserie V makes a much better frite.  Hell, Sardine makes a better frite and they are a fish place.  Drinks are generally good.   I would say pretty much everything is more expensive than it is worth though.  Of the 4 french/Belgian influenced places I have eaten in town it ranks fourth."}
{"text":"I wish I could give Sardine 10 stars- 5 for its awesome and delicious and interesting menu, and another 5 for the really fantastic customer service. We arrived half-an-hour late to our reservation, and were still greeted warmly and seated immediately. Our server was thorough and polite, even though a couple members of our party undoubtedly made her night more difficult. On top of that, my meal- the penne with smoked salmon- was one of the best, if not the best pasta dish I've ever had. The place is just gorgeous and overlooks the lake, too. In short- I'm in love!"}
{"text":"We have been going to Sardine since it opened several years ago.  It started out at a high level of consistency and innovation.  And now it still gets a little better every year.  The oyster happy hour, T-F, 4-6pm, is popular.  They offer east coast high end oysters for $1.25 each.  Plus there is a discounted tap and house wine.  In the summer, we love the fried smelt and housemade tartar sauce.  It's plenty for two people.  That and one of their great mojitos and you are feeling summer by Lake Monona.  The roast chicken is a steady desire for many in my family.  It is covered in an aromatic herb blend and rich brown sauce.  Of course the small side of accompanying frites rounds out this comfortable treat.  Their roasted meats are outstanding.  On our last visit we had the lamb chops which were cooked perfectly.  They came with this light and creamy potato cheese croquette.  Sardine has a great pastry chef if you get that far.  You'll love the decor.  If you're lucky, in the summer, eat on the patio.  Yes, it overlooks the parking lot, but ignore that and enjoy the lake just beyond.   The food and service at Sardine are always among the best in town."}
{"text":"I came to town for a brief getaway, and as I was traveling alone, I thought I would treat myself to a somewhat decadent early dinner... And since I am a fan of French cuisine AND because of the accessibility of Sardine to the location of my hotel, I was eager to dine here!  Firstly, the entrances are a bit confusing; I ended up on what I suppose is the backside of the building, but when I entered on the lakeside entrance, it was just a teeny bit confusing as it would seem that Sardine is connected to other businesses as well--the door to the restaurant isn't marked and it wasn't open.  Also, unless there is a third entrance to the restaurant, the hostess stand is located more centrally to the restaurant which is mildly off putting.  To sum it up, I felt as if I'd entered into the wrong door and therefore started my experience off on the wrong foot.  But what I found actually offensive was the desire of the hostess to seat me at the bar and when I declined and asked for a table, she asked if I would be comfortable in the back half (EMPTY) part of the restaurant when there were empty tables in the front (the ones with the nice lakeside view).  Again, I'd like to point out that I was there on a Wednesday and while nearing the dinner rush, it was not busy and I was not depriving any waiting patrons by desiring to sit in the actual occupied section of the restaurants with the nice view.  I also feel like it's worth mentioning that I was dressed smartly and did not come in under-dressed or sloppily attired; reviews mentioned that this is a casual dining atmosphere, but I feel like it's a bit fancier than that).  So other than being a single diner, I'm not quite sure why I was made to feel as if I didn't belong in the front half of the restaurant, a feeling that was further reinforced by the mostly cool service of my waiter, who was not welcoming and did not enhance my experience either; I realize, from past experiences as a server myself, that one might not have high hopes for a single diner occupying a four-top in your section, but it was not as if I sat for hours, subsiding on complimentary bread and water and not ordering any big ticket items.  Also, some of the items I ordered were items that one would usually offer more information about--I would have loved to have known exactly what type of oysters were being served, and a few more details about the 'local meats' of the charcuterie plate as well.  Other than the dreadful interactions with the host and my server, everyone else I encountered--the many folks who delivered and then cleared finished plates--were perfectly pleasant and warm.  I also appreciated the very adorable flower arrangements on the table, and the view is quite lovely.  The local charcuterie plate was incredible (I supped on that and a green salad), and although we're quite far from any oceans in Wisconsin, the oysters were fresh, the presentation was whimsical.  I did also enjoy the complimentary bread, though the butter could've been softer (it was rock hard which makes it difficult to spread). The wine I ordered, the 2014 Albariño Envidia Cochina was delightful and went well with everything I enjoyed.  The house salad is delightful as well, but I'd recommend forgoing the chickpeas if you're not a fan of crunchy bits in your salad (I am not).  I wish I had had more time for one of their dinner entrees, but I was on a bit of a time crunch and the service was just meandering enough that I would've been late for my evening engagement had I stayed for a full course dinner.  It is hard to say if I would return to Sardine, should I find myself in the area again.  The food is really lovely, the atmosphere is very nice, but the service I received really put me off!  I did not feel particularly welcome, and that's a big no-no-red-flag in my book!"}
{"text":"Love the ambiance and location of this place. I passed it so many times when I'm headed to willie street or back to john Nolan. But I came here to celebrate a friend's birthday. It was great, she had a reservation and as it normally goes, I was the first one to show up. Since I don't fancy sitting at a table alone I went to the parking lot area that had a beautiful view of the lake. I was here during one of those random sunny days in winter and actually, to entertain myself went on the frozen lake!  Once my friends showed up we were promptly seated, drinks were happily ordered and then food. So here goes:  * Bloody Mary: AWESOME, comes with a beer back and is jam backed with pepper and loaded with condiments. One lasted for a good three quarters of the meal. It was the perfect mix and cure for a hangover * Brioche French toast: for the price and serving size this was great! Sardine has a kind of ambiance of high class seafood but still casual, so I wasn't sure how big the portions were going to be. But with three very large slices of brioche bread that were cooked to moist on the inside crispy on the outside perfection and the sweet aprocote compote, with fruit and you CAN'T forget the lemon zest maple syrup. I was very satisfied with my meal.   My other friends got a wide array of different entrees. Most of them were small for brunch and just okay. I will definitely be back here to try other things on the menu, but so far Sardine has my vote!   Happy eating!"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful group dinner here on a Friday night. The staff were attentive and very friendly without being overbearing. The French onion soup was cheesy and delicious. I ordered one of the day's specials, a lamb papparedelle. They really have such a great way of describing the details of their specials that it's hard to resist! There was plenty of meat in the dish and the noodles were thick and cooked well. I also had an amaretto cake for dessert, which was not bad but a little drier than I expected it to be. Most of the people at our table seemed very satisfied with their meals.  This is definitely a nice spot to go to for a little bit of an upscale dining experience in town. Would be back to try their brunch."}
{"text":"Great service, delicious salmon sandwich, yummy bloody mary's and lovely location right on the lake."}
{"text":"I heard a lot of good things about Sardine, but I don't believe it lived up to my expectations.  My favorite part of my dining experience here was the appetizer we ordered. The sardines were pretty good. For the entree, a friend of mine recommended the roasted half chicken, but it ended up being just okay. This might be harsh, but I would've enjoyed a rotisserie chicken just as much. My fiancee ordered the steamed mussels, which came with frites and dipping sauce. However, I ended up enjoying the frites a lot more than the mussels.  I liked the atmosphere here and the service was good, but the food was decent as best."}
{"text":"Sardine makes any dinner or brunch -- happy hour, feel like a special occasion. The food is incredible. Duck Confit Salad is outstanding. The seafood is always great. The tempura veggies with aoli from the appetizer menu are soooo delicious."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for brunch on Sunday with some friends. There is a lot to love about it (and we have enjoyed dinner here). They were slammed during brunch and we waiting a long time for our food. I ordered the creamed eggs \"medium\" and they were hard. Additionally, I found the dish too greasy. My recommendation: ask for 1/2 the cheese. I'm a big fan of gruyere but this came out like a greasy dish that sat too long under the warming lamp. Our impression was that most of our dishes sat under the warming lamp too long.   One of my friends got the moulé frites - delicious!  I'll go again but be a lot more careful about what I order and perhaps send the food back, if it's not fresh."}
{"text":"I went to sardine with some friends from Chicago, for brunch, and at first didn't get what the big deal was. The place was pretty packed late into the afternoon, but we were able to get a table for 7 without too much difficulty.   I ordered the beet infused vodka bloody Mary and discovered my new favorite breakfast cocktail. Obviously, if you don't like beets, don't bother, but for those of you that can handle, it was a delight!  We then ordered some oysters to start, and they were wonderful. It's so nice that in the Midwest we can get oysters from the east and west coasts. For my meal I had the Croque Madame, which was outstanding. The show stopper, however, was our shared plate of french toast. I couldn't find it out the menu, but the table literally attached the plate once we all had a taste. I think a might still have a scar from one of my stab wounds... WORTH IT!"}
{"text":"Just OK in my book--kind of expensive and not the most expansive breakfast menu (no french toast or pancakes for breakfast?), also the cheese sampler was not impressive at all. slow service..maybe that makes it french?"}
{"text":"Sardine is just so great every time I go there. I had a delicious farmer's market omelette (the special - love the ramps!)."}
{"text":"I hate writing a bad review and don't often have to thanks to Yelp and Trip Advisor reviews but unfortunately this restaurant is not worthy of its ratings. We went on a Sunday night and was seated immediately and our server came over dropped off the menu then disappeared for ten minutes, I would like to add that the restaurants wasn't that busy. When she returned we ordered the food and drinks. The food came out way too quickly at least within five minutes, even before the drinks were served, this made me a little suspicious of how fresh the food was, but after tasting my Monkfish Chile my suspicions were confirmed as the food was just warm not hot so I think it has been reheated. My husband has Steak and Frites and said it was decent. The wine I ordered was an old bottle and off so I asked if the bar could open another, the server brought another glass over but I am 99% sure it was the same bottle.  The bread was stale and the bill came to $78, for one glass of red which I didn't drink, two main courses and a beer and a very quick and underwhelming dinner. Perhaps we were just unlucky, but we won't return and I would caution other potential patrons."}
{"text":"Visiting Madison, WI for a medical conference and stumbled across this restaurant with my gal pal who was also a conference attendee.  We dined on a Sunday afternoon, the place was brimming with customers, and no wonder, the food here is simply delicious!  I ordered a Monte Cristo sandwich which came w a small side salad and a side of perfectly cooked french fries.  The Monte Cristo was huge, thick pieces of bread dipped in a light egg batter with ham and at least two different cheeses.  I ate only one half (had the other half which the waitress graciously wrapped in several layers of airplane-trip-friendly saran wrap per my request), had all the fries and the entire salad and was very satisfied.    The salad had a nice light vinegarette dressing.  The french fries were cripsy on the outside and somewhat nutty, as if cooked in peanut oil.  Fries were probably my second favorite part of this meal, I am a sucker for fries and these were definitely above your run-of-the mill taters.  My friend had a salmon filet salad with an expertly poached egg and she said her meal was divine as well.    If I ever get back to this area (which was absolutely lovely, esp with Lake Monona), I would make it a point to get back here."}
{"text":"Five stars for consistency. Second visit for dinner. Very nice decor/ambiance. Dinner service was outstanding. The food was spot on. Oysters were great. Piccolo Fritto wasn't a favorite but the aioli was good. The chicken liver toasts were very good. The rest of the meal was Duck Confit followed by the Genoise cake - fantastic. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I've been to Sardine several times now, and wanted to finally post my thoughts.  We started with some Steamed Mussels (which we always start with) that come with some great french fries and mayo. Having spent the night before at a Wisconsin fish fry, this time around I tried something other than fish: the Grilled Hanger Steak.  Going non-fish didn't disappoint.  We finished up with some Creme Brulee which was also fantastic.  Additionally, they had a great beer selection which included two of my favorites that you don't see that often...Goose Island Matilda and Three Floyd's Pride & Joy.  Will definitely go back and continue to explore the menu."}
{"text":"Sardine has a very pleasant atmosphere - the lighting and decor are perfect.  It was not too noisy and not to quiet - perfect ambiance.  The menu was also very good - a nice selection of traditional and more adventurous options.  I had the split roasted half chicken, and it was well-seasoned but slightly dry and over-done.  The server was very nice, but also extremely slow.  We waited nearly twenty minutes after our plates were clear before seeing her again.  Reading other reviews, it seems that service can be very good - so perhaps it just wasn't our night.  There were six people on my check, and a 20% gratuity was pre-applied."}
{"text":"This place is ok, but I'm unlikely to go back given how expensive it is.  The food was ok, but not great.  Our drink orders were both made incorrectly (and they were not that complicated).  Our dessert (creme brulee) was warm and soupy.  Also, the dining room was REALLY warm the entire time we were there, uncomfortably so."}
{"text":"Girl oh Girl!!! (or Boy oh Boy...depending on your mood for the day)  I again have nothing but positive comments about Sardine - they have simply one of the best restaurants in town and the best staff.  I had Oysters again - YUM YUM YUM!!!  The bloody mary - maybe it was because I had been at Spin class earlier but those two bloodies I had went down way to easy and they were way too yummy!  The omelet was fabulous----  Look I could get into the weeds with a long drawn out review of what a great place this is but I simply do not need to....  I challenge you to find a way to leave here unhappy :)"}
{"text":"Enjoyed brunch at Sardine on a recent Sunday, during a weekend getaway to Madison. We had heard good things about this restaurant, especially the weekend brunch. We made a reservation and were seated right away, that was a good move, as the place was packed at 11:00am.  The hearty house Bloody Mary was a great starter. My wife ordered the crab, bacon and shrimp cakes, while I enjoyed the Sardine burger.  Food was excellent, service was attentive and professional, and the location and ambience was great.  Will definitely go back next time I'm in Madison."}
{"text":"Cool little place hidden at the intersection of John nolen and Willy st. Awesome views of the lake!!   They have a great selection of brunch items and booze! We got the Belgian waffle and their goat cheese omelet and they were both delicious. Highly recommend the Bloody Mary and the champagne cocktail! Classy take on some common drinks.  The view is awesome but the seating is not ideal. We sat outside and it was a pretty tight squeeze (I kept getting bumped by the table behind me). The service was also super slow, which was fine because we weren't in a rush!   Recommend this place if you aren't in a rush and are looking for yummy breakfast!"}
{"text":"I was happily taken to Sardine for brunch today (Saturday) in which I was in rare form after a night out. We sat out on the pleasant terrace by the lake and it felt like a relaxed, welcoming place even though I couldn't bear to take off my sunglasses.  I ordered the Belgian waffle and my boyfriend had the duck confit salad. I love a warm salad, and this was right up-to-par with it's cooked egg on top. My waffle had cinnamon stewed apples, REAL maple syrup, and some sort of fluffy butter concoction on top. The waffle had a bit of crispness to it, which I liked, and it was rectangular, as if done in an old-school waffle iron-griddle. Excellent! Just what the doctor ordered!  I know that my boyfriend was also thrilled that the well-made bloody mary came with a stella artois chaser...  The service was friendly and the prices were soooo reasonable for what we had. I've only been there for brunch so can't quote on the rest, but next time I\"m in Madison I will definitely be checking out Sardine again!"}
{"text":"Food and portions are good. What brings me back is the decor. You can have a very  have a very nice brunch there where seating is comfortable. The restaurant definitely is a step-up from the usual vibe around Madison eateries."}
{"text":"Brunch...that oh so magical time in between breakfast and lunch...its always a pleasure when done right. We walked here from our hotel and were sat on the patio right away...bonus! After a long night of fun its always a plus to be able to wear sunglasses and the view outside isn't bad either. For this occasion a bloody mary was definitely in order and it certainly hit the spot. I was delighted to find out that it came with a Stella chaser as well...double your pleasure!  We had the Belgian waffle and duck confit. A perfect sweet and savory combo. Confit seems to be making an appearance on a lot of brunch menus these days and as such I've definitely enjoyed my fair share lately. Sardines rendition is certainly no slouch and is, in fact, quite an over achiever."}
{"text":"NOTHING, not a single main dish Vegetarian and no willingness to adapt anything. Fries (OK, they were vegetarian) came out cold and once the waitress dropped the food, we didn't see her. No one came around to pepper the salad (which contained fish) and the pre-ground stuff on the table didn't even come out the holes.   Arrogant staff for mediocre food and service. Could be a gem, but isn't."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the ambiance and the service. The food was great, and the location is perfect right near the waters of Lake Monona. This side of town is my favorite, and I love that it sits right on Willy Street."}
{"text":"I don't like to write long detailed reviews (I'm lazy).    What I want to tell you is this place has a great atmosphere, an excellent menu, an AWESOME bar (i don't even drink but I loved the feel) and a friendly staff...it can be busy so make a reservation. If I wanted to sum it all up with a simple comment it would be - they pay attention to the small details and that's what I look for.   As far as value I may not be a good judge as I am from Chicago...I thought this place was really inexpensive for the type of food and atmosphere. (a New Yorker may even think it \"cheap eats\" but clearly an upper scale place)"}
{"text":"Sardine is a good place to go when you want a decent meal at a fair price in a good setting. Recently we arrived with a party of six on a Saturday night and were seated in the bar area; alas, the service was more bar area than dining room (e.g., the bottle of wine to go with our dinner arrived toward the end of the meal). Though the cuisine is not exactly inspired or inspiring, it is a good place to go if you don't feel like splurging at L'Etoile and you can't get into Forequarter!"}
{"text":"My new favorite restaurant in Madison.  Delicious drink menu and duck confit that was on point.  Will be back again for sure"}
{"text":"What a fun place. Great atmosphere and packed on a Thursday evening. Food and service were great. I had the whitefish and it was delicious. Would definitely go again if I had the opportunity. A bit loud if you are trying to have a conversation."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times, both in which I chose to sit outside on the veranda over looking Lake Monona. Atmosphere: 10/10. I give this a 5 star because it's delicious food and attentive service at an affordable price. Bon appetit!"}
{"text":"I want to make it clear that in any true city, Sardine would get a four-star review from me, but as I become increasingly disenchanted with the Madison dining experience, Sardine honestly stands out among the very best.  I've been here thrice: once for dinner and wine; once for cocktails only; and once for their \"happy hour,\" which includes half-price oysters.  Oh, I'm sorry -- did I not mention there are oysters?  THERE ARE OYSTERS.  And they are delicious.  And anywhere where they are both delicious and half-price sort of deserves five stars for that reason alone.  If you like oysters, go.  Now.  The other food I've tried there was pretty darn good.  The duck salad was the best -- really delicious.  The grilled scallops, also delish.  And the entrees were perfectly lovely; I believe we had the trout and the duck.  The cheese plate and charcuterie were just fine.    Their specialty cocktails are also a highlight.  Don't miss them if you like good-tasting, strong drinks!  Pair them with the half-price OYSTERS at happy hour!  I'll definitely be back to Sardine sometime soon.  It's a diamond in the increasingly-rough rough."}
{"text":"I love this place for brunch. The food is terrific, the staff is friendly and the setting is unique, right on Lake Monona in a historic building."}
{"text":"Love the mussels.  The best in town. Other food options are also good.  I really liked the grits. My mom had a waffle for brunch one time and she said it was simple amazing.    Great environment (although often loud), great service"}
{"text":"Pricey and a bit noisy inside but great brunch. Also an amazing view. Not an everyday place but wonderful for a date, especially on the patio in the summer. Great waffles."}
{"text":"Beautiful setting and good wine list. It's a real shame that they have absolutely nothing vegetarians can eat:("}
{"text":"Best brunch in a LONG time. We were visiting friends in Madison and we are SO glad they brought us here! We were able to jump ahead on the wait list by siting in the bar area. This kept me from drooling all over the pastries sitting near the host stand. Hubby and I shared the shrimp cakes and the Belgian waffles. Both were AWESOME. I have been craving both ever since and can't wait to go back. Service and ambiance were great. We were talking about that brunch all the way home."}
{"text":"This was everything I've ever wanted in a brunch spot. In a continuation of my Madison travels, I stopped in during brunch and loved it. Lovely decor and service during a full rush. I was in a group of 15 and we all received our drinks and meals within 30ish minutes of being there. I had the mussels and frites--so delicious!! I definitely would come back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Sardine is my favorite brunch restaurant in the world. The location is beautiful and the food is delicious. Best thing is that you can start it all out with oysters! The wait staff is great too. Sometimes you need to wait - during those times if you can get a seat at the bar, you can order from there. Go to Sardine! Yum."}
{"text":"Found myself at Sardine with a large group (9 adults and a baby) for Sunday brunch.  I'm a BIG FAN of BRUNCH.  It's the best of both worlds!  Am I going to get breakfast... or lunch!?  Sardine didn't disappoint with the food, as I settled with (and a good choice on my part I must add) the Smoked Salmon sandwich, which was very fresh fish on sourdough bread, and had a hard-boiled egg on it!! along with cucumbers and radishes.  A clever and tasty combo indeed.  They lost a star however for the slow service.  I know we had a large group, but the food, and even the drinks/waters took a long time.  Made the whole brunch thing a long ordeal.  If you look over their menu you get the impression that they are trying to fancy up their dishes a bit, and dinner can run you over $20 per plate.  I like their brunch menu enough to go back though, and would hope for better service next time."}
{"text":"Best restaurant I've been to in Madison thus far. Arrived here after a lake loop bike ride, just at the start of happy hour. Dozen east coast oysters, so very solid. Vinegar and horseradish added so much to the already fresh tasting oysters. Liver toast, chunkier then expected; however taste was light and earthy. Fleur de sal added a lush that was appreciated. Can of sardines, so so very  clean with a perfect texture. Best sardines I've ever had. Service was prompt and genuine. I will always come back!"}
{"text":"Beautiful location overlooking the snow covered lake. My party was lucky enough to be sat near the patio, with the sun shining in.   My party started with these chocolate/walnut pasties that honestly were out of this world. I'm not the biggest chocolate fan, but this dark chocolate was not overly sweet nor bland. Perfect. I ended up ordering the House Burger with frites on recommendation from a friend who frequents quite a bit and it was fantastic and presented beautifully. Definitely a large helping of burger, frites and a side salad.  The waiter was quite attentive, and extremely patient in regards to our late party guest. Did not make us feel rushed or guilty, and always came to check in with a smile.   Great service, food, atmosphere, and location. Just be sure to reserve a table, I've been told, especially for Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"Party of 12 on a Tuesday night at 6:30.  Very good- NAMI MOON FARM CHICKEN LIVER TOASTS baby greens, Door County cherry compote 10  Very good- MOULES FRITES white wine, Pernod, cream, fennel, tomato, garlic, bay leaf, thyme  14  Very good- LAMB MEATBALLS tomato-adobo sauce, goat milk yogurt 11  Solid, slightly overlooked but a good flavor - PAN ROASTED HADDOCK caramelized endive, roasted fennel, potato purée, à la minute sauce of toasted pistachios, orange, and white wine, watercress 26  Whiskey and cheese pairing - all good"}
{"text":"Sardine is awesome. Really cool interior/use of space, cool location by the lake and the food is really good. The cheese spreads are phenomenal and the bread is also pretty slick.  A little tip- the mussel appetizer is the best deal there. I think it's $9 and it's just as big as the entree. Yummy."}
{"text":"Coming to Sardine for happy hour and their deliciously inexpensive bar menu has become a sporadic date night favorite of my boyfriend and I.  We have been in for a nice sit-down dinner before, but are somehow not has happily satisfied by our experience as we are sitting at the stainless steel bar being served by their talented bartenders.    First, the happy hour is from 4-6pm Tuesday through Friday.  $3 Stellas and house wine cannot be beat.  The oysters are also half price. For only about $1-2 per shot, it's a great deal.   If you miss happy hour, they still offer their house wine for a meager $20 a bottle (red or white) and it's decent for the price.   There are several dishes we tend to order on a regular basis.  Though the full menu is available at the bar, we always stick to the bar menu.   First, I must mention the mussels. The appetizer portion of this dish is enough, with the frites, to feed two mildly hungry adults.  They are served in a very hot cream sauce, infused with steamed fennel, tomato, and sprigs of thyme.  The frites are equally delicious.   I am a bit ashamed to admit this, but when the mussels have been eaten, and only the creamy broth remains, I dump the rest of the frites into the bowl and indulge in a little french fry soup.  Embrace the unhealthiness, it is totally worth it.  The Sardine burger is not to be missed (only offered on the bar menu).  Although a bit unusual, the toppings of onion jam, figs, and gorgonzola compliment the fatty beef patty perfectly.   As with all of their sandwiches, it comes with a large side salad and frites.  Again, just this plate of food and perhaps a small appetizer are more than enough to feed my boyfriend and I.    Bottom line- stick to eating at the bar and ordering wisely.  The portions are huge on the bar menu, and the price is right for this otherwise fairly expensive Madison favorite."}
{"text":"Yummy Bellini!  A great place to eat with an awesome view of the lake!  If you are going on a Betty Lou Cruise, stop in at Sardine early."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite spots for meatless Fridays:  a great selection of seafood on the menu, and additional special entrees.  Arrive between 4 and 6 for the happy hour oyster special (there are two east coast and two west coast every day).  Also one of the best Sunday brunches around (can't go wrong with the omelet and frites)."}
{"text":"Sardine is a unique place. Maybe it's the decor or the ambience, I don't know? I do however love the food here. The frites have always been good, they have a good selection of beers. The Mussels are a real hit here. Their is two places in Madison with great Mussels, Bonfyre and Sardine. I've had other menu items here, I don't recall the name of a sandwich that I had here but it was phenomenal. I've also had the Duck à l'Orange and it was hands down one of the best meals I've ever had. Sardine is a great place for a special occasion. Parking is easy and your right by the lake for a nice stroll after dinner."}
{"text":"My wife and I really enjoyed this place. It was our 1 year anniversary, and we both had been drinking at State Street Brats earlier in the day, but i can still comfortably say that this was one of the more memorable meals i have had in Madison hat didn't involve cheese curds.   We started with the oysters. We got a mix of east and west coast oysters. The oysters were fresh, always a plus, and what i liked about them is that they didn't provide cocktail sauce which too many people use to drown out the taste. They provided a onion vinegar mix, with lemon on the side, that forced you to taste the oyster, that is if you didn't swallow it whole.   We split a very simple salad, and both ordered glasses of wine. They have a reasonable wine selection, with good choice. The beer selection looked excellent, but i ended up going with one of their specialty cocktails. I see something with Death's Door Gin in it and I want to drink it.   Our main course were the veal medallions and the whitefish. The whitefish had bacon lardons which gave the fish a very aromatic smell. i think it may have made the dish for me. I would order it again in a heartbeat. The veal medallions came with polenta and was outstanding.   We pigged out or dessert and ordered two dishes. She got the plum cobbler and i got this chocolate log with caramel and ganache. I won, hands down. The chocolate thing'am'ajob was one of the best, and richest, desserts i have ever had. My wife had a taste and then nearly tackled me for the remainder. I had to give her more since it was our anniversary, but i was not happy about it (hey, I'm just being honest).   Service was excellent. The decor was industrial, open and very cool. We had a reservation (i would suggest having one), but they also had a bar at which you could eat. I didn't give it a 5th star only because it was my first time eating there and i need to try more things there before i give it the fifth star.   I highly recommend this restaurant to everyone."}
{"text":"I stopped here with a few colleagues on a random Tuesday. Pretty cool vibe with a nice view of the lake. If you're into manhattans I had two and they were pretty good. I was somewhat hesitant to order some oysters given that it's Wisconsin, but I decided to give it a try. I tried their two western oyster varieties. I was pleasantly surprised and enjoyed them.  For my entree I had the duck confit / breast. Very tasty with good flavor. I was overall happy and would check this place out again."}
{"text":"Great place.  The drinks are excellent.  It's what I would call Alsatian fare, so if that's your scene, Sardine is the place for you."}
{"text":"haven't been here for an actual dinner yet, but i'm certainly excited to try:  Brunch was incredible, especially with the outdoor seating overlooking the lake. I had a delicious omelet stuffed with tons of fresh vegetables and my boyfriend had the french toast- we were both thrilled with the unique flavors, friendly and knowledgeable service, and great setting.   We also attended their first family style dinner and could not have been more impressed.  For $50 each we received unlimited beer (a selection of 4 kinds, handpicked by the owners, and a dessert beer), appetizers, the mussels that everyone raves about, an incredible German dinner, and a selection of desserts...served to us by what seemed to be their entire serving staff, who were very attentive.  It is clear that John and Phil have a vision for this relatively new restaurant."}
{"text":"This establishment just cannot be beat.  Special occasions, business dinners, brunch, any occasion... Sardine should always be considered an option for your dining experience.  Elegance and style with an uncomplicated menu right in our city.  Most recently, we stopped by for dessert and an evening drink this past weekend.    The hostess was kind and helpful when seating us.  Our waiter was pleasant, informative, and fun. My wife does not drink much red wine, but was interested in a glass with her gateau au chocolat.   Our waiter, Sam, was more than accommodating, arranging a couple of tastings before deciding on a glass that would pair perfectly.  While she went for the gateau with a glass of red wine, I opted for the blood orange butter cake with clover honey ice cream that was on special and a glass of Glenlivet on the rocks.  The gateau was smooth and decadent, and really brought out the flavors of the wine.  The butter cake was indescribably rich with subtle tartness from the caramelized blood orange on top.  Add a bit of clover honey ice cream into each bite and it is close to perfection.  Previous visits had included dessert with the gateau and lemon tart, brunch with moules frites and an excellent Bloody Mary, and an elegant dinner with steak frites and cauliflower gratin; in every instance, Sardine did not disappoint.  The menu is uncomplicated simplicity.  However, each dish is fascinating and delicious.  I love that a portion of the kitchen is open so that the inner workings of the restaurant are visible.  Also, for the atmosphere and the quality of the food, the prices are somewhat reasonable."}
{"text":"A very consistent favorite with enough gradual evolution of the menu that there is always something new to try, though it's hard to resist the old favorites of moules, duck salad, salmon, and steak. The special this time was cassoulet, which was excellent."}
{"text":"Excellent location overlooking the lake! Beautifully decorated. Staff was very attentive, but not annoying. I had the apple salad which was truly delicious. The bread basket was generous with crusty French bread. I also had the salmon which was done to perfection. Great flavor, nice sized portion. Finished off with coconut sorbet, housemade and delicious. The Malbec wine was a great compliment as well.  Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Big fan.  I've been here 4 or 5 times and absolutely love them.  It's a bit pricey, but they have been spot on every time.  Their fried vegi's are just yummy.    A great place to celebrate a special occasion."}
{"text":"Mediocre dinner experience. We had a reservation for 8 and did not end up being seated until after 8.30. This was okay as atmosphere in the restaurant is great and the bar was nice too. Service was pretty slow, but restaurant was very busy. Food was definitely well overpriced for what it was, as the flavours weren't spectacular nor were the portions (this coming from a European).   To sum up, I'd say this restaurant labels itself as gastronomical haute cuisine, when in reality it is more of a nice venue with *just good* food. Would probably not return for dinner due to prices."}
{"text":"Came here during restaurant week. Everything was so good esp the Salmon and Duck confit is a must try. 4 Stars for the price (pricey) but otherwise great service."}
{"text":"Wonderful meal! Had the chicken liver appetizer, Skate with fingerling potatoes, Steak frite and Salmon over lentils. Well seasoned, quality ingredients, enjoyed by all in our party."}
{"text":"Went for Restaurant Week. Big crowd. Overall? quite good.  Sardine is loud. Like...really loud. It didn't help that our waitress was barely audible. We could hardly hear any of what she was saying. Regardless, we looked over our menus and ordered pretty quickly.  Service? Very good. Few interruptions or annoying bothers. Water bottles (glass pouring bottles) always full. These are things I notice.  Oh, right. The food!  For the first course I got the endive and apple salad with black current vinaigrette. Wonderful flavor combination, crispy squash was excellent, and walnuts are always welcome! No offering of black pepper? I had to ask. No worries, it was delicious.  Dinner: Cassoulet--duck confit, braised lamb, sausage, over white beans. Duck was bland, which is a shame because it's what I was looking forward to most. Lamb was very good, well-seasoned and cooked perfectly. Sausage was un-fucking-believable. probably the best sausage I've had in my life and cooked perfectly.  Dessert: Chocolate hazelnut deliciousness. Great crunch at the bottom. Almond wafer was superb.  Sardine was solid as usual. I've come to expect this--consistent, consistent quality. I'd go back (and have gone back many times). Of note: bar menu is absolutely awesome. Burgers are excellent. Win!"}
{"text":"For its first year this was probably the best casual restaurant in Madison. Now the quality is down, the service doesn't match the prices, and the cost is way up. They should get rid of the maritime name and retitle as 'cash cow'. Still acceptable mussels and fries, excellent soups, and their ribeye steak frites is possibly the best steak preparation in Madison. Their signature skatewing with lemon butter sauce was delicious--but they removed it from the menu against popular demand.  Sunday brunch is probably its best executed service and the reason Sardine keeps 3 stars. Great omlettes, great sandwiches; why can't it be like this all week, or why don't they serve this menu daily for lunch?   Reservation on the patio with view of the lake is highly recommended for a date, but their decision to go 'high-end-with-low-end-service' transformed Sardine from 'vibrant and full of cool young patrons' to 'old people like to look at lake Monona while consuming veal'."}
{"text":"Really lovely atmosphere. Wide open with large windows at the front. The restaurant is well-laid out and a pleasure to be in. There is a large, comfortable bar, with bar tables set behind it. It's a great space for a group; there is a lot of room to move around in.  I've frequented Sardine for brunch, lunch, dinner, and happy hour. The happy hour is sort of a let down, Stella and house wines are slightly less expensive, so it's still on the pricey side. For real meals, their food and drinks are fine, but nothing special.    Like most places in Madison, the staff is friendly and warm."}
{"text":"What a great place!  Restaurant Week brought us here for a date night and although we only tried what was on the set menu, I don't think there really was a flaw in our experience.  SERVICE: Server did not miss a step. I mean, seriously. I drank from my glass of water and suddenly he's beside me pouring it to the rim. One of the very few restaurants where WE didn't have to look around for our server and wait on him/her.   APPETIZERS: Mixed melon salad (watercress, fennel, mint and balsamic glaze) was perfect for summer. Although I wish it was colder, it had a nice balance of the sweetness of the melons and a slight tart from the balsamic glaze. My boyfriend enjoyed his smoked whitefish croquette (with petite crisp and tangy cucumber, radish and tomato salad) and after having a taste of it, I'd have to agree. It was a great crisp and the flavor of the fish was amazing. This could easily be made into an entree and I would devour it. I noticed they had a lobster croquette on their regular dinner menu so that will be a must try.  ENTREES: Duck confit of leg and thigh (charred green beans, green cabbage, roasted potatoes and blackberry compote) was nothing stellar in itself, but strangely enough it was perfect altogether. My boyfriend had duck for the first time while tasting it and he decided it he liked it enough that he overall now likes duck. \"Tastes kind of like turkey,\" he said. I didn't think I'd enjoy the duck with blackberry compote but I saved it for last so I could enjoy it longer. He had the grilled pork chop (herbed citrus jus, roasted fennel, green olive, cherry, dandelion greens and faro) which I got a chance to taste as well and it was very tender. I usually avoid pork at restaurants because sometimes they're either too tough or too salty, but this was the best pork I've had thus far.   DESSERTS: Profiteroles (vanilla bean ice cream, chocolate sauce) are pretty much cream puffs with ice cream. Blueberry crostata (toasted almonds, lemon curd) was very tart with even the slightest lemon curd but still tasty. Both desserts were very good.  Hopefully next time we can come back and sit outside and try the rest of their regular menu. Brunch looks just as great as dinner. It was a great introduction to the restaurant!"}
{"text":"This is a very lively, fun restaurant.  Don't really understand the haters here; you can do so much worse than this.  The food is good, sometime excellent.  This ain't fine dining, nor is it intended to be.  This is so much like a casual brasserie on the left bank of Paris.  Madison is lucky to have this place!  This place would easily have hour plus waits in Chicago."}
{"text":"For vegetarians this place sucks I think I had to get a side salad ... Not fun"}
{"text":"Excellent food and excellent service.  I was able to make a 5 pm dinner reservation for 3 on Father's Day a week out.  We arrived early and were seated by 4:35 at a prime table with a view of the lake. Though the waitress could not take orders until closer to 5, she kept us watered and brought me two cokes.  Hannah is an outstanding server.  Anybody sitting in her section is lucky.  I've only eaten bread, and it was fantastic. So good that I ate 3/4s of it while sister was on important phone call and she got only 1 slice. Dad got his share.    This part of the meal was so enjoyable I'm submitting the review with knowledge that the main course will satisfy.  I'm have modules frites which is mussels with French fries."}
{"text":"We got fancy for my birthday weekend. I wore the new sweater dress hubby bought and my ridiculous high heels that were not fit for the weather but dammit they were sexy, so we walked arm in arm from the car to the restaurant.  Hubby went all out and ordered quite a bit for us. I had the special for the evening:  scallops, salmon, and shrimp, with green beans and potato. Hubs had lamb chops with bok choy and a little block of fried and melty cheese that he said went well with everything. I guess the French way to say it is \"croquette.\"  Im still working on my French cuisine-speak. We also had the steamed mussels of which were wonderful, and the fried smelt. For dessert we shared the warm pumpkin bread pudding with whipped cream and a scoop of maple ice cream melting next to it. It was out of this world fantastic.   You get a lot for the prices, and it's a great inbetween restaurant. Not as expensive and pretentious as L'Etoile, with better options than what I glanced at from Forequarter."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with some friends that live in town.  It was late for dinner on a Saturday night and we made reservations though it probably wasn't needed as there were plenty of tables available.    Our server was a bit kooky and truly not very attentive.  When I asked for more water, he literally plunked down a bottle of water without offering to refill my glass.    We ordered the charcuterie plate which came with some yummy liver pate.  The mussels we delicious and they give you a ton of them.  The frites that they were served with were nothing special.  We also got the scallops which were alright but I wish that the server had told us that the three of us would have to split two scallops..we probably would have ordered something different.    My favorite part of the meal was the mushroom soup.  This was absolutely delicious.  Very hearty and perfectly seasoned.  The sea bass was on special so we opted for that.  It was good but the portion size was a bit skimpy.  The atmosphere was really cool and the bar was packed by the time we left.  I would come back here in the summer to sit on the patio."}
{"text":"I've been here about 15 times. Only twice have I had issues. Both times it was handled so poorly as though they were infallible. Note my picture of the bill. Asked the bartender is the Herring served pretty traditional?  She said yes to which it was not. Regardless, Two pieces were served, one was good not great but acceptable. The other was spoiled. Almost made me throw up.  There were flies even flying around it. I made a complaint she removed it and took off 50% and stated I said that I ate half of it! She acted as though she was doing me some sort of favor. Pathetically handled.  I visit Madison yearly. And look forward to 3 to 4 meals at sardines in my trip. I only had one. Food is usually excellent, but if there is some sort of variance they just don't handle it well."}
{"text":"Best Bloody Mary!  Awesome atmosphere and view. Excellent food. Top notch service!"}
{"text":"I just went back to sardine last week and had dinner...hadn't been in a few years.  Cocktails are still good but I have to say- it's gotten fairly stale from a menu standpoint.  They need a dinner overhaul.  The mussels and salmon were both fairly mediocre.  Brunch is still pretty strong but I prob won't be back to dinner anytime soon."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum.  Sardine was great.  The service was impeccable, exactly what it should be at a fine dining establishment, with the exception husband ordered the wine and she brought it to me to taste first, but whatever, that doesn't matter.  We started with the scallops, which were two PERFECTLY cooked scallops with pork belly and a celeriac potato puree.  They were amazing.  We were going to skip the appetizer and each have a salad, but were told the salads we wanted were pretty big.  So did the scallops and the warm duck confit salad.  The dressing on the salad was a bit too acidic, the duck not super warm, and the poached egg on top cooked well, but not warm.  The salad wasn't that large, think we could have each had a salad, but glad it gave us the opportunity to try the scallops.  Husband had the hanger steak which was phenomenal.  I had the ribeye and frites.  The frites were incredibly good.  Perfectly cooked, perfect seasoning.  Steaks that we ordered were cooked perfectly, and I was suprised my ribeye steak wasn't too fatty.  The one bad thing was they had the door to the patio open all night, and there were bugs in the restaurant, with my husband getting multiple flies in his wine, and in our water."}
{"text":"Sardine is located in a beautiful setting, right on the lake, and the decor is outstanding. We sat outside and ordered the shrimp and crab cakes and the smoked salmon sandwich. Both dishes were delicious. Service was also incredible, they did not rush you, which we liked as it was a beautiful day and we wanted to have a leisurely meal."}
{"text":"Wonderful happy hour.  Really good food.  Beautiful atmosphere.  Can usually find parking.    Love to bring friends from out of town here, or meet after work and get oysters."}
{"text":"After 39 yrs of life, this is the one place I would come to for breakfast or brunch every day if I could! It has the view, the food, the service and Madison is the best Midwestern city and I'm not even from there but will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Long overdue review from last November.  Sammy was the best waiter... Good suggestions, friendly, just the right amount of everything.  Get the scallops and the house salad with beets.  I believe we had a vodka cocktail with beets, which was unusual and delicious."}
{"text":"I was really impressed with the taps and cocktail options. I started out with a Leffe beer. One of my favorites and VERY difficult to find on tap.   I was there for a three-course dinner event. I started out with the cauliflower puree soup garnished with creme fresh and a little caviar. Wow. Seriously. Did I ever think any of those would make a good soup?  Nope. But was it amazing?  Yup.   We were given an orange sherbet palette cleanser. Simple, delicious and a nice note to the dinner.   Up next, I had the vegetarian option of mushroom risotto. I am not sure how to do this amazingness any justice. Perfectly cooked, rich in flavor and a very generous portion.   Now comes my disappointment. Dessert. You are offering three. One, I can not even remember. The other little creme puffs with hazelnut ice cream and cheesecake. Well I get there for an 8pm dinner. And what happens?  No cheesecake. I get it, you run out of stuff. However, there are only three options. You run out that early?  I ended with the hazelnut ice cream and I hated it. It was SO cold. I get it, ice cream. But it was almost icy.   Will I go back?  Yes. The service was outstanding. The ambiance was great."}
{"text":"Mmmmmm! Went here for brunch, very good.  Sat outside.  Really appreciate the clean french-kitchen-like decor (white tile, dark wood, etc).  Outside area was a bit small, but you can't beat the view.  Went again for dinner a few months later and had another pleasant, romantic experience.  Would recommend for a special event for a family or for a date.  The food was absolutely excellent and the service is quick but not overbearing.  Very classy."}
{"text":"Good service from our waitress, but the bartenders on hand last night were outright rude.  I was guessing that one of the two working the bar was related to the owner(s) because who other than family could keep a job and be so rude to paying customers.  That wasn't just my take, but the feeling of others in my group that ordered at the bar.  Ordering through our waitress was ok, but slow due to volume.  They should staff more than two bartenders, period.  Generally, manners are assumed...teach them some."}
{"text":"Very cool place on the lake.  Nice ambiance. The great creative brunch options were very enjoyable. My french toast was more sweet and solid and my wife's crab cake omelet thing was very good. Would certainly visit again."}
{"text":"This place is popular and busy. I would suggest making a reservation.  I had the salmon pasta, which was pretty good. My dad had the chicken and fries. That was really tasty.  I also had the gazpacho, which was also great.  We finished off our meal with their creme brulee, which was big enough to share with 3 people."}
{"text":"Always an amazing brunch. Oysters are spot on. Burger is incredible.   Enjoy the lake view and beautiful ambiance. One of my favorite eateries in Madison"}
{"text":"Sardine may be one of my favorite restaurants in Madison.  The cuisine is always exciting to me.  I'm always intrigued by how they choose to pair and complement ingredients.  Every time I read the menu at this place, I rarely find any of the descriptions truly appetizing, but when the dish is front of me, it's delicious.  I am always pleasantly surprised at how they manage to transform my meh feelings into genuine \"going to finish this dish even if I'm stuffed\" excitement."}
{"text":"I've been to Sardine twice for dinner and it was outstanding both times. The ambience is upscale casual and slightly noisy. It wouldn't be the best choice for a romantic evening. The food is incredible and the crab cakes were the best I've ever had. I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"My daughters took me today for Mothers Day.  Every part was wonderful from the service to the Bloody Mary and our meals were all delicious.  A must do!"}
{"text":"The location is great, with ample parking and a beautiful interior and view.  Unfortunately, that's where the good parts end.  I've had worse food and service, but I've never paid so much for it.  So...  Service: making a reservation is a pain, they don't answer their phone during the hours they claim to accept bookings.  When they finally answered, the person was less than friendly and seemed to think he was doing me a favor by taking the booking. Once we arrived, the server was scarce, despite not having any other tables.  She only addressed my wife when she came to our table, our drinks were empty for most of dinner, and the specials were poorly explained.    Food: although the salmon tasted good, it was quite overcooked and the overall quality was lower than I would have expected.  The special, however, was awful.  The fish itself tasted like it was leftover from Friday's fish fry and the little fried dabs of guacamole were a recipe stolen right off Estrellon's old menu."}
{"text":"I'm going to just start off with a solid, Yum! This is a review for Sardine's New Year's Celebration & Dinner only.   So what does $60 per person night get you at Sardine for New Years Eve?  The night included a 3 course dinner, champagne toast, and some great noise makers and party hats. I started off with a shrimp and lobster cake that was sitting in the best mildly spiced sauce and pickled root vegetables that I have ever had! It was not fishy tasting and was just pure greatness in my mouth.  This was followed with a sorbet sample as the intermission, again...a nice little treat. For the main course I went with the braised beef cheeks. Ahhh yeah!!! Melt in your mouth perfectly cooked on a pile of polenta (perfectly creamy and seasoned). Whatever gravy/sauce this was cooked in.....it was great!  Dessert...they were out of the offered cheesecake, which I had my eye on....but I settled on some small cream puff looking pastry with hazelnut ice cream and a chocolate glaze. I was not disappointed.   I missed the 1st band (the early band), but the second band choice was awesome! The Tony Castañeda Latin Jazz Sextet. Great New Year's music that had everything moving and happy! Great choice Sardine!   The countdown seemed a boring...but they got it in on time. They passed around some fun New year's Party items beforehand (including fun hats&crowns) and had a great champagne toast (yes, with real glass toast glasses).   For the price, I think it was a great dinner and live band venue for a New Year's celebration in Madison."}
{"text":"Overall a good experience with good food, very nice view of the lake and good service. The restaurant is located right by lake Monona and it has very charming outside seating where you can enjoy the lovely weather and the light wind from the lake. It is very charming. I love coming here for breakfast and brunch because the view is just amazing. Definitely try the moules frites because the white wine sauce is just amazing. The dish is very well cooked and well seasoned. I had the seared salmon and my boyfriend had pan-roasted skate wing. The sauce for both was pretty buttery which made the whole dish so good. I wish they would have put more green in the dish. We shared a lemon meringue tart for dessert and it was not very special. The tart is topped with a layer of s'mores, fresh raspberry and mint. It was too sour for me and if only they made the lemon tart a bit thinner so that I could feel the s'mores. My biggest disappointment is that they don't change the menu at all. It is almost the same as 2 years ago that makes the restaurant boring to go back to. I hope the chef would really change it up, take advantage of the seasonal and local food here and make the menu more diverse and interesting"}
{"text":"Always an excellent choice for a good drink and a great meal. Not cheap, but as good as you are going to get for the price around downtown."}
{"text":"My wife and I are about to move away from Madison so we're revisiting all our favorite spots.  Last night was our 5th trip to Sardines.  Great atmosphere, especially if it's a nice day and you can sit on the deck outside looking out over the water.  Remarkably this is one of the very few places in Madison to do this, and is probably the best.    Better than average wine list, for Madison that is.  Every day they have a different fried mixto platter that is pretty much a lock to be delicious.  Some weird fried things to try on it as well, such as orange peels and fennel.  Entrees are very creative and made with quality ingredients but I have to hold back from giving these 5 stars.  A little too reliant on oil and butter, but then again this is a French style American restaurant.  Seriously though - enough with the beurre blanc already.  We had the Grouper last night which was oiled up and cooked a bit beyond the point where you could savor the true grouper taste.  On the other hand, it snuggled nicely among fried polenta, shitake mushrooms, and roasted asparagus that were all top notch.  In my opinion, this is a must try if you frequent the top restaurants in Madison.  The atmosphere may still make this your favorite place if your entrée comes up a wee bit short."}
{"text":"Mmm, I had the smoked salmon sandwich with cress, mustard, pickled somethings and a hard-boiled egg. Arugula salad and fries on the side.  I was absolutely stuffed by the time I was finished (couldn't quite get through the whole plate).  Did not try the bloody Mary, but it looked pretty tasty.  Wait service was fantastic--our guy was very attentive, and we had around 18 people in our group.  Parking is behind the building along Lake Monona. The view is simply gorgeous.   Bathroom is so clean, and well-stocked (it's a bit hot in there, though--weird).  Our group was very happy with the food and drinks. We chatted happily for a few hours and never felt pressured to leave, even after the checks had come and gone.  I'll definitely hit this place up again--next time in warmer weather so I can sit on the back patio and enjoy the lake even more."}
{"text":"Went with a group of 8 for dinner.  Our waitress was not very friendly, I had to find her to get another round of drinks and she never checked back with us after our meal was served. The food was just o.k., not at all what we were expecting for the price and previous reviews.  Madison Magazine voted this \"Best of Madison\" for seafood?  There were two fish options and oysters, how is it possible that is the best seafood Madison has to offer?  Hate sounding so negative, but did not have good experience!"}
{"text":"I got the duck confit. It had a nice crispy skin, but the meat melted in your mouth. The celeriac was another tasty part of the dish too. The rest of the vegetables were very buttery, and I wasn't a fan of that aspect.  The place itself is pretty cool. Its right along the lake with lots of windows. It must be awesome to go during the summer.  I thought the food was good, but it didn't have much of a wow factor to me. I enjoyed myself a lot, but the place didn't give me a reason to come back."}
{"text":"Sardine takes classic French cuisine and melds it beautifully with Americana food. The fusion is executed well and presented with fineness.  One of my best college friends was visiting UW for grad school with his family. They really wanted some good steak and seafood options so off we flew to Sardine. The restaurant was fairly booked up by the time we called so we made reservations for 8:30 pm.  Upon arrival we were promptly seated by the window and were given an awesome view of the back parking lot and beyond it, lake Monona. I really wish that parking lot wasn't there because the view is otherwise incredible.  For an appetizer we got the goat cheese crostini. The app was fairly standard but nothing special to blow me away. I would have liked to see significantly more toast served with the dish, as there was more than enough goat cheese present.  Others at the table ordered some craft cocktails, which were apparently quite good so props on the drinks. I ended up with a Lake Louie Tommy's Porter on tap, which I rather enjoyed. The tap list was small but well constructed with sufficient diversity. Props on the cocktails, beer list, and wine list here.  For an entree, I ended up with the Arctic Char. The dish was very well presented and didn't fall into any overdone culinary tropes (looking at you sauce smeared under the meat with a spoon). Great presentation, perfect balance with the leeks, potatoes, beans, and seasoning. I would order this dish again for sure.  My main gripe with Sardine is the service, as others have noted. The restaurant appears to be understaffed so the servers are heavily burdened, thus failing to be attentive to tables. While we were there we had to ask for water twice, eventually a carafe of water was just dumped on our table, and our empty dining-ware was never cleared throughout the course of the meal.  The food at Sardine well executed, but the poor service is crippling. If you have time on your hands to enjoy a solid meal, Sardine would be a good choice. If you are impatient or have somewhere to be it may be best to look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great food and seafood! I got the pan roasted haddock and it was amazing! We tried the oysters as well and for my first time having oysters I thought they were pretty good.   Overall, Sardine is a very beautiful restaurant next to the lake. The food and service were both phenomenal."}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service, excellent view. It's a little on the pricey side but well worth it. Highly recommend going here for a date or with the family or even with a group. My wife and I met my aunt here to have brunch. We ordered salads, the Norwegian salmon, and the crab shrimp cakes. All of our dishes were awesome. Our server was knowledgeable about the food including the fact that almost all of the ingredients are locally sourced and if they are not locally sourced they are from sustainable sources. The noise level was a little loud, but that was due to the fact that it was totally packed. However, we made reservations and got right in. They were also good about making substitutions.  My recommendation is the crab shrimp cakes. Their delectable."}
{"text":"The location and decor are fantastic. We went in December and the whole place was decked out with poinsettias. Stunning. It is so bright and open; even visiting in the winter, the lake view was stunning. The brunch food did not meet the hype, but the Duck Confit salad was a very satisfying meal. I would return for dinner for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Had my wedding rehearsal dinner here.  They worked with us to get everything within our price range and it was great.  The roasted chicken was the best I have ever had.  Those that didn't order it had food envy.  The person we worked with was great and extremely helpful."}
{"text":"It's been a while since we've visited Sardine.   Our experiences have usually been exceptional.   So when we decided to visit this evening we anticipated another enjoyable evening.   For the most part this proved to be true with one glaring exception.    The beers and wines we chose to begin our evening were good.   We decided to share the mussels and frites appetizer though we probably didn't need that much food.   Regardless the mussels were excellent...the frites OK.    My wife then had the duck comfit salad, which is her favorite dish here.   She thought it was up to snuff. I tried the evening special which was a fried cod cake accompanied by three shrimp.   They were served with very interesting vegetable preparations.   The cod cake however was boring.   Pretty tasteless even with the sauce that decorated it.   The shrimp were served in their shell.   Unfortunately they were prepared such that they were very difficult to separate from the shell even after hacking at them with fingers and fork.   After fighting with one of the three and still picking shell out of my mouthful I skipped the other 2.   Oh well'  Service was very good  We will go back."}
{"text":"I think I've found my new holy grail. Everything from how easy it was to make a reservation, to the outstanding service, to the wonderful cuisine, and let me not forget to mention the beautiful interior design, Sardine has everything you could want and need from a restaurant.   We had dinner reservations on a Saturday evening for a party of 6. We were promptly seated and we all were mesmerized at how fresh and cool the interior felt. The white walls, brick exposure, and wooden ceilings brought so much character to the restaurant, and the view of the lake didn't hurt. I felt as if I was somewhere in Connecticut.   Our server was very nice and attentive. He was extremely knowledgeable about the menu, especially with where their three types of oysters came from.   The bread basket was the only thing I could have done without. The bread was dry and tasteless.   The waiter kept my glass of Chardonnay full all night, which I appreciated. The wine went great with the oysters we all started the night off with. From there, I ordered the Seared Salmon on the menu. The salmon dish was excellent. The medium well cooked salmon, spinach, leeks, and beurre blanc sauce all went very well together. I had one bite that was really salty, but luckily, it was only on one piece of the fish, which was great because I didn't want to worry with having to send the meal back.   My husband ordered the French Onion Soup and the White Fish special. I'm not a fan of Onion Soup, but I did have a few spoon fulls of his, so I must have liked it a little. He sure loved it.   The White Fish special was fantastic. The delicious broth was subtle and complimented the fish, along with the veggies and squid ink pasta.   The Cauliflower Gratin sure made me feel as if I were eating Mac and cheese. The side dish was rich and creamy, but I wasn't guilty from eating it. I mean, it's Cauliflower, so it's healthy...right?   Overall, we all had a great time and will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Restaurant Week experience - early dinner with reservation at 5PM  1st Course: The beet salad was good, tasted fresh and the goat cheese Creme was delicious. Olive tart was also good, very flaky and not too salty.  Main Entree: Duck confit dish was cook very well and juice but much smaller in portion than the lamb. Brussels sprouts and potatoes were a nice pairing. The lamb was cooked very rare, almost too chewy. Polenta was a little bland ( not enough Parm?) and the veggies were good.   Dessert: Chocolate Tart which is actually the regular menu Chocolate Bourbon Tart because you can definitely taste the Bourbon in that! It was pretty dense but good flavor. Favorite was the Butterscotch pot de Creme! Smooth texture and I loved the sea salt on top. Tasted more like a caramel than butterscotch flavor.  Overall I thought the menu was good and was good value to $30 based on their regular menu prices. Our server was very nice but I felt extremely rushed to finish our meal. The main entree came out when we were only half way through our 1st course and the check arrived immediately after we received our dessert.   That put a damper on the experience, but besides that food was good, not wow, but good."}
{"text":"I miss seafood, especially now that I am about as far away from an ocean as I can be and still be in the US. But when I heard good things about Sardine, I had to try it out.  First, my order: half dozen Prince Edward Island oysters to start. Seared monkfish with roasted tomatoes, squash, haricots verts, and some variation of a Bearnaise sauce. For dessert, a raspberry Genoise cake and espresso. (Side note - Sardine is not $$. The above order was about $70. It's definitely $$$-$$$$.)  See, this is good, no-nonsense, modern French/American cooking. Fresh ingredients (although I should have asked how they source their fish), done professionally without unnecessary pretension. Good technique and flavor combinations that aren't confusing. Also, their wine list is superb. I got a glass of Sauvignon Blanc to pair with the seafood, and the one they had available by the glass was a Puilly-Fume whose fragrance and dryness worked to buoy but not overwhelm the delicate flavors of the seafood. The service was attentive and sharp. Indeed, I wanted a meal to unwind after a very long week, and I got that 100%."}
{"text":"We've gone here more than anywhere else in the 10 years we've lived in Madison.  Sardine is our go-to restaurant bar.  Recently the service has taken a turn for the worse.  Its sad.  Sardine is slipping a bit in the food department too.  Perhaps too many new restaurants stealing talent?  Don't know, but my favorite go-to place just lost a star."}
{"text":"Went for brunch on Sunday. Pretty reasonably priced, compared to the dinner menu.   The restaurant is nice inside. The only thing I didn't like was the fact that they wouldn't push together two tables together by the window to accommodate our party. So, we squeezed five settings onto a four-top. The view is just lovely, and the ambiance is nice. I have to say, I was impressed with our waitress. Either she's a veteran, or Sardine just hires excellent staff in general. She was right on top of everything, including topping off our beverages, and making sure that everything was going well, without being overbearing. The only thing more annoying than a server who never comes around is a server who is at the table between every bite!  I ordered the smoked salmon sandwich(which came with radish, cucumber, egg and watercress) and was very pleased. The salmon was very good, and there was a decent portion(in fact, I didn't even finish it).   *in case you didn't read my man's review...his sister found a bug in her greens. Gross. The waitress was really nice, and swiftly replaced her meal, and of course took it off the tab!  I will definitely go back on a Sunday morning, maybe next time I'll get one of their fruit pastries, which sounded delish!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Sardine. I've had 3 birthday parties there as well as my bachelorette party dinner. We have always been treated by royalty. The drinks are fantastic. I love their Cosmos!  Their dinner entrees have never disappointed, my favorites include the ribeye & frites and the duck confite salad. And their brunch is one of the best in the city. Sardine is definitely one of our go-to spots!"}
{"text":"Only went in once, and it was brunch, so this review is of limited scop, but I was pretty disappointed in my experience here.  Food was bland and a little over priced.  I recall having a brunch special, and there was nothing special about it...har har har.  Atmosphere was very nice, and I recall the service was good, so I'll give it a mediocre 3 stars, but I think there is probably better in Madison, for brunch at least."}
{"text":"The premise was set. Valentines Day and a French restaurant to celebrate it! Joie de vivre as they say :). Well not really..  Decor - Restrained elegance that exudes its own touch of romance as it sits right near the lake (Although the other side is a rather dingy street at night!)  Service - My critique here is ONLY for Valentines Day (Shouldn't matter but still). Romantic restaurants typically tend to have a more relaxed approach to timing their courses. This place took it a bit too far. The time lapse between Apps - Mains - Check kept stretching after every phase, to the point that we kept staring across the room to signal someone else to get our check since our server couldn't be bothered I suppose!  Food  - For hors d'oeuvres we had the Charcuterie plate. While the cured meats were a little too salty and hard to chew (perhaps too cured I guess), the liver mousse was good and paired very well with the mustard on the side and the thin flat bread.             For Mains, we had the Cassoulet and Moules Frites. The lamb shoulder on the Cassoulet was delectable! The sausage was decent. The leg and thigh duck confit was nothing to shout about. The meat was cooked fine but lacked a strong flavor dimension. The worse part was the beans as they looked and tasted like baked  beans straight out of a can. The walnut oil was non existent and bread crumbs although sparse, did save the sauce a bit.              The moules frites was better in comparison as the mussels were perfectly cooked with no sand/grit on them. The sauce was delicate yet tasty and the supporting fries were well seasoned.  Price : This is where I believe the experience lost a star here. For $27, the Cassoulet should've blown me away but it didn't. For $22, the mussels were better but not worth that much money. I guess the price was proportional to the portions which were good I must say! But quantity and quality don't always go hand in hand.   I wouldn't mind trying out this place again but for nearly $100 for a couple, there are better places to try out. Hope others have a better experience here."}
{"text":"Having been to Sardine for both brunch and dinner, I would say it is a nicely versatile space that excels at both. In terms of price points, their dinner options are more affordable than I might have assumed while still having a high level of quality. I tried the moules frites which had the most flavorful cream sauce for any mussels plate I've tried around Madison. The frites were nothing special, but went well with the dish.  In terms of atmosphere, my only dislike is the open staging area for front of house staff for slicing bread, etc. There's a lot of commotion, and it just seems weird to observe someone openly washing their hands among guests. Overall, I do enjoy Sardine for it's great menu options, relative affordability, and excellent service and will return time and time again."}
{"text":"I love Sardine. It's casual yet elegant. Hip but laid back.  The food is amazing. We are never disappointed with our meals. My husband and I always split the Duck confit salad."}
{"text":"Some of the best food, but some of the slowest service.   I loved everything I tried: cheese plate, charcuterie plate, steak frites, and pear tart. The cheese plate was very small for the price and compared to similar restaurants in Madison, but the cheeses were delicious and served with what were literally the best grapes I have had in my life. I think the grapes, butter (yes, I tried it straight, don't judge me!), and tart were the highlights of my meal. I was told I got the last slice of the pear tart, for which I thanked my lucky stars, because it was divine--topped with toasted almonds and with almond extract throughout, tender and flavorful pear and a flaky, buttery crust. It's a dessert I'll remember for a long time!  Unfortunately, we were seated in a cold corner of the restaurant at a rickety table. The waitress who brought out our cheese & charcuterie plates didn't explain to us what any of the items were, and didn't give us cheese or spread knives. Our steaks were brought out without steak knives either and the server left immediately, and because we were seated in the corner with our view obstructed by people waiting for the bar, I couldn't find a waiter to flag down, so I just dug in with my butter knife. Thankfully after several minutes our water noticed and brought us knives. Our waiter was friendly and courteous, I just would have preferred more explanation of dishes ($15 appetizers and $30 entrees kinda require this) and quicker service.   I will give Sardine another try because the food was so dang good, so hopefully my experience was just an off night for their service."}
{"text":"Since it has been almost 6 years since my last review, I wanted to provide a refreshed review and rating for our brunch excursion this past weekend.  One thing to note is truly what a beautiful space Sardine is.  With an open kitchen and the exposed ceiing, the restaurant is airy, classy and romantic without being stuffy.  It's just a great spot to dine in.  As for brunch, it was excellent.  I may get blasted for saying this but for Madison having some stellar restaurants to chose from, I think our brunch scene is lacking.  Sardine has restored my faith.  My better half opted for the arugula, brie, and crimini omelet while I selected the croque madame which both come with a side salad and frites.  Not only is it alot of food but both tasted amazing.  My dish, topped with a perfectly cooked egg, was both satisfying and rich.  The omelet was generously filled with brie and mushrooms and perfectly prepared.  The only critique would be the vinaigrette that the greens were tossed in.  It was relatively mild and flavorless. All in all, a great meal and we will be definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"I would really only give this a three-and-a-half star. Ambiance was excellent. Interesting menu. Presentation of food excellent. Service very good. Red wine by the glass was way overpriced and not very tasty for the house red and the Cab. Duck comfit was excellent - and we shared it as a salad between the two of us. Cheese board was very good, but for $15 I expect a few more slices of cheese. The entrees were reasonably priced, beautifully presented and well flavored - we had the pork shoulder and the mussels . Finished off with the chocolate cake for dessert which was very good, but at $9 you would expect a slightly bigger piece of dessert. Overall, probably not a place I would go back to given the bill was almost $170 with the tip for two of us, and although it was great it wasn't an out-of-this-world experience for that amount of money."}
{"text":"Seriously one of the best meals I've had - wonderful service, beautiful decor and a lovely view of the sunset. I highly recommend the flounder, and I will definitely come back the next I time I am in Madison."}
{"text":"I just had the chance to re-visit Sardine for dinner last night and I highly recommend!  I've been a handful of times for both brunch and dinner over the past few years and it has never disappointed. The brunch, I think, leaves a bit to be desired in comparison to dinner. The food is certainly not bad, but perhaps not as outstanding as dinner is. Both times I've been for dinner I've enjoyed their salmon, which is just scrumptious! Atmosphere, service, and food are all top-notch--would most definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Brunch review.  I desperately wanted to love this place more with the high reviews, but maybe it wasn't our day or time. Came here on a Sunday afternoon with a group of 4 (with a reservation) and was greeted by friendly staff who allowed us to choose our seating. We chose a lovely water view. We were presented our menus and there was a limited, but solid choices for brunch and lunch (I was surprised that eggs benedict were not offered in some capacity). For mimosas, they have the choice of an 8, 10, or 12 oz glass which was nice, as well as bottomless coffee.  I tried the mussels with frites as well as the baked creamed eggs. The frites were alright, nothing special (reminded me of McDonald's fries, in a way). The mussels were a good solid choice with the fresh bread being a highlight. The baked creamed eggs were very heavy and oily, but pretty good. The cheese and prosciutto went well and it was a hearty dish. I felt that the bread was out of place in this dish though and the salad portion was way to small to balance out a dish this heavy.   Some others ordered a special (which included poached eggs on top of a bed of sauteed mushrooms and the same bread) as well as a croque monsieur. One comment was the special was just slathered in truffle oil and was too hearty, as the bread was completely soaked through with oil and butter.   For dessert, we ordered the sorbet as well as the lemon meringue tart. We were told that the sorbet flavors of the day were pineapple, coconut, peach, however, we received scoops of lemon rather than coconut, which was a surprise (I don't mean to sound picky, but I was disappointed that we were mislead before we ordered the dessert).   The lemon meringue tart was decent and the lemon had a nice sharp flavor to it on top of a flaky crust (judging by the mini-bakery in the corner of the restaurant, it makes sense that their breads/pastries are well done here).   Overall, service was extremely slow and we waited about 30 minutes before we received our entrees and for a long time before that before we ordered. In addition, our waters were never refilled (everyone had finished their entire glasses) until the dessert menu came out and the waiter grabbed a pitcher to leave at our table (although a nice thought, it felt like too little too late). Everything was a little heavier and oilier than I would have liked, but the flavors were all there. It was just alright."}
{"text":"Beautiful and delicious dinner tonight! Wonderful atmosphere, came with my college daughter. We both loved it. Started with the seared ahi tuna appetizer with avocado - so so so good. I had the mussels with frites/mayo which were ridiculously addictive. The mussels were fantastic. Followed by the duck confit salad - INCREDIBLE! and the chicken breast stuffed with goat cheese. I am frequently wary of chicken (esp breast) in restaurants because it's often so dry but this was bone-in, juicy, tender. It was served on a bed of corn, fava beans and BACON. I could have eaten a bucket of that stuff. SO GOOD. We both wanted dessert but were way too full. Maybe next time..."}
{"text":"My first visit to Sardine, (though not my first trip to Madison), was stellar.  Sardine is a waterfront gem.  The cocktail list is expansive and well crafted and my two Red Derbys kept me happy all evening (fantastic combo of the Makers Mark and muddled fresh raspberries!)  The waterfront view was absolute perfection on a gorgeous, non-humid, summer evening.  I selected the Pan Roasted Whitefish for my meal and it was exquisite.  Fish was fresh and perfectly prepared.  The Yukon gold potatoes and vegetables were expertly seasoned and cooked.  Plating was beautiful and it was clear from our server's extremely knowledgeable and on-point recommendations that Sardine is a place for foodies, by foodies.  I can't wait to return to Madison and this wonderful restaurant."}
{"text":"I enjoy Sardine as a whole, but this last year has ruined my Steak and Frites experience. (Hence 3 stars)  Every time I've ordered it Ive received a large piece of fat with flakes of meat.  I am unaware if this is how they do it in France or Belgium, but it puts me off.  If you enjoy spending $23 on a large piece of under cooked fat, props to you.  I am quite sure that this isn't routine, and I have just been the unfortunate owner of quite a few poor cuts of meat.  I will continue to patron Sardine, as I enjoy my friends company and there are other choices on the menu.  The bar is top notch, the atmosphere wonderful, the service professional, and from what I gather the other dishes are superb.  None of my friends have complained about the Salmon, Chicken or the specials, in general.   (Is it too hard to ask for a proper steak?  That's all I want...*sob*)  Some portions tend to be small.    If they ever remove Corsendonk from the beer list, there will be war."}
{"text":"This is hands-down our favorite place to eat in Madison. Going to Sunday brunch is a tradition (although we don't live there anymore - when we move back we will resurrect this!)  They have some of the best quality food we have ever eaten - really cool ambiance too. If you sit at the bar you can get their \"bar menu\" - which is amazing and not as pricey as what you'd pay in the dining area for dinner.  Our favorite item is the mussels. They are the best. Even living in Seattle now we have yet to find better mussels, which is quite a compliment.  Their drinks are great, sometimes it's hard to get in or service is slow because it's such a popular spot. The wait is totally worth it!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places for brunch. Dinners are quite good, generally end up ordering the steamed mussels or braised pork currently. Though in the past, their skate was incredible. My favorite dish on the menu is the charcuterie plate. Hands down, this is the best meat-centric dish in town (sorry Graze), mostly because of the duck liver pate. Desserts are also worth saving room for, especially the chocolate cake."}
{"text":"I went to Sardine with friends for brunch in the fall.  I had been for dinner before, and thought the food was just OK for the price.  This visit, I really enjoyed the brunch.  The frites really are great.  But our service was very, very awkward.  My friend ordered a bloody mary, and waited quite a long while to get it.  Our food also took a very long time to come.  I guess if I could give it a 3.5, I would.  The food was good."}
{"text":"Probably as close to an honest-to-God brasserie Madison gets. It's not terribly expensive but I can easily drop $100 a person here for special occasions and leave totally satisfied and a bit drunk. They do very good work getting good ingredients and preparing them well. Word to the wise though, just getting an entree is going to seem like not a lot of food compared to what normally passes for a 20 dollar plate in Wisconsin"}
{"text":"The atmosphere of the restaurant is great and the staff is really friendly.  However, the price just doesn't add up to the worth.  I got the penne pasta and while it was decent, it didn't wow me.  Just okay."}
{"text":"My first time at this place. I have to say I really like the location and it's interior decoration. It is simply very nice and the ambience is very welcoming with lots of light.  I like that there is free parking available and direct view over lake Monona.  I started with the soup of the day - spinach and it was quite nice. The second dish I decided on Seared Salmon braised french lentils, sauteed spinach, portobello mushrooms, and tomatoes. The salmon was cooked to a point and it was delicious. I ended up with a dessert since I still had room, I decided on the lemon meringue tart. Hands-on one of the best desserts I had in a very long time. I was hoping to have left-over cake but it was so good that nothing was left to take home."}
{"text":"Sardine is a lovely restaurant.  The ceiling is high, like in a converted warehouse.  The building overlooks the water.  The menu is simple and refined to the point of being printed on a place mat - but don't be fooled.  They have truly delicious food.  Service is formal and agreeable.  Word to the wise: this restaurant is populated largely by academics at UW-Madison.  If you want to bump into a professor or a scientist, this is not a bad place to get lucky.  Watch out though - it's hard for them to argue about plasma physics when they're drunk on the good stuff, and Sardine serves plenty of it.  Best things on the menu?  OYSTERS!  They always have a selection of raw oysters on the half shell.  I get that and champagne.  Then I usually move on to the salmon with lentils and buerre blanc.    Probably my top pick in Madison.  If you're female, dress mousy but make sure your hair is ultra-shiny.  If male, put on a bow tie and a tweed jacket with leather elbow patches, fasten your cuff links, groom your goatee and shine your shoes.  Pretend you have an English accent.  Ok, NOW you're ready for Sardine."}
{"text":"Awesome dinner last night.  In town to tour U of M, so we were looking for something that was high quality, distinctive and fun.  Sardine hit all requirements for everyone.  Great space and décor; unbelievably friendly staff, and the food!  Fantastic.  Mussels, salmon, charcuterie and broccoli rabe.  All hit the spot.  If you are an out-of-towner like me, you will definitely enjoy!!"}
{"text":"I came here for brunch and had the moule frites. They were very good mussels, however I didn't think they were anything special. The ambience here was nice and they were very busy on a weekend afternoon. However, the service here was quite poor. We waited a very long time for all of our dishes and the waiter seemed to lag about 10 minutes behind every single time we had a request.   For dessert we had the sorbet which was just a normal sorbet. Overall, this is a good place but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Would you like fries or a salad with that burger?...are never words you would hear here because you get both automatically when you order one! I've tried several burgers in the Madison area and I would consider myself somewhat of a knowledgeable resource when it comes to burgers around here. Sardine's has made #2 on my list for best burger I've had in Madison. (#1 being  the late night burger at Tornado room)   I had a taste of both the house burger and the sardine burger. House burger you can't go wrong with. Has your standard toppings. However if you are feeling a little adventurous definitely go with the sardine burger. I was worried that the burger might be a little to sweet with both figs and caramelized onions on it but it was every bit savory as I wanted it to be. Note- that burgers can only be ordered at the bar or in the bar \"area\".   Brunch here is amazing as well. They take reservations so you should make them! will save you a big hassle. Dinner is a little bit pricier than brunch and the bar menu but it is a nice place to take a date. They also have seating that faces the water so if you really want to impress someone when the weather is nice try to snag one of these tables! It's beautiful.   I also applaud Sardine TREMENDOUSLY for being a restaurant that cares about where their fish are caught and sourced and tries to be sustainable. I know it's hard to do in the midwest but it is a serious issue and I'm glad they are taking the steps to be a restaurant that cares."}
{"text":"Sardine is an adorable restaurant, and would be perfect for date night or a group celebration.  The dinner menu is really awesome, leaning towards seafood, but with other items as well.  My group split the warm goat cheese crostini, which sounds unassuming but OMG it was amazing.  For my entree I had the monkfish, which was an unusual mix of flavors but it really hit the spot.  I knocked off one star just because it's a bit expensive for Madison, but honestly, worth the price to this Chicago girl."}
{"text":"The service was really pretty good. But I found the menu pretty uninspiring. For a place called Sardine, one might think there would be a larger seafood selection... so much. Mussels seem to be their signature dish and those who ordered them at our table were happy with them. The other fish on the menus included and I identified \"white fish\" and salmon - not identified as either wild or farm raised.   Started with a beat salad. It was delicious, but of poor value given it was $10 and really only offered two bites perhaps three of one savored the experience.   I was really struggling with the rest of the menu. But then I saw a decent looking burger go by... I inquired... it's on the bar menu. It's like $12-14 bucks. But it was tasty and was the best value on the menu. It comes with frites. Even so with a cocktail and my beat salad, I was in for over $40 for a burger out on the town. To be clear the quality of the food was fine - the service really very good. The atmosphere was decent but very loud. We had a larger group which often required shouting. Check out the menu online so you can make an informed decision as to whether or not this is your sort of joint."}
{"text":"Great seared scallops and succulent, flavorful duck breast.  It was so tender and well-seasoned with the perfect, slightly crispy exterior shell.  That is the mark of a exquisitely seared piece of duck breast.  The cheddar grits were a nice touch, too.  Service was attentive and prices were good for the quality."}
{"text":"Full disclosure: I cannot write an objective review of Sardine. My wife and I loved Sardine when it opened. Loved the food, loved the \"philosophy,\" loved the service. Loved everything.  We loved it so much we had our wedding reception there four years past.  Sardine is still tops on my list. No where else quite feels like home so much as this wonderful Bistro on Lake Monona.  I'm not sure what is better--the service, the food or the atmosphere. Whether you are at Sardine for brunch, dinner or a special event, you cannot go wrong. Quintessentially Madison, the French bistro food is neither overpriced nor overly chi-chi.  Tonight I attended my six or seventh Sardine Family dinner. Always multiple courses paired with wonderful wine and/or beer, these are terrific opportunities to see just what the kitchen is capable of. $40 tonight provided more snacks (cheese, chicken liver pate, kale flatbread, salumi, etc.) that necessary, a lovely duck confit and bread salad, \"steamship of pork,\" an absurd cakey cut of grits (amazingly rich), and a delicious meringue dessert with maple ice cream all paired with Wisconsin craft beers.   I love you Sardine and I will miss you immeasurably."}
{"text":"I love this place. The dinner menu is excellent (and I think pretty reasonably priced for what you get) the bar is very nice and has a good wine list and some interesting specialty cocktails (oyster martini - which is delicious) and the brunch menu is probably the best in Madison. Favorites = quail, steak, duck confit salad The service is always quite good and the interior is beautiful. Great location in a historic building on the lake. Avoid the croquettes. They're boring."}
{"text":"So good!! Duck l'Orange was so flavorful, I would highly recommend. Everything about this place, beginning to end was great. Service, food, ambiance... A+"}
{"text":"Wonderful ambience and setting on lake with seating on a narrow, outdoor terrace.  Charming, exposed beams, stone- walled bar-back with subway tiles reminiscent of a true french brasserie interior.  Beautiful open kitchen, wood-oven and pure bistro menu.  Incredible Bloody Mary with olive, minced jalapeño-radish garni, cornichon and pickled slice of fennel/ how festive and eye candy-ish, with beer chaser!  What a deal!  Mouth-watering brunch menu , only negative is that the service can be very slow.  Parched for my cocktail!  Go- you will love it."}
{"text":"Sardine is just not my favorite brunch spot in Madison. Though I like the atmosphere and decor, as well as the service, the food always leaves me feeling underwhelmed. I found the Croque Monsieur to be unnecessarily large and overwhelming when I ordered it, but went another time and had a beet and farro dish that was far too small and hardly filling. That being said, the portions are inconsistent and the flavors are just average.   It's a nice place to bring a group in terms of aesthetics, but my experience with the food has been pretty unforgettable for the price."}
{"text":"One of the best places to eat in Madison.  The food, the ambiance, all great.  I've never had a bad meal at Sardines.  The only gripe, I wish they would change or expand the menu."}
{"text":"Thank you Sardine for being our restaurant of choice for the last 4 years of my son's matriculation at the U of Wisconsin-Madison. The food and service are amazing and we've had an opportunity to share many important conversations over Moule Frite, a bottle or 2 of wine and some wonderful French Bread dipped in the flavorful liquid. Alas, he is moving on, but we will find a reason to come from the Twin Cities for an excellent experience. Unless of course you can find a way to relocate... :)"}
{"text":"Walk in (by yourself, even) grab a seat at one of the high tables around the bar area, or at the bar itself, on any weeknight and enjoy it. Or bring some friends on a weekend night, either way Sardine satisfies.  Start with the confit salad. Its lovely and maybe french onion soup? Then move on to the moules frites. Have the appetizer portion - its plenty of food and will let you save room for desert....the molten choc cake is typically good., not what you'd expect in a higher end resto or your corner bistro in Paris for example, but tolerable (hehe).  Work your way around the wines by the glass on the chalk board above the bar, or dive into a bottle from the well rounded wine list. No complaints about this place other than not availing myself of its charms frequently enough."}
{"text":"I was so excited to finally try this place for my birthday... only to come away completely underwhelmed.   the good first: the service was excellent. our waitress was very attentive and friendly. the cocktails were nothing short of amazing! I started with a cucumber corpse reviver and then had a provencal. both had beautiful, delicate mixtures of flavor and were very refreshing. my hat is off to the bartender who concocted these delicious drinks. the decor is old world and elegant. I'm sure the view is pleasant if you're lucky enough to get a seat near the lake side or outside.  now the bad: my swordfish was overdone and on the chewy side, and the potatoes were soooo greasy (and a little burned). don't get me started on the parking lot and it's entrance... I wonder how many accidents have occurred here.  overall, not great but not terrible... however, if you name your restaurant after a fish and feature a ton of fish/seafood on your menu, you should make damn well sure that you know how to prepare it. maybe we just came on a bad night? I'll probably be back for cocktails and/or brunch, but doubt I'll give sardine another shot for dinner."}
{"text":"I knew I liked Sardine from a visit or two a long long time ago, but I couldn't really say why. Luckily I have a friend who has gotten me back here twice recently! Getting there is easy enough, but with that crazy John Nolan/Blair/Willy/bike paths galore intersection, pulling into the parking lot can take some advance planning.  It's very nice inside with lots of light and an outdoor patio with great views of the lake. We didn't have any difficulty getting seated, but I could see how you might really want a reservation at times. Service is good, but not always great.   I started out with the Bloody Mary on both visits. It's really very good. But, it comes with lots of very small piece of chopped veggies on top (as well as some traditional garnishes). Delish, except when those tiny bit get stuck in the straw. Solution: either remove the bits beforehand, or ask for one or two of the skinny straws. Actually, the second Bloody Mary came with the skinny straws, and it was a real game changer.   I've had the mushroom/arugula omelette and the shrimp cakes. I sure enjoyed the omelette, however, those shrimp cakes were outstanding. Possibly that will be all I ever order. It came with a yummy and refreshing salad and a perfectly cooked egg. We also shared some desserts on one of these visits. The lemon bar and the fruit sorbets were sooooo good!   I can't wait to go back - it about time I tried their oysters!"}
{"text":"Great appetizers, Ok food and slow service!"}
{"text":"Fancy schmancy! My boyfriend's roommate was raving about the Sardine burger and we decided to check it out. The restaurant is divided into a bar area and the sit down fancy dinner area; the burgers are served only in the bar area.   We ordered a house burger and a Sardine burger and they were both really good (although I liked the house burger better.) The Sardine burger has fig, gorgonzola, and spinach (?) on it while the house burger is more traditional with lettuce, tomato, your choice of cheese (I recommend sharp cheddar), and mayo. Both came with a side salad and a whopping serving of fries.   I saw that they had a special on oysters for happy hour (M-F, 4-7pm) and $3 Stella Artois. I will definitely be back to check that out!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite for brunch. First - seating near the window with lake view is the best.  The food is always fresh and the server are very nice, efficient and very friendly.  At the end - they charge me for (4 pcs) of bread....how much money you save here ?....."}
{"text":"The Steak Frites broke my heart. It was disgusting. A poor excuse for ribeye--and for $26!!!!! I will happily fork over at least that for a good steak, but this was neither good nor steak. I swallowed two bites nearly whole because they were so rubbery and tough (not to mention overcooked) and passed on the rest to my husband. I stole half of his burger, which he ordered from the bar menu, and it was actually quite good. My husband was equally grossed out by my steak and equally impressed by his burger. To be fair, our french fries were also very good. Moral of the story, at least as far as I'm concerned, is that the bar menu is a go and the \"fine\" dining menu is a gigantic no. The only thing I truly loved about this place was the chocolate almond ganache. That, and only that, was worth talking about."}
{"text":"My party of three enjoyed dinner at Sardine on a surprisingly busy Tuesday night.  Cocktail menu was inventive and prices are similar to other Madison cocktail bars.  We tried the charcuterie plate and while it was good, there could have been a bit more to it or at least more crostini for the duck liver mousse.  Our server recommended the duck confit salad.  That, with another small plate, could have definitely been a meal in itself.  It was delicious, but the bacon vinaigrette definitely added some greasiness to the salad.  Salmon, steak frites and pork tenderloin were our entrees and they were all very flavorful.    Our server was polite, attentive and helpful.  I agree with other reviewers that the service seemed a bit slow; we waited awhile for our entrees.  All in all, it's a welcoming space with a cozy atmosphere and lovely food."}
{"text":"I ordered the duck, and it was spectacular. Although my friend's rotisserie chicken was bland, the food was very delicious. I definitely would come here again. However, I didn't like where we were seated--at a table in the middle of the room and between booths. It was very noisy and had a lot of foot traffic."}
{"text":"The acoustics are horrible, unless you're in the bar area or patio.  The food is pretty decent- well thought out.  However, I don't eat pork, and there are very few dishes available porkless.  The Valentine's Day specials menu was fabulous- as there were Camembert Croquettes- really wonderful, on a bed of sauteed greens with (I believe- it was dark) cherries, grapes, walnuts and a mustard sauce.  Very good- I wish it were a regular on the menu.  I'd have a go to thing to order.  Otherwise, not much for me on the menu.  Nice wine list."}
{"text":"My wife and I took our son and his girlfriend for a Saturday dinner.  We tried for reservations early in the afternoon but they were already pretty heavily booked with only later times available so we tried the walk in option based on the suggestion of the person that I talked with.  We did find a table in the bar area and, as my son wanted to eat overlooking the lake, we had to wait about 45 min for a table.  Our service in the bar was very prompt and we were well taken care of as we enjoyed drinks and appetizers.  My only comment on the appetizers would be that there's really nothing to order for a group to share -- we did the brea cheese and sausage sampler but they were really just one serving each.  The food was great and we all enjoyed our entrees.  Between the 4 of us we enjoyed the pork chop, ribeye steak, beef cheeks, and artic char.  They were all seasoned and prepared very well -- certainly enjoyable.  The waiter was very prompt and attentive.  Our only real challenge was to figure out the parking arrangements as it isn't very clearly indicated anywhere but we eventually figured it out.  Prices were toward the higher side and not what I'd consider a bargin but they were very fair for the service and quality of food.  So, while it won't be a regular experience when we travel to Madison, we'll likely be back."}
{"text":"Fabulous place! Decor and location are great. Our waiter was amazing, friendly and had a good sense of humour. He was attentive and knowledgable. Ordered goat cheese crostini for apps and was delicious. Malbec wine went down a treat and also got one glass comped from the waiter as waited a little long. Entree was cooked to perfection steak frites the French way! Looking forward to coming back and trying other fare from the menu."}
{"text":"Happy hour with $3 house wine or Stella and half price East Coast oysters. This place is my jam.   The space is beautiful, food is delicious and fresh, and there's something on the menu for everyone. One star off because over the past year the quality of service has really gone downhill.  Also...they make a strong salty dog at brunch."}
{"text":"Some astounding cocktails, and truly great dinner. I'm shocked to learn they do brunch as well, and I'll strive to attend. One of the best meals my family has ever had included their entree duck confit, their yellowtail tuna, and the strawberry salad. Perfectly prepared meats and seasoned foods, and experimental in preparation while still being recognizable as fine dining."}
{"text":"I like to go here because it's close to where I live. With that being said I spend around 500-600 dollars there a month. The food is decent. The front of the house is the main problem here. It wants to be a European styled restaurant without the service and knowledge you would expect. They serve two types of pastis but do not know how is prepared. They miss simple things like bringing out appetizers before your meal. Again this wouldn't be a big deal if it wasn't for the pretentious attitude at the foh. It starts with the general manager Susan. She will typically lie to you based off who you are about table availability. It doesn't matter if you're like me and spend enough money in there to be afforded a little respect and not be lied to or the first timer. Even if you have a reservation you may he sat in a less than optimal table. Her attitude is the exact opposite of the type of person you want heading a restaurant trying to be this level. (Source I eat at Michelin starred restaurants regularly that are booked months in advance and receive better treatment for short notice than here). I've been spending my money at brassiere v which is the same style better frites and awesome foh. I suggest you do the same"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible service in the bar! My husband and I went for drinks and appetizers. There were 6 people total at the bar (us included) and 4 bartenders. We waited 10 minutes for service and 30+ minutes for raw oysters. Never once were we asked about drink refills (empty glasses for 30+ mins) or satisfaction with our food. The bartender who took our order ignored us the rest of the time (he literally never came back). We have been loyal patrons and brought numerous new guests to Sardine. Tonight was a complete and total disappointment. Not sure we will be back."}
{"text":"Maybe my mistake has been not ordering Mussels, fish, or steak at this place, because surely they must be doing something right to have the reputation they do.  On the other hand, its possible this is simply a Madison phenomenon- a new trendy place a few years back that offers a beautiful view, a nice atmosphere and menu items that don't appear on every corner in Madison.  The place takes off, the quality dives (if it was ever great, in the first place), and it takes time for people to realize - this isn't really great food.  Not even good.   I've been to this restaurant twice, once in 2008, where the food was just awful- a bland over cooked pasta, and an even blander fish - but I thought we could have just had bad luck.  Now I've been again and I am utterly unimpressed.  In this last visit, everyone on my end of the table thought the food was unspectacular at best, if not dismal.  The endive and pear salad is a joke, really.  Shallots, black currants and Roquefort dressing? Where were they?  I didn't taste even a smidgen of Roquefort in this bland blah salad, which had a few thin slices of tasteless crunchy pear, maybe two currants and just nothing to tie it all together - no flavor at all.  I think they imagined the Roquefort, really.  They THOUGHT they were doing Roquefort, but forgot to put it in? Who knows.  After reading the description, and endive/pear/blue cheese being a relative common trio in many restaurants these days, I expected to taste SOMETHING other than crunchy tasteless pear and greens. Fellow diners Arugula and house salads were just as uninspired and bland.  The pastas sounded interesting, so fellow diners made the error of ordering two of them - how is it that the chef manages to take parmesan and garlic and manage to make their flavors disappear?  Overcooked flavorless store bought pasta, mushy flavorless polenta: my fellow diners mostly played with their food.  Looking over at the salmon served to other diners, I wonder where this fish came from?  It looked discolored.  This is not salmon I expect at a fine dining establishment (which Sardine definitely is not).  But the piece de resistance was my duck.  What passed for  \"grilled duck breast with fig/balsamic\" simply bordered on criminal.  First of all, the duck was utterly cold.  Second, I asked for medium rare, and I got slimy, barely grilled uber-rare duck which I could not even cut with a knife as it slid about the plate, the wet uncooked meat clinging to the china, changing shape with each stab as only stickly raw meat can.  The duck was uncooked edge to edge, with no effect of ANY grilling in sight -and may I repeat - disgustingly COLD COLD COLD.  It was duck sushi, except I expect duck sushi would taste better than this.  It was hard to chew and swallow each piece and had I not been a guest, I would have returned this dish immediately.  As it was, I didn't bother finishing it anyway, and thought of the hamburger I'd go get later.   Unseasoned, with not an inkling of the flavors described on the menu, this dish was a travesty, really.   Either the chef in this kitchen has lost all taste buds, or this flavorless blandness is actually INTENTIONAL.   Whichever the case, I am not going back to Sardine.   A restaurant serving that dish as grilled duck deserves to close.  Were it in a larger city, my guess is Sardine would already be on its way to disappearing.  I am giving it one star for the view, and the decor/atmosphere."}
{"text":"White-washed brick all around the restaurant, lake view, lots of natural light, has a \"bar area\" and then a quieter area (for lack of better description). Can't miss spot for a date or catching up with an old friend. Also, great brunch if your looking to treat yourself on the weekend.  Try the mussels if you like seafood or the croque monsieur if you come for brunch."}
{"text":"Sardine was superb. The bar service was impressive, food was delicious, and the views of the lake were stunning. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Elegant dining room with a view of Lake Monona and heavenly food makes Sardine one of my favorite brunch spots in Madison.   They take reservations and often times you can even walk in and get seated without having to wait. Just yesterday I walked in and immediately got a table right by the window.   Sardine is supposed to be a French bistro, and it really looks the part. Decor is simple and classic. Doesn't hurt that there are fewer lake view restaurants in Madison than I can count on my hand(s - depending on what you count), so that automatically makes Sardine very special.   Given all of this, I'd probably love this place even if it had average food. But the food is SO SO DELICIOUS!   Without a doubt, my favorite thing to order is the baked creamed eggs. The cheese and prosciutto make it so incredibly perfect that I could probably eat six of them in one sitting. It comes with well dressed greens and a few slices of wonderful baguette.  The specials are always great, and so are the sandwiches on the menu. The Bloody Mary is one of my favorites in Madison and it goes great with the oysters they serve. I am getting so hungry writing this! If you've never had brunch at Sardine, it needs to go on the top of your list!"}
{"text":"My second time there and I am never disappointed . This time I order a choucroutes and love it . Being an Alsatian I was expecting something different from what I got from a presentation. It turn out to be a great dish with the perfect portion . The dishes are simple but well structured . Very honest food"}
{"text":"We went to Sandine's with our family of five and used a 100 gift card.  There we a number of problems. #1. Only one in our group was satisfied with their meal.  My wife could not eat her hamburger due to excessive saltiness.  My daughter had a meal with a variety sausages that was very fatty. Again, it was extremely salty and she could not eat it, so I traded my salmon dish with her. Honestly, I could not stomach either meal but only nibbled on it. The salmon was editable but nothing to brag about.  The meals were also expensive considering what they were.    The service was generally good, but come to think of it, I don't think the server asked us about how we liked our food and didn't notice that I had two full plates of food in front of me.    When I paid, the waiter took my gift card without showing me the bill. He came back looking for additional form of payment because there was only $28 remaining on the card for the $90 bill.  Since it was supposed to have $100 balance, I was dismayed.  The server took no time to get the manager.  The manager was good enough to give me full credit which we were pleased with.  When I attempted to tip the waiter using the remaining balance on the gift card, I was not allowed to do this per policy.  I thought this policy was strange.  Overall, I cannot recommend due to poor food quality, high price and service that could have been a little better for this class of restaurant."}
{"text":"Food was on the heavy side but was nonetheless delicious...The reason why I marked off stars was bc of the service.  I called ahead twice to request a slice of cake to be brought out for my dad's 70th bday as a surprise.  When we arrived I secretly reminded the hostess about the surprise cake and also requested them to bring the check to me...basically so my dad wouldn't try to pay for the meal.  The exact opposite ended up happening!! As soon as we were done with our main course, they took our plates, brought the check,  and handed it DIRECTLY to my dad.  I was so annoyed.  Not only did they forget the cake, but they didn't even offer dessert.  I couldn't wrestle the check out of my dad's hands so he ended up paying.  Total birthday fail. Why would the staff do this?  I was so sad I couldn't treat my dad for his bday."}
{"text":"Great oysters! Always had great service in bar and dining room. Love the food, especially the fish."}
{"text":"Great food, service, ambiance,and drinks. Highly recommend! Endive salad , salmon entree, and butterscotch dessert were all superb! Our server Anthony was very good!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I decided that we wanted a casual night out but somehow ended up at Sardine. As the restaurant itself is FAR from casual we decided to stick our sweatpants clad bums in the bar seating. Although we didn't fit the general \"classy\" motif, we were still treated as though we were. Their small but delicious bar menu provided more than enough pleasure, especially while coupled with their house red. If I had to make one lasting suggestion, it would be to go for the frites and burger. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Do you know how hard it is to find a good restaurant when you're in town for business for 1 (maybe 2) nights?  I dined at Sardine this evening and had a great meal and great service.  First, the space is large and looks very cool -- loft-like with a white tile/mirrored bar area.  I dined alone at the bar and was very comfortable.  The bartender said that it was a slow night (the bar was never full) and it was very nice.  He was attentive and tailored his spiel to fit my needs ( I wanted a glass of wine and dinner, not oysters, desert and a lenghty discussion).  I read reviews and ordered the skate wing along with a glass of rioja and a house salad.  The food was amazing.  The skate wing was tender and flavorful -- the lemon/caper sauce was perfect.  The broccoli rabe was cooked al dente and just my style.  The little (fingerling) potatoes that accompanied it were a perfect accompaniment.  The salad (again, my favorite food) was very well done.  I didn't think it was possible to f up a salad until J. Christopher's (see 1st review) but this salad was delicious...crunchy chick peas and even the thinly slice leeks were good with everything else (i hate raw onions).  The dressing really complimented the greens (which I can eat all by themsleves) and the wine was perfecto (the rioja by the glass).  It wasn't that expensive considering the quality and the quantity and if this place we're in Atlanta (where we have amazing restaurants), it would be packed every night.  i'd dine at sardine every night if only it were only in the ATL."}
{"text":"Stopped at Sardine for brunch and it was a fairly good experience! It's a french seafood place, so if you're not into that type of food, I wouldn't recommend it. It's right next to Lake Monona and has a beautiful view of the lake if you're sitting on that side of the restaurant. The parking lot is next to the lake, but there's a decent amount of street parking available near the restaurant area.   Beyond the location, the food was good but not AMAZING. I was hoping to be a little more impressed, and to be completely honest, the food itself was perhaps a 3.5 while the ambience/location bumped it to a 4 star review. The service was relatively slow (it's fairly busy - I recommend a reservation for the weekend), but it wasn't unbearable. The restaurant gets very packed and busy, so I would expect a little bit of a wait for both the food and to get a table.  So back to the food - I got the baked sausage + eggs and my friend got a charcuterie plate with a side of fries. The fries were actually the best part of the meal, in my opinion! They were DELICIOUS and much better than the typical fries you get. The sausage and eggs and charcuterie plate were good, but nothing to write home about.  I would like to return for dinner sometime for sure! I totally recommend stopping by if you're looking for something that's not the typical american food that's omnipresent in Madison."}
{"text":"I rarely give 5 stars, but I wish I could give little more to this place.   I had a surprise birthday party with crowd of 10+ people.  My friend reserved the back place for the party, and they even let us decorate the place with the giant happy birthday tag. The staffs were extremely kind and polite. The service throughout the evening was impeccable.    With all the comotion, I didn't have time to thoroughly inspect the wine list, but the French brut I was drinking was perfect accompaniment to steamed mussels, vegetable fritter (piccolo fritto - airy fry of zucchini, fennel, tomato, eggplant - superb), and ahi entree. The ahi was cooked slightly longer than I would have liked, but the seasoning was spot on for the fish as well as for the accompanied salad.    The restaurant has very clean tone. Open, airy, and perfect amount of lighting for the good mood. I loved the dark wood floor as well. A perfect date spot? You bet!"}
{"text":"After 5 years living and frequenty dining out in San Francisco, I lived in Madison for 6 months while working on the Obama campaign.  Another ex-San Franciscan I worked with and I would generally measure the Madison restaurants we frequented by the \"Could this place stay in business in San Francisco?\" yardstick.  (Sorry to be a Bay Area food snob, bring on the hateration.)  Sardine is one of the only restaurants that unquestionably passes that test.  In fact it is better that this restaurant is in Madison, because if it went to San Francisco with food and service this good, you'd have to wait an hour for a table.    The service is absolutely fantastic.  I've had many different waiters here and they are all friendly, knowledgeable and go above and beyond for you.  Want your martini with kalamata olives?  No problem.  Friend needs cornstarch for the cooking contest you're on your way to?  Let me bring some out in a baggie from the kitchen.  And the food is top notch.  Especially the desserts.  And the oysters.  And the skatewing.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Yummy , easy to get to. Highly recommend. The blue cheese with fig sauce is delicious . Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Wow! SNOBBY host. Very uninviting and made me want to leave the restaurant immediately."}
{"text":"This is the most amazing breakfast/brunch place by far that I've found in the Madison area. I had the baked creamed eggs and my daughter had the French toast. Both were amazing. I'm pregnant so I could not sample any of the mixed brunch drinks, but I will be back for that as soon as this baby is born! Love the atmosphere and view also."}
{"text":"Fabulous. Absolutely fabulous. I have no other words to describe our experience at Sardine.  Perfect for happy hour with the coworkers, a low-key (but classy!) date night, or a meet-the-parents kinda shindig (that's right, I made my friends meet my parents...but I paid for dinner, so I think that made up for it).   The menu is impressive. The dinner specials are great. The mussels are a must-have. I only wish I had saved enough room for dessert.  Only snafu - a fly kamakazi-ed (literally nose-dived and then belly-upped) into my friend's entree. But our waitress was nice enough to take 25% off her dish."}
{"text":"Although Sardine has been one of my favorite Madison restaurants since they opened, I thought I would write a quick review on my recent dinner there.  I suggested Sardine for our Board of Directors dinner on a recent Wednesday night and it was a unanimous hit.  We had a table of 12, many of whom were from out of town and/or had never been to Sardine.  It was much busier than I would have expected for mid-week, but the atmosphere was wonderful, not too loud to have a conversation but lively.  The staff at Sardine are some of the best in Madison, and they lived up to that on this evening.  Every person at our table raved about their meal and I never heard a single complaint or concern, only positive feedback.  Since John and Phillip opened Marigold Kitchen more than ten years ago, they have set a new standard for dining in Madison, and Sardine continues to set the bar.  The greatest test of any restaurant, for me, is to have the confidence to bring a diverse group of people out for dinner and feel confident that whatever their taste they will enjoy their meal.  Sardine passed the test with flying colors on this evening and I will continue to count on Sardine as one of my reliable go-to restaurants for any occasion."}
{"text":"One of the best places to eat at in Madison. Great vibe inside, beautiful. It has a nice view of the lake. The seating outside on the deck is great as well. Get reservations.   Oysters are always on point. Highlights are the Sardine Burger (get it with gruyere & cheddar), moules & frites, Steak Frites, Seared Salmon.   I always make a point of stopping into Sardine when I'm back in town for business."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went for a date night last week here. I would say the atmosphere is nice for a date night which is why we came here. It was a last minute idea and they were very accommodating in getting us a table. The service was great and we enjoyed our waiter. I got the steak with compound butter, which was good but not worth the price point in which I paid for it. Overall, I would say the meal was pleasant and the vibe was nice, but whoever sets the prices of the items is gravely mistaken about what they are offering. I would give it 4 stars if the prices were dropped roughly 20%.   Fun Fact: It is called Sardines because everyone is packed like Sardines into this restaurant."}
{"text":"When my friend reserved a table at Sardine for her birthday, I was pretty excited. I'd heard good things about it, and while it's a little above my usual going-out budget as a grad student, I was happy for an excuse to splurge. However, I wasn't impressed at all. It has a nice atmosphere, some interesting wines on the list, but the food and service, while not offensive, were just fine. As the two star rating explanation above states appropriately, \"Meh.\"  First off, we had a table for 10, and they set us up in a strange L-shape that made for awkward conversation. Not a huge deal, but when I nicely asked the waitress if there was anything we could do, given that there was a lot of empty space around us, she just looked at me, perplexed.  On to the food. My husband and I split the blueberries and belgian endive salad with spiced pecans, purplette onions, Roquefort cheese in champagne vinaigrette to start. Sounds tasty, right? I think it epitomizes my experience - multiple fancy-sounding foods, locally sourced, paired well - it all sounds good in theory, but ended up being rather boring. It was good enough to eat, but wasn't something that I would pay $9 again to eat. Similarly, my entree, orechiette  with broccoli rabe, oven roasted cherry tomatoes, roasted garlic, niçoise olives and parmesan was bland, extraordinarily oily, and disappointing."}
{"text":"Awesome. Magnifique.   I've been to this restaurant maybe 50 times, and I never get tired of it. Time and time again they deliver great quality delicious food, and amazing elegant service. Try the Sardine burger, or the canned sardines!"}
{"text":"My wife selected Sardine for brunch as a pre-anniversary meal. I was disinclined to go because my experiences with French restaurants, both in Los Angeles and NYC have always been too much dough for not enough go; said simply tiny portions with high tariff (think nouvelle cuisine as it was presented to Steve Martin in LA Story).  This was not the case at all here. I had the rib eye steak and poached eggs. Not only was the food prepared exactly as requested and delicious, but the portion was perfect; it could be argued that this menu item is the sleeper; a real value proposition.  We will be returning for dinner. It is great when expectations are shattered for the better."}
{"text":"We went to Sardine during restaurant week and got a very good first impression of the place! The best items from their limited menu that we tried were the house made gnocchi and the pot de creme. The mussels and frites and lemon tart were okay, but seemed like dishes you could get at any restaurant. The ambiance was also awesome. I need to come back in the spring so I can take advantage of their awesome lake view. Definitely will come back  here again!"}
{"text":"well....had wanted to come here for a long time and finally made it in.  Called ahead for a reservation for two, at 6 o'clock.  The hostess suggested we do so just to be sure...turns out we would've been okay but, I can see why...this place is popular!  Service and seating were prompt.  Our waiter was friendly and attentive.  We sat at the large bay doors overlooking Lake Monona.  We opted for a light dinner - shared a plate (very LARGE plate) of mussels and the lobster rolls....these were devoured quite greedily....  We also ordered the beef tip to share as a main course.  The kitchen staff very thoughtfully delivered it as two separate portions - very nicely presented each on their own plate....as opposed to giving us two plates and making us divide it ourselves....classy!  The beef was so tender and well prepared...just...wow!  Normally, I'd make them wait for a 5-star review...prove they can deliver...  This was just such a pleasant experience with delicious food and good service...I'll be a softy  :P  Hint:  the large bay doors by the lake can be chilly Hint hint:  the \"happy hour\" specials for Oysters are ONLY at the bar... Hint hint hint:  Arrive before six if you want any hope of parking in their lot...otherwise plan on street parking and walking.... Hint hint hint hint:  The restoration of the old building is VERY nicely done.  A lot of neat exposed architecture to look at.  The one downside is the massive HVAC system...it is actually a bit loud if you sit under one of the large vents.  dare I?  a new record?  a quintuple hint extravaganza?  heck yeah!  hint^5:  this place is worth a trip when you have a little time to spare...lots of cool things to check out just wandering around the restaurant and the restored building, old photos, old mechanical equipment, groovy brick work, and cool light fixtures....lots of things to see and explore!"}
{"text":"Update!  After living in Madison for two years, and now moving away... there is nothing quite like Sardine.  I looked back and saw that I had given it 4 stars... must have been an off day.  It's an all around excellent restaurant.  Brunch is most certainly the highlight, and the excellent staff is the icing on the cake."}
{"text":"Sardine is a hard place to find if you're not a local. It is hidden by lake Monona terrace and traffic can be a pain. I've only been here for brunch, but the food was delicious. Sardine is definitely a higher end brunch spot with many options that you will crave.  I had the omelet with goat cheese, bacon lardon, cherry tomatoes, and spinach which was delicious and prepared in a timely manner. This came with a side of fruit. The plates here are a bit expensive, but the food is delicious.   My only regret is not trying their homemade pastries which looked incredible...until next time..."}
{"text":"Yum! Sardine is consistently delicious, and the overall experience has been great both times I've been here.  I've come for dinner and brunch, both of which offer many delicious menu options. I find the pricing to be pretty reasonable for what you get, especially for the brunch ($10-12/plate for large portions!). I did prefer dinner over brunch here, mainly because my boyfriend's sandwich at brunch was not that great. He got the braised pork sandwich and found the pork to be a bit dry and lacking in flavor. Aside from that, though, everything was very tasty. I got an omelette with brie, cremini mushrooms , arugula, and chives. It was huge and impossible to finish, but very yummy.   The service has been very attentive both times I've been here, and the ambiance is really nice. Sardine is worth at least a few visits for special occasion dinners, happy hour, or a nice brunch."}
{"text":"A Parisian inspired gem in the heart of Madison--yes, please. I fell in love with Sardine after a brunch experience where we sat at the bar and enjoyed delicious Greyhounds and plates of warm duck confit, croque madame and Sardine Ceasar (granted Ceasar salads aren't actually French but somehow it \"feels\" french with anchovies). The bar staff are jovial and attentive, quick to see near-empty glasses and ready to recommend favorites.  The dinner experience was equally pleasant (I highly recommend sitting at one of the high top tables in the bar for a more lively yet casual experience). This time we enjoyed the oysters with a fantastic mignonette, Moules Frites (PEI mussels), duck confit and creme brulee. Definitely reminded me of the nondescript, low-key Parisian cafes that are deliciously arresting.  Bottom line: the chefs nail duck confit and the staff is well trained. Great for work dinner, date night and happy hour. Parking can be an issue so walk or uber if you want to save time."}
{"text":"Terrific food, I loved the atmosphere and the food, but a few minuses about Sardine:  1) Service was slow- It was busy so I have a certain amount of understanding, I know how hard it is to keep up with every table, but the servers looked like they were spread pretty thin.  2) Portion sizes- not the best. Especially for a place with such terrific food, it made it all that much worse that I only got a tiny bit of it. I had the char, by the way. Delectable. But don't bring a hungry teenage boy, you'll end up stopping again on the way home. 3) Price- delicious food, but for the amount of food, a bit of an injustice I think.  All in all, the food was amazing, but the restaurant itself lacked in a few areas. I would suggest, especially to the older crowd."}
{"text":"French elegance meets Madison casual cool...Sardine is in my top three favorite restaurants in Madison. Lively bar, great view, fun easy-going hosts/hostesses and waiters/waitresses, and rocking food.  Best mussels I think I've ever had (and this is not something I run around joking about). I love the soups, the salads, and my favorite - the truffled pasta.   One suggestion for improvement - the wine list could do with more variety in the $35-50 range.   My only true criticism (and I realize this will go in the \"pro\" column for most readers) is that they have a lot of pork going on in there. It's hard to escape it in the menu and in the smell.  But don't let that deter you. If you are looking for perfectly executed foody food with a uniquely Madison approach, you found your destination."}
{"text":"Awesome! Awesome! Awesome! I really do love this place. I've only gone for the Brunch menu but hope to go for dinner or happy hour another time. If you go when it's nice out, sit outside!! It's lovely sitting out there looking over the lake with a mild buzz from the amazing Bloody Marys they serve. I love their Bloody Marys. It's probably the best I've had. We've never made a reservation (even during Sunday brunch) and we did have to wait ~30 minutes. So if you're impatient make sure to make a reservation, otherwise sit at the bar and enjoy a drink! The Arugula, Brie Cheese, Crimini Mushrooms and Scallion omelette is amazing and vegetarian! I was told the Crab cakes and Grilled ribeye were both amazing as well. Parking sucks but you knew this about the capitol area (don't complain) - so bike instead if you can. Service is wonderful, they are so nice! If it was slow I honestly didn't notice because of the amazing view and two bloody marys in my system. My one complaint is the price. Being a graduate student this is not a place I can go to regularly, but I understand why the pricing is what it is.   You know brunch is the most important meal of the week so just head over to Sardine."}
{"text":"My third time at Sardine and it was, again, a solid experience overall. Not too crowded on a Sunday evening around 6pm. We were seated immediately.  I ordered the grilled salmon, which was perfectly cooked and well accompanied by lentils and a spinach/mushroom/tomato sauce. My companion ordered the penne with smoked salmon, which was apparently delicious and a good size portion..   The service here is always attentive, but not overbearing. Although the outdoor seating area was full, we had a nice table with a view of the lake."}
{"text":"It's one of the nicer places for brunch in Madison, but I feel like they don't care very much about the customers. The food is decent (pork plate with rissoto is great), but when I've gone there and have been wanting a little healthier or vegetarian-ish food, they fall short. Plus, I bring in a large group (12-18 people) about once a month and they are so inflexible that they won't replace the fries with anything other than grits (loaded with cheese/cream). I said a scoop of yogurt, a few berries, applesauce --  *anything* would be fine other than a giant pile of empty carbs, but they just won't, as a matter of principle, not cost. This kind of thing really puts me off, when they won't do it just for the sake of rules. Especially when we spend so much money there and they add on a 20% tip. Heck, a half of a nectarine would've shut me up, but they are completely inflexible, just for the sake of being inflexible. I think that Sardine and I have just gone in different directions philosophically in this respect. If you have no special dietary concerns, the food and ambiance is pretty good. Coffee is good as well. Service can be painfully slow, but don't go if you are in a rush and that's fine."}
{"text":"I went for my first time for my birthday and they by far have the best mussels I have ever tasted. Our waiter was fantastic and full of great recommendations for both food and drinks. The atmosphere is inviting and I love that you can see the lake from the bar. I've been told to go back for brunch which I definitely need to do and trust will be just as amazing."}
{"text":"Had dinner here, it was all-around mediocre. Started at the bar with a Bloody, which was pretty good and nicely garnished. The bartender did not crack a smile even once. He exuded an unfriendly attitude that was hard to ignore. We moved to a table by the windows on the lake side. Wow, drafty! For real- I started to get really cold. Perhaps some insulation would be a good idea, or another layer of glass, or...? The food was alright; nothing amazing, though. We had 4 different kinds of oysters, which were shucked nicely and were mighty tasty. Our server was attentive but not obtrusive... however, it just felt rather forced. After all the raves about the Bloodies, I expected better... I thanked the bartender again on the way out for making them (and shot him a smile hoping it might catch...) and was frowned at. Huh, OK, then... I don't think we'll be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I've eaten here one time and have never been slightly tempted to go back. I had a vegetarian pasta dish and it was absolutely mediocre. We also ordered oysters for the table and they were just not good. I'm not sure if it's because I don't like oysters, or just because these particular oysters were not good.  Basically, it's incredibly expensive and no better than any food I've had anywhere else. There are bars in Madison that I feel have better food than this place.  However, if you want a pretentious place to overspend I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Brunch is one of the worst I have ever had in my life.  I paid $8 for a salad that I ate in 3 bites.  I am serious, and I am not a fatty.  I also ordered a mimosa, which was overly pulpy and had a bad strawberry in it, and a super bland bloody mary after telling the waiter I like a spicy bloody.  Our service was horrible too.  It was impossible to ever get our disappearing waiter to serve us.  Disappointing considering I ate dinner here like 5 years ago and it was decent.  This place is an overpriced joke."}
{"text":"We went to Sardine for the first time for Restaurant Week, and it was amazing.  The rock shrimp cakes I had as an appetizer had chunks of shrimp in them, so you really got the whole flavor, were served over a small salad of greens, and came with a delicious sauce that complimented but didn't overpower the cakes themselves.  When I ordered the duck entree (served over a bed of vegetables, some of which I couldn't identify but all of which were delicious with the balsamic ringing my plate), our waitress informed me that the chef recommended this entree be cooked medium.  I like my meat a little less done than the average consumer, and let her know.  When it arrived it was cooked to perfection exactly as I had requested.  Dessert was a great take on the key lime pie - what they called a key lime tart.  A little less tart than its namesake, it sat on a graham cracker crust with a delicious meringue replacing the traditional whipped cream.  My drink (a gin basil smash) was similarly outstanding, but took so long to make that our appetizers arrived ahead of it.  Our entrees were brought out before I had completed my appetizer, and I had noted our server checking to see if I had finished a few times before then.  I'm guessing that the rush was due to it being restaurant week and that at other times you can eat at a bit more leisurely pace.    We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I don't get out early enough in the day for brunch, so I went here for dinner. The location is really nice. It's right on the lake and the decor inside of the building is lovely. We went earlier in the evening and missed the entrance the first time while trying to navigate the traffic, but the silver lining was their private parking lot.  The food was amazing. We tried the pâté while everyone was making up their mind about entrees. I'm usually not a pâté fan, but it was soft and bursting with flavor and meshed well with the bread and mustard. Worth the calories.   I ordered the salmon and it was cooked to perfection. The fish itself was 'melt in your mouth' deliciousness. At first I was worried this place was going to be one of those that tries to be fancier than it really is and only serves you super small tasting portions, but the food was more than enough. I'm a lentil fan by nature, but the way they cook theirs and the sauce they smoother them in makes them the best I've ever had.  And the frites! I didn't care that I had already eaten my entree, when my dining partner couldn't finish them I couldn't say no. They are thin without being crunchy; and not oily.   The only downside was that I seemed to come here on an off day for the service. Other reviewers rave about the service so take my comment about it with a grain of salt, but the waitress totally disappeared after giving us our menus and luckily I was in good company or after the 15 minute wait to get her attention we would have ran out of things to say to each other."}
{"text":"Great brunch. Went here in August before a wedding. The host seated us and then forgot about us. About 10 minutes later he came by and apologized, and offered us free drinks, which was a nice gesture. Then after we ordered our food he said the entire meal would be free!   The food was exactly what I wanted / expected. I had some sort of smoked salmon sandwich, which was great. The mussels were flavorful. The drinks were tasty. The prices are fine.   I would go back anytime."}
{"text":"I had a great experience here. The waiter was excellent, and the rotisserie chicken is awesome! I believe we also had an octopus appetizer that was impressive."}
{"text":"We booked for brunch,(12-27-15) a family of 5 adults. Red the good reviews on Yelp before we went there, so we're excited and we all skip our breakfast to save room for eating lunch in this place. Location and atmosphere is 5 * for a fine dining , the service is 3*, the food itself and Quality is 1 *. Is NOT.! A Fine dining at all.! I order the house burger, it was way to salty! Fries not freshly made, tasted like a day old even the bun with the burger, side salad was blah.! Not season with a dressing. Nothing special with all the other order in our group. There was a mix up with the gift certificate .The waitress quickly grabbed and walked away with the gift cert. Without telling or showing us how much was the bill,  WEIRD.! then he came back 10-15 mins. Later and said that there was only a $28.00 on the GC.? Completely shocked!  When I handed him a GC for $100.00. Costumer beware, when using your gift certificate, the Manager fix the problem, gave her 5 star for that but  not worth coming back. Better off to go to Culvers for Burger and fries!"}
{"text":"It is located by the lake with patio seating. My co-workers loved their food but I was unimpressed with mine.  The cheese plate is tiny without any crackers to go with.  My roasted chicken was uninspired and tough. The octopus appetizer is overpowered by the curry.  Lastly,  the almond cake, though moist and crunchy, made my spring allergies worse because of the edible flower petals.  This restaurant is not gluten-free friendly."}
{"text":"Sardine is just splendid.  My husband's mother and boyfriend came from across the pond and we decided to celebrate here tonight.  We shared a bottle of wine, had great conversation and slowly filled our bellies with some wonderful French food.  I ordered the salmon with lentils, sautéed spinach, portobello mushrooms, tomatoes, and beurre blanc.  It was exactly what I was looking for.  My husband ordered the evening special of duck confit with cabbage and glazed carrots.  The glazed carrots with this dish will go down as one of the best things I've ever eaten... I felt bad but I stole most of them from him.  Dessert was gorgeous...I had a hazelnut ganache with caramel and it was sinfully delicious.  My mother in law ordered a plum cake with the best roasted almond ice cream.  Our server was fun and made our meal even better....I cannot wait to go back for brunch...and happy hour...and dinner."}
{"text":"Nobody left this place disappointed...in our group anyway. Casual dining with plenty of seating & fancy plating. Great place to have a dinner date with a partner, group of friends or even family with older kids but not babies or toddlers. FYI, they don't have kids' menu. Great food that'll satisfy your palate. A bit pricey, but it's expected."}
{"text":"Sardine is one of my favorite brunch spots in Madison. Besides the good food, the location is right off the lake and the restaurant has great ambiance. My go to is the smoked salmon sandwich that is served with mixed greens and frites, and of course a bloody mary on the side. If your a bloody mary drinker, expect this one to be a little different than your standard bloody, but it's still good and worth a try.  Brunch is usually busy here, but we've never had a problem or wait to really get a table for two. I recommend grabbing a seat at the bar if you can, which is not much different than sitting at one of the high tops anyway (plus you'll avoid any wait). If you're coming in a large group, I would definitely call in advance for reservations.  I don't think you can really go wrong with any of their menu items. People rave even about the burger on their menu. I've only had brunch here, so I can't comment on their dinner options.  The one thing that can be a challenge at times is parking, as Sardine is in Machinery Row which  is a building shared by other businesses. You may find yourself patiently waiting for a spot to open up when its busy. :)"}
{"text":"Great place for a local brew and oysters with a view. Come for the oysters happy hour to try 4 kinds of oysters from Australia, west, and east coasts and some Ale Asylum craft beer."}
{"text":"I'm not much of a brunch person but this is one fun and nice place for it. Our \"day after a wedding\" group of 12 enjoyed a nice meal here in this French inspired restaurant. The Bloody Marys were excellent.  Though I must caution you on the large Mimosas - no price on the menu - they are $15 each!  Zounds!    The Croque Monseurs and Madams were deemed a success as was the smoked salmon dish. Everyone seemed satisfied by this experience.  Which is hard to do with a group this big.   An error on one of the bills was quickly and smoothly resolved.    Next visit to Madison I need to try dinner here."}
{"text":"Absolutely excellent. Anthony was our server and he was just phenomenal. The gnocchi is spectacular. The salmon and the trout are just crazy good. The chocolate cake dessert is deliciously great.  Highly recommended. We were a party of 8 people and everyone loved the food."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here on New Years Eve and it was fantastic.  Going to give it another try on Valentines Day.  I would recommend to anyone who wants a high end meal."}
{"text":"Lunch is really good. But dinner is so disappointed. Went there with friends, the size of everyone's meal is small, extra small. But the price is crazy. Many things can not taste out what that is. Disappointed."}
{"text":"The space is gorgeous and the atmosphere is relaxing and bright.  The open air patio with view of lake (over a busy parking lot) is also quite nice, although often a long wait for seating there.   Although the restaurant was quite empty on an early Sunday morning, we were seated next to a table with 3 rather rowdy children.  We also found that flies were lighting on our bare legs and feet, which was quite creepy.  We asked if we could be seated elsewhere but the server admitted that the files were problematic all over the space and she didn't have any suggestions as to where might be any better.  I was almost tempted to walk out, but had an idea.  On a cool morning, not so many flies outside. We asked to be re-seated on the patio.  The hostess seemed annoyed (she often does), but we were delighted to have no more flies.    My meal was average (the waffle with fruit).  Sadly there were many bitter pieces of a burned prior waffle stuck in mine.  My friend enjoyed her egg dish and coffee.  Service was poor as had to ask repeatedly for beverage refills.  We did, however, linger awhile after the meal without any dirty looks.  Overall, rather average food, nice atmosphere, but pricey."}
{"text":"The mussels and frites are a deal!  It was more food than I expected and very reasonably priced.  The mussels in white wine had an excellent broth, and you also get 4 slices of baguette for dipping into the broth.  In addition, the plate of frites with aioli was much more than I expected. You could definitely share this between 2 people.  My BF ordered the beet cured salmon for brunch...it is honestly too small to be a meal unless you were not very hungry in the first place.  The salmon preparation was a little reminiscent of herring.  I may order the mussels and frites when I come again.  Your best bet is to sit next to the window overlooking the lake if you can."}
{"text":"Wow! What a great restaurant in terms of location, food, service and management!  Hosted party of 20 and everyone was thrilled with their food and excellent service.  I was so pleased at the professionalism of Jarrod who was my \"go to\" person and didn't disappoint. The mussels, salmon, lamb chops are just some of the choices our guests enjoyed and all can't wait to go back.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"I've visited Sardine twice for Sunday brunch. I love the atmosphere and haven't had a miss on the food yet. The first time I was with a large group and we had reservations, were seated promptly, and my baked creamed eggs were heavenly.  I think about 4 of us in our group of 12 ordered the same thing, and one person had to send their dish back- it was way undercooked. The waitress remedied this as quickly as possible with a new dish.     The second time, I had a group of 4 and no reservations. We waited about half an hour (arriving around 11:30), which seemed reasonable, especially since the day was so lovely! Lots of runners and bikers out, spring is arriving in Madison! I had the arugula, brie, crimini, scallion omelette. It was very very good, especially the bites that contained all the ingredients, and the frites are delightful.  One of my dining companions got the baked creamed eggs, and those were again the best dish on the table. Now I know not to stray next time!  I would like to visit Sardine for dinner and sample the rest of the menu, but for brunch, Sardine is a solid winner."}
{"text":"What a great place for dinner! It's nice to dine at a place that's fancy enough and welcomes children at the same time.  They were very flexible about our reservation and service was prompt, courteous, and attentive.    For starters, my husband had oysters and I had the sardines (of course!).  Dinner for me were mussels and frites which were very addictive to eat and my husband had the mahi-mahi.  And yes...we fed our children and they had buttered orrichiette. We skipped dessert but I'm sure that would've been good too.  Does this have better food than Nostranos?  Maybe...but what this place had was a welcoming atmosphere which is more than I can say about the pretentious ambience at Nostranos!"}
{"text":"Very good food!!! Very professional and fancy food! The steak was a little to salty but otherwise everything's else I ordered was delicious. Our server was so nice and very accommodating."}
{"text":"Where to begin with this restaraunt. My husband and I were relaxing by the waterfront and wanting to grab something to eat, I am of French descent and love French food. I was disappointed overall. I ordered the cheese plate which the waiter did not take the time to explain the different cheeses and instead runs off and we had to about 10 minutes longer between each action we wanted. The waiter who looked like Jeff goldgloom seemed impatient with us, while the nice young lady at the table behind us was giving excellent service to an older couple explaining things and actually talked to us. My husband ordered the olive oil poached tuna which tasted like tuna from a can and the salad part tasted like everything was pickled. I ordered the lamb meatballs as well which tasted like turkey not lamb and were very bland. We were going to order big plates after this but the food was so not up to par we thought dessert may be better. Looked at the menu and instead left. Prices were ridiculous as well for the taste of the food. Only reason it's getting 2 stars instead of one is that the wine was great and the view was nice."}
{"text":"I only spent a little bit of time in Madison, but I won't soon forget dinner at Sardine. What a wonderful restaurant. They had at the bar one of the most skilled bartenders I have ever seen, who made me one of the most amazing drinks I've ever had. Their menu of specialty drinks are incredible. The food also spot on.   The location is one of the best parts about it too, with great views of the lake, a beautiful, classic, yet modern space, its very comfortable to spend a good deal of time in the building.  I can't wait to go again, if I'm ever back in Madison again!"}
{"text":"Great brasserie style restaurant. Very casual French. Right by the lake. Nice views. I had mussels cooked with wine and fennel they came with frites and alioli. They have  a nice wine list with reasonably priced wines we offer classic dishes like oysters on the half shell and also croque madame croque monsieur and the other things you would expect to find in a French Bistro a little pricey but not insane I would highly recommend"}
{"text":"Best food we've ever had! Made our night even more special. The whitefish was out of this world! If you're in Madison its a must go."}
{"text":"Sardine is a Madison classic and frequently comes up as my top restaurant recommendation in the area. The food is impeccable and the space is quite charming.   If you want the full experience, you should make it for happy hour (4-6pm) for half-price oysters, $5 wine, and $4 beer. They also have a small food menu with happy hour specials, but most of those items are also available for dinner. Dinner is quite good. I've had the vegetarian pasta special and also tried some of their fish entrees. They focus on French cuisine, so everything always has a fancy spin to it, along with great wine options. It would be great if they had more than just 1 vegetarian options on the dinner menu.  Personally, my favorite meal at Sardine is brunch. The frites that come with entrees? The frites! They are to die for. I also love that you get both greens AND frites, as its normally the hardest decision I make on Sundays at other locations. Standout entrees at brunch are the smoked salmon sandwich and the mushroom omelette. It's also a rather nice experience to sit on the patio with a lake view in the summer, if you can score one of those tables.   I'm rather smitten with Sardine and can't wait to go back, likely in the very near future."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here for our anniversary.  The entire meal was amazing from start to finish including drinks and dessert.  This place has some French flaire with the simple yet elegant ambiance, outstanding food and great service.  I will be coming back again!"}
{"text":"Don't go if it's a special occasion like Father's Day. I just had the experience of having our entrees both poorly done, and in my case twice. We ordered our steaks medium rare they came, both of them, well done. We asked for them to redo the steaks, which they did. My husband's replacement steak was adequate, but not great, and my steak tasted like somebody had poured an entire can of salt on it. It was disgusting and totally inedible. I decided at that point not to try for third time because by that point my husband and my son were halfway finished with their meals, and I felt like it would be incredibly annoying for them to have to wait on me.  Thanks for ruining my outng with my husband for Father's Day.  And thank you for deciding that comping a $9 glass of wine is an adequate response for ruining this special occasion."}
{"text":"Sardine is one of the absolute best places in Madison. Its location right near Lake Monona is prime; the food, ambiance, and service cannot be beat. My girlfriend and I were looking for a new place for our Sunday brunch ritual when the weather is nice out. Sardine did not disappoint.  We grabbed seats at the bar because the patio, as expected, had a 30+ minute wait. We immediately ordered mimosas and screwdrivers. We ordered a side of frites as a way to settle in, followed by the Sardine Caesar, complete with anchovies. I ordered the Croque Madame for my main course, my girlfriend had a prosciutto/gruyere dish. Both of these meals were exemplary and had great flavor. I was glad to see the restaurant sticks to the essentials for their French breakfast and lunch.  The food was to die for; their take on classic French cuisine will certainly exceed your expectations. The French bistro decor is wonderful in creating the true French culinary experience. The vaulted ceilings, large tables, dishware, and all the other nuances of an upscale French restaurant are present here.   Although it's a bit expensive, the prices here at worth it and very justifiable if you're looking for a nicer place to experience an elevated, classic French brunch."}
{"text":"I finally had a chance to check this place out, although it was just for a professional networking happy hour. Regardless, the atmosphere is really nice and the service was pleasant.  I guess the only complaint I have is their beer tap handles. They use fashionable knobs that all look the same and lack any sort of labeling. Sure, it looks pleasing to the eye, but I want a beer and I don't know what you have on tap without bothering you to verbally list everything. Unfortunately, this meant I drank what everyone else was drinking because I didn't want to be that guy in a buys bar taking up too much of the bar tenders time.  Now I just need to come by for a meal and truly experience what Sardine is all about."}
{"text":"Love Sardine! Always a great choice for a special occasion! Service, food and ambiance are wonderful."}
{"text":"Well prepared, well executed food. Great date atmosphere. It took a while to get our drinks and our waiter seemed busy with more affluent looking customers. In the end we go back. The setting and food are too good to pass up and worth forgetting the okay service we received. I'd like to go back for happy our."}
{"text":"Effortlessly melding French class with a healthy dose of rustic charm, this trendy French-American bistro manages to delight the palates and unfailing expectations of culinary enthusiasts plate by plate. Whether in search of decadent brunch offerings or more savory dinner entrees, Sardine is sure to impress any quality food seeking individual with its menu of locally sourced and Parisian-influenced dishes. Inconspicuously situated along Madison's Lake Monona in the city's Machinery Row district, Sardine undoubtedly heightens the bar and earns its place among the best of Madison's food scene.   The inner portion of the restaurant is inherently unassuming in character and in most part relies on natural wood elements that carry throughout the space, while of course taking advantage of the views offered by Sardine's lakeside locale. A defining feature of the restaurant's ambience is the large wooden beams that traverse the length of the ceiling and contribute a sense of continuity in spite of the assorted half-walls and brick facades that serve to apportion the dining area into various subdivisions. The amalgam of earthiness and a refined touch of class invariably deems the interior space a rustic warehouse of sorts, making Sardine the perfect backdrop for an innately distinct dining experience.   A sheer glance at the ingenious menu will enthuse the senses and riddle the mind to such an extent that skimming each listed entrée will most likely result in an unprecedented level of indecision and self-doubt. To illustrate, a main source of Sardine's rising popularity lies with the glorious execution of its weekend brunch. Now, the institution of \"brunch\" in itself presents quite the conundrum in that it forces diners to face the weighty decision of sweet or savory, and, more explicitly, breakfast or lunch. Then add to this the fact that Sardine's brunch menu consists of nothing but exceptionally delicious offerings and the former indecision subsequently escalates. And yet, this initial \"struggle\", so to speak, with regards to the menu, is singular in nature, for straight upon that first bite of whatsoever dish is chosen, the earlier hesitation and reservations in settling on a meal are conclusively unfounded and without warrant. Rather, each selection is sure to defy preconceived notions as to the flavors of the various meals due to the level of mastery with which each item is prepared.   Omelettes are artfully crafted with flavor variations ranging from the more simplistic to the increasingly indulgent. Fines herbes and gruyere cheese...spinach, roasted cherry tomatoes, goat cheese and bacon...arugula, brie cheese, crimini mushrooms and scallions...all of which effectively define decadence. Also flaunted on Sardine's brunch menu include such dishes as a warm duck confit salad, as well as steamed mussels, Norwegian salmon, and the ever-popular croque monsieur sandwich of bayonne ham and gruyere cheese. These savory selections are brilliantly supplemented with a few sugary concoctions that manage to find their way onto the same menu in a welcome fashion. One such dish is the buckwheat Belgian waffle that is served with a whipped cinnamon orange butter, sliced banana, and pure maple syrup, absolutely shining as a collective with its refreshing citrus notes and satisfying sweetness.   As a whole, Sardine executes on all levels. Enticing its patrons with a delicious array of French-inspired classics that satisfy both palate-wise and visually, compelling all who frequent Sardine to feel graced with the pleasure of having dined at one of Madison's top bistros."}
{"text":"I have been to Sardine 3 times in the past two years, and I have had mixed experiences. The first time I went I had the Roasted Half Chicken, and it was delicious - tender, juicy, and excellently flavored with herbs, predominately rosemary. My daughter had it a few months ago when we went again, and it was just as good. One time I had the grilled duck breast, and it was also delicious, and the accompanying veggies were perfectly cooked (not overdone) and were a creative mix. I also tried a great house salad then, and the vinaigrette was well done and not too heavily applied. But the last time I went was on a Friday, and the place was hopping busy (good for them - I always like to see a Madison restaurant getting business). Two of us had the steak frites, and honestly, the ribeyes were ok, but my guy actually makes far better steaks at home (he has a gift). But I wouldn't have held that against them so much, except the frites part of the meal was a big disappointment. Three of us had frites with our meal, and even though the place was busy so the kitchen should have been cranking out fries constantly, all of us had lukewarm soggy fries. These are matchstick fries, people, which should be crispy on the outside and just a hint of tender on the inside. Clearly, the kitchen hadn't bothered to cook our frites just for us, and you know, for an entree that cost $23, we should have received freshly cooked fries. Having said that, I am probably going to try Sadine, and the frites, again. Maybe some terrible tragedy was taking shape in the kitchen that night. I always give a place at least two tries before I pan it for good."}
{"text":"Went to Sardine for Valentine's Day.  Service was great.  The atmosphere is elegant yet subdued but a little on the snooty side.  The Sardine appetizer is a pass.  It had a fishy smell and taste.  The cassoulet was delicious though.  Stick toffey pudding was fantastic too.  The food may not be as adventurous as L'Etoile or Harvest, but it is priced appropriately."}
{"text":"I finally came to Sardine for dinner- and it blew my mind! Lived up to everything I thought it would be and more.   we ate:  appetizers: -fried smelt (I am not a fish lover-- but the people who love smelt, loved this dish!) -sardine caesar salad: YUM -roasted beet and carrot salad: YUM YUM  mains (don't laugh that we got pasta at a french place...): -penne: too full to eat- but ate the next day and so flavorful! loved everybite! the sauce is delicate and compliments the dish so well -House-made cavatelli: phenomenol! if you love mushrooms- look no further -Sardine burger (which I saw on the bar menu-- so amazing with fig aioli on it. WOW! mind-blowing) even better than the brunch burger  Dessert: -pumpkin bread pudding (so light and delish!)  We *heart* sardine"}
{"text":"This place gave me the worst food poisoning of my like.  I was served undercooked pork.  Not only did the food make me sick but it didnt taste great either.  I would not go here again.   Very overpriced for the experience."}
{"text":"Coming here with a bunch of friends to have brunch on a fine Sunday afternoon. Of course, we made a reservation ahead, otherwise, no room would be spared. Sardine on weekends is always packed.  That Sunday was ended with a happy stomach full with their salad, steamed mussels, frites with mayo, and chocolate cake.  The mussels came in a huge portion so I had to box some. It was good and I loved the frites with mayo (reminding me of the Belgian munchies) and the chocolate cake.  The service was excellent. Our waitress was responsive and smiley. We got two bottles of water early on, so we didn't have to worry about the refills.   It was one fine brunch day with my girls. Thank you, Sardine!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for Sunday night dinner late and had the chicken I'd heard so much about.  Fantastic.  Others in my party had more traditional bistro dishes and all were satisfied.    Can't discuss the noise issue too much since the place was pretty much empty at 10 PM on a Sunday but I'll be heading back for sure."}
{"text":"I have been to Sardine twice now.  The first time I was extremely pleased and my most recent visit was even more memorable.  For an appitizer, I had the scallops in apple cider reduction.  The reduction added a nice acidity that balanced out the richness of the scallops with light greens added for texture.  For a main course I had the flounder with a grapefruit vinaigrette.  Another dish that was beaming with color and flavor.  The main course used napa cabbage, parsnips and haricots verts to add crunch, which offset the texture of the fish.  Great service also and you can even find some great beer on tap.  Hard to find a Goose Island Matilda anywhere else.  Love this place."}
{"text":"To the Madison locals who 'eat here regularly and think it's better than the places they've eaten in New York, and that this is the standard they compare their NY eating experiences to', I can only say: What??!!! Do you eat at The Olive Garden in Times Square when you go to NY?! I grew up in Madison (still a food wasteland as far as I am concerned) and lived in NYC for twelve years. All I can say is the food at Sardine is mediocre at best. I think Madison restaurant diners are not that sophisticated, which is the only explanation I can find for the higher ratings this place has received from others. My soup was lukewarm, my lamb was completely forgettable, and my dining companion's pasta was awash in oil and/or butter (I find too many Madison restaurants like to drench pasta in butter). Far worse, however, was the service. The waitress was hostile and unpleasant in the extreme! Considering that her table was occupied by one cookbook author and one Chicago B&B owner (she wasn't aware of this, we were both civilized and unpretentious and I was as nice and conciliatory as possible under the circumstances), I can only say that she earned the restaurant one star for service alone. She should be fired, and I have never wished that upon anyone (I was once a waitress for a summer and know how hard it can be). I noticed they got themselves mentioned on Tasting Table (my cookbook, A Taste of Heaven was also reviewed on Tasting Table) and I can only conclude that they are better at delivering PR than delivering high quality food or service. Try Harvest or L'etoile when you are in Madison."}
{"text":"Good food, good drinks. I have come here several times and I have not been disappointed. A little too pricey, but otherwise a safe choice. Good bloody mary."}
{"text":"Everything we are was simply delicious and well executed. Three days later we can't stop talking about the food. A plus, our server, Guierrmo (?? I think?) was awesome!"}
{"text":"On a recent visit, our table wasn't ready when we arrived so we went to the bar for a few minutes. I had a glass of water which I then took along when our table opened up. Now, the glass of water given at the bar and the glass of water given at tables are different. (One's taller than the other.) Our server asked to take away my bar glass. I declined. When he returned with bread, he tried to take the glass. On his next visit to drop off appetizers, he swiped my glass and replaced it with a table glass. Clearly, I had underestimated how important water glass symmetry is at Sardine.  Also, it must be noted how over-the-top enthusiastic and borderline patronizing this server was. Every order was answered with a giggle and a cartoonish response about what a good choice we'd made. Fortunately, my partner did make a good choice and loved the steak. Unfortunately, my fish was sort of dry.  Nice atmosphere, though."}
{"text":"I went here with my friends from out of town and we had a nice time but I was very unimpressed with the food.   We had a bit of the wait for the patio but it was totally fine because the bar was really nice. The atmosphere at this place is a 10/10 inside and out. They have a beautiful location minus the parking lot sitting between the patio and the lake.   The drinks were good. They have a small but quality beer selection and a good wine list. However, the food is NOT very good and I was pretty unhappy with it for the price and portion size.   This place gets a 1 for food and a 5 for ambiance. Hence my 3 star rating."}
{"text":"If you want to escape the burgers and beer for a night, choose Sardine!  Lovely food expertly prepared.  Complex dishes prepared consistently well.  Also, a good wine list and creative cocktail menu.  A trendy-free zone, also.  So many Madison restaurants are self-consciously trying too hard to be fashionable. At Sardine, the ambience, service and menu are not about being hip, but about being excellent.  Beautiful converted factory space with gorgeous natural wood."}
{"text":"I would like to assess Sardine as if it were two different places. #1 as a Brunch Place and #2 as a dinner establishment, because I have very different feelings towards the two.   Part 1: Brunch at Sardine  Do it! Get a strong drink! Get a pastry! Get the shrimp and crab cakes!  These are best enjoyed with friends or loved ones. All of the food was delicious, the staff was amicable and great. Honestly, brunch here revived my appreciation for Colectivo's black and Tan coffee.   Part 2: Date Night Dinner at Sardine  Maybe don't do it. You are packed in the restaurant like sardines.  The food is overpriced. Good, but I could make the salmon, steak, or lamb chops at home and be happier with more money in my wallet. The staff was still nice and the drinks just as strong as breakfast.   It is a good dinner spot, but I think people just get a little too hyped for it.  Brunch, yes. Dinner, meh."}
{"text":"Was in town visiting some friends, and had a great dinner here.  Delicious mussels appetizer, nice salad, and special sea bass with local and heirloom tomatoes, the latter of which I am a complete sucker for.  The view was gorgeous, and we got a great table near the windows overlooking the lake.  The service was slow on the night we were there, but I get the sense that was an unusual circumstance, because the waiter was otherwise very attentive and courteous."}
{"text":"Very loud. Be prepared to have to about shout at the person you're with to be heard.  The food was not good.  I would suggest you skip this place."}
