{"text":"I don't know what everyone is complaining about! I for  one had a wonderful time at Starving Artist when my friend and I headed there for brunch on a Sunday after yoga!! The decor is inviting and not pretentious, the servers are polite but not intrusive, and the food was sizeably portioned and really hit the spot. The prices are decent too. I had the eggs benny with tomatos and fruits, and my friend had the eggs benny with avocado and maple beans. The eggs on the benny were poached to a T and the hollandaise sauce married the subtely sweet and crispy waffle well with the creamy soft egg. Even the fruits were really well chosen: a nice array of watermelon, orange and grapefruit slices, as well as grapes and berries (blueberries, blackberries, strawberries AND raspberries!). I really think my meal was perfect, not only because it was tasty, but also because it was appropriately-sized so I didn't finish the meal feeling like I had just been rendered comatose by a grease truck, which is how I usually feel when I go out for brunch, so that was a nice change.

Can't speak for the coffee cuz I didn't have any, but the next time I go there, (which will definitely be soon) I'll be trying the raspberry milkshake. I saw someone else drinking their milkshakes and they looked gooood.

I would say the only drawback is the long long line-up, but one would expect that for any decent brunch place. That being said, the staff treat you well while you're waiting in line and do their best to get you a table as quickly as possible. I might mention that they also have comfy couches for you to lounge about on whilst you're waiting for your table.

It's safe to say that I quite like this place and I think it's a very welcomed addition to the St. Clair West neighborhood."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. The idea of a wafflery is brilliant. Definitely disappointed by their potato waffles, but their regular waffles are great. The big problem with this place is they haven't perfected their sides yet. Hopefully they will."}
{"text":"had to wait awhile, but it was more than worth it.  When you look at this little kitchen, you can't believe what good food it turns out.  There were 5 of us and we all had something different.  We all enjoyed our brunch.  Best coffee ever!!"}
{"text":"Simply Amazing! The eggs benedict are the best I've ever tried. The atmosphere and service are also really good. I want to go there every Sunday for brunch! :)"}
{"text":"Reluctantly chose this spot for a family day outing. I was worried based on the reviews but after showing up within an hour to closing and still receiving friendly and courteous service I figured I would take a moment to write a positive review. 

The food was fantastic, we had the loaded waffles and my two little sisters under the age of 10 had waffles and fruit. Both were tasty and just the right amount of food. 

The coffee was great, and the girls loved the pineapple juice, but the bacon here is really worth mentioning. Soooo delicious, with a hint of sweetness really setting it apart. 

Definitely recommended, particularly if you have a thing for waffles."}
{"text":"I almost feel that the only thing I need to write here is \"Maple Bacon Waffles\" and leave it at that! I'd been heading to Starving Artist for mid-week brunch with friends for almost 6-months before I noticed the bacon waffles on the menu as a side. OK, if you A. love bacon (so 95% of the population because even my vegan friends eat bacon!) and B. understand the need for REAL maple syrup as well as 3. crave that tasty mix of salt & sweet in your food, then bacon waffles are for you! They dip strips of bacon in waffle batter, put them in the waffle maker and serve them up like a little log cabin with a ramekin of delicious Canadian maple syrup inside. Pure Heaven. 
On top of that, the rest of the waffle based menu is delicious, budget friendly and even the coffee is acceptable. Cranky old me will even put up with the \"Peter Pan Generation\" (my loving attempt to categorize the \"hipsters\") that saturate the place with their \"cool\", for what SA is serving up on the menu. Weekends are insanely busy from opening until about 3PM so if you don't like waiting, head over during the week or have breakfast for dinner, they're open late!"}
{"text":"I've only been there for breakfast. I was searching online to find gluten free waffles, and there they were!

My first gluten free waffles that I didn't make in the last half-decade! Hurrah! They were delicious, the coffee was great. Both sweet and savoury waffles.

My friends shared an order of their bacon waffle in addition to their breakfasts and said it was OK, but not amazing."}
{"text":"It was awful and distracting to watch the female manager treat not only the employees but the table next to us and myself like garbage. 
Literally threw cold crappy bacon on my table. Was more interested in texting then helping. Looks like Starving Artist has got too big for it's britches. 
I emailed a kind letter to the info@starvingartist.ca link. It was an FYI to the owners. I'd want to know if this happened in my resto. But, no response. I won't be going back. 
The staff was brutal. And the food wasn't good enough to make up for it."}
{"text":"Smoked salmon sandwich surprised me. So good!"}
{"text":"Fun concept but not well executed ... eggs benny and chicken waffle sandwich were a let down. Nice atmosphere and coffee though."}
{"text":"Nathan was our server,  he was super friendly and attentive.  Waffles were sufficiently waffley. Vanilla almond latte was great and now I have fantastic coffee shakes.  A++ would waffle again"}
{"text":"I came in with my friend and fiancé,they sat us at the back. First of I was literally 2 steps from the washroom &storage room.
Me and my buddy ordered waffles with bacon. I also got a coffee when my coffee came my waitress gave it to me she did not ask me if I would need any milk or cream or sugar. I had to get up my self and ask for it.
The coffee was ok, the food was meh nothing special.
It's not rocket science about putting waffle and bacon together,  the waffles are bland no taste.
None of the stuff bothered that much to complain till one of the waiters or cleaner came to get something out of the storage room.
 (during the time the place was still open )let me say 
  their was grime build up all over the storage room wall it was all black (THE SMELL) that came from this room was so bad it was just wrong.
To do that during service"}
{"text":"We (party of 3)  were there for Monday brunch and it was horrible. Long wait at the door before getting acknowledged and seated altho there were plenty of seats. There was one server, one person on the front cash and one cook. We got our table and ordered right away. The food took long to come, however the table who got seated after us got their food first. The server apologized and said she didn't know what happened. The food was mediocre and two of our eggs Benny had broken egg shells in them. The server also spilled the hollandaise sauce on my mom's straw hat. The server apologized and comped one or our eggs benny. It was a disturbing experience. Will NOT be back."}
{"text":"Misleading name. I have a feeling waffles are cheaper to produce than toast, so kudos to the owners for a savvy business move.

  For $9 before tax you can get 4 vegan mini waffles with a few pieces of lettuce('salad') and some beans from a can on the side. Fine, I guess. But after all the raves I read for this place, I just don't get it. Perhaps it's because I'm a bit anti-brunch in general. The space is nice. The service was. ..  passable. But I won't be back."}
{"text":"The only reason I went to the Starving Artist was to have the Salmon Sandwich.
My expectations were high.
I am not a waffle fan, but I love Salmon.
Now after indulging in this I can safely say it was worth the trip.
The Salmon was pink and soft. Just the way I like it.
The bonus that day  was the chocolate milk shake, one I savored all the way home.

Now I get why there is a line outside."}
{"text":"Came here just after noon with a party of 4. Waited about 30 minutes before we were seated, and it only took this long because the patio wasn't open due to the rain. We were surprised with how big the interior was, and noticed a wide board games selection (perhaps you can play Scrabble while eating brunch?).

To start, I had the vanilla almond latte which is on the sweeter side but definitely tasty. We also ordered a side of waffle bacon which is bacon dipped in the waffle batter. Amazingly, it doesn't tasty oily or fatty at all - you can enjoy this snack guilt-free!

It became clear that the restaurant does not believe in bread. Every dish that should come with bread comes with waffles instead.

We had the following dishes:
1) Breakfast Benny (potato waffles, poached eggs, caramelized bacon, hollandaise sauce) - mashed potatoes are mixed in the waffle batter and surprisingly it doesn't taste too heavy! Definitely a different spin on eggs benedict and I really enjoyed it. Comes with a salad and a choice of a fruit salad, beans, or potato salad. This dish was the perfect combination of sweet and savoury.
2) The Hitchhiker (two mini waffles, cheesy scrambled eggs, four pieces of caramelized bacon ) - your typical breakfast meal which leaves you satisfied. Also comes with a salad and your choice of sides.
3) Chicken Bacon Club (roasted chicken, bacon, havarti, cucumber and secret sauce sandwiched in waffles) - ever had a sandwich with waffles instead of bread? We didn't think it was possible, but this sandwich was recently in Toronto Life's top 20 list for that very reason. Also comes with a salad and your choice of sides."}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday brunch at 9:30 expecting a long wait and were pleasantly surprised to be seated right away in a nearly-empty restaurant. 

Our server was friendly (but not obnoxiously so). We ordered coffee right away and were served two Americanos - a nice surprise, and they were fantastic.

It was hard to decide what to order since everything sounded so good. If you're a fan of eggs benedict, you'll have the same problem. I settled on the breakfast benny (two poached eggs, caramelized bacon & hollandaise served on two potato waffles) and my husband chose the waffle benny (same as the breakfast benny but with plain waffles instead of potato waffles). They were served with mixed greens in balsamic vinaigrette and choice of fruit, potato salad, or baked beans.

Our orders took a little while to come out considering how quiet the place was, but it was worth it. Breakfast benny - oh man. The potato waffles were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, and had a ton of savoury flavour. Only issue was one of my eggs was overcooked, and this coupled with the fact that the eggs aren't served with a generous amount of hollandaise meant half of my eggs benny was a bit dry - no runny yolk to help extend the hollandaise. Still, the flavour was good enough to make up for it. The waffle benny was even better, with a crispier texture and a sweetness that nicely complemented the hollandaise, bacon, and eggs.

Verdict: Not a flawless meal but pretty damn close. Good, hearty food, good service, and good value. Overall, I was impressed and am really looking forward to going again."}
{"text":"I am so shocked to see all of these amazing reviews for this place.  It was a cute spot, we were seated on the patio until there was a crazy mother load of bees.  Sadly, we trucked our butts inside to be seated in a corner with a great view of the kitchen.

The chefs seemed to be having a great time.   Service was slow, however, they were friendly, patient and witty.  Genuine spirits, so exhausted from the heat, I can only imagine how they really felt about working sans AC w/ an open kitchen!

OK food:

Gluten free - vegan waffles were nice.   Not sweet and not chewy.   I had them with the Breakfast Benny.  The fruit was fresh and lovely. 

My breakie date had the same with beans.  Ah, yes, there is caramelized bacon on the little benny as well.    He Loved it, I was not sold, as is clear from my post. 

I love that they have the GF option.  I won't bring my cash or my date here again.   I am still happy I tried it. 

Starving Artist? How did you get your name if you have a Suburban with a licence plate that says Waffles on it.......

I'm not sure anyone is starving anymore :P

they seem to have a solid space for a party - and booy do they party - 

meh, just not for me."}
{"text":"Nice décor and no crappy drip coffee (americanos instead - get a double).  Like the theme of waffle everything too.  Had the waffle Benny and it didn't disappoint.  Waffles were nice, but the caramelized bacon was the icing on the cake.  Very nice and friendly service considering how busy it was on a Wednesday late morning.  Would have giving a five of some of the fruit wasn't over ripe.  Finally, something that gives boom a challenge.  I bet this place is busy on the weekends though... But all that means is get up early to avoid waits people."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast joints in Toronto.  They know quality and they know how to serve everything on a Waffle.  Great tunes and lots of love here."}
{"text":"Good service. We ordered the eggs Benny waffle and starving waffle which was two waffles served with bananas. The eggs Benny was cooked excellent and the bacon was a good addition. The only thing that was weird is they asked which side for the sweet waffle and we asked for fruit and they brought fruit and salad. I'm not into salad with icing sugar....just saying... Overall good bench experience!"}
{"text":"Slow slow and unorganized hostess service. Very frustrating. For a brunch place, it is soooooo slow. Water jug never returned when we asked for replacement. Fruit bowls came with dirty unwashed fruit. Not sure how our waffles are like since we have been waiting for forty minutes. Cash only with their only atm is a cash grab and I agree with other reviewers on this. The only saving grace (ironic cos it's also a name of a brunch place) is our apologetic and fast server.

Update: :$50++ for brunch ?? Really ???"}
{"text":"Not great....just ok...food bland.  Music too loud.  Service slow even at 3:00 in the afternoon.   Took 20 min just to take our order and the place was dead."}
{"text":"Went to the starving artist on a Saturday afternoon in the summer for brunch. 

Both the patios were full, so we sat indoors. They have large windows so there was enough light and a cool breeze. 

My friend is vegan and wanted to try out this place more than me. He got the vegan waffles with a bunch of vegetables - peppers, tomatoes, olives, etc. 

I got the eggs benny which were delish. The potato waffles are to die for. Very satisfying meal. I wish they had freshly squeezed orange juice, but no biggie, was all good. 

I had a bite of the vegan waffle which had a slightly sweet taste and cake like texture, still quite good.

Would definitely go back. Was an amazing brunch. Next time, I'll probably get one of the other savory waffles - maybe the smoked salmon or the chicken. Maybe even a dessert waffle. Cos the TSA is waffle heaven."}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday morning brunch and got here by 12:30. Had to wait about 30 min but it wasn't too bad they had couches you can sit on in the waiting area. 

I ordered the waffles benny and it was amazing! If you love eggs benny and you love waffles, you can't go wrong. I wish I ordered the potato waffle option for $2 more though, it would have been more savoury."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place! I have not been to the other location so I can't compare. The food was great, and a good price. I had the breakwhich which was a mini waffle sandwich with fried egg, cheese and turkey. The special sauce really sealed the deal. Was not happy that it was cash only. We are starving artists, we dont carry cash we carry plastic! Waitress and hostess were nice and attentive. Food arrived pretty fast. No issues with the service and it wasnt super busy for 12 on a Friday. I will definitely go back and will have to check the other location."}
{"text":"Had one of the vegan waffle sandwiches. Unfortunately it was one of the only choices that I could order, although they advertised as vegan friendly,  and the sandwich was quite bland and not very filling. 
The people that I was with ordered the eggs Benedict, and they were also surprised at the lack of taste for the price."}
{"text":"Dead fly in food! Awful customer service. Do not waste your time and money. ... When I informed the waitress about the dead bug in my food, she said \"oh, it is extra protein\" and tried to laugh it off. It was disgusting. I lost my appetite. The waitress and mgr tried to bring me another meal however it took another 25 mins and it was undercooked when it arrived. To top it off, the mgr was rude and asked me if I wanted a free drink instead of compensating me for the meal. Unacceptable & unbelievable. My friends and I will never return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"I ordered the apple crumble ice cream waffle on a Thursday evening at 10pm. They had a comedy night going the night we went. The comedians were ok I had a few chuckles. Let me just say the place is quite small. They had the stage situated in the back and the way the seats/table are set up you couldn't see anything unless you were sitting at the tables next to the wall. The outside patio is a decent size. Our waitress was friendly, the crowd is pretty hipster-ish and the place was dark as hell.

ANYWAYS back to the waffle...in my opinion the waffle was soft and a little tasteless. I think the only redeeming thing on the waffle was the ice cream and the oat crumble...I'd rather go to Wanda's Waffles."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place out, especially since they have gluten free waffles - a rare treat for me with my wheat allergy. The portion was generous with a side of fruit and salad (although I paid extra $2 for whipped cream which consisted of a tiny squirt from a can on each waffle - it immediately melted into a puddle). The waffles looked great, but sadly they really tasted awful - almost a bitter, sour taste. No amount of maple syrup helped. And the texture was incredibly dense, gummy and almost rubbery. I gave up after eating two of the mini waffles. 

I bake a lot of gluten free cakes, cookies and muffins, and you can make delicious baked goods with beautiful consistency - you can't taste the difference. So they should be able to make a better gluten free waffle than that.  Based on the other reviews, the regular waffles sound like they're really good, but if you're looking for gluten free breakfast treats here, I really wouldn't recommend it. Chai Latte was pretty good though."}
{"text":"Extremely overhyped. The potatoes waffles were very unpleasant and their potatoes salad is straight from a box or something. Def not worth a second visit."}
{"text":"After seeing some reviews here, I came to this place with high expectations.  When I visited for the first time in March 2013, they didn't disappoint me (knowing that you cannot always rely on reviews here) - those waffles were so delicious!  I had a Smoked Salmon Sandwich, in which the waffle was perfectly cooked.  It was crispy & light and the combination of salmon, cream cheese, capers and dill was perfect.  My friend had a Monte Cristo and this was tasty too. :)

However, when I came back in August 2013, it was not same as my first time.  Waffles were just average and the side salad was not very fresh.  Everything seemed to be \"just okay\" and didn't make me feel that I wanted to come back again.

As an additional note, I like their side offerings where you can choose from fruits, potato salad or baked beans in addition to mixed green.  This is for the restaurant owner, you may wanna clean up the gold fish tank more often.  As an eating place, it is important to have a clean and healthy atmosphere. :)

Maybe I will give them another chance if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Went 10:30AM on a weekday. Good music & not too loud. Premises were half occupied, approx 5-6 tables. Most clientele we saw there were yummy mummies w their babies or business brunch groups. Beautiful decor & light-flooded interior - I'd love my house done up this way.

Appealing menu - everything has either mini or regular sized waffles. Attentive service. Lots of choice of savoury & sweet, & also good variety of courses (appetizer waffles, dessert waffles, main waffles). Easy to substitute items to accommodate dietary restrictions. Alcohol also available. Good coffee - had Americano ($3.50). Ordered the Breakfast \"Waffles After 6\" ($12) which is two mini potato waffles w carmelized bacon & two poached eggs. Mixed greens on the side as well as choice of potato salad, maple beans or fruit side (I picked fruit). Nice presentation of waffles, smelled & tasted fantastic. Poached eggs were just right, there was a touch of sweet to the carmelized bacon, which complemented the savoury potato waffles. The latter are *amazing.* It's like mashed potatoes cooked in a waffle iron so the outside is crispy & inside is fluffy & creamy. Delicious!

The only disappointment: raw fruit & veg left much to be desired as strawberry was rotten & mouldy, orange slice was dried up & black along one of the edges, & a few pieces of the mixed greens were partially rotted. If they could double-check these things before serving a dish, they'd get at least one more star from me. We live in the neighbourhood & are willing to give them another chance since they're fairly new so perhaps they're still going through some growing pains."}
{"text":"The place can be super busy on weekends (the brunch crowd!) They don't do takeout on weekends so you'll have to line up or try during the week. Let me just say that although the service isn't always amazing...the waffle bacon is worth lining up for (and you can get it gluten free!!!)"}
{"text":"Very soft waffles, fresh fruits. Typical North American breakfast and I kind of like the way cups are hanging upside down the water bottle.
Friendly staff, remember they only take cash."}
{"text":"Waited 1.5 hours to be seated while multiple tables waited empty... Staff ran around like crazy and it was really disorganized.   Also turns out they don't accept anything besides cash, but their ATM was empty.  Food may be decent but the service is TERRIBLE."}
{"text":"Delicious food, huge menu with great variety, excellent service and warm, inviting vibe. Highly, highly recommend."}
{"text":"Just had breakfast here this morn. It was so good that it made me want to finally start reviewing on Yelp just to give back! 
The waffles with the bacon are incredible, a must have.
The service was a little slow, but thats what you get for a mom and pop shop, so no worries there."}
{"text":"Have been to the original location and loved it. This location? Walked out without eating. Hostess said she would seat us right away. Second staff came over and said the same. Third staff then came over and said it would be ten minutes to get a table even though at least three empty tables were within arm's length of where we stood. If they cannot even get seating straight, afraid to see what they do with the food. Not going back so soon. Went down the street to Boom instead...got seated right away and that is where we are now, writing this review."}
{"text":"We haven't gotten our food yet, it's been so long I've had time to write a review about how long it's taking. Maybe I'll amend my review after we eat...."}
{"text":"Friends seem to like this place, but I found the food pretty boring and the atmosphere crowded and unwelcoming."}
{"text":"Something different from the typical restaurant.  The staff are always friendly and the food has always been super yummy!  Order desert first to make sure you have room for it!"}
{"text":"Ok so I went back for a second time and now think this place deserves less than 1 star. The service was horrible this time, enough to turn me off from ever going again. Also, this place is NOT vegetarian friendly. I ordered a vegetarian dish, and half way through I found bits of bacon under my food. I was disgusted and the server did not handle it well. She had a \"what do you want me to do about it?\" attitude."}
{"text":"Best egg benedicts  I have ever had. So, so good. The whole atmosphere, service and food where amazing. I'm sure this is going to be my new brunch spot"}
{"text":"They really need to sort out the seating to optimize and avoid customers getting frustrated with the wait. They were seating 2s at tables for 4s today so we left after waiting for about 20 minutes when they told us it would be another 35.  Not sure when they will figure out how to best manage the tables. they could take phone numbers and text people so they don't have to stand in the line. 
Have been there on a weekday and the waffles are good, not great. Latte game could also be up'd - it's not as good as their other locations. 
They will continue to be popular and have lines on weekends until other trendy brunch spots in the area open up... not sure when that will be. 

UPDATE - came back. Potato waffles taste like they came        out of a box of dehydrated flakes. Gluten free waffles tasted like crap and were not properly cooked. Also, milk in tiny capsules makes the coffees and teas taste like they came from a gas station. Downgrading to 1 star"}
{"text":"Well, don't come here if you're looking for great service. The waffles are awesome, but the service is brutal! They messed up all of our orders, and they were so slow. And each persons order came in intervals of 5 minutes. Nothing came together we each ate separately. Probably because they only have two waffle irons which is ridiculous for a waffle restaurant. Also probably why they have huge lineups. Everything about this place is slow. BUT They have GF and vegan waffles which is great because not all places do, and they were very good. Only negative on the actual waffles is the toppings you order with them are just thrown on top they are not in the actual waffle. Great value for the money though. The potato waffles are unique and a must-try."}
{"text":"Got there before the lineup and have a hard time wondering why there is one. Seating was nasty. Counted about five varieties of flies and no wonder with the heat in there and lack of ventilation. Also having the open garbage cans in the eating area - behind my table - was pretty nasty. The food was near flavourless. Breakfast waffles, monte christo, western with potato waffles."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere of this spot.  Came for weekday brunch and was not disappointed! Service was good and the food was excellent.  I had the waffles benny with avocado and a side of bacon, and would order this again. Pretty busy by the time we left so recommend coming early if you don't want to wait."}
{"text":"My partner and I dined here twice.
Our first experience was good over all. The food was delicious and our server was very friendly and attentive.

Our second and possibly our last visit; was a complete and utter disaster!The food; just as we expected was delicious but the service was TERRIBLE!

On our first visit; my partner really enjoyed his Waffle Benny and I really loved the Chicken Bacon Club!! I also ordered a plain Mango smoothie which was served in a HUGE pint glass, was deliciously creamy and totally worth the $5!

A couple sat next to us and was waiting to be approached by a server. They eventually stormed out in a huff. I don't know how long they waited but they were quite upset. Maybe this was an omen for us to steer clear of this place?

Our second visit was yesterday morning around 11am. There were two male cooks; one played three roles; second cook, dish washer and bus boy and there was one female server. Keep in mind they were very busy with all the tables taken and quite a few people waiting at the bar, door or outside to be seated.

I felt really bad for the server because she was very busy and she had to play the role of hostess, waitress, barista and bartender for the entire restaurant. Do you get the picture that they were extremely understaffed?

We were lucky to be seating within minutes of arriving. We literally sat at our table over half and hour before the waitress got a chance to greet us. I'm a waitress as well and so my partner and I were very patient and understanding.

We both wanted to order the Chicken Bacon Club but was told they were out of Chicken, Avocado and chives; so we had to quickly order something else. I ended up getting the Hitch hiker and my partner ordered the Waffle Benny. Based on how delicious, creamy and HUGE the smoothie was on our first visit; I ordered a plain mango smoothie. I mentioned to the server that I had the smoothie before and was really looking forward to it but asked if she could add some sugar. After a little bit of hesitation; she agreed to add some sugar to my smoothie. I was happy!

Our food took another 30-40 minutes to arrive at our table. None-the-less; it was just as delicious as we remembered! I was still waiting for my smoothie.

By this time most of the guests who were waiting were seated and another female employee had arrived and took over the role of barista and bartender.
The server finally brought over my smoothie which had Banana in it. Honest mistake. After about 10mins of trying to get her attention; she finally came over and I reminded her that I had ordered a plain mango smoothie. I was expecting the same thing I had ordered last time; Huge glass, nice and creamy smoothie.Instead; a bright yellow concoction was dropped off at my table in a much smaller glass. NOT what I wanted.

The barista had mixed mango slices and orange juice. I took one sip and it was TERRIBLE!I left it at the edge of the table; hoping the waitress would come over and ask if I enjoyed my smoothie. She came by, cleared our plates and with nothing but the smoothie left on the table; asked if we wanted anything else. We asked for the bill. She brought us the bill and left it right next to the untouched smoothie without enquiring about it.

As a server; I would never do this. I care whether or not guests enjoy their food, beverage, the service and the ambiance. This server (who was no longer busy) couldn't careless that I didn't drink the smoothie.

I can see pass waiting half and hour to have my order taken and I can also see pass waiting another 30-40 minutes for my food to be delivered to my table but I cannot see pass this server completely disregarding my obvious dislike of the improperly made drink. Being a server; my partner and I are very generous tippers but I left that server NOTHING. I wanted to leave her a note explaining exactly why I left no tip but I was just so angry. I hope the management and staff at Starving Artist get the chance to read this. I'm extremely disappointed in how this was handled."}
{"text":"Friendly staff,good service,awesome food packed on saturdays at least when i was there a few times."}
{"text":"The food was good and reasonably priced, but the service was very, very slow."}
{"text":"Save your TIME and MONEY and go somewhere else!
OK, so I got the Eggs Benny and literally my 7 year old neice could make this $9 meal because it safely did not invole a stove top.
The eggs were \"poached\" in the microwave (dinging sound in the background and the telltale plastic poacher \"mold\" shape), the potato waffles (sounds great right?) were cold and the handful of mixed greens were squirted with Kraft Raspberry Vinegarette. Oh, the side of potato salad was straight from a grocery store tub! The service was excruciatingly slow, we waited just about 1 HOUR for our food and no explanation of why it took so long!  The servers calculated for us that our $9 meals were $12.50 including tax and tip. That would be a 25% tip, how generous of us to them for such bad food/service!  Never again Starving Artist, they deserve to STARVE!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Yummy in my belly. 
The area isn't the best, I subway ed from yonge and bloor and was a little hesitant when I stepped outside the station.  But the restaurant is literally two minutes from subway.  

Got a waffle brunchwich. So delicious. And a Caesar.  And got the dessert waffle with coconut and banana crunch.  Everything was delicious. The place looked slightly more old school diner, nothing very fancy. Thoroughly enjoyed the food though!"}
{"text":"Attended today (Sunday) for brunch. We were a table of 3, arrived at 11:30 and waited about 20 minutes of a table. Grateful they sat us without our third person, as she arrived 10 minutes after we got our table. 

Service isn't great - that's for sure. It took forever for our waitress to take our orders. The food definitely made up for it. 

I had the B. Benny which is eggs benny on potato waffle. SOOOOOO good! The potato waffle is basically crispy mashed potatoes. The hollandaise is great. The dish came with a yummy salad and fruit...very filling plate. 

Note, food arrived fast - about 15/20 after orders finally taken. 

One of my guests had the salmon benny on reg waffle, the other had a fruit waffle - everyone happy. 

Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I chose to try Starving Artist because it was written up in an article on places to go for Eggs Benedict.  Being a lover of breakfast places I was keen to try it.  Unfortunately I didn't read yelp reviews before going here.

I met my colleague for a working breakfast at 9 a.m.  When she politely asked if the music could be turned down so we could hear each other speak, the waitress gave a very snarky response.

There was at max 2 other tables with customers during the entire time we were there.  Service was slow and unfriendly, though the waitress did warm up a bit as the meal progressed.  I don't think she really liked working there.

The menu as lots of variety in the way waffles are served.  If you're not in the mood for waffles you're out of luck.  Great to see gluten free options.

I ordered the B. Benny .... 2 potato waffles topped with poached eggs & caramelized bacon & hollandaise sauce for $14.  It arrived at the table... lukewarm not hot.  Flavour ok at best.  Found the waffle/caramelized bacon combination too sweet for my preferences.

Great that Espresso based drinks are offered; unfortunately a plain cup of coffee is not an option.  So if you want more than one cup you pay for it.  

Was caught off guard to discover that they only accept cash.  The manager gave my colleague a loooooong explanation about how much it cost them to provide debit/credit card to customers.  He seemed to be completely oblivious to body language indicating he spent way too long talking about it and that he was displaying a complete lack of consideration as to what might be customer centric approach to running a business.  Nor did he seem to understand that there are costs to running a business.  

The bathroom.... while there is a cute picture on the door.... was in dire need of a really good clean.  Makes me wonder about the cleanliness of the kitchen!

Now that I've had a chance to read previous reviews.... there have been a lot of comments about poor service.... for some time.  Clearly they are not reading the reviews or they don't care.

With a name like Starving Artist, I had expectations of good value and good food.  That was not my experience.  

On the website it is stated that, \"Supporting local artists is a main priority at Starving Artist\".  

From my experience today, the owners don't seem to understand that if they don't think about the customer experience, customers don't come back the artists will no longer have a venue to display their work.  Neither my colleague or I are likely to be repeat customers nor are we likely to talk about it positively within our networks.  

Given their main priority... judging from the quality of the art displayed on the walls today... they seem to be struggling to find artists to display their work."}
{"text":"Waffles galore. If you are looking to have an exceptional breakfast the Starving Artist is where you need to be. Their dishes are creative, delicious and well executed. The location is a little out of the way but this did not seem to effect how busy the restaurant can be. It is a little small, not much seating indoors which will be an issue over the winter but it has lots of arrangements for summer day meals with outdoor seating. Any of the waffles dishes are must-trys specially the benedict option. Service was friendly and the washroom was clean, recommended for breakfast for couples due to the intimate setting."}
{"text":"I really love the Landowne location. But you MUST STAY AWAY FROM THIS LOCATION!! Turn around.

I've tried the stclair station three times and it all turned out the same.  

Weekends, sure there is a line like at all places.  But I watched wait staff take there time cleaning up dirty tables.   I sat at the tables to know it takes long to get water, make my order and then receive it. 

Today I thought I'd give them another chance.  It's a week day it should be slow.  The place was filled with maybe 1/3 of its capacity, at best.  My son as a joke tried to prove my hunches wrong and used my stop watch to time it.  After giving my order it took 31 mins for the food to arrive at my table.  My food would have taken longer if I didn't ask my waitress, where is my food??

My son and I watched other tables who got there later then is, receive their order before us.  We watched the people beside us get there food in 10 mins.  He was mad and I pretty much confirmed that this place doesn't know how to stay on top of stuff.  

Everyone pretty much writes a review says wonderful things about the waffles and such.  But my eggs benny came out almost well done  each time"}
{"text":"Let's start with the good: their food is good, great even.

Now for the bad... really bad service. My partner and I walked in around 12:10pm on the Monday of August long weekend... it took 9 minutes for someone to acknowledge us. I had to track someone down and ask where we should stand to \"wait to be seated\" as it was written on the wall board. The \"line-up\", which was comprised of 3 couples including us, was scattered around the sofas in the entrance way. I took advantage of this time to scan the restaurant... at least 1/3 to 1/2 of the tables were empty. \"Great, I thought, we should be out of here within the hour - it's brunch after all.\"

Wrong. Wrong. Wrong.

Minutes passed, and finally, someone acknowledged us and told us that there was a wait to be seated. So I pointed over to the (many) empty tables that I had observed and asked if they were available. \"Yes, they are.\" This confused me, had she not just said there was a wait? Shrugging it office, we followed our waiter to a tall table with stools. Being short (standing at 5'3\") tall tables and stools don't always agree with my shorter legs and leave me needing a lift or a running start to get my bum on the seat... but I wasn't in the mood for high jump, so I asked if we could sit at a lower table, explaining that I have trouble getting up on highchairs given my height. Waiter grumbled and mumbled something about how she likes the tall tables, and sat us at low table. Water came quick - great! Menus, however, were not available at the moment... not even one to share. Minutes later, two menus were harried our way and we made quick decisions on our order given our original one-hour timeline for brunch. (One would think one hour for brunch is reasonable.) 

We flagged down the waiter, who snapped back that she was going to take the other table's order, and \"are you okay with that!\". She eventually made her way back to our table, took our order. By 12:42pm, we received one part of our order, the waffle grilled cheese. It was missing the bacon. Disappointed, but starving, my hungry man enjoyed the piping hot and delicious craft. By 12:52pm, we had not yet received the rest of our order. Other tables around us who had arrived and submitted their orders AFTER us had received their food by this time. By 12:58pm, edging on the one hour mark for brunch and still 'sans order' we got up to go pay and ask if we could have our order to go. \"No problem, your order is up next.\" So I paid, in cash of course after paying the $1.99 to use their ATM machine. Note that we had to convince the staff that we should not be charged for bacon on the grilled cheese because it wasn't on the sandwich. We stood waiting for the next 10 minutes while they proceeded to complete the rest of our order, the same order that we were told was \"next up\". At 1:11pm, we were discussing whether it would send the right message if we walked out without our order, our waiter turned up with styrofoam containers in hand, plastic forks and knives balancing on top, \"Do you need a bag?\" 

Sorry Starving Artist on St.Clair West, never again. I'll be going back to the tried, tested, and true at Emma's Country Kitchen where the service is warm, friendly, and inviting (they give you a cup of coffee while you wait in line!) AND the eggs benny is done right!"}
{"text":"Came here with my husband and son at 11:30 on a Saturday morning and waited 30 minutes for a table. Staff were good with giving those waiting in line a menu to look at and service was great through our meal. I ordered the Brunchwich waffle and agree with some of the reviewers that the portions could definitely be larger.
What I don't like about this place is the noise level. I had to shout at my husband for him to be able to hear me. And what's with the \"cash only\" policy? For a minute I thought I was in Chinatown. It almost makes me want to not return.
Except the waffles were delicious so I will, but I would come back at a far less busy time so we don't have to wait for a half hour and shout."}
{"text":"Amazing place to grab breakfast or brunch! The waffles here are nice and fluffy and you can smell it as soon as you walk in. I went with my girlfriend and we ordered the B.Benny and Waffle Benny and swapped one waffle each. The combination of the poached egg and the waffles works out amazingly, leaving you wanting to get seconds. 
Next time I'm going to make sure to order waffles on the side of Waffle Benny's."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great food, great coffee but service is not good.

If u r not too hungry and if u have time then I would go there. Otherwise I wouldn't."}
{"text":"Worst service in Toronto. Told me I couldn't do takeout, so I just ordered a coffee to go. Took them half an hour to get me a fucking coffee. Been coming here on a monthly basis for a year and the service is consistently piss poor. Overpriced food based on the kitsch value."}
{"text":"Excellent Breakfast.
The staff are great! I screwed up an order & they replaced it at no cost, wow.
The Gluten Free Waffle had banana & is a little sweet with the savory options, however not overly.
If you're ok with potatoes, you simply must try their Potato waffles, so savory & delicious!
The sides are good for those who need to have fruit & veggies with all meals, a simple greens salad & fruit so fresh, it's perfect. (they also offer a potato salad which may or may not be underwhelming, I didn't try it).
Great patios at front & back, beautiful art & unique atmosphere."}
{"text":"Just went for brunch at Starving Artist and had high hopes for a decadent waffle breakfast (similar in style and standard as the original resto on Lansdowne). 

While service was decent and the space beautiful, there were a couple of key missteps that will make me think twice before returning. First, the waffles were unimpressive. I ordered the 'starving 4 waffles' and they were short of special. they were fluffy, but clearly from a mix and my major complaint was the watered down fake maple syrup. It was plunked down in a large container at every table. Call me crazy but I expect real maple syrup when I am out in Toronto - anything less is just cheap an cutting corners in the wrong places. The waffles were also bland and generally uninspiring. I appreciated the fact they had vegan and gf options but would have enjoyed more creativity in the dish selections overall. To round it all off, the americano I had was overly bitter and actually difficult to drink. Though the waffles weren't amazing, a solid delicious coffee would have improved the overall experience and invited us to stay and chat. Unfortunately it did the opposite.

All in all, the decor is lovely, staff friendly and overall vibe warm, inviting and chic. The waffles were disappointing and I left somewhat irritated. Hoping they get spruced up and real maple syrup is added, then I might be back!"}
{"text":"I love their mashed potato waffles. They're light and delicious, and I crave them every time the season changes. These waffles are the perfect savoury treat to go with eggs, avocado, chicken and/or bacon. I'm sure there are other delicious things on the menu, but no one in the city makes a mashed potato waffle quite like Starving Artist."}
{"text":"I came to Starving Artist two weeks after it launched and ordered Eggs Benny on waffles.  The plate arrived and it was artistically presented and tasted yummy too.  I am so happy to find a place on St. Clair where every plate involves waffles!  I am definitely coming back and I'll be spreading the word.  The only reason why I am not giving 5 stars is because it took a while for our food and drinks to be served.  There was only one waiter working so I am assuming they were understaffed.  I recommend having more than one waiter/waitress on staff during busy hours to improve our overall experience. Keep the waffles coming please!!!"}
{"text":"the Toronto Lover system:
5 stars = Must visit!
4 stars = Really good. I take my friends here.
3 stars = Somewhat worth it... if you have nowhere better to go.
2 stars = Below average. Attend only when necessary.
1 star = Do not visit!



There are a lot of good things about Starving Artist. When this place first took over from Soul Food, the staff was eager to please, the menu was fresh and cool, and the \"waffle-buzz\" was on. The food is still great, the ambience in the back, inside, and on the front patio are all really laid back and ideal for any time of day.
Unfortunately, I keep hearing reports about poor service. This is a shame, because the food is well done, and prepared in the open right near the bar, which is always nice to see. My favourite is the chicken sandwich with bacon, but everybody goes for the waffles. You can't miss, really.
If they do something about the service, this place could climb to the top.

4 stars"}
{"text":"Food is fantastic though on the pricier side for brunch. Good selection and Benny and Fully Loaded have both been very tasty. Regular coffee is strong and nutty but very small. This location has been my least favourite however for a couple of reasons...yelp here says it's good for kids, no way, the music is LOUD...thumpingly, little eardrum shattering loud. It's cash only, weird because that's not the case across the other branches. And took a long time for anyone to see us after we were first seated.
Great food but will stick to the St Clair branch for now."}
{"text":"We went to Starving Artist in Toronto, whose main claim to fame is that everything is served with, on or between waffles. The atmosphere attracts in droves the 20-somethings with cardigans, beards and tattoos, but the atmosphere in general is not overly pretentious. The lines however are long enough, even at 10AM on a Sunday. We assumed we'd beat the crowd by being before 11AM, but it's still a very busy place.

I had a delicious BBQ chicken sandwich between waffles. The overall business premise is at once hilarious and also genius. In such a carb-addicted world, everyone likes bread. Why not upgrade that to waffles? Crispy waffles taste good with just about anything, and this venue serves to prove just that.

Portions are a good size for the price and we didn't feel like we were being gouged for a novel experience. That said, this isn't meant to be fancy dining by any stretch of the imagination, this venue is completely barefaced in its approach to delivering good food and a unique experience."}
{"text":"Food was ok.  We walked into the west door and waited for a few minutes and no one came to us. Apparently we were suppose to walk in thru the eastern door. 

The waitress was quick to get our order but it took almost 45 for our order to come out. We were told the kitchen was backed up. It would have been helpful if we had been told in advance.  The place was not so busy that this was warranted. 

They only take cash but have an ATM on site. The ATM displays your financial information after you get your money.  There's a delay.  The guy in front of me walked away and all of his financial information was up for me to see until I pressed ok on the ATM. Horrible. 

Waitress checked up on us initially but then didn't show up again. Had to ask for the bill after a bit of a wait. 

Overall the food was decent but not good enough to make up for the other shortcomings."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to eating here as it came highly recommended by colleagues and friends. As soon as we walked in while waiting to be seated two of the hostesses brushed us of like we were non-existent. We stood there patiently waiting to get seated. 
We asked to be seated up front by the patio and we were told \"NO those are for 4 people !\" In retrospect we should have walked away at this point (lesson learned). So we got seated at the back (felt like the apartheid at this point) next to an ugly out of place fish tank. 

On the brighter side food was decent i got the western between waffles with fruits (watermellon grapfruit and some berries and one yes one rasberry). The wife got the veggie between waffles with potato salad (90% sure that it was costco). 

On the way out we waited at the cashier for another 5 mins as there was no one there. And thats where we noticed thats there were two people sitting at the \"table for 4\" and that was the absolute last straw never coming back here and absolutely not refering anyone to the starving artist, they can starve for all i care !"}
{"text":"I had previously been to Starving Artist and it was fine. So Sunday morning me and a friend of mine decided to go there for breakfast. 

We had to wait about 20mins to get seated. Once we got seated our table was in a corner behind a dirty old fish tank. So unappetizing. The back of the restaurant is crowded and loud. When the server came around we ordered two eggs Benedict (which is what we ordered last time), and two smoothies. 

Our smoothies came quickly... But they were slightly warm. Gross. 

We waited 30 mins and still hasn't gotten our food yet. So I asked the server how much longer it would be. She said, \"For you? It's going to be a while. About 30 mins\". 

That's ridiculous!!! We had been there for 50mins already, yet we still had to wait another half hour?! The server said we could pay for our warm smoothies. So we did and left. 

Horrible experience. 

Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Amazing waffles. I had the gluten-free vegan ones - one time with syrup and all that fun stuff, the other time as part of some savoury sandwich that wasn't really worth the money, but was delicious all the same. We had a confusing go of it when my mom wanted berries instead of the mixed fruit salad. The waitress couldn't quite get her head around the idea of substitution. Like, at all. Other than that, the service was friendly.

The coffee was absolutely terrible. I warned my parents, but they didn't listen. Then when it came they got mad at me for not warning them more seriously as to just how unbelievably awful it truly was. Just can't win, can you?

In the summer time there is quite a serious wasp infestation issue that they really should deal with. Like as in you get swarmed by wasps whether you're on the patio or even inside the restaurant.

To sum up...great waffles, terrible coffee, frightful wasp situation."}
{"text":"I literally signed up for a Yelp account just to review this place because my experience was so bad. There was one server for a whole restaurant, with two others behind the counter that didn't seem to be doing very much at all. Service was so slow because of this. The server brought us our coffees fairly quickly but only one water glass for 5 people, saying she would be back with the rest and then completely forgot. It took 45 minutes to get our meals, which is outrageous, and even then the server had to bring them out one at a time instead of the whole table at once so one person's meal was getting cold while waiting for the rest. I wish I could say the food was good after such a long wait, but ultimately my poached eggs (made in a mould by the way, not freehand) were completely overcooked and the potato salad was overwhelmed with mayonnaise. I will not be coming back. Frankly I don't know how this place stays in business with such terrible service. Last time I disregard Yelp reviews, I should have known better."}
{"text":"I like the vegan waffle option and the price is pretty fair. My major qualm is the coffee, its alarmingly bad. They don't have drip so americanos instead. Very watery, acidic and bitter. If you like good coffee, youre out of luck."}
{"text":"I got indigestion - from the bad food and the racist Betty Boop episode they were playing."}
{"text":"Had the mixed veggie waffle with baked beans, and for $10 (for a big waffle) it was a pretty great deal. 

They also have gluten free waffles, which was handy for my celiac wife, although she wasn't confident in the sauces so she stuck to basic waffles and syrup. 

Overall a pretty great meal."}
{"text":"Starving artist is where you go for a fun twist on traditional brunch items.  For example their bacon waffles, and eggs benni on waffles with candied bacon. These changes are well thought out and executed well!  All dishes come with fruit and salad.  I like their potato salad.  Their baked beans are also tasty.  The only thing keeping me from giving it a fifth star is that they sometimes over poach the eggs."}
{"text":"The Starving Artist is a cute little brunch spot just north of Bloor and Lansdowne.  We went here today with some friends from out of town and they were pleasantly surprised! Although let's be real - I have a pretty good track record for brunch recommendations. 

The Starving Artist was spot on!  The best part about this place is all the customized options.  It's like they cater to everyone - options to order your waffles as plain, potato, vegan, or gluten-free.  You can choose from a variety of toppings - fruit, chocolate, different spreads, etc.  And even the possibility of adding it to the actual waffle batter! This is not your typical eggo..  My friend ordered vegan waffles with coconut actually IN the batter.   Another amazing thing is the easy substitutions - replace your bacon with avocado at no cost, heads up to all those veggie-tarians out there.   All meals also come with side salad and choice of fruit or beans. 

I ordered the Breakfast Benny which consisted of Eggs Benny on a (you guessed it) potato waffle.  Hollandaise sauce was creamy, waffles were on their game, eggs were cooked to perfection.  The results were a very happy tummy. 

The service is quick and friendly. BTW this place is bumpin',  get here early as there's usually a line-up!"}
{"text":"My wife and I saw this place the other day while dining at DeSotos and were really excited to see a pretty stylish new restaurant open in our area.  After our daughters both passed out in our stroller today we thought we'd grab a coffee.

We arrived and were excited to see that the place has a ton of space and a modern coolish décor.  That's about where our excitement ended.  We walked in and looked straight at a staff member who ignored us and continued chatting with her colleague.  I asked something like \"Are we good to sit anywhere?\" and got a curt \"no, I'll find you a spot\" from the colleague.  After some oddly difficult conversation as to how many of us there were (2 and a stroller since our kids were asleep, duh!) we followed her to our table.  She had removed a chair and my wife said something like \"thanks, but don't worry about a highchair, they're asleep\" to which our waitress actually said \"oh, I wasn't going to get one.\" Uh... Really?!  I mean, she said it in one if those matter-of-fact kind of ways (not catty) that only someone who really has no clue about customer service could muster.  Did you forget that we're your patrons?

Anyway, the americanos were both (decaf and reg) bitter and watery, the menu looked odd-ish but potentially yummy, and when it came time to pay our waitress had disappeared and I had to pay at the cash.  Another ridiculous conversation ensued regarding my getting 2 loonies instead of a toony so I could tip (what was I thinking?!) and the only nice part was a hearty thanks from the loony/toony waitress when we left.

There is definitely some potential there if they (sorry) get rid of the waitress that we had and iron out a whole lot of the we-just-opened problems that they have (like the cash only thing which is apparently temporary).  I will refresh this review when we go again."}
{"text":"The wait here can be really long - arrive before 11 to get a table right away. There's no room inside for the waiting crowd so if you don't there early enough be prepared to wait outside. In the summer they have 2 patios which are both great.

The coffee is tasty and most of the food is really good too but the potato waffles were disappointing. They weren't crispy, so while the flavour was good I was disappointed by my poached egg on top of waffle-shaped mashed potatoes. However, the smoked salmon sandwich is great, and anything with hollandaise is fantastic. Their bacon is crispy and perfect, everything comes with fresh fruit and salad, and the tea selection is wonderful. Fairly reasonably priced and the service is efficient if not all that friendly. My vegan/gluten free friends really like this place, and it's one of my favourite brunch spots too."}
{"text":"Ambiance was nice. For groups, they won't seat you unless all members are present. 

Menu: exciting. Food: Mediocre. We rotate picking brunch spots and our one gf loves this place. Being a total foodie, I wasn't impressed. I ordered the B. Benny and asked for the bacon to be swapped for avocado. Food arrived with bacon. We were a group of 5 - no ones food arrived at the same time. They corrected my order but the poached eggs were totally overcooked. Hollandaise sauce lacked flavour. My other gf got poached eggs too - they were definitely undercooked...the whites were runny. 

They don't have brewed coffee but do have a good espresso machine. Both my Americano and latte were delish. 

Not sure if I'll go back here."}
{"text":"Dropped in because there was only ONE party of 3 ahead of me...somehow ended up waiting 1/2 hr to be seated while several tables were empty (counted 6!)...of course as the line grew and everyone was wondering what the heck was going on. The girl who was maybe supposed to be seating people did not approach us once...finally another server jumped in after realizing no one was helping us. 

Finally seated...wondered when the server would come by. That was fun. Order placed...and somehow the easiest order was messed up. Asked for a spoon to eat my yoghurt (makes sense right?)...never came so it was awesome eating with it with a fork. -_-

The place is so unorganised and poorly run that I won't even bother giving it another try. Looking at some of these reviews...doesn't seem like the owners care much for improvements. There are way better options in the city...."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast/brunch! But also a busy one so be prepared. The first time I came here it took 45 minutes to get our food but we were warned several times before they seated us. The second time, we had ordered and recieved our food within 15 min. Great food, coffee and space. Love the emphasis on art."}
{"text":"This place is okay.  Mostly because there is a dirth of breakfast places in our neighbourhood, so it's what's for breakfast.

I have had good service and bad service.  Good food and bad food.  It depends.  

My only true objection is how long it takes to get a table.  And that's just because they are busy."}
{"text":"Terrible service, the staff were inattentive and clearly not interested in helping. They didn't have the main ingredient on the meal I ordered but rather than own up they tried to pretend it didn't come with that ingredient. After I called them out on it they told me the kitchen was out and didn't offer any apology, discount or substitution. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"Was seated immediately which was nice. But once we sat down it took at least 20 minutes, probably more than that, for our server to take our orders. Once we placed our orders it took probably 40 minutes for our food to arrive. And unfortunately I wasn't really happy with it.. my waffles just didn't seemed cooked :( I love brunch and I understand these places get really busy, especially on a Sunday, but I don't think that's a valid excuse for what I experienced. Then once we finished our food (and by this point we were the only people in the restaurant) we waited another 15 minutes until I walked up to one of the servers and asked them to clear our plates and get the bill. I was honestly to excited to come here. Will probably give them another chance, because it was a really cool vibe, everyone else's food looked great and I don't want to judge somewhere just based on a one time experience.. but I know if I had brought my dad here he would refuse to go back, and would have made a huge deal about everything :p"}
{"text":"The atmosphere in this medium-sized diner is very cool. They play a variety of cool music from indie-rock to old swing/jazz. In the summer, the front window is wide open, allowing for a pleasant breeze. Be warned: they have a bee feeder! Yes, there are a few bees flying around in the dining area, but they are not much of a nuisance.

Our server was very nice and helped us with the menu. The items on the menu are not necessarily anything you've had before. I learned that a Caesar is like a bloody Mary prepared with Clamato instead of simple tomato juice (and that they are delicious; we ordered the classic and the 'kick in the teeth' varieties). I also learned that they do not brew drip coffee, but only make espresso. However, they will make an Americano for you non-espresso fans.

We also ordered the 'Breakfast Benny,' which was delightful, and the 'Hitchiker,' including the Waffle Bacon upgrade. The Breakfast Benny I would rate 5/5, and the Hitchiker 3.5-4/5. However, the Waffle Bacon belongs in its own category. It is a simply divine invention, described by our server as \"bacon in a waffle hug.\" Waffle Bacon gets 6.5/5. Order some. You will not be disappointed. Also, their regular bacon that comes as a side (which is not hugged by waffles) is more than just a strip of bacon, it is caramelized. It's similar to maple bacon: sticky, sweet, and all the more delectable for it.

We were unable to finish our entire meal, but only ended up taking home some of the waffle bacon. I would come back for sure on a lazy morning or afternoon. The food is a bit pricey for what it is, but is all manner of tasty nonetheless. The service was cheerful, and despite there being a new guy in the kitchen, our food arrived in perfectly reasonable time. Bonus: this little gem is located only a block or two north of the Landsowne subway stop."}
{"text":"It's great joint! You get pretty much exactly what you expect. The food comes at a reasonable time, the service is underwhelming, and the food isn't spectacular. But overall it's not bad, it's basically exactly what I expected. Had a waffle sandwich with bacon, ham, egg, and cheese. Poured syrup all over that bad boy, and ate like a boss. We went after 1 pm which is well after their busy hours so I can only imagine the service is even slower then. Still, we had a good time and ate some decent food. Good to see a decent brunch place catering to the younger crowd opening up on Mt. Pleasant."}
{"text":"I'm not even a waffle fan and this place induced the craving of the waffle in me.

Love the decor, love that it's close by to home and really appreciate that they chose this part of town to operate in (I could see them easily killing it in the Annex or Queen West).

Courteous outgoing staff PLUS, we got to sit at a table next to an aquarium and watch them swim while going nuts on the waffles."}
{"text":"Cute waffle joint with a total hipster vibe. I had a normal waffle with some fruit which definitely satisfied my craving for a tasty waffle! Also they have REAL maple syrup which is a nice change from the usual fake sugary syrup. I'm looking forward to going back and trying their more creative and savoury waffles though. Everything that I saw come out of the kitchen looked so good!

A few downsides though:
- You can tell they are severely understaffed for servers so be prepared to wait a little bit
- They are cash only 
- No coffee refills, as you can only order an americano. My husband thought it was too strong and bitter, but it suited my tastes for strong coffee.

But I will surely return sometime to try some other menu items. It's a neat little breakfast spot that will give you something different than going for the usual bacon and eggs."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch with some friends and my hubby.  There was a line up outside the door and they wouldn't seat us until our whole party had arrived.  We waited maybe 20 - 25 minutes in total.  Thankfully it wasn't a cold day so we didn't mind too much. 

We were seated in the back corner which didn't have any sunlight.  Kind of sad especially since it was such a nice sunny day.  Oh well.  

My husband and my friend both ordered coffees.  My husband said it was like an americano and no free refills.  

My friend and I both ordered the Breakfast Benny.  My other friend ordered the Breakfast Sammy and my husband ordered the Hitchhiker.  We also ordered a smoked salmon sandwich to share. 

1) Breakfast Benny - I really enjoyed mine.  I liked the savouriness of the potato waffle but it breaks down quite easily.  The egg is cooked medium which isn't how I like my eggs to be poached (I prefer soft) but it seemed like all our eggs were cooked that way which suggests to me that perhaps that's just their style.  My friend who also ordered the breakfast benny had 1 egg that was near hard boiled.  He told the wait staff about it and they brought him 2 extra poached eggs (again, medium) with hollandaise sauce.  

2) Breakfast Sammy - My friend ordered this and felt that the regular waffle got quite soggy under the eggs.  She also found 2 egg shells in her dish.  When the server came by to see how we were doing, she told her about the egg shells.  The server then promptly went to tell the cooks and came back and apologized, explained that there were new cooks that were being trained that day and told her that her dish was 50% off.

3) Hitchhiker - I tried a bit of this and really did not like the eggs.  I felt that they were overcooked and dry (I prefer my scramble to be a bit on the runny side).  

4) Smoked Salmon Sandwich - This had waaay too much cream cheese on it.  To the point where it overpowered everything you tasted, even the salmon.  The dill in the waffle was a nice touch though.  

All breakfasts came with either potato salad, fruit salad or beans.  My husband tried the beans which were actually very sweet as I think a lot of maple syrup was poured into it.  We all really enjoyed the fruit salad - it had a good combination of fruit (not just melons and pineapple). 

Overall, I liked my Breakfast Benny but I don't think anyone else really loved their dishes (hence my 3 star rating).  The prices are reasonable.  I'd be willing to try it again and hopefully all the cooks will be trained well that day."}
{"text":"Amazing potato waffles, particularly the Breakfast Benny, this place gets busy so get there early it's worth it!"}
{"text":"We went here despite some negative reviews and I'm so glad we did! The main dishes were amazing! I had b. Benny and it was fantastic. The potato waffles were soooo good. The service was good.
The only reason I removed a star was because my side of fruit was pretty much dried out like it had been sitting out uncovered for awhile - not a big deal since I filled up on my waffles anyway, but worth mentioning. 
 And the bees, so many bees, like mentioned by other reviewers."}
{"text":"Super slow service. Arrived at 11, got a table at 12, ordered and received food at 12:40. Food was excellent but be warned to wait long if you are there with a group of 4+. Lots of bees flying around."}
{"text":"Best: Hollandaise sauce, poached eggs
Worst: Waiting in line while seeing everyone else eating

Guilty Pleasure: An extra side of hollandaise sauce. 

Second time to Starving Artist and the food never disappoints.  Summer time brings more space on the patio which helps with the long lines.  This place and Lady Marmalade have in my humble opinion the best eggs benny in the city.  Just make sure you have your hipster glasses on."}
{"text":"Pros:  Nice Atmosphere  |  Unique Menu  |  Decent Mains
Cons:  Very Loud  |  Dried Out Fruit  |  Horrendous Service  |  Cash Only  |  Wait Times

Bottom Line: Go if you find poor service to be entertaining or you view dining out as an extreme sport.

My partner lives in the area and for years we have been waiting for something to open in the empty space now occupied by Starving Artist.  It had also been years since I've had waffles of any kind and was delighted to learn that Starving Artist is entirely Waffle obsessed.  

Would I go back?  Not likely.
Did I enjoy my waffles?  Yes
Does this place deserve to survive?  Not with the current staff / service
Where to go instead: Prop does an amazing brunch (though no waffles as far as I can remember)

We had decided the night before that we would hit this place up for brunch the next morning.  I decided to read up to see when exactly it opened and what people were saying.  The reviews on Yelp were a bit ominous so I went in without many expectations.  

We walked in and were surprised at how busy the place was given how recently it opened.  It was packed with twenty-somethings, a couple of families and some older couples.  The music (while fun and eclectic in selection) was too loud to hear what your company has to say.  This is more of an issue because you will spend much of your time waiting...and waiting.  It took us longer than it should have to be seated.  While I wouldn't go so far as to say the staff is indifferent (the woman at the register kept acknowledging our presence to say someone will be with us shortly) I will say the priorities are skewed and they are heavily understaffed at best.  Instead of the hostess / server seating us right away she continued to serve and clear tables until our annoyance was more...palpable.  

The moment we are seated we are told it will be 40 minutes.  In my confusion I blurted out, \"FOR FOOD!!??!\"  This is unacceptable to me but they're new, it was the weekend and I thought, what the hell, let's give this a shot.  The table had water on it and after waiting some time I decided to use my own napkin to wipe it up.  Five minutes later someone came to wipe it (pointless at this time) while taking our orders.  I asked for another napkin for the first of what would be many times.  Instead of receiving a napkin someone else came by to wipe the table a second time for reasons unknown.  

I'll stop here and say there seems to be a real lack of understanding on the part of the staff of how to serve tables.  It's as though there is a communication barrier despite the fact we all speak English.  

Our food came quite a bit quicker than the 40 minutes they quoted us at the start.  The younger couple next to us with their laptop had been there sometime before and received their food a fair amount of time after ours.  It was not clear whether ours was just easier to make, they sped it up for us, or the other couple was just hanging out and decided later to order something.  

I ordered the Sammy Benny and the strawberry/banana smoothie while my partner had soda, a caffé americano and the Monte Cristo.  My partner enjoyed his meal and mentioned the coffee was good (contradicting some earlier reviews on here disparaging the coffee).  I really enjoyed the Sammy Benny and the salmon I found quite fine, not fishy as mentioned in other reviews.  It was a bit messy at times but quite good.  The fruit (as mentioned on other reviews) was indeed dry for me as well and not as flavorful as it should have been.  

At the end my partner graciously shared his single, small, napkin between the two of us.  My multiple attempts to get a whole napkin for myself was a spectacular failure.  
The food for the price was reasonable.  My inability to get a napkin after asking for one 3 times is not reasonable in any way."}
{"text":"I'm going to write my review in point-form because Starving Artist's St. Clair location doesn't deserve the time or effort a full review takes to write.

Here is a summary of my latest experience:

- arrived with a group (which included three young kids) at 12:30pm on New Years Eve day. We were told it would take 45 minutes for food to arrive

- seated 15 minutes later

- 30 minutes later we placed our order

- 10 minutes later we received our coffee

- after 1.5 hours, we inquired with our server how long it would take for our food. We were told \"like, about forever.\" Seriously

- food was finally brought to our table -- oops, completely wrong orders. Sent back to the kitchen

- complimentary chocolate milks were brought to the table to thank us for our patience 

- after nearly 2 hours, we complained to the \"owner\" that we still hadn't received our food. He suggested, with attitude, that we get behind the counter to help (no, seriously!!!) and blamed everything on the servers (again, seriously!!!)

- colourful words were exchanged

- the manager told us to leave -- in front of a full restaurant 

- we left, baffled as to what just happened

Holy smokes. The absolute worst customer service in the game."}
{"text":"Went in on a Sunday & it was packed! About an hour wait but great atmosphere. Just about everything is served on or with waffles (savoury, sweet, you name it). I'd visit again but maybe earlier as 12 noon seems to be their peak time. The Brunchwich is what I went for & it was yummy!"}
{"text":"Went around 10:30am on a Saturday and there was no line for brunch and a few tables left on the patio.
The benny with potato waffles is pretty delicious. The portion size is generous for the price. No free refills on coffee which is a bit sad!
The location is not ideal nor is the parking situation as lansdowne is so busy and the side streets are mostly permit parking.
I would go back if I happened to be in the area but it's a bit out of the way!"}
{"text":"A regular at Starving Artist Lansdowne location... NEVER  HAD A PROBLEM. 

Today, I left this location hungry and beyond upset. Not only was the food not up to par. The salad had a grimy taste and the spicy chicken I ordered had a huge bone in it which you'll see in the picture below.. . disregard that it's a choking hazard but we received no apology for anything today.

My friend's Americano came on a cup with a large lip stick stain. Yes I understand that not everything is thoroughly washed.   But the number of people that touched i (knowing the stain and ignored it).... Before it got to our table .   and the fact that our server disregarded it- full on knowing - disgusts me.

When I asked for a new one for my friend , she simply said \"ok, now what can I get you?\" No apology nothing. She had attitude and did not do any sort of quality check. It was NOT that busy when we went, and I saw very many unsatisfied customers around the same time as me that were all served by the same waitress. 

Management needs to step up their game in training. I will never return to this location."}
{"text":"Went again yesterday, awesome service, like incredible. The girl was friendly, accommodating, helpful but not in your face. The food continues to be amazing, and I tried the Caesar this time... Definitely A+"}
{"text":"Perfectly poached eggs, potato waffles were amazing. Great prices. Good service. And according to my sister the \"best latte she's ever had.\"

Home run."}
{"text":"First time to have brunch here and ordered a waffle sandwich of chicken and avocado(substitute the bacon), fresh fruits and green. My bf got the eggs Benedict and he absolutely loved it. My bf is one of those people who eats to survive and thinks most food are \"meh\". But this time around he said his order was really good and he enjoyed it. So yes this surely is a complement! We would surely come back here for brunch on weekends. :)"}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday morning around 10am and got seated right away.
Had the normal eggs bennie on waffles and my boyfriend had the eggs bennie on the potato waffles.
Both were delish!
Only disapointment was they were out of potato salad we wanted to try. 
Came with alot of fruit and a side salad. We were stuffed after!

Great concept of using waffles!"}
{"text":"Great location and love the food here! had the big benny and absolutely loved it! the potatoe waffles just melt in your mouth!  service is really great and the americano's are just perfect.  best waffles in toronto!"}
{"text":"As a brunch enthusiast, I had high hopes for this place, but I was disappointed. There were wasps everywhere. We relocated to the back of the restaurant where it was a tight squeeze--directly in the path of servers and customers trying to pass through. Heads-up: there is no A/C and it was quite stuffy.

They ran out of several key toppings: avocados, Nutella, ice cream, and something else (I cannot recall at the moment). The baked beans come out of a Heinz can. They use Kraft singles instead of real cheese. I ordered the waffles Benny and though it was fairly decent, the service was lacking and it marred the experience. When my friend voiced some concerns, the server seemed defensive and patronizing. 

Great concept, poor execution. I cannot speak to the other locations, but needless to say, we will not be returning to this one."}
{"text":"my friends and i accidently stumbled upon this place while in the neighborhood to visit another restaurant, which we were disappointed to find temporarily closed.  they were only two servers in the entire place, but they were both extremely friendly and attentive.  despite the short staff, we did not wait unduly for our food.  and it was simple but delicious.  i had the breakfast benny and one friend had the monte cristo, although i can't remember what the third person in our party had.  however, all of us were very happy and could not have been more satisfied all the way around with our adventure into the world of wafflemania.  it was quite a treat - and the decor is pleasantly cool as well.  in short, we were very happy campers, and for this i give the place five stars."}
{"text":"Located just north of Lansdowne subway station opposite to an empty lot (which I imagine would be occupied by a tower soon) I would never have guessed that a cafe of this kind could exist. I was happy to discover this a good breakfast place in my area.

I was meeting a friend and I arrived an hour earlier than my appointment to finish some work on my laptop (free wifi) while enjoying a dark Americano (delicious, btw). It was during one of those spells of warm late fall weather and the place was taken over by wasps (gasp!) attracted to bottles of sugar syrup maybe?

This place is for poached eggs and waffles people. I not big on either so I had a limited menu choice. I ordered the Hitchhiker (naturally attracted to that word since I do hitchhike a lot http://finaltransit.com/) which comes with two waffles, eggs and caramelized bacon which I asked to be made extra crispy. You get to choose between baked beans (which I did), potatoes and something else. The waffles were very delicious and surprisingly went well with this combination. I even got a dessert waffle called crazy strawberry and it was delicious.

Service in weekend brunch restaurants is generally slow and frustrating so I wasn't expecting much and I was glad to have lowered my expectations. I suggest you do too."}
{"text":"awful service from a waitress with a nose ring at 2 o'clock today. I was truly disgusted. I never had such a rude food service experience. tried her best to get rid of us before even getting seated. after telling us it would be a 45 min wait she shut the door in my face. seated people ahead of us who waited in line behind us. spilt our drinks on our table and just left the mess there. left our food on the counter for 10 mins before serving it to us. truly awful experience. plus $20 (no tip) for smootie, 2eggs, 2bacon, 2waffles and a few beans. but the food was good. it was prob excellent if it wasn't sitting for 10mins."}
{"text":"First attempt at the this place was on a cold winter morning. Walked a long way to get there and noticed a big lineup. Thought to myself hmm this place is popular. Was quickly confused when half of the restaurant had empty seating, and the staff walked around like tired zombies. Turns out the they couldn't service a full restaurant properly. Management lacks communication and customer service."}
{"text":"Food is best described with one word \"garbage\" this place is more about being a cool hipster place to hang, than it is about good food. Got the eggs Benny with salmon, it tasted awful. Service is half decent at best."}
{"text":"Coffee was surprisingly meh. Service was wildly odd but the waffle was incredible!
We were seated, so far so good. Order taken - server may have just started her first shift ever in a restaurant. Waited 15 minutes got a dirty side plate. That got taken away. Got some water. Nice. Got a waffle. No coffee.
We watched one of the coffees got to a different table, then back to the front counter, then to our table. I asked after my coffee and it arrived cold and lonely after all the other eating and drinking had already been finished. 

Hard to hear the music was so loud. Not a great restaurant for chatting in. Cash only and hectoring signs about having all your party present before being seated were not really appreciated either. 

Couldn't wait for the bill so I paid at the counter. Couldn't wait to leave actually.
Waffle was unbeliveably fantastic but the rest of the experience made it tricky to enjoy.
Staff need to be trained. Plates need to be clean and coffee needs to be good. May not try it again."}
{"text":"The first and only time I came here...I ordered their chicken and waffles and it was not worth the hype. The chicken was as expected, but the waffle was dry and the two just didn't go together. I didn't understand why everyone was raving about this dish, and so I was disappointed. I also had to wait a while in line, which I don't mind at all if the food is worth it. This was not."}
{"text":"The food is a 4- the service bumps it down to a 3.
The waffles are very nice and the servings are big. The fact that they're made with potatoes is a cool touch. Overall worth going but not in my top brunches in T. (still v. good though!)

The problem is that the servers can be very brusque. We were waiting in doors because it was a cold day and there were seats for two available so we weren't taking up any seating but one server kept coming up and making comments even though no one was being harmed by us being there and we'd ordered drinks while we waited for the rest of our staff.

When we sat down we got a table of 4 for 3 people and 2 min after we sat another friend joined. They made a huge fuss how they dont seat until the whole party is there, which makes sense, however there would be absolutely NO difference to the table we'd get between 3 people and 4 people.

It just felt like they were very persnickety which put a damper on the beginning of the meal."}
{"text":"The Food was good and our waitress was great! It is very quiet and peaceful. It is great for groups and my friends and I would come again very soon. Keep it up"}
{"text":"I went for brunch here today with a friend and I was really disappointed in the food considering all that I've heard about this place. I ordered the mini waffles, scrambled egg and cheese, hollandaise sauce and an americano. I was surprised when the server said they didn't serve coffee as it's a brunch joint. Seems kinda sacrilegious for a breakfast place to not have coffee. The americano wasn't the greatest and the cup was really small.

The food arrived maybe 15 minutes after we ordered and the presentation and portion sizes were good. However, the waffles were meh. They tasted like they had too much baking powder in them. After a healthy dollop of maple syrup, they were edible. The scrambled egg and cheese had no salt and tasted really bland.

Unlike the food, the service was definitely 5 stars. My server was awesome, very attentive and friendly. Just wish the food could have matched the service."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday afternoon for brunch. Got there with my party of 4 at 1:15ish and was seated at 2:30. 

There were only 4 tables that fits 4 and the rest were 2-seaters. So be prepared. 

While waiting, the smell of their cherry chocolate latte caught my attention so I had to order it. It was DELICIOUS. 

2 of my brunch mates got their peanut butter chocolate banana smoothie and have raving reviews.

We started with an order of bacon waffles with maple syrup. Yummy! 

I opted for the breakfast Benny w/ fruit. (You can choose fruit, potato salad, or baked beans with all entrees)

Breakfast Benny was 2 poached eggs, caramelized bacon on potato waffles with hollandaise. 

I personally find the potato pancakes a little too rich and heavy for breakfast/brunch. 
 
But worth a return trip for the drinks and maybe I'll opt for something lighter as a main. 

But for sure next time will be a table for 2 and much earlier."}
{"text":"Everything waffles! Amazing! Fair warning though, you will likely have to wait a good while, especially on weekends. That being said, atmosphere was nice, service was really friendly and food was so good! Had a Starving 4 Waffles, which is an order of 4 waffles with choice of toppings that comes with greens and fruit salad. Fruit and veg were fresh, waffles were crispy on the outside and deliciously soft on the inside. The two Americanos we ordered were also great. My brunch date ordered the waffle benny and said it was delicious too, and our completely clear plates at the end of the meal were pretty good indicators! Their dessert waffles also sounded amazing, guess I'll have to come back for those...

My only complaints are that one, the syrup at the table wasn't real maple syrup (!!!) - this for me is important, and my delicious waffles could have been taken to the next level with the real stuff. I'd even pay more to have it! Second, they only take cash which we didn't realize. There's an ATM in the restaurant but that resulted in getting dinged $2 for a transaction which was kind of a drag. But otherwise everything was great. Glad to have this place in the neighbourhood, would definitely return!"}
{"text":"I have never felt the need to write a negative review but this place certainly earned it. It took two waitresses and ten minutes to clean the table for us. It was neither busy or even messy. We got seated right by the kitchen which is completely open to the entire restaurant. Not only did I get to watch a chef repeatedly stick his hands all the way inside the trash and not wash his hands prowe ply afterwards (he did a quick rinse), cans but the dude doing the dishes was poorly rinsing the dishes. Still trying to give the place a fair chance I ignore these things. Food comes and there is a beautiful piece long black hair on the plate under/in the food and a lovely blonde hair stuck on my knife. Best part is the waitresses was standing right by me when I pulled the hair out of my food and she literally said nothing and walked away. All around awful experience and it sucks because the food was good."}
{"text":"Went here for a birthday brunch this afternoon. We were seated right away, probably because we missed the peak brunch hours. The waitress was off in lala land even when taking orders. Our drinks took about 20 min to come. I ordered the fully loaded waffles - potato waffles, sour cream, cheese bacon and chives. It was amazing!! It was like eating a baked potato. It comes with your choice of potato salad, fruit or baked beans. I choice the fruit it was a good selection not just a few dinky grapes and some berries. My only complaint was the mixed green salad, the dressing tasted like dirt. 
My mom and dad had the tex me sandwich both said they enjoyed it, and it had a nice little tingle on the tongue in terms of heat. My dad got the baked beans and he said they were actually pretty good. 
My boyfriend ventured for the Sammy Benny which at his first bite was ohhhing and ahhhing. 
The service however, as I mentioned was off in nowheresville, the server was so slow, we waited about 30 min for our bill and eventually had to ask another server which was clearing tables for our cheque. Why do you ask? Because our server was sitting down eating her lunch with a co worker chatting.  Overall the food is pretty epic but the service needs work. Also a little makeover would help as the place is a dive but that is no reason not to go. 4 stars for the food, 2 for the service, 3 overall."}
{"text":"Starving artist? More like starving customers! 

I've been here a couple of times before, usually for a late lunch on the weekend. Last visit was on a Sunday at about 2:30. The restaurant was busy so a waitress said we could wait at the bar for a table to become available. As we were waiting, another couple was seated as soon as they arrived. Not cool. I mention it to the waitress and we are seated a couple of minutes later but it's all down hill from here. 

My latte took 25 minutes to arrive. Food was even slower, my appetizer arrived after my main and the waitress walked away when I asked for some hot sauce. Even paying the bill was a complete hassle. 

This place just sucks when it comes to customer service. Not worth the headache."}
{"text":"What can I say about The Starving Artist other than waffles. Waffles, waffles, waffles. To quote their menu, everything is either a waffle, served with waffles, or served on top of waffles. 

Is it heaven? Pretty much. 

I went not too long ago with a friend and had a great experience. While we were nervous that we would have to wait in line for hours (the Internet is a scary place that cautions that The Starving Artist can be quite busy on weekends), we were able to get a table straight away and got to eating quickly. We both had traditional breakfasts with bacon, cheddar scrambled eggs, and of course, waffles. I had regular waffles and my friend had potato; both were out of this world delicious. One thing I was incredibly delighted by was the amount of fruit that was served with our meal; so many brunch places charge an extra four dollars for a small plate for fruit, but this was included in the meal which was under $10. 

I'll definitely be back again as it is now a personal goal to consume all of the waffles on the menu."}
{"text":"This place is decent if your craving breakfast waffles. Went here on an early Sunday morning so as expected it was packed. You'll probably end up waiting 10-15 minutes in line depending on how many people you are with.

The waiters were very attentive and our food came after some time. Now the selection of waffles is pretty good so you wont have too much difficulty deciding what to order. For $15-20 it's more than reasonable."}
{"text":"Great new location. Love the food here. For some reason the size of the coffee cups are larger here than the ones they serve at the lansdowne location. The only reason i am giving 3 stars is because the server i had that particular day didnt seem like she was having a good day. When i asked for a $20 bill to be broken up for the tip all i got was bills back. It seemed quite inappropriate. And, although i was going to leave $5 anyway, i would have appreciated the choice to begin with. 

I visit this place at least once a week. It'll be unfortunate if i have to tip that server again."}
{"text":"Long line on Sunday and too many bees outside. But the food was great, good service, good smoothies. Waffle everything."}
{"text":"There's always a lineup at the Starving Artist on Lansdowne, so a friend and I decided to check out the new location on St. Clair for lunch. Sadly, there won't be lineups here if our experience is the norm. 

Service was p-a-i-n-f-u-l-l-y slow and when our lattes finally did arrive, I can confidently say it was the worst latte I've had in Toronto. Do they use a packaged coffee mix? It had some weird, overly-sweet chemical taste that was really off-putting. 

Our lunch arrived soon after the coffee, but sans cutlery. We requested some and waited 5 minutes. My lunch partner finally went and got it herself. 

My vegie sandwich was fresh, but the fruit on the side had seen better days. And seriously, I know waffles are the house specialty, but a waffle sandwich is over the top. And waffles with my friend's spicy TexMex 'sandwich' were just weird .

The room itself is nice...and that's about the only good thing I can say. There's lots of space between tables, which makes it super comfortable for guests with babies and strollers...a rarity in Toronto restaurants...so I can see it could be a popular spot for those with young children.

Finally, payment was by Cash Only. Oh, there is an ATM in the corner (with a $1.99 fee). This cash grab was really annoying and I was tempted not to tip at all, but I don't think the staff are at fault for the issues with this restaurant.

So, considering the combination of poor service and odd menu options (unless you adore all waffles, all the time), I won't be back."}
{"text":"The first time I've tried potato waffles and I can't get enough. The food and friendliness of the staff are a definite 5, but be careful going on a weekend when you may be neglected due to how busy it gets. Weekdays are your best friends at this location."}
{"text":"The best waffles in town. Anyone I bring/tell to go here always enjoys.

The potato waffles are so good. If you go with another person split meals, so you have one potato waffle and one sweet waffle (with fruit for dessert). I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Pretty decent waffles, etc. I like this location because they aren't any wasps (insect variety) like the original spot on Lansdowne. The downside to this place is that there are a lot of babies. 

Babies or Wasps? Your call."}
{"text":"Not sure why it took me so long to start coming to this place.

Great waffles (especially the very interesting potato ones...mashed potatoes done in a waffle grill) - and nice coffee. 

Only serious complaint is that while dining in the summer, Starving Artist has hands-down the WORST wasp problem I've ever experienced. And twice. I'm not sure what the issue here is, but it can seriously ruin your meal. The staff even brought a fly swatter over to our table to help combat them. You know what's more disgusting that wasps flying everywhere over your head and on your food? Having a well-used fly-swatter on the table. 

Outside of that, those waffles are pretty good. 

So I'll give this place 4/5 during most months of the year, but a 0-1/5 during that wasp season.

God-damn Wasps."}
{"text":"I was so excited to go to this place and I am glad I did! I got the mini waffles with hollandaise sauce. My friend got the potato waffles with salad. So good! I loved everything about the meal. The waffles were freshly made and the hollandaise sauce tasted marvellous. Don't even get me started on the potato waffles! I ended up eating one of my friends cause they were sooo good. Nicely seasoned and one of a kind. I went during the week so we walked right in. Can't speak for the weekend but I would assume it would be quite busy. Well worth it!"}
{"text":"I went back to Starving Artist on a Sunday for brunch because I was so impressed with their potato waffles my last visit. Not quite a latka, the potato waffles are made in a waffle maker which creates a thin crispy crust and a fleshy interior. Ingenious!  My last visit, I also had perfectly poached eggs with runny yolks and a devilishly good Hollandaise glaze. 

So there was no mistake that I would order the B. Benny which marries both of those elements together!

Unfortunately this visit was horrendous in terms of service!  Granted we were a large group of 10 and they usually are packed on the weekends, but it should not have taken an hour to get our food. At the very least, give us an update if you are running behind. There was no apology!  As expected, my eggs were overcooked. Go on a weekday if you still want to try them and and remain unscathed from this review!"}
{"text":"Another good reason to venture out to this neighbourhood besides the Value Village is this breakfast place.  I had their blueberry waffle with ice cream.  Yum!  This place gets busy...tables are closely set beside others and it can get loud.  My friend ordered the Waffle Benny, no complaints.  (I think everything on their menu comes with waffles.)

I haven't been here in the evenings so not sure if it is just as busy."}
{"text":"I am giving them the benefit of the doubt because I've been to this location before and because I like the food, but overall, in the times I've been, I haven't been especially impressed with the service, and today was especially problematic. 

BlogTO recently included Starving Artist on its list of most kid-friendly brunch places, with a special mention of the St Clair location. On the surface, I'd agree -- what kid doesn't like waffles? But if you have to wait 45m for your order, your kids are going to be very unhappy campers. 

Now, to be fair, it was Monday morning, and they were both understaffed and training what staff were actually there. But only one experienced server was on hand, which, even on a slow day, makes life difficult for everyone. You can't leave a single trainee chef in the kitchen without backup. All the staff were stressed, which impaired the service noticeably: we were barely acknowledged when we arrived; there was a considerable wait to be seated; the orders were mixed up; one of the kids was served last despite her order being the simplest... and we got very few updates to reassure us. 

Despite all this, we all enjoyed our food. To compensate us for our less than ideal experience, the manager (?) on duty reduced our bill. I still think, from what I've seen in the past, that they have a ways to go smoothing out some service issues, and they are chronically understaffed. It'd be nice to see this place thrive in this neighbourhood, but it will be a while before we go back."}
{"text":"Went here for my mother in law's bday this morning. We managed to make it in before the line up became insane. Ordered the eggs waffle benny and the hitchhiker waffles. All excellent. Specifically candied bacon. What's better than candy and bacon really?

All in all a quick and delicious meal that did not disappoint."}
{"text":"This review is mostly because of service, because our food was really good and unique. But our reception upon entering the restaurant really soured the experience. The place was empty when we came in. We let the girl behind the bar know that we were waiting for two more. She rudely told us we had to wait at the bar, and couldn't be seated. I'm aware that this is a common thing to do...........but when the restaurant is full or close to. There was one other table seated! Another girl jumped into to cover the extreme lack of tact, and said it was fine. I told her that of course if it got busy and we were still waiting, we'd move to the bar. It didn't, and our friends arrived within 5 minutes. Over the course of our meal we watched the first girl offend three other parties in some way. She acted like we were children coming to brunch in her living room. She needs to get a clue or leave the service industry.

Food was really good. I got the Fully Loaded, which was great because I don't eat eggs, and find it a real pain to go for brunch and find something on the menu to eat. It was FANTASTIC. So good that we're going to try and replicate it ourselves.

The not so great? The coffee is STRONG. Many people like it that way, so its not a real detriment. We also got the waffle bacon to start. Its labeled as \"Waffle coated bacon\" Really, its waffle strips and some of them have bacon inside. For $6?? Really? Don't bother with it."}
{"text":"this was my second time going there and I would go back again. it was very busy but they seated us very quickly. when we were sitting, the service was slow and they didn't bring us water. once we got the food it was very good.l"}
{"text":"The starving artist is starving for a reason. If you're craving waffles find a waffle place, if you're craving experiments that are called \"waffles\"; this is the place to go. The whole atmosphere came off as a tacky attempt at \"hipster\". The server seems extremely stressed despite the fact that we were one of 3 tables occupied in the joint. This place certainly has the potential to be a good restaurant, but it seems the they can't put the pieces together to do so."}
{"text":"Do you LOVE waffles?

Does the very idea of  a waffle incursion on almost every item on a restaurant menu excite you?  Do your doodles contain subconscious waffle patterns?

If all of this sizzling waffle talk has gotten your iron heated, then by all means - Jump on over to the Landsdowne station and give Starving Artist a try.  The waffles benny was prepared precisely to my spec and I am a fan.  Have tried the Hitchhiker on another occaision and, with the addition of avocado, found it to be a splendid cure for the common brekkie sandwich.  Coffee is quite good - liked the french press a lot on one of those high volume mornings and a very nicely pulled americano when one was enough.

I found the service to be stellar on each of my several trips - once during busy brunch, once in the evening, and one strange late afternoon business lunch when we were the only people in the joint.  The latter experience also featured a hi-larious interaction with the staff and our table taking turns creating a living spec for what precisely IS a hipster. 

If you find yourself - IN ANY WAY - waffling on the subject of waffles then you should probably give Starving Artist a miss. But - if you do LOVE waffles - or even consider them as a potential Food with Benefits, you will enjoy the food, atmosphere, and service of this unique spot in the west side."}
{"text":"My juice was expired. After apologies the server replaced it (and charged me for it!!) My eggs were left under the heat lamp so they were really dry. We had to remind the server like five times for things we were missing (napkins, sides we'd ordered...) Had to ask for the bill twice and then it wasn't itemized so we could divide the bill. Also, cash only is a pain in the ass especially when you have more than 4ppl. 

It was extremely busy, but we were first to be seated (I got there early and waited in line) and we were not the first served food. 

We'd been to this location before and had a great meal. I won't likely go back."}
{"text":"Super tasty food with very delicious coffee! The atmosphere is really interesting, they have a bunch of cool local art hung up with some fun music. 

We came in for brunch/lunch on a Tuesday around noon, thinking that it wouldn't be too busy. It was pretty packed, but we got seated after twenty minutes or so. Our server forgot our order so we wound up waiting for a bit longer, but that can happen to any server, especially when it's so busy. 

Def recommend, it's a really cute location with tasty food!"}
{"text":"Figures that once I move from the apparently on-the-cusp-of-not-being-sketchy Blansdowne area, a lovely brunch nook/watering hole opens up. 

But geographical bitterness aside, this waffle-centric joint has a lot going for it, from a cool, laid-back atmosphere and interesting but unobtrusive decor to a really, really tasty potato salad and an interesting interpretation of eggs Benny. 

Despite that fact that there was no omelette on the menu, my default brunch order, I was mega stoked to discover that they offered avocado as a substitute for bacon on the 'Waffle Benny', for FREE. Stoked to the point where i may have actually let a little squeal of delight escape my lips. Substitutions always cost, if they're even offered at all, so I was rather impressed that they let me know I could go the buttery vegetable (fruit?) angle without penalty right off the bat. I'm a sucker for the details.

My brunch partner took the exact opposite view of bacon and got 'The Hitchhiker' - cheesy scrambled eggs with two mini waffles - and opted to upgrade his caramelized bacon to 'waffle bacon', a completely new concept for me wherein bacon is added to the waffle batter for a marriage of sweet and meat. Despite the fact that I generally stay away from the stuff, curiosity got the best of me, and I went in for a sample of this coated bacon creation. The verdict? The sweetness and texture of the waffle actually offset the sometimes overpowering saltiness of bacon and also helped to eliminate the excess grease factor that usually turns my stomach. Definitely worth a try.

Ok, back to my dish. The Waffle Benny came with two sides, and despite Bart's proclamation to the contrary, Starving Artist did make friends with salad, one leafy and one creamy potato salad, which satisfied my yen for a hash brown like addition to my plate. 

The poached eggs were tasty, fluffy and enjoyed a nice smattering of hollandaise sauce and having the creaminess of an avocado was a welcome addition. Although I think I prefer an English muffin to a waffle as a the little bed for my eggs Benny to rest on, I enjoyed the subtly saccharine quality the waffle brought to the brunch table, even though I usually go for strictly salty.

The coffee, while a little on the strong side for me, was still plenty good and was promptly replenished and our waitress was capable, kind and refreshingly available while not being overbearing. Being able to balance those two qualities is sometimes the difference between good and great service and I'd say she nailed it.

I will definitely be hitting up this cozy and cool brunch joint/bar again and am curious to see what it's like after dark, which will probably happen sooner than later since they have a Nacho Night. This girl likes her cheese."}
{"text":"I was here today with my sister. We weren't looking for anything big, (even though the waffles looked really good), but because it was so hot we just settled on a snack. Both of us ordered some juice and the fruit and yogurt bowl. Now, we were seated right across from where the cooking staff were working and had the pleasure of listening to them talk about video games, ex-girlfriends and whatever else while they took a WHOLE HOUR to prepare an order where no cooking was involved. In the meantime, they made dishes for other tables who arrived long after us (albeit, slowly) and our chit stayed posted up on the board for them to see and ignore. We were about to leave when the waitress-- who was pleasant, apologized on their behalf and offered to comp us our drinks. Of course, this was not the waitress' fault, so we told her that and ended up tipping her at the end. Eventually, our food arrived and it was very good! The selection of fruit was delicious and there was lots of variety, but honestly? I could have made it myself at home in about 5 minutes. Probably won't come here again-- I can get a good waffle pretty much anywhere else in the city."}
{"text":"Yummy food! I got the veggie sandwich which came with fruits and a salad for around $12. Also, got a blueberry dessert which was small in size then what I pictured. It was absolutely scrumptious but for the size, I believe the price was too high. The staff wasn't the greatest. They took a long time to come to us when there weren't many people there in the first place. Overall, I rate Starving Artist for 4 stars."}
{"text":"Hmmm starting at the low point because of a 45 minute wait.  But the whole menu is about re-inventing the waffle. Waffle with egg. Waffle with cheese. Should be called Bubba Gump Waffle Co.  Anyways the food is mediocre due to the fact waffles don't go with everything, Service was very slow, I'd understand if it was the first day or week but they have been at this location for a while.
Maybe its the name of the place that makes people coming but its the only good thing this place has got going for it. 
In my defense I was thinking \" chefs are artists of the pallete\" and that this place must have a  crazy kitchen with some real culinary madness.... I was obviously mislead. The only thing I got to leave here with the thought \"I've been to the Starving Artist.\" Not too sure if that's a good thing."}
{"text":"NICE NICE NICE

Food was bomb but there was a long wait. Don't come here if you have a big group because you'll never get a table. 

The service was mediocre--nothing special. But I enjoyed my meal so I guess it was worth the wait? 

The prices are good for the serving sizes and the food didn't take long to come. It was very filling.

Overall, I would recommend this place to my friends, specifically for late breakfasts or for lunch."}
{"text":"delicious, but not worth the frustration. 

i will never ever NOT listen to yelp reviews EVER AGAIN. there was a huge discrepancy between this location and the original one at landsdowne, but since this one was closer, my brunch partner and i decided to try it. 

it took us 2 hours between first getting in line and to finally getting our food. i'm usually OK with a brunch wait...it's sometimes a part of the experience. but NOT when this wait to due to an inability to (a) manage staff, (b) hire staff, or (c) train staff...and this location seemed to be suffering from all of the above. the lineup was out the door, and then entire time i peeped through the window to see consistently empty tables. when we finally made it inside the venue, i asked the hostess about an empty table, \"is that a real table? we're just two people\". to which she responded, \"it is but there are just a lot of moving parts right now\". so if you read between the lines, it really means that the kitchen couldn't handle the volume. the kitchen is exposed and i saw two food cooks, one dishwasher, and one drinks person. they DEFINITELY could have used more staff. and since this is the second location by the same name, i would expect the owner/manager to have a leg-up on how to manage a restaurant by now. yes, the restaurant is spacious, but there is NO WAY that they could handle more capacity. 

our server was also very frazzled. we asked for the grilled cheese waffle with ham, to which she responded with a confused, \"grilled cheese?\". and my friend pointed at the menu and said, \"yes the grilled cheese\"- pointing directly at the menu. we also ordered drinks which didn't come. 15 minutes later, we flagged down the owner and we asked him to follow up. he came back to double-check what variety of tea i asked for. i told him, and he said that they were all out of that variety. so i settled for another. when he finally brought our drinks 20 minutes later, i double-checked with him to make sure that our food order was put in, to which he assured us that it was. 5 minutes later, we got our food. 

the food was VERY delicious. we ordered the starter of grilled cheese waffles with ham, a main of the \"sammy benny\" which was their take on eggs benny with smoked salmon (on waffle, of course), and a caramel pecan waffle for dessert. 

we probably should have went to the original location, but since location was its chance to reel me in, i won't be coming back. like what i said on my first line. this place is delicious, but just not worth it."}
{"text":"I came here with my out-of-town friend on Sunday for lunch and I am utterly appalled at the service and hygienes of this place.

Let me just get this off my chest because I was horrified after taking a sip of my almond vanilla latte - THERE WAS A DEAD BEE IN MY DRINK. 

Immersed in foam, I though it was just a piece of hair but once I fished it out with my fork, I noticed the legs... 

Okay, aside from the huge bee in my drink, there was only one server. We waited half an hour just for the menu, tables around us weren't cleared and there were flies everywhere. When she came to give us the menu, I pointed out to her there are too many flies.. And she responds with \"I know\" and rolls her eyes. 

If she cleared the table faster, maybe it wouldn't have attracted that many bugs. We were sitting at the cleanest table available and when she wiped it down, waffle crumbs fell into my sandals. 

As we wait for our food, three other tables left because they weren't even given menus. I had to ask for water two times and never received it.

We were seated right by the two garbage bins by the kitchen and the smell was horrid. The cook got into a heated argument with the server because he can clearly see upset customers and she cannot. 

The bee in my latte was the last straw. As I walked by the front to let the server know I was leaving, she just gives us a thumbs up sign. 

Just a note: the two other times I came during the weekend, service was significantly better and there are no flies during the winter. However, after this experience today, I will never come back.."}
{"text":"This location sucks ass. Haven't ever eaten here but the first time we arrived at 5:31 the girl had already locked the doors and pulled out the till. She came out and said \"sorry we are closed at 530.\" Came here the day after and it was 5pm, when we walked in there was nobody but the server gave the fakest smile because she obviously didn't want more customers coming in. She wouldn't let us sit anywhere in the restaurant except ONE particular spot because we would be \"in her way\". Also no where online does it say they stop serving the egg bennys after 4. Thanks to this location, I'll never be coming back to even try it."}
{"text":"Been wanting to check out this place for a while, and was impressed given the 3-star rating on Yelp. Possibly thanks to the -20 degree weather outside, the place wasn't too busy and we easily got a table. As another Yelper noted, perhaps some of their ingredients lean towards the prefab, but nonetheless for an indulgent waffle breakfast, was thoroughly enjoyable in taste and presentation."}
{"text":"Waffle-ly delicious!

I've been here a bunch of times.  

At first I was hooked... but as they boomed, the service got slower (lack of waitstaff not meeting the influx of customers), and my waffles were consistently ice cold with an unmeltable chunk of butter.

I returned a few more times and only ordered items with potato waffles because they are less icky when cold.

This place has come a long way since those cold waffle days.

This venue is still crazy cool. Artwork from local artists, the chill house tunes, the wonderful little backyard patio. The service is always friendly but busy.

They have a great menu, with savory lunch items and sweet dessert waffles.   I was starving and ordered one of the larger brunch dishes on the menu, the Hitchhiker with waffle bacon (about 10 bucks) with the dill potato salad.

My waffles were not ice cold! Not piping hot, but acceptable.
  
I still find the service quite slow, even though they have hired more staff. So, not the place to go if you are in a hurry, but great for a lazy afternoon.  

I would give the place four stars, but I have an issue with cold waffles.  And also in the summer, the bee problem does drive me crazy, but I don't know if that's actually fixable.  I just don't want to share my food with flying critters of stinging pain."}
{"text":"I can't say that I've ever been a big waffle fan (I tend to go for crepes or French toast), but Starving Artist may have made me a convert.  Their sandwiches with waffles instead of bread are great.  The smoked salmon sandwich with dill baked into the waffles and their BLT are particular standouts.  I wasn't as big of a fan of their chicken sandwich, which was somewhat bland.

It's a really busy brunch place.  You have to be willing to wait, which I have no problem doing.  The service is a bit hit or miss though.  The first time I went there, the service was efficient and courteous, but the second time, the waitress was quite distracted, forgetting to bring elements we had ordered and I had to wait 15-20 minutes for a refill of coffee.  But the food will definitely keep me coming back for more!"}
{"text":"The very first time I heard about this place - in November 2012 - I insisted we go there ASAP and we went the very next weekend for brunch. There were two things I was told that made me do this: 

1) Everything - and I mean EVERYTHING - they make involves waffles (want a BLT? Have it between two waffles!)
2) They make gluten-free waffles (which are also vegan). 

Needless to say, considering I gave The Starving Artist 5 stars, it did not disappoint. Despite all the regular waffles and flour being used, I've never had an issue eating here (though I am not really sensitive to cross contamination). When you order GF, the staff ask if it's an allergy, intolerance, or preference and use that information to prepare your food correctly to the best of their ability; so kudos to them for that.

My favourite dish here is the eggs benny. As much as I LOVE traditional waffles piled high with fruit, syrup, and whipped cream; the lure of getting an eggs benny I can ACTUALLY. EAT. in a restaurant (and a damn good one at that) is too much.  Also, it has caramelized bacon on it. Yes, you read that right. They do make their eggs on the runny side (and I mean REALLY runny) so if you're not into that, make sure you ask for them done differently. It comes with mixed greens an your choice of fruit, baked beans, or potato salad. I always go for the fruit, and it's always a nice, fresh mix.

The Cherry Chocolate Latte is also to die for (and as good as it sounds). I've yet to try their famous waffle bacon, but I am sure it's every bit as awesome as it sounds (how can you go wrong with waffles and bacon?).

Just this weekend, I brought my (also gluten-intolerant) mother and sister here, and they both fell in love. We all ended up with the eggs benny (again, how can you resist a gluten-free one?!) and all three of us cleared our plates. 

Other fun things about this place include a wide selection of boardgames, a movie always playing on the big TV, an open-concept kitchen so you can watch them cook, a nice front (and back!) patio, an aquarium with HUGE gold fish, and really awesome local artwork displayed (and for sale) adorning the walls. 

The only negative thing I can say about this place is the wait - it's quite small, and as you can expect, is VERY busy, so you'll be facing a wait during brunch hours. Since the place is small, this SUCKS during the winter, but during the summer it's less of a bummer as you can wander the neighbourhood or wait outside. However, the staff are always very friendly, upfront and as accurate as can be about table wait times or food wait times (this weekend, we had to wait over 45 minutes for food after ordering but we were warned about this before we even got a table and choose to wait).

I HIGHLY recommend visiting this place if you love waffles... or hell, even if you don't. It'll convert you."}
{"text":"Cool place. Great service. 

Waffles are unreal here. Everytime I go there is about a 30 to 45 minute wait. But honestly it is so worth the wait. Great smoothies. Great coffee and awesome food!"}
{"text":"Should've realized that this would be a bad experience as soon as I walked in and had to wait 20 minutes before someone asked how big my party was. The table itself and music were both fine, but then we had to wait an extra 10 minutes to order. Then an ensued an additional 30 minute wait for our actual food, which to be fair wasn't too bad. If we were going off food alone, this establishment may even warrant a 3 or 4 star review. But I think what really ground my gears was the disgraceful service our waiter \"Scotty\" provided us. Not even bothering to acknowledge us except to take our order and give us the check (someone else actually brought us our food, not him), Scotty gave us an awkward, cold, and overall disappointing experience. Finally, what ultimately solidified this one-star review was the fact that they only accept cash and failed to mention this in any manner (there were no signs or any other indications of this) until we tried to pay with card and were rudely told otherwise and had to use an ATM that charged us a hefty transfer fee. If you are willing to stomach this entirely embarassing experience just for the slightly above average food, then give this place a look. Otherwise, stay away - far, far away."}
{"text":"While it's true being seated and served can be at a casual (read: slow) pace, if you arrive at 9 am when they open, you'll get seated right away. The food is served hot, is tasty, and is a pretty good deal. Four awesome Eggs Benedict options in the $10-14 range, served on waffles (either sweet/wheat or savory/potato). The Hitchhiker is probably the best \"deal\" - $12 for two waffles, scrambled eggs with cheese, 4 strips of maple-glazed bacon (ask for it crispy - trust me), mixed greens, and some fresh fruit. I've eaten here four times, and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Their potato waffles are a must! I ordered the B. Benny and it was bomb! The only issue was that service is a bit slow but the food is worth it"}
{"text":"First time here, we had the potato waffle bennys, regular waffle bennys with potato salad, fruits, and side salad.  We loved everything.  I found the potato waffles slightly salty.  Their caesar is pretty good.  The carmelized bacon is pretty good.  Will be back for waffle bennys.  Have been here 3 times.  The third time was a flop.  Waffles were undercooked, poached eggs were overcooked.  The yolk should be runny. The bacon was sickly sweet.  The baked beans were too sweet.  Asides from the fruit on our plate, everything was left uneaten after trying a taste.  We will be back because this is 1/3 visits and we hope someone was just having a bad day."}
{"text":"Came back for the 1st time since being away for 5 years. The waitress didn't seem to make much effort to smile or provide friendly service. Took my order and then asked me if I was ready to order only 2 minutes later. I didn't receive my coffee order had to enquire and recorder with the barista. Received coffee with my food, it went cold while I ate. Perhaps it's just a personal pet peeve of mine but it really bothered me that I said 'thanks!' a few times and didn't receive any response. 'You're welcome' or 'how is your food?' would have been nice. Also, they have a huge wasp problem. I had to move because I was being swarmed my 4 wasps the whole time. Couldn't escape them either, really annoying!"}
{"text":"The best breakfast waffles ever! Both regular and potato waffles! I ordered the egg beni, substituted my bacon with tomato and avocado ( just ask the waitress/waiter) they'll gladly substitute any item on the menus. The dish was tasty and filling. 
The service is awesome, when we arrived and waited for our table they offered we sit on the bar till we sat on our table. 

The price is reasonable too! Will definitely be back here for brunch!"}
{"text":"I chose this restaurant for breakfast on my last visit to Toronto just because of the Yelp reviews, and I wasn't disappointed! My salmon eggs benedict was superb. I really love the feel of the cafe itself. This is hipster central, and I'm sure you see the chefs make your meal out of sheer necessity to maximize the space, but I appreciate it anyway. There's a patio out front and in back, but still not nearly enough seats to meet the demand, so if you're strolling in anytime after 10am, be prepared to wait a bit for a table. Staff is friendly, albeit a bit rushed, but it doesn't effect the quality. This is a perfect brunch spot!"}
{"text":"Good greasy breakfast.  Lots of waffles.  Everything is waffles, because it's a waffle place?!  Waffles here are pretty good, bacon is cooked right, not a fan of anything else though.  Got scrambled eggs which I think they forgot to scramble,    Coffee was good,  Great service and nice atmosphere.  Would come again, but only if I be craving waffles, because it's a waffle place."}
{"text":"We went late summer on a Saturday morning. Waffles eggs Benny for sister and myself, hitchhiker for the husband. I had the gluten free waffle which is potato, it was yummy, but the eggs Benny was underwhelming. Husband didn't want waffles, we didn't know that's literally all they have. I think you should be able to substitute with toast or something cheap and easy. The biggest problem was the bees. I am anaphylactic to bees, this was the most stressful meal of my life. There are hundreds of them, inside and out. I ate with my fork in one hand and epi-pen in the other. Won't be returning until the dead of winter when the bees are dead."}
{"text":"This restaurant is wonderful. I walked in with my friend at 11:30 on a Saturday. It didn't take too long to be seated - it was about a ~20 min wait. The menu options are great. They have a lot to offer. I went with the eggs benny on regular waffles (though I'd like to try the potato waffles next). The service was a little slow and it took a while to get our food, but that happens with Saturday brunch. The whole place was filled and the servers, despite the crowd, were as happy and attentive as they could be. 
The food, though. It was delicious. A perfect eggs benedict. I couldn't recommend it more. It wasn't too filling and I simply loved their flavours. 
I'll definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I hope this review is seen by management because my question to you is what is going on here?? The service is obviously consistently horrible here, judging by other reviews and my own experience. However the waitresses can't be blamed! This place is SO UNDERSTAFFED.

The restaurant was packed and only two people were staffed as front of house/waiting/bussing and 2 in the kitchen....nobody to greet you as soon as you walk in, water was only given to the table after asking, you're eating around tables with mountains of dirty dishes that haven't been cleared yet, and the wait for poached eggs was 30 minutes and nobody has the time to ask how your meal is. But you can only expect 2 girls to do so much with 20+ tables to serves! They were friendly but clearly out of breath from running around the place! 

In addition to that the food was just mediocre. Potato waffles are OK, regular waffles are OK, you can probably make a similar mix at home. We got the breakfast benny and it was filling but not great. I like that the fruit that comes with the food isn't cantaloupe and honeydew, but real fruit like watermelon, oranges, berries and grapefruit. 

Waitresses are friendly and the fruit was good which is why this place got 2 stars. Besides that, wouldn't go again!"}
{"text":"Went for brunch on Sunday. Wait time was 30mins and wait time for food was 20mins. This was my second time to starving artist. Loved their original location better then this. 
The waffles were salty and the rest was just mediocre. Won't be going back for sure. Not worth the line up"}
{"text":"Delicious potato waffles. The space is pretty and open, but the service isn't great (waited for 10 minutes one day at the door- the place was half-empty- and we weren't even acknowledged. We gave up and went down the street to Boom). The music is sometimes annoying top 40 stuff. For a less squeaky-clean, stroller-friendly atmosphere, good music and better service, try the Lansdowne location."}
{"text":"After seeing this place raved about on the Food Network's \"You've Got to Eat Here\", I finally got a chance to go. I absolutely love the feel of the place and the concept of EVERYTHING is made on or with waffles - very creative! The only downside I found to the place is that the place is CASH ONLY and it would be helpful if they shared this on their website because it was disappointing to find out right when we got inside. 
Besides that, I have to admit, it's a great place to eat. They had an \"Easter\" special since the long weekend was coming up and I think it's a very clever way to always keep the menu interesting!"}
{"text":"Hip place, cool concept. Thought the food was just average (nice presentation though). I had Eggs benny with salmon and very so so. Not good enough to convince me to come back. Coffee was good though. I think what rubbed me the wrong way too was they have filled maple syrup bottles on the tables but they are only on table syrup and you have to pay $2 for maple syrup. Not such a big deal but more so a cheap hoax"}
{"text":"I dont even know how the food is because nobody would take my order. I waited for a good long while, while being ignored."}
{"text":"Wandered in here thinking it was a coffeeshop and only intended to get some drinks and sit in some air conditioning for a while. 

Sat down and realised it was a full service restaurant and felt guilty, so I ordered a blueberries and ice cream dessert waffle (at 11 am, ha). It was the best thing I'd eaten in ages. Blueberry waffle covered in fresh blueberries, topped with ice cream and whipped cream and drizzled with butterscotch. The waffle was perfectly crispy and tender, and the sweet tart berries and cream were so delicious with it. 

If I lived here, this place would be my indulgence go-to spot."}
{"text":"it's been a while since i've been here and like i said in my last review i was more than happy to come
back.

i enjoyed my breakfast as much as i did last time, but i did notice (and agree with) the majority of the comments here.

we waited about 10 mins to get seated, when we arrived at the table the floor was covered in food that was wiped off the table and left on the floor.

my cousins seat was wet because the server must have just wiped it down. i appreciate that they're trying to get us seated asap but the cloth used to clean the table stunk and left a very bad after smell on the table.

our order was taken in a relatively quick manner and out food came out in a good time and cooked well.

i forgot that this place is cash only, they do have an ATM there; but the service fee to withdraw cash is expensive. My mocha latte was delicious and i really have no complaints about the service other than the one thing at the beginning."}
{"text":"Having been to the original location, I happy to finally get around to trying the newer downtown location.  This place is much bigger and open than the older one.  As others have mentioned, we also had to wait for a table.  However from the open concept, one can clearly see the tables being full and not just a result of bad service.   The staff were all fine and attentive, not sure why there are complaints about that as I was satisfied on that front.   Too bad the food that was a such a big let down.

The poached eggs were overdone to the point the yolk was solid.  The waffles from the grill cheese waffle were completely tasteless.   The side salad was nothing special and fruit side was not fresh either.  If I'm hungry and nearby the place in the future, it's debatable if I would rather starve or consume their food...coin flip situation."}
{"text":"Terrible service! The horrendously rude servers kept us waiting and waiting. When we enentually got seated, it took them 45 minutes to bring our brunch over and even then, they'd got the order wrong, for which not only did they not apologize but also told my friend off for having taken a bite of the food that the SERVER had just brought over by mistake!!!We'll never go back to this place!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! I've been here 2 times and was not disappointed. I had the B-benny and waffle bacon and oh boy is it good! They make waffles made out of mashed potatoes taste like heaven. I admit it can get crowded and busy... And unfortunately it has a big hipster vibe. But that doesn't affect the taste of the food. I would definitely give this place a chance. The best time to go is during the weekdays when it first opens as it is empty.  Way better than Boom Breakfast down the street."}
{"text":"Good brunch spot.  I shared the grilled cheese waffles with a friend, which was great.  

I had the Sammy Benny which is eggs Benedict on a waffle with fruit as a side; I substituted for a potato waffle which was delicious.  

Great, prompt service. Came at 10 am on a Sunday and a lineup started soon after we arrived.  I would come here again."}
{"text":"It has taken me nearly 3 years to give a hell about brunch. Just a fancy word for breakfast in a city.

I still say that but the difference is i do make more of an effort to go to recommended brunch spots.

I was bought here first last year by two good friends, they recommended the eggs benny on potato waffles. This was on the menu for $12 so reasonable i thought.
Surprisingly enough this was my first experience of Hollandaise sauce (i had to google it just to get the spelling correct), and it caught me off guard at first and i attempted to scrape most of it off.

I came again recently and decided i would give it another tr and enjoyed it much more. Maybe having tried new things over this last year i enjoyed the sauce more.

Overall i have enjoyed the service, and especially the food. The portions are really good and i am pretty stuffed by the end of it.

The first time i came was a cold sunday morning and we were waiting in line (outside) for nearly an hour. The more recent visit was on Saturday around 11am and we were seated straight away.

The actual place is not an overly fancy setup. They have a front and rear area outside for seating and inside it is low frills."}
{"text":"Went last night with my brother at his recommendation, he really loves this place. It was a Tuesday night so we had no trouble getting a table and it wasn't very busy. Our waitress seemed to be having dinner with her mom, so the chef took our order, kinda random but it worked. The staff was friendly and the potato salad was delicious!! I don't know if it was just an off day, but the side of avocado I ordered wasn't ripe at all. Alcohol was decently priced, overall a nice, cozy little bar."}
{"text":"I had high expectations for this place but after two visits I can now say this : the food was good (gluten free waffles and the presentation is great but I felt the service was sub par and the staff can even be rude at times, the food didn't arrive at the same time and there were errors in our order both times. However the biggest insult is they tried to serve us corn syrup and pawn it off as maple... And when we asked to give us maple they said they didn't know where it was. I'm sorry but if you serve waffles... Maple syrup is a must have."}
{"text":"Banana milkshakes are exceptional and the main reason my review is 4 stars instead of 3. 

Food wise it's pretty good and the savoury waffle concept is a nice change from the other run of the mill brunch locations.

Is it really necessary to be cash only? I understand this decision is somehow linked to the name but the decor and prices hardly suggest the venue is aimed at low-income patrons."}
{"text":"Easily the worst meal I've had in city in years. The fact that they accept only cash is the canary in the coal mine for how the entire restaurant operates - as cheaply as possible with no regard for the customer. Another red flag? They have cute little maple syrup bottles on every table... filled with shitty Aunt Jemima. 

Everything was prefab, from the potato salad to the hollandaise to the waffle mix. This is seriously perplexing as it would actually be cheaper and better for everyone if this stuff was homemade, the only explanation being that the owners are not only cheap but lazy. Yet all this would be fine if they just billed themselves as a shitty breakfast spot like Overeasy - yes it's not great, but you don't have expect it to be. But no, they clothe themselves in hipster branding to give you the illusion that they actually give a shit about the product or you the customer. 

I'll save you the trouble, they don't."}
{"text":"The place is tiny so expect a long wait. The waffles were mediocre. Almost the same as getting freezer waffles. They weren't light and fluffy; and were small.  It's nice to have vegan options though."}
{"text":"2.5 STARS
I came here for a late Sunday brunch and luckily was seated immediately.  Decor is simple, rustic with local artwork displayed on the walls.  No air conditioning which made for an uncomfortable environment on a hot day and I was offered room temperature water to drink, go figure.

Ordered the B. Benny ($15) which were 2 bacon benedicts served on potato waffles.  A side salad and a few pieces of fruit as an after thought completed the plating.  I will say they do make a better than average hollandaise sauce and the potato waffles were tasty.  Other than that everything else was ho hum average.  Because of the unbearably stuffy, hot restaurant I could not get out of there fast enough.  I would assume creating a comfortable space for diners is just as important as providing good service and food.  I guess I was wrong.  Also the portion was meager & did not satisfy my hunger.  For the same price at Under The Table,  I am able to get a filling brekkie and a coffee.  In hindsight, I should have gone there instead...live and learn."}
{"text":"A-mazing! That place is so good, if you love waffles, then come to this place. The service was fast and it has a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Took my wife here as part of a birthday weekend of brunches, not realizing, that it's a waffle house.  And I don't like waffles.  She was surprised alright!

Not only is everything waffle here, but it's also darned good.  My dish (Sammy Benny) was a touch salty, but I think that might be because of the salmon.  If so, there should be an adjustment in the other ingredients for that.  My wife had the regular Benny, and that was really good.

Based on that, we'd come back.  :)"}
{"text":"Waffles waffles waffles! 

How could I not love this perfect little Spot. I recently went here again for my birthday lunch. My friend and I both got the chicken club waffle sammy. Why aren't all sandwiches on waffles? We both went for the side of potato salad which is also amazing. It wasn't the lightest of lunches but if you're hungry this is the spot! Also this place is great if you're gluten free.

The staff here is also really nice, The few times I have been here I always end up chatting with them before I leave. 

I have to check out the St. Clair location next!"}
{"text":"Cute little spot. My friends and I had to wait at the bar for a friend who was late because they wouldn't seat an incomplete party. Though it was disappointing, it turned out to be the highlight of our culinary experience!

We watched the kitchen guys in action. (The kitchen is located in the middle of the restaurant.) They absolutely love their job! They joked around and were extremely efficient. They even fed us fresh fruit while we waited. It was awesome.

On to the food! Waffles! That's all I gotta say. Their traditional ones are just perfect. I had a bite of my friend's waffles. I opted for the potato waffles which I got  with \"The Hitchhiker\" and substituted the bacon for avocado. Potato waffles! Yes. They were as awesome as they sound. 

Though the restaurant is far from downtown, it's worth the trip. :D"}
{"text":"Loved it here! The best eggs benedict!"}
{"text":"Great brunch spot for Eggs Benedict.

On the weekends it gets busy and the wait could be long. We wait for about 40 mins at 11 o'clock on Sunday.

Eggs are perfectly cooked and perfect with their waffles and caramelized bacon. If your eggs aren't cooked medium, which is the default, let them know and they'll make you another set. Potato waffles (B.Benny) are waffles that taste like mashed potatoes. I usually get one with regular waffle and one with the potato waffle to share with someone. Two potato waffles are too rich for me.

Cash only."}
{"text":"Starving Artist located on Lansdowne just north of Bloor is an unusual eatery.  The base for all meals is waffles! Everything is served with this Belgian delicacy.  Waffle sliders, waffles with baked beans, waffle Benny, and a chicken/ bacon club on waffles!   These guys have a serious love affair with waffles.  Brian and Tobias have managed to create a fascinating waffle menu with sweet and savoury combinations that transcend typical bistro fare.    The atmosphere is super chill and inviting.  They always play good music and often have cool old school movies playing on a projector.  A variety of fun board games are available to play while you have a drink or a snack.  There is a front and back outdoor patio for those beautiful summer evenings.  They often have DJs spinning at night and occasionally live music.   The decor is pretty random, but very fun to look at.   Huge crowds of hipsters for weekend brunch, so I would advise rising a little earlier than usual if you are not too hungover to beat the crowds-supper time is far less crowded during the week.  They have reasonable prices and great people at Starving.  

I highly recommend this waffle bar!

But make um understand its Westside foe life!
Thanks so much for your time."}
{"text":"Came on a busy Sunday afternoon. The service was pretty good and the wait for a table and for food wasn't too bad considering how busy it was. 

I ordered an Americano and the chicken and bacon waffle and was impressed with both. It was just under $20 per person with tax and tips. I'd come back again :)"}
{"text":"Came here a couple of days ago for a double date. Wasn't that busy and got seated in 5 minutes. The waitress was nice but the food came in 30+ minutes. I ordered the B. Benny which I thought was fairly expensive for its amount and quality. My major complaint is that the egg was hardboiled ) :"}
{"text":"The most amazing light flavorful waffles you can imagine. And there are so many ways to have them, sweet or savory; gluten free or not--or potato.  I had the plain ones with blueberries and a touch of syrup served with a salad and maple beans.  My husband had potato with caramelized bacon and poached eggs served with salad and beautiful mixed fruit. Both meals were incredible.  It's a must if you're in the waffle mood--and would be great even if you're not."}
{"text":"Went at 2pm and there was no line, and space on the patio... but really, 2pm is pretty late for brunch, even for me, so that's not saying much.

Ordered the breakfast waffles, poached eggs (lovely runny yolkes) on mashed potatoes that had been crisped in the waffle iron. It was good and very filling. I also appreciated the amount of fruit that came with it. I wish there was more bacon. One because it was delicious. Two because there can never be enough bacon. 

I would definitely go back, especially if I had a sweet craving! The waffles with fruit and whipped cream looked amazing.

$16 with tax and tip for the breakfast and a tea."}
{"text":"Starving artist is amazing! 

I have been to the original 1st location before, however it's been closed down and 3 other locations have opened up. There's no doubt in my mind that this is the best Waffle House! 

Their waffle bacon is a must upon arrival while waiting for your meal. 

Starving artist has a wide variety or sweet and savoury waffles. 

My favourite go to meal is; B Benny (on the potato waffle). It's super filling, creamy, and delicious. 
You also get a choice of a side between bakes beans, fruit or mashed potato salad. I opted for the fruits! 

In addition to the meal, I got a vanilla almond latte. The drink was amazing! Not overly sweet, but with hints of maple sweet flavour... definitely a good start to the day!! 

The waiters were on point with the seating system. Even tho the line was fairly long, the staff made it a quick and painless waiting process. Before we knew it, we were already sitting at a table! 

Starving Artist is cash only!! Bring some cash or use the ATM they have on location. 

Aside from the food... starving artist is known for their art on the wall which made a great display, a great way to get to know the local artists, or purchase a painting for yourself. 

I highly recommend a visit to starting artist to anyone and hope to see more locations pop up."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. They use cold Kraft singles in the breakfast sandwich. I asked the waiter if the cheese could be melted, which he took it back to do, but reacted very defensively. Side salad had lettuce on the verge of rotting. Mount Pleasant desperately needs a better brunch place."}
{"text":"Cute little place that serves a great breakfast. Went with a group of 7 on Saturday afternoon brunch. Seated quickly because we arrived early but did notice that a long line was present in the restaurant the entire time we were there. All of us ordered some variation of eggs benedict and everyone enjoyed their meal.

You get a choice between potato waffles (mashed potatoes in a waffle shape) or regular waffles and both are quite good. Comes with a side of greens and your choice of fruit, beans or potato salad. Service was pleasant.

They accept cash payment only."}
{"text":"Had to check out the brunch. Ordered the eggs benny. The eggs were hard boiled! The fruit on the side was desiccated. The waffles (in lieu of muffins) were tasty but on the mushy side. 

Friendly service. Maybe a bit too casual at times, but I can accept that vibe."}
{"text":"I really enjoy coming here for their delicious breakfast and the coffee is great too.  The place feels nice inside and the decor, although old, fits the style and food they serve here.  It's hard to find a good waffle house in the GTA let alone on the west end, but this one fits the bill nicely! 

My go to meal is the Chicken bacon club or the Breakfast Benny.  The portions are almost perfect and they have a nice option for salad and fruits on the side.  The waffles are made fresh and if you're super hungry make sure to grab some waffle bacon on the side.  I've never had waffle bacon before this place and it's hard to go back!

Overall the food is great and the staff are fairly friendly and attentive.  I always like going here for a breakfast or brunch treat and I'm never disappointed.   I'll be back for more waffle bacon!"}
{"text":"Great environment, great food, BUT BEWARE OF THE LINES AND THE WAITING TIME. My friends and I got to the restaurant at 1:30ish and we waited about 30 minutes for a table. By the time our food got here, it was around 2:30. 

The food was really AMAZING though. I got the Waffle Benny - 2 mini waffles topped with poached eggs, avocado & hollandaise sauce. It came with a side of greens and some super fresh fruit. (I substituted bacon for avocado). I was amazed at how good the food was, how fresh the fruit was. I also got a latte! 

So, good place to go eat but the waiting time is just crazy. The restaurant takes no reservations and only seats you when all members of your party gets there."}
{"text":"Best breakie in the west end. The potato waffles are delicious, add eggs Benedict (my case smoked salmon) and you can beat it. Must try."}
{"text":"Starving Artist is the Ultimate Hipster Breakfast and Im not even mad. I love everything about this place ! The food , the music , the look .The service was awesome ,loved the music. Im not a fan of chains and this is right up my alley. Very authentic and explemfies what living in the city is all about. I ate everything on my plate. Parking can be hard so either go early to park on the street  or park in a lot and walk down. I can't wait to go back again"}
{"text":"Great food. Worst service in history of hipster service. Been coming here for years and they can't ever seem to staff the restaurant. Always making excuses that they are under staffed. Management is completely busted. Learn how to hire reliable staff. Other locations are fine. This one is completely broken."}
{"text":"I went to Starving Artist for brunch today after reading about it on yelp. I normally don't eat food like this so it was a special treat. It did not disappoint!
I had the breakfast benny. The potato waffle was an very nice touch.  It was creamy and smooth and made it a hearty meal. The caramelized bacon was delicious. The eggs were slightly runny, but not offensively so. Also, the presentation was beautiful. 

The ambience is not my favourite: noisy, cramped.  Plus my friend and I were sitting by the door, so there was a draft and people standing over us at all times (we went at 1 pm today, a Sunday).  But aside from that we had a lovely brunch.

I don't see myself going back here often, because I tend to stick to a healthier diet. But on special occasions, like the day before New Year's, yeah, this was perfect.

Oh yeah, there seemed to be a rush of people right after we arrived, so you may want to go earlier to avoid lineups etc.
I can't say what it's like before 1pm, but I can tell you this: we sat in the last available table and our food came out promptly."}
{"text":"We came to this place for lunch and despite the 15-20 min wait in line, it was well worth it. We got the salmon eggs benedict - Absolutely spectacular. The mix of flavours cooked into this dish was top notch, the Hollandaise sauce smelled and tasted like heaven multiplied by 2 no lie. Anyways, all the customers seemed happy and we understood why. Great place to check out, I'd definitely go again!"}
{"text":"My cousin was raving about this chain as one of Toronto's best brunch spots. So I had my first go at \"starving Artist\". The lineup was 15 mins before we got seated. The place was full for a 11 am spot, and a cash only place ( ATM on site-around a 1.50$ withdrawal fee according to my cousin-not bad). We got seated in the back near the bathroom area. I was happy and upset at the same time: Happy that I got to take some great shots capturing the chefs at work; upset because every few mins there were people waking by - the beautiful graffiti art can only distract me so much. 

We asked the waiter to move us to another empty for 2, but the waiter said it was reserved for 3 ppl and they brought in an extra chair for the person in the middle of the walkway. If made no sense considering the table we wanted to give up had way more space. So a straight no was our answer. 

I ordered a Bloody Caesar for 8.50$ that was very spicy that I couldn't finish it. My highlight was my main meal the Sammy Benny -17$: the eggs Benedict were truly perfect, sitting on two miniature waffles that were  equal amounts of sweet and savoury. I really enjoyed the potato salad. This meal was large and good to share. I was stuffed.

A good brunch spot for a fairly reasonable price range- needs work on customer service area."}
{"text":"Oh. My. God. How am I only discovering this place now? Waffles on every dish?? Oh man, talk about brunch heaven. Went on a Saturday around 11:30am, pretty prime time I'd say, and got a table within 2 minutes. Both myself and my boyfriend got the waffle benny, and it was SO good. Perfectly poached egg, sweet caramelized bacon, and hollandaise sauce on top of a waffle. Wow. And as a side I picked the potato salad, and although it was not the most brunch-like side to pick, it was probably the best potato salad I have ever had. I'm getting hungry again just thinking about it...

The waitress was super friendly and attentive too. So glad I found this gem thanks to Yelp! :)"}
{"text":"The food was great and creative, something you'd expect from a place called starving artist.

They had a waffle twist to classic breakfast meals that works. Eggs Benny was one I had to try and it didn't disappoint. Had that with a Caesar that was really good as well.
3 levels of spicy on the Caesar and I took the hottest.... It was spicy."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I came here during the week on a rainy day. We've always wanted to try it, and let me tell you it was worth it. The staff is very friendly and sat us down immediately, it wasn't too busy but enough for a rainy week day. I ordered the breakfast waffle with a side salads. The waffle was extremely tasty but too much food for me. Definitely recommend it! My fiancé ordered breakfast Benny. She too enjoyed it, but found that regular bacon should be offered as there's too many flavours with all the different styles. Lastly, she had spicy Caesar (too spicy) to drink and I ordered the caffe laté (yum).

All in all I found that this place is very unique in what the offer and you can guarantee that you will not leave hungry. I can see this place being great on a sunny summers morning!"}
{"text":"While the food is great and the reason we come back, the wait can sometimes be longer than an hour and a half on the weekends at brunch-time. This can, unsurprisingly, be INCREDIBLY frustrating."}
{"text":"Hmm. What to say about this place. Waited too long to get seated, waited even longer for our food. Saw lots of people wait forever for food. Once food came, only one dish came out at a time. We even saw couples get turned down from empty tables claiming \"the kitchen is too behind.\" Food was good, but service was unacceptable to the point where we had to say something and they took care of the bill. Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Decided to finally try this place and I'm glad I did. Some of the best eggs benny EVER."}
{"text":"i don't get why this place is only averaging 2.5 starts while I write this review.  I thoroughly enjoyed my experience here.  I was with my wife and our baby and the staff was very accommodating and actually chose a perfect table for us where we could fit our stroller.  The food came out quickly enough and it tasted great.  We shared two plates, i think it was called the benny d and the one with wafflles made of potato. The coffee was not bad, I do wished however the server would have came around to top up my coffee.

we had to wait about 25 minutes, so not too bad.  It had a nice vibe as well.

we don't live in the area, but we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Just grabbed lunch with a friend. 

Ordered plain waffles - they come with mixed greens plus your choice of beans, fruit and some other options, I chose fruit. 

All was fresh and delicious, as expected.

Grabbed peppermint tea to drink. I'm not usually a fan but this was good.  

Server was patient, friendly and attentive. 

Pricing is good, portions are large. 

Atmosphere is laid back. :)"}
{"text":"This was the worst dining experience I have had in recent memory. Here we go.

The Hubster and I come here for a late holiday Monday brunch. We go in and see a bunch of people sitting in the little coffee shop area up front. I get the attention of the server behind the counter and ask for a table of two. She asks for my name and writes it on a piece of paper. I say \"Oh, is there a wait?\" and she says no. The server goes to seat a family that came in before us and disappears for about 10 minutes, so we sit in the coffee shop area, not waiting, apparently. This is not a good start, as I am incredibly hungry.

Some big issues with the place:
- the servers don't know their menu. For a place with gluten/dairy free options and a small menu, they seem to be pretty unaware about whether items do or do not have dairy.
- No coffee, just (non-refill) americanos. If there's anything that might qualify as Canadian food, it's breakfast. And breakfast = bottomless coffee.
- Small stuff, like dropping a bottle of water at the table without glasses, and coffee without a spoon. Am I being nitpicky? Yes. But that's because...
- We waited about 45 minutes from when we walked in the door to getting our food. That's way too long for waffles, eggs and bacon in a dining room that maybe seats 50. In fact, we waited a very long time to order or get anything else. That left ample time for us to look around at the half dozen tables not being bussed, the impatient people in the waiting area and all the other borderline upset looking diners and nitpick at every damn thing.

All these things I can actually forgive if the food is good. Well it wasn't. I ordered the brunchwich with the vegan waffles. An overcooked egg, a slice and a half of skinny bacon between two palm-sized waffles that could only be described as violently bland. It came with a side of potato salad that was obviously bought by the tub. I know this because my parents love Costco. The Hubster had the same thing but with all the dairy options (regular waffles, cheese, secret sauce). He was also disappointed with his meal. 

Listen, if you have a place that has waffle paintings all over the walls and brags about how everything on the menu comes on, under or between waffles, the waffles have to be incredible. Even the vegan ones. Your bread and butter has to taste better than bread and butter. If you have a whole section of your menu devoted to eggs benedict, it behooves you to make your hollandaise from scratch. And if you have the audacity to serve potato salad at all, it better be from scratch because it is the cheapest, easiest thing to make from scratch. I know this because I go to a lot of pot lucks and potato salad is what I do when I'm being cheap and lazy.

The whole experience from start to end just smacked of poor effort. Starving Artist on St. Clair West, you have made my black list."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! There is so much from the menu to choose from. Lots of bacon, chicken and turkey options; sweet and savoury waffles. My favourite was the waffles made with potatoes. 

I went back on a busy Saturday brunch time. The waitress was nice to us and didn't take too long for the food to come. You can tell this place is a busy one as there was a huge line forming to get into the restaurant. 

Just beware that if you're not in the mood for waffles, this is not where you go."}
{"text":"I love brunch and make a point of trying new places anywhere I travel. Starving Artist is a unique and very ingesting take on brunch which I really enjoy. First, the atmosphere: embodies how a \"starving artist\" wold decorate a restaurant, from the wall projections playing scooby-doo (or some old black and white movie) to the board games scattered about...feels more like you're in someone's house than in a public restaurant. Staff are really friendly -every one of them hipster to the core, server by day and seemingly rockstar/painter or author by night. The food is equally as inspiring with waffles liberally subing-in for what would usually be breat or toast. The candied bacon and potato waffles are to die for. Place gets rammed on week ends so go before 10am or be prepared to wait. Overall, a great option if you're open to trying a new brunch experience."}
{"text":"Came here on Saturday at around 1pm, had a bit of a wait but that is to be expected for waffles.
Because, you know, waffles.

The servers were quite lovely and tried their best to be accommodating towards everyone. Little things like informing waiting customers how long the wait would be and serving water are pretty basic, but so many other places don't do that, so for that thank you servers.

Other than that I had a pretty horrible experience there.
We ordered coffees and were not given any spoons. 

The music, oh my god the music, it was loud AF deep house beats. It was a terrible choice for a brunch setting, it would of been suited more towards an after hours. 

On to the food! it was overly sweet, I ordered an eggs benny with potato waffles, and holy moly, why was everything on this dish so sweet? even the side of potato salad was laced with a butt load of sugar. I couldn't finish my meal. I must say though, that who ever cooked my poached eggs knew what they were doing, the eggs were perfect, everything else not so much.

On top of all this, everything took a long time. Coffees came in about 15 minutes after we've ordered and food took approximately 30/35 minutes.

Again, they might of been under staffed that day but I still would not recommend."}
{"text":"Awesome place that opened very recently (June 2009). On the site of an another restaurant, it has the open airy feel of a cool cafe though it's in the middle of an old industrial area.

I know of it because I work in the area. And like school letting out for children at the end of the summer, every lunchtime one can observe a ravenous pack of my coworkers roaming the area of Lansdowne and Bloor, looking for anything edible. 

Until Starving Artist, the breakfast/lunch choices in the area were dismal.

Starving Artist serves waffles. Their thing is waffles. Waffles and coffee. Breakfast waffles, lunch waffles: Potato waffles with poached eggs, bacon, and chives. Mini waffles with maple syrup. Waffle sandwiches with various goodies. And coffee.

I have eaten there 2 or 3 times already and I have not been disappointed. The coffee is great. Love their espresso. The owners are two friends for whom this is a side-business to their passion as artists (I think). You can see examples of their work on the walls. It's very good. 

The only downside to this place is the price. It's a bit on the expensive side. But I think it's worth it."}
{"text":"First thing to note - this place is CASH only..

We went recently for weekend brunch here and while it wasn't my favorite place, I still think it deserves four stars.

Line up wasn't out the door like many places on College street in the summer, but rather a smaller line inside.  Waited maybe 15 minutes max for a table.  Atmosphere is pretty loud in the place, mostly due to people talking which seemed to amplify all over the restaurant.  It was a hot day too and while they did have AC, I think the open kitchen also really heated up the joint.

Service was great, very friendly and efficient.  I ordered the Hitch Hiker, which is basically just a regular breakfast..to be honest, the cheesy scrambled eggs were hardly cheesy, and a little disappointing.  The side salad and fruit that came with it, however, made up for any issues.  My friend had the Sammy Benny, which looked pretty good as well.

Overall, it was a bit of a trek to come out here for brunch so while I don't think I'll be a regular customer, I loved the 'everything with waffles' concept.  It's reasonably priced as well, and a good addition to the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"I've seen pictures and have read reviews about this place, so I finally decided to go check it out. The food here is fantastic! I had the waffle bacon to start with and then I had the Sammy Benny. The staff here seemed very friendly and they went out of their way to accommodate my friend who made special requests. The place is small so I can already tell there must be longer line ups on the weekend. Will most definitely start coming here regularly."}
{"text":"Amazing! I practically live there :)  Beware, depending on what time of morning you arrive, there might be a line way out to the front door. Food is fantastic, comforting and filling. Great portions and option for GF, etc. Not to mention, awesome smoothies!"}
{"text":"I have had the B. Benny potato waffles- best thing ever.  I tried straying from it once and it was a mistake.  Must go with B. Benny only!  Some of their dessert waffles look amazing too.  Their vanilla almond latte (half sweetened) is also a home run.  It gets busy so need to go there right as it opens!  The waitstaff are also pretty friendly.  Definitely a great addition to the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Tried to order spicy chicken waffle, but was told ran out of chicken!! Ordered the smoked salmon instead. Waited an hour.. Still no food. Watched many other guests complain why there is no food. The menu is so simple wtf is the problem with this place. Canceled order and left. Not sure if it was a bad day, but the staff didn't seem to take these problems seriously. It's a shame as I've heard good things about this place. What a waste if time, huge fail on their part."}
{"text":"I was planning on trying out Starving Artist for so long and I finally got the chance to try it! 

We came here on a weekday around 11AM and there were still many seats available in the back. I got the B. Benny which came with two potato waffles, poached eggs, Hollandaise sauce, bacon, a side salad, and I chose a side of potato salad. The potato waffles were good but because they were pretty thick, they were heavy to eat and I couldn't finish both waffles. The potato salad tasted really good though and I would have gotten the Waffle Benny which has mini waffles instead of the potato waffles.

Decor was pretty cool, service was okay but kudos to them as there was only one waiter and one person preparing the food."}
{"text":"I visited this location in the winter. Went around 11 and waited in an hour long lineup in the cold which wasn't the best but definitely well worth the way! I got the benny on the mini waffles... INCREDIBLE. Also started with the waffle bacon. It's incredible.

This past weekend I visited the new College location, and was just as impressed as I had been visiting this one! I tried the benny with the potato waffles and the potato waffles were SOOOO well done.

Will definitely be visiting again! :) Great friendly staff as well."}
{"text":"I came here on a weekend and it was packed - but for a good reason! Their benedicts are amazing and seemingly healthy! I ordered a \"B Benny\" and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I was particularly surprised by their potato waffles because of how savoury they were. Coupled with a side of fruits and a well-tossed salad, it made a perfect brunch meal. Not to mention, the staff are super friendly!

Fair warning, groups of 6 or more may find themselves in a bit of a pickle. Their largest table seats 6 and they have limited space to work with. With that being said, it wouldn't hurt to call in for a reservation or coming here on a weekday - but probably best to come in groups of 6 or less in any case.

Overall, a great place to tryout if you're looking for a cozy brunch restaurant in the Little Italy area."}
{"text":"Great service! Such good comfort brunch food any day. If you are a fan of potatoes - you will love the potatoes waffles! Definitely heavier option & more filling for potato waffles. Great variety & good balance of healthy sides including salads and fruits! Been to two diff locations - consistent quality/standards!"}
{"text":"First impression: 
Self seated, only there is no sign that indicates that so you're standing there waiting only to be told you can seat yourself. 
Cozy , Cafe interior, with great natural lighting except it was sunny as heck , leaving the front two dining tables blazing with sunshine so my party ended up sitting in the very back next to the washrooms. 

Service : Service wasn't horrible but wasn't great; she was attentive, came by often but gave off a \"i don't care\" vibe. 

Food: 
It's good, I wasn't wowed by it. 
Waffles seemed soft/soggy for my liking, not crunchy enough 
Water is Lukewarm/room temperature, and I'm not sure if ice is available but it wasn't given 

CASH ONLY - atm available with a $2 fee 

I'd probably go again if it was last minute and I happened to be nearby, but I would not go out of the way to eat here"}
{"text":"3.5 STARS

I work literally a 2 min walk away from this location of Starving Artist, so needless to say my whole office was excited when they opened. I've been here on several occasions.

THE FOOD: Starving Artist has great waffles, I'm particularly a fan of their potato waffles, which are impressively light considering they're potato based and are a great base for all of the savoury waffles. 

THE SPACE: The restaurant is spacious and bright, but always packed around lunch time. The wait time at the door is generally minimal (10-15 mins) but the wait once you have ordered can be excessive. This is not a place to go for a quick work lunch. Definitely budget 1-1.5 hours.

THE SERVICE: No big complaints about the service, it's always friendly and helpful. On one occasion, I was there with a friend who let them know she has a pineapple allergy, yet pineapple was still put in her fruit salad, so we weren't particularly impressed with their attention to detail. However, they were very apologetic and brought her a new fruit salad immediately."}
{"text":"The place serves great waffle-brunch items, but considering i was the only customer in there, I was baffled to see how the server managed to screw up my order... twice. They were nice enough to fix it, but the service was very slow. I can't imagine what it would be like if they were busy. I got the Waffle Benny, which was delicious, although my avocado was brown and not good. I would go back to try the waffle Sammy benny, but it's not a \"must-return\" type of status on my list of places to go to, since the service just didn't cut it for me."}
{"text":"So this wasn't the experience I had hoped for it to be. We ended up at the place next door instead of Starving Artist. We didn't realize it until after we waited in a long line, got a table for 4 and looked at the menu. Only then did I realize it's not the same menu as what I read online prior too. Embarrassingly enough, we ran to Starving Artist next door which had yet another long line. We waited in this line for what felt like a good 30-45 mins. Apparently the waitress had gone to the wrong place when she first came to this place. The College St location is very tricky. Please don't go to the wrong place! Maybe Starving Artist needs to do a better job of this .. they might be giving away business to their neighbours. 

The server asked us if we wanted to look at the menus while we waited for our table (we had already done this by this point). We finally sat down and our server took another while to come to our table (when the other server knew full well that we had a chance to look at the menu so we would be ready to order right away). This was upsetting. 

One of my friends ordered an Iced Americano and asked for sugar. This sugar was brought to us without a spoon. 

BREAKFAST:
B Benny - I ordered this and I forgot to tell them to substitute the bacon for a vegetable. They brought it and had no qualms about taking it back and simply giving me avocado as a substitute. Thank you for understanding and not making a stink about it!! 

The Benny on the potato waffle was holy smokes ... INCREDIBLE. It melted in my mouth and I haven't ever tasted anything like it. 

Also had the beans on the side as opposed to salad and fruit. Get the beans! They are pretty good."}
{"text":"Cash only. Friendly staff. Nice place. I took poached eggs with avocado on potato waffles with fruits and greens. Egg yolk was too firm though."}
{"text":"Surprised this place doesn't have a page already; the other locations seem quite popular! Apparently the wait time for brunch is nothing (yet) as this location isn't really known of ATM. They also only take cash right now and do not have a liquor license at this time.

My friend and I came for brunch. We have both heard of the Starving Artist before, where everything is served with or on waffles. The waffles can be changed to potato waffles btw!

I ordered the Waffles Benny. For $10 you get two mini waffles, each topped with bacon and a poached egg and hollandaise sauce. I subbed the bacon with avocado for free (there's a list of substations and their costs on the menu). I asked for a side of fruit with my dish (there were two other choices which I cannot recall now). My friend ordered the chicken bacon sandwich and she dubbed the bacon with avocado as well.

My poached eggs were a bit overdone (no nice runny yolk when I cut into it) but I found the combination of waffles, egg and avocado topped with the hollandaise to be really nice. My friend didn't really like her sandwich. We both got huge portions of salad greens with our dishes (which was a waste as we dislike salad greens). We also found the side of fruit to not be a great selection of fruit.

I also ordered an almond milk latte, iced. It was a bit too sweet for my taste (which means it's WAY TOO SWEET as I already dump excessive amounts of sugar and sweeteners into my coffee drinks).

I like the atmosphere and the service. But I think the food wasn't as special as I had hoped and I probably won't be back as there are so many other places that I enjoyed more.
But I will say that the pricing is very reasonable for the type of food they are serving you and it's a lovely location for brunch."}
{"text":"Really sad this place is shutting down. There was a huge selection of gluten-free, as well as regular waffle options. Not to mention, the wait staff were extremely friendly and accommodating when we were a bit overwhelmed by the selection.

Great spot, worth checking out before they close their doors."}
{"text":"I went here for brunch this morning with my family for my grandmother in laws last day here before she went back to England. Her only request was to have waffles and ice cream so I suggested starving artist knowing they specialize in waffles. 

We were 5 people in total and everybody loved the food. My step dad raved about the eggs Benedict and I got the smoked salmon (between waffles) my mom got the fully loaded (avocado instead of bacon, with potato waffles) and my grandmother in law got chocolate chip pancakes with a side of vanilla ice cream. My grandmother in law was so happy to find out that the ice cream was soft serve! And everyone's meal was delicious, my sister isn't a big eater so she got a bowl of fruit. Everybody was pleased with their meal and we were all planning our next trip here. 

While the food was delicious, the service itself was awful. Our waitress was cold and acted as though we were nothing but a bother to her the entire time, she never checked in during our meal and simply brought the check when nobody had asked for it. 

When we arrived none of the staff even looked at us or greeted us for about 15 minutes. A employee even walked by us to come in and didn't even bother to acknowledge us.

Besides the bad service, we all did love the food, I'd hope for next time that the service improves because otherwise it would have been a perfect time! 

Also, all the starving artist locations only accept cash. They are also specifically waffles, so the complaints about them only having waffles seems a bit silly to me."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and i decided to go to Starving Artist and try it. The waffles are AMAZING! Bacon waffles, potato waffles, grilled cheese waffle yes GRILLED CHEESE WAFFLE!!! We also tried the dessert waffles (diy) peanut butter, nutella, chocolate ice cream and the peanut butter, nutella, strawberry. Everything we ate was GREAT!! Also the bill was under $20 for all of this food. We will now be regulars at Starving Artist. Service was great and the music was on-point! Very easy to get to 2 blocks north of the subway. Highly recommend..."}
{"text":"Here we go; understaffed, Dirty table, 20 minute wait for menus, 10 minutes on top of that to take our orders, no cutlery provided with our appetizer (which we ate with our hands) discourteous staff,  Canned beans, over dressed salad, eggs overcooked,table syrup instead of real maple syrupand medicocre food.

Save your money"}
{"text":"I've only been here twice because it's out of the way for me, but I think of this place whenever I'm craving a potato waffle. Their benedicts always have the perfect poached eggs on top with just the right amount of hollandaise sauce. The only problem is that I find the potato waffle to be a bit too filling, but it's so delicious that I always finish the whole plate anyway! The baked beans and salad are wonderful as well. If you plan to go on a weekend, be prepared to wait 10-15 minutes (trust me, it's worth it)."}
{"text":"It was my second visit for brunch at Starving Artist. This place has always a line up, we had to wait about 40 minutes for a group of 3. People coming by 2 were placed faster. 

I ordered the waffle benedict and the peanut butter and banana waffle as a dessert. 

Food is good but nothing special, meaning if I wouldn't lose sleep if I'd never go back. The poached eggs are very well made. I just wish there was an option on the menu to replace the lettuce in the plate by something else (I didn't ask) as I am not much of green vegetables eaters and lettuce would have more a tendancy of ruining the meal than anything else for me. Price is fair, but for the dessert maybe two small waffle would be more fair ? :) 

As for the service, it wasn't fabulous, almost bad. I got my plate mixed up with my friend for the Waffle Benedict. I had the regular waffle, she had the potatoe waffle which caused me to eat a bit in the plate before realizing it. The waitress didn't mention it was the potatoe waffle when giving the plate. Also when they served the desert, they just put the plate on the table and I had to put it in front of me which is not great."}
{"text":"Just popped in on a Sunday morning to try this new place on Mt Pleasant. I had the Chicken Bacon Waffle sandwich (substituted the bacon for avocado). It's huge and comes with yummy assorted fresh fruit and berries and mixed greens. The chicken was surprisingly tender. It was a bit bland without the bacon but I dipped it in maple syrup and that worked well :) I only finished 1/2 and took the rest home. My friend had the B Benny and she devoured it. Service was friendly and prompt. Our food came quickly even though the place was packed and the line up was out the door and along the street. We only waited about 15 mins with about 3-4 parties ahead of us."}
{"text":"I used to be the biggest fan of Belgium waffles but after trying the potato waffles here, I may have to reconsider my favourite type of waffle.

Wait: Despite no one in front of us, we waited for 30 min before getting seated, and possibly another 15-20 min before our food. So yes, be prepared to wait.

Food: Starving Artist specializes in waffles, and you can definitely tell. I ordered the B. Benny and substituted bacon for avocado. The meal came with a side of greens and another side of your choice (I chose the fruit salad). With the balance of veggies, eggs and fruit I can almost convince myself that this meal is healthy! Again, potato waffles were the star of the show, while the eggs were perfectly poached. I also enjoyed their side salad very much for its light and tangy dressing.

Payment: Note - this place only takes cash!! Conveniently, they also have an in-house ATM but definitely avoid the transaction fees if you can."}
{"text":"Starving Artists delivers a real solid on the vegan, gluten-free waffles. To accompany them they provide real maple syrup(a must), a small salad and your choice of fruit, beans or something else I can't remember. 

I got the fruit but it was mostly honeydew mellon with some grapes and pineapple, of which I am not a fan. I regretted not getting the beans. Mmm, baked beans.

Back to the waffles, I was admittedly worried they would be dry, toaster pop type cardboard things, but they came out looking just the regular waffles. They are round, thick and moist through and through. They make the batter in house and it's a winner.

Try this place for brunch, it's in a strange place near a gelatin factory but you never have to wait for a table, parking is easy or walking from Lansdowne Station. I even spied well-behaved children dining there. Who knew that was possible?"}
{"text":"Came here on the Monday of a long weekend. We got a table without waiting, but the wait for food was around 45 minutes. To make matters worse, the kitchen is open-style, and we could see the three or four guys back there, making waffles, but mostly standing around talking. At one point I saw one of them eating while he was making food, which is a huge health department no-no and completely gross. 
There's nothing more annoying when you're hungry than watching the cooks standing around doing absolutely nothing. I presume they were waiting for waffles to cook - most inefficient system ever. Why in the world would a restaurant that serves mostly WAFFLES not be able to turn them out quicker? Absurd. They should take a lesson from Waffle House in the US, which by the way has much better food. 

The food arrived, and I was completely disappointed. Potato waffles tasted like they were made with powdered mashed potatoes, and they were mushy, heavy, and gross. They should be made with hash browns, which would be crispy and delicious. My poached eggs looked like they were made in a poacher in the microwave, as they were weirdly dome-shaped and completely unappetizing. Eggs that look like that are fine for my kitchen on a weekday morning, but not okay for a restaurant. Hey - I'm paying for you to cook for me, at least make the food look good. 
The side of bacon had only two slices. Cheap. 
I asked the server if the food always takes this long to arrive. He told me that Mondays aren't usually this busy. What sort of manager doesn't staff their brunch restaurant properly on the Monday of a long weekend?
Felt bad for the servers but they didn't even come by to apologize for the wait or ask if we wanted another coffee. They didn't seem fussed by the fact that the restaurant is such a s##tshow. 
There was a huge line in the rain when we left...I felt like telling everyone that the wait isn't worth it. I didn't. 
Poor. Will never, ever go back."}
{"text":"Words of my husband: \"Looks like everybody in here have kids or is pregnant...\" My thoughts while reading the menu: Not a healthy diet place.

They are in love with waffles and everything in the menu has them. Either you choose regular, gluten free, vegan, potato, or whatever, you'll see them in your plate. So don't go here if you don't like them.

We arrived while they still hadn't a waiting line, but when we left there was plenty of people sitting in the receiver waiting.

The service was ok. The waitress seemed to be under happy-active caffeine; kind of dancing while repeating the order. But even when she corrected my pronunciation of avocado, she ended asking me again what was what I wanted: tomato, tomatoe or avocado...

I liked the pictures of the washrooms because they are crossing legs like in an urgent situation to go...

The breakfast was meh. I ordered the B. Benny eggies with avocado instead of bacon, potato waffles, and potato salad.

Potatoes are my favourite veggie/root, so I can say that the waffles and salad were lacking consistency, seasoning, and charm. Kind of mushy, too dry for the morning (good luck I wasn't hang over). The eggs were ok. I just didn't like the dish as a whole."}
{"text":"\"We walked through the long room with an open kitchen on one side, which created a unique ambiance with the huffing and puffing waffle machines (five of them in total, waffles non-stop!). \"
\"However, our waitress' enthusiasm made up for the dark setting and our grumbles about the menu. One interesting option was Sub Your Waffles section: bacon could be changed by avocados or tomatoes, for example (which we tried).\"
\"Waffle Benny came in a shape of two round mini waffles with caramelized bacon (avocado in our edition) and plenty of Hollandaise sauce. We noticed a hint of vanilla sweetness from the waffle. It was fresh and soft besides that and appeared to have a touch of smokiness to it. A side of maple beans was also in interesting choice. \"
\"Starving Artist is a definite must if you love waffles with everything. Even if you do not, try out the desserts at least - worth it!\"

Just a few bites of our full review.."}
{"text":"Food is awesome. Great value.  Service was also excellent.  
My only issue with the Mount Pleasant location is music.  It was BLASTING the other day and made me not want to return.  I felt like I was at a club with horrible top 40 in my ear. 
I'm really hoping it's not like that all the time because otherwise I'd be back every week!"}
{"text":"We decided to go here as they do waffles..and they do good waffles. There potato waffles were to die for. Top it with eggs Benedict....yummm. My friend had the western waffle and could not finish it. We shared the s'mores waffle and it was like eating a s'mores!. The service was fine. Not great not bad, just fine. Be careful as we almost walked into the wrong cafe."}
{"text":"Doing the brunch rounds with friends and we came across Starving Artist. The location is small - so be prepared to wait, we came around 10 am and waited 15 for a table (not the worst) It is tight, but space around tables/chairs so you won't feel crammed as you dine. There is a tonne of waffles on the menu - it's their thing and the waffles are good. We tried the 'bacon waffles' which was the first time in the city Ive seen something like that. The price and the plating of the meals were good and overall no complaints about the meal. Everyone liked their dishes - but it just failed to win the \"best brunch\" ever category I've had at other locales. Worth a visit, but don't know if I would trek out there again!"}
{"text":"Disappointing! I had been there once before (about a year ago) and thought it was fine, so I felt fine about giving it another try. 

The restaurant is in desperate need of a facelift, and a huge cleaning in general. It feels dirty, everywhere. The table I sat at with my partner was a two top, painted black, and the edge where I was sitting was covered in black tape that was wearing away. So it felt slightly sticky and my sleeves would catch on it all the time. The table was also uneven so it was constantly shifting. It's these details that really irritate me, and it bothers me that no one in the restaurant has taken the time to pay attention to the details.

There are bits and pieces of debris all over the floors. The fish tank is freshwater, so algae builds up, and it clearly needs to have the water changed. It's not appetizing to eat while looking at a giant fish tank of dirty water. In my opinion the fish tank is not necessary and they should just get rid of it if they can't take care of it regularly.

From my seat, I was facing towards the front of the restaurant, and half of the dropped ceiling foam tiles are painted black, and half are white. The overall aesthetic is dark and dingy and unfinished looking. We were sitting under the black ceiling tile area, and it really makes you feel like you're stuffed at the back of the restaurant without lights - and we were there for brunch, arguably the brightest time of day.

I had a cappuccino, which was the best part of the meal. I ordered cinnamon french toast waffles. They were cold when they arrived, and didn't have any syrup on them, which is fine - except I then had to wait for the server to bring syrup. I realized that it was fake syrup in a real syrup bottle (they should disclose that up front for allergy reasons) and then had to wait for the smaller real syrup container to arrive. It was about 7 minutes later that I finally was able to take a bite. My partner was well into his breakfast by then.

The waffles were very eggy, and it didn't help that they were cold. The fruit was decent quality, but the greens were a little too wilted for my liking. 

The server was not enjoying herself. There was a serious lack of table-side manner, in the way that she would plunk everything down on the table, and never smiling. She did comp the real maple syrup (normally they charge for it) so that was nice. 

This place feels like it's struggling. Hopefully someone can get it back on track! As we were leaving there were a couple people I overheard who were excited to eat there, and eat there frequently. I don't understand how this is appealing based on the state of the restaurant... They must tune it out, or else you'd lose your appetite like I did."}
{"text":"Great little place. Only been here on Sunday morning and there is always a line out the door. The potato waffles and the dill walls are excellent. A must try. The Benny is my favorite. Americano was good as well as the vanilla latte. Last time we had a party of 9 and they were able to accommodate us on the back patio. We had it to ourselves. Aside from a couple of wasps it was perfect. Get here soon. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Pretty darn Good.  Great atmosphere/building, kinda hipsterish.  Definitely lineups on sundays.  Food is always pretty decent, they could be more generous with portions, but the food itself (eggs benny) is fabulous, as long as the sides.  You can generally expect a pretty good breakfast from this place. a consistent 7.5/or 8 out of 10.  sometimes the service is a tad slow, but they waitresses are down to earth and well humoured.  I feel like for such a big space, they could probably add more tables.  But hey, that's just my opinion :) Bon appetite."}
{"text":"Starving Artist is definitely my favourite brunch spot in the city.  The potato waffles are so good.  I definitely highly recommend.  They offer gluten free items also which is always a plus.  The wait is sometimes long but it is definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"So, I will precursor this by saying perhaps I ordered wrong. I went in for brunch and though I would be clever and do the old \"split/split\" with my friend so we could try a couple things out. A pro resto move. We ordered the Monte Cristo, and the Club. I says to Mable I says, \"I've have never heard of a club sandwich on waffles...\". Well I believe there is a reason for that. Fried chicken & waffles this was not. I commend the effort of blending all meals of the day into one all encompassing meal, but it just didn't taste good. 

I did like the potato salad however. I enjoy it so much that I also buy the same tub from Costco. Maybe I have seen the chef there.... 

Sadly, I will be back as sometimes there is a line at Whippoorwill but if I do not make a better ordering choice I will look as happy as those poor fish in the fish tank. On the plus side, there are board games."}
{"text":"Yummy if you like waffles. Staff was super nice as well. I wish my poached eggs were a little more runny, but other than that it was good

I sure appreciate a savoury waffle"}
{"text":"This is my second visit and the food was as good as it was on my first 

I agree with a lot of comments that the service is slow, waited way longer than expected for our food 

Ordered tea- no milk came - come on I'm from the uk .... Lucky I don't kill you for giving tea with no milk 

Got water for the table. Glass sent back as it was dirty

The area itself is needing some tlc as its looking worn and dirty 

Positives - the food, why you come really isn't it ..... Brilliant portions and tastes amazing! So fresh
Potato waffle was warm and fluffy 

If you're passing try his place, not worth going out your way however"}
{"text":"Waffles, waffles, and waffles. It's a pretty neat concept. Every item on the menu has a waffle in it.

Came here for brunch on Saturday to catch up with a friend from out of town. We met at 9:30, which was a good decision on the part of the organizer as by 10:30, the place had a long line.

I had the B. Benny (poached eggs on potato waffles and hollandaise sauce), which was okay. Nothing to write home about. Reasonably priced for a pretty good portion, you also have the options of sides. I went for the fruit salad. 

Service was not that great. Management at Starving Artist should maybe invest more time in training their servers. It wasn't that loud, but I couldn't hear our servers at all. I had to ask a number of times for the staff here to speak a little louder. Also, it was a little annoying after we had 5 servers come to our table asking the exact same question. 

Anyway, this area is not close to where I live nor is it my usual stomping ground. I'm okay not returning as my experience here was simply put - meh. 

Good for: brunch"}
{"text":"A CASH ONLY establishment is simply not acceptable in 2018. The food here is average, the service is average, the prices are somewhat ABOVE average, and the only payment option is cash. A tab for 2 people can easily surpass $50, an amount which should be capable of payment by card, whether debit or credit. 

A message to the owner: put your customers first by offering them the only modern and convenient way to settle their bills - by card. It's not cool to pass what should be your cost of running a business onto your customers by forcing them to withdraw cash at fee-based ATM machines in order to support your restaurant. 

For this reason alone, I will not return."}
{"text":"First time here, loved the food and the milk shakes, but the waiter  ! male !  we got was super rude and gave us a really bad service. Not sure if coming back. One start because  of the service but food would have got 4 if everything went well."}
{"text":"Whilst apartment hunting a few months ago (and in a decrepit hung over state) my friends and I decided to stop in here for coffee. We stepped up through the cramped doorway into the bustling little restaurant that smelled like a mother's kitchen. We were led through the laughing crowds of people towards the back where there was a little table adjacent to the turn tables.

The waitress came to take our orders, we explained we were only getting coffee. She asked us, \"Have you ever been here before?\" We all shook our heads, smiling, no. She explained to us that everything on the menu was served on waffles, and my eyes light up. In high school, I had a guilty pleasure that involved making chocolate chip pancakes really late at night, and this fascination did and does stem towards all kinds of breakfast goodies, including french toast and waffles. But I hadn't indulged in a normal pancake, let alone waffle, in quite some time as I had been vegan for a few years, and then found out I had a gluten-sensitivity, which really made it impossible to have waffles or any such thing. But then as we're looking over the menu, I see something that almost causes my eyes to burst out of my skull. \"They have GLUTEN-FREE, VEGAN waffles here!\" I exclaim excitedly. I was too hung over on that occasion and in need of leafy greens to indulge in the new discovery, but my friend did order the waffle grilled cheese which looked amazing.

Upon moving into that same area only a month or so later, I remembered the adorable little restaurant that incorporated all of my favourite things into one space: art, gluten-free indulgences, vegan-friendly eats, and of course, waffles. I decided we all needed to go. It wasn't nearly as busy as the first time I had stepped into the space, and so we were told to sit wherever we'd like, and we picked a corner spot on the backyard patio. One of the co-owners, as we'd come to know (and recognizable from the picture on the business card), served us. Toby is incredibly charismatic and charming. He knows how to work well with customers. He gave us the run-down on the place, and throughout the course of my many visits thus far to Starving Artist, I have learned much more about the restaurant. Toby started the restaurant with his partner Brian in an effort to provide an artistic spot for artists and the community alike. It's an artist-friendly spot, with art lining the walls (photographs, taken by Toby), and they're also really excellent at providing a spot for musicians to perform (anything from acoustic shows, to jazz nights). There is a heavy focus on hip hop music at Starving Artist, and they constantly have a specific hip hop radio station playing over the speakers (Toby told me which one it was, but I have since forgotten). There are also regular events, such as hip hop nights, or nights when various DJs play the place. It's an interesting idea, and I see what they're trying to do. 

I ordered one of the dessert waffles, requesting the vegan/gluten-free waffles. At that time, I was not vegan (I have since converted back), and thus ordered one of the blueberry dessert waffles with ice cream. Our breakfasts arrived and my waffles were not crispy chip-like things that crumbled into dust when you consumed them, as I had kind of suspected. Nor are they the store-bought gluten-free waffles available at most grocery stores. They are real in-house made gluten-free, vegan, puffy, soft waffles. This place is the real deal. I smothered the waffles loaded with blueberries, blueberry sauce, whipped cream, and ice cream with maple syrup and cut away a corner to try. The waffle squished between my teeth like moist bread pudding. There is a slightly different consistency to the gluten-free waffles, which is to be expected, but it is not unlikeable, and it does not turn me off. Furthermore, the presentation of the waffle boats (the desserts) and the other breakfasts is gorgeous. The plates are always piled high, clean around the edges of the various servings, and little touches like intricately cut strawberries add a pretty touch to the meals.

I have come to love Starving Artist. I have yet to attend a hip hop night, but it is on my list of to-dos this summer. Now, I too can indulge in Toronto's favourite daily past-time, brunch."}
{"text":"We've tried....5 or 6 times we've tried.....this was it though, the final straw....and really, the food isn't even that good. 

There's bad service and then there's the Starving Artist. One slow-moving waitress and even slower-moving cook....tables going un-cleared for 20 minutes...being seated at a table with a highchair covered in scrambled eggs and the server leaving the high chair for us to enjoy...my wife asking for milk for her coffee three times only for me to get up and get it

I can actually look past a few of those things....however, when the food takes 45 minutes (for waffles and eggs) and tables that sit down after you get their food before you; and when you have to go because y'know, you have somewhere to be (and you didn't think waffles and eggs was going to take an hour) so you tell the waitress to cancel your order....and her response is \"sure just pay for the coffee\"....THAT\"S when I finally lost my temper, as she sarcastically said \"have a nice day sir\"

And really, the food isn't all the good

Go to Sunnyside Grill down the street, just west of Dufferin....good food, nice people...a much better place than this hole"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite go-to brunch spots in Toronto. It used to be a well kept secret a few years ago but has recently gained a massive following (made obvious by the hour long line ups on weekends). 

Line-ups aside, I love this place. Even if you are not a waffle fan (which I wasn't either), you will LOVE their brunch menu. Everything is made from their traditional waffles or potato waffles. Eggs bennie- on waffles. Tex-mex style sandwich- between two waffles. My fav is their eggs bennie with potato waffles. It comes with a nice green salad on the side.

For a little treat to share- try the S'mores waffle. They actually toast the marshmellows on top of a gooey, chocolatey, delicious mess of a mini-waffle! Yum!"}
{"text":"Very mediocre food. The 6 of us ordered different meals and not one of us finished our order. Just very bland, over hyped, \"Instagramable\" food. Save yourself."}
{"text":"Saw this place on the show You Gotta eat Here when we woke up this morning and decided to get up and try this place out.  We had the waffle bacon  and the waffle Benny.  Delicious! Ordered americano for $3 and you can get a refill for $1. Place is not too pricey.  Staff are so nice!  Fyi, this is a cash only place. Will come back with the kids."}
{"text":"Easily one of the best places for brunch. After hearing from many of my friends I went. I dined. And oh my was it worth it. 

The coffee is fantastic. The food is fantastic. I mean it says it all. We each had the eggs Benny with potato waffles. THIS IS A MUST! The waffles are literally soft, creamy and tasty. The eggs and hollandaise were equally tasty, but I am telling you it is worth it. 

The servers were running around like crazy, with no one to help but each other. The poor guy at the front looked like he was ready to have his head chopped off with everything that was happening. Definitely overwhelmed by how busy it was, which I don't think should be a surprise considering that there is yellow tape that says 'wait in this line', obviously indicating that line ups are common. We had the female server in the back who was very pleasant, and a bit more calm. 

Adding another server to help with the service could benefit greatly, both with table service and overall general flow. It's bad when you have enough tables open up for the people waiting in line (who can see these empty tables) but no one to clean them."}
{"text":"I cancelled my order and walked out because of the way they were prepared the food. No gloves, No Apron. Dishing out the plates with no gloves. Touching smoked Salmon with bare hands and then fruits and vegetables. Cleaning their hands with the back of their Jeans. So disgusting! I told our host about all these, she didn't even apologize and charged me for the tea and coffee. 
I'm not sure how they are still operate with this poor condition. 
Definitely 0 star."}
{"text":"3 words. RUDEST HOSTESS EVER. 
Not the best move considering you're NEW and trying to establish yourself in the St.Clair west community. Based on her rudeness alone I would not return, but may have been willing to give it a second chance if the food was good. It wasn't. Far better in the area.

Lose the tude, may help you last a while."}
{"text":"We tried this place for the first time today with no idea what to expect. The first thing we noticed when we walked in was the loud EDM music. We were the first customers of the day so were seated and seen to within minutes. We had some questions about the menu, and our waiter wasn't able to answer them all, so we placed our orders hoping for the best.

Only espresso drinks are served, so there's no bottomless drip coffee available. They had ordinary table syrup on the table, but for about $2 per ounce you can get the real thing. The waffles were piping hot, delicious and filling. The fruit and salads were fresh and generously served. The starter waffles are small and round and good for smaller appetites. The entree waffles are large and square and better for hungrier types.

We paid $65 for 4 people. There is a tip jar at the cash so your tip doesn't go directly to the server. It is a cash only operation, so they have an ATM with a $2 fee to use.

Our less-than-stellar rating is based on the fact that the server didn't know the menu that well and couldn't understand our questions; it was too early in the morning for loud dance music; and our distaste for having to pay an ATM fee because the restaurant doesn't want to incur POP technology costs, or avoid paying taxes.

Unless we're jonesing bad for some waffles we'll be brunching at Hazel's Diner only from here on in."}
{"text":"Their eggs Benedict are what happy dreams are made of, to say they are incredible is an understatement.  The caramelized bacon along with a slightly sweet waffle totally set you up for the best eggs Benedict of a lifetime.  I've gone many times but despite how delicious other items look, can't chance missing an opportunity to have the best eggs Benedict of my life.  Coffee is also tasty.  Service is efficient.  Lines get long on weekends, best get up early to miss the rush - it's worth it!"}
{"text":"We were told we have to wait for 10-15 min to be seated for brunch. It took 30 min. We ordered drink and we're ready to order food as well but the server said she has to figure out a few things and come back to take order! 5 min later she took the rest of the order. We waited for 15 min to have our coffee and another 40 min to have the food. I cut my benny and the server showed up with another dish from the sidewalk next to patio and said that she had given me the wrong dish and changed it. No apologies at all, no smiles, no hospitality. What is going on in this place?!"}
{"text":"first time here we saw the line up and just walked the other way. holy moly
second time it was rainly also just about 930 am - we got a seat right away!

Potato waffle is the selling point here - so we got two dishes both involving these. they are.. ok. a bit too salty and pretty heavy in the end. I may have even liked/preferred my egg Benedict on regular waffles.

a bit too much about the hype - interesting potato waffles, worth trying once."}
{"text":"I came back here on a very hot day of summer and was very displeased to see (or rather, feel) that there was no air-conditioning. It was a very uncomfortable experience. And despite a nice wide open space good for bigger groups their kitchen is small so everyone's meals come out staggered... One's food would get cold if one were going to be polite and wait for the whole table's food to arrive."}
{"text":"Great brunch spot. Seems like less food visually; however those mini potato waffles are yummy and filling.

I got the spicy chicken with potato waffles instead of the jalapeño ones and it was a good sub. 

My only issue was there was very little salsa for the amount of waffle and toppings. So was dry after first few bites suggest asking for more salsa"}
{"text":"While eating a savoury waffle based benny it's integral to have three things:

- A movie background (in my case, lucky me, Ghostbusters)
- An aquarium stocked with koi (huh?)
- A benny with caramelized bacon and potato waffles

While the coffee choice left something to be desired and some of the fruit that I chose as my side had seen better and fresher days, I'd still give this a thumbs up. It's just tough to beat a benny with runny yolks and a tasty hollandaise. 

I'm pretty certain that Torontonians like waffles, and I do believe Starving Artist proves just that. I'm happy to announce that I too don't waffle on waffles. 

25/30: 30 Day Challenge"}
{"text":"Oh how I want to give a more positive review!  I love the concept of Starving Artist, I love the look, I love the vibe, I even love the menu...

But every visit has brought with it things that just irk me!

Potato waffles?  Great concept, poor execution.  Kinda crumbly and dry, and not worth the novelty.

Waffles Benny?  Would have been tasty were it not for the runny, almost-but-not-quite cooked egg whites.  Big turn off!

Mediocre nachos?  Well, they're mediocre nachos -- the very definition of 2 star!

Factor in the often incredibly long waits -- that persists after you've been seated and ordered -- and I just have a hard time really recommending them to others.

Does this mean I won't be back myself?  Oh, no, I'm sure I'll be back... there's something about the place that just draws me in.

On a positive note, let me add the following:

Projector of old D movies (at night) and classic saturday morning cartoons (Smurfs!) in the morning makes for a very cool backdrop to a meal/drink/whatever.

And, finally, their blueberry outmeal smoothie is ridiculous.  Ridiculously good!"}
{"text":"I know people love this place, but I just can't get behind it. This was my third visit, but my first to this location, and my first attempt a lunch.
We got the BLT on gluten free waffles. Much to my dismay, Starving Artist doesn't have a \"neutral\" gluten free waffle. So the only options are banana waffles or potato waffles. Potato made sense but the server assured us that the banana waffle was what most people did and that it worked. It really doesn't work. Add to that chewy bacon, a side salad that was simply greens with no dressing, and a side of fruit that included a grapefruit that was well past its prime and it was just an unfortunate experience all around.
I don't understand why they don't just serve a regular GF waffle. Amazing recipes exist (and I have a GF/vegan recipe I'd share if they need one).
The experience may have been okay if we'd ordered breakfast waffles, but my other two visits were for breakfast and weren't much better - I think we're done trying SA. We'll keep going to Boom next door instead. 
Also, the final nail in the coffin is the cash only policy. Cash only is one this if you're selling coffee and pastry but being a sit down restaurant with a cash only policy and pointing people to an ATM that charges high fees shows a clear disrespect of customers. This would have been a deal-breaker except that my son had his heart set on GF waffles and I had nowhere else to turn."}
{"text":"Two words: potato waffles. They are heaven! I never want to eat another savory waffle any other way! 

I got the smoked salmon with dill potato waffles and my friend got the spicy chicken with potato waffles as well. She commented that her waffles were a little soggy but they were pretty loaded with toppings - there was a generous amount of saucy chicken, salsa and guac! Any kind of waffle would have been soggy. My waffles were loaded with cream cheese and smoked salmon, which is more than I can say for a lot of other brunch spots who give you a tiny layer of cream cheese and 2 pieces of smoked salmon. The dishes also came with a house salad and the option of fresh fruit, potato salad or beans. I opted for the fresh fruit which was fresh and delicious and my friend got the potato salad. In hindsight, with the potato waffles, it was a lot of potato for one sitting so she did regret that order. Additionally it was a tad sweet when I tried it but I have a salty tooth rather than a sweet tooth. I also got the mimosa, which comes with half a cup of OJ and a whole mini bottle of sparkling wine.. all for a whopping $7.50! I've paid $10 for a mimosa at other places and received half of what I got at Starving Artist so this is a winner in my books! My friend got peppermint tea that came out in an equally large cup (hooray for less refills!). 

I'm still dreaming about those potato waffles and will be back soon to try the other delectable waffle combinations on the menu! We got there at 11 and were seated promptly. I noticed the rush came at around 12ish so it's best to come early or later at around 2pm - we left at around that time and there were a number of tables free."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would!! When we put our name down for a table we were told 10-15 mins, after around 1 hour and 15 minutes we were finally sat without any apology for the wait! We ordered instantly after having plenty time to look at the menu, then came another long wait for our food! 
We ordered coffees which were very disappointing and served by someone who couldn't even carry a tray without shaking and using both hands.
I ordered the grilled cheese waffle with added tomato and ham and it was extremely meh, the waffle was fine but the cheese was obviously processed garbage accompanied by two slices of regular tomato that cost 2$ to add, and the ham was so thin I couldn't even taste it! Our water bottle was never re-filled nor were we asked how everything was or if we needed anything else! Basically everything at this place was terrible, the service, the drinks, and the food...will never go back!"}
{"text":"Came here for a late brunch on Sunday around 1pm for a table of 3 it only took less than a 10 minute wait for a table. All the tables were full but they clean them up pretty fast. The volume in the restaurant is very LOUD almost uncomfortably loud, with everyone talking, open kitchen and bar even though the space itself is big. Service was prompt and friendly, but nothing amazing. It's brightly light with a lot of windows and there were plenty of families. 

Their coffee is strong. I got the eggs Benny with potato waffles. Sooo good! The potato waffles were like mashed potatoes grilled on a waffle iron, super fluffy on the inside with a light crisp outside. The eggs were runny and the bacon wasn't too salty. With hollandaise sauce it was $15, with a large side of salad and fruit. The serving was very large and I was really full after!"}
{"text":"Aww, so disappointed.  I suffered many hardships to get to this restaurant! There was drizzle outside, it was cold, I saw a rat jump in front of the subway train. But I got there and ordered the fully loaded and waffle bacon.  I saw that it was cash only with an ATM in store. Brutal! What a careless cash grab.  I've been to the Lansdowne Starving Artist many times and they're one of the few restaurants that have a good presentation of food but THIS one does not give a fudge.  The staff were friendly and I think they were making an effort but it still just does not compare to the original Starving Artist. 

The potato waffles were so gritty, dry and overdone in spots and disproportionate to each other.  The waffle bacon had so little bacon and seemed lesser and they forgot my maple syrup.  The place is beautiful though but it's just a shame, none of it tasted as good as the original SA.  I wanted to love this location, breaks my heart. 3 stars!"}
{"text":"**ok so i'm editing this and upping my star because I actually had their ceaser and it was delicious & so spicy. that's the only yummy thing though. 

Every time I come here I ask myself why I got dragged into this mess. Every. Time.

The last time I went, there was only two of us. It was a Sunday, but it seriously wasn't that busy and there were many open tables. We got seated quickly, but that was it. 
It seriously took 15 mins just to get asked what we wanted to drink. At that point we were ready to order too. I got the almond latte and a little $5 dessert waffle. 

Can someone tell me how it takes over half an hour to make a waffle and throw some syrup and fruit onto it?? When the place is like half empty?

Idk, every time I come there the food makes me sick. What kind of combination is waffles, salad greens and potato salad for breakfast ugh. I'd rather go to boom and that makes me nauseated too.

you truly do feel like a starving artist here"}
{"text":"I just discovered the Starving Artist this week and I wish I hadn't. Why? Because how am I NOT gonna get breakfast here? They've got caramelized bacon! I never knew bacon could be so sweet and tender, unlike the salty over-cooked edges of a subway breakfast sandwich.  And if you get the hitchiker meal, you're in for a big ol' delicious treat. It's only $11 and you can watch the goldfish aquarium as you eat.  Two of the goldfish completed their bowel movements as I ate my cheesy scrambled eggs; it was great cuz there was a big slow black fish at the bottom, eating whatever dropped out the goldfish.  I also have to warn of hipster shenanigans.  For the most part, you can ignore it, but I don't know how hardcore these hipsters get at peak hours; they're a very strange people.  The food came quickly, we were in and out in 40 mins and it was a big meal, I must reiterate. This is a great place for watching big fish push out excrement and its also a great breakfast spot! 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I went here for brunch this past sunday.

The waffles were awesome.  Light, fluffy, moist on the inside, slightly crisp on the exterior.

The bacon waffles, dipped in maple syrup, were quite enjoyable.

The eggs benny (poached eggs with caramelized bacon, atop the aforementioned awesome waffles, covered in hollandaise sauce) were amazingly well-balanced, no one element dominated, the flavors and textures were in harmony.  The relative quantities were also perfect: there was just the right amount of waffle to soak up all the hollandaise and egg-yolk, no more, no less!  And amazingly, despite the ingredients involved, the dish felt light overall--not at all heavy.

The strawberry craze waffles were great (though not as exceptional).  Despite being a little bit soggy from all the whipped cream, strawberry jam, and strawberry sauce, they were still very satisfying.  More importantly, they were neither too sweet, nor too heavy; just right!

I also had a chai latte (which I suspect was sweetened with honey):  nothing special, but nevertheless pleasant.

Service was attentive and understanding.

I don't typically like \"brunch,\" but I may have a soft spot for good waffles...  and for good waffles with bacon hidden in them!"}
{"text":"Chilled on the patio with some friends one Sunday afternoon and joined them after their brunch.  Wish they had some shade for the table.  The service was slow and server forgot most of our orders, in spite of us being a group of three and we only ordered drinks (!).  Luckily, they also forgot to charge us for stuff, as well. 

They are cash only, which is mildly annoying, tho not the end of the world."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best brunch places I have been to! It's small so try and get there early so you do t have to wait for a table, we got there 10:30 and were fine! We got the Waffle Benny with potato waffles which was amazing! The waffles complemented the flavor immensely. Our waiter was great and very attentive to our needs as well. I am already trying to plan out when to go next."}
{"text":"Heard about the place through Yelp and thought I'd give it a try. Sad to say very disappointed. Waffles and coffee excellent however they paid very little attention to the filling in the Breakwich waffle and customer service 1/10. Why would you serve processed cheese slices and charge for baked beams out of a can? Serving canned beans in a white ramekin doesn't justify the side order. The egg was not well done and there was some white sauce in there they never mentioned. I expressed I can't do mayo, I checked before ordering. Still don't know what the white sauce was. To top it off, my meal was served and no cutlery or napkin to go with this? I sat around patiently and waited and waited for about 5-10min, the waitress was backed up I suppose. Finally I had to get up and go to the counter to request cutlery to eat my meal. The waitress said she will be over. Then the wi-fi, they state the password is starvingartist the \"i\" just once? Five minutes later after several trials  I explain I cannot connect to wi-fi, and the waitress says oh the \"I\" is replaced with the \"number one\" she meant the \"i\" just \"1's\", like seriously? At this point I was ready to leave, lo and behold she offers me the bill and disappears for ten min. I sit around and finally get up again and go to the counter to pay. Will I come back here? Nope! Will I recommend the place? Nope. They need to be more courteous to \"single\" people that drop by as opposed to groups or couples. They need to be more transparent about sauces on the breakwich. Their price point is too high for food served from a can ie: baked beans and processed cheddar cheese slices  you can buy in a grocery store!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. We waited in line for 15 minutes and were totally ignored by staff. There were a half dozen empty tables, but no one was being seated. I finally caught a staff person's attention and asked for a table, and were seated at a table by the washrooms. When I asked if we could sit at one of the other 5 empty tables, the waitress said no, they were saving them for larger groups. It was sweltering hot in the restaurant - clearly the A/C was also not working properly. So we walked out. Went next door to Boom Breakfast where someone immediately greeted us, sat us at a very well air conditioned booth, and served us coffee and water immediately. Go to Boom Breakfast instead."}
{"text":"This place has perfected the art of waffle making. I never really enjoyed waffles but this place has changed my mind. The service was quick and pleasant. The food was so tasty. It has an open kitchen concept. They serve great coffee in a french press. The breakfast benny was absolutely delicious. The best part was the potato waffles. The decor is not the most updated but with their food you wouldn't even notice. I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I want to give my review of Starving Artist more stars but I can't and I'll tell you why.
I was so excited to have gluten free waffles for brunch and got even more excited when I saw the menu and noticed I could get eggs Benedict on waffles...or not. 
While Starving Artist makes amazing gluten-free/vegan waffles, their hollandaise (which is on most menu items) is not gluten free! I was honestly surprised to see that they would take the time to make GF waffles but couldn't be bothered to make GF hollandaise. I was definitely disappointed, but overall the food was still great and very fresh!"}
{"text":"Waited one hour for my food.  One guy in the kitchen and 20 people inside.  Not just once but the three times i went there i waited at least an hour.  It is unacceptable.  Especially for breakfast.  Staff are not trained properly, i had to keep going to the bar to order.  They charge for hot sauce, who charges for hot sauce?  Its cheap hot sauce you can find at dollarama.  Food is good, lattes are good, soy option, gluten free options.  Owner needs to hire more staff in the kitchen.  I WONT BE COMING BACK."}
{"text":"I was beyond excited to try out the famous Starving Artist, I was reassured by many that this resto is worth its weight in gold. Well it did and didn't disappoint. Me and my companion arrived around 2 ish on New Years Day craving a hearty breakfast. We didn't quite anticipate the hearty line outside it's doors. 

After about 20 min of trying to figure out another place to eat the line slowly dissipated and we decided to join. Enter our lovely hostess, a woman who had the demeanor of a cranky old retiree. I didn't think people actually existed like this outside of quirky sitcoms. She was pretty \"direct\" (bordering rude) and said that the wait would be about 30 min.

 I can't imagine the type of privileged brats that she encounters on the regular, but what irritated me the most was the blatant lies she spewed to patrons who decided to join the line after us. She declared that poached eggs and hollandaise sauce would not be served after 3 pm. It was nearing 2:40 (panic now setting in) so I was wondering what the hell else was left on the menu that I could eat? We stood our ground since we were the next people in line to be seated. 

As patrons kept exiting the restaurants, we were again annoyed by the fact the group behind us was seated first because they we're a table of 4 and our table of 2 I guess didn't add up to more tips? Hungry, cranky, and just overall irritated more patrons left yet we weren't seated. Did the hostess not think we could count?! There were enough seats for us and the people behind us; however, since it was nearing 3 pm and almost closing the hostess didn't want another line to accumulate so we were kept waiting to deter others from joining the line. Hence the no hollandaise & poached eggs tactic. 

As we were finally seated after 3 pm, our lovely waitress was glad enough to accommodate our eggs benny request. She was probably the best thing about that place. Very informative and just overall nice! Seriously is that so hard to come by nowadays?! Our eggs benny arrived on a potato waffle probably about 30 min later. They seemed to have a problem with keeping up with the orders because most people didn't have food on their tables. 

FOOD REVIEW: 

The potato waffle was VERY salty. I was actually quite disappointed because it seemed like someone accidentally knocked over the salt shaker into the batter. Now judging from the reviews it doesn't appear like that is the norm, so maybe they had an off day. The poached eggs and hollandaise sauce was pretty much the norm. The standout item would have been the beans and potato salad. 

I think their spin on the waffle for breakfast is very cute and innovative for Toronto. But overall it's just okay and it wasn't worth the wait. I mean I can do what they did in my own home with a waffle maker. Although I'd give it another shot with a normal waffle and not a potato one. Can you really ever justify being in a restaurant for 2 hours and within that time frame less than 30 min is spent eating a meal? My love hate relationship with brunch in the city continues.

PS. Feed your damn fish and clean the fish tank!!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch with my friends on Family Day. We arrived at around 10:30am and the place was already pretty full. They do not take reservations, so if you're coming with a largish party (would not recommend for more than 6 people), you should aim to arrive early in the morning, especially during the weekend. There was a line-up out the door around noon.

We ordered coffee to start and all of the lattes were a hit. They also came really fast. We waited around half an hour for the food to arrive though. The waffles were delicious! They were cooked perfectly, crunchy exterior and soft interior. My boyfriend and I both enjoyed the B. Benny immensely, made using potato waffles, which was really unique and tasty. We didn't feel like the Monte Cristo was anything too special, but our friends loved the Spicy Chicken.

The mains come with a choice of sides: salad and fruit, potato salad or beans. The beans were REALLY sweet, basically drenched in syrup, which wasn't really our thing. The potato salad was great though, and the fruit sides are very generous.

Everything was extremely filling, so if coming with a date, I would recommend ordering one main to share and then getting a dessert \"after waffle\" or the Bacon Waffle to start.

Our server was also extremely nice, but he was definitely over-worked, so unfortunately, I took one star off for the long wait for our food to arrive. Great food nevertheless and a fun ambiance."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting any starving artist location. From pictures that I have seen online this is the smaller location. 

I visited on a Saturday around noon the wait was about 15 minutes not too long they give you the menus while you're in line so you can think of what you want to order before you sit down. They don't have any lemon or lime so you can order water with lemon or hot water with lemon cuz they don't have any lemon or lime for some reason they serve their hot drinks in glasses and then put a sleeve over it there is no mugs so that was a little weird too.

The food took a short amount of time too, it came out really quickly it was amazing I got egg Benedicts with salmon everything was so flavorful so fresh I would definitely go back one thing to remember this is a cash-only place"}
{"text":"Bad service. Scratch that, TERRIBLE service. Waited 45 minutes without receiving water or coffee, and the place was empty. Waitress (WHO DIDN'T SERVE US) swore at us as we left. So rude, never returning."}
{"text":"Have visited three times and each time the wait has been extraordinarily long and the orders have been messed up. For a place so large and has been in business for so long, they really need to get their payment situation sorted - it's currently cash only. The poached eggs are made in some kind of mold. It's brutally tacky for what they're charging. Other than that, the food is tasty when it finally arrives. Place needs to get it together, as it stands I won't visit again."}
{"text":"has the cutest most scrumptious little waffles! one of my go to places usually if i'm up for brunch last minute - wait isn't too bad, but i usually got after noon and to the college location. usually get the smoked salmon waffles. change the waffle to the POTATOE WAFFLE! it's an addiction. literally the fluffiest softest thing ever, imagine mashed potatoes but in a waffle, always so satisfied! also, very reasonably priced, so that's a plus!"}
{"text":"Oh I'm starving... for a better service model.

I don't deny the relative goodness of Starving Artist's waffle meals on top of waffles, stacked on waffled, cooked in a waffle maker and served with a side of waffles insanity. But the service here (at least at this original St Clair location; dunno about the other ones) is a waffle grid of a hot mess.

The aesthetical vibe I got of the place was as if the brunch sketches in various Portlandia episodes had a waffle-making one night stand with an Ikea restaurant, and Starving Artist was the result. The tables sure enough were from Ikea, but were serviced by young hip staff, and the walls were mostly cladded with waffle-themed pop art. Vintage gumball machines dispenses coffee beans. Washrooms are located on the main floor, with one accessible stall.

Service however needs a complete overhaul. How bout I give a gaming walkthrough of the experience:

LEVEL ONE: You enter the premises and now shall stand around waiting with others... for what? Press A now to leave. The barista does her own thing and ignores the stream of walk-ins. There's a living room-like area for coffee suckers, but is mostly occupied by awaiting diners sitting on sofas with busted springs, as they flip through the menu and take selfies. Have a seat if you can, press B regularly to keep waiting until a passing waitress in between clearing tables a few minutes in acknowledges your existence.

LEVEL TWO: You have made it to a table of waffle doom! Surround yourself with a mix of dining hipsters and foodies, lunching families, and punks sipping on coffee like gentlemen. The server for your table turns to you, and--PRESS A QUICKLY NOW TO MAKE AN ORDER!--oh, sorry, ADHD distraction kicks in and she turns to an adjacent table for an inquiry. Uh, hello?

LEVEL THREE: Having slayed the evil waffle boss and saved your stomach from eternal hunger, you line up by the cash to pay, because you will learn they are too cool to give you a bill at the table like traditional restos do. Press B to use the ATM; this level is cash only. The cash girl flips through a stack of orders to find yours as she asked what you had.

Not impressed. This method of paying up front and nobody knows what you had and you have to tell them (for I know I could be paying for somebody else's meal, or better yet not pay at all), is the apex of ridiculous inefficiencies of the ways this west end Toronto's waffle house chain (at least this location) does things and conducts service, which may leave you literally #starving4waffles. I wouldn't go back here unless they completely revamp the way things work.

{TTC (this location): 512 it to Northcliffe Blvd., or walk a couple short blocks east from Dufferin St. if you are using the 29 'Sufferin'}"}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast with my boyfriend. It was his first time and he loved it. I've been here a time or two. Friendly staff (always) and their menu is great. I got \"The Breakfast\"...their potato waffles are amazing and my boyfriend had the 'In Between Chicken and Bacon\" sandwich. Go in with an appetite. I only gave it four stars because my poached eggs were just a tad overdone. Other than that it's a great place to go to."}
{"text":"New to the neighborhood. 
Very nice interior and menu. Friendly atmosphere. Waffle sandwich for today's lunch. 
Remember cash only."}
{"text":"I came here with some friends on the weekend - this is their new location on St. Clair W.  It's kid friendly and pretty big on the inside (I believe it can seat 60) and there is a patio (not open yet) to the side of the restaurant.  

It's mainly a waffle place so if you don't particularly care for waffles then you probably should go elsewhere.  they don't take reservations but since we went for 9:30am we didn't have too much trouble getting a table (they also have high chairs for kids).  When we left there was a line up however - around 10:45am.

I don't particularly like sweet things so I was happy to discover the Cheese and Chives waffles - comes with a  side of green salad and assorted fruit.  Was it the best waffle I've eaten - no.  But with the melted cheese, salsa, sour cream it lent a savoury flair to the dish.  I also ordered chai tea - for some reason it came out in a very tall glass....with a very short spoon...so to stir the milk in was a bit awkward.

The service was friendly and while I've read other comments saying they had slow service, we didn't.  Fluke or not I was happy with it.  They only take cash here so keep that in mind - I didn't know that but luckily there is a ATM machine in the restaurant."}
{"text":"I love Starving Artist. The Waffle Benny is THE BEST. I could eat it several times a week and not be sick of it (in fact, I went two days in a row one weekend last summer).

Because this place is so small, the wait is awful during brunch. When I say awful, I mean line goes out the door and you have to wait 20 - 30 mins for a table, another 10 mins to flag a waiter down, and then another 15-20 mins for your food kind of awful. 

You have been warned.

So the Waffle Benny: The eggs are poached to perfection, the Hollandaise sauce is rich and creamy and super flavourful, then there's the caramelized bacon on the fresh crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside waffles, oh my gosh. The flavours and textures meld and blend into each other and it's just absolute perfection. 

Waffle Benny comes with salad and a choice of fruit, beans, or potato salad. I always get the fruit and it is always super fresh. I also find that it's a good contrast to the richness of the eggs.

There is an option of substituting the regular mini waffles for potato waffles for an extra charge of (I think) $1. For me, the potato waffles were just way too rich and filling. After finishing everything, I was just uncomfortably full instead of perfectly satisfied after eating the regular Waffles Benny. 

Yes the wait is long and the tables may not be sterile enough to do surgery on, but the food is amazing. And given the amount of people they have working, they are doing pretty well at keeping the people and orders flowing. I have to applaud that one male waiter (sorry, I forgot your name!) who is always at the front keeping everything running smoothly. Even though we can tell you are crazy stressed, you still greet everyone and serve a crazy number of tables with a big smile on your face. You. Are. Awesome.

Last time I was here (summer 2015) it was cash only, but there's an ATM beside the counter. 

I'm kind of glad that Starving Artist is so far from where I live, because I would go broke from eating here if it were a walk-able distance from me. 

Definitely try this place out."}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely amazing!! We went during Sunday afternoon at prime lunch time so the place was packed. We waited about 30 minutes for a table praying that the food would be worth the wait- and it sure was! We got the B.Benny and Fully Loaded to share. My personal favourite was the Fully Loaded and that's only because I'm not a fan of eggs. In saying that, I still enjoyed the B.Benny which was surprising to me. I went with my boyfriend who has a gluten allergy and so, must be on a gluten-free diet. The potato waffles were a great option for us because it was gluten free and added an amazing flavour to the dish. 

The staff were very friendly and the service was great. We already can't wait to go back again but we will go either before lunch time or after lunch time next time to avoid the long line-up."}
{"text":"I know of the original location, so had high expectations for the new location.

The space is very well done - big windows let in lots of natural light, ample seating, well-spaced tables, and the couches in the waiting area bring a cozy touch.

There must have been changes to the serving staff or their training, as I felt they were attentive and quick (despite other reviews).

The positive review ends there, though. While the menu had a varied and interesting selection of waffle-based items, as well as sides and substitutes so you could mix and match your own ideal dish, the execution left a lot of be desired.

I will say that the bacon was fantastic - highlight of the meal.

The regular waffles tasted like they were made from a mix. The maple syrup was runny and was likely Aunt Jemima, not a real Canadian Maple Syrup. As a waffle restaurant, missing on those two things is huge.

The potato waffle was different and interesting, although was more like mashed potatoes than a brunch's hashbrowns.

The Americano was bitter and tasted a bit burnt. 

Definitely not the Starving Artist experience that I expected. I probably won't be going back.

Pros: Architectural space, serving staff
Cons: Waffles, syrup, coffee"}
{"text":"Great portions (should have split with my bf)! Beautiful plate of food when it arrived. I had the gluten-free waffles, and they were not my favorite. They had a distinct flavor to them--I could tell they were gluten-free (sometimes you want food that you'd be unable to tell if it's GF or not), and earthy, grainy taste. Not the best GF waffles I've ever had. But my BF enjoyed his regular waffles and this place has a very inventive menu!"}
{"text":"I love egg bennies and I would say this is my Top 3 egg benny brunch restaurant in Toronto. Their unique and yummy potato waffles with sweet bacons are incredible together!!  Because it is potato waffle, it makes me full easily.  Pretty big portion as well!  I highly recommend their B*benny!!"}
{"text":"Came here since this is supposedly one of those must eat brunches in Toronto. It was pretty packed as expected and it's a first come first serve seating style. We waited for around 15-20 minutes to be seated and this was around 1pm. 

There are so many things to choose from! I had to consult Instagram to see what was good haha! I got the Chicken Bacon + additional Avocado (between waffles) sandwich. I found that pretty creative in choosing their categories. My friend got the B. Benny with potato waffles. 

Overall, it was decent and very very filling. I really don't like soggy food, so I thought that the waffles were too soft for my liking but that's just personal preference because my friend enjoyed the potato waffles. 

Service could be worked on a little more because it was super inattentive (probably short-staffed issued). Took us forever to get the bill. 

To me, this is a place that is good to try once or twice but wouldn't come here on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Had to wait awhile for a seat but food was excellent! Atmosphere is very relaxed and prices were very very reasonable!"}
{"text":"I went here for the first and last time. This place use to be Chinese take out only and there was no washroom. So when I went in being my first time I wasn't sure if there was a washroom and when I asked if there was a washroom I was told it is for customer use only and I needed to order before I could use it. I ordered a waffle and coffee used the washroom and took my food to go would never come back. One of the worst customer service experience wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"I came here for the benny on potato waffles. I was really excited about potato waffles, imagining something crispy-crusty like a latke or rosti. So sad when it was actually mashed stodge instead. I don't know if other people actually like that, or I just got a weirdly underdone batch or something. But it tasted like glue."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why there are such negative reviews for this St.Clair location but I certainly have a few things to say about the Lansdowne one. 

At first we had arrived at the location on Lansdowne, but after being shafted outside to wait and since they \"don't take table unless the entire party is there\" even though half of us were only across the street, we moved to the St. Clair location not too far away.

As soon as we walked in on Good Friday at 11, we knew we were in a bit of a wait. But the wonderful hostess and waiting area with fashionable black couches made that all okay. She was inviting and friendly to everyone who walked in, unlike the hostess at the Lansdowne. Despite the fact that the wait was more than half an hour, it sure didn't seem like it . 
The hostess also would check up if the upcoming people in line for a table was still here waiting, which made it seem like they cared about us!

When my group of four got our seat, our waitress wasn't quite as friendly, but I suppose it was due to the traffic at the restaurant which was acceptable. 

I was very impressed with the waffles, and if you get the option, GO FOR THE POTATO WAFFLE. I've never tried anything like it, and it's an amazing and interesting staple for brunch."}
{"text":"Sorry, but terrible hostess. 
I suppose the food would of been as great as the one on St. Clair, but after being shafted outside and saying \"your table should be ready soon\" then waiting for half an hour, then asked again just to be told the same thing without any politeness was truly disappointing. I was really looking forward to come here.

I will still go to try out the place, although perhaps not anytime soon."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food and the decor! It doesn't look like much from the outside but it was a great comfortable classy environment when you're inside. The food was reasonably priced and the breakfast benny was quite good. We liked the waffles as well but we probably wouldn't order it again for breakfast since we prefer the more savory stuff. Will definitely come back! they have boardgames in the back so I wonder if they let people play when it's not as busy. The place was packed when we went on a sat morning."}
{"text":"Best Eggs Benedict I've had in ages, or maybe ever! My friend and I went here for brunch yesterday around noon. The place was full, with a couple waiting ahead of us, but I could see a few people were almost finished eating so it was about a 10 minute wait. 

We were handed menus while we waited so we could decide what to eat. Holy Hanna, their menu is a waffle-lover's dream come true! I should've taken a photo, but I was too excited. 

The staff are very quick to clear and clean tables to minimize wait time, which is great. We were seated within 10 minutes of arriving, and noticed shortly after, that people starting coming in and the small waiting area filled up quickly. Good timing on our part! 

I desperately wanted coffee, which they offer, but only espresso drinks (americano, latte, etc) so this is the reason I couldn't give five stars. Maybe petty, but I usually like to have two or three cups of coffee with my brunch. I ordered an americano and it was really good, but the coffee cup was VERY small. I would not be ordering a second cup at $3 a shot. My friend ordered a strawberry banana smoothie and said it was delicious. Decent size, but I didn't pay attention to the cost. 

Our food arrived within 10 minutes or so from ordering and I was in heaven!! My, oh my. I ordered the Eggs Benedict on potato waffles, which look like mini waffles but are made from mashed potatoes. They were topped with caramelized bacon and perfectly poached soft eggs and the most delicious hollandaise sauce I've ever had. On the side, I had fresh fruit and some mixed greens. The greens could've been treated differently, maybe a citrus vinaigrette or something as they were a tad boring, but most people don't care about greens. The fruit was a nice mix of orange, grapefruit, pineapple and berries. But the star of my plate was the eggs benny. Wow. I'm still thinking about how good it was, 24 hours later. Maybe I'll go back today for another helping. I'll be sure to have some coffee first ;)"}
{"text":"Soul Food shut down, and has been replaced by this excellent waffle shop. Just North of Bloor on Lansdowne, next to a bunch of houses.  The shop is easy to miss if you aren't from the area. Starving Artist has both a front and backyard patio, and a fair amount of space inside. It's a nicely done up space. They serve up waffles in all sorts of ways. There are savory breakfast waffles, served with eggs benedict. There are sandwich waffles (smoked salmon for the win). And then there are desert waffles, which you can get topped with just about anything. The prices are great, and the waffles are awesome."}
{"text":"Came here with 3 other people mid-afternoon on a weekday.  This restaurant is quite large, with a lot of seating, but considering the time of day there were only a handful of people.  

The sign at the front said to please wait to be seated.  We waited, but no one came, so the woman behind the counter said we could seat ourselves as the hostess would be a minute.  We sat down.  No one came to give us menus, so someone from our party went up to the counter to get them.  

Someone had come in just before us and was having similar issues with slow service and called the woman behind the counter (I think she was the cook) over.  She said that the waitress would be back in a minute (it had been much longer than a minute).  We were ready to order, and somewhat in a hurry, so I waived at the woman behind the counter and said \"excuse me\" and her reply was a \"hissss\" as she walked away. 
 I was really surprised.  

I got the plain waffles with fresh fruit.  They were good, but I could make them at home.  Wouldn't come back here.  Especially after seeing the reviews about poor service from other Yelpers as well."}
{"text":"A group of 4 of us went there on Sunday and had to wait probably 30 minutes (I expected this.) What bothers me is the quality of the food. I ordered the Hitch-hiker which is described as \"Cheesy scrambled eggs, 4 pieces of bacon, 2 mini waffles.\" The eggs do not come as you picture scrambled eggs. They come as two pieces of cooked egg with a piece of processed cheese in between; Completely dried out and tasteless. As well, the two mini waffles were tasteless. For a place that puts EVERYTHING on, in-between or beside waffles, you'd think that the waffles would be amazing, nope, they're not. Personally, I will never return. My husband makes way better eggs.
On top of the disappointing food, at the end we learned that they only take cash! Who does that in 2016??? Some kind of artist is making out there, but rest assured, they are not starving."}
{"text":"Okay, fair warning to you. During the weekends there is a line. The question is - is it worth the wait? Yes, it is but bring your own coffee before you go. Because seriously it's better than what they serve.

As for the drink you could order once you arrive and found a coveted spot - the vanilla almond latte is da bomb. Our only disappointment wasthe americano and have to say, it was way too strong and served in too small a cup to adjust it to something Either of us could enjoy. The latte made up for  it though.

The food was fantastic! I ordered the hitchhiker - I  was in heaven. Everything on my plate was so good. I can't wait to go back. The potato salad I chose as the side was such a surprising delight. Yummers.

Customer service, spot on, even as we lingered for hours catching up over our lattes."}
{"text":"Can't wait to watch this place go out of business! We walked in at opening, not a single customer in the restaurant. They refused to seat us - a party of 12 - because \"only\" 10 people had arrived. The remaining two were coming from the east end, in a snowstorm (and one of them was a baby!). Again, the restaurant was completely empty. \"We have a policy\", they said, loudly and rudely. Great, good luck with that. We walked out, went up the street to BOOM, which was happy to accommodate us and lovely. Walked past Starving Artist again an hour and some later - still empty."}
{"text":"This place has some of the best eggs bennies and what makes it unique is their potato waffles. Would definitely recommend this since waffles is their specialty. Service is not the best though, they always seem a bit disorganized when you're waiting for a table and not the most efficient. Being said, this is still an excellent weekend brunch spot!"}
{"text":"Cute place! I'm a fan. 

Came here with my boyfriend. I had a Breakfast Benny which was absolutely incredible. They make waffles out of potatoes for the base and it was just amazing. We had an order of waffle bacon (yes, waffles with bacon inside) as well which was delightful. I don't even like waffles. 

I was a bit disappointed their blender wasn't working because I was craving a milkshake, but oh well. Next time! 

Also, if you are terrified of bees, I would not recommend this place. It wasn't too bad, but there were a few buzzing around."}
{"text":"I was first drawn to Starving Artist as a brunch place because the initial review I read said this placed specialized in waffles. When my brunch team and I got there, we were pleasantly surprised to find EVERYTHING on the menu made of waffles. The biggest creativity item on the menu is waffled bacon. That's right, I said waffled bacon. It is bacon, covered in waffle batter, placed in a waffle maker, cut into strips and then served with a side of maple syrup for dipping. The brunch menu ranges from waffle grilled cheese, to potato waffles, regular waffles, waffles benny and more. They serve lunch, dinner and dessert (a big list of waffles/toppings) and have vegan options and a big drink list. Waffles come with a choice of two sides (options are fruit salad, potatos, beans and greens).  The tea, was disappointing because it was a regular bag of Lipton. The coffee and lattes looked better. Coffee comes in a French press. 

For someone schlepping from the nose bleed section of North York, Starving Artists was a bit of a hike but one that I would gladly drive back next time I\"m craving waffles. The staff were on top of our table the entire time, despite having to rush back and forth to service the packed brunch house.   If I remember correctly, Starving Artists is a cash only/debit only place."}
{"text":"Weekend vibes at this hipster brunch joint. Everything waffles is the name of the game. We ordered the traditional eggs Benny and smoked salmon Benny so we could compare the regular waffle and potato waffle. Both were delicious, although I was partial to the potato waffles since they were different and went well with the savoury dish. Cash only!"}
{"text":"Very busy spot.. long line up in the morning.. good food..everything waffles.. yummylicious!!! Servers are that friendly and accommodating though"}
{"text":"Got here around 11:30 on a Sunday, which I already knew was a mistake. Had to wait in a line outside in the cold. Finally got inside probably half an hour later.

Server took our drink orders really fast. Drinks came out in a timely manner. I got a hot chocolate for $3.50 and paid the extra .25 to have it made with almond milk. Could've been \"chocolaty-er\" but maybe it was the almond milk that took over. Orders were placed and we waited...40 minutes for our food to come out. Jeez.

Anyways, food was ok. I got the waffles with peanut butter as a \"topping\". It actually comes on the side. The peanut butter is a whopping extra $2, which really, I could've just brought in my own packet, so I don't know what I was thinking. Defs not worth it. Waffles were good. Fluffy and crispy in the right spots. Salad and fruit were a good touch. Would I come back? If I happen to walk by and there isn't a line, sure. But I wouldn't go out of my way for this place. However, my friend that got the Sammy Benny said it was excellent. She killed her plate. They even let her do one potato waffle and one plain waffle."}
{"text":"Nice spot on Lansdowne ave. Always busy for brunch, expect to wait a while to be seated. Food was great, big portions at a reasonable price. Only problem is music is way too loud and server was not too friendly. Otherwise a nice place to eat but wouldn't be rushing back in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"No matter how good the food is, it shouldn't take 45 minutes for it to be served. I told the waitress when it hit the 30 minute mark that we have to leave in time for class. She said our food was the next to be served and we still had to wait another 15 minutes. Not only did the waitress not make it priority to serve us first (other tables who came after us were all served their food, and some even finished and left), but she just continued chatting with her co-worker while we sat there waiting. It was two orders of waffles, it should not take this long. I was so disappointed, never going back here again."}
{"text":"If you're going to experiment with food (eggs benny on a waffle), it better taste darn good. Unfortunately, this place did not meet live up to it. Overcooked eggs. Mushy waffles. The only good thing was the coffee. Although we did ask for coffee and was presented with an Americano (which I understand is still coffee but not the norm here).

Service was decent, but the food was not worth the wait.

Try this place if you're the really adventurous type that doesn't mind taking one for the team. Stay away if you're looking for a reliable, tasty brunch."}
{"text":"Must visit for waffle fans. Had the eggs benedict on potato waffle. Instant food coma. It was delicious and filling. Outside of that, they don't offer much in terms of variety but it's a great brunch spot nonetheless."}
{"text":"Posted pics of my meal. Very colorful. Presentation was very nice, but have had better breakfast with more taste to the eggs, but I'm picky with my eggs. Asked for a side of hollandaise sauce which helped the cheese eggs. 

Waffles and syrup were good. Hubby loved the bacon. They had a nice maple flavor. 

Never thought to add mixed greens salad with breakfast. Will adopted for breakfast I make at home! 

Sat in front of the 2 chefs that worked really well together. A lot of people were getting the eggs Benedict. Think they were called Benny's. 

Sure their coffee would be nice. Buuuuut I brought my own instant old town white coffee. They provided hot water and cream...and didn't ask any questions. 

Venue is small with outside seating in front and I think the back. People do wait in line to eat there. Peek ahead if just 1-2 of you to be seated at the bar. Don't just wait in line until your turn. 

Wouldn't go again, but glad we tried it out. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Bleh -- service is not good for this waffle joint.

Let's face it - most breakfast places are pretty big rip-offs -- the price you're paying is basically for service, when you're too lazy in the morning to cook.  There's nearly nothing on most breakfast menus that you can't make yourself.

We came early afternoon and the place was practically empty.  But service was still surprisingly slow and our server was no where to be found after they dropped off our plates.  They neglected to give us syrup and took us about 10 minutes before we flagged another server down to get syrup... for fucking waffles.

I ordered the spicy chicken waffle sandwich.  It was not spicy at all and it was just sliced chicken meat between two waffles - which made the waffles soggy.  Was not good.  The lady ordered the blueberry waffles -- which were regular waffles and they put some blueberries on top... the fucken audacity.

Do you remember that scene in 'Casino' when Sam Rothstein (Robert DeNiro) blasts the kitchen staff for inconsistent distribution of blueberries and demands that they put an *EQUAL* amount of blueberries in each muffin?  I don't even know what to say when your blueberry waffles doesn't even contain blueberries.  My inner Rothstein wanted to go to the kitchen with a hammer and ask the chef which hand they used to sprinkle blueberries on top of the waffles...

It's kitschy and it does seem to be a popular spot - for reasons I cannot understand."}
{"text":"If you are craving waffles, you might as well go to a place that serves everything either on a waffle, between waffles or pressed into the waffle batter. We started with a plate of waffle bacon for the table. You get four sticks of waffles, each with a strip of bacon encased inside the batter. The table consensus was that there was too much waffle vs bacon ratio, will probably skip that next time. 

I got the Monte Cristo, a large sandwich of ham and turkey but with the buns replaced by waffles. Half the fun was drowning the whole thing in syrup. It was definitely too much food for one person (had to take a half the sandwich to go) but it was a delicious challenge. A pleasant surprise was the B Benny, which came on waffles made of mashed potatoes! Will order that next time instead.

The service is good, but once it gets busy the place becomes slightly chaotic. There is one waitress, one barista and the kitchen staff for the whole restaurant. Our waffle bacon came without any separate plates to eat with, so we ended up juggling syrup on the waffles until our mains arrived. Also, try to come early. Once it hits noon, there will be long line up."}
{"text":"Great place.  However beware of long lineups on the weekends.  Then when you finally sit down, another long wait.  Food is pretty good when it comes.  Service is friendly.  Great ambiance if you like noisy and crowded places. Cash only."}
{"text":"Great service and delicious food. Despite being understaffed, the staff made sure we were comfortable and served. Recommend the potato waffles!"}
{"text":"Having been to the Lansdowne location and loved it, I found the S. Clair location a bit of a letdown. I opted for the Hitchhiker. Cheesy eggs, caramelized bacon, 2 waffles, a side salad and baked beans or potato salad. 

Aside from the beans, my food was luke warm, with the bacon being downright cold. 

The price was right $11 and it was a lot of food, but over all I was disappointed, particularly given the line up."}
{"text":"Went for brunch with my parents and we loved the potato waffles Benedict. However, a few 'suggestions': they closest thing they have to regular coffee is an americano which is served in a tiny cup so basically it's an espresso. Our waitress also got most of our orders slightly wrong. Kind of annoying that they only accept cash... c'mon this is 2017!"}
{"text":"I just had my very first brunch experience at Starving Artist. It was a nice change from the toast & potatoes diner standard I am inclined to. I especially liked their americano and combination \"Waffle Bacon\", both were excellently executed using quality ingredients. 

My expectations were met and I can certainly appreciate a good waffle and syrup replacing my ketchup and hot sauce smothered breakfast 'hash' any day. I swear I didn't see a ketchup or hot sauce bottle in sight! It was a nice treat, but with its rich and heavy eats, small interior and lineups, SA is a gem for those special brunch occasions."}
{"text":"Delicious food. The menu was simple and easy to read but the wait for the food was quite long. Downside- cash only"}
{"text":"Yum  :) I like this place a lot. We came here on a Sunday at 11am with three people and only had to wait 15min, which is pretty good for a popular brunch spot.  

Pleasant service and all of us were happy with our meals. We had the Potato waffles and they were unique and tasty. If you like mashed potatoes and hashbrowns--it was kind like a combination of those two things."}
{"text":"I should probably mention this first: do not eat here! My friend and I decided to go for brunch at this location as it was closeby. It's a much smaller joint and also very dirty.

We arrived around 1:10 and there were about 4 parties in line ahead of us. We didn't get seated until around 1:40. There were tables that needed cleaning and empty ones on the patio that the servers didn't bother cleaning.

We finally got sat at a table that was all the way in the back of the restaurant and the table was clearly still dirty and not wiped down. Instead, we asked to be seated on the patio. 

Here's my biggest complaint: the level of sh** these guys give. There's no organization, no level of real service or care. The server took another table's order first when they were sat after us even though we were ready to order.

On to the food: my friend ordered the Sammy Benny and I the B Benny, eggs benedict with bacon on a potato waffle w/ salad and fruit. It arrived hot and to temperature; that was about the only positive thing about this whole experience. The eggs Benny had pieces of egg shells in it, and the bacon was soggy. I probably finished only half of my meal, and had to get up to ask for maple syrup when other tables were provided with condiments upon seating. At no point did the server come by to refill water or provide us with napkins.

This was honestly the most disappointing meal I've had in a long time. To sum it all up, they just simply don't care. 

Spend your money elsewhere! You've been warned."}
{"text":"Not terrible, but not the best. We arrived for brunch on a Saturday morning around 9:30 AM, and there was a decent amount of seating left. 

First, parking. We found free parking on a residential street about 2 minutes away from the restaurant. There's also street parking available, so parking wasn't too difficult to find overall.

Second, the food. Overall, it was a hit or miss for us. They have a pretty diverse menu with one common factor: waffles. You can get sweet waffles, or savoury waffles, or plain waffles - there's a lot to choose from. I appreciated the number of options and it took awhile to settle on what we wanted. We ended up ordering the B. Benny (2 potato waffles topped with poached eggs & caramelized bacon & hollandaise sauce), and the Chicken Bacon Waffles (Chicken, bacon, cheese, cucumber & secret sauce). I didn't like the Chicken Bacon Waffles at all - they were basically two plain waffles sandwiching very rubbery chicken, and very strange flavours. It was very bland, and wasn't tasty. The B. Benny, on the other hand, was quite delicious! They're basically potatoes shaped into waffles, seasoned well, and quite delicious.

Overall, the experience was just okay for us. The cutlery could have been cleaner, but service was fine, atmosphere was casual and relaxing, portion size was decent. It isn't our first choice in the area, but it's a spot you should try at least once!"}
{"text":"I've been eating at Starving Artist ever since their first location opened on Lansdowne Ave. Regardless of which location I visit, the staff is friendly, the vibe is chill and the food is delicious! As soon as I enter the door, the smell of fresh waffles hits me and I salivate immediately. To eat, I love the Waffle Benny, Sammy Benny, Smoked Salmon, and Chicken Bacon (tastes great both with bacon or avocado). To drink, I love the rooibos tea, chai latte, cappuccino, almond latte, vanilla almond latte. I'm so thrilled to see them expanding and I love that every location reminds me of the original spot where I feel in love with their savoury and sweet waffles!"}
{"text":"I was going to give this place 4 stars..... And then I found the board game section... Amazing lattes (recommend the marshmellow lattes)"}
{"text":"Was excited to try this place.... it was a terrible disappointment. I had the salmon \"Sammy\" benny and my boyfriend had the \"b.benny\" (breakfast Benedict).... both were all wrong... 
a) the hollandaise sauce tastes sour and is not lovely and thick, it is very sad 
b) both of our eggs, when you cut into them, no lovely yellow goo - they were like hard boiled eggs inside! The yolk was almost tacky - gross
c) the actual white of the egg was rubbery and in large ratio in proportion to the yolk which was odd... like eating a terrible egg not even from this planet 
d) waffles - not CRISPY c'mon!!! 
e) potato waffle - not crispy either just a mushy mesh 
f) server did not even come by to see if we were enjoying our food - if she had have come by, I would have expressed my displeasure immediately. 
g) bad maple beans, way too sweet 
h) smoked salmon tasted like rotting fish and also looked the part - could not eat 

In conclusion, too much money for BAD food, no AC and subpar service."}
{"text":"This is a great space with ok food. I ordered scrambled eggs and mini waffles. It came with bacon and a mix green salad. The eggs came as an omlet (ummm ok?) and were burnt. The waffles were ok, they seemed kind of stale and were cold. The bacon was really good and the salad looked so underwhelming, neither my friend or I ate it. 

The best part of the experience was the latte I ordered and the fact that we were sitting in the sun. The staff is very friendly, but the food is definitely underwhelming and I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoy the food at Starving Artist so that's why my review is 2 stars instead of 1. But the ppl who run it are definitely 1 star. 

Now they always have a line, that's to be expected and for good food anywhere I don't mind waiting...but the last time we were in there, the line was very long and there were about 4 tables that were free, they just weren't being cleared. 
Not only did that suck for the ppl in line but it was pretty gross for the ppl already seated to just leave dirty dishes on a table. 
Maybe they were short staffed, sh*t happens, but that's a show of how professional and well managed they actually are (not). On top of that, when we were finally seated, it took forever for a server to actually come to us and take our drink orders. Again, I realize when places are busy things fall through the cracks, but there wasn't even a \"sorry for the wait\" or anything. A little niceness goes a long way in these situations. 

Most recently I tried to order over the phone for pick up, and I was told by whoever answered that they aren't taking any orders because the kitchen is too busy so call back in 1/2 an hour. Isn't that the equivalent of turning people away at the door?? (Maybe that's why the tables weren't cleared, to buy the kitchen some time to catch up). 

Either way, the food is good but the management/staff running the show are awful. Hopefully they fix that problem!"}
{"text":"I'm not usually crazy about waffles - I solidly fall on the pancakes are greater than waffles side of the fence, however, Starving Artist makes me question my love for all other carbs. Bread, English Muffins, Buns, Paninis, Bagels, Pizza Dough - don't need'em! I'm just going to eat everything on a waffle now.

Hehe, if only :P.

Anyway, this little gem just steps away from Lansdowne station specializes in, you guessed it, waffles! 

I find the service to always be good & attentive here, but like with most places in the downtown area, if you come during peak brunch hours, you are in for a wait. In a party of two I haven't had to wait more than about 15 minutes, and with a party of 4 I have generally waited about 45 minutes each time. What I see them do a lot is when someone orders a smoothie, they make extra and offer it to the people waiting for tables!

Starving Artist has a pretty cool vibe. The walls have lots of comic book art (with prices listed below in case you are interested in buying some), and I'm sort of a geek for stuff like that, so big points in my book for that! There's always a movie playing in the back (last time it was Rango), and there's tons of board games if you want to liven up your experience (recommended for non-brunch hours when the place isn't packed.)

I've been here a few times but these dishes rank among my favourites:

Waffle Benny: Who doesn't like a good eggs benny?! Now picture that delicious eggs benny but served on a fluffy, moist waffle with caramelized bacon (which can be substituted for some fresh, giant, avocado slices.) Recipe for success!

Monte Cristo: LOTS of roasted ham and mozzarella sandwiched in french toast waffles. Yep, you read that correctly, french toast waffles. I am a lover of all things french toast, so this was the first thing I ever tried at Starving Artist. It left a delicious and great impression! Try it with maple syrup!

They do have the infamous \"waffle bacon\" here - which is bacon dipped in waffle batter then pressed in the waffle iron, however, I'm not really sold on it. I find it's too much waffle & not enough bacon, so the bacon kind of gets lost in the waffle.

They also have GIGANTIC and yummy smoothies - I can never finish one on my own (in fact I'm lucky to down a quarter of one), so I always split one with a dining companion. If you ask they are more than happy to split it into two glasses.

I always have a good experience here, and I will definitely be returning again. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I would have reviewed the food if i ate there but due to them being short staffed we couldn't be seated for another 20 mins because thats when the server would have time to clear the table. Another family ended up seating themselves and clearing their own table which i found odd. The server was very unapologetic and clearly doesn't care when people walk out. If that was my business i would have enough staff to cover the place especially a busy time  like this. It was quite the disappointment and just because of that experience i will not go back nor will i recommend this place. There are tons of places in the city that operate professionally and value their patrons, clearly this place does not."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a complete disaster. Very disorganized. Always under-staffed so the waiters and chefs project negative energy into the place. Our coffees didn't come out until after the food, about 20 mins after ordering... I'm pretty sure our server went out back to cry at one point because you could tell she was about to break down from the stress and constant complaints from her customers and co-workers. AND the owner is too cheap to accept debit or credit. Come on, it's 2017 and our generation is extremely inconvenienced by cash. It's all too bad, because the food is actually quite delicious, but the overall experience is enough to keep me from going back or ever recommending this place to anyone. A shame..."}
{"text":"After debating between here and Emma's Country Kitchen, we opted to go here due to the hour wait at Emma's.

We arrived at 1:50 pm EST and it took around 25 minutes after to get our food ordered.

It took almost an hour after that to get our food.
The food itself was pretty delicious (maybe I was just so hungry at this point). I ordered the B. Benny meal which my friend mentioned tasted way better than their chicken waffle sandwich. 

However, like others have pointed out the service leaves a lot to be desired.

I am unsure if it's due to being understaffed or if the kitchen needs to speed up cook time. It was a very poor experience and this definitely needs to change as this place has decent food. 

The waffle everything concept is unique though and our server gave us complimentary drinks for being patient which was nice.

One last note, it's cash only which is kind of annoying to be frank."}
{"text":"Super good, the only downside was the wait. It wouldn't have been pretty in high winter, but it was decent enough.  Place is packed, but not the point of you're elbow to elbow. But two big partys of 10 people will cause a backlog if anything.

What to eat here?  This place is famous for their waffles; waffle sandwiches; waffle bacon; different kinds of dessert waffles.

I ordered their smoked salmon waffle, which comes with capers, cream cheese on a dill waffle. It was excellent, lots of smoked salmon, and not has heavy handed with the cream cheese; kinda wished I had more capers. But overall nicely balanced.

Dessert waffles were great, try their apple one, which was probably the favorite for our party, but I love their blackberry and pear one, which isn't for everyone. 

Waffle bacon was interesting, essentially it was a waffle with strips of bacon in it. They provide maple syrup as a dipping sauce. Overall impresson, good but felt a bit gimmicky.

Service was friendly and patient, despite being packed."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!

Yes this is the place that blew my socks off with their salmon eggs benny. The Benny was perfectly poached and the hollandaise sauce was delightful. This was the dish which inspired me and my gf to attempt our own eggs benny and let me tell you right now: making your own hollandaise sauce is a nightmare.

The star of the dish for me wasn't only the salmon eggs benny but the potato salad on the side. Ive never expected much from a potato salad but it had a nice tangy yet herby taste to it. I wish I'd know what was inside cause it was just so good. 

Finally we had a dessert waffle called Let's Split (?) - it was pretty standard but we will be trying other dishes next time for sure. 

Great prices. Fair portions and clean environment. Would come again if it wasnt so far away!"}
{"text":"So first of all...you have to get waffles. Seriously You have no choice. I thought they'd have a couple non waffles options but nope. Seriously. Everything is based on waffles. I think they was some waffle in my coffee. 

The off thing is the waffles we had weren't great. Soggy for sure but also oddly sour and unpleasant. 

Also bee warned. Wasp city. It's a bit of an annoying thing outside. Not their fault but it's a thing. 

Nice staff. Cute place but the good wasn't so good. Not a return trip kind of thing."}
{"text":"I came on a Thursday for lunch and I was pleasantly surprised. My friend brought me here and I have no idea what to think. I love waffles so I was very happy!

Staff: Very friendly, seated quickly. Food came quickly. We actually had two servers helping us, but it may have had to do with it being a Thursday.

Ambience: I really like the décor. Of course, I have a soft spot for hard lofts and the style of the place reminded me of a hard loft. With their exposed brick and open concept, I started to dream about living somewhere that looked like Starving Artist.

Food: I had the Monte Cristo which was ham, turkey and havarti on french toast waffles. It was really yummy. It was already sweet enough for me so I didn't have to add more syrup. I had mixed greens and potato salad on the side, so by the end of it I was so full!

Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Every time I come to Toronto I come here. This is by far my favorite place to eat brunch, lunch, anything. My favorite dish here is the B. benny which is eggs Benedict on a potato waffle (I live for potato waffles) with a hollandaise sauce. Cooked very well and taste even better. It comes with greens which taste good with their dressing and i usually get fruit. But honestly everything they serve is great. Since they are usually busy, the wait is a little on the longer side so I would say to come early morning. But this place is def worth the wait. Otherwise customer service is good when they have enough people working. Will continue coming back to any of their locations!"}
{"text":"The Restaurant has nice Decor, but they take awhile just to serve you, a drink. How long does it take to give me a Ginger Ale. The hostess is nice, but they take awhile just for Chai Latte. There is Graffiti on the Wall outside. The experience is so so, I have had better, they need to make things a bit faster.
I couldn't eat because, the restaurant has a bunch of Bees that always just want apiece of your food, highly suggest sitting inside,
Bees are very unpleasant 
But besides that the food was good and on weekends at 10 they aren't so packed"}
{"text":"This has become a go-to brunch place for me since I moved to the 'hood. 

The decor inside is pretty neat - as the old saying goes, no brunch place is complete without a fish tank. The service is pretty friendly, although often slow (mainly due to not having enough servers on hand and the fact that it's always packed in there). If you sit at the bar, you can watch all the food being cooked/plated (which is fun for some but gross for others) and joke around with the kitchen staff. 

Coffee-wise, their americanos are delish. Food-wise, everything I've had has been good - I normally get the Sammy Benny which is A+. Their menu is pretty big and includes lots of sweet and savoury options. There are also are a few different sides to choose from - the fruit is always fresh and delicious, which is a big deal to me. I weep when I get a side of fruit that is 95% watery honeydew melon.

My main criticism? Well, I suggest getting a table near the back if you can. In the winter, it's very cold near the front due to the door being continually opened and closed from people coming and going. In the summer, they open up all the front windows... which would be really nice, except that the place is OVERRUN with wasps (the insect, not  the socioeconomic group... although maybe that too). They seriously need to do something about that.

A solid brunch joint, in my humble opinion. There's usually a line, though, so be prepared to wait!"}
{"text":"The food was moderately good. The menu is unique and I appreciated the gluten free options. However the wait for our Sunday brunch was about 45 minutes. It was also exceedingly slow to get someone to take our order. While waiting to pay, I saw staff texting on their cells. Unfortunately the service lets this place down. If it's Sunday, go to Lady Marmalade instead."}
{"text":"Having visited Starving Artist on St. Clair avenue, I entered a bit worried. My expectations weren't overly high. My fears were allayed. Yes there was a longish wait, but I expected that for a weekend. Once we got a table, service was excellent. I had the hitch hiker with gluten free waffles and I was very pleased with the entire plate. My guest had the western and was equally impressed. I had a delicious blueberry smoothie that I would also recommend. I am hoping that these high standard do not ever drop as I definitely plan to return. I would highly recommend that anyone requiring gluten free options try Starving Artist."}
{"text":"Great place to have brunch. Open and airy space made it a lively place. They specialize in waffle dishes so do yourself a favour and get those types of dishes!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here quite a few times and our experiences have been inconsistent.

When we first started going for brunch about a year ago, the place would get busy but we never really waited for a seat or for service/food. The food was hot and delicious (if perhaps not all made from scratch). It became a quick brunch favourite.

My personal favourite is the Breakfast Benny (potato waffles, poached eggs, hollandaise, maple bacon, w/ side salad and either fruit salad, baked beans or potato salad). This is really filling and so satisfying when done right.

Lately, this place has really gone downhill. They don't seem to be able to keep up with their growing business. Service has been terrible - waiting forever for the hipster staff to get over their hangovers and take your order or bring your food over to the table. The food quality has gone down as well. The last time I was there, my eggs were so runny I was left with a pool of snotty egg whites on my plate, the bacon was far from crispy and my potato waffles were cold. Everything seemed rushed. Even the cappucino I got to kill the time between ordering and actually eating was cold on arrival and was mostly milk.

I'd really love to love this place again. When they do it right, it's so right, but they need to get it together with more staff and quality control."}
{"text":"My FAVOURITE spot for BRUNCH, definitely!!!!
I had tried different waffles and drinks, but my favourite is the smoked salmon waffle and the morrocan peppermint tea.

It's a waffle place, everything on waffle, between waffle, with mini waffle.. all tasty combinations worth trying. I also really like the side salad and potato salad that comes in some of the plates. Like the combination of it and the waffle.

The service is good average and the place is clean and big. The only problem is that they just accept cash. They have an ATM inside tho.

Be careful trying it, you can get addicted (like me)!"}
{"text":"Fair warning: this restaurant has a bee and wasp problem. They mention this on a sign at the door, and they aren't kidding: we were seated inside, and had a few buzzing around the sweet items on our table throughout our meal. We watched customers squirm, swat, and finally move inside from the even waspier patio. If this is a dealbreaker, go elsewhere in the warmer seasons. 

Insects aside, the food is good to very good. Poached eggs were yolky and baked beans tasty. Oddly, our plates came with piles of undressed, dry greens; were they meant to be swirled in my hollandaise? A waffled Monte Cristo was satisfying, but wasn't the true, heavily cheesed melt-style treat that I had expected. I learned that they only serve espresso-based coffee when I got an americano after ordering a regular drip -- legit enough, but would have liked to know this earlier. The latte was strangely boozy-tasting, as if faintly sprayed with some kind of flavour shot. Popular with the thirtysomething, sharply barbered Bloordale set."}
{"text":"Waiting time is tooooo long. For one person, I came in before 11:30 but I did not start eating until 12:50pm...  the servers (2 ladies) were extremely busy and if they have one more server it will be much better. So they did not have much time to take care of me. It is okay, but I was so bored and unhappy after waiting for so long and nobody came to say a word. But the server did one nice thing that she got me a side potato mini waffle to avoid the confusion for chefs when I wanted a sub for my sandwich waffle.

Food, after such waiting, I was unhappy and it was not impressive enough to make me happy. Okay sandwich ( I ordered breakfast sandwich with bacon and egg). The egg was made with waffle maker, which looked interesting to me. The salad dressing was nice (vinegar). Hot chocolate was lucre warm, and was below average. The side potato waffle is over seasoned, a bit salty and I did not finish it. 

So far, this is okay. Maybe I ordered a wrong item. But the food does not make the wait worth."}
{"text":"The food is amazing! Waffles were delicious and great hollandaise sauce for the bennys. And they don't skimp on the side fruit you get.

Great service! The staff were very kind. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I had been waiting to try this place for a long time for its unique concept of using waffle as a base for every dish. I am not a big fan of waffle but I heard great reviews for this place and wanted to try it out. I got the waffle benny with chai latte and it was delicious :D the waffles and benny melted in mouth. The chai latte was good as well."}
{"text":"Eggs Benny.. Two poached eggs on potato waffles with caramelised bacon.. Perfection"}
{"text":"Food was good but the place is criminally short staffed. Sunday at 11:30, waited 15 minutes for a table when there were 4 or 5 that hadn't been cleared yet. When we sat down, it was another 20min before the took our order and brought us cutlery. 

The whole time I was there, there was a lineup and empty tables. Hire more people!"}
{"text":"Nothing too special. Typical brunch place with typical dishes but the taste was overall lacking. I tried the potato waffle with bacon. And pochard egg.  The fruit and salads on the side was not fresh and the Hollandaise source was tasteless. The pitched eggs where overdone.   Not a place I would go back to."}
{"text":"Great brunch on Saturday morning! We came as a group of 3 around 9.30AM and walked right in. Our server was really friendly and gave good recommendations on the menu. I had the eggs benny with greens and fruit on the side. Eggs were perfectly poaches and it was a good portion. Also had a decaf americano which was delicious as well. My friend got the western dish (western omelette between two waffles) which she really enjoyed, as well. A great addition to the neighbourhood brunch scene!"}
{"text":"I'm a total morning person and love the breakfast/brunch focused menus. The menu is decently priced and is balanced between the sweet and savory dishes. Perfect for those people who need to satifsy their sweettooth in the early morns with items such as the caramel pecan waffle or fruity yogurt granola bowl. But I'm all about the savory. My \"go-to\" item on the menu are their Benny Waffles, especially the Sammy Benny which contains Atlantic Salmon costs only $13. It comes with 2 sides a choice of fresh light green salad or assorted fruits and a side of beans or potatoe salad. I recommend trying their potatoe salad, it's really good. You may even want to up your waffle to a potatoe waffle for a small extra charge. Sadly, Starving Artist will need to improve on their service. From the numerous times I've visited the St. Clair W location service was disappointing. It gets real busy and your caught waiting in line for about 10-15 minutes before someone actually notices you. You will need to get their attention if you want a spot."}
{"text":"The waffles are light amd fluffy, best waffles I've ever had! The eggs benedict was delicious, I like the meals come salad and fruit instead of greasy  sides - perfect balance of flavors"}
{"text":"My aunt has taken to watching: 'You Gotta Eat Here!' And we meet up to hang out every so often.  She saw this place ( their Lansdowne location) and wanted to do brunch.  

After reading the reviews of the original and St Clair Ave West locations I decided that we would meet at the one on College. 

Location is easy to get to, and the decor is simple and clean which I give thumbs up! It was not too busy as we agreed to do a late brunch so perhaps we missed the breakfast crowd.  

The weather outside was warm so when water arrived at our table I thought it'd be ice cold....not quite but it wasn't warm so not a big worry.  

We both ordered the Breakfast waffle which consisted of potato waffles with caramelized bacon poached egg with salad and your choice of fruit salad, potato salad or baked beans.  Oddly enough it came with hollandaise which made it the B Benny but oh well.  My aunt had the baked beans while I had the fruit salad.  

In short it was delicious, I would have liked the egg a little more runny and the potato waffles a bit more toasted but the combination of everything was delicious!  I would caution you on the mixed greens that if you want more dressing to ask for it as it is almost non-existent.  

The service was good, not too pushy and not lazy.  Friendly in their suggestions without being blazé about it.  

This location is still waiting for their liquor license so be ware that no booze with your brunch! Worthwhile in coming back, I know I will!!!!"}
{"text":"Thanks to Tobias and Byron for inventing the waffle-slider!  Byron the Builder did an amazing job renovating the interior (and does this professionally on the side?).

This schwanky night-spot doubles as a cozy lunch / brunch spot and your experience will be night and day depending on whether you go (surprise!) night or day.

I've enjoyed the brunch menu but happened by late one night and I had the waffle sliders with salad (fresh strawberries, almonds, crispy greens).  The two mini-burgers served on sweet belgian waffles and a to-die-for garlicky mayonnaise were a carnivore's delight.  Topped with standard burger veg (lettuce, tomato).  I had a chance to sample a massive nacho plate ordered by a nearby patron.  Friendly chat with random strangers and widely-acknowledged for extremely reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Four stars for the brunch and service. We were seated fast on a Sunday morning, however it took us forever to get our food...... Love the eggs!"}
{"text":"Went there today. Really enjoyed our b Benny's. Great coffee too. You gotta eat here!"}
{"text":"Oh....caramelized bacon, perfectly poached eggs filled with liquid gold, savory sweet waffles....Starving Artist brunch, how I love thee.  

I seriously think back to that first time I had brunch there and drool.  

Then, I sigh and think I don't want to deal with the lineup of yuppies all waiting for a table.  

The only reason why I gave this place 4/5 stars:  some (not all) of the customers suck.  Rude, inconsiderate, and obnoxious.  I'm sorry you have to \"step over vagrants\" to get to the restaurant, perhaps you should stick to Yorkville since evidently you think Lansdowne is full of thugs ready to mug you?  

The last time I was at the restaurant, the place was packed, wherever there was an open spot, you got seated.  My friend and I took a seat at the counter, which was perfect since then we could watch them cook and chat, but not everyone was so satisfied.   One large group in particular  sitting by the door was non-stop complaining and blocking the entrance.  Yes, I understand that sitting by the door sucks, especially in the winter, but you came there with six people, and that was the only table available at that time.  If the guy running the restaurant says \"No\" to your request to move tables (since the other table was spoken for), you don't go and then ask the waitress (who did not know that they had already asked the owner and he denied them) and get her in trouble.  Awesome.  Way to be dicks.  

Anyways, this place is really really special.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Had a second visit here last week - wasn't terribly busy, but experienced the same unusually long wait to get a menu and had to get up and search out the waitress again - but the staff were apologetic and sweet. 

Food was delicious as usual (and the cook was gracious to accommodate a food allergy) - but the reason for the 3 stars? The WASP problem. I ended up sitting in the back patio, which mercifully did not have wasps buzzing around (I also avoided ordering anything sugary or sweet, lest to attract them) but almost all the tables inside the place had fly swatters placed on them, with patrons looking slightly uncomfortable, trying to eat while swatting away wasps buzzing around their heads. 

It probably didn't help that I visited on a Wednesday morning, when the nearby streets are lined with with dozens of stinking garbage and recycling bins on the curb, waiting for pick-up (which probably exacerbates the wasp problem.) 

If the owners (or anyone associated) reads this, it would maybe help to wash down your tables, walls and floors with eucalyptus soap on a regular basis, as it's a natural repellent - I used to have a wasp and mosquito problem on my apartment balcony, but it worked like a charm. (I use Dr. Bronner's brand, found at most health stores.)"}
{"text":"Long wait in line, but that's understandable. Waited 1/2 hour to order our food because the waitress was slow. Took over 1 HOUR for our food to arrive after ordering. No tables had any food for over 30 mins. All in all spent over 3 hrs here for waffles for god sakes. Food's good though, but why did it take so long?? Oh and bees, BEES EVERYWHERE!!

tl;dr Food's good, but not worth the wait. Don't come if you're allergic to bees."}
{"text":"Once I figured out how to order JUST waffles I was very impressed by the food. It was super speedy as well! There was street parking nearby for a Saturday morning and we didn't have to wait for a table. Reasonable prices, good food, friendly staff. I would definitely go back here if I was in the area."}
{"text":"A wonderful place to try something new if your in a rut from constantly dining at The Sunset grill or Cora's in the morning and want to try something different! This a fantastic place to eat. They specialize in different styles of waffles and my personal favour is the Loaded baked potato waffle. It is a must to have and it fills you up in the right spots! The service is good, and the place is spacious. I went back the next week for more!"}
{"text":"I saw this place on a \"best eggs benny\" list, and I'd say that's a pretty big call, given competition in this city... But it's super tasty all the same. The eggs seem coddled versus poached (for those who care enough to distinguish), but the potato waffles are pretty great - especially with avocado - and coffee, service, fruit etc are all worth it. I did miss homefries, but the potato salad was a decent sub for the breakfast tradition. Worth a visit of two."}
{"text":"The potato waffles are seriously delicious. The Breakfast Benny was definitely the way to go. But had to wait a while to be seated do to the size of the place. So also not a great place to go with a group. Two people is the optimum number per party... And the potato waffle is really the only thing that put it over the top for me. It was good, but I haven't hurried back for more... yeah know?"}
{"text":"I was guided here by my partner without advanced research (unusual for me) and was surprised when I learned that *everything* came on, with, or between waffles. I was skeptical for a minute but then we all loved it. I had the B.Benny and the potato waffles (I was somehow thinking potato flour but it was really mashed potatoes) were so filling I could only eat half the order. My partner had the spicy chicken sandwich and we agreed it was amazing. The youngster in our party (4 and 7) thought having a grilled cheese with waffles was hilarious and that the mini waffles were super cute Girls loved the beans, which were surprisingly sweet. Great service. Nice people. Good location. Wish they took cards, but that's my only small complaint."}
{"text":"Experience was terrible. Inside there was no AC, they even had to leave the front door open. When I got inside, the wait was 20 minutes a table (which is fine since the reviews were good and I assumed it's worth the wait for good food...). Once we got a table, the waitress then asked us to delay our food orders and simply order drinks first because the kitchen is backed up.

Put the orders in and the wait was almost another 50 minutes (don't really understand why it would take so long to fry an egg on top of a waffle with cut fruit and salad). At that point I was starving (I guess that's where the name 'starving artist' came from). Once the food arrived, it just tasted average at best and that's ontop of being really hungry. Portions were small for the price.

If anyone were to come here for a visit, I would think twice before coming for average food you can get elsewhere for half the wait time."}
{"text":"Eggs Benny on potato waffle is amazaballs! More bacon and more space next time and i'll give it a 5!"}
{"text":"For brunch this place is pretty cute! I went to the one on the west side of bloor and there wasn't a long line up on a Sunday morning for brunch. The concept is pretty good - waffle on ERRRRYTHING. I also had a chocolate milkshake that was great, sweet and helped my sweet tooth at noon :) 

The egg benedicts were cooked pretty well and oozed when it should. I like that their waffles are also the right amount of crunch and sweetness to balance the savoury on top of it."}
{"text":"Nice concept but food isn't that great. What's with the cash only policy? I'm very iffy of restaurants with that policy (tax purposes...). Service is bad, i watched the sever wiped the table and let the crumbs fall on the floor. 

I don't get the hype of the potato waffle at all. I thought the potato waffle would be light and crisp, similar to latkes, instead I found the texture to be quite mussy. The poached egg is fine, I mean, you can't call yourself a brunch place if you mess up a poached egg anyways.

My friend got the Spicy chicken waffle for $12 and the chicken was dry and bland, no sign of jalapeno at all."}
{"text":"Gary & I love you guys so much that we keep coming back for so much love & wonderful potato waffle bennys. We are happy to to have 2 options to fill our tummies with tasty treats every Sunday. We have felt so at home here that we celebrated our wedding brunch at the original Starving thanks to the lovely Marianna and it was the sweetest & most savoury day to date:) Taylor, Nikki and Lolly we are your fans forever!!! Xox"}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place. I think it's quite hard to mess up brunch items and the meal I had at Starving Artist wasn't terrible but it wasn't amazing either. I had read so many rave reviews about this place and was somewhat let down during my visit. I ordered the \"Waffle Benny\" (carmelized bacon on waffles with hollandaise) with a side of salad greens and fruit. The wait for our food wasn't super long and the place was busy for a weekday afternoon. However, the water jug and glasses seemed a little dirty and could have been cleaned better. 
When the food arrived, it looked great. Brunch is definitely the most \"photogenic meal\" and as legend dictates, if you don't stop to Instagram your meal, did you really eat it? Anyways, back to the meal, the hollandaise wasn't broken and had a great consistency while the eggs had the most magically round shape. The waffles tasted like your standard Eggo waffle which was the biggest disappointment. I didn't expect to like the carmelized bacon but it was great. The side salad was standard and something quickly thrown together while the fruit looked old and tasted over ripe. My dining companion ordered the smoked salmon benny which she enjoyed. Our meals came up to about $12-$13 per person which I thought was fair though I probably would've given one more star if they were lower. 
The main reason I gave Starving Artist a 3 star review was that I don't understand the hype with this place. Their waffle tasted like a store bought mix and their potato salad is definitely from a store-bought tub. It was a good meal but not special."}
{"text":"Eggs Benny where delicious. Reasonable portions, not large which leaves room for dessert. Don't go pee with the door open."}
{"text":"Just came back from this wonderful brunch place. We have a party of 6 and arrived there at 11am, took us over an hour to wait in a line to get a table. The place is not huge, typical boutique brunch place.

What surprises me is the attitude of the waitress and waiter. They have patience and organized manner to get things ordered.

There's no back kitchen, it is like a bar style where you see how they make their orders.

What surprises me even more is the presentation of the meal. It is buzy during peak hour for Sunday brunch and we have a group of 6, we ordered Breakfast waffle, The hitchhiker, breakfast benny x2, salmon sandiwch and 3 other dessert waffle. The presentation of those dish were not sacrificed!  

We did not have to wait too long for the meal and of course they are delicious!

The only thing I find is the mini waffle felt abit 'empty' yet it is still delicious. The potato waffle is great! Although I won't have more than two. It gets 'heavy'.

Everything is waffle based including sandwiches. Delicious and the price was reasonable. 

We have latte for each person, main meal for each person and dessert and appetizer (share by 6), the total bill comes to be around $20. Not bad. 

I will definitely come visit here again probably summer time."}
{"text":"one of fav brunch places. especially when I crave waffles. go before 11 to avoid lineups"}
{"text":"You'd think that, given how cool this place looks and feels, it would be a much better experience. But, it was totally disappointing.

Popped in here with my girlfriend, allured by the line out the door and the interesting looking menu (waffle everything), and waited patiently to be seated. Upon being seated, we were treated to pretty awful service from a girl who seemed to hate her job, and when asking her even the simplest question, were glared at like we were committing a crime.

The food itself was average to below average. My girlfriend went with the gluten free option, and it was yuck. I don't recommend it. My food was average, nothing special, but still satisfying as it was the kind of food I was looking for that morning (bacon, eggs, waffles). 

It's funny that they named this joint \"Starving Artist\", because if this was an artist, it deserves to starve. I know they get people in the door with their trendy vibe, but it's just not worth it. There are so many better options in the city, although, sadly, I don't know if there are any great ones in this part of town."}
{"text":"Amazing waffles! Service is good, vibe is great, not too expensive. I had breakfast and was served pretty quickly. Would definitely go here again!"}
{"text":"Service is terrible. There was one waitress who had a stinky attitude. I don't know if she isn't getting paid enough but don't take it out on customers. The medium length dark haired waitress should really get her attitude checked, and learn how to speak to customers in a more polite tone. And of course, wasps EVERYWHERE. Doesn't matter whether you're sitting outside or inside no matter what they say. They are everywhere especially once the food comes. 
Food was pretty good, but you can find many other places just as good if not better with waitresses who don't speak to you as if you just kicked their dog. 

1/5 - would not come back"}
{"text":"While on a short trip to Toronto we stopped at Starving Artist for breakfast. We were pleasantly surprised when we arrived and there was no line up. I heard this place gets pretty busy. We were told it would take about 20 minutes to get a table. The patrons finished up sooner than expected and we were seated within 5. This place is really tight and uncomfortable so be prepared to 'dance' with people while they leave and you enter.

While I waited, I did take a look around the kitchen and the espresso machine and could see what people were writing about. This place REALLY needs a good wipe down. The lion statue at the front, don't get too close, it's covered in hair which is strange since its concrete. Maybe its art?

Cleanliness aside, I was able to get past this once I saw the menu and the pics on Yelp. One word, waffles. Waffles everywhere. Whether you're after a savory breakfast or a sweet one, Starving Artist will give you what you crave. 

I had the Hitchhicker's Breakfast and everyone else at my table had the B. Benny. The B. Benny is made with potato waffles and wow were they tasty! I LOVED the caramelized bacon. A perfect hint of sweetness and cooked perfectly. 

I like that the breakfast came with a bit of fruit and also some greens. The 2 mini waffles were a great treat without making me feel too bad about it. 

From the moment we sat down until the moment we left, there was a line of at least 8 people waiting, outside, in the cold. When people are waiting outside and its negative degrees outside? Yep, it must be good.

I'm sad I don't get to visit Toronto as much as I used to because I could definitely see myself becoming a frequent customer at Starving Artist."}
{"text":"The Waffle sandwiches are great! A small, light and fluffy waffle. I had the Chicken Bacon Club. Enjoyed it very much! The coffee is great too! BRUNCH ALL DAY!  :D"}
{"text":"I recently visited this restaurant for a quick bite to eat with some vegan friends as we seen the menu had some vegan options. We were surprisingly disappointed in the waffles that were the main it on the menu, everything was paired with these waffles. The staff were per occupied with changing music, talking to one another and making more of these horrid waffles. No smile or acknowledgement when we walked through the door, one man simply stated \"how many\" and then \"sit here\". the place wasn't busy 4-5 tables full. i had the eggs Benedict as m vegan friends had the veggie waffle sandwich. This was a horrid mix of soggy tomatoes, black avocados and peppers. They had a horrible watery version of Aunt Jemima syrup.. keep in mind THEY ARE A WAFFLE HOUSE! Given we are in Canada it is easy to get quality maple syrup across the street!! 

the one star was for the coffee...."}
{"text":"Very lazy service staff.  20 ppl waiting and 10 tables but not sitting anyone.

I'm by the food preparation station and after the bell rings, it takes 5 Mins for someone to grab it.  The food is getting cold! 

I see the staff just hanging around and talking. 

Very frustrating experience.

Food was good though. If not I would have gave it 1 star."}
{"text":"This Waffle and Espresso bar is a wonderful addition to the Bloor-Lansdowne neighbourhood. The waffles are truly exceptional and the coffee here is amazing.  Breakfast is a bang for your buck!  We had the starving artist waffles and the hitchiker waffles with coffee - spent $20 and left feeling full. I couldn't even finish the fruit on my plate. 

The atmosphere is great with two patios and an inviting indoor space and the staff is super friendly. I can't wait to go back to Starving Artist! Looking forward to trying the nacho waffles with drinks on a wed night. They have a jazz band play there every Wed."}
{"text":"3/5 not because of the food (which was GREAT) but the service was AWFUL. 

A very busy place especially during brunch. We were first greeted by the cashier who told us to take a seat on the couches... but we waited a good 15 minutes and started noticing that 3 other larger groups (3-4 people) got seats before us. We then asked one of the servers and they clearly forgot about us and sent us back on the waiting couch. 

You do wait another 20 minutes for food... It's kind of funny how they actually make you STARVE for your waffles. 

The potato-waffles are a must-try and the poached eggs were amazing!! We truly enjoyed it. 

They also only take cash. The cashier must have been a new employee, as we ended up paying more than we should have... but we just wanted to leave. 

Hopefully service is better off at the Lansdowne location."}
{"text":"The cash only thing is really annoying. They also don't bring you a bill and you have to pay at the cash, and then they don't offer you your change when you pay. A forced tip. Strange.

The food is ok and good coffee but the cash only thing is too annoying for me."}
{"text":"Relaxed atmosphere and great service. Had the most delectable and rich hollandaise sauce and poached egg ever. Couldn't get enough of the potato waffle and the potato salad was moist and delish."}
{"text":"One of my favourite brunch places! Love the vibe of the restaurant, it's almost like a half art gallery half restaurant. The service is also very welcoming and comfortable, and their menu is spectacular. I order a waffle eggs benny, with a side of green salad and potato salad. Everything about this meal was perfection. No complaints at all about the dish I tried. 

I took away a star only because the restaurant is tiny and the waits are typically pretty long. I wish Starving Artist wasn't so difficult to commute to! But I will definitely still be making another visit."}
{"text":"This is the kind of place you come once for the experience in my opinion. Came in with 2 friends on a Saturday morning around 10:45am. There was a line, we waited about 40 minutes for a table- to be expected. Beware if you are hung over, this place blares music with heavy bass.

The service is very slow. The servers were very slow to clear tables after patrons left. 3+ empty tables waiting to be cleaned as we stood in line. This was discouraging to watch as the lines grew to be out the door. Once we were seated we ordered drinks. I saw the americanos being served and they looked extremely strong in tiny cups. I asked for an americano in a tall latte cup with extra hot water. I found it enjoyable and I'm glad I requested the extra water. Our drinks were long finished by the time our food came over half an hour later.

 I ordered the Chicken Bacon. Didn't see our server once as we ate. My meal was ok, I don't think the chicken was freshly cooked, tasted like packaged pre-sliced chicken. The sauce made the waffle soggy and it was messy.

It's a cool concept, and it's reasonably priced. I saw some of the dessert waffles come out and they looked awesome. Unfortunately after 2 hours there we decided to leave. If you like waffles I would recommend trying this place out during the week and trying one of the sweet waffles."}
{"text":"Poor service, same lousy waffle mix packaged waffles, and microwave eggs. 

Potato salad is packaged,  and coffee is over priced. 

Not a welcome addition to the neighborhood. Try emma's down the street if you want home made food.

If you want assembled food save money and goto mcdonalds"}
{"text":"Store bought potato salad. Microwave eggs. Store bought waffle mix. Hugely disappointing."}
{"text":"Ordered: Mango Juice + Fully Loaded 

Food 4.5/5 - the fully loaded is very good, but the mango juice is just like any other. 

Price 3.5/5 - the mango juice is a bit pricy for the amount that we get and doesn't taste all that special. The fully loaded waffle was fairly priced

Service 4/5 - quick in service and food was served quite quickly. 

Complaints: Cash only although it has an ATM machine but it's still inconvenient."}
{"text":"What initially drew me in about this spot was the buzz about everything served on waffles... it's true! And not just breakfast either - all burgers and sandwiches are served on waffles instead of bread/buns. The Monte Cristo is a must try and I'd say opt for the potato salad over the fruit as a side.

This is BUSY spot for weekend brunch (you will wait ages for a table) so I tend to opt for dinner or late night drinks. Take friends and enjoy the use of countless board games, good beer, and DEFINITELY try out the waffle bacon (the owners apparently spent countless hours perfecting how to cook the bacon into the waffle and I think they've certainly mastered it)... I suggest adding a side of whipped cream to up the gluttony factor.

Inside is a bit warm in summer and sometimes too loud, but if there aren't seats on the patio out front, head to the back - there is another!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised this place is as popular as it is. They don't know how to make waffles, and they have horrible service! We got the french toast waffles, they had absolutely no flavor were disgusting looking and raw inside (picture attached) save your money and go somewhere else"}
{"text":"Came here just before lunch time for some food right before the place filled up with guests. Even still it took a few minutes before we could be seated due to the fact that one girl was taking care of the entire restaurant on her own which is a lot for one person. Anyway, I ordered the Monte Cristo which was decently filling but nothing spectacular for the price; I had a chocolate peanut butter shake which I really enjoyed. Considering how much our server had to do, she did a good job of getting us our food, drinks and bill on time. I would come again if I am in the area but I think there are better brunch spots for the price to go to in Toronto."}
{"text":"I learned of The Starving Artist when I stumbled upon a picture of an Eggs Benedict on a waffle rather than on an English muffin. The image I saw intrigued me, and knew that I had to check it out for myself. An All-Day-Breakfast joint, and everything is made on a waffle? Sign me up! So I gave the Lansdowne location a call, and asked if they took reservations. They said no, but that they would try to accommodate my request, and will sit my party and I together if we arrive by 9:30am on a Saturday morning. This was still very early for me, but I wanted a pretty large group to sit together (8 of us). So I made everyone arrive by 9am, and as promised, they sat all of us together.

What I always have to get when I visit The Starving Artist is the peanut butter, chocolate and banana smoothie for $5. It is to die for! I also like to get the grilled cheese for $4-do note that the grilled cheese is made with processed cheese. I love it, but many may not like the \"processed\" aspect. I have also gotten the Waffle Bacon for $6 (bacon dipped in waffle batter then pressed in the waffle iron, served with real maple syrup) on more than one occasion. And of course, I always get the Benny! Something else I want to note is that they are quite flexible for those with allergies etc.

Also, there is a new location at 1078 St. Clair Ave. W. Review from BlogTo here. I have heard that the new location is not great, but maybe things have improved since they opened-always gotta give restaurants a bit of time to work out the kinks.

I loved The Starving Artist the first time I visited, but overtime it has lost its luster. I guess with so many brunch options in the city, I rather try a new place, than return for a waffle breakfast. Don't get me wrong, the food is tasty, but not tasty enough to make the trek on a regular basis.

{"text":"Who doesn't like an egg benedict on a waffle?  I don't come here often, but when I do I always get the Sammy Benny for lunch and it is YUMMY!  The food is always delicious and filling, and the service has gotten faster.  I also like the different artwork they put up every time I visit.  They have front and back patios open during summer, it gets really hot inside as they have no air condition.  The only off-putting thing is the fish tank there looks kind of dirty, I wouldn't sit near it."}
{"text":"Love this place! So happy they have expanded and now have 3 locations - I truly already miss the original Landsdowne location as I had been going there for years but luckily my house is inbetween that one, college and the st Clair location!! So lucky me I get delicious eggs Benedict on potato waffles whenever I please mmmmm mmm deliciousness"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday around the noon hour with some friends and my baby and the place was packed. We were seated surprisingly quick based on how busy the restaurant looked and our server was very accommodating in ensuring that we had space for my daughter who was in her car seat. 

I ordered the B Benny with side potato salad, both of which were super tasty. I would come back again and again for that alone, except that service was extremely slow. 

If you're craving something a little different, I would highly recommend this place, just make sure you're not in a rush to be anywhere afterwards"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time for brunch. Had to wait about 20 minutes to be seated, but once we were inside the service was fast. 

I ordered the Western on a waffle with avocado, which came with a side of fruit and salad. The salad didn't have much flavour but the waffles were delicious! So fluffy! 

It was definitely a great brunch spot with endless waffle options!"}
{"text":"MINI WAFFLES ARE CRAZY GOOD

I've ordered the Waffle Benny and Strawberry Craze...I didn't regret it. The waffles they make are amazingly delicious. I will definitely come back and try the other waffle dishes or even get the exact same dishes! Service was also very good and friendly! Must try if you're visiting from afar."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times but unfortunately the last time was not a good experience. Half of my meal (Monte Cristo) was accidentally thrown out after I asked for it to be packed up to go. They said they would make it again for me. All I got was a plain waffle. The ham, turkey and havarti cheese was missing. And I was charged full price for their mistake which was $17. Lesson learned."}
{"text":"Food was good! Not great but good enough that we would definitely go back. We ordered the Bennys. Service was ok too. We were there at around 11am and there were only 3 tables occupied. Might be the reason why we got good service compared to the other reviewers. 

By the way, they only accept CASH which sucks because I don't like bringing a lot of cash with me and I prefer to pay with plastic."}
{"text":"Waffles grilled cheese was the ultimate brunch item. But menu listed alcohol and apparently they don't have a liquor license so they don't serve it."}
{"text":"The best eggs benedict I've ever had. Seriously.
I had the B Benny. The potato waffles were amazing, I don't know how they make them but they're magic. A slight crisp on the outside and soft and potatoey on the inside. I loved the caramelized bacon, it's the perfect amount of sweet and savoury. The mixed greens paired well with the poached eggs and waffles, since they had a more acidic dressing on them which balance out the richer and savoury food. The fruits were fresh and sweet, making them a great way to finish the dish."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went here based on the fact she was craving for waffles that morning. We drove about 25-30 km to get to this place and boy, it was well worth it. It can be tough to get a seat but since it's a good place for brunch, people come and go quickly. I ordered the Hitchhiker which came with two mini waffles, four caramelized bacon strips, cheesy scrambled eggs with the choice of an assortment of fruit, potato salad or baked beans. The bacon strips were mediocre but WOWZA the waffles were amazing! (it is a waffle bar). My girlfriend ordered the Breakfast Benny and I could tell it was a popular item because I can hear nearby customers ordering the same item. It came with Potato Waffles, poached eggs, bacon with hollandaise sauce to top it all off. Potato waffles were OK but not GREAT. it just tasted like mashed potatoes in the form of a waffle. 

There are a lot of customization options: vegan/ gluten free as well as replacing bacon with avacado. 

Overall, I enjoyed the food. they have nice, random and comedic superhero paintings displayed all over. Their basic waffle is amazing and apparantly you can order a chicken club that's wrapped in waffles. This place is a must try for another who is around the area or whoever is happening to crave for waffles."}
{"text":"Delicious foodage!

Nice little patio too (too bad the rain sent us inside). 

I had the Breakfast Waffle (2 poached eggs, bacon, on top of 2 potato waffles) The potato waffles are gorgeous, could really taste the chives. Comes served with a green salad as well as your choice of potato salad, fruit salad or bakes beans.

Now I really want to go back and try the regular waffles. The guy next to us was eating blueberry ones and they looked tasty.

Waitress seemed a bit out of it (hungover?) - bringing someone else's bill to our table plus crashing some dishes around at another table, but otherwise was serving us in a very friendly manner."}
{"text":"Food was delicious,  staff was courteous and friendly. Short wait for food. Had the potato waffle with some egg and other stuff. Potato salad so good. Really want to try their spicy chicken meal. My friend said it was delicious.  Must try!!!"}
{"text":"I did not think I liked waffles. If you feel the same, try the potato waffles at Starving Artist and your life will change for the better. I had the Hitchhiker: two mini waffles (potato, please) and cheesy scrambled eggs. I substituted avocado for the bacon. The fruit that accompanied my meal tasted very fresh. My fellow diners also remarked on the fruit as they cleaned their waffle-filled plates. Busy, busy place but worth the wait."}
{"text":"Chose to come here for brunch on a Friday morning because I love waffles and I heard they serve waffle everything. Choosing a meal was hard but thank goodness for Yelp reviews. I opted for the Sammy Benny and my boyfriend got the B Benny, both with a side of fruits. I thought the salmon was a bit fishy, didn't have that smokiness I like. I did enjoy the potato waffle a whole lot more than the regular waffle so would recommend. It is a dollar charge to substitute a waffle for potato waffle however. 

There was only server working so service was slow throughout. Cash only as well. It's a nice bright restaurant close to where we live so we may come back for breakfast again to try the other waffle options but we're in no hurry."}
{"text":"I've been to Starving Artist Bar a few times, and have ordered a few things off the menu. Specifically, I can highly recommend the \"starving for vegan\" (the vegan waffles are fantastic) the \"starving for waffles\" (these are both breakfast meals with eggs, waffles, and fruit. I've also ordered the Waffle benny, which was delicious- the hollandaise was very very good. 

My boyfriend (who I usually go with) ALWAYS orders \"dessert\" for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Dessert generally consists of waffles, ice cream, chocolate chips (baked right into the waffles) fruit, and whipped cream. Intense. The portion is large (I couldn't finish it, but he always does) and they have real maple syrup, and the whipped cream is home-made (not from an aerosol can). Lastly, I've had the grilled cheese waffle sandwich there, and while I was slightly terrified at the thought of sweet and salty like that together-- it was easily the best grilled cheese sandwich I've ever had. 

The artwork they have on display is always fantastic, and the inclusion of boardgames is a nice touch (especially during dinner and drinks). 

The service is not awesome, but then again, they're always busy. I would, and certainly WILL go back."}
{"text":"The word to describe this place is RANDOM. It's in a converted house, on a residential street. I've never been for the breakfast/lunch thing - I've been here at night. This takes random to a whole new level.

They have live music and booze. It's a full on bar at night. In a house. On a residential street. RANDOM. But tres cool. It's a very comfortable spot, and a great little neighborhood hangout. A friend of mine lives around the corner and introduced me to the place. We went for desert one night. Or perhaps I should say, she went for dessert. I went for a pint. And was treated to a live band to boot.

I can't speak to the food, but she said it was delicious (something with banana in it). They had a good beer selection, so I was pleased. This place is kind of small and out of the way for a special trip from any kind of distance. But for anyone in Bloordale, Blandsdowne, and whatever else they call this neighborhood, I would definitely recommend checking it out. If for no other reason because I think the location and spot is kinda hilarious."}
{"text":"What would our trip to Toronto have been without this delightful nook of deliciousness?? Who is awesome enough to serve breakfast until 5pm??? And they make gluten-free waffles!?!!?? Not to mention, the best, most AUTHENTIC Americano I've had outside Italy!!!!

This little place is a gem. Nestled amongst a residential neighborhood (which seems to be a theme in Toronto, one that I love ps), you feel like you've really come to a secret local's place. I love the open \"bar\" concept where food is prepared insight at a bar-like counter. And the ample seating in the front patio is perfect for a late afternoon meal. But even if you sit inside, the floor to ceiling window that fully opens makes you feel like you're outside anyway, minus the wind messing up ya hair of course.

The Americano. It came in a double espresso cup, roughly 4oz, just as it should be served and is served across the world except for the US -_- I am so tired of getting a 24oz watered down cup of bitter nasty because a cafe owner failed to google 'how to make an americano'. Come on people. But Starving Artist does it right, and they do it deliciously. Coffee has an amazing taste and they know how to get that beautiful, creamy froth out of their espresso. If you love coffee, it's a must here. And even if you don't, now's your chance to start!

The food. We went here twice and since I'm not gluten-free, the first time we went I ordered regular wheat waffles and my girlfriend, who is, got the gluten-free. The second time, we wanted to share a savory and sweet so I got GF waffles as well. And I can honestly say, I preferred the GF to the wheat! I found them to actually be airier, lighter and crispier on the outside than the regular. And after eating half an order piled with eggs and a superb hollandaise, and half an order with Nutella and fruit, I appreciated not feeling weighed down by the waffles themselves. But either way, you honestly can't go wrong. And did I mention, they serve breakfast till 5?? We walked in unknowingly at 4:30 and were handed a breakfast menu to our great delight. How perfect was that?! Went back the very next day."}
{"text":"I've been to Starving Artist a number of times (Lansdowne location before it closed and once to the St Clair location) and thought I'd leave a review of my most recent visit.

The St. Clair location is really lovely - bright and airy and makes for a really nice atmosphere.  The staff is lovely - friendly and smiley :)

4 of us got there at 12:45pm on a Sunday, expecting a long wait, but we were seated fairly quickly.  The groups of 2 seemed to have a longer wait.

We all got waffle dishes of various kinds - the veggie waffle sandwich received a 6/10, the Hitchhiker got good reviews as did the breakfast benny (potato waffles). 

I got the B.Breakfast - potato waffles with poached eggs, candied bacon, hollandaise and chives, with a side of fruit and greens.   The eggs were perfectly poached, and the fruit was great.  The hollandaise was ok (I like it a little more lemony and flavourful).  Unfortunately, the mainstay of the establishment is the waffle, and in this case, the potato waffle.  I remember these being slightly larger and thinner and therefore crispier.  Today, it felt like I was eating mashed potatoes for breakfast.  

This may be ok for some, but the texture took away from my enjoyment of the meal.  Next time I'll get the regular waffles (I poached some from my mum's plate - so light and fluffy!)

My other gripe is with the vanilla almond latte.  It came in a tall glass (yay!) but was really watery, and not like a latte at all.  I suspect it was a watered down Americano with vanilla syrup and almond milk froth.  Very disappointing.   Had the 3 others I dined with not enjoyed their meals, I would have given this review 2 stars simply because of this terrible beverage.

Here's the question: will I go back?  Because it's close to both my yoga and spin studios, I suspect I will, but I certainly won't get the potato waffles or any lattes."}
{"text":"This is one of the first brunch places i tried when moving to Toronto.  Their potato waffles are amazing and the amount you get will keep you full till late dinner.  I would recommend to go a little earlier before the brunch rush because the line will be long and slow.

Their eggs benedict was delicious.  Kind of sad that they only had maple bacon as an option.  Would have preferred bacon that isn't sweetened."}
{"text":"One of my top 3 brunch places in the city. The mashed potato waffles are heaven on Earth."}
{"text":"Service is extremely slow, the waitress had green nail polish that was extremely cracked. When I tried to order a smoothie and cancel it before it was made, she did not cancel it and instead lied to me and said they already had made the smoothie when I watched them make it 5 minutes after I asked to cancel my order. I'm actually sitting here right now typing this review because it has taken that long for me to get my food, solid 35 minutes for eggs. Right now everyone in the room is complaining about the service. A table of two has had only one meal delivered and is waiting for his food. The food is coming out one by one. This waitress clearly needs a retrain and the staff are extremely inexperienced. This local is not  planning on returning any time soon."}
{"text":"Amazing! 
First let's start with the ambiance... They are a very casual hipster/dive bar/cafe with  board games in the back minus Snakes and Lattes $5 cover. Speaking of lattes though, theirs are insanely good; the  marshmallow latte is my fave and the even roast a marshmallow on top.

The nachos here are a little stoke of genius. Instead of piling the tortilla chips high and plopping toppings on to (creating an uneven and let's face it boring eating experience) they lay a layer of them on a baking sheet add the toppings and repeat. The result is goodness in every bite and no boring virgin chips buried at the bottom of the stack!

Ironically I am not too fussy on waffles (which is most of what thy serve). I've had one savory one in sandwich form and it was a bit on the soggy side underneath."}
{"text":"Mmm I really enjoyed the B Benny and the Chicken Bacon club.  The potato waffles are like mashed potatos cooked in a waffle iron, so the outsides are crisp while the insides are fluffy. The caramelized bacon compliments the eggs benny really well without being too sweet. The Chicken Bacon club was good, no extra seasoning or condiments needed, but the bottom waffle got soggy from sitting on the plate. I was surprised they had almond milk lattes as not many establishments offer almond milk, but the vanilla almond latte was good.The salad on the side could use a bit of balsamic vinegar though and my friend agreed that the mustard-y potato salad tasted exactly like Costcos.

The wait wasn't bad on a Thursday morning and there was a staff of two. The waitess was really friendly. Ask for the bill split first as she had to split the bill manually at the resgister for us (oops!)."}
{"text":"I'm sad that the Ossington location closed down, so we trekked south to this location where the hipster vibe is more pronounced. The food is still as good as ever and the seating is way more spacious. Cash only though, so be sure you got enough before you get in line!"}
{"text":"Went in on a Tuesday, great service and speed. The food - freaking incredible. We both had a variation on a Benny and could not believe those potato waffles. Got a regular waffle on the side and it made me want a second breakfast. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine who visited Toronto a few months before I did, recommend I checkout this place. It was AMAZING! By far one of my favorite places to eat in Toronto.

My friends and I stayed in the Entertainment District for Caribana. It was about a 20 min drive from us, but we for sure didn't mind it after we got there. 

The place is small so, expect a wait if they're busy. I believe we went on a Sunday morning and because it was 5 of us we waited about 20 mins.

I STRONGLY recommend the potatoe waffles. They are to die for. We were skeptical as Americans, but after we left it was all we talked about! The Waffle bacon wasn't that great because the bacon is so thin you can hardly taste it through the waffle. We also didn't like the beans with our breakfast but, that could just be us as Americans.

The mimosa was bomb! I can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Bacon Waffles with a side of whipped cream.

That should really be all I need to say about this place but I'll elaborate a little more.

No matter what time of day you come here you're going to have waffles. My friends and I started with a round of drinks but quickly ordered the bacon waffles (don't forget the side of whipped cream, seriously, don't). We were there fairly late in the evening but I needed something more substantial to soak up the doubles I was drinking as I hadn't had dinner. So I ordered the sliders.

These aren't just normal sliders, they're...you guessed it...waffle sliders. Instead of buns they use mini waffles. I was a little weary at first but took the plunge. Delicious. The side of potato salad was also really great.

The service was ok. The server seemed to get a little pre-occupied with a large group that showed up so it took a little longer than we would have liked to get another round. Also, when we were ready to go she passed by our table twice, noticing that we were done, but still didn't offer to bring the bill."}
{"text":"So I've never been to any of the starving artist locations before so this was my first experience at this very popular waffle spot. 

I got there at around 11 am with 3 other people. We waited in line for almost a damn hour. There was ONE server. I'm sure there should've been more but maybe someone called in sick? Regardless it was a mad house in there and they really need management in here to sort things out as things could've been a lot more efficient. Sitting parties of 2 at 4-seater tables for example, ugh! No one should have to wait an hour for brunch!!! Anyway I felt bad for the one server she was so busy and tried her best. 

I ordered the loaded potato waffles which were two potato waffles with cheese bacon and sour cream. It was damn delicious!!!! Very filling and tasty but the side salad it came with was weak. Wilted greens with barely any dressing. 

With better service and a little more effort on the sides dishes (salad and fruit) this place would be amazing. The waffles live up to the hype but would not go back if I had to wait an hour to sit."}
{"text":"Sandwiched between rows of houses this little gem if a restaurant is totally worth the trek. Highly recommend their potato waffles, and be prepared to stand in line for the brunch rush."}
{"text":"If you want to eat waffles for brunch, this place is for you. if you don't, go somewhere else because everything on the menu here, sweet or savory, is served in, on, or with waffles. The waffles are done well, but everything else here that goes with the waffles, from the eggs to the bacon to the hollandaise is pretty generic and underwhelming. Like others have mentioned, the poached eggs look like they were microwaved in a mold and they taste OK only. Presentation is nice but again, nothing here that sets it apart from some of the better brunch places in the area. The place also seems very popular with the 12-15 age range for some reason, so take what you want away from that. 

Food 3/5
Service 3/5
Atmosphere 2/5
Decor 3/5"}
{"text":"Service wasn't the best, but food was really tasty.
I don't like to mess with classics, but I thought Starving Artist's version of eggs benny on potato waffles were really delicious. Extremely rich, though. My order was the Hitchhiker - which was also great.

The service was a little lackluster. The food took a while to arrive, and when I ordered a coffee I was brought an Americano and told \"this is our coffee\". I didn't really get a heads up on that, I might've asked for something different! Luckily I really enjoyed the Americano so I wasn't too bothered. All in all: tasty food, OK service, will return but only if I'm in the area. We went out of our way to try this place because we loooove breakfast :)

Also, a lot of the dishes are waffle-y. I'm not a waffle guy, more of a savory breakfast lover. So... if you're into waffles... you might wanna give STarving ARtist a go"}
{"text":"I honestly had an overall negative experience here. The food, to be fair, was decent for the price, but the service was absolutely tragic. We had to wait almost 30 minutes for the staff to make 3 waffles, and the server, scotty,  ignored us for most of our stay at starving artist. In addition, the entire wait staff was super awkward and everytime they interacted with us I felt very uncomfortable (long pauses in between responses etc.) In addition, in the end, it took them about 15 minutes to tell us that they didn't take credit cards and another 15 minutes for them to take our money. In addition the water served was just from the sink which was disappointing. Overall, the horrible service negated the quality of the food resulting in one out of five stars"}
{"text":"Great for brunch, love their breakfast Benny, I'd recommend as the side you stick with the fruit, the potato salad tastes like store bought..must try both the potato and bacon waffles, they are both amazing."}
{"text":"Another brunch....another great experience!  Love the Hitchhiker and the berry fruit flavoured tea is awesome when you are caffeine'd out!"}
{"text":"Massive potato waffle stacked with veggies. Super yummy and enough to share. Only reason why it gets a four is because ambience could be better. Super friendly staff."}
{"text":"Just north of Bloor and Lansdowne, Starving Artist's got more waffles than an economists convention. I dare you to not ingest a waffle here. If you open your mouth, there is a 73% chance that a waffle will fall in. Seriously.

It's bigger than it seems inside, with tables going all the way back. And though it wasn't yet set up, their front patio was tantalizing. The decor inside is probably best described as Hipster Gaufre. I dug the heavily tagged plaster lions, the endless waffle kitsch, and the pyramid of breakfast cereals. (Kellogg's I might add.)

Their brunch menu features the wafer-iron-wonder in a bevy of transmogrifications. There are bennies, mini-waffles with fruit, potato waffles, gluten-free waffles, even something called waffle bacon. For me the choice was obvious: smoked salmon eggs benedict on mini waffs. Pretty, pretty, pretty fantastic. With a side of baked beans in maple syrup it was a breakfastacular combination. We washed it all down with a monster-sized french press; $5! (Also: try the PB and B smoothie. It's thicker than a kid on a football scholarship.)

Service was polite, but deliberately paced. They do have debit here, but after a few failed attempts we scrounged together some cash. You have to wait for your bill here (and you will wait) but you pay at the counter. Everyone who works here is also much cooler than you. Don't feel bad about it.

Oh, and apparently, this place is also a hot little spot at night which would explain the full bar and Amsterdam brews on tap. I wonder if they crank those waffle irons after dark too... 
 
Obligatory Title Pun: WAFL-copters!

Menu Readability: A typewriter font I'm none too fond of, but it's plenty readable.

Need to mention: No parking on Paton Rd from midnight to 7pm. Figured this out the hard way.

What this place teaches me about myself: I now officially hate the word \"waffle.\""}
{"text":"3.5/5 stars. 

It's a decent brunch place. We waited for 45 minute before getting a place to sit down - your typical brunch wait. 

They're definitely known for their potato waffle (B. Benny).  It's actually just okay - definitely not bad but it's kind of like a mashed potato with the poached egg. A little too mushy for my liking in terms of texture. The potato salad and salad that came with was decent too. I don't think this was amazing by any means. The potato waffle was just worth trying but it's not absolutely mind blowing. Service was good. No refills for coffees (only Americanos). 

Cash only."}
{"text":"After returning from a trip, we made a decision to be brunch-venturous.  Let's hit up some new places!  & so - we ventured into the land of waffles.

No disappointment here.  We got here around noon, feeling a bit lazy & thinking we would have to wait but we snuck in right before the crowds arrived.  Turns out we weren't the only ones who slept in!

My Waffle Benny was delicious - light fluffy waffles in place of where english muffins might normally be.  The poached eggs were eerily perfect in shape & texture.  Their Hollandaise wasn't as zing-y as I prefer but as I've mentioned I'm a fan of zest until the bitter end...

Great Americano(s), smiley service.  Bring your epi-pen - there are bees a-plenty (I blame the syrup)."}
{"text":"Really close to the subway station by the same name as the street. It's in the middle of a residential district but was very busy. There's a front and rear patio, though there were a lot of wasps about. The inside was very hot-the doors were wide open and there was a big fan so no AC I'm guessing. 
The food was good though! Big portions! I got 4 mini waffles ($7) with bananas ($2) and strawberries ($2). It came with a side of fruit and a side salad both of which were fresh and good. I got one of the simpler dishes but there are some creative waffles including a waffle eggs Benedict. I recommend the place for breakfast, just perhaps go when it's not so hot/humid."}
{"text":"I have to say, I was apprehensive about stopping in given their pretty poor Yelp grade, but I was really happy with my brunch! 

My friend and I wandered in after Emma's was closed unexpectedly for an electrical problem. The line was pretty long but moved fast; we were sitting at a cozy corner table with coffee in under 30 minutes. Score! 

Everything on the menu at Starving Artist is either contained within, or on top of, a waffle (genius). I decided on the Breakfast Waffles: two mini potato waffles topped with caramelized bacon, poached eggs and (what else?) maple syrup. Each of the egg dishes is served with salad and your choice of fruit or potato salad (I went with the fruit). Everything was delicious. The bacon was crisp and the perfect mix of sweet and savory, the eggs were poached to perfection and the waffle melted in my mouth. We tried a mini S'Mores Waffle for dessert - nothing special - but a tasty bite to finish the meal. 

We had great, speedy service and tasty dishes with lots of flavor. Give the St. Clair branch another go! I certainly will."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: Please note, this post is a few months delayed, things may have changed since.

I used to go out for brunch on a regular basis.  My first experience with Starving Artist was at their old Lansdowne location, north of Bloor.  The place was always, always, (reiterating again) always packed!  It was definitely worth it.

The Potato waffles always go amazing with the Eggs Benny!

At the St. Clair location, I agree with previous yelp posts. The food takes a long time to arrive at your table, much longer than we used to wait at the Lansdowne location."}
{"text":"Great waffles (waffle bacon says it all).  Great selection, including gluten free and both soy and almond milk for coffee. Never knew you could do so many different and delicious things with waffles."}
{"text":"Great food, great music, great decor, but TERRIBLE service. Stood at the entrance for 15 min before anyone greeted us, then waited another 15 min before a waiter came to our table. The waiter was also super unfriendly and unaccommodating. We had to wait another 30 min before we were acknowledged to ask for the check. Would not recommend to anyone who values customer service."}
{"text":"There need to be more reviews for this place - I demand it! Highly overlooked brunch spot, and one of two reasons to ever get off at Lansdowne station (Ciro's being the other: http://www.yelp.ca/biz/ciros-toronto). Step over the vagrants that are loafing outside the station and head north a block or two, and you will have arrived.

This is a gourmet waffle cafe with many, many options that will satisfy even the most diehard waffle enthusiast. I've enjoyed The Hitchhiker ($10), which includes scrambled eggs with cheddar cheese, caramelized bacon (I subbed for tomato and avocado slices) and two waffles. I was not a fan of the potato salad (to be fair, I never really am, unless it's my own**), but everything else was on point. There's also a Waffle Benny ($9 for exactly what it sounds like), an AYCE special ($15) and a host of other menu items if (for some reason) you're not in the mood for waffles.


The owners, Tobias and Bryan, are two affable fellows who you'll immediately want to befriend. They play cool music, interesting movies backdrops like the Video Director series, and create all of the photography you see on the walls. They run the show here and do everything from tidying your table to plating your food. They're always trying out new things on the menu and you can even send in suggestions for different waffle types on their website - UGC at its finest!

Cash only, last time I checked.

{"text":"This place is quite the spurlge. The eggs Benny are wonderfully some shaped. I really think that it was amazing at how perfect the Benny's turned out. I went for the salmon Benny without any capers and my spouse went for the breakfast Benny made with potatoes in the waffles. Both came with a waffle base instead of a English muffin. After brunch, we had a latte and a cappuccino which were very well made. It came with great sides some salad and a choice of fruit, beans or potato salad. Though the service is kind of slow and there is a lot of people. This is kind of a lazy Sunday kind of venture.

I can't wait to come back to give it 5 stars."}
{"text":"Food was great.  coffee was strong.  CASH ONLY .. atm on the premise.  Service is a little slow which is 4 vs 5. Otherwise love the atmosphere"}
{"text":"THEY DO NOT USE REAL MAPLE SYRUP 
they are a Canadian waffle house and they use fructose corn syrup!!!!! 
THEY ARE A WAFFLE HOUSE AND THEY USE FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP. 
Its so sad, the waffles are not bad but having to put that garbage on my waffles is shameful. 

Also today when i went in there was a half dead cockroach on the floor beneath me. 
the service is okay, the food is good besides THIS SIN 

Literally anytime mentions Starving artist to me they inform me that they do not use real maple syrup. 

cheap. cheap cheap."}
{"text":"Love the food here! Eggs benny with smoked salmon and potatoes waffles was amazing!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great place to go with a friend or small group of people. Great options for waffles they have a variety of sweet and savoury on the menu. Decor is nice and the servers are amazing! Sometimes the food is great and sometimes it's alright, it depends on who makes it I think. But it's a good place overall!"}
{"text":"This is a response to a recent experience I had overhearing someone deal with a server at this resto. It was not only rude, it was over the line and made me feel like posting a review, which I never do. 

I was at the table next to you on Sunday, and heard you complain loudly and belittle the waitress that, tried as she might to please you, could do little to gain your respect or thanks.

You had to wait 20 mins. Guess what, we all had to wait. It's Sunday, and it's brunch in Toronto - welcome. You had a child with you, and they were hungry. The waitress sat you at the bar and got you drinks, a free waffle for your child to tide them over, and got your food order in, all while you sat and waited. Not so bad I'd say. Even thoughtful and kind.

And then you got your food, finished it, and then complained again to her that it wasn't good, but only after you ate most of it. Hey, I know it's all about you, but you really should try to serve people one day, and get a taste of humanity. It's a life lesson and it teaches you that we're all trying our best, and none of us in the centre of the universe.

Just try to be decent. It goes a long way."}
{"text":"Worth the wait! The st Clair location is pretty big but the line made its way outside even in -20 degrees. Everything is on waffles (which is great) and you cant go wrong with savoury or sweet. The service is friendly and pretty fast. It's a good experience overall!"}
{"text":"An interesting concept - to serve everything on waffles.  I ended up getting spicy chicken on waffles because the server said the portion was large and because i was so hungry.  I wasn't sure if the fusion of waffles and spicy chicken as a sandwich would work.  After trying it, my verdict is... meh.  The waffles served as a sponge and absorbed the spicy sauce, so i was cutting into a soggy messy fare.  Just not my thing.  It also came with a choice of fruits or potato salad.  I chose potato salad.  That was good.  We ordered mimosa, and the server brought a bottle of sparkling wine and a bottle of orange juice.  It was up to us to fill our glasses.  My friends and i were like... what should the portion be, so we decided to split 50-50 between the wine and the juice.  
So the service was bare minimum.  And the table we were assigned to had a napkin laying around underneath that should have been picked up when they cleared the table.  The servers were trying to play the role of starving artists i guess with holes in sweaters and generally looking like they couldn't afford to do anything about their appearance.  But for me as a diner, i just prefer eating in a clean, presentable environment.
Last thing.  They take cash only."}
{"text":"The Starving Artist combines all day breakfast foods on waffles with a contemporary artistic atmosphere showcasing work from local artists here in Toronto. Seeing that I am a huge fan of chicken and waffles that was the first thing I looked for on their menu. After all, how can anyone go wrong with the chicken and waffles classic?! If you like brunch and waffles as much as I do for breakfast, lunch and dinner, and want to support the city's local artists, this place is worth checking out!

Get there early or be prepared to wait for a table. Service is also not the quickest, and the servers needed to be prompted for water and when we were ready to order. Food also took a while to be served to us."}
{"text":"I decided to go here for an afternoon brunch with my friends, they supposedly had good reviews, but when I walked in at 3:07 we were directed to our table by a far from friendly wide hipped, curly haired waitress. It took her at least 10 minutes to bring us our cups for the water, with no straws may I add. I asked for lemon to go with my water, and she completely ignored me. It was the first time my group has ever been there so everyone was asking questions about the food; and again the waitress was being extremely disrespectful. So we finally got our order in at 3:17. I kid you not it our food came at 4:07. Remember this place is a waffle place. Waffles by nature take only 5 minutes to makes. When we got our food serviced, I asked the server why did it take an hour to come. She had the nerve to tell me it took 20 minutes and they marked our time down. Even in a busy Resturant like jackastors it doesn't take that long to get food. Then she went to the manager, the manager looked at me and turned away. I swear if it wasn't for the fact that there is so many racial problems right now, I would have went off in there. But non the less I was one West Indian female with three Somali women. We would have been charged just for asking for a discount. 

So my recommendation, don't ever go there unless you want to be treated less then.

Btw...  I USED THEIR WIFI TO WRITE THIS REVIEW"}
{"text":"Like short reviews that get straight to the point? Here's one!!

You a waffle person?? Go Starving Artist!! You'll be waffly impressed with the varieties of waffles you can waffle down!!

Great waffles served by charming people, people!"}
{"text":"Sitting in one of the most awkward neighborhoods in Toronto - a place where you can order waffles topped with pretty much any of your favorite things. They have amazing coffee/espresso, a cute little licensed patio in the front, and to my surprise...another patio in the back. I was reasonably stuffed, but not overly so, after downing a \"waffle benny\" - poached eggs, caramelized onions and bacon - with a side of beans and salad. Scrumptious!"}
{"text":"This newest location of Starving Artist is located at Davisville and Mount Pleasant, an 8-10 min walk away from Davisville subway station. I was introduced to Starving Artist many years ago at their former Lansdowne location. I had a great experience the first time I went and was excited to try out Starving Artist again at their new location. The place is not big but is suitable for families and very kid friendly. The vibe is relaxing and laid back with friendly service. 

I headed to brunch on a Saturday and arrived at the restaurant around 12:30pm. The place was bustling with customers enjoying their various waffle dishes and my boyfriend and I had to wait around 15 min to get a table. Service was good although it did take them a while to give us water and our coffees. Other than that, the waffle dishes we ordered came at a reasonable time. I ordered the waffle benny while my boyfriend got the monte cristo waffle sandwich. My waffle benny was delicious and came with a side salad and fruit. My boyfriend's monte cristo was filled with ham, turkey and Havarti cheese. We had no complaints about the food and enjoyed our brunch. They also had dessert waffles which looked tempting but we were too full to try them.

Overall, the Starving Artist is a solid place for brunch if you are in the mood for waffles."}
{"text":"Went there today around 1pm with my friend. There were a few empty tables when we first arrived and more people arrived shortly after. The food was excellent but the service was below par. When the food arrived there were no utensils that came with it. We raised our hands up for more than 5 minutes and the waitress never came even though she saw our hands raised. My friends had to go up to ask her for utensils and water, and she still ignored my friend for a few minutes before she actually gave the utensils and water to us; the waitress had my friend bring them to our table which is unacceptable considering it's a full service restaurant. The waitress also wasn't the most polite and was quite emotionless; her speed is comparable to a sloth. When other people came, there were many tables that were not cleaned up, so the guests themselves had to move plates to another table, seat themselves and grab their own menus; some people also left after waiting for more than 10 minutes for a seat at the empty tables. I would've given this place a four star if she atleast greeted us and apologized for the issues that came up. They need more staff on shift."}
{"text":"As a waffle-fiend this place was an absolute dream.
Everything on the menu is waffle-centric while being super accessible (a great variety of gluten-free and vegan stuff).
I had the breakfast sandwich which, while delicious, was a bit small for my ferocious appetite so I would recommend getting one of their full plates. None the less, everything was really affordable by brunch standards.
The one thing I would love to see here is more breakfast cocktails- the really really spicy caesar was divine and I think they could totally up their boozy brunch game with more options."}
{"text":"I came here because I saw amazing photos of this place on Instagram so I decided to have brunch here. 

The lady who served us was very nice and patient when it came to taking our order but once we received our food we rarely saw her, especially when we needed extra plates and napkins. 

I ordered the Starving 4 Waffles with Nutella and Strawberries. It was not bad but not the best, it was average. I also ordered a chocolate milkshake and I didn't like it that much because it tasted like it was just room temperature chocolate milk with Whipped Cream on top. 

The place was very spacious, bright and the decor was pretty. 

Overall, I think the place is only good for taking pictures (food and decor wise). I would only recommend the place if you're looking to take pictures and eating ok waffles."}
