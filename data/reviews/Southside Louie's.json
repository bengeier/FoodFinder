{"text":"Yesterday we were at A Taste of Little Italy and had lunch on the extended patio. I had Chicken Alfredo with mushrooms which was a good size portion and excellent. Teena had lasagna which looked good. It was a lunch sized portion. Teena liked it.

The beer selection is not great, aside from Steam Whistle the rest were all big brewery beers. Places with pub atmospheres like this should have a better beer selection with at least 2 or 3 craft beers on tap.

Service was great though and we were well looked after. I woould go back."}
{"text":"I am surprised this place has such good reviews.

There are about 10837 better places within a two min walk of this place.

The food is lousy, the service is slow, the place is dingy. 

The only thing it has going for it is a fireplace in the back."}
{"text":"Bar correct pour avoir votre dose de chicken wings et  pintes de guiness.
C'est un endroit cool pour ramener son groupe de potes et voir les derniers matchs.
PS: ils ne prennent pas la debit card.


Decent joint to have your fix of chicken wings and pint of guiness. 
It's a cool place to bring your group of friends and watch the game.
PS : they don't take debit."}
{"text":"For all the bars and restaurants along this stretch of College Street, there aren't many places where you can settle in for drinks with friends for a few hours. Until Cornerstone opened in June, South Side Louie's was the only pub around. For this reason, I've been here dozens of times for Friday office lunches or after 5 pints. 

Service at Louie's has always been very friendly. One waitress in particular,  that lovely Irish lady, seems to form a special bond with my work crew

You can expect the typical taps for pints and pitchers: Guinness, Smithwicks, Boddingtons, Stella and a few non-imports. The food menu offers reliable pub grub: burgers, pizza and salad lunch specials, nachos, fajitas and so on. 

South Side Louie's is my recommendation for a causal, comfortable pint in Little Italy."}
{"text":"I moved into the area last year and as much as I love all the restaurants and bars that Little Italy boasts, I'm a pub girl at heart...so how excited I was when I happened upon this place after a TFC game when looking for a place to just relax and have a pint.

I've been back several times since then...almost always to watch a soccer game and have some pub grub.  The food is tasty - nothing amazing but good - and the service has always been extremely friendly and responsive.  My friend and I went in one day to watch a TFC game, not realizing there was a Leaf game on, which not surprisingly in Toronto takes precedence, but the staff actually re-arranged some seating so the two of us (and 2 other girls who came in) could watch the game on 2 of their TVs.  So nice.

A nice, relaxing pub with friendly patrons who are locals...which very few places in Little Italy can say these days.  Try it out!"}
{"text":"Southside Louie's is a great pub/restaurant in the College Little Italy area. The strip is laden with places to wine and dine and Southside's is a great option if you want cheap and tasty food. 

 It is a no frills kind of place, with a great patio in the summer time facing College Street, perfect for a drink and people watching. Southside Louie's is also the perfect place to grab some grub and watch the Leafs of Raptors on game night. The atmosphere is casual and friendly and the food is always comforting.

 The menu is stacked with everything from Italian, to burgers and fish and chips, and all sorts of basic pub food. Good thing is, the food tastes great and isn't as greasy as most traditional pubs. One of my favourites here is the fajitas. If you don't know what to order when looking through the massive menu: go with the fajitas and you can't go wrong!

 Southside's servers are also always smiling and warm and I think their service sets them apart from many places on College that kinda turn your nose at you if you don't look the part. You don't have to even think about that at Southside Louie's. A definite hit in my restaurant palate! Try it out!"}
{"text":"It's a dive bar, and a thumpin good one. Service is friendly (provided you don't piss anyone off), food is good for the type of venue and deals are plentiful ($5 daily sandwich specials, half-price appetizers for a decent stretch of time, 4-6 if I'm not mistaken). The clientele is as much a draw as anything else; if you don't go in with a friend, you'll leave with several new ones.

A fine (if cramped) front patio only adds to the charm. It's a place of character, and you'll love coming in (especially when Donna is working, the day shift every weekday)."}
{"text":"This place is terrible. I went here for brunch on a Saturday morning. I waited 10 minutes for my Caesar; 25 minutes for my brunch which they got wrong and my order was cold. They said they would have to make me new eggs but I had to ask that they at least not leave my breakfast on the bar getting cold while they did that. Sheer incompetence! They then reheated my breakfast with eggs over easy. Ever had reheated toast? Sucks! After they screw up my order at least they could splurge for the cost of new toast, sausages and home fries. And this was their second chance as my previous experience with this place was a bust as well. My advice...pass."}
{"text":"Dive bar with meh food. Good for a bunch of pints or to chill out.

There are some TV's there so would be good to catch a hockey game (if hockey ever starts again). I was here with a bunch of friends and the service was good, beer was cold and the place is devoid of pretention. Pretty sound. 

Would be good for a local end of day pints but wouldn't be super excited to head back."}
{"text":"We had a late lunch today at Southside Louie's.

It was during the Taste of Little Italy.  We sat on the patio so had a great view of everyone walking around.

I had lasagna and my husband had chicken with alfredo sauce, chicken and mushrooms.  The lasagna was good, though a small portion.  It was $7 ... I would have ordered two servings had I known the size/portion.

Our server was very attentive and we had fun on the patio."}
{"text":"If you live in Little Italy and need a good neighbourhood bar, this is the place.  Lots of perfectly placed TV sets to catch the Leafs, Guinness on tap, and no pretension.  You can hang out there in your ripped jeans and fave hoodie and fit in perfectly.  It's probably the only way to meet your actual neighbours in that area, and not the Thurs-Sat invading 905ers, short of waiting for the streetcar in the morning.

The best feature, by far, are the bar staff.  In the past, bar tenders were jovial, observant, and could fill in for your shrink at a moment's notice.  Somewhere along the way, all that became required was a Smart-Serve certificate and a pretty face.  At Southside Louie's, you get the perfect pint every time, a warm welcoming smile, an ear, and the best service I've ever had at a pub.  

Oh, and naked photo hunt.    Almost forgot the naked photo hunt console.  How can you go wrong?"}
{"text":"Cool little bar that my friend has introduced me to.  The staff is friendly there.  Nothing special inside... it's a bar..."}
{"text":"Oh for the love of god.  I somehow ended back up here again to have some drinks with some friends and unfortunately had to use their bathroom.  Again, 3 months later, water leaking out of the ceiling in the women's bathroom into a plastic tray that was filled with unsightly yellowy water.  And, while I was washing my hands, some water dripped from the ceiling out of a bubble, on to my head.  SHUDDER!!!  I'm worried that the entire floor is going to collapse from rot.  

And this time around, staff were not very friendly.  What's going on here?"}
