{"text":"I got a Hawaiian and a Spicy pizza here. Two 12\" for $31 all in. eeeeep.

But I was taken aback by how heavy the pies were, $31 is an OK price. Not amazing, but OK.

Regardless, this place has gotten a bit better. Ingredients less salty. Sauce much more subtle. Crust improved. Decent cheese. But the spicy pizza was bland. The hawaiian was bland as well. If you're bland, you gotta be greasy, which this pie was not.

I will return, but only if I am not feeling Varsity Pizza or Panago."}
{"text":"I have never ordered a pizza from here, I have only stopped in for by the slice goodness. 

Small pizza joint, not aimed at sitting down. They have a by the slice thing and the rest is take out/delivery. There are usually a few kinds of by the slice 'za kicking around at lunch time, I usually stick to the usual suspects: hawaiian, pep, or cheese. I have to agree, the sauce is not great - it's too sweet and lacks the flavour required to compliment such a nice crust. There's nothing really wow about this stuff, other than the fluffy crust. If you're down with that - down with carb city - and want a filling lunch that will stave off the 3:30pm hunger pangs (and replace them with carbo groggines), this place has got you covered. 

There's really no where to sit, they have a few chairs for waiting but I would feel odd eating there. Plan to get this on a nice day so you can pull up a patch of grass, or take it back to work, or take it away....

Convenience trumps here (its a quick walk from work) - and budget prices! $5.50 for 2 filling slices and a can o' soda."}
{"text":"Stopped in after an appointment at this plaza to check this place out. The guy behind the counter, \"Z\", very friendly and helpful. We were just looking for a slice to split, hubby and I and the choices were - pep, cheese and Hawaiian. We chose the Hawaiian and Z commented how small that one looked and gave us another one for free! What a guy! 2 nice sized pieces for $2.50 total. Will come back. I liked the cheese on this pizza, thick but not too heavy, they didn't skimp and it wasn't at all runny! I despise runny cheese! The sauce was OK (I always crave more of a kick to pizza sauces) but plentiful the way I like it and the crust was thick and fluffy. For a higher price you can order a gluten-free pizza here I was told. No whole wheat though for me (my preference) so, this place has to lose a star. Harsh I know...!
There are 4 or so swivel chairs at the window but not my style of dining, would take- out as we did today or have the pizza delivered. Z said they offered city-wide delivery even for us in the far NW. Impressed, left happy, appreciated."}
