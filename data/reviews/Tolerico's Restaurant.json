{"text":"It was not bad, but definitely not worth the price.  $75 for three people for a couple chicken parms and lasagna.  Food- Lasagna was okay, took a bite of my friends, not terrible but nothing to write hoe about. Chicken parm was very good! Not drenched in sauce, very nice light crunchy and flaky breading, very good.  We got fettuccine on side for the chicken parm, it was okay a little bland, but i have certainly had worse.  I went here without reading other reviews because we were traveling and it came up on siri and we wanted Italian.  I can say, reviews about the hard bread were spot on, man how can you go to an Italian restaurant and not get some good bread!? Very disappointing.  Probably the least desirably thing were the fruit flies all over...not appetizing at all.  If they cleaned up the place and got some fresh bread it would go a long way, and give a little more value for the prices.  At those prices, we should have needed to take a doggy bag, like old school Italian restaurants with big old mom style portions."}
{"text":"this place has gotten weirder and weirder. Any time we've dined we've been one of two or maybe three customers. food is mediocre. not worth the visit."}
{"text":"We were here Saturday for dinner. We tried to go Friday night, but was told the grill was closed so they were only serving pasta & pizza. (My boyfriend wanted a burger.) Now, mind you, it was only just after 9p, & they were open till 2a.  Appetizers was ok. We're not big provolone fans, so the cheese sticks - or rather fingers! - were ok. The marinara sauce it came with was excellent though. We both opted to get the chicken noodle soup with our meal. The soup didn't look like what we were used to, & smelled a bit rancid. So we didn't eat it. When our entrees arrived, my boyfriend was disappointed that he had more meat sauce than angel hair pasta. And, the sauce was not the same as the one we ate with our cheese sticks. However, my seafood alfredo pasta was just as good as I remembered it. So, I was very happy. We were surprised that we were the only ones there on the restaurant side. So, it was nice & quiet."}
{"text":"We were here for a family event, only used the event room, and we're served a buffet meal. The server was wonderful and the stuffed shells and salad were good. The rest of the food was eh, and not much in the way of drinks was provided. Also, the ambience was lack luster. Not that I was expecting anything amazing, but everything was bland and uninviting. I wouldn't mind coming back to try out the bar and regular service.  However, I can't give the restaurant more than 3 stars at the moment. Not sure I would hold a gathering there."}
{"text":"We gave this place one more try after two mediocre meals over the past couple years. This was definitely the last time we waste our time and money. First off, we had to wait in the entry at the hostess station to be seated for way too long, having to smell the cigarette stench from the adjacent bar area. After being seated, we were handed menus that were worn and disgusting. The pasta entrees were overpriced and bland and were served without bread. I asked for bread and after 10 minutes, some stale generic Italian bread arrived.  Save your money and avoid this place."}
{"text":"We came here on Mother's Day. There was virtually no staff on hand to an almost full dining room. The hostess was working as the waitress, and maybe even cooking the food too. There were two people on staff...on a holiday...at a restaurant. When we ordered off of their very small menu, they did not have the ingredients to make two of the dishes, which of course were the dishes we wanted. My food, my sisters food, and my fathers food was all bland. If I'm being honest, I will probably never come back here again. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Tolericos might be a better place to go hang for the bar, however i the 3 times I've eaten there I wasn't impressed.  For the price of the entrees didn't speak money they charge.  I had the scallops once and they tasted like beer...I don't know why but I didn't like it. The dining room is cute tho"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a sad example of poor management and worse ownership. I remember when the restaurant first opened and it was actually busy and clean. Now your lucky to see someone in the dining room and the entire restaurant smells like smoke. The closed bar offers patrons the option to smoke and trust me the door to the bar does nothing to keep that smell out of the rest of the restaurant. The bar may be the only reason that this place is still hanging on. The walls, carpet and linens are dirty and stained. The wall sconces in the \"banquet room\" are broken or missing all together! Very sad!!!!!! Please do not waste your time!!!"}
{"text":"Service was great. Food was awful. Everything was raw. Zucchini was a grease pit. Seafood had no taste. I came because a coworker recommend it. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Great service, food, and atmosphere. We had a party of 20 people for our grandma's birthday and they made it feel like home!"}
{"text":"As a prior Restaurant owner and someone who has been in the industry for 20+years, I am not sure why this place is able to stay open. I do understand that the bar does a great business. If your content with the bar business, get rid of the restaurant and open a sports bar. I have been giving the restaurant the benefit of the doubt for years. We arrive at any given day or hour of operation to see maybe two tables at the most in the dining room area. They do make a really great Turkey Devonshire which is the only reason to visit but, I have been disappointed with all the other menu items the family and I have tried. It has been mediocre at best. I am not a smoker and sitting in the bar area is out of the question. I don't recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"The best way to describe this place is grungy. My car club met here because one of our members remembered that it was moderately priced and had a quiet back room where we could talk.   When entering the main dining room you are greeted by the smell of cigarette smoke leaching in from the well attended attached bar area. Strike 1.  The main dining area was virtually empty spare 1 group. Odd for 7Pm on a Thursday evening. Soon I would understand why. We could have easily have had our meeting out there but it looked pretty run down anyway. We would have heard each other very well But we were escorted into the even dingier dungeon of the back room where we were presented with dirty well worn menus. They was a small swarm of little gnats flying around and Had my wife been with me at this point she would've got up and left. Strike 2.  I ordered a large chicken parm sub and honestly half would have been enough. (None would have been better!). On the side were lots of crinkle cut potato chips. The breading on the chicken was course and too much tomato sauce made the Italian bread soggy and hard to pick up. I washed this down with a cold bottle of Miller lite.   The unpleasant waitress brought our separate checks out without asking if we even wanted another beer. She seemed perturbed when we told her we weren't done and a couple of us ordered another beer. Strike 3!  My guess is that the only thing keeping this dump in business is the bar revenue. Overall it is badly in need of renovation and raising the caliber of the food and customer service. It appeared to me that the owners just didn't care.   I would not go back here and wouldn't recommend it to anybody."}
{"text":"Food was ok service was horrible. We sat in the bar area. One bartender to take care of the entire area. Took awhile for us to even get drinks or menus and then took even longer before were asked if we wanted more drinks. My husband sat there with an empty glass for 15 min. We felt very uncomfortable the entire time we were eating dinner. Only give it a one star rating because it makes me give a rating"}
{"text":"Hi, I had to write after reading some of the other reviews.  My husband and I go here an average of once every 1 1/2 wks to 2 wks.  We had actually boycotted it for a while, as the bill made a point of identifying the \"Onorato tax\" on my husband's wine purchases, and then we found them on a list of those restaurants not paying the tax (i.e., CHARGING it and LAYING BLAME, but not actually PAYING).  That situation has since been rectified, and we're going again.  One user had commented on bad service (a review that was sequestered -- I forget the term that Yelp uses, but you had to put in a CAPTCHA code to see).  I have to admit, on occasion, we have had or observed less than stellar service.  I waitressed for years, so I differentiate between being new, being overwhelmed, and being bad.  I'm VERY patient with the first two, and have little patience for the third.  Given that we go so often, those who we have seen who have been truly bad, we don't usually see a second time.  Others we have seen stay for a long time, and they are very good -- remember our drinks, remember when we were there last and make us feel welcome, without being overbearing (some places, when you start to go a lot and the servers recognize you, they start to get too familiar and it's hard to have a private conversation -- never the case here -- nice mix of being friendly, but not hovering and chitchatting).  The food is homey, we rarely have to wait, and if we do, it's rarely more than 20 minutes.  On a few occ'ns, our food took a while, but we've never been unhappy with what we have gotten.  The bread (Mancini's???) is delicious and they are generous with it.  We have never had a complaint with anything we've had, although if they are out of bread, the rolls don't do too much for me.  The housemade balsamic vinagerette is delicious.  I crave it sometimes.  All in all, the vast majority of times, our service is good to excellent, as is our food, for what it is (strombolis, salads, burgers -- GREAT burgers, etc.).  Service on occ'n is lacking, but as I said, we don't usually see bad servers back again.  If there was an option, I would have given this a 3 1/2 out of 5.  It's convenient, comfortable, reasonably priced, good basic menu prepared in a good basic way, rarely a wait time, and generally above avg. service.  When we are deciding where to go for dinner, if it's been a bad day or a bad week, this is usually my preference, as it's comfortable, food is good comfort food and it's a quick in and out."}
{"text":"This would be a decent place to go for lunch,  I ordered the cheese steak.  It was alright except for the fact that it wasn't put together with much care, like the cook really didn't care how it looked or if all the meat fell on my lap.  Service was par along with the atmosphere.  The restroom was a little sketchy, but I've seen worse.   The prices seemed a little high for what they were serving ($8.00 for a grilled cheese.)  The hot turkey sandwich is apparently awesome. I read some of the other reviews about cleanliness in the dining room.  It seemed decent.  Not immaculate but not filthy by any means.   My favorite feature is the Italian style decorations offset by a freaking disco ball hanging from the middle of the dining room ceiling.  It makes you want to get down while you enjoy your french fries smothered in gravy.  I gave this place an extra star just for that."}
{"text":"Went for lunch, not a large selection. Got a turkey sandwich, it was a lot of bread and not too much of anything else. Fries were cold. The place was empty, not a good atmosphere."}
{"text":"Stopped in to attend a fantasy football draft in their back conference room. The place is a nice size with a restaurant on one side and a bar on the other side. The waitress I had was very friendly when ordering my food as I got a Bacon cheese burger and fries. To be honest I wasn't expecting much as the reviews and pictures were limited but I was presently surprised especially with the French fries. They tasted very fresh and not like those stale, generic French fries similar restaurants serve. Definitely a good place to grab a quick meal."}
{"text":"always great food tried the hot banana peppers awesome casey and crew will return soon"}
{"text":"I was here Saturday evening 10/4/14.  I orded Delmonico Steak, mushrooms & potato & salad. Ever since, I have been having momentary flashbacks of how great everything was! Huge tender steak done to perfection with large Portobello mushroom pieces & with a bourbon demi-glass I think. More than worth the price with exquisite attention to detail.  Not to mention the service & servers are engaging & bend over backwards to accommodate. Really a diamond in the rough of Monroeville."}
{"text":"Great folks that run this place.  The chicken Romano is awesome.  The homemade Italian dressing is a must try!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch on a Wednesday. We had the restaurant to ourselves, which was fine by us with an active toddler.   I got the steak salad (minus cheese and fries on the side) and thought it was great. The house made balsamic dressing was really good. My husband and SIL shared the 8 layer lasagna and thought it was decent. Not the best but definitely not the worst.   All in all, we had a nice a meal and will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Yelpers, we are everywhere on this one!  I went for lunch.  Mostly professionals, judging from attire.  Not busy, 4-5 tables.    Friend and I each ordered salads.  Mine was a Caesar.  Anchovies?  sure.  Oh wait.  We're out.  So the salad was:  Romaine + cheese.  No Caesar dressing, something clear.  No croutons.  Price?  $10  Friend ordered a salad with salmon added.  Which they forgot.  Then added back on.  Price?  Way more than $10  Time?  1.5 hours. For two salads and two waters.  No.  just no."}
{"text":"The service is top notch and the food is always consistently great. Their reuben is my favorite in Pittsburgh"}
{"text":"Don't know why all the hate for this place. I came here because I got a just pay half deal 15 for 30. I was very very pleased. We ordered chicken parm and fetuccini Alfredo. The chicken parm was perfectly cooked, very tender, and flavorful. The Alfredo was great as well. Perfect balance of sauce and noodles, not drowning. It only could have used a little fresh cracked pepper. The service was great, no complaints there. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I was there last night for the first and last time. As we sat there for 15 minutes waiting for the server to approach the table, I thought that the dining room closely resembled one of those places that Gordon Ramsay comes in to save. How I wish he had.   All the fried items on the sampler platter ($18.95) tasted of fish. The Italian hoagie ($13.45) was served on bread that was hard and stale. The fish sandwich ($13.45) was dry as an old man's bones, as was the bun. We didn't even eat half our food, and no, we didn't ask for boxes.   I did have a chance to visit the restroom after dinner, and as I was washing my hands an employee (don't know if he was from the kitchen or bar) came in, did his business and left without bothering to wash his hands.   The interior of the place has possibilities, with an attractive stone fireplace at one end. Unfortunately, the room has been junked up with unattractive Waffle House-style tables and chairs, two huge muted televisions, and bright, very bright, lighting. I can't comment on the \"lounge,\" since I didn't stop in that part.   I have a hard time believing this place has any relation to What's Cookin' At Casey's, which I used to love to go to when I lived in that area."}
{"text":"Food is ok. Overpriced especially considering you can smell cigarette smoke seeping in from the bar. A little more attention should be taken to the cleanliness of the carpeting in the dining room and the floor in the bathrooms."}
{"text":"Had pizza and was not disappointed . The sauce was sweet and pepperoni was crisp. That's the way I like it. Clean place with quick service . I will be back"}
{"text":"This was by far the worst dining experience I have had in a long time.  They were short staffed and no one came to our table for over 15 minutes.  I had to ask someone to send over our waitress.  When someone came over she got our water and then asked another waitress to take care of us, who sighed heavily and said she had too many tables!!!!  We got our salad, without any bread.  When I again had to ask for bread she brought out 4 rolls that were as hard as a rock! I had to ask.....AGAIN.....for some soft bread.  Wow..... My husband ordered shrimp picatta for $18 and there were only THREE shrimp over heavy mushroom sauce.  No one ever came over to ask how our food was or to refill our water. They had a duo playing and singing in there which was way overkill for the size of the room.  No wonder they offer the Clipper Double Deals.  I guess thats how they get most of their business.  I will never go back again, coupon or not!"}
{"text":"This is the same ownership that used to have that wonderful \"divey\" Rosecliffe across from the old post office in Monroeville.  Why oh why must you give in to the temptation to pasteurize and lose all your charm by moving into a strip mall and becoming just another strip mall joint for the masses?  I miss the character of Rosecliff lounge.  Anyways, I've been here a couple of times and was here today with Ray and Trocon.  This place is run by the Tolerico family who not only owned the restaurant mentioned prior, but what's cookin at caseys and casey's pub.  It's located in a strip mall behind the Monroeville mall.  It's a relatively big restaurant with a main entrance and bar to your right with booth seating and tv's and a dining room to the left.  The dining room is what you'd expect a few booths, plenty of four tops, plain generic decorations and a fake fireplace.  The service has always been good here and the prices are reasonable.  Yesterday I ordered the Roast Beef sandwich with chedder cheese and fried onions.  I substituted vegatables for fries and added a side of haluski.  I was very pleased to see haluski as a special on the menu.  THe haluski itself was kind of meh'.  It was somewhat cold and underseasoned, neverthe less I like egg noodles and cabbage so much that I couldnt' help but finish it.  The veggies were of the same quality you'd buy at Giant Eagle frozen.  The sandwich looked good when it was brought to the table piled high with sliced roast beef on a warm toasted bun.  However, upon further inspection the cheese was like cheese whiz, I mean literally it's the stuff you pump onto your hotdogs at 7-11.  It kind of ruined the sandwich.  I'm not sure if it's always served this way or they just ran out of real cheese.  Trocon and Ray got the fish sandwich.  I sampled the fish it was flavorful and not overcooked.  The serving was large, but not bigger than your head large which you come to expect form a western pa. fish sandwich.  The prices were good.  I think all of the entrees were about $8.  I'll go back again, but I wouldn't make a special trip for this joint."}
{"text":"Tolerico's is a great Italian restaurant.  One can either sit in the casual bar area or their dining room.  A banquet area is also available.   Their dinner menu includes traditional pastas, seafood/chicken entrees, salads, and soups. Their lunch menu has burgers, pizzas, and sandwiches.  Make sure to ask for BOTH menus if you want the best selection. I don't understand why they don't include everything on one menu.  Despite this, just about everything is delicious. My favorites include their pizzas, wedding soup, and pasta with their homemade tomato basil cream sauce.   Entrees come with a side soup or salad and unlimited freshly-baked bread.  Portions are huge, so either go with a large appetite or be prepared to go home with a doggie bag.   Service is friendly, but can be rather slow."}
