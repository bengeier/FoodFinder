{"text":"Definition of a Reservation-an arrangement whereby something, especially a seat or room, is booked or reserved for a particular person or persons
Let' me start off by saying this dinner was a surprise 60th bday with all guests coming from a great distance. 
Restaurant Les Heritiers needs to learn etiquette and apply it like most restaurants, or should I say successful restaurants. We reserved table on October 14 for an 8pm RESERVATION and received a Yelp confirmation, as well as a text confirm and a verbal confirmation from the clueless employee at les Heritiers. Only to be told day of reservation we were moved to 915pm. WTF
If you even think of trying this \"eatery\" why I don't know but when making your reservation ask for a registered letter confirming your table and then quickly cancel."}
{"text":"My wife and I have visited Montreal at least once a year for  over 10 years.  During our most recent visit, we stayed in the Plateau district. We walked around looking for a place that looked good and found Les Heritiers. On a busy night, the staff accommodated us even though we had not made a reservation. 
The food was exceptional. Fresh ingredients, beautifully prepared. Slightly pricey but worth it, especially as you can bring your own wine.
We will definitely come back to this neighborhood find."}
{"text":"I was going to go with just the four stars but I feel that this place is underrated -- probably because it's a little off the beaten path.  Located just west of Sir-Wilfred Laurier in amongst duplex housing, the decor itself is very homey and French.  This is a very French restaurant so it doesn't hurt to know a few phrases.

Their menu is divine.  They have a fixed-price menu ranging from around $20-$50 or so dollars.  You can get a full-on appetizer, soup, little amuse-bouch of sorbet and some sort of alcohol to cleanse your palette before digging into the main course.  On their main course you can find more gamey meats or the traditional meats or vegetarian.  

This is a bring your own wine place so you can get a truly wonderful  French meal -- good portions and very French, I've been to France and their menu is pretty authentic -- for an exceedingly good price.  I can't say enough about their portion to price ratio and truly, truly tasty.

Oh, book a reservation though because this place fills up fast since there is limited seating.  Did I mention this place is French?"}
{"text":"I brought a group of 14 here and we had a great dinner.  We took advantage of the bring your own wine feature by splurging on some great bottles and the food kept up to them.  The service was great, the degustation menu was a great deal and everyone was impressed. It is maybe a bit noisy (but that was mostly our fault... sorry!). The beef rib was amazing, the escargot were great, loved the ceviche scallop... others enjoyed the steak and the fish of the day drew raves.

I will be back!"}
{"text":"J'ai adoré ma visite aux Héritiers. Nous avions réservé pour un groupe de filles, on nous a assis au bar, qui est 'double-sided' alors c'est comme si nous étions a une table, mais surélevée. Malheureusement, on s'est senties un peu dans le chemin tout le long de la soirée. Notre serveur Guillaume a été très professionnel et nous avons apprécié le service. Notez que c'est un apportez-votre-vin et que la SAQ du coin ferme à 19h ! 

Tous les repas viennent avec un potage maison. Pour ma part j'ai pris le menu dégustation (5 services comprenant une entrée au choix, le potage, un trou normand, le repas et le dessert) pour 49$. Ca en valait largement la peine !! L'entrée de tartare de buf était délicieuse, et relevée à souhait. Le potage tomate et poivron était aussi très goûteux et velouté. En repas j'ai pris les pétoncles, elles étaient cuites à la perfection et ça fondait dans la bouche ! En dessert, le nougat glacé avec un coulis de framboise a terminé le repas en beauté.

C'est sur que j'y retourne :)"}
{"text":"Great service!!!
Bring your own bottle
Very reasonably priced for the amazing full of flavor food.
Great first stop on our food trip of Montreal!"}
{"text":"It's always difficult to decide what to eat for dinner when you're in a city that's not your home.  You have favourites and want to stick to them because you only have a few opportunities to eat them.  Once in a blue moon I will try something new.  My sister heard about this place so we threw caution to the wind and went.  New is good.

Les Heritiers is a small and simple restaurant that serves beautiful dishes.  The plates were so colorful and the food was delicious.  We started with a lovely warm goat cheese salad.  It was so good it won over my sister - needless to say, she's not goat cheese's number one fan.  The fish of the day was a melt-in-your-mouth sea bass served on a bed of quinoa.  The bass was pan-seared in a sweet miso-soya glaze.  The rack of lamb was perfectly cooked and served with two slices of scalloped potatoes.  
  
Take someone you love and treat them to some really good food.  In October they moved to a bigger location...does bigger mean better?  I will have to go and see."}
{"text":"My birthday meal. Didn't know what to expect as I had never heard of the restaurant. This place didn't disappoint. Warm goat cheese salad and beef tartar to start. Goat cheese salad was Delicious. Mains were filet mignon with fois gras sauce and braised bison short rib. Both mains were so very good. The filet was so tender and the fois gras sauce was wonderful. Short rib was tender and the sides it came with were just so good. For dessert, creme Brule was very very good. Lemon tarte was also delicious. Best meal of 2014."}
{"text":"Great Food fast service as non French speaking tourists we were treated great ! 

BYOB ..."}
{"text":"Tried out this great resto located in the heart of Le Plateau and really enjoyed it! Not to mention it's a BYOW!  The resto itself is small and has a modern decor....perfect for a first date, romantic dinner, anniversary or night out with friends. The service was warm and friendly. Now for the food...delicious! We decided to go with the table d'hote menu which was worth it!  Started off with delicious soup and then had their scallop dish which was awesome! Beautifully plated dishes and tasted just as good as they looked!  Leave room for dessert which was also heavenly!"}
{"text":"I used to give this place 4 stars but against my best wishes and hopes it now at a 3. The food has been hit or miss lately. But the service is totally messed up. I don't know what's happened but waiting times for something as simple as pulling the cork from my bottle to help buy time is poor. If you're going to take 20 minutes before giving me a menu, at least open my bottle. 

I have 3 other friends who feel the same way. I hope they clear this up soon."}
{"text":"This place was perfect.Went in a group of 36 each meal was spot on.Only thing was for the desserts were not as good.My kids asked if they could go there again.And we will."}
{"text":"I've heard about les heritiers before but it was my first time trying it and it was pleasing.

It was on a wednesday lunch and it was quite calm. Only us and another table, no crowd and no noise. Very pleasant to discuss.

The meal started with a beet soup. Nothing special but can a beet soup be special? The entree was tempura shrimps which were crispy, well cooked with a very flavorsome sauce.

I chose the pintade as main course. It was very copious. It was supposed to come with a coffee sauce but it didn't taste lile coffee at all. Still tasty of course, it wasn t really a problem.

The banana ice cream was served with a pistachio crumble  my favorite nut .

Just a lovely BYOB"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Poor execution, most of the plate were not good, and it was very expensive (115$ for two). 

We were a group of 12 and none of us will ever go back. We shared our dissatisfaction with the waiter regarding some of the most horrible plates (foie gras taste like a cheap 2$ pâté, Ceviche taste like the sea, escargots deep fried, taste like old fryer oil) and they could not care less, it remained on the bill and they did not offer us anything ; not even a free coffee! The staff had an attitude from our arrival, we witness them being that way with most of the customers in the place! Not a lot of people look satisfied! Don't waist your money or time, go else were!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service!  We knew the chef on duty that night and he prepared a special dish for us, plus let us sample many dishes on menu.   Full resto with great ambience."}
{"text":"J'y suis aller pour notre dîner de fin d'année avec mes collègues

Un superbe restaurant avec un ambiance très décontracté. La cuisine était excellente ! Les choix était intéressant également et les cuissons étaient parfaites. 

C'est un ''apporté votre vin'' alors un point de plus ici !

Un peu cher par contre pour un midi, mais la qualité était au rendez-vous !"}
{"text":"Restaurant français préféré à Mtl.  Apportez votre vin.  Cuisine excellente.  Et un trou normand inclus dans la table d'hôte (avec de la vodka par contre).

Très bon rapport qualité prix.

J'ai essayé de réserver une table la dernière fois mais c'était complet samedi soir.  Je n'ai toujours pas essayé depuis qu'ils ont déménagé sur l'avenue Mont-Royal."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing! I had the 5  course special which included a carrot soup then I had shrimp tempura which was amazing! Then we were given a delicious palate cleanser; grapefruit sorbet with a hint if vodka. My main dish was a duck risotto; the duck cooked 2 ways. Duck confit and crispy duck skin. YUM!!! For dessert I had the chocolate brownie with caramel sauce and a scoop of vanilla ice cream and then finished off with a cappuccino."}
