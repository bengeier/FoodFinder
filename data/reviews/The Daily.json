{"text":"We were meeting family from out of town with a party of 9.I phoned the day before and was assured they would hold a table. I phoned again an hour before to confirm and was told they wouldn't hold a table. We would have to come and put our name on the list but it wouldn't be too long. We arrived and were told the 2 big tables had been booked. 3 people at one, rest of the party didn't arrive for 20 minutes. Other table had 4 people. They ate. 35 minutes later their friends arrived. Meanwhile we were told not to block their passage so we were standing in the doorway. All 9 of us. After 35 minutes a waitress said it might be soon. Then she said maybe not. No offers of coffee. No attempt to combine smaller tables. If you don't take reservations, just say so. 45 minutes of waiting and we finally left. Certainly will not be back."}
{"text":"I brought my wife here for breakfast because I wanted to try out this new breakfast place. The decor was nice when we walked in. The place was mostly empty which I thought was kind of strange for a Sunday brunch time. I soon found out why. The food we ordered took over and hour and wasn't hot when it arrived. It tasted kind of off. When I told the waitress she seemed annoyed with me and passed it off as \"Some people are not use to fresh food\" but I'm sorry it tasted weird. We ended up leaving half way through our meal.....we also never got our coffee after over an hour. We definitely wont be back"}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast on a Sunday morning. It was almost empty inside which means A) it's new and people dont know about it yet or B) the food sucks. 

The ambiance and decor are excellent as was the service. No complaints there.

We ordered the Veggie Fritatta and Bangover Burger. Both were unacceptably poor quality.

The Bangover burger patty had so much cartilage and gristle in it that I had to pick it out with my fingers from my mouth. It was the poorest quality of ground beef I have ever had in my life and should never be served in a restaurant. The burger meat was akin to chewing on a rubber band. Additionally, it was burned on the edges. I lost my appetite after a few bites of greasy bland gristle burger.

The Veggie Fritatta looked good but the goat cheese was lumped to one side of the round Fritatta instead of dispersed throughout.  I kept tasting a burned taste the whole time and couldn't understand why until I flipped it over and the whole underside was burned to hell .... totally inedible at this point. We didnt even complain at this point because it would be useless to say \"your food quality sucks\" and expect anything to be different so we paid and left as fast as we could.

On the other hand, the coffee was decent..."}
{"text":"Discovered this place recently - food can be a hit or a miss. While the pain perdu is fabulous and the bacons crisp to perfection, I've had better breakfast poutine elsewhere. However, overall great place - would definitely revisit."}
{"text":"A nice bright space and lack of line-up on weekend mornings are two big positive for a breakfast place is Calgary. The service was fine, but the food was more of a mixed bag. I ordered the banana/PB/Nutella crepe, and it was good: sizeable portion, homemade peanut butter, tasty batter. My wife had a hash, to which we added hollandaise sauce, because everything's better with hollandaise ...amirite? The hollandaise sauce was barely room temperature and tasted more like a whipped mayo than anything else. The poached eggs on the hash had completely solid yolks. We pointed out these shortcomings and they brought a new dish out, with better yolks but the difference in the hollandaise was imperceptible. The meat in the hash was good, but the potatoes quite humdrum despite being described as smash browns (which Holy Grill has nailed down).

Not a place we'll rush back too, but if we go again we'll probably stick with crepes and harder to mess up items like a burger."}
{"text":"The place looks great but the service is awful and the food is nothing to get excited about. Coffee is great though"}
{"text":"One day my daughter and I were doing a Kensington walkabout, when we happened upon this cute little breakfast/lunch spot called 'The Daily' hidden below Higher Ground. Despite being underground the space is bright and cheery. It's the perfect place to have the first meal of your day in. In fact, I wish that I lived nearby so I could do that more often. 
We really weren't planning on staying, but one look at the menu lured us to a comfy spot in the back room...which seemed vaguely familiar to me. Ah yes, this place used to be a lingerie store called the Cat's Pygamas! 
In my excitement, I had forgotten that I had walked in with a coffee from Vintage Coffee Company and offered to get rid of it when the server came by. She was really nice and poured it into a coffee mug, then binned the take out coffee cup. Really, it's not something I do EVER but I appreciate that she allowed me to keep the coffee.
My daughter was very happy with her vegan pancakes (the huge reason we were lured in by the menu) and I was extremely happy with my Last Best Burger. The beer sauteed mushrooms and beer infused mustard captured enough beer flavour to make this one amazing burger. Fresh tomato and grilled pepper soup was made just that morning and I was impressed with the flavours, though I did add a bit of salt as it was under seasoned. I would much rather add my own salt, then have a dish be inedible because it's too salty.
I love this place. Really love it. I hope people discover this little breakfast/lunch gem in Kensington and keep it around for a long time!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed as one day I went in to check it out.  I was told to \"sit anywhere\" and sat for several minutes and no one ever came to serve me.  So...I left and won't be back.  It wasn't full and there were several staff standing around.  Lousy service for sure."}
{"text":"It has such bad food that it makes me angry. How can a breakfast place have bad hash browns? That's a main item. I work in Kensington so have given it 3 tries in the hopes that it was just an off day, or I ordered the wrong thing. Everything is just horrible though. Way too expensive. 

Also once I went in at 5:30 (they say they close at 6) and the waitress said the kitchen was closed... which I am happy about now because than I couldn't order shitty expensive food. All of my friends who I ate with also left unsatisfied. There is so much potential and believe me, I want a breakfast place in Kensington, but it's awful. If they don't get better food they will go under."}
{"text":"Was super excited to try the daily as we are always looking for new places to try. Went on the Monday of August long weekend and we were sadly disappointed. We arrived and ordered our food by about 1130 and didn't receive our food until well after 1230 and we weren't the only ones, overhearing more than one other table complain. I don't mind normally mind waiting, but when it isn't busy it's pretty inexcusable.  They also seemed extremely unorganized and it was painful watching the servers sort out where to place people. Only upside to our experience was a friendly and apologetic server, and  the freshly squeezed orange juice was pretty delicious."}
{"text":"Came to the Daily for brunch...on a weekday! It's tough to find a non-glorified-fast-food all-day breakfast spot. 

I went for the Headliner breakfast and it didn't disappoint. Thick-cut bacon, maple pork sausage, smashed hash browns - all good. Pancakes were just the right size for a complete breakfast. My eggs were basted a little too hard for my liking, but still so tasty. 

My companion had the braised beef Bennies. Can I just say OMG...beef was tender and so delicious. The hollandaise was so amazing that I think next time, I will order a side of it for my potatoes! I so want to try their Pancrepe with duck confit and whipped goat cheese (food of my dreams...pancake/crêpe with duck...mmmmmmmm)

I'd loooooooove to see real maple syrup added to the menu, although the stuff they serve is definitely a good alternative - it's not that super-sickly-sweet thick stuff they serve at other places. 

The decor is bright, cozy and welcoming. This is a hidden gem that is downstairs from Higher Grounds. (They get their teas and coffee from there, and they're excellent). 

Don't walk on by - stop in and enjoy the great food!"}
{"text":"Cute, cool and trendy place for a meal but other then that there isn't much appeal. For a restaurant i am not sure if thats good enough, the food is good but not great and I found the selection to be a little bit strange and limiting not sure maybe the food just wasn't for me. The crepes however are to die for and would recommend that if you get caught in a pickle not knowing what to order :) Kensington is such a cool part of Calgary that is worth checking out and this maybe a good stop in for a breakfast lover. (just check the menu first to make sure its to your liking)"}
{"text":"How can a place that's underground be so bright and cheerful? You'd think it's impossible, but somehow The Daily does it! At least, I think they do... Maybe it was all an optical illusion?

Located beneath Higher Ground (https://www.yelp.ca/biz/higher-ground-calgary), The Daily is a happy little breakfast and lunch nook that focuses comforting and fresh food sourced from local farms. Breakfast or lunch, it's up to you - they do both of them all day. It's nice to know you can get a fresh burger and a beer while your hungover friend can get a pork loin, poached eggs breakfast poutine. Woh... You know what? I think your hungover friend is onto something here!

I wasn't feeling a heavy lunch, but I was completely suckered in by the BBBLT sandwich. Bacon steak (yes, you read that correctly), smoked bacon, arugula, fried tomato, herb mayo and bacon jam (yes, also correct) on a brioche. Hot damn is this thing every satisfying! Check out photos for the full effect. I don't think any explanation is going to do 'bacon steak' justice. I regret nothing!"}
{"text":"Stumbled into The Daily looking for breakfast early on a Saturday morning, what a great space.  We were able to be seated right away and were very impressed with the cute & quirky decor.  Coffee, orange juice and water were acquired promptly and we were very impressed by the selection on the menu.  The portions were huge and the food was delicious.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good but I have to say... A little shocked by the way my friend was treated. We were a group of eight. The server got all of our orders correct except for one. So he ended up sitting there lonely without food for another 10 minutes before she brought in yet another wrong order. He finally got the right plate about 25 minutes later than everyone else (a salad no less). Ok these things happen but any server with common sense would've either taken the price off or offered a at least a discount for him, seeing she made a mistake not once but twice. Nope. When the bill came he was charged the full amount."}
{"text":"Went here on the weekend for the first time and I have to say we were super impressed. They did a great job with the place and the staff was excellent.  They serve higher ground coffee as their drip coffee , so that's just a plus to begin with.  I had the full order pancake and it was an insane amount of delicious pancakes served with a great selection of fruit.  My husband has the regular breakfast and the  potatoes were some of the best I've had at a breakfast joint. Highly recommend this place, hopefully the quality keeps up."}
{"text":"We had high hopes for this place. The neighborhood could really use a straightforward breakfast restaurant. After dining here 3 times, I can say confidently DON'T waste your money!

After dining here in the first week and receiving cold food, poorly timed table service and many unavailable items on the menu, I chalked it up to opening jitters.

The next time I returned with two guests with celiac disease. They were excited to see several gluten-free options on the menu. After querying the very competent waitress (the best part of this awful experience), it turned out that only three items are gluten free: eggs, fruit and yogurt. 

We gave it a few more months and the place still hasn't improved. The owner is not receptive to feedback and clearly does't have an experienced chef in the kitchen. I predict this place will go under by next year, and probably pull it's sister venue, Higher Ground, down with it."}
{"text":"simply Fantastic! How is this place not way busier?? Granted, we went for a leisurely brunch on a friday morning but it is a long weekend and I would expect more people snuck an extra day off work :) It is a bit tucked away underneath Higher Ground in Kensington, but the space is super cute, bright and welcoming. We had great service, my coffee cup never went empty (a huge pet peeve at breakfast spots is when the coffee runs out) and we were not rushed to turn over the table.

The pain perdu is the most amazing french toast you will ever have! It has a brulee crunchy topping, and perfect fruit compote. A sweet breakfast, but not too sweet, not overdone, just right, and for like $9 you get two huge slices of toast AND bacon! 

The fritatta looked great with wonderful \"smashed\" baby potatoes. Also tried the breakfast tempura which was great, but you def want to share this- a huge pile of tempura bacon, and what looked like two whole avocados sliced up. tasty, but a lot for one, perfect to share though!

Elote- just like south american street corn on the cob, with spices and that great cheese they have down there. Only suggestion on this one is that I wish they cut it into smaller cob-ettes so it can be shared.

Great value from what I saw, it's rare to find a breakfast of this quality in calgary at this price!  Definitely check them out!"}
{"text":"Bad service, unfriendly and they don't seem to enjoy working there. Food is poor quality, we wouldn't go again. We tried it twice and shouldn't have even given it a second chance"}
{"text":"This little gem has been kicking around since Spring 2016, and is located right underneath Higher Ground Coffee. I had no idea it existed and was excited to join a friend for a coffee or in her case lunch when she suggested it one day.

It's bright and it's a cool set up, keeping the rooms sectioned off as they were with the previous retail business. The owners of Higher Ground also own The Daily but there is no food coming from upstairs. It's all cooked in the The Daily's in house kitchen.

They have pizza, burgers, amazing huge crepes and other breakfast items. While I didn't have any food this time, I stole pieces of my lunch dates crepe and it was fabulous.

I wish they would have an espresso maker, but that is the only con to our visit here. Great service, friendly waitress. All the makings of a fabulous restaurant.

Looking forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I stopped in for lunch on Monday and were seated right away. The space is bright and comfortable. The menu looked delicious and hubby had a traditional breakfast with 2 eggs, fruit, toast, sausage and bacon. These are no regular breakfast sausages either, must try!!! I'm not a fan of finger sized pork breakfast sausages and these had a totally different flavour profile. 

I had a breakfast burger. 6oz wagyu beef patty well seasoned with visible red pepper flakes and garlic salt according to my tastebuds!  It was topped with tomato, pickle, onions and lettuce and a spicy aioli.  The rosemary roasted potatoes are a great addition with flaked salt- perfectly tender!!! I was really impressed with the quality of the food and our server was friendly without being over the top or absent. We will definitely be back as I've given up on so many breakfast places. Make the trip to Kensington folks!!!"}
{"text":"I love this space, throwback items as decor, a newsie vibe, and a great airy open space ! They try to source as much local food as they can which I'm always a fan of and the menu is fresh and exciting .. The only problem was that the food was pretty average. Our eggs Benny was lukewarm and we each had one done soft poached but the other one was hard .. Not sure how that happened . Service was awesome and because of all the great things besides the average meal that day I absolutely have to go back in hopes they nail it next time !!"}
{"text":"I left The Daily dissapointed. Being a national holiday, a friend and I were anticipating to wait for a table, only to find the restaurant half empty. We were given a table right away. The decor was lovely and menus were already on the table so we got directly to deciding what we wanted. I had settled on the breakfast poutine, and my friends on the eggs Benedict. When the waitress came by, we were informed that they had no porkloin so they were unable to make either dish. I then ordered the club sandwich, my friend ordered the breakfast tempura and we both got some fresh squeezed orange juice. We should have known when the table beside us got up and left without their food we were in for a long wait. We got our food about an hour and twenty minutes after ordering. When we asked the waitress she just said the kitchen was \"busy\" which didn't make much sense since the restaurant wasn't full. The food was good, however they should stop passing off their \"healthy ketchup\" as anything eatable and just give people the Heinz they end up asking for. Despite the decent food, I am going to wait and see if they can last a few months before returning and hopefully they get it together."}
{"text":"Count me in when you say a new a brunch place opens up. The Daily has a such a great vibe and design that it just spells awesomeness. The simple touches in decorations and atmosphere make the restaurant so welcoming and fun.

Great decor however does not make up for mediocre food. I have been there twice already with separate group of friends and on both occasions left feeling \"meh\". Maybe The Daily is shaking off the \"morning jitters\" and needs to get into the groove of things but so far the food was just alright.

I have tried the breakfast poutine, pain perdu, eggs benedict, pancake tower, breakfast tempura. The best thing out of the things we've ordered was definitely the pain perdu. The pancake tower was the biggest disappointment, the pancakes were thin and and when you are paying that price it becomes hard to justify.

The Daily is a great addition to the neighborhood but hoping it shakes off the kinks."}
{"text":"Went for a late lunch today with the wifey. This place is pretty new and the reviews seemed pretty good so we decided to check it out. We were greeted by a very friendly server and sat promptly.

For whatever reason it's become a routine for us to want our eggs late in the afternoon typically on Sundays but I was also fighting a mean craving for a sandwich. At last I ordered the Kingpin Sandwich. The description of it had everything; eggs, French toasted bread (which I assume was some sort of attempt at brioche? The menu doesn't say what kind of bread it comes with), scallions, spicy aoili, a pork patty and aged cheddar. 

Regrettably @TheDailyYYC, it was not good. I understand that aged white cheddar can be quite strong and an acquired taste, that of bleu cheese or say a strong Swiss. In this instance I'm going to say it is not a compliment to the rest of the dish. Again, maybe it was just my own personal taste or my taste buds not really liking it but I just felt like I was eating something that had already spoiled in each bite. The \"French toast\" was soggy and greasy. The fat that it was glistening in didn't taste like butter but instead leftover fat from a flat top grill. Bacon fat...??? Not too sure what it was cooked in but it made the sandwich have this strong greasy odour about it. Eggs, same idea. Tasted like it was thrown on the flat top with the rest of the ingredients and then plopped onto the sandwich. It was also lacking any trace of scallions. Chipotle aoili was unnoticeable, no heat, no flavor. And the pork patty was a little bland as well. 

Thankfully the dish also had a hearty helping of The Daily's \"Smashed Potatoes\". Think cooked baby potatoes, smashed with a flat object, fried, tossed with some rosemary, sea salt and served right on the plate whole. Simple and delicious. My only gripe about them is that I feel that were a little out of place with the Breakfast food. Something that would be a definitely welcome companion to a nice steak or other such grilled meat. I have a whole other review for my parter in gluttony's dish which was the corned beef sandwich with garlic fries. But I'm sure I've bored you all already with my current one. Long n short of it; it would be nice to have some kind of mayo on it or maybe make it with a coleslaw but again, personal preference. The sandwich otherwise was good. Chewy meat! Garlic fries, meh. Garlic was bunched at the bottom of the bowl and didn't coat the fries well enough. Just tasted like regular fries. Recommend rosemary fries if they're seasoned anything like the smashed potatoes. Regrettably we didn't get to try their soup of the day as they had no soup. Our server was good, attentive and friendly. I don't think she was able to pick up on any cues when I didn't enjoy my food or when we wanted the bill though. 

I will likely give this place another shot in the future to try something else on the menu. For now, I'll leave this review and move on to the next. I also want to apologize for not bringing my experience with the Kingpin sandwich to anyone's attention. 

Thanks for reading!"}
{"text":"I love the location of this place, great atmosphere and really cute inside... but I was not blown away or impressed by the food. I am always on a quest for a great eggs benny so of course had to try it here on my first visit. This place isnt bad by any means, but menu selection wasnt huge or special by any means. I just have plenty of other places that I would choose first over here."}
{"text":"Got to finally try out The Daily in Kensington.  The restaurant is located right below Higher Ground Coffee Shop.  Nicely decorated.  See my photos for \"When Pigs Fly\".  The restaurant was not very busy at 8 a.m. on Sunday.  We were asked to pick a table so we picked a table by the Flying Pigs!

We had their coffee (which is coffee from Higher Ground) which was really good!  

We ordered their breakfast dishes:
- PAIN PERDU Thick slices of brioche, french-toasted and bruléed, fruit compote, fresh fruit, whipped cream, thick cut smoked bacon - really fresh French toast with blackberry compote and blackberries.  I had a piece of the French toast and the crispy bacon.  Tasty.
- SAVOURY PANCREPE  Scallion pancake, duck confit, whipped goat cheese, greens, soft poached egg -  My sister ordered and split half of her crepe with me.  I would eat this again!!  Most delicious!  Just wished there were 2 poached eggs instead of just one egg!  Anything with goat cheese is so good.
- EGGS BENEDICT  2 poached eggs, hollandaise with Albertan style beer-braised beef - I split this dish with my sister.  The eggs and hollandaise was pretty good.  The beef is ok.  I would think the braised beef would be a little softer.  Instead, it was pulled beef in stiff strips.  
- CORNED BEEF HASH  House-corned beef brisket, smash fried baby potatoes, roasted tomato, grilled red onion, 2 soft basted eggs, smoked cauliflower - Had a taste of the corned beef and it was quite tasty.  

The 3 savoury dishes all came with smash-fried potatoes, delicately seasoned and taste really good with their home-made ketchup.  Yummers!

We'd all come back again!  Wait staff was attentive and food was delivered quickly to the table.  There are 2 washrooms for male and female on the lower level.  A little tight in the washroom space but well thought-out in making efficient use of space.  There is a bigger washroom on the main level for handicap use.  See my 5 photos for more info."}
