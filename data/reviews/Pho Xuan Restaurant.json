Welcome."}
{"text":"I've been here countless times with my girlfriend. Pho Xuan is my official go to for pho in Calgary, there's absolutely no flaws about this restaurant so I really don't understand why other Yelpers are not providing full stars. Yes Pho Xuan is a family Vietnamese restaurant, but isn't most Vietnamese restaurant family owned?

Why should you go to Pho Xuan? Their services is fast, prices are fair, you get your monies worth, the size of the plate speaks for itself, and I can go on. 

Where are they located? Pho Xuan is located in the heart of the strip mall across from T&T Supermarket and Pacific Place Mall with a first come first serve base parking lot.

I'm pretty basic when it comes to Vietnamese restaurants because I typically order the same dish; an order of goi cuon (salad roll), the largest size of  pho dac biet, and tea. I've been to countless places but I really love the way Pho Xuan makes these dishes. There's something about them that always make me come back every so often.

Pho Xuan is an automatic +1 in my books and I would strongly recommend to any if not everyone!"}
{"text":"Sometimes nothing hits like a giant bowl of soup, and Vietnamese pho usually takes the cake in terms of portion size and taste.

This place is near where I live and is one of my first choices when a pho craving hits.  The prices are reasonable, especially considering the portion sizes you get.

It's cash-only here though, and they don't seem to have a chicken pho option (or I just haven't found it yet), but the service and food is very quick.  Definitely hits the spot."}
{"text":"The quality of the Pho and Salad Rolls has definitely improved. Consumed the beef flank Pho and 3 salads rolls. The vegetables to put in the Pho were cleaner this time. The place was overall cleaner this time. Servers were polite and fast. Price was always right here! Yay Xuan, you make me want to come back.

{"text":"Really and truly - the best pho in town. I live in the deep NW near Airdrie and don't think twice about making a trip to the NE just for their pho. My go to is the special pho with an avocado shake. Sometimes I shake it up with a 3 layer red bean drink. The place is no frills, but you don't come here if you want to be fancy - you come here for the food. Their service used to be awful, but they've since improved a ton and now take plastic instead of cash only! Love love love this place."}
{"text":"Favorite pho restaurant for my family. They have the kids utensils ready and nice booth spaces the kids enjoy. Our favorite for pho, vermicelli, and rice dishes. Best for quality and quantity"}
{"text":"This is one of the better place for Pho.  Being the NE, there are many different Pho restaurants in the area.  However, many of the nearby restaurants are likely more expensive  (overpriced) and catered more to the non-Asian lunch crowd... which means you pay more for the same (or worse) quality food.  I like the Pho, but I am personally in love with the rice with the grilled pork and/or chicken.  Pho Xuan is my first choice for Vietnamese food in the area.  Looking at the crowd at the restaurant on most days, this is the first choice for many others as well."}
{"text":"Good food, good prices. Service was good and fast."}
{"text":"this is where I go when my craving for Pho  suddenly hits. this place is located right across the street of T&T supermarket in marborough area. 
among a lot of Pho in that area, this is one if the better ones. it's get really busy everyday at lunch time, but tables turn over fast.

Pho is easy and fast. The soup base is great. Along with the pepper, hot sauce, fish sauce and lime. it becomes a flavorful bowl. XL portion is huge and it usually satisfies my hungry stomach. Durian milkshake is good too.  
I haven't tried many things other than the old simple bowl of Pho. if you have tried other things, let me know how they are!"}
{"text":"The grilled pork chop and 2 fried eggs 
A ate here just recently. My first dish was the 2 fried egg and pork chop. The pork chop is soo good. But the egg needed some more cooking I didn't know that it would be sunny side up and also the dish had tomatoes I hated tomatoes. Since it was my first time I had no idea. The cucumbers where dry and tasted like they where siting out for a day. The rice tasted like normal rice, it was fine. But the star of the dish was the grilled pork chop I could eat it all day. So I recommend just getting pork chop for 2.50 and some rice. 

The special pho
I came to order the special pho a couple days later thinking it could be better, I ordered take away. When I took the vermicelli out of the box it was like a rock it was really hard and nasty, it clumped up. Over all the soup was very good I would recommend it, but maybe it could have been better if I just ate there"}
{"text":"Always enjoy eating here, they serve a great pho tai, it's always pleasing, and very tasty. The service is always good, food is good, always busy. This is among one of the best Vietnamese restaurants in town in my opinion."}
{"text":"We go to Pho Xuan at least once a week and each time, I leave very full and satisfied. The sizes are very big and they're generous with the noodles. I know some fast food places that aren't as fast as Pho Xuan. Only awkward thing is when they don't turn on the background music and all you hear is slurping."}
{"text":"We brought our foodie luck club to yet another Asian restaurant last night and because the place closes at nine, we rushed to the restaurant and unfortunately I was quite late.

Everyone ordered Pho and I ordered the vermicelli noodles and spring rolls with chicken. Everyone was really enjoying their huge bowls of Pho and the steam and fresh basil and lemon I could smell wafting in the air.  

My noodles were completely another story however, I think the staff was anxious to leave so my noodles were especially dry and I basically ate just the spring rolls and chicken.  My Vietnamese coffee was not prepared with the coffee attachment that slowly seeps coffee into the milk, instead it came mixed already in a very small cup. 

My foodie accomplices left quite happy but for me personally I have had better.  I should have had the Pho!"}
{"text":"By far my favourite pho restaurant! Really cheap and fast service. I love there pho sate"}
{"text":"The location isn't the greatest and it may be hard to find but since I have discovered this place I will never go to another pho place ever again. This is the most authentic Vietnamese joint I have tried in Calgary so far and I am picky with my pho. The thing that gets me is they are not cheap with their meat - my favourite is tendon and they don't cheap out at all, I find my bowl has big chunks of it. The broth is delicious and the food comes out within 5 minutes. The price is very reasonable, you can order from a small to a large size and spend under $10. The service is good, you get what you came for at an efficient manner. I highly recommend this Vietnamese joint strictly just for the food."}
{"text":"This place for pho gets a 5 star from me because even their small pho has so much noodles and generous amounts of meat and I love their sate here (not the coconut cream satay). However I think they should spend some time renovating the place because their walls are ripped and some chairs have rips in their seats."}
{"text":"On Dec 7,2016 I order XL Pho Tai; when I went to pick it up got home they give me a SMALL size portion. When I call back, the lady answer the call and listen to the complaint she said that I ordered a large size and I said no I ask for XL but the portion is small then she ask if I would like to exchange it but when I ask her to hold on a minute she didn't listen and she hung up on me which is very poor customer service.  If you ask me do I recommend ppl to go there to order take out I will say NO."}
{"text":"Best pho I've ever had in my entire life. The broth isn't watery, they give plenty of sprouts and mint, and they have great prices. Usually is packed during lunch on Saturdays and Sunday's, so come early. The service is quick and sweet. It's not the prettiest place, but the food makes up for it. You won't be disappointed, would recommend for everyone to try it out"}
