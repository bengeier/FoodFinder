{"text":"Awesome place! I come here all the time for lunch. Staff is friendly, lots of food/topping options, and it's affordable! Definitely recommend trying this place."}
{"text":"Very good, high quality homemade food. The falafels are the best and they hand make them fresh to order."}
{"text":"very good neighborhood spot making delicious Shawarma.  Went to pick up dinner... no beef left, had the Chciken plate... really juicy and well seasoned.  appears to be more of a lunch spot given how most salads were sold down and only one shawarma was left.  really good stuff, will visit again... also love that it's a local and indie owned place"}
{"text":"Our Go to place on the days we don't wanna cook. Authentic Lebanese food and the portions are so generous , that it is literally 2 meals for me. The owners are so polite and lovely. You will get your money's worth. We recommend the mixed plate :)"}
{"text":"I love shawarma and this place ... it hits the spot.  The food is really fresh and despite being a \"fast food\" it is not greasy and they use quality products.  The staff is really nice and the prices are spot on.  I really hope this place sticks around, it's a welcome addition to the neighbourhood.  Try it!"}
{"text":"This place is excellent! The place is bright and clean and is owned by a Palestinian family from Jerusalem. The food is really fresh and full of flavour. Portions are huge and the selection of salads is excellent. I have been here many times and tried most of the items. I hope this place sticks around as it fill the Shawarma void in East Danforth."}
{"text":"This is one of the best shawarma I've had in Toronto! The food is fresh and full of taste. Very generous portions and great salads and rice!  The sandwiches are always so delicious. The staff is very friendly. Excellent quantity and quality for your money. Highly recommend it, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Can't ask for much more with this gem.  - modern and clean - amazing prices - friendly staff - great food  - huge portions - extra sauces lol  I had a chicken schwarma plate, and it's 3 hours later and I'm still full. Might need a nap actually.  Well done."}
{"text":"I have lived across the street from this place for 2+ years and never stopped in, so I decided to change that today. Two words of advice if you plan on trying Almanqal: come hungry.  THE GOOD: - Almanqal combines the speed of fast food with fresh ingredients and a clean interior. Let's be real - most shawarma joints in Toronto have that dirty, grimy, \"you-may-or-may-not-get-food-poisoning-here\" vibe. Not this place - I was pleasantly surprised with how fresh and delicious the ingredients were, as well as how bright and open the space was.  - On top of fresh ingredients, the portions are absolutely massive. I got a chicken shawarma plate: chicken, rice, 2 yummy salads, hummus and tahini sauce. My styrofoam container was absolutely packed. I have a huge appetite and I still struggled to finish this thing (~$9 with tax) - it could have EASILY been two meals. Easily. In typical fatty fashion, however, I challenged myself to finish it all in one go (and subsequently passed out on my couch for 2 hours).  THE BAD: - The chicken was the tiniest bit dry - that would be my only critique regarding the food.  - Do take note that unlike a lot of other shawarma places in the city, Almanqal is not open late - they close at 10pm on weekdays, 11pm on Saturday and do not open on Sundays. Looks like this won't be my new late night munchies spot.   All in all, I'm super happy to have discovered this gem across the street, and I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Finally!  A shawarma place in tha hood!  I love, love, love this place.  The owners are friendly.  All of the cooking equipment is brand new and clean.  More importantly, the food is fantastic, authentic and the helpings are enormous and inexpensive.  What more could you ask for?  NOOOOOOOOOOO!  This place is CLOSED damn it.  WHYYYYYYYYY?"}
{"text":"this is my husband and i go to stop for a shawarma plate. the portions are huge and the price is right. very tasty, and very freindly staff"}
{"text":"Great food and nice owner. Fresh, tasty with big portions. I often order the chicken shawarma plate."}
{"text":"Had to knock one star off, the beef was pretty dry, that being said I would definitely come back but just get the chicken instead of mixed plate.   Everything else is fresh and delicious. Worth a visit for sure. Parking can be hard to find."}
{"text":"Overall I have mixed feelings for this joint. I ordered the lunch special, 2 shawarma plates for $13.99. Our plates were filled yes, big portions. The rice with beans was quite good with their two salads and meat. The gripe I have with this place is when my plate was made, the server didn't add sliced onions, pickled turnips until I asked him to. He replied by saying \"it doesn't come with the meal, but I'll put it for you this time.\" First time I've heard of a shawarma place not including these toppings on their plates. Not good customer etiquette by any means, you guys can do better.  In any rate Almanqal still doesn't beat Ruby's Mediterranian Cuisine at the Eglinton Square mall. If you want 'heavenly shawarma' head on there instead!"}
{"text":"Update:  This restaurant is closed.  :(  After hearing about this place from a few people I decided to try it over the holidays.  Probably the timing wasn't the best for having a regular service experience.  Even so, everything that's been said by others is right on the mark.  I'm not usually someone who cares much for rice, but the rice included with the meal was very flavourful and delicious.  The chicken, as others have mentioned was a bit on the side of dry, but still very good.  Huge portions and everything done well.  Very nice staff and a clean environment.  Excellent value."}
{"text":"Always tasty, generous portions and friendly service. Every neighbourhood needs it's own great shawarma and this place definitely fits the bill."}
{"text":"Great food! The staff is amazing! Too bad they do not deliver otherwise I would have it more often. The parking around there sucks and usually taken up by the Pizza Pizza delivery guys who save spots for each other..."}
{"text":"When I get shawarma I get it \"naked.\" No bread. I love that the portion is big and it tastes amazing. Best I've tried so far!  I need to edit this review to say I wish I could say and remember the name to tell people about it other than the intersection.   Also, they should just add Shawarma Salad to their menu because it really would add an option for the paleo and dieting crowd. Especially with all of those businesses around that need some lunch!  Still going with 5 stars because the food keeps getting better!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars if only Yelp would allow that but I will give them a half of star for the tremendous value. The portions are huge and the price tag is low. If you're hungry and want something to fill you up quick and cheap then this will do.  The chicken is slightly on the dry side but  very flavourful. Veggies are all fresh and nicely dressed. The potatoes are....well.. potatoes? They taste they way they should taste.  Visit if you're hungry and on a budget."}
{"text":"Great value, delicious flavours.  Classic enough that you are comforted by familiar flavours but different with a unique twist.  This is my favourite new takeout place for those nights when I don't want to cook.  Welcome addition to the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"My wife and I really enjoy this local restaurant. Recently we bought a house in the area, and being busy with the move and with life, and wanting a quick healthy meal from time to time, this is the place to go. They always have fresh vegetables on hand (olives, pickles, pickled beets, lettuce etc) along with garlic spread and some other awesome sauces. They make the falafel fresh!! They are a great local, and quick Sharma place. The price is just right too! They are busy, and getting busier. A place you must visit. I give it 4 stars only because they could improve slightly on the decor. Having said that, this place does fit into the category of fast food. Hope this review was helpful :)"}
{"text":"Everything was delicious!  Chicken shawarma, hummus, rice with lentils, potatoes, falafel, coleslaw, and tabbouleh.  Portions are generous, service was efficient and friendly.  The selection was good as well. Out of 4 or 5 shawarma places I've been to in the area, this one is definitely the best!  I can't wait to go back!  They also have whole, half and quarter chickens."}
