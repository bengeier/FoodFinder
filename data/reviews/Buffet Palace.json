{"text":"Decent Indian AYCE at a good price, convenient location, good patio during the summer

$10.99 for lunch; $14.99 for dinner -you can't go wrong here. They have the standards: butter chicken, tandoori chicken, goat curry, biryani chicken, veggie samosas, basmati rice. Quite a few vegetarian dishes. The naan is delivered fresh to your table, but we order it extra crispy otherwise it is quite bread-y. They have a salad section, but I never partake as I want to leave room for the hot food. They have a wide selection of strange desserts.

Ambiance is lacking and a little dark, but we like the patio during the summer.

I don't think it's the best Indian food, but it is still decent. And it's in my neighbourhood, which is a bonus."}
{"text":"Nice decor inside. Food was excellent, with lots of selections. My favourite was palak paneer and butter chicken.
The server was very attentive. She got me warm basket of naan fresh out of oven. She filled my glass frequently.

Overall very good value!"}
{"text":"Although, the food and selection are not bad, i am questioning the cleanliness of this restaurant. Was at Joe's Indisn Buffet last Tuesday and everything was fine until I saw part of a steel wool (the one you use for scrubbing) on their rice and whe I mention this to one of the woman she seems not to care about it and did not apologgze.  At this point I kind of lost my appetite and soon after we left and on the way out I saw a cockroach crawling on the stairs.  I mention this to somebody who I know was at this plac before and he told me that he saw a cockroach there as wel...eewwwww!  Needless to say I am not going back to this place again until they clean up their act."}
{"text":"The service here is great, and the lunch buffet price is fabulous. Its I am a student and I love this place. great food while still good for my meal budget. I have brought so many of my friends here and they all have loved it.
A"}
{"text":"Went for the dinner buffet. Only their mango ice cream was good probably because they didn't make that themselves."}
{"text":"Advertised themselves as having a $13 buffet, tried to charge us for $18 after our meal. The food and setting itself is incredibly mediocre. Wouldn't recommend this restaurant to any one I know."}
{"text":"Can you put negative 10 stars? I do not believe this place should even get a 1 rating.  IT WAS ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING! When we walked in it looked dingy.  Also, I wanted to wash my hands so on my way to the bathroom, I saw that there were flies coming from the kitchen. When i got to the bathroom there was vomit in the sink and period trailing like dots on the floor.  The cook looked absolutely disgusting and seemed like he just broke out of curry prison and his sweat dripped in the food however, everywhere was closed on Christmas Eve and after traveling from New York for 10 hours we were absolutely tired and hungry. This was the worst decision we ever made.  We would not return and I recommend you do not come here.   I also  still have a bad case of the shittings. We left the restaurant and my brother has been on the toilet ever since.  We had to go across the street to McDonalds to eat like kings.  We spent $110 for nothing."}
{"text":"I like it. I am not going to say that it is the best Indian food you are going to have in Toronto, but look, it is probably the best bang for the buck within the 10 block radius. The selection is not overwhelmingly large, but what is there tastes good, and the service is just fine. 

Yep, I'll be going back regularly."}
{"text":"BEST authentic Indian restaurant hands down!!!
I've been to many Indian restaurants, when it comes to Joe's buffet Palace, everything is a great experience, when it comes to the price, there are two different prices lunchtime and dinner.. lunch is $12.99 and dinner comes to $18.00. I think those prices are amazing for an all you can eat authentic Indian buffet. Under $20!!!! And the staff are friendly. There are many different dishes to try, with  the name at the top of every dish so you know what you're eating. Everything is always fresh and hot, very tasty it really is a buffet in your mouth. Great location for amazing food. There is a lot of garbage fast food restaurants in the area. Yukkkkk you will get an entire full course meal as much as you want and be very satisfied by the time you leave. They also have complementary Nan bread. A good restaurant to have  businessman  take their clients to. I am a foody, so trust me when I say this place is the best!!!!! Enjoy xo"}
{"text":"I've been there twice.  The potatoes and the meat dishes were good.  Fresh naan was a constant.

There were some things that were not good at all.  The Saag Paneer had burnt air-filled cheese cubes, and one time they had freezer-burn sherbet as ice cream.

It's not bad, but there are definitely better options out there."}
{"text":"Changed my rating from 2 stars to 1 star, due to the attitude of either the staff or friends of Joe's Buffet Palace. I don't know why 8 of them think my review is \"funny\" (are they trying to troll me?) but I was not amused by the bad food experience I had here. I hope they continue to make fake 5-star reviews of this place because that is way funnier to me. I will never step foot in Joe's Buffet Palace again and will tell everyone I know to avoid it."}
{"text":"The food was pretty decent but it's absolutely incredible how long it took considering there were only about 2 other tables with people in the restaurant and they were all having buffet, so we were the only ones to serve, really. 
It took over an hour to get our dosas...

But with that said it was a cute place, decent price and yummy. Not the best I've had by any means but it's worth going to if you're in the hood and craving some indian food. Nice thing is that they have north indian and south indian. 

The food, minus the dosas and other south indian food, is quite spicy, so caution to anyone who doesn't like spice it's made for people who like proper brown food!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent Indian food for buffet style. The service was excellent, the server bought our table a fresh batch of naan which was touch. However, there wasn't much of a selection of ice cream so don't get your hopes up. Other than that, highly recommend for a 14.99 buffet."}
{"text":"Nice decor with plenty of seating for large groups. My boyfriend and I got seated right away. Staff frequently filled our waters and filled our naan basket. The food is really good, I'm surprised this restaurant doesn't have a higher rating. It's not oily like other Indian buffets I've been to. Many vegetarian options, and a few meat options."}
{"text":"Excellent food great service. Amazing value. Couldn't believe how cheap it was. Everything was amazing. Butter naan could have been better but no complaints at all. Even their salads were really good. I'm surprised this place isn't more busy. Must be the unfortunate location of being on the second level. Will be coming here again and again!"}
{"text":"It was an okay food. I have been to different Indian restaurants in Toronto and this place is not on the top of my list. The vegetarian choices are not really that great. It has a little off flavour, and texture. I was disappointed by the golab jamun as well it's just not that great. Sorry. Although I enjoy their ice cream."}
{"text":"Went for the lunch buffet. When we first arrived we wanted to wash our hands since we knew we were likely going to be eating Naan and curries so....clean hands are a must.  No soap available, we had to borrow a bit from the waffle girl in the next door business. The waffle girl was annoyed. Haha. We were happy to be squeaky clean.  We then enjoyed some great vegetarian dishes. Either that or we were starved and Service from our server was strange.  She actually scolded us office ladies when the debit machine timed out
  We felt like 7 year Olds. \"You talk to much and not pay attention\"  lol she had also scolded another costumer for using 2 napkins. Lmao"}
{"text":"I came here for their lunch buffet around 1pm on a Thursday, with a group of colleagues. The service was good, and I did not have any major complaints. 

For $14.95 you cannot go wrong!

They had the typical dishes: channa masala, matar paneer, saag paneer, baigan bartha, butter chicken, mutton curry, daal (lentil), tandoori chicken. Desserts; kheer (rice pudding), custard, ice cream, etc. 

Cons:
I was disappointed with the tandoori chicken. Most of the pieces were very dry and not edible.  
They only had strawberry flavoured ice cream. I would have liked some more variety, especially some indian flavours; pistachio kulfi, malai masti, mango. I'm pretty sure there are some really authentic flavours out there. 

The backroom staircase leading down to the washrooms is in need of major renovations. I was so turned off that I didn't even bother to go."}
{"text":"Why the low reviews, really. The many food items are rather distinctives. It is common in a buffet to have dishes with similar taste profiles. But I don't find so here. The butter chicken has a creamy quality and the lamb curry is presented with bones on. The nann bread are table served, chewy and sufficiently buttered. The service is discrete yet responsive."}
{"text":"Like everyone else, I don't understand the low rating. Decent price, amazing and authentic food. Service was fantastic and attentive. My family came here for Christmas eve because Scaddabush was closed - I'm so glad we did.

It's on the second floor of Wanda's, just beside Zanzibar. Once seated, its a self serve style buffet. There are more types of dishes and curries than my brain can handle but that's okay, don't think, just scoop. 

You also get complementary freshly baked naan - USE THIS. Do the kitchen and yourself a favor by wiping your curried dish clean with the naan (thank me later). 
For $15, you get a major bang for your buck, but regardless of price, this place is still top notch. We could not have asked for a better Xmas eve dinner, hell imma bring my family here for Chinese New Year next time and then Hanukkah next year. Will come again."}
{"text":"I've been to this place a few times mostly because my friends love coming here. They like about two blocks up so whenever we're in the mood for cheap food, and lots of it, we come here.

Plus, if you want some fun after..you can always go to Zanzibar next door (lol jk) 

It's your standard indian buffett items, nothing special.

But on the plus side, the prices are so cheap its ridiculous. 

10.95 for lunch, and 12.95 for dinner? 

Everytime i come, I feel like we're robbing this place blind.

The food is not the best I've had, but it's not the worst.

The best part though is DEFINITELY the fresh naan brought to your table whenever requested. It's fresh and hot and delicious and my mouth is dripping saliva as I think about it.

Another great note about this place : There's a handwashing station right next to the buffet. Perfect because we eat our indian food the authentic way...with our hands! 

Three stars, mostly because of the Naan.

Side note : Smoking is not allowed on their patio. Lame."}
{"text":"Food is prepared fresh. The dishes have a lot of flavour, however I felt that something was missing. Perhaps the chicken was over cooked? On a flip side, the staff is friendly and establishment is pretty clean."}
{"text":"Again, not sure why this place got so much hate in online reviews, but after coming here tonight for their dinner buffet I was actually quite pleased with the environment and overall food quality. 

Food- 3/5. After reading so many negative online reviews, I had 0 expectations for the food, but in fact the buffet trays were almost always full (they refill them frequently) and the vegetarian selection (much bigger and better quality than the meat selection) was very tasty and fresh! The sauce to content ratio was too high for some dishes, i.e. you really had to dig in there to retrieve a piece of eggplant. Complimentary naan is dropped off at your table, but different types of vegetarian rice, rotis, and appetizers were available as part of the buffet. Some of my fav veg dishes included the eggplant, chana masala (chickpeas), and dal makhani (lentils). I also enjoyed their random salad bar - the pickled carrots and boiled eggs were nice :P The dessert selection had a lot of rice pudding options, but fresh fruit such as oranges and melons were available. The \"carrot pudding\" was new to me - basically shredded carrots with raisins and a lot of sugar. The meat selection was very disappointing. Like other reviews have mentioned, they tend to use chicken thighs and those don't have a lot of meat in the first place. There were no seafood options tonight (or ever?). All the dishes are labelled above the buffet trays, so that was very helpful for a novice like me. Important note- all the cooked dishes are SUPER SALTY.

Value- 5/5. ~$15 per person for the dinner buffet is pretty solid. Approved by the student budget committee.

Service- 5/5. Friendly and quiet waitress, who was very prompt in clearing our used plates and refilling our water.

Venue- 4/5. Keeping in mind that this place is located beside an adult entertainment nightclub on the sketchy part of downtown Yonge between the 2 universities, I felt that the dining space, buffet area, and washrooms were pretty clean, well-lit, and welcoming. The dining space is quite spacious with really long tables that would be perfect for large group events, booth seating for families, and more intimate 2-person tables by the windows. On a Saturday evening, we were one of the only customers there, so it was very quiet and I liked that. 

Will be back!"}
{"text":"The food is average, I only get the food from here because it is close to where I work. The customer service I should say is non existence and they can be pretty rude sometimes. I am not going back there..!!!"}
{"text":"This place is legit. Great lunch buffet. Not sure of all the hate on yelp. It's not perfect but there's lots of variety and naan comes with the meal. Great butter chicken. Lots of veggie options.  Meal, tax, and tip came to $17 for lunch. Not bad.  Don't let the negative reviews scare you....."}
{"text":"It's not worth the money. Everything do taste same like curry. We tried all vegetarian dishes. Service was good but not great. The food wasn't flavourful. Everything was just cold. Nothing piping hot. The dipping sauces were too watery. The dishes were too sweet like channa masala, raita,saag. Tasteless food. Gulab jamun in buffet are generally served soft and warm but here it was hard and cold. We personally didn't find anything exciting to eat. The deserts tasted like powdered. I wouldn't recommend if you are really looking for Authentic Indian taste and flavours."}
{"text":"The price for dinner is $14.95 (or something close to $15).

Pros:
-dinner buffet (most indian places only have buffet for lunch)

Cons:
-the selection was abysmal. Most of the stuff I wouldn't eat.
-butter chicken had bones in it
-no lamb curry, chicken curry, etc
-not worth the $15!

I recommend going somewhere else... anywhere else. It's yonge st, lots of options. Like Salad King, Chipotle, etc."}
{"text":"This place was okay. Pappadum and naan were phenomenal but presentation wise the buffet was boring. Their ice cream is the crappy no name brand in a dirty freezer. Their desserts were bad and the baarfi wasn't good. Their butter chicken was good. Would go back only with a big group of friends."}
{"text":"This place does exactly the job a buffet is suppose to do. The naan bread is great, served hot at the table. The dishes are good. Not great. Good. Remember, this is a buffet, not a fine indian cuisine restaurant. Affordable."}
{"text":"I'd rate this place 3.5 stars. 

Huge selection of food - vegetarian, meat and dessert section, and a salad bar. However the taste was average, nothing blew me away. 

I took two pieces of papadum from the meat section and they were stale. The papadum from the rice/vege side was fresh and crispy. 

Also the naan was good, can't complain. I'm a naan lover but they only give 4 pieces of naan :/ 

So yeah, overall the experience was average. I've had better buffet with lesser selection but everything was yummy."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I ended up coming here Saturday night while on the hunt for dinner. I had come here a few years back and really enjoyed my first experience so figured I would take her here to hopefully enjoy my second. The staff here was pretty friendly and quick to pour some water and let us know how the place worked. This is a buffet style indian place (as you already know from the name) and does feature a pretty good variety of food (rice, multiple forms of chicken, lamb, marsala, etc). Now don't get me wrong, the food here wasn't necessarily bad, but none of it was very good either. Everything tasted pretty bland and not a single dish I had left me craving seconds. Towards the end of our meal the waitress brought us some Naan which was alright, but more on the crunchy side. Overall, I was pretty let down from the meal and I don't think I'll be giving this place a third try."}
{"text":"Love this place. They probably learned from their previous reviews since there's someone replenishing water, napkins or naan like every other minute. Butter chicken and masala chicken are the bomb, their spinach curry and curry goat were delicious too. Got a coupon from Dundas square that made the dinner buffet $13. So worth. I agree their dessert selection is abyssmal but you're not really coming here for dessert lmao"}
{"text":"Came hungry, left hungry. 
Vegetarian dishes are forgettable, meat dishes taste disgusting. 
Eggplant dish was drenched in some brown sauce, I guess to mask the lack of eggplant?


The cook is the same guy who used to run \"Saffron Tree\" on Bay & Gerrard. He can cook some veg curry, but he cannot cook meat. He should not be a cook, really.

Avoid this place!"}
{"text":"Not sure why the reviews for this place are so low.  Either I know jack-shit about Indian food (probably true) or that other people have unrealistically high expectations for a $12 Indian lunch buffet (also probably true).

Ya - far from the best Indian I've had and the meat selection was limited.  But perfectly all right for a cheapish lunch buffet stumbling distance from my apartment when I woke up starving.

Naan was bit too thick but the staff came back often with fresh naan.  They also have a patio overlooking Yonge if you are here on a nice day.  Service was pretty good -- just not sure why they play the Indian ambience music so loudly (shrug).

Overall - not bad, not great.  It's a fucken $12 buffet - what do you want?"}
{"text":"There are many better indian food restaurants and this one is a shame to the cuisine. Not only is the food not fresh but the service is disgusting. Poorly dressed and sloppy. The food has a weird smell and the ambience of the place is gross. Would never go there or recommend it to anyone. Please stay away if you can."}
{"text":"I found the Buffet Palace while at a conference in Toronto.

I didn't know what to expect.  Older building, lots of stairs, in need of some updating....

But I was pleasantly surprised.  Many curries both meat and veggie.  

Lots of selection, and lots of seating.

The food was exemplary.  I had the butter chicken and a curried goat and some Chana and eggplant.

The goat was very tender and flavourful.  There was a lot of spice, but it wasn't hot, or overbearing.

The butter chicken was falling apart as well. It was fantastic.

I must eat gluten free, and they had the food broken out well to accommodate me doing just that.

I also came early to avoid spoons being swapped out, and avoiding cross contamination.

The waitress was quite knowledgeable about what I could and couldn't eat and checked with the kitchen to make sure that I would not have any other issues.

Good experience.  Lots of good Bollywood playing on the big screens.  :)"}
{"text":"*We saw a cat inside the restaurant.*
One time we waited for 30 minutes for the food to be ready after opening. The other time, we waited for an hour after they were supposed to open. They should open on time and the food should be ready.
I saw a waitress there touching/holding the bottom of serving spoons with her hands and then putting them inside the dishes.
This same waitress was also rude to our table.
The food is OK, you can definitely find better Indian food out there.
The ambiance is also not the best. The place looks run down and unappetizing.

All in all, I recommend you go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Not the greatest small poor selection, the 1 star is for the food being flavorful and the fresh naan was good.   The dessert section was disappointing I don't  recommend this place tbh I didnt even get to try the mango ice cream and the flan looked a day or two old"}
{"text":"I paid $23(including tax, not including tip) for a weekend dinner buffet + a Kingfisher- pretty cheap. The food is surprisingly good for the cost. It was my first time here, and I asked the waitress if this was a new restaurant. She replied that it had been open for 15 years! The location is unbeatable. It's like 200 metres away from Yonge and Dundas square, and located on the second floor, right above Wanda's Waffles. 

They had great appetizers like samosas, chaat, bhajji etc. Also of note is their wide offering of sauces, chutneys, and pickles, which I was quite impressed by. They also have other sides like chaat, macaroni salad, onion salsa, and more. Everything tasted great!!

The main dishes were quite flavourful - Channa masala, Saag paneer, Daal, Malabar Fish Curry. Desserts are aplenty.  We also ordered naan, and while it wasn't the best I've had, it certainly was from terrible (I don't know what other reviewers are complaining about). 

The waitresses were super nice, and very attentive. The place is quite lovely. Especially enjoyed the view of bustling Yonge Street on a Saturday night. They also have a TV which was airing the Hockey game. I was stuffed by the time I left. Incredible value, and that too, in the downtown core."}
{"text":"We frequent this place once in a while. Always friendly service, the food is authentic and very tasty!"}
{"text":"Love this place. come for buffet a couple times a month. It's actually rather cheap, much cheaper than all of the Indian places I've been to around here (~$13 for lunch and ~$16 for dinner), and it's just as good if not even better. Stick with the buffet though"}
{"text":"Really good tasty food, several large tables for selection and you can't beat the price"}
{"text":"Just walking in, my mouth watered from the smell.

Clean place, lovely staff, $18 taxes in

Bathroom is too far of a walk lol

Dessert selection is aweful. Just ice cream.

But everything is super delis, 

Im not ashamed to say i had 3 plates full of carbs, totally worth the food baby.

For sure going back,"}
{"text":"I like their food and love their services this is my first time that I have eaten the Indian food and I was enjoy with it very much"}
{"text":"This place was close to the hotel so it was a quick in and out along the way to the St Lawrence market. Over all the food was above average with a nice selection of salads, rice , vegetarian and meat dishes. There were a number of dessert options as well, all of which were quite good. I wouldn't hesitate to stop there again, if I found myself in that area of the city."}
{"text":"I'm usually a huge fan of Indian food however this place did not cut it for me. 
In my opinion the food just was not really good at all. There were a lot of different items to choose from, all of which looked appetizing. They just did not taste great. Everything seemed bland. 
I only ate one plate, barely finished what was on it. Our server brought us naan towards the end of our meal, which was odd. 
The dessert section didn't look that great at all. I didn't even try anything. There was mostly just puddings.
I would not come back here, I did not enjoy it at all. On top of that, it was so expensive for a meal that was not good."}
{"text":"Good for those looking for a cheap buffet dinner that isn't all starch. 

Nice flavour:
eggplant masala
tandoori chicken
butter chicken
*orange colored cube desert (not sure of name)
*white rice desert (not sure of name)"}
{"text":"I found this place while in town on work.  Indian buffets always intrigue me because there are so many things to try and experience. Loved my meal and experience here.   Everything was absolutely delicious.  I tried so many new things!  The service was delightful, the atmosphere was casual, and the variety was VAST.  if you like Indian and trying lots of quality dishes, here is your chance.  I'm actually writing as I finish my meal!"}
