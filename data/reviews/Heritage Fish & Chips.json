{"text":"There is a lack of competition on this side of town. However, of the 3, maybe 4 that I have tried around here, heritage is by FAR the best."}
{"text":"A great family tradition for us! Friendly staff, quick service, and you can always count on the meals being fresh and super tasty. A side of onion rings and their iced tea go well with any of their fish and chips!"}
{"text":"Lunch special is definitely a great value meal. Previous comments and ratings proved to be correct. Would recommend this to anyone craving decent fish and chips.  Enjoy"}
{"text":"Just had some haddock and chips (takeout). Both my wife and I found the fish and the batter bland. Nothing really special about the chips either."}
{"text":"Fish bland Chips very crispy and over cooked Price went up because it was Good Friday by $6 I was brought up in England, I know Fish and Chips Just because it is a hol price goes up??"}
{"text":"Great fish & chips - not too greasy and a decent sized piece of fish, unlike some places, which have a ton of batter and tiny little sliver of fish!  Fast and friendly service."}
{"text":"Checked this place out for the first time tonight and loved it! We got fish and chips for takeout and it was delicious! Nice and fresh. Great service. This will be our new top choice for fish and chips!"}
{"text":"I have been eating fish and chips from heritage my whole life and I can't enjoy any other fish and chips, it is so fresh every time"}
{"text":"Halibut: Awesome Fries: OK.  But I will never return. You place the order at the cashier, and then wait for your order, then pay afterwards upon collection of your order. Problems: the cashier doesn't tell you an order number, nor does he take your name down. So you're left to wait with 20 or so other people who have all ordered before you. Then the cashier yells out \"Who ordered the fish special?\" OK we're at a fish and chips place. WE ALL DID. A group of four of us went, and one of us of course had their order stolen. With the wait time, we were tempted to just leave after placing an order."}
{"text":"One of the best (if not the best) fish and chips around.  More a take-out place than a dine-in restaurant, but the food is delicious. Good portions and not oily or greasy, like some fish and chips places.  The only down side is the fries aren't the best in the world. But the fish is the real star!"}
{"text":"Since moving from Europe I've been looking for a good Fish 'n' Chips shop and of all of the ones I've been to in the GTA this is the best."}
{"text":"Great food. Simply awsum....but u guys need to stay open later.  Way later. Please, 8:00pm is sad and pretty useless.  Thx."}
{"text":"Best fish and chips, good portions, even the service was ok. At least they were smiling while serving which is missing a lot nowadays....."}
{"text":"Best fish and chips in town! The Greek salad is also amazing! Deep Fried Mushrooms!!!!!!"}
{"text":"GREAT fish and chips or what ever you are int he mood for"}
{"text":"I came  here because i shop at the nofrills beside it and cuz i was hungry. I was treated to a nice staff and a delicious lunch"}
{"text":"Heritage is the go to place for fish and chips in Brampton and rivals some of the best in the GTA. Always fresh and good food. Portions are a generous size and the staff are very hospitable too."}
{"text":"I ordered the cod and chips. The batter gave a nice texture to the fish but the flavour is just not there. A little bit of seasoning would go a long way. The chips were undercooked and very flavourless as well. I have definitely had better F&C at other locations in Mississauga. I will say that the atmosphere is bright and clean."}
{"text":"Why do people give this place a good rating? I was turned off it completely.  The server met me at the front totally distracted and waved me in to seat myself. She brought the menu and I ordered a small salad and haddock fish and chips. That's when I noticed the flies around which were annoying and gross. She brought me the salad which had slimy tomatoes and soft cucumbers. The lettuce looked alright so I only ate that part. The dressing didn't taste like typical yummy Greek salad dressing.  After that I noticed she sat down at an empty table in the corner and was eating her own pasta out of a plastic container.  She brought my fish n chips to me and I noticed the tartar sauce was just regular packaged tartar sauce, I don't know what everyone else it talking about because I've had much better tartar sauce. The fish was meh and the fries were not tasty at all. Even with ketchup and vinegar.  I didn't finish my meal, the server came over with pasta sauce around her mouth and asked if I wanted it to go, I said no thank you. Paid my bill and left.  I will not be returning there to eat and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"The fish and chips were good. The fries were better then the fish and the gravy was amazinggggg but for one kids meal and 2 fish and chips came to 50$.. seems a bit pricy ..Maybe next time we'll try haddock instead of halibut but I don't eat fish and chips often and the guy working said it's a bit \" fishy tasting\" so we got the more expensive fish .. I see they have deep fried mushrooms and poutine so I'm sure I'll be back"}
{"text":"One of my families go-to restaurants where everyone can get something they like! The decor is dated in friendly, comfortable way. We always take the time to find where grandpa came from on one of the many maps. The servers (esp. Carol) are always great. The Fisherman's platter is perfect for sharing. The grilled salmon is awesome!  We haven't had anything we didn't like!"}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times with takeout hankerings when I've visited the accompanying plaza, and their lunch special has been satisfying every time! It's unfortunate that this is one of the few fish & chips restaurants available in the area, though I've never been disappointed and I'm certain I'll find myself here again!   Great value for haddock and chips (I believe) and quite the decent sized portion at that. They've been a pretty full house every time I've visited so clearly they're hitting the mark with a large audience! I've also tried their calamari, which was crispy and definitely very tasty as well. Overall I would recommend the lunch special, since that deal is what's had me returning on multiple occasions!"}
{"text":"Probably the best fish and chips in the GTA. Nice big pieces of fish and very good prices, no chance of leaving hungry. Restaurant is spacious and the staff are friendly, you really cannot go wrong. Very reasonable prices for dinner, $14 for; haddock, chips, mush peas (best around), soft drink and bread and butter. Reminds me of back home (England)"}
{"text":"I've been here about 7 or 8 times now either to pick up lunch for co-workers or for a quick bite with friends and the food has always been somewhere in the range of good to fantastic.   Their lunch specials are a great way to get what I would consider a full portion for about half the price (I don't think they offer halibut for the lunch special).   If you like deep-fried pickles, this place should be on your go to list, for $2.25 + tax you get a meal sized portion of hand battered deep fried pickles served with what I think is the same sauce they use for the battered mushrooms (it's delicious).   My only issue is that often I call ahead to pick up an order for the office, I do this so I won't have to wait once I get there, but every time I have to wait for another 10-15 minutes even if there's no one in line. I think they might cook everything partially and then wait for you to come in to finish it up so the food is at its best, but I would rather have it wrapped up and waiting for me. If I'm later than what I said, it's not their fault if the food quality isn't what I want it to be, but I really hate waiting."}
{"text":"Awesome little fish & chips place. Granted, it's in Brampton, and I wouldn't want to find my way here via public transit but if you're automotively-endowed, it's worth a check out!  Feels very authentically English with a great offering of standard pubfare like fish & chips, onion rings and specific British offerings like mushy peas and a host of imported pop like iron brew.  Great portion sizes and decent prices."}
{"text":"Portion was pretty decent for the $8ish lunch special. I got the halibut and the batter was nice and crunchy but the batter and fish was a little on the bland side for me. Also they did not give enough sauce packets with the meal. I got thick cut fries and I'm not sure if they salted it but it could have used some extra salt."}
{"text":"This is the BEST Fish and Chips Restaurant in all of Brampton.  I have eaten here many times and have never been disappointed.  Try:  Battered Mushrooms...so awesome! Haddock and Chips Grilled Salmon with chips and veggies Mushy Peas Deep Fried Mars Bar.  Excellent food, very friendly service. Decent pricing too. I eat here whenever it's Fish and Chips that I want."}
{"text":"Just had the lunch special.  Haddock and chips.  Customer service was excellent.  The older gentlemen was very friendly with a good sense of humour.  I had take out and the size of the haddock was huge!  The fish and fries were cooked to perfection and the excellent portion size, price and customer service are top notch!  No wonder this place has been in business for so long.  They do everything right! They even have Pop and sweets imported from UK as well as a footie match on an old tube tv! Just like England! Never been ,but this is much cheaper then flying there."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS fish and chips! Sit in or take-out. The staff is very friendly and the atmosphere is great. Quick service and amazing lunch special."}
{"text":"Best fish and chips and batter mushrooms in brampton! I am never disappointed when I eat here. The fries and onion rings are really good as well.   My husband always upgrades his fries to poutine, I think the gravy might be a turkey or chicken base because the colour is light. They use real cheese curbs which are gooey and yummy.  I always swap out fries for Greek salad. Everything is always fresh and crisp and the dressing seems homemade.  It's one of my fav greek salads.  As for the fish, the batter is my favorite almost like a beer batter, very crispy and  just the right about of grease.  Not to worry, the oil is always fresh, so it never tastes stale. If I feel like spending a few more bucks, I order the Icelandic white fish which is similar to a butter fish. But you can never go wrong with their halibut.   If you enjoy beer as much as I do, try the Scottish beer called tennents, it's a pale larger full of flavor."}
{"text":"The best Halibut in Brampton. Haddock is also very good but the chips are bland."}
{"text":"We always enjoy this local place. The servers are pleasant and you know what you are getting. My favourite is the greek salad option for side it has a lovely light dressing."}
{"text":"I like fish and chips as much as the next person so I thought I would give this place a try given a) the yelp review b) the reviews of coworkers about this specific location.  You'll see in the pictures that the portions are pretty big (plusplusplus) but for approx 10-15$ they better be.  The best thing of this meal was the tartar sauce though... (interesting point..those little packets of tartar sauce (PC brand but not president's choice) are the best tartar sauce ever.  Several people at work and I all agreed that we've neevr tried tartar sauce better than that anywhere else...anyone else know a place with great homemade tartar sauce let me know!!!)   Maybe it was just this run, or that we brought it back to the office first but:  1) The fries were soggy.  They were good in that way where you can taste through the sog and know that there was so much potential there...  2) I thought the fish was oily which for fish and chips is probably a must.  But these were so oily that they went through the plates/napkins and oiled up the table beneath.  But even with all the oil...I could only describe these as dry.  How could they be dry when they were this oily????  And don't take my word for it.  We had an ex halagonian (from halifax...its how they like being called) who also tried my fish and said the same thing.  I would have rated this place higher except for these two reasons.    1) The halagonian holds strong sway on my opinion given her heritage with fish and seafood of all kinds   2) While I love eating oil especially if its disguised as food (because just eating oil is currently something that only future generations would appreciate and understand...like einstien or the catcher in the rye) but seriously...I couldn't taste anything else for the rest of the day but oil  However, the place has potential and maybe it just requires going there sitting down and having a proper old fashioned eating...so until then..."}
{"text":"Been coming to this location for many years now, ( every Sat Night ), never had a bad meal.  Staff is great, very quick service, great menu Highly Recommended !"}
{"text":"Yelp got the best of me. Went to this place based on the dominant 5 star reviews and even went for the Fisherman's Platter!! Shared a haddock and the fries with my girls and nothing remained to take home. The fried shrimps were succulent. Unimpressed with the fried scallops, haddock, and halibut which is 80% of the order. Aunty Mary's at Scarborough Golf Club Rd and Lawrence, Scarborough still is #1 for halibut in my books."}
{"text":"Just opened this location near me which I was looking forward to. First experience did not disappoint.  Had halibut and chips with gravy and it was really good. Was really busy so I had to wait a bit for takeout but good job and good luck"}
{"text":"Pretty good. I was here for Good Friday which is likely the busiest day of the year. It might also not be not the fairest day to judge the place since it was not a typical day, but they seemed to be managing it fairly well.  They raised their prices for Good Friday, and I'm hoping that it was a substantial raise; otherwise, the prices would not be as cheap as other reviewers stated. Haddock (1 pc.) and chips was about $15 and Halibut (1pc., 4 oz.) and chips was nearly $20.   Overall, it was pretty solid. Nothing stood out too much, but they did a good enough job.  Probably a 3.5 that could possibly be a 4 on another day when the value is better and they're not slammed. Quite a large place and fairly nice inside."}
{"text":"I have known of Hertiage from the Brampton restaurants so I wanted to try the Mississauga location. As a ex-pat I am picky about Fish and Chips so I wanted to try them. I ordered a Halibut and chips and drink and found the fish rather dry and hard to cut into. So disappointed and won't be going back especially for the price  I paid over 20 dollars . Right now there is alot of good fish and chips restaurants in Mississauga so they will have to step there game up."}
{"text":"The lunch specials are a decent value, but the fish suppers are overpriced for what you get, especially the halibut. You can also really tell when the oil has degraded and the fish and chips become soggy with grease. More of an institution than a destination."}
{"text":"Finally came here with my boyfriend, as I often tell him about this place but we never have had the change to. We ordered calamari, mozzarella sticks, the Fisherman's platter (for him) and the grilled salmon (for me). The mozzarella sticks were good but nothing special, but the calamari was amazing! It was soft and tender and not chewy at all. I usually order the deep fried items but I decided to try something different. The salmon was a bit underwhelming, dry and not much flavour, and the vegetables that came with it was not good at all (probably frozen vegetables which I am not a fan of). My boyfriends plate on the other hand was a winner! I ended up eating from his plate as I didn't really like mine.   I really like this place as I often ate here when I was younger. My recommendation is to order the Fisherman's platter and share it with two (or maybe even three) people."}
{"text":"Got the fisherman's platter.  The fish and chips were really good ! The place is a bit old and not much to talk about in the decor. It's a quick in and out, not a place to hang out after you finish eating the meal. Service was good."}
{"text":"Ordered take out tonite and picked up food onion rings to die for and fish salad and homemade fries was awesome !! I give this place a 10/10 was excellent fresh and tasty !"}
{"text":"For a lot of British ex-pats in Brampton/Mississauga this is your typical chip shop. They even offer sweets from the UK plus some other treats.   Their specialty is Halibut & Chips. However, it can be a bit pricey at $17.00 for a Halibut steak and chips.  The Haddock is almost 1/2 the price.   The staff are friendly and the service is quick.  The take out is very busy on Fridays - so call ahead to avoid the wait."}
{"text":"our group of four all enjoyed our visit here, the food tasted good, was well presented. Staff were friendly, British decor is good and comfortable, the stainless fish shop take away counter looks very British, did not notice it until leaving.Only critiques would be the clam chowder not so good, and the enormous portion of chips was a challenge to everyone, a little wasteful, Maybe a smaller plate? or regular / large choice? Wish i lived closer...."}
{"text":"Don't doubt your GPS. Heritage Fish & Chips really is in the plaza where you'll enter but it is all the way at the back. There, you will find a quaint little pub-like interior filled with all sorts of British knick-knacks inside.  I originally sought out Heritage Fish & Chips after finding out that Mississauga Fish & Chips was closed on Sundays. While there is only so much one can do with fish & chips, it is possible to screw it up so I don't like to chance places I don't know. Everything worked out at Heritage so I've now got a new option in the area!  Prices are better than fair and portions are enormous. What's not to love?"}
{"text":"It occupies a mere corner of a No Frills building at Queen/Highway 410. While it is filled with English-style decorations that make for a quaint interior, it's nothing impressive. What is impressive, however, is their seafood.  They have such a large selection of seafood, from scallops and shrimps to their signature Alaskan halibut. With a restaurant renowned for its variety of seafood, I was tempted to try as many as possible. They allow you to do this with their Fisherman's Platter, which includes battered halibut, haddock, shrimp, and scallops. It was fried, crispy, goodness. For $16, it was great value considering the portion size.   For those that want cheaper options, there's a lunch special for haddock and chips that costs only $5.95 for takeout and $7 for dine-ins. Why the difference in price?- I have no clue.   While they specialize in battered seafood, they also have plenty of grilled options. And they do more than just fries for sides - they also have a variety of salads, as well as baked potatoes. I haven't tried these, and given the distance from where I live, I don't know if I ever will. But if you are nearby, do please go to Heritage if you want anything seafood."}
{"text":"One of the newer Heritage locations.  I came here for lunch with my parents on a Sunday. The place is well decorated - with one wall covered with prints of London roads, giving the appearance of dining al fresco. There are a handful of tables here, as well as a TV in the back on the restaurant which was playing the soccer game going on at the time.   I ordered a steak and onion pie with fries - it came out to under $10. The pie was very good, especially with the gravy provided. I gotta add, however, that I can't comment on authenticity as I've never been to the UK.  My parents ordered the seafood combination platter, which came with 3 scallops, 4 shrimps, haddock, and halibut. They seemed to enjoy their meal as well.  The food wasn't too oily like some fish and chip places can get. That's one of the keys for me. Definitely worth giving Heritage a shot if you're nearby. Hope they open a location in central Mississauga!"}
{"text":"This is a great fish and chips restaurant. The lunch special is great value and well done. Be warned, this place is quite busy during lunch hours. The service is always great and the servers are friendly and attentive. Light batter which does taste greasy and the fish (usually haddock) is nice and flaky and moist. There is wide variety of side options. I've had rice, fries, Greek salad and poutine in he past. Their chips are great, well done, crispy on the outside and soft inside. They use fresh curds on the poutine with a nice rich beef gravy. Greek salad is also good. You can even mix sides, ie. half fries and half salad. I once had the steak and kidney pie and is was disappointing, taste like t was a frozen pie. This restaurant also serves beer and they have a decent selection. Usually get a Guinness or Smithwicks if I feel like a beer.  I highly recommend this restaurant in you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Haven't been here for a few years since I went away to school but it was my favourite fish and chips place in Brampton.  I would come here every Friday with my family.  We always ordered the battered mushrooms and four orders of fish and chips.  It is flaky and delightful and the service is friendly. As a child I would always get the shirley temples. They are delicious!"}
{"text":"I was introduced to Heritage Fish & Chips when I was a young boy and refused to eat fish pasta again on Good Friday. I'm still undecided to whether I should have started my fish & chips experience with Heritage, because it's been hard for anything to measure up.   This location, tucked behind the No Frills off the 410, has the benefit of a take-out area and dining area, complete with separate entrances. When I do visit, the service is always top notch. You're almost treated like family. The thickness in the air from the frying batter makes your mouth water as you await your meal.  I generally order the Halibut with Chips, but prices for Halibut have gone up. A friendly posting on the wall explains why, and requests that you order something other then halibut so the population can once again climb to sustainable levels. I now go with Haddock.   Either way, the food is excellent every time. The batter is crisp and not too greasy. The fish is flaky and tasty. The fresh-cut potatoes are as good as fries can get.   But if you're planning to go on Good Friday, bring a snack. The wait can be a while."}
{"text":"Heritage is probably Brampton's most popular fish and chip place. And with good reason. The food is great and the English \"heritage\" is apparent. Prices are perhaps a little on the high side but not overly so. A quality meal every time."}
{"text":"Just came back from my first (and last) visit to This fish and chip shop. It was truly horrible. I had such high hopes. Ordered the haddock and chips. The fish was okay at best - breading was soggy and fish was fairly tasteless. The chips were the worst. Not even cooked. Fat, cold, uncooked pieces of potato. Yuck. Even the tartar sauce was in packets and gross.  Most of my $35 order went in the garbage. Avoid this place."}
{"text":"Good fish, fries not so good, basic decor, good friendly service, good menu selection. I had the Haddock and some Haggis (which was also pretty good)."}
{"text":"I luv it. I don't understand the couple complaints here, maybe competitors posting to try to steal business. But I would not waste my time buying fish and chips anywhere else in Brampton. This place has great lunch deals and tasty food all the time. The staff is great and the food is awesome. The one bad thing is the tarter sauce is those cheap cafeteria ones. I always take out and use KRAFT tarter sauce at home, I myself love the Kraft TARTER sauce. Anyways check this place out you'll love it just bring your own tarter sauce."}
{"text":"the portion is big! the price is good. i paid about $34 for.. side of veggies (big portion) 2 haddock and fries..small gravy (.75cents extra)..2 cokes. we were sooo full."}
{"text":"Had the fisherman platter and everything in it was superb. My fave was the scallops and haddock. Got the poutine on the side and they gave a generous amount of cheese and gravy. Service was great. Will be coming here again!"}
{"text":"Their lunch special was a great price. The fish was hot and delicious. However, my onion rings were undercooked and my boyfriend's poutine was cold."}
{"text":"Agreed with all of the previous reviews that Heritage is a top notch fish and chips place.  I ate here once by chance as we were driving north and had to take out food quickly on the road.  We detoured into a mall and saw a lot of cars in front of the store.  We took it as a good sign and joined the line up.  We were wowed by the quality: the halibut was thick (1 inch I think), the scallops were fresh and sweet, the tartar sauce was the best (or just my perception, but it tasted great with the seafood).  All were well fried and wrapped in some newspaper the old fashioned way.    I have never been one who love fried food, but I have fallen in love with Heritage.  Heritage is a great find.  I have no reservation recommending it to anyone who loves fish and chips.    Please note that Heritage has 3 Brampton and 1 Milton locations.  I don't know if they all taste the same, but I guess you can check the reviews of other locations."}
{"text":"I have been on a search for a great English Style fish and chip joint and I believe I've found it. I was out in Brampton and did a quick google search for Fish and Chip places....and this location popped up. We (2of us) arrived last night about 20 minutes before the place closed. Despite this, the waitress who came over was great...although we knew that it would be impossible to order our food and eat it prior to their posted closing date. We both ordered Halibut and Chips....and holy hell...the piece of fish is the biggest we've ever gotten at a restaurant. It was cooked perfectly, had the right amount of batter on it and was delicious. The chips were home cut and there were plenty of them. Overall a great experience with fantastic food. Ya gotta check this place out."}
{"text":"Having had such a great experience at the Heritage location on Fisherman's Way, we decided to give this place a shot while in the area. It's in a plaza with Grocery Store next door, but the signage (blue) is clearly visible when you drive in off Queen St. What hits you right away is the size of the place..it is quite huge with plenty of seating. Our server was over fairly quickly after we sat down. I knew what I wanted but my dining companion wanted to peruse the menu to look at other dishes. Our waitress took our drink order and when she returned with them, we ordered our food. Both us got the Halibut and chips (at $16/each) with two pops.  After what I'd consider a normal wait-time, our food appeared. Our waitress asked if we'd like lemon or tartar sauce.....I opted for neither, my dining companion asked for tartar sauce. This is the reason for the loss of 1 star....the tartar sauce wasn't homemade...it was those plastic, sealed containers of tartar sauce that cheaper places offer you. To me, a place whose main business is fish, should go the extra mile and make their own tartar sauce. Huge piece of halibut (the menu says 4oz) with a generous amount of home made fries. It was deeeelish ! The bill came to just over $41 with 2 orders of Halibut and chips and 2 pops. Not the cheapest lunch I've ever had, but worth it for the portion size and quality of the food. I'd definitely return to this place."}
{"text":"A small but wonderful place!! Great and friendly service, great food, nicely decorated interior, good location with convenient parkings.   Their menu has quite good selections and reasonably priced. We had grilled salmon fillet and grilled basa fillet. Very nicely prepared!  Definitely deserves many more visits."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for 15 years. It is the best dish and chips in the greater Toronto area. The best tartar sauce. The desserts are something to try as well. The owner and the staff are very friendly."}
{"text":"Lots of parking and this is one of the larger locations.  We came here on Good Friday and it was super busy which was expected. They also charge more on this holiday which is very tacky. 20 minutes after ordering they told me the temperatures dropped in the fryers and that caused a delay but our meals would be out soon.  I had the Haddock and onion rings. Next time ill get the chips since the fish is smaller to fit the rings on the plate. The rings were too crispy and light."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant with british ambiance serves great fish and chips with beer of your choice. Battered fried mushrooms were the best partwith the daily specials fish and chips i ordered."}
{"text":"I don't get the hype. Got take out on a Friday night and found the halibut chewy and definitely not fresh. I get that it's not out of the water that day but I expected better for all the great reviews. Fries tasted like they were frozen. Really wanted to like this place, won't be going back."}
{"text":"Definitely the best fish and chips I've ever had!!!! The fish is very oily and definitely not healthy for you an the fries are hand cut fries. The only catch that this is in Brampton and at the same time you must finish when the food still warm not that good after you warm it up again."}
{"text":"Had dinner here Sept 25/14. More like a 3.5*. Pretty decent Fish & chips. Had Halibut (4 oz) & chips.  I asked for the chips to be well done but they weren't to my liking. You can't send em back cause this messes up the flow if the meal. Also had a side order of scallops, they were good but didn't blow me away. Very small (9 Scallops) for the order & they cost $11.00!! All-in-all decent meal but I would break my neck going back again."}
{"text":"Oh how the mighty have fallen.   Pricing has gotten out of control, quality has taken a huge slide, cleanliness has taken a back seat.   It's time to move on, Brampton. Heritage has forgotten their heritage."}
{"text":"Charming British decor, and many imported British drinks and treats.  They have a great lunch special. $5 for just fish, $7 if you want mashed potatoes or fries, $9 if you want caesar salad. The lunch special comes with haddock and is 1 (large) piece. The fish was great, it wasn't too greasy and the batter held its shape but wasn't overfried. I really enjoyed the caesar salad - the dressing is creamy, thick and flavourful. The onion rings were huge, but I didn't like how greasy they were. A bowl of lemon slices are served long before we got our food.  They get really busy quickly during lunch.  Wifi password is 11111111 (eight '1's in a row)."}
{"text":"This place is relatively new to Bolton so we decided to pop in for lunch. Great little atmosphere and the fish and chips is fantastic. The batter is nice and light the haddock is fluffy and the chips are awesome  Great service and friendly service. Highly recommend the place."}
{"text":"Food is good.  I prefer not such thick fries and they  could have been cooked more. Fish was cooked nicely and I do like the Tatar sauce. Gravy is good not watery. Onion rings were a generous portion."}
{"text":"We have been to Heritage many times and it was always good. Last evening we had dinner there and will never go back! The scallops had a tough breading and they oozed grease when I bit into one! My husband had halibut and it was the same tough and greasy, the fries looked as though they were heated over and were soggy, unediable! We work hard for our money and will not ever waste it on a meal there again!"}
{"text":"Of all my pre-gluten free desires, this one tops the list. They make the best fish and chips I have ever had. It is so crunchy, has just the right amount of batter and is fried to perfection. I find it more and more difficult to find halibut these days, but heritage still has it and it's oh so worth the higher price tag.  I highly recommend the fisherman's platter. It's big enough for two, a great price and a nice variety of things to try. It comes with halibut and haddock, shrimp and scallops and you can choose to order the platter only, or pair it with fries. And who wouldn't want fries?  I believe it also comes with buttered bread and mushy peas.  They also have the best tartar sauce I have ever tried! I don't know what's in it or where it's from but holy crap it's good!  So come, relax and enjoy the food and the ambience. It's a great little place for a relaxing and delicious night out!   Oh and in terms of gluten free, for now the only things available are salad (sigh) and grilled fish. So it's possible but mostly just depressing because I know what I'm missing"}
{"text":"Fish and Chips is good here.  Not greasy and portions are good.  There are plenty of seafood choices to choose from.  Fried or grilled... so there is healthier menu choices. Fried pickles are great and worth the cost.  The fried clam strips is a ripoff.  Breaded mushrooms are ok.  There are 2 locations that I know of.  On Queens St and the other is on Fisherman Dr... both in Brampton. I find that the Queen St location is more professional at the pick up counter.  Plus they do not screw up your order."}
{"text":"Great portions.  The place is a bit outdated but who cares when the food is good.    We ordered battered pickles and mushrooms apps.  For $4 ea how can you go wrong.  For our main, we ordered the 6oz Halibut... one with mash potatoes which comes with gravy and the other with rice; seasoned with red and green peppers and chicken broth.  The fish was not too greasy and lightly battered.    Service was friendly and they checked in a couple of times to make sure everything was ok.  Next time we will try their fish off the grilled menu... I saw a customer had ordered it and it looked delish!"}
{"text":"My review revolves around the lunch deal. I feel it is a very decent price for fish and chips and it is tasty. If woukd suggest,  when you order it ask them to mix it up (fries and onion rings). Their onion rings are big and crunchy! Good experience for fish and chips!"}
{"text":"top notch! Fresh and delicious! Tried it a few days back and have been craving it since. Can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"This is probably the best FISH & CHIPS that Ive ever been to. And the CHEAPEST, too. Very generous portion for a very cheap price. Lunch special: Haddock with a choice of your side (fries, onion rings, rice, or salad) Starts from $7-$9 only. They serve these from 11-3pm! I bet you'll still have leftovers after. Very flavourful, although it may get a little greasy. The interior is a little outdated & needs improvement, but we're all after the food.. RIGHT?"}
{"text":"Average fish and chips, but great prices.  The decor in the restaurant is cliche and dated, but it doesn't really bother me.  The wait staff are always very friendly and nice.  I do enjoy their chips and gravy that I order with it, however they do tend to be a tad limp and greasy.  The fish is usually nice and crispy and fresh.  If you want the best experience for the food, eat in, as by the time you get it home it may be soggy and disappointing."}
{"text":"This place is awesome and is now in Mississauga. I use to always get Heritage fish and chips when I was working in Brampton. The lunch special is huge and the fish is cooked to perfection. I eat here at least 2-3 a month and have not been disappointed."}
{"text":"Nice lunch spot  The best fish and chips in the Brampton area!  Section of authentic British products/chocolate"}
{"text":"I have been to other Heritage Fish & Chips locations and this place continues the trend of outstanding fish and chips.  Located in a small plaza..it's easy to miss it.....but it's worth searching out. I ordered the Halibut and chips, lightly battered. Fish size was enormous...taste was fantastic...perfectly cooked. Chips are home cut...and a very healthy portion size.  Staff are super friendly. I drive here from Woodbridge as its so good."}
{"text":"Very unassuming place. Was in the area having something done to my car and asked the business for a place to it. They recommended this and the fried chicken next door. I opted for the fried fish especially since I hadn't had it a long time. Pretty good portion of Alaskan haddock and onion rings with slaw. Rrrrrrreallllly tasty. It's what momma ordered.  The fish wasn't overly battered which is good. Not healthy by any means but tasty. Would definitely recommend.  Ohhhh and their coffee isn't bad."}
{"text":"This is a very different food review than what I usually write....  We did go to this location, it was small, but, new and clean. Sat down in the dining room area looked over the menu and liked what we saw, the food looked fantastic.  The waitress that served us was very nice and helpful. When time came to take our order, we asked \"is the fish fresh or frozen?\" She confirmed all the fish served was frozen, nothing was made with fresh fish.   In that instance, we lost our appetite. I'm honestly not sure if this is normal for all Fish and Chip places, but, in today's day and age, I definitely prefer fresh fish at these prices. Sadly, we left her a tip and left  without trying the food."}
{"text":"Solid 3.5.  It is is a great place for a quick  fish and chips. Nice wait staff  given how busy this place is during lunch hours. My only complaint is that it provides only packaged tartar sauce during lunch time."}
{"text":"Well, definitely don't go here if you're looking for a healthy meal.  But, everything we ate, from mushrooms to pickles to onions and to the cod, was covered in a nice batter and came with a good sauce for dipping.  I quite enjoyed the layout of the restaurant, and the staff was very pleasant :) .  If you're looking for a deep fried dinner, this is the place to go!  Oh, and their chocolate éclairs are just fricken delightful, definitely get one of those for dessert :P :) !"}
{"text":"It was my first night in Toronto after arriving from a red eye. We wanted to have something simple, so we went straight to eat fish and chips.  When I arrived, not only was the staff kind of aloof with a \"whatever\" kind of attitude, I totally felt like they were just annoyed they had to help anyone. When I was paying, the girl at the front was looking around and just giving me this very annoyed demeanor. My friends and I just shook it off and thought maybe she had a bad day.   When I paid, I mistakenly left my card in their credit card machine (my fault) and then the manager or whoever was in charge shouted \"someone left their card!\" And then I realized it was me, but before that she threw my card and it bounced on the table before i caught it. She was also helping another customer who saw it and I was like.. wow. That is kind of rude. I wouldn't throw someone's credit card because they left it by accident. Then she yelled out \"I need a signature\" kind of loud. How is it my fault that I didn't sign? The other girl said you're all set, in that boorish, uncaring tone.   The food was nothing special. They use tartar sauce packets. PACKETS. They don't even make it in-house. What a disgrace. They also gave me the wrong order. I ordered a grilled fish (not salmon) and i got a salmon. I ended up not bothering to let them know. Not only would it take another 20 minutes to make, but I had enough of their attitude for one night.   So We left shortly, and decided that we wouldn't come back. It was a terrible experience. I mean it might sound like something small but I felt like they treated us with no respect."}
{"text":"I grew up eating here as the fresh fish fries were  a big part of a celebration.  The fish is always moist and for a very vey causal place service is good and fast.  The batter is perfect for me though some of my party the last time felt it was too much.  The only struggle I have is over 20 years it feels the fish has gotten smaller but then again the prices have not increased as much as other places.  Good value for money."}
{"text":"the best fish and chips in ontario  by far the best  lunch special is best bang for your buck!"}
{"text":"I ordered the lunch special which was 3 pieces of generous Haddok with fries upgraded to poutine. The fries looked and tasted freshly cut, with big cheese curds. The Haddok fish didn't have much oil either considering it was fried. The place was full with English decor, even at 1:30 pm. The waitress was very patient and kind. I also had the battered mushrooms, which were okay and nothing noting to order. My wife had the grilled Salmon with steam veggies and Greek salad. It was very tasty she said, but to big. For hers was $13.00 inc tax which included 2 very big Salmons, she left one, as the veggies and salad were also big. We also both tried the fish soup, which I have to say is nothing short of amazing. I wish I could've took more pics, there is true quality."}
