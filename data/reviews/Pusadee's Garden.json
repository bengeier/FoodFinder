{"text":"This wonderful little gem of a restaurant located in Pittsburgh has some the best Pad Thai I've had east of the Rockies. Although we had a party of 7 and it was on a short notice 24-hour reservation, they accommodated us quickly and efficiently, bringing out both appetizers and entrees with expert timing without compromising the quality or service. The Pumpkin Curry was excellent and the green curry is highly recommended, as is the spice level of 6 ; try it you'll love it!"}
{"text":"The food was very good. I had the pork meatballs on sugar cane as an app, and the crispy tilapia as a main. Their Thai iced tea and mago juice are quite good as well. Their outdoor garden ambiance is lovely.

Unfortunately, they had major issues with service the night I went. My table was not thoroughly cleaned and had splotches of left-over curry from a previous diner's meal. Also, we received our appetizers 50 mins after we arrived, and our entree took well over an hour to show up. I'm normally more patient with slow service, but it was a pretty chilly day outside and waiting a half hour for the check was excruciating. 

I gather slow service is not an unusual from the other reviews, so try to come on a warm night and be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"As far as Thai food goes Nicky's is the measure for me.  Was excited to try Pusadees for a new experience.  They are BYOB, which I enjoyed as we brought what we liked.  The parking is street parking but there were plenty of free options available when we arrived around 7pm on a Saturday.  
Made reservations which was good because we got seated outside in the garden which was the best way to experience the restaurant and saw that a wait was forming just after 7pm.  
We ordered 2 appetizers, the crispy crab roll and steamed pork dumplings.  Both came out quickly and hot even though they were pretty slammed.  My wife ordered the pineapple curry with shrimp and I ordered pineapple fried rice with chicken.  The server said they are 2pts spicier than other places so we both got 5/10 spice level which provided a good burn, def a 7 equivalent.  Got coconut ice cream for desert which was good to put out the fire in my mouth from the entree.  Food was excellent and on par with Nicky's for sure.  We will def be back to try more things from the menu."}
{"text":"So delicious. Just had leftover Pumpkin Curry for lunch. I'm sorry I didn't save more for myself. All the appetizers are super fun and tasty. The garden outside is lovely."}
{"text":"So far I would say this is my favorite for thai food in Pittsburgh!  

The outdoor garden seating is gorgeous and the inside seating looked simple and pleasant.  

The food was pretty standard, but I was only able to try the crab fried rice and pad see ewe.  Overall, I like when my thai food is flavorful, but not greasy!  Noodles were a good consistency and the flavors yummy!

I'm definitely going to have to go back to try the street food noodles that everyone raves about and to enjoy their BYOB!"}
{"text":"Great food and unique atmosphere. The roofed portion of the garden is nice even in the rain, barring cold weather. BYOB for $1/person."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. Cute outdoor seating area, delicious food, prompt friendly service. I've never had a bad experience here. They don't insult you with their spice level (meaning that it's HOT) like some other Thai restaurants. The tofu is consistently cooked perfectly. I've had the crispy tofu, crispy spring rolls, curry puffs, tong tongs, tom ka soup, every one of the curries, the pad see ew and pad kee mao and all of it every time has been delicious."}
{"text":"My new favorite Thai restaurant! The curry puffs and egg rolls were a delicious start to my meal. You only get two, but it's well worth it. I had green curry chicken as my meal, which was flavorful and had many fresh vegetables. I recommend it next time you're on butler street, but try to make a reservation."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend, shared the spring rolls and the pork dumplings as appetizers then got one of their \"street noodles\" for my main dish. The food was definitely good, but I have to say it wasn't as flavorful as I expected. I enjoyed it and would recommend it if you wanted Thai in Lawrenceville, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again for the food itself. 

I would definitely recommend this on a nice day as a beautiful place to eat outside! The garden atmosphere was wonderful, and I had great service."}
{"text":"Pusadee's Garden may have put itself at the top of a few of my personal \"favorites\" lists: favorite Thai food in the 'burgh, favorite outdoor dining spot, favorite BYOB...yes, it was really was that good!

I'd been wanting to try this place for some time.  I called on a Saturday afternoon, right when they opened up (around 4pm) and was able to make a reservation for a table in the garden area at 8pm that evening.  In preparation, a trip to the local Wine & Spirits was necessary. We picked up a bottle of Kung Fu Girl Riesling, which pairs well with spicy Thai dishes.  And now, on to the food!

Based on recommendations from other Yelp reviewers, I went with the Pumpkin Curry with Tofu.  It definitely did not disappoint!  The curry was sweet and just a little spicy, with tender chunks of kabocha squash and zucchini throughout.  I ordered a side of brown rice (subbed for white for $1.50) and washed it all down with my Riesling...I was a happy girl!

I can't properly review Pusadee's Garden without mentioning the beautiful ambiance of said garden.  A trellis covers the patio seating area, allowing vines to grow and create a \"roof\" over the patio.  Strings of twinkling lights, flowering plants, and wrought iron tables transport you from Butler Street to a tranquil Thai garden.  

The food and ambiance made up for the severe lack of friendly service.  I don't think our waiter spent more than 30 seconds total with our table, but I didn't even care.  It gave me more time to enjoy good company, good food, and good wine!  I'd recommend this place in a heartbeat and can't wait to return this summer."}
{"text":"Went with some friends for after work dinner.  If you don't know already, it's BYOB.  I am now a fan of BYOB.  I ordered the pork meatballs, chicken satay, and the cabbage salad.  No complaints.  We were sitting on the patio in the heat and humidity.  The experience could have been made better by some standing fans.  Here's something unusual about this place: Our table of 7 was informed that they only accept 2 credit cards per check.  It meant for some scrambling trying to figure out who paid what."}
{"text":"This is the best Thai in Pittsburgh. Period. Others might try to lure you astray, but they are heathens.

The outdoor dining space is a green, vertiginous wonder, easily the best outdoor dining in the city. But the inside is also cozy and commodious, with a high tin ceiling and warm tea lights; the service is great inside and out.

The green curry is the best I've ever had; ditto the massaman curry. The crispy crab rolls and pork meatballs (grilled on sugar cane skewers) are my favorite appetizers, but everything's excellent. The vegetables are always fresh, they grow their own herbs, everything comes out piping hot, and when they're briefly in season, the soft-shell crabs are tremendously happy-making.

I've never had a bad experience here, and I come here a few times a month. The food is fresh and delicious, the space is literally delightful, and the service is faultless.

AND ALSO: BYOB! :D"}
{"text":"The food was excellent, but for the price you pay the portions are small. We tried the see yew noodles with chicken and the red curry with pork. See yew was good, I wouldn't say it was better than Noodlehead or Nicky's Thai, but it was enjoyable. The red curry was.... okay. It somewhat smelled like the elephant exhibit at the Zoo (order it and tell me I'm wrong). The desserts were what saved the day at this place. The two sticky rice dishes were incredible. If you come here they are a must. Overall, the garden outside is beautiful and it is a great atmosphere, but I don't see myself returning for anything but the sticky rice."}
{"text":"Delicious food and beautiful garden.
Wait staff was great. We left full but it didn't feel heavy on our stomach. All the sauces were light. Ingredients tasted very fresh. We will frequent there often."}
{"text":"Loved the outdoors and what great breaded chicken strip apps!
The food was ALL AUTHENTIC so order anything on the menu and you will be very happy"}
{"text":"Went here for a friends birthday. A little pricier than I would have liked but the food was nice. I tried the garden roll, thai iced tea and ordered the green curry for my meal. The thai iced tea was a little lighter than I had expected, but still tasty. The garden roll was a nice healthy option for an appetizer, but overpriced for what it was. The green curry was delicious and you can make your main course as spicy as you would like (rating from 1-10). 

The ambience outside was beautiful with pretty lights. Great for group pictures. 

If you a looking for a nice Thai meal in Pittsburgh, I recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"In sum, this place is your typical Thai Food place in Pittsburgh. I would say where it does beat its competition is location, location, location. It appears this place is still a \"hidden restaurant\". It is so far up Butler, I think most people do not even know this place exists. When I came here on a Friday night there was still plenty of room to fill and no wait list! Yay!

I ordered the coconut soup w/ shrimp. It was good, the broth was simple yet rich.  It lacked some lemongrass but it was good. Quite honestly that was my favorite dish of the evening. For my entree, I ordered the ever so traditional Shrimp Pad Thai. Which again was your typically Pad Thai. Sadly, nothing blew my mind away, I would not necessarily tell everyone I know to eat here. Then again, I won't say it is bad either. It is by and far superior than its competitors in Bloomfield so this place has that going for them. 

I would say if this restaurant had a bit more expedient wait staff, and dropped their prices a bit, I would feel more compelled to return. I wanted to love this place but I am more indifferent with it. I may give it a second chance in the future merely due to the fact of its proximity to my home and the lack of bustle. Perhaps I caught them on an off night."}
{"text":"Entering the restaurant through the main door, you're left extremely underwhelmed by the atmosphere. Plain walls, no decorations, really nothing special. What this place makes up for in subpar inner space, they make up for in the outside which is like an absolute fairy tale garden with plants everywhere, and a big tree whose vines climb a very large arbor which spans across most of the setting. 

Eating outside was a very pleasant and enjoyable experience. There were 10 of us, and the staff was extremely attentive. We had reservations at 5:30 and the tables were ready at 5:20. Once we ordered food, it only took about 10 min to get everything for so many people. Only complaint with pricing was the BYOB fee, which is $1 per head, unlike the sister restaurant Noodlehead, which is a base fee of $1 or less. 


Now, comparing the food to its sister restaurant Noodlehead, I believe the dishes were very similar. Atmosphere was completely different. Noodlehead is much like a more Americanized Thai dining, whereas this was more realistic. 

Food was excellent. Everyone who ordered was happy with their meal and had no complaints. I ordered the Kao Soi, which was a noddle dish with a curry base. The curry spice levels range from 2-10, so I ordered a 2. For someone who can't deal with spiciness, this was a perfectly doable decision. The meal portions were average, especially for what you pay for. None of us had any leftovers, which says a lot coming from 10 small girls. They definitely get you with little extra add-ons unfortunately. But overall, this is a great date spot or celebratory get-together."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in Pittsburgh... especially in the Spring and Summer!  The \"Garden\" is always so welcoming and lush. I always like to start with the amazing garden rolls, crispy crab rolls or the curry puffs.  For a main entree try the Pinapple Curry with Chicken or the Kee Mao. Always make a reservation and be patient with the servers.  It is so worth it!  BYOB is sweet too! My only complaint is that they close from November through mid-February."}
{"text":"Every single person working was incredibly friendly! The food was amazing! The service was super fast. The atmosphere is gorgeous. It's very clean. I got the woon sen and it was absolutely incredible. Also, I am a total baby and ordered a 2/10 for spiciness, but I tried the 7/10 my friend got and that was really good too. This place rules. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"A wonderful hidden gem that is great for social gatherings with family and friends. A great selection of zesty Thai dishes. Be sure to make reservations in advance, and it is BYOB. I had one star removed for not being provided with adequate seating even though reservations were made weeks prior. After expressing our dissatisfaction, they gave us more chairs for our table."}
{"text":"Went out for our anniversary tonight at Pusadees Garden after hearing great things about it. We loved the outdoor patio, it was really nice, however, the customer service was atrocious. The waiter forgot to put in our order, and didn't remember for an hour after we ordered. We didn't get our food for an hour and a half after we got there. Then we were charged double for one of our entrees and never received an apology for either one. The patio is reason enough to go back."}
{"text":"My favorite thai restaurant! SO DELICIOUS!

Street noodle number one is my favorite dish of the menu. I feel like this would be a place to experience real home-cooked Thai dishes, instead of the mass produced dishes most Thai places put out. I like that this place is basically a hole in the wall restaurant. The focus is on the food, not on the frills and decor."}
{"text":"If you're looking for an outdoor dining experience, try this place!
You step out back and you'd never know you were in the city. It's a garden atmosphere, but still hip. And it's roomy outside. 
I walked through the indoor dining area, which didn't seem as big, but it's probably more readily available, since people seem to flock to the outside dining area. We made reservations, which is probably a good idea.
The food was great, lots of great flavors (i love spicy!) 
I wish it was open all day long, it would nice for a relaxing lunch.
Such a great outdoor dining experience -- worth trying!"}
{"text":"Pusadees Garden is easily some of the best Thai food in Pittsburgh, and hands down one of the best places for outdoor seating.

The beautiful outdoor patio is covered in a canopy of ivy and delicate lights, each table lit with a candle. While the inside seating is beautiful and swank, nothing beats the elegance of their deck. It's perfect for sharing a bottle of wine (its BYOB) and trying their traditional, but inventive dishes.

The Curry is outstanding - particularly the Pumpkin Curry. I got it with tofu at a spiciness of 6, which wasn't all that spicy, but delicious nonetheless. My sister got the Tom Kah soup (her favorite Thai dish), which she claimed was the best she had ever had. We also tried the Curry Puffs, which were sweet and delicious, and the Fried Tofu, which was absolutely wonderful - much better than your standard Fried Tofu appetizer. Theirs wasn't over-fried and came with a delicious, delicate sauce. My boyfriend got the Khao Soi, another traditional Thai dish, and it was wonderful as well. Extremely flavorful with fresh toppings like cilantro and lime.

The deserts are interesting as well - they have many homemade ice creams and also traditional Thai dishes like the Mango Sticky Rice."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and I love the garden.  I wish they had heaters so the garden could be used longer."}
{"text":"Arrived after a hot summer day. The inside is very clean and minimalist in design. The garden is something else. Globe lanterns hang from a grape-vine lattice, illuminating the lush and verdant gentle oasis. It makes for a very romantic dinner.   For our starters we had Tom Yum spicy-sour-lemongrass soup (divine!) as well as the garden salad with fresh veg from the raised beds near our table.  The waiter recommended (at our request) the specialty dishes.  We selected the Woon Sen egg noodles and Eggplant Basil.  The food was exquisite, authentic, and really set this restaurant apart from other Thai establishments. Even our dessert, black sticky rice with custard, tasted delicate and distinguished.  The service was excellent.

We highly recommend the Thai iced tea, but be warned it may not pair well with your entree."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite Thai restaurant, however over the past 5 years and most recently I have been disappointed. I am unsure if it is because the restaurant is getting busier and not capable of managing? Or if there is some other reason. 

Mostly the service has declined, and there have been several occasions where my take out order has not been correct; completely wrong dish or zero flavor and spices. I really enjoy the food, but the prices have gone up and the portion size has become significantly smaller. I will continue to visit occasionally, but I have started exploring other Thai restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Gorgeous outside patio in the back. Perfect date spot. Bring a bottle of wine and be prepared to have (arguably) the best Pad Thai in Pittsburgh. The Green Curry was outstanding as well. Went on a Friday night and most people had reservations so plan ahead!"}
{"text":"What a magical garden dining experience!! We had a fantastic dinner with really tasty food and prior professional service. The kids particularly loved the appetizers--the pork meatballs and dumplings! All of the curries and phad Thai were yummy as well!"}
{"text":"What a hidden gem (but too good not to post about!).  I was at Pusadee's Garden this weekend and we thankfully missed all the rain...We made last minute reservations which paid off. We got a terrific table in the garden under the grapevine canopy.
My handsome date and I shared the Garden Roll and a Thai Iced Tea while perusing our menu.  I decided on the Eggplant Basil while my date had the Spicy Seafood.  We both went with 6-7 on the Spicy Meter (our server admitted he didn't \"do\" spicy and always got a 3 but we stayed with our higher numbers).  Our entrees were wonderful and the heat was just right.  Keep in mind we both had runny noses and extra sips of water from time to time but the food was very enjoyable.  We ended the meal with Sticky Rice and Mango-yum!
What a romantic place that makes Pittsburgh great.  Nothing overly fancy -beautiful atmosphere and great food.

By the way, the reviewer who waited an hour after reservations were made, had horrible, rude service and bad food had to have had some other issues ruining his evening.  My experience at Pusadee's Garden was NOTHING like that.  Avoid that review:)"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food at a reasonable price. I love the street noodle 1 and 2. The food is great and i love the spices they caution it is very hot and give you a choice 1-10 ive had up to 7 and for most that would be real hot i look forward to trying level 10. If you dont like hit food stick to 4 or below. 

Nice outside area and friendly staff. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Best Thai food around. The inside is nothing to write home about but the outside is incredible. The atmosphere out back makes you feel like you aren't in Pittsburgh.

Reservations are usually necessary but worth it. Food is great. And BYOB is a fantastic deal."}
{"text":"This restaurant was wonderful. The atmosphere was beautiful (I would recommend eating outdoors as the inside of the restaurant seemed a bit unsanitary with rags thrown around on the floors) with plants and flowers everywhere. I had the tofu pad thai and it was the best I've ever had despite having had a lot of different tofu pad thai's in my life. It was one of those meals that I never wanted to end."}
{"text":"Love it! Best Thai food in the city combined with friendly wait staff and incredibly reasonable cost. Menu is limited but wonderfully authentic. The Street Noodles are near perfect and I truly love the Masaman Curry. But it's the kind of place you should visit often and explore the varied menu. The place is BYOB, which isn't a bad thing since it keeps your tab down and encourages sharing. Goes without saying: ask for the patio."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Good portion size on the entrees but the apps are really small. Everything was top notch for flavor and the service was excellent. The outdoor seating area is charming and beautiful."}
{"text":"Well-shaded garden with BYOB. Our friends are regulars there and introduced us to a beautiful oasis in Pittsburgh. Sadly, all our food (level 4) were ridiculously hot on that particular day."}
{"text":"Delicious, authentic Thai.  This place rivals the best.  The Kao Soi is incredible, as is their pumpkin curry and the curry puff appetizer.  The restaurant is cozy and also has a gorgeous outdoor garden dining area.  Service is great and they are BYOB too!  This is hands down my #1 favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant! The atmosphere was beautiful and the service was great. Byob which is excellent because it makes it even more affordable. Minus the cost of 2 bottles of wine, our bill for 4 people with 3 appetizers was only $76. We had pad Thai, beef kee mao, pineapple curry, and street noodle 1. All excellent. All at a level 3 hotness. I can vouch for the spicy wusses out there... 3 was just fine for me as I generally do not do well with spice. I normally don't like to sweat through my shirt at dinner and 3 was perfect! Reisling was recommended to go with the food. It was a good pairing. As was the cabernet we brought. 

Will definitely return."}
{"text":"I am picky about Thai food and this was delicious. Service was nice and friendly. Clean atmosphere. My only complaint was no yellow curry. The rating is well
Deserved and accurate"}
{"text":"Pusadee's is a little more expensive for what you get, but in my opinion worth it, especially if you're eating in their outdoor garden in the summer. It's beautiful, and you'll see the cook walk out of the kitchen, pick some basil, then walk back in to cook your food. I've also been there with a huge group and their servers took great care of us."}
{"text":"The food is really good but the ambiance is what makes it. Try to sit outside in the garden- it's gorgeous and serene. I love going here in the summer. Plus, it's BYOB and a great deal for the price."}
{"text":"Delicious Thai food! The noodle dishes are great but my favorites are the red and green curries! The best part about this place is the outdoor patio- a plant covered canopy with beautiful white lights. It's the perfect place to enjoy good food and good company. It gets pretty busy so I recommend making a reservation. Byob $1 per person."}
{"text":"We had reservations tonight on the patio. A lovely place. Unfortunately it rained. When we arrived the place was in its usual chaos and they did not have us placed at a table but clearly had our name on the reservation list.  Since the inside space is very mediocre, we looked outside despite the drizzle, but were told all the covered  tables were reserved. We agreed to be seated inside but were then informed that we only had an hour because someone had reservations. We also had a reservation which seemed to be overlooked. And it appeared we were paying the price of not being on the table template. So we could not sit inside and could only be outside if we sat in the rain. We left the restaurant. Not sure what kind of customer service this is, but not for me. I will not return. Nor will I recommend this restaurant. Is this a case of too big for your pants. There are many really good restaurants in Pittsburgh that are not always asking how quickly you can eat your meal."}
{"text":"Have always really liked Pusadee's, but ironically, had never dined in the garden until this week.  Wow -- it is magical.  You really are transported. The food is great and very reasonable.  Love the musaman curry and pad thai.  Service is good and friendly.  BYOB is a plus."}
{"text":"My wife and I went on a 65 degree day.  We brought a growler from Roundabout Brewery, for which they did not charge us corkage.  The food was very reasonably priced and it was delicious.  My wife, who does not typically eat Asian, had the garlic chicken.  I had the green curry with chicken.  I would have given the place a 4 if we had sat inside, but the outdoor seating was unbeatable.  I will definitely go again when the weather cooperates."}
{"text":"The food is amazing.  Portions huge.  Not one thing that I have tried has been crappy.  They get super crowded during peak hours, and they don't do reservations.  During the summer months they have great outdoor seating and ambiance.  Recommend!"}
{"text":"Visiting from NYC, I found yet another excellent Pittsburgh eating establishment!  The food here is top rate, and the ambiance and service is great as well.  The outside dining area looked awesome but it was a bit chilly when we went there the other night, so we ate inside.  The place seems to be in a somewhat remote area of the city, yet it was hopping, with many young people.  OK, to cut to the chase . . . I had the spicy basil with shrimp dish; it was EXCELLENT.  So was the pumpkin curry and THai fried chicken.  The appetizers were also quite good, especially the grilled pork meatballs & steamed garden rolls.  The fried spring rolls were ok and the curry puffs were quite good but not quite on par with the (somewhat spicier) ones I've had in NYC.  Still no complaints at all, and I will definitely come here again sometime to try more.  Unfortunately, they apparently close for the winter! :("}
{"text":"If you are only interested in good Thai food, then go to Thai Cuisine instead.  If you are on a budget, dont go here either since they are much more expensive than all other asian restaurants in the area.  But if you want the most calming, beautiful surroundings at which to dine in Pittsburgh, come here on a beautiful evening and eat in the garden.  Lots of interesting plants to check out and so many that you feel you have left the city for the Thai countryside.  A truly relaxing experience, so much so that the okay food and the high bill wont even raise your blood pressure."}
{"text":"Food was great. Some of the best Pad Thai I've had in Pittsburgh. The street noodle #2 was also great if you like seafood. Pork dumplings were alright. Cannot go wrong with the Pineapple curry. What really sets this restaurant apart is the ambiance. Very cute outdoor courtyard with strings of lights entwined in hanging vines. Staff is great too. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Well prepared but watered down Thai food.  Potential is huge, but food has been \"Americanized\".  Sad, because authentic thai food is full of flavors dancing in your taste buds."}
{"text":"the best thai food i've ever had! consistently!  

yes, also the most expensive, but an standard dish is still just around 12$ and i just love the staff.  always a lovely experience."}
{"text":"Singapore street noodles w/ chicken and shrimp curry-good bottle of wine from home
. All you need to know.
    Lovely service as well.... we were inside, and hardly pined for sitting out on the crowded,but lushly green, garden patio.
     The chicken on the street noodles was perfect; crunchy, light, moist.  Shrimp curry sauce very flavorful. 
Oh, pork meatballs skewered with sugar cane- great way start and share, along with the spring rolls and satay."}
{"text":"As good as it gets! Pusadees never fails to impress me. I get pad thai at every thai place so I can compare and this place is hands down the best. Great food, great environment, great service and staff.  

After my awful experience at Nicky's I sought refuge at Pusadees and they couldn't have been niced and more accomadating even though it was 9:30 and they were on the verge of closing.  Despite probably wanting to go home the waiter was uber nice and friendly and always kept the smile on his face. 

I would give this place 5/5 before the incident with Nickys but now I want to give it 7/5 stars!"}
{"text":"The service is AWFUL! the sloppy waiter made us wait for over an hour even though we had a reservation, and not only that, but he got other people who did NOT have a reservation seated before us!! he was walking back and forth to collect dishes and ignore us and not even apologize... 
after we eventually got seated, nobody came to take our order for another half an hour... the food was not the best either.. everything arrived only luke-warm.. 
the worst dining experience ever, all the waiter and waitresses are ignorant and slow slow slooow.. not going back...
AVOID THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed my birthday dinner here this year outside in the patio area!..  The family loved it and it was a nice cozy way to enjoy spending the evening together mixed with great food, all in all a wonderful way to celebrate."}
{"text":"Okay so I definitely came here high af with no idea what to expect. The building looks very small but inside it is fancy as all hell like I didn't know I was supposed to dress up to eat here but I should've. It's byob with a bottling fee of course but you can get turnt as you want at an acceptable level which let me tell you, you definitely want to do. Now they're going to tell you that the spicy level is higher than normal restaurants and if you're white and order anything above a 4 they are going to be so shocked but seriously go for like a 6 because it honestly could have been hotter. The street noodles were literally like an orgasm in my mouth I'm pretty sure I did not talk the entire dinner because I was so damn focused on eating the noodles man. hit this place up for sure and make sure you are hungry af because you can probably eat like two plates and still be in love with the food here"}
{"text":"I have searched for a long time to find a Thai place as good at here. This place does not disappoint. Their shrimp tempura was delicious. Highly recommend. We did make a reservation which I would recommend as it is packed on a Saturday. Ought. The servers was very attentive. We sat outside in the garden and it was beautiful on a nice night. I had the eggplant basil dish with chicken and I loved it. It's hard to find good Thai food. We have had many others but this is one of the best in the city."}
{"text":"I should have written this a week ago, but maybe I wanted to treasure this secret! The atmosphere and food are second to none. This was a wonderful Friday evening with our young daughters. BYOB and very affordable. Loved the comfy outdoor seating with soft lighting. This place deserves all the praise people have given."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I decided to try this place because of the positive reviews on this website and others. We were pleasantly surprised with how good it actually was. 

As we walked towards the front, it looked closed on first glance because it was completely empty. The reason the interior was so empty because we choose the first beautiful day in PGH to visit and the outside seating is this restaurants REAL dining area.I am looking forward to returning to this outdoor dining experience when all the foliage is grown in and a bit later in the evening to get the real ambiance of this Pittsburgh jewel. The negative of the outdoor seating is the location. The patio is RIGHT next to Butler St. which made it a bit noisy when large trucks or loud motorcycles would pass.  We were seated immediately and given glasses of water.  

The service was average, nothing great, no problems either though. Nothing really to comment on.

The food, however, was the star of the evening. I ordered the Thai Yellow Rice. The chicken was crispy and cooked perfectly. The rice had great flavor, and I had the option of spice level, and choose the medium one, which was not very hot. My girlfriend had the pad thai which was delicious, simple, and not heavy with spices and marinades. 

The prices are super reasonable and we will definitely frequent this place in Law-ville from now on. If you are a fan of Asian foods and would like a great place to eat, this is a MUST go.

One side note, this place is BYOB and they mean it. People around us brought bottles of wine and beer. The menu said there is charge of $1 for a glass. I do not know if they would charge to drink out of a beer bottle or can."}
{"text":"Making it a point to try a different restaurant each week I decided to come here. I ordered the garden salad with ginger dressing and the crab fried rice. The salad was okay as I really didn't taste much, but it might have been due to this medicine I took earlier for my injured hand. The crab fried rice on the other hand was very good and hit the spot. I also ordered the custard served over black sticky rice for dessert which was exquisite and scrumptious. 

My only criticism was one of the servers stopping to place used dishes on my table so she could reestablish herself. It was an honest mistake and understandable in that she wanted to ensure she had all the dishes secured as she was bringing them back to the kitchen. Yet in an effort to stress good practices and ensure an unadulterated dining experience for patrons, I'd just encourage staff to stress these points and for servers to think and plan ahead when carrying dishes. This is meant as constructive.

I liked the location as it was in a quiet area. The main dining area did seem a little cramped and the set-up was a little unconventional as the hosting area looked to be in the back. As a result, I walked through the dining room to get the host's attention. 

In any case, the detractions I've mentioned are not major and didn't overshadow the otherwise pleasant dining experience and tasty meal I had."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Pittsburgh, period. Everything, from the setting to the food and the service, is amazing. The food is more authentically Thai than other places, who have adapted their recipes more to a Pittsburgher palate. I come here often, and the food is consistently well-executed. My favorite is their green curry, where you can taste the Thai basil, white pepper and Kaffir lime. It is the best green curry I ve had outside of Asia."}
{"text":"You know what this place is really gosh darn good! We came here with 6 people around 7 pm on a Friday. The food we had was outstanding all the way across the board 5 stars. For appetizers we order pork dumplings that were tasty little bites The fresh Spring rolls \"Garden Rolls\" only had one roll per order so we order 2 more for a total of 3 because they were so fresh and vibrant tasty rolls with a wrap that has a very neat texture. Also had an app. of Chicken Satay which actually came in the middle of the meal, which was fine by us because we had order way too much much food to begin with, never the less I choked one of the chicken hunks down after I smothered it in that delicious peanut sauce.

We all ordered something and passed it around the table. The most notable dish for me which I did not order was the crispy tilapia. The crispy tilipia is covered in this sauce which tasted very good even with the higher level of spice that was in it. And it is BYOB, I love BYOB at this place because it is like $1 / person. So for all six of us to stuff our faces with awesome food the total bill was only about $125. I would say that is a heck of a good deal. I was happy to experience this before they close for vacation until Feb 14th 2012! Ouch... Definitely on my top 5 list. Oh and I'm not much of desert eater, but I really enjoyed the black sticky rice and coconut ice cream."}
{"text":"Amazing food! My wife and I split garden rolls for an appetizer. Good start!!! I had street noodles #2 and really enjoyed it. My wife had the pad tai. We both shared our food and they offered to bring plates out. We brought our own bottle of red wine. Unfortunately we dud not have room for desert, but the choices sounded great. We both walked out with full bellies and two little to-go boxes. We're definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Pittsburgh's best Thai food by a long shot. Perfect if you love spicy food. Beautiful and shady outdoor tables where they grow their own herbs for the food. Do not miss the kao soi noodles."}
{"text":"The food was really good. The scenery was amazing. The service was faster than the bat mobile. Overall a great atmosphere. 

Plus it's BYOB so you can get hammered for a $1 corkage fee. God Bless Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, fantastic presentation, friendly service, and an outstanding patio for dining makes this my favorite Thai restaurant in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"BRINGING THE GOOD TIMES DOWN BUTLER STREET! THE REAL STAR IS THE PATIO IN SUMMER!

Hi My Loves!

I'm in love with Lawrenceville right now! Not enough to move my sweet ass down there like some yuppies I know! But I'm happy to explore and spend my dollars down there. I get a sense a real community is being created.

Wondering away from LOLA (Lower Larryville) and farther up Butler Street I found this little gem with such a fabulous patio - how can you not stop there. Seriously, it's a gardeners dream. A beautiful canopy of vining plants and flowers actually creates a cool shaded patio perfect for dining al fresco!

I went on a really hot day with friends and the patio was actually really comfortable. Thai Iced Tea is a delicious (albeit calorie rich) non alcoholic drink to cool down with.

In a move that is totally unlike me I tried fried tilapia with a spicy thai sauce. On a hot day nonetheless! I dunno I just had a good feeling it would be tasty and I was right!

Servings here are huge - in my opinion! 

I would go back on a nice day to sit out on the beautiful patio!

Love you!
Muah"}
{"text":"The food is great. I had the tilapia. On Sunday the service was slow due to only two servers, but well worth the wait.  But that is why I gave it 4 stars not 5."}
{"text":"I'm basing my reviews on the two trips I've been here. The first trip, we sat on the patio which is the main draw and ordered the shrimp pad Thai, level 5. There was zero spice but ate it. 
Fast forward to my second trip here. We arrived around 5:00 on a Sunday. We didn't have a reservation, the hostess said we had to be done by 7:00 because of a reservation they had coming in. Pretty sure 2 hours would be plenty of time and she didn't really need to say anything to begin with. I ordered the shrimp pad Thai, this time, they remembered the spice. I was disappointed by the number of shrimp that was in my dish, only 3 shrimp for $14, hardly worth it. I still had 2-3 bites of food left on my plate when the waitress came and just took my plate, assuming I was done. 
I liked this place the first time because of the patio, but being rushed (we were in an out in under 40 minutes) the second time, leaves a bad taste in my mouth"}
{"text":"Outdoor seating ambiance was super cute and could be romantic on a date. The Thai iced tea is delicious. The Garden Salad was also delicious. The pad Thai was nothing special though and very bland. I asked for 0 spice level though, but even without spice, other places have a more flavorful pad Thai. I also didn't feel that the staff was super friendly or personable."}
{"text":"Delicious and habit forming.  We went there once for dinner,  and it was so good that since then I've made several runs from Shadyside just for takeout.  This place is awesome and we haven't even eaten in the garden yet! Service is great too."}
{"text":"This charming Thai restaurant has lovely atmosphere and delicious food. 

For vegetarians, the trick with Thai food is that traditionally most of it is made with shrimp paste, fish paste, fish stock, etc. as the base flavor for the sauces and broths. While many of the items appear to be vegetarian, they are frequently not and you are left to the mercy of the servers, hoping they have the correct information about their food or that they are willing to tell you the truth about what is in the dish. Depending on how the recipe is made, some cannot be altered because of how the food or sauce is prepared ahead of time. During my visit to Pusadee's Garden I felt assured that our server was knowledgeable about the items on the menu and how they are made. She easily pointed out which ones were within those limits and it seemed that our group wasn't the first asking those questions.

The last time I visited was in the summer when the garden was still open. I ate with friends next to their organic garden where they grow some of their vegetables that they serve. It was relaxing and very pretty. The meal I ordered--a noodle dish--was delicious as was the salad that came before. My friends all reported the same--that their food was really on the mark."}
{"text":"I've has the best Thai food ever here. The green curry with shrimp was amazing. The atmosphere is nice with good quick service. My friend had the pumpkin curry and she said it was unique but soo good."}
{"text":"Delicious. You get a lot of food for the price and the atmosphere is truly spectacular and unique, especially in Pittsburgh. It is byob so make sure to bring a drink!"}
{"text":"Manager / host is scatterbrained - so be patient (there was a 15 minute wait to see a menu) - there was a long wait to place our order, and we skipped appetizers not because we didn't want them, but because we weren't confident that we would get our entrees before bedtime.

The food was excellent, though!"}
{"text":"They are open til 10 on a Sunday. Huge plus! The street noodles are so yumm. The garden is beautiful. Go here. Get the the \"thai cole slaw\" it was surprisingly awesome. good for dates! byob by the way."}
{"text":"LOVE this place for delicious Thai dishes and its outdoor garden patio (so wonderful for a summertime date night with a shady arbor and twinkling lights!). I went last night 8/04/2013 - I made a reservation for 8:45 (just in case ... it does get really busy here, and the seating is limited) and was seated promptly with my date in the garden. We had the Garden Roll and Fried Pork Dumplings for a starter. The Garden Roll (in a tapioca wrapper) was very fresh and full of basil and mint flavor. The Fried Pork Dumplings were exquisite with a zippy sesame dipping sauce - so crispy and savory. I had the Spicy Basil Rice with Beef, which packed some subtle heat (I ordered a 6) - just enough to give an extra kick to the flavor. If I were feeling more adventurous I would probably get an 8 or 9.  The meat was very tender and perfectly seasoned - the veggies were still crisp and zesty. My date's Red Chicken Curry was perfectly presented and very yummy. Lots of lovely color in every dish. Portions are generous, but we cleaned our plates. Would love to go back and save room for dessert! 
Service was prompt, very friendly, and not overly intrusive. Frequent water fill-ups :). 
It's best to make reservations and go on a temperate night to make the most of the outdoor seating. Only complaint is that the metal chairs could use some cushions for comfort, especially if you want to linger over your meal. 
At around $12 - 15 for an entree, this place is a great value!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for 20 years and I love this place. The outdoor garden is spectacular. BYOB is a plus plus plus. I have never had a bad meal here."}
{"text":"Good food, but nothing too distinctive from other restaurants of its kind here in Pittsburgh.  I ordered the Street Noodle # 1 and it was good.  Nothing special.  I would definitely come back again, and I would definitely try something else. The other dishes I saw patrons eating around me looked very good though, so maybe I shouldn't have gotten something so generic.  The BYOB deal here is amazing by the way.  It was a dollar a person.

As already been mentioned before in just about every user review, the outdoor seating at this place is beautiful.  Lush greenery, colored umbrellas, and a lowly lit patio that has a dreamy type ambiance to it, the patio alone is reason enough to check Pusadee's Garden out.   One of the best outdoor seating areas I've been to in this city."}
{"text":"I visited again, and was under impressed by the food. I had good memories, but the flavors came across as bland. (Beware spices: by spicy they mean spicy. That's a plus in my book)"}
{"text":"The food was good, but I don't like their rule that only lets you split the check 2 ways. Unattractive for groups."}
{"text":"One word: YUM. Awesome Thai food with honest spice levels. The outdoor seating is among a mini garden; it's beautiful. BYOB with a fee. I'd go back again."}
{"text":"good stuff,
the pork? meatballs were really good, skewered on sugarcane, better.
byob
beautiful garden
reasonable pricing"}
{"text":"yeah i ate here the other night, in a tweed blazer and cable knit sweater.  everything was really good.  spring rolls were good, but the sauce was better - i drank the rest of it after i was done dipping. the main course, yellow w/roti; was yelpilicious as well -  it said it came with sweet potatoes but they were really small (though plenty of them - just not like i was expecting) and they actually tasted great but had more of a regular potato taste (if covered with yellow curry sauce).  Either way some great Thai and a nice little set- up, wish it was a bit earlier in the season - as the garden looks impressive."}
{"text":"Amazing Thai food. The staff is super friendly and accommodating. The Tom yum soup is delicious."}
{"text":"wonderful outdoor atmosphere, beautiful gardens and delicious food.  very gluten free friendly.  a definite must in the summertime.   it's hard to believe you are in the city.  we never ate anything on the menue that  we didn't love."}
{"text":"The food was spectacular and the ambiance was just as delightful. The wait staff was very courteous ad made awesome recommendations. We elected to order Thai fresh spring rolls, pan tai, and yellow curry with Roti.. Great food, not to mention the fabulous desserts with sticky rice and coconut ice cream.. Definitely a must stop when in Pittsburgh area.."}
{"text":"Where do I even begin ? My fiancé introduced me to pusadees when we first started dating and I couldn't believe how amazing this place was. Atmosphere, street noodle 1 spice level 4 is something I now get 2-3 times a week . It's safe to say that I could eat t everyday. No matter what you order it's made fresh and is delicious ! Love this little gem"}
{"text":"Great little Thai place. Had the spicy seafood dish which was actually spicy enough for this Texas gal. Green curry with tofu had a slight kick also, very tasty. The coleslaw served as a wonderful appetizer for 3 of us. Dessert was coconut ice cream garnished with jackfruit. The only drawback was that we ordered a pot of hot tea for the three of us to share and we were brought a pot of hot water and one store bough tea bag. Other than that, it was a wonderful dining experience."}
{"text":"An amazing garden, good food, and BYOB should make this one of the best Thai restaurants in Pittsburgh. And one of the best patio restaurants in Pittsburgh. The waitstaff really take an axe to one's enjoyment of the meal, however, as it takes forever to order and be served. Weird, seeing as how little time it takes to prepare Thai food."}
{"text":"Everyone says it but it bears repeating:
The back garden/patio is utopia.  It's gorgeous. It's romantic. It's fresh.  

The food here is just incredible.  The fresh spring rolls are better than any I have ever tasted. The pad thai is the perfect amount of spice and savory.  Sometimes I dream about eating in their patio in the summertime as sun is setting.  The wind will blow through my hair, I will be laughing as the waiter uncorks my BYOB wine and pours us another glass.  I digress...I must also recommend the kao soi it's delicious.  Theres pickled greens in there and curry.  It will melt your mind into amazingness."}
{"text":"We've been waiting a long time to try this place, and happily, we finally did so last night.  For starters, we tried the Thai cole slaw, mango salad and fried tofu.  All were delicious, and I'm not always a fan of mango.

I had the crispy tilapia, which was great, but practically room temperature; we decided to give the restaurant the benefit of the doubt, and surmised that it wasn't supposed to be piping hot.  In any case, flavorful, crispy, spicy-- heaven!  Our vegetarian friend was very happy with her rice curry with tofu, which we all tasted and loved.  The third entree, bean thread noodles with vegetables, was also a winner.

The garden really is lovely, green and lush, a nice setting for a relaxed meal with friends.

If I were to compare it with Nicky's Thai Kitchen, I would say that Pusadee's food is better, by far.  Also, although Nicky's garden has a nice Thai/pan-Asian decor, it is cramped.  Pusadee's garden is roomier and airier.  Overall, a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love Pusadee's Garden, especially hearing how it's often compared to the famous Nicky's Thai Kitchen (in North Side and downtown). Unfortunately, Pusadee's did not really do it for me. 

Even in the winter time, the outdoor area is lit beautifully. There was only one other table of diners other than us on the Sunday night of our visit, making it incredibly quiet. The restaurant was very dimly lit, almost too dark actually. 

The menu was rather small. I didn't see my favorite soup, Tom Kha, on the menu which was a little disappointing. In place of my usual soup order, we ordered the Garden Rolls. The hubby ordered Pad Thai with chicken and I ordered the See Yew with tofu. The Garden Rolls didn't seem all too fresh as the outer rice paper wrapper was a bit hard. The rolls were loaded with veggies, which I could taste mostly of spring lettuce mix. I kind of felt that to be a rip off and you also only get one roll (cut in half to give you two pieces) for $3. The Pad Thai was ok. The hubby liked that it had a slice of lime for garnish which he hasn't seen many other places do. However, it lacked the smoky flavor he has gotten from Pad Thai at other restaurants. The See Yew was quite disappointing. The flavoring was good, strong of soy sauce flavor, but I did not like the noodles. I've usually had See Yew with really wide, chewy rice noodles. These noodles were not as wide, making the texture different from See Yew at other restaurants. Our food came out very quickly, but my See Yew was not heated through. I'm not sure what shortcut they took or how long it sat prior to getting to our table, but the temperature made it that much more undesirable. 

I'm not going to give up on Pusadee's just yet, as I'd like to try the curries. A trip in the summertime to experience the garden is definitely in the plans."}
{"text":"If Pusadee's Garden repeats or improves upon my experience this evening, it may get bumped to a 5. The girlfriend and I had a long week and planned a much-needed date night. We'd heard good things about Pusadee's and drove past it's attractive patio several times, so we decided tonight we'd give it a try. We were pleased that the garden roll ($3) and cabbage salad (\"thai cole slaw\" w/a spicy tamarind-peanut sauce; $6) were gluten-free, so we were able to share those as appetizers. The garden roll was most definitely THE BEST I've had in Pittsburgh and maybe ever. Perhaps the ingredients were particularly fresh today or maybe they are this awesome everyday, but I will definitely be back, and soon, to find out. (Do note, however, that the menu says garden roll, and they mean roll, singular.)

The cabbage salad was delicious with the perfect blend of sweet and spice. For our entrees, I went with the veg & tofu pumpkin curry (kabocha squash, zucchini, carrots & basil; $12) with the \"brown\" rice. The curry was spectacular (though I dock a point for not including \"green bell peppers\" among the ingredients listed on the menu because I hate them and had to pick them out because I didn't think to request that they be excluded since, you know, it wasn't listed as an ingredient)--the squash was deliciously sweet, the tofu was a perfect texture and quite tasty (!!!), and there was a nice blend of veggies. The \"brown\" rice was actually a hearty blend of brown and red rice (my favorite) for which I didn't mind too much paying the $1.50 \"upcharge.\" GFgf had the kao soi (egg noodles, shallots, pickled mustard greens, yellow curry sauce; $11.50) with vegetables and tofu, substituting rice noodles for the egg to make it GF. I was too busy swooning over my own dinner that I forgot to try hers, but I got the impression she was quite pleased with her choice as well. We both agreed that it was the best Thai food we'd had in Pittsburgh (and we really like Thai food). 

The service was pleasant and reasonably attentive, if a bit jumbled at first. It seemed that only one young man was attending to the entire interior dining room, which reached near capacity just shortly after we arrived. Unfortunately, that also resulted in the noise level spiking to unpleasantly high levels, no thanks to all the hard surfaces in a small enclosed space. We're very hopeful that the weather will be more pleasant the next time we come so that we might enjoy the beautiful patio area. 

It won't be long before we're back!"}
{"text":"Cute and delicious, even though everyone seems to have a problem with the inside room. Simplistic setting isn't bad! Prices reasonable."}
{"text":"Great Thai food with an amazing outdoor area.  The only issue is that the service can be a little slow, but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"After discovering Nikki's Thai up on the North Shore, we were beginning to think that we were tapped out on finding more good Thai food in Pittsburgh (a shout out to Smiling Banana Leaf and Green Mango). And then we found Pusadee's Garden, and are happy to add it to the list.

They have a great garden in the back, and the food is very good. As other reviewers have mentioned, the service is on the slow side, but if you are not in a hurry, it's worth the wait. We had the pad see ew (very good... some of the better tofu I've had in a while) and a veggie pumpkin curry, which was also delicious. Everyone enjoyed their order.

The variety is not as great as you might expect, but what they do, they seem to do well."}
{"text":"This was a recommendation from a person at a store in \"the strip\", as one of the top 3 restaurants in Pittsburgh.

Fantastic garden seating and excellent food. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Pusadee's Garden is right down the street from me and definitely a staple. Not only does it have some of the best Thai food in Pittsburgh, but it's outside seating is absolutely beautiful on a nice summer day. In the evening hours, everything is lit up and the ambience cannot be matched anywhere else in Pittsburgh.

The service is great but can get a little bogged down on busy nights. The food is flavorful but conventional Thai fair. Their most interesting deviation is their street noodle dishes, which I don't see on too many Thai menus in Pittsburgh.

Their heat scale is hit or miss. I've had a 10 here and while I perspired profusely, I felt like I was still not experiencing the dish as it would have been served in its home country.

While Pusadee's Garden did replace the only Filipino restaurant in Pittsburgh (to me and my girlfriend's chagrin) it replaced it with a formidable Thai component in the slightly over-saturated Thai food market of Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Amazing place to get thai!  Everything is reasonable price and you get great quality food. BYOB saves you a ton. Sit outside in the summer you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I have to say the out door seating is amazing. It was he perfect temp to sit outside the evening we went and we got a table in the last sunlight if the evening. The garden was just beautiful. The service was great and the food even better. The prices where great and the sizes where what normal people eat. Not bloated plates of food at all. Just the right amount with an app to start. I always enjoy Thai food and this is he place is a great place for some. I will just say what I got. The roasted duck and noodles where really good. Also I asked for spicy and it was just right. A good meal and a really nice day."}
{"text":"Wonderful Thai and regional foods. The garden seating is wonderful but don't be discouraged if there's only indoor seating available - it's lovely inside too.

Highly recommend the grilled pork meatballs served on the sugar cane skewers. I'm not sure which is my favorite part, the deliciously seasoned meatballs or gnawing on the pork infused skewers."}
{"text":"Not that great.  Pad Thai was dry and everything else was just okay. Not great.  Nicky's is way better."}
{"text":"I have yet to find a Thai restaurant in Pittsburgh in which I really love both the curry and the noodles. I have been to Pusadee's Garden twice. The first time, my boyfriend and I shared the red curry and the Pad See Ew, and the second time, I went with a friend and had the Pad Kee Mao. I didn't like the noodles. Both noodle dishes were too sweet for me. My boyfriend agreed about the Pad See Ew. 

The reason that I am giving Pusadee's Garden 4 stars is because we both really loved the garden seating and the curry. The red curry was creamy and thick and only could have been improved by more spiciness (our fault - we overestimated the spiciness and ordered a 2 or 3). I will be back anytime I am craving curry (which is often!)"}
{"text":"Everything is delicious here! Get the pork dumplings and chicken satay for an appetizer!"}
{"text":"(4 stars not 5 because I've only been here once and therefore can't vouch for everything on the menu.)

Came here for date night and the food. After reading reviews on other Thai places in Pittsburgh, I chose Pusadee's because it seemed the most suitable for a relaxing dinner after work with my boyfriend and for good thai food. We sat outside on the patio, which was really nice. Even though it looks like a small space, we didn't feel crowded in with the tables next to us. The wait staff was quick and attentive, but not overly attentive like at other restaurants where I'm often caught mid-bite into a spoonful of my meal when they decide to check in on my table and ask if I need anything. 

Onto the food. I ordered the pumpkin curry with tofu and a thai iced tea. It was delicious! The thai iced tea was well prepared - it wasn't too sweet or overbearing like I've had at some other places. The curry had ample chunks of squash and firm tofu, and warmed me up when the temp dropped outside after the sun had set. One thing the restaurant could do to make the outdoor seating more bearable in late spring / early summer / late summer is add patio heating for the evenings when temps can still drop into the 60s or lower. Other than that, it was a pleasant treat to be seated outside!

All in all, I'd go to Pusadee's again. While the food didn't blow me away, it didn't disappoint either. I think it's a great option for thai food and a nice overall meal-out experience in Pittsburgh. (Western PA isn't exactly the prime geographic area for Asian food in the world anyways.)"}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is ridic amazing. So amazing that you fall into a trance and don't realize that it's taken you 20 minutes to order. Then you glance the extensive herb garden planted in the back and are filled with locavore bliss as you imagine the chef using those very plants in your meal and then hey, has it seriously been 20 more minutes and no appetizers and no water refills???

The garden spring rolls are beautifully made but the portions are a little small as compared to other restaurants. The yellow curry with roti is another great dish. 

I will keep going back because it is close, beautiful and kind of good. But every time it will be slow and it will make me sad inside."}
{"text":"Great food. A little skeevy on appetizer sizes. But tasty nonetheless. Good variety of meals too. Multiple noodle dishes. Buncha curries. Got the pumpkin curry. Was skeptical. Ended up being bomb.com
Not too sweet. Not too starchy. Well done. 
BYOB. Only 2 party max per check. The coconut icecream was great. Awesome outdoor patio (garden). Chill vibe. Kinda packed. But it is a restaurant. Namaste."}
{"text":"Another nice little neighborhood place (similar to Smiling Banana Leaf in Highland Park) with reasonable prices and authentic food.  They also usually have a few non-traditional dishes for those that want to try something new. On street parking, but usually no problem finding a spot near by."}
{"text":"This place is so delicious! Street noodle number one is my absolute favorite. I no longer live in Pittsburgh anymore, but this restaurant is by far the best Thai food I've ever had"}
{"text":"Sit outside in the garden if you can! Pittsburgh may not be the most friendly in the winter, but make sure to make a visit to Pusadee's on a warmer day to immerse yourself in the ambient garden -- it's very cute and peaceful. I would recommend making a reservation in advance, especially on days with nicer weather.

I loved my eggplant basil entree from the garden specialities, and I had a few bites of my friend's Street Noodle #2 and it was also very well cooked. We also shared a chicken satay, which came with a cucumber dip that tasted amazing.

{"text":"After reading previous reviews, we decided to check this out. I've never felt more uncomfortable in a restaurant in my life. The hours clearly state they are open until 10pm, yet by 8:30 they started turning up lights, sweeping the floor next to us while we ate, trying to signal is to leave. How ignorant ... We put up with your over priced, poor quality, greasy, generic food so we could bring our own bottle of wine and relax in peace. We even tipped 18% and then you show us your appreciation by basically pushing us out the door. Never again ... We won't be back!"}
{"text":"I will be back. The Thai food was great! I'm a huge fan of red curry and theirs was amazing. Lunch there was affordable and quick. 

The shade provided by the vines above the outdoor courtyard was perfect on a warm day. Furthermore, the vines and plant life above and surrounding the courtyard created a warm ambiance and a feel as if you were truly in a garden. 

This is my new go-to place in Lawrenceville and the city."}
{"text":"I hadn't been in a very long time, so I had to re-visit this old fav Thai restaruant.  The first time I had Thai food was at Bankok Balcony and this restaraunt was before that one because it is the mother of the lady that made Bankok Balcony possible.  Our server was patient, efficient and pleasant.  All of the dishes were good from our appetizers to our main courses.  The only thing that was a minus was that the appetizers were pretty tiny.  We shared two of them and they were gone so quickly.  I kind of wish that they would make them a little bit bigger.  That is my only gripe.  The atmosphere is nice.  It is a small space, but it feels comfortable.  The food and the service are what stand out and that is the most important pieces.  I will certainly be back again."}
{"text":"This is a perfect little Thai restaurant located in Upper Lawrenceville. Went here with a group of six for dinner, and we had a wonderful time. Even though we had only reserved seating for five, they were quickly able to rearrange the seats for us to accommodate our extra person. The atmosphere was lovely - you walk into the front door of the place through an archway of vines and exotic plants. Inside, the restaurant is soothing and refined - very much like stepping into a Buddhist meditation room. We sat at the back of the room with a window looking out into a gorgeous, magical little garden and outdoor patio. I wish it had been warm enough to eat outside!

Ok, on to the food. I ordered an appetizer of crispy crab rolls and a main dish of basil chicken. It was a little simplistic for me (I like trying exotic foods) but the seasonal menu was geared toward fall flavors like pumpkin and butternut squash, which I'm not really into, so I went for something tried and true. 

The appetizers are all small, which is not how I'm used to seeing them. Typically in American restaurants you get one appetizer for the table, but here we all ordered our own. I soon realized it was because each plate simply had two small pieces on it. It was actually perfect, because I didn't feel like a glutton ordering my own finger-width rolls and couples could easily share an appetizer plate and get sort of an amuse-bouche before their meal. The appetizers I did find to be a bit pricey for the amount you get, but then, I was ordering seafood so I chose the most expensive one on the menu. My main dish was affordable though, so it made up for the pricey starter.

The basil chicken dish was absolutely perfect. The waiter made a big deal about ordering based on spice level, and said three was considered their \"medium\" level. I like spicy dishes, so I went with that and was inordinately pleased with the pleasant kick that paired well with the sweetness of the basil without overpowering it. Another person at my table likes very very spicy food and found a level six to be too low to make his ribs truly spicy, so keep that in mind when ordering yourself. The basil dish had bell peppers, zucchini, and onions sauteed together with chicken, along with a small side plate of rice. The portions were just right and I was able to finish my dish without lugging leftovers home. 

For twenty dollars I felt like I got a great, authentic Thai meal in an intimate, pleasant restaurant. By the way, they don't serve alcohol, but they do allow you to bring your own drinks and have a one dollar per glass fee, which I think is a good deal."}
{"text":"I've only been here once, but I will definitely return! The pumpkin curry was delicious. The outdoor garden is where most of the seating is, so plan to come when the weather is nice. It's an oasis in the city! Highly recommend making reservations! Also, BYOB"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Thai restaurants in Pittsburgh.  The decor is understated and elegant and the food is sublime.  I rarely make it out of the appetizers, though since they have some good ones.  One of my favorite things on the menu is the spicy Thai cole slaw.  I've tried to find a recipe for this so I can make it at home but nothing compares.
There is plenty for a vegetarian to eat here.  The food is tasty and I like the service as well.  (Although the last time we went, it was pretty crowded (folks waiting for tables) so you might want to make a reservation).
The dishes are all prepared with care and the spice level can be adjusted to your liking.
They also have black sticky rice with Thai custard, a traditional dessert not found in many restaurants (here in Pittsburgh, Thai Cuisine has it as well).
Highly recommended!
They do have outdoor seating, weather permitting but I've not yet dined outside.  I think it is also BYOB since I saw many couples with wine or beer in tow."}
{"text":"We were in the area and needed a new restaurant experience in our lives. Pusadee's Garden did not disappoint. We had no reservation and with a party of five, it can be a little difficult to get garden space. I highly recommend reservations. We sat inside and had chicken wings and spring roll to start. Service is quick, professional and extremely helpful. Food is gourmet. Pad Thai with Chicken, Urban noodles 1 and 2 as well as coconut soup. Many heat levels to experiment with. Showed our friends that live in Pittsburgh a new restaurant to try again with reservations because the gardens are not to be missed."}
{"text":"The last time I made reservation here I was told we would have to leave our table within one hour because of next reservation. I said no problem. I was reminded of that also at our arrival. I felt like they were trying to get rid of us even before we started. The setting would be so lovely, being outside in a garden. It's hard to get trough your meal without being attacked by flies from all over. 
With previous experience with scale of spice 1-10, I would recommend to stick with lower numbers. My boyfriend asked for #7 and I have no idea how he was able to eat it. He was in tears but he eat it. 
The food is good but since my last experience I don't really have the desire to return."}
{"text":"Pusadee's Garden is such a beautiful place on Butler Street.  It's a must-see restaurant on a gorgeous evening.  There are string lights and the you really feel like you're in the middle of a garden.  It's amazing the owners were able to set this place up in an area that feels so incredibly industrial.  You're completely hidden away from all of that while enjoying outdoor seating.

The food was delicious.  I appreciated that the waiter asked each individual for their desired spice preference.  I ordered the Pad Thai with chicken (at a 0 spice level because I'm a baby!) and I thought it was the best I've tasted in Pittsburgh.  We were a large group and they accommodated us nicely.  I didn't hear complaints from anyone and it seemed pretty calm in the restaurant for such a busy evening. I also didn't feel like we were being kicked out even though we most certainly overstayed our welcome.  It's BYOB so we brought our own drinks as well.

You can easily turn this into a dressy occasion because the atmosphere is so nice, but you could also go in a T Shirt if you wanted.

The only issue came when we tried to figure out the bill at the end of the night.  Perhaps we should have requested in the beginning for individual checks but the waiter informed us it was impossible to split the check and they would only accept a maximum of two credit cards.  I think that would have been nice to know ahead of ordering, and it frustrated us as a group.  I think if they updated this system, then I would give them 5 stars because it felt very outdated."}
{"text":"The staff here is always friendly and quick to take your order. The food also comes out rather fast which is always appreciated in my book. I got the street noodle number one last time I went (3 on the spice level because I'm a wimp) and really enjoyed it. My friends got a four and five (they like spice) and felt it was the perfect amount for them. 

It's also BYOB- they were able to provide a cork opener and wine glasses. 

Also, side note for the summer, the patio is absolutely beautiful when it's nice out and lite up with lights."}
{"text":"After a day of unsuccessful apartment searching, I was randomly craving Thai food.  I found this place on Yelp and decided to give it a shot even though it was a bit out of my way coming from downtown.  I can truly say that I was glad that I made the trip up to Lawrenceville because this place is legit.

First of all, service is friendly, prompt yet not overbearing.  The ambiance is quiet, chill, perhaps even romantic.  Would be a great date place.  

The menu selection is very extensive for a Thai restaurant and the prices are very reasonable.  I had the Tofu Spinach soup as an appetizer and the  Eggplant Basil \"Garden Special\" for the entree.  Both dishes were simply outstanding.  I felt that the chef did a great job balancing the amount of sauce and veggies in the Eggplant dish.  Just enough sauce to adequately coat the rice, but not too much as to overwhelm you.  I left satisfied and certain that I will try this place with friends when I move to to the burgh."}
{"text":"We have been coming here since it first opened and there was no such thing as a reservation. Always nice and love the environment. Tastes home made and I have never been let down. Have tried a multitude of items on the menu and my favorites are the Pad Thai , Beef Salad , Spring Rolls and Thai Iced Tea. If you aren't very adventurous those are my favorite and safest to eat!:)"}
{"text":"If dining al fresco is your thing, think \"Pusadees.\"  If enjoying the best Thai food in Pittsburgh is your thing, think \"Nicky's Thai.\"  That's not to say Pusadee's doesn't have its charms.  It's in my neighborhood, bonus; the patio puts to shame any patio in town, double bonus; and the service is good.  I just wish the food excelled a bit more.  But if you're in the neighborhood, give it a whirl!"}
{"text":"Decent food. Service was not as good as would have hoped. Only stopped by every 30 minutes. Weird payment policy. Would only allow us to split a check 2 ways with a card.  It's 2016 get real."}
{"text":"This was a cute little Thai place I would definitely go to again. Food quality was as good as any I've had at other Thai places in Pittsburgh, but this feels a bit more off the beaten path. Very small inside."}
{"text":"I am not a Thai food expert by far.  But Pusadee's Garden was able to accommodate us with a reservation for their outside patio when a friend and I decided to go last minute.  So already, that's a plus.  We did show up a bit before our reservation time, but didn't have to wait long.  The outdoor area has a great ambiance and is actually well hidden from the busy street.  Inside seemed a little cramped.

We had a small table for two.  Service was a bit slow but I'm willing to forgive because I think they just squeezed us in.  We first ordered spring rolls and crispy tofu appetizers.  I don't know that I've ever really had a bad spring roll.  But that tofu with that peanut sauce is in a class by itself.  I never thought I'd eat and like tofu!

While waiting for our main dishes, I ordered (and got my friend hooked on) the Thai iced tea.  Mine was almost gone by the time my Street Noodles #1 order arrived (rice noodles, bean sprouts, bok choy and Thai fried chicken).  The dish was very flavorful and that chicken was nice and crunchy.  I was not disappointed and can't wait to go back.  

The overall experience was one I won't forget.  And next time I'll remember it's BYOB."}
{"text":"If for no other reason, even if not for dinner, stop by here and have a bottle of wine and some appetizers and enjoy the absolutely stunning patio.  

My dad and I still cant figure out how they keep the outside looking so gorgeous, but it is seriously a beautiful hidden gem in Pittsburgh...a must see.  Bobby and I met my dad on a Sunday night for dinner because Daddio wouldn't stop raving about the place.

I ordered the Thai iced tea - I wasn't sure what to expect, but I am a huge fan of an iced chai tea latte and it reminded me a lot of that!  Very good, but I wouldn't normally just order it to drink as my meal.  We all split the Thai fried chicken and it was very good - tender, moist and perfectly fried served with good sweet and spicy dipping sauce.  Bobby got the street noodles 2 at a level 7 and thoroughly enjoyed it - even though he was sweating bullets through the entire meal!!!!  Dad ordered the pumpkin curry at a level 4 and I don't think his craving ever leaves him for it!  I tried the spicy seafood dish.  I ordered it at a 4, but probably could've handled it better at a 3 (I'm a wuss, I know).  Our server was super nice and informative and the place was actually pretty busy for a Sunday evening.  The perfect night for it too!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love Thai and so we traveled to Pusadees Garden for our wedding anniversary.  It was on a weekend, around lunch time. The outside garden is beautiful, but it was August, so we opted to sit in the cooler inside. It was not busy but yet, but after we were seated, we waited about 20 min for our drink orders to be taken. We ordered the shrimp tom khan soup and Thai fried chicken as appetizers. The soup was more of a broth with a few slivers of mushroom... though the shrimp was very well done. I guess I expected something with more substance, maybe more veggies. The Thai fried chicken we found was dry. For entrees I ordered tofu pad Thai and hubby ordered chicken see yew. The pad thai's tofu was not fried, so that left noodles and tofu with no texture. The sauce was sort of a generic pad Thai sauce, without the complexity of the sweet, sour etc. The see yew was equally disappointing. The sauce again, not very flavorful and reminiscent of more of a basic Chinese brown sauce. Maybe for those that think ambience supersedes the food, Pusadees is a great place..but it was not for us. Next time we will just go to our fav Thai place, Thai Cuisine in Bloomfield."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try Pusadee's Garden for a while, since I'm such a fan of Noodlehead. I ended up coming here with my family and significant other for my birthday dinner this past weekend. We made reservations for our group easily, and our table was ready when we arrived. When we walked in, I immediately noticed the lovely pale-colored walls with simple black light fixtures and vibrant green plants placed throughout the room. It was more high-end looking than most Thai places in the city, contributing to a nice atmosphere overall. We were given a few minutes to look over the menu before placing our orders. We went with a variety of noodle dishes as well as a few appetizers for my youngest sister, who has never tried Thai food before and was unsure of what to expect. I myself had Street Noodle #1, simply because I was curious to compare it to Noodlehead's version. It was delicious, although significantly less spicy than I am used to. 

That brings me to one of the three instances of miscommunication we experienced that keep me from awarding this place 5 stars. The spice levels were not clearly explained when ordering, so those of us who wanted spicier food were left wanting in that department. For instance, the first person to order selected Pad Thai and was told the spice levels were 1-5. She made her choice and then myself and one other person ordered Street Noodle #1 using the 1-5 system. The next person ordered Street Noodle #2 and was told the spice levels were 1-10 for that dish. I can only assume my significantly less spicy noodles were due to me ordering a 3 out of 10 rather than the 3 out of 5 that I had intended. I only wish the spice levels were more consistent or better explained, so everyone could have been on the same page. In the future I'll know what to do. The next issue was when my mother requested a few more bean sprouts for her Pad Thai, since it was getting spicy for her at one point. She had been given extra bean sprouts to cool down hot Pad Thai in other restaurants, but was told she could not have bean sprouts in no uncertain terms at this one! I don't know if her request was misunderstood perhaps, but I did feel bad that she had to eat food that wasn't as palatable as it could have been. She's not one to make a fuss, so she smiled and carried on. The last thing was that our handwritten check was missing a couple items, and after the server took my mother's card to pay for the meal they had to return with a check that was $20 higher for her to recalculate everything. She didn't seem to mind, but I would have liked to see a little more attention to detail on that end. 

Any one of the above things on its own wouldn't be enough for me to dock a star, since everyone at Pusadee's Garden was unbelievably kind, professional, and efficient. The food was flavorful, if a bit mild at times, and everyone in our group came away satisfied. The atmosphere is top-notch and would be a fun date night spot. I will be returning here often, especially once the warm weather hits, and will update this review accordingly if my next few visits go more smoothly."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place has such good reviews. Outdoor patio is really pretty, the inside is pretty stark and bare. 

Went here for dinner on a Monday night patio was pretty full. Asked the hostess for a table for two, she looked kind of annoyed when I said I didn't have a reservation. Ordered the garden roll appetizer which consisted of one fresh roll and was pretty bland. Veggie tempura app which was a couple thin slices of fried veggies. I ordered the spicy basil rice dish with mixed veggies a spice level of 6. It wasn't spicy at all and my rice was complete mush, I got a lot of vegetables though which was nice. My dad got chicken pad Thai which was pretty bland and the noodles were over cooked. 

Again not sure why this place has so many good reviews let alone why anyone would go out of their way to call and make a reservation. There are a ton of other really great Thai restaurants in the city."}
{"text":"A friend recommend Pusadee's Garden at a recent Yelp gathering.  I've heard nothing but positive things, so I went tonight to try it out.  The restaurant lived up to their excellent reputation.  Our Spring Rolls were marvelous, with lots of Thai Basil and fresh Ginger.  I had the Yellow Curry, which was delicious and my son had the Pad Thai, also great.  The garden is an absolutely charming place to eat, very cool and shady, even on a warm day.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"On-point delicious thai food in a no-frills setting, with a beautifully romantic & quaint backyard seating area, deep in Lawrenceville. Family-owned and operated in a small location, so reservations recommended. BYOB - great for parties, date-night!
Both street noodles are always good & highly recommend the grilled pork meatballs, wrapped around sugar cane (don't forget to chew on the sugar cane!). 
Their pad thai is authentic and among the best in the city (I find many Thai places have ho-hum pad thai and generally avoid it on menus, but not Pusadees!)"}
{"text":"We were visiting from Memphis and I love Thai food! I had already visited Nicky's downtown. I wanted to try another place. We didn't get to sit outside, which seemed nice, but it started raining right when we got there. The wait staff was a bit flustered when it started raining and people started coming inside as we walked in to be seated. They sat us, but it took a long time to even get water. They made sure that the others who came in were well taken care of. The pad Thai had no real taste and I asked for a 7 spice level and it seemed to be a 4. My guy's spicy basil chicken dish was tasty, but again the spice level was low. The appetizer spicy thai chicken was pretty good. 
Nicky's is still my fav!"}
{"text":"We absolutely love Pusadee's!! It is tied with Nicky's Thai Kitchen as our favorite Thai restaurant in Pittsburgh. It breaks our hearts when they close for the winter, but we know that come spring we will be enjoying their delicious food once again! 

We have eaten in and done takeout here many times, so this review is much overdue.  Takeout service is always quick and efficient. We are usually enjoying our meals within 30 minutes after calling and picking up (compare this to Thai Place in Aspinwall, which always gave us a 45 minute wait due to being \"busy\" but never had anyone eating in the restaurant when we arrived...). 

The indoor space is sparse but functional. There are simple tables and chairs, and not much decorations on the walls. Their outdoor space is gorgeous and generally what people go for when eating here. The garden is lovely and relaxing, with lights strung up around the beams and simple plants making the space inviting and relaxing. We attempted to eat outside yesterday, but gave way to the heat and ended up indoors. Someday soon we will enjoy our bottle of wine in the garden!

We typically order two different dishes and share. We start out with the fresh garden rolls, which are delicious. It is a small order, but the perfect start to a meal. The vinegar sauce is light and refreshing, but I do prefer the peanut sauce that Nicky's offers with their spring rolls. We have had the red, green, and pumpkin curries, and our favorite is the green. The sauce is more complex than the pumpkin, even though we love the pumpkin chunks! There are numerous fresh vegetables in each that soak up the wonderful sauce. We also share an order of brown rice, which is worth the extra cost. I recently had Thai in NYC, and I have to say that I loved the curry at Pusadee's much better! Their blend of spices and coconut milk is simply perfect. 

Pusadee's and Nicky's will continue to be our favorite Thai places here! I am so glad that Pittsburgh has more and more options for great Thai dining."}
{"text":"Went here with a party of 5. 

I got the spicy tilapia -- the sauce was somewhat spicy and very flavorful. It would be better if they served the sauce over a more compelling fish (like maybe a whole fried snapper or something), but still very good.

The garden roll was fresh and tasty and included a variety of greens and herbs.

Stolen bites of the spicy duck and street noodle dishes were also quite good.

Service was friendly, prompt and helpful.

I'll definitely be back here."}
{"text":"Food: 3.5
Decor: 5
Ambiance: 5
Service: 5
Value: 5

The purpose of going is for the garden seating. However, the food is very, very good. And it's a BYOB."}
{"text":"Pusadee's is transcendent. Especially in the fair weather. There's something so transporting about sitting in their garden with twinkly lights, and all the different plants  and jungle ceiling that takes me out of Pittsburgh to somewhere tropical? The food I think is up in the best caliber of thai food that you can get in the burg (and there is a lot of good thai food competition here so that's a big thing). 

Pumpkin curry. go get it. All of the appetizers= amazing. Everything under the chef's specialities = super yum.

Basically I'd like to eat here all the time. It's great for a special occasion or a date, or just grabbing some excellent food on a weeknight. I'm a big fan and look forward to my next meal here."}
{"text":"Nice place.  Outdoor al fresco garden transports you out of context and into its neat world.  Staff, friendly.  Food..... food is good/okay.  I was expecting more unique and less traditional Americanized Chinese/ Japanese/ Thai.  That said, it's still tasty and the atmosphere more than makes up for it."}
{"text":"My boyfriend's brother was in town from Colorado and suggested coming here for lunch on a Saturday afternoon.. I was thrilled! I've heard so many amazing things about this place and surprisingly, it was a Thai restaurant in the burgh that I haven't been to! 

It was a gorgeous day, so we sat on their outdoor patio. The patio is awesome and definitely made me forget that the restaurant is located directly on a very busy street. Our waiter was awesome and was very friendly. I ordered the veggie fried spring rolls as an appetizer and we also ordered the pork meatballs on sugar skewers. For $4, I was disappointed that the spring roll appetizer only came with 2 small rolls. They were good, but not worth $2 each for how small and average they were. The pork meatball order came with 4 and they were delicious. 

My boyfriend ordered chicken fried rice, I ordered tofu pad Thai and my boyfriends brother ordered ginger chicken. I tried them all. The fried rice was nothing special, but good none the less. I really enjoyed my pad Thai, although the tofu was not prepared in the way that I had hoped. It was undercooked and mushy. The ginger chicken was awesome and packed with flavor- my favorite out of all the meals by far. 

I am disappointed to give this place 3 stars, maybe I didn't order the right meal- I would love to go back and give them another shot! They are BYOB and I wouldn't mind kicking back on their outdoor patio again :)."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to check this place out since I found myself back in Pittsburgh about a year and a half ago.  There was always a reason that popped up that stopped me from going.  And I wanted to go when the actual garden was open! 

I'm happy to say that I finally made it to Pusadee's Garden this past Tuesday! Everyone was right...the garden was just beautiful.  Hard to believe that I was sitting so close to the traffic on Butler Street. The temperature was perfect.  Like a little oasis in the middle of a pretty urban neighborhood.

We decided to get starters.  I had some vegetable tempura (with squash and sweet potato) and my beloved had the pork meatballs.  Both were excellent!

For my main course, I had the especially yummy pumpkin curry with shrimp.  My beloved had shrimp fried rice.  He kept stealing the sauce from my curry because it was just that good.  Perfect amount of heat and really delicious.  You could tell that the shrimp in my dish was fresh.  

So I feel very happy with my visit to Pusadee's Garden.  It was well worth the wait.  We talked to the owner for a little while after our dinner.  Found out that she has been at this location for nearly 10 years.  This makes this place extra cool.  A place with excellent food with owners that had the pioneer spirit in Lawrenceville.  They deserve all the success that they have today.  Can't wait for the next time I get a chance to get to have the best Thai in Pittsburgh!   Don't miss it!"}
{"text":"I heard about this Thai place with the magical garden patio, so I went. This is a place that's best to visit in the summer.

I called ahead and asked for outdoor seating. The inside is very tiny. The outside has a large overgrown patio of flowers, trees and lights like a tropical patio in Thailand.

I walked up to a beautiful overgrown lanai with wooden shelters and comfortable patio seating. It was magical inside the garden and surprisingly there were NO BUGS! it was packed so call ahead.

I tried the garlic seafood which was good. They ask you what level of hot you want. My waiter was nice and attentive.

All in all the experience of sitting outside on this beautiful Lanai was worth at least one trip. I would like to go back again sometime and try other food."}
{"text":"This place is definitely more of a hidden gem. Since it's located in north Lawrenceville not many college students make it to this place. 

While there I shared the Spicy Basil Leaf, Chicken and Street Noodle #2. The basil Chicken was definitely the stronger choice, since it packed a lot of flavor and contained a lot of nice veggies like zucchini. The Street Noodle #2 was pretty satisfying but nothing too special. It also reminded me a little too much of ramen.

While the food was high quality, the part that makes this place a must-go is the garden. Make sure you eat outside in the garden. It's absolutely amazing what a little place they have carved out of Butler Street, especially considering next door is an abandoned lot.
 
Long story short: good food, really unique/beautiful atmosphere."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite Thai restaurant in Pittsburgh. All of the usual Thai dishes and I have never been disappointed. However the outdoor garden seating is the best part for sure, perfect in the summer"}
{"text":"The foos is very good. My wife ordered the street noodles #1 and I had chicken pad Thai. Both were very good. Good amount of flavor. Would have preferred more than 4 pork dumplings but that is nitpicking. Would advise to place a reservation instead of walking in."}
{"text":"Celebrated my wife's b'day here with a few friends on a Saturday evening.

Between the 4 of us we had: 
i. crispy spring rolls (chicken & veg) - 3.5 / 5 (ask for extra sauce its really good)
ii. street noodle #1 - 3 / 5 (do not recommend)
iii. spicy duck  - 4 / 5
iv. massaman - 4 / 5
v. thai Ice tea - 5 / 5

They do have a 1 - 10 (non-western) spice scale and IMO anything above a 7 will not do justice to classic thai flavors. 

If there was one thing that could have been better that would have been the service (took us 20 min to get our mains), but with an ambiance like this that was barely noticeable. 

All in all PG is probably the best alfresco dining scene in the city & reservations are highly recommended."}
{"text":"i appreciate when a place can deliver great decor along with affordable prices. case in point - the food here is priced similar to other pgh thai restaurants, but pusadee's has a great sophisticated yet casual feel.

the menu was a bit standard, but featured a few dishes not seen on other thai menus. we tried 2 different curries, a street-noodle dish, and something else i can't remember....

service was great, and the portions on the larger side - large enough to consider sharing dishes among your table (depending on how hungry you are of course...)."}
{"text":"Been here when I first moved to Pittsburgh and haven't been back since. The last time I went, it was summer and we sat outside in the beautiful patio that they have. That was the highlight of the visit - the food was very mediocre and forgettable. Fast forward two years and we decided to give this place another try. We sat inside this time. We walked in the door on a Sunday night - the place was about 60% full, but we were completely ignored by the one server who was running around the dining room, and the woman at the back who was more interested in taking calls for takeout orders. We stood at the front for a good 2 minutes, then we decided to walk to the back to try and get someone's attention. We were still ignored. Minutes later, we were finally seated, without any kind of greeting - very rushed. We almost walked out. 

We ordered Tom yum vegetable soup, spareribs with rice, and eggplant with basil and chicken. The soup was extremely disappointing, while the mains were decent but nothing I couldn't make myself at home. All very mediocre as I remember it. Options are very limited in the menu. Portions could be more generous for the price, and the actual gravy that came with the dishes we ordered was non existent. We are both spicy eaters and ordered spice level 10, but it was practically spice level 1 or 2. Coming from That region and having travelled to Thailand a lot, we know Thai food. This place is so mediocre, and it really didn't help that the service was awful. I really believe the only reason they're still surviving is because of their beautiful garden. Will definitely not be back by choice. Very unauthentic Thai food."}
{"text":"Pusadee's Garden is among my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh. The outdoor dining is so beautiful and serene, especially considering its in the heart of Lawrenceville! My favorite dish is Street Noodle #1. The chicken on the dish is breaded and fried giving it a flavorful crispy outside and a tender inside and it's loaded with sprouts and bok choy. I also LOVE the crispy tofu. It's delicious and goes great with the sweet chili dipping sauce they provide with it! and you seriously can't visit this place without trying their Thai ice tea!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice to eat and once for take out. The first time was about a year or so ago.  We ate outside, which was absolutely lovely. I forget what I ordered, but I know it was amazing because I couldn't wait to come back.

The second time I came for takeout. I ordered the Pad See Ew, which again, was declicious. 

The most recent time was this past weekend. We called to make sure there wouldn't be much of a wait, as it was pretty chilly and we wanted an inside table. We were told to come right in. Once we arrived, the line was nearly out the door. Not a huge deal, except we were standing and intermingled between diners who were trying to enjoy their meal. Often we were bumping into them to make way for the wait staff delivering food and beverage.  We weren't looking forward to our inside seat anymore.

Once we got seated, however, it seemed to calm down and we didn't have a crowd of people waiting in line. I ordered the mushroom salad - I was excited to try some new mushrooms I had never heard of.  The waiter warned that it was spicy. Yes, it felt like my entire face was on fire. I had to pack it to go and started thinking of ways to still use it with other foods at home, sans fire face.

My meal was the panang curry with shrimp. It was an amazing party in my mouth. I actually ate it with a spoon so I could get every drop of the smooth, creamy curry sauce. I ordered it a spicy 3/4 but it did feel a little spicier, though it could have been residual fire from the mushroom salad.  All-in-all, my curry was perfect with zucchini, carrots, peppers, broccoli, and shrimp.  I look forward to eating much more of this.

Incidentally, I brought the mushroom salad home, wash it off, and threw it in a zucchini dish I made. The next day I heated it up, laid on sliced avocado, and put poached eggs on top. It was one of the best breakfasts I've ever had. I'll most definitely get the mushroom salad to go next time I visit and make something fun and delicious with it."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant with ordinary indoor looking but great outdoor environment. They have more tables in the backyard than indoor! You've got to choose the level of spiciness when ordering and I recommend 6 for those who want to taste spicy Thai food but are not very capable of eating extremely spicy dish. Service was good too and I am definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"My favorite place for Thai food! Definitely go in the summer so you can sit outside. The outside area is absolutely gorgeous, and really adds to the superb dining experience. I have eaten here mulitple times  and have been impressed with the quality of food - it tastes great, and always has great flavor. I definitely recommend this place to anyone and everyone!"}
{"text":"First off, let me say I'm a huge fan of Thai food (and love spice).  There are a handful of good Thai restaurants in the Pittsburgh area, and this is definitely amongst them.  It's a little jewel tucked into Lawrenceville, and despite my being in Pittsburgh for many years I hadn't tried it until this past year.

The outdoor seating patio during warm weather times is wonderful.  I've eaten here several times now, and I literally lose myself there sometimes--on warm summer nights it feels like you're eating dinner in a quiet South Beach restaurant instead of Pittsburgh.  That being said, I should mention that the indoor seating on the other hand is a little cramped.

So...food...yes.  Have gotten the Thai Red Curry, Thai Green Curry and Panang Curry--I know, I know, so cliche.  But they were great--not necessarily anything better than any other good Thai restaurant, but undoubtedly tasty (I mean, I've only ordered standard dishes, so what else can I expect except for standard food?  But they were all well made dishes).  It did tick me off the one time I ordered Thai-Iced tea without too much ice, and the server gave me a half-full glass of tea.  Umm, I make this stuff at home, so I know it doesn't cost anywhere near $2.95 a glass.  So when I ask for a little less ice, please don't insult me by giving me less drink, too. 

Anyway, when I'm in the mood for Thai, the reason I pick this Thai restaurant over the others is specifically for the ambience of their outdoor seating patio.  The food is good, and the pricing is average.  Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Get the yellow curry with roti. You'll never be disappointed. But really everything is great here. We've been four times and have not been disappointed. Just ate with a party of six; everyone got something different and every single person raved about how good it was. Can't complain that it's walking distance to our house!  
Make a reservation...especially on Friday/Saturday."}
{"text":"Welp, as someone that has spent some time in Thailand, I definitely feel like a qualified reviewer of this restaurant.  This is just one of many fine little gems hidden in the mostly unexplored neighborhood of Lawrenceville in Pittsburgh.

So, the restaurant from a looks perspective.  It's situated along the 53rd block of Butler street in a mostly low-key area of the street situated on the left side (looking toward the higher streets).  In other words, there's not a ton of business development within immediate proximity.  The inside area has your typical hole-in-the-wall vibe going with it.  It's mostly white walls and very simple inside, with maybe ten or so tables lining the entrance corridor and back room.  It has a zen/minimalist style going on, but nothing really special.  Step into the side deck garden, however, and your environment transforms into a fresh, exotic, green, and lush sanctuary with 8 or so tables strewn underneath a canopy of vines.  The environment that engrosses the tables is made from exotic plants and flowers of some indiscernible origin.  Gents, if you need a first or second date recommendation, or need to bring your lady to a nice place for the anniversary, don't pass up the outdoor eating area here.  The ambiance will impress the shit out of her.

The food.  Pretty good.  Went here with a date and we got the fresh spring roll apps, the coconut soup, and the spicy basil with vegetable and the pumpkin curry with vegetable, followed by sweet coconut sticky rice with fresh mango and coconut ice cream.  The apps were 3.5/5, they were good but very simple and came with a sweet chili dipping sauce from what I can recall.  The coconut soup was unfortunately, not that special.  I'd give it a 2.5/5 as I was generally left wanting and didn't actually end up finishing this.  The entrees were both stellar, I'd give them a 4.25-4.5/5.  I had asked for a 10/10 on the heat scale on my dish (pumpkin curry) and got what more resembled a 6 or a 7.  I got \"white spiced\" apparently.  Either that or they are not calibrated to the same heat scale that I subscribe to.  The dessert was very authentic and tasty (though the rice was a bit soggy for my liking), I'd still give it a 4.25/5 for flavor and refreshment value.

Overall impression.  Very cool little BYOB hole-in-the-wall Thai place that uses fresh-from-the-garden ingredients.  Definitely in the running food-quality wise with Nicky's in North Side and Thai Cuisine in Bloomfield.  Their food is definitely well above-average and the ambiance in the garden can't be topped.  All in all, for the fair prices they charge (and again, it's BYOB!), you can't miss this place!"}
{"text":"Finally made it! Even though it was in February and we couldn't enjoy the ousted garden, it was still worth the trip!
What a great little place! Right in the heart of  Lawrenceville, this place served some of the best Thai food I've had yet! I had the pad Thai with medium heat and my wife had the street noodles # 1, both were spectacular! My dish had peanuts and sprouts and fresh flat noodles with the perfect amount of heat and flavor. My wife's dish was amazing, the tempura on the chicken was so light and crispy I could have had that as my main dish. The noodles and the broth were delicious with so much flavor. I want to try everything in. The menu, which is the perfect size, it has enough to choose from but not too many items to overwhelm you.
I will be back this spring with a bottle of wine, or even better a growler from Arsenal cider which is just a few blocks away, and sit out in the garden and enjoy a great Thai lunch and a great mid-day buzz!!"}
{"text":"Went in on a cool Wednesday night. Couldn't ask for a better place to enjoy Thai food and the last of summer. The garden was beautiful and the ambience very relaxing. 

We ordered fried chicken and Thai spring rolls for starters. The fried chicken was tasty, crispy on the outside and well flavored inside. I'd never had any Thai spring rolls before. The herb (basil? I think) was too strong for me. 

I had very spicy kee mao for entree. Boy they did not hold back on the chili pepper oil! It was SPICY! I had my nose running and eyes watering (so if you were on a date, I'd suggest not asking for too spicy) . And for a spicy food lover, it was AWESOME!!Most of the time when a restaurant marks their dishes spicy, they usually end up \"meh\" for me...

Service was very slow though, maybe due to a lot of people there. We were kicked out immediately after paying the check because another party was waiting for the table already lol hot place!"}
{"text":"The food at Pusadee's Garden is always great! They never really disappoint. One of the better Thai restaurants in Pittsburgh. Their vegetable spring rolls are perfect, crispy & not greasy. Absolutely love the Tom Kar soup. It's creamy coconut soup with vegetables. Any of their noodle dishes are delicious. 
Their outdoor patio is probably the best outdoor seating place in Pittsburgh. Except when I saw a large frog/toad hopping around the patio last time I ate there. I'm sorry not my thing...especially around where I'm eating. 
If you're a fan of Thai food you must eat at Pusadee's Garden!"}
{"text":"Superb Thai food in a beautiful outdoor setting.  I went during the summertime at night with friends and we shared a few bottles of wine we brought as its BYOB.  If its a nice warm night out and you're in the mood for some Thai food, there's no place better in the Pittsburgh area."}
{"text":"I'm in love with this place. I almost wish it was bigger, though, as it can be hard to get a table on the most random days. The food is excellent and the atmosphere (especially the outdoor patio) is so lovely.

If you're planning to eat here on a particular day, be sure to make a reservation before!"}
{"text":"When we arrived at the restaurant on a Saturday afternoon between lunch and dinnertime there was nobody seated inside (and would later find that only one table was occupied on the patio). We let the host know how many people were in our group (four adults and one child) and he asked if we placed a reservation. We hadn't and didn't think it was going to be a problem, but it kind of seemed like we were inconveniencing him. He received a call and talked for about five minutes before hanging up and seating us outside.

The patio/\"garden\" was lovely. I especially liked the pitcher plants! We ordered a street noodle dish with shrimp tempura, a soft-shell crab dish, green curry with beef, the garden fried rice with chicken and ate family style. We didn't have to wait long for the food and everything was delicious. The service could have been a little bit better though; at one point three of our water glasses were empty and my husband had to flag down a server to have them refilled.

Overall a good dining experience. We'll be back (probably in the evening when the patio is lit!) and maybe we'll make a reservation next time."}
{"text":"The only bad thing I can say is that they are closed from January - March.  Fresh, light-tasting, delicious Thai food.  We went in the winter so I haven't seen the outdoor space in its full glory, but it looked beautiful even in December.  The best Thai in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I had heard so much about this place and since my love for Thai food has no bounds - a visit here was a necessity. A nondescript exterior (similar to Nicky's!) opens to a bright and comfortable interior dining area which, although small, was sufficient if you wanted to eat inside. Our goal was to eat outside and we were seated in a delightful garden setting sheltered from the threat of rain by the cover of plants and trees. The menu was more limited than I had expected but there were plenty of options and we had no trouble choosing our appetizers and entrees. 

Interestingly, there were no daily specials which I thought was a bit odd. We started with the veggie spring rolls which were tasty if not a little overly crisp. We also had the tempura vegetables (kabocha squash and sweet potato chips) which were good but a little greasy. I could have sworn the squash was actually potatoes and not squash. 

I ordered the red chicken curry and my wife had the crispy tilapia. Also at the table we had tofu fried rice and pad thai. I tried to put aside my previously related bias towards all things Nicky's and approached this with an open mind. Alas, it fell short. First off, the selection of food options, especially in the seafood area, is no match for other Thai restaurants I've been to. Secondly, the range of flavors is far more limited. There wasn't that spectrum of unusual and delightful flavors I'm accustomed to when I order good Thai food. Third, the depth of flavor was severely lacking. Hints of Thai spices were there but the flavors fell flat and felt uninspired. All four of us commented along the same lines. 

The red curry was actually yellow in color and lacked the zip I look for. As you know, I always order my Thai food \"Thai hot\" but since this was my first time here, I only went with 9 on a scale of 1-10. It was not a 9 and didn't even wake up my taste buds. I know it's difficult to accurately and consistently replicate heat/spice levels, but a few red flakes floating in my curry is clearly not enough to elevate it to top heat levels. It was disappointing. My wife's tilapia didn't do it for me either and the \"spicy three flavor sauce\" was neither spicy nor have much flavor and the fish sat in what looked like a greasy pool on the plate. 

I think they're worthy of a 2.5-3 star rating since I feel a little generous and I need to compensate somehow for my Nicky's bias. I will certainly give them another shot but first impressions leave me disappointed. There are far better options around town for delightful Thai food.  If you're looking to try Thai for the first time, perhaps this is a good starter place. Then you can move up to really good Thai - go to Nicky's on the Northside. Still my favorite. No comparison"}
{"text":"The ambience is lacking. They offer spiciness on the overly-zealous scale of 1-10. If you order an 8 it tastes like a 3 on the more normal scale of 1-5. Beware too, they rush you out. Before we had buttoned our jackets, our table was being cleaned for the next party. With that said, the food is solid and seems freshly prepared."}
{"text":"I couldn't be happier that I stumbled across this gem of a restaurant on Yelp. I am a big fan of Thai food and regularly get chicken pad thai. 

I was easily moved to try this restaurant when I seen the pictures of the outdoor garden. Let me just say pictures don't do it justice. I am all about finding restaurants that have unique outdoor dining and this one is at the top of the list. It was filled with colorful flowers, vines and string lights. There was plenty of seats available outside, more so than inside seating. Some tables had umbrellas which was nice if you wanted shade. 

I almost diverged from my usual chicken pad thai; but in order for me to compare my experiences from places like Noodlehead and Nicky's Thai Kitchen, I wanted to stick with what I know and like. I really enjoyed my meal and found it to be very flavorful! I enjoyed it more than the chicken pad thai I ordered from Nicky's. The only reason I held back on 5 stars was due to the price. Noodlehead's chicken pad thai is better priced at $9 compared to Pusadee's priced at $13. I also think Noodlehead might give you a little more. But none the less that will not stop me from returning and trying some different menu items!"}
{"text":"Not a lot of people know about Pusadee's Garden so I consider it somewhat of a hidden gem.  I've been to Pusadee's Garden many times, and it's my favorite thai restaurant in Pittsburgh.

You MUST make a reservation to sit in the garden.  I've dined at Pusadee's at least a dozen times and each time the garden is packed and for good reason--the food is great and the garden is beautiful.  This would be a good place to take a date or have a girls night out.  They are able to accomodate a party of 12 but it was a little bit cramped so I don't know if you'd want to go with a group larger than that.  Also, if you go with a large gorup of people you'll want to know that they cannot split the bill so bring cash!

The food at Pusadee's is consistently good.  I've had just about everything on the menu but my two favorite dishes are the Pumpkin Curry with Tofu and Street Noodle #1.

The pumpkin curry is balanced and sweet.  They use just enough coconut milk to balance the bite of the curry and the chunks of lightly grilled pineapple are great.  I get this with tofu and brown rice.  This curry dish is light on the vegetables, sometimes it seems like more of a soup and I'm guilty of slurping the curry from the bowl and I do not care if you judge me--this stuff is delicious!  ;)

The Street Noodle #1 sounds unimpressive on the menu but this is fantastic.  The tempura chicken is to die for.

I strongly recommend the crispy tofu appetizer, it's delicious and the tofu is prepared in a tempura style which I relaly like, a lot of other restaurants offer this dish and the tofu has been deep fried and is swimming in an oily sauce.

When you order food they'll give you a spice level from 1 - 10.  THE FOOD IS HEAVY ON THE HEAT!  Pick your spice level consdervatively!

I like spicy food but bc I wanted to share my curry w a friend who wasn't a fan of spicy food I ordered a 5 and it was so hot it brough tears to my eyes.

If you like a little bit of spice but are unsure, go wiht a spice level #4.  Trust me.

My friend ordered a spice level #5 and her meal was so hot she couldn't eat it.  :(

The service here is so-so.  It's going to take them a long time to come ot your table so I'd advise ordering everything at once.  

Dont' come to Pusadee's if you are in a hurry, bc it takes a while for the kitchen to prepare your food but its worth the wait.

This place is BYOB."}
{"text":"If you're not a big fan of Thai food like me...  this place will change that.

This is my first visit to Pusadee's and the staff their couldn't have been nicer and accommodating. Great Food.. Great Environment.

Also, it's BYOB! and the Garden seating is the perfect place for some wine and dine"}
{"text":"Oh yes!  This is authentic Thai!  I was so happy to dine at this restaurant last night!  First of all, the outside garden area is incredible.  My friend and I were in awe of some of the beautiful trees and plants they have all around.  Would love to have this gorgeous space in my own yard!  I definitely recommend making a reservation so you get the prime outside seating!  (There are a few seats inside, but why?!?)
I went with a group of 5 and we wanted to try everything....so I think we did??!!  We all got the Tom Yum soup, which was spicy and delicious!  I mean, best I have ever had!  We ordered about 6 different appetizers.  The best one was the fried Tofu.    Sounds weird, but it came with this really yummy sauce!  I highly recommend.
For dinner I got the Panang Curry.  IT WAS AWESOME!  I get a level 7 spice, which is just spicy enough!  If you dont like spicy food, that is no problem!  Just tell them and they will lay off the spice!  
Did I mention this restaurant is BYOB?!?  My favorite!  There is a minimal cork fee. Also, this restaurant is not open in the winter.  The big draw is the garden, so they are not open for business once the weather gets too cold."}
{"text":"We came here on a weekday for dinner. The deck portion of the restaurant is beautiful and relaxing to have a good meal. This restaurant is also BYOB which is always a plus.  The staff was friendly and attentive to our needs. The food was pretty tasty and the portions were OK.  We had the pumpkin curry with beef, spring rolls and the pad thai. I really enjoyed the curry though! Never thought it would taste like that. It was a bit pricey but you pay for the atmosphere. I would definitely recommend coming here on a warm/cool day for dinner. They turn on the string lights which makes it wonderful!"}
{"text":"It may not be as good as the Smiling Banana Leaf, but it is still good :)  

Upon my first visit which was when the weather was a tad nicer, I was amazed at their beautiful outdoor seating area.  They get A+++++++++++++++ for that!  Very nice ambiance and in the nicer weather months, its a great place to enjoy a meal with a nice bottle of wine for sure.  It was very busy... and they lost our reservation which was a bit frustrating but they were able to accommodate us (Thankfully!).  

The steamed dumplings were quite pepper-laden, and their Pad Thai was good but nowhere near as good as a few other places that are in the area.  Their Spicy Eggplant was apparently scrumptious (my boyfriend raved about it but I did not try it).  

Service was decent... nothing over the top, but definitely pleasant.  BYOB too which is a nice little plus!"}
{"text":"One of my new favorite Thai places in Pittsburgh! We went to Pusadee's on a rare warm Autumn Saturday night and we were able to get outdoor seating at 930 after making reservations that day.  The garden is very romantic: a great place to take a special someone, sit outside, sip some wine (BYO) and enjoy some fantastic food. We had a group of 6, and there were larger tables towards the back of the patio that were perfectly accommodating. Warning: advance reserves are highly recommended, since that visit, I haven't been able to make same day reservations! We did it right- family style- and tried nearly the entire menu.  My favorite items were the curry puffs, the street noodles number one (topped with delicious crispy thai chicken), and the eggplant curry (spicy and delicious!) I'm still dreaming about the crispy chicken, but haven't been able to get my fix because they're always so busy! I'll definitely be back... If only I can remember to make reservations..."}
{"text":"I went two nights in a row.  It was THAT good!  I got the Wan See (I think) both nights and tried the sticky rice and mango dessert and the custard (with black sticky rice).  Out of this world.  The 2nd night we made reservations in advance and sat outside in the garden.  It was simply wonderful.  
The restaurant is BYOB."}
{"text":"I work three blocks away from Pusadee's Garden an it has become a regular staple of my work day. Their lunch prices are extremely reasonable ($7.50-$8.50 for most dishes) and the dishes are terrific across the board. Some of my go-to picks are the pumpkin curry, street noodles #2, and chicken kee mao. The staff is friendly, the service is fast, my only problem is that I'm always ordering take out from work so I never get to eat in their beautiful outdoor seating area."}
{"text":"Yelpers say to come here for the pumpkin curry, and they are right. They are so right that I have been back twice, and plan to be back every time I visit Pit.  Service was great and BYOB is always a plus."}
{"text":"Love the garden patio.  Excellent food and staff.  Fresh ingredients and lots of spice!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food I have ever eaten. To be fair, I've only tried 11 different Thai restaurants. I ordered panang and pumpkin curry. Both were delicious with quality ingredients, and accurate to the spiciness I selected. Their outdoor seating is very enchanting. Perfect for date night, gathering with friends and family, or whatever the occasion holds for you. Side note, if you are planning to byob, they have wine openers to assist and glasses to compliment. Other alcohol is of coarse also acceptable. Yes, go here! Happy Thai awaits you:)"}
{"text":"Perhaps the best and most beautiful patio in town, however the food is only so so. Definitely worth visiting on a nice day. I recommend bringing wine, beer or sake, and maybe some fresh chillies, to enhance your meal. For take out, I'd go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I visited Pusadee's Garden with a friend this past Sat. at 6pm with a friend.  She was in the mood for Thai food, I wanted to visit Art All Night, and the weather was nice, so Pusadee's seemed like an obvious choice.  I called and made a reservation a couple of days ahead of time, and they told us the 6pm would be fine as long as we were finished by 7:30, which wasn't a problem.

Given that the weather was nice, we opted to sit in the garden.  As many other reviewers have pointed out, it's absolutely lovely, providing a serene environment for a casual meal.  On the day of our visit, the weather was perfect--neither too hot or cold or windy--and the umbrella over our table, with the trellises, shielded us from the bright sunlight.

While I was aware that Pusadee's is BYOB, I opted not to bring adult beverages given that my friend is sensitive to alcohol.  Instead, I ordered my favorote Thai non-alcoholic beverage--a Thai iced tea ($2.50).  While this one wasn't quite as good as the one I had at another nearby Thai eatery, it was respectable nonetheless, and was also rather large.

For food, we started out by ordering the fresh spring rolls ($7).  They were the perfect accompaniment for Thai food served in an outdoor garden environment--light, fresh, and delicate.  They tasted like salad in a roll, and the basil dipping sauce that came with them served as a flavorful yet light dressing.

For our entrees, I ordered the street noodle #2 ($13), and my friend ordered the pad kee mao ($13).  Similar to a version of this dish I tried at Noodlehead, the street noodle dish consisted of egg noodles interspersed with sprouts and bok choi topped with a generous helping of Thai fried chicken.  The portion size was the same as--or perhaps slightly smaller than--that of the corresponding dish at Noodlehead, despite the price being $4 higher.  I didn't try my friend's kee mao, but she seemed to enjoy it, and a similar comparison seemed to apply.  I was happy with my specified spice level of 4/10, but my friend, who's Chinese and ordered 8/10, wished hers was spicier--next time, she should order it Thai hot!

Overall, we were generally pleased with our meal at Pusadee's.  Although the service was rather mediocre, the food was decent--not the best Thai I've had in PGH, but certainly not the worst, either.  As others have said, the garden is the most unique aspect of Pusadee's, so be sure to visit when the weather's nice so you can enjoy the lovely al fresco dining!"}
{"text":"Excellent curry, portions are correctly sized (not massive), and outside seating is wonderful (at least in the summer.) Location in Lawrenceville is cool for walking around afterwards. Only complaint is that when you ask for 10 out of 10 spice, it disappoints."}
{"text":"It probably does not need to be said that one comes here for the really nice garden that is part of the actual restaurant. I think they actually did a very nice job with it; you are surrounded by all sorts of pretty plants and leaves, and you're even shielded from the sun by plants above you. It's a great atmosphere for eating Thai food in particular. That said, the food here is great as well. Portions are a bit smaller than say Thai Gourmet or Smiling Banana Leaf, but they make some good items here. The noodle salad was very flavorful with the added herbs, and the street noodle #2 came with a generous portion of shrimp tempura. A solid choice on a nice sunny day!"}
{"text":"Oh Yelpers, you've blown this place up in a way that's completely unwarranted. True, the patio is cute enough. Sure, the staff is friendly. Ok, the menu has quite a few tempting sounding options even though its a bit smaller than some other Thai menus. But was it a stellar, 5 star worthy dance on my palate? Nope. Sorry. 

Our party of four started with two vegetarian appetizers, the crispy spring rolls and the tempura vegetables. The vegetables were pretty good, lightly fried and crispy,but the spring rolls weren't very delicious. Heavy with a soggy cabbage center. I ordered the Pad Thai for my entree, as I figured that would be a good gauge of Pusadee's Garden's style. My food was forgettable. Not bad, just nothing special about it. Almost bland where I wanted an explosion of layers of flavor. Am I asking too much? I don't think so, because I've had such an experience at another Thai restaurant that I won't bother mentioning here because its not quite fair. There's no comparison! I also sampled my wife's fried rice dish, which to me wasn't worth the calories based on how non-exciting it was.

If I lived close by I'm sure I would occasionally order take out. It was perfectly good Thai cuisine. It just didn't excite me. Am I spoiled? Perhaps. A certain North Side establishment has apparently changed my expectations forever. I'm open to heading back and trying the Kao Soi, one of my favorite dishes. But as of now, Pusadee's Garden stands at a solid 3 stars."}
{"text":"I was very excited to take my grandmother and aunt to this restaurant for Mother's Day, but unfortunately after being mistreated we decided to leave. After checking Yelp to see if reservations were necessary-which they weren't, we decided to bring a party of six to the restaurant thinking it wouldn't be too much. When we arrived, the waitress asked us if we had reservations and she said it was okay if we didn't. Then she asked if we would like to sit outside, even though it was clearly raining. After politely saying no, she said that all of the indoor tables were reserved even though there were many open tables (with enough seats for six people). We decided to leave because of the lack of service given, and unfortunately we cannot say that we will return."}
{"text":"Pusadee's is probably the best Thai restaurant in the city and IMO, I would rank it next to Nicki's  thai kitchen in downtown. We decided to go there on a rainy Saturday evening and we called ahead to make a reservation. The person receiving the phone as well as the person who received and seated us were very courteous . 

We started off with the crispy veg rolls, which were delicious. For entrees we had shrimp fried rice, red curry with chicken and kee mao. The waiter did warn us that 3 is a medium spice level (as compared to 5 in other restaurants) So always order a spice level or 2 lower than what you usually have at other places. I ordered a 5 and it was perfect for me.

We would totally come back to Pusadee's, hopefully someday when it isn't rainy so we can sit out in their beautiful garden."}
{"text":"The food is great and the ambiance is romantic and almost whimsical. If you have a summer date that enjoys spicy food, take them here!! The garden is so beautiful. They have a one to ten scale of spicy, please be warned to order less than your usual number, it is extremely hot."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place!! We ordered one of everything on the menu , literally!!! Highly satisfied!! Def order the puff pastries with veggies in them, it's under the appetizers I will def return!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere.  This is a very cozy restaurant and in the art district so its great for people watching. The food, it's average. I really liked the cabbage salad. The Tom Kar soup was definitely not my favorite.  All the entrées were just average not great. Service was good. There was a flea floating in my water. I'd go back. One last tip, when they ask how you like the spice 1-10, order 2 points less then you usually order. They have a heavy hand on the spice."}
{"text":"In my opinion, Noodle head has the better food, but Pusadee's has the better atmosphere, especially if you want to eat outside on the patio. 

The menu is nearly identical to Noodle head in terms of selection, but the prices are slightly more as they take cards. However I found the food to be less hot here compared to Noodle head - a 7 here was more like a 2 or 3 at Noodle head.

The noodles were amazing though, as were the appetizers. While it may be difficult to find the entrance, once you do you'll be rewarded with a great meal and a great view. However it may not be worth going across town for, if you're near Noodle head."}
{"text":"I was there with two friends celebrating one of their birthdays. The food was adequate, the service beyond rude. Our waitress told us at the end of our meal that they only allow each group one and a half to two hours at the table since there are people waiting, and our table did not have time for desert! My friend said: so basically you're kicking us out? And she didn't say anything. Technically, we still had 15 mins. We paid and left. I can't see any of us going back again."}
{"text":"Solid 4 stars. The outside garden was beautiful and perfect for a summer evening! They were able to get us reservations same day- didn't think it would be that busy for a Wednesday! Some of the portions (spicy crap app and the pork noodles) could have been bigger and also needed more spice. The kao soi was delicious."}
{"text":"The food here is excellent, it is priced a few dollars higher than some of the other Thai restaurants here though. I've had the pumpkin curry, pineapple curry, and both street noodle dishes here. The street noodle dishes are amazing! The chicken is some of the best fried chicken I've ever had!

The outdoor patio is also amazing! It's the best outdoor seating in the city. It's definitely a great spot for dates, it's very pretty at night.

The only complaint I have was they need some sturdier containers for leftovers. I had a curry to take home, and it ended up all over my pants, my car, and my purse because it started leaking once I got to my car! Plastic or styrofoam is needed for the dishes with a lot of sauce I think!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent and fresh tasting. The Thai fresh spring rolls were very good as an appetizer and a highlight of the meal. The sticky rice with mango was good, not great but still adequate.

Service was fast and courteous and the place was clean. It's right on Butler street and the only tricky part was finding street parking. Recommend, and would return to."}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about this place. The outside seating area is just beautiful at night-tons of trees, plants, and lights. Its like a secret garden. And the food is the best thai food I have ever had. Their street noodle #1 and kao soi are to die for. So much flavor, big portions and was served very fast. They also have plenty of other great dishes and appetizers to choose from. We ordered the crab rolls, steamed pork dumplings and chicken satays, all delicious and came with excellent sauces. Oh yeah, and its BYOB! Can't beat that. And to top it all off, it is very affordable. Will be spending many more nights there this summer."}
{"text":"If you are ever in the area, this is a must stop! The outdoor area was magical- a perfect place for a date night!"}
{"text":"This is darn good Thai. Whenever I visit one of my besties, who lives in Lawrenceville, I request this place for dinner one night! We grab a couple bottles of wine & walk on down. The outdoor seating is lovely, it's like a magical little world. I've always found the service to be good (...and I work in the industry), although sometimes slow. Not because they're inattentive, but because the place is super busy. I see a some reviewers are all \"call me a wahhhmbulance\" over being rushed out. Look, I mentioned that I work in the biz, fine dining at that, & I'll break it down for ya real quick....2 hrs at your table at a busy restaurant is what you get. They're right up front about needing the tables & ask politely for you to limit your stay so they can accommodate everyone who wants to eat their tasty food and the server can make a living. It is not your living room, it's a business. Notice they boo-hoo, but admit they were told up front about time constraints & said okay. LOL. Also, for the guy who called 'for a place to eat after 9' and gave the place one star & scathing review? Dude, they CLOSE at 9pm. Bring it down a notch. You should be happy they cooked for you."}
{"text":"Never had better Thai food before! Great service! Loved the outdoor garden setting. Don't forget to BYOB. You WONT be disappointed."}
{"text":"Well executed Thai classics and a few surprises, elegant interior, and surely one of the best patios in the city.

What's to love?

--The menu is simple, well organized, and has lots of Thai classics, with a few surprises like spinach soup.
--Very vegetarian friendly; they were able to leave fish sauce out of my curry, and w/o any detectable flavor loss.
--The interior is elegant and spotless.  Easily navigable layout.
--Unbelievably friendly staff.
--It's in Lawrenceville and walking distance from some good bars.
--Great patio!!  Really big, beautiful garden, and lots of seating.

What's not to love?

--The patio, while absolutely lovely, could use a couple warming towers (preferably electric) for cool spring evenings.
--We had to wait far too long to order, and the restaurant was only about 3/4 full.  That's really why they lose a star.
--No booze, which is unfortunate because the crowd seemed like the wine-ordering type.

Eat here!!"}
{"text":"If I could give it 3.5 I would. We sat in the garden and it was great. Began to rain tonight and they offered to move us under cover while still being able to experience the garden.  I think the food was above average taste wise but the portions are smaller than I'm used to at other local thai restraunts. I ordered the Kai soi at a 7 because I was told by the server they are spicier than other establishments. I found it to be very mild. With that being said I understand not all dishes are as spicy as others so I won't pass any judgement here. My wife got the woon Sen and hers was spicier than mine and she had a 2. 

We will certainly return but wish the portions were larger and the spice was more consistent.  I also wonder what the atmosphere is like when the weather is poor given that they lose 75 percent of their seating when the porch is closed. 

In summary worth the stop to make your own judgment."}
{"text":"A friend and I made it out to this wonderful Thai restaurant this past Saturday, 7/13/13.  My friend made us a reservation for a table out in the garden.  I must say, the garden is very well kept and gorgeous.  If you make a trip out to this restaurant, I highly recommend eating out in the garden. 

I started with the Steamed Dumplings, which I believe were homemade and absolutely delicious.  For my main dish, I got the Pad Thai w/Chicken.  This was by far the best Pad Thai I have had in Pittsburgh.  I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I stopped by here with my fiancé for dinner two Saturdays ago.  We had been looking to come here for quite awhile and finally found a night when we were able to.  It was shortly after 5 whenever we arrived and we were asked whether we had reservations.  We did not but thankfully were still able to be seated in the garden so long as would be done by 6:30.  The garden area is beautiful with many different plants and gives off a vineyard/European bistro type feel.  While we did not bring any wine, we saw that almost every other table had since it was BYOB.

My fiancé and I decided to start off our meals with the fried tofu and then I went with the pineapple curry, spice level 10, with chicken for my entree.  The tofu was good as it had a nice sweet n sour sauce to dip it in and the breading was nice too.  The only part that I think could have been better was if the inside tofu was a little firmer.  Shortly after the tofu was cleared, our entrees were brought out to us.  My curry was good with the spice level being perfect for me.  There was an ample amount of items in it and whenever I had finished the rice that it came with, the waitress asked if I wanted some more.  Overall it was a good meal in a beautiful setting.

The bottom line for me is that I will definitely be back here again in the future. Hopefully next time we will have a bottle of wine and reservations to enjoy both the food and ambiance.

**UPDATE**  I visited for a second time tonight with my fiance and parents.  Since we didn't have reservations we were stuck inside which was just fine by me.  My food wasn't nearly as good, it lacked some of the good flavors from the first time and our service was also pretty slow.  Due to that, I knocked my original 5 stars down to 4."}
{"text":"Came in at 9:30 on a Saturday. Server wasn't sure if he should seat us, but the owner/manager did. Unfortunately, we didn't get to enjoy the outdoor area because it was a bit chilly. 

We ordered a spring roll appetizer, which was fresh, delicate, crisp and the sauce was perfect. I could have eaten a plate of these for dinner. 

I did the pumpkin curry with chicken ; and the BF had eggplant basil. They give you a choice of 'heat', from 1-10. I'm a little girl when it comes to spice and went with a 5 ... which was still considerably spicy. The BF went with an 8, but in tasting his the sweetness of his sauce balanced the spice really well. Both dishes were served with white rice (brown rice is $1.50 upcharge - meh). Portion was large enough for leftovers (yay!).   

This was hands down the best Thai I've had in Pittsburgh. The sauces had well developed flavor, rich but not overwhelming. Will definitely be back (maybe for lunch, since prices are more or less half of what the dinner prices are)."}
{"text":"I have been hearing about Pusadee's for far too long from a good friend of mine to have not gone. Last night was my chance! It wasn't a perfect meal but it was the closest thing to it, given the circumstance. It was a Saturday night and insanely busy. We were sat and there was a decent wait to order. The serving assistants were keeping us well hydrated from our bike ride and it was evident how busy they were so we did not mind. 

We decided to share food in order to get the most of our experience. To start, we got crispy crab rolls, grilled pork meatballs and tom kar (sometime tom kha) soup. The crab rolls were pretty good although I probably would opt for a spring roll next time. The meatballs were really good and came on sugar cane skewers that added to the entire experience. Our soup was good but we did ask for a spice level 7 and there was no spice I could distinguish. We let our server know and he came back quickly with a new, spicier version that was perfect. 

The main even was our shared entree of kao soi. It is a chicken, noodle and yellow curry dish that was spot on! They certainly did not leave out the spice this time! We devoured our entree in record time. I would only say that I didn't see much of the shallots and mustard greens mentioned in the description on the menu. However, I ate it too quickly to be positive that there should have been more. Overall, it was a great experience with a wonderful staff and even better food!"}
{"text":"Best atmosphere I have seen in a Pittsburgh restaurant!  This place has the most darling garden with some cover from the sun where you sit outside and enjoy your food.  I love the overgrowth with the vines and the natural feel (disclaimer--natural also means there are flies!).

GREEN PAPAYA SALAD-- legit, spot on with the flavor!  definitely get this, I don't see it served in many thai restaurants!

CRISPY TOFU-- tasty but came with a sauce that was 90% peanuts, 10% sauce (um more sauce over here, please?)

CRISPY TILAPIA --good, fried, and flavorful, but it had sauce just piled on it that I couldn't really recognize that it was fish (did not remind me of some of the beautiful fish dishes I saw in Thailand)

SOFT SHELL CRAB--good, fried, with some curry sauce on top, but came with some pathetic limp vegetables

THAI ICED TEA--hit the spot!

I gotta ding them for the service of some of the hired help.  I shouldn't be told over the phone when making a reservation that I need to be out of my table by 8 pm because there's another party coming in.  Whoever I talked to really needs to check himself!  In addition our waiter just plopped our food down in front of us with a real lack of effort that made me feel like he just threw food at me.  The owners, however, seem very courteous and brought us our leftovers themselves.  

Overall, food was okay for what we paid for, over 50 bucks for all the above.  The garden, however, will have me coming back before it gets too cold to try some of the noodle dishes!"}
{"text":"Pusadee's is awesome.  Really try to get there in the summer when the garden is in bloom :)"}
{"text":"I went with a vegetarian friend and I loved it - we both like spicy food and finding *actually* spicy food in pittsburgh can be tough sometimes! My spice level 8, street noodle 1 was perfect - and a really filling portion side.

I also got the Thai ice tea which was good (but not as creamy as I'm used to), and the golden bag appetizer (which was $4 for 4 tiny little egg roll like things). I'd stick to the main dishes

The outdoor patio is very nice as well"}
{"text":"Pusadee's Garden was good, but my experience here didn't match the hype.  The service started out incredibly slow when the restaurant wasn't even half-filled.

My curry dish came out in a tall square bowl, which looked interesting, but compromised on functionality.  Once I had eaten a sufficient amount, the remaining chunks of meat and veggies were completely submerged in the sauce, leaving me groping around with chopsticks hoping to find purchase on some chicken.  It was tasty enough, but nothing above and beyond other Pittsburgh Thai places (which admittedly set an unusually high standard).

I tried a rice noodle and chicken dish one of my companions ordered as well.  The chicken was phenomenal, but the noodles, rather than being spicy-sweet, were just overly and cloyingly sweet.

Roll all of that up in mid-level prices which aren't exactly a bargain, and it doesn't make my \"best Thai in Pittsburgh\" list, though it might be \"best Thai in Lawrenceville.\""}
{"text":"After scrambling to get everyone together in the car and make the reservation on time, we ended up not having to hurry in the first place because there were still 2 tables left. 

We got the green chicken curry, red tofu curry, chicken pumpkin curry, and chicken pad thai. The whole meal was pretty average, The tofu didn't really go with the curry and the chicken was a little dry. On top of that the currys seemed too watery. The meal was way too expensive for what they had to offer. 

The garden was what brought me here and it was really something worth seeing, but after an hour or two I was done..."}
{"text":"Came on a Sunday without reservations and was offered a table that was reserved in 90 minutes. That was more than enough time for us to eat and we were in and out in an hour. The garden was beautiful and the food was even better. I'm glad to live a block away from what will soon be a favorite place to eat."}
{"text":"We came here on a Sunday evening in summer, on a double date with some friends.  We made a reservation, but there were a handful of tables to spare for walk-ins.  We were seated outside in their garden, which is a lovely patio decorated with little lights, and covered in flowering plants.  It feels secluded and private, and it's easy to forget that there are other patrons around you.

We brought two bottles of wine, which our served opened for us - even brought us an ice bucket for the white wine.  It's only $1 a glass to BYOB which is a pretty sweet deal.  Service isn't speedy, but it's definitely at a relaxing pace.  You have time to swallow your appetizers before your entree shows up, and nobody slams the check down next to you when half of your pad thai is still on the plate.  Gotta love that.

We started with the Grilled Pork Meatballs - four of them come skewered on sugar cane and they are delicious!  Juicy and succulent and flavorful.  They didn't come with a \"dipping sauce\" as advertised, but there was a little bit of sauce drizzled over them, so maybe that's what they meant?

For my entree, I got the Spicy Duck Noodles at a level 5, which ended up being the perfect spice level.  It was definitely spicy, giving my mouth a kick, but I wasn't sweating and gasping and diving for my water glass.  I'd get food at a level 5 here again next time - I like being able to feel the heat without my taste buds getting too numb to get the other flavors.  The duck was tender, the broth was savory, and the noodles were slurpable.  Not much veg in the dish, but it was very tasty nonetheless - super fresh, and I actually finished the whole thing!  I ate it so happily that I didn't have even remember to taste my boyfriend's Massaman Curry, which he said was delicious as well.

I think Pusadee's and Kanok are really on par with each other - great, fresh Thai in a beautiful setting.  Worth the money for sure.  It's several steps above your average Thai takeout, and I hope we'll return to Pusadee's again before the summer is over - that outdoor patio is just fantastic!"}
{"text":"This place has tasty food but small portions for the price. The outside scenery is a beautiful garden and you should definitely try it when the weather is nice.  I had the red chicken curry and see yew noodles,  birth delicious! Also had the fresh spring rolls as an appetizer and mango sticky rice and Thai custard for dessert."}
{"text":"Very special place in the 'Burgh. Back in college, I used to head here with friends on Saturday nights to fuel the tank right before shaking our asses off a few blocks down at Lawrenceville bars. #BYOBbaby I've also been on dates and meetings at Pusadee's. In fact, I dig this place so much that I even had my graduation lunch there with all family nestled in the garden. Pusadee's is the best Thai experience in Pittsburgh---low key, local, cheap, fresh, charming, and high quality. All the curry dishes are great. What I like is that they are not very sweet, unlike some other restaurants in the city tend to make 'em. Try the Green Curry if you like spice. 

*Tips* If you're going on a weekend night during a colder season, try to make a reservation because indoor seating gets tight. If you want lunch on a sunny weekend, try to arrive near opening hours to get a good seat in the garden. Don't forget your wine!"}
{"text":"Authentic Thai food that's reasonably priced. It's in the heart of Lawrenceville and there is plenty of street parking (free). The quality is great and they even pluck fresh herbs and spices from their \"garden.\" Well worth the visit."}
{"text":"I don't always ask for a second round of food.... so the fact that Pusadee's Garden managed to do so gets them started at 5 stars in my mind.

Came here on a double date, me, the husb, the bff, and her husb. Brought a cool bottle of Robert Mondavi wine. Unfortunately booked too late to get the outdoor garden (shiny lightbulbs!) but got seated inside quickly. We started with the garden roll for appetizers, then did, family style, street noodle #1, red curry with chicken, cumin beef, and grilled salmon. The portions were a leeetttle small for Pittsburgh, but the flavors were great. The street noodle #1 with the fried chicken was the #1 hit, and that we ordered for a second round. The red curry was quickly lapped up. Cumin beef - the beef was a little bit on the tough side and cook use a bit more of a cook or braise and I didn't get much of the cumin. The grilled salmon was fine but not extraordinary. Docking half a star for that.

Service was attentive though they were really enthusiastic for clearing our plates before we were done multiple times, which was annoying and the reason for me taking away another half star. Nevertheless, we enjoyed ourselves and had a good time."}
{"text":"Let me just start by saying how cute is their outdoor patio/garden?! Absolutely loved all of the trees and plants. A friend and I lucked out going here back in the spring one day it just so happened to be beautiful out and boy was I glad because the inside isn't all that appealing. Which is a the main reason I could only give them 3 stars. If it's not a nice day I probably wouldn't visit this restaurant. 

But enough about the restaurant itself, let's talk about the most important part, the food. I ordered the Thai iced tea and the tom yum soup to start. This was my first Thai iced tea so I don't have much to compare it to but it seemed a little too sweet for my liking. The tom yum on the other hand was the best part of my meal. The fresh veggies with the lemon flavor in the soup was delicious. I'm a huge sucker for intense lemon flavor though. As my main dish I went with my go to pad see ew with tofu. Definitely wasn't the best pad see ew I have had. The tofu had a very mushy texture which I wasn't a big fan of. It could have had a little more sauce but other than that I think it was still a good dish."}
{"text":"I went to Pusadee's Garden for my first time tonight with family. We had a party of 9. This place is amazing! The ambiance of the garden transports you to a calm and serene environment; you completely forget that you are right on Butler street! The wait staff is very attentive and friendly. We started with crispy spring rolls and curry puffs. The spring rolls were on par with what you'd get anywhere else but the curry puffs were really great! Just enough pastry to keep the curried vegetables inside, but definitely not too thick. I had the street noodles #1 and my boyfriend had the yellow curry with roti. The rice noodles were super light and delicious, but I was ready to wrestle for that yellow curry! Flavorful and sweet with a bit of a kick. We both got a 4 for heat which was pretty mild. Next time I will venture for a 6. And there will definitely be a next time!"}
{"text":"Love the interior and how clean and basic it is. The staff is very friendly, and the service was prompt (even though it was a busy Saturday evening and we didn't have reservations). I always love a BYOB restaurant, and the $1 glass fee is a great deal :)

The food is so, so yummy! The fresh spring rolls came with such a unique flavored sauce and it was the perfect sized appetizer so you had plenty of room for the main course! I had the Pumpkin Tofu Curry and it was amazing! The flavor was rich and fresh and the brown rice came in a little pod which was a great presentation.

Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Ah, it's so great to have good Thai neighborhood places around. Came to visit on a beautiful Friday evening without a reservation and the hostess kindly seated us outside, letting us know she needed the table in a little over an hour for another reservation. We chanced it and were out of there in 45 minutes. 

We had the pork dumplings as an app and they were good. Softer filling than I'm used to and more binding in them than meat, but it was still very tasty. I had some Tom Kar soup with veggies and it was good but still a tad more sour than I would have liked. 

My friend and I both had yellow curry with chicken and Asian sweet potatoes, served with roti. It was the best Thai dish I've had in an incredibly long amount of time. Dark meat chicken and made the dish really stand apart from that those typical overcooked white meat slivers other places give you. The curry sauce was everything you'd want a Thai curry to be, and I'm a ginormous fan of roti bread and theirs was plentiful and delicious. 

What really takes this place over the top was the gorgeous patio. I've seen it mentioned in other reviews before but you've seriously gotta see it for yourself. I'd imagine it becomes very romantic once the sun goes down and the lights are up."}
{"text":"I love Thai food. Pusadee's Garden was exceptional on all fronts. What I mean by that is, we got there at 9:45pm on a Saturday (traffic) and even though they close at 10pm they seated us without annoyance. We burst through the door like a couple of savages and the hostess just smiled at us and said \"Just the two of you?\" The outdoor garden is so beautiful and transports you to a different place. Food was outstanding. But be warned: SUPER SPICY! I asked for a level 3 which I consider to be mild but my mouth was on fire. I know, I'm not your typical Indian because I can't handle spicy food but 3 was over the top for me! Huz is much better about it and could've handled a 6 or 7 but he also thought it was pretty spicy for a 3. Anyway, amazing food, amazing service, amazing all around."}
{"text":"Yeah, yeah, yeah... I know what you are thinking. \"ANOTHER 5-star review from this guy?\" OK, I guess I do hand those out, but I honestly believe that I've gotten fairly good at avoiding the places that won't be good; thanks to Yelp and all of you guys, so there's a little bit of selection bias going on here... That being said, on to my review of Pusadee's Garden... 

This place is INCREDIBLE!! I recently stumbled upon a few really nice reviews for the place, and figured that today would be an opportune moment to take my family out for a nice Sunday lunch here.

The entire experience did not disappoint! The photos on this page definitely do this place justice, although I must say it is even more quaint in person. The indoor space is quite nice as well, for those frigid or sizzling months when you would not really want to be on the patio...

We had the garden rolls, steamed pork dumplings, woon sen (bean thread noodles, egg, and vegetables), and spicy seafood. For drinks, we tried the tamarind juice, mango juice, and Thai iced tea. Not one item was \"meh\" or uninspired - honestly, I felt as if we had been invited to a Thai family's home for a delicious home-cooked meal made from scratch with every dish. Here's the breakdown:

Garden rolls - delicious \"salad in roll format\" with tasty veggies, thin rice vermicelli, and tofu. Served with a delicious spicy sweet and sour sauce

Steamed pork dumplings - tasty home-made dumplings served with a really nice mildly spicy soy sauce

Woon sen - very tasty clear bean noodles, served with egg and a ton of delicious fresh mushrooms, broccoli, cauliflower, and carrots. Mildly spicy - they ask you how hot you want it when you place the order, so it can be adjusted to your tastes.

Spicy seafood - very nice plate of jumbo Thai shrimp (6), green mussels (4), and squid, served in a very tasty spicy sauce with tempura eggplant and rice on the side.

Drinks were spectacular too - everything tasted home-made. Wow. It's BYOB and the glass fee is totally reasonable if you want to bring something to enjoy. Service was good - nothing rushed, but it wasn't slow for us - dishes came out in less than 10 minutes from when we ordered, even with the garden patio being full. I hear it's wise to make a reservation here if you want to have dinner, since it is rumored to get pretty crowded at night...

Just. Wow.

I think we have found a new go-to place for Sunday lunch and Friday dinners!! They were also very friendly to our little one, which earns them props... Will definitely be back to try a bunch of different dishes in the near future!"}
{"text":"OMG I loved this place! Such a beautiful garden oasis in the middle of Pittsburgh! Sitting out in the garden was so peaceful and the perfect place to relax on a nice summer day or night.  Even though it was cute inside, I would probably only go if I could sit outside, because I've been spoiled by the garden now. 

 Our food was really good, here's what we ordered.

-Crispy Spring Rolls - came with 2 for $4.  Really crunchy and the spicy plum sauce was awesome!
-Street noodles #2 - Loved the tempura shrimp in this dish!
-Chicken Cashew Rice - I was expecting more cashews, but the flavor was really good.

As long as the weather is nice, it's safe to say you'll find me back at Pusadee's Garden!"}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's birthday. It's a small restaurant but they have outdoor seating. I recommend making reservations. We made it for 12 people and they were able to hold us comfortably but you should make them in advance. The selection is decent and they have a variety of choices. Another plus is it's a BYOB! They don't charge a bottle fee either. We all brought our bottles of wine to share. I started off with the fresh spring rolls which were delicious and not to filling. I opted for the red curry with tofu. The spice levels are from 1-10  and I got a 5. 

It was not vary spicy in my opinion so next time I will get a higher number. The staff was very attentive and the curry tasted great."}
{"text":"Great food, amazing outdoor area.  A bit pricier than most Thai, but it's definitely worth it.  I would say this is one of the  best outdoor dining experiences in the city.  It can get really busy, so make sure to make reservations for Friday and Saturday nights."}
{"text":"Thai food is my favorite. Pusadees is a great spot to go to dinner for some great good. Every time I have been there the service has been great and the food is always above average."}
{"text":"Tried one more time. Made reservations for 1:30. After seating, they asked us to move to make it work for a subsequent large party...that was fine!    It's was pleasant in the shade. Had crab rolls...they were good, not great. Hubby had WoonSen with seafood...was told an upcharge for seafood and we agreed.  I had green curry with shrimp and brown rice   (Again...extra 2.00 for brown rice ....ridiculous).  My green curry was good...many shrimp but veggies were blah. Minimal broccoli, eggplant was burnt nd no zucchini .  Flavor was OK. Hubby was charged for al seafood at $21 .  Lots of seafood but for the value was low. If it wasn't for the garden...we wouldn't be back. Smiling Banana Leaf if much better for price and flavor.   I really wanted to have a better review.  $50 fo an app and two entrees is too much. I'll go to Nickys or SBL"}
{"text":"Love this place so much. For starters, if you haven't yet dined in their backyard garden oasis, get there ASAP. It's one of the most beautiful places to dine outside in Pittsburgh. So much greenery, flowers, and lighting. Also, the staff is so wonderful. They are so kind, so attentive, your water cup will be refilled before it's halfway gone. Everything on the menu is so great. They have a wide variety of various noodle dishes, curries, soups, great appetizers, etc. etc. The best green curry I've ever had was here. Their dried chili flakes pack the greatest punch and are so fresh.  Typically I stick to the same noodle dish at Thai restaurants, but here I actually enjoy trying all new menu items because everything proves to be better than the last and so consistent. So happy to hear they purchased the lot next door so they will be expanding the restaurant (both the indoor & outdoor seating). However they'll be closed for most of 2018 for the remodel, and hope to reopen by end of summer 2018."}
{"text":"Great food!!  Very authentic.  Love the BYOB!Atmosphere outside is fabulous.  Inside is very plain."}
{"text":"By far the BEST outdoor seating in Pittsburgh, once you go into the garden you feel like you are in a fairy wonderland. My party consisted of three people and we did not make a reservation. We had to wait about 45 minutes because the garden was over crowded. The staff was incredibly hospitable, ensuring that we would have a table soon. The wait staff was attentive and helpful. The food was AMAZING. I've only had Thai food a handful of times but this was my favorite. 

Helpful hints for next time: make a reservation, sit outside, and bring a bottle of wine, or two!"}
{"text":"I love that all the Thai places I've been to around Pittsburgh are BYOB!

The entrance is weird-- is there a second one? We walked in and there wasn't really an entrance... It took me a good 10 seconds of people staring at us after walking in before I made the move to walk to the back where I found the (front?) desk. No one came to us either so I don't know what to make of that.

We didn't have reservations for a Friday night, but they were able to seat the 6 of us without a wait. The dining area is small and narrow -- it reminds me of someone's living room. The atmosphere is inconsistent, but not surprising since it's in Lawrenceville. (Examples:  dimly lit dining area - elegant, waiters in zip up sweaters - super casual, disposable wooden chopsticks in fabric sleeves - casual + fancy, & noisy - casual.)

For appetizers we ordered grilled pork meatballs (loved the sugarcane), papaya salad, chicken satay, and shumai (pork dumplings on the menu? Anyway, these were small and disappointing in flavor). For mains-- pad thai, see yew, kee mao, and a shrimp fried rice. The portions are a little bigger than Noodlehead's, but not by much considering the price difference. Originally we asked for a 7 spice level, but the waiter told us that it was really spicy. So we went with 6. -- It wasn't spicy ):

Be true to your spice level! Don't let the anyone doubt yourself."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to visit this place for quite some time, since we live nearby.  We went on a cooler night, and sat on the patio of course.  We didn't have a reservation, but they were able to fit us in before the dinner rush.  

I'd give the food 3 stars, but I'm giving an overall 4 because the garden is just so beautiful.  I ordered the Street Noodles.  They were good, and I really liked the vinegar based sauce.  That was something different from the other Thai restaurants I've visited.  

One last note - if you're looking for spicy, this probably isn't the place to go.  I ordered a spice level 8 out of 10, that would be comparable to a 2 or a 3 at another Thai place."}
{"text":"I had one of the best meals of my life here: yellow curry with roti. The garden is beautiful."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place. 

I came here because of the good reviews, but I was definitely skeptical. I feel like most of the Thai food I've had hasn't ever been mind-blowing. I simply love it because I think all of the flavors are great... but it seems like there was little difference between most Thai places. Most dishes always seem very similar... it's been fairly rare to ever eat a truly distinctive dish at most Thai places. The only dishes that have REALLY stuck out was if something was prepared poorly.

But I realized my mistake when I came here. I've always tried ordering the usual suspects at most Thai places... pad thai, pad see yew, or any of the curries, etc... but I went out on a limb and ordered something called \"Street Noodles #1\".. and I am completely obsessed with it. It's rice noodles sitting in a spicy, savory broth with mung bean spouts and bok choy, topped with slices of perfectly crisp, juicy chicken breast. It's the only thing I order and the only thing I think of now whenever I crave Thai food. 

And being seated in the garden during a warm, breezy day can't be beat. It's gorgeous. 

oh, and you can byob :D 

I almost want to discourage people from going because the seating is so limited... it's a good thing they honor reservations."}
{"text":"This is one of the first restaurants that I visited when I first moved to Pittsburgh. This restaurant received great reviews from my coworkers and they were completely correct! Every meal that I have had here has been wonderful! And the fact that its BYOB, makes it even better! Their outdoor seating area in the warm months is just magical! I recommend going anytime of the year, but especially in summer!"}
{"text":"I had been meaning to go here for years and I'm so happy I finally went. Delicious food and quick service. I got the pad thai and split it with a friend. She doesn't like spice but I do, so we got a \"2\" and to my surprise it was so tasty, I didn't need any extra chili paste. It was moist and not too fishy. I was very satisfied with the whole dinner."}
{"text":"I really like this restaurant. The outdoor patio is really nice, and I appreciate the BYOB. My primary complaint is that the food was somewhat bland. We ordered it fairly spicy, and it was kind of spicy, but the flavor just wasn't there. That said, I'll probably go back, hoping to find something that I can really love."}
{"text":"Wish I could give 3.5 stars here because that's exactly where I am on Pusadee's Garden. The garden space is really pretty with overhead grapevine trellises providing shade & seclusion and a treat in Upper Lawrenceville. The inside is comfortable, modern & really well done, too. The weather cooperated and we got seated outside.

The menu is smaller than many other Thai restaurants in the city but I found 2 appealing seafood dishes - I just love fish with Thai sauces and spice, so it's where I typically gravitate. We started with crispy spring rolls and tempura veggies. They do tempura pretty well here and it's an art to get it right. 

I ordered the crispy tilapia which promised a mix of 3 special Thai sauces & lots of veggies with #6 heat. The sauce was more of a thick rub & the veggies were stuck in the rub but the fish was indeed crispy. It tasted really good but there was no sauce for my rice and one of the things I really appreciate most with Thai food is the sauce. Fortunately, hubby shared ladles of his red curry sauce to help me out.

Admittedly I compare every Thai restaurant in Pittsburgh to Nicky's Thai on the Northside which I consider pretty darned perfect. Pusadee's atmosphere is very appealing and I happily enjoyed their food, I've just had better."}
{"text":"I really love the atmosphere of this place, it has amazing out door seating, and the service is great and attentive. The place is BYOB and barely charge anything for uncorking/glasses.

However, I am a bit disappointed with their menu as a lot of the classics that I have come to love in thai restaurants are not here. I will say that their pad thai and green curry dish are amazing. Everything seems very fresh and well prepared.

I also enjoyed the grilled steak salad, but don't orderd it too spicy, it will blow you away! 

I was disappointed with their selection of soups, and the taste is not great either. However, I have already been here twice and look forward to coming back.... well in the summers, I don't know if this place would be as good if I had sat indoors."}
{"text":"I didn't get to eat in the garden and I know that's the big seller. Unfortunately, it was unseasonably cold last weekend and we were stuck inside. The indoor area is small, but very cute. The restaurant is definitely in a great location in Lawrenceville! 

I ordered an appetizer of the Thai fresh spring rolls with sweet basil sauce. Loved the sauce and it was a really light refreshing app. For our meals we had Street Noodles #1 and my brother had the Fried Rice with Chicken. I love spicy food. I've literally won t-shirts for eating hot wings. We ordered 5's thinking that would be a mild heat. 5 is hot as h-e-l-l. We found out that 4 is actually the middle on their heat scale... (??). Wouldn't recommend 5 or higher to anyone who doesn't LOVE hot stuff and know that's not the actual middle of their scale.

I'd go back to eat in the garden."}
{"text":"Pusadee's is a lovely spot with friendly staff.  The outdoor seating is absolutely gorgeous.  But the food is very hit-or-miss.  And it's overpriced!

My most recent order, the Kao Soi, left me super disappointed.  For $12.50, I got a moderately portioned, relatively bland dish that was mostly noodles (with a few sad pickled vegetables and soggy beef).  The crispy noodles that go on top looked like they'd come out of a box, not freshly fried.  Maybe I have just been spoiled by Noodlehead, where for $9 you can get a 50% larger portion of the same dish that tastes way, way better.

The only dishes I really like here are the pumpkin curry and street noodles with chicken.  But even those are overpriced!  If I pay $13 for curry, it'd better be a large portion and tasty as hell.  I have also had some extremely bad experiences here in the past, like curries that came out so salty they were practically inedible, but I kept giving this place a chance because I want to love it and to sit and eat in that garden!  But at this point, sadly, even the beautiful outdoor atmosphere is usually not worth it to me."}
{"text":"Ambiance outside on a late summer night is DREAMY! 

Outside patio is like a hidden, beautifully lit garden in the further end of Lawrenceville. Seats inside as well, but definitely not as many as outside. When I went, no one was inside was eating inside haha. 

Service is on top of things, nothing bad to say here! Everyone seems to know each other well - fam owned? 

Food is pretty good, but not amazing. I prefer other places (Nicky's Thai Kitchen, Silk Elephant) for Thai food. I had the Massaman curry, which was good, but I would try something else next time. So one star off for that. 

Honestly, I would still come here just for the ambiance!"}
{"text":"This was a great experience. Sitting outside you are next to their herb garden where they get the ingredients that they use in their dishes. It's a really nice place and the food is delicious. It's a bit pricey though and the portions could be slightly bigger (for the price)."}
{"text":"Best coconut curry I've ever had! My boyfriend and I frequent this place at least once a week (and sometimes more) we usually do take-out but service was always excellent when we did eat in the actual restaurant. My boyfriend swears by the Thai fried chicken and always orders the street noodle #1 dish. I've had it a few times and the chicken is delicious and unique. It's a little pricey but completely worth it.  The outdoor patio is breathtaking and a perfect date night spot."}
{"text":"Overall, I think Pusadee's Garden is just \"ok\".  A lot of people I know absolutely love the place, but I honestly didn't think it was that spectacular.  The service itself was so-so as we waited a LONG time to get our order taken and to get our food not to mention waiting to get our water refills. 

Aside from being a bit overpriced in my book, my dish was way too sweet even though it was supposed to be spicy.  My PIC (Partner In Cuisine) liked his curry and our companion loved her meal so maybe I'm wrong...Perhaps I just got the wrong dish.  I suppose it is worth another try sometime in the future."}
{"text":"The food was tasty but the portion is really really small. I'm surprised that not many yelpers have commented on it. You get 2x amount of food at any other Thai restaurant. Any Asian knows how cheap rice noodle is so I must say this place is way overpriced."}
{"text":"We were excited to try this place - we love outdoor dining and the garden sounded lovely.  We were blown away - the garden is amazing!  We had a great table for 2 off to the side, away from the other tables.  We felt like we had the patio to ourselves.  The landscaping is gorgeous and the food was delicious. We started with the crispy crab rolls and the crispy spring rolls. I had the pineapple curry with chicken and asked for pretty much a 0 spice level - it still had a little kick to it but was delicious.  My boyfriend had the pad thai with chicken and asked for a level 6 spice - his was very good but was spicier than he anticipated.  Overall, we really enjoyed the atmosphere, the food and the BYOB - we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Service was perfect, food was spectacular, atmosphere is awesome, and I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I have always been really happy with the food here. We have dined in and ordered takeout both worked out well. The real gem is the patio space; dining under the pergola during the growing season. This outdoor space is very charming. It is great for a romantic date that won't break the bank or just chilling with a small group of friends. It's more expensive than noodlhead, but the quality is definitely there. Service has always been on par. I would be sad if this place ever closed."}
{"text":"Love this place. Always high quality dishes and great flavors. I usually get the noodle dishes either see yew or street noodles. Outside seating is nice, inside is not so spectacular"}
{"text":"Great outdoor setup, great food, great service, and BYOB! What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Stopped in the other evening with a party of three shortly after a rain storm blew through, and were seated in the beautiful garden area. My two dining companions had never been there before and thoroughly enjoyed the food. Fantastic as several times before!"}
{"text":"The outdoor seating area is beautiful!!! I would recommend trying to sit outside because it's a lovely experience. 

When we got there, we had already made reservations so we were seated quickly. 

We got the crispy spring rolls, the panang curry, and kee mao noodles. The spring rolls were pretty good, but you only get two. We also really enjoyed the kee mao. The curry was a little bland, and it comes with a little bit of rice. They didn't ask us about spice levels, and the food didn't end up being very spicy, which was a little disappointing."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The food was awesome, the prices were very reasonable, our server was extremely friendly, and the outdoor garden was perfect. Took my friend and her parents here even though they were suspicious of the location and they loved it. Will definitely return soon."}
{"text":"Never in my entire life have I been treated worst than poop at a restaurant.  I have been working extremely long hours lately and was looking for a late night place to eat after 9 pm.  I first found Pusadee and since they closed later on Friday and Saturday, I figured we could go there.  

To be sure we did not come at a bad time when the kitchen was closed, I called in and asked if they had seating and if I could order ahead to eat there upon arrival.  The lady said sure and took my order.  Upon arrival, the food was all in to-go containers in a plastic bag.  I was puzzled so I told the ladies there I specifically asked to eat there and called them before coming out of courtesy to ensure no issues.  A server there, looked to have goth style look with dark make-up gave me perhaps one of the dirtiest looks I have ever seen.  She actually stated to me that their restaurant is NOT A PUBLIC PLACE and I should have made reservations.  This idiotic conversation went back and forth for ten minutes before finally they said there is an empty table outside by the gate.  We went over there and sat down.  No one came by to provide any plates, silverware, water or napkins, etc.  In fact, no one bothered to even approach us at all that night.  We removed some crap off the table to start unpacking our to-go order.  Since we had nothing to eat with, I was forced to go to my car to get folks, napkins and bottles of water.  We cleaned up after ourselves and left, frustrated and pissed off as hell.

So, forgetting that incident a few days later... the better half wanted Thai so I figured we just will get take-out only from now on since they made a big stink about eating at their place.  I showed up and paid; as I was doing so, some dude (maybe the owner) straight up told me I did not tip 20% last time.  Again, emotions started stirring up when I asked him when this was.  To my surprise, he said that when we ate outside the other day we should have tipped the server a mandatory 20%.  WTF!!  They did not provide a damn thing and treated me like a third class citizen that day now scolding me for not tipping??!!  We were pretty much yelling back and forth about this subject and in disbelief I just told them I was sorry for ever visiting their restaurant.  This place is a joke and you cannot pay me to come back to this hellhole."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try Pusadees Garden after rave reviews from friends. Stopped in around 8PM on a Thursday evening, and stood and waited in the front for a few minutes before walking through to the back room to find someone to seat us. We were immediately asked if we had a reservation, which we did not. Immediately  I sensed that the employees were annoyed. I'm not sure why it mattered, as the restaurant was mostly empty. We wanted to sit outside but were advised that since we didn't have a reservation, there wasn't room for us there. After briefly stepping outside, however, I spotted more than a few free tables. Rude.

Our waitress seated us in the front room and poured us water as we swatted away a small swarm of gnats. She returned and brought us glasses for our crowler of beer ($1 charge per glass), and asked if we were ready to order. Um, no. we sat down less than 60 seconds ago. 

She came back about ten minutes later and we placed our order - Tom yum soup and the street noodle #1 for me, and tom yum soup and the pad kee mao for my boyfriend. Our waitress didn't bother to ask for our spice level which we both found strange - we eat Thai food pretty frequently and we like it spicy. 

Our food came out relatively quickly and it was mediocre - not a hint of spice, and the portions were small and unimpressive, especially for the price! There were also no condiments on our table, sriracha or otherwise, and none were offered. I immediately understood that this restaurant is most likely popular because of the pretty seating area outside. 

About 15 minutes after our food was served, our waitress came to our table again to drop off our check - and then she just stood there. I still had food on my plate and was clearly not finished. I looked up at her and she asked, \"You ready to pay now or do you need to sit for a little bit?\" I have never been rushed out of a restaurant before and I will never come back here.

Overall, service is zero stars. 

Food gets two stars because it was not bad, but not spiced at all, and definitely inauthentic/underwhelming.

Atmosphere was bland, and there were gnats and flies zipping around us the whole time we were there. If it were one or two I'd excuse it - but this was gross.

I will never come back here."}
{"text":"Absolute magic.

What more could you ask for than good food in a great atmosphere. The tofu green curry is awesome. It's my go to. The spring rolls, too, are great! My friend and I shared them and then each had a curry - our bellies were perfectly satisfied.

If ever you're having a down day - go here. It will make the whole day worth it. If ever you're having a great day - go here. It will elevate it into pure bliss. The garden is amazing. I would pay to just go and sit in it, let alone eat a meal. It's completely trellised and well maintained. You are truly surrounded by plants/twinkle lights and it just gives you a zeal for life. Each breath feels so special. Great date spot, lunch spot, eat contentedly by yourself spot, really any day, any occasion spot.

Parking is really easy too since it's pretty far up Butler!

Do yourself a favor. Go! Now! What are you waiting for? Heaven awaits!"}
{"text":"What's not to like?  Beautiful garden seating!
Love that is BYOB, so bring along your favorite bottle.
We had a group and were told we had 2 hours to eat before the next group when we made the reservation.  That is good that it was communicated, but the group before us was 20 minutes late in leaving.  We were taken to a waiting area and asked and received some wine glasses so we could relax.  

We shared a few appetizers.  The golden bag were interesting, the grilled pork meatballs on a skewer came with some nice sauce to dip, and how can you go wrong with anything tempura so we had the tempura veggies.

I had the Spicy Duck Noodles at level 5, which was just about right.  I like spicy food but want to taste the food too. The duck was tender and the noodles and sauce were very good. SWMBO had the pad thai with shrimp that was very good and not as much a fan of spicy chose level 4.  I managed to get a bite and the shrimp was good but the spice level was higher than 4 probably closer to 7.  

PG has a great garden and good food.  Nice place for a relaxing meal."}
{"text":"First time at this place offered a great dinner.  Ordered the Garden Rolls and Tom Yum to start and had the Eggplant Basil.  All of these dishes were delicious. I will be back."}
{"text":"If you can treat my friend so horribly with your disgusting Behavior. Then I say no one should be coming here to have anything to eat with a 20% tip and you give dirty looks and you argue with the customer are you serious right now. If anything, we'll make sure that you close down because you're a very bad business does not care about customers. Shame on you"}
{"text":"Absolutely my favorite pad Thai! And their pumpkin curry! It's BYOB which scores extra points in my book. When outdoor seating is open it's the place to be; beautiful setting. Ask about the spice scale. I thought it was 1-10 and asked for a 6. For me it was too hot and even thought I wanted to take it home, they made me a fresh one that wasn't as spicy. If it's not busy they will start cleaning up and close early. But I feel there's usually someone hanging around lays, if anything give them a call."}
{"text":"In what used a be a shady corner in the dodgy end of Lawrenceville, now exists a miniature restaurant district, reminiscent of Bryant street in Highland Park.  On one side of the street you have Cure (my 2nd favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh) and Allegheny Wine Mixer (a really cool wine bar, one of the only ones in town).  Across the street is Pusadee's Garden, a Thai restaurant with a fantastic outdoor patio on the side completely hidden from the street.

The garden is really the restaurant's big draw.  There's a small indoor seating area but the majority of the seats are outside.  The outside area is split into two halves, with one half having small tables with umbrellas and the other underneath an ivy-covered trellis.

On a recent Saturday evening my wife and I were meeting another couple there for dinner and in typical Pittsburgh fashion, it was pouring down rain.  We called the restaurant to make certain our reservation was still OK and they said it was.  By an incredible stroke of luck, the sun came out right before we sat down.  Unfortunately, that meant that everything was covered with rainwater.  It also meant that during our entire dinner rain dripped on us, our food, and our wine.

The menu is standard Thai fare: curries, noodle dishes, and a few \"garden specialities.\"  We started off sharing crispy chicken spring rolls with plum sauce, chicken satay with peanut sauce and cucumber relish, and thai fried chicken with a sweet and spicy sriracha sauce.  It was all very tasty.  For entrees my wife had \"street noodle #1\", rice noodles with bean sprouts, bok choy, and more thai friend chicken.  I had a rice noodle dish with grilled duck breast, vegetables, and a spicy black soy sauce.  The duck was well done (not a way I normally like duck, but typical for an Asian restaurant) and the sauce had a nice spicy flavor.  Like many Thai restaurants, they ask you for a spice level of 1-10 for your dish.  I like spicy food so  I opted for a 6 and was glad that I did not venture higher.

Pusadee's Garden is BYOB only and everyone around us had a varity of wines and beers.  Corkage was inexpensive, only $1 per glass. Overall cost of dinner was very reasonable and added up to about $40 for 2 people.

Overall, we felt Pusadee's Garden was a good Thai restaurant.  The cuisine is standard Thai and honestly no better or worse than any other Thai restaurant that I've been to. There's nothing here that's going to push the envelope of Thai cuisine.  The BYOB option is nice and the garden is a very nice place to sit (when it's not raining).  

Why only 3-stars?  Well, according to Yelp, 3-stars = A-OK which is how I feel about Pusadee's Garden.  It's a standard Thai restaurant with a nice outdoor seating area.  It's not someplace I would ever specifically seek out, but it's a good option if you're in the mood for Thai and there's nice weather outside."}
{"text":"The food is always good and the staff are always attentive. What sets this place apart from the crowd is the outdoor seating. I'm looking forward to another summer with great outdoor meals with friends."}
{"text":"So I'm going to blame the fact that I haven't really come here on the other related fact that supposedly the patio was closed for awhile for renovations.

The patio is so pretty!! On a warm evening, you can sit among the garden patio, glowing with strings of lights, and enjoy the familiar noises of summer and conversation.

The food here is solid. I've had the crab fried rice -- pretty good but even if you ask for a 10 on spiciness, it seems to only come out to like a 2. I've also tried the street noodle #1, when I had it the spices were unique and delicious -- would definitely get this again!

All in all, a cute place for a chill night out. Love the ambiance and the food and will be back, hopefully before it gets too cold to sit at the patio again!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal food. Have tried several of their noodle and rice dishes and all have been great. Great for take out also..Will definitely return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying that our meal was among the best Thai food in Pittsburgh. We started with shrimp tempura and steamed pork dumplings - both of which I could have easily just eaten a whole plate full! 

For our entrees, I had the spare ribs; and, my husband had the crispy tilapia. Pusadee's warns that they are a whole two points higher on the heat scale than comparable restaurants in the area but I'd say my \"8\" was only slightly spicier than I expected. The black pepper and garlic, soy-marinated ribs fell off the bones. My husband's fish was the perfect balance between lightly fried and crispy and delicately spicy as well, with a nice touch of kafir to offset the curry flavors. We both had expertly steamed rice and fresh veggies on the side.

With the Allegheny Wine Mixer and Full Pint Brewing just across the street, I recommend going to Pusadee's for the food and walking a few feet afterwards for a glass of wine or pint of beer. Otherwise, don't forget to BYOB.

Overall, the fast service, intimate decor, delicious food, and very reasonable prices were a welcome backdrop for our date night. I definitely plan to go back in the spring/summer/fall when I can sit in the outdoor area."}
{"text":"Love this place, especially the outside dining area its so nice with a lot of follage around and it has some cover.   Recommend reservations they get booked outside when weather is nice. My favorite meal is called Street Noodle 1,  Its BYOB"}
{"text":"I tried to reserve the outdoor garden for a birthday party and was told they do not do large parties because they are afraid it compromises their ability to deliver quality food. I tried to offer solutions like a limited or chef suggested party menu, but to no avail. When you have a great outdoor location, a reputation for great food, why in the hell would you turn away a large party? I'd even pay extra to rent the space!  So this one star is not reflective of the food because I've never eaten there, and now, probably won't. The one star is for really stupid business practices of turning away a very flexible, easy to please crowd of Thai food loving Pittsburghers. Hope to have better luck with the other Thai restaurant with an outdoor garden."}
{"text":"The outdoor seating area is very trendy with a pergola and tons of plants and vines all over the place. Went here on a Thursday a little after 7 and the timing was perfect. The outdoor seating area was packed by 8, so you may need a reservation if you're gonna head out any later than that. 

We had the creamy coconut milk soup. I got it with vegetables and my sister got it with chicken. I loved the vegetable version, but my sister thought hers would have been better with some of the vegetables added. The spring rolls were very good. 

For entrees, I got the pad Thai w/tofu and she got the green curry with shrimp. We both got a level 8 spice (on a scale of 1 to 10) and both of us kind of regretted choosing the high amount of spice. We both loved the taste of our entrees and wished we had chosen a level 5 or 6 spice level so we could enjoy the food without coughing. Lol

The servers were very attentive and refilled the water frequently. It's a byob, and most tables had a few bottles of wine. Will definitely bring booze next time!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh! If you can, eat outside; the garden decorations outside make for perfect ambiance. Not to mention, all the food is absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"First time to Pusadee's Garden and, I must say, it was absolutely amazing! We sat in their magical garden patio that's filled with all types of greens -- ferns, winding ivy, shading pine trees and much more! Coupled with the absolutely gorgeous and perfect summer-time ambiance is their delicious and quite authentic Thai food. Dishes like spicy basil chicken, Pad Thai, and all sorts of curries can be seen on neighboring tables. Every dish we had, from the crispy tofu appetizer to the yellow curry with roti cani, was delectable and rich with its own hallmark spices and flavors! While seemingly ordinary, Pusadee's Garden is surely a thing but. I will definitely be returning for more!"}
{"text":"OMG just spent $60 on the worst Thai I have ever had. Will never Leave Bloomfield  again.
Pad Thai and Penang Curry just water with vegetables. Serving size for 3 year old children. Just wasted gas and time. Actually just threw most of it away,concerned. Just read other reviews I dont understand what happened to us but I will not go there again."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place but I was just not impressed. I ordered spring rolls and the drunken noodles and my friend ordered the pumpkin curry. The vegetable spring rolls were pretty good,
But nothing spectacular. The noodles came out dry, bland, and tasted as if they were left out for a day under a warming light. The pumpkin curry was tasty but nothing I would go back for. Really disappointed"}
{"text":"I love this place! I was glad we made a reservation because it's on the smaller side and it is pretty poplar. When we got there we were greeted and taken to their outdoor paradise. It's true folks, their outdoor garden dining area make you feel like you some where no where near Butler Street! 
I had their shrimp pad Thai and it was my favorite. It was a great portion and was full of flavor. I appreciate that they will ask how much heat you'd like as well, as I'm someone that doesn't like things too spicy. The service was a bit slow, but it didn't stop us from enjoying ourselves. It also helps that is is BYOB so we weren't waiting for drinks. I cannot wait to go back because as of now, it's my favorite Asian restaurant around!"}
{"text":"Pusadee's is one of those places that I go to fairly often, but somehow have never gotten around to reviewing. It's definitely worth a visit if you enjoy Thai, especially in the warmer months when the garden is open. It's lush, green, and beautiful--you'll find yourself forgetting that you are sitting right off of busy Butler Street. If the garden is full or the weather is less than ideal, then the intimate dining room is also a great option. 

I rarely deviate from my go-to entree, the garlic sauce with chicken. Chicken and a variety of vegetables are served in an amazingly flavorful sauce of (obviously) garlic and spices. I order my dishes on the spicy side, which only amplifies the flavor of the sauce and I definitely recommend (if you can handle the spice!). Served with white rice, it's a filling and flavorful dish.

I've also sampled a number of friends' dishes over the years, and everything has been superb. Definitely a great spot for a date or a gathering of some friends with a bottle (or several) of wine--don't forget, it's BYOB!"}
{"text":"Pusadee's Garden is a diamond in the rough!  Their quaint, garden courtyard is the perfect place to dine on a spring/summer/fall night.  We were seated off to one side of the garden that had greenery separating us from the other tables, so it felt like our own private space.  We enjoyed the pork dumplings, garden rolls, spicy duck noodles and the pumpkin curry.  Everything was delicious, fresh and on point!  The portions were a decent size but not enormous.  

Note: They are BYOB, so arrive prepared."}
{"text":"This spot is so pretty and lush. I felt like I was eating dinner in a tropical garden. I ordered the Basil Eggplant, which was delicious, not overwhelmed with sauce, and appropriately spiced for a level 8. The waitress who served us is very friendly and lightening quick, and the prices are moderate, maybe a dollar or two more than your average Thai restaurant. The beautiful and relaxed atmosphere is well worth the extra dough."}
{"text":"BYOB! Wished I woulda known before I got there, oh well. Great food if a little pricey for Thai. Great ambiance with tea lights lining the wall."}
{"text":"Thai is one of those cuisines that I don't think I could get tired of if I wanted to.  Even bad Thai is still pretty decent, but luckily Pusadee's Garden has great Thai with a beeline focus on the food.  

The decor inside here will not blow you away.  Pretty sterile, but the patio looked really nice.  Unfortunately the weather was not cooperating so we stayed inside.  
We had a spring roll, curry, and a basil sauce.  Everything was freshly prepared, as it did not have that \"sat out\" taste, not was the curry even slightly separated.  It was full on holy-crap-why-haven't-I-been-here-before good.  

If you want Thai, and the weather is nice, check this place out.  Your get a great meal with good portions."}
{"text":"What can I say that hasn't already been said? If you get to reading my review, I'm jumping on the PG bandwagon! For the longest time, I thought this was an Indian restaurant for no other reason than the name sounded Indian. Whoops!

After Ms. Pittsburgh Yelp Community Manager was on the KDKA morning show talking about the city's best patio spots, I decided to take a look at the menu. I had always been pining to try PG because their patio looks so inviting. I was pleasantly surprised to see more than just your typical Thai dishes. I was also intrigued that they had a couple noodle dishes that sounded similar to what my beloved Noodlehead has. I immediately added PG to my Yelp! Bookmarks and started planning out when I could get my rump over there and drift away in their fabulous garden.

I hadn't had good Tom Yum soup since I lived in Philadelphia, that is, unitl I tried PG's! The lemongrass broth was perfectly spicy with the perfect blend of carrots, mushrooms, zucchini, and broccoli. Heavenly! I had ordered the vegetable version, but they also offer chicken, tofu, and shrimp. 

I ordered the Pumpkin Curry on the rave reviews of my fellow Yelpers and it was the perfect choice! Based on the menu description, I don't think they use pumpkin per se, but a similar squash. Nevertheless, it was delicious. Very similar to a yellow or Masamun curry in flavor and spice level. I was also happy that the chicken version came with a nice medley of veggies. 

I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've had in Pittsburgh.  Actually the best Thai food I've had anywhere.  Really good food, reasonable price.  I would recommend making reservations outdoors in nice weather.  The inside seating appeared to be cramped, loud, and a smelled of BO, though that was likely a particular patron.

Try the Street Noodles -- YUM.  Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"No one is lying when they say the outdoor area is incredible... because it is! If you entered through the back, you'd never know that busy Butler Street is right in front of you. But since you enter from the front... it tricks you into thinking you're in some sort of garden utopia because the trees and ivy are so thick. 

So if you boast such a wonderful garden in the summer... what do you do in the winter? You make awesome food so people come back! I'm one of those people that can sometimes end up going to ethnic restaurants and ordering the same thing over and over. I know, super lame. But I get scurred! Considering the couple we were with raved about the street noodles, I went out of my pad thai/curry comfort zone.

I have to admit, I've only had street noodles once at Noodlehead in Shadyside and these were way more flavorful! I ordered up Street Noodles 2 with rice noodles and fried shrimp. I could tell right away it was way more filled with more zesty ingrediants. Competition's on the horizon Noodlehead! 

I like that it's BYOB, so you can bring your fave bottle with you. I will say, the dish isn't large, but just right. Let's just say, I was satisfied, but definitely ready for dessert later! But isn't that kinda the best of both worlds?"}
{"text":"I've been in restaurants where it's all ambiance, but serve terribly overcooked frozen food (::cough Mt. Washington cough::). And I've been in restaurants that have absolutely no atmosphere, but serve the most amazing food ever (like Udipi). But Pusadee's comes somewhere right in the middle, with great ambiance, decent food, and fast service. Though there is arguably better Thai food in the area, no other Thai restaurant comes with transplanting you into a tropical garden, with also top notch and friendly service.

Reservations are recommended, as everyone wants to sit in the garden, and tables fill up fast. Upon making reservations, we were also politely told that the next reservations for our tables started two hours later (a little tongue-in-cheek nudge not to rudely \"camp out\" at the table when done with dinner. And as a former waitress, I giggled and appreciated the tip to GTFO and respect others' reservation times.) 

There are a lot of great options for veg-heads. We started with Crispy Spring Rolls and Curry Puffs - both which were super crispy and flavorful. My husband had the Tofu Kee Mao - which had a nice heat to it. And I had the Tofu Cashew rice dish, which was pleasant, and the perfect amount of food. For dessert we shared the Mango Sticky Rice. It was ... interesting ... but I also didn't know what to expect. It's warm and sweet, with a texture that I'm not sure how to describe...but the flavor is really delightful. I'm just weird with textures.

BYOB & Bring Your Own Dessert is also available for $1/person. 

The garden is absolutely stunning. It felt like sitting in Blue Heaven in Key West - sans the random wild chickens running around. All of the trees...the hanging plants...the flowers...the string lights...creates such a wonderfully romantic and tropical feeling environment. This alone is worth it. Even with the Sun still blaring outside, all of the trees and leaves still offered more than enough coverage, yet there were still umbrellas to offer more cool shade. I would come here once every season just to experience how different it looks. 

Overall, it was a pleasant experience and we'll probably return for the Fall to see it when the leaves change."}
{"text":"This restaurant has the best outdoor seating in town! I haven't eaten here since last fall but only because it would be disappointing if I couldn't sit on the patio. The food is great, as well as the service.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This is officially my favorite Thai place in Pittsburgh - I can't believe it has taken me this long to write a review! Their menu is original, and there is not a bad item on it. Choosing an appetizer is a very tough decision, but my favorites are the Garden Rolls and the Curry Puffs. The entrees are also great - you cannot go wrong with any of the curries, and I also LOVE the Kao Soi. On my last visit, I also tried the coconut ice cream for the first time, and I must say - I didn't know what I was missing! I am not even a huge coconut fan, but this ice cream is to-die-for.

They grow a lot (if not all) of their veggies in a garden behind the restaurant, and their patio is a unique getaway that makes you forget you are in Pittsburgh. It would be a great place for dates, as the patio could be quite romantic and it is BYOB (only $1 per person even if you bring multiple bottles!)."}
{"text":"I love this place. Between this and the Smiling Banana Leaf, Pittsburghers can get the best Thai in the city. What this has that the SBL doesn't have is a gorgeous outside dining space. That alone is certain to make either a good date even better or a bad date tolerable. It's BYOB. Not sure if they have a corkage fee."}
{"text":"I tried out Pusadee's after stumbling around Chowhound one day looking for new restaurants to try out.

Since we had no idea what to order, we asked the server for recommendations.  He suggested their pork meatballs as an appetizer and said it's all about the special noodles and fish.  Most people end up getting their Street Noodle #1.

We ended up getting their pork meatballs, which were absolutely delicious.  I want to say the meat was minced by hand with a tad of baking soda for it to achieve such a fine texture which remind me of the meatballs at Chinese dimsum places.  The seasoning was right on spot; I've had too many under/over-seasoned meatballs to take small things as the proper amount of seasoning for granted.  They come skewered on sugarcane which added to the presentation and were fun to suck on while we waited for our entrees.

I asked Pusadee what her favorite dish was, as opposed to the most popular dish.  She first noted that I might not like it b/c it's spicy but told me it was the spicy tilapia.  I love spicy, and I ordered it.  My friend ordered their Street Noodle #1.

The spicy tilapia dish was a lot larger than I had imagined; it was five pieces of fried crispy tilapia with a copious amount of the spicy sauce.  The sauce itself wasn't that spicy, but it had lots of strong Thai flavors with a sweet touch from caramelized onions.

I tried some of the Street Noodle #1 and it was pretty good.  The thinly sliced crispy chicken wasn't as crispy as I would have imagined, but all the flavors were spot on.

Some finishing notes:

What I found interesting was that I didn't see ANYONE in the restaurant order curry at all.  And Pusadee and the waiter didn't recommend them either...
Get reservations.  It's a small restaurant and the first thing we were asked was if we had reservations.
Because it's a bit further away from the \"hot spots\" of Pittsburgh, parking was ridiculously easy.
If you want to try the tilapia, get a friend to order something else and split the two dishes.  It comes with no vegetables and Asian cuisine is all about splitting dishes anyways."}
{"text":"Gorgeous outdoor seating and fresh food. I've been several times and each visit leaves me wanting more. Courteous staff, extremely well priced, and an amazing pumpkin curry. Go."}
{"text":"The restaurant advertises that is open until 10pm...not true.  We drove all the way there, got there 15 minutes before closing time, and got refused entrance at the door.  Apparently the kitchen close at 9:30.  If that's the case, they should change all the signs at the front of the restaurant to reflect their actual closing time...9:30."}
{"text":"Beautiful, romantic atmosphere, great food and BYOB this place is a dream date spot. You will want patio seating so make a reservation. The spring rolls were nice and crispy, a great start to the meal especially when paired with the beautiful bite size bird nest's. We had the Panang  and the Pumpkin curry which were both excellent. I suggest a date night here with your love soon."}
{"text":"Pusadee's Garden provides good Thai food, as well as a nice dining experience. The main appeal for me was the outdoor garden patio, which was beautiful!  The food was also delicious! My boyfriend and I ordered the meatballs on a sugar cane skewer as an appetizer, and we had the Pad Thai and Pad See Ew. We didn't make reservations and had a half hour wait at 7:30 pm on a Wednesday. I suggest making a reservation!"}
{"text":"Be sure to make reservations before planning a dinner at this fabulous Thai restaurant. 

The pad Thai is the best I've ever had in Pittsburgh, and the service is cordial and quick! 

The indoor dining room is very loud. When it's nice outdoors, I recommend the garden."}
{"text":"Beautiful outside seating was the perfect setting for a post graduation lunch. Lots of colorful and exotic-looking plants lined the terrace from hanging planters and along the brick walking path. The facade is charmingly covered in vines.

Food came out quickly (within 10 minutes of ordering for a group of 8) and did not disappoint. While waiting, we all gawked at the other patrons' well-presented dishes. They have lots of beautiful and delicious drinks like Thai iced tea & coffee, and mango juice. Every dish looked incredible but I was especially happy about my chicken pad see yew. The appetizers were the best part, though, and I highly recommend the crab rolls and fried chicken. Both came with great sweet/spicy sauce pairings. The entree spice levela can be selected from 1-10. I think it is safe to say our entire group had a great meal here.

The bathrooms were immaculate and well kept. BYOB but there is a $1 per drink per person fee.

If I lived here I would probably come every week."}
{"text":"I had  tamarind fish, and also pad thai. The food wasn't bad, always nice service. My main complaint. They open and close when they want. Only reason why I haven't been back."}
{"text":"Had my first experience here last night. I ordered the garden rolls (very fresh tasting, but personally didn't like them), the curry puffs (which were almost like desert before dinner), and garlic sauce rice with chicken (which was absolutely delicious). 

The outside patio area was a dream. I was wishing that I could pack it all up and move it to my own backyard. There was no wait to eat on the weekday, but I can imagine it would be packed over the weekends. Our server was very attentive, as well as several others who came around frequently to refill our drinks."}
{"text":"Food was great and atmosphere equally enjoyable. Great service and BYOB is a plus. A definite must go. Not in my neighborhood but well worth the trip! Get the coconut ice cream"}
{"text":"Get there early & bring your own booze. It's BYOB (I believe there's a glass charge). You come here for yummy food but more so the ambiance outside. We got here later on a work night and waited twenty minutes to sit outside (no one sites inside when it is nice). I ordered my Pad Thai and love it. It's what you want to eat there, too. The wait staff took too long or they would've gotten 5 stars."}
{"text":"The setting is great. Sit out in the garden and relax and eat some decent Thai. Don't let them hurry you out the door! You are there for the ambience. Drink that shit in."}
