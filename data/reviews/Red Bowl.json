{"text":"Red Bowl is always a great choice.  It can get a little busy at times, but is worth the wait.  The generous portions will leave you full and the flavors will satisfy the pallet."}
{"text":"I had a terrible experience I place a to go order and was told it would take 30 minutes no problem it's Friday night I get it. 30 minutes go by then 40 then 50 minutes at this point the girl tells me my entire order was mixed into other people's orders and needs  to be redone and will take another 35 minutes. I cancel the order and walked out I will never go there again"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Five buck lunch special.  Chicken/broccoli/fried rice/spring roll/ice tea....whooowah."}
{"text":"Too sweet and too much batter. Hunan by the falls is much more authentic and offers options that aren't just fried chicken. Tried a few orders, nothing stood out or fulfilled our hankering for Chinese food (and our family ranges from paleo diets to full blown heavy fried food eaters). Will not be back."}
{"text":"Always have a great experience here. Food is great, staff is always nice. 

Would definitely recommend if you are in the area. They also have great deals on sushi. Sushi is always freash as well."}
{"text":"Great restaurant in the area.  Servers/staff are good people and the food is not truly authentic but its pretty good.  Nice environment as well for a good meal.  I recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"My husband and I go here frequently and really enjoy it. Although I wouldnt call the food a four or five star restaurant , it is consistently good with good service and good drinks. It is reasonably priced and they have never made a mistake on our order. For that reason, it has become a favorite."}
{"text":"SERVICE IS TERRIBLE!!!  We went there today (Sunday) for a late lunch. We were seated right away and given menus. A waiter never came over to us but we clearly were in this guys section because he waited on everyone around us. The manager was cleaning a chair at the table next to us and could see we still had not been acknowledged by wait staff. The waiter looked over at us again with a glare and took the check from the people at the table next to us, still not saying a word to us. After being ignored for so long we said \"lets go\".  BTW, we went right across the parking lot to Sushi 101. They were happy to accommodate us and our $125.00 tab!!    Your loss Johnny Red Bowl !!"}
{"text":"We've been back at least a dozen times over the past 6 months. Always good and fast! Order by phone ready in 20 minutes. We live close and it's easy Friday night option!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and great service on this trip. Yum!"}
{"text":"IF i could give this restaurant a ZERO, I would. It was our first time eating there and we will NEVER return! Starting with the greeter at the door who was not welcoming and never smiled to the food that had a terrible odor......NOTHING met our standards! We ordered shrimp fried rice and shrimp pad thai, two very \"safe\" meals, or so we thought! The Pad Thai had pink noodles.....1st strange point. The food immediately attracted flies. And most distrubing, the food smelled like a men's locker room. We searched for what the smell was, but could not put a finger on it. After less than 6 bites total, we asked for the check and left as quick as we could. Fresh Market for dinner tonight....NEVER again!"}
{"text":"Good wasn't very special. The yellowish lighting made the food look gross. We went on a night that was not crowded. They delivered our meal seconds after the appetizers. There was no room on the table so they took the appetizers away.  Not a good experience. Will not go back."}
{"text":"i usually get take out, its always really good!!! i love the ginger dressing and there sushi is awesone. i have dined in a few times, havent had a bad expirence yet!! oh and the miso soup is sooo goood!!!"}
{"text":"Best out there. Period....

Sushi - Best
Egg Rolls - Best
Food - Best
Lunch menu - omg Best and nicely priced
Dinner menu - Best

Service - Most of the staff are awesome....some can be w/e but you can get this anywhere

Cleanliness - Never had an issue with it being dirty

Parking - meh but I blame the dollar tree (or whatever that is) they squeezed in next door..."}
{"text":"No white meat chicken.  I agree that the staff is nice and so is the decor but they have to compete with another chain Chinese eatery in Ballantyne which is much better.  Plus this place is not cheap. Put in better quality ingredients rather than chicken mystery meat and I might go back.  Our entire table agreed we won't be back.  PS - I wrote another review and it was removed..."}
{"text":"Kind of a hit or miss place.  I am tired of these 3 in 1 Asian places.  Thai, Japanese, and Chinese...these kind of places aren't authentic and are not great at any of these. I rather have just a straight Thai place or something.

Alright, off my rant.  This place is nearby, so I have tried a lot of dishes and found what is actually good.

Their potstickers, pork lo mein (chicken one is bland for some reason), sweet and sour chicken, and egg rolls are good (the easy stuff).  The bourbon chicken was terrible and watery.  The pad thai is no where close to authentic. Singapore noodles are not authentic either, but still tastes really good. Large portions of every entree helps them with the star rating.

Overall, average.  Wish we had more choices in Fort Mill area and more authentic places.  Oh well!"}
{"text":"The only thing good here is the sushi, and I think they've completely stopped serving it. They have a couple good appetizers-- Bang Bang Shrimp, spring rolls, egg rolls. The food is kinda where you get screwed. I've heard that the lo mien is the only thing that's edible. I've had orange, sweet and sour, and general tso chicken and it's all gross. Not crunchy, dark meat, dry and chewy, just bad. When they start serving sushi again, I'll go but until then, I'll wait."}
{"text":"Great food an very intentive service!  We were never disappointed!  Congrats and keep up what you're doing!"}
{"text":"Get a Bento Box! They are fantastic. Excellent affordable Asian fusion. Also, if you like tea, they give you a cast iron pot full of it!!!"}
{"text":"The food isn't the greatest, unfortunately. I've been to this particular location twice. The food during my first visit was just okay and during the second visit it wasn't very good. I don't plan on returning for a 3rd visit."}
{"text":"I come here for lunch.
A little expensive but worth it.

I order fried rice, it's really delicious and \"Chinese style\".

Waiter is nice. And they just open, not too many people during lunch. It's a good place to enjoy your meal.
Highly recommended.
Five star."}
{"text":"On a recent trip to Charlotte we stopped in to eat lunch at Johnny's Red Bowl.  My wife had the General Tso lunch special with an egg roll and fried rice.  The chicken was crispy but lacked flavor.   The egg roll was bland.  I had the Sesame Chicken with white rice and spring roll. The sesame chicken was mushy and had very few sesame seeds on it.  The spring roll was crispy and pretty good. Another positive is that the portions were generous, however large amounts of mediocre food isn't a good thing.."}
{"text":"Went for the first time today. Very nice new restaurant to have in the neighborhood. My family will definitely return. Simple Chinese dishes as expected but they even have some thai-inspired dishes. I had a red curry which was great. Red Bowl is vegetarian friendly and the wait staff was able to accommodate by switching a dish that was only listed with meat to veggies and tofu."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. Service was not good. We were left wondering where to go while 5 employees sat around and laughed. Finally seated and realize there is christian music and preaching on the radio. I didnt come to be preached at just to eat my food. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Every time I'm in the area, I eat here! This is the place for lunch dates with friends, lunch after church on Sundays, and in the years it's been here, the place we went before prom, and the place my husband and I came for many a date while courting in college. :) It makes me happy...

I don't really like Chinese food, haha, so I can't really judge the entrees for you. But despite all the food I have tried across several states, the are no egg rolls and accompanying sauces or ginger dressing for the salads to compare!!! The sushi is pretty good (not the best I've had, but more towards the top of the list than the bottom).  My husband longs for the orange chicken and General Tso chicken while we're out of state.  I usually order curry, the Mongolian-style stir-fry, or a bento box and I've never been disappointed. YUM!"}
{"text":"Delicious fusion Asian food! We were served by James and he made our family dining experience very enjoyable!!"}
{"text":"Service was terrible here. When we got here, we went and placed our food as usual. But then once we got our food, a few minutes later as we were eating the waitress asked us if we needed some to-go boxes. Also we asked for some spoons to be able to share as a family but then the waitress was very hesitant and back talked towards us. She was like \"the kitchen doesn't have any spoons inside, all is wrapped in the towels.\" Throughout our meals our waitress never asked us \"is everything okay\" or \"do you need some more water.\" They never asked us these questions like what other restaurants do."}
{"text":"Giving three stars comparing it to the other one off Providence road. Sushi is good and equal to the other one however the other dishes are no match to the one on Providence. 
Wait staff is good and takes care of your needs.  The manager walks around looking at everyone however doesn't do anything which can be a bit annoying especially if no one is in the restaurant. 
Overall an OK spot to stop in an eat in a pinch but if you can make the drive to Providence road go for it."}
{"text":"Flies. Flies. Flies. They're everywhere. Order came out wrong not once, not twice, but three times.  More expensive than Sushi 101 and 18 Asian & Sushi Bar. Even with a bit more variety in their roll selection, it is not worth our time or money.  You're definitely better off at Sushi 101 as its in the same plaza."}
{"text":"Food is delicious.

Servers seem discombobulated and have no sense of time. A child's order at the table was lost, and the server never came to check on us to fill up out water and iced tea drinks.

Sushi and rolls were delicious, but when you are there when only 3 other tables are there on a Friday evening, why does 4 pieces of sushi take 15 minutes?"}
{"text":"Really.  My daughter wanted beef with broccoli, not chicken, said to them, charge me for the beef it's fine.  They said no, really.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"I love stopping in here they are always friendly even when you stop in for a bit 15 minutes before closing. Which I due often for some late night sushi rolls and a beer or date night with the wife once the kids go to bed. Lol"}
{"text":"The food is ok but definitely not great! My husband and I have been there often, and I've noticed a decline in the quality of the food. Someone has to teach these people how to make fried rice!"}
{"text":"I heard Jimmy Malone of WMJI talking about Solon's best new Chinese Restaurant. Now been there twice. Awsome food, gorgeous presentation, excellent caring service by a staff too young to vote, and food fresher than I've tasted in Solon FOREVER. 

Beautiful inside too! Lived in Solon for years, and Imperial Wok has plunged downhill for years, with its stale shrimp chips, lukewarm wonton/MSG soup, re-re-reheated fried rice, fortune cookies packed in the 1990's,  and hot and sour soup that tastes canned in comparison.

Try Red Bowl and you'll never patronize Imperial Schlock again. It's a culinary oasis for Solonites, where good dining is as rare as winning Browns seasons. 

Can't wait to go there again next week."}
{"text":"We love this place and for the most part, it's excellent.  We have had a few misses but they were minor.  Such as thai tea or basil shrimp roll.  But the rest of the items we order are well made and very tasty.  And even the side items like the spring rolls or dumplings, all are excellent.  I also love their dipping sauces, all flavorful and not watered down like most places.  I gave it 5 stars as they are consistent in their quality over the last 4 years I have ordered from them."}
{"text":"Great place to grab your favorite Asian dishes. ..wonton soup egg roll and red curry today...perfect!  And fast...great staff...great place...Thank you for great experience :)"}
{"text":"Very good food and great service. Went in today and they got my order wrong which isn't a big deal to me and the I decided I wanted to get a drink to go and she gave it to me on the house! Great customer service! Not to mention great food and their sushi is very good and up there in quality! I am picky about sushi and like it to be good quality."}
{"text":"I go to Red Bowl for 1/2 off sushi after 8. At first that thought scared me a little but it's actually a great deal - if you can wait that late to eat. I love the Out Of Control Roll - for $7 (at 1/2 off) I can barely finish it. You have to order a drink in order to get 1/2 off, but in general the $2-3 you'll make back in food savings."}
{"text":"It's just OK. Service was good, but food was fair. Pork fried rice was good enough as was the Won Ton soup. We got egg rolls that were substandard... Not crispy, filling was mushy and had a Campbell soup taste. Brown rice with an entree costs an extra $1. That doesn't leave a good feeling."}
{"text":"Had lunch here with my wife and son this week.  Initially, there was A bit of a communication issue with the order, but everything got worked out correctly and we got what we ordered.  Our food was pretty good, if not a tad less spicy than I'd prefer.  I had kung pao chicken and my son had general tso's chicken.  Thankfully, the general tso's was not just blobs of breading around minuscule pieces of chicken which seems to be too common for that dish.  My wife had Szechwan shrimp which was probably the best of the bunch."}
{"text":"We were long time customers, mostly due to the fact that this is the only place in town.  But the last two times that we were here, the service was awful when they messed up our order twice. Won't be back."}
{"text":"I've had take-out from Red Bowl several times and while the food is nothing special, it does the trick if you're just having a hankering for mediocre Chinese food.

Where I have an issue is how Red Bowl handled a recent experience. I ordered take-out and brought the food home. Once while eating my meal, I bit down on something that was clearly not food (it was hard, so thinking a tiny rock or bit of plastic?). As I more closely examined my meal, there were other black hard \"things\" in my meal. Naturally, I was turned off from my meal and stopped eating it. Plus, my tooth hurt from when I bit down on whatever hard object it was. My husband did the same with his meal just because the whole experience left us questioning the safety of the food we were eating.

I brought the food back to the restaurant and explained what had happened. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to speak directly with a manager, but after explaining to the person working there what had happened, she got the manager on the phone. She initially offered to cook me some new food and I explained I was sort of turned off from eating from there and that I would just like a refund. Where I have a problem is how the situation was handled. Rather than apologizing, the woman working there proceeds to examine the food (I'm thinking to better understand what the foreign objects in the food may have been). I had even collected a few of these \"objects\" and put them into a small container for the restaurant to more easily examine what they might be. Nope. She was trying to measure how much food I had already consumed so only that percentage could be refunded. She explained that there was still food left in the containers, so she wouldn't be able to refund the full amount. I asked her if there was any concern on their end that they had  just served food that contained foreign objects in it and she just sort of chuckled (I'm guessing out of nervousness). 

I told her I would come back when the manager was present so I could speak directly with him about my concern. I left to return to my car and she came out to the parking lot and asked me to return inside. She eventually refunded my money, but I am concerned with the ethics behind how this restaurant operates."}
{"text":"My husband and I come here whenever we need a quick meal and I have yet to be disappointed. We have probably been here a total of 10 times at least; a few times with other couples but mainly just the two of us. The ambiance is why I fell in love with this place. It is so clean and open with beautiful woods and reds- it is inviting and homey. The menu is insanely diverse although I usually stick with the Spicy Thai Basil Chicken or Spicy Tangerine.  My husband loves the Sushi and no longer has to drive to Ru San's for his fix.

The service has never been less than awesome. Never hesitate to customize an order as they are never hesitant to customize it for you. As long as you know what to expect- not quite a Benihana but definitely superior to Panda Express, I think you might be pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Saved us from a Sunday night of frozen pizza! It was 9 o'clock and our options for dinner were rapidly diminishing when the Red Bowl Asian Bistro popped up on my android restaurant finder. They were open til 10 so the decision was made. Our initial greeting by what looked to be the owner of all ppl was not one of excitement  or even welcome....but the service was friendly which I suppose is what matters. We had sushi to start with, because I am a weenie eater when it comes to sushi we had a California roll, which let's face it is hard to make wrong, and a Dragon roll, which was a hit with the rest of the table.  Our table ordered the Broccoli Beef and the Cashew Chicken both of which got middle of the road responses (we didn't take these leftovers home, which speaks volumes), we also had a simple Chicken Lo Mein which was delish (with the addition of some soy sauce) and the Spicy Thai Basil Chicken that was unique and very fresh.  Another big plus were the portion sizes, we all ordered individual dishes, but there was plenty to share, which is half the fun of dining out right?  

On another note, they don't serve alcohol on Sundays (sniffle), but if you bring in your church bulletin, you get a free soda (hmmmm....).

Even though half of the dishes failed to rock my world, the fact that the ingredients were fresh leads me to believe that after some investigation to weed out weak dishes, you'll be left with some pretty delicious Asian options when the mood strikes!"}
{"text":"Been here twice and Ehh, not impressed. Waiter was nice food was quick, but not impressed with the flavor, the food was bland. Fried Rice was ok but it seemed like it was warmed up and not fresh. One thing that did bug me is that the place was empty and they sat us near the kitchen were the wait staff gathered and we got to hear all the gossip for the day."}
{"text":"Nice environment and the mgmt/staff gives it a good go, but the food is not worth your time.

The \"Chinese-Thai-Vietnamese-Hibachi\" sign on the front door is the warning sign it sounds like.

The old rule of thumb about looking at the people in the seats is true again here: you won't see this restaurant teeming with people of Asian ancestry, and there is a purely culinary reason for that.  

There are so many better asian options around town ... we won't be trying this one again."}
{"text":"We have tried many Sushi restaurants in the area and this is by far our favorite. The owner and staff are super friendly and Larry, the bar tender \"knows everyone by their name\".  It has become our neighborhood bar and grill (and sushi restaurant)!
Lunch specials are unbeatable (where can you get a complete meal for $5 to $6) and Sushi (especially at the bar after 8pm) is also one of the best deals around.
Highly recommended, if you want great sushi at a great price."}
{"text":"I've had some pretty bad food but wow...stopped by fresh market and decided to get some \"Thai\" for dinner. We ordered the chicken pad Thai and spicy mango chicken. Wow. Wish we didn't wait until getting this home to open it up. The mango chicken was stark white with fresh veggies. The sauce was good but the meat tasted weird. Whatever they put on the pad Thai made the noodles a pink ish color. I've never seen pink pad Thai. I think even I could have attempted and completed these items more successfully. A waste of money.... Stay away. Now I know why the restaurant was empty."}
{"text":"Note: this review is solely for their lunch. 

I've passed Red Bowl several times, but was always on my way somewhere, and never had a chance to try it out.  What convinced me was the giant sign outside that read \"$5 Lunch Specials\". 

(Obviously I was on to something, because over the course of 5 minutes, I saw at least 3 people come in just for take-out lunch.)

 For 5 bucks, you get an entree with white or brown rice, an egg or spring roll and an iced tea.  5 bucks!  That's cheaper than going to Panda Express. (Just remember there are only 4 or 5 options for the special.) 

I got the chicken and broccoli with brown rice, and was surprised to find it surprisingly satisfying.  It's the typical savory brown sauce found in many of those Americanized beef and broccoli dishes. 

Brown rice took up half the Styrofoam container, and the entree took up the other side.  This was a generous portion. 

The egg roll was typical as well, light, crispy deep fried.  However, the sauce that came with it was bizarre.  It looked like tahini...and has the consistency of tahini, but had a definite mayonnaise base flavor. 

This was a minor thing, and for 5 dollars ($5.40 with tax) I'm not compaining. (BTW: I learned this is a family owned business, based out of Carey, NC. The hostess says they're \"famous\" for this $5 lunch.)  Don't know if I'd ever go out of my way for Red Bowl, but if I'm ever in the area, and in need of a cheap, quick, lunch, I'm in."}
{"text":"A pretty good place for sushi, and an average place for other Asian dishes.  While Red Bowl can be wonderful at times, it can be lackluster because of its large array of Asian dishes.  Dishes range from Mongolian to Japanese to Thai to Chinese...etc.  It's sort of like lumping all Europeans together and letting Spaniards cook your schnitzel and kraut.  Red Bowl would better themselves by refining dishes they are strongly familiar with.  

I enjoy eating here, but why order overpriced Chinese food you could get at another Chinese restaurant?  Stick to something you can't get somewhere else.

Try:  The sushi

New to sushi:  Try tuna rolls

Pretend it's sushi:  Try the sweet potato rolls or Californian rolls"}
{"text":"The food is excellent and the presentation is great! The mango chicken is my favorite, and not many places know how to make it. The fried rice and egg rolls are very good, the place is clean and well lit. The decorations are in the Chinese restaurant type of ambiance (most all the Chinese restaurants are, and  not my style) but the service is excellent."}
{"text":"Terrible. Giving this place one star is generous. I hate to ever give a bad review but I'm hoping to save someone some money and bad food. Bland. Dry. Overpriced. Stay away! You are better off to buy a frozen Asian meal and microwave it"}
{"text":"Food is good. Singapore noodle is little lighter than expected. It would taste better if had little more curry."}
{"text":"Food was excellent. I would recommend the Bento bowls, that way you can try a meal and sushi for a cheaper price. Outdoor seating was superb as it was a covered patio, which is lovely for an evening dinner when it's warm outside."}
{"text":"My husband and I LOVE this place. Family owned, everyone is SO nice all the time and the food is always delivered on time and fresh as can be. It's never greasy which is amazing and I've never had non greasy Chinese food. there's literally nothing on the menu I don't like. I'm a recently converted vegetarian and switched from chicken general tap to tofu... AMAZING."}
{"text":"Best high quality Asian style food around Indian land forsure. Service is pretty good but food taste great. Its a little pricy so I mostly go for special events and such. Definitely recommended if looking for legit sushi too."}
{"text":"If you love salt this place is for you. Friendly staff but the cook was yelling at the staff for telling him he put to much salt in the food. Our waitress told us we were the second to complain"}
{"text":"Warning!  Specifically asked to ensure no peanut contamination. Was even noted on receipt by cashier.  Two bites into cashew chicken dinner and i went into anaphylatic shock.  Bad training and or bad food handling, either way, puts cutomers at risk.  For me it was peanuts, for you it may be something else.  Worth the risk?"}
{"text":"WOW - What a turn around (180) from last time. We decided to give it another try. Just goes to show staff can make or break a good dining experience.  Food was awesome and service to match. Gonna love my left overs tomorrow. 

Glad we have it another try. Just don't let them sit you with Shaggy from Scooby Doo. You will know who I'm talking about. Young slender tall guy with a bun on top. Talks with hippie slang duuuuude."}
{"text":"Hidden prices on \"specials\" 

Really small portions. 

Sushi was mediocre 

Really irritating radio blaring over the restaurant. Asked to change or turn down was told no. 

STAY AWAY!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place was gross. Spent way too much money for low quality food. My husband barely are his and they didn't even care."}
{"text":"Great place to get take out from. Never actually ate in the restaurant but we get take out a least once every two weeks. The food is good and the staff is friendly. They even remember me when I come in."}
{"text":"Our go-to place for Chinese food.  The Genral Tso's Chicken is wonderful as is everything else we've tried.  No disappointments!  Of particular note is the Orange Beef...simply delicious.  
Friendly staff."}
{"text":"This is a good place if your hungry and want a quick bite. I didn't enjoy my meal and ordered several items. The shrimp tempura appetizer was actually frozen panko breaded     shrimp and the sauce was not sweet but vinegary and the flavors didn't mesh. The sushi was ok. I ordered a salad and the lettuce was wilted and if you can't serve fresh iceberg lettuce I can't trust anything else you serve. 


The service was the best part of the Experiance. The owner should stop purchasing frozen items and start providing the chef with real food to work with. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"In the top 3 of the worst Chinese food I have ever had.  Not sure how this place received more than one star.

I got chicken cashew, which was not even edible. Not sure what kind of chicken they use, but it neither looked nor tasted like chicken.  The five cashews were ok, I guess.  And the brown rice was very poorly cooked.  Yes how does a Chinese restaurant mess up rice?  It looked like white rice that was colored in soy sauce or something similar.

Absolutely gross is the only way to describe it."}
{"text":"This place is a battle between love and hate.  The food is good, the service is slow.

I have had a wide sampling of their food and love the pad thai, chicken and brocoli, and even the sushi.  The problem is that it takes forever to get the food.  The most recent example was this evening.  It took an hour to get our food after being seated.  I could understand if the place was packed, but we were seated immediately. 

If you want to try the place, I suggest ordering takeout.  You get the great food without the hassle."}
{"text":"I was in Fort Mill and jonesing for some pad thai. My friend suggested Red Bowl since they have a variety of Asian cuisine. I stopped in to order take out and there were only two other tables in there. They told me it would be 5 minutes and brought out my order in less than that so that left me optimistic!

When I got home, the pad thai portion was huge! I'm talking probably enough for 3 servings but the flavor really didn't sing to me. It tasted good but nothing special so I had to add a bunch of sriracha and black pepper.  The food is definitely not authentic and unmemorable  but decent if you want a quick fix."}
{"text":"Great food (including sushi) great prices (always half priced wine).  First choice for Asian food."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here about 4 or 5 times in the last couple of months.  We mainly go for the sushi which has always been very good. I have also had the edamame, chicken satay and lettuce wraps that were good but was a little disappointed with the pad thai which didn't have much flavor.  We typically sit at the pub tables in the bar area and have always had great service."}
{"text":"SO INEXPENSIVE, AND SO KIND! The food they serve is authentic Chinese food, not some watered down American version. On top of that the food is soooooo cheap, you can go all the time. The employees are so nice, they give me a free bottle of Sprite. And it was a 2 liter bottle! If that is not a good reason to always get Chinese food from there, I don't know what is!"}
{"text":"The people where are so nice and the food so good. When ever I'm in the area i always get the basil Thai chicken and the shrimp thingies i don't know what are called) but they are so good, Many people don't know about this place and that's kinda disappointing. They have some of the best drinks and drink specials that have ever seen at a restaurant. The decor is cute and nice something that you would not think to find in a strip mall."}
{"text":"It was a good lunch place. Food was tasty, not over priced.  Service was fast. I'd defiantly dine there again."}
{"text":"I have been a customer for over decade (probably longer) the food is always great!
The staff is friendly, happy to help and always smiling.
The owner is engaging and truly happy to see you.

This week we had my daughters graduation party here with 15-20 people and the service was 5 stars as was the food. 

Absolute staple of good food and service in Fort Mill!"}
{"text":"Finding good food in Monroe can be a challenge , especially if you don't want something that is thrown in boiling oil first.   Red Bowl is the best Asian I've had here and is better than I expected for a mall restaurant.  

Their $5 lunch is good, just know you have to purchase a beverage, so it's more like a $7 special.  2 sushi rolls  and salad or miso soup.  I suggested the salad with the Ginger dressing.  You can get ranch anywhere and the Ginger here is VERY flavorful.   Their sushi rolls aren't huge but if you don't wolf it down, you will be satisfied but not stuffed.  Another notable item is their Bento Box.  It is a full meal with many options.  

The wait staff is always pleasant and the food is consistent.  The fact that 2 can eat for under $30 makes it a regular choice for us.  Oh yeah....half price sushi after 8pm is great too!"}
{"text":"I ate here a long time ago...And once again this past week. The staff is UBER Friendly!!! I have had better food, but still good when in the area.

Can not say enough about the service, it's always been \"Spot On!\""}
{"text":"Very Very Welcoming staff and the service is quick. The food is also very good, I've been here for lunch on a couple of occassions and I did order the same thing both times because it was so good.
The Scallop Curry lunch special with a veggie spring roll is PERFECT.."}
{"text":"If i could give less than 1 i would. We should have known when even a pot of hot water with one tea bag came, giving us a luke warm cup of off colored water. But wait, it only got worse. The wonton soup came, tasting like diswater with wontons so old it tasted as if the meat had gone bad. Now the main course: I had the royal dish and my wife had spicy mango chicken. Neither of us could last more than a bite. Mine had shrimp so under cooked i had to spit it out, and the \"crab meat\" was imitation fish. My wife, who never complains, had one bite of the non-spicy mango dish and called for the check. They cut the bill in half to $25 which was still way too much for a couple of bites of the most inedible food in the Solon area. I've never left a negative review before, or left a restaurant without leaving a tip, but this was a first in several ways. Here's the tip I should have left: SAVE YOURSELVES FROM PROBABLE FOOD POISONING AND FIND ANYWHERE ELSE TO EAT!"}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place highly, so we decided to give it a try for dinner.  Our hostess took us to the tables by the bar.  We did  not notice that there empty tables on the other side of the restaurant until too late.  Service was nice, very polite and prompt, by an attentive waiter.   Noise was out of this world. No,  it was not music, it was the bartender a lady  that was being very loud with 2 patrons (or friends) for the entire duration of our dinner.  Not talking, but screaming and laughing loudly (around 8pm, so no alcohol induced).

Food was OK, we ordered General Tsos, a House special fried rice, 2 different teas and a soup (tea was delicious, specially the jasmine tea), but left as soon as we could, and took our food home.  Not sure if we will give it another try."}
{"text":"2 stars because the food was OK. 
This was the first time I ordered takeout from this place for our family and went out of my way because a friend told us about it. During the phone order I ask them if the dinner entrées came with pork fried rice, they said no. I then ordered 2 pork fried rice to go with our Entres. When I got home 15 minutes away I found two containers of pork fried rice and two containers of white rice. I was also missing some pot stickers for the order. I then called back to let them know about the missing food and to inquire about the fried rice. When I ordered I had asked if pork fried rice came with the entrée they said NO. The second time I called to let them know the mistake they said they could do it for a $1 up charge. Wish this was communicated better the first time I called when I placed the order because this what I really wanted. NOT to spend almost an extra $20 on fried rice. I was also a bit surprised nothing was offered to me for the inconvenience of me going out of my way for forgotten food and having to drive back to get the rest of my missing order.

Now to review the food.
Mongolian beef: good flavor, onions were super raw and not cooked enough.

Crab Rangoons: were good but lacking filling.

General Tso chicken: was cooked great and had great spice and flavor.

Pork Fried Rice: not worth the almost $20 extra than the $2 up-charge for what I wanted. But it was \"pork fried rice\"

Hot sour soup: good soup, tasted just like the soup we get at Cherry near lake Wiley.

Pot stickers: can't really review them because by the time I got back home from RedBowl the second time my family was already done with dinner and we put them in the fridge for leftovers.

Honestly I don't think we will give them another try. If some responsibility was taken by the person who took our order when I called back about the missing food and not said \"that's what you ordered\" & maybe offered us a free potsticker or something the next time we would order from them I think we would be more likely to give them another try....."}
{"text":"I met a friend for lunch at Red Bowl.  I was surprised to see that they had a lunch special for $5.00.  The specials included a meat or shrimp, rice and either a spring roll or egg roll.  I had the chicken with mixed vegatables, brown rice and an egg roll.

The food was served quickly after ordering.  I wasn't impressed with the egg roll and couldn't identify what was inside.  The chicken and vegetables were okay, but tasted no better than food served at Chinese buffets.  

The restaurant was large and clean.  Plus, they do a good business for lunch and most of the tables were filled.

You can't beat the $5.00 price, but if you're really wanting good flavorful Chinese food, I wouldn't recommend the lunch special."}
{"text":"Very good restaurant. My girlfriend told me about it so I decided to take her there. Very awesome how they have a sushi menu buy one get one free with a drink purchase. We all know sushi can be expensive sometimes and buy one get one free! Who can go wrong with that?   Beer very cheap. 2.50 a bottle and imports 3.50. They also have omb for 3.50.  We got 2 plates of sushi and shareable appetizer and a vegetable noodle rice plate a beer and a soda and it was around 30 dollars. Very delicious food and they bring you a couple different sauces.  Wednesday night wasn't packed but it wasn't empty. They also have drink specials where imports are 2.50 on Wednesdays. Will definitely be back to this plate to eat some more and get more sushi. Sushi was big and very filling."}
{"text":"Used to be one of our favorites. Tonight we went in, ordered for our kids, then ordered sushi. From the time our kids food was delivered it was almost an hour before I decided to ask them to put our food in to-go boxes when they finished making it. I was highly disappointed and super frustrated that they saw us come in with 3 kids yet thought it was ok to take an hour for sushi and not let us know ahead of time. My husband had to go to the car with our youngest. They did give us a 10% discount- who cares?!?! We paid almost $100 for sushi that we won't get to eat until it tastes disgusting because it's freaking bedtime and now we have to deal with the kids instead of eating dinner."}
{"text":"Worst experience at a restaurant in years. First we waited for almost 10 minutes for a table when there were several tables open. A table of 6 that was seated after our table of 3 not only got their egg rolls before us, but also got their food about 5 minutes before us. Our egg rolls were served after our food, at least the egg rolls were hot. Jessica, our server was wonderful, but the management staff was condescending and didn't offer to comp anything until our server complained. I loved this place when they first opened, however, now I can't recommend them."}
{"text":"This is what you would expect.  Just nothing unusual and nothing with any flair.  Most of the sauces at our table of four were the same even though listed as different \"brown\" sauces on the menu.  

It was salty, plain, and covered in rice.  The chicken in mine was clearly frozen shaved chicken and nothing that resembled high quality ingredients.  This was my second time dining in.  I refrained from my first review as I wanted to give a second chance.  It likely was my last time.

If you want some quick chinese take out, this is your place.  If you want a nice lunch or dinner, pass."}
{"text":"Love this place . I eat lunch pretty much everyday . They are pretty fast & good .
I love everything . Sushi here is pretty small compare to other sushi places ... So I only give you 4 stars !!!"}
{"text":"A lovely Asian bistro with great service and delicious food! Prices are fair and the staff is friendly. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We dined there strictly for the sushi. We had heard many times that their sushi was great. What a disappointment.  The Hamachi was yellow/ grey in color. It tasted rotten and all of the rice was hard. It was either undercooked or old. We told the waitress. She went to get the manager but he wouldn't  come out to the table. He told her to take the Hamachi off the tab but the rice was fine. For $65 we had 4 drinks and about 6 pieces of sushi. We won't be going back"}
{"text":"I am not a huge fan of Chinese cuisine as it alway seems to taste the same, until I discovered red bowl.  Delicious flavors, perfectly cooked, loaded with big chunks of vegetables and when you order in, the presentation is superb, they garnish the plate with fruit such as oranges and melon. Definitely a favorite restaurant of mine and my whole family."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout which included chicken fried rice. It had a fishy shrimp taste and I called them up to complain. Their response was they can give me a free entree the next time I order. Well the problem with that response is, I WILL NOT ORDER AGAIN. The correct response would have been a refund of $8.25 of the total $50.66 charge."}
{"text":"I hate to do it, but this place gets 1 star. The service has always been good. I've eaten here 3 times, ordered sweet and sour chicken all 3 times. The first time, the food was great, second time it was okay, the third time left me sick with food poisoning. I began feeling unsettled towards the end of my meal, but by the time I got home 5 minutes later I was as sick as I've ever been. After food was out of my system I was fine. That will be the last time."}
{"text":"I don't care that it's not authentic or that it is a hodge-podge of various Asian styles.  My dish (Kaprow / Basil Chicken) was very tasty and the spice was just right (was what I asked for).  Beer selection isn't terribly exciting.  Service was fast and very friendly."}
{"text":"I had lived in Tega Cay for almost 2 years before I realized there was a Red Bowl this close to me!

The restaurant is very clean and quiet (we went around 7-8pm)

They have a huge selection of Asian foods, from sushi to entrees and deserts.

I always get sushi, and I try different sushi rolls every time. They never disappoint! The martinis are delicious and full of flavor!

Our server (I can't remember her name) was very attentive and kept our drinks full and kept our table clean.

Will be back very soon :)"}
{"text":"There are many \"Red Bowl\"s here and there. As I expected this place as similar to the one in Cary, which is Okay, I got shocked in a bad way. Of course, it was our fault to order a \"tuna tataki\", because this place wasn't serving other raw fish stuffs. Still, however, at a glance of the dish, I couldn't stop laughing. On the plate, there were very thick cut of tuna, cooked fully almost to the center, no char marked, with a heap of pickled ginger on the side. They looked very gray and that made me totally lose my appetite. It didn't look seared but boiled.

House fried rice tasted just like ones from one of those take out Chinese lunch combo, too much soy sauce + MSG. You guys should realize that many Chinese restaurants serve two totally different fried rices - one is Americanized version, the other is traditional. I drank so much water because of the fried rice, I kept going to bathroom in the middle of night. 

Bottom line, some take out places taste way better... And cheaper. If they don't know how to cook Japanese dishes (or what they really are), they should just drop them from the menu. No one would get angry for that."}
{"text":"I looked online and ordered two things that should have totaled around $10..... somehow it magically turned into $19 when I went to pick it up. No idea what happened there. But they also have a no carb option sushi roll but refused to make any other sushi roll without rice. (The no rice one was $12) in not paying $12 for SIX pieces of sushi. Next time I'll just skip this place and go to a real Chinese or Japanese restaurant bc this was a RIP OFF."}
{"text":"I am not a huge fan of the ubiquitous Pan-Asian restaurants  that try to do it all: Chinese, Sushi, Hibatchi, Thai, Vietnamese, etc. 

It take different skills & experiences as well as cooking & prep techniques  to do each of these well and when you have a small staff trying to do them all, the results usually turn out to be mediocre.

However, for the most part I have found this particular Red Bowl is a little better than other similar restaurants I have been to in the area.

Depending on who takes your order, they ask which veggies you want in your dish. This is great because my S.O. doesn't like a lot of veggies and he can get his dish customized to his liking. I am also a little picky about certain veggies so I like being able to change those up as well.

Also, many other places tend to load up their dishes with mainly veggies & very little chicken...but on our last couple of orders they hooked us up with the chicken.

A lot of times I will get takeout on the way home...but when dining in, the bento boxes are a great way to get a variety of options with your meal.

Overall,  prices are pretty much in line with similar restaurants. Last night I picked up a $29 to-go order that included Kung Pao chicken w/white rice & an egg roll for my SO. And I got Hibatchi Chicken with brown rice, and a Vietnamese shrimp summer roll.  

The chicken dishes both had plenty of chicken as well as nice amount  of veggies. The Vietnamese Shrimp roll was disappointing...next time I will just get the egg roll and go to a Thai restaurant when I want the shrimp roll.

Another plus is that there was enough food for 2 good sized meals in each dish."}
{"text":"I keep thinking the food will get better, but it never does. I'll never go back. I hate even giving it 1 star. Rice is over cooked and items that are marked spicy have no flavor at all."}
{"text":"On Sunday night, it was around 8 when I decided that I didn't feel like cooking dinner, so we hopped in the car and decided to head over to Red Bowl for a quick bite. Despite the fact that the restaurant was not busy, our service was rather sub-par. Also, I was not happy when I ordered my dinner with brown rice (as I always do) and was told that there is now a $1 up-charge for brown rice. WTH? 

Incidentally, I have some good friends who used to frequent this place who are now boycotting it because Red Bowl has started cheaping-out on everything including their sushi specials.  They are definitely losing some of their loyal customers with some of the changes they have been making. 

Before this, Red Bowl was never my favorite spot, but it was cheap & quick.  The quality was always hit-or-miss, and on this visit, the food was so-so.  My flower chicken was ok (bland but not gross), the brown rice was meh, and the chicken egg roll was downright gross (it tasted like a frozen egg-roll that was not very fresh or warm). Based on the food & service on this visit, next time I am looking for a quick bite of Asian food close by, I will head over to Jo-Jo at Stone Crest instead of this place."}
{"text":"Potstickers were good. The tsao chicken was terrible. The fried rice lacked flavor. The Philadelphia roll was very fishy. The Lomein was just ok"}
{"text":"Still bad.  Next to no tuna in the spicy tuna roll, which consisted of only 5 pieces."}
{"text":"We took our food to go and was very happy with the customer service and food . No complaints here , Def try the sushi and the egg rolls."}
{"text":"Worst food I have ever eaten. The Pad Tai was horrible. Way over priced too. The waitress could not even understand our questions or our order."}
{"text":"Great service, good food, and perfect for any occasion. I've been here for dates, for large group dinners with friends from high school, quick family lunches...literally anything, and it works. You can go in a nice outfit or sweatpants (believe me, I've done both), and you will feel comfortable and welcomed. Pretty delicious, too. No complaints :)"}
{"text":"It's normally really good food, but unfortunately we don't frequent it because of their low sanitation score. Sorry."}
{"text":"Great food. Portions are always generous to large. Prices are very reasonable, and kids eat for .99 on Saturday and Monday. I've never had a bad dish, and family/friends always look forward to visiting Red Bowl when they visit. I strong recommendation for Red Bowl!"}
{"text":"Love their fried rice and sesame chicken. Nice service and a good atmosphere is never very crowded and also delivers which is very nice!"}
{"text":"Food is average. Manager/owner is a cheap prick. He hates giving out shrimp sauce with meals. Asked him why he was so tight on the shrimp sauce, he said because I didn't order the right meal for shrimp sauce. He's a complete idiot. if it wasn't for my daughter liking certain dishes there I would never go. 
I rarely go now, specifically because of his cheap a#!. If he's that cheap on the sauce there's no telling where else he's cutting corners."}
{"text":"Uhhh, no.  That will be my answer the next time anyone suggests Red Bowl to me.  The 3 1/2 stars it earned really surprised me though, however, I might've gone on an off day.  I didnt have sushi in the longest time, and was very excited to finally quench my craving. We walked in at 2:50, ten whole minutes before the lunch specials cut-off time.  We already knew what we wanted, but thanks to the snail paced server who took his time taking our order, we missed out on the the $7.25 entrees and were left with the $11-15 ones.  Big bummer for me, so I just opted for the Crazy Roll and the California Roll, shared between my lunch buddy.  The sushi took forever and a half to come out, anyway when it did, it was very delicious and we literally inhaled it.  We then decided to order the California Roll.......which was the worst thing I ever had, they skimped out on the rice so bad that you were able to see more nori than rice.  The rice was a bit crunchy too, and overall tasteless and inedible.  We did not eat that order, and they didnt even bother asking if we had a problem with it, something other establishments normally do.

Anywho, overall I give them 2 stars, 1 for the California Roll and 1 for the bathroom.  I'll have to find another place for my sushi fix, cause this aint cuttin for moi :-S"}
{"text":"Mediocre food at best. The staff is pretty emotionless. They don't offer regular sushi anymore, and the fried rolls they do have aren't that great. There's plenty of much better places to go to."}
{"text":"This was my first time ever at a Red Bowl Asian Bistro. And I hear a lot of mixed thoughts on This place. I actually really enjoyed myself. It has a lot of the American/Chinese items so it is not authentic.

My dinner tonight consisted of the Red Bowl Bento Box. Which they have different items and combinations to choose from. I chose the Chicken and Broccoli, Philly Roll, Egg Roll, and Friced Rice for my first time and really enjoyed it 

The service here is also very well. They kept my drink filled and table clean. It was an enjoyable experience for me.

The only reason for 4 stars is because I've definitely had better food at other places. But like I said this food isn't bad at all for what ya pay for. I will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Not sure why Red Bowl in the Monroe Crossings Mall wasn't on yelp yet but it's definitely the best Asian food I've had in the Monroe area yet. Sushi is good, menu is decent, and there are great specials including five dollars lunches and half off sushi after 8 pm. The service is pretty good and even though they were pretty crowded, I wasn't made to feel rushed."}
{"text":"Love this resturant!  The lunch menu is priced just right and the portion size is more than enough, you can even share.  I like to come here sometimes and get the Mean Green Sushi roll.  All sushi rolls are buy one get one free so you will also get your fill, if you decide to choose that rather than a dish off the menu.  The staff is always friendly and the resturant is clean.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I love Asian food. I love bad Asian food. I love MSG dumped crap that will probably give me cancer when I'm older. But this place.... It's actually bad-bad Asian food. The place itself has a nice environment and the prices are average compared to other restaurants similarly decorated to Red Bowl, but man the food was awful. I would never recommend someone to go here because the sauce that went into my pad thai smelled like urine. What the f."}
{"text":"Ok so I like this place for the most part but the lighting.... the lighting HAS to go!! It's so dim and yellow, not an attractive hue. Food is always delicious and hot. Drinks stay filled. Waitress is super attentive! And I really enjoy the music they play. It's K-Love. Very impressed :) Excited that this place is around the corner from us! I think I'll come back during the day for the natural light vs this yellow dingy hue."}
{"text":"When I'm at a Chinese restaurant having a hard time with chopsticks, I always hope that there's a Chinese kid at an American restaurant somewhere who's struggling mightily with a fork.\" ~Rick Budinich
 To call Red Bowl Asian Bistro a Chinese Restaurant would be like calling the Titanic a boat or the iceberg that sank it a cube.  Yes, Chinese
food is on the menu but so are a great many other dishes that do not originate in China.  The best way to describe the cuisine at Red Bowl is to use the term fusion and since I think that word is pretentious, I am going to try it a different way.  Here goes...the food at Red Bowl is a delicious culmination of all the great far eastern delicacies prepared in a way that the Southern American palate can comprehend.  That is, the Red Bowl menu contains the very best selection of oriental delights that are marketable to the uninitiated diner.  Red Bowl serves food to appeal to gourmands and foodies alike.
 Since I consider myself part of the latter group (not intending to be snobbish), I was especially impressed with the menu's vast selection.  At first, it may appear daunting, but once you settle in you'll realize, as I did, that the size of the selection is what earns Red Bowl the designation of Asian Bistro...in this case, size does matter.  There is no phrase that more aptly describes the subtle nuances and differences of their listed fare than \"Asian Bistro\".  To be sure, regardless of who you are dining with (I know this to be true because I have two very food-finicky kids), there is something on the menu for everyone.
 One of the things that make my dining experience most enjoyable is the ambiance.  A nice ambiance can make a marginal meal good and vice versa.  Red Bowl's new Rock Hill location is perfectly outfitted, and the warm lighting, wood-paneled walls and open floor plan make a perfect setting in which to enjoy a meal.  The main dining room is elegantly appointed and spacious.  There is seating for 120 patrons at a time, and you won't feel crowded, because the atmosphere the open dining room creates is light and airy.  For those of you who are not looking for a full meal, you'll be pleased to know that Red Bowl has an elegant sushi bar manned by very experienced sushi chefs.  Here  you can sit comfortably with a friend, choose freely from the broad selection of makimono (variety of rolls like the ubiquitous California Roll) or Nigirizushi (hand formed sushi) and watch as they are meticulously prepared.  Watching the sushi chefs at Red Bowl is similar to watching a ballet; they are graceful, effective and efficient.  The chefs obviously take great pride in their work, and everything that leaves the kitchen is a masterpiece in style and taste.
 Service can also determine a dining experience.  We were welcomed by Owner Joseph Yang and seated in a private dining room that can host up to 35.  I have to admit, I felt like a rock-star because the VIP treatment never ended.  I thought we might be getting preferential treatment because, after all, we were here to review the restaurant, so I wondered around the dining room to see how the \"mere mortals\" were being served.  To my delight, it was abundantly clear that great service was part of the package.   After we settled in, our waiter, Michael greeted us and took our drink order.  Both the Tega Cay and Rock Hill Red Bowl locations have an extensive bar and wine list (including a great selection of sake), and can serve just about any adult beverage you might desire.  
 We chose to eat \"family style\" and asked Joseph to choose the dishes as opposed to ordering from the menu.  This way, we decided, we would get to try everything that was brought to the table.  As the food arrived, Michael explained to the novices in our group what everything was and what ingredients each dish contained.  
 The sushi arrived first.  I am not sure exactly what we were served because there was so much of it-it seemed like there was one of each item on the sushi menu represented.  Sushi is one of my favorite foods and I have eaten it at various venues around the world from London to the Cayman Islands and everywhere in between.  Not only was the sushi expertly prepared and presented, it was delicious, too.  Actually, delicious is an understatement but I can't think of a word that aptly explains these taste bud treats.  We devoured the sushi platter (including the garnishes) as if we'd been stranded on an island without food for weeks.  In retrospect, had I stopped to consider how voraciously we ate, I might have been a little embarrassed.  The sushi was THAT good.
 The remnants (what little there were) were cleared and the next course arrived which was an assortment of the appetizers.  Among the parade of pre-meal tid-bits were pan-friend dumplings, chicken skewers, lettuce wraps, spring rolls, egg rolls, and sauces for dipping."}
{"text":"New to this immediate area, but a 22 year veteran of this side of Charlotte, I am still working my way around the restaurants at Promenade on Providence.  Johnny's Red Bowl is on the 485 side of the shopping center, out of the main flow of traffic, near the Subway and the Hallmark store.  

I stopped in for takeout tonight and got a variety of things for dinner for the next 2 nights.  The breakdown:

Restaurant:  clean and the young lady working at the front desk was very friendly.  I told her this was my first visit and she handed me a menu and said if I had any questions to please ask.  There was a thin crowd, but it was 6:30 on a bank-holiday Monday night, so I wasn't expecting a line out the door.  

The order:
1 Spring Roll and 1 Chicken Egg Roll:  Typical takeout.  Neither was amazing, but both were fine.  
Egg Drop soup:  Nice broth, good amount of egg, I added salt and pepper and a handful of the crispy noodles and it was good.  Seriously tasted exactly like every bowl of egg drop soup that I have ever gotten for takeout.
General Tso's Chicken:  Slightly spicy, but not crazy, just the way I like it.  Served with white rice.  I believe this was a little over $10 and it was a huge portion.  Placed in a nice plastic takeout container, there was a layer of lettuce on the bottom (?).  Odd.  I dumped the chicken on a plate with the rice and picked the lettuce out.  Even after a stop at a bakery on the way home with the food, it was still smokin' hot.  A LOT of food.
Veggie Lo Mein:  I ordered this specifically to put in the fridge for dinner tomorrow night.  I had a bite just to taste it and it was pretty good.  Lots and lots of veggies, which was nice.  Again... typical of Chinese takeout.

The total for everything was $27.  It was good.  Nothing that was going to win an award, but was good takeout, hot food and fast friendly service."}
{"text":"Very inconsistent.  We have been here many times from the opening until recently.  We have had our book group luncheons, dinner with neighbors and just wife and I.  

They offer Chinese, Thai, Japanese and other Asian dishes, along with sushi which seems to be popular.  Sometimes it is great, wonderfully cooked and flavorful.  But most times the rice is gummy, the food flavorless and you never have consistency.  I have concluded that it just depends on who is working the kitchen during your meal time.

There is a full bar, so happy hour can be excellent, especially as the sushi works as a great snack.  

We were excited when Red Bowl expanded from Tega Cay and Fort Mill into Indian Land but are disappointed at the inconsistency and generally blah meals.  We only go to Red Bowl if it was set up by one of our organizations.  We beg off if a neighbor suggests it."}
{"text":"I have to agree with the previous reviewer-- restaurants specializing in more than one type of food are rarely great.

Red Bowl's number one thing going for it is that it has a full gluten-free menu, which can be great for some people.

I've eaten here a number of times and every time I'm underwhelmed. To me it seems like the food is just bland and slightly over-priced. I will say, however, that some people I know really seem to enjoy it, so perhaps my tastes just aren't that good (or maybe I have more experience with this kind of food!)

Atmosphere is quite nice, and the staff is pretty welcoming. If there were something better for this type of food in the area, I would have rated this place only 2 stars, but since this is about it, unless you want generic Chinese food, I'll give it 3.

You can check their website www.redbowltegacay.com for daily specials, too."}
{"text":"At first we were happy to see a Red Bowl withing golf cart driving distance in Sun City.  The bloom is now off that red rose.

A luncheon for one of our clubs worked out.  It was not crowded, the food arrived together and was just fine.  My hopes rose as we had not been back for months after three bad experiences.

Well, good was not to last.  Two more dinner occasions and the tastes were just \"off.\"  Their fusion is not working well.

The blends of shrimp, chicken and scollops tasted as if dish soap was mixed in.  Another evening, which my wife insisted we go back to eat, I ordered a simple pork fried rice and could only eat a small portion.  How do you screw up fried rice?  The pork was greasy, much of the rice hard and crunchy and it was gummy.  Ahhhhhh!

We will not be back.  How sad as the Charlotte location seemed to get it right, but I am not going back there for a comparison, either.

Bye, bye Red Bowl Indian Land."}
{"text":"Not a fan! First time eating here. Would never recommend it ever. I Ordered the bento box with Hibatchi chicken. Found a bug in my food. Gross!Chicken in the kids meal chicken & broccoli tasted weird. We will not be going back."}
{"text":"What has happened to this location? We have been going here for 3yrs now but the past 3x there have been horrible so we will not be going again. The service both dine in and dine out are excellent but the food has been terrible. The chicken egg rolls are not the same ones as they have always used and barely have any chicken at all and instead are stuffed with too much cabbage. The sauce for the chicken with scallions is too thick and like gelatin which makes it almost gag worthy to even try to eat. My husbands dinner was bland, soggy, and nothing like it has been in the past. I don't know if they are under new ownership or what but this place has severely gone down hill. No more sushi either and the place is usually dead anytime you go there."}
{"text":"I got off work after 9pm and stopped here to get some takeout for dinner. After reading the menu I ordered some sort of chicken that sounded fairly healthy with veggies. I had a fairly short wait and when I got home and opened it up it had maybe two pieces of broccoli in it that had been WAY over cooked to almost a yellow mush and then a piece of something that resembled an old soggy piece of lettuce. It must have been made a week ago! It was disgusting and I ended up throwing it away and eating cheese and crackers for dinner."}
{"text":"Red Bowl has established a persona as a very good restaurant. Nice clean place, great service and great sounding menu. However the two times I have tried them the actual food is not good. The pork dumplings are anemic. The red curry shrimp was mostly onions, the dragon and Phoenix was like chicken in corn syrup  and the shrimp was bland and cold. However the food presentation was great, the actual flavors and freshness was sub par."}
{"text":"Was here for my nephew's wedding, this was the dinner following the rehearsal.  The staff as outstanding and super friendly.  Two great young ladies, to handle a room or 24 people and they did it with a smile.   The food was delicious.  I ordered sushi, but also got to pick from the wife's plate of Stir Fry, and both were spot on. I am sure as we visit my sis more and more, we will make a point of visiting here often."}
{"text":"STAY AWAY Now that I have your attention let me explain. First time here, we were out running errands all day plus voting. On the way home we thought it would be a great idea to stop and have a cocktail and order some food to take home. I will break it down. Bar and bartender scary at best. Every surface you touched was stickey, gross. Bartender just wanted to go home. Bathrooms dirty, dining room had trash all over floor. Whole place just had an unpleasant smell. Ordered several apps and entrees to go (we left and were home in less than 10 minutes after getting our order),  including sushi. Sushi was the worst, most gross thing ever seen or smelled, it was WARM, fish was of some kind of ground consistenty, smelled and was uneatable. Egg rolls were missing. Called from home and response was \"everyone does sushi differant, and next time u come in just tell us we will give u a free eggroll. Beef with asparagus was tasteless except for the spice which I asked them to make it spicy, asparagus was just the woody end trimmings that were uneatable. However it had a whole lot of carrots, WTH. BEEF was junk. Garlic Pork was tastless, just overly hot with spice. This in my opinion is the worst place I have ever seen."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken pad Thai to go. The only positive thing was that it was served hot. Lacked flavor and veggie tables-it might as well have been chicken and noodles. Very disappointing and I won't be ordering this again."}
{"text":"WORST. THAI. FOOD. EVER. I don't even know how they can call it Thai Food. There wasn't any curry in the red curry. The Tom Kai soup was totally inedible. The only edible food was the Crab Wontons and the fortune cookies."}
{"text":"Oh, yummy is the first thing I'd like to say! I've been several times and my favorite is the Red Curry Shrimp. Other dishes I've tried are: Red Curry Chicken, Green Curry Chicken and Peacock Shrimp. The portions are generous and the prices are quite reasonable for lunch (I've not been for dinner). The wait staff is nice as well. This is one of my favorite places to eat in Fort Mill."}
{"text":"Ugh! I rarely start a review so negatively but I have to wonder how such a consistently nasty restaurant remains open. Does anybody look at the sanitation rating when they walk through the door? Theirs is regularly in the eighties and based on my experience it's deserved.

Even before that became a trend, the three times that we ate there, we experienced sticky tables, dirty plates and silverware, lukewarm food that was average at best served up via a lackluster wait staff.

No way will I will return. I'll get my penicillin elsewhere. I give it one star not because they deserve it but because I have to."}
{"text":"This should not even be called Chinese food. It's horrible and way over priced. My kids neon noodles taste like a mix of burnt oil and gas. The egg rolls are filled with mostly cabbage...no shrimp or pork or other veggies. 

Not going back here again"}
{"text":"Good food, in the past it was much better not sure why the change but still good. 
Take out is really the way to go, I think you get more food, they have all types of Asian food so it was nice to venture out and try something I've never seen on a Chinese food menu. Small but nice bar area that you are able to eat at."}
{"text":"My husband and I went a few weeks ago. We just moved here and are in search for a great place for pad Thai. Needless to say, this is not the place. My husband commented in how it smelt like cat food- and he was right. The sushi deserves about 3 stars. Average at best. Sadly, we will continue our search..... The staff was very nice (that is why they are getting the extra star)."}
{"text":"ALWAYS a favorite! Lived in FM when it opened years ago and was a regular customer.  Even had my son's college graduation party in the back room.  The owner always has a smile on his face and the woman at the take out counter is just as friendly. The food is awesome. Every time I come to town I am sure to get at least one meal there."}
{"text":"Low Prices but not completely authentic Japanese food, more of a fast food Japanese than gourmet. The sushi was decent. The ginger salad was sufficient, the miso soup was a little disappointing."}
{"text":"Favorite \"chain\" Chinese restaurant.  I have been to several locations and it never disappoints.  I usually get the stir fry bar , beef- all the veggies - sa cha sauce and noodles.... WOW add a little chili oil !! Sometimes I just do the sushi.. Amazing!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and excellent service! However, the takeout order, which was large, did not contain enough eating utensils - 2 sets of chopsticks for 8 people :("}
{"text":"I've dined in once and had take out from here many times.  If you're in the mood for Chinese or Japanese food, this is the place to go in the area.  There really aren't many options for now, so for the best tasting with added flavor, come here.  The staff is always friendly, and food is always quickly made.  The sushi rolls are filling and fresh.  The curry dishes are super filling.  A great local spot to stop by if you're in the mood."}
{"text":"Went to have a quick lunch here today with the hubby. The decor is  modern Asian and located in a really posh shopping environment. 

We were pressed for time, seeing that I had to be to work within the hour, so we decided to order sushi. Since we have not been to this redbowl location before, (have been to the on mt holly-huntersville rd) we asked our server what roll did he like. He informed us that he didn't eat sushi, so he was no help.

So we ordered the redbowl roll and the snow white roll. We also ordered fried rice and Lo neon. The rice was average and the noodles were good. The sushi was really good as well. I will be visiting here more often."}
{"text":"One of my favorite local Asian restaurants. I usually get the Bento box hibachi chicken is always good spring rolls are fresh, services good price is reasonable."}
{"text":"I love this place!   Great food and great prices!  1/2 price bottles of wine daily and 1/2 price appetizers after 7 every day!   
The lettuce wraps are great and so are the egg rolls.  The best Red Bowl roll!  
Bento boxes are so good with such good price!   
Best place around."}
{"text":"Okay, saying that I love Asian food is darn near the understatement of the century. And I mean I love both the legit stuff I get when in Asia and the western versions sold most everywhere else.

So, after relocating to Charlotte I was excited when I first noticed an Asian restaurant on the way home from my office.

As is my custom when trying any restaurant for the first time I pick something easy, but not simple - in this case it was Chicken Pad Thai.  My theory is this; if they can do that well, then everything else should be good. Like getting a plain vanilla ice cream the first time you go to a local (really local) ice cream shop. If that is good it will all be good; or at least some variation of acceptable.

I am sad to report that I could not eat the Pad Thai. After two bites I tossed it in the trash. And you should understand that I was 'blessed' with the intestinal fortitude of a billy goat and I don't believe in wasting food. That is not how I was raised, no ma'am. But I simply couldn't eat the dish. It was quite unfortunately horrible in so many ways.

I wish I could try this place again, but I won't. And frankly I wouldn't recommend it to anyone else either. To be honest I was a little concerned when I was exposed to their exceptionally lengthy menu - that is always a warning sign."}
{"text":"We have been getting takeout from Red Bowl in Fort Mill for 3 years.  A few months ago the sweet & sour sauce tasted like vinegar.  We took it back and they apologized and remixed it and it tasted like normal.

Tonight we received sweet & sour sauce that tasted like vinegar.  We were told that there is a new chef and sometimes the sauce is dark and sometimes it is light.  I have eaten sweet & sour sauce for 20 years and NEVER had it taste like vinegar.  

We paid $10 for sweet & sour chicken and have no sauce to eat it with.  We were offered no compensation and were told that no other customers complained about the sauce.

We will not be returning.  Such a shame that the food has gone downhill."}
{"text":"Not the best Chinese food I have had bit far from the worst. There was a small language barrier. We orders online and when we went to pick it up, there was some confusion. It appears that try are still getting used to their computer system as it was giving a little trouble. The place looks nice. I'm recall it being an Italian restaurant previously. It's very open and bright which is good. I ordered the Sweet and Sour Chicken and he got General Taos Chicken. The rice was interesting to say the least. It was like steamed rice with a hint of soy sauce and barely any vegetables like you expect in fried rice. My chicken was fine and the sauce was fine. His was not spicy at all which was sad because this is a spicy dish. We also ordered hot and sour soup that was mostly oil. It was thick, had mushrooms in it which was new to me and was so oily, the soup was separating. All you tasted was oil. We tried it because it was closer than the place we usually go and the reviews were nice. We probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Since there are two Yelp accounts for this restaurant, I am re-posting my original review for \"Johnny's Red Bowl\" (since it's the exact same place) here as well.

Yelpers please note: I got a Yelp account specifically so I could share with the world how TERRIBLE this restaurant is. I have visited multiple times, each time hoping for a less horrible experience and each time I was disappointed. Last night was the final straw.

Previously I ate here for the lunch special. The food was decent, the price was very fair ($5). The service, however, was spotty at best: empty drinks were ignored, appetizers were forgotten, and our server barely interacted with us (might I mention that the dining area had less than three tables occupied at the time?). I chalked it up to an \"off day\" on the server's part. No stress.

When I returned to the Red Bowl last night for half-off sushi (after 8pm), I anticipated poor service. I was not, however, prepared for how unbelievably awful my experience would truly turn out to be. After we were seated, someone took our drink orders. It took about five minutes for us to get out drinks (not terrible). When our server arrived with our drinks and asked if we were ready to order, we requested a few more minutes to decide. HE DID NOT RETURN FOR OVER 25 MINUTES. We sat at our table with half-empty glasses, twiddling our thumbs, waiting to give our orders. At one point he breezed past our table and as I tried to flag him down HE HELD UP HIS POINTER FINGER (the \"one minute\" hand gesture) and kept walking. After a few more minutes her returned, took our orders and walked off. We waited for 30 MINUTES for our food to come out. During this time, our server couldn't be bothered to apologize for slow service, make small talk, or even refill our drinks. He completely IGNORED our table. When our food did finally arrive, he left almost as soon as the plates hit our table. We had to search the restaurant for soy sauce dipping bowls, and he never once asked us how our sushi was. The only time he returned was to give us our checks.

The food is okay (at best) and I think that you get what you pay for. My sushi rolls were unimpressive and while the noodle dish my friend received was huge, I was very disappointed with the size of my rolls. They were small, slapped together haphazardly, drenched in funny-tasting sauce that muddled all the flavors and textures together.

I understand that a slow-moving or backed-up kitchen is not a server's fault. I understand that when you are serving, you can be overwhelmed by orders and demands (although there was easily less than forty people in the \"bar area\" and this server was helping only three or four tables including ours). But what I do not understand is how you can essentially forget that a table of people exists and be completely unapologetic about it.

My friends and I joke about the poor service at this restaurant and are generally good-natured about it, but after last night's experience I can promise you that I will never return.

TLDR: You get what you pay for. The food is okay at best. The service is CONSISTENTLY the WORST I've ever experienced. Spend a few extra dollars at Sushi 101 (which is also in the Promenade) or Pei Wei's (in Ballantyne) for better food and better service."}
{"text":"Good food, a bit pricey, but sushi is just ok.....peking tokyo sushi is WAY better!....my favorite here is the scallion chicken"}
{"text":"I order take out from here weekly. It's always good and the service is always fast. I love their Red Bowl roll...all of their sushi is great. Go here you won't be let down."}
{"text":"Was in the area yesterday and drove by Red Bowl. My company had eaten there before and suggested we stop for lunch.

Modern Asian feel inside, very nice and spacious with a good size bar. I also noticed what looked like a buffet at first, but is really a stir fry bar! (pretty cool)

Had Mongolian beef lunch special, for less than $7 its a steal. Comes with choice of spring or egg roll. And your choice of rice.

Rolls came out quick and piping hot. Also with dish that held 2 different dipping sauces. (sweet & sour, & some shrimp sauce I think?)

All the food was very good, service was good, left me wanting to come back!!"}
{"text":"I have been to another Red Bowl, but this was my first time at this location. We arrived a little after 1:30, hoping for the lunch rush to be over, and it was. We were greeted right away and led to the dining room, which was less than half full. The hostess proceeds to sit us next to an infant in a high chair, when there were clearly better decisions that could have been made there given the empty nature of the dining room. 
The hostess came right back and said she would be taking our drink orders, 2 minutes later she delivers a Pepsi and a water. So far so good, except for the screaming kid next to me. 
It is then at least 10 minutes before we first met our waiter, and he was clearly flustered and over-sat. He took our orders quickly, and was off. I ordered Mongolian beef which I love, my better half went with beef lo mein. We quickly got our egg & spring rolls, which were great, and fresh. 
The wait for the food seemed a bit longer than it should have been, but again, that could have been the effect of the screaming infant in my left ear drum. When our food was delivered I was just about out of my soda, the waiter says \"i'll grab ya some re-fills, be right back.\" That was the last time I saw him until my plate was just about empty, my glass had sat empty for at least 10 minutes, and I was just about ready to go. 
He never stopped back to check how the food was, I never got my refill and ate more than half of my lunch without a beverage. There seemed to be a \"manager\" who did a real good job at walking around looking pretty, but never had a thing in his hands while everyone else is running around crazy. The sad part is, other than not being piping hot, the food was great. Both my wife and I loved our meals, but the experience was ruined by absolute lack of service. 
On the way out, I asked the manager if there was a customer service e-mail I could have or some kind or corporate contact, and was directed to redbowlusa.com. That was it, he obviously did not care that there was something I was un-happy about, that could have been solved with a quick apology and acknowledgement of some sort. Oh well despite the great food, I will not be back."}
{"text":"Very good Asian restaurant with plenty for everyone.  The food is delicious and they give you more than enough for the price.  I love the atmosphere and drinking the sake!.  Will be returning!"}
{"text":"We always have a great time and great food at Johnny's Red Bowl.  The management knows how to run a restaurant and interact with their customers in a way that makes you happy to support their business."}
{"text":"YUK. I went there for lunch & had the Pad Thai. YUK. It was gummy & flavorless and not worth the time or money. The shrimp smelled funky, and I was afraid I was going to get sick from it. The waitress was efficient but never once smiled."}
{"text":"Not even almost good!
The squid salad was bland, rubbery and simply not fresh.
Tables were sticky! 
Service was terrible! 
My husband's soup came
ten minutes before my chicken soup which had crab rather than chicken.
The soup was spilled and then literally wiped in my lap, which became funny after a certain point because I felt like I this had to be some kind of prank, but unfortunately not. 
Also was given sweet tea rather than un-sweet twice (I really don't think the waitress understood English at all.) 
Have had much better food and service at the mall! 
This was our last time to be disappointed at this location."}
{"text":"Over the years many restaurants have come and gone and occupied this low visibility storefront. I have a feeling that Red Bowl has what it takes to survive at this address for a long time. We visited Red Bowl on New Years Day for lunch. It was obvious that the staff was excited and met us at the door with a smile. The Chinese and Thai menu offered a variety of dishes for everyone. My picky girls did not have a problem finding something that they liked. The three types of soup and egg rolls that we ordered we very good. The wonton soup was somewhat watered down, but was not not flavorless. The egg rolls were crunchy and average. Our entrees were dinner size and well above average. The dishes had crisp veggies and solid flavor. No Birdseye thawed veggies here! As we ate, three heads peeked out from behind the kitchen wall pass through waiting for a reaction as we ate. I gave them a thumbs up and got back three smiles. The bill came to $42. Not bad at all for a party a four with appetizers. If you want a quality and affordable Chinese sit down restaurant, Red Bowl is worth visiting."}
{"text":"Large quantity of food for a great price. There is a large selection on the menu. Sushi is ok. Not the best I have ever had but not bad. Shrimp pad thai is very good."}
{"text":"My wife and I have lunch here once a date night each month. We find the variety of Asian foods delightful, always well prepared and presented. I am always ready for their Chinese and Thai dishes. I don't remember dinners there."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed lunch at Red Bowl earlier this week. This was my first visit to Red Bowl. I have driven past many of these in the past and have yet to try one. I was unsure of what to expect as I had heard mixed reviews. 

One major plus was the price point. I spent about $10 on lunch which included an egg roll, half of a spicy tuna roll I split with a coworker, and a sesame chicken and fried rice entree. 

I was a bit skeptical after walking in and observing a not so friendly odor, but luckily it soon dissipated. The service was truthfully 4 stars, but I really enjoyed the food and had an overall pleasant experience and great lunch!"}
{"text":"Good restaurant. Better in the early days but still not bad today."}
{"text":"they need to get a health inspector in here asap wish i could leave 0 stars ... eat with caution."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and have not bee impressed by the food or service.  The restaurant is pretty big and the first time we went I got the impression our business wasn't important to them. Employees all over the place but doing very little that had to do with serving the customers who pay their bills.  The food tastes like it was laminated in MSG after it was fried. Frankly I'm surprised they're still open."}
{"text":"Decent Asian-American, especially for Monroe. The price is probably what keeps me coming back - look for the specials. I've always gone for lunch, never been let down."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how we got lost in translation.  I ordered lunch for work here today, ordered it to go.  I should have checked it before I left.  I ordered the Phoenix Maki roll which is described on their website as:  \"Phoenix Maki - spicy tuna topped with avocado, spicy mayo and masago.9.25\".  It had no Ahi / Tuna in it.   It was breading mixed with spicy sauce on the inside, also no masago.  This was a really big dissapointment for me, my coworker suggested this place as one of the better sushi spots.  I posted a pic to show what I got next to my order receipt. You can see no tuna, only breading with mayo inside.  And you can see no masago.   I'm so bummed."}
{"text":"I've been going here for years but will never go back now. They had a special BOGO on sushi (2nd roll of equal or lesser value free). We ordered four rolls $14, $13, $6, and $5. Bill came and they gave us the $6 and $5 roll free. I told them that I wanted to buy the $14 roll and get $13 free and likewise with the others. 

Manager came to our table and just kept repeating that their interpretation of the offer was different than ours. Then she walked off and said she was calling the cops! This was outrageous. 

I then requested they split our check with the $14 and $13 roll on the separate check. They continued to refuse and the manager actually called the cops. I didn't have time to wait for them to arrive, so I had to pay what they forced me to. Overall not a great dining experience."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with such all the good reviews. 
I really thought it was going to be good food. There was only six shrimp in the curry shrimp order. The fired rice look like it was reheated. The cost is $$$$ for what I order. I would not recommend it. I travel for work, this is one I would stay away from."}
{"text":"Used to be my favorite go-to local place.  Lately has gone way down hill.  Positives: large portions,  attentive wait staff.   Negatives: odd managerial choices (ie. I Ordered meal- mentioned shellfish allergy, to avoid cross contamination) was greeted by manager holding a HUGE (like 12 lbs) can of hosein sauce, which she kept nudging towards me asking me to read the ingredients.  Ive never had any restaurant do anything like that.  Recently they forgot a portion of my to-go order and i had to go back (they barely apologized) and the cashier up front took my order but forgot to ask my name or note that I paid for it so there was lots of confusion when the food arrived.  It just isnt running smoothly anymore and feels very impersonal"}
{"text":"Food is ok.  Place is a bit run down.  The service is good.  So, nothing earth-shattering or spectacular about this place.  Not bad, just nothing to write home about.  If you're in the area and want decent Chinese, give it a try."}
{"text":"I love the crab roll they have here! I don't usually even eat sushi, but this one was sooo good. My man loves the sesame chicken and the lo mein. Just don't go if you want drinks.. worst cosmo ever."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place since it's so close to my house.  First, they don't serve alcohol, so that's a bit of an issue, but with great food I can overlook that.  So, we started off with the steamed veggie dumplings.  Before shoving one in my mouth, I decided to investigate the insides, since I don't eat meat.  I saw an unidentifiable meat-like substance inside so I asked my carnivore husband to be the guinea pig and eat one.  He did and said it was definitely meat.  I brought this to the servers attention so she went into the kitchen and decided that it would be a good idea to bring out the frozen bag labeled \"vegetable dumplings\".  Face palm.  Note to servers:  it's not a good idea to bring out a frozen bag of anything when trying to explain something to your customers.  So, not only did the dumplings have meat in them, they were frozen.  Yummy!!!!  I digress...  I didn't want to argue with the server (there was a language barrier), so the husband ate them and I didn't.  For my entree, I ordered the veggie chow fun, which was ok.  The noodles were pad thai noodles, not the thicker chow fun noodles, but they were ok. Definitely not bad, but not very flavorful.  The veggies were well prepared and seemed fresh, but since the apps were frozen, I'm skeptical.  I can't remember what the husband got but he seemed to enjoy it.  So, in summary:  strike 1 - no booze, strike 2 - served me meat, strike 3 - served me frozen food.  Hopefully they straighten themselves out."}
{"text":"Clean and nice place.  Staff was friendly but sadly the food was just ok.  Sushi was bland and so was the bento box. Sushi tasted like the sushi you order from a grocery store."}
{"text":"This is the closest I have come to my mother's in law cooking, who is from Thailand.  The food was fresh and cooked wonderfully."}
{"text":"awesome place? great food and sushi!! Love this place!! Great specials!!"}
{"text":"Over the years food here has gotten more bland and tasteless. Scallops and shrimp have no taste except for the staleness of being frozen. The sushi is gummy and rice is not fresh. When their bland house salad of mostly non nutritional iceberg lettuce and two cucumbers arrived, I was informed that they were out of carrots. I asked if I could have seaweed salad instead. They said sure but that they were going to charge me. When pressed they finally gave me one tablespoon of seaweed salad. I will not come here again. Oh, and the loud Christian music playing doesn't add anything to the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Visited this Red Bowl Asian Bistro for the first time a week or so ago.  It is a bit of a drive coming from Matthews, but I have some friends that live near the Carowinds area.  We could not decide on what we wanted to eat so this place as suggested.  I had never been there before, but I'm always open to trying new places.

It was a weekday night so the bistro was not too terribly crowded.

I ordered the diner \"bento box combo\" which was a ton of food for a decent price.  The only problem was that everything on the menu sounded good to try!  I tasted their \"bam bam shrip, spicy tuna roll, and white rice.  Everything was great!  Need to go back and try some of their other menu items."}
{"text":"Just back from my first visit to Red Bowl in almost four years. I live about 1 mile away from Red Bowl but stopped eating there due to the poor food and high prices. I was just reminded of how bad the food really is at Red Bowl.

I ordered pork fried rice, cashew chicken and chicken with broccoli.  The rice had absolutely no flavor. None. It was just an overcooked, mushy pile of rice with some once-frozen veggies that were very dry. Both chicken dishes were absolutely drenched in oil and much too salty. I can honestly say that this was one of the worst meals I've ever had - my family shared the same opinion. Add in the higher relative prices compared to most Chinese restaurants and you have the perfect recipe for an entirely disappointing and unacceptable meal. I'd rate this zero if I could. 

A four year absence from Red Bowl made me forget how bad it truly is. That's not a mistake I will make again."}
{"text":"First, I have to say this.. 1 Star is being extremely generous. Unfortunately there is no 0 option so 1 it is. Whatever might possess you to try this restaurant, despite the poor reviews. STOP. Don't do it. It's not worth it. I know what you're thinking \"oh it can't be that bad. It has a few 5 star reviews!\" You're wrong. It is that bad. I imagine the people who left those reviews suffer from a medical condition known as anosmia, meaning you lack the sense of smell and therefore your sense of taste is equally affected. That's the only possible reason I can come up with that anyone could give this restaurant a good or even mediocre review.



My husband and I pass this restaurant regularly and always comment about having dinner there. I checked out the reviews on yelp and because they weren't stellar, for months we avoided it. Tonight, I said what the hell... let's try it. 

We walk in and are greeted by a boy who is about 10 years old. He seats us at a table and gets us a high chair for my son. He takes our drink order and the waitress brings us our waters and kind of rudely just places them on the table. She asks if we're ready and we say yes. She didn't introduce herself and  wasn't warm or polite. Literally the first thing she said was \"are you ready to order?\"
We order things that are pretty hard to screw up. Even the worst Chinese restaurants make these dishes that are standard American Chinese food. 

For an appetizer we order fried vegetable dumplings because I've never had a bad potsticker in my life. Until tonight.... She brought us our dumplings and didn't give us appetizer dishes so we just ate off of the serving dish. They were horrible. The wonton wrapper was rubbery and the filling was mushy, wet and disgusting. There were corn kernels in what looked like a raw vegetable mash. It was inedible. I saw another review that said they were store bought frozen dumplings. I believe that. They didn't look or taste like homemade potstickers. The sauce it came with was okay. I ate half of one and my husband ate one and we decided we wouldn't eat the rest. 

For dinner, we ordered, again, things that are fairly difficult to mess up. Standard American Chinese entrees. 

I ordered sesame chicken. what should be a breaded, crispy, deep fried chicken with a sweet sesame sauce was a breaded, mushy chicken with  a thin, bland, not sweet brown sauce over a bed of lettuce. I took one bite. It was inedible. I don't know how you can fry breaded chicken and have it come out mushy but they managed to do it. The only good thing about it was the plain steamed rice. The rest was horrible. 

My husband ordered Kung pao chicken. He asked for it medium spicy. It was not spicy at all. I tried it. A standard brown sauce without a drop of spice. Kung pao is supposed to be spicy. It was bland and also inedible. He took about 6 bites before he gave up.

The only pros to dishes were large serving portions. So if you're looking to get a giant heaping plate of crap, go for it. 

I went to the register to pay. A woman asked me what was wrong. I told her we didn't like the food. She asked if we wanted something else. We said no thanks. She asked what was wrong with it. I told her it just wasn't very good and not what we're used to. Then our waitress handed us the bill. She didn't take anything off and didn't even offer. I even tipped her $3.00 because I felt bad that she'd likely be out of a job soon because the restaurant can't possibly last much longer. $34.00 for two bites of the worst Chinese food I've ever eaten.

My husband and I left and got take out from another restaurant."}
{"text":"I was seriously impressed with the portion sizes vs. price at this restaurant. Every other bento box I have ordered has come with one selection per square in the box. At Red Bowl one of my selections was a house salad and instead of putting a small portion in with the rest of the bento box they brought me a large salad as a starter on a separate plate. The house dressing was delicious with the ginger being a little more subtle than usual.

The bento box itself had a full sushi roll and didn't skimp on the hibachi steak or vegetables. The fried rice that came with it was also full of vegetables and wasn't greasy. The hot tea I ordered came with two teabags in a large pot which meant I never had to ask our waitress for a refill. 

All said the bento box was just under $13 and I left full and happy with the quality of the meal. We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"The spring rolls are some of the best I've ever had, the service is quick and friendly, and the tangerine chicken is very tasty! Can't wait to try more!"}
{"text":"Food was very good and our server was friendly, but a tad harried (hence the 4 stars, instead of 5). 

I had a Bento Box and my husband had a Stir Fry Bowl. We both really enjoyed our meals. 

Our server was very nice, but she must have been new. She didn't know the answers to a couple of basic questions, she didn't know the menu, and she seemed frazzled. We noticed that the manager picked up on it, too and he pulled her aside a couple of times to talk to her. For example, the Stir Fry Bowl came with a choice of different rices and \"Chinese Noodles\". We asked what kind of noodles they are and her response was \"I don't know\"...not \"Let me find out\". She actually said, I don't know. UGH!  We had to ask her to find out for us.  BTW...they are Lo Mein noodles. :-)   I understand that there's a learning curve and I most certainly can look past the newbie jitters, but it drives me batty when servers don't know the menu or offer to have someone else answer questions that they can't answer.

With all of that being said....we still really liked it there. Very clean, very good food, and decent prices."}
{"text":"I have only tried this place for lunch and I am a fan! They have $5 lunch specials with salad and sushi, which my wife loves but I get the Sesame Chicken special and it is great. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the 3 times we went, the waitstaff wasn't very attentive 2 of the times."}
{"text":"This place was soooooo good at one point and time.   First, they have pretty much done away with the amazing lunch special they had before.   At one point you could get a dish with one entree, rice, and egg roll for 5 dollars.  Now the options for the dishes are odd, the tea isn't included and the price went up to 5.75.  I understand inflation but if you got to raise the price then at the very least the quality should remain the same or higher even, but that's not the case.   The food is just sub par the last several times we have visited there.  The staff is nice enough but it is rare to see the same face 2xs in a row because the turn over rate is high.  They constantly have a now hiring sign on the door.  Today we had a extra person for lunch.   He was a cute little boy that I believe belonged to one of the waitresses.  He joined in our lunch by standing in a chair outside the window next to our table and beat on the glass and when we would look he would point a nerf gun at us.   If we didn't look he would beat on the window until we did look.  Later I spotted him on the stairwell pointing the nerf gun at us again.  I guess the nerf gun war was including in the lunch special.  I have 2 kids so I get it, but wow you got to keep the kid under control.  Anyway, this place has potential but once again it needs to be brought up to the standards it had when it first opened the doors.  By the way....the sanitation rating was 94.  Not impressive at all."}
{"text":"Science class for the clinically insane.

I'll start by saying the food was ok. Not spectacular, not terrible. That's why id give it 2 stars. However, I do not recommend coming here if you have any food allergies or dietary restrictions. Or if you don't like to be treated disrespectfully by an arrogant and overly incompetent manager.

After ordering vegetable dumplings and double checking with the host to make sure it was a vegetarian menu item, I gobbled up 1 and bit into another before realizing that I was eating meat, presumably pork. I was not happy because those few bites could make me sick, but understanding that mistakes happen, I just showed the waitress and asked for the vegetable version. The waitress Catherine was very nice and apologetic, however after a quick trip to the kitchen she returned, embarrassed, with the manager.

Apparently the meat in the dumpling had caused an argument in the kitchen and the manager, looking none too pleased after being pulled away from his cigarette, said he would fix it and came back from the kitchen with one dumpling on a small plate. He then proceeded to demonstrate what I will call \"science class for the clinically insane\". As he vigorously cut through the dumpling I realized that this was not a courtesy, this was a challenge.

He pulled the two halves of dumpling apart in front of me as if to show me that I was crazy, and obviously annoying him for no reason, but unfortunately the pork tumbled out of the dumpling, disproving his hypothesis.

In a twist no one saw coming, he pointed to the meat and said \"see, only vegetables\". I pointed to one especially greasy lump of meat and asked \"what type of vegetable is this?\" To which he replied \" I don't know...vegetables. You know, tofu or something.\"

If you are ok with eating things without knowing what is in them, this place might be fine. If, like most humans, you prefer to know what your are spending your money on and putting into your body, my advice is to avoid this place.

And if you are from Red Bowl and would like to know which manager it was that was so rude, I can't tell you because he never introduced himself and wasn't wearing a name tag. I can tell you that this unfortunate lunch took place on 4-2-15 at 1:30pm."}
{"text":"So I have been here a million times, not literally. They used to have the half off sushi after 8pm, but got rid of that recently. The food quality is good, service  8 out of 10 times is completely terrible during, dinner especially even when it's dead, lunch is usually pretty good. We usually come with friends so we can stand the service while we are waiting, if you come with you significant other only, you will be quite frustrated. Overall, food and service could step it up."}
{"text":"Got a to go order with our office. I got the bang bang shrimp and a side of white steamed rice. Shrimp was large Sauce was good. More of a sweet flavor. Rice was good and not dry. Our order was correct and we had no complaints!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Good deals and friendly staff! 100% will come again! The atmosphere is very quiet and beautiful christian music playing."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this resturaunt for a few reasons. First, the atmosphere is really nice and I would go there for a nice family dinner. Also, the wait staff was very friendly and made very nice suggestions when I asked them what to order. 

I ordered the shrimp hibachi with fried rice and loved it! I was especially fond of the \"yum yum\" sauce that accompanied it. They have large portions and were always quick to refill my hot tea. 

There were lots of popular Asian dishes on the menu and I was impressed by the presentation of the dishes. I will come back for sure."}
{"text":"i just went here for the first time like 3 days ago and it was ok. i only checked it out because i saw their commercial a million times! lol the food was pretty good i just wish they had pictures on their menus or people that could explain what things are because i didn't know what half the stuff on the menu was. 
then a fly flew into my dipping sauce and i was totally grossed out and ready to leave. i hate bugs....."}
{"text":"The service and management is disgusting * rude, ignorant and arrogant! Avoid since management feel so ignorant of the customer. Far better food and service elsewhere. Exactly the same order is $20 cheaper elsewhere than this place * pricing is extortion!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my food. There was big portions for the price. The staff was really friendly. Our drinks didn't take too long to be filled but then again we were the only ones there because we had an early dinner so I'm not too sure about the attentiveness. The price is about average I feel considering the size and the area we are located. The only downside is that they do not have a sushi menu. I was so disappointed in that because all the red bowls I've been to before had sushi."}
{"text":"Tried to give this place another try and once again...disappointed...daughter (7yr old) wanted to get chicken lo mien with nothing but noodles, chicken, and broccoli and informed that the broccoli is $1 extra. Do we get credit for the 4 other vegetables we took off?? Then I got a meal asked what kind of rice and I said brown and was informed that would be $1 extra. I've been to Red Bowls all over state and never charged extra for rice! Of they're loosing money then close it down!"}
{"text":"Probably the best Chinese food I've ever had. That sounds like hyperbole, but I've eaten that a great number of Chinese restaurants and none have ever compared to the quality and quantity of food. Some of my favorite dishes are the Thai green curry chicken, the orange peel chicken, the sweet and sour chicken, and the bourbon chicken. All of these are amazing. Also, the egg rolls are some of the best that I've ever had. I could make a meal on a half a dozen of those and be perfectly fine. I've always felt it was hard to find a very good Chinese restaurant, one without paying through the nose for it. This is it!"}
{"text":"Good food, chicken cooked well. Not too tough, not too chewy. I placed an order for takeout and got it in a timely manner, but I could barely understand what the person taking my order was saying. So one star off for that. Otherwise, great."}
{"text":"Read several scathing reviews but one of our lunch foursome wanted to try it. I went with an open mind which was soon closed. The wonton egg drop soup was THE worst I've ever eaten, and I've eaten a lot of the stuff. Completely tasteless. I added soy sauce and hot sauce, it still tasted like dish water. Oh well on to the main course of beef, chicken, shrimp, veggies and fried rice. The fried rice, also won a prize for worst-in-a-lifetime. Lots of it, but, big servings of lousy food are still lousy. Place seemed clean, waitstaff OK and very speedy service. In the end, it beats starving but only by a nose. Usually I give places a second try, not this one. Wifey agrees. We did have a great time with our friends who seemed okay with the place so, reluctantly, I added a second star."}
{"text":"If I'm in the mood for chinese/japanese this is my spot! I love the teriyaki chicken and the hot & sour soup is great! The staff is always very nice and professional."}
{"text":"We had a great meal and a great time. We started with the calamari appetizer and things just kept getting better. All good,,and we ll definitely return!"}
{"text":"Restaurant atmosphere was very comfortable, owner was super nice, but food was less than desirable. We had Scallion Chicken and Spicy Orange Chicken. Instead of pure white chicken, both had a fatty, mystery-meat like taste and consistancy. The fried rice was flavorless. All in all, and for the price, very dissapointing. :("}
{"text":"I eat red bowl about once a month for lunch since it is right by work. They have great quality food and they are super fast. Can dine in and out quick too. I always order the hunan beef lunch special that comes with an egg roll. Good Chinese food, fast service, reasonable prices."}
{"text":"The food very consistently good. I love the spring rolls and the pad Thai the same better than a lot of Thai restaurants."}
{"text":"Was taken to Red Bowl a while back and I wanted to write this review so I could place it into my \"sushi\" list.  ehehehe!

I was pleasantly surprised when we were told that after 8 pm on a Friday night that our sushi was HALF OFF!  I'm not sure if they do that now, but I think they still do!  After 8 pm, all sush rolls are 1/2 price as long as the table as a whole orders two drinks!  We had 5 ppl total and I got a Pinot and another person got a coke!  It was a great experience!!  Sushi was excellent and will definatly be back!"}
{"text":"Usually I love this restaurant. Today (Mothers Day), we went in for lunch, like every Sunday, and they placed a sign in the window that they are serving dinner all day for Mother's Day. That's larger portions, which we didn't want and $4 more per entray. How is that a special?? We ended up walking out since the manager wouldn't let us order off the lunch menu.  Manager, if you're changing it for a holiday, make it a better deal, like dinner at lunch price..."}
{"text":"Very pricey for ok chinese food. Tables and menus were sticky to the touch!
Wait staff didn't speak or understand English well at all.
They do not have beer or wine on Sundays.  Would not let me substitute brown rice for white rice which came with the meal. 
Hostess cleaned windows and doors during our dinner, making the air thick with disinfectant which ruined the meal further.  
Thankfully my company was good!"}
{"text":"I have had food from here before that has been good enough but tonight I got takeout and was extremely disappointed.  I had the garlic chicken and it was flavorless and the vegetables barely cooked. I also got a side of lo mein and perhaps it's my fault for assuming it would have something more than just noodles.... no veggies or anything... I got there in the time he told me it would take and the food was cold.  There were no sauces in the bag and worst of all, no fortune cookie!  I ended up throwing it all away after trying a few bites of everything."}
{"text":"Make the drive to the one in Rock Hill rather than stopping at this one. You can really tell once you walk in that they aren't doing to well, customer wise. They have so many lunch specials and other things to draw you in, but it's just sub-par overall. 

I ordered the cashew chicken (which I get at the rock hill location too) and the presentation was fine, but the food wasn't even hot. Very lukewarm, which makes you wonder when it comes out so fast. I explained this to my server and she just said \"no, it's hot\" and walked away. She then came back moments after delivering my food with my bill and box. Certainly felt rushed with that! 

They also don't serve sushi at this location, which is devastating. 

With so many other restaurants in this shopping complex, you're better off skipping this place completely."}
{"text":"5 adults 2 teenages for dinner on 3/25/2016.  All placed orders, normal wait for food and 6 of 7 dinners come out.  Waiter came back to table to apologize as last order was not prepared with the others.  Told waiter to tell manager to take 7th dinner off the bill and to pack the food to go.  Found out at home(took 2 cars) that manager came over to ask how meal was and he was told about the problem.  As the waiter brings over the 7th meal the manager says, your food is here now.  He should have been kissing our a** with apologies and he says that.  Johnny Red Bowl change your name to Fredo.  You are dead to me."}
{"text":"OK, takeout from Red Bowl has been in the meal rotation for our house for a couple of years now. Tonight we decided to assess their performance, because their are many good Asian alternatives in the area.
We looked up the menu online and placed an order by phone. When I got there, there was some hassle because the payment process is different for phone-in takeout vs. if you sit at the bar, have a beer, and order takeout. They have a decent beer selection, so I had to pay twice.
The consensus on the food: the sushi is below grocery store quality (and its puny - see pic), the soup and pad Thai are decent, if you ask for any dish to be extra spicy it will be mildly spicy, and my son likes the fried rice. The bottom line is that there are too many good Asian food choices down here now to settle for mediocre. Next time we will go back to Asian Grill in Waxhaw or Asian 18 in Blakeney."}
{"text":"I have been here several times and it was ok, unfortunately tonight's poor experience outweighs that.  Sushi was \"ok\", but our entrées were not good at all. Our waitress was nice but not attentive at all. Although we arrived an hour and 1/2 before close we felt like we were rushed out. Also, the place was freezing."}
{"text":"I've never been one to give a restaurant a bad review but this being my first time I got very bad service. That's all I can say cause I'm really frustrated with the service I'm getting right now."}
{"text":"No matter how many restaurants move into the Fort Mill area, Red Bowl will always be a staple. The menu has a wide variety of Asian cuisine, and the quality of the food is pretty consistent. Their sushi menu is extensive and I've never been disappointed after ordering a roll I had never tried before. One of the best features of the menu is the \"bento box\", which allows you to choose from a wide array of options and customize your meal. If you decide to order a dinner entree, then be prepared to ask for a to-go box because the portions are generous!"}
{"text":"We love Red Bowl!!
We order the delicious flower chicken every time. Plenty of chicken and fresh vegetables! They have the best spring rolls in Charlotte! Always a great place to eat or take out!
Adam"}
{"text":"I've got to admit I was afraid to come here after reading the reviews but I brought my friends because I had been before and I remember it being good. Glad we did because we had a 10 minute wait and a delicious meal for a great price! 

$5 starting lunch specials. Sushi options, drinks, bento box, and menu options. Lots to choose from! We had (2) $5 lunch options, the Spicy Basil Shrimp and (2) $6.55 options the \"Bang Bang Shrimp\" which each came with spring roll or egg roll plus your choice of rice: white, brown, or fried.

The server seemed overwhelmed a bit but he was on our drink refills and the food order was quick to come out. It was hot, delicious, and everyone was happy!

This is definitely your Americanized Chinese food so keep that in mind if you're wanting something more authentic; not here. Yummy I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I stand by these stars. The servers are friendly.  The atmosphere is relaxing and modern. The restaurant appears very clean.

The sushi is tasty. Shared a philly roll with my husband and had the red bowl roll as my entree'. So good! The wonton soup had fresh made noodles in the soup, and fresh crisp fried wontons to grace the soup. 

Love the potstickers! A hit every time.  Recommend."}
{"text":"Went for dinner about a month ago and the food was all fantastic, but canot afford it on a regular basis.  Service was average. Surroundings retro look."}
{"text":"Wow just stopped in for a quick drink at the bar and the bartender still hasn't greeted me. She's very very busy on her cell phone. Thank God the Chinese lady served me. Not going to be back here anytime soon......... So rude"}
{"text":"Good for families and the prices are really good. We've eaten in and carried out both where good. 

The portions are large if you are not overly hungry you can split the meal and still get what you need."}
{"text":"Nope. Nope.

The staff is great,  they are helpful and sweet. The restaurant appeared clean.  But the food... no.

I ordered the Spicy Thai Red Curry with shrimp. According to the menu this comes with red pepper, onion, potato and zucchini in spicy curry sauce. These were all on the plate... they just tasted gross. The vegetables tasted like frozen that had been heated. The potatoes were disturbing... they BENT. I pressed a potato onto the plate and it didn't rip or break apart, it BENT.... potatoes shouldn't bend. The spicy sauce wasn't really spicy either. The rice was mushy and over cooked. 

It wasn't inedible, but I wouldn't return here. Honestly I've had microwaveable dinners that tasted better."}
{"text":"Typical take out Chinese food nothing special. Food ok at best. Really friendly staff."}
{"text":"I was excited for another Asian restaurant in Solon so we stopped in one night. We won't go back. We did not enjoy our meal. My husband thought his food was ok, but I didn't care for mine. But the place is dirty and that's a deal breaker for me. Also, the service wasn't very good."}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time until they switched the manager. The new manager was a Chinese dude who seriously need to learn better customer service and hygiene ( for heaven sake he sneezed into his hands and didn't even wash it!). I'm very disappointed on how they cook their foods, the waiter there need to know what he need to do because he seriously was very confuse on all of the orders.  I truly hope that they'll will be better, but for now I think I won't be going there anymore."}
{"text":"Really wanted Koumi today but forgot they are closed on Mondays. I didn't remember this until after I had already gotten three of my coworkers orders for Koumi. When I realized they were closed I called Red Bowl because it's close and they too offer hibatchi. Every one of these dishes were disgusting, and I'm not saying that for dramatics. Two of us had chicken, one had steak and I had steak and shrimp. The rice was mushy, the steak was dry flavorless and so chewy my teeth still hurt. The chicken was covered in black pepper and still bland. These meals smelled as though prepared in old oil. We literally ate the veggies out of the boxes and threw the meals in the trash. That's $40 plus out the window...or should I say in the trash can. I do not recommend them for hibatchi. Totally NOT worth it!"}
{"text":"Tucked into the back corner of Promenade is Johnny's Red Bowl Asian Fusion place.  The atmosphere is quasi-industrial with the high ceilings and exposed duct work.  Friendly staff, clean, nice place.

The food is also acceptable.  It's a small step above the Chinese food place where you stop on your way home from work, but I wouldn't put it up there with a P.F. Changs.  

The biggest issue I take with this place is the value.  It's rather pricey ($11-$15) per dish, and the quality just isn't that much above some of the other Chinese places close by.  It's like they added a nicer restaurant, slapped on a higher price tag, and serve the same ole food."}
{"text":"We ordered takeout from Red Bowl last night.  Everything was delicious!  I had Sesame Chicken and Pork Dumplings.  Very fresh, very flavorful, we are so happy to find a new place for great Asian food.  Can't wait to eat here again!"}
{"text":"Delicious. The Margarita are hand shaken and the best I have had. I always ask for extra spicy garlic shrimp. The shrimp are fresh and plump and the vegetables are crisp. The service is friendly and paced well."}
{"text":"Quality varies from delicious to uneatable. The scallops with garlic sauce was cold. The scallops were raw. The shrimp curry was bland with potatoes and shrimp tasting the same. Tables was cleared but not wiped."}
{"text":"I would have to say that the only experience I ever had at this restaurant was not pleasant. The wait staff was very inattentive and somewhat cold and abrupt. The place didn't seem very clean and none of us at my table of five were very pleased with her food. We figured that since that been in business for a while they would have maybe perfected some of the beginning issues, but apparently they still hadn't gotten it right so we will not be returning or recommending this is a good restaurant as it would be a reflection on our taste."}
{"text":"If I could give a zero I would. First off the waitress forgot about us, we sat waiting 20 minutes, finally I went to the counter and got her, she was eating. The food was absolutely disgusting everything was dry and tasted nasty. Even after the waiting and the taste of the food they did not take anything off the bill. I knew we shouldn't have eaten here, after what everyone has said about the place. The only reason I went here was because Takara was closed. Stay away from Red bowl. Takara is amazing!!!"}
{"text":"The place is terrible for many reasons. I tried it four separate occasions. Management is retarded, food is below average, and I hope they lose business. 

Never have I seen a restaurant tell me what I can order - I'm paying money for custom meal you had better be smart enough to accept my money. Never again."}
{"text":"It took FOREVER for us to get our sushi and the owner was mean to our waitress. When we finally got sushi it did taste good."}
{"text":"This place has moved over to the Siskey y area in the Publix Shopping Center. I gave it a try tonight. I give it 3 mehs. I had sushi a fancy roll for $16 that was sparse and not great. I had a $5 California roll that tasted thawed. My wife had chicken lo mein it was chicken and lo mein not horrible but not a single vegetable mixed in there. A real shame this used to be a really good place in its old location by Fresh Market. The new owners seem to think if you open the doors and turn on the lights people will come. But there are too many great places to go to ever go back to a mediocre place."}
{"text":"The quality of this place food has diminished. I am meeting a client around Solon today and decided I want some vegetable fried rice.  The rice is very salty. I will not return."}
{"text":"Good food and good sushi. Pad Thai is good and portions are generous especially at dinner."}
{"text":"I've heard of Red Bowl before and have been to several but this place in Monroe is probably my favorite, the owners are just incredibly nice. They play popular Christian music and its just awesome I think. I've had everything from the sushi to the specialty dinners. Everything is just great quality and taste I particularly love the Mongolian beef that's absolutely one of my favorites. So if you're in Monroe and you want a great atmosphere, great food, and friendly staff you should check out Red Bowl it's right there at Monroe mall, you can see it from the main road."}
{"text":"Honestly, sushi is overpriced and mediocre. I am a sushi fanatic and have been to every place around town and this one is my least favorite. Akahana has better sushi, pricing and taste. Also if you want to do the BOGO free sushi you CANT get it to go AND You HAVE to buy a drink to receive the deal, As other places they will still honor the free sushi and don't require drink purchase. 

LASTLY, my mother got the pork and it was PURE FAT. Tasted terrible and was gross. She then ordered green curry chicken and they served her RED curry. This place is just mediocre. 

UPDATE: SINCE THIS REVIEW... I was personally attacked by the GENERAL MANAGERS DAUGHTER, and the general manager. How disgustingly unprofessional. Not only do I not recommend the food, now GM  daughter will attack you on Facebook for a bad review. 

I will name no names but I am still
shocked at how disgusting the customer service is."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years because I love it so much! Their good is soooo good! I always get teriyaki chicken stir fry and it always is fantastic. They also have great spring rolls and lo mein. If you ever are in the mood for dessert, try their key lime pie! It's amazing!!"}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times, it's been great every time. I absolutely love their ginger salad dressing.
I have gotten sushi each time, and it has been great!"}
