{"text":"What a real gem in Scarborough. Nice atmosphere, friendly staff. Great decor. My son is vegetarian so the waitress gave us tons of veggie options for him. She was very attentive to our needs. Highly recommended, will definitely go again."}
{"text":"Disappointed. The Keg has been a staple for several events over the years and has generally resulted in a good experience. This time, at this location, complete failure. The reason they got 2 stars was because the waitress saved them from a zero. Despite being super busy she was delightful and professional. 

The issue began with poor management of our party of ten. Called ahead of time to ask for reservations but was told they don't accept them but we'll be 'expecting you' and thus be expedited reasonable quick. Without gettimg into the aggravating details it was 1hr 15min wait.  Each time we asked after 30 min we were told the table is being set up - clearly a stall tactic.  I was fully prepared to leave but didn't want to ruin our guest's birthday who was looking forward to her meal. 

Generally speaking the meals were good but not excellent. Several steaks were cooked incorrectly which resulted in lots of plate swapping. Luckily we all ordered similar dishes. 

Lesson for management, set accurate expectations. As a patron i will make an informed decision that i may not like to make but at least i know what to expect. 

Future lesson for me when im dropping in excess of $500 for dinner? reservations."}
{"text":"With the Keg, you can never go wrong.  Sirloin Oscar is my regular go to and bf chose the ribeye. I now know the ribeye is my go to, no thinker selection.  Great meal.  The service was flat. Not memorable. The waitress did her job but it took a while before she came back to our table to get our order for the drinks and meal."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best chain steak houses. If you're willing to dish out the cash, then you won't be disappointed. Our waitress, Daniella was amazing and catered to our every need. I had the chipotle top sirloin an was not disappointed, although it could have been warmer(warm, not hot). Overall very good atmosphere, staff and most importantly food. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"Family went here last night to celebrate my daughter's birthday. The staff who waited for us, her name is Natalie and she was awesome and really took care of us.  Super friendly and of course the food is superb.  My daughter was very happy.  Will come again for sure."}
{"text":"We took our sister and her husband for an anniversary and the service was excellent. The young lady (curly light reddish hair). who took care of our party of eight was very pleasant, a true professional and the service flowed perfectly.  I recommend the wedge salad - my absolute favourite at The Keg. Prime rib was not bad and potato delicious. A good night out."}
{"text":"Just enjoyed my birthday dinner at the keg in Scarborough.  As usual the steaks were delicious but what really made the meal an extraordinary one was our server Rebecca.  She was quick, intuitive, friendly and very very professional. If you go to this location ask to sit in Rebecca's section. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Food and service was very good but ambiance was poor. Music was awful and far too loud. Heavy metal screaming really? Had reserved weeks in advance for a \"quiet\" spot for a 90th birthday. Quite the opposite, directly adjacent to the speaker system and all the noise. 

I had mentioned it was for a 90th birthday but did not ask for any birthday celebration. They brought out Billy Miner pie, nice but spoiled the celebration we had planned at home. Please ask if folks want this before you just do this. Not what we wanted and with this and the noise it really ruined the 90th birthday celebration.

Can't see any reason to visit any Keg again as it just isn't the sophisticated pleasant experience it used to be. Long time patron, never to return."}
{"text":"I am not easily bowled over by restaurants , but this is the second Keg I have eaten at in a year, and they are at the top of the list!
From the time you walk in the door , you are treated like royalty..with suggestions for drinks(even being patient when you can't decide between a Lemon Meringue or a drink you can only remember the ingredients!) suggestions for appetizers, even telling you about the fresh, warm bread with 3 chees butter!
Even if you have to wait(weekends, no reservations are taken) there is a lovely bar area you can order drinks and appetizers...
All choices were cooked perfectly, from steaks to shrimp...and desserts are a must--just share!! their specialty pie has to be tried!
Again, it is a chain, but you would never know it, for each one is unique!"}
{"text":"I went here with my mom, my boyfriend and little sister because we had gotten a giftcard for christmas. Boy am I glad we went!!! There was a wait of about 25 minutes, but our estimated time was 45-55 and we went at 6:45 on a Saturday evening...our fault. They did their best to get us a booth as quick as possible. Our group ordered a lot of food so I feel as if we got a pretty good overview of what this keg had to offer. 
Me and my boyfriend started off with the neptune appetizer, which consisted of button mushrooms, cream cheese, crab meat all mixed together and served warm. It was VERY good but VERY rich. With it came fresssshhhhhh (I MEAN STILL WARM!!!) bread, all your wanted (we got 2 refills). 
All the adults got drinks, I opted for a kiwi-tini at the suggestion of our lovely waiter and it was certainly interested, I really enjoyed it and found it throughly refreshing. My mom got wine and the boyfriend rye and coke, both of which were upgraded \"keg size\" (it had been a long day haha). 
We ordered our mains, I got the steak with crab meat, cream sauce and mushrooms mixed with a drizzle of dijon and mashed potatoes. My mom got the roasted red pepper sauce steak, and my boyfriend got the prime rib. My steak was cooked PERFECTLY, I mean amazing, I couldn't stop eating. My boyfriend was throughly impressed as well his prime rib was almost as big as his plate. Both of us got a mountain of yummy creamy potatoes. Weopted to order a side of aspargus for the table, which we were impressed with because we got almost an entire bushel and it was cooked perfectly. 
We were too fully for desert but maybe next time as I plan to return. Our waiter was great, always willing to offer suggestions and very attnentive without hovering. 
This is a wonderful keg and would be good for any party large or small (just make sure you get their early!!)
N.B. They don't take reservations on the weekends!"}
{"text":"My favourite keg! 

Food and service is typically great and if not, let them know and they will make sure you are satisfied!

Ambience is great, love their filet mignon, prime rib, mashed potatoes, escargots, mushroom caps, French onion soup, and their Caesars! Don't forget to order the billy milner pie for dessert! It's delicious!"}
{"text":"Have been to this location a few times now and food has always been awesome! I recommend the baked brie with pesto and red pepper jelly! goes great with the white sangria! Services has always been more than amazing! They take their time and talk with you and really try to make every experience, unique and special. The only downside I would have to say is the parking lot is very tight when its busy. Other than that my boyfriend and I love this place!"}
{"text":"Ordered a hefty steak and lobster combo with a side of butter to dip the lobster into. Was pleasantly surprised by the service and quality of food. Came in hungry, left full and satisfied - what more could you ask for! Although I'm sure there are tonnes of other great steak and lobster places, this place does the trick for me and the prices seem reasonable as other upscale places you find downtown or so. Other than that, I'd probably come back for sure!"}
{"text":"I arrived at this location and immediately had a \"welcome to Scarborough moment\" as some guy ran in front of my car to hold the parking spot for his friend, even though his friend was no where to be found. After this stressful entrance, I went into the restaurant to meet my friends. 

We had a big table in a location where there wasn't supposed to be a large table. They blocked a booth to put our table where it was and it was a tight squeeze for the employees to get through to reach the other tables. 

With that being said, the service revived was fantastic! We had a really great waitress helping us, who helped me place my gluten and dairy free order. I decided on the cauliflower steak, since I really wanted vegetables and I added a side of muscles wrapped in bacon and french fries. This was definitely a nice meal when I added all of the sides. 

It was really delicious and flavourful. It took me a while to place my order because the waitress told me people don't usually enjoy the cauliflower steak. Once it arrived, I was really glad I chose this as my main since it was scrumptious. It gave me all the veggies I needed and more. The dish arrived with a tapenade on top and a bed of asparagus. Everything was made perfectly!

My friends also enjoyed their meals. Everyone ordered appetizers like the cheesy garlic bread and jumbo shrimp to start. Then most people ordered steak and everyone seemed happy with their orders. 

I would definitely return to the Keg but I might opt for another location closer to home with fewer parking issues and better mannered guests."}
{"text":"I've been to this location twice and both times were great!  The second time had dinner here and the food was great!  Only a minor issue is that my steak was a tad bit cooked beyond medium well.  I liked their drinks with respect to bar menu too, personally love the Cremore Springs Lager :D.  The ambiance of the place is nice and a great place to go with great company!"}
{"text":"I came here with my coworkers for a work dinner and service was great! Our waitress was very sweet and patient with us. Everything except the main course was great. Salad and appetizers were so delicious, there is nothing bad to say about it.

I gave them only four stars because it took almost two hours for our main course to come out. Two hours!!! At that point, we were all getting hangry, and you don't wanna have three hangry girls around in one place. When our food finally came, my plate of steak and lobster was at best Luke warm. Who like luke warm steak? Not me. My friends steak was COVERED in pepper corn, she couldn't even eat it. The lobster was good though, but it was hot so it felt like they left it out for too long and served it. 

Dessert was fantastic, I definitely recommend their ice cream cake. They also have steaks larger than their largest size as stated on their menu, you just have to request it. It does not cone with another veggies on the side tho, which looked bland but I assume is still delicious."}
{"text":"Wonderful prime rib!  This is a wonderful experience. Trying Organic Mill St. Lager biere. Good choice."}
{"text":"The Keg is one of those chains that does things right. They have a core menu centred on beef and have modified it over the years to stay current and attractive. Personally, I usually prefer more independent restaurants, but The Keg is a reliable and excellent place to get a good meal.
I have been to this location several times. Pet peeve - they do not take reservations after 5 pm, so it is first come first served and that can be dicey on certain days.
The staff here have always been very friendly, knowledgeable and professional. The wine list offers quite a good selection of well priced wines. Prices are reasonable, especially for the quality of the meal.
For years The Keg has been one of my go-to places when I can' t find, or are too tired to look for, something more interesting. It is reliable, the value is there for the money, and there is something for everybody on the menu."}
{"text":"An unbelievably bad meal tonight. Ice cold fries, four spears of asparagus that also were cold, and the worst ribs I've ever had. Overcooked and dry, with almost no edible meat on the bones. $39 with tax and tip! Never again."}
{"text":"My partner and I have eaten here on many occasions. Have to admit the service each time was courteous and efficient. The food and drink menu is always great and well done which is the reason we frequent this location. If you come to this location after 5:30pm it becomes quite busy and you will be waiting for a bit to be seated if you want the dining rm. There ahi tuna tare tare is really good with fresh avacodo and fresh made pita chips.  Always a sucker for their steak and lobster tail combo along with their  garlic mashed potato. Their drink menu has a lot of the cocktails  I enjoy and some modern twists of the old classics. Overall a fav of mine when I want a perfect night out
Cheers Keg.. keep up the great work!!!!"}
{"text":"We went here for my wonderful boyfriend's belated birthday for dinner and our experience was excellent.  I ordered the sirloin oscar which came with shrimp, scallop and asparagus topped with some white creamy sauce and it was REALLY good.  My BF ordered sirloin & lobster and it was excellently done - both were cooked to perfection the way we liked and the lobster was the best I ever had anywhere.  The only request I would choose for next time is to have the sauce for my dish to either be on the side or put only half the amount because it was too rich and creamy for my liking.

The only thing I would have liked was if it the lighting was a bit brighter but I do understand the atmosphere and ambience they are trying to create.  We sat at a 2 seat table and was bit tight but no complains as it just felt more intimate.  Our server was great, can't remember his name but he was friendly and prompt with his service.

Can't wait to go back.  This overall food, atmosphere and experience gets 5 stars."}
{"text":"The keg has always been a go-to whenever I'm craving steak. This time I got the peppercorn steak (12 ounces) with baked potato on the side. To be honest I regret not getting the garlic mash potato. The baked potato didn't do much for me.

We also had the calamari and bacon wrapped scallops for appetizers. Both were really great choices! I appreciated the scallops being large and flavourful. After all the food, if you are still craving dessert, the keg has $3 brownie with a scoop of ice cream. 

The service at this location was also pretty good. We were seated promptly, and food came out in a timely manner."}
{"text":"If you feel like steak, go elsewhere.  

First of all the room was so loud, conversation was very difficult, people had to almost yell across tables to be heard. 

Second, the menu is sirloin, sirloin, sirloin, sirloin, sirloin... and oh BTW here's a filet and a rib steak.  Any restaurant that wants to call itself a \"steakhouse\" needs to serve a lot more variety than just \"sirloin 10 ways\".

Third, staff are incompetent.  I ordered a 20 oz rib steak, medium, but when our table of 6 was served, after the other 5 got their correct orders I was served a rare slab of prime rib.  It took 5 minutes before the server came over to find out I had the wrong dinner served, and another 20 after that before my correct dinner was delivered.  So that meant 25 minutes (finishing up the free bread...) waiting while the rest of the table almost finished their dinner.  And even then, when I got my rib steak it was medium-rare rather than medium (quite red and bloody in the centre), but I was \"hangry\" enough to not want to wait another 25 minutes for them to fix that error."}
{"text":"Older location with dated decor, but the food and wait staff was amazing! You would think that all locations have the same quality, but that is not the case. Rather than go to the closer location at Yonge and Eglinton (which we find to have to lowest food quality), we ventured far far away on one of the most treacherous driving evenings of December 2015, this location was not a disappointment!"}
{"text":"Second visit in a month.
This location is not as nice as the one close to the airport, also a bit less crowded.
The food is outstanding with a great meat quality. 
The waiter was knowledgeable and capable.
Peppercorn NY steak is my favorite."}
{"text":"Really disappointed! First time here was excellent. Second time...not so good. Slow service. Our server didn't pay attention to us at all. Didn't offer us bread. Not upbeat or happy. We had to ask for bread after eating our appetizer, 30 minutes in. She didn't check on us throughout the evening. Food was cold. Manger was walking around, but didn't ask how we were or introduced herself. Servers looked understaffed. I blame management for our bismol evening."}
{"text":"Every time there's a celebration I tend to pick the keg. Why? Because of the cake. YOU MUST GET THE BILLY MINER CAKE. It's complimentary when you're celebrating something at the restaurant which is awesome. Thus the keg wins in my book for this reason. 

As for steak. I will recommend two things - rib steak and prime rib. Of course other kegs do a better job than others. I personally haven't really had a bad experience at this one but I have had others that I've had a more mediocre experience. I tend to go with my family so we always end up a table of six and the service we get is usually amazing. I can't say I have any complaints! 

Can't wait until the next celebration !"}
{"text":"This Keg is incredible, from the food to the servers. Everything is fabulous! They treat you like a queen and king. Won't go to the Keg on Leslie ever again, it sucks!"}
{"text":"Love the Keg. Usually go to this location because the 1 on Leslie is a bit too upper class for me lol. 
  If you plan on going on a Saturday night go early of make reservations."}
{"text":"Another wonderful dining experience at The Keg.  Serviced was outstanding.  Attentive and funny was the waiter.  Food was plentiful and well prepared.  Everyone enjoyed their meal.  Big brother was celebrating his 60th birthday.  The perfect place that pretty much guarantees the perfect evening."}
{"text":"The food is great. The staff is friendly. I've been going to this location for almost 8 years and everything had been up to par. I've been to other keg locations and this location beats them all."}
{"text":"We typically never eat at The Keg unless we've received a gift card from someone.  I don't find their prices to be in line with the quality of their food.

We went there last night (yes, to finish up a gift certificate) and arrived around 6:30pm. We were seated immediately (which surprised me) and the service was quick and friendly, as always.

Their Dungeness Crab menu was still on (see previous review for The Keg in Niagara Falls) so this time I figured I'd try the Dungeness Crab and Shrimp Sirloin.  Sirloin steak covered in Dungeness Crab meat, Black Tiger Shrimp and Bearnaise sauce. The dish is served with asparagus and your choice of accompaniment (I chose the garlic mash).

Side Note: I should have stuck with the Sirloin and Dungeness Crab dish that I had in Niagara Falls. Sure there's more work to get at the crab meat but it tasted a lot better.

With the Crab and Shrimp Sirloin, the crab meat is removed from the shell leaving it to have a shredded texture, which isn't pleasant to say the least!  It's as though you're getting leftover scraps of meat. On top of the crab meat lay two Tiger Shrimp and the whole lot received a 'drizzling' of Bearnaise sauce... and I mean a drizzling; I actually had to ask for more on the side.  The sauce was definitely the saving grace for this dish... absolutely delicious!

And as far as how they cook a steak? They used to be bang on in that area but now, when I order Medium Rare I've ended up with everything from Blue to Medium. Now I'm okay receiving a steak that a good veterinarian could bring back to life but in my opinion, cooking a steak to Medium renders all the flavour from it. 

But I digress... the steak I received last night was cooked to a perfect Medium Rare but wasn't very flavourful.  I've had better tasting Sirloin's from Loblaws.

As always, the veg and mash were cooked perfectly but over all, it wasn't one of my favourite dishes and I won't order it again.  This dish is very similar to the Sirloin Oscar (only with crab meat instead of scallops) and in my opinion, the Oscar is the better dish of the two if you're looking to have that rich creamy Bearnaise sauce and seafood with your steak."}
{"text":"I love a good steak. My preference is Filet Mignon and honestly I don't come to The Keg for dinner. There are so many good steakhouses in Toronto. I come here for dessert. 

Some might think that's weird. Why would you go to an average steakhouse for dessert. Well the Billy Miner Pie is the reason. This is probably one of the best Ice Cream Cakes I've ever had. I wish I could buy the whole cake. 

The Billy Miner Pie is a Mocha ice cream on a chocolate crust with hot fudge, caramel and almonds. FUCK.... it is Amazing. Everything is perfect and works well together. With each bite you get the mocha ice cream and chocolate crust. 

Want to Win that second date? Come here for dessert! You won't regret it. 

Keep Eating, 

Angela"}
{"text":"This is the second time visit. Food and service are fantastic as usual. There was a long wait, the guy told us probably would be 35-40 mins wait but we actually waited for about 20 mins. Our server is Tatiana/Tasha ( sorry bad memory) she is so friendly and kind. Working in customer service as myself, I really think she did a great job! She also recommended us about the special today, the way she presented really convinced us! Food is good as always."}
{"text":"yep, a ok.  service was not all that great.  the food was okay also.  two times the waiting staff forgot to get us something.  two glasses of warm water and then my innnocent glass of coke.  it was busy but they had a ton of waiting staff running around.  also twice i heard plates being dropped on the floor.  i have never ever heard plates being dropped by staff members during dinner time.  i don't think that i got all that band for my buck for the food we got served.  very little vegetables came with our meals.    this will be my last time going to the keg."}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday night for my mom's birthday. The ambience was nice with music in the background. It was well lit and the decor was suitable. Our waitress was mostly attentive throughout the evening. We ordered the bacon wrapped scallops as an apetizer followed by a filet mignon and new York strip to share for the 3 of us. Our food came out within a reasonable time frame. The appetizer was delicious with the right amount of seasoning and the scallops were very juicy. Both of our steaks were cooked correctly according to our order. However, the twice baked potato just didn't do it for any of us. Maybe we'll try it with just the mashed potatoes next time. For dessert, I had the mini mango crème brûlée that was just $3! These weren't made to order as it was very cold when brought to my table. However, still okay for the price! 

Overall, I'd definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"I find that many people go to The Keg when its a special occasion like birthdays, anniversaries, etc. And the reason for this is probably the price. Don't get me wrong. I might be Asian but I ain't cheap, especially when it comes to food. Most items on the menu are over $25 for one main dish. When you factor in the appetizer, dessert, tax and tips its more like $50 bucks per person and if you are in a relationship then the guy usually does the paying so its more like $100 bucks for a 2 person meal and that is pretty pricy for one meal. 

Having said all that I really did enjoy my night at The Keg. Ambiance is really nice and service is top notch. The meal comes with complimentary bread and butter but I still had to try the cheese bread which was amazing. For $6 this was probably the best deal of the night. Bread was crispy, cheese was nice and gooey and the garlic flavor put it over the top.

For the main I got the 10 oz fillet minion with bake potato. Really yummy and no complaints here. Soft, juicy and tender but a bit on the salty side. The baked potato was seasoned with all kinds of stuff which brought out my taste buds. Not too bad for $35. Also got the 7 oz sirloin with scallops and shrimps plus mash potatoes. The meat was a bit tough and also a bit too salty. $30

Overall very good food experience but its hard talking myself into spending $50 for one meal. I guess this place will be one of those special occasion type of meals.

3.5 stars"}
{"text":"5 stars for the service. Rebecca was wonderful, smart, fast and very knowledgable about the menu. 
We were a large party of 7, my sisters birthday and she was such a great server! Even my verrrry hard to please mother was impressed. 
The entire table enjoyed their meal and dessert was delicious! 
But really, the entire meal was made fantastic because we had such great service."}
{"text":"great place with casual style, you know some steak house fills with formal dress and formal dining type. this one is like a casual dining (like the outback) but the meals is just way much better.
if you get your steak done right, everything else don't matter.
asked for a fillet mignon medium rare, no crust and warm red inside.  perfect.
service is on the slow side, because the place was pack.
salad was great and other stuff. awesome.
will be back for more food on this place."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a really long time I ordered the prime rib with red wine sauce. The steak was perfectly cooked and for appeters we ordered calamari with a sweet chilli sauce absolutely delicous and the waitress was super nice and always attentive. The prime rib with red wine sauce  had a very unique taste kind of sweet and savory flavor. The Billy miner pie is one of the best ice cream cakes I ever had in my life if you have a anniversary or birthday Billy miner pie is on the hosue if not it's 6 bucks which is not bad because it is freaking huge. For occasions it is definetly a place to go because the steaks are just has good as the elite steak houses"}
{"text":"My new favourite Keg restaurant. Came here last night for our anniversary and despite it being super busy with a graduation on a Wednesday night the service was exceptional. Our waitress (Teya) was on point, super friendly and went out of her way to accommodate us. The manager came over to wish us a happy anniversary with some complimentary glasses of champagne. Didn't get his name, but super nice guy. 

Staff here make the difference, will be back for sure."}
{"text":"The wait to get seated was long because I came here on the weekend. The food itself was good though. I got the filet mignon and it was delicious. The complimentary bread was pretty bad but it's free so you can't complain! I would come back here again if I was craving a steak!"}
{"text":"bad wait times for seats
friendly staff
food was decent they mess up the steaks to a point i stopped ordering it"}
{"text":"Excellent exemplary service. You can't please everyone cause people complain about the smallest things. But my experience has been good each time. Yesterday my wife stake was a little well done instead of medium rare. No problem it was quickly removed. 5 mins later it was replaced with a new dish and they refilled the fried onions and also heated up my plate. The manager brought it out, not the waitress.. They gave a discount off the bill and that was unexpected. 
Can't ask for more."}
{"text":"There's so many different scales to rate on (Keg vs Keg, Keg vs other steakhouses) and this Keg falls short on all of them. 

\"I have just got a new theory of Eternity.\" - Albert Einstein:
Same feels. If you want a glimpse into eternity come wait at this Keg. We were quoted a wait of 30-45 minutes. This quote was faster than the other nearby Kegs (on Leslie and in Ajax) which was promising but was just a lie. There's a little window into the dining room at the front where I was waiting and there were many uncleared tables and even tables with settings on them. Somehow there was still a wait. Either the kitchen/servers are understaffed and not able to keep up with that many tables OR the front of house is sloppy and slow. I'm pretty sure it was the latter. Other tables with the same number of guests were jumping the queue in front of us. We watched at least two tables sign in, get handed a pager and then get called before us. I will note that at some point the lady who took our names went on break so someone else took over. I'm still not sure why this should matter since their pager system should track this.

When we did finally get our table things were looking up with our waiter who patiently explained the specials to us. Our roller coasters small climb sharply dropped downhill when he disappeared for an unreasonable amount of \"I'll be back with waters and bread\" time. I'll admit that this was a compounding problem as we were hungry and fed up from waiting. When we finally got to order, it finally felt like we weathered the worst of the storm and it should be comfortable sailing from then on. 

\"But we found out: the drink could not state us, and the food turned to ashes in our mouths, and no amount of pleasant company could ease our torment.\" - Captain Hector Barbossa:
If the food was worth the wait, all could be forgiven. The warm bread was a small reprieve but not what I came for. We were planning on a dessert so we didn't order an appetizer. I ordered the 10 oz prime rib, medium rare. The prime rib looked really appetizing but was a little dry (the au jus was a must versus an option) and seemed to be more medium than medium rare as it was quite firm. I'll award some points on the outer Keg rub being nice. 

So on a scale of ordering steak at Kelsey's to Jacobs, I'd think the Keg would be somewhere in the middle of that spectrum. I understand The Keg is a chain restaurant which is already off putting to the food snobs out there but I think for most people the name does evoke connotations of quality, especially at the $$$ price. It just wasn't there on this occasion. We finished off our meal with a Billy Miner pie which is The Keg's signature dessert. This luckily was able to leave a sweeter taste in our mouths, literally and figuratively. 

\"Forget what hurt you but never forget what it taught you.\" - Shannon L. Alder:
Sayonara Scarborough Keg!"}
{"text":"I'm normally every week up in Toronto and a  convenient place to overnight for me is Scarborough. Close to the Hotel is The KEG so I'm ending up almost every week there. I like this place. They have a nice Bar area with a lot of tables with free seating - no waiting time. Service is always nice and the food is good - also if you only want to have a snack. The KEG is generally more higher priced but overall it's ok. I really like Petite Sirah - not many restaurants have one on the wine list - The KEG has the McManis which you can get per glas. They also have some good tuna - tuna tartare, tuna tacos or tuna as main (cooked more sushi style). So I will be up there again."}
{"text":"Just came home from dinner! The service and food was excellent. We ordered the top sirloin (10 oz) and mini tenderloin and shrimp (surf&turf), both were delicious and cooked perfectly to medium. We were also celebrating a birthday and were given a complimentary dessert. We ordered the cheesecake with a caramel syrup. Thankfully there was no accompanied singing with the dessert which I appreciated. I would highly recommend the double baked potato if you are true potato fan. They did it right and stuffed the potato with a good bite to bite, bacon to potato ratio. There's nothing better than food done right!"}
{"text":"Decent place for steak, nice cozy atmosphere!  The wait staff is nice and even though they were busy did well taking care of my needs.  Didn't hurt that most of them were attractive young ladies!  Definitely a plus for male diners.  The sound system was perfectly tuned not to overpower the conversations but still add to the ambience. Food portions were plenty for even a big guy like me!"}
{"text":"Very delicious food and kindness clerk with romantic environment for eating, it named steak house which mean you must order steak to tasting otherwise you will be regret.
PS. THERE ARE MANY SPICY GIRL HERE!HA..."}
{"text":"I usually enjoy my visit to the Keg, but my most recent visit to this location was horrendous. I was here on thanksgiving with my family, and there was hardly anyone even dining there.. We all ordered different types of steaks with our choice of sides to go with it, and when it came out it was all cold, and over cooked.. the meat wasn't soft, and it literally took me forever and a day to slice a piece of my steak. The service was eh... We ordered a salad which we would assume would be the first to come out before the actual meal, but not in this case it wasn't. They brought our salad out 15 minutes after already serving our main course... Which was stupid. If you plan on dining at the keg estate location you're better off going to a different location like the one in east beaver creek where i dined with my boyfriend, i would give a 5 star. Because it was thanksgiving, we decided we weren't going to give the cooks a hard time. we were still thankful for our food we could hardly chew, and swallow."}
{"text":"OK, this is going to sound silly, but: if you don't eat meat or shellfish, don't go to the Keg.

Yeah, yeah, it's a *steak* house, Jess. That said, welcome to the 21st century where there are lots of vegetarians, and if you have some options on your menu for people who don't eat meat or shellfish, steak-lovers with vegetarian/kosher friends may be more inclined to visit. I was meeting a friend I hadn't seen in 20 years; had he recalled that I keep Kosher, we wouldn't have gone there. 

In this case, I was the only one who doesn't eat meat or shellfish. While my entire party had lobster & steak (well, the kids had chicken strips and sliders), I scoured the menu for something I could eat. I finally ended up with tempura asparagus & snowpeas (an appetizer) and a Caesar Salad. The only other non-meat or shellfish options in the entire menu were two unappetizing salmon dishes. And wouldn't have done a true vegetarian any good. Would it hurt terrible for them to keep *a* pasta dish or a substantial vegetable entree on the menu?

The salad and tempura veggies were OK. Nothing spectacular. Everyone else enjoyed their meals, though no one raved about how amazing they were. A few things struck me:

- I didn't finish the vegetables and asked for them to go. They neglected to put a to-go container of the dipping sauce. 
- The Caesar Salad was missing croutons.
- The kids at the table ordered a milkshake. 40 minutes later we reminded the waitress it still hadn't arrived.
- We had to ask for the bill three times. I understand that when we started at 6:30, they were busy, but by 8:00pm the place was 3/4 empty, and service was even slower than at the beginning."}
{"text":"Came in for a little bite and drink and was welcomed with the friendliest staff Leana is one of the best and happiest wairresses we've come across in Toronto, tasty mini burgers and calamari. Will leave very satisfied. Thanks will be back."}
{"text":"I had been coming to this The Keg's location for years. Always have good services and always have a good meal, steak cooked to my liking!

The interior definitely look and feel dated, in need of an upgrade!

Complimentary dessert for special occasions is a nice touch.

I usually dine in after 9 pm so never really have to wait for a table."}
{"text":"This is a good default if you want a good meal and cost isn't an issue. You should expect to pay at least $70 for 2 people.
We waited 30 minutes on a Friday night, because they don't take reservations after 6:30 pm. The ambience was nice, but the lighting was a bit dim. Service was great and the waitress was very helpful.
I ordered the Top Sirloin classic. It came with Top Sirloin steak, caesar salad, baked potato, greens & mushrooms. The steak was done very well and the sides were good, but it wasn't anything special. I mooched some garlic mashed potatoes off my friend and they were heavenly!
Overall, I wouldn't venture here often mostly due to getting average food for such a steep price. However, this would be suitable place for any celebratory event (birthday, anniversary, losing a first tooth, etc)."}
{"text":"Not bad. The food is delicious. I had a wonderful well done steak there and the service was friendly. The prices are just a little high."}
{"text":"Ordered appetizers all good with exemption of the tuna tartar. Great service and atmosphere! They renovated and got more seating and looks bigger and better would come back again!"}
{"text":"nice environment. I tried sirloin oscar recommended by the waiter and it was good. The watermelon mojito was special. One thing not so great was the creme brûlée, not saying it wasn't tasty, but it was a little over baked"}
{"text":"Made dinner reservations for 9 at 6:30pm and the table was ready prior to arrival. The atmosphere was relaxing and intimate. Seated by the fireplace, which was covered with holiday decorations. The staff were all amazing and very helpful. The table's server did a great job handling a big group, she was able to recommend items on the menu and she accommodated special requests.

The food on the other hand was a little disappointing. Most of the appetizers were good except the tuna tartare, which was under seasoned. The filet mignon was tender but over salted and was passed medium rare. For a steakhouse, was expecting it to be much better. Presentation of the food was nice, the plating was appetizing and well balanced.

Overall, might comeback for dinner to see if there's an improvement in the food."}
{"text":"I love this Keg - you may think it's not as ~*KEWL*~ or AWESOME as the ones downtown, but you would be wrong.  

I don't know what kind of Rob Ford brand crack they put in our food last night, but it was amazing.  All four of us were making annoying noises of enjoyment, plus our server (who's name has slipped my mind) was friendly and trying very hard to be a good server, which was endearing.

They gave us a nice giant piece of ice cream cake as well - we were there for a special occasion, which was a nice touch.  

I'm sitting here at my desk, thinking of what I once had and wondering if me and that steak's cousin will ever meet...and the asparagus I had was obviously a gift from the asparagus God himself.  I will return here, mark my words."}
{"text":"This place definitely is worth its earned 4 + stars. They have great customer service from the first time my husband went there until now. I called to place an order for take out as we know the restaurant will be busy. They said they only do take out once the dining is full (or something along those lines) but he will do it for me. He took my order no problem and will have it ready for the time we wanted it to be done for. Excellent service in person and on the phone!"}
{"text":"The Keg is standard in all places that I've been to and I would say this location is just as good.  They are able to uphold some of the best standards with every item that they serve. The bread is always made fresh and very soft. It is still hot when they serve it. As well, they have incredible customer service even though it is always busy. I usually get the prime rib dinner or the New York Striploin. The prime rib is always done right when I order it medium rare, and I love their garlic mashed potato with all the flavours in it, and it comes with crispy onion rings that go so well with it. For the New York Striploin, it is also done well when medium rare, with occasional overdone steak that is tough to eat. I also love their Billy Milner cake which is an ice cream cake with almond slivers and mocha flavour, which is to die for. It is a generous portion of cake as well, and the almonds and chocolate/mocha flavour goes extremely well with it. They are also quite accommodating because I have a small child and they provide high chairs and a kids menu. However, I would say it is better to go on a date night or with other adults, with its ambience and it is more upscale than family oriented."}
{"text":"The Keg is always consistently good for a chain Steakhouse. This particular location is always packed with everyone from families with children, couples, and groups of all ages! They don't take reservations on Fridays or Saturdays so be prepared to wait. They generally tell you its a 25-35 minute wait however they do move really fast and waits aren't terribly long. However your always welcome to wait on the lounge side and get a drink until your table is ready.

Our table was ready in a about 15 minutes. The hostess led us to a cozy two person booth across from the fireplace. Decor is typical of a steakhouse with warm wooden tables and wood panel walls and carpeted floors.

Our waitress Afton was super bubbly and sweet.

For Drinks I started off with a French Martini - delicious fresh and not too sweet with frozen raspberries. The Keg serves its martinis  on ice however I don't mind that

Next came the compliamentary bread - fresh out of the oven, hot and steamy the butter melted right into the bread! Nothing beats fresh baked bread and the keg does it right!

As well with our classic keg dinners came salad

Mixed Green -  Field greens, tomatoes, peppers and cucumber in a vinaigrette dressing. I liked the addition of bell pepers in my salad and the vinaigrette was mild and tasted great.

For Main I got

Grilled Top Sirloin - served with vegetables and mushrooms + side of rice pilaf
Steak cooked perfect medium rare, juicy no gristle or fat surrounding it just a perfect cut of meat. Love the mushrooms! So flavourful and plump and the rice here is pretty good as well.

Grilled Top Sirloin with Atlantic Lobster Tail - Came with a side of butter over a tea light to keep it warm. Again everything was cooked perfectly

I love The Keg's selection of desserts my two favourites are 

S'more - Graham cracker, chocolate fudge brownie,marshmallow and chocolate sauce. Comes with two small pieces if your looking for a lighter dessert. A little messy to eat though, I suggest just shoving the whole piece in your mouth.

However my ultimate favourite dessert at the keg which I couldn't help myself from devouring is the

Billy Miner Pie - Mocha ice cream on a chocolate crust with hot fudge, caramel and almonds. This is a hugeee slice of ice cream cake but ooo soo delicious! I asked for it without carmel sauce (b/c i hate carmel sauce) so instead the waitress doubled up on the hot fudge sauce which is really goooood plus the crunch of slivered almonds its a must try! 

Washed down with a hot cup of coffee
I was in a food coma after this biggg meal!

Overall service is prompt and top notch. Our waitress was really attentive the whole night and despite how busy it was she always made a great effort to check on us. Food here is always consistently good everytime I've come and plentiful so definitely come with an appetite!!"}
