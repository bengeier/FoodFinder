{"text":"This has become one of my go to places in the area.  Good food, nice selection and quiet atmosphere.  The staff is always pleasant, and prompt."}
{"text":"After living in the Valley for 19 years I've never found Wor Won Ton soup that was worth ordering a second time. I definitely found it here! I've eaten here 3 times and only tried one other dish(Kung Pao Shrimp)but I'll be back for sure! Great service, atmosphere and prices!!! Highly recommended.."}
{"text":"First visit and last visit. My meal was blah. Wonton soup with a smokey flavor? No way! Egg drop soup with corn? The server said their family always adds corn. Really? In the last 50 years of ordering egg drop soup corn has never been included. It might be their family favorite but most certainly not ours. Before ordering the orange beef the server was asked very specifically if it was spicy. Her response was not really. Her version of 'not really spicy' is quite different from my husband's. One bite of the orange beef and his mouth was screaming holy habanero! And the beef was tougher than shoe leather. We should have taken note of the nearly empty tables/booths. We now know why."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with a group of friends who had previously enjoyed Wild Ginger.  It was a nice atmosphere with attentive wait staff. But I did not like the food. I ordered the snow peas and chicken with fried rice, crab rangoon and egg roll. The rangoon and egg roll were mushy inside. There were lots of snow peas and I ate them and the rice. I stopped eating the chicken after two bites because it was too salty. Unexciting food experience but enjoyed my friends."}
{"text":"First time trying it! We ordered the cashew chicken with fried rice, walnut shrimp, and wanton soup. Everything tasted really fresh and yummy. The order was ready in ten minutes for pickup. Glad they have so many gluten free options on the menu."}
{"text":"Exceptional service and food! More important locally owned! Will definitely be going back! Master Gees chicken was excellent"}
{"text":"We tried Wild Ginger for the first time tonight and I have to say I'm happy to have a new restaurant added to my to our list of favorites. This little place has the best Chinese food I've ever had. I had the the island treasure platter and it was delicious. My girlfriend had the sweet and our chicken and it was the best ever. I can't say enough good things about this place. If you pass on eating there, you missed out."}
{"text":"Food was good. However, they use a lot of salt and MSG. Also proceeded to take a seat while awaiting my order and was treated to a baby cockroach doing a little dance along the walls crown molding. Aw how cute. Seems to be indicative of Asian hole in the wall cuisine. Finished my meal and I was pleased to be full. While pondering the \"A\" rating in front of me on the glass exterior window I was treated by what I can only guess was the mother of the baby cockroach. It creeped up the wall beside me and onto the table. It tried some of the MSG tainted salt fiesta and moved on right away. It did however, really enjoy the soy sauce that was on the table. I had enough entertainment for one evening. enjoy"}
{"text":"Praise the heavens! Good Chinese food on this side of Gilbert/Mesa!!
+The Orange chicken and BBQ Pork lo mein had great flavor
++Their take on General Tso's, Master Gee's chicken was nice and spicy! Although if that's not enough FYRE for you they seemed very accommodating with adjustments. More Spice, Less veg, whatever. It was colorful, spicy, and tasted like GOOD which works for me!

-Even though it was a rather slow weekday it took quite some time to get the check. And utensils.
-If you're sensitive to sodium you may want to try one of their lighter options as pretty much everything we ordered was a bit saltier than the average take out. But if you're doing Chinese and in the area, you might as well grab some extra water and go for it anyway. It's worth trying at least once."}
{"text":"Ran into this local gem through word of mouth. This is a great family owned restaurant. I met the owner and he's very personable and pleasant. 

The decor is very trendy and up to date and all the equipment is brand new. The staff is attentive to details and the ambience is great. 

I had the Wild Ginger chicken and a bottle of Heinken from the suggestions of the owner. The presentation was great and the flavor and taste was even better. Being an Asian, I can confidently say that this restaurant caters to both Asian Americans and natives, a very rare combination. 

This spot is a great place for casual dine ins, special occasions and gatherings. I highly recommend this restaurant if you're into Chinese fusion restaurant. Yum yum!"}
{"text":"Because my entire family went I had the opportunity to sample quite a few of the dishes. All of them were tasty. I had the Butterscotch Pork and loved the wasabi mashed potatoes. I could have eaten a whole plate of just the potatoes. Their egg drop soup was among the best I've had. For desert we had the ginger ice cream and it was amazing. It reminded me of home made ice cream. This is my new favorite Asian eatery."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  The best, most flavorful Pad Thai I've ever had!  Ask for it Kathy style, where they add broccoli, mushrooms and some heat.   

The salt and pepper shrimp was also excellent.  Lightly battered and so tasty!"}
{"text":"Awesome! Fresh! Gotta try! They had terrific service and very healthy... I recommend this small family business"}
{"text":"Both food and service were excellent. They did a great job of accommodating our party of 22!"}
{"text":"I've been waiting for a good Chinese restaurant in the East Valley, and Wild Ginger finally fills the void. Crab rangoons and Mongolian beef are amazing!!"}
{"text":"Love it!!! Master Gee chicken and pot stickers are the real deal!!! Best Asian I've had in a long time."}
{"text":"Amazing! I ordered the butterscotch braised pork belly, and my boyfriend had the wild ginger chicken. Best Chinese we've had, hands down. We liked the ambience too. We will be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious and great service!! If you love good Chinese food, then you all need to come here!! The orange chicken is the best I have ever had!! My family liked the chicken and vegetables and scallops and peas. Come and see for yourself how delicious it is. Thanks Wild Ginger!!"}
{"text":"The service was pretty slow. We waited for five minutes with empty plates and empty glasses for the check to come. I loved the spring roll, the crab Rangoon (both came with my lunch) was really good but also the smallest one I have ever had. It is on the spender side for Chinese food. I got the beef with broccoli and my mom got chicken with vegetables, we both thought it was good, could have used more rice on the plate, and I was not impressed with the fried rice. I almost got the lemongrass chicken, if I go back I will get it. I won't pick this place again but will go if someone wants to."}
{"text":"There is a fountain outside with a huge pool shaped like a bowl. On more than one occasion I have had a dream where the fountain was filled with their beef lo mein and it is the greatest dream I have ever had.  Love this place."}
{"text":"Very good wonton soup. Their Hong Kong version of wonton soup is fairly good. Wonder why this place is not usually packed; must be location with so many restaurants popping up in Gilbert.  Hope they do well!"}
{"text":"This is our go too place for Asian take out. The food is very fresh and flavorful not to mention the portions are big and the prices very reasonable.  Highly recommended this local independent neighborhood restaurant."}
{"text":"Finally good Chinese food. We have been looking for a local Chinese restaurant for the past 3 years and finally found it!!!! Great atmosphere- clean and nice updated decor. Great Service- fast and friendly. Great food- fresh  quality ingredients with lots taste.

We ordered the orange chicken, Mongolian beef, shrimp with snow peas, king pao chicken. The orange chicken was the best, but all were good. Nothing was left to take home. 

Highly recommended to anyone who likes Chinese food."}
{"text":"Went to Wild Ginger for the first time on a Friday night. We only waited a couple minutes after we walked in for a table. The service was fast, friendly and our waitress was on top of taking care of us. We ordered the egg rolls, sesame chicken and Mongolian beef. Everything was really good and came out quickly. Good portion sizes for the price too. The 2 entrees could have fed our whole family if we had brought our children."}
{"text":"Amazing food and wonderful service! Food was served super fast! Very impressed! Had the chicken lo mein and husband had Mongolian beef. Very good and large portion sizes. Definitely coming back again!"}
{"text":"We were excited to try this place after the good reviews. By the time we left, we were disappointed in our experience and confused by the great reviews.

We went on a Saturday night and it was practically empty. In retrospect, we should have seen that as a sign. 

The service was the biggest redeeming quality. They were very friendly, accommodating, and prompt. 5 stars.

The ambience was fine. It was clean and comfortable enough, but nothing \"wow\" about it. 4 stars. 

The food. I don't know what to say other than it just wasn't good. We shared edamame to start, and even that wasn't good. It tasted dried out; perhaps it had been frozen and reheated? We didn't finish it.

I got the butterscotch pork entree (how could I not, after all the good reviews on it?) and couldn't eat more than a few bites. Seriously. The meat was very fatty and I simply didn't like the flavor of the sauce. I was most excited about the wasabi mashed potatoes, but I could barely taste any wasabi, and the potatoes themselves weren't good enough to make up for the lack of flavor.

I can't remember specifically what my husband got, but it was a noodle dish with bbq pork and dry yellow curry in it. Surprisingly low on flavor, and the texture of the pork was not appetizing at all. 

Honestly, the food was 1 star. We left hungry, and went to get pizza after leaving."}
{"text":"We tried this new restaurant and we were very pleased.  All the food we ordered was delicious!  The staff was friendly.

Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Went for lunch at noon and the place was empty. Extensive menu of all your basic Asian dishes. Ordered a house special, wild ginger chicken. Supposed to be spicy but not even close. My friend ordered soup and cashew chicken and neither had any flavor. It's the same old idea of adding tons of sugar to dishes and msg. Nothing special here and I ended up with a queasy stomach. Won't be back."}
{"text":"First time here, awesome service great food and they don't skimp on the serving sizes."}
{"text":"Second visit was just as good as the first! Love the consistant experience that is so hard to find. Bbq rib appetizer was amazing! Had the Pad Thai and Chicken Curry for our entrees. Fresh, fast and amazing. Service was outstanding. Always fresh iced tea in front of us! Great value for the price. This place rocks! Don't miss it! Yum!"}
{"text":"Got a few items Togo. The restaurant was in a Nice and clean neighborhood and was very nicely decorated inside. The food was fantastic and make great for leftovers the next day as well. Look forward to returning"}
{"text":"Been here four times since they opened. So glad to have great food so close! The sauces and breading (where used) have all been very light, not heavy or greasy. The ramen changes daily and is always good. The broth tastes like broth, not salt. Fish is never over-cooked. 

They're still working out some kinks (ran out of items twice by dinner) but this place is great!"}
{"text":"Wow! This could definitely become a new go to place for us. The service was EXTREMELY friendly, welcoming and helpful. The atmosphere was a little bland but clean and pleasant. The sheer number of gluten free options made choosing difficult. We went for the lemon grass chicken and the walnut shrimp. Both were excellent! Portion size was very reasonable. The meats in both dishes was outstanding quality, cooked perfectly, tender and delicious. Two thumbs up! Loved it!"}
{"text":"I had the kung pao chicken and the lemongrass chicken dishes. The kung pao chicken tasted the same as I would normally find at other restaurants. Since I chose the kung pao chicken off of the lunch special menu, I had the option to have egg drop soup or hot and sour soup. I ended up choosing the hot and sour soup, which tasted good. I also had the option to choose between a soup or egg roll plus crab rangoon. They offered fried rice or steamed white rice. I tried the fried rice, but it was unlike anything I was expecting. Honestly, I thought it was going to be fried white rice with some scrambled egg in it along with spices or green onions. But, it turned out to be soy sauce rice with no scrambled egg pieces. I've never had this kind of fried rice before.

The lemongrass chicken was interesting. The onions in the dish had the most lemongrass flavor. I think the chicken didn't have much lemongrass flavor to it. Also, the chicken in both the lemongrass dish and the kung pao dish was soft. Fish-texture soft. I feel weird about chicken that is so soft. The service was fine."}
{"text":"Dining at wild ginger was a real pleasure.  My noodles were prepared just the way I like them and were so very yummy. On my list of places to dine again when I'm in the area"}
{"text":"Best egg foo young EVER.  Gravy is amazing. Pad Thai was perfect - not too spicy.  Crab Rangoon is soooooo good.  Must visit!  I'll be back.  Customer service is  AWESOME!!!"}
{"text":"Loved there egg noodle soup. The wait staff was exceptional. Very clean and nice informal setting. My wife had shrimp with walnut concoction and also very good. Lots of menu  selections not on you typical Chinese menu. Look forward to trying some different things"}
{"text":"Fabulous new spot for great food in Gilbert!  The food is delightful & the staff is well informed. I had a lot of questions and they happily answered all of them intelligently. I started with soup then had the beef & broccoli both were good. My wife enjoyed the woton soup & the veggies & shrimp!"}
{"text":"Stopped in late on a Monday night, only people in the restaurant. Very nice and clean. Had our mainstays when trying a new Chinese restaurant, Mongolian beef, sesame chicken and pork fried rice. All came out quickly, portions were large and all the food was delicious. Plenty leftover for lunch tomorrow. Will definitely be back. Highly recommend you try this place."}
{"text":"This was not our original destination, but turned into a very wonderful happenstance.
The atmosphere is nice.  The lady who served us was very friendly and informative.  Our choices were Very nicely spiced and cooked perfectly!  She told us that she had chosen the beef with just the right amount of marbling and came up the original recipe.  It was delicious."}
{"text":"Ok food, nothing special. It is just like every other Asian restaurant that caters to American taste. Not worth the money."}
{"text":"A perfect gem in our backyard (literally)!  Food, service and decor were awesome!  Our server learned how to make manhattans and they were delish!  Wild Ginger will definitely be a regular spot for us going forward."}
{"text":"Only open for 4 days. Atmosphere is great as is the decor. Met the owner, great guy and friendly. Local owner. Food was great and looking forward to coming back soon to try some other dishes. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place was a disappointment for my fiancé and I, we were excited to try this placed based off a photo of some pork steamed buns that someone had tried. We ordered them, 12$ by the way, for them to come with the bun cold. The pork was basically thick cut bacon, which is the pork belly but it wasn't tender - it was hard to bite through. We sent it back disappointed. We had ordered the rangoon's which were amazing, and then the bbq pork ribs, which were not to meaty. The sauce was good but just didn't feel worth it unfortunately. Our waitress, Kathy, had even told us that she felt the steam buns and that \"they weren't that cold\", and \"since they're steamed they get cold fast\"..... Alright.. Most likely won't return, but we could only judge what we had."}
{"text":"Very tasty, recommended, had the Thai noodle dish even though the appearance was kinda bland.
This may have been because it was takeout?.
Looking forward to dine in next time."}
{"text":"After reading so many excellent reviews, we were excited to try a new restaurant in the neighborhood. Unfortunately, it was just ok at best. 

The butterscotch pork had a good flavor, but was too fatty for my taste. The wasabi mashed potatoes did not taste like they had much if any wasabi in them. The kung pao chicken was disappointingly bland, with a watery sauce and low quality chicken. The \"crab\" won tons did not contain any crab, or even krab, just cream cheese. And the fried rice was bland to almost bad. My husband described it as testing like old tap water. 

We went on a Sunday @ 5 for take-out, and I was the only customer. Service was fast and friendly, but with the high prices and low quality, we would not go back."}
{"text":"I recently moved back to the valley after being away for a couple of years and was clueless on where to go to get some delicious Chinese food.. so naturally I turned to Yelp and Wild Ginger was one of the top results and for good reason!!

I went and was greeted immediately. I was really happy to see that they had a good selection of meatless dishes (I am vegan) - so I ordered some spring rolls as an appetizer and the Kung Pao vegetables w/ white rice and tofu ($1 extra)

My appetizer came out quickly and was very hot and delicious. My main course was huge! I went home with left overs and they don't mess around when it comes to spice! Everything was absolutely delicious! Just for me, it was only $12!! I've gone back maybe once a week for the past two-three weeks and have had wonderful service every single time :)"}
{"text":"This is the second time we have ordered from here...Take-out both times.

The first time the food was good...very tasty! 

This time, not so much. I hate to be so abrasive but the teriyaki chicken was the worst I have ever had. Its my go-to at Asian/Chinese spots because its fool proof. I literally took one bite and threw the rest away. The chicken was dry and had zero flavor. The broccoli that comes with was under cooked, also with no flavor. Their fired rice is nothing more than white rice with soy sauce...no egg, no vegetables. My husband got the Master Gee's chicken and that was delicious. My sons orange chicken had the wrong sauce on it (they DID call me to rectify this and said they would credit my card back for the sauce error...which I just checked my account and they DID NOT). The sauce they did use was actually good, just not what we ordered!

Overall its decent food! We will more than likely order from here again as its in our backyard and the other places we have tried were 1 to 2 star worthy!"}
{"text":"Went one night and ordered the hot sour soup and chicken lettuce wraps----did not finish either--they knew I did not care for either and offered to remove from the bill but I paid anyways because it is a local business and appreciated their concern---very nice staff and will go back and try something else"}
{"text":"Excellent food, great service. Menu has classics and some creative choices including vegetarian. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We ordered a ton of stuff!! As a family trying anew place, it's just what we do. The edamame & crab puffs & wings. The Singapore noodles I was so happy with. Super delicious!! Orange chicken & beef pepper steak also all delicious! The ginger ice cream was amazing!!"}
{"text":"Good food with very pretty presentation...this was our 1st time here so we weren't sure what we should get..we opted for the pork w/Wasabi mashed potatoes and a chicken chow mein and it was tasty....had to try the ginger ice cream too, glad we did yummmmy...we will definitely be back soon! Super clean restaurant too! That's a huge plus as well."}
{"text":"Huge let down.  The reviews had this place rated very high and just dont see why.  The food is on the same level as Panda Express, just simple food with no flavor.  If you put a chile next to a menu item, then give it some heat. Their Wild ginger chicken tasted no different then their Master gee sauce.  When you order different items, you expect different flavors. The spicey edamame was fair, but too much chile oil, just use some chiles.  Good service but, Very average food lacking flavors."}
{"text":"The only thing better than the food is the staff.  This wAs our first visit to Wild Ginger but will definitely not be our last. The lemon grass chicken was very good and my husband loved the orange chicken.  Service was excellent, everyone was very attentive, and the decor was warm & inviting. Definitely worth going to. We love to patronize local family-owned businesses and this is one of the best."}
{"text":"Impeccable. Food was spot on, service was prompt & attentive, and prices were reasonable. I wanted to try a sample of everything on the menu! Creative dishes and a good mix of Thai, Indian and Japanese. Try the curry chicken & shrimp!  Hope this place sticks around!"}
{"text":"This restaurant just opened a couple of weeks ago, and my family decided to give it a try.  We called ahead and they were ready with a table for eight when we arrived.

We tried quite a variety of dishes, and enjoyed every one.  The stand out dishes, to me, were the Orange Chicken, Sweet and Sour Shrimp, and Sesame Chicken, but all were very tasty.  Service was prompt and our server was very pleasant.  

I highly recommend trying this new restaurant!"}
{"text":"Great miso glazed ribs. It's one of the best Asian restaurants I've been in the Valley and there's not much around. I know my Asian food as I've savored flavors from Tokyo to Hong Kong to Manila to Bangkok. Not much is around to match the authentic flavors in US cities like Las Vegas, NY, SF and Boston. Wild Ginger comes pretty close here in the Phoenix Valley. The crispy roast pork is a must!"}
{"text":"Ambiance, location, decor and service is top notch. A nice variety on the menu. This is a Asian Fusion place. I recommend they continue to put a twist on the fusion with the  dishes. We will be back.. the food was very well prepared and delicious.. Thank you"}
{"text":"I agree with most of these reviews. I've been looking in Gilbert for a while for a good clean Chinese restaurant where the food was really good. Wild Ginger did not disappoint!! The place was immaculately clean, the food was decently priced, and I loved what I ordered. Unfortunately like all Chinese restaurants if you want egg rolls, crab rangoons, etc they are all separate side orders so the bill goes up but it is what it is. Best potstickers I've ever had! The Sesame Chicken was perfectly cooked and the sauce wasn't too heavy. Ellie was my server, and she was great. Wild Ginger is without a doubt my new go-to for Chinese food. They just opened up in June 2016 so still relatively new and I hope they stay around for a long time."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite Chinese spot!!! I've been looking for a good Chinese place and have come up short here in Mesa/Gilbert area. Went here today and was blown away. The restaurant is very clean and nicely decorated. Very modern decor with cute table top accents that is pleasing to the eye. The service was great especially for a Sunday afternoon. Had the egg rolls as an appetizer, I wouldn't say they were the best I've ever had but they were definitely good. What hit the nail on the head for me was the Master Gee's chicken. Oh my god. I fell in love. There aren't words to describe how delicious it was. You get generous portions so I'm looking forward to eating it for lunch tomorrow. This will definitely be my new go to Chinese spot!!!"}
{"text":"We finally got a chance to try Wild Ginger Asian Bistro last night before catching a play at the Tuscany Theatre (both are located in the Tuscany Village center).  The restaurant is beautiful and makes you forget that you are in the middle of a strip mall.  Service was phenomenal.  Our server was very sweet and attentive, but didn't seem to be hovering either.  Our table ordered 3 entrees: Orange Chicken, Master Gee's Chicken & Wild Ginger Chicken.  All of which were excellent.  I would have preferred the Wild Ginger Chicken to be spicier, but at the same time I couldn't stop eating.  Very worthy of 5 stars, I expect to come back regularly."}
{"text":"The service was great and the food was good. Was only disappointed when I ordered a spicy dish and it was not spicy at all. Portions are big though!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for Asian food! The Waitstaff are always friendly and their service is outstanding! The food is amazing! Best Crab Rangoons I've ever had! The Dinner portion size will not disappoint and I usually end up taking half home for Lunch. The Shrimp and Vegetables and Chicken and Vegetables are my personal favorites. I had the appetizer platter and shared with a friend. We were both very satisfied!"}
{"text":"After moving to Gilbert and leaving behind our favorite Chinese restaurant, we searched high and low for one that we loved. A friend on our neighborhood Facebook page shared Wild Ginger's info and from the first bite, we've been hooked!! Seriously, my whole family loves this place. I LOVE their crab wontons, my kids love the spicy orange chicken, the portions are huge, and their service is amazing. I admit I'm a bit of a homebody during fall TV season, so I've yet to dine in, but their patronage for takeout couldn't be better. I'm always greeted at the door, my food is ready and steaming, and their employees are smiling and enthusiastic. It's become a once a week dinner for us. Even more, they're local and family owned and operated. I love supporting my community and the amazing businesses we have!"}
{"text":"Truly a great Chinese cuisine restaurant. The ramen noodles of the day won't disappoint.  Orange chicken is one of the best I've had. Egg drop soup is delicious and sweet. Definitely a new favorite."}
{"text":"Ummmm....okay this place was very mediocre. The crab wontons only has cream cheese and the fried rice was dry, orange chicken sauce too sweet and the fried shrimp too battered.  I will travel and stick with China Chili."}
{"text":"The best Chinese food I've ever had. Everything was prepared nicely and neatly. The food wasn't greasy or anything at all like other Chinese places I've visited in the past! I had the Shrimp Lo Mein and it was delicious! Today, I went back and got the Salt & Pepper Shrimp. I highly recommend you ask for that. It comes with your choice of white rice or fried rice with tidbits (peppers and onion). No sauces or anything is needed with it! You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"As my husband and I were driving around looking for a new place to eat, we came across Wild Ginger, as we went in the staff was so nice and inviting! The owner came out and was telling us things to order on the menu, first let's start off with saying their spicy edamame is AMAZING! My personal favorite thing on their menu is the Wild Ginger chicken:) everyone go try this place!! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"This is my first time to Wild Ginger I tried the lemon grass chicken it was delicious. The waitress was very friendly and attentive. I love the atmosphere very nice very spacious. They have a mini bar. They have so much on the menu too choose from I will be back in the future. I recommend this place to everyone this is their 3rd week open I wish this business the best."}
{"text":"I don't know which restaurant these other people went to, but it obviously wasn't Wild Ginger in Gilbert, AZ.  The food wasn't nearly as good as Panda Express!  It was my grandsons birthday and they wouldn't even give him a serving of ice cream on the house.  We had seven orders so you would have thought they could have thrown in one little bowl of ice cream, but no."}
{"text":"Wild Ginger is vegetarian friendly they have a separate section for vegetarians in their menu. Service staffs are friendly and efficient. They plates are rich in flavors and hearty. Comfortable sitting area with full bar service. One of the best Chinese restaurant in the east valley!"}
{"text":"Had a great evening here at Wild Ginger! Delicious cocktails, and even better food!
The Pad Thai was my favorite entree."}
{"text":"We have only ordered take out from this place, but it's amazing! We have had a variety of foods and they all have been delicious. A few favorites are the chicken/pork fried rice and the Master G's beef!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing!  I went with a couple friends and the atmosphere was very chill, modern, and friendly.
Our server Sammy accommodated all of our needs and she went above and beyond for our group, she acted professional whilst keeping a very down to earth personality."}
{"text":"This was a really clean pretty restaurant with a menu that includes old favorites with se of their own specialties. The only complaint we had was that on the appetizer menu they only offer one egg roll so you have to order one for each person. My husband and I tried  the Happy Family and the Trio.  Both were expertly prepared and delicious. The shrimp, beef, chicken and scallops were wonderfully tender and they didn't skimp on the vegetables for the main dishes. The service was as good as the food. We will be back."}
{"text":"This is a tough one! Staff and ambiance, EASY 5 star. Food, probably a 3. We did Chicken Curry and Chicken Pad Thai (both gluten free) and they were just ok. Pretty bland and no spice at all. The curry was very non-traditional. It wasn't served in a bowl like I expected, but rather on a plate with very little sauce...I was expecting a bowl with a lot of soup. They do cater very well to gluten free and even made gluten free fried rice for us, which is one of the many reasons the staff deserves 5 stars. So a 4 star review is a combo of world class service, very nice restaurant and ok food."}
{"text":"Pretty good!!! Not a super large menu, but my go to sweet and sour chicken was good. Wish they had a smaller portion size- it comes with rice. Also had an order of chicken fried rice.. Could use more soy sauce but i its ok. Will definitely be back - happy they are in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Being from New York City Chinese good Chinese food is hard to come by out here. This one hit the mark for me. After being here four years the 35 minute driver is worth the food ."}
{"text":"Amazing! The Butterscotch Pork with wasabi mashed potatoes were the best thing I have eaten in a long time! The a Wild Ginger Chicken was great especially with their simple fried rice. 

Crab Rangoon for appetizer were super tasty, ask for the spicy garlic dipping sauce. 

Highly recommend the ice cream (moshi?) chocolate and strawberry and not too filling at all. Even when you are stuffed, order the ice cream!!!

Simple, clean atmosphere and great staff.  We be coming back very soon and often!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is outstanding ....
We tried it on s whim because of yelp and so glad we did.
The soup was some of the best we have ever had.  Hot and hearty.  We made with great ingredients.  
The second time was even better.  The ginger chicken was fabulous.  It was fried but worth the splurge,  we think the service is outstanding as well.  Clean comfortable and very friendly.
I would give them 10  if I could!"}
{"text":"I ordered takeout from here and had several items
1. The crab Rangoon were very good. 
2. The egg rolls were average and nothing special. 
3. The pan fried dumplings and the sauce were above average
4.  The spare ribs were the worst thing we had. They were very fatty. 
5. The sweet and sour chicken was decent but not anything to write home about. 
6. The kung poa chicken was very average. 
7. The chicken Lo mein was good (not overly greasy). 
8. The lemon grass chicken was chewy and the flavor was just ok.  
9. The fried rice that accompanies the main dishes was very disappointing. It was basically white rice with soy sauce. 

Not the worst Chinese I have ever had but certainly not the best."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time, was very disappointed.  The food was very bland and almost tasteless. Not sure what part of the chicken was in the pad thai but was very unappealing. Potstickers very stale and oily. Hot and sour soup was ok and about the only thing worth eating. Giving it 2 stars as the service was good and the restaurant has a nice feel to it.  Just need to go cooking school and figure it out."}
{"text":"Great place, friendly staff, delicious food. Visit often and never disappointed. Whether you eat in or take out, you will enjoy the appetizers through the main entree - and generous portions."}
{"text":"Just picked up a to go order and it was great!! We're so excited to finally have some good Chinese food near us!"}
{"text":"Very good mid priced Chinese food. We will go back. Service was attentive and fast. Everything we ordered was great."}
{"text":"Very clean and the booths are comfortable. Service was excellent and the food was wonderful."}
{"text":"Just had dinner last evening and food and service was excellent. Best egg foo young since leaving NY, 35 years in California  (north and south) and 2 years in Az.  Huge and yummy portions, thai iced tea and very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Finally, great Asian food in the east valley.  Hot & sour soup, spring rolls, walnut prawns, everything was delicious.   We're 2 for 2 with our meals, but they've only been open 4 months.  Nice decor too.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Eating at Wild Ginger. Excellent food. The first real egg roll I have had in the valley. Service is great and the dining area is simple, clean, and elegant. If your looking for quality, home made, authentic food come here."}
{"text":"Delicious,  called on my way home and the to go order was ready and waiting for me.  The food was fresh and delicious.  Very quick and convenient."}
{"text":"The food was good. Nothing out of the ordinary. Nice place. Nice children's menu. They also have cocktails on the menu, but I did not try any."}
{"text":"I really loved this place. Nice friendly fast service. Food really good. Had the kung pao chicken, orange chicken and fried rice. Eggrolls were tasty, but a little oily. Entree portions enough for two. Could have ordered 1 to split."}
{"text":"My friends from out of town were visiting and we had just had beers from next door. They opted for Asian food and  with my experience of Asian food so far in AZ, my expectation bar was low.  I'm happy to say that this is now my favorite place to get Chinese food. We tried the appetizer sampler and my faves were the crab rangoon & dumplings. The spicy wings were also super tasty and my hubby loved the ribs. The only \"meh\" was the fried shrimp. Too much batter and too greasy. We all shared but we had Kung Pao chicken, General Tso chicken, Scallops and pea pods, and the pork belly with Wasabi mashed potatoes. All delicious. We will be back!"}
{"text":"The sweet and sour pork lacks flavor and didn't have enough sauce or vegetables in it"}
{"text":"Very tasty choice! We ordered 6 entrees and shared family style. Everything was super fresh and hot. The Kung Pao chicken, Kung Pao vegetables and Master Gees chicken were the favorites. Stay away from the yellow curry - wasn't good. The owner came and greeted us, gave us his opinions and shared some of his kitchen secrets. Great experience, thanks Wild Ginger!"}
{"text":"Delicious!! Clean, quiet and generous portions. The food was great and they have gluten free options, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Everything is so fresh and prepared just to perfection.
The service is excellent!"}
{"text":"Lots of tasty food on take-out orders.  Staff are friendly and welcoming.  Pad Thai was excellent. Staff are accomodating when asking for add-ins. Fast kitchen!"}
{"text":"We discovered this restaurant on Yelp and tried it out because of the great reviews. We weren't disappointed great food and amazing friendly service."}
{"text":"First visit here and I can not find any faults.  The place is nicely decorated and in great shape.  I only say this because so many Chinese restaurants I go to look like they never repair or update their furnishungs.  The menu has all the popular items but is not overly huge.  We ordered egg drop and wonton soups and then  Mongolian beef and Curry chicken.  Everything was served in a timely manner, looked great and tasted even better.  Very happy we decided to drive a little farther for this experience.  I think too many times we settle for what is convenient instead searching for better"}
{"text":"Such a pleasant suprise to find great Asian cuisine after living in the area for five years. Have visited for both lunch and dinner and been impressed by cleanliness, friendly staff, and quality of food. Having sampled numerous entrees and starters, I have to say everything is good. Personal favorites so far are the Wild Ginger Chicken and potstickers. Looking forward to trying everything on the menu except the shrimp, but only because I am allergic to shrimp!
Good servive, great food!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place kind of by accident, glad we did!!! Group of 5 of us and we all enjoyed our dishes (and shared too!).  The Ginger Chicken was REALLY good.  Generous portions too. Excellent service.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today and we were very disappointed. We ordered sesame chicken and master gee's chicken. The sesame chicken was not sweet at all and it was soggy. We prefer our chicken to be crispier. The sauce was lack luster. The master gee's chicken did not taste like chicken however the sauce was ok. Sweet and sour soup was ok as well. Ordered fried rice and it had only had one small egg in it and I am pretty sure it was made with brown rice. So disappointed because I love good fried rice. This place is a little pricey. However the portions are really big so that makes up for it. We will not return unfortunately."}
{"text":"Very good food, they also provide a variation of other Asian inspired types of food. A little on the pricy side but we ordered enough I had it for lunch the next couple days. Still good."}
{"text":"I'm embarrassed to say that I just gobbled my pad Thai so quickly that I forgot to take a picture. I have been at the nearby hospital all weekend with my love and I needed something other than hospital food but I also needed gluten free and wanted something reasonably healthy. I looked at nearby offerings and chose Wild Ginger. I am so happy with my choice. 

I ordered my food to go but as I waited for it (a very short amount of time actually) I sat at the bar. The restaurant is brand new and decorated nicely. It is comfortable. It isn't large so once word gets around about how good the food and service are, I imagine getting a seat may be more difficult. If they continue the way they have started, the wait will be worth it. 

There were a lot of gluten free options to choose from. I ordered the pad Thai and some edamame. I drove back to the hospital to eat and both were still very hot. The ingredients were high quality and plentiful. Some Asian food can be oily and mushy but that was not the case here. Very fresh, crisp, and flavorful. I don't live anywhere near here but when I am in the area, I will visit them again."}
{"text":"Look no farther than Wild Ginger for a quality Chinese restaurant. I ordered to-go and the service was so speedy! When I went in to pick it up he atmosphere was also very comforting and inviting. Will be back!"}
{"text":"LITERAL doggy shit, pad Thai tasted like someone dropped their cigarette in it... V disappointed"}
{"text":"So far the best Chinese food in the area!  Prices are amazing for the amount of food and the great quality of it. Restaurant is super clean and a very nice atmosphere. I hope they do well"}
{"text":"Service & food was very good.  Only complaint is wh
en I paid cash,  I wasn't offered change, I would have to ask for it.  I was willing to leave a 20% tip, but I guess they felt 30%+ was more appropriate."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance, great food. Our server was not aware of the menu and could not explain what most dishes were.
When we asked for details, he would simply read the description on the menu, so we kept it safe - orange chicken,  broccoli in garlic sauce with tofu and lemongrass shrimp. 
The dishes were very good.

When we arrived, we thought they were closed. Dark windows. Black out doors. We almost left..."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what the quality of Chinese food that is available in Phoenix, so for this city, maybe the food here is good. I'm from Vancouver where there is a Chinese restaurant on every block, the Wild Ginger, would sit empty. The food is bland, the prices are high, the service is average. Not a good combination for a successful business.
Don't order wonton it's terrible 
KungPao bland
Dumplings tasted like cooking oil
Honestly this place needs a cooking makeover!"}
{"text":"Showed up close to closing and staff were very accommodating and did not rush me at all.  The menu is a nice blend of typical fare and unique house specialties for the adventurous pallet. Both the spicy garlic edamame and the BBQ pork lo mein were delicious. Previously I had the ramen special for lunch and enjoyed it too. Lastly, they have a full bar for festive occasions. Definitely adding this to my list of local favorites."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp and decided to try it out and boy was it the right call! I had the orange chicken with brown rice which was phenomenal and not greasy at all. The chicken seemed fresh and had the right amount of crunch. I started off with the hot and sour soup which was also tasty! I was the only person in the restaurant and so service was extremely quick and friendly! Overall a great stop if your in the area!"}
{"text":"I loved this place!!  The beef broccoli was delicious and the generals chicken was so yummy, one of my all time top choices. The fried rice wasn't as flavorful as I've had before, which is disappointing. It's almost like the wok isn't seasoned enough. But the rest of the meal made up for it!"}
{"text":"Loved the service and atmosphere. Kathy, our server, was very attentive to our needs and helped in selecting the best entrees on the menu even though they all sound so appetizing! My favorite by far was the homemade dessert: ginger ice cream with sesame brittle on top! Great way to end a perfect night. I am definitely coming back."}
{"text":"We had sweet and sour chicken and pork, wasn't anything spectacular but would go back. They seem like a consistent and friendly business. Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"The most amazing Asian Food in the east valley!!! Delicious, clean and wonderful service!"}
{"text":"I'm a regular customer and I've been going here for about four times tonight was the fifth time and probably my last time, ordered the trio! Chicken, scallops and shrimp, got equal proportion EXCEPT ONE SCALLOP!!! In that whole dish!!! Its tacky and cheap!!!! Will never go there again!!!"}
{"text":"Just regular Americanized Chinese food but at higher prices. Had a $50 bill with just my wife and son. If the quality was amazing then it might've been justified. I really wanted to try the crispy pork belly on steamed buns but they said they were all out and it was only 6pm on a Tuesday... Got the combo platter for $15 and it was your usual suspects with none being too great or too bad. Had 2 more entrees, both priced around $15 each. The house special chx in general tso sauce was way too sweet and the walnut shrimp could've been good but it was overcooked. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"First time here. Had the Mongolian beef and egg foo young. It was delicious!  Very fresh and flavorful. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Their ginger chicken is tasty, slight kick with the jalapeno.  They also have good crab rangoons which is hard to find.  I haven't tried anything else on the menu but look forward to it!"}
{"text":"This place is outstanding!!! Amazing service, extremely clean and great tasting food!!! We've never been disappointed. Definitely a must try, you'll be hooked!"}
{"text":"Great Chinese food and service. Been there twice and had excellent food both times. Will be back again!"}
{"text":"An awesome hidden restaurant in a tiny plaza. It's the best Asian Bistro around. Food with flavor and spice, it's a special place to eat. They have wonderful service with a smile and we've eaten here multiple times with great experiences."}
{"text":"This new restaurant is fabulous.  I have eaten here three times and all three times it was awesome! Great friendly service.....especially from the hostess Lexi....she is very personable and funnyMy favorites are the Crab Rangoons, Orange Chicken and Curry Chicken. If you haven't tried out this place...you should."}
{"text":"This place will definitely be seeing a lot more of me. Especially when they get Happy Hour up and going.  Delicious food. Great decor and atmosphere.  Our waitress Kathy was very attentive and did a awesome job. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is a very nice family restaurant. The food is very good, the staff is always friendly and the atmosphere is intimate and tasteful. Some of our favorite dishes are the chicken lo mein, Kung pao, and war won ton soup."}
{"text":"Easily the best Asian restaurant I've ever been to with always fresh and high quality ingredients at a fair price. Wonton soup (and it's variants) are my usual orders, however their menu is full of amazing food. Would definitely recommend it, even if you're not a fan of Asian food."}
{"text":"This place is great! We got the pad thai, orange chicken, and their crab rangoons.  The portions are gigantic so we had lots of left overs and the food was delicious.  We can't wait to come back again!"}
{"text":"My wife and I passed a sign advertising an Asian Bistro on the corner of Guadalupe and Higley so we thought , that sounds good for lunch. I found out that the restaurant has only been open for about a week. I had the Kung Pao Shrimp and my wife had the Kung Pao Vegetable plate. Both were extremely good. We started our meal off with a couple of Egg Rolls. Terrific. Service was Fantastic and I expect this Wild Ginger Asian Bistro to be a Complete Success. The whole dining experience was Excellent. I highly recommend it. I also believe that they have a full bar."}
{"text":"Yes I do recommend this restaurant. The food is good and the service was excellent. Very clean too.  Mongolian Chicken and Master Gee chicken were both yummy. Looks like they have a variety of alcohol as well. I had hot tea which went well with dinner."}
{"text":"Our server was really nice and the food was good. 
Quick service. Clean atmosphere. 
We had the shrimp and vegetables w/ fried rice and the HK style noodle soup."}
{"text":"Some of the best Chinese food around. If you can't make a trip to Tempe for Flo's, this is a good alternative. Food has always been served fresh and hot. The crab Rangoon is great and egg rolls are fantastic. Wonton soup is full of ingredients but lacks flavor. Service level varies but no bad experiences."}
{"text":"My family and I have been looking for our go to Chinese takeout spot, and now the search is over! Everything was good, egg rolls are legit. Only down side, they're chili oil/paste isn't very spicy...but we'll be back."}
{"text":"No complaints at all.  Service was excellent.  Mongolian Chicken was fantastic, and the place was very clean and welcoming.  I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Delicious! Had the barbecue pork low mien. Great service and clean, attractive dinning area."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. I love how its family own and operated making this place feel warm and welcoming, not join another chain restaurant.  The food portion for its price is very reasonable. Good portions and good taste, best thing about the food is that it not oily. My favorite is the shrimp egg foo young, they cook it like how I'm use to when I lived back East. My kids love the beef and broccoli and the beef fried rice the most. Its a must each time they come here. Overall I give this place a 5 star due to it being clean, friendly service, great selections."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant on a Tuesday evening. Not too crowded. Nicely decorated restaurant and very clean. The server was knowledgeable about the menu and extremely helpful. We ordered hot and sour soup and an egg roll for an appetizer.  The soup was fantastic. Hot and fresh. By far and away the best hot and sour soup in the Phoenix area. The egg roll was hot and fresh too. The entrees were huge. Wild ginger chicken and Hong Kong Style Pan fried noodles.  Served fresh and hot! High quality ingredients and cooked to perfection! Reasonably priced too! I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! Everything is cooked to perfection.  My favorite dish: chicken chop suey. I also love their pad Thai. Their egg foo young is the best I've had since moving from Chicago 30 years ago. This is a gem of a restaurant!"}
{"text":"We walked in the door and were immediately greeted and seated by the hostess. The restaurant has a warm and inviting atmosphere. While we waited for our entrees, we snacked on a couple of crunchy egg rolls for a appetizer and my husband had a cup of egg drop soup that came with his meal. All was delicious, nothing unique about the appetizer, but as expected. I ordered the daily ramen and my husband ordered the teriyaki chicken. I like that they offer white or brown rice as a option. 
The ramen was very good- brothy and full of fresh veggies and chicken.  My husband really liked his chicken teriyaki as well. 

The whole meal was about $30 before tax and tip. 

Great experience overall! We will definitely come back and bring our three teenagers. There was something there for every body."}
{"text":"Under-impressed with the food for the cost. My Singapore noodles tasted like they were flavored with the packets of ramen I remember all too well from my college days. Other dishes very average."}
{"text":"Wild Ginger has been open about a year.actually my barber is next door. I've seen this restaurant and finally dined there tonight.
Was greeted promptly when we walked in by he owner. Her husband Dave Gee ran the kitchen,  daughter Sammy waits the table.
Menu was easy to read.   Service was above average and friendly.   The food came out in good time and was deliciously hot and fresh.  
Sweet and Sour shrimp was perfectly done with very nice sauce and crisp fresh ingredients. The shrimp was tender and tempura was crisp. Other dish was Hong Cong  style pan fried noodles.  Which was  chicken, beef, and shrimp with vegetables .  Both dishes very delicious.   Recommend it, you'll like it."}
{"text":"Bumped into this place by accident and they just opened this week. Cocktails very good and crab Rangoons wonderful. Nice people and surprise"}
{"text":"Great food! Portions are quite generous. We had the pad Thai  (while not 100% traditional is still very good including hefty amounts of chicken and shrimp), snow pea chicken  (loads of snow peas ms tender chicken)and the kids' chicken lo me in  (too much even from a hungry kiddo!). We started with the Wild Ginger appetizer platter--do not skip this! Very tasty! Consider the house version of a Moscow Mule. It is very refreshing!"}
{"text":"What a shock that great quick Chinese is so close to my house ! I had the roasted pork lunch special and was pleased - I am definitely going to be checking out their other offerings soon."}
{"text":"The walnut shrimp with white rice was a good choice. The BBQ pork strips were yummy too. Great service and clean and comfortable atmosphere."}
{"text":"the orange chicken is really good- not too much or too little breading, not overly sweet & you can actually taste the orange. the pork lo-mein and spring rolls are also really good. hot n sour soup and the fried rice was alright; i was glad to see it wasn't oily.

the only thing we really didn't care for was the cashew chicken. it was fresh with tons of veggies and white meat chicken, but the sauce was very bland and chicken was fatty texture.

i was impressed with how the place is really clean, service is great and helpful, and all the food is fresh. so we will definitely keep going back for the orange chicken and look forward to trying other dishes as its been good each time. give it a try!"}
{"text":"I've read the rave reviews on this place and been wanting to try it, but now that I have, I must say that it is just ok. My husband had the trio (shrimp, scallops, calamari with chicken) and I had the lemongrass chicken,both with fried rice. The food looked beautiful, was perfectly cooked, and had plenty of protein, but the sauces on both were just bland. Fried rice was just rice with soy sauce, no trace of any eggs or veggies. The restaurant is clean and nicely decorated, and service was pleasant and prompt. The food was just rather blah, and for the price I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"We've been searching high and low for a favorite Chinese place in the East Valley. Friday night marked an end to that search when we finally made it to Wild Ginger. Food is delicious. Service is wonderful. Atmosphere is great. Loved it!"}
{"text":"This was a really good choice for us, all four of us were in the mood for something different and Wild Ginger's blend of Asian Fusion fit the bill perfectly. We got two orders of their spicy edamame which was spectacular, by the end of dinner there wasn't any left. My brother in law also tried their Wild Ginger wings which were very good. I had their Chef's ramen bowl special, which was very tasty, but could have used a little more flavor and more veggies. The only downside was with their beef. My husband always orders the Beef and Broccoli if it's on the menu, he's a creature of habit, there's no changing him! The flavor was on point, but the beef lacked quality. To say the least it was on the tough and chewy side, and my husband ate around most of it. On the bright side, he did finish all of the broccoli on his plate! Additionally, I don't remember the name of the dish my sister ordered, but it had chicken, beef, and shrimp, and she also felt the beef was low quality. That being said the flavors were so good, we would definitely try it again."}
{"text":"Delicious! My 9yr old son loved the pot stickers and so did I. Service was great and the food came quickly."}
{"text":"Awesome awesome food! The orange chicken was amassaaazzzzing. Hot and sour soup was great! So was the spicy garlic edamame. New favorite in town"}
{"text":"Everything eas super fresh. K had the Sweet & Sour Chicken which she said was very fresh tasting. Grandma C had the Chicken & Vegetables. She also felt her dish tasted very fresh. The chicken & vegetables were properly cooked with a slightly sweet sauce. I had Kung Pao Chicken. This dish was good and not too spicy."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend LOVE Asian food and we just moved to Gilbert and decided to try this place out. We ordered the lemongrass chicken and butterscotch pork belly. Everything was amazing! Melt in your mouth meats and amazing service, we are leaving more than happy. We will be back!"}
{"text":"An amazing find. Friendly staff explained the entire amazing flavors. So amazing that the owner, Kathy, tracked me down on Facebook because I left the food I was unable to consume."}
{"text":"Went to lunch with my friend and the menu is generally Amer Asian cuisines that cater to mostly American taste.  It is a decent food that I would considered ordinary chop shey house so I probably will NOT return."}
{"text":"Today was the first time I had tried this restaurant. We had the orange chicken and pad thai. The orange chicken was the best I have ever had! It wasn't over sauced or very sweet like most places. The pad Thai was also really good. It was different than others I have tried, but different in a good way. It was delicious! I will be eating here again!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch, it wasnt busy at all I was surprised. The food was so good! The portions were plenty even though I got the lunch combo. The water tasted a little strange so I swapped for soda. I would come back for sure!"}
{"text":"I thought this was a great choice for dinner I loved my meal it was very delicious I also got crab puffs and mochi for dessert so good"}
{"text":"The place was a nice fresh of breath air. It was wonderful and the food was delicious. I dined in for dinner and the portion sizes are a perfect size to share or yourself. I got the Sweet and Sour pork with fried rice and mother got the Kung Pao Chicken. The potstickers were so good! Overall, it was a great experience and I will definitely be coming back or ordering to-go!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious and service was excellent! Definitely highly recommend and will be returning again soon."}
{"text":"Wow outstanding food I haven't had any really good Chinese food in awhile with excellence service. One of my most favorite dishes at this restaurant is wild ginger chicken, orange chicken and the pad Thai they are very  delicious. The restaurant is really nice. Is was very easy too located it. Service is really good they tend to your needs. Portion size for what you are paying for is fair. So I would recommend you anyone coming here, for sure I am coming back to eat here again."}
