{"text":"Cool atmosphere but the service might be the worst in Charlotte. I would suggest ordering drinks in multiples."}
{"text":"This is such a fun place!!! The gaming hostess Mary is such a sweetheart,  and our server Sydni was awesome! Our group of 6 had some amazing food, drinks and service & we can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome...but service was SLOW. All bartenders avoided eye contact to serve. We had 2 drinks in 3 hours, and when I tried to get in a food order (queso and chips!) it was 20 mins past kitchen times...would have been in on time had ANYONE cared to make eye contact!"}
{"text":"Good bar food. Great place to just hangout with friends and play a few games. Also good for those raining days when you need to be indoors but still want to have some fun."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for Queens Park Social; games, alcohol, and food all in one spot. However I cannot help but feel slightly disappointed after dining at QPS. Drinks (while very, very strong; perhaps a pro, perhaps a con depending on your preference) are overpriced and food is much of the same. I ordered the mesquite steak wrap, medium; after various negative experiences in my life going medium rare on steak, I've learned most places tend to undercook vs overcook. The food took a very long time to come out, the same was true for my party's drinks as well. The food was good, no doubt, but I couldn't help but ask myself \"was this 12th dollars good?\" No, is the conclusion I reached. 

All of this was not insurmountable on my quest for an enjoyable experience however two things in particular proved to sink the ship of hope.  The first was service. While I am extremely quick to judge, I'm often right. It's a blessing and a curse. Our server was quite lackadaisical and inattentive; at one point after chugging down my \"The Dude\" (Tito's vodka, kahlua, some heavy cream; $9) he immediately appeared asking if I'd like another. After declining (someone has to be the designated driver) he walked off, ignoring the fact that everyone on my table needed water refills and neglecting to bus the empty glasses. I know this sounds petty but I feel like it was relatively emblematic of the attention we would (not) receive. 

The second thing that took the wind out of my sails was the noise level. While I realize bringing this up may cause many to discount my review as pedantic and the ramblings of a living, walking, breathing wet blanket, I would be remiss if I didn't point out that this place is LOUD. Just maybe something to consider. 

Queens Park Social is a nice place; there are a lot of people who seem to be having a great time. Maybe going on a Saturday night wasn't the right move, I get that. I would probably consider giving it another shot. I can't really recommend it at this point for me though. I'm just one of 40-something reviews though. Hell, what do I know."}
{"text":"I have been living in Charlotte for 10 years now and had family come in for the weekend. I wanted to bring them somewhere with a fun atmosphere so we came to queen park. I am only giving this 2 stars at all because the place is cool and the food was decent. If it wasn't for that I would leave 0. I have never had worse service in my entire life. We had to chase down servers for everything...to order, to get refills on drinks and multiple times to check where our meal was. It seemed like the place had million people working there but no one was doing anything, just wandering around. It was a terrible first impression for myself and my family from NY. Disappointed is an understatement. It made me not want to go back."}
{"text":"Outstanding experience all the way around! Great food, great service. Charlotte has been needing this place. Best burger and chicken fingers in town."}
{"text":"First and last time at this establishment. Apathetic and under-achieving service by all four servers I saw wandering the side of the restaurant I was sitting. Even though I was sitting and actively looking at a menu (that I had to get up and retrieve) not one of the servers walking by stopped to ask if I wanted to order anything. I finally hailed one of them and asked her if she was working this section. She replied with a nod of her head and an \"unfortunately\" look on her face. I asked for the Steak Wrap but was told they were out of steak. O.k., I asked her to give me a few minutes while I relooked the menu. However, I did want a beer and a water; which I ordered. She never came back. About 15 minutes later I was able to catch her eye. Ordered a buffalo chicken sandwich with regular fries and \"reordered\" the beer and water she never brought. She said she needed a card. I always pay cash and do not like handing over my bank or credit cards. However, seeing how busy it was with the game fans, I understood and gave her a card.  Waited another 15-20 minutes, still no water or beer. Another employee, a guy with a bun, was speaking to someone else at the long table. As he started to walk away I said \"excuse me\". He reluctantly came over. Seriously, no customer service by any of them. No smile, no thank you, no-nothing! Baffles me. I politely and nicely, asked him if he could find out where my beer and water was, then thanked him. He looked at me, never said a word and walked away. About 10 minutes later I saw him walking into a side room with what I assume was his dinner. How nice! Someone got food and drink! Never got my beer and told her to take it off the check when she came back later. No apology for never bringing it. My sandwich came out with brown fries. Yes, I am aware that one side of the fry has the skin attached. All of the fries were brown. At first I thought perhaps they gave me sweet potato fries by mistake. No, they were just brown, soggy and cold. The sandwich was pounded so thin that it was overcooked and all I could taste was the buffalo sauce. The bleu cheese I asked for when I ordered, was not delivered with the food. I would like to mention here that there was ONE PERSON that I encountered, the young guy who brought out the food, who had a smile on his face, was pleasant and happily brought me the bleu cheese I ordered. A shame he is stuck back in the kitchen. When I I finally asked for my check, she brought it to me and then said she had to find a pen. I said, I didn't need one. I was paying cash. However, she had already charged my card without asking if that was how I wanted to pay. Then tells me it may take up to ten days for the refund to show up on my account. Such an unpleasant experience. Far too many cool places to spend my money in Charlotte to settle for this mess. Unhappy, apathetic, low-energy employees; make for unhappy customers."}
{"text":"What a great environment!!! All of the staff was super friendly and very accommodating! Bowling was a blast!! You could be low key or turn up and have a great time. A great addition to the Charlotte scene!!!"}
{"text":"The place was packed on a Saturday night, but I advise to not get a table and food. The food was actually decent, but we almost walked out based on the wait for someone to take our order and the wait to then get appetizers. And the wait person also did not ask us if we wanted another drink or anything. Miss for the owners on that one. There are many other bars in close proximity where we will drink instead. 

My suggestion is to hire more wait staff to deal with the large tables and separate checks. And to advise your servers to check in more often and clear empty plates as they go. Staring at a table full of eaten food is just gross."}
{"text":"Love this place and love the area! Dog friendly, great atmosphere, delicious food. The shrimp quesadilla, chip trio, burger, and steak salad were all . I'm look forward to coming back to try the brunch. I was also excited to see the overseas age group. All age groups seemed to enjoy themselves. Queen park is a great addition to the south end!"}
{"text":"This place is full of all the best games for adults! It has bowling, shuffleboard (regular and table), ping pong, hot shot, giant Jenga, giant connect 4, corn hole, skee-ball, darts, an arcade golf and boxing game, and air hockey. It has good local Beers. The staff was super friendly, especially Wayne who treated us like good friends. He definitely deserves a raise for excellent customer service! The only downside is that you have to pay for most of the games. I guess that's to be expected."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place.  However, the drinks are overpriced yet served in PLASTIC cups.  I wasn't ordering a draft beer, but a top shelf call brand cocktail. My opinion of the place tanked further from there, as a watched groups of servers busy chatting with each other or on the their phones as customers waited.  Hope they do better in the future since I will go again, just to see if it was just opening issues."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, plenty of fun activities. Always end up spending a good chunk of time here. Only issue is beardy the bartender wearing glasses. Make your customers feel welcome. Don't initiate a request by yelling \"you guys can't be at this part of the bar. get the **** out of here.\" over an honest mistake and there being no communication of the restricted area. Other than the one sour note, the rest of the establishment is great."}
{"text":"I went here for a corporate event. They had reserved the bowling section as well as the section outside. There were at least 50-60 of us but we only had 1 server who we would have to hunt down in order to get a drink. Drinks took FOREVER to get (I only managed 2 beers over 2.5 hours) and often involved hunting down the server for a second time. With my second beer he claimed he couldnt find me, even though I hadn't moved, and just left it on a table for me to find. The food was cold and sub-par. They came without labels so we had to guess what were in the sliders. The server preferred to chat it up with people instead of actually serving, particularly when they allowed people not in our group to come in and take over the one area. When our happy hour time was up, a young man came around and rudely said 'are you guys done because we need to clean up and your happy hour is over'. 

Cool place, crappy food, and even crappier service. Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Overpriced bland food (I needed a lot of hot sauce to improve everything), no change machine but an ATM so games are out of the question needs a lot of work, spent a hundred bucks on a few drinks and basic bar food.
Here's hoping it improves as it has potential."}
{"text":"This review is only based on food & prices. I have played the games here and it's a great time and nice set up. However, prices are ridiculous. We ordered a trio with chips; queso, salsa & guac for $11. The chip to dip ratio was WAY off so we asked for more chips....which they charge $1 for. Not only that, but the chips were terrible! Flimsy and not seasoned. I also paid $8 for a \"craft\" beer. Not worth it."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love games?  Queen Park Social, though a bit further out from Uptown than I normally venture, is located on a fun little strip of breweries and other social hang out spots and is great for group activities.  There's stuff that caters to everyone here, including bowling and cornhole, both of which I partook in during my particular visit.

The staff are relatively friendly, though I had to wait an extra good 5+ min or so while the lady behind the bowling counter chatted with her friend who was also at the counter, who I'm not even sure was buying anything.  She almost pretended like I wasn't there.  Oh well.  Prices are fair.  I think we paid $40 something dollars for an hour of bowling which I guess is kind of expensive for a city like Charlotte.  Shoes are required, but apparently you don't actually have to put them on.

Cornhole only requires you leave your drivers license up at the front desk and they give you the bean bags.  I believe there were 2-3 sets of cornhole outside in the back.  They have some lighting back there so you can still play at night.  Love cornhole!

Ambience was decent on a Wednesday night... it was a summer night and people didn't have school, so there was a decent amount of people, but it was definitely not crowded.  I think the group of 15-20 or so we had made the night.  There was music, but nothing blaring in your ears like some of the other reviewers state - maybe because it was a weekday?  

I can't comment on the food since we didn't have any of it, but the drinks were flowing all night.  Service was decent.

Great place for group events, but be ready to shell out a little."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great spot to catch a game or hang with friends. Perfect menu (try the sliders) and drink selection too. Will be back!"}
{"text":"3 hours of my life I'll never get back! Worst service I've ever had in my life and I am a very understanding person and tried to give the guy a break. Had to ask 4 times for silverware! Gave our drinks to the table beside us not once but twice! Honest to goodness took Almost 45 minutes to get our drinks and did I mention I was the DD and all I ordered was a water and NEVER GOT IT! Will never ever go back here and will NEVER speak one good word about it! Oh and I forgot when we got our drinks for the table the waiter forgot what beer one of us had ordered so he thought he could smell the beer and figure it out, well the tip of his nose went in the beer and he still tried to serve it to my friend!!! This place is a joke! The food also came out almost an hour and a half later and was cold and soggy and not worth what was charged for it!"}
{"text":"The space itself is cool. It is extremely spacious, a ton of seating, outdoor seating, a large bar, bowling and some other indoor games. 

I went on a sunday night and it was not very busy at all, the bar wasnt even half full. With that being said, it still took a really long time to order a drink. The margaritas were good, but oh my goodness, the Dancing Bear cocktail was by far the worst drink I have ever tasted in my life. It needs to be taken off the menu, everyone I was with tried some of mine and no one could drink it. It tasted like straight up cough syrup. My other friends got different cocktails on the menu and werent impressed either. 

The chicken fingers were pretty good, and the bowling was fun. I would have given this place 4 stars, but the cocktails are very expensive to not even be halfway decent."}
{"text":"Please note...I have yet or should say am 99% sure I will ever come here...Was going to make this a question but it was to long apparently...

Drinks seem abnormally high according to the menu ($6.50 is the least expensive beer) also the $10 & $11 mixed drinks? Those prices are close to concert and baseball game prices.  Whatever happened to a good ole Bud light for $3 or even $4?  All kinds of weird beer names...

That food menu is pretty solid but again, prices way to high for a place like this.  Bad enough half the entertainment you have to pay for...No pool tables?  Really?  $1.00 for a game of air hockey?  Pay to play shuffleboard?  

Sure would be nice to have SOMEONE, open up a facility such as this that has it all and not have to break the bank to go there.  

As much as I am NOT a fan of the Piedmont Social House...Least I won't go broke there, just hungry cause their menu blows...Which is why, since I need to make this a \"review\" I will give it a 2 because I can't speak about service, taste of food, ambiance, or clientele but I CAN and WILL write about what I know before even stepping foot inside"}
{"text":"This place is fun to hang out and play games but PLEASE don't come expecting great food. My fries were burnt. Chicken wings over cooked. Burger over cooked. It's like the chef was tasked to overcook everything. The ironic part is the menu isn't cheap (well bar food cheap neways). They charge real restaurant (for Charlotte) prices. Bar food isn't hard to execute. They should be ashamed at the product they are putting out."}
{"text":"This is an entertaining sports bar with games and fun for friends. We met friends who have young kids and they like this bar because there are games Like shuffleboard, air hockey, bowling, jenga, some arcade games and skeetball. I think their beer menu is okay but not amazing, I had White Zombie beer. We didn't eat but the menu looks like standard bar food. Sitting at a table in the game room we had kind of slow service during NFL games but I guess they were busy. Parking is easy when it's not a big crowd."}
{"text":"New place with some potential, drink specials with a decent bloody mary.  Chicken tenders are actually chicken breasts today, which was odd, if they call them tenders all the time.  Grease could use a change, the skin on fries were a bit soggy.   Our initial waitress disappeared, another slid in to help.   Went for lunch and looks to have a lot of diversions for fun, will give it another try."}
{"text":"I've been to Queen Park Social three times since moving down to Charlotte.

What can be said? It's a great space for group drinking and drinking activities. They have a game side of the space where you can play shuffleboard, pop n' shot basketball, giant jenga, foosball, etc. They've got a bowling section where you can reserve lanes and shoes and play a few frames with your friends. Then they've got a larger bar area connected to a restaurant/seating area and all of that next to a nice outdoor patio drinking area.

They've really got it all.

Drink and food prices aren't unreasonable and they're both pretty good quality!

I've also had a work event here on the restaurant/table side of the space and it was very well run. The food was delicious (especially the steak tacos and wings) and the service was great."}
{"text":"I was super excited to visit Queen Park Social! Before my birthday visit , I scoped the place out. It's very spacious with room for both small and large parties. I spoke to Ashley who was very helpful. She showed me the brunch and all day menu. Joe, one of the other managers, was also very helpful. 

A glance at the brunch menu had me excited for my visit. Brunch and bowling? Sold! We arrived shortly before 1pm on Saturday. The left  side of the joint was empty with a few people sprinkled around the bar. The bowling area was empty. We set up our party on the high top tables in that area. I walked in ready to order a couple of brunch dishes and a mimosa! I was disappointed to find that brunch menu wasn't being offered yet :(. It took me awhile to get over that blow. 

Our waitress, Shay, was very apologetic and offered her suggestions from the lunch menu. We ordered the grilled lemon pepper wings, the fried chipotle wings, fried buffalo wings, sliders, shrimp quesadilla, cheese fries, guacamole and ranchero salsa. The lemon pepper wings were awesome! Flavorful and hot with a nice char. The chipotle wings were tasty too; just the right amount of spice. I was so impressed by the burger...it was cooked perfectly! I usually don't do seafood and cheese but this quesadilla broke all the rules. Now, about the drinks...I originally ordered the lemon basil margarita. I looooove fresh herbs in my cocktail and was excited to try this cocktail only because of the basil. I was disappointed when I received the cocktail sans basil :(. I then decided to order the Gekko...again no fresh herbs :(. So I went with a simple mule...vodka, ginger beer, lime..it was perfect! We overall had great service and a great experience at QP Social! I can't wait for the brunch menu! Here's a run down of the good and the needs improvement. 

The good:
You can eat and drink in the bowling area 
Tasty food
Lots of room
Good service


Kinks to work out:
Booking for parties 
Keeping fresh ingredients on hand for cocktails"}
{"text":"This was my second time going, and thought it was pretty cool and looked family friendly. However this time, there were people at the bar (that looked overserved on the multiple shots I watched them down) that started VAPING!!! OMG....I couldn't believe my eyes. It is 2017 and we STILL allow this poor behavior??? When I asked a server to have the man go outside to smoke, he came back to tell me that it IS allowed inside there. Then I asked for the owner, the manager came over, I expressed my concerns and she said \"Its legal\"!
When you or someone you are with that has lung issues (Cancer, Cystic Fibrosis, Asthma, COPD, just to name a few) and cannot be around smoke or for those of us that don't want to secondhand smoke your bad habit.... stay far away from this place. I told them they have lost my business until they change this policy and that I will spread the word to everyone I know. Because as far as I am concerned they are discriminating against ALL of the people that don't want to deal with the smoke to save a few people from having to step outside!! Smoking has been banned inside for a reason, do you really want to subject your clientele to vaping to find out it was just as dangerous as a cigarette???? Step up and do the right thing so we ALL can enjoy and help make your business a success!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! So much fun for events and gatherings with friends. The food is really good, the salmon is my favorite!! The bartenders are all so amazing... especially Keegan... HE IS THE SWEETEST! And not to mention some eye candy (;"}
{"text":"A quick update - my company was trying to host an event here and we reached out for weeks with no follow up or response from the mangers or host. 

Every call to the restaurant we were told that \"someone would call us back\". 

Super frustrating. Finally, we've received a response...and  if we do decide to go with them let's hope that it's a positive experience."}
{"text":"Place is very very similar to Piedmont social, but it caters more to the 30-under crowd.  These sorts of places that are popping up nationwide are always a cool concept.  And, what makes it even cooler is the fact it's located right by two breweries and a distillery.  This area of town is carving a niche out for itself as a mini hang out district (don't be fooled, it's not really in South End)."}
{"text":"Definitely has a cool concept. It was my first time. The game area is a bit disheveled. As you enter that area... There is no sign indicating what's free to play with and what is not. My husband and I walked around for a few minutes trying to figure it all out. Finally we stood at one of the high tables just observing. We ended up asking a guy who seemed to work there what the deal was with the games. He shared what was free and what we needed to pay for. He mentioned darts, and said it was in the outside area. We definitely wanted to try that, so as we got outside there were none. I'm not sure if they only have them during certain times of the year, due to weather. But we were disappointed we couldn't play. 

Overall, it's a neat place once you figure it out."}
{"text":"Interesting concept. Millennial is definitely the target. Acoustics are a little rough. Beer selection is outstanding. Patio is great. Service was spotty when I went, at the bar, but they were slammed."}
{"text":"Their service is terrible because their management is unprofessional and disrespectful. When we had an issue with our tab we asked to explain it to the manager. We were told he was just going to \"be a bigger d*ck to us than he was to her.\" When we left, one of the managers chased us out into the street demanding to know why his server was crying. We explain that we weren't the ones making her cry and she told us it was because her manager was a \"d***\" He stated it wasn't him she was referring to but he knew which manager it was. They really need to get their staff and management under control. I couldn't believe the entire interaction. The concept of the place is great. Hopefully, they make some changes in their staff for a positive turnaround. I'd like to go back and not feel like the staff is part of some high school \"first jobs\" reality show."}
{"text":"Hailey was our waitress and we got the wrong food and an extra plate we ordered never changed then she charged us for it. This would have been fine but when we told her we didn't ever get the fries she acted like we were lying so just letting you know of this horrible experience"}
{"text":"For it to be a busy Saturday evening, service was fast and the food was good. The space is huge and very inviting. Lots of games and even a small bowling alley. We will be back."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times and it always wonderful. 
The service is outstanding, the food is to die for and the atmosphere is fun and energetic. 
I will keep coming back here and I recommend that everyone go out and check this place out. 
The tacos are street style and I suggest getting the shrimp because it has been cooked perfectly every time I've ordered them. 
My friend got the Queen Park burger and he is super picky about the way burgers are cooked but he had no complaints. 
10/10. Seriously go check this place out!"}
{"text":"We took our office to Queen Park Social yesterday for our Christmas party. Everyone had a great time. Perhaps the best Christmas party we have ever had. The staff at Queen Park Social were the absolute best. Our \"assigned staff\" person rocked!!! We laughed, bowled, ate, drank and laughed some more!!! The facility was excellent but the people who work at that place make it all of that and a bag of chips. -Jason E. Taylor"}
{"text":"Queen Park social is just that...it's an entertainment center with something for everyone in an open free flowing floor plan.  Great place to go and have drinks, some interactive fun and be social with friends and other like minded fun attractive people.  Full wrap around inside bar, TVs everywhere, bowling, shuffleboard, and many more gaming options.  Try the burgers and wings...delicious, I'll def be back"}
{"text":"2 stars just for how cool the actual space is. But 0 stars for wait staff and food. Waited for 23 minutes after being seated to be greeted by a server. Severely understaffed. 1 waitress with a bad attitude to take care of one whole section. Didn't mind the wait for the food, but had to go to the bar to order drinks while we waited to order from our server. Got a cheeseburger that was over-cooked and my wife got the nachos with chicken which was just overall gross. 

Spoke with manager Ross who was not around at all. Told us that the section we were sitting is not guaranteed a server, though we were sitting in a booth on the restaurant side. No problem but no one told this. It sounded rather ridiculous but whatever. He comped the nachos and told me that \"a lot of people like their food\" I said ok and thank you and left. 

I love that they have a space to watch Miami Dolphins games but wouldn't go back due to very poor service and lackluster food."}
{"text":"Love that this place is more than just a bar! There's so many games and activities and love the clean crisp atmosphere of the white brick and neon signs.The drinks are reasonably priced. I have never tried the food here. 

Beware of the weekend crowds though, on a Friday night we had to stalk out a few groups finishing up their games to get a chance."}
{"text":"Fun place. Very crowded on the weekends. Fun place to go. Food was good too. Good value also. Staff was friendly."}
{"text":"We walked over to watch a couple of football games. We noticed that one of the rooms was completely empty except for a few people finishing up their noon game. 

We asked for them to turn to the games we wanted to watch and at first they refused to do so. 

The games we requested were Alabama vs. Auburn and NCSU vs. UNC. WE WERE THE ONLY PEOPLE IN THE ROOM. They refused to change to the games we requested. We had at group of 10-12 ready to spend 3 hours and money. 

We spoke with the manager and he refused to change as well. 

We took our people and money to Moosehead. 

First and last trip to that place."}
{"text":"I had the chance to visit for a couple and drinks and dinner with my friend the other night. We put our names on the list for a table and was told it would be about 45 minutes. It's definitely a popular spot, we had a hard time finding an open space at the bar to order a drink. 

We were able to order after a few minutes and my friend got the Aloe Vera Margarita and I got the Cousin Eddy. As soon as my friend put her mouth on her cup there was a long black hair connected to it that went in her mouth which is pretty gross. We told the bartender immediately and she apologized and started making a new drink. She didn't offer to comp the drink, instead she gave us these two really gross shots that we didn't take more than a sip of (she didn't even tell us what they were).

About 10 minutes after putting our name down we got a text saying our table was ready. We sat down ordered food and were served promptly. The food was good, nothing to write home about but definitely nothing to complain about. At the table I ordered a drink that I can't remember the name of now but it was pink and came in a wine glass and my friend got a beer because she didn't want to risk another hair in her drink.

Overall it was a good experience and it's a cute place. I wish they served all of their drinks in glass cups as opposed to plastic because I feel like that cheapens an otherwise really gorgeous space."}
{"text":"I was disappointed in the service at Queen Park Social. This was my second time here. My first time was about two weeks after they opened and it was for brunch. The service at that time was great and the brunch was good. This time was different because of the lack luster service. Where do I start with the service. I was at a 4 top table and only two of us ordered drinks. I ordered a mule and a water and my friend ordered a daiquiri. Both of which are on the menu. 15 minutes later, our server came back and told my friend they couldn't make a daiquiri becuase they don't have a blender behind the bar. Um then why is it on the menu?! Then he asked me what did I order again for my drink. Smh. I told him a mule and that I also needed a water and my friend ordered a berry social. At that same time another person at our table ordered a round of lemon drop shots for 5 ppl and I also ordered some queso dip. Another 10 minutes later, the server brought the mule and my friend's berry social. My mule was horrible, it was way too sweet and my friend's drink didn't have berries in it. I sent my drink back and the lemon drop shots were horrible, they didn't taste like lemon at all. Another girl at the table noticed that my friend's drink didn't have berries either because she got the samw drink earlier. My friend asked the server  why she didn't have any berries in her drink. His reply was, oh, I thought you ordered a Socially Acceptable. So needless to say, he got the order wrong. He then told us that we would have to leave at 8pm bc of the fight party starting at that time. At this point it's about 7:30pm and I still hadn't gotten my queso that I ordered 25 mins ago. At that point I asked him to cancel the order if it wasn't ready yet and he said okay. Another 10 mins later I still didn't have water but he brought the queso. I told him that I canceled it and he said it was sitting back there a while so he brought it. I ordered that queso 30 mins ago and now I only had a few mins to eat it before we had to leave. I finally got my water too. The service was slow and disjointed. And there wasn't a need for the service to be that slow and disjointed. Needless to say, I won't be back for a while."}
{"text":"Totally awesome atmosphere for any age! The food was great, service was wonderful, the cocktails were on point. My favorite thing was the giant connect four game that was near the ski ball machines!! Awesome time had by all!"}
{"text":"Today was the Lobster and Wine Dinner. Brought my ticket on Eventbrite for $60. It includes lobster and shrimp boil and all the wine you can drink. I think I ate maybe $35 worth of food. But the food and servers are awesome. The lobster was cooked perfectly.. And staffs was there to assisted us in every step of the way.. And our chef came out with baskets and baskets of shrimp, red potatoes, corns and sausages that we couldn't keep up.. I really enjoy these type of events. You meet new people and I'm glad I wasn't the only one who didn't know how to crack open a whole lobster. If they host some kind of events like this again. Count me it. It was awesome!"}

{"text":"I'll start by saying this is my first review...ever. I felt so strongly about my experience that I needed to write a review. 

First and foremost, the restaurant and gaming areas are extremely nice, well kept and the food is very good. 

Secondly- the service is atrocious. I've been to QPS about 5 times total with different groups for lunches, dinners, or simply drinking a few at the bar. Across the board the service is below par. Bar tenders are inattentive, lazy, and lack any energy especially for that type of bar. 

My last visit - I waited 15 mins at my table for the waitress to arrive. I gave up and went to the bar. After returning to my table the waitress only came by the table twice in and hour and half to check on refills. When we were finally ready to leave, we waited 25 minutes for the waitress to come by to simply ask for our check. A member of our party went to the bar to ask if he could help us out and his reply was \"yeah she is around here somewhere if you want to go find her\". ....Really?? 

Long story short - food is good, bar and gaming area are amazing, service is terrible."}
{"text":"I am very disappointed with the service here. This could be partially due to the fact that they are a new establishment, however that does not excuse the lack of service delivery execution. Upon visiting for the very first time, I walked up to the bar and ordered the Gekko. The bartender was very friendly and acknowledged my order, but 10 minutes later after waiting at the bar and seeing others receive a drink before me, I politely asked if mine would be coming up soon, she apologized and said she forgot to make my drink, which was not a big deal since it was the weekend. Then she went on to explain that it was her first day on the job (on a Saturday!?!?!) and she needed to look up the recipe even though it was in the menu. After receiving my drink, I had to remind her that I needed to pay for my order which took another few minutes. 

Later in the evening we were seated (table of 5), and a different waitress took our order. We called out which menu items we wanted as appetizers and which ones as main entrees. She took down our order and did not return for another 30 minutes. We asked if the appetizers would be coming out soon, and she said she would check on them. However we noticed that she walked to the back to enter our order. She completely forgot to put in our order! Second time tonight this happened! Eventually a different waitress came to our table to give us an order of cold cheese fries, which we're not acceptable. A manager later came over and our group explained that we waited close to 45 minuets just  for 3 wing orders and two burgers, and only received cold fries. The manager apologized and took the cold fries, offering drinks in exchange, however we declined and asked to at least have an appetizer. By the time an hour passed, we finally received our food ( even though some of the orders were mixed up) and our cheese fries never returned. 

This is unfortunately the poorest review I've posted on Yelp thus far. I am rating them two stars since my orders were lost twice in one night, all of my food came out cold and late, and my appetizer never returned. I love the atmosphere of this place which is why they are receiving two stars, but they need to hire more seasoned workers for non-beer customers who wish to sit down and eat."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, but the bartenders are horrible. They take forever and then mess up your drinks, plus charge you for drinks you never get. D'Lauren needs to be replaced."}
{"text":"This place can not handle a large group. It took the kitchen more than 1.5 hours to bring our food for a group of 10. By the time the food came out, most of them are stone cold. The chicken tacos were charcoal burnt. I never did receive my food and management did not seem to care. Definitely will not be coming back."}
{"text":"My experience started with ordering a Tito's and soda and a craft beer at the bar. My total was $20, not the problem. My issue was the fact that the receipt wasn't itemized. I could have been charged for anything! Also when I arrived I used the restroom. Three of the five bathroom stalls were out of toilet paper, no paper by the sinks only hand dryers. One of the toilet seats was also covered in poop while the bowl was completely empty. I then went to bowl for an hour and a half (the screen counts down). When I used the bathroom again, still no toilet paper! They also put a sign on the stall with poop on the toilet lid saying it was broken instead of cleaning it. THINK TWICE BEFORE ORDERING FOOD. This place is filthy."}
{"text":"If you asked me a couple of months I would've raved about this place. Tonight was a different experience. I will no longer return with my friends. The drink service was absolutely terrible, the drinks were imbalanced - too heavy on the soda. The 2nd drink I had I was charged at full price but did not even contain the main ingredient, mint! Why would you not take the common courtesy to explain to your customer the absence of mint? Additionally, if your bar is relatively empty - multiple bartenders should not walk by you and not take your drink order. Unbelievable horrid experience."}
{"text":"Honestly I had high hopes for this new hangout but it fell very short of the standards I thought it would live up to. The good: the food was actually good. The fries were home made, crisp and delicious. The ranch is homemade so they win points for that. The classic burger was about a 6/10, just a standard burger, nothing that knocks your socks off. The chicken tacos were average as well. The chicken tenders were some of the best we've ever had. 
The cons: the waitress told us the pitcher served 6-8 but it really only poured 5 10 ounce glasses which was disappointing. The service is EXTREMELY lacking. The waitress was enthusiastic but she may have been overworked so I'm not sure if it was all her fault. The kitchen did not bring out food out at the same. My husbands food came out 10 minutes after mine. One of the girls in our group ordered a drink and it never came. 

In summary, They have good potential but the servers absolutely need more training and probably more servers. Don't come here expecting to be in and out in under and hour or expecting good service."}
{"text":"If you like getting terrible service with an attitude then this is the place for you. The ladies who run the bowling lanes don't care if you don't know how the process works and won't take the time to explain it to you either. We just paid $70 and I don't even know what we paid for. Wouldn't give an itemized receipt and also showed me off when I tried to ask. I told her I wasn't planning on playing and she said \"I don't care\" multiple times and rolled her eyes at me. Some party took over all the seating and most of the lanes so we had nowhere to put our things. People were in our lane the whole time. It was a truly terrible experience. Will not be returning and will definitely not recommend this place to our friends."}
{"text":"Even on a busy night the bartenders were fairly attentive. Menu is limited and could use an upgrade. My boyfriend had the cheeseburger flatbread which really was just bread and some bbq sauce. 
Bowling was great though! You couldn't hear all the pins and bowling balls anywhere in the building except when bowling. Really put some money into the noise barriers.
I spent about 2.5 hours people watching, bowling and having a beverage. There are lots of activities but crowded is crowded. It seems spacious in some areas but others are tightly packed and it gets warm quick. 
The crowd was both young and old. A good mix of demographics overall but a little heavier on the hipster grouping. Something different for a night with friends but maybe not for a date."}
{"text":"What a disappointment. The poor service was hard to get past, including missed food items, incorrect drink orders, and incorrect check. Felt like we were continuously waiting for mistakes to be corrected. Lack of care from staff across the establishment. Will not be back. For reference, we went with group of ten at 6:30pm on a Saturday. Was not crowded when we were there.

Many better options in the nearby area."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place but needs to make a few adjustments before I'm completely sold. Service needs improvement, I shouldn't have to constantly make eye contact with my server who's sitting at the bar, just because it's slow. Food: it's okay not horrible but just okay. We order chicken wings and fries,  the fries were amazing but the flavor of the wings weren't what we expected. We ordered chipotle honey,  can only tatse the honey and mango BBQ,  can only taste the BBQ. Games: thumbs up,  no complaints here."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The food and drinks were excellent. I wish I got the name of our server because he was really good. He was very attentive and friendly. He made a point to come find us when we are bowling to make sure everything was ok. I also love that you can swipe your credit card to play the games. Makes it so much easier!"}
{"text":"This place is sooo good!! First time here and we'll definitely be back! First the charge $25 for hour bowling doesn't matter how many people! And you can spend hours here they have so many games!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool.  Overall it's a bit too pricey for me personally the value is really not that bad at all.  The food is not too shabby either.  They have these chicken nachos and they are so good.  I tried their chicken tenders as well those were bomb too since they are like homemade or something.  It's not what you'd expect like normal chicken tenders you normally find.  I was impressed by the seasoning and flavors.  They make good fries both regular and sweet potato ones.  It was kind of crowded when I came and a lot of people were upset because Adams Beverages had rented out the lanes and games from 3 to 6.  So normally you'd be able to bowl and play a bunch of cool things.  They had a bar so you can get your drink on.  The atmosphere was really fun and energetic.  The bathrooms were decent, up to date, clean for the most part.  I'll tell you this trick if you wanna go when it's not that crowded check Google Maps.  It will usually show you a live view of how busy it is there.  Oh yeah don't forget those sliders those were super bomb too!  

I'm ready to go back with friends and I'd recommend planning a longer visit if you want to get the full experience."}
{"text":"I dropped into Queen Park Social on a Sunday afternoon to check it out and grab lunch.  We walked in around 12 p.m. to an almost empty venue.  Fortunately, that made for very quick seating in the dining area.  You can order food in the dining area, the bar, the game rooms and the outdoor patio.  

The menu is diverse bar food - salads, burgers, tacos.  We ordered a cobb salad with steak and a big burger.  The food did take a while to come out, especially considering there weren't any other tables ordering food at the time.  But, it was very tasty.  The steak on my salad was a generous portion and cooked a perfect medium rare.  The burger was also cooked a perfect medium and and included a big slice of queso fresca and guacamole - yum!  Our server, who only had one table, hovered a bit but that should shake out with more experience and more tables.  

The patio looked great - maybe 12 tables, some with shade.  Dogs are welcome to lounge on the patio with their people.  

The bar has 18 taps - many of which were empty after a busy Saturday night.  There were maybe 6 dedicated to local taps - I'd love to see that increased.  There's also a full bar option with plenty of specialty cocktails. 

We weren't there to play games this time, but the area looked fun - albeit smaller than I imagined.  There's an 8-lane bowling alley, 2 shuffleboards, and a couple of pool tables.  It's a neat idea - but I'd like to see the practicality of it on a busy night.  Seems like a relatively few number of people could overpower the game space, but I could be completely off on that.

Overall, great addition to LoSo!"}
{"text":"Came here for food after the Love Desserts festival at Sugar Creek Brewery gave us a sugar rush. We sat at the bar, with a few large tvs and ordered cocktails. The cocktails were roughly $10-14. 
 
Purse hooks at the bar = great. Also the chairs at the bar are comfy, not just stools, they have a back! Haha. I feel old writing that as part of my review, but whatever. 

We ordered the trio dip with guac, salsa and queso. Honestly, I didn't eat the salsa, but guac and queen were delicious. 

Also, sweet potato fries always a great choice. The avocado blt wrap is also delicious."}
{"text":"This place is a lot of fun and we really enjoyed our night here. I'll start with all the positives first. They have a bunch of games (bowling, skeeball, basketball, giant jenga, cornhole, shuffle board, ping pong). The space is huge, so even when it was super crowded, you could still move around. You have the option to sit at a table and have a server for lunch/dinner or just grab a drink at the bar and wander around. You also have your own server when bowling. The patio area is really nice and it's right across from OMB, Broken Spoke, and Sugar Creek. 

Now the cons; for bowling and shuffle board, you have to be on the wait list. We got a bowling lane with no problem, but the shuffle board wait was 2 hours  Bowling was also extremely expensive. For 4 people, it was $60 including shoes, and you have a time limit on the lane. Not the greatest when you're trying to eat, drink, socialize and bowl simultaneously. Skeeball was also $1 per game which is pricey compared to other bars that have games. The food was mediocre, bar food. We had the trio dips with nachos and chicken fingers and we weren't too impressed. They were good to snack on though. The service is a little slow, but there are a bunch of servers walking around and everyone was extremely friendly so that was really cool. 

Overall, this place was pretty nice. I would recommend it for the free games (cornhole, giant jenga) and to relax on the patio for some drinks. Not recommended for food or for playing the costly games."}
{"text":"We went there on Saturday night. We sat at an outer booth (near the wall) and could barely hear one another. They desperately need a noise buffer. (It's an old warehouse after all) My fiance got sick from the Chicken Tacos and Brussel Sprouts. I reached out the next day to  info@queenparksocial.com on Sunday night. As of Wednesday night, I did not receive any type of response from them. QPS food ruined our night."}
{"text":"First of all the bartender did not write our order down. With that being said .. our order was completely WRONG! This place is toooo loud for the bartender to think its okay to take the order down with out taking it down or repeating it. We ordered 14 lemon pepper and received 8 buffalo and 8lemon pepper. We also ordered Fries but they did not come out. Then we are served the food that belongs to the people beside us!! 

This company has a couple of bartender complaints. When I saw the reviews i decided to ignore the comments but there are all true!!!!!! 

This place encourages people to socialize yet the music is as loud as a night club. Why advertise socialize and not provide the setting?

This place has potential but apparently the owners don't take the review serious because everything everyone complained about I experienced. 

I gave three stars because the food was good"}
{"text":"So rude.  We went to QPS for a friend's birthday.  The guy working the front desk was horribly rude to from the start.  This place has so much potential.  I just wish management would get rid of those with poor customer service.  We won't be back. Charlotte has so many other places to enjoy.   So sad but the atmosphere outside of the rude service is good."}
{"text":"We came here with a party of 6 at 8:00 on a Saturday night, ordered appetizers (wings and nachos) as soon as we arrived, and ended up having to leave almost an hour and a half later because we hadn't received our food. One of the servers was extremely unprofessional and made a comment about our table to the table next to us when their food was delivered. They had arrived a good bit after us and had placed a very similar food order, although much later. When their food was delivered, the server asked them if they knew our table, and when they said no, told them that they could tell us to \"F#ck off.\"  We had spoken with this table during our hour-plus wait for appetizers, and they told us about the server's comment after he left. I've never experienced anything like it. I will say that the manager seemed like a nice guy and offered to comp our drinks after we told him we were leaving."}
{"text":"Great concept, extremely disappointed.  Came here this evening with out of town guest and found a table for four in the bar area.  Sat and sat and sat ignored over and over and over again by many staff members who walked past and NEVER offered to bring a menu or take a drink order.  HELLO?  We have money to spend here?!?!  Finally one of us went over to the bartender and asked if we needed to order our drinks at the bar or would we be served by a server?  No - a server will come take our order,   Well, after another 15 minutes we gave up and went back to the bar and ordered and paid for our first round of drinks, sat down and eventually a server did show up.  We ordered some wings and chips and queso.  Some dude brought the food, dropped it on the table and left.  No napkins, no silverware.  Service was terribly lacking.  We had to flag down our waitress for a napkin.  And then we went BACK up to the bar ourselves for the 2nd round of drinks.  They were not that busy -it was Wednesday night.  But either the staff needs some serious training or they to get more staff on the floor?  No mangement in sight.  Very expensive drink prices and the food was not great.  Chips were awful.  Plenty of better places to go for food and drinks for sure - great entertainment concept but just not worth the prices and lack of service - especially not in this town."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Terrible service! Matthew F, the server gave us the worst experience I've ever had! A server came over to take our drink order, a bigger guy, then Matthew finally came over and looked completely out of it and said hey. We then had to go back to the bigger guy to make sure our food order was even put in, which it wasn't. Not to mention, he messed up each person at the tables drink order. Food was great just hate we were ever sat in his section."}
{"text":"A friend & I walked from OMB over and the hostess was very nice. However, we sat at the bar for 15 minutes and weren't even acknowledged. Then decided to get a table and had minimal acknowledgment. I will never go back again or recommend it to others."}
{"text":"Since most of the knocks I read on this place were about its service, I felt the need to post about the positive experience we had.  

We got there near opening on a Sunday.  We had a group of 8 and we sat in the gaming area.  Our server Nick was fantastic.  He managed our group of 4 separate tabs perfectly and he was very attentive about checking on our needs for drinks/food.  He helped us with the games as well.  5 Stars on Service.

The space is great and while we left our kids at home, there were plenty of kids in the game area and I would feel totally comfortable bringing my kids during the day and letting them run around and play the games.  I could see it being less kid friendly in the evening when the crowds get bigger.  

I'm only going to 4 stars on the food.  The food was all good, don't get me wrong, but it wasn't really next level.  The charcuterie plate was under par.  Everything else was definitely good, not great.  But hey, that's ok.  It worked for what the place was.  

I'm looking forward to going back soon."}
{"text":"There were 7 of us that came in around 8 on Saturday. They didn't appear to be super busy when we were sat. We were brought drinks and asked if we were ready to order then asked if we could have a minute. We flagged our waitress down when we were ready and she told us to wait a minute (almost in a rude tone). We finally ordered and after almost an hour still hadn't received our food. Someone from our party made a joke about getting our food like another table nearby and our waitress again made a snarky comment about how our food should be out shortly. We asked if there was a manager around and then we were brought a free appetizer once they realized we were upset. When the food finally came it was lukewarm and not that great. It looks like a fun place to go drink and hangout, but I doubt I'll be back to eat there any time soon."}
{"text":"Here for the mayweather mcgregor fight. $20 to get in, no problem. $300 to sit at a table. THREE HUNDRED TO SIT AT A TABLE, just sit there. Even after racking up over $500 in a bartab so far, our group was told sorry the $300 table pricing is separate and was set by the owners. This a glorified bowling alley in North Carolina , not a club in New York City. What a joke.

Update: I will say management was very good about contacting me literally within minutes of posting this review. Plus one star for prompt response, definitely will give QPS a try on a regular night and update"}
{"text":"If you ever want to just feel like a big kid, you will LOVE this place! 

My sister and I needed something to eat after completing an escape room next door. We did not want to drive far so we opted to check out this spot. We stopped in around 8:30 on a Monday night.there was ample parking. Likely because there were not a ton of patrons.

For some reason my sister prefers bar seating, so to the bar we went! First thing to note- the smell of this place is interesting. I don't really know how to accurately describe it, but it's not pleasurable. We agreed to still check out the menu. Nicole was our host/ bar tender. What a beautiful spirit. She was very friendly and I gathered that she enjoyed her job. She helped us pick a few items from the menu. We opted  for the turkey meatballs and truffle Fries. The other staff members were friendly and helpful. One guy picked up a game for us and provided us with a lesson on how to play. 

The food arrived in decent time.  The turkey meatballs were served over a few green pieces and in a cute dish. The taste of the meatballs was decent. The fries were just mediocre. I did not taste the truffle at all. They were more Parmesan fries than truffle. After enjoying our meal we had to check out the rest of the space.

The actual re area is the score for me. They offer a number of games from giant connect four to jenga to basketball and darts.some of the arcade like games do require money. I played the boxing  game for $1.00. The other patrons were friendly and engaging. This is a place where it makes you feel like family. I personally would love to have my birthday party or a group of friends meet up at this spot! It would be endless fun! 

Summary- food is decent, games, atmosphere and service are the winning tickets!!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty impressive inside. The decor is pretty cool and the layout of the bar is great. It is extremely loud in here. I was sitting at a table and could hardly here the person next to me. Between the music and the people the acoustics in this place are horrible. 

I also felt that this spot was more for a younger 20's crowd than my friends and I who are in our mid 30s. We definitely felt old.

The food was lackluster. I ordered the avocado blt but had to add chicken to it for an extra $4. The wrap was unimpressive. I have had way better. The sweet potato fries were awesome and probably the best I have had in a while. With that said however, the food came out on this HUGE plate but there was hardly any food. I would recommend smaller plates if you are going that route.

After we ate we all left to go to OMB so we could actually here each other."}
{"text":"Visited here the first time last Sunday afternoon and really enjoyed myself. The bowling area is very nice and comfortable. The wait staff will follow you around if need be. I spent most of my time in the bowling area and the game area. I enjoyed a basketball game, foosball , and giant Jenga. I also enjoyed a beer from a long list of beers on tap (including the local ones). From the menu I ordered loaded cheese fries which were REALLY good: queso , meat of your choice, red onions, jalapeños, cilantros, all on top of a bed of fries cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"Ugh...I wanted to like this place.  I really did.  We went on an empty Tuesday evening, ordered drinks, apps and food and sat on the nice outdoor patio.  Server took a very long time to visit us, take orders.  Waited about 10-15 minutes for drinks to come.  I got the Moscow Mule equivalent and it was not very good at all.  Then the LONG WAIT.  Chips and Guacamole took forever and a half to come.  Chips were pretty bad and guacamole didn't appear fresh.  Tacos came out shortly after.  All in - the service was extremely poor and slow.  Again, this was a Tuesday Evening when the establishment was not crowded at all!!  Management is either not present or does not care about customers - which is shocking for a new spot.   Food quality was 3/10 and overall experience was negative.  If you're looking for a good time there are plenty of other options on Yancey Road."}
{"text":"It is extremely crowded so I guess some people enjoy coming here.  Overall, my visit with friends was very disappointing.  Horrible service at the bar.  Long wait to play any of the games.  Long wait for food to be served.  It's a fairly young crowd.  It's located in an old warehouse so there is nothing to deflect the sound which causes it to be almost unbearably loud.  

It seems to be a popular place to go.  It's within walking distance of OMB.  There is hardly any parking available and the parking that is available is on the street or in a small gravel parking lot. 

Terrible customer service and long wait time for food, drinks, and games is why I will not be returning."}
{"text":"This place is amazing and the variety of beer is great. Our server peter put the game for us and delighted us with different options of beer we like! A must come back location"}
{"text":"Excellent service!!!!Our server Ross was very nice, attentive, and helpful. Food was great, we will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"If there was less than 1 star I would have selected it.  Over the past 2 months we have had a group of people go to Queen Park Social for the advertised trivia that they supposedly do on Wednesday nights.  Out of the 5 times we have gone, they have actually only had it 2 of the times.  What really put us over the edge this week is the fact that we called yesterday at 3:30 and spoke to someone named Allison who confirmed they were doing trivia last night only to find out when our large group got there that they weren't having trivia.  It's incredibly frustrating to organize a group to get together at your restaurant around an event only to get there an not be able to participate.  Needless to say, we took our group to the breweries around QPS rather than give you any of our business last night."}
{"text":"We went here to meet up with some friends and had a great time.  It's a really cool place that offers a lot for the crowd to enjoy.  

It starts out with tables that you can grab something to eat, a full bar with plenty of tvs to watch your favorite game.   Then the game area (which is the majority if the place). They have a multi lane bowling alley, full size shuffleboard area (2 lanes), pop a shot basketball, ping pong, life size connect four, jenga, skeeball, ping pong and air hockey.  

In the game area, there is also a small bar so you don't have to fight the crowd to get to the main bar.  My only issue is that I paid s different price for the same drink depending on the bar I went too.  Don't think that is right, so that is my only ding on the operation.  

Had a great time, but felt a little cheated."}
{"text":"Good spot with lots of space. Hope they'll have some more cocktail choices, but for only being around a month...place has a good vibe with a gastro tex mex vibe."}
{"text":"I finally made it to QPS for a friends birthday and I was pleasantly surprised. It's a fairly large facility and there is something for everyone. We ordered a few appetizers and thought it was good. The staff could be a little friendlier but if you want something different to do with some friends, this place is great. I also like the fact that is within walking distance to other places if you wanted start or end somewhere slightly different. This new area called \"LoSo\" definitely is changing and its great."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! What a fantastic addition to the staple that is OMB (right across the street!).  I have been on two occasions and both times the food was far above what I expected.  Having lived in Dallas, TX for about 2.5 years at one point in my life, I can say with confidence that their queso dip is the best I've had in Charlotte.  Everything else I've tried is fantastic as well (grilled wings, Brussels sprouts appetizer, BLT wrap).  The space is beautiful, an amazing combination of classy and relaxing.  

The only reason they do not get 5/5 is because the wine pours are a little on the short side (not sure if it was just the bartender that night or if that's just the way it is) and for the amount of wall space the place has, relatively few TVs.  I can say with 100% certainty that if the space had 10-15 more TVs in the dining/bar area it would become my GO TO spot for watching NFL Sunday Ticket on NFL Sundays."}
{"text":"Let's just say this place is like a Chuck E. Cheese's but for adults.  Instead of the singing dancing robots and a ball pit.  Queen City Social has a full wrap around bar, dozens of TV's/ huge projector, a bowling alley, skeet ball, shuffle board, ping- pong, free throw basketball and places to lounge around all in between.  It has its own niche for the bar scene and a great place for a date or after work drink to decompress.  It's fun and a good time.

What more could you want?  Service.  It could use way, way better service.   The bartenders are rude and one in particular seems to always be in a bad mood.  A bad attitude is like a flat tire, you can't go anywhere until you change it.  The wait staff forgets orders frequently but from my experience whenever mistakes do happen, it's discounted or on the house.  I appreciate that and it shows good faith.  But overall, needs improvement.

That brings me to the food, I don't go to a place like this to eat.  I'm there to bowl or play skeet ball.  The food is alright or average, nothing special.  I think it's fine where it is, the main focus should be on the service and amenities.  A business like this is shape entirely around service and having fun.  You can't do either without the other. 

Bartenders are rude.  Atmosphere is awesome.  Food is alright. 

***Update***

NC State Fans beware. Even though they have a NC State football helmet at the bar, it's a decoy. Do not expect to watch the game! This is the bone I have to pick. When a place like this has 28 maybe 30 TVs(I counted), you should at least have a cooler football game repeated on two TVs. Wrong. I had to beg to get one of the bar TVs to feature the 9 Norte Dame vs 14 NC State game. When they had the 3 Georgia vs Florida game on everywhere.  Come on, that game is a joke. But the excuse I got was even worse.  When I ask if they could please feature the game on one of the televisions in the game area they said, \"well the owner is a Georgia fan\". Excuse me? Guess the customer doesn't come first, seriously the service here is pathetic.  Also, I mentioned we want to spend money and watch the game, guess they don't care about that either. It won't be around in another year."}
{"text":"18,000 ft. of amazing entertainment space.
These old warehouses in south end make for the best new trendy hangout spots and venues. 
They did a beautiful job remodeling the space. The furniture and Decour is awesome. And the murals on the wall are beautiful. They didn't miss a detail! 
We called ahead and made a reservation for a party of 12. Ashley was awesome she was so helpful and fun to chat with.

We arrived everything was set and Our group had a great time. 
I had a chicken sandwich and it was delicious. The bun and chicken were so fresh! 
There were a lot of burgers at our table and everyone enjoyed those as well.  Someone even raved about the nachos and their quesadilla.

They have really good mules and lots of beers on tap.
After we ate we headed over to bowl. The prettiest eight lanes you ever did see.  And the sofas are amazing!!! There are servers in the alley too, so you can eat and drink in there if you'd like. And on tuesdays it's only $5! 
We had so much fun. 
They have indoor and outdoor space,  A huge Jenga game, checkers, cornhole, and more. 
The staff was super friendly and nice.

 Oh and they have really good ice cream"}
{"text":"Great place to get together with friends for drinks and a great time. They have a wide variety of drunk options so there was something for everyone to enjoy."}
{"text":"We came in tonight, a Wednesday night, place was empty yet we had terrible service. Tried to play air hockey, the machine stole our money and when we asked what happened the girl at the games counter told my husband it was broken . He informed her the machine was blinking green and she accused him of lying while rolling her eyes. Furthermore she said she wouldn't refund our money. On the way out we told  the hostess why we were leaving, luckily she was nice enough to return our money. But overall we weren't okay with being treated so disrespectfully. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Best spot in Charlotte. Boutique entertainment house with great service, great food and great drinks."}
{"text":"Everyone was very friendly! Very fun spot! Tons of games, huge bar and great live music!"}
{"text":"I hate to give a bad review, but we will never step foot back in this place again. The service was the worst I have seen. We walked in on a Sunday with 14 people. I can understand that may be overwhelming but the place was empty. Tables had dirty plates on them. Knew that was probably not a good sign. Took 30 minutes to get water. They kept telling us our server was coming soon. Another 20 minutes and he walked around our table to i.d. Everyone. we are all 40's and above but he was doing his job, I guess. He then came back around to finally get our drink order. At this point several of our table had already gone to get a drink at the bar. Drinks took 30 minutes at least. THEN he finally took our food order. Another 45 minutes for food. He would bring 2 plates at a time in 10 minute intervals. Where was back up for this guy? I talked to a manager who looked all of 21. He says he's so sorry and get this, he tells me when we asked where our server was, the manager says they had to go find him in the bathroom. What?!  Manager offered an apology but never stepped in to help the guy, comp food, nothing! Our bill comes after tracking our server down. Another 30 minutes. Dirty plates on our table, no water refills. AND the server puts an automatic 20%. I know that is customary for a large table ( usually 18% though), so I lost it. At this point, the whole table is just over it. I talked to another manager and he offers to refund our automatic tip. And that our server would need all of our credit cards back to do so. What?! The server asked me what went wrong. Management needs to step up and train and do a better job of customer service. We will not be back."}
{"text":"The games here are really fun and there's a good variety of food/drink/entertainment, but the costs of each of those can add up quickly. Things like jenga, uno, and dart, are all complementary, but if you wanted to play something more serious like Shuffleboard, Bowling, or even Skee Ball, plan to pay for it. They also have a good number of TVs around, so if you're just looking for a fun place to hang to watch the game, it's a pretty good spot for that.

The draft beer selection here is pretty good with a lot of local CLT and NC brews. Most drafts will run from $5-7 and bottles $4+. The only thing is that your tab does not translate from bar to bar, so if you open a tab at the main bar, you need to keep going back there, or close out that tab before you order a drink anywhere else in the place. Not the most convenient."}
{"text":"This place hit the spot...

After a couple of beers at OMB, the need for real food hit!!

The service at the bar was great!  Cocktail came quickly and the only delay on the quesadilla was me deciding on what to have with it!!!

I recommend this place anytime you are in the area and need a drink and bar food with a smile!!!:)"}
{"text":"The place is has a cool atmosphere. Many games to play. Smokers smoke by the back entrance on the back patio and you can smell the smoke inside while you play the games. Very crowded and you need to wait to play the games so I expected more lounging areas. Bartenders are very rude! We got seats by the bar and once seated we asked for a menu, the bartender threw the menu at us and had an attitude that he had to wait until we got our orders in. The ladies in the back bar are also rude. I came up to order a drink and one of the girls ignored me. A guy came to order a drink and she served him. The other girl didn't even attempt to try and help me. Overall the place is ok but service is horrible!"}
{"text":"Went here during NFL playoffs and out of 20+ TVs only 1 (ONE!) had the game on. How does that even pass as a social club if the main social event of the night isn't even playing?! Not to mention the bartenders are ill-fit for a place billing itself as \"social\". One of them didn't utter a single word when ordering a drink -- he just pointed and grunted. Not friendly service in my books.

All in all lots of fun things to do here, but not much room to do them (surprisingly). It gets crowded and the games are taken by sundown (5pm in winter). Didn't try the food, but the menu looked tasty."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Had a bartender continue to clean up despite the fact that I was asking to spend money a hour before closing."}
{"text":"This place could be the worst in Charlotte.  Overcrowded and the bartenders can't figure out how to serve a drink."}
{"text":"We arrived hungry at about 6:45 on a Saturday, and for our party of 10, we ended up waiting over 2 hours and finally were able to sit when we offered the suggestion of splitting our party in 2. 

The decor is very nice, industrial with a touch of glam. I love the large bar when you walk in, the aqua retro chairs and the different rooms (bowling, shuffleboard, dining, etc). Great place to hang out on a Saturday night with friends. 

I had the Dancing Bear drink which was pretty good, so were the onion rings!

Our party was seated at two tables (due to lack of tables for large parties - there is only 1) and my table experienced very poor service compared to the other table for our group. Their orders were taken immediately and they were served their food within about 20 minutes. Our experience was quite different. It took about an hour for us to receive cold food. I ordered the Queen City burger, it arrived lukewarm, medium well (I asked for well), with bacon that was hard and chewy and on stale bread. I ordered wings, they were not that great, but it could be because I don't like breaded wings. Flavor was good though. 

The manager came to check on us and he got our food expedited somewhat, I appreciate that. But I was pretty disappointed that when he returned later to see how everything worked out and I explained to him the issues with my burger, he nodded his head, told me to give them some time and come back, then walked away. An apology goes a long way, but I didn't get one. He didn't seem to care that his guests had a negative experience at his establishment. 

What made this so frustrating is that we had patiently waited SO long for a table, didn't even complain... we ordered drinks at the bar, fries, onion rings, just hung out. The two tables that we were eventually seated at had been empty for close to an hour. No one bothered to ask us if we would be willing to split up so we could be seated. WE had to make the suggestion. So at this point I'm starving and aggravated. Now I have to wait an hour to get wings and a burger and they aren't even hot? Not good. I wanted to try the homemade ice cream, but it wasn't even worth the hassle. Maybe there was a rush to open Queen Park for the Final Four as one of my friends speculated and maybe they called in everyone who was available to help, all hands on deck. But I hope that there is some much needed training of the permanent staff. Otherwise there will be more reviews like this...

I definitely think this place has potential to be a great spot to hang out and get some good food, but there are a lot of kinks to be worked out in the kitchen and with the service for sure."}
{"text":"Bartenders are super nice as well as knowledgeable about the beers they serve. Refreshing to have both. And arcade games to boot. Great place to spend a few hours."}
{"text":"This is a cool place to hang out and play games/bowl. The mule was made perfectly. Only downside was kids + drunk people??"}
{"text":"Peter was an incredibly friendly and attentive server. He constantly asked us if we needed anything and personalized our service. He offered many suggestions and options on what we asked for, which was greatly appreciated. Thank you Peter, for an awesome experience!"}
{"text":"Met some folks after OMB Yoga at OMB and saw this place across the street.  We later ended up going here to check it out and grab some food.  Maybe it was the couple of beers I had had previous to entering into QPS, but the hostess kinda/sorta greeted us and then there was some confusion on where to sit.... It seemed like it was \"sit anywhere you like\" but we walked to the bar area and the hostess kind of followed us...  Regardless, maybe they are still working out the kinks in there service system.

First impression was pretty cool.... nice wood tables and industrial looking finishes.  Our server Candice was super nice.  She made sure we had more chips for our queso and that we were good with beverages.

I ordered a much needed QPS Burger and fries.  Food was decent and there seemed to be something for everyone on the menu (nothing too extensive, but a one-up from regular bowling alley foodages).  Full bar available... local beers (one cider.... but not local) on tap.  They did have some local cider in bottle/can form.

From what I could see... arcade games, bar games (giant jenga), 8 bowling lanes (looks like they were having a private event cause the lanes had a spread of food on them.

Everyone looked to be having a good time (even for a Tuesday night).  I bet on the weekends, this place can get crazy, but for now I will stick with my more manageable weekday crowds."}
{"text":"Meh. 

A friend and I decided to check this place out since I had never been there. 

We walked in sat at the bar. There was an odor in the place that smelled like urine. It was very off putting. Also the sound was entirely too loud. I couldn't even hear the bartender. 

Both my friend and I were so turned off that we didn't even finish our drinks before we left. 

The best things about this place are the old Queen Park sign and the bar stools. But that smell.  Ugh.  

I seriously doubt I will be back."}
{"text":"Queen Park Social is a huge addition to the area and solidifies it as a true entertainment district in its own right. It compliments OMB, broken spoke and the others. 

The food is solid but the real star is the venue itself. The bowling adds a great new option in addition to the giant bar and other gaming areas. 

My only issue is the speed of service but I know that will improve over time. 

Certainly worth checking the place out and it's very easy to hang out here for ours.

One more thing, the pricing on the drinks is great! White Russians for $8 is great."}
{"text":"Visited QPS yesterday for the first time around 5pm.  Fairly quiet.  Not many people seated at the bar but there were several bar staff (I thought) that were working.  Jessie was very prompt and welcoming us to the bar and got our drinks quickly.  It did seem she was the only one working the whole bar.  Most of the other staff just chatted with each other.  If this is the norm I can see why others have made note of the slow service.  Staff/Guest engagement is on the Service Managers though.  

Once we got our drinks, we walked around the place and felt it looked super nice and would be fun for a lot of people.  There were definitely several children running around like it was a playground and I guess it is!  Lot's of space around the game tables - skee ball, hoop game, table shuffleboard, regular shuffleboard, ping-pong, dart board and of course bowling!  A small, but nice outside area with the iconic Queen Park sign center stage!  Very nice!

We went back to the bar and ordered the Chicken Wrap and the Queen City Burger (without peppers)  I didn't taste the chicken wrap, but it was noted as good, but I was told the burger had more flavor than the chicken.  I really liked the burger and would get it again.  The slice of Queso Fresco was good with it.  Cooked a perfect medium-rare.  The fries had skins on, but not too thickly and the crisp was great on the fry. (to me skin-on fries can be floppy if not dried and fried well enough)

After we finished we hung out on the patio a bit and enjoyed the beautiful afternoon.  Definitely a nice patio with plenty of space for lounging.  We could hear the music from OMB and that was nice too.  I like that they put the railings up in a way that somewhat blocked the parking and street when you're sitting down.  It made it cozy since it was so quiet.  It will be interested to see how it handles a bigger crowd during sports events/weekends.

I would definitely go again and look forward to visiting often!  Great concept and great location."}
{"text":"Great experience today! Service and food were excellent! My family had the quesadilla, grilled chicken sandwich and burger and all were delicious!! Look forward to going back soon!"}
{"text":"I would say that QPS has a lot of potential but it isn't there yet. Overall we had an expensive and lackluster experience which is a shame because you can tell a lot of work went into creating the space.

We came on a Saturday for games and started with cocktails at the bar. QPS does make a good cocktail! There were a few games to choose from but there wasn't a change machine so we were left sitting on the couch after only a couple minutes of pinball and one round of the free giant connect four. Instead of pestering the busy bartender for quarters we decided to move on to dinner.

Our server at dinner seemed super friendly but also spacy. I felt like he started walking away from me before I finished asking questions or for things each time he stopped at the table. My burger that was ordered well done came out far too pink for my taste. It was also greasy and was unevenly seasoned with random slices of jalapeño that made some bites ridiculously spicy and other bites not at all. The boyfriend had the chicken fingers which were bland. 

The space is huge and has a cute retro chic vibe and the cocktails were good. The games were only slightly more plentiful and varied than a normal bar and less so than many of the game themed bars in Charlotte. While the pricing isn't outrageous there was definitely some buyer's remorse when the check came and we realized we could have gone to any one of the nearby breweries for half the price and twice the quality."}
{"text":"I went here for a work event. So I was able to try lots of apps and there was an open bar. The apps I sampled were, the hummus (not good), chicken tenders, chicken wings, guac, queso, salsa, spinach dip and chips. Everything tasted well except for the hummus and spinach dip. I am not a fan of cold spinach dip and this one was cold. Other than that, it was nice. They made sure the food was replenished and bartenders were on top of the drinks. There was more than 100 of us and I didn't feel like I waited long for anything. I mean you can eat, drink and play all in one location.  Some of the games are free, jenga, large connect 4 and shuffle board but some of the other  you have to pay. It is worth bringing  a group of friends and having a good time.  Of course when it comes to drinks, I had a margarita or two or three! I would recommend those. I would definitely be back on my leisure time as well."}
{"text":"We went yesterday(4/22) and I'll NEVER go back. The service was horrible. After being sat we waited over 7 minutes for a server to greet us and we got nothing. Servers looked at us as they walked by but not a single one said anything not even \"hi I'll be with you in a moment\", nothing. I'm very big on service. I understand places get busy but you can greet your table. And if you can't I don't want to visit your establishment. So needless to say we won't be back."}
{"text":"A trio of us walked over after finishing up with beers at a nearby brewery. My girlfriend and a friend went in to grab a table as I went to grab something from my truck. My friend immediately text me to tell me that it smelled awful inside, specifically \"like feet & @$$..\" But, they still decided to continue the visit. 

When I entered, yes I agree with her assessment. They were very, very busy and it took quite some time for someone to stop by and assist our table. We finally got some help and she was friendly and helpful! There was a DJ with a few people taking to the dance floor. The DJ, along with the huge crowd made it very loud inside.

Cold beer and tasty apps are a good reason to return. The restrooms were large and clean. There is plenty of parking around the lot and neighborhood."}
{"text":"Came in during a holiday weekend, so not that crowded and tried their bowling special! The lane consistency isn't the best if you're serious into bowling, but I wouldn't recommend coming here if you truly wanted to practice your bowling game. Definitely a more social spot, which they seem to do fairly well. The wings were good but nothing to write home about. I'd come again but would stay away on crowded nights unless you're into that scene."}
{"text":"Highly recommended for a Sunday Funday! A large-ish group of us (12-14) recently had a lazy afternoon playing games, drinking drank, and eating food. I really find QPS to be a unique spot in town!

While we didn't bowl, we took advantage of cornhole, shuffleboard, foosball, connect four, skeeball, and more. Nearly all of the games just require your debit card as collateral, which is nice. They had $2 mimosa specials, and a good mixed drink menu/beer selection. It has a little something for everyone, which made it ideal for a bigger group.

I've heard it gets busy on weekend nights, but it's a super chill place to hang out otherwise. Definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"Great venue and tons of potential, but the service and kitchen speed is atrocious. New management is needed quickly"}
{"text":"Really cool place and a lot of fun games. Definitely enjoyed my time there but I would say that that was mainly a result of just being with my friends and more in spite of our service. We put our name in to bowl and were told it would be 30 min. It took 2 hours. 

Our server took a very long time to get back to us and to take orders. She would take one order and leave for 10 minutes. Was told I wouldn't be charged extra for something but when the bill came sure enough there was a surcharge. I'm fine with paying extra for add-ons, just don't tell me it won't be extra and then charge me for it."}
{"text":"WHAT. A. BLAST! This bar was such a treat. I wish we had something like this in Savannah! We sat at the main bar with a small but growing group and the bar was able to accommodate us with no problem. We ordered the chicken fingers and cheese fries and I would highly recommend both. Drink were great too--my margarita was delish and my boyfriend got two Bloody Mary's. Their liquor selection is pretty premium and we still thought our bill was fine. Next time we definitely want to try out some of the games!!"}
{"text":"Great food.  Horrible service ruined the experience.  Took 30 minutes for someone to come take our drink order.  This is 15 mins after hunting down the hostess to let her know.  We watched as multiple waitresses told her they were too busy to help us.  The restaurant was horribly understaffed.  Food took a long time but was very good.  They forgot one of our orders....which we then had to wait again to receive.  To top off the night, it started raining and the windows leaked -  spraying water on the entire table.  We had to get up with our food and move tables.  There were limited options because all the tables with windows were leaking. 
I completely blame the management.  We decided at the end of the night that we would never go back."}
{"text":"What a disaster. Absolutely horrible service. Watched 3 tables leave because they never food.  Drinks are slightly tolerable... Service overall is garbage. Management has zero clue how to manage a restaurant.  Food order was wrong and took 1.5 hours to get there. Management is clueless and go rolled by three unhappy tables."}
{"text":"This is a great concept and a welcome addition to the neighborhood. The design of the bar area is great and the game area is much bigger than I expected. My only very minor complaint is about the speed of service at the bar during a so-so time in terms of crowd. I'm chalking it up to growing pains and I'm definitely coming back here again soon."}
{"text":"The most chic adult game venue I have ever seen! There are TONS of options of games to play from Jenga, cornhole, bowling, darts... and more and this is the attraction of this place. They do also serve food so you really don't even have to leave. If you would like a laid back night of drinks and games, this is your place. Also, I will mention again, that this is an ADULT venue (at least on a Saturday night) so I don't recommend bringing the family. Very cool concept for a couples date or friends date."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out!!! Love this place highly recommend it....great games and hang out for everyone from parties and all..thanks for everything Peter M you were the BOMB"}
{"text":"I always come to Queen Park Social on weekend nights and have an excellent experience. However, I visited today to watch a football game and I received the worst service I have ever had anywhere. Our waiter was not the least bit attentive to us and when we received our food none of it was correct. At the time I visited they were not even the slightest bit busy. All in all, I would say this price is not worth the quality of food and service."}
{"text":"This is a fun place for a chill night out. Lots of games and activities to keep you busy. We went on a Friday night and there was always a game available to play and plenty of seating. Beers were slightly over priced. Why pay $5 for a bud light when you could go right across the street to OMB and get a craft beer for the same price. Our bartender was also painfully slow. The bar wasn't crowded at all and it still took her awhile to get us drinks and cash us out. Overall a fun place though!"}
{"text":"so i got a quesadilla and there was a bone in it and i chipoed my tooth. the manager allison and the bartender natalie werw amazingly helpful and those two women are the only reason you are getting 3 stars.  now becasue natalie and allison were so amazing i would have given 5 stars even with a chipoed tooth but the front desk girl with red braids was not just obnoxious but incredibly inconsiderate. as i was watching the extra point being kicked she starts messing with the channels, as i asked her politely why, she yelled at me.  then she started sweeping up dirt and dust right around me as i was eating. natalie and allison need raises Porsche needs to be fired.  or atleast towed and impounded"}
{"text":"This establishment has some great potential with their bowling alleys, great atmosphere, nice waitresses and games but the bar service, food and drinks were horrible. I have given this establishments multiple tries and they continue to let me down. The bartenders did not know how to make simple drinks such as a Baby Guinness. They double charged me for a drink and were rude when I brought this to their attention before they corrected it. The burger I ordered had amazing potential as well but came out dry as could be. I plan on giving this place a few more months before I give it another try."}
{"text":"Food is awesome- it saved our not walking out completely.
The servers are set up to fail. The staff is so over-whelmed they are no support and combative to down right aggressive - we walked In the door and the host \"what do you want?\" was our greeting, it's truly an awful setup:strategy that has so much potential. 
I wanted to love this place...and we started to walk out twice, but the food eventually came and was so good- we waited it out. 
Still- not enough to save it. 
I won't be back- too many other fun places around with better service and just as good food. Too bad."}
{"text":"Update:

So guys I finally tried out the food and the bowling....

I signed up for emails from QPS and received an email on Saturday about brunch. They were advertising a $15 bottomless rose mimosa special from 11am-2pm so of course I got the gang together for Sunday brunch. Bottomless. Mimosas.

We arrived at QPS around 11:10am. I thought the place was going to be packed, but it was actually pretty empty. We were told we could sit anywhere so we chose the bowling alley area because comfy couches. J We sat down around 11:15am and ordered the mimosas and food. I went for the Chicken and French toast. I don't think anyone, including us, considered that alcohol couldn't be served until noon. Let me tell you, that was a thirsty 45 mins. They should've mentioned that in the email, but I'm guessing this is the first time they've tried a brunch drink special.

The cool thing was that we were able to bowl at the same time. We ended up paying $56 in total for 4 shoe rentals and an hour of play on one lane. Not too bad, but I don't go bowling on a regular basis so don't take my firm word for it. I was surprised that the floor was actually pretty slippery with the bowling shoes. I'm pretty sure my Chuck Taylors would have had more grip than those shoes. I'm not sure if it was the wood floor or the shoes. Overall, bowling was cool. Don't expect an A+ bowling experience. The bowling pins are on strings (which is the strangest thing) so we felt like sometimes more bowling pins should've been knocked down. The lanes are also shorter than normal. I did like that we could play different games, like HORSE and change the screen characters.

Our food finally came out about 10-15 mins later. The chicken and French toast come out kabob style, which I wasn't expecting, but it looked pretty cool. For a \"chicken and waffles\" dish, I would give it a 4/5- not the best, but still good. The chicken wasn't dry and the French toast was pretty good. Oh, back to the mimosas. They were actually kinda gross. I think she said it was mixed with Izze, which I love btw. I was expecting a traditional mimosa with OJ and rose, but that's not what we got. It just didn't taste like a mid-morning drink.

Our server was great! She was super friendly and kept the mimosas pouring! We moved around QPS and played different games for about 2 hours and she would come check on us after once in a while.

Overall, this place still has some work to do, but I'm trying not to be too critical because it's new. It's a new concept. They service here is great and as long as they do their best to keep the customers happy, they'll receive a good rating. I had fun here and enjoyed the food. 

---------------------

QPS is so much fun! I went last night around 10pm for the soft opening and it was worth the wait. I've been so excited for this place to open ever since I heard about it at yoga on tap at OMB. 

I really love the ambiance of this place. It's very spacious and has a industrial/retro feeling. Each area has a different vibe. If you like chill settings, the patio is perfect and if you're looking to mingle, the bar is where you want to be. 

The bar is really cool and has 18 beers on tap as well as a variety of speciality drinks. I went for \"The Walter White\" because Breaking Bad, obvi.  The base was tequila and it was amazing! Highly recommend. What I really like about the bar is that they don't keep your card when you open a tab, so no more lost debit cards. Yus! 

As for games, there's a basketball shooting game, skee ball, jenga, ping pong, corn hole, 2 giant shuffle boards, 2 traditional shuffle board tables, and of course, bowling. 

We didn't try bowling or the food, but definitely next time! This place is perfect for switching it up on weekends. The same bars can get so boring. I'll definitely be back soon. 

The two things I think would really spice up the place is a live DJ on like Friday or Saturday nights in the bar area and milkshakes. Yummm.

Other details:
- ATM on site
- 4 tvs & jumbo screen at the bar 
- Jumbo screen in game room 
- Maybe 1 or 2 tvs in the dining area
- Parking is free and there's plenty of it along the street and on the grassy area across from OMB"}
{"text":"We went there for a happy hour recently and they seem to close off the whole area friendly for reservations. A friend warned me about this so I tried to call the day before, but they told me they don't know about reservations until the day of (how?). They don't open until 4 so it's not like you can find out ahead of time  It wasn't closed when we got there, but they started setting up for an event about an hour later. They set it up around us and didn't kick is out but it was kind of awkward to be sitting at a table in the middle of an event you aren't part of. 

I also wish that you could play some if the games for free. You can play board games, but it seemed like you had to pay for everything else. 

I've had the food which isn't bad, but also isn't great. We got the wings this time which were pretty good. The dip trio wasn't the best.

I still really like this place, but it seems to have some wasted potential."}
{"text":"Definitely not a good first impression.

We came over here for the first time on a rainy Sunday. I expected it to be quite full, but the place was only mildly to moderately full. We sat down and began to order our drinks and they were out of multiple beers. Our server advised us they had had a big day prior, so they were out of a lot of drinks. OK whatever, so we ordered something else.

We then ordered some food. Our food never came. We brought this to our servers attention and she didn't even seem to notice that we hadn't received our food. She told us it was never put in for some reason and she would take it off of our bill. We were very hungry and it was late, so we were annoyed we didn't get the chance to order something else. She then brought us our checks without asking us if we were finished.

The manager then came out to apologize and offered us a round of drinks. This was very kind of him. However, once we receive the drinks we realize they were all different drinks then we had ordered. Again, not a great first impression.

It didn't seem as though the bartenders any servers were communicating well. Getting a beer seemed like it took ages and was a hassle. At one point we just decided to go to the bar and order it they are because our server was nowhere to be found. The bartender asked us to find our server instead of offering to find her himself or offering to pour us a drink.

This place definitely has a lot of kinks to work out. I'm hesitant to return with such poor service when the place was not busy.

With that being said, I do think it is a nice space and will be very popular. I saw the bowling and shuffleboard prices and was very surprised you have to pay for shuffleboard. Maybe I was misunderstanding.

I will give them several months to work things out before considering returning."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. Beef brisket quesadilla and avocado BST were phenomenal. Add an egg to the BST (recommended by our server Peter). Very friendly service."}
{"text":"The main thing that would bring up the rating of QPS is the service. I don't like to knock places for service, but after reading other reviews and experiencing the exact same thing myself, I get it. It's an issue, and it should be addressed. However, there's enough fun stuff to do everywhere that you don't really need too much distraction. 
I came here for The Lady's birthday, along with her friend...and her parents...and our friends... it was a pretty large group. We started the day off with cornhole (god am I terrible at that game. I need some help. Anybody have the patience to help me and make me better?), and then we went onto shuffleboard - not table shuffleboard, the real kind, like the older people play on cruise ships! And yea, it's super fun. Don't judge.
There were a few more games that we flirted with, skiball, darts, foosball, etc., but after that, we all kind of gathered around the bar for dinner and more drinks. The bar is a beautiful U shape, and there's tons of seating around it, and there are tables around that as well. We all got drinks and food - I ordered the chicken quesadilla which was not bad! Not great, but not bad at all. Sundays feature $2 mimosas which is a steal, and they're pretty potent too. Not bad, QPS. 

One thing that really annoyed me was the lack of tab transfer throughout the building. I had to have three separate tabs - one for outside, one for inside, and one for when I was ordering food. A bartender even closed a tab for me, even though I didn't ask for it, although she never informed me and I had to hand over my card, yet again.  Getting the attention of anybody was a disaster. Nobody took care of us at the table, but we had to go to the bar. ... where nobody really acknowledged me for a solid 5 minutes, on multiple occasions. It was just kind of ridiculous. But as I said, there are enough distractions in there that it didn't bother me that much. I'd like to see what QPS is like on a Saturday, to see if you're able to even move. The space is big, but it wasn't particularly crowded on Sunday, which makes me more inclined to go on Sundays more often ;) I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place is great looking . There are plenty of things to do , basketball game , ping pong , bowling and a few other games . The burger was tasty . The loaded fries had great potential but you could tell our order had been sitting there , they were a bit cold and too soggy , but we were really hungry . The service was ok , not the friendliest ( except for the hostess , she was very welcoming ) and when we moved to the bar we waited for a drink but we're ignored so we just left . Others seemed to be enjoying themselves so maybe our night was just off . We will try it again . Go try it out ."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Food is very decent. Drinks are great. Staff is attentive.
Awesome addition to this part of town. Could happily spend a day here for sure!"}
{"text":"Never did get inside as I had my pup, but the yard area was nice. Next time we will pop in"}
{"text":"It's a Wednesday night, the place is practically empty and it still took about 10 minutes for someone to notice we were standing by the door waiting to be seated. Do you seat yourself at Queen Park? I'm a first-timer, actually, most of the women I was with also were, so we patiently waited. 

Finally, we sat, and our waiter greeted us. He was a friendly guy and brought waters to our table promptly. Things seemed to be picking up. After checking out the menu, we placed our drink orders, but one after another the drinks we requested weren't in stock. As a cider drinker, our waiter suggested another cider and I agreed to give the alternative a shot. When he came back, everyone else had their bevs expect for me. He said he didn't hear me. *eye roll* So, he came back minutes later with my drink. 

Before placing our orders a friend mentioned that she is gluten-free and asked if they have a GF menu. They don't but the chef can accommodate, said our waiter.  With that, we placed our orders. The food came out centuries later, or so it felt like that. With my GF friend her salad had croutons on it...nope. She sent it back, and the salad came back a little too quickly for me to think they re-made it rather than just plucking the croutons off the salad. 

Sadly, the food was nothing spectacular. I ordered the nachos and as a vegetarian, I firmly believe that veggies should be added for free or a reasonable additional charge, not $3. The nachos were weak and soggy with the amount of cheese poured over the chips. 

I can't say I will be coming back to Queen Park Social for a dining experience, but I will come to an event or maybe to partake in games. With the level of service we received when the joint was dead, I can't fathom what the service would be like when this place is hopping on the weekends."}
{"text":"Great environment. Wrap around bar, bowling, shuffle board. I had the shrimp tacos, and they were above average."}
{"text":"After hearing that QPS opened up I have been looking forward to checking it out...I mean how can you go wrong with drinks, games and food for adults!  The design and layout was great, but where things went wrong was service, the menu and the food. We stopped in on a Thursday night and sat at the bar to grab drinks, before hitting the games.  Upon grabbing a seat, we had to ask for menus, which took several minutes to receive. After taking a look I was definitely disappointed with the drink selections, very limited. We ordered some drinks and water, which we never received. We decided to grab some food, which then took a while to flag someone down to place our order.  Keep in mind the place was not too crowded with several seats still open at the bar.
We ordered the Chicken Fingers and Fries and the Shrimp Tacos.  Once the food arrived we had to ask for silverware/napkins and again water. Finally we received water. The chicken fingers were good, but so greasy! However, the regular fries, loved! They had a seasoning salt that was the kicker to a perfectly cooked fry! As for the tacos, they were basically lettuce with four pieces of shrimp, not impressed at all.
We didn't bowl, but I would love to come back to hit the lanes. Overall, I had hoped for more, but will definitely give them another shot and update my review if there have been any improvements."}
{"text":"Went here on a recommendation and and had a good time. Bowling, Drinks and Great food. We are new to Charlotte so it was a little surprising to see a boot camp going on when we arrived. Wasn't a turn off but apparently yoga at Brewery's is a thing too.

 Bowling is bowling to me so I couldn't tell if the lanes were great or legal size. But the Burger we had and the truffle fries were great. Queens park burger perfectly cooked and to me a messy burger is a good burger.

I had a try of the veggie burger and it was very tasty and flavorful.

Look forward to coming back to this place.

Great place to just hangout at the bar too."}
{"text":"Went here last night with a coworker. Let me first say that whoever is in that kitchen knows how to throw down! My veggie plate was superb! Usually bars have stipulations as to what they can change or what accommodations they can make, but I asked my bartender if I could just get a plate of stir fry veggies w/ extra mushrooms. They made it happen. They actually brought out two nice sized plates of some bomb a** stir-fried mixed veggies ( I think only other vegans can appreciate this lol) . I boxed one up and devoured the other.  ALSO, the DJ was really good!! We didn't get to play any of the games, but next time we plan to get in on some Uno, basketball, and bowling!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place a higher rating. Everyone from the hostess to Ross our server was so nice, welcoming and fun. Being from out of town I didn't know the history of the location but certainly was excited to see what they have done with it. To answer a couple questions I had when I walked in, yes there are bowling lanes (you can't hear them from the dining room). There is a game room with table tennis and shuffle board and life size jenga. As for the food and drink, we ordered the nachos with salsa and guacamole as an appetizer and it was solid. We both went for the tacos as the main. She ordered shrimp and I got the pork. Both were amazing and full of lots deep flavors. The beer on tap has a lot of local breweries which is always a plus for me. Ross was so friendly and attentive and had some great suggestions for food and drink. If you stop by see if he's working, you won't be disappointed with any aspect of the visit."}
{"text":"My sister and I stopped in on a Monday night after finishing up the escape room event right around the corner. Never been here but I knew it was similar to the one near my house called piedmont social house and I love it there so I figure I would love it here just as much. A great place to go and eat, have a drink or two and just be a big kid playing the games they offer. They have everything to the oversized checkers, Jenga, video games, bowling, pool tables, and some games I never even heard of before, but I had a blast playing. The only thing off here is the smell when you come in i can't really explain it but it's like an old building smell that the floors was mopped with old dirty water. Yet we still gave them a chance because we were won over from the employees and the excitement of looking around and seeing all the games. 

The menu was quite simple and to the point, which I appreciated at this point because we were starved and ready to grub. We both ordered the turkey meatballs with truffle fries. To my surprise the turkey meatballs filled me up and they were good on top of it all. The truffle fries ehh were okay I have had better. My drink of coarse was a grapefruit cocktail which I enjoyed every bit of as well. So if you ever have a moment where you just wanna be a big kid and enjoy drinks and food while doing so this is another place of business I recommend."}
{"text":"The word of the day ladies and gentlemen is \"TASTEFUL\"! 

Queen Park Social is new the area and the Charlotte community should welcome them with open arms! The spacious layout provides a full service bar, bowling lanes (approx 6 could be more) and a \"social\" area where you can enjoy some adult playtime. The hostess and servers were super friendly and while I was waiting on a drinks another waitress stopped by just to confirm that we'd been taken care of (I hope they keep that up). 

I say go for one of their signature drinks (dancing Bear is my new fav). Keep in mind, the signature drinks will be about $10-$12. But if you're not really into mixed drinks then they have good selection of local brews on tap; averaging $5-$8. 

The food was AMAZING... and I'm seriously not just saying that. I literally picked up my side bowl of rice to make sure I got it all. The food was reasonably priced also... I had a wrap and side for my main entree and that was about $12. Not bad for a simple Saturday lunch. But no one warned me that it would be that tasteful, I mean it wasn't just grilled chicken thrown on a wrap... it was SEASONED grilled chicken on a wrap.

Since the weather was so nice, I decided to order a dessert (weather has nothing to do with me wanting a dessert but whatever). Order the Apple Pie Taquitos.... comes with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and cinnamon apple chips... you will thank me later! 

I can't wait to come back for happy hour!"}
