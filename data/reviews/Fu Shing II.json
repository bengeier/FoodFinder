{"text":"It's defiantly a take out place, but they are supper nice people! We ordered the chicken with garlic sauce, sweet and sour pork, szechuan beef, shrimp fried rice, and chicken chow mien. Nothing was really hot and spicy even when the menu said it was. The sweet and sour pork was more sweet then sour, but that's how we like it so we were happy. The szechuan beef was so good! The only surprise was the chow mien, looked nothing like the chow mien you get at Panda Express but is not greasy at all which made it so good.  We ordered at the place and it was all ready in about 20 mins or less. You can also call in I think because while we sat and waited people were picking up their orders.  They also added 2 spring rolls for free :)"}
{"text":"Just moved into the neighborhood next to the shopping center. Thought we would give it a try. Really good food, reasonable prices. And make sure you try the ice tea..... It's great... Interesting...but great"}
{"text":"I've gotten my Chinese food here a few times a month for the past year but today will be the LAST time I give them my money.   Usually a woman works there who's on it. But she may no longer be there. The woman who they replaced her with needs more training. After ordering my food, I was told it would be 10 minutes. I left, and came back 10 minutes later. She proceeded to ask me what I'd like to order. I had just been in 10 minutes ago and it wasn't busy so this was annoying but not a big deal. I told her I had ordered and she told me 5 more minutes. It was freezing in the store so I sat in my car and came back in.   She again went to go take my order (which was wild  cause I'd been in twice in 20 minutes). I said I'm picking up and repeated my order. She says, \"Oh. Your friend just picked it up.\" I didn't come with anyone. I tell her this, which again, blows my mind since I've been in twice with no one else in the restaurant and this is a time span of 20 minutes on a non busy day. She INSISTED I knew the girl. I repeatedly tell her I don't know whoever you gave that food to. She calls a man from the back who then tells me my friend picked it up. I say again, I'm alone. He turns back to the woman and switches languages. He turns back to me with this look on his face and says quietly, you know her. That's your friend. Like I'm trying to run a scam on food that costs $13. I again say I do not know who you gave my food to. I came in here alone. He finally says we'll make you new food. But it's clear they don't believe me. And they hand me the food with no words and that same look on their faces.   I'm done giving them by business. I don't need to be treated like that. If the owner is reading this, please ask the usual woman to come back. She knows what she's doing."}
{"text":"Our go to Chinese place. Quick and good food. I always get the sesame chicken and the pork fried rice. It is really good. there is not much room to eat in the restraunt if that's what your thinking of doing. Definitely better for to-go only"}
{"text":"Definitely a household favorite. We order here at least once a week, the staff is so nice and accommodating. My favorite dish is the steamed dumplings and hubby's is the crab Rangoon. Prices are fair and the sweet tea is absolutely to die for. Highly recommend for a quick mid-week meal, or weekend stay-cation."}
{"text":"I visited Fu Shing II for first time last night.  I had wondered for over a year if it was going to be just good chinese food.  So I decided to try the basics....shrimp fried rice and spring rolls.  Very impressed.  The rice was cooked well...not oily or greasy.  The shrimp was tasty!  The spring rolls were very good.  Fried wraps filled with just enough veggies!  I did not eat in since this is a very small location.  There are two tables.  I think it is more for order and go.  But more than just walking up to a window to order (like the good ole shops in Philly)!  Two other critical things for me is rating....and the fact that they do not use MSG!!!  I will be returning for my periodic need for fried rice...and will try other items."}
{"text":"It's so hard to find good Chinese food in this city.  I think we bypass four other places to get our takeout from here.  The pork dumplings are a bit disappointing but everything else more than makes up for it.  Their lo mein is fantastic and we've never had an issue with tough meat for raw vegetables which are typically some of our biggest complaints.  Definitely the best Chinese takeout we've had, and we've tried quite a few in the area."}
{"text":"My fav Chinese take out. Their food is not greasy like other places and they always get my order right. I drive from UNCC sometimes for take out."}
{"text":"Cheap chinese and nothing else in the area worth a darn, so you get the min 3 stars right off the bat. Would maybe give a 4th for location, but just can't do it. I've had to much confusion on their end taking orders. When I order food at lunch, give me the lunch price, I shouldn't have to specify. Or at least ask of I want lunch or dinner combo, don't just assume I want to pay more."}
{"text":"Basic takeout joint which happens to get it right.   Been using them for 2-3 years.   Never disappointed."}
{"text":"Ordered moo shu gai pan, pork chow mein, fried dumplings, and crab ragoon. The rice was dry, noodles are greasy, they used canned mushrooms, and the egg rolls were bland. Rather eat Panda express."}
{"text":"Yuck! So I pick my order up assuming these wonton had cream cheese inside, nope beef and it is horrible. I called and complained about it she argued with me and said I have to ask for cream cheese I told her I in the hell am I suppose to know it come in beef or pork especially when you didn't ask. I was pretty much pissed to the fullest I'm done I have ordered from them all the time I'm done. Don't spend your money here, the fact that she argued with me about a the difference in wonton when clearly it's not in the menu"}
{"text":"I really like this place and the Mongolian beef especially, why three stars ? It's fine with me ..."}
