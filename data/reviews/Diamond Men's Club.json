{"text":"I had a good time there. Good food, friendly manger and bartender. I would love to spend another night there best place, if you're looking for fun just go there you won't regretted"}
{"text":"I first came to Diamonds in about 2004.  I had a ton of fun and there were really hot girls.

I've gone in twice in the past 3 months and it was completely different.  No hot girls and even the moderately cute ones were weird or never came by after being tipped on stage and asked to come over.

Also, the last time I was there a woman came in with two other guys to confront her man who had come to the club to have some fun.  They started a fight and the bouncers took forever to kick them out.  It was right near us so we moved in case we would get hit by a badly thrown bottle or something.  Management never apologized or anything.

This club seems more like a place where third-tier dancers go to hang out with each other than a moneymaking venture or fun time for anyone.

Go to Christies or Crazy Horse in Bedford Hts instead."}
{"text":"Met a group here late night on a Saturday. This place is looking pretty good compared to last time I came in. Not only was the place packed, there was some gorgeous girls too. 

Our server was just excellent, which has a lot to do with your experience. The drinks were flowing, girls were a plenty and the food is made fresh in house. I had their fresh cut french fries, they were hot out the grease and damn good if I do say so myself. The crispy chicken, bacon sandwich was good too. Real chicken breast, not a frozen mystery meat patty. This meal prompted me to write the review, it was that damn good. 

Most 'Gentleman's Clubs' (ha!) don't cater to their female guests like they should, which is why I had such a standout experience here. They had flavored vodka, this is a first for me. My server treated me like one of the guys, which is what you want. Even though I don't engage in tipping on stage and lap dances, I'm still paying top dollar for these drinks, tip well and keep it moving honey.

Let's be real, if your looking for attractive dancers, good eats and a helpful server, Diamond's is in the top 3 in the city. Instead of using past experience to rate the other two, I think another visit is in order to fairly compare them all. Yes, I'm on a quest to find the best strip club in the city, this should be fun."}
{"text":"I would recommend going to Christies cabaret 2 minutes away instead of this place...but if you insist on going here:  $10 topless dances out on the floor or $20 nude dances elsewhere. Both dances are no contact and they have signs saying \"if you touch, you go\".  Very uptight feel to the club, which made me feel uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Thank you for always giving me a safe space with endless club sodas and just a really thoroughly solid buffalo chicken wrap.

I thought I was reviewing my gym but it turns out this is DMC. Still 5 Stars for life."}
{"text":"It said they were good on a Sunday night and that is a bold face lie...No cover charge was the only good thing! There was one girl out and she was on the small stage not doing much of nothing but putting her its bitty titties in some guy face...walked in and smooth walked out!!!"}
{"text":"Nasty Female Manager OR Thinks she is.
Totally BAD ATTITUDE
Place needs a Manager with a Personality.
I WILL NOT BE BACK. !!"}
{"text":"horrible horrible business! this place is POORLY taken care of! My 17 year old son was snuck in with his friends father using his friends fathers 40 year old ID!!!! While the father was standing right there and they believed it?!! also was told later by my son they paid the girl at the door $50 to let them in.. what money making business would risk something so stupid to get shut down by letting a DRUNK 17 year old KID in there?!!? I am mind blown from it!!! They tried getting into the other strip club hustlers that was right next to it and that place said no way! then this place lets a 17 year old kid in who is obviously showing a grown mans ID! I also was speaking to the manager and the manager did not seem to give a single f***! The manager seemed alittle concerned talking to me which was probably only to tell me what I want to hear but was later told by my son all the manager did was ask my son if he's 18 my son said yes and the manager walked away!! didn't even ask for ID which my son would not have had!!!! My son has pictures from being there so I am truly considering going to the police! I would give this place a negative star if I could!"}
{"text":"The rating is on solely on food quality.  

My brother and I came here after spending a day in Cleveland.  We saw the $25 for $50 promotion,  so we decided to come down and use it. 

Yes, it is an adult club,  and we knew it was a bit ridiculous to eat there as though it was just a regular restaurant, but whatever. We weren't sure what to expect,  but we figured,  \"why not?\" 

The food was surprising good with impressive portions. I ordered the fettuccine alfredo, and the loaded fries.  My brother ordered a hamburger and onion rings,  and we split boneless chicken and pizza. The chef had a great sense of item food prep time for every item came out at the same time (without any item being cold). QUITE THE SKILL; VERY RARE. The bartender/waitress was great as well, as so the manager. 

My brother enjoyed his part. I enjoyed mine. The fettuccine was to Italian restaurant quality. I was quite impressed.  The fries were great as well. Both fresh and flavorful.  Everything was great except for the pizza. Constructive criticism: modify the dough, and add more seasoning in the sauce.

Bottom line: no matter the reason for entering Diamond's- your stomach and taste buds will leave happy."}
{"text":"This is some of the best management staff I have met from the owner to the Managers. They have great bartenders who work to get your drinks. This clean environment with out door patio for cigars. They have great food ( I know a strip club ) they do."}
{"text":"My female friend and I had been talking about going to stripper club for a while. So on Sunday trip to a strip to embrace ones inner degenerate was need. She was talking about sugar daddy's to the entertainer lol.

The Good- No Cover charge before7 on a Sunday, 2.50 beers, and 5 $ lunch menu available. 

Good Burger and fries, Cooked perfect and fries were hot. Did not even finish my beer, but at 2.50 no big deal.
The Bad- only 1 entertainer was present and we did not even see a stage dance. Does this even count as visiting a strip club??????"}
{"text":"Been here several times. Talent is not that great. Went there Saturday with another female and 2 guys and not a single girl came up to us besides the server and we were there for 2 hours. Guess that's why we tipped the server $40!"}
{"text":"If you looking to get ripped off, this is the place to go.  The hustler club across the street, or any other gentleman's club for that matter, would be a better choice."}
