{"text":"We arrived at this restaurant at 4:00 Christmas Eve, with closing time at 5.  Our server was pleasant and attentive, but not pushy.  We did our best to get out of there by 5, bit we're a little later and the server still did not get pushy (although I wouldn't have blamed her if she did).

We had fried pickles (they were fantastic) and burgers and dessert.  All of the food was delicious.  The fries and tots weren't hot like everything else, but they were good.  The burgers were huge and cooked just right (medium for us). The plain cheesecake was sooooooo good.

I would totally recommend this new restaurant and I would definitely go back again.  Fix the timing issue so the fries are hot, too, and it's a 5.

I must also mention that the establishment is part meat market/general store, bit it in no way takes away from how nice the restaurant is.  The former diner has been renovated very nicely."}
{"text":"First time here, and will DEFINITELY be back! Great atmosphere, great experience! Picked up a bottle of wine in the market to have with our meal, and NO corkage fee. LOVE IT!
I had the striped bass special, and my wife had the \"ohh my gosh\" burger. Both were excellent. Also had the signature sauce wings...they were perfection. The sauce should be sold in a bottle! A bbq and mustard mix with just the right amount of heat.
Ate at the bar because all the tables were already full, but glad we did as Stephanie took such excellent care of us!
Can't say enough good things about our experience! Great job!"}
{"text":"A very cool place with excellent food.  I'm thankful that McAdenville has a place like this!  I've had the Habi burger and shrimp and grits and both way exceeded my expectations.  Fried pickles and cod bites are excellent apps.  Highly recommend to anyone in the area."}
{"text":"Made my second visit to this restaurant today.  Food is fair, service is friendly and atmosphere is excellent. Once again I had the shrimp and grits and it was much better.  Still needs more seasoning and less onions and green peppers but if you add salt, it is good.  My lunch guest had a sandwich that he said was okay.  

If you are looking for a lunch place in the Gastonia area that's a bit more upscale, this is the spot."}
{"text":"Fabulous atmosphere. Beautiful all repurposed interior. Great service. The best burger and perfect red velvet cake. We will be back to try the rest of the fresh fresh menu."}
{"text":"Really good, fresh and delicious food. Cute spot, with charming decor and friendly staff.  Panini was full of tender flavorful ham, with granny smith apple slices.  French fries are thin and crispy, so good and mac n cheese was spiral noodles with a nice cheesy blend, it was an up charge, but tasty.  Price point was high, food was great.  Burger is juicy and delicious.   Fun little bar tucked in the corner, not a big spot but a spot worth more visits.  Yummy!"}
{"text":"We give this 3.5 stars. We had heard good things about this place and decided to stop in for lunch. We were warmly greeted sat at a booth, and given a moment to glance at the menus. Our sweet server came by to take our drink orders however never mentioned the specials. We decided on a sandwich and were presented with bread choices. My husband chose the ciabatta bread, she commented that she also likes it with that sandwich. Lunch arrived promptly. Our sever was very attentive, but she forgot to mention that the roll was an extra. Not that $1 is a deal breaker, but it is information she should have Conveyed. The food was tasty, the service prompt but the lack of details were disappointing. They also had drink specials we didn't see until leaving. I would have ordered one had I known. We would however eat here again."}
{"text":"Had the Jalape√±o hamburger with tatertots,  also the daily special Cobb salad with chicken on top.   The blue cheese was good"}
{"text":"Delicious food and excellent southern hospitality. We all ordered different meals and had happy tummies. Portions are very large and it's possible to share. Prices were also reasonable"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped by this place during lunch time earlier this week. The inside decor is very cool! It looks like Chip and Joanna Gaines were in there decorating it up with a modern rustic feel.

We started with the fried pickles. A previous reviewer complained about them not having any seasoning and I think they took note. Ours were seasoned and delicious. My husband had the Hobby Burger. He said it was the best burger he has since we moved up into the area. Being vegetarian, I had the only vegetarian option, portabella stack with macaroni and cheese. The sandwich was really good, but the macaroni and cheese fell a bit flat. It didn't have a round cheesy flavor and needed salt.

We will be coming back for sure. It's a great little place with an awesome atmosphere! Hoping they maybe add a couple more vegetarian options. :)"}
{"text":"I went to Table and Market on Thursday evening for the first time to enjoy a Girls Night, after hearing rave reviews about it for quite sometime. The restaurant is styled in the cozy, simplistic farmhouse style that is quite common these days and located right downtown in charming McAdenville. I was a little worried about parking since it's such a small downtown area, but it wasn't an issue at the time when I arrived and I snagged a spot right in front of the restaurant!

Up front is a small market area with some coolers containing primarily local cold products ranging from pimento cheese & some take home meals to glass bottled Sundrop & Cheerwine to some craft beer 6-packs. There are also a few shelves of other non-refrigerated products like cheese straws, Lusty Monk mustard (YUM!), snacks, and wines. A deli/butcher section is there, too, which boasts items ranging from sandwich meats to larger cuts of meat and seafood products that you can either purchase to prepare at home or can have prepared in the restaurant. The set-up is rather similar to what String Bean does in Belmont, but on a somewhat smaller scale.

The four of us met at 5:30 and were immediately seated. There were only a 2-3 other tables of folks there at that point. We each ordered a glass of wine or cocktail from the bar. I had a delicious Cab Sav that was generously poured for $9. I ordered salmon with sides of mac & cheese and asparagus. Two of the ladies ordered salmon patties that were out of the market rather than ordering from the menu with tater tots, asparagus, & corn on the cob. The fourth member of our party ordered the Italian sandwich. By the time our food arrived, nearly every table  in the restaurant was filled!

Everyone seemed to be quite pleased with their meals, which arrived promptly and were all prepared just as we had ordered. Everything was quite good and portions were more than fair, but the mac and cheese was a little bland for my taste (to be fair, though, I'm a super snob when it comes to mac & cheese!) We finished off our meal by each ordering one of the 4 dessert options--red velvet cake, cheesecake, Snickers cake, and carrot cake--and sharing them all! The slices were gigantic and delicious! My bill at the end was right at $40 for my wine, salmon (with an extra side as it only comes with one and I wanted two since they had such tempting side offerings!), and my slice of cheesecake. That's definitely more than I would normally spend on dinner for one, but it was pretty fair for what all I ordered.

Everyone from the hostess to our (quite spunky & fun) waiter to the waitress who brought our food to the manager who stopped by our table was incredibly friendly & seemed quite dedicated to making sure our experience was enjoyable. We lingered at our table until nearly 8:00 since there didn't seem to be anyone waiting, and folks continued to stop by to check on us and were exceedingly friendly. Never once did I feel like we were being rushed out of the door (and we made sure to tip generously since we held the table for so long!) All in all, it was a pleasant dining experience from start to finish and I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"A very nice place with some other than usual points. Had lunch there which consisted of a burger and sweet potato fries.  Fries could have been hotter but it was a very good lunch. Expecting a parking problem due to the location but didn't have any problem. Very worth a visit."}
{"text":"A great new place in McAdenville. Had the BLT with tater tots; friends had a burger and the apple/ham panini. Everything was excellent, delivered quickly, and the service was delightful. Our waitress Brittani offered some good advice for our first visit. We'll surely return!"}
{"text":"I ordered the habi burger and my friend ordered the marinara pasta special for the day.  The food was very good, however, the marinara was much spicier than the waitress told us. However, we had a good experience, good service and the atmosphere is nice."}
{"text":"We had high hopes for this new restaurant especially after walking in and seeing the beautiful decor, unfortunately it was a fairly bad experience overall.  My wife, my daughter and I went on New Year's Day and suppose the staff was a bit put out by having to work that day because from the hostess to the server everyone was simply unfriendly. Not outright rude, but delivering the minimum requirements for civility if you know what I mean....certainly not the welcome you expect from a brand new restaurant.
I will begin by saying I ordered the OMG burger and it was fantastic, think Reuben on a large burger. My wife ordered a fillet and their mashed potatoes...and that is where the good news ended. The fillet was average, it was cooked properly but came out almost cold, the small ramekin of potatoes was ice cold. Our server was informed and evidently the solution was to microwave everything so that it came back nuclear hot and overcooked.
My daughter had a kids meal hamburger and fries...she fared a bit better, however her fries were also cold and she only ate a few of them.
There was only one other table seated so it is baffling how 2/3 of the order came out cold - the other table was eating so the kitchen literally had nothing else to do besides prepare our order.
Truthfully, even if the service had been outstanding and the food perfect I would have only given them 4 stars for the lack of value. I really should have taken a photo of the huge dinner plate with nothing but a 6oz fillet and tiny ramekin of potatoes sitting on it...words really don't do it justice. When the bill comes to about $50 for a steak and two burgers (one of which is a kids meal) the whole experience should be top notch and ours simply wasn't."}
{"text":"Bless their hearts. The venue is adorable and the staff was so very nice but the food was just terrible. It wasn't seasoned or well put together. Even the cheeseburger was bland. This place has such great potential but currently is a flat note. We stopped by chic fil a on the way back to the hotel."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Table and Market.  The real compliment is my husband said how good it was and he would go back.  That does not happen often.  Great food and service."}
{"text":"We went here opening week. I had a burger, it was fantastic. Service was great, decent selection of beers. We hung out for a couple of hours, had a really good time. Might go back today! Wrote this review because I was thinking about it. Great spot!"}
{"text":"I took my mom to lunch a couple weeks back for her birthday and she insisted we try Table and Market. It is definitely a cool spot and a great addition to downtown McAdenville.

You enter into the market area as there is a meat counter right in front of you and some \"provision shopping\" to your left. The hostess stand is directly to your right and you enter into the dining room. We got there around 12:30pm and it wasn't terribly busy, so I was quite surprised when the waitress told us that they were already out of one of the specials (the Reuben sandwich). I was kind of disappointed because I love a Reuben, but I soldiered on.

I ended up getting a burger and chips, the birthday girl settled on a salad. Nothing to rock your world, but definitely a good place to grab a casual lunch. Our waitress was very attentive, but not overbearing. As my parents are moving closer to McAdenville, I expect we will be back in the future."}
{"text":"I really want to like this restaurant because it's making a go in a small town, but, I've tried it twice and neither time was the food worthy of the prices charged.  First time was shrimp and grits.  I have eaten shrimp and grits all over the south theirs falls at the bottom.  The dish was poorly seasoned and the shrimp had that fresh frozen flavor.  Now that would have been fine for 10-12 dollars but theirs is almost 18 dollars.  For that, I expect fresh caught never frozen shrimp.  Tonight I had a very easy dish of fish and chips.  The cod was cut in large chunks and had a crispy flavorless batter.  Cod really requires good batter to be tasty and theirs is simply plain and not tasty at all.  Again fine at 7-8 dollars but no bueno at 15.  Didn't finish it.  I also had fried okra that seemed to be frozen and straight out of a bag.  Can't say that for sure, but it tasted and looked pre-made.  The slaw was not good or good tasting and seemed like it was made very early and sat around in the fridge for awhile. Did not finish it either.  I also tried the seared scallop appetizer which was cooked well and tasted fresh but the presentation on a bed of raw greens was lacking appeal and the scallops were not seasoned well and very bland. In all I feel like the food is just not prepared very well and is spotty on freshness.  Not worth the cost.  The sweet tea was good."}
{"text":"My family has now visited Table and Market 3 times for dinner and have added it to our regular rotation.  First of all, I am impressed with the renovations they made to what was an existing restaurant.  The decor is nice without being overly fancy for the area.  The menu gives a variety of options and price ranges; from lighter entrees like salads and BLTs to steaks and seafood.  You can order from the butcher counter as well, but sides are extra.  There's also a good kid's menu.  We've yet to have beer and cocktails here but they have a decent variety of local beer on tap considering the size of the bar (and they also sell local beer out of the cooler).  So far we've had the wings, BLT, pork chop, pesto chicken panini, Italian club, Habi burger, and grilled salmon.  I would highly recommend any of these menu choices but the pork chop was ridiculously good, and I don't even really like pork chops.  On top of the food, the service each time has been great.  The staff has been friendly and attentive without being over bearing.  In short, the food is great, the service is good, the location is good, and the atmosphere is good.  Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"First time here. Nice place.  Ordered
The fried pickles as an appetizer, huge mistake.  Where most places use a thin pickle here they use a thicker pickle. The pickles were not seasoned prior to breading and the breading was unseasoned. For 8.99 you get nine tasteless pickles     
For the main I had the chicken pesto panini with an upcharge to get the Mac and cheese.  Mac and cheese very bland.  Probably did not salt the water when boiling pasta and then no seasoning in the cheese mix.  Adding salt did help but I didn't come to prep my own food.  The panini was, yeah.  Chicken cut into uneven pieces that lacked flavor and the bread was a little crispy for me. Would suggest using while piece of chicken and a little more pesto. And for as hard as the bread was the sandwich was not warm, maybe relook at how we are pressing the sandwich. Would expect the cheese to have melted some.  Will try it again. Would like to try a steak or seafood dish in the evening hours.b"}
{"text":"Wonderful dinner tonight.  Service was quick and friendly and foid was great.  I had the 6oz filet mignon cooked medium rare with mashed potatoes and broccoli. The steak was fantastic....so tender and cooked perfectly.  The potatoes were a bit too salty for me but I ate every bite!!  I will def be back."}
{"text":"Tried T&M today, based on several  friends recommendations. We enjoyed lunch today, specifically for me the Italian Hoagie. Service was excellent & the food was fantastic! Keep up the fantastic job you are doing. #GoodEats"}
{"text":"Awesome! You can tell the ownership took time to design this place. I've had three meals here, all were outstanding. Beer selection is above average and I'm a beer snob. Met and spoke with the owner, super nice. This place has class, not a chain restaurant. Support your local businesses folks, visit, dine , and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. Our second visit and definitely plan on many more. Fresh and delicious, we really liked the menu. Staff was polite and very attentive."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant downtown McAdenville.  Nice menu, good dessert, and well varied selection of beers and wines.   On the downside, tables are too close together, had people bumping into us during the meal. They do cut corners....okra is frozen then fried. Served luke warm and chewy.  Main courses are \"a la carte\".  Dessert and coffee were good.  Service was fine.  Next time we'll sit in the bar area out of the way of traffic."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and have been thrilled with my choices, seared scollops and salmon. Most dishes are a la carte which makes the prices a little pricey. Overall, however, I'm sure I'll be back. I love the idea that you can choose your meat from the case and the chef prepares it. The quaint ambiance is enticing and the servers are experienced and friendly. I'm happy to support local  businesses.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great location but horrible service. Waited 50 minutes, after ordering, for a burger and a sandwich and the place was not packed. They gave a table (which was seated after us) free appetizers for the wait but our server all but ignored our table. Burger tasted great, but I asked for medium and received a well done burger."}
{"text":"Table and Market was so impressive on our initial visit that we went again just a week later.  While the second visit didn't quite live up to the first, it was still quite enjoyable.

On our first visit, we started with the cod bites.  They were crispy, steaming hot, had a well-salted batter, and the cod itself was perfectly cooked and tender.  The remoulade they came with was an excellent accompaniment, adding creaminess to the mix and a hint of tang.

We'd been craving a burger so I went with the Steak and Sunny Side Egg burger.  It comes on a brioche bun with bacon, lettuce, tomato, onion, mayo, pimento cheese which I substituted with pepper jack, and of course a runny egg.  The good: coarsely ground, well-salted beef patty.  Egg was sunny side up as intended.  Bacon was delicious and perfectly cooked.  Brioche, which I'm not convinced is the best choice for a burger, was terrific anyway.  The not-so-good: diced onions belong nowhere near a burger.  Give me thinly sliced onion or give me death.  Mayo was inexpertly and excessively applied to the lettuce (?!) in dribs and drabs, which in my opinion ruined the appearance of the burger.  Either serve it to me on the side in a ramekin as the burger gods intended, or spread it thin on the top bun itself.  The patty itself was cooked past my requested medium, to at least medium-well.

Overall, with some judicious mayo reassignment to a napkin and the careful repositioning of diced onion for total burger coverage, it was really delicious and I'd order it again in a heartbeat.  There's nothing quite like burger juices and egg yolk dripping down your hands and disgusting your fellow diners.  My wife got the turkey burger and said it was really good, but that's not my thing.

For a side, I got a side salad which was a lovely little garden salad with their house-made Greek dressing.  They clearly care about their produce because it was all fresh, crisp, and delicious, and a perfect portion for a side salad (not too small, not too big).  This concluded our first visit.

For our second visit, the trouble began when I ordered a Hop, Drop & Roll, which I was told they were out of.  I don't know if it's just me, but I feel like 80% of the time when I order a beer that comes in a can or bottle and it's not on draft, that the restaurant is always out of it.  Is this just a Charlotte-area thing?  Is it a nationwide epidemic?  I don't know but it bugs me.  Instead I went with a Hopness Monster which I had on the previous visit and is a solid IPA.

For our starter we got the fried pickles.  These were the thickest pickle chips I've ever had in the fried application, which is a good thing.  Whoever works their fryer knows what the hell they're doing, because they were cooked as expertly as the cod bites from the previous visit.  They came with a chipotle aioli, which was very tasty and helped to make up for the fatal flaw of the pickle chips: they weren't very pickle-y.  No briny splash of flavor when biting into them, and in fact they weren't even very salty like a pickle should be.  I don't know if they just weren't pickled for long enough or what, but luckily with the well-seasoned batter and tasty aioli, we still ate the plate clean.

The biggest letdown of the night was my entree.  I got the Low Country Boil, which as everyone knows is shrimp, andouille sausage, red potatoes, and corn on the cob in an Old Bay broth.  The good: the shrimp were PERFECTLY cooked.  Not a hint of rubber or under-doneness.  This is a testament to the kitchen.  The corn on the cob was corn on the cob, which is always good if unremarkable.  The sausage was well-seasoned, though I do like my andouille a little more garlicky, but that's personal preference.  The bad: everything else.  The potatoes tasted completely unseasoned, and there are few things worse than plain, unseasoned boiled potatoes.  The broth was thin, insipid, and just not at all flavorful.  The sourdough crostini was served in the bowl, which meant that half of them were already soggy.  Not a good look.  Overall it just wasn't a tasty or cohesive dish.  My wife got the chicken breast which was really well-cooked based on the bite I had, with a nice crispy skin.

Overall Table and Market has a lot going for it, and we'll definitely be back.  I'll just be better prepared with knowing what not to order, and what to ask for when I get another burger."}
{"text":"Visited on a BUSY Friday night and even though we were among the last customers served, our server, Emma was charming, helpful and wonderful!

We did have to wait quite a bit for a table, not a big deal, but I do wish they'd take reservations.  This place is awesome enough to be busy all of the time!

We sat at the bar while waiting for our table and the bartender was so busy!  I felt sorry for him, he was working like a dog.  He honestly needed help with all of the people that were there.  We enjoyed most of our drinks.  They have Prosecco on tap, so I ordered the French 75 which was so refreshing with the gin and lemon juice.

The side salad was delicious, with homemade Ranch, but the waitress did let us know that not all of the dressings were homemade.  That fact would keep me from ordering a dinner salad, normally.

I had the filet special, which was a small filet (6 oz) with 2 sides for $21.  Seriously a great deal.  The filet was cooked well and I loved the seasoning on it.  Charred perfectly.  I chose macaroni and cheese and fried okra.  Both were delicious and I enjoyed having non-traditional steak sides.

The decor inside is very modern and current, with exposed brick and farming implements as decor.  I loved it.

Can't wait to return and try some of the sandwiches I see folks raving about.  What a great addition to McAdenville!"}
{"text":"My family and I went for lunch after church. The hostess was friendly and the wait was short. The food was excellent. I had the shrimp and grits and it was as good as I have ever had. My wife and one daughter got the Johnny Apple Brie Panini and Mac & Cheese. Both said it was wonderful! My other daughter got the French Toast special. She said it was delicious and a good balance of sweet and savory. We were too full for desert but will go back soon!"}
{"text":"Heard wonder things , sadly my visit was mediocre. No refill on my one drink . Greek salad , nothing special , dressing tasted bottled , would have expected homemade , lettuce was very inconsistently sized . Next item , Turkey BLT add provolone cheese ,, no cheese .. watch out too, cheese is up charged . 50 ( not disclosed when ordered, sounds petty , but I was also upcharged .25 cents for a sauce .. not sure what sauce I needed for my salad ) . Called the manager just to let him know about my experience...anyways the place is nice . Hopefully growing pains ."}
{"text":"What a fabulous place to eat.  I had the belt on sour dough.  Slap your mama good.  Prosecco on tap'. How can bad can that be!  I saw the shrimp salad walk by and salivated.

The manager, owner and wait staff are extremely attentive and make you feel welcomed.  Will eat my way through their menu.  Stay tuned!"}
{"text":"Came in Sunday for a late lunch. 
Started with the Shrimp Cocktail. 
It was perfect with the shrimp cooked just right and the cocktail sauce had just the right amount of spice. 
My daughter did the French Toast and said that it was very good but a bit too sweet. 
My wife enjoyed the bacon and cheddar quiche and I had the Italian Club. 
The meat was fresh and the sandwich was really good. 
They also have Tater Tots!!!

The server was very attentive and gave great service."}
{"text":"I hate to give such a poor review for such an interesting small business but I feel like this review will help people decide if it's right for them. I'll start with the good.

Good: The steaks. They were fantastic. I had the cowboy ribeye and my wife had the filet mignon. Both were cooked perfectly. Seasoned perfectly. The steaks had great sear marks that added flavor as well. Definitely worth the price for each.

The decor. The building is amazing. It looks very original and from what little I read about the history, it seemed like they strive to keep it that way.

Unfortunately that's all I can really say was good about the restaurant. Next are the cons.

Cons: The rest of the food. We started with the cod bites. They were flavorless and had zero salt on them. The sauce they came with was pretty good, but the bites were just flavorless. I guess the fry cook was having a bad night because he also didn't salt the French fries. The fries were okay otherwise, they could have cooked awhile longer to be crispy, but it is what it is. My wife had broccoli with her steak and the broccoli was wayyyy over cooked. The broccoli looked almost grey because it was so over cooked.

Our seat location. They sat us at a small, 2 seat table directly behind the bar. The whole time we were eating or waiting we had people constantly standing over us and just being too close. I don't really blame the patrons on this, this was just poor effort by management to squeeze in another seat in a tiny restaurant. Not only were we constantly crowded, but we also had to deal with servers practically running by our table with food/drinks. I'm very surprised we didn't have our drinks knocked over with how often we were being bumped by everyone.

Our server. I hate to call her out by name, but our server {redacted} was terrible. I think it was because she was a Bar tender trying to cover food tables as well, but I'm not sure. She was dressed in all black as opposed to the normal attire the other servers were wearing. The whole night she seemed to be missing or at the bar. It took forever to have our food brought out. The food did come out warm so that might be the kitchens fault. We felt like we were just an after thought our whole time there. We had to sit with empty glasses multiple times because she wasn't around. Another thing that sealed the fate of our trip was when {redacted} finally decided to bring my card back after paying she didn't even stick around 2 seconds to say have a nice night, she dropped my card at the table and was about 5ft away when she finished saying have a nice night.

All in all this was a pretty bad trip. I've heard people raving about it and was super disappointed by the whole experience. We thought we had given them enough time to sort out the new business troubles but I guess we were wrong. I don't believe we'll be returning with the way our experience turned out."}
{"text":"I've been in a few times since they opened and always had good food and a good experience. The burger is quite good and I don't usually get a burger out since I can do that so easily at home. The steak was also very good. They've got a great special every day and I've seen few that weren't worth running right over. They've got cases of fresh meat and seafood as well as beer and wine. The way they brought the history of the Town into everything from the walls to the tabletops is remarkable. This is a great small-town place and a wonderful addition to the restaurant scene."}
{"text":"Stopped in while on the road - wanted a non-chain, sit down place and this had good reviews, so we gave it a try.  And glad we did. We stuck with sandwiches for today including a BLT and a pulled pork. All were good as was the service. Interesting decor and atmosphere."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is nice, but the service was slow and the food is sub par. I had the fish and chips which was over cooked and they don't have vinegar!?!? My wife had a burger which was so over cooked and DRYYYYYYY. That paired with slow refills was not a good combo. We will try again, but we will wait a long time."}
{"text":"I had never heard of this restaurant until I saw it was rated best new restaurant of Best of Gaston 2018. It wasn't long before I planned a visit here. When we arrived a little after 6pm on a Friday night we were told there was about a 30 minute wait. Normally we would have made reservations but they don't take them. I'm a little bummed about it, but I can understand that they don't want empty tables so it's not something to be upset about. The atmosphere walking in is very welcoming. It's definitely a place for a date night or with a group of friends. Not really somewhere to bring your little kiddos though. They have a small waiting area before being seated, but they also have a small market featuring local NC products like sauces and rubs. There is also a wine section so you can choose a bottle to have at the table. The butcher section has different selections of meat and seafood to buy and take home or have the kitchen cook it for you for dinner.

Once we were seated our waitress, Kinsley, greeted us warmly and informed us of the specials. We ordered the charcuterie board with two meats to start with. For my entree I ordered the jalapeno burger and mac and cheese (yes, I was starving, can you tell?). The charcuterie board looked fantastic when it came out. There was so much food so we took our time trying everything. We were only halfway through once our main courses arrived. My burger looked and tasted amazing. The pickled jalapenos were spicy but had great flavor. I don't think we spoke for the first five minutes because everything was so delicious. I'm glad I ordered the mac and cheese because it was the perfect pairing to the spicy burger. The mac and cheese was very creamy and mild, but the crunchy panko topping really made the entire dish stand out. Our waitress checked on us throughout the meal making sure we were happy and checking if we needed anything. After we finished our meal we were so full, the food was too good to even try to take home.

Starting with the ambiance of the restaurant, to the fantastic service, and then finishing with the amazing food, I encourage anyone in the area to visit here. I am completely in love with this place and I cannot wait to go back again."}
