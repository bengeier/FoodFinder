{"text":"Go check out.  It's only going to get better.  Can't wait to see them add live music! Best new spot in town. Very cool place for morning cup of great tasting Cuban coffee.  Very nice lake views. This place will be a hit! Go check it out before the tourist do."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem! Great, healthy Latin food! Tucked in the middle of a housing park. If you're ever in summerlin, definitely check it out! Food is bomb!"}
{"text":"Eclectic menu, incredible flavors...welcome back Chef Beni.

I was a regular at Chef Beni's former restaurant downtown and am thrilled to see him back on the Las Vegas scene in such a beautiful setting. The menu can accommodate just about any dietary orientation, I am vegan and and went with a GF companion and the options for us seemed endless and were delicious. The only problem was I didn't have room for desert (Vega chocolate cake). 

A fun and tasty item from the drink menu was the Madhatter Cuban Teapot. Our server was a delight and I look forward to checking out Republic, the coffee shop side for brunch very soon. 

As with all new restaurants there are going to be some kinks to work out, so go with a little patience if you are going during a busy time of day/night. It will be worth it."}
{"text":"Thanks once again Yelp AND the establishment for not removing this place due to closure (4/6/15)."}
{"text":"My friends and I were in the mood for a really tasty Latin Food Evening. We tried a few eateries in the past, here and there, all in Vegas, but none was a keeper. This place, LatinFish, with a lake view and a cozy dining room was a surprise,  a pleasant one. We ordered Tapas, and were impressed by the variety and the tasty way they were assorted. Loved the shrimp -- the sauce is mmm incredibly good. I ordered Sangria, and my friends ordered some cocktails with exotic names. We ordered  a Paella which was unanimously received with ThumbsUp. We shouted, WE WANT THE CHEF! Chef Beni Velazquez came for a few minutes to clink glasses with us and to thank us for coming to check his newly opened restaurant. It was a nice thing to do, given the fact that the restaurant was pretty packed up. He told us that new things are going to unravel here soon, such as Live Music, Karaoke Nights, Food Contests and Raffles. 
Hey, we are happy to have found our new place to hang out while having tasty Real Latin Food and cocktails with all kinds of aromas and names. We want to thank our server, Miguel, who provided excellent service and who replaced our yummy desert, Caramel Flan, and cleaned up when we accidentally broke a plate. 
We'll be back for more. 
Cons: We weren't seated right away, and I wish we have made reservations in advance! Nevertheless, the wait was 15 min and well worth it! Viva LatinFish!"}
{"text":"Really disappointing. Either the place was having a really off night (which you absolutely cannot have when you first open) or its just not good food. 

let me start with one thing... we are not picky people. we honeslty are not one of these couples that send things back. we are the type like most who will just accept the bad food as a bad choice and eat something when we get home :)

started with drinks... my girlfriend (who is cuban) said the Sangria was undrinkable. we sent it back - trust me - when it comes to alcohol we are never picky. if it gets you buzzed - it works. lol she couldnt even drink it. had to settle for a beer - of which her glass smelled like a wet rag. she was too embarrassed to say anything because we had just sent back the sangria

we ordered 4 things - some tapas and a margarita pizza to share.

so - let me also say the place was empty.. only 3 tables were being used. probably bc that have done such a bad job letting people know its now open for business after many delays. the place is really nice. we walked in and were excited. looks like a very cool fun place to eat. 

but the food was all a disappointment. they didnt have any platanos. so they had to cancel that (but still charged us for it on the final bill). the battered cod tapas were so salty they become almost inedible. she had a half of one and i choked down a couple more bc i was starving. but it was waaay too salty to be served in a restaurant. the pizza had potential - but the crust was odd.. we were joking that it looked almost like a wonton. i dont know if it was old or supposed to be like that - but it was hard. really hard. didnt taste fresh. again - i ate it because i was starving. she ordered the stuffed peppers tapas. also - very strange texture and taste. she ate half of one.. i stopped after a small taste. 

i know they are new - and i personally think they are having a hard time managing fresh food until crowds start coming in. we also got a kick out of the food being so bad and the chef outside shmoozing with the other two tables (which were obviously friends and family which made us the only real customers) instead of being in the kitchen. maybe if the chef spent more time in the kitchen and not on the floor the food will taste better.

its a shame. i live across the street and was looking for this place to be a goto place like garfields was. perhaps i will try it again in the future. but someone will have to drag me. 

i write this in hopes the people at latin fish read this and work out all their kinks. id like them to succeed i think the place has a lot of potential to be a great hang out."}
{"text":"The experience gets better every time I go.  The first time I went fascinated! Now I have been several times as a regular customer and twice for restaurant week since they open! 
For restaurant week they offer one of the best deals in town. Can't beat it.  I love chef Beni Velazquez and his delicious food! I truly recommend this beautiful place!"}
{"text":"This is your restaurant for Cuban, Puerto Rican with a hint of Argentina and Italian. It's amazing. Think of tapas that really is larger plates than traditional tapas. The menu is quite large and has many healthy item also.  I can't say enough about Latinfish. The staff is friendly and the chef came out to greet us. Everything is made fresh."}
{"text":"I Have been a fan of Chef Beni since his days downtown. He has brought many of his favorite dishes and many new ones to his new location. Latin fish  is located on a lake with a great view. The food is outstanding as usual. I was there opening Weekend the staff is very friendly the decor is very inviting. It is located where Garfield's once was. Definitely worth the drive."}
{"text":"Best hidden secret in Vegas..... Great selection.... Totally recommend!!!  Chef Beni is worth the visit!!"}
{"text":"This review is for Isabella's Vegas (The new Latin Fish)

- Had high expectations, based on the rave reviews I read on Yelp
- Restaurant itself was hard to find. I saw a sign on the building but couldn't figure out if the restaurant was upstairs or downstairs. Needs better signage.
- Received friendly, prompt service on a Saturday night. 
- The complimentary plantain chips were delicious! Just salty and crispy enough.
- Half off select tapas during happy hour- but the prices are hidden by a green dot. It was odd. This should be changed, as you should always know prices up front, without a surprise when the bill arrives.  We ordered calamari and \"little pollo\" tapas plates. They were just ok. 
- We were given a menu that had the Salmon Salad priced at $8.95 BUT we were charged $15.00 for it. The salad was delicious, and although we should have brought it up to the server's attention, we chose not to because we were in a hurry to get to our next destination. At the end of the day though, prices charged should be the advertised (menu) prices.
- $5 sangria was one of the best I've ever had. I would go back just for sangrias.
- The view is stunning.  I hope to return sometime for Sunday Brunch, as that menu looks delicious. I'll wait a few months though for Isabella's to iron out the kinks before returning."}
{"text":"The new place is called Isabella's but I still see Latin fish everywhere. Let me start by saying this was my Mother's Day surprise and they had a Mother's Day menu. Just emphasizing all the acknowledgment of it being Mother's Day. So our experience started off with a hostess that looked at me like I had two heads when I was holding my daughter. After the looks and side talk to another staff I was assuming this was not a family type environment. She stayed could the baby sit in our laps as they had nothing to offer her. This was fine. But as I walked through the facility to be seated, I noticed all the other children around the same age as my daughter. So I'm not sure what that was about but not a very great feeling to walk into. So this was pretty much the start of what to be expected. The wait was long, food was okay. Not sure what's going on. Definitely made me miss Garfields."}
{"text":"this place is rockin it!  food was absolutely delicious! service outstanding! 5 cheese crab (fresh) mac and cheese - best i've EVER had! ambiance was awesome! can't beat the water view! sea bass - flacky, fresh and tender!  a new favorite!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal. I followed chef beni here from Bar + Bistro in his first week of being open and boy did he exceed all expectations. I let him do the ordering and each dish was even better than the last. I can't wait to go back again to try more dishes. Great addition to Vegas' food scene. Thanks chef!"}
