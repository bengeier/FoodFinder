{"text":"Spent a very fun evening here with friends drinking and having snacks.  It was raining so we sat inside.  It was a bit pricey but like I said we had a lot of fun.  Good service."}
{"text":"Horrible Birthday Dinner!

Went to Remy's last night with a about a group of 15 people. At first glance the restaurant and patio looked great from outside. When you go in you see a horribly outdated decor. Old chairs with paint chips, green velvet padded walls caked in dust and grungy carpet. The bathrooms were actually worse and were extremely dark, grimy, and smelled like urine. This place in in need of a major first floor overhaul.

Now to the service, our waitress had over 6 large tables to server (some of the groups being 15 and over - which was not fair to her), so getting repetitive visits to our table were far few and between. Drinks were ok, but unfortunately, food was way below par. All our pasta dishes and appetizers were extremely bland. We had to put salt and Parmesan to bring out some sort of flavour. Some of the more expensive dishes we ordered like the steak and veal parmigiana were also lackluster.

The gentleman bringing our the food to us was rude and did not seem like he even wanted to be there.

Overall, I would not expect this grade of food and service from a hip Yorkville restaurant that is established.

I would not recommend this place unfortunately to any of my friends or family, unless you're going to the patio for drinks only."}
{"text":"I recommend as a nice, reasonably-priced restaurant/lounge in Yorkville. I had a lovely bowl of angel hair pasta with pomodorro sauce. The tomato sauce was nice and thick, full of fresh herbs and garlic . My sister had the regatoni with sausage and rapini, which she also really enjoyed. All of the bowls of pasta are quite large - so don't go too crazy with the appetizers. We went on a Saturday night and the restaurant was fairly empty. As a result, very fast/attentive service."}
{"text":"I was conflicted about giving four-stars to Remy's. If I hadn't read the reviews on Yelp, I probably would have given it three, or even two, stars. 

I visited Remy's on a Saturday afternoon in the summer. It was hot and humid, and I wanted to have a drink on a patio in the area. After reading Yelp reviews, I knew Remy's was not known for it's food so I did not expect much at all. I ordered a pitcher of sangria (I was with someone, so I didn't actually drink alone) and the blackened chicken salad. The service was pretty good. The sangria was alright. The salad was nothing to write home about. Let's just say if you were hungry and/or drunk you would have loved it. 

The best thing about the rooftop patio is its size. There are a lot of tables so you don't feel confined, which is hard to find in Yorkville. It's a very casual, laid-back atmosphere where you can get away from the street level noise and just have a drink with a large or small group. The one thing that did surprise me though is the dated decor and fixtures inside. It looked like it was built, designed and last cleaned in the early 90s. 

If you're in the area looking for a drink, you really can't go wrong. They don't charge Yorkville-like prices so it's hard to complain about the menu. Just don't expect to be amazed by their food."}
{"text":"Went to Remy's for Sunday brunch, the food was horrible. Wilted salad on a cheap white bread bun, dried onion (leftover from the night before?), frozen low grade French fries.  

The place was cold and empty, the sound of the bar personnel washing dishes was overwhelming.   Service was ok, however seemed like the stuff enjoyed hanging out with each other rather than serving patrons.  

The place definitely looks better from the outside than it is inside.  Every time I pass by Remy's, on any day of the year, except maybe Saturday nights in the summer, it's never busy.  Makes one wonder how such a huge place manages to stays in business, considering the poor quality of food, questionable atmosphere and unenthusiastic service...  There are better places in the neighborhood that offer a better dining experience.

I would not come back to Remy's and wouldn't recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"I sometimes wonder how this places stays in business. Each time I have gone there for dinner the dining room is nearly empty. Having said that I have found the choice & quality of the food as well as the service excellent. The prices are reasonable. There is bar area as well as a rooftop patio during the warmer weather."}
{"text":"I went there on Thursday evening .. and it was totally crowded.... I felt its an excellent place to hangout with friends; ....the outdoor patio, the ambiance and the music was all hit at this place .. the service was good, they kept the drinks coming on time .. but overall good service, good food, decent music, hot waitresses, patio atmosphere .. can't ask for more"}
{"text":"As an experienced restaurateur, this is what I can tell you about Remy's:

1. If you are looking for good service, walk the other way.

2. If hire-es straight out of grade school with the organization skills of a monkey appeal to you, eat here.

3. If you have taste buds, walk the other way.

4. If you don't want to be approached for 15 minutes and have a thing for lip-stick smeared across glass rims, then this is your fetish spot."}
{"text":"Overall it's the best patio in Yorkville to have some drinks in the summer.  A few pints or a pitcher of sangria and some good company makes for a good night.  It's pretty busy between Thursday and Sunday so there is the chance of a line up.

Food overall is decent, but it's more of an accompaniment for drinks than a reason to actually go here."}
{"text":"Worst food and service I've ever experienced in my life, no joke.  Alexandra was so rude to us.   My california chicken sandwich bun definitely tasted old.  The chicken didn't taste fresh either.  Someone else in my party ordered the fish and chips and it was definitely high-liner.  

I don't recommend this place to anyone.  

Their tag line should be \"Yorkville's DUMP\".  

I wish there was a zero star rating but I'm forced to give them a one."}
{"text":"interior needs a redo, green velour walls and brass. tacky and the chairs are not comfortable. 

i was expecting more from this place, the stucco walls on the outside make it look a whole lot better. the patio experience may be better we'll see when it warms up.

food was decent though. group had a rigatoni with cream sauce, eggs benedict and veal parma sandwich."}
{"text":"Food was lousy and overpriced. They are categorized as an Italian restaurant but they have INDIAN food on the menu. Butter chicken with PITA? Shouldn't it be naan?
What about the pita appetizer? That's mediterranean! They didn't even put bread  and olive oil on the table for us to nibble on.

Had the pizza which was awful and overpriced (premade dry crust and sauce.... frozen pizza would tasted better and for 6 bucks!) Ok I'm not expecting Terroni or Libretto quality pizza but at least hand rolled crust and fresh toppings would have been nice. 

Service was SERIOUSLY lacking! Waited over an hour to order food and then to get our food. Water glasses sat empty for at least an hour before we got a refill. Worst of all, the server included a 15 gratuity on all the bills which we had to pay. I would have given less than 15 % if I could have. The waitress ROBYN made 50-60 dollars in tips alone tonight when she should have made at least half. I will never come here again."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant at a great location. The staff was friendly and the dessert was fantastic (especially the Tiramisu)! Perfect place to hang out with your girlfriends and catch up.  The pasta we had was a little bit undercooked, but everything else was perfect. Would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"My SO and I stopped in for drinks before our Hot Docs movie and we got to pick our seats when we walked in.  It took over 10 minutes to get drink menus and our order in.  I asked for two glasses of water alongside our drinks but our server fail to bring them over even after I reminded her after she bought over our drinks.  The place was only half filled with patrons so I do not understand why service was such a fali.

The overall atmosphere is like a dated lounge, they have leather lounge chairs which adds character to the place. I can imagine it being a happening spot on a Friday or Saturday among the Yorkville folks.

I would be interested to try our their food menu only if their service improves."}
{"text":"The patio at Remy's is very large and comfortable, offering a beautiful view of Yorkville and a wonderful drinking environment. Although it's a great place to drink at after work, their food selection is disappointing. I ordered nachos which were very bare; they were lacking in cheese, vegetables and sauce. It wasn't the top dining experience I've had."}
{"text":"I would give three stars for the food if I didn't find out what they charged me was different from the menu price. I ordered a spaghetti from a lunch menu ($13 for lunch) and a penne ($15 for lunch) but I was charged $15 and $16 for the two. What a sneaky, low, dirty restaurant."}
{"text":"We were at Remy's on a beautiful spring afternoon and absolutely loved the rooftop patio. We had a perfect spot in the sun and couldn't have asked for much more in that department.

The food and drinks were a different story...

I wanted something light, so went with the fish crepes. I know that doesn't sound like a great idea at a pub-style place, but I figured they wouldn't have them on the menu if they couldn't do them properly. How wrong I was!!

They were an absolute disaster. Little bits of frozen seafood swimming in this gooey sun driend tomato sauce, in thin, flavourless crepes. Yuck!!

My wife did better with the Remy's Wrap, but was shocked to discover that her glass of Sangria was $9.00!! And let's be clear, this was not a large glass. Just a normal wine glass with rather bland Sangria.

Remy's gets two stars mostly because of the sun, but I wouldn't recommend it for much more than a couple of beers and some people watching!!"}
{"text":"$12.50 mojitos, $7.50 bottles of beer, why did we come here again?  The drink prices here are ridiculous but surprisingly the food prices are decent and calamari is pretty good.  A friend ordered the stilton cheese, pancetta burger which he loved but the sweet potato fries were downright gross.  Service; meh.  Typical tourist servers who prefer texting and blabbing to their co workers while your beer melts in the sun atop the bar.  Just bring the damn drink over already!  I wouldn't go there to get bombed cus 5 beers would run you at least $50 bucks with tax and tip.  And if you drink like me then you're easily looking at  $100.   The only thing this place has going for it is its location in Yorkville and a pretty huge patio, other than that, there's no reason to go here."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for about 10 years now. To be honest, not *my*  popular to go. 

The first couple of times I came out, about a decade ago, they use to have a drink menu set in an alphabetical order and a girl (friend) and I went through the entire menu during a summer at their patio. NOW , THAT WAS COOL. A lesson learned back then? The drink called \"A Godfather,\" it's truly, nasty and disgusting. Pure alcohol. 

But ever since then, I only use the location when I have a large party and when, well, Hemingway across the street is full. 

Don't get me wrong, Remy's has a modern decor, a dance floor and a large patio which in my opinion is nicer to be in than Hemingway's. Since Remy's patio is rather long and the tables are set farther apart, which gives a more refined look. 

The minuses is that as far as I have been/walked by the place the dance floor is always deserted even when the music is pumping, so I would not go there to dance. Also once, at a party on the 2nd floor -- indoors not the patio bar-- bartenders were only selling bottles (even though beer tabs where at the bar) but when I headed downstairs they sold me a pint no problem at about the same price as a bottle. It's wasn't my party so I do not know if they had an understanding or what but I felt that it was kind of scam-ish of the place. After that, everyone who saw me get one, began doing it too. Bartenders did not seem too pleased so then they asked for us not to walk up and down stairs holding pints. Fair. Still scam-ish about the beer though. 

I have never tried any of their food since to be honest their menu does not compel *me* so I only go there for drinks. However some of my friends have had some and they reported nothing special. So the only thing I would suggest is to try it yourself.      

So in the end, the best reason to go to Remy's is to enjoy a few drinks in their patio.  Keep in mind that it can get kinda of busy. I would even suggest it a as laid-back third date place if you are going just for drinks. Also I have seen that it is a cool place for a girl's night out. 

On a funny note, if you are there at the patio, check the east side. Someone lives there, and they have a balcony which overlooks into the patio. Man, that would suck if you need to get up early, since it can get quite loud on a Friday night. Also, I have seen them try to have a brunch in the mornings, not the best place to have one if they appreciate their privacy.

If you want a central place, with a patio that feel more like a martini bar than a pub-ish, then this place fits the bill."}
{"text":"Remy's is okay.  I've had food here in the past and it has never been anything to write home about.  More recently, my boyfriend and I paid a visit to their patio (since Hemmingways was bursting at the seams).  The patio itself is pretty nice and their drink menu was quite extensive.

The downfall was the service.  It took a really long time to get drinks.  It also seemed like our server had a timing issue: she came to greet us upon our arrival with menus and then was back in 2 minutes.  Then, when we said we needed a few more minutes she literally disappeared for about 20 minutes.  It was difficult to track her down.

The crowd is also a mishmash of people: young people, old people, obnoxious people, rich people etc.  Everyone can fit in, but I have to say there were a lot of irritating loud and drunk people.  That being said, if you want to go somewhere more laid back in Yorkville for a drink this patio is always an option.  There will be a line on the weekend past 10:30pm."}
{"text":"We ate on huge rooftop patio over the unseasonably warm Easter weekend. We got a seat no problem and there was plenty of sun.

Service was good and prices were reasonable. The menu was interesting and there were some selections I didn't expect. I enjoyed the Butter Chicken very much. 

Potentially my replacement go-to place for summer dining- watch out Hemmingway's!"}
{"text":"A ghetto of  Eurotrash thugs and cigar smoking old geezers. They don't list the drink prices on the menu, so for a well drink double vodka soda I was unknowingly charged 17.00 each before tax. it's not for the ambiance..

...that being said, the lobster ravioli are good and worth a try."}
{"text":"Awesome patio!! Good beer selection. Good, friendly service. Mediocre patio food (they have a different menu in the restaurant). Recommendation: Drink, don't eat there."}
{"text":"Remy's gets a lot of traffic from a wealth of demographics, but it really isn't much to write home about. The indoor area and the food are both pretty average to below-average, but the patio is fun in the summer. 

The wait staff is nice, albeit a little absent at times. 

They seem to get great business, I guess I just don't really \"get\" it."}
{"text":"Wow, ghetto is right.  The patio upstairs looks rundown.  And $30 for a pitcher of Sangria?

The food was terrible.  The pasta was overdone and mushy/sticky and the sliders tasted like cat food.

Just don't do it.  Don't got there."}
{"text":"My mother and I went here for a Saturday afternoon lunch. She said she had come here with a friend and said she enjoyed her time here.
We arrived and I must admit I did like the atmosphere. It was quite classy and it was peaceful as we were one of a few handful patrons that were there. 
We were greeted and seated quite promptly by the hostess
We were greeted by the server as well..who..to be quite honest did not look like she wanted to be there at all. I have to give her some slack though because it did seem like she was the only server for lunch.

My mom and I ordered the same thing: the benedict - both for 13 dollars which is .. i suppose reasonable for the yorkville area. My mother, who is quite demanding I am aware, wanted her eggs runny and not too well done. A few minutes later, I heard the waitress yell that order to her kitchen staff. I don't know if they're aware that we could hear them - which was albeit fine because not like anything rude was said. 

The food came and it was average. I dont think it was worth 13 dollars as its just the egg muffin, the eggs and some fruit whereas other places would include meat, toast and potatoes but whatever. My mother found quite a large eggshell in her food and she pointed it out the waitress. My mom, being picky (i am aware), said that this had never happened to her before. The waitress did not apologize and asked if everything else was okay. We were promptly given the bill (without a discount for the eggshell) and the waitress did not thank us and did not greet us goodbye. 

Overall, Id rate it a 2. The food was okay but I did not enjoy the service - and she seemed like she'd rather be anywhere than there."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times but only for drinks, this past time was drinks as well but food came along for the ride. On a gorgeous day, sitting up on the patio was the best. It was a little bit too warm as the plastic chairs kept sticking to my legs but still very nice.

I had the sangria (pitcher of course) and it tasted pretty darn good. Price is a little steep at $25 but not bad for what you get in return. I ordered the California grilled chicken sandwich, it was phenomenal. It came with a side of salad verde and it had lettuce, tomato, mayo and bacon in the sandwich. Excellent choice and I overheard many passersby say that they were interested in the yummy looking sandwich. 

I would say that the patio is much better than sitting inside which has an old establishment feel to it that I'm not too impressed by. This place needs some serious reno but for a nice day on the patio, this place is top notch."}
{"text":"I was in Toronto on business during the blistery winter and decided to brave the outside elements to grab dinner. The restaurant is cozy and nice. During my visit the place was not even close to busy. I only saw a few other tables but I will attribute that to the negative degree weather.  I had one of their burgers with bacon. I thought it was great. My issue and reasoning for 3 stars was the service. 

It took a few minutes for the girl working to acknowledge my existence even though she saw me enter. She looked at me and then went back to whatever it was she was doing without a word.  After she finished up her task she showed me to my table.  I didn't time it but it was a decent amount of time before the same person reappeared and asked me what i wanted to drink. 

Thinking ahead I told her I was also ready to order, which I did. I didn't see her again until my food was delivered after that I didn't see her again until time to pay. No follow-up, no check-in visit - nothing. She brought out the credit card machine and walked away. The machine wasn't working (could have been user error - I'll never know) so I waited and waited and waited. I finally flagged her down and she took off with the machine. I waited some more. When she returned she actually waited at the table this time around. I paid and left as quickly as possible. 

I looked at the time as I was walking out and realized the entire process took an hour and a half. It shouldn't take that long to grab a burger in a place that isn't even close to busy."}
{"text":"Remy's has a great patio. Good rooftop on a cute little lane in Yorkville. Great for a summer afternoon/night drinking location. 

Problems arise when you get hungry after drinking. The food has always been pretty crap. Last time I went and I got nachos. Honestly, it was not a good scene. Only one layer of cheese and even that layer was skimpy. Little to no veg if I recall correctly. Nothing but a sad little plate of dry chips... for 12 bones. 

Food gets 1 star, patio gets 4. I'll give it a three"}
{"text":"Great food at a great price. Friendly staff. Awesome patio. This is the place you come to enjoy time with friends. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I really liked this place. After waking around all afternoon, it was nice to stumble upon this place and sit down at their rooftop patio, have a drink and just relax. Good people watching too."}
{"text":"Remy's does a little bit of everything.

They have a bar area for drinks. Another small bar/dancefloor area. A dining room. And a rooftop patio that is pretty good in the summer.

They're kind of a \"jack of all trades, master of none\"

Remy's isn't really my 1st choice for anything, but they're a good backup for everything."}
{"text":"Very nice upstairs patio with an outdoor bar that is decorated with lights. There is table service although I first assumed there wouldn't be, as the atmosphere is very casual. 

Both servers I encountered were very helpful, bringing water and menus straight away and always checking on us without being bothersome. They suggested we get a cocktail pitcher rather than individual drinks so it would be more economical. We got a cocktail pitcher of mojitos. It was decent tasting and very large, not the best I've ever had but decent. 

The location of the bar is very nice, Yorkville is a great area. It is close to Bay station and a few other patio bars. Reasonably priced for the area too and clean bathroom.s I think it would be great for a sunny afternoon beverage or casual get together. I'm sure in better weather it would be packed out."}
{"text":"Remy's is in the middle of the Yorkville Village, close to tons of shopping (I had just come out of Anthropologie), parking, museums, etc...

If I lived in this part of Toronto, I think I'd be here quite a bit. Particularly for Sunday Brunch.

Woo! Gotta love Sunday Brunch (and mimosas)...,

But as tempting as Sunday Brunch is... I did not have it. Nor did I enjoy their Sunday Prix Fixe dinner for $35. But, trust... I will. I just happened to arrive too early for dinner, but too late in the afternoon to enjoy Brunch. 

I did have that mimosa though! =)

I ordered the Yorkville Salad: spinach, raspberries, mandarin oranges, green apples, goat cheese, walnuts, lemon grilled chicken, and vinegairette. Delicious! Filling. Savory. Sweet. Perfect for a cold Sunday afternoon. Probably great for the summer, too.

There were several other patrons in the restaurant. I sat near the front of the restaurant where there are low cushiony chairs, low tables, and candle-light. Great for lazing with a book, coffee, desserts. There's a bar area w/ TVs, and also a formal dining area away from the front door, drafts, and bar noise.

(The desserts look amazing, too.... I'll be back...)"}
{"text":"We came here for brunch on Sunday.

This place has a nice patio area and on a sunny day it is nice to have a brunch here. 

The food was average. I had omelette with asparagus and smoked salmon. I liked the idea but salmon was too dry and  omelette was just ok."}
{"text":"I ordered the Fish and Chips and while it was OK, it was not something I would write home about. So I will stop my food review there...

As for the environment, I've been waiting to finally write this review! The patio area is amazing! With a full bar, plenty of space, and music....Remy's is a great place to grab a drink and mingle. If you don't like loud, then don't bother. Otherwise, come on down for a huge selection of beers, order a brew, grab a seat, and start a convo/people-watch."}
{"text":"We've been to Remy's for birthdays, for cocktails in their lounge, and now for dinner on the rooftop patio. The food is decent (salads, tandoori chicken sandwich), the service is just fine and not expensive, the scene is good, and little white lights atop the trees that frame the roof set a festive mood. I look forward to many more rooftop patio nights at Remy's this summer, right in the heart of Yorkville."}
{"text":"This place is great for somebody like me.  The food is pretty good the place is large, they have excellent coffee, and they didn't mind me sitting in there a couple of hours reading with coffee before getting my meal.  I will definitely be returning here (probably to repeat that activity).  The service was excellent throughout;providing exactly the right amount of checking up and filling water etc.  It was too dark at time and I think it probably gets very noisy at times...and the bathrooms were inconvenient and small and a little sketchy.  But overall a great place."}
{"text":"WAY better than Remy's!!!!

Love the Miami Style look.  That's what it reminds me of.  Great seating, couches, pillows, etc.  Service was great!  We ordered appetizers with our drinks: Fish Tacos and Brisket Sliders both good. Fish Tacos could of had a bit more than 2 pieces as I tasted more of the salad than fish but the brisket sliders were DELICIOUS.  

Drinks were properly made :) You felt the Vodka and it wasn't watered down.  

Montage is Great!!!  Definitely going there for drinks and food again...and again...and again.."}
{"text":"Remy's is a great place to sit outside on the upstairs patio on a Saturday afternoon. They have a lot of good beers on tap, and though a bit pricey, the location offers top-notch people watching.

The food, while simply presented (and also a bit pricey) is solid, and the staff are friendly and prompt. The blackened chicken caesar salad is a good choice, as are the sliders.

One note about the sliders though - the menu says they come with \"swiss cheese, BBQ sauce and sauteed garlic and onions\". What that actually means is you get one slider with swiss cheese, one slider with BBQ sauce, etc. Not the biggest deal, but a bit of a misdirect."}
{"text":"Busy on a Friday night for dinner so we had to wait at the bar for a table. Servers and hostesses are friendly but the male bartender that served us was not and served a larger group before us even though we were there first. Service is pretty quick considering how busy it was. We were in a hurry so this was especially appreciated. We had to flag them down but our food came pretty quickly and so did the bill after we ordered/asked for them.

They have a nice rooftop patio.

Food and wine are expensive for what they are but it's Yorkville so I guess that makes sense. The Chardonnay I tried was not very good but the sauvignon blanc from New Zealand was delicious!

The Yorkville Salad had chicken on it. It was THE WORST salad I've had in a very long time. The chicken was overcooked, dry and hardly seasoned. There was hardly any dressing on it. It tasted pretty cheap, like everything was thrown together without a thought. The combination when read off the menu sounds delicious, similar to a salad they have at Milestones, but it's definitely not nearly as good. Terrible. I was going to send it back but we were in a hurry so I ate what I could. It's too bad because I wanted to eat something healthy but it ended up tasting bad. 

I would be reluctant to go here again but if I did I'd come for wine and some appetizers maybe, in hopes of a better food experience."}
{"text":"BEST SWEET POTATO FRIES EVER!

Context: Spent a great afternoon on the patio drinking beer and hanging with friends. 

Music: ranges from progressive house to alternative

Atmosphere: ideal for lazy Sundays or long lunches.

Grub: The cheeseburger was a bit gamey but the fries...oh man. Just the right amount of crispiness, warmth, sweet potato-ness and regular fry-ness. I am definitely going back for more!"}
{"text":"Huge patio in the heart of Yorkville (with the higher prices that come with that).  Their drink menu was large with something for everybody, and they had a pretty large food menu (we didn't try any food though).  Tables are more spread out than Hemmingways, with a more open patio and same clientele.

I wouldn't go here to get drunk, but going here for a drink or two and some food would work well."}
{"text":"Went there for a birthday party, a date and had a great time both times.
Love the food, the staff and the ambience. I would definitely love to go there again."}
{"text":"Honesty they should change their name to Remy's Bar or Lounge because their food terrible. We ordered 5 items from their menu. 

- Greek salad was no better than one of those Dole salad mix bags (except the lettuce had already wilted)
- Fried calamari was cold and greasy and came with a side of ketchup
- The fish in the fish and chips was also greasy and did not taste very fresh
- Enchilada was essentially a hot pocket and came with salsa courtesy of Tostitos 
- Remy's wrap was also nothing especial. 

I was basically completely disappointed with every aspect of the restaurant from the cheap wobbly plastic patio furniture to the food and service. I was so surprised to run into such a shabby place in Yorkville of all places. I can not imagine anyone wanting to return to Remy's for the food. They do have a full bar with variety of drinks if you are looking for a spot to drink."}
{"text":"We went to Remy's with a friend that was up here from Newport Beach. We ordered some standard Canadian Beers and some items to nibble on as we had a lot planned for the evening. 

Service, as always was very quick and very helpful. I always like the décor of this Restaurant and anytime I have a visitor from out of Town this is one of the first places I take them to before exploring other areas.

I think Yorkville is an area everyone should enjoy."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance, lots of sun and wind. Would be nice to just sit and have a beer.

Service was horrible, took 15 minutes every time we needed something for waitress to come, and she seemed distracted (smiling/staring into space) even when attending to us. Their penne arrabiata was tiny and the stated Italian sausage includes only a few grams of ground sausage. All sorts of hair (long and short) was found on the plates, cups and slice of lemon which was also disgusting. Just inspect your food carefully before eating."}
{"text":"As far as rooftop patio's goes, Remy's hits the mark. Even on a Monday night the crowd was lively and the ambiance definitely hit the mark. At times it felt like I was in Europe with shrubs and trees lining half of the patio and it's proximity to a few other bars just an ear shot away. 

All in all I'd say Remy's is a great spot to catch up with some friends or to head to for a drink after dinner at one of Yorkville's many restaurants. 

Of course, since Remy's is located in Yorkville you can expect to pay premium prices on drinks which will leave your wallet feeling significantly lighter as midnight approaches. There were a few Ferrari's and Masteri's on the street but none of them were mine, so the $7.50 bottle of beer and $13 apple martini means I'll have to walk instead of taking the TTC to work this week. 

The Good: The patio vibe in the summertime

The Bad: Drink Prices

The Ugly: My bank account"}
