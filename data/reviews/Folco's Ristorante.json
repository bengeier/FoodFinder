{"text":"The pastas are great. Service was warm and welcoming.  Chef has a real passion and it shows."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been to this restaurant three times.  Two of the times we went with the same couple.  It should be noted that one of the group is Italian and is always very critical when we eat at Italian restaurants.  I have eaten at my friend's house and tried their homemade italian food and it is amazing.  I'm merely stating this point so you can gauge the quality of Folco's.  My wife and I come from a food and beverage background as well (thankfully that shipped has sailed for the both of us...god bless any of you in the industry).  The staff are always friendly and honest about the menu.  When I say friendly, it's not an over-the-top friendly, it's a sincere friendly.  We have had their meatballs (Nonna would be jealous), calamari and other appetizers and they have not disappointed yet.  Their main dishes are well portioned and definitely have the authentic homemade Italian taste (veal, butternut squash ravioli). We have yet to try the Risotto which is made at the table.  Another nice touch is that two of the times, the Chef (owner) has visited the table and taken the time to ask how our experience was.  I would definitely recommend Folco's to anyone."}
{"text":"Decided to step out from the usual Montana type restaurants and try a more up market place,  tried Falco's with my wife had spaghetti and meatballs which was nice but nothing special she had the white fish with pasta. Food was ok and the food came slow even though only about 4 couples in there but service was good until I had to go ask to pay as server had disappeared talking. Then the bill with tip over 80 bucks.  Half that price  maybe would of let it go but 80?   So won't be repeating."}
{"text":"Sneaky Trick to Rip you off!
You get a menu with a partial list of food items. Then the waitress VERBALLY tells you to consider \"Today's Specials\". You assume that \"Today's Specials\" will be good value for your money. You are not told of the prices of \"Today's Specials\". You unassumingly order the specials, hoping you are getting a good deal. When you get your bill, you get a shock. The \"Today's Specials\" cost you 50% more that the menu items! Ouch! You explain your dilemma. You are told its your fault for assuming that \"Today's Specials\" are good value! Who Knew? You never return there! They apparently don't want repeat customers!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious but the service was really bad! I had the soup for appetizer & mussels & my husband had meatballs for appetizer & parmigiana chicken. The soup & meatballs was very delicious. The sauce with the mussels was very good but the mussels I found very small. The parmigiana chicken was ok nothing to come back for. 
There was a big delay between the appetizer & mains. We heard the 2 waitresses say something to each other about serving another table the parmigiana chicken to another table. This is fine, people make mistakes but let us know that there was mistake made & there would be a delay. 
Also when they served the mussels there was a bowl on top for the shells. The waitress didn't remove it for me & it was very hot to touch. Again no warning about the hot bowl. 
Too bad the service was bad otherwise I would return."}
{"text":"Walked in on a Tuesday night with a friend, and it took a bit of time to be seated, even though the restaurant only looked about half full.  In their defense though, the waitress did apologize every time she passed us and had to pick up yet another order for another table before she could get us to a table.

When we were finally seated though, the service was excellent.  The waitress (the same one) was very attentive, and stopped by several times to check up on us, and to make sure we had everything we wanted.  We didn't have any trouble flagging her down whenever we wanted something, and she usually got to our table before we started looking for her anyway.

The food itself was excellent.  We started with the meatballs, and then ordered the gnocchi and penne alla vodka for our mains.   I've been to quite a few restaurants where the ingredients listed in the menu promise a lot, yet fall short of flavour, but this restaurant, I'm happy to say, is not one of them.  The meatballs were very tender and flavourful, and came with a sauce that was oh so very good.  We ended up asking for more bread so that none of the sauce went to waste!  The penne was also quite good, and the gnocchi was one of the best I've had in quite a while.  You can definitely taste all the different ingredients melding together, and it was also spiced just right.  We finished it all off with a decadent chocolate fudge cake, which again, was simply delicious!

The restaurant itself had a casual, yet cozy atmosphere (it was decorated for Christmas, complete with fireplace), and was very conducive to good conversation.  It was the perfect place to catch up with a friend.

If you aren't in any particular rush, and want a nice family-run restaurant where you can sit down to good home-cooked food and simply enjoy the company of a small group of friends, this would be an ideal restaurant for that occasion."}
{"text":"We had dinner for two with orders of calamari and two pasta dishes.  

Acceptable food but overshadowed by the uncomfortable and non-hospitable service of this server.  It was just a weird experience.  

We were the second table their, so it was not busy.  Plus, it was before 6:00 pm when we arrived.  But she had the tone and eye contact of not wanting to serve you.  When she spoke to you, she would turn around before fully finishing her sentences without really looking at you.  It was a pretty bone chilling vibe she gave off.  Very weird.  

It's unfortunate.  We were there a few years ago and this young gentleman who served us was very friendly.  

My opinion is if you get served by this lady with this over-tanned, slightly wrinkled skin face, with big eyelashes, make an excuse to leave and try another restaurant instead."}
{"text":"Crispy calamari is not crispy; oily. Also the balsamic vinegar bread dip is missing the vinegar; it's all oil. No tiramisu anymore!

Pasta and lamb chop is good though."}
{"text":"Jan 11,2014
When I called the restaurant, I was absolutely delighted that the woman who answered the phone knew about dietary restrictions and how to accommodate them.  People pay lip service to the gluten free and dairy free crowd....this place actually steers you in the right direction... and we're not talking \"Oh, you can have a salad.\"
Dina, who I came to find out that evening, was not only the lady who answered my questions on the phone, but was also our server AND the chef!!  So, she gave me detailed list of ingredients in the meals I was looking at as well as how to accommodate me, too.  WOW!! If any of you follow a gluten and dairy free liftestyle, you can truly appreciate where I'm coming from and the \"jackpot\" that I felt I hit!!

This was my first time to Folco's and will not be my last.  Thank you, Dina, for a truly authentic and wonderful gastronomical experience!  The food, ambience and attention to customer needs exceeded my expectations."}
{"text":"I have only positive things to say about this restaurant, I have been multiple times and the food is AMAZING! I am in love with the home made pasta and I love that they always let me customize my sauce and ingredients.  I can also not say enough about the bruschetta ... its the best I've ever had.  I always recommend this place when going out with friends and my boyfriend and I went for valentines day even though I was hesitant to go to a restaurant on such a holiday because you are generally just rushed through your meal but not here , we had a wonderful meal and wonderful time at Folco's just like every time I have been."}
{"text":"Not what you'd expect to find in Markham, one visit to Folco's will forever raise your expectations for fine Italian food. All the pasta is made fresh daily in-house. The lasagna is especially delicate; a new favorite for sure."}
{"text":"Really wonderful food and wonderful service. Rich was put waiter and he was attentive, caring, and a perfect the complement to a delicious meal. I had the meatballs, lamb and then cheesecake for dessert. All perfect."}
{"text":"This is my favourite Italian restaurant !!! The food is excellent! The service is amazing and the ambiance is lovely. Very romantic by the window, or very festive for a bigger group. I have been there in all seasons to celebrate many special occasions, or just for a FANTASTIC meal. 
In the summer they have a lovely patio which I have enjoyed many times in the summer. 
I'm writing today Nov 23/16 because the excellent meal I had there last night. We were celebrating a special romantic occasion. The food was delicious and we ordered a couple of the specials as well as some items off the regular menu. All delicious!  
I know from experience that the chef also makes a special risotto on Friday and Saturdays which is the best I've ever had. If you want a very special treat, make sure you go on Friday or Saturday night. Reservations are recommended on weekends. 
I hope you enjoy this above average culinary experience as much as I do.  Can't wait until I go again!"}
{"text":"Folco we went there day after Valentine: we ordered the wild mushroom risotto and the chef actually infused the rice with the Parmesan cheese wheel in front of us. The smell was heavenly and it was worth the trip. The chicken special was also delicious. Service was attentive and warm. Not understand why we were seated near the TV while many other tables were empty. Oh well, hope this will change. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Very attractive restaurant with seating on the patio in the summer. The patio can very loud due to the busy traffic just a few feet away. Convenient parking right behind the building, on the street or in the RBC parking lot across the street.

The food is delicious! Best gnocchi I've ever had, light and fluffy pillows of taste.  Grilled Caesar salad is a treat. Pasta and lamb dishes are particularly good.  Accompanying wine list has some tasty selections.  Prices are high but quality of food makes it worthwhile.  Only caveat: service can sometimes be spotty. My absolute favourite dining experience in the Markham area."}
{"text":"A well-earned 4-star review! The restaurant was cozy and perfect for a date night (although the random photo of a baby on the wall eating a bowl of pasta was creepy and seemed rather out of place..) 

I ordered the squash goat cheese ravioli which was served with mushrooms and a buttery sage sauce. It was rich and delicious. My boyfriend ordered one of the specials - breaded chicken served with arugula salad and spaghetti (all pasta is made fresh, in house). The spaghetti came in a Parmesan basket - yes, this was basically a small bowl made entirely out of cheese. I stole a few bites of his pasta and it was delicious! 

Our service was a bit on the slow side at first, as it took quite a while before any bread was brought to our table, but our waitress was very pleasant. The chef was also wandering around asking about people's meals, which is always nice to see.

I'll be going back for sure! Make a reservation in advance as it gets pretty busy."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here on a random Tuesday. We got a seat no problem. The hostess was extremely welcoming and friendly. The place definitely had a \"home\" feeling.  We had the fried calamari to start - it was good but nothing to rave about. As our mains, my husband got the lasagna and I got the mushroom ravioli made in a truffle cream sauce. The lasagna was in a bolognese sauce that was cooked for over 8 hours. Both dishes were amazing! We would definitely come back to have those same dishes again. The waitress also mentioned that the restaurant has movie nights where they pair dishes based on the movie. What a great idea!  Overall, was a great experience, great food, great staff and look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"OMG- traditional Italian food.  This family run business serves up magic.  It's feels like your Getting food from a family run business with class but not stuffy in anyway.  My wife LOVES the pasta and I was super pleased with their gluten free options as I am celiac!  This is by far my wife's favourite Local Markham restaurant.  Try them out, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Get the pasta special - it's pasta tossed in this giant wheel of parmesan cheese!! Also had a glass of chianti - great service and great food."}
{"text":"what a delicious dinner here. reservations are highly recommended for a friday night though quite a few 2-top and our 4-top got seated with barely a wait slightly later in the evening.

pasta is made in-house and several items are boasted to be shipped straight from the mother boot. it's nice to see (taste!) that the vegetable bolognese, meat bolognese, and lasagna, which (on paper) appear to all have more or less the same sauce -- all turned out significantly different. 

FETTUCCINE VEGETABLE BOLOGNESE ($19) - wide variety of vegetables contribute to an acidic and vibrant sauce that has some excellent tang 

LASAGNA ($19) - soft sheets of pasta separated by meat sauce, which tastes more \"grounded\" than the vegetarian tomato sauce

TAGLIATELLE BOLOGNESE ($18) - each bite is so. satisfyingly. meaty. pasta wasn't as bouncy as i was hoping for.

WILD MUSHROOM RAVIOLI ($20) - in a cream sauce which tasted a tad sweet due to the natural sweetness of dairy; would have liked more even amounts of filling as some ravioli seemed a little empty but otherwise the filling was delicious and fragrant, but not overpowered by the white truffle 

as we wrapped up our evening, we got a peek at the vitello parmigiana maybe? pasta tossed with parmesan flambe'd straight in the wheel. how exciting! smelled good enough to have dinner round two -- though considering portion sizes here, would've put us straight into hibernation mode (mmm i'm ok with that)."}
{"text":"I am a local resident of Markham.  I enjoy local restaurants like Folco's, no need for me and the wife to travel long distances for a restaurant. 

Atmosphere is nice, no one rushes you out the door.

I had the Tagliatelle bolognese that night, excellent dish.  Fresh pasta and tasty meat sauce.  Service that night was also very good.

{"text":"Little house on Main Street Markham that is easily missed. I have been coming here for years and I am never disappointed. I have tried everything on the menu and my favourite is their spaghetti and meatballs. Noodle are al dente every time,  sauce is delicious and made fresh everyday. Meatballs are perfect size, taste and texture. Portions are great for the price. My daughter lights up every time I say let's go eat at Folco's. If you live in Markham and have yet to give the place a try, you truly have been missing out on a gem of a place.  Service is great,  small little place but plenty of servers around. The chef/owner goes to every table at dinner for a meet and greet, lost art of customer experience in my opinion."}
{"text":"It's the best Italian restaurant I've tried in Markham. I'd give it 4.5 stars if I could, but I can't and the last person gave a 5-star review.
The food here ranges from pretty good to amazing. The menu changes seasonally. Dishes cost on average $20-25 for a main course, but there are some costlier and cheaper ones. The pasta is fresh-made, and I usually end up ordering some kind of pasta. Vodka penne is great, and a special I tried once -- some kind of wild mushroom ravioli -- was incredible. I've had some nice fish there as well.

Atmosphere is fairly nice. It's an old house, lots of wood. Not very modern, nothing too fancy, but nice and warm. Sometimes they have live music, which I would rather do without. 

Al Dente, another Italian place, is across the street. Folco's is far superior unless you need to rent a large space for a reception or something."}
{"text":"Cozy, rustic Italian restaurant just north of Hwy 7/Markham! 

I love this place, service was good, we got free bread (that's always a good sign am I right?!), and we tried the butternut-squash ravioli --- which was sweeter than other butternut-squash ravioli I've tried and pretty good fettucine.

I had mushrooms added to my fettuccine and it was sublime. Probably one of the top fettuccine alfredo dishes I've tried thus far. Was it fattening? Heck yea, but trust me it was so worth it. 

The table beside us had that dish where they cook the pasta in that big ol cheese wheel and they seemed to love it! I'm totally trying that next time although it is a bit pricier.

Perfect place to take your parents and loved ones
out. It's charming, rustic and has plenty of options for everyone."}
{"text":"Best Italian food in Markham.  The staff and chef are so welcoming.  The food makes you crave wanting to go back for more servings. The ambiance is very intimate.  Highly recommend, especially the house special risotto."}
{"text":"Came here with my girls last week on a very cold night. Didn't realize there was parking behind the restaurant but just parked in the huge lot across the street. The place inside is very cozy and romantic. It does smell very high of Italian cheeses but hey it's an Italian restaurant. It was an ok experience. They gave bread to start with butter and olive oil. I got the fettuccine Alfredo and they asked if I wanted chicken on top which cost 6 bucks. Thought that was a bit pricy nor did they tell me the price until I paid. It tasted fine but nothing life changing and the chicken wasn't seasoned on top. My girl got the lamb special and it was good. They didn't tell her the price until after her bill and it was almost 40 bucks. Definitely didn't think it was worth that much. Overall it was a fine experience and it's always nice to be in main street markham but won't be returning."}
{"text":"If you like wine and Italian food, this is a great place to go! A small little house tucked away on Main Street Markham, it has been remodeled a little to be a great Italian restaurant.

We decided to sit on the patio and it was a great environment, facing the street. The patio itself was little small, with space for only 4-5 tables, but it was enough. Plus, the fake grass they put down was a nice touch!

The food was quite good, with everything made fresh in house. Started with the Escargot, and it was absolutely delicious, just make sure you use the house bread to your advantage there. I went for the Tagliatelle Bolognese, and it was quite good. A bit heavy of the meat sauce though (as there wasn't enough pasta to go with it). Not a wide variety on the drinks menu, as it is only wine, but a great selection if that is what you're looking for.

Service was quite good, as they checked up on us frequently. Always had 1-2 dedicated staff for just the patio!

Great overall, and would definitely visit again if I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"This is best Italian the in town!! The service is amazing and the is food excellent!! Good size portions."}
{"text":"Just had dinner here the other night after this restaurant was recommended by my friends.

Restaurant is literally a house that converted into a restaurant which is more or less like all the restaurants in Main Street Markham. Perfect place for a date. 

Walked in and was immediately sat down and given the water, server gave us some time with the menu and also mentioned the specials for the night. After our order was taken our apps came shortly after as well as some table beard which was pretty good just wish it was warm. 

Mussels: we enjoyed these but the mussels did not soak in the flavour of the sauce too well but still tasty. 

Caesar salad: well-dressed and tossed nicely, with the fresh black pepper the flavours really popped. 

After finished our apps we waited for our mains... and waited .. and waited. It was maybe half a hour or a bit less before we got our mains and to also add it wasn't too busy either. Wasn't too pleased to see other tables receive their mains promptly after their apps. 

We opted for one of the specials which was the wild mushroom ravioli with a rack of lamb. The lamb went well with the ravioli and was cooked to our liking (med rare). Was not gamey or tough whatsoever.

We also got the other ravioli on the menu which had veal in it, i did not enjoy this one as much as the wild mushroom but it was still good, I'm not sure how to explain it but it tasted a little .. dated or overcooked? 

Service was good but a little inattentive which I understand as there was only two servers in the entire restaurant. Water was never refilled and it took a bit before they noticed I was flagging them down for the bill. Nonetheless friendly and helpful when needed. 

I definitely see why my friend recommend Folco's as I will also to people who are interested! Definitely coming back when the time is right!"}
{"text":"Wednesday night 8pm - restaurant was busy; luckily I made reservations. 

Service seems to be lacking - perhaps understaffed.  I can see the effort is there though.  

The spoon was a bit dirty - had to request a new one; literally had to yell to get anyone's attention.  

They ran out of the dish I wanted (lasagna and then the mushroom raviolli)

Had to ask for bread after 45 minutes since arrival (It didn't come with any olive oil, just butter)

Pasta was very good though.

Perhaps I had high expectations from the reviews, but it didn't meet expectations to be a \"classy\" restaurant"}
{"text":"Probably one of the best Italian foods I have ever tasted by a family owned business. 

Besides Alice Fazoolis, Folco's Ristorante is another that serves warm bread with olive dip instead of butter. That's already an additional half star, to serve warm bread with non butter dip.

We love getting their mussels as an appetizer to share. I recommend any pasta here because their tomato juice is \"on point\". All of the mussles are slowly cooked and opened perfectly and are gracefully covered with appealing tomato sauce with herbs. The pasta, well, it's pasta, but it's delicious because of the homemade sauce.

In the summertime, ask to sit on the patio if there's no construction, it really adds to the feel of dining at a restaurant in Main Street!"}
{"text":"The most divine Italian food I have tasted. They sometimes feature this incredible mushroom risotto that they cook in the parmigiana reggiano wheel and it is a knockout. Other favourites are the penne alla vodka, caprese salad, butternut squash ravioli. All very hearty and satisfying. They also have a tomato basil salad that comes in a parmesan crisp bowl. The tiramisu is outstanding. It's a nice cozy restaurant and they have a small patio outside. I adore this restaurant and everything we've eaten has been outstanding. The service is nice too - friendly but not too in your face."}
{"text":"This restaurant is local to me.  I had been a few times, many years ago but hadn't been back until this past week.  See, my husband doesn't like pasta (what???), so he always dismisses this option.

I visited on a Tuesday evening with my mother, who does like pasta.  Certainly there are other options on the menu, but IMO, the real draw to Folco's is the pasta.  Hand made in house and dressed with simple and tasty ingredients.

We ordered bruschetta and meatballs to start.  The bruschetta is nothing to write home about: good but not mind-blowing.  The meatballs were delicious and the sauce was excellent.  One complaint was that the sauce was cold within a minute or two.  Would have been better if the sauce was piping hot and the plate warmed.  

My mom ordered the panko tilapia feature, which was served with spaghetti aglio e olio.  She found it delicious.  I ordered the fettucini alfredo which was INSANELY good.  The pasta was just so perfect and the sauce was decadent and smooth.  No curdling and it had plenty of flavour.

All in all, I would like to return again soon.  The service was friendly, the space is quaint, I definitely recommend.  Markham really only has a few gems, and this is indeed one of them."}
{"text":"We've loved this place and give a few times..  Once we went late at night.. They had closed the kitchen but we got a warm welcome and the owner quickly cooked up some amazing veggie dishes for us.. 
He also does the risotto in the Parmesan bowl on Fridays! Lovely ambience, great for kids or no kids. 
The staff is friendly and welcoming and very accommodating with regards to dietary restrictions."}
{"text":"After hearing so many people in the area raving about Folco's I finally decided to try it out. And we were looking for a reception spot for a Baptism - which we let them know when we walked in.  I was disappointed about the food. The veal parmigiana was sub-par. Too much sauce, very dry meat which was overcooked. My husband tried a pasta dish which was \"ok\" we were told pasta was made fresh in house. The drenching of sauce on the pasta killed any taste I was hoping to get out of it. The caesar salad was good & so was the bruschetta. Their tomato sauce - homemade I was told - tastes like something out of a jar. I was hugely disappointed and felt their food tasted no different than the Italian restaurant across the street. I was hoping to go back & try out their pizzas, but there is a much better Italian restaurant in the Garden Basket Plaza that makes everything from scratch and I have been a regular of theirs since they opened."}
{"text":"If you have not been here, get here. The food is spectacular, the Pasta made table side was delicious, fresh and full of flavor. intimate but not quite. I had the Veal Piccata melt in your mouth served with a tasty Aoli angel hair. Good wine list and lots of street parking. $$$."}
{"text":"folco's is in a little house, super cute and cozy! we started with the lightly batted calamari, it was good. i ordered the penne alla vodka, which was very delicious. the pasta was a little soft but i didn't mind. the sauce was great,  perfect balance of san marzano tomato sauce and cream. my friend got the wild mushroom ravioli with white truffle topped with crispy prosciutto, it was divine. definitely will be coming back to try the rest of the menu, saw the veal at another table and i almost asked for a bite! we ended with the tiramisu, which i found was slightly over powered by the mascarpone, not enough rum (that's just me, i have high standards for tiramisu). 

the service wasn't exacly spectacular or good ... they only had 3 servers for the few tables that fit in the house. they just weren't able to be available when needed nor were they attentive - but they were nice. regardless, i do plan on returning to try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"Came here with some friends for a dinner and honestly don't know if they were having an off night but the quality of service was mediocre at best. Let me explain.

We were seated promptly at around 8:30pm because of a reservation but at a table of 10 we weren't ever given menus? So that's fine, it's busy so we use our phones to check the menu on the website. 

Then we're left alone for about 15 minutes with no sign of the waitress. She comes back around and is lukewarm, we order at this point and are given waters. Another 20 minutes later we are told they ran out of bread after asking. Cut to another 15 minutes and we get bread. 

It's good but keep in mind we've sat for about an hour now for some bread and waters.

The food comes a good long while later, we eat and my lasagne is alright, kind of salty but definitely nothing to complain about. The waitress has probably made a total of 3, maybe 4 appearances in 2 hours and given a total of maybe 2 smiles and spoken about 6 sentences to us. Ok, it's a long night, we get it. We ended up getting 20% off our meal after speaking to someone, who in their defense was very nice. By the time we left, it was almost 11pm.

Great place to go to if you enjoy waiting.

The thing is, if you're going to staple a mandatory 18% gratuity on our bill (understandable because we were a large table and we would have gone 20% or more if we'd been treated well tbh), I kind of expect to at least get menus for the table instead of having to wait an hour just for bread. 

In fact, we got better service at the Mcdonald's we went to after. No joke."}
{"text":"I'm a foodie from the west coast and went to Folco's while back visiting family in Markham. I had one of the best meals I have had in years! The pasta is homemade and I would definitely recommend the cheese wheel entree where they light a parmesan cheese wheel on fire and mix the pasta right there at your table. We had a beef tenderloin that was so tender you could cut it with a butter knife. I wish I was staying longer so I could go again before I leave. But it will be at the top of my list for the next visit! Our server Angie was awesome and hopefully we will get her again on our next visit. If you haven't been...don't wait!"}
{"text":"While we entered the restaurant, we immediately received a warm welcome from the waitress.  The restaurant is romantic for couples, also provide a warm family setting.  We ordered escargot and salad to start, and pasta for main courses.  The pasta is good, but would be better if it has a little bit more seasoning!  Just a little bit lack of flavour for the seafood pasta tomato sauce.  Overall it is good and recommend to give a visit."}
{"text":"I've been to Folco's many a times and I'm surprised I haven't written a review yet.  Service has always been very good and we've had tons of servers in the past.  Their pastas are also to die for.  

My favourite pasta is the penne a la vodka (yes, I know it's not real Italian cuisine) but it is SO delicious.  They have strips of prosciutto and the best parmesan to accompany the sauce and fresh pasta.  Word has it that their pasta is imported from Italy.  Their salmon dish is also quite good.  What also blew my mind was the delicious parmesan wheel they have to make your pasta in.  I believe they only do that on weekends.  

They always start you off with some nice warm bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar (or butter).  

Salads are okay but nothing special.  Tiramisu was quite delicious too."}
{"text":"TLDR: Food was average, Service was abysmal. 

Saturday night, party of 10. Yes, my expectations for service for such a huge group is set quite low, I sympathize with servers that have to deal with such big table and yet I was completely let down and disappointed by Folco's that night. 

Reservations were made and we were seated the moment we arrived, left alone for 15 minutes, no menus. Asked for menus when someone finally came to our table and another 10 minutes passed before we got them (by that time we had decided on what to order based on the menu online via our phones and the one menu that was left at the table when we were seated). 

Food was late, when asked about the wait times, we were told very coldy that it would be another 15 minutes (ended up being about 30-40) and that they were out of bread (that came about 15 minutes after our inquiry). I'll say that the bolognese I ordered was good, but nothing impressive and to be honest, i've had better and cheaper at other Italian restaurants. 

The entire night, I watched the tables around us get tended to with baskets of bread, refills on water, and even heard apologies from the staff about the long wait for food as the kitchen was very busy. We did not get any of the same courtesies, instead our inquires were met with cold responses and defensiveness (it's standard to wait that long, our pasta is fresh made, etc. etc.). 

Food arrived and was slapped onto the table loudly by some of the servers, I'm going to sympathize here and say the plates were quite heavy but it was loud enough for me to notice it at a loud and busy restaurant. Requests for parmesan was met with a quip of \"it's already on it's way\" so fast that they did not even hear our thank yous before they had walked away. The quickest and most prompt service we got was the clearing of our plates. 

At the end of the night the bill came with service charge already included (understandable as we were a big group), but it felt real unreasonable that we were paying a mandatory 18% service charge for the cold, microagressive responses we were given. We were met with defensiveness when questioning the service and explaining to them that we honestly did not think it was fair given the service we were given, we were told that the service charge was written on the menu as a policy for large groups (well, guess they should have given us menus) and that we had to understand that their pasta is homemade and authentic. The server ended up calling their manager to discuss our concerns after our insistence and a 20% discount was given. I have to say the lines that the manager fed through our server were quite impressive and they were quite apologetic that our experience at the restaurant was so disappointing, and I have to give kudos to the waitress for keeping a smile on her face the entire time. I really would have been alright with that, but the waitress tried to defend the restaurant again and that really dampened the sincerity of their apology and felt like they were just trying to cover their bases and get us the hell out of there. 

Overall (hey if you're still reading this review, congrats!), I was extremely put off by their defensiveness, my friend who spoke on behalf of our group was very polite and understanding (probably a lot more than I would have been to be honest) and we were met with hostility, defensiveness and an overall condescending tone. If not for our insistence at speaking with a manager, I would have ended up paying more than what really was given in our circumstances. 

There are better restaurants on main street and even more amazing Italian restaurants around the rest of the GTA. Save your money for a friendlier neighbourhood restaurant."}
{"text":"We decided to come here for our anniversary dinner.  I had not made a reservation and was lucky enough that there was one table available.  Next time I will make a reservation.  The waitress was friendly and took time to tell us of the specials.  My wife ordered the veal parmigiana and I ordered the braised boar on pasta.  While waiting for our food we got bread with a great olive oil dipping.  The wait time for our food was reasonable.  My wife said her veal parmagiana was delicious and my braised boar was so tender.  We had tartufo and tiramisu for desert and they were both excellent.  It was a nice evening in a nice atmosphere.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"My group of four tried this restaurant for Savour York Region in late winter 2013.  From the outside, this restaurant seemed warm, inviting and cozy to me. Upon entering, we were greeted by friendly, accomodating wait staff.  The restaurant ambiance brought me back to the old-world feel of bed-and-breakfast I enjoyed at Niagara-on-the-Lake.  The evening time would be great for couples.  

All of us ordered different appetizers, entrees and desserts to experience the variety and craftmanship of the food.  For the Savour York Region package, I am content to give the food a 3.75 out of 5.  A unique experience for us was the chef cooking a mushroom risotto in a big parmesan cheese wheel in front of our table.   The aroma was quite intoxicating that it would be wrong not to try this dish once.  

Our group is not an expert in Italian cuisine but we agreed we would return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Italian restaurants in Markham. 

For those of you that do not want to travel downtown, Folco's on Main Street Markham is a great alternative. Great place for date night. But be warned, they do get quite busy. A reservation would be smart.

I always start off with an order of Bruschetta, to share. All pasta is homemade. Look out for their special: Pasta that is cooked in a wheel of cheese beside your table. Quite a show!"}
{"text":"Nice Family restaurant, long wait time for food but really delicious. Appetizers doesn't stand out much, but definitely order pastas."}
{"text":"I went here with my family and it was a very good experience. It's a dimly lit, Italian restaurant with some of the best service I've seen, and it feels like a pretty high-end restaurant when you come in, but it's not super formal that everybody has to dress up - but it wouldn't be surprising if you did.

Not many people when we went so service was very good, and it was pretty quiet. I ordered the seafood linguine which was made almost perfectly, the linguine was cooked just right and everything else complemented the pasta and sauces pretty well. Everybody else seemed to enjoy their food as well, so no complaints there!

We had a great time, and I think this is an underrated restaurant."}
{"text":"Some of the best pasta I've had, hands down! Folco's is near the centre of Markham Main Street, in a charming converted house. Four of us came late Friday night, and the place was still jammed. It was easy to see why once we tasted the food! 

We each got a different pasta dish, including the pasta special. On Fridays and Saturdays they serve a pasta special that is finished tableside in a huge parmesan wheel. If you love cheese you have to try this! The pasta is cooked in the kitchen, and then brought out alongside the cheese wheel. The cheese is flambéed to melt the parmesan, and the pasta mixed in the wheel and served tableside. It smelled and tasted absolutely delicious. 

We also had veal ravioli, tagliatelle bolognese, and gnocchi. All were great, though the gnocchi was firmer than I'm used to having.

I'm definitely looking forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I visited for the first time.... We were not disappointed !!  All of the food, from the appetizers to the desserts were excellent !  Would highly recommend"}
{"text":"Came here on the weekend with my boyfriend to try the cheese wheel pasta! I've had it in NYC but first time trying it in here in Toronto. I believe this might be the only place that serves it in Markham.

Meatballs ($12)
Came with 4 meatballs. The waitress hyped up the meatballs so we decided to give it a try. Gotta admit it tasted pretty good.

Prosciutto Parmigiano Pasta
Apparently this location makes fresh pasta every day. Although from the picture it looks like there wasn't a lot of cheese sauce mixed with the pasta, the pasta was pretty cheesy and creamy. The prosciutto really brought out more flavor to the pasta which was good. 

My boyfriend ordered their daily special steak for his main. This was disappointing, especially considering it was $40! Not sure if it was because we came here after visiting Jacobs not too long ago, but regardless the steak was nothing special and overpriced. 

The food was good, decent italian restaurant uptown."}
{"text":"Anniversary dinner. Excellent food!! Fresh and exquisite meal. Excellent service, all their suggestions were 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"3.5 Star

This review is based on Savour York Region Winter 2013's experience. For $15 it is well worth it for a 3 course lunch.

Service was a little slow to start with just 1 other table which seemed to be regulars for a late lunch. 

Mista Salad - plentiful and fresh but the Folco's House Dressing was a little too sour to my liking

Veal Parmigiana - Veal was really tender and moist! I love the light crispy breading too! The tomato sauce was nice but just a little too much and I have to scrap it off. Penne was cooked perfectly al dente!

Dessert.  - Sadly Pumpkin Spice Creme Burlee was not available and a substitution was offered. I was a little disappointed...

Folco's is worth your visit if you looking for more classic Italian dishes. I definitely would be back again for some Italian Comfort food... I love Pasta!"}
{"text":"I was very pleasantly impressed. I have never been here before, I always walk by but I didn't know anything about this place so I just kept on walking. I came in when someone suggested it and the food was absolutely amazing!  
We ordered bruschetta as an appetizer which as absolutely fantastic and huge! Defiantly enough for two people to share. For the main I got a mushroom ravioli which was also sooo good! For desert we got the tiramisu which was good and great for sharing.  
Our server was also really nice and attentive! 
I would definitely recommend this place as a nice date spot and night out, but save up because it's not that cheap."}
