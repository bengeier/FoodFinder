{"text":"This is one of the best places to eat in Pittsburgh.  The people are so nice and the food is cooked perfectly.  The breakfast is the best I've had in a long while.  It's a small hole in the wall but you have to try it.  Seriously, nicest people in a food place I've ever dealt with.  Thanks for a great experience and great food."}
{"text":"Stopped in today on a whim, as I've passed it many times. The staff was slow and disoriented it was 12:15 during the lunch rush and there were only a handful of people in there. Ordered a Spicy Chicken sandwich with Wedges and Slaw. The slaw was horrible too much vinegar I couldn't eat more than two bites. The chicken only covered half of my bun and it wasn't great either, I took it off the bun to eat it by itself to even taste it. The only thing good was the wedges. But not happy I spent $7 to basically get one spicy chicken strip and 3 potato wedges. Won't be going back. I see why they don't have much business."}
{"text":"Because of cold weather out, my buddies at work decided to go somewhere close. 

Pittsburgh Poultry definitely covers the friendly customer service aspect. You are greeted when you walk in and if you want to substitute anything on the menu for something else they oblige! 

I got the White meat 2 piece meal with potato wedges. I got the breast and wing, with an extra wing. The wings were ok in size, but the breading and flavoring on both the breast and wings were good. Chicken was cooked properly and wasn't overcooked and dry. Sauces for dipping are all free which is nice. 

My only complaint is the lack of sides. I do not like coleslaw or baked beans, so i was stuck with only the potato wedges which had a nice flavor as well! 

Prices are reasonable and not out of this world, which is good for someone working downtown trying not to spend a lot. The dine-in area is also kept clean from what I saw!

As Previously mentioned in another Yelpers review, since George Aikens closed there has not been a fried chicken to compare. Until now"}
{"text":"Went by today and the door is chained shut. Signs placed on the windows that say \"Closed.\" Windows were all covered with paper. Google shows it as \"Permanently Closed.\" I'm seriously disappointed they didn't make it."}
{"text":"Customer service was great. One of the workers kindly explained the menu. They specialize in chicken but it tasted like any other place that sells chicken. There was very little flavor on the skin but the meat was moist. Free sauces (although the bbq sauce is not the best) and side substitutions. Overall, it was a decent experience."}
{"text":"Drumstick roll here....  I've got something to cluck about. I was pecking around town and noticed that the burger joint that used to be on Cherry Way is now a fried chicken place.  What a welcome addition to the downtown lunch (and breakfast) scene.  The sign out front boast that they've got the \"Best Chicken in the Burg!!\"  Now I don't want to ruffle any feathers here but let's get real; ever since George Aiken closed up shop there hasn't been any chicken in the Burgh. That sign should read \"The Only Chicken in the Burgh\"; and it's some really good chicken too!

I stopped in for lunch today and got a four piece meal which is supposed to include half a chicken, potato wedges and slaw. I'm not complaining but I got two breast instead of a breast and a thigh. The chicken was deep fried, super moist with a tasty, slightly peppery coating. The breast were huge but the drumstick and wing was average in size. Still though, it was more food than I could eat. On the menu you get a choice of a two piece meal or a four piece meal. I thought a two piece would be too small so I went with the four piece meal. I wish they had a three piece meal; but it's nice that you can go a la carte and get exactly what you want. In addition to fried chicken meals, they also have chicken tenders, chicken sandwiches, fish sandwiches and a breakfast sandwich.  

The facility itself is geared more towards take out than dining in. There is a counter along the window with, count them, seven stools where you could enjoy your lunch. There's also two tables with five chairs available for those that insist on dining in. 

So hey, don't stay cooped up in your office for lunch. If you can wing it, go ahead and get yourself some lunch or breakfast at the Pittsburgh Poultry Company.  Then maybe you too will have something to crow about."}
