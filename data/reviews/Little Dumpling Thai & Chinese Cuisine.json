{"text":"Checked into hotel & didn't feel like going to a restaurant w/3 kids cooped up in a car all day so we ordered delivery. The food was good & the portion size was HUGE! I had beef fried rice & it was fresh. The kids shared orange chicken & that was very good too. If I come back through Boulder City, I will order from them again!"}
{"text":"This place is closed for quite a few months. A new \"Asian Fusion\" place is supposed to open at this location soon...word has it in town."}
{"text":"My husband and I have eaten at this restaurant almost weekly since it opened, and we love it. I stick to beef and broccoli, but my husband has tried almost everything on the menu. The pot stickers, are so good, and we liked most of the dishes. The soups and interesting and tasty. The waiter is always so attentive, always asking if we need anythng, etc. The restaurant is clean, and the price is very reasonable. All the food is fresh, and prepared just for us."}
{"text":"Ordered garlic chicken and it was nowhere close to what they had shown in a picture in their menu. To add to that they added 15% gratuity for serving 2 persons !"}
{"text":"We had hopes for this place when it re-opened, but it didn't really change much. Skip it. Mediocre Chinese and bad Thai. Keep driving if you want Asian food, nothing in Boulder City. We need a good Thai place!!!"}
{"text":"We discovered this  place after camping at az hot springs, we were too hungry to drive an hour to kingman, so we drove 20 miles or so out of the way and found this place. The food was delightful. Won ton soup was excellent. My panang was actually spicy. My husband got their special which was a beef dish- also very good. Would definitely go here again if we were in the area."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Very charming and the food was great. I had won ton soup and cashew crispy chicken. They were both great!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the better restaurants in Boulder City.  Comfortable, well-decorated interior and very reasonably priced.  Highly recommend the Kung Pao chicken and Tom Yum shrimp special.  If you like spicy, ask for the \"secret\" hot sauce ;)."}
{"text":"Good food, good prices. The kung pow chicken was great"}
{"text":"Finally a nice Thai food place in beautiful Boulder City, NV. Lettuce wraps were crisp and full of flavor. Ginger Chicken, Beef with Broccoli, and their super hot Curry Chicken were spot on. The Dining experience was a pleasure. The service was expeditious. I did not particularly like the peanut sauce as their house salad dressing but that was just me, otherwise this a pleasant surprise in a small town not known for this kind of food."}
{"text":"Little Dumpling changed a little bit since my last visit. They still offer fresh, quick, hot very low priced entrees that include a cup of soup mostly priced at $5.50. They dropped the side salad and the short menu and the scoop of rice is no longer heart shaped.  I enjoyed the ginger chicken last time so I decided to try it again. The white meat chicken was still very moist and nicely prepared but they weren't spot on with the sauce this time as most of it lacked the ginger and was too heavy with soy sauce.  I tried a bite of the basil chicken. It was very tasty and good but not what I know as basil chicken. It was a different formula that wasn't as balanced as I like it with the garlic  chilies and fresh basil. It seemed heavy with shrimp paste instead of fish sauce but it still tasted good.  I would still keep them on my rotation. Not the best but much better than a lot of places."}
{"text":"Nothing to exciting here. Food was ok. We were driving to Vegas and were in need of food. Stopped by to find the place empty. The waiter was very concerned that our children may spill our drinks or break a plate. Overall I would recommend to keep driving to Vegas to get some Asian."}
{"text":"No way.  Just got back from the restaurant with my take out order of Pad See Oew.  It is supposed to be a wide-noodle dish with a tasty oyster-flavored sauce.  What I got was mushy wide-noodles, off-smelling sliced beef (nauseating smell),  barely any sauce, and sliced vegetables.  The only 'seasoning' came from the smell and flavor from the gross sliced meat (spoiled?).  The best part of the dish was the carrots, broccoli, and bamboo shoots.  I ate about 1/4 cup of noodles and the veggies doused with soy sauce packets to keep it down.  Gagged on the meat.  I ended up throwing out 3/4 of the dish.  What a waste.  I should of burned my $8 with a torch-at least that would have been more enjoyable. 1 star simply because the interior of the restaurant is pleasant.  Too bad for Boulder City if this is the only \"authentic\" Chinese/Thai place.  Best to drive out to Henderson or go to the asian restaurants in Northwest LV."}
{"text":"If there was an option for no stars I would choose it. The entire place smells like sewer gas.  The owner was aware of the ongoing smell but apparently didn't really care about it when I spoke to him."}
{"text":"This place is ok. I am a Thai food fan and my husband hates the stuff, so when I am REALLY craving some panang and it's the two of us for dinner, we come here because it does in a pinch for me and there's a good selection of Chinese dishes for him. Plus, we don't have to go all the way into Vegas or Henderson. It works."}
{"text":"Have tried several times to call for take out and they refuse to answer their phones. They lost a lot of loyal customers this week. At least 6 of us order out for lunch everyday and we will never go here again. Very poor customer service! You think they'd be jumping at the chance to make a buck since 4 other restaurants in Boudler City have gone out of business in the last 4 months."}
