{"text":"I actually really liked China Olive the first few times I went there, even if it was a little inconsistent and sometimes it was very fresh and other times not so much.  I live close by so it's an easy stop when doing the shopping for the week.  So the Mrs and I decided to go after a trip to Wally.  We went the other day and it was right when it switched to dinner and there was many many empty trays of food, which was very disappointing.  They eventually did fill some trays but not all.  We waited and waited and waited some more for them to fill the dessert trays but it never happened so we got frustrated and went to pay and mention it to the hostess.  So we get up there and find out that after we came in that the health department came and shut them down while we were in there so that's why there was no dessert.  The violation was something about food, I think it was pertaining to storage and preparing and it said right on the violation that they had been warned before.  So I guess the claims of people getting food poisoning are true and we were just lucky.  The worst offense to me was that they charged us the full price over 10 bucks a person even though we didn't get to really eat very much!  Not only that, I'm confused why the health department didn't come into the eating area and tell everyone.     So in a nutshell... eat at your own risk!   They lost me.. I'm not a freeloader and I will gladly pay for my meals but if you aren't gonna refill the food or give me dessert than don't charge me the full price!"}
{"text":"Gross.  The plates were pretty gross. It seems like they just wipe off the top of the plates before they put them back. The bottom of the plates seemed dirty. Why do the bottom of the plates matter? Think about this: when the plates are stacked, what are the eating surfaces of the plates in contact with?  The food was very disappointing.  I didn't get sick, though. That's always nice."}
{"text":"This was the most disgusting place I have ever been to, I am so seriously surprised that the health department is allowing this place to stay open, I found an unidentified object in my soup, this place was so nasty, the windows you cannot see out of from the filth, the food is GROSSSSSSSS. This is just a depressing environment, not a place to waste 10.00 on a meal."}
{"text":"Never actually ate in there but we ordered some dishes once and they were disappointing. We ordered some shrimp chow mein and some beef dish and both dishes were filled with filler. The shrimp dish had those little shrimp that you usually find in fried rice and the rest of the dish was all basically frozen vegetables. Everything seemed like it came out of the cheapest bulk bag of product they could find at Costco. I don't know about the buffet but nothing I ate made me want to go back. The place has been open for at least 7-8 years by now so it must be doing something right. Maybe the buffet is rather cheap and has a good selection but the food I got from them was nothing I would want more of. The Chinese food in the Boulder and Sam's Town buffets down the street are much better than what I had here and I'm pretty sure there's better Chinese food in the surrounding area. There always seems to be families going here or parties of 5 or more so it probably priced cheap enough for a family to come in and look the other way when it comes to taste."}
{"text":"I really feel like this should be 2 star review. But I'm not giving it 2 stars. I've voluntarily gone here so many times that giving it a 2 star review would make me the fat kid who keeps touching the stove, despite continually getting burned. And I am NOT that fat kid. So back off.  I am, however, the fat girl who happens to live nearby the China Olive. And sometimes I get really, really hungry. So hungry, in fact, that in my deluded, nutrient-deprived mind, the only thing that will be able to adequately satiate me would be eating plate after plate of mediocre Chinese food until I either pass out in a food coma, or they close the place for the night.  There is NO WAY just one plate of food will do. That is what my hunger tells me. And I listen to my hunger.   However, once I get seated, and have my first egg roll (which are okay) and hot and sour soup (pretty good), I realize that my hunger is fading, and I still have 4 buffet rows of mediocre chinese (and italian, and cajun, and mexican) food to eat. That's when I start to get pissed at my hunger. Because I could have spent the same amount of money elsewhere (about $10 for dinner) and it would have been just as filling and much more enjoyable than the 4 rows of \"meh\" I'm working with here.  In all fairness, the food isn't that bad. It's just not that good. Their water, however, is fan-freaking-tastic."}
{"text":"Don't go, not worth the money. Closed multiple times by health department.  The owners can't seem to figure it out."}
{"text":"Closed without  any explanation."}
{"text":"I have hear that this place was REALLY bad.   But I tried it anyway.   They just added a mongolian grill. You know. Where you pick your veggies and spices then choice the meat you would like.   That wasn't bad at all.   the rest of the buffet was kinda questionable. But the grill I had was good."}
{"text":"I wish I'd consulted yelp. I came here this past week, after not eating for an entire day.   I was super pissed my friend insisted on finishing his crappy $10ish meal, while I sat there sipping on sprite and trying to forget the horrifying food I'd just sampled.  \"Do NOT go in there! Whoo!\""}
{"text":"Warning Danger DO NOT ENTER! Gross! This place is nasty! If I could give it less than a star yea I would have.   While out running errands over the weekend I decided to be adventurous, & try a new place I had never tried. So I find myself driving down Indian School rd and see the Chinese buffet sign. I thought great because I was not sure what I wanted and with a buffet there are so many choices right? WRONG!   The choices were not many and the food was not good. The rice tasted like dirt. I had some mushrooms that were good. Everything was labeled wrong. They had fried chicken wings the size of my pinky. If these came off a chicken it must have been a chick. The egg foo young looked like scrambled eggs with mushrooms. This place is gross. We took one bite of everything on our plates and when nothing tasted good we left!   We told them your buffet is garbage and we left. BTW we did not pay for it either."}
{"text":"China Olive is not in business at this location anymore. Another Chinese buffet has taken over the building."}
{"text":"I've been to a Chinese buffet or two in my day -- and this one just doesn't stack up.  5 plates of food, and somehow I'm still left wanting ...  The pizza should be the first giveaway that they don't mean business.  Where are potstickers? Where's the calamari salad? That was definitely NOT sushi.  While I can certainly appreciate the food I did over-consume was good-tasting, as fresh as can be for an establishment like this, and visually appealing, frankly, there just wasn't much of selection.  Or I should say, the selection just wasn't what I'm used to.  Maybe I've been spoiled by the Bay Area; maybe I've been spoiled by southeast Tempe; maybe this place just isn't very good.  Bottom line:  if a gutful of Asian food is the plan, China Olive certainly gets the job done -- just don't expect a lot of differentiation in what you shove down your gulet."}
{"text":"Ping. That's the sound the button on my shorts made when they busted open because I ate about 14 plates of food during my glutton-fest.   Flush, flush, flush.  I have a feeling that's the sound I'll be making in about 30 minutes from now.  It's a Chinese buffet that caters almost exclusively to a Hispanic crowd, hot sauce on every table and 50% Latin music playing in the background.  I guess this place was fine.  Some of the items were hot and fresh, a few were old and dried out. They did have about 30+ items to choose from. Even some sushi, but I didn't wanna risk it all and try the tuna. I'm not a gambling man like that."}
{"text":"I used to frequent China Olive, not because it was so great, but just because it was the best in the area when I was in the area.  A few years ago, I enjoyed them better than I have the last couple times I went.  They used to offer a larger variety of foods I like, but now offer more foods I don't eat, such as sushi instead. They always have the typical items and usually they're cooked well. They do suffer from getting fried items on the ~wrong~ side of the Crispy-Greasy Spectrum quite a bit.   Drinks are not included.  Worth the lunch price, but not the dinner price."}
