10/18 Wexford. Intersection of CVS on Perry Highway southbound. Intersection light turns red.  One...two...zoom! Jaden's catering van speeds through the red light. 

No, thanks."}
{"text":"Went to a friends party and Jadens did the catering. All of the food was pretty good. Eggplant Parmesan tray in particular was very good. Cheesy potatoes lacked a little flavor but I would definitely use them for a party after my experience at a friends."}
{"text":"Jaden's is no longer a restaurant. This is an event center and catering kitchen now."}
{"text":"I stopped at the bbq stand they have set up. Ordered Mac and cheese, ribs and corn bread. This is the worst excuse for bbq I have ever had. The ribs weren't even smoked. No smoke ring at all. They were also very dry. And no flavor to the ribs them self. Had to drown it in sauce for it to be editable. Next is the corn bread. It was not home made and served cold. It was the type you get In a package at the grocery store. Now the Mac and cheese wasn't horrible but it wasn't great either. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Food was catered to work and it was absolutely amazing.

We ordered: Bread Sticks, Orange Salad, Sliced Filet Mignon, Chicken Romano, Yukon Roasted Potatoes, Pierogies, and assorted cookies.

Order any or all of the above and you won't be disappointed.

Heads up, Jaden only caters and isn't a restaurant anymore."}
{"text":"We had a bridal shower at Jaden's this past weekend and it was amazing! Jaden's was the perfect location, the food was amazing, the staff was great, and everyone was thrilled with the experience. I had to email back and forth a couple of times with questions and they answered promptly and were so kind. I highly suggest using Jaden's for any event you might have or if you need something catered."}
