{"text":"Cons:

Generally when I order something mild that means no spice or very limited spice. Usually that doesn't mean that they put actual hot sauce on my bun. With so many decent options nearby I will never return. The service I received was unfriendly and confused. 

Pros:
The veggies seemed fresh. It was really fast."}
{"text":"Love their mango smoothie with tapioca especially because of the mango pieces in the smoothie. Could care less for their food. Had the Caramelized Tiger Shrimp sandwich once and threw most of it away, something was off with the smell of the food."}
{"text":"I checked the opening hours online and it was 10:00AM. Came here at around 11:30AM and the employees said they just opened up and started cooking so it would take around 10 minutes to cook up the rice platter and the pho I ordered. I told them I didn't want any vegetables in my pho and the lady said okay. When I got my order it was full of vegetables (which wasn't a big deal). The soup tasted like lime and not like beef at all. The rice noodles were so thin and bland, didn't taste like anything. And lastly, the beef tasted weird and not delicious at all. Would not go here for pho."}
{"text":"Had two Boa's today; lemongrass pork and coconut chicken. Each had thin slices of jalape√±o's, cucumbers, carrots, cilantro and sauce which was amazing. 

The buns were super fluffy and soft....best place in the food court. I wish I had taken photos before I ate both delicious boa's.... I'm definitely returning so I'll take pictures on my return visit ! 

All the Vietnamese food there looks super fresh you can ask for things to be put on to you're sandwich..... some things I've never seen before....... just fantastic!"}
{"text":"You don't go to McDonald's for a good burger, you don't go to Taco Bell for authentic Mexican, and you definitely don't go here for bao or banh mi. I thought this place would be half decent but I was wrong. 

I ordered the lemongrass chicken sandwich and a coconut chicken bao. The sandwich was average but the bao was seriously terrible. Super dry, no flavour, and the bun sucked. At $5 per bao I was expecting it to at least be average. 

I would give this place a 1 star rating just because of the bao but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. Maybe the rest of their food is ok but if you want banh mi or bao definitely go to Banh Mi Boys or something. No reason to waste your time at a fast food joint when there are tons of better places around the corner."}
{"text":"A nice place to stop by to grab a quick bite if you're in the area.  The tacos were good."}
{"text":"It's probably not the wisest move to get soup from a place with the word \"sandwich\" in its name, but I'm all about making stupid ordering decisions.

Then again, this particular soup (or pho, to be more accurate) did call itself Mii's Special, so it seemed like a pretty sure-fire bet.

It's fine. The soup, which contains \"rare beef, well done, beef balls,\" boasts a broth that's actually tastier than I was expecting. The rare beef was okay but far from memorable, while the beef balls were pretty darn chewy. The noodles were a soggy disaster, to be perfectly frank.

Still, for a food-court pho, it's pretty edible."}
{"text":"Located inside the yonge and dundas theatre mall,  there is ample seating.  I don't have high expectations since this is a food court.  The sandwich lady is very aggressive at selling her sandwiches.  Just even looking at the menu, she will start talking to you and telling you about the menu and her specials.

I ended up trying the pork belly sandwich.  It's not bad.  Pretty good value for money.  

Usually, I just go for the pork belly for its deliciousness.   I haven't tried their other menu selections but since it is a Vietnamese sandwich shop, I would only get the sandwich."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch and dinner. This is a nice go to place at Yorkville's food court. This is a contemporary Vietnamese eatery. Quite delicious. $"}
{"text":"This purchase was the second time I tried MII.  Its in the building where i work but i dont normally go there.  I was hungry for something small in the afternoon so i popped down to get the lemongrass bao.   It was very good for about $4.  Nice fresh cucumber and coriander garnish.  Great for  quick bite"}
