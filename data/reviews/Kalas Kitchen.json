{"text":"Their Sambhar is just water with spices. No lentils or veggies what so ever. Their Parathas gave me a bad after taste. Not recommended."}
{"text":"Great Veg food. Clean and very tasteful! Thalis are filling and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Not cheap for takeout.  Samosas were ok.  Pakoras were good.  I would pay more for them but not double the price of other places. Why the 1 star.  The dosa.  Awful.  Nothing like the reals stuff and twice the price. Channa Bhatura was not bad.  Not a fancy place, not a great location, not sure why the high prices.  If they stopped serving dosa or call it by another name I would add another star."}
{"text":"The portions are small, considering the rates they charge. Food is ok, but absolutely no customer service. Not going back there again."}
