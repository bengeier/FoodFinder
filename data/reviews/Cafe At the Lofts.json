{"text":"Love this cafe! Wedding soup to die for and endless new options to try. Affordable and fast as well! Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I am going to let you in on a little secret...Cafe at the Lofts has a great Saturday breakfast dish.  Order the breakfast burrito with bacon, salsa and hot sauce (there hot sauce is more flavor than heat).  Order it exactly like that and you will have a new \"go to\" breakfast item. 

Remember, they only offer it on Saturdays. Also, they have coffee that is on par with Voluto or Tazo Dorro.  

This is a pretty cool place also.

***UPDATE***

I am sad to say that things have changed here.  Two Saturdays in a row I have come down (20 minute drive ) to get the breakfast burrito only to find they are out.  Ok.  That happens.  Although I am disappointed I am not upset. The problem is the lady working the counter...she is very gruff. Both times when I asked if they have breakfast burritos I have been rudely told \"we are out.\"  The first visit I did not ask a follow up question.  This time (time 11:37 AM) I ask \"don't you close at 2?\"  The response...\"well I am not going to make burritos all day. (Rude tone)\". 

Sorry, but I just won't be back for a while. I figure 3 months and this person won't be working here anymore. See you in 90!"}

{"text":"I only ever order one thing from here --- The Navigator Wrap --- but it's delicious. I've only ever dealt with the restaurant through delivery, but they're always very prompt. Everything on the menu is fairly priced. If you work in the North Side it's definitely a great place to order from."}
{"text":"What a delight!  I love finding a place that makes you feel right at home while serving food like Mom used to make!   They seem to have just the right touch from the friendly service, the portion size (generous), and really great salads / sandwiches / deserts!

I also recommend their catering.  Since I started using them a year ago, they are my first choice for entertaining guests with good home cooked entrees like stuffed cabbage rolls, glazed apricot pecan chicken, lasagna and my favorite - Garlic Mashed Potatoes with cheddar cheese.  Cafe at the Lofts is just a good place with good people & great food!"}
{"text":"Sadly in the year and a half since I first wrote my review things have changed a bit at Cafe, and not for the best. More and more my coworkers and I are experiencing regular problems with this place, that is when we're brave enough to risk ordering from Cafe now.

Firstly, there's the problems with the orders. It honestly doesn't seem to matter if we order right off the menu or if we ask for a small change to our order - something basic will always be missing (like lettuce) or done incorrectly when the food arrives. 

Then there's the fact that the order time really has slowed down, a lot - once we placed an order and nothing arrived for two hours. Sorry, but unless it's a major holiday that kind of wait for a sandwich is just too long. Most recently, it took an hour for our food to even get out the door (we know this because we called exactly an hour after ordering, and they said it was leaving then). Why couldn't they have warned us about this wait in advance? This is standard practice for other companies that deliver, is it not?

The final downgrade in service at Cafe are the problems with their phone and staff. I've been accidentally hung up on multiple times at this point; I've also heard people debating in the background about who needs to take our order when we're asked to hold, please. From the snippets of conversation we can hear, things definitely aren't running as smoothly at Cafe as they used to be. Of course this is just when I can dial through - it's not uncommon to try to dial in and be told that the call can't be connected for some reason. 

All of this adds up to a more and more disappointing Cafe delivery experience. At this point the quality of the food can't make up for the problems - it's honestly hardly even worth the hassle to order from them anymore. I keep hoping they'll bounce back to what they used to be, but we're clearly not there yet."}
{"text":"Cafe at the Lofts is my favorite Troy Hill/North Side lunch spot. Delicious homemade soups, tasty sandwiches, and friendly service. A suitable North side alternative to my beloved Eat Unique and Food for Thought in Oakland.

I've had various panini, salads and soups here, and I have only been disappointed by the Four Cheese Panini. Their soups are good to very good. The salads have always seemed fresh and crisp.

There is a decent selection of sandwiches available, and the daily specials are usually quite good. If you happen to be looking for lunch on the North Side, I recommend giving them a shot."}
{"text":"Place is kinda a joke. Went in 45min before closing and the lady gave me the whole \"YOU KNOW I'M CLOSIN SOON, RIGHT?\" routine. Tuna sandwich was ok. They didnt have coffee hot or iced. And their special was a ham and cheese sandwich. Based on that, prob wont be back. I'm sure they don't really need my business though."}
{"text":"I just wanted to come back and say that I haven't had anymore issues with the wait or timing with my orders. They have been prompt and usually I call ahead so it's waiting for me. Food is still solid, nothing I crave per se but enjoyable and filling none the less."}
{"text":"I stopped by for a quick grab and go breakfast and coffee, was not clean and customer service was not great. place was messy. i haven't gone back since."}
{"text":"I recently moved out of the Heinz Lofts and the hardest part about leaving was not being able to see the staff at the Cafe every day! Cindy, the owner, and her staff were truly like family to me.  The Cafe at the Lofts made living at the Heinz Lofts better thanks to the staff members at the cafe who made you feel loved and valued.  The Southern Comfort wrap was my fav...they'll even put it on lettuce for you if your watching your carbs!! Love this place and the people who work there!! Xo"}
{"text":"Everything I've ordered from here is delicious & fresh.
The soups are homemade & just what winter calls for!"}
