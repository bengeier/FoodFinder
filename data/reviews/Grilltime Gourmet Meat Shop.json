{"text":"Love grilltime.  A bit on the pricey side but everything is top-notch.  We live near the danforth and a greek butcher but honestly, the souvlaki is better at  grilltime.  We had take out as well once and it was excellent (was the halibut I think). If you grill on charcoal as well they have the best charcoal in town; quality-stuff. Also they have every type of woodchip you can imagine, much better than anything at Canadian Tire. An amazing  selection of  rubs, sauces, etc.  Don't expect too much in the way of grill tools or actual grills though, just the basics."}
{"text":"Hello everyone.  Happy Holidays.  Wishing you all the best in 2016!  On December 24, 2015, I picked-up my order of a fresh turkey weighing a little more than 16 pounds.  To make a long story short, it was awesome.  I will definitely order from Grilltime Gourmet Meat Shop again.   Signed, a satisfied customer,  Annie Gray."}
{"text":"I drive for miles to get me a pulled pork sandwich from Grill Time. I used to work in the area a few years ago and would make a point of going here for lunch regularly. Any sandwich with hot meat inside is a go for me and they have a great selection.  There are usually a few tables to sit at if you'd like to eat in. They will cook anything in the fridge for you fresh and IN YOUR FACE at the bar style seating around their grilling station. I've had the tenderloin steak and it was BOSS.  On top of all the food they will cook for you, there is a plethera of things to take home and grill up yourself. And all the fixings to make it just the way you like it. A WALL OF SPICES, SEASONINGS, AND SAUCES all locally sourced. And charcoal if thats your thing. Im trying an organic coconut husk charcoal the owner recomended.  HOME TOWN FEEL and BIG TIME TASTE! I'll be back again. And again."}
{"text":"Pricey, but you absolutely get what you pay for! Very tasty meats and good salads. Also picked up some marinades for cooking steak at home and everyone loves them."}
{"text":"Looking for candidates for the best burger in the city? This is up there with the best. I enjoyed it way more than the one I had at Richmond Station (and I really love R.S.). This is flavour country! I have also had the brisket 4.5 stars and the steak sandwich 3.5 stars (but that is because I am not a big fan of steak sandwiches that you bite into and end up in a wrestling match with the meat...flavour is spot on though).   This is a hidden gem...literally as it is off the beaten path on Laird and in a funny little plaza with a Starbucks. Check this place out!"}
{"text":"They are getting cheaper with their portions. There's a place around the corner called Adamson that offers better food and larger portions for a better price."}
{"text":"How many of you watch Tool Time? It's the show within a show on Home Improvement. The show that featured what SPIKE displays on their advertising promos. Fast Cars, Manly Tools, Hot Women, Explosions, Bloody Sports, etc...   When you walk through this part of town you'll notice the abandoned Lots, Auto-body Shops while arriving at Grill Time. Stepping inside it looked like a Muskoka getaway with a Bear statue greeting you at the door while Fresh/Frozen Meats, Hot Sauces, BBQ Sauces/Rubs/Marinades, Cookbooks, Flavour Wood Chips, BBQ Accessories, and a BBQ Grill overwhelm this small shop.   One stop shop for BBQ amateurs and pros. Think of it as the BBQ episode on Tool Time where staff shares their wealth of knowledge and passion.  The shop was slightly Bass Pro Shop alike but it's all about Meat & Fire here, Pineapple optional. They do serve a Lunch which is cooked on their Grill Island that has 6 seats surrounding it like Teppanyaki. It's also for hosting Cooking Classes or a Private Party.   A small Menu as we got that pleasant smell in the air as someone came in and got their food to-go. I guess it caters to the surrounding Auto-body Shop, Garages and the Telus Building within view. The Leaside neighbourhood residences are really lucky to have such a place so nearby.   Grill Time might be situated in the most awkward unnoticeable plaza anywhere. The prices might be slightly on the premium but still I rather have a shop like this than M&M Meats. This place looks immaculate and kept in top conditions. It's like they know how to treat Meat right."}
{"text":"Grilltime Gourmet Meat Shop is really a diamond in the rough, a little gem in this area surrounded by body shops and garages!  Grilltime carries fresh and frozen products for your grilling needs. Beef, Roast, Chicken, Seafood, Porks, Ribs and Hors D'Oeuvres and many more you can think of if you do want to have a dinner party at home.  They also have a full grilling island in the store, so if you want you can ask them to grill it for you too! BTW, you can host a private party (8 people at $75 each) in the store where a chef will grill 5 courses meal for you and your guests.  Love the collections of hot sauces here! The Blair's Beyond Death I wondering how hot it is! There are also a lot of different BBQ sauces, marinating sauces you can get to make your meat taste extra good!  The main reason I think this is a 4 star experience is that the friendly and knowledgeable  staff here that are so patient and willing to answer all my questions and make dropping in the shop a A1 experience! It is so great to talk to staff that have so much interest in what they are doing!  Though now is not BBQ season but when the time comes, Grilltime will be the to go place if I want to fire up my backyard BBQ!!"}
