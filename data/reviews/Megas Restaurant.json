{"text":"Geez. I just cant figure it out. I've been looking through what other people have said about Megas, and it's all so bad...really bad. That's where the trouble comes in for me, because I certainly didn't hate it as much as everyone else seems to. In fact, I actually thought I was going to be giving Megas more then 3 stars with this review. Why? This is the second time I've been to Megas. I was only going again because it was so good the first time. But the second time wasn't even a close second.  The big plus Megas has got going for them is their killer patio right on the busier stretch of the Danforth. It's probably one of the best places to sit outdoors on the street. It's a big, covered space that's chock full of people, and at first glance, is difficult not to gravitate towards on a sunny day.   Once you get over the patio though, and it comes to eating, you're likely to be disappointed; but it's completely dependent on what you order and when you order it. The food at Megas is mostly mediocre, but there are a couple things worth mentioning. While the rice is of the reheated, overcooked, slightly warmed kind, the Saganaki (fried Feta cheese made of sheep's milk) and Taramosalata (Cod caviar spread) is probably some of the best on The Danforth. Seriously, if you have never tried either of these, this is the place to do it. But everything else, order with caution. This place is completely hit or miss, mostly depending on how busy they are.  The inside is sorta your typical Greek place: fake roman statues, stone pillars, and lots of greenery; it's a big space too. If you check it out on the weekend, chances are that big space will have more than one big group, which Megas can provide for comfortably. But that's where most of their issues lie. While they may be able to provide for big groups, it's at the sacrifice of all the other tables. Once Megas gets busy, the service, food quality, and overall experience seemingly drops right through the floor.  Unfortunately, the one thing that is truly consistent at Megas no matter how many times you go there is their lack of caring for food presentation. While most of the stuff they serve seems to be haphazardly dropped on the plate, I don't blame Megas for that. After all, that's pretty much a standard for Greek food; it never seems to be about the presentation. When it comes to Greek food, there's never really a big surprise with what you end up with at your table. You order calamari? It's probably served garnished with parsley and olive oil. You order hummus? It's probably served garnished with olive oil and a lone Kalmata olive. The only difference varying from place to place is whether it's tasty enough to be worth eating.  I'm still slightly confused about whether to recommend this place or not. I mean, they've got a few things going for them. Like I said, the first time was pretty good, and if I knew I was guaranteed that every time, I'd have no problems returning.  Megas basically comes down to this: if the place isn't busy, stop in and check it out; if they are busy, keep walking."}
{"text":"Great dinner. Fast service. Spanikopita was really good. Would be a 5 if the server had a personality."}
{"text":"Racist owner refused to serve us yet continued to allowed people in. Everything was fine, we entered and politely asked the waitress if we could sit on the patio. She was great and lead us there. As we sat the owner, who was drinking on the patio, called over my black friend and rudely asked if there was a problem for no reason and then refused to serve us. Even the waitress looked was shocked. That fat racist pig doesn't belong in a multicultural city like Toronto. Avoid if you have any sense of morals."}
{"text":"The three of us had dinner at about 7pm. I had roast lamb with potatoes, veggies and rice. It was good. My wife had breaded calamari. It was ok,...acceptable. Our friend had Chilean sea bass with potatoes etc.....not good. The fish was white snapper....not acceptable!....the waiter tried to pawn in off as one and the same.....definitely not acceptable!.....the only two desserts available (even though the board outside advertised more), were stored-in-fridge-and-then-reheated....hard and stale. (both the slice o' chocolate cake and baklava). Not good. Granted, the waiter did acknowledge the stale cake, and took it off the bill after we commented. The women's washroom was very smelly. There are three factors that affect my restaurant experience; food quality (and taste), service quality and cleanliness (especially washrooms). (Decor and atmosphere can be overlooked). Unfortunately Megas fails on all three accounts. The extra star is for the dish I had, which was good....but just good."}
{"text":"One word: No.  The food is awful, you can get better and more authentic greek cuisine in a food court. The service was dreadful, besides the hostess who was pleasant.   Overall, we did not feel welcome and left as soon as possible after literally choking down our entrees. They use those processed \" __% meat protein\" frozen chicken breasts for their souvlaki! Not acceptable.The salad was probably the best thing about this joint."}
{"text":"3.5 stars is closer to accurate I think.  We bought a voucher, and after reading all the negative reviews, I was terrified. We actually put off going as we were worried we'd be disappointed. I was ready for a fight too, as per the previous voucher users experience.  BUT much to my delight - everything was great! Service was good, food was good, and there was absolutely no problem with my bill.  The portions were large, so much so that we took home a doggie bag.   What we ordered/ received with voucher: - 2 salads - 2 dips - Tzatziki and Scordalia (liked the Tzatiziki better than Scordalia) - Spanakopita - Pork Tenderloin Souvlaki - Chicken Souvlaki - White wine - it was light in flavour, but drinkable - dessert - not sure what it was as it was just brought out to us - it was ok, a dense custard type cake with a sweet clear sauce on top. Would have picked something else if we had an option.  Was the meal perfect? Maybe not. I wished we could have swapped the bread/butter on the table for more pita bread for the dips as there wasn't enough for the amount of dip. And the rice was bland. But everything was pretty good.  Perhaps they had a steep learning curve with the vouchers, but my experience didn't reflect most of the others at all. I have to say thank you to the girl who posted the positive voucher experience just before we went, as it gave me hope to try it!  Bottom line -For the price we paid with the voucher, it was well worth the price.  Would I go again? Probably at some point.  We just moved to the area and there's a lot to try."}
{"text":"A year or so ago I would've given this place a 4 or even 5 stars. Sadly, this place has gone downhill in terms of their food. Megas was my favourite Greek restaurant for many years and the only Greek restaurant I would dine at, but not anymore.   This restaurant is spacious, the d√©cor is very Greek and classy, and I love how you are not rushed which makes one feel so much more comfortable. The service has always been great and the staff is kind and efficient. Also, they have a nice outdoor patio.  The menu consists of hot and cold appetizers, salads, grilled dishes, seafood, meat, sandwiches, and vegetarian options. Their wine list is nice, and desserts are really good. Although the menu seems nice, the food used to be excellent a year or so ago, but now I don't know what happened. The quality and portions of the food have decreased, and the prices are raised! My favourite dish at this restaurant that I would always order was not even edible anymore, nor did it come with a Greek salad as it used to.  After this change at Megas, I never came back, and never will until they tone down the sucky overpriced food and bring this place back the way it used to be."}
{"text":"I ate at Megas twice within the span of one week - totally unusual for me and caused by a series of family get-togethers.  Both times the service was very good (we actually had the same waiter), and both times everyone I was with was very happy with their meals (souvlakis all round, but all different kinds).  I had the chicken souvlaki and thought it was completely awesome.  It was nicely seared on the outside and moist inside.  The potatoes that came with it were good too, and the rice was alright.  What really did it for me was the tzatziki...it was out of this world!  The side salad was just alright, with a good amount of feta but I wished for more olives.  I also thought the bread that came before the meal was good and had a nice homemade flavour.    Clearly we had a good experience because I suggested the place for my second family get-together.  This time I had a greek salad and we all shared some saganaki and gigantes (lima beans).  The greek salad was alright but the saganaki was to die for and the gigantes were really good too (if you can get over your childhood fear of lima beans).  I was really happy with my experience(s) at Megas this week and will be back the next time a craving for Greek food strikes me."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good but a bit too salty.  The atmosphere & decor are excellent.  Thanks.  Will come by again."}
{"text":"Very disappointing.  Ordered delivery and items were missing. Those that were included were mediocre at best, meat was overly oily and rice was bland. The order had bread which was literally just thrown in to the delivery bag in slices--not wrapped in anything."}
{"text":"We had lunch at Megas, including a Greek Salad that was fresh with big chunks of feta cheese. I like that. Then between us we shared the calamari, it was served hot and was a big portion.   Thats all we had so no entree reviews yet. But the chef came out and said hello, he is a big man, very friendly and Greek of course.  I will definitely come back for a dinner visit."}
{"text":"I had a voucher for this restaurant which had expired (it was a short window and I didn't realize you weren't allowed to use it Saturdays!).  I called to ask if they would honour it because it was less than a week expired.  The man who answered the phone was EXTREMELY rude and said if it was expired it was worth nothing.  I argued that it should be worth at least what was paid and he told me to call back.  Upon calling back, I spoke with the manager who was a little more pleasant and said I could use it for its value.  I ordered the house red wine, which was quite good for a house wine, albeit not Greek.   Bread was dropped off and it was plentiful.  We ordered the calarmari to start, but it was tough and under seasoned.  Our mains arrived on HUGE plates (the stuffed chicken and lamb/feta pie) and although they lacked presentation, we were both happy and the portions were huge (I ate half and I can eat a lot!).  We were going to pass up on dessert but our server talked us into it.  He brought out a big plate of home made apple pie (rivaling my Granny's), baklava and ice cream, which he had plated himself and charged only for one slice of pie :)  Obviously, we LOVED our server and the food was good.  Despite having our regular spots on the Danforth, we will be back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic service! The food was fresh, delicious and authentic. We ate the three dip with pita and bread. I'm glad to say it is the best Greek restaurant I've tried in Toronto, I'll definitely be back. The fast service was the cherry on top of the tree, I'd recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"Loved the apps, reasonable pricing, and lively environment. Great food, service, and absolutely AMAZING live performance made mine and the girlfriend's night. The female lead singer had an incredible voice and created a lovely evening for me and my girlfriend. IT was the whole package."}
{"text":"Good food, good service. We ordered the saganaki,  the seafood platter and lamb chops. Everything was delicious. Good portions"}
{"text":"My favourate is calamari dinner.. So good!!!  But the other food menu.. Not as good as I expected. Just average..not stella.  The prices are little bit expensive considering food quality and portion.  The service was excellent and friendly."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for Greek food before seeing The Sonics at the Danforth Music Hall, so we after a stroll we decided on this place.  I was surprised to see it only had two and a half starts on here, because our experience was pretty nice.  Yes, it is a little overpriced for the size of your portion.  However, the service was fine, nothing was forgotten with our order, and everything tasted great.  The pork souvlaki was tender and flavourful, and my significant other enjoyed his vegetarian moussaka.  I'd definitely try other restaurants in the area as well, but I would also go back here if I have some money to spend."}
{"text":"The ratings on yelp are quite accurate as to what to expect here. I wasnt the one that chose to come here because I wouldn't have picked this restaurant. I had the grilled octopus that comes with rice and vegetables and the starter was a Greek salad. The Greek salad was drenched with dressing. The grilled octopus was pretty good but the rice and vegetables are the quality that I would have made at home. The meal is not what I would have expected for $25 dollar meal. I do not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Friend and I decided to try this place on a busy Saturday night since there was no wait time compared to the other Greek places. Boyy was that a mistake! Restaurant was half full and we ordered chicken souvlaki's (w/ salad, rice, and potato). Service was really slow for all the customers nearby even though there's plenty of front staff. Took like 20 min for bread and another 20 for the salads. This is after the server checking up on us twice to ask if we received the salads yet. Chicken souvlaki dinner was bland. After our meals, we both felt a bit sick in the stomach and I felt like puking. Upon walking past the kitchen to the washroom, the cooks looked miserable...doesn't feel like the food is made with care here and will not be going back.   Sometimes it's worth the wait at a good restaurant than try to satisfy your immediate hunger and risk the potential food poisoning. An hour after we felt okay so it's not a big deal. The staff seemed pretty courteous; still would not go back though."}
{"text":"AVOID AT ALL COSTS!  WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!!!  Place wasn't even busy and we had to wait 10 minutes for a table of two.  The service is terrible.  Our food came out cold, we had to remind the server to bring us bread and we had to ask them for salad (which was part of the meal) it was brought after the mains...my mid rare lamb was well and the salads were rotting,  too bad Astoria was closed today otherwise I would have gone there"}
{"text":"There was no difference between the larger sized souvlaki dinners compared to the small, photos for reference, there was no difference except ~$5 more for the large. Not quite filling, which shouldn't be for the prices charged.  There's a restaurant across the street called Messinis which has much better portions."}
{"text":"Holy Crap, what's with the bad reviews? I can't believe that this is the same place we ate dinner at last night!  We came around 5 pm ans sat on the patio. We had several servers come and ask if we were ready to order, but we weren't. We wanted fried calamari and also some hot apps, but the Hot Platter for 2 only had the grilled calamari. Our server was nice enough to substitute the fried calamari for us at no extra charge.   I had a glass of nice refreshing Greek white that hit the spot. The Greek Salad we had was super fresh and crunchy with a perfect dressing and just the right amount of feta.  The platter had 2 dolomades, that were very good and had a nice mint flavour behind the grape leaf. The house made sausage had loads of lemon zest in it and was exceptionally flavourful. Spanakopita was flaky, buttery and delicious and the octopus was nice, too. I have to say that the calamari was not as tender as I would have expected, but it wasn't terrible. They also brought us some delicious hummus that was made with fresh chickpeas. They also brought a nice helping of yummy tatziki on a plate.  The service was exceptional and we rarely waited for anything we needed. Our server asked my boyfriend if he wanted another diet coke, she cleared our cutlery from the greek salad and replaced it when our platter came.   Maybe it was a fluke, but we had an absolutely great little nosh and I'd come back again anytime."}
{"text":"just came here for some greek food.   they have a whole vegetarian food section (already plus for a greek place) good food portions that come with a greek salad and a basket of bread.   good selection of wine and beer. greek beer is also on the list and has an interesting taste (if you guys know kvas then you can imagine the taste=))   our waiter made the experience unique! he was super attentive. chatted us up in between running around serving other clients. told us stories of his youth and talked to each of us a little bit in our mother tongues.   great patio for people watching too!"}
{"text":"Can I just start with - what a horrible experience this was.  We only ended up here because Astoria was closed today. We debated between here and another patio and what a mistake choosing this place.   There was a line almost out the door, and the restaurant was basically empty. You could see servers just sitting around doing absolutely nothing. It took 10 minutes before we got a seat on the patio.   Another mistake we made, sitting on the practically neglected patio. Our server (Kosta) was not very friendly and barely came to our table.   I must have asked 3 times for more hot water for my tea, and never got it.  We ordered  - Feta appetizer - lamb and chicken souvlaki  We got our appetizer but had no plates and no cutlery on our table.  we had to ask for it. We also had to ask them to bring bread to our table.   Mains came out pretty quickly. Mine was undercooked, cold to the touch and I had to send it back to the kitchen.   Our mains were missing salad, so had to ask for that too. Salad had leaves that were rotten, and old.   Never saw the waiter again after that. Asked a different server for the bill which is when we saw our waiter again.  Honestly,  did not feel that he deserved a tip. Did not even feel that we should have been charged for our meal after this experience.  As we were leaving, he was yelling at us over the patio with sarcasm as to \"how good the tip was and he can't wait to see us again\" - while he was tending to another table.   Real professional.    Had a horrible experience and will never return. I'd rather eat greek food at the mall."}
{"text":"Got a groupon-type deal for a prix-fixe meal here - big mistake.  The food served was absolutely terrible in terms of value and quantity - the \"three appetizer platter\" was actually a tiny spoonful each of what appeared to be store-bought dips, the greek salad had iceberg lettuce (?!?) and canned olives, and the chicken was dry and served on plain rice that strongly resembled Minute Maid.  To make matters worse, when we questioned the waiter about the wine being served - advertised as a $30 bottle, actually homemade house wine that was both undrinkable, and advertised on the menu as being half that cost - the manager came over and started arguing with my mother, accusing her of having poor taste.  As if that wasn't bad enough, he then personally served us a bill that included a mandatory 25% tip (for a party of two!) as well as taxes charged on the FULL \"value\" of the meal - not only ridiculous at $120, but actually illegal since taxes can only be charged on the price paid ie $60 for the coupon.  Oh and the decor was both creepy and amateur...imagine your kids painting a Greek garden scene.  Never again. If the purpose of such a promotion is to draw new customers, they certainly failed by trying to make it a cash cow - while serving garbage in an incredibly rude and arrogant manner.   Avoid. Not that you'd be hard pressed to find other better choices within steps on the Danforth..."}
{"text":"A little overpriced for what it offers. Unlike other reviewers, my experience with the service was quite alright. What gave this place a 2 star review was really the food itself. My party had the lamb souvlaki, seafood dinner, vegetarian moussaka and the saganaki. Can't really speak for the lamb as I personally don't eat meat but the side of potatoes and veggies were overall greasy. Seafood dinner was disappointing as a lot of the seafood was overdone - the grilled calamari was hard to bite into, as were the octopus, and the fried fish was incredibly salty. The moussaka was nothing special but I found it overpriced in comparison."}
{"text":"Came here just for 1 drink with a few friends.  We sat on the patio.  Not much to say except the restaurant was very empty while others just a few doors down were very full.     However just by having 1 drink I could tell why.  The patio is very cramped and the chairs are made of cheap metal. More importantly, the menu seemed \"cheap\".  Not many options to choose from and expensive drinks.   I will give this place a shot again in the future and update my review."}
{"text":"I went to Megas a few years ago and had a good, tasty experience but recently back for my birthday with a large group of people and was very disappointed with not only the food, but the service as well.   The only thing I enjoyed about the food was the salad -- let's face it, you can't go wrong with salad! I ordered a moussaka meal for the first time after hearing what a delicious Greek food it was....ew! After one bite I was immediately turned off! I asked other family members to taste it as well and I wasn't the only one who thought it tasted nasty. The potatoes tasted like it originally came in a powder form and when I asked the servers if I could exchange the moussaka for regular roasted potatoes, I had to basically talk them into giving me what I asked for. They tried to convince me that the potatoes used in the moussaka was the same roasted potatoes they used in all their other dishes but you could tell it wasn't. Other family members weren't satisfied with their ordered dishes either. My group had a lot of complaints of their rice tasting and smelling a few days old, maybe a bit spoiled. No one wanted to say anything because of the hassle the servers made about the whole moussaka mishap.   As it was time for the bill, our table was told that we couldn't get separate bills because it was too large of a group, although we had asked before we ordered! Our server put one huge bill (of 17 people!) altogether. We had to sort our bill of who was paying for what, which took almost 30 minutes because we also weren't allowed to do separate payments. Basically, one person had to pay a bill for 17 people and then we all had to transfer that person money after which was a complete unnecessary hassle.   I would've given 1 star but I gave 2 because they brought out my birthday cake from their fridge and plates to serve them on.  Very disappointing because a few years ago I thought their food was amazing. Now? Not at all. Wouldn't go to Megas again, nor would I recommend it. There are other amazing Greek restaurants on the Danforth that I will try moussaka from one day lol."}
{"text":"Had dinner with a friend - we came in around 7ish and the place was dead. It picked up a little but maybe 5 more tables.   I had the gyros dinner and it came with salad. Ok, the food wasn't bad in my opinion but there were parts of the meals that were misses.  The potato was hard and you get this mini plastic cup of tzatziki sauce.  The bread we got at the beginning seemed stale (all in crumbles and broken up). I'd recommend another place for greek food in the area.  Food: 2/5, not very good.  Service: 2/5, despite having almost no customers, not much attention.  Ambience: 3/5, cool paintings and a lot of seat selection  Price: 2/5, not great for what you get."}
{"text":"Ok what just happened?? I just drove all the way from Oakville to Danforth for this?? Whatever you do, don't order chicken souvlaki at this place EVER!! It was bone dry that got stuck in my chest on its way down! I could have got that at our local mr Greek didn't need to drive up to danforth for that! Holly sh  They just re heated some left over chicken and gave it to me! That's not authentic Greek food! The only star I gave was for the service not the food! Food gets nothing I'm never going back there!"}
{"text":"Atrocious customer service.   We ordered two meals on Just Eat. The meals came and were a) cold and b) not even close to what we ordered.   My fiance called to ask if they could deliver the correct items. The person told us no. I called back and simply verified that they would be refunding our meal. The man told us \"no, you got your meal, didn't you\"? Well, no, I did not get the meal I ordered. He told me that I would need to take it up with Just Eat (which I did and they were fabulous).   Needless to say, we will not be returning to Megas. Horrible."}
{"text":"You know when you have a craving for food, oh, say, like Greek? Where else do you head except for greek town. right? Without an ipod yelp application to guide me, this was my solution.  As a newbie to the city it seemed the most logical course of action.  I love Greek so I went to the first one I came across after getting off the smelly, humid subway.  I must say, I was so disappointed. My friend, James said you should have gone to the one across the street. I wondered about that after I sat down.  To me, Roast lamb is the measure of a good greek meal.  The lamb was slightly overcooked. Other parts were tender but the tough sections sure ruined my meal. I'm so used to inhaling my Greek food so this was a new experience.   Roast lamb came with lemon potatoes, carrots and broccoli with greek salad.  Portion wise it was a sizeable meal. You will be full and no doubt even Gene from the band KISS would be.  There's an awesome photo of him as a patron on the wall of fame near the washrooms.  My friend ordered the Horitaki Salad: feta, onions, tomatoes etc in a red wine vinegar and olive oil dressing.  Incredible!  I couldn't eat my salad in comparison to hers.  Yeah, I ate hers then she took pity on my sad salad and just gave me some of hers.  As much as I loved her salad, it's not enough to make me return.  The odd quirk about her salad dish was that as good and as crisp tasting the veggies were the tomatoes were warm in comparison to the wonderful crunch I got from everything else."}
{"text":"We ordered Megas take-out from Just-Eat!.  It was just the ticket. My hubby had the Salmon dinner and I had the Gyros dinner. It came really fast -- earlier than promised.  Very generous portions --- the salmon was fantastic and the gyros was plentiful --- in fact enough for two meals. Came with homemade bread and Greek salad.  I totally recommend!  Don't ever be afraid to order from these guys! Great value for the money too!"}
{"text":"This was out first trip to Megas I went with my best friend and her parents. The service was amazing! Our waiter was friendly and had made excellent wine suggestions, we were given water and bread within in minutes of being seated. We started with pita and 3 dips. The food came quickly. The hummus was decent, but nothing special, the Scordalia was a bit bland, but the Kopanisti was excellent (warning it is a bit spicy).  The surf and turf was very good, but the shrimp was overcooked a bit. The chicken souvlaki was excellent, although not the best ever. The stuffed chicken was poor. it was overcooked and bland and the potatoes with it were also worse than the potatoes with the rest of the meal. The Exohiko was very good. Cooked properly, well season and tasty!  Overall a solid experience, but not our favourite place on the Danforth."}
{"text":"I came here with the man in my life ( at the moment) because it was recommended to me by someone who worked in the kitchen 10 years ago...  he had the beef gyro and I had the stuffed chicken. We went around 6 pm on a Friday night and the place was empty...  Usually that's when I turn around and leave. I find that if a place isn't busy then there is a reason ....  We didn't wait long for our food and it made sense why... The meat was so hard he couldn't eat it... It snapped in half: it felt like it was the previous days food. The vegetables were over cooked and extremely salty. I couldn't even eat them. The chicken was okay but I feel like I could have made it at home and it would have tasted better. We didn't send the food back because I didn't want any surprises. It's a bad idea to negatively send your food away and not be able to see it...  I won't come back here but I can say I tried it... Go to messini down the street on the south side of danforth... It's amazing authentic Greek food and the meat won't snap when you bite it."}
{"text":"I haven't had a horrible food experience in a while....Megas broke that cycle.  The food is mediocore at best. The restaurant ambience isn't great. It's a little ghetto. The bathrooms stink The waitress we had was unbelievably rude The service is so slow it will make you want to pull your hair out - everything from making an order, to asking for your bill 3 times The food service is so slow you will eat the entire loaf of free COLD bread"}
{"text":"Service was overall good but food was subpar.  One of the dips seems to been a little old, the salad came with one tomato, one piece of onion, just lettuce.  The main course and the wine was generally 2/5."}
{"text":"Went recently as part of a group for a baptism. The environment was nice and the place was packed. Service was very slow, so the staff tried to compensate by continuously bringing bread baskets...most guest ended up filling up on bread. Their dips were average, the salad was well dressed, but their moussaka was on the bland side."}
{"text":"My family and I came here on a Tuesday night after my sister's choir service at St. Paul's. We were given a table quickly and the service was polite. The service was snappy and fast, and the atmosphere was relaxing and cultured. Food was great as always!"}
{"text":"Why are we at Megas Restaurant when fellow yelpers rating this place a 1 to 2 stars??   Why we didn't check the reviews on yelp before sitting down?  Why a fanatic yelper and mega planner like me will make a mistake like this?  Anyway, as I thought I would be yelled by some rude Greek waiter and have food and drinks poured on me... but nothing like that happen.....  The Patio is OK, the space a little cramped but has the full view of Danforth great for people watching.  I cannot comment on the food... but the Mythos served in a frosted mug really hit the spot on a hot summer day.. And I got that real fast..no waiting... and the bill came real fast too..  At least I have an A-OK experience... I wouldn't mind coming for a drink or too.. but I might just skip on the food!"}
{"text":"Went there with  a large group for a special occasion.  It was a warm, but not unusually hot evening, but the main seating area inside was very hot.  Many of us were quite uncomfortable from the heat so we asked that the A/C be turned on.  They told us it was on full, which made no sense at all because there was no evidence of it, and because this would suggest that the restaurant would be a furnace on a really hot day.  Towards the end one of our party actually fainted from the heat.  An ambulance had to be called and everyone in the restaurant was inconvenienced."}
{"text":"This is, quite literally, THE WORST GREEK RESTAURANT I HAVE EVER IN MY LIFE EXPERIENCED.  SERIOUSLY.  Run from this place.  The food was horrible.  The prices, frankly, OUTRAGEOUS.   I ordered roasted lamb.  How do you manage to screw that up?  Megas manages just fine thank you!  The salad was A JOKE.  No real Greek dressing, creamy dressing, and the salad was SO OVERDRESSED I couldn't eat it.  Waitress doesn't bother to ask.  Main course, even worse.  No Greek rice, tasteless rice with carrots and peas.  Potatoes have to be from last week, SWIMMING in GREASE.  Odd raw carrot thing, no flavor at all.  Lamb was ALSO SWIMMING in GREASE!  Just disgusting.  Waitress asks how it was.  I said, OK I guess.  SHE DIDN'T EVEN BOTHER TO ASK WHAT WAS WRONG.  THEN THE PRICE?  $22.99.  $3 FOR A SINGLE COKE.  SERIOUSLY????  Shameful food and service.  HOW IS THIS PLACE STILL IN BUSINESS???  RUN AWAY FOLKS.  REALLY."}
{"text":"I guess I should have minded the Yelp reviews for this place... :(  I was in love with their food a couple of years go when I was starving, and I always had this amazing image of chicken souvlaki in my head, but today's souvlaki was very dry, overly salty, and just a mess..  They get a bonus star for being very very nice to me!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Mediterranean cuisine and Greek is, by far, my favorite!!! So I'm a self proclaimed connoisseur.  This is the best Greek restaurant I've tried here in Toronto. Their spreads are excellent along side with toasted pitas - their taramosalata and melitzana are especially tasty!! Their saganaki (aka flaming cheese) is sensational! Their souvlakis are grilled to perfection! And their octapothi (aka grilled octopus) is fresh and perfectly smoky.... Oh, oh their desserts, hmmmm.... baklava and kataifi are just sweeeeeet!!!  If you're not familiar with Greek food, ask for recommendations.... Greeks are very friendly and thus the service is always excellent!!  One more thing... They have live performance on the weeekends!! Go and have some fun!! The food is excellent. The service is great. The prices are fair. I think you'll have a great time....."}
{"text":"In the Spirit on the Taste of the Danforth and wanting a patio table I decided to give Megas a try!  There was a line up out the door so I figured this place must be good or it could have been due to the masses on the danforth that night....none the less it looked good from what I could see...  I expected to wait in that line up for at least 30 mins for a patio table but the hostess...a cheerful elderly man did a spectactular job of seating guests promptly.  Service here was top notch! It was sooooo packed but they had many servers helping out and all were filling water glasses and making sure everyone was served and clearing tables.  The patio is small and the tables are pretty close together but no one seemed to mind and it didn't bother me.  We decided to start the night off with a glass of wine. They had a great selection of greek wines and they even had my favourite White Zinfandel!  A waiter took our drink orders and we decided to place our food orders at the same time opting for the safe Small Chicken Souvlaki Dinner.  Our waiter soon returned with our wine and a basket of bread. The bread wasn't anything spectactular just regular italian bread served in a plastic basket with packed butter.  But the greek salad that followed was really good! Romaine with cucumbers, tomatoes, green peppers and black olives with a creamy greek dressing and topped with lots of feta cheese.  Before we finished our salad our mains arrived so the small tables were a little cramped but as soon as we finished the servers helped clear up the empty plates. I guess they were trying to keep things moving since it was soo busy that night...  For a \"small\" chicken souvlaki dinner it was a lot of food. A skewer of chicken with about 6 pieces and greek potatoes and rice and tzatziki. Typical greek cuisine nothing spectacular and the tzatziki tasted fresh ...potatoes and rice were a bit oily but still tasted good.  Waiters kept refilling our water all night long without being asked and our server brought our bill promptly when asked even asking if we wanted to see the dessert menu.  Overall spectactular service but typical greek food on the Danforth."}
