{"text":"Delicious!
Hubby and I started with the chicken n dumplin soup - lovely: creamy and rich.  I had the fried chicken - superb!  With fried corn and mac and cheese.  Hubby had meatloaf with mashed potatoes and mac and cheese.  He said next time he's getting 2 mac and cheese sides!  It was that good.  Chicken was fried perfectly and not greasy.  Fried corn was awesome - and the mac and cheese is to die for!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Excellent food ( we had chicken & waffles, cheddar grits w/shrimp, and mixed greens )
Very casual atmosphere
Kinda dirty but who cares
SLOW. We waited quite a while for our food and there were only 2 other parties in the restaurant.  Food was worth the wait."}
{"text":"Best soul food ever. Cooked to order. Great service! Darlene is awesome...ask for her!"}
{"text":"AWSOME place for breakfast. They said they were slow, but I didn't find them to be such.

Very friendly staff. VERY eclectic tunes!"}
{"text":"This is a must try! 
Best Chicken and waffles in the city and that I have ever had! 
You can pick what part of the chicken you can get, either breast, thigh, or legs, then a big Belgium waffle, and I always get a side of mac and cheese. Everything is made to order, so it does take come time for your food to come out, since we all know raw chicken takes about 20mins to cook completely. 
But you can tell everything is homemade! They provide hot sauce and syrup on the tables. -You must get a bite with chicken, waffle, syrup, and hot sauce, all at once..amazing!"}
{"text":"Gospel music missing today. : (
Queen's breakfast....yum!  Eggs, bacon, belgian waffle and grits. Couldnt finish but, oh well!
Service not quite as up to par as when the nice young man waits on us. Young lady seems a bit distracted by chatting in kitchen."}
{"text":"Breakfast was wonderful!!  I love trying new places...but will defiantly return. Friendly staff and good service."}
{"text":"I was happy we found this place on our first trip to Pittsburg.  We only had breakfast this time, there was a discussion of coming back for dinner after the Steelers game, unfortunately they close earlier on Sundays but had they been open, we would have come back!  Bacon was thin and crisp, pancake was perfect, home fries with the onion and peppers was yummy.  If we are lucky enough to make it back to Pittsburg for another game, we will be back!"}
{"text":"We truly enjoyed eating at Carmi's. I had the blackened Salmon and it was awesome. Every time we are in the area it is a must to stop by. Love love love the family atmosphere!!!"}
{"text":"Had lunch with 14 coworkers today at carmi's. They graciously hosted us without a reservation. The server was very kind and brought us a sample of their delicious chicken and dumpling soup. The wait is a little longer than your average restaurant but it's well worth it! Your order is made when you order it NOT way in advance and reheated. Most of us got the chicken and waffles which were both absolutely amazing! The chicken was flavorful, not overcooked, and even for the breast I ordered it wasn't dry! Waffles were fluffy and had a hint of sweetness with an added touch of powdered sugar and butter. We all ordered sides of greens and Mac and cheese. Phenomenal!! The mixed greens were well prepared with a great taste of vinegar and even chunks of pork it was cooked down with. The Mac and cheese was to die for! Cheesy and delicious! We also had the cornbread which was so fluffy and moist it was almost like a cupcake! 

Overall a great experience for my last day of work in Pittsburgh. I appreciate the server treating us like regulars and the chef for preparing a wonderful meal for all of us. I know for sure that everyone that was there will be returning and bringing newbies there to get hooked!"}
{"text":"A very nice local restaurant with a homey atmosphere,  and very flavorful food. However, the service was so slow  I docked them a star."}
{"text":"The service is really friendly, but it's also very slow. Don't eat here if you're in a hurry. That said, it is authentic, quality, delicious soul food. I swear the chicken and dumpling soup has healing powers."}
{"text":"A friend and I stopped by for lunch recently. We were excited by the menu selections and choices available. And the food was fantastic. I ordered the Shrimp and Grits. This dish was served with nicely seasoned and slightly spicy shrimp atop a bed of wonderfully creamy cheese grits. Made my mouth dance with flavors. There also was a large piece of not-too-sweet cornbread to accompany this dish. My friend, being a vegetarian. had the macaroni and cheese and also the fried corn. She loved both. I recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for all the flavor without all the over done hoopla. Way thumbs up to the chef!"}
{"text":"The chicken and waffles is just plain delicious!"}
{"text":"My friends and I came here on a Sunday morning, mainly because everything else on Western was closed, but we were not disappointed! Lucky for us we were among the first few tables in the restaurant, because around noon every single table was filled! 
I had the grilled stuffed chicken breast with candied yams. The chicken and yams were great! The stuffing I wasn't crazy about, but it did not ruin the dish. The cornbread was so sweet and terrific, a perfect compliment. The real winner for me was the chicken and dumpling soup. 
I love the addition of so many veggies, and the soulful flavors! 
I will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"I was visiting friends in Pittsburgh and all they could talk about was this place and the chicken and waffles! They took me on a Sunday morning and I have to say I was a little unsure when we pulled up out front. Driving by you'd think it was nothing more than a dive bar!

We were greeted immediately and seated. Both the hostess and waitress were nice and welcoming. We ordered drinks and meals right away because we were obviously there for the famous chicken and waffles. I've never had chicken and waffles and the first thought of them actually wasn't to appetizing. 

The wait for the food was a bit long, but it is cooked to order which I love. Fresh! It was totally worth the wait, because once I took the first bite I was in HEAVEN. How can two opposite foods blend so nicely? I don't even care. I left and my belly was full.

Unlike the outside of the place, the inside was warm and decorated nicely. I loved some of the wall decor pieces. I would eat here again!"}
{"text":"This place has fantastic food I was so amazed on how everything tasted you want to talk about real southern style cooking this is it my favorite is the smothered chicken and I always get this fish stew they have. It's a little pricey but good and the staff is very very nice. I have nothing negative about this place. Only downfall is a chicken takes awhile to cook but you know you getting something fresh on your plate and not sitting under a heat lamp waiting to be served"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Pittsburgh. The shrimp and grits is amazing, but the fish and grits were a little bland. Their fried chicken is fantastic, well seasoned and delicious. Their mashed potatoes are very good. I love their chicken and dumpling soup, it's one of my favorite soups ever. Though ironically, I think it can be better without the dumplings. I find the dumplings kind of doughy whereas I prefer something light and fluffy. I have a friend who really likes their stuffed pork chops, but I think they're just okay, not the best thing on the menu. Their mac n' cheese is one of the cheesiest mac n' cheeses I've ever had. I wish their corn bread was more moist but it's still pretty good. Overall, would recommend."}
{"text":"My boyfriend was craving some soul food, so we stopped by for a late lunch after visiting the Mattress Factory. It was a nice restaurant and the waitress was friendly and attentive.

I ordered the grilled tilapia with sides of sweet potato fries and mixed greens. My boyfriend got a fried chicken breast with cornbread stuffing and mashed potatoes. 

The fish and chicken were cooked well. Tender, well flavored, and a crispy skin on the chicken. I enjoyed my sweet potato fries a lot. They were crispy outside, soft inside, and perfectly seasoned (that is to say, barely seasoned ;) ). However, the greens were too salty for me. I forced myself to eat them because they were the only vegetables I'd have for the meal. My boyfriend's sides were good but not outstanding. 

We left the restaurant feeling stuffed (and I'd been pretty hungry beforehand). Overall, a nice lunch. I wouldn't mind going back again, but I'm definitely getting sweet potato fries!"}
{"text":"I must say the place is a must.  The food was delicious and the service was awesome. I felt like I was in the south for a moment."}
{"text":"I was highly disappointed in this restaurant.
Based on the positive reviews here on Yelp, my wife and I stopped here last Friday for a late lunch (1:20 p.m.).
We both had chicken:  me the chicken (breast) and waffles, she the chicken (breast) with 2 sides.
We were seated immediately, and the server was very pleasant.
After ordering, we waited 35 minutes for our meals (a bit too long, in my opinion, but hey, I'm thinking I'm waiting on SW Pa's best chicken, according to Yelpers, so it'll be worth it).
Finally our food arrived.
My wife's salad and side (fried corn) were good.  The waffle was good.  I was expecting some type of homemade sauce/gravy with the waffle.  Nope.  The chicken and waffles, as served, consisted of a chicken breast and a Belgian waffle with a sparse sprinkling of powdered sugar.  The pancake syrup is on the table.
Speaking of the fried chicken, the 2 fried chicken breasts we were served ranked very high amongst the WORST we have ever had.  Not very much meat on them, and on the dry side.  One would think after waiting 35 minutes, the restaurant would have the decency to serve us a freshly breaded, freshly fried piece of chicken.  I got the impression we were both served chicken left over from the earlier lunch crowd.  A takeout chicken breast from Giant Eagle would put these 2 poor excuses for fried chicken to shame.
Next time I want chicken & waffles, I'll stop at the Iggle for a piece of takeout, and eat it at home with a homemade Belgian waffle."}
{"text":"Best chicken and waffles I have ever had. The waffle melts in your mouth and the chicken is fried to perfection. Even the soups are tasty. The service makes me feel like I belong and I'm part of the family. So good and cheap pricing. Will be returning soon."}
{"text":"I would rate the food 5 stars (hands down).....but that's not all that comes with a running a business, UNFORTUNATELY!!! I went with my friend (we are CAUCASIAN) and our three kids (two 3 year olds and a 20 month old). WORST place to be with kids, NOT A FAMILY ORIENTED PLACE AT ALL( IF YOU HAVE KIDS)! Our kids are well disciplined, mind you but we were seated first and it took 20 minutes or so before the waitress even brought over crayons or even acknowledged we had kids and their needs. We came from the Children's Museum so the kids were starving to say the least. I ask the waitress to bring some crackers until the food came and she told me I would have to wait since they were busy (there were  only a few tables occupied mind you). I had to ask three different waitress's for crackers before we even seen our first pack. I asked for extra napkins for the kids and again had to ask the hostess and 3 waitress's for extra napkins, they gave us two napkins for a table of 5 (with three kids mind you)!

We arrived there at 515pm and did not get out of this miserable place until 645pm. When we were seated the waitress did not give us her name but the family that was seated next to us and after us (who were African American mind you) was greeted in a cheerful tone and gave this family her name..lol..we couldn't believe it!!!! In an hour and a half we seen our waitress twice and only had the opportunity to refill our drinks twice (in 1 1/2hrs of waiting)! 

I asked to speak with the Manager (Carla) and I expressed our concerns with the kids and the ATTITUDES AND UNFRIENDLYNESS STAFF and all she could care about was the food. This was the ABSOLUTE WORST RESTURAUNT TO BE IN (if you have kids) and by far THE WORST AND I MEAN WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE! Wait, the funny thing about this was as we were waiting on our bill to come (took about 40 minutes or so from the time we were done eating) we heard the families around us complaining about orders being messed up and how long it was taking to get extra things they needed at their tables!!! 

I usually do not write reviews, but definitely felt the need to do a review for this place. Again, food was good (a bit pricey) but NOT WORTH ANOTHER VISIT! THERE ARE OTHER GOOD SOUL FOOD REST IN DA BRG that have good food and great customer service!"}
{"text":"Went here randomly after going kayaking on the water. It was the best soul food I have had in a while. This will be my new location when I am looking for my soul food fix!"}
{"text":"Wow!!!! We had the chicken and waffles and the shrimp and grits. The chicken and waffles are the best the I have had in the city. The fried chicken was very good, crispy, and was very moist. The shrimp and grits were very well seasoned and served the a great tasting slice of cornbread.  The wait staff was exceptional and was very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu items."}
{"text":"Our first visit, found out only opened a few weeks ago at new location. Corn bread and sides were great. Soup was great as well as fried green tomatoes. Fried chicken was extremely dry and barely eatable, good thing we had gravy on the side. Will try again in a month or so. Friendly staff and nice place."}
{"text":"The food here is only OK.  As a person from the south, this is not really good southern cooking at all, it's mediocre at best.  I gave it several tries just to see if I was catching them on an off day, and each time it was just mediocre.  The wings are pretty tasty though, but the gravy has too much garlic powder, the mac n cheese taste like its made with velveeta and not actual sharp cheddar cheese, and the service is lackluster.  Not to mention you are charged a small fee for paying with a card, whether its credit or debit even though their posted sign sayd credit card.  For the price of the food, that fee should be calculated in their and not on top of your final bill."}
{"text":"Had the chicken and waffles for breakfast. Both were delicious. Friendly service. Definitely will be back"}
{"text":"The food here is always spectacular. I almost always get the smothered fried chicken with fried corn and mac and cheese. The chicken is perfectly seasoned and crisp, and the gravy puts the chicken over the top. It comes with fluffy and sweet cornbread. The greens are good too. I've also enjoyed the fried catfish.

The dinner entree comes with soup, which may be the best part. The fish stew is not to be missed! It is so flavorful and slightly spicy. 

My only complaint is that the service/kitchen is slow. It is worth the wait, but you just have to mentally prepare yourself to hang out for a while before your food arrives."}
{"text":"Just ate at Camri for the first time and we will absolutely be back!  We had the shrimp and grits and the stuffed chicken, both cooked perfectly with great flavor! Mixed greens and chicken and dumpling soup were on point!  Our waiter did a great job but seemed like he could have used a little help as he was taking on a lot of tables. It seemed as if it was busy for a Tuesday night so maybe that had something to do with it.  We Will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"I will start off by saying that the food was actually pretty good. I suggest getting the chicken and waffles. But the service that I received was so terrible that I wouldn't even think about coming back to this restaurant. Not only did it take almost an hour for our food to come, but the servers and even the manager were terrible. It's a disorganized mess. Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"I too had a wonderful experience with this restaurant! The food was awesome and the price was even better! I was shocked at how much food you got for the price (not saying to change though). I ordered the fried chicken and my hubby got the ribs. Neither of us were disappointed (though I am going to try the ribs next time). I would definetly recommend this restaurant for the relaxed atmosphere, good food, great price and service! Way to go Carmi's!"}
{"text":"updated review 
Went for brunch it was packed we were immediately seated at the bar. Service was good. There was live music. My order was messed up and was served with grilled and not fried chicken but I was brought fried chicken in 5 min. I was very happy with the wait time for food and service ! The food was delicious as always !"}
{"text":"First of All: BYOB.  Second, like those before me have proclaimed, \"THIS IS THE CITY'S BEST MAC AND CHEESE!\"  The ribs were really good too, as well as the greens and the corn bread. The chicken & dumpling soup was easily the best I've had in a while and I'd go back just for their fish stew.  The candied yams and rice & beans were less exciting, however, and the desserts are for sure worth skipping  But man, what a lot of good food you get with a dinner entree. 

You definitely can't complain about the food or the pricing, but the room is really ugly and the lighting is a disaster, they have super bright energy saving bulbs in these low hanging lamps over each table that make you feel like you're in an interrogation room, and the service is slowwwww-perfectly friendly but slowww.  I feel like some of the servers just have no idea what is expected of them from the customer stand-point as far as setting the table, checking on drinks and making sure you have been served all the many sides you picked out in the beginning. 

Overall not a bad experience, especially since they keep posting groupons for dinners for four for around 30 bucks!  If I lived on the Northside, I would have a hard time not getting take out from here often."}
{"text":"Good: Food was pretty good overall. Blackened Salmon was one of the best I've ever had.. Sides portion are great. Good cozy vibe.  Bad: waitstaff was horrible, order was asked us 3 times. Upon packing up leftovers a full bowl of greens were dropped.  I proceeded to clean up own mess, with no assistance from staff that seen incident. NO attempt to replace literally full order of greens nor even a apology and offer to take off check..  Its good customer service to make all attempts to fix a incident before customer leaves.. 2 times visiting this location and I wont be back."}
{"text":"It isn't often that I am compelled to write a review, but this place actually exceeded my expectations!!  The chicken and waffles were absolutely perfect as was my side of mac n' cheese.  They have a simple concept; really good food, done well, with good service, that isn't pretentious or over priced. I can't wait to go back!! :-)"}
{"text":"The food is absolutely delicious. I had smothered chicken (breast and wing) with smashed potatoes and Mac and cheese, all which also came with a salad and corn bread. Everything was so delicious. Rivals (or even beats) some of my favorite South Carolina southern food stops! While the decor is nothing extraordinary, do not let that stop you from trying this place out. 

My boyfriend and I came across Carmi's by chance. Craving fried chicken this was the only option that seemed conveniently available beyond fast food. All we had to judge on were the past Yelp reviews so we were a little wary. All expectations were blown away. This now ranks in our favorite places to have eaten together. We will definitely be returning again!"}
{"text":"If I was ever wrongly accused of a serious crime and had to pick my last meal it would be chicken & waffles, baked mac & cheese, and grits from Carmi. Hot sauce & syrup on everything. A+++

But on a serious note... Every now and then you have a meal that is so good you just can't live without it. Carmi's is that meal for me. There was a point and time I was coming here AT LEAST once a week. 

They have the best fried chicken you will ever have. It is perfectly crispy, greasy and flavorful. The chicken stays hot the entire meal, it's simply amazing! 

The sides are all incredible as well. The candied yams are a tasty explosion for your taste buds, the cornbread is perfectly moist and fluffy but for me my go to is the baked mac and cheese with hot sauce. Just wow.... 

I have lived in Pittsburgh for many years and I've eaten chicken and waffles with baked mac and cheese from Carmi at least 100 times easily I kid you not. All the food is cooked fresh and made to order so there is a bit of a wait but it is well worth it! Carmi for the win!!!"}
{"text":"Just didn't live up to the hype. The food was ok. My salmon was dry, my husband's shrimp and grits looked like a bowl of grease and was devoid of flavor. The waffles were good and my daughter did like her pork chops. The sides were pretty good. The service was terrible. Our server was also the host and that was too much for him to handle (15 minutes to grab some Splenda, really?) The staff seemed ill-equipped and the crowd wasn't large. I hope they get better because they are not ready for summer on the Southside."}
{"text":"Had breakfast today - the Carmi Breakfast.. pretty good.   Bacon was crispy just how I requested .. and no shortage there.

I liked the potato's .. well done and not too much spice nor bland.  They were just right.. and easy to eat.    Slightly above average in price but well worth it."}
{"text":"We visited Carmi from out of town for weeknight dinner, and were super pleased with our choice.  There aren't many places to eat good soul food in our area so this place was a refreshing change, for sure.  To start, I ordered the chicken & dumplings soup which was INSANELY good and a perfect starter before my smothered chicken entree.  The chicken was perfectly fried, covered in super flavorful gravy, and the cornbread made the entire meal!  For sides, I ordered the green beans and macaroni and cheese, which were good but overshadowed a bit by the rest of my meal's tastiness.  Overall, service was good and the server was great about letting us know how long our food would take to prepare, which was well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Seriously, this place has the best comfort food in the city. Amazing fried chicken, fantastic Mac N Cheese (probably the best mac n cheese I've ever had!), unbelievable smashed potatoes. Plus, each entree comes with a huge buttery hunk of cornbread.

I've been coming here off and on for the past couple of years and Carmi blows me away every time. The waitstaff is super friendly and the portions are generous. I never leave here unhappy, and I've made this restaurant my go-to for my birthday dinner because nothing makes me feel better about getting older quite like some chicken and waffles that are so good, you swear your own grandmother is making them for you.

I cannot recommend this place enough. I tell everyone I know to come here. Even friends of mine who are more health conscious have made exceptions to come here and indulge in the fried chicken.

You won't be disappointed if you come here."}
{"text":"I absolutely loove this place. The chicken & dumpling soup is always my go to. Unbelievably savory & filling. Then of course the chicken & waffles dish is my absolute favorite. My hubby had the smothered chicken with greens & stuffing. I could not keep my hands out of his plate. This is a place i will continuously come to for food!!"}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever had anywhere in the city. I have been here for almost 2 hours. My table just got soup. I ordered a salad. My friends have already finished their soup. Still don't have a salad. So disappointed. Came here bc of the city paper review. WILL NEVER EVER COME BACK AND PLAN ON TELLING EVERYONE HOW SHITTY THIS SERVICE WAS. Still don't have a salad. Seething rage hanger is real. REAL REAL. I don't remember the last time I didn't tip less than 20%. Now I will. Server finally brought salad, 15 min later. With wrong dressing. I'm going to die of starvation.


***Edit after eating food. I would rather eat at KFC. The iceberg lettuce salad was the best thing I had. Got here at 2, leaving at 4:15."}
{"text":"We ate here on a Sunday at around noon and it is worth the trip just for the amazing quality of food. The carmi burger is both unique and one of the best burgers I've had in Pittsburgh. The meatloaf was juicy and delicious. Best sweet potato fries I've had in Pittsburgh. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Great food.  The waiter Ty was a boss.  We loved it.  Turkey Ribs, Mac and Cheese...they nice with it."}
{"text":"I bought the groupon.  The chicken, waffles, cornbread made it worth it.
The mac and cheese will make me come back.  

omg, that mac and cheese."}
{"text":"Great food!! The fried catfish is delicious. Sweet potato pie that will the best you've ever had. My brother had shrimp and grits and he loved it. Nice people, good food and great atmosphere make this place a favorite. You can't go wrong with southern soul food."}
{"text":"Delicious food and friendly service. Can't wait to go again. 
I had the chicken and waffles and split sides of greens, candied yams, cornbread stuffing and mac and cheese. Everything appeared homemade and the portions were generous."}
{"text":"I went to an event that had catered food from Carmi's and it was EXCELLENT! I had the tasty and crispy fried chicken with wonderfully sweetened yams, flavorful green beans, not-so-spicy jambalaya, cheesy Mac n cheese, and who could forget---banana pudding! I had not one complaint! My next adventure will be to actually travel to this restaurant and try something different on the menu. But now you know, they cater ;)"}
{"text":"Better than ever!

We hadn't be in a while so we decided to visit Carmi again after church on Sunday. After we parked and were walking to the door we all noticed the new sign outside. Upon entering we were greeting by Gospel Music playing and were all pleasantly surprised by the updated decor. The walls are now two different shades of brown and a dark red. The ceiling is chocolate brown and there are new table coverings, lighting and even new menus with the husband and wife team on the cover. Keionna was our waitress and she took good care of us.

We started out with Sweet Tea for our drinks. My wife and I both went with the Fried Chicken dinner which comes with soup or salad, two sides and cornbread. For sides I had fried corn and mac & cheese and she had mac & cheese and greens. Our daughter got the chicken and waffles.

I went with the chicken and dumpling soap and the wife got a salad. The soap was simply delicious. The last time I got it, it was way too peppery. This time it was perfect.

Now let me tell you about that chicken. I don't know what they changed but it was better than ever! The skin was nice and crispy and the chicken was hot and tender. The mac & cheese was also better then I remembered. My only complaint was that the fried corn could have been fried for a few more minutes. It wasn't cooked quite long enough for my liking. My wife loved her chicken, greens and mac & cheese as well. 

And of course our daughter was pleased with her meal as she tried to save half of her food for later but, just couldn't resist finishing it off. My wife and I could only finish half of our food and took the rest home.

All and all our food was very, very good and better than ever. I won't wait so long  before we return. I must say after this visit I can honestly say that Carmi Family Restaurant is THE BEST SOUL FOOD RESTAURANT IN PITTSBURGH!!!"}
{"text":"This is the best place for chicken and waffles in the city! Plus, the family that owns and runs the place seems awesome.

I constantly tell my friends about this place, because I want them to stay in business. Now, you should go there too since I want to keep my chicken and waffle addiction going for the foreseeable future. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Where do I begin?? I am in love with this place. Hands down, the best fried chicken I've ever had in my life. Best chicken and waffles. Best soul food. Best comfort food. I can go on. 

Seriously, you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. But if you absolutely cannot decide, I say you have to try the fried chicken, whether it's the dinner or the chicken and waffles. They season the chicken to perfection and the batter is crispy, yet light and the meat is oh so moist. The sides are magical, particularly the candied yams and mixed greens (kale and collard). Not to mention the chicken and dumpling soup, which is comfort in a bowl. When you're in need of some good, stick to your ribs, comfort food, you have to come here. 

Now, the space isn't fancy but the food makes up for it. As soon as you take a bite of the food, it will transport you to a warm place so you won't even notice the lack of decor here. There is definitely a warm feeling you get when dining here, like you're being taken care of by a loving grandmother. I don't even know how else to describe it. 

I absolutely love this place and have not had anything I didn't like!"}
{"text":"Food is excellent!  We started going to Carlo when it was in the north side. It has moved to the south side. Honestly I think they need to step it up a little service was much better on the north side. The food is still good. I just feel like they need some time maybe to get caught up with the booming business."}
{"text":"We stopped in after a friend recommended, it was well worth it. Our group had the chicken dumpling soup, talapia, smothered pork chops, mac and cheese, and cornbread. All delicious.  We'll be back on out next trip to the burgh."}
{"text":"Carmi lived up to the word of mouth recommendations from friends. The stuffed chicken breasts with cornbread stuffing and gravy were delicious. The cornbread side and Mac-n-Cheese were incredible! Soups were appetizing, but I would pass on the fried corn or salads. Great meal, great service, great location."}
{"text":"Carmi is everything described as wonderful ! Had the scrumptious fried chicken with greens and potato salad. Cooked perfectly wonderfully tender and not greasy. Keisha our server told us it would be 22 minutes to cook the breast our expectations were managed and we let the feast begin! Delicious!!"}
{"text":"I have had my eye on this restaurant for a little bit . We were truly hungry for some comfort food. We came during dinner time on a Tuesday . I think it was around 430pm so the restaurant was pretty empty. 
We were seated immediately and they came to take our orders fast. We ordered chicken and waffles with collard greens. My boyfriend ordered catfish and grits . The food came out hot and ready to eat. I have to say if you have not come here, you need to. My waffle was big and fluffy . The chicken was juicy and crispy on the outside. It was like my grandma made it. The catfish was crispy and very big. The grits were very good but somewhat oily so be aware of that. 
The meal was not overly expensive. It was comparable to what you'll see on the southside. This place is a hidden gem"}
{"text":"What an outstanding experience! This is a small restaurant in a nondescript area of the city. They advertise their menu as soul food. The experience made soul food my preferred menu selection whenever I ever have the choice again the future.

We were a party of four. We had fried chicken, chicken smothered in gravy, chicken with waffle, and spicy grilled shrimp on a bed of grits. The food was amazing! All four of us were impressed. It exceeded our expectations. We are still talking about it four days later. The service was friendly, efficient, and genuinely attentive. The prices were reasonable and the ambiance was comfortable. We are going to make an effort to go there again before we return home to California. I highly encourage anyone in the Pittsburgh area to seek out this place. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"We were in Pittsburgh for the zoo and aviary. We were looking for something a bit different and Carmi's came up. Luckily it was only a few minutes away so we got to avoid the rush-hour traffic! Nice place with earth tone colors. The music is RandB and the place is clean! We ordered a salad ( mixed green with ranch), fried chicken, BBQ chicken, yams, potato salad, but killer Mac and cheese,corn bread and fried corn!"}
{"text":"Came here today and was very impressed. I got the chicken and waffles for breakfast and went with the 3 wing option for my chicken.

Chicken was very juicy and flavorful. Cooked and flavored just right for me. Definitely good enough for me to go back and eating as is with no sauce(or no waffles). My only regret was not having more of it to eat.

The waffle was also good. Had the right amount of crispy and soft to it for me and the butter and powdered sugar really added to the taste.

Food took a little longer than I would have expected, but they had a note up on their tables explaining that they care about the taste of what they're cooking and aren't going to rush it. I was a little surprised by this because my group came in with only one other group already in the place since we got there very early on a Sunday morning. Definitely able to tell that they put the time into the food and it made the wait well worth it since it tasted perfect.

I consider myself to be a big chicken and waffles fan and I'd come away saying that they either have the best or second best in Pittsburgh.

Service was good and it was nice inside- bigger than I expected from just looking at the outside.

No question I would return again. Maybe not if I was in a hurry, but it's a place I really enjoyed. I would love to come back at a later time and try the dinner menu for sure."}
{"text":"I ordered the fried tilapia with candies yams and mac&cheese. The did not enjoy the tilapia because of how mushy and unseasoned it was but the sides were delicious but not HOT enough. Overall the restaurant was very nice including wonderful r&b music."}
{"text":"Corn bread and Mac &Cheese was awesome. Enjoyed the meatloaf dinner. A very pleasant staff. Will be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"I had the chicken breast, Mac N Cheese and yams. Chicken was great and hot. Mac was kinda bland and yams weren't the best."}
{"text":"I recently visited Pittsburgh and made sure to stop by Carmi. The service was amazing (it still takes a while to get your food but I think that's just the nature of good, fresh fried chicken) - our waiter checked in on us often and made sure we had our drinks filled and everything. And the food was as delicious as always."}
{"text":"Omg. I just love this place! The first time I came here was on a Sunday afternoon. The restaurant was packed with people after leaving church, all dressed up in their Sunday's best. There was such a happy, positive, vibe all around. Our waitress was friendly. The food.. oh man..the food. Our meals came with soup or salad, a main meat, 2 sides, and corn bread.  So I had chicken dumpling soup, BBQ chicken, greens, Mac and cheese, and corn bread. WHOA!! The cornbread it soft and has jalapeños in it and is not dry or crummy like others I've had. Needless to say, everything was amazing. You really can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"You have to check this place out! I came here for lunch with a co-worker and we loved it! The food was AMAZING, the service was great, the music was excellent, and the decor and ambiance were fantastic! I got the blackened cajun tilapia (it was HUGE) with the collard greens (best I've ever had) and a side salad. Everything was so yummy! Our food arrived on time and our drinks were always full. We loved everything about this place and we can't wait to come back again!"}
{"text":"Yummy shrimp and grits and friendly service.  The mac and cheese is the real thing.  Wish I lived nearby so I could go back again soon."}
{"text":"I want to cry, it was so good.

I came here for the specific purpose of trying out chicken and waffles. To be honest, I don't \"get\" what the big deal is with this combination. Next time, I'll just get the chicken meal with a couple bowls of their greens and macaroni. See what I mean? Haven't digested my meal and I'm already planning out my next visit. I'm lucky I live far away from Carmi's, or the south in general, otherwise I'd weigh a million pounds. 

Pros: The food is the real deal. Excellent soul food at reasonable prices, made to order. And they're honest about their shortcomings, like telling us there will be about a 20 minute wait for the food to cook, or that there's a 0.25 fee for using cards, which is reasonable.

Cons: Come on, guys. You're getting rave reviews, you're in a cute neighborhood. Put some new booths in there, put some paint on the walls, some new lighting fixtures. Also, the staff is friendly and well-meaning but awkward. That's just something that comes with training and time."}
{"text":"I have been on a soul food kick lately, and it is being taken care of with a vengeance.

Since my friends all bailed, I got takeout from Carmi's. For 10.99  you can get fried chicken, 2 sides, cornbread and a soup! That is a DEAL! 

The chicken was perfectly fried and moist inside. Real Deal Holyfield right there. My sides were the yams (delicious!) and collard greens. The collard greens were very tasty, and rapidly becoming a favorite of mine. I will say they were slightly on the salty side however.

Cornbread was also moist and tasty. I ordered the  fish stew to get the full experience out of this, and I have never had something like that before. It had a full flavor, somewhat similar to a gumbo, though like the  greens, a little on the salty side. 

Still, for the price, you cant beat it."}
{"text":"This place is amazing ! Straight up soul food, try the shrimp and grits and chicken and waffles - the cornbread was phenomenal and they had a great selection of hot tea for breakfast which was impressive to me - we loved this entire experience - the place is frequented by locals and the staff is friendly and great ! You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"This place rocks. The chicken and waffles are the best in the city. The service is pretty terrible. I've waiting 10 minutes just to be seated when the restaurant was 80% empty. Not very customer oriented. Hopefully with the new location they will fix this. The food is good enough to still be a 5 star spot."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how long this place has been open, but I did not know about it until I saw a Groupon.  So I took my usual breakfast club for a visit after an overnight of working.  I wasn't sure what to expect when we walked in, and I'm guessing they do mostly dinner business.  (One of my friends commented that it looked like they got their artwork at Family Dollar.)  But the fact that they are open at 7am and offer chicken and waffles is enough for me to give it a try.

Our waitress was very nice, an older woman who we had fun with - and she had that jovial grandma laugh, too, which makes the place feel more cozy.  My friends all ordered the King's Breakfast that pretty much included everything on the breakfast menu (waffle or pancakes, two meats, eggs, potatoes and grits).  I kept it simple with the Chicken and Waffles and a side of bacon.  Oh, and a sweet tea.  The sweet tea was refreshing, with just a hint of lemon.  The bacon was thick and crispy, the way it should be (the menu said 2 strips of bacon were a side, but I got three!).  The waffle was good, nothing over the top, but the chicken, oh the chicken....it was glorious.  I got to select the piece I wanted and I opted for the breast.  It was moist on the inside, crispy on the outside.  And whatever the seasoning is, they got it right.  I couldn't rave about it enough to our waitress.  I asked for hot sauce, and then really didn't feel I needed it.  My friends seemed equally pleased with their meals as well.

I will definitely recommend this place.  The prices weren't too outrageous.  My Chicken and Waffles was $6.99, the side of bacon was $1.99.  The King's Breakfast was $9.99.  The main reason I deducted one star is the wait.  It seemed like our food took a very long time when we were the only ones there.  It could be because we ordered so much food or that we got there shortly after they opened at 7am and the kitchen wasn't quite prepared.  Whatever the reason, I won't hold it against Carmi and I will certainly be back for more of that amazing chicken."}
{"text":"Dine at Carmi's it's literally across the street from Nicky's Thai on Western ave on the Northside.

The food is so good here, so amazingly well prepared such attention to detail.  I would  love to see a Black owned business thrive and be around for generations in the Northside.

I treated my mom out to lunch here today and we were literally the only two diners for lunch.  In the hour in a half that we were there no one else even came into the restaurant.   It just breaks my heart that more people aren't dining here.  Yes the restaurant is easy to miss because it's still decorated like the Shamrock Inn and the Shamrock Inn signage still exists on the building. 

Wow it just blows my mind that this place isn't more packed.  I have noticed that Carmi now has a people love us on Yelp sticker in their window and that makes me proud.  \\

My mom had the fried talipia, fish stew, candied yams and greens I had the blacked talipia and double greens with chicken and dumpling soup.

$35 for lunch the value for your money is the best in Pittsburgh hands down and we still had left overs to take home and banana pudding too."}
{"text":"The inside of this restaurant looks like a grandma's dining room, complete with linoleum tables. 

The bathroom is very old school and not wheel-chair accessible. There are a ton of fruit flies that must dig the air fresheners.

I'll break this review down into two areas: the service and the food.

The Service:
It took 15 minutes to receive my first glass of water, and 45 minutes after that for a refill.
They tell you up front that the food will take a long time to come out, but that doesn't excuse the poor service. The wait staff avoided eye contact and spent the majority of the 3 hours hovering by the kitchen. 
After our food arrived, the waitress didn't ask if we had all we needed, so we had to flag her down for basic condiments. 
Once we received the check, it took 25 minutes for the waitress to pick up the payment. My 92 year old grandfather ran out of patience.

The Food:
The fried chicken was excellent. Crispy and flavorful, without excess grease. 
The macaroni and cheese, yams, corn bread, and French fries were great!
The pork chop tasted like fried flour. If you order shrimp and grits, make sure you bring your own shrimp. The bowl was large, with tasty presentation, but just 6 shrimp in a sea of grits won't fill you up. 
The waffle was heavy and bland. The combination is nothing like Roscoe's. 

Decent food, ruined by the saltiness of the service."}
{"text":"This is the best soul food in Pittsburgh. I've been here several times for dinner and have had an amazing meal each time. This is not a quick in and out kind of place. They prepare their food with love, it is worth the time it takes to prepare. Relax and enjoy your company. 

You will not leave hungry. The shrimp & grits is a huge portion of savory, cheddary goodness. It is good. But the show stopper is the chicken. Fried chicken, chicken and dumpling soup, greens, and corn bread. That is really all you need to die happy (and stuffed). The chicken is juicy and very flavorful.  (If you get the chicken breast, be warned, it takes quite a long time.) It is just feel good southern food. 

A heads up, I hear they are going to be relocating to the South Side. It breaks my heart to lose this neighborhood gem."}
{"text":"Wow!  I don't give many 5 stars reviews, but Carmi's definitely deserves this rating.  There was NOTHING bad about my meal.  OMG, I sorry that I don't live in Pittsburgh, so that I could eat here more often!  The Yelp reviews were spot on!   The restaurant is very unassuming, had I not seen the reviews, I never would have given this place a second thought.  The exterior and interior decor don't give this place the credit it deserves.  Don't get me wrong, the place was spotless, the decor was just dated and a bit dark as other reviewers have stated, but nevertheless, I would return over and over again.  I ordered the stuffed pork chop entree, which came with soup or salad, (I chose soup), 1 side, I chose greens and also ordered a separate side of the mac n' cheese that all of the reviews raved about.  The chicken dumpling soup was EXCELLENT. It was flavorful, full of noodles, dumplings, chicken and veggies, the underlying soup base was to die for!  There was a bit of a wait for the entree, but not that long, maybe 15 minutes or so.  The wait was well worth it.  My food arrived hot, fresh and oh so delicious.  I received 2 fried pork chops with a generous helping of homemade stuffing in between and covered in delicious gravy.  The pork chops were tender, and seasoned perfectly.  The stuffing was tasty as well, it was a little more sweet than I'm used to, but still delicious.  I'm assuming that the stuffing is made from the same cornbread served on the side of each entree, which was also sweet (and tasty).  The mixed greens were mouthwatering good.  Tender, seasoned and a bit vinegary....just perfect.  I thought that my grandmother, might be in the kitchen!   Last but not least the mac n cheese definitely lived up to the Yelp review, cooked perfectly, with just the right amount of cheesy goodness. Also the sweet tea was a perfect accompaniment to my meal. My server Kesha was prompt, courteous and could not have been any nicer.  The only downside was that there was only 1 option for dessert, banana pudding, which I'm sure would have been tasty, but I'm not a big fan of banana pudding.  I was hoping for some homemade sweet potato pie, pound cake, or peach cobbler.  All in all this was a GREAT meal.  I will definitely return (can't wait!)"}
{"text":"Delicious food at very reasonable prices.  I particularly loved the greens, they were excellent.  The sweet potato fries were unbelievably great.  The waitress and owner were both very friendly.  I got the ribs, which were very tender.  The portions are big."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to go to Carmi's for about 3 years, and finally made it there. Our server was Ty, and he was very nice and helpful. There is a sign that lets you know that the food is made fresh, and that it may take a while. It was absolutely worth the wait. We got chicken and dumplings, fried chicken, meatloaf, two servings of Mac n cheese, two pieces of cornbread, one serving of mashed potatoes, and one serving of fried corn. What impressed me the most was how well everything was seasoned. Nothing was even remotely bland. They aren't afraid of salt and pepper. I'm not big into cornbread, but I would eat this cornbread any time. Fried chicken was juicy and had a nice crunchy breading, potatoes were awesome, gravy was super smooth, meatloaf was so unique and melted in your mouth, corn was nice and crisp, and the Mac n cheese was just what you would expect... perfect! Eat here, like right now. Make sure you come ravenous because there is plenty of food"}
{"text":"Had lunch here and got the shrimp and grits and the roasted corn..AMAZING!!! The food was awesome and I cannot wait to try more of it!"}
{"text":"This place is GREAT! A friend had his rehearsal dinner here a few years ago and I have been hooked ever since. I would definitely recommend the fried catfish as well as their greens and yams. Staff is friendly and very accommodating. And the price is very affordable as well."}
{"text":"One of my weaknesses is some good fried chicken & waffles so Carmi's has been on my list for awhile now since I always hear how this place is one of the best for soul food! Finally got to try it one afternoon when I was around the area. And of course it didn't disappoint. I got the fried chicken and waffles and it was so good! The chicken skin was so crispy and the meat on the inside stays super moist and tender. It was a busy afternoon so the servers were running a little bit behind with everyone but the foods were so good it didn't even matter!"}
{"text":"Went to Carmi's for brunch on Sunday and the BF and I were very happy with our meals. We both got the chicken & waffles with coffee. The BF said it was the best chicken & waffles he's ever had. I won't go quite that far, but it was really tasty!"}
{"text":"The food is AMAZING!  I love the fact that Carmi makes homemade meals!  We've also ordered family size trays for Thanksgiving and it was absolutely delicious!  Saved me a ton of work!  I recommend anyone who hasn't made it over to Carmi Family Restaurant and wants some good home cooking to make it your business to get there :)"}
{"text":"We went here with a mission... To try the chicken and waffles. So naturally, we didn't really need to check out the menu. However, I noticed it was a dinner menu around 11am. I thought that was odd for it being a Sunday, but I was okay with it because chicken and waffles was still available. I also ordered mac and cheese due to another Yelpers review. 

The wait for our food was longer than we are used to, but there was a sign that says food is cooked when ordered so it may take longer. The wait was completely worth it!!!

I can't even express how much I love the chicken and waffles. It's an unhealthy obsession. The breading on the chicken was light, crispy, and extremely flavorful. The actual chicken was so moist. The waffle.. Omg. Thick, crispy, and sweet. Un-believable! It was the best thing I've ever eaten!

The mac and cheese? Delicious! Super cheesy and homemade - just like it should be! 

The prices were incredible for the amount of food you get! The ambiance was diner-ish and dim, but the staff was friendly and on-point. We will definitely be back. And soon!"}
{"text":"I love Carmi.

Tonight was the third time I'd been there, but the first time for dinner. It was also the first time I didn't get the chicken & waffles and a side of cheesy grits (which, by the way, I LOVE. Like, want to marry it love).

So anyway, I really wanted to eat fried chicken, but I had just eaten fried chicken at a less desirable place for lunch (boo), so I decided to give the ribs a try. So, when you get an entree, you get either soup or salad, plus two sides and a big slab of cornbread.  I got the chicken & dumpling soup which was very, very tasty. For the sides, I chose the sweet potato fries and the mac & cheese. Um, the mac and cheese was THE. BOMB. For real. So good. I will say that I did not much like the sweet potato fries, but I felt like maybe it was just an off night for them - there were some in the basket that were really good, but most of them seemed underdone.  The cornbread? DELISH. I love cornbread and usually get it anywhere that it's available and this did not disappoint.

The ribs were also super good. Meaty and falling off the bone delicious. 

If you haven't been there. GO. Go for breakfast. Get the chicken and waffles. Eat cheesy grits. GO for lunch or dinner. Get the mac and cheese. Your life will be better for it. Seriously."}
{"text":"This food is amazing, the service is not bad either. But this food is on point. I'm gonna be spending a lot of money here!! Only down fall they don't accept American Express. But the food is amazing!!!"}
{"text":"I got the fried chicken (house favorite) with macaroni and greens. Very good - right amount of food. Great lunch option - looking forward to trying it for dinner.

Service was very nice, but it seems like they are still getting used to the flow of things - took awhile for someone to help me. And it was freezing.

I recommend it."}
{"text":"The best soulfood  in the city!! #shrimpngrits #chickenndumplingsoup #macncheese make u wanna slap yo mamma!!"}
{"text":"Oh the mac and cheese. I love the food here. Haven't found better soul food in pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Had fried tilapia, greens, yams and cornbread. I also tried my cousins cornbread stuffing. Everything was delicious. I wanted catfish but they only serve it on Friday and Sunday. I'm going back to try their catfish. I don't like the .25 cent charge for using your debit card but otherwise I like Carmi's. I usually get their chicken and waffles which I absolutely love."}
{"text":"Another restaurant I had been wanting to try out, because of the reviews on Yelp, and boy they didn't let me down.  I ordered the shrimp & grits and my daughter got the chicken and waffles.  While it was a bit of a wait it was well worth it, the chicken was well seasoned and the waffle made just right my daughter enjoyed it.  I don't even know where to begin on the shrimp & grits the grits had an explosion of flavor their is a lot of cheese and shrimp along with different spices, you get a large helping of shrimp and grits and a piece of cornbread on the side, there was so much I couldn't even finish it I had to take half of it home.  The chicken and waffles was around $8.95 and the shrimp & grits was around $9.85.  The shrimp & grits did have quite a bit of extra butter in it, but once you stir it up it's not bad.  Our waitress was friendly and made sure we had everything we needed and we will definitely be back to try some of the other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Based on the reviews, I thought I would fall in love with Carmi's. Overall I thought it was okay. I did not enjoy the fish stew as it was way too salty. In general, I felt everything was overloaded with salt. As everyone says, the mac-n-cheese is great and filling. I could only eat half of it. The ribs were pretty tasty too. The girls who served us were also  really helpful."}
{"text":"I was so excited to eat soul food, well I always am, truly. Yeah, I can cook it and find it in the south, but I wasn't home, was in the 'Burg for the game and wanted some that day! Shoot!

Food was really good. There were 3 of us, so I won't mention EVERYTHING we ordered, but just know the chicken, Waffle and chicken and dumpling soup was bomb. I don't 'DO' dumplings, but this concoction was so good. It had a creamy touch to it and noodles, so yeah...thanks for putting me on. 

Our service started out a little slow, but it ended up well. I think we all went back to the hotel and went to sleep after...#outtathere! Lol"}
{"text":"Fantastic chicken and waffles. Chicken was tender and moist. Wait-staff was friendly. This place does tend to be busy though so I would either call ahead or clear the evening."}
{"text":"The best Soul in Food in Pittsburgh. Try the chicken and waffles , you won't be disappointed. I haven't had anything that I wouldn't recommend. Eat your heart out with envy , I sure am."}
{"text":"For it being a soul food restaurant, I was pretty disappointed in the fried chicken, which I've gotten twice and still not as impressed as i thought I would be. The prices aren't very reasonable either. Honestly, you could get just as good if not better fried chicken from a Giant Eagle\fast food place for half the price. I do recommend the fish stew however. The fries are bad. Staff is friendly though. Takes a while to get your food too."}
{"text":"I have been wondering about Carmi for some time now, so we decided to give it a whirl for lunch today.  I have to say, despite the dark interior, and outside appearance, I was quite happy with our experience.  

I teetered on what to get but finally chose the Fried chicken (I got the breast) which came with 2 sides and a soup or salad. I got the greens and cornbread dressing.  My soup was the chicken and biscuit.  Everything was good.  My favorite part was the greens though.  

Service was polite and with a smile.  We will definitely be back sometime soon for some homemade Soul food!"}
{"text":"Fantastic. From start to finish, this was a great meal. The chicken and dumpling soup was out of this world. The flavor was great and it wasn't over or under seasoned, it was just right. Then came the fried chicken. I had the leg and thigh meal which came with two sides and cornbread. I had the Mac n cheese which was every bit as good as others have described and the potato salad.  Back to the chicken itself, great spices and very flavorful. Despite all of the food we had, I didn't feel horrible and sluggish afterwards which can happen sometimes with soul food. I don't know what they did differently, but I liked it!

Overall, great gem on the northside with friendly service and excellent food."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious, homemade soul food!  My husband & I have been to Carmi a handful of times, now, & I am yet to leave unimpressed or any less than totally stuffed!  Not a huge menu selection but perhaps a small menu is what keeps every meal tasting fabulous.  Thus far I've had shrimp & grits (spicy & delicious), fried tilapia (HUGE filet) & sides of greens (w smoked ham) & baked mac & cheese (*drool*).  My husband swears by the fried chicken.  Wait staff is very friendly & prices are reasonable.  Only downside is dated decor.  Maybe in time the owners will be able to afford some updating.  

Welcome to the neighborhood, Carmi!  Keep it up!"}
{"text":"What you see is what you get.  The soul food at Carmi's is simple and comforting, and every dish we tried was packed with flavor.  We found this to be an ideal destination for weekend brunch.  At 11:30AM, we were able to sample the lunch menu and some brunchy house specialties.

CHICKEN & WAFFLES: typical fluffy waffle with a huge mound of butter and 2 small piece of fried chicken.  We went with the thigh and leg combination.  Nothing mindblowing, but it hit the spot.  We asked for smothered sauce for the chicken, and they provided it on the side.

SMOKED PORK RIBS: 1 large rib and 2 small came drenched in a sweet barbecue sauce, with tender meat, although the small end piece we received was on the dry side.  Although this was delicious, the smokiness was missing, and we preferred the ribs we tried at Showcase BBQ.

CHICKEN & DUMPLING SOUP: oh so creamy and savory and delicious, this was the highlight of the meal for me.  Tastes as you would expect--like salty chickeny crack.  Only downside was the lack of actual dumplings--the bowl was filled with starchy noodles instead.  Not untasty, but not the same.  I would have preferred more creamy broth.

FISH STEW: this had a nice kick to it.  An intensely flavorful, gloppy concoction studded with okra.  No complaints.

STUFFED CABBAGE AND BEEF SOUP (daily special): tasted like stuffed cabbage in a soup.  What can I say?  It was delicious.

Our mountain of food came out to $30 with tax.  This place is a gem.  Come here with someone you don't mind staring at across a tiny two-person booth.  Sit back and enjoy the comfort food."}
{"text":"Carmi still has absolutely amazing food in my opinion, but the service is lacking sadly. Most of the wait staff are young teens and they just haven't been all that great the last few visits.

We were deciding on where to eat and my bf suggested Carmi's. There's no way ever I could say no to that so we left and headed to north side.

We were seated immediately. We looked over menus and decided what we wanted to order. No one greeted us or even offered drinks. After almost 15 minutes and no sign of our server, another server said 'she'll be out shortly' . Meanwhile a group of 4 other servers stood in the back staring at the dining room and even they didn't offer to greet us. How upsetting. I've been a server and understand sometimes someone is behind.. But other servers who clearly have nothing to do normally offer to help.. Atleast EVERYWHERE I've worked. 

My boyfriend ordered his normal chicken Entree with mac & green. He chose the chicken and dumpling soup which is still phenomenal omg!

I ordered the shrimp and grits trying to be on the healthy side. I also ordered a side salad. I wouldn't call their shrimp and cheddar grits healthy but they were great as well! I do wish more shrimp was in it though. My drink wasn't always filled through the meal though. 

Despite the really crappy service we are still in love with Carmi. I'll give them another chance for sure but I hope the servers can be more attentive and helpful."}
{"text":"The food was good but a bit overpriced.  We ordered a wing meal and a chicken (breast) and waffle.  The wings in the meal were very small and the chicken breast was mostly bone.  Just as another Yelper said, the pieces are tiny.  The sides (mac n cheese and candied yams) were EXCELLENT!  The side salad was fine. 

I wouldn't rush to go back unless I had a craving for soul food and didn't feel like making it myself.  They should really consider adding more chicken to their offerings to make it worth the $12 they charge for each meal.  Another recommendation would be for to-go waffle orders, the butter should be put in a separate container so as to not make it soggy when you finally eat it. 

I wish Pittsburgh had more soul food options because the one's I've visited are kinda sub-par for the prices they ask."}
{"text":"Visiting Pittsburgh and craving chicken and waffles, and I'm so glad we decided to come here. The waffle was super moist and delicious, and the fried chicken was very tasty, not greasy at all. Even my wife, who's not the biggest fan of chicken and waffles, thought the meal was great and cleaned her plate. We also had the cheese grits, which were pretty good. The wait for the food isn't that long, and we enjoyed their coffee in the meantime."}
{"text":"Carmi's is real deal soul food. The Fried Chicken, yams, Mac n' cheese, and chicken dumpling soup, are must haves. Pittsburgh doesn't have many options for southern food, however, we do have a place in Carmi's, that would stand up with any place below the Mason-Dixon Line."}
{"text":"I came here after visiting the Mattress Factory.  Given that I'm a huge fan of Southern/soul food, this place was high on my to-try list.  It certainly did not disappoint--nay, it exceeded my expectations!

I ordered the fried chicken, and it was truly wonderful--the best I've tasted in PGH to date!  The combination of crispiness on the outside and moistness on the inside, and the delicious flavor, was incredible.  For sides, I ordered the mashed potatoes and, of course, the macaroni and cheese.  This place has the best mac and cheese I've tasted in the city so far (rating: 9.5/10); it's just bursting with cheesiness, and it has a wonderfully creamy texture.  I took half home and it was just as good the next day.  The cornbread that came with the meal was moist and dense--just the way I like it.  In addition to all this, the meal came with a chicken and dumpling soup that was just as delicious as the rest of it.  Our servers were also nice and attentive, though the atmosphere could use some improvement (lighten up the place!)

I look forward to returning to try the chicken and waffles, since this is one of my favorite dishes.  Given the quality of the food, I'll be back soon--once I'm off my diet!"}
{"text":"Don't let the sketchy looking storefront deter you away--it is a bit dark inside, but the friendliness and food here will make you feel right at home. I haven't had soul food anywhere else in the city, so I have nothing to compare Carmi to; on the other hand, I am not sure that it needs any competition the way it is now. The waitresses and servers are extremely welcoming and attentive, and it's probably some of the best service I've had anywhere.

In terms of food, we came here at lunchtime, during which most entrees come with 2 sides. We tried their signature fried chicken and smoked ribs, along with sides of sweet potato fries, greens, fish stew, and candied yams. The chicken is definitely worth trying; I haven't had such juicy chicken in Pittsburgh, and probably in all western PA as they claim. In terms of sides, I thoroughly enjoyed the greens, candied yams, and fish stew. The ribs were so-so (probably better at Showcase), so next time I'll try something else like the tilapia."}
{"text":"This place is so wonderful!

First always order the chicken and dumpling soup because no one does it better in the city. Thick, rich and flavorful. 

The fried chicken is so amazing. Every side they offer is so delicious. Corn and greens are amazing.

I've eaten here 5x and have yet to be disappointed.  

Ps. The portions are large!

Just a heads up... everything is cooked to order so you'll be there a solid 40+ minutes.

Take your time, enjoy the music, family style ambiance and you will not be disappointed with this restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent!  I had the Shrimp and Grits and my husband had the Fried Chicken and Waffles.  They were both flavorful and well cooked. The food is obviously homemade. The staff is friendly and helpful. We will be back!  By the way BEST GREENS I've had in years!"}
{"text":"I ordered the three wings, greens and sweet potato fries. The wings are pretty small but I prefer to believe that means they are not juiced up with hormones. They were lightly  breaded which I liked. Not heavily seasoned pretty much just tastes like salt and black pepper. They were pretty good I could've eaten more though. The greens were yummy they use turkey meat and I believe vinegar I enjoyed it. The sweet potato fries had sugar on them which I thought was pretty gross but they were good if you cleaned off the sugar. 

The sweet tea is not brewed so you could pass on that.

The cornbread is delicious it is made with more finely ground cornmeal tastes like cake. 

The Mac and cheese is pretty good. I enjoyed that and repeatedly ate everyone else's."}
{"text":"Been there twice since my stay in Pitts let me tell you they food is A plus Leon really puts his foot in this chicken and Mac I'm not mad at all some times service is a Lil slow but the food makes it worth the while well be back for sure"}
{"text":"Man, I wish this was in Ohio or Wisconsin! Their food is delicious and you can tell they take their time with cooking because.. well, they took a long time to cook it! Try to be patient when you come here because the food does take at least 15 min. 

I got food to go and ordered fried chicken (3 wings), mac n cheese, and the stuffing. The chicken was really good, the mac n cheese.. I'm craving for more, and the stuffing was good but I do prefer mine more savory than sweet. 

Only negatives with my visit is that when a friend gave cash for her food, the wait time for the hostess to go back and get change was incredibly long. However, the hostess was very friendly despite not apologizing for the wait. There were also people who left the restaurant because they felt like it took too long to have someone ask for their order and they were not offered water. This is not my experience but I felt that it was important to add in case this is common and I had an above average visit. 

Summary:
(-): wait
(+): food, friendly service
Would recommend? YES."}
{"text":"Always good food,  atmosphere & service...rare jewel, thank you for staying consistent"}
{"text":"Service tonight was nonexistent. I came in at 7:20 to a dining room that was empty except for a family that was finishing its meal. Put in my food order right away. Was meeting people at 8 but figured, based on a lifetime of eating food in restaurants, 40 minutes was not unreasonable, especially given the empty dining room. My waitress took my order and disappeared. 35 minutes later, as it became obvious they were not going to serve me, I had to mount a search party to track her down so I could cash out for the iced tea she brought me before she fled. 

I hear great things about the food here. It's just too bad I picked a night when they weren't serving any of it. Will I try again? Maybe when I have an entire day free I'll get there right at opening time and hope for something sometime before they close. I'll bring plenty of books with me."}
{"text":"Stopped by on a Saturday about 11am, it wasn't crazy busy but you would have thought so since we stood there waiting to be seated for a while before I flagged down a server who told us to just sit in the back at a table, I asked if we could have a both and even though many were empty we were told they were all reserved. 
The 1st table we went to sit at wasn't cleaned and had hair on it.  
We waited and waited... that pretty much sums up the whole experience...  after about an hour our server comes out and says they lost the order ticket. She proceeded to take out order again and assured us it would only 10 more min... it wasn't and just about when we were gathering up our stuff to leave here comes our food.
While we were waiting I watched them seat people at the table with hair never wiping it off  or any other table for that matter before seating people.
So when our food came I really didn't want it... I ate the mac n cheese .. I was so hungry and it was good... the chicken was tasted boiled and the sauce on it runny.. the yams were too sweet.
We asked for the check and I was a bit surprised that they hadn't taken any thing off or even seemed apologetic considering the entire thing was a 2 hour disappointment."}
{"text":"As my eyes rolled in the back of my head, I sucked the bones from the pork chops like a gumless baby, and cried a little when they were gone, then wanted to curl up and go to sleep on my back because by then my stomach was poking out. And all this after the make-you-wanna-slap-yo-momma chicken & dumplings soup... Need I say more?"}
{"text":"I have eaten at Carmi's several times. The food was good, but the chaos with getting your order is not a good thing. Ordering take-out is a nightmare; incomplete and wrong orders, order outs and folks waiting in the same area. But I know the place is small.

Last week we ordered take-out and we were sorely disappointed. When we arrived home we couldn't wait to dig in. The portions were much, much smaller than in all of our previous visits. The pieces of chicken were extremely small. Our sides were much smaller than in the past. The salad was 95% lettuce, with one tomato and little else. The cornbread was about 1/3 of the size of what we've had in the past. Very disappointing experience. I'm not sure we'll be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to eating here ever since learning they opened in my neighborhood.  It was possibly the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant.

We arrived at 7:05 on a Saturday night, fully expecting there to be a wait. I don't mind waiting. This went beyond that.

7:10 Server asked us if we were eating in. We said yes. The dining room was only about 60% full. A lady came from the back to inform us that there was a half hour wait for a table. We were a little confused, since there were sooo many tables open, but said of course we could wait. She looked REALLY put out that we chose to wait, even though it was 2 hours before closing. The server sat us in a booth, and asked us if we would like some water. We asked if we could have a coke? She brought them to us.

7:35 Server took our order. One of our meals was supposed to come with a salad, which is usually served first.

8:05 Server asked to take our order. We told her we had already given it. Still no salad.

8:30 Lady who told us there was a wait asked to take our order. We told her we put it in an hour before and could we just get it to go? She actually grabbed a sign that was facing away from us and showed it to us; it said that it takes a half hour for food to be ready. Then she said, \"and I told you it was a half hour wait to get a table.\" We were shocked. We had already been there nearly an hour and a half, and while definitely put out, we hadn't even complained. We wanted it to go so we could take it home because we had been there long enough and were tired. She said she would pack up our food to go, including salad and desert.

8:45 Our food was brought out. We paid and left.
I have to say it was a very degrading experience and we will never go there again. I understand that they may be understaffed, but how is it customer service to behave as we are being unreasonable because we have been waiting an hour and a half and want to take our food to go? The showing us the sign was a huge insult. I know how to tell time. I knew exactly how long we had been there. Good customer service is apologizing for the wait and giving a good excuse for it. The kitchen being a half hour backed up is no excuse for it being 1 hr 45 mins before our food arrived.

We never got the salad. It wasn't in the to-go food. I cannot recommend this restaurant. I'm sure they are very nice when they have under 10 customers, but they do not have the capability to handle a half full dining room on a Saturday night.
The food was ok. I'm sure it would have been delicious when fresh."}
{"text":"I had the shrimp and grits and although overall it was tasty it was too greasy. Once it arrived at the table,  I immediately noticed the oil/grease sitting on top.  The v servers and staff were excellent. I also tried the chicken dumpling soup which was delicious! I would definitely come back for this dish."}
{"text":"Listen I don't know what the hype is about. My lunch wasn't awful nor was it amazing. I had chicken and waffles, greens, and Mac n cheese. 
Waffle-awesome
Chicken-done well, but 2 tiny pieces 1 leg 1 thigh
Mac n Cheese-overrated had very little flavor, but very cheesy
Greens- Pretty good, my opinion on greens may not be the best. 

Service and timing- meh. I sat down at 11:25 on Wednesday for lunch and I got my food at 11:57. And I ordered by 11:30. 27 minutes for food, when there was only one other table. 

The old lady who was my server, took my order, dropped the food, then the check. Never asked to refill my beverage, and let me know the food was running late. 

Thank goodness I wasn't on a lunch break this day otherwise I would of never made it."}
{"text":"Literally the best soul food I've ever had! The service is VERY slow which is why I'm giving them 4/5 stars. But don't let the wait deter you."}
{"text":"I should've reviewed this place! What the hell was I thinking!? The good here is the bomb and is definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"I ordered a grilled salmon, it was very dry and tasteless, I kept on adding salt to it.

It's a cute little restaurant, friendly waitresses"}
{"text":"They have really good comfort food here. The inside is a little dark and off putting when you enter. The fish stew and fried chicken and both winners"}
{"text":"So I've heard so much about this place and this was the third time we tried to eat here. Once was a Monday (which they're closed) and the second was when they were away on vacation. So the anticipation was very high as were my expectations! 

I'll start with the food. The food was very good! Just what I expected from a soul food spot! I had the turkey ribs. I didn't even know turkey had ribs! But they were so good. The greens were good. Sweet. I've never had greens like that before. The green beans were good too! They're greens and green beans are cooked with turkey so that for me is perfect! The Mac and cheese is amazing! 

I tried my coworkers shrimp and grits. They were good but had a layer of oil sitting on top of the bowl. I also tried the chicken and waffles! That's what I plan on getting next time! 

Be warned that the service is very slow and it will take a while for you to get your food. There were a lot of people just calling in orders and picking them up! Also they charge like 50 cents to use cards. I hate when places do that!!!!!!!!  Other then that this place is great!"}
{"text":"This is the best soul food you will find in Pennsylvania!!! The chicken and waffle meal I got was perhaps the greatest flavor sensation I've ever experienced in my life. COME HERE!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a nice quaint Family restaurant.  It kind of looks like a diner inside.  The soul food was very good.  My boyfriend and I ordered the fried chicken and blackened pork chop entrees.  The fried chicken was what u get if someone made homemade, nothing more nothing less.  My boyfriend said the blackened chops were good, but I'm not really into the blackened taste.  The mac and cheese was delicious!  We also had smashed potatoes, fried corn, cornbread dressing, cornbread and chicken and dumplings soup.  I'm pretty partial to my moms dressing so this one tasted on the sweeter side to me.  Overall it is good soul food and good people work there.  I'm eager to try it again and get a taste of other things."}
{"text":"As I consider myself to be an aficionado of southern cuisine, I will say Carmi is very worth the visit.  They offer a relatively robust menu with a good availability of entrees.  The food is very delicious and very afforable. The location is in a clean neighborhood and close to downtown.  I eat there as often as I can."}
{"text":"I stopped by here this past Sunday afternoon in order to eat a brunch with my girlfriend and her parents.  I have been by Carmi's many times before and honestly never even noticed it before I saw a fellow Yelper describe this and another place as her favorite restaurants.  Since the other place also happened to be my favorite restaurant we figured that we would give Carmi's a try.  The entrance to this place is pretty inconspicuous and I am not sure that I would have ever noticed it while walking on the sidewalk if not for the chalkboard stand outside.  Once inside I noticed nothing special about the place with a bunch of booths on each side of the restaurant and tables down the middle.  Whenever we got there at around 1 or so the place was fairly full and it only got more full the longer that we were there.

After looking at the menu I was having a hard deciding between the shrimp and grits and other meals whenever my girlfriend made it easy by also being undecided.  We ultimately decided that we would split a shrimp and grits as well as BBQ Chicken Breast Dinner with sides of macaroni and cheese and the southern mixed greens.  My girlfriends father ordered the Southern Fried Chicken Meal with the breast as his choice and we were told that would take between 20-25 minutes.  Since we were not in a huge hurry that was not a big deal.  I was impressed that all of the entrees were served with 2 sides in addition to a soup or salad.  After a bit of a wait all of our meals arrived.  My shrimp and grits looked awesome except for the amount of grease that seemed to be with it.  As a matter of a fact most of the food was fairly greasy but it still tasted really good.  The shrimp and grits were excellent with the shrimp being cooked nicely and the cheesy grits tasting fantastically.  I also was impressed with the mac n cheese which had some excellent taste and a good amount of cheese.  Finally both the chicken breast and the greens were good as well.

 The bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here in the future.  All of the food that we had was really good, now if I could only get it a little less greasy then I would be happy."}
{"text":"Ok so to start, this review is for the new location in Southside. I never reviewed the old location but I already miss it. I figured maybe since they were already an established restaurant there may not be too many kinks to work out and decided to go a month after opening (usually I wait a bit after a restaurant opens to give a good review). Our waitress was a sweetheart, and the food was pretty much the same. However in the hour or so I was there I watched MULTIPLE people leave after being told 15-20 mins and seeing empty tables just not be filled. The young girl at the front was so uninviting. Not that she was mean, but just seemed annoyed the whole time. She seemed to just be moving extremely slow, like she just didn't know if she should seat someone or take a takeout order or what. She was very young so I don't want this to come off as rude, it just all seemed confused. 

Also, I miss the comfort vibe. There was music playing sporadically but when it would shut off, the place went SILENT. 

Our food came in a reasonable amount of time. My chicken was a bit tough compared to what I'm used to from them, but sides were delicious as usual. 

I can't abandon my Carmi love, I'll just give it a while before I try again."}
{"text":"My soul was VERY happy after my visit to Carmi.

Okay, so the inside is nothing to write home about...a little dark and cafeteria-esque, but when you're slinging food as delicious as they are, ambiance really doesn't matter to me. Heck, I'd gladly eat some of their fried chicken and mac and cheese inside of a dumpster. 

Speaking of the food...almost everything we ate was a slam dunk. I ordered the BBQ chicken breasts, which came with two sides (I got mac and cheese and sweet potato fries), cornbread, and soup (I opted for chicken and dumpling).  Since I also wanted to try the fried chicken, I forced hubby to get that (thanks hubby!), and he chose sides of candied yams, potato salad, and fish stew for the soup.

The chicken and dumpling soup came out first, and I could've ended my meal there and been completely satisfied. The soup was thick, hearty, creamy, and stew-like...almost a meal in and of itself! It tasted like the filling of a well-made chicken pot pie.

My BBQ chicken meal consisted of two small chicken breast medallions smothered in tons of sauce. I must admit that the chicken wasn't my favorite. It was fairly overcooked -- quite dry and a bit tough. Their BBQ sauce, however, was stellar -- sweet with a slight hint of smoke and spice. 

However, the true hero on my plate was the mac and cheese. This is the mac and cheese to end all mac and cheeses. The noodles were cooked a perfect al dente. The sauce was rich and packed to the gills with ooey-gooey cheesiness. This is the kind of creamy, decadent mac and cheese that you can just  FEEL travelling directly from your esophagus into your arteries, but you don't care because you've been put into a temporary mac and cheese-induced euphoric state...mmm...

Where was I? Oh yes, the food. So, needless to say, I highly recommend the mac and cheese. The sweet potato fries were interesting, although not necessarily my cup of tea. They were lightly tossed in butter and then sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar. I prefer my sweet potato fries on the savory as opposed to the sweet side, but Carmi's take on them was definitely interesting. I really enjoyed the cornbread. It was dense, moist, flavorful, and sweet (but not too sweet).

As for my husband's food, it earned rave reviews as well. I stole several bites of his fried chicken and it was to die for!  It was *perfectly* cooked, with a light, crisp, peppery coating encasing deliciously juicy meat. His sides were also tasty -- the candied yams were the perfect texture (not too firm, not too mushy) with a warmly-spiced sauce, and the potato salad was well-balanced and flavorful.

Obviously since each meal comes with meat + 2 sides + cornbread + soup, this is a TON of food. I had to tap out before I could finish. So it's a great value. At the time we were there, the prices on their menu were slightly higher than what's currently posted on their website. Also, they charge a small $.25 fee to use credit cards ($.50 for Discover or Amex).

Service was friendly and efficient. All food is cooked to order, so they have signs at the table that prime you to expect that your food may take longer to come out than you might be used to. However, I don't think the wait for our food was unreasonable at all (maybe 20 minutes?)

Overall, the chicken and dumpling soup, the mac and cheese and the fried chicken will have me coming back to Carmi as soon as I can. And next time I'm definitely going to wear expandable pants."}
{"text":"Loveeeeee this place! Everything's seasoned perfect and just so home made. I can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Everything here is delicious. They have the best Mac and cheese I've ever had. Everything is fresh and the portion sizes are great for the cost of the plates. I ate the chicken dumpling soup, fried chicken, yams, and Mac and cheese, with pulled bbq sliders as an app. It was so good I ate until I had to roll myself out of the restaurant! Also the staff is very friendly, and the restaurant is beautiful. One of my favorite parts is the smooth r&b that sets a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Came to this spot on a recommendation from a local/friend-  met his brother there for a bite and a laugh-  for soul food one of the best ways to judge is to try the macncheese- not to fancy not to soupy is usually the best measure...if a soul food restaurant can get that down then you're golden- Carmi's has it down and so does the rest of the food we tried...

I'd be happy to come back anytime-"}
{"text":"This was my 5th visit to Carmi's. While the service can be slow the friendly staff and excellent food is always there to make up for it and I have raved about it to my family and the circumstances finally got them there today for their first try. 
Today was not the case. The service was extremely slow. Our orders were incorrect and the waiter was awful. There was another waitress who actually took our soup bowls away and refilled our drinks as our water continuously walked passed us without checking in with us. When speaking to the manager - she made it a point after I watched the waiter talk to her to walk beside our table and speak to two people, giving them hugs, asking for their Facebook page \"because I don't do Twitter\" and asking about when their next show was. When I shared how long we had been waiting she returned later and said \"I reviewed the camera you were wrong\" - so even if my perception of our arrival time was off - that still put us at waiting for our food 1 hr and 10 minutes after we had ordered it. Knowing service can be slow, I prepped my family in advance to order immediately since it can be a little while. The poor service was excused by \"he's new\" and \"our food took longer bc of what was ordered.\" - a 4 top behind us came longer after we had arrived and I saw they had also ordered chicken and were finishing heir meals as I as talking to the manager. Aside from the chicken I highly doubt they are baking fresh meatloaf for every single order. There is no reason it should take that long. I very rarely am one to ask to speak to a manager or send food back. This was so disappointing and the managers complete dismissal of our concerns/upset only made it worse and made the experience worse. Sadly I will certainly not be returning after today's experience and worse so- the manager could care less."}
{"text":"This was my first visit, but won't be my last. The menu offers so many choices that it is hard to decide- fried chicken, pork chops, ribs, shrimp & grits, chicken & dumplings... I was with a group of 6 ladies and everyone enjoyed their meal. Service was friendly & thorough. No complaints and I highly recommend."}
{"text":"It was really busy and had to wait a little bit but, the food made up for it! It was excellent, especially since I'm a cook and foodie myself."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here a few times over a year ago. How're, we stopped going. The atmosphere is nice and the staff were always great. But in my opinion, the food needs improvement. First, they need to offer a great selection of fish than just tilapia. Second, I get it's soul-food, but their grits are beyond heavy. I got full after a couple of bites! They need to lay off the grease a little bit."}
{"text":"I have tried the ribs, and the shrimp and grits. The greens is good as well. I'm going to miss this location that was right by C.C.A.C. Allegheny campus. Delicious food and professional service!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and a lot of it. Had the smothered pork chops, mashed potatoes, mac and cheese, cornbread and cabbage and bacon soup. All of it was excellent as was my wife's fried chicken."}
{"text":"Just not good.  My wife ordered the chicken wings. The bones in the wings were broken, She ordered the stuffing as a side. They were sweet, not very good. She ordered the mashed potatoes and gravy also not good. Out of five stars, this place rated probably a one and a half.  I ordered the shrimp and grits, shrimp were super salty. Which made up for the grits which needed salt. Just wasn't good. We had high hopes. I don't know why anyone would want to eat here."}
{"text":"Omg , the food here is so amazing, best soul food I ever had .  I had the pork chop smothered  , mac and cheese , sweet yam , and the corn bread . The pork chop was so tasty and not dry . Honestly the food is amazing I had no complain about any of my food !"}
{"text":"My dad ordered the liver and onions and this is his go to meal. He loved it. He said it was better than the place we usually go to. I had the grilled salmon salad and fish stew they were bomb af!! It was our First time at the new location on Carson street and we will be back.  The music selection was awesome and all the staff were all friendly and treated us like family."}
{"text":"If you haven't eaten at Carmi yet, stop what you're doing and get on your way! The fried chicken is the best I've ever had. My fiance got chicken and waffles with a side of greens while I went with the smothered chicken with a side of mac n cheese, fried corn, and cornbread. The fried corn wasn't great to me, just a little bland. I added salt and hot sauce and was happy with it. The gravy on my chicken was amazing!!! I would eat that on anything! The only reason Carmi didn't get a 5 star is the service was a tad slow, but we did arrive right after the lunch rush so it's excusable. And though slow, the server was friendly as can be!"}
{"text":"The food here was unreal. I started with a bowl of fish soup, which was spicy and delicious. Afterwards, I got my heaping plate of a fried chicken breast, greens, Mac and cheese, and cornbread. It was all amazing. The chicken was really moist, the mac and cheese was creamy and delicious, and the greens were perfect (there were so many that I couldn't finish them). The piece of cornbread was huge and had a nice big pat of butter on the top.

The service was good, and I didn't mind the wait since I had a cup of soup to eat while I waited. I'll definitely be coming back -- and bringing friends."}
{"text":"I've heard so many great things about Carmi from everyone in the area. I finally went this morning for a late breakfast. 

I ordered the shrimp and grits and my girlfriend got the chicken and waffles. 

The food came out in a reasonable amount of time. The shrimp and grits were a little greasy for me. The Cajun seasoning was great! There was a good amount of cheese as well. That being said there was way too much fennel in the dish. That's all I could taste in most bites. 

The chicken and waffles is what I'd go back for. The chicken was so crispy and really juicy. The waffle was perfectly golden brown. The two complimented each other so well! 

Our waitress was so polite and sweet to us the entire time. I felt like I was at home and I cant wait to go back. 

I would have given 4 our of 5 but the staff was so welcoming they deserved 5 out of 5!"}
{"text":"Have to say we were honestly really disappointed. Considering all the other glowing reviews, we had really high hopes, but the service really ruined it for us unfortunately.

Just two of us for dinner and there were only three other tables seated when we got there, yet from the point of taking our order to actually getting our meal was an hour and fifteen minutes. No exaggeration. The soup came out within a few minutes and then... nothing.   

When the food finally came out, one of the sides was no longer available. Waitress asked what we wanted to replace it with, but couldn't tell us what the options were and ultimately we just said forget it.

The table beside us and the table behind us both seemed to have almost identical experiences in terms of ridiculous wait times. The table behind us still hadn't received their food when we were leaving and were complaining to the waitress.

Aside from that, the food we did get was tasty, but I ordered the ribs and have to admit I was really expecting more than just two. They were fall off the bone tender though.

The cornbread, as others have said, was a huge portion and amazing.  The dumpling soup was great. The sweet potato pie was piping hot and crazy delicious... highly recommended.

I'd be willing to try it again, because the food really was good, but maybe just not on a night when I'm drop dead starving."}
{"text":"Comfort food at its best!!!!! Two blocks from Heinz Field, another new favorite restaurant! Starting with the tangy, succulent fall off the bone ribs, with mac and cheese, the best corn bread above the Mason Dixon line!! The pork chops were nicely seasoned and tender. Then we come to the fried chicken and waffles!!! Bite into the crispy, crunchy coating, and you now have a party in your mouth! The fried chicken is exceptional, just delicious. Accompanied by a tasty waffle drenched with maple syrup, you've now reached your Utopia!! Great comfort food!! End your meal with some really good Banana pudding, go home happy and full!!!"}
{"text":"I love home cooking.  Southern food is my weak spot.  We travel South all the time and have had a good amount of meat and three in our travels.  I ordered the fried chicken dinner with 2 sides.  I didn't think it was going to be enough food and it wasn't.  You could choose from a single breast, 3 wings or a leg and thigh.  None are quite enough.  I opted for the leg and thigh.  Mine were small to boot.  It was average, not great fried chicken but good.   I loved the greens, they were absolutely spot on great.  I didn't like the choice of sides and ended up with candied yams.  These had too much white sugar in them for me and they were broken all the way down.   It was sugar yam mush and I saved myself and didn't have more than a couple bites.  

The staff is warm and friendly.  You are most welcome there and they are very concerned that you love your food and your experience.  They brought us out a free sample of their chicken and dumpling soup.  It was delicious.  Tasted and looked like liquid chicken pot pie in a cup with pieces of dumpling floating in it.  We had a nice time but ended up going to the strip for some tacos after as I was hungry."}
{"text":"I loved this place! The service was great and the welcoming atmosphere will keep me going back. My fried chicken was cooked perfectly, and the Mac and cheese is probably the best I've ever had. I can't wait to go back here!"}
{"text":"This place is dangerous. I already want to come back and I'm still full from dinner. I decided to try something different and came across Carmi's raving reviews. Let me start off by saying that I rarely give a place 5 stars - this was well deserved. 

The feel of the restaurant is great - it's super homey and our server made us feel really welcome. The food might take a little while but that's because they make it to order and they note that on their tables. Trust me, it's worth the wait. Also, it's BYOB but they're moving to South Side in a few weeks and stated they would be serving alcohol there. 

I decided to get the smothered chicken with fries and mac and cheese - couldn't hold back on the carbs! So glad I didn't. The fries were super fresh and the mac and cheese was the best I've ever had. Trust me, I've tasted a lot of mac in my life but that was the top. The chicken was definitely in my top 5 favorites. The breading wasn't super thick but definitely gave a good crunch and the breast was very juicy.

My friend got the chicken and waffle with mac and cheese and raved about it. We were both so impressed and wish we saved room for dessert because I'm sure they had something awesome to offer. We will have to save room next time! 

We definitely plan on visiting the South Side location when it opens and can't wait to see how well it does."}
{"text":"Ok, so I came here because of the chicken and waffle reviews, but I ended up getting the Carmi burger.  This burger is topped with fried egg, fried onion, bacon, lettuce, tomato, Swiss cheese, American cheese and remoulade all for $10.99 plus another 99 cents for fries.  This burger was as good as it sounds, cooked to perfection with awesome toppings!  My boyfriend did get the chicken and waffles as planned and he only had great things to say about his meal.  I can't wait to come back and try some of the soul food items on the menu...if I can branch out from the delicious burger!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! I don't get a chance to come often, but when I do...it's always great and hits the spot! You gotta try the shrimp and grits!"}
{"text":"Woke up in the morning craving chicken and waffles. Having never had it before I googled \"chicken and waffles Pittsburgh\" and boom next thing ya know I'm sitting at a table with chicken a waffle and orange juice and two eggs. 

The ownership is so polite and the hostess was the sweetest. She made me feel right at home when I was the only one in the restaurant early AM. The waffle was cooked perfectly and the chicken was reallllly and I mean reallly good. I thoroughly enjoyed my breakfast this morning and will return when I'm struck by a craving again."}
{"text":"Chicken and waffles.  Enough said.  Chicken came out hot with a perfectly crisp skin and moist meat.  The waffles were lightly sprinkled with powered sugar and had a slight sweetness to them.  I also ordered the mac and cheese.  It was okay, but towards the bottom, it started getting greasy.  Pass on the mac and cheese.  Just eat alllllllll the fried chickennnnnn.

Heads up: they charge you a fee if you use a credit card (I think it was 25 cents??)."}
{"text":"I am SO HAPPY I FOUND THIS GEM!!!!! I grew up on my beloved Grannie's southern cooking and while I can cook too, it is so wonderful to be able to enjoy someone else's PERFECT SOUL FOOD!

I came for Brunch--had the Queen's Breakfast (check the website for the menu Carmi.com) and added two fried chicken wings. I didn't finish half of my waffle (that was fantastic!) or eat any of my wings, so I have something for tonight!

I will be back...maybe tomorrow! Can you say delightful nostalgia?! Felt like I was back home with my Grannie! 

Oh! And the service was great and felt more like family interactions than being served. 

Diverse patrons. 

Love it! Perfect!"}
{"text":"My favorite place in Pittsburgh. The chicken and dumpling soup a different the fried chicken cannot be beat."}
{"text":"The shrimp and grits were the best I've ever eaten...had the right amount of spice but not too much. You could definitely taste the grits and the shrimp wasn't over cooked. Portion size was awesome as well, come hungry and you won't be disappointed! Future trips to Pittsburgh will revolve around Carmi's hours, can't wait to try the fried chicken and waffles."}
{"text":"I absolutely Love Carmi's. They have  unique way of preparing their food which just sits right in your belly.

I always order their fish stew which is the best i've ever had. Their catfish and collard greens are by far my favorite along with the stuffing and sweet potatoes. I have yet to try the fried chicken and waffle meal, I'm a little skeptical about it. I haven't really tried their desserts yet so i have no comment on that.

The service there is pretty decent. We were seated after about a five minute wait. The server was a little slow to bring us extra items like napkins and sauce but outside of that everything else was top notch."}
{"text":"I had the catfish dinner. Hands down one of the best meals I've ever had. Service was great too. You have to eat here!"}
{"text":"It has been awhile since I have been in and the service was wonderful. I ordered the pork chops and waffles, the pork chops were tender and seasoned just right. The sweet tea hit the spot, I also taken an order of the chicken and dumplings soup with cornbread home and it was delicious! I have to make another trip with the family!"}
{"text":"We had a great meal here tonight.  Between my husband and I, we tried the fried chicken, fried tilapia, mac and cheese, caribbean rice and beans, southern mixed greens, and cornbread.  Everything was excellent, and we thoroughly enjoyed our dinner.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"I try to eat here whenever I'm on the north side and have never been disappointed. Had some amazing blackened tilapia, collards, and yams the other day. The staff are super courteous and friendly as well."}
{"text":"The fish stew is delicious.  Most entrees are very good also.  Not too crazy about the fried chicken because it is southern style with corn flour breading but everything else about the place is superb including the service."}
{"text":"Was looking for a previously visited pizza joint on Carson in south flats section and I walked by Carmi soul food. I remembered the reviews and though why not? Salad was excellent, beer cold, service outstanding as  I awaited main course. As of now they are 4 stars. A friendly neighborhood place, catering to all. This isn't fast food. 
Main course I was sold before the catfish. Cornbread literally like Grandma's. Mac and cheese a comfort. Greens not too salty and moist.  Catfish moist and as promised. Servers worked as a team. Gonna bring guests next time.
Top marks."}
{"text":"I had originally heard of Carmi's though a Groupon that I purchased several months ago.  Because it's slightly out of the way of my usual stomping grounds and quite frankly, some parts of the North Side can be rather scary, I had put off going there.  Yesterday as my PIC (Partner In Cuisine) and I found ourselves heading in the direction of the North Side, we decided to finally use the Groupon.  As it turns out, Carmis is on a lovely little street on the far end of a nice park in the heart of urban revitalization.  Not nearly as scary as the news makes the area out to be!

My first impression of the place was that the decor was rather dated and the restaurant itself was completely empty so I was bit nervous about eating there, but I was determined to use that Groupon.  We were greeted and seated at one of the many booths by a very friendly young lady named Margaret, who also happened to be our server.  Both my PIC and I ordered the ribs meal after much deliberation over their extensive menu.  With the meals, we each got a soup or salad, two sides and a VERY generous portion of homemade corn bread.  For my starter, I got the chicken and dumplings soup and my PIC got the salad.  The soup was rich and delicious, but the salad left something to be desired (and only two dressing options).  Our main courses consisted of fries, greens, and candied yams along with three spare ribs.  The greens and yams were both homemade and excellent, but the fries were just typical frozen variety (not bad, not great).  I was a bit worried when the ribs came because there were only three and ribs aren't that meaty, but my worries were proven unfounded as I was unable to finish my last rib.  The sauce on the ribs was sweet and tangy and the meat was cooked to perfections, but the ribs themselves were a bit gristly.  The cornbread was buttery, sweet, and overall full of awesomeness.  Margaret made the entire experience exceptional by providing good conversation and suggestions for what we should order.  As far as the restaurant being empty, by the end of our meal, about six tables ended up filling and more people were coming in as we left.  

Ultimately, I'd give Carmis a 4 1/2 out of 5 if Yelp would allow that because while the prices were acceptable and the sides were superb, the salad and meat weren't the best I've had.  After we left, we walked around the area for a bit and as it turns out, Carmi's is extremely close to Heinz Field so if you find yourself in the area for a game, I'd suggest giving it a go...even without a Groupon."}
{"text":"Friend and I ordered late lunch, early dinner to go on a Wednesday. We had JUST missed the lunch specials that end at 3pm, so dinner orders it was. I ordered the fried chicken dinner, which came with two sides and a choice of soup or salad. I elected for the chicken dumpling soup option as opposed to the other fish stew, and also the green bean and mac n' cheese sides. Friend order fish n' grits dinner, which also came with two sides. No soup or salad, I think though.

I was so hungry, I started in on the cornbread and soup first while in the car. Cornbread was not great. The top part was dry, but the bottom was alright. We're thinking we didn't get the freshest of cuts from the day. Next, I started in on the chicken n' dumpling soup. Though it was so thick, I don't know how it could be called soup! Don't get me wrong, it was DELICIOUS, but it was super thick and creamy, far more than I expected. There's some word between soup and stew that accurately describes it.

Finally after reaching the house, I started to eat the dinner meal like proper folks should. Green beans were overcooked as typical in most soul food spots I've experienced. Mac n' Cheese was alright, but not best I ever had. The fried chicken was hardly fried. It was kind of a lightly fried baked chicken that retained a lot of the juices. It didn't have much of the crisp and crunch that I was looking for, but it was quite good for what it was. My friend said pretty much the same thing about his meal. Everything tasted light. Take that to mean whatever you'd like.

It's hard to please everyone when it comes to soul food. Certainly this food was aight, and didn't leave my stomach crying in overstuffed pain later. But it was a wee disappointing. Not to mention that they didn't have any desserts for sale when we came in because apparently the baker doesn't get in to get those ready until the the dinner rush. I really REALLY wanted me some good sweet potato pie, and was sad I couldn't try out Carmi's."}
{"text":"Why was last weekend the first time that I went to this place? I cannot believe that after hearing about Carmi's for so long we finally took the plunge. Now I will say that even though I live in Pittsburgh I am not a football fan. I do not really get into the games or all that that means. So when we got here on a Steeler sunday when they were playing in Pittsburgh I didn't realize that street parking would be an issue. If the Steelers play you cannot park for over an hour on the street in the Northside. It is an $120 fine. I mean.. that seems a little much but I get that they do not want people to park there and then head to the stadium, but what about the people who come there and are going to eat? I don't know, but it seems like there should be a better procedure in place.

What was good is that this ticketing doesn't happen until after 12PM. So we got there around 10 AM for breakfast so we were in the clear. I will say that Carmi's does take time to get your food because they make everything by hand, so while we were ok, we did cut it a little closer than I would have liked. But still totally worth it. 

So we got there and picked Carmi's because my cousin wanted chicken and waffles. That is what she was craving and since she was visiting she was going to get what she wanted! We got in and the hostess greeted us warmly right at the door. We got to sit in one of the booths on the side and the waitresses and waiters all checked on us throughout the entire visit. I thought that this was really special. I liked that when they walked past they would just check in. Really a nice way to enjoy breakfast and not have to look for someone if there was something needed for the table. 

We decided that we wanted to split breakfast which meant that we each ordered something that looked amazing. She got the chicken and waffles and I got the Carmi omelet. We wanted something sweet, something eggy, and something filling. And boy, with this order did we get it all! Again, if you are in the hurry this place is probably not the place for you. But if you have some time to kill and to enjoy the company you are with this is a great place. 

Once our food came it was just silence. We ate so much and did not leave anything on our plates. I mean it was just so good. The chicken was breaded to perfection and just seasoned superbly. I could have just had that chicken for sure, it was just really good. The waffle was crispy and sweet. And everything on that plate was wonderful. My omelet was fluffy and filled with green peppers, onions, and meat. I will say that on my half of the omelet I only got one hunk of cheese but it did not distract from the omelet experience at all. I got to also pick my own toast and that was pre-buttered and crisp. YUM. 

I really enjoyed this place a lot. I want to come back again soon! And maybe even for dinner. I would have also liked to be able to stay a little longer but with that sign up saying that I would get a ticket I was slightly on edge to stay longer to get a cup of coffee and chill. I would suggest if you are in the Northside to take the time out of your day to come here. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great stop before a concert or game!

Wow -  to the Mac & Cheeese!

Friendly good service!

Tender ribs with a good sauce that was a combo of sweet with just a little spice.  Better than most of the rib joints in the area."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times and it hasn't disappointed. I brought my boyfriend here because of this. We were immediately seated and there was a family seated near us playing a some type of anniversary reveal game that was tots cute. The chicken was crispy and full of flavor. The wings were especially great. The waffles were light and fluffy. It's the perfect breakfast. We'll be back again."}
{"text":"Awesome! Awesome! Awesome! Finally, authentic soul food in the Pittsburgh area! Carmi has the authentic southern soul food feel that the city has been missing. From hospitable service to healthy portions, Carmis is everything you could ask for from a soul food joint.

The buzz has been around Carmis for quite some time and it's easy to see why. The menu is extensive with traditional soul food dishes like fried chicken, turkey ribs, fried catfish and cornbread. Even the Soulmosa, a tropical spin on the traditional orange juice and champagne drink, has that southern taste to it. I recommend the Mac n cheese, greens and sweet potatoes as side dishes. 

Carmis did not disappoint one bit. We are excited to make plans for next week's brunch at Carmis again!"}
{"text":"Oh my word!  Stumbled across this place and it's now gonna be a staple of my steeler game trips.  Food exceptional, no wait, even 1hr before game time."}
{"text":"At the end of the Thanksgiving weekend most people probably want to take a step back from the table and reassess their diet for the next few weeks prior to Christmas.  Some may refer to them as intelligent, healthy, skinny, etc... I, however, like to call those people \"amateurs.\"

A trip to Carmi's is about one thing... the food.  This is not about the lack of decor, the dim lighting, or the inconspicuous entrance at the darker end of Western Avenue.  It's about finding a place to sit down on a brisk Saturday night and be comforted by a warm soul food blanket.

Although the menu is somewhat limited, the items selected were done well.  I couldn't help but head straight into the deep end and get the chicken and waffles... besides, what's one more dead bird to the population?  The menu options are for a breast, 3 full size wings, or one leg and thigh.  The way I see it, one needs to consume all parts of the bird - most of them, anyways - in order to fully experience the quality of the overall product.  Naturally, I ordered the chicken breast with an additional thigh and leg.  As it did not come with a side, I felt obligated to order myself some mac and cheese.  It's just an unwritten rule in this type of establishment that you try it, no matter what.  The waitress was nice, helpful, and attentive... and also informed us that it would be up to a 20 minute wait for the fried chicken breasts.  I'm willing to wait for [potentially] great things, so this was of no issue.

The fried chicken was a deep golden brown with a crisp skin, generously salted and lightly peppered, just as it should be.  Instead of a heavy floured crust, this was done with a thin batter... just enough to hold on to the meat and provide a great texture contrast while still maintaining the moisture inside.  The waffle was evenly browned with a slight crisp on the exterior, concealing the sweet malty pillow tucked inside.  The hot sauce, which was in the range of Red Devil or Crystal, rounded out the flavor of the chicken while complimenting the heavy drizzle of maple syrup flowing through the waffle's crevices.

The macaroni and cheese is very straightforward and that's what makes it so great.  The technique of making mac and cheese could start a world war, but I don't discriminate.  Baked and dry, not baked and excessively creamy, processed cheese product, mornay base, aged or young shredded... I don't care.  Just give it to me - preferably in mass quantity.  A noticeable texture strata of brown and bubbly to soft and stringy cheese will only earn you more points.  This one in particular is more along the lines of the oven baked variety with a lightly browned top, noodles cooked beyond the point of tender, heaped into a bowl without regard for delicate presentation.  No secrets, no frills, just a great bowl of mac and cheese.  Hell, it didn't even need bacon. *gasp*

While straddling the boundaries of yet another holiday food coma, our waitress was just in time to ask if we wanted dessert.  I didn't know what they had to offer, but I know exactly what I wanted if indeed it were an option, regardless if it could be fully consumed or not.  Sure enough, those words flowed from her mouth: \"We have banana pudding.\"  YES. There would be no turning back.

We sat and waited, unknowing of what was about to hit our table.  She approached with what appeared to be a bowl size comparable to that of a baptismal basin - not the one the old ladies dip their gnarled fingers in - the one that a small child could be dumped in to wash him of his \"sins\", or chicken greased fingers in this case.  A mountain of banana pudding, hints of vanilla, layered with whipped cream and crushed 'Nilla wafers, overflowing with freshly sliced ripe bananas.  I've had some banana pudding in my day... but this was near the top of the list.  Once again it was simplicity at its finest, with ingredients none too spectacular, but handled with enough care to create a dish that transports you straight into grandma's kitchen.

A great first trip for someone who loves and appreciates soul food.  I can only hope everyone else has the same experience."}
{"text":"All of the reviewers are right about this place!!! Go here!!! We love Carmi too!

We went for brunch, and it was delicious. My husband had the chicken and waffles. The chicken was expertly fried, and the waffle was prefectly crispy. I had the shrimp and cheesy grits. They were incredible. Now you have to like spicy because these things are major spicy, but oh my, were they delicious.

My husband said the cornbread was great with just the right amount of sweet. It looked great--a huge think chunk of goodness.

My daughter had the \"prince\"--which we called the \"princess\"--it was the perfect amount of food for her. They also treated her to cute coloring pages.

The wait staff is so nice and friendly.

Also, the food does sometimes take a while--it is MADE TO ORDER--and that is just how we like it!"}
{"text":"My partner and I had tickets to Manhattan Transfer and Take 6 at Manchester Craftsman's Guild, and needed to pick up the tickets an hour before the show, and decided to grab dinner somewhere nearby, which was inevitably the North Side. We started off by using GPS to find Lola Bistro, and were lead somewhere else, which put us on Western Avenue. I saw Nicky's Thai Kitchen, and we thought we'd go there...25 minute wait. Nope. So we walked down the street a bit. Some burger place. Crammed with hipsters and a 30 minute wait. Nope. So we headed back to the car, and across the street I saw a little sandwich board sign on the sidewalk. 'Pittsburgh's Best Soul Food'. We decided, what the heck. Having NO idea what to expect when we walked in the door.

On first site...rough around the edges...a little run down, kind of diner dive-ish, but pretty much filled with a big mix of customers. Which in my mind says...VERY promising.

A very sweet gal came and took our drink orders. Since we'd be up way past our usual bedtimes, we had coffee, and then placed our order. I ordered the Carmi burger, and he ordered the Shrimp Po Boy. We also each had a bowl of the soup of the day, which was chicken dumpling.

Well, the soup was more like chicken noodle. I did have ONE dumpling in mine, but I didn't see one in his bowl. Nevertheless, the soup, dumplings or not, was absofreakinlutely delicious! This was obviously home made, creamy and rich, with nice chunks of chicken. 

As we finished our soup and waited for the main courses, we watched the dishes floating past to other tables, and before we even ate, started planning a return to try a few of the things that went by. One plate of fried chicken went to a table across the way, and when the woman bit into hers, her eyes bulged and she motioned to her friend across the table with an eye full of YUM, and gave him a thumbs up indicator for the chicken. Since I LOVE good fried chicken, that's the next planned visit entree!

Our mains arrived. We kept it simple, with only the potato chips that came with the sandwiches, and after the soup, we were glad. Too much would have been too much.

He bit into his Po Boy and his eyes glazed. He insisted that I try a shrimp. He gave me one. PERFECTLY breaded and seasoned, and the shrimp was perfectly cooked, not overdone and chewy, but tasted fresh. 

My burger...well...the burger itself wasn't all that impressive. A kind of short patty, that could have been a frozen Angus burger. BUT, all of the toppings on this baby made it drool-worthy.

Bacon, a fried egg, a lovely cheese, lettuce and tomato, pepperoncini rings, on a perfect bun, and a home made roumalade sauce beneath the burger. WOW, was it tasty. Make that a hand formed ground beef patty, and this would be a prize winner! The potato chips seemed home made as well, and most of them went home, along with half of the Po Boy.

The big shocker was actually the coffee. It wasn't pretentious or foofy. It was coffee. And it had a LOT of coffee in it! My partner put three half and halfs in his and it took serious stirring before it turned caramel brown. I am a purist, and LOVE coffee with actual 'body', and this stuff hit the spot perfectly.

I noticed many reviews griping about the service. Either Carmi's paid attention and worked on that, or the original gripers were just those who need to be pandered to on a secondly basis. Our gal was absolutely fine, attentive and helpful. Sweet as could be, and efficient in a busy atmosphere.

My only real complaint would be that the prices are a tad on the high side, and a co-worker pointed out that this is a big hang out for film crews and stars when they come to down, and she kind of attributed the pricing to that. Had the prices been just slightly lower, this would have been a 5 star! Even though I felt the bill was a little higher than it needed to be, the flavor and quality of the pure simplicity made it totally worth it. This is a place I'd return to somewhat regularly as budget allows. In fact, there's another concert we have tickets to in November...and the fried chicken is already calling us back.

My soul...was well fed. Thank you Carmi's!"}
{"text":"Love this place in the Northside!, the shrimp and grits are creamy, spicy and delicious, the service is friendly."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday at lunch  

Service - didn't have to wait to sit or to get served. Service could not have been friendlier. Restaurant was very clean. - 5 stars



Food - started w the chicken and dumpling soup. Loved it. Had the fried tilapia, Mac and cheese, greens, and corn bread. Loved the breaking on the fish. Mac and cheese was very good as was the corn bread. Not to wild about the greens but they weren't over cooked. Just didn't like the flavor. But give it a try if you like greens. 4+ stars

Overall - very good. I would give it 4.5 stars but I can't do that on yelp. Good comfort food and I'm still full 8 hours later."}
{"text":"Omgoodness I love this place.  Theee of us went on a Saturday night!!   My dinner guests had the fried chicken, based on Denzel's recommendation.. I had the fried catfish. It was so moist on the inside and crispy on the outside and very flavorful!!  I also had greens with corn bread!!!  It was everything I dreamed it would be.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Very refreshing Watermelon Mojito, very tasty friend green tomatoes with remoulade, loved the chicken and dumplings soup can taste the Butter very rich had the shrimp and grits very buttery and nicely seasoned very reasonably priced for the quality and quantity of food will be back to taste the ribs!"}
{"text":"I've been here a total of three times. The first time was when i just moved to Pittsburgh and had the chicken and it was absolutely great. The second time i came back with classmates and it was great too with the shrimp and grits. This last time i came to the new location with the anticipation of it being more room and easier to be seated and i was wrong. We came after their brunch ended and waited for about forty five minutes to be seated. There were four seats away from the band packing up in a tight area and we pointed this out to them. They did not seat us and then almost an hour later gave us the seats that no one sat in for 45 minutes. If i wasn't hungry i wouldn't have stayed but we waited it out so long that it defeated the purpose. I have not been back since then and I'm sad about it cuz that place was golden and i love supporting minority owned businesses."}
{"text":"As a family we wanted to try so many different dishes so we just ordered so much stuff off the menu and shared.  We had the smothered porkchops, fried chicken (dark meat), and catfish as our main dishes.  Each meal comes with a starter so we got salad, chicken' dumplings, and fish stew (a bit spicy).  Also all meals come with two sides and cornbread.  To say the least we were beyond full.  The sides we got were greens, yams, mac'n cheese, dressing (least favorite), smashed potatoes, fried corn (favorite).  Everything we ordered was nothing short of amazing.  I really should give 5 stars, never mind I changed to five stars from four stars."}
{"text":"So... since I was 11 years old and first saw the movie \"Little Nicky\" featuring Adam Sandler I have dreamt of the day I would eat chicken and waffles. In the last 13 years I have come across many an establishment that offered this enticing option, but none of them ever felt like the \"right\" place. The other night I walk into a true institution of culinary excellence known as \"Carmi Soul Food.\" After taking a seat my friend turns to me and says \"chicken and waffles is on the menu.\" I look intently around the restaurant and no one was eating the chicken and waffles, but I think to myself \"this is the place... and tonight... is the night.\" I am offered the option of 3 wings, a breast, or a leg and a thigh. I am recommended the 3 wings and with pure joy in my heart, place my first ever order... of chicken and waffles. Time passes and 3 beautiful reddish brown chicken wings are delicately places next to golden waffles pre-buttered and dusted with powdered sugar. I carefully cut the first quarter of the waffles and touch my fork to the chicken which falls like rain from the bone. I take the first bite and nothing, not even the table continues to exist as eat. I am interrupted part way through intently but politely telling my friends \"do not speak to me.\"   I stand here a forever a changed man and am humbled to be able to recommend this establishment"}
{"text":"This place gets one start  because my friend and I sat waiting for a waiter for 50 minutes before leaving. Never again!"}
{"text":"Shrimp and cheddar grits - grits, cheddar, tobasco, and cooked onion topped with shrimp, grated cheddar and green onions.  Very good.  The only thing that unnerved me - just a little - was the waitress asking if I wanted toast; it was breakfast, of course I wanted toast.  It wasn't until I got my bill that I noted the toast was extra.  Granted, it was only a $1, but if bread is gonna be extra - which is not typical - the waitress should usually mention that fact."}
{"text":"The food at Carmi's is pretty good and the staff is sweet and friendly. I tasted the mac n cheese and the chicken and waffle entre. I really enjoyed the waffles, they were buttery with powdered sugar on top. The chewy/crisy ratio was perfect. The fried chicken breast was moist and the seasoning was present but not overpowering. 

Despite the good food, Carmi's is best enjoyed to go. The atmosphere is just sad, dingy and depressing. I have a hunch that this establishment moved into an old Irish bar and never renovated the space because you can still smell the cigarette smoke from 20 years ago and there is virtually no sunlight. And I get dingy, I've been to my fair share of dives, but kick up the music or something. The sad and gloomy 70s-90s ballads took me to the point where I couldn't overlook the divey/old-school aesthetic. Donny Hathaway's \"Song For You\" in that dreary atmosphere was just too much and made me want my check pronto. Come on, spare me please!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was one of the best experiences we've had so far in Pittsburgh. I haven't felt as welcome anywhere in this area as I did here. The hostesses especially, and our waitress were awesome. The vibe was fun and the food was seriously amazing. The chicken and waffles was perfection after all of the other average or below, food we've had here. I'd definitely recommend this establishment to anyone near this area, the food and great staff here are worth it and the prices were good for college students like us. This photo was taken after a few bites, I couldn't resist!"}
{"text":"This was our second visit to Carmi and this time we brought a friend along to rid him of his Carmi virginity! I think we found Carmi's a new customer!

Tonight I had the BBQ ribs. I am not someone who will typically order ribs at a restaurant. Ribs need to fulfill a lot of requirements for me, so I usually don't take the risk. I'm glad I made the choice for the ribs. They were so tender I could cut them with my fork! The meat fell right off of the bone and the BBQ sauce was perfect St. Louis style with just enough tang and sweetness. 

If you get the chance, also give the sweet potato fries a try. Thick, fresh-cut and perfectly cooked topped with brown sugar and a dash of cinnamon. 

The food here is just like home-cooked and just as comforting. Everything I've had at Carmi's is delicious and it's hard deciding what to order! No matter what you choose, you can't go wrong. 

We had fantastic service and everyone was very friendly and welcoming. Carmi's will keep us coming back for sure!

Some of the reviews about the food taking a while bug me. There is a sign in the restaurant that clearly states that everything is made to order and can take up to 30 mintues to prepare.Don't be in a rush and just enjoy!"}
{"text":"Food is a 5 STAR service is 3.5 STAR so I'll level it out and give them a 4 overall. I came here for take out last year it was empty and it took forever for 2 meals. So I knew not to expect anything short of an hour when we went last night. 

My grandma had the Chicken and Dumpling Soup she said it was amazing! It looked really good she ate it so fast I couldn't steal a spoonful. My salad was fresh and crisp. I prefer a lot of dressing so the mini cup of ranch it came with was a teaser. For my entree I had the Turkey Ribs (3 big bones) usually turkey ribs are really small I was surprised they were a nice size and full of meat. All of the side I had were good and big in portion! Nothing is worse than getting small portion sides. That is not a problem here. If you like Greens then I highly suggest them. Top 3 Greens I've ever had. Mac and cheese was really good and not everyone can do good Mac so kudos to that. The yams were perfect I stole half of my daughters order lol my Uncle loved the Chicken and Waffles. The waitress made sure to make us aware that the chicken was going to take 22 mins to cook. 

We ordered our food when we order our drinks. Took about 20 mins for 5 drinks and about another 10 for the soup/salad app. Our food was delivered after about an hour. You almost forget what you are there for it takes so long. I had to ask for a refill 2 times and watch the waitress stand around for a few minutes before she decided to bring it. We sat by the door so I heard people complaining behind me because they couldn't get anyone to take their to go order. They have about 15-20 tables not all were full and like 4 servers being an ex server I expected the service to be stellar like the food."}
{"text":"Tasty, home cooked, comfort food served by nice people. Carmi's definitely makes you feel welcomed. Please don't come here if you're expecting a transcendent food experience -- the food is good but not great. But if you want an honestly good meal which will fills not only your body, but your soul, Carmi's is the joint.  

Btw -- We walked here from downtown. It's a beautiful trek with incredible views."}
{"text":"CAN I LIVE HERE?

Everything is good. I mean everything. Chicken, pork chops, meatloaf, mac and cheese, sweet potatoes, greens, smashed potatoes, fried corn, cabbage, cornbread all completely authentic down home cooking. Try the chicken or pork chops cooked in any preparation fried, smothered, blackened or bbq and you will not be sorry. My favorite is the smothered chicken or chops, that gravy is so good. The atmosphere is clean and a little outdated but endearing with old school r&b and gospel playing. Great, friendly and fast service. You must try the fish stew. It is beautiful and spicy. Really good grits too. It is BYOB 3.00 corking. It's also a great place to bring kids and my 14 year olds favorite place. Go for breakfast and it a great place for Sunday brunch. If you keep an eye out you can find it on groupon and amazon local. If you have family coming in from the south this is a great representation of Pittsburgh soul food."}
{"text":"This was my fourth visit to Carmi's and I have to say after the horrible service, wait for our food, and attitude from our waitress I will never go back. Like others have posted on UrbanSpoon, Google reviews, and Facebook, the silverware, cups, and dishes are filthy. When we arrived there were two 2-seat booths filled and one table of two. We placed our order for the fried chicken and the other tables vacated but another 2-person booth was filled behind us and then a larger booth with 4 people both of which ordered them same meals as us. In fact, the 2-person booth behind us order EXACTLY the same as us and we laughed but that laughter stopped when their food came out immediately and they were out the door before our meals even arrived. Our waitress was downright rude to us as well. When our order finally came, only my cousin's chicken dinner arrived and the waitress who brought out our meals (not our original) looked at me like I had two heads when I asked where mine was. So then we had to wait for my meal to come out. We also order ONE dish to go and they gave us TWO of those without the accompanying side dish (we decided it wasn't worth fighting over it to get it taken off and knew that we would just each take our own home instead), anyhow, when I asked about the accompanying side to go with it, our original waitress shot me a dirty look, rolled her eyes and acted like I was inconveniencing HER! Never again. As I saw one reviewer state on a FB review - your customers ARE what will keep you in business but you won't have any if you treat them like they are not welcome"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place based on recommendations after they have been open for less than a week on Carson Street. We were greeted by a friendly host and seated immediately. We had made prior reservations which I would totally recommend since it is not a huge location, and gets quite busy. We had incredibly funny and friendly waitress. I ordered the punch which was quite large for the price, and delicious. My better half order the chicken and waffles. I ordered The fried chicken meal with the greens and mac & cheese as my sides. I also opted to try the chicken dumpling soup, because who orders a salad at a soul food restaurant? Our food was absolutely amazing! And they can definitely hold the claim of the best greens you've ever had! So why am I only getting four stars instead of five? We waited about an hour for our food. We were told this by the person who recommended the restaurant, but it's still a little disheartening to show up, smell all that amazing food, and wait an hour. We will definitely be back."}
