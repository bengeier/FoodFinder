{"text":"This is definitely a decent/good Ramen spot. Everything I've ordered has been good from appetizers to the ramen. Service is good and fast. 

Atmosphere is good, the decor is great. Great lightning not too bright not too dark. 

So about the ramen. The broth is great, all the veggies on top are amazing..some of the sweetest bamboo shoots I've had which is a plus for me. The noodles are usually fantastic...sometimes they are hit or miss being a little clumped. Coming with a few roasted garlics on top is in my opinion a fantastic addition. The pork is like the noodles almost always great but sometimes it's perfectly tender or a little tough but always full of great flavor. 

The main reason this got a 4/5 star review is the hit or miss pork/noodles. And what seems to be tap water (which is extremely subjective) 

The speed at which the ramen is served is absolutely phenomenal another bonus. Comparable prices to other ramen places, if not a little bit better.

While Ramen-Tatsu, And Sora are two of my favorites the convenience of not having to drive on spring mountain and the fact this place is so close to my house, the convenience of that alone makes this place a much easier pick for me.

I hope this place continues to grow a good clientele, and succeed."}
{"text":"I would rate this place a zero, if it were possible.  In reality, the almost nonexistent menu, is really just one dish.  If you add or subtract broth and meat the entire menu is a pork ramen dish served with or without broth.  Incredibly asinine.  Coupled with an inattentive staff on a slow time, this is a business that will quickly disappear.  Another disappointment was their 'new kale noodles' which you could not order.  Wait a minute!  This is a new restaurant on its opening week with very little traffic.  Yikes!  Save yourself from this horrid restaurant and run the other direction."}
{"text":"Great ramen.  On par with jinya.  However this place is slightly less greasy and less salty than jinya.  Highly recommend black garlic ramen with pork added to it.  It's great."}
{"text":"Love this place! Been here 3 times this week & i cant get enough. Coming from Hawaii where there is Ramen everywhere, its hard to find a good ramen place that has all the right flavor. I love the garlic ramen, with a hint of spicy, its so good, so flavorful. If you are looking for a great ramen place I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The gyoza is delicious! It's not served with your traditional ponzu sauce but instead it's a thicker soy type of sauce. It's a nice change up from the norm. Highly recommend you trying it. Also ordered the Black Garlic Ramen. It was also delish!"}
{"text":"I found this by accident but what a delightful dinner. I had the pork dumplings and the Basil broth ramen. Both were completely delicious. I added pork, corn, and mushrooms. This will be on my list to visit again. Very, very, good."}
{"text":"Perfect for a ramen place! Love the food and service was great!!! This would be my new ramen spot. Deserves a recommendation to family and friends! Totally a thumbs up!!!"}
{"text":"This is my second time here in the last 2 weeks because we finally have a good ramen place In the area! The broth in both the miso and tonkotsu have so much flavor and they come with all the goods unlike other places that make you add them in. I will definitely be back again and again. Thank you Joseph for the great service!"}
{"text":"This was my first time having Ramen. I enjoy Pho but this dish was new to me. I had the Miso Ramen with pork and it was very good."}
{"text":"Great ramen at a good price.
Comes with a lot of toppings so you don't get nickled and diimed to death."}
{"text":"Good Ramen on the west side??  If you want Ramen and Spring Mountain is too far to drive, try KoKoRo.  Solid Ramen is served up in a cozy warm wood setting.  Service is friendly and quick! 
Tried the Shio Ramen... tasty without being overly rich... noodles were fresh with a good level of chewiness. Chicken Karaage were tender and delicious.   
It's good to finally have a decent ramen place on the west side!"}
{"text":"A great ramen place in the West Side. If you live west of the 215 and you're craving for some ramen, this is a good place to check out.

Broth is nice and light. Noodles are good and firm. I ordered some takoyaki and that was good too.  

Not too many people in this place as well when I went there around 6-ish. That would be a good thing if you're with a crowd as they will be able to accommodate you faster.  

The place is somewhat trendy. They were playing some music which sounds like that Japanese string instrument. I honestly liked it. Adds to the vibe.

Other than that, my suggestion is to further develop the broth. 

Food 4/5
Price 4/5
Venue 4/5
Service 4/5"}
{"text":"Tried this place last night. The Ramen is amazing! I had the tonkotsu and the pork was tender and had a great flavor. The egg was made perfectly and I let it soak in the broth until the end for a great ending. The noodles were great in my opinion. 

Also tried the karaage chicken and it was amazing. It had a bold flavor and was very tender and juicy (not dry). I will definitely be trying the place out again for a different style of ramen and will bring more friends. 

The staff is friendly/attentive and the restaurant is very inviting. 

It's so nice to have a ramen shop in the Summerlin area!"}
{"text":"It was totally disappointing ramen. I don't like luke warm soup for ramen. Server was not nice. They didn't look busy at all but she pushed us to pay the check sooner. I am not going to come back again."}
{"text":"Very good place. Reminds me of the times I would cook the same at home. Cool atmosphere. Will return again."}
{"text":"I was super bummed This place opened right AFER I moved from the area.. but I'm not mad anymore. 
Was in the area so I Picked up an order and every thing was great, EXCEPT the noodles. The were super bland, didn't taste homemade at all. Also asked for no seaweed it got it. I've also never been to a place that charges for spicy.
Service was great and food felt hot when I arrived.
I won't be back.. monta is my place"}
{"text":"Great ramen and never a line! Love that I don't have to wait forever to get decent noodles!"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of ramen and have gone to many locations here in Vegas. But hands down the first sip of ramen made this my favorite place. I couldnt wait to bring my wife here so that same night after she had gotten off work we made our way there and same experience amazing flavor and great servers. MUST GO!! Try:Niku ramen bowl."}
{"text":"Can't tell you how EXCITED I am about Ramen on this side of town. So tired of driving to actual Japan (Spring Mtn) for any ramen at all, let alone good ramen. My girlfriend and I came here for Valentine's day and we were 2 out of 4 people in the whole restaurant so the service was very quick. I think it took less than 5 minutes actually. 

We both ordered the Black Garlic, 1 spicy and 1 regular. BE ADVISED: the level 1 spicy is an experience. And I mean I get it, some people like to watch their mouth burn. Literally. So maybe this won't be so bad for you. But for me, your average hot wing kind of dude? This spicy ramen elevated my high by at least 100%. Anyways, try spicy if you're brave. And if you get extra spicy then don't even talk to me.

The dish itself was great all around. What a presentation- color and arrangement were traditional yet unique. Flavor good, texture of the pork was the perfect mix of meaty and chewy, the (regular) broth tasted like it took hours to prepare which I love. The egg was nothing special but it doesn't need to be because it's an egg and the minute you expect more out of eggs is the minute you have officially gone too far. I mean just order the extra spicy already why don't you. 

The noodles were cooked just right. I've had enough ramen experiences where the noodles were a game changer for all the wrong reasons and this was a nice refresher. They didn't break up in the bowl as I was mixing, had a nice color, and were packed with a rich pork flavor.

And finally, we had the Sake. We got the \"300ml Premium Sake\". It's about the size of a Coronita if you're not the measuring type of person. Now I'm no sake connoisseur but this went down super smooth. It was fruity and delicious and I would have more if I didn't have to drive.

If you couldn't tell by now, get the ramen. Don't go to a ramen house and order a rice bowl. Who does that? Get the ramen or go to Panda Express or something."}
{"text":"My first time here I had Garlic Oil Ramen to go. Portion seemed really small when I got it home. So I vowed to come sit in when i had the chance. 

Finally finding time to sit I ordered Tonkatsu Ramen. Broth was light and clean. Not too fatty. The Chashu was nice. Comes with half an egg. Portion is much bigger than it is when you take to go.  

Overall I am happy with the food especially since its a decent ramen shop outside of China Town. I will return."}
{"text":"Still good!! Everything is tasty and looks good. I love this place!! Also i like their Chasu Don. Chasu was very tender!!"}
{"text":"It was a rainy day afternoon in Vegas and hubby and I thought it's a great idea to have ramen for dinner and we ended up at this modern-chic Japanese place that serves delicious and yummy ramen Flamingo and 215.

We tried their Tokoyaki as appetizer and it was actually our first time to try one so we basically don't know how it should taste like or what flavor profile we are looking for. I ate majority of the tokayaki, hubby didn't really like the mayo-ish sauce. 
In terms of their Ramen, I ordered their Tonkatsu (my go to ramen broth) with pan fried kimchi and the kimchi really blends well with the tonkatsu broth that gave an added flavor to it. Hubby, got the Niku Ramen extra spicy and boy, oh boy, they are really spicy. We both finished our bowl of ramen and it really hit the spot.

Service was good and the place was not yet crowded when we stopped by so it was perfect because we don't have to wait to be seated to enjoy a delicious Ramen. 

Having a good Ramen place that is conveniently near our place was a major plus as well."}
{"text":"This is such a cute place. I was looking on the Yelp app for a Ramen place closest to Summerlin.  This place popped up and apparently it recently opened.  I took the entire family and to my surprise the food here was really yummy!  

I ordered the Black Garlic ramen and my husband ordered the Miso Ramen with extra pork. We had our kids there and they ordered the fried rice, the fries, and the kids meal ramen. I tried all of it and it was all quite good!  

Totally a hidden gem and I will be coming back again!  My favorite was their eggs!  I love it!! I don't want to always drive to Chinatown just to get some ramen! 

My only suggestion, serve some white wine would be nice."}
{"text":"I'm sad that Jumping Rice and Roll no longer exists. From what I understand, KoKoRo is owned by the same owners but instead of sushi and fried rice/noodles, it's all about the ramen now. They did keep a few things from the Jumping Rice menu including chicken mayo don, edamame, and garlic edamame. 

Onto the food: 

KoKoRo Japanese style French fries: Please DO NOT get this. I could've easily made this at home. It was frozen French fries (and not even the good kind) drizzled with okonomi and mayo sauce. This was such a disappointment.

Shoyu original ramen: I actually enjoyed the taste of this broth. You can definitely taste the pork and it wasn't salty. It comes with 2 slices of pork. My suggestion would be to maybe cook them a bit longer so it's more tender and soft? They were pretty chewy. 

Miso (spicy) ramen: my brother got this and I had a taste of his broth. Wasn't a fan of this one. The spicy level was too much for me and the taste of the miso wasn't a favorite of mine. It had an odd taste to it and I just can't put my finger on it. 

The ramen were cooked more on the al dente side so if you like your noodles more soft, make sure to let the servers know. 

Service was attentive and the 2 girls that were working treated us well. 

Since they are new, I would give them a chance again."}
{"text":"Weird.  Very, very  limited menu and they were out of the\"new\" kale noodles (how can they be new if this restaurant just opened?  Wouldn't everything there be new?) when I asked.   And when she asked if I was ready to order I did and she walked away right when I started to talk.   It wasn't horrible but it wasn't great either.  Meh"}
{"text":"This place is really good! I had the garlic ramen dish spicy and yes it was really spicy ! Really good fresh flavors. I have to admit I like it better than monta and jinya. Try the takoyaki it's yummy too !"}
{"text":"I usually order over the phone for pick up, and my order is always ready within 10 minutes and correct.  I have ate in a few times, and their service is great. All dishes I have tried have tasted great, especially their garlic edamame."}
{"text":"I was disappointed with fried rice...there....Ramen Sora and Monta makes better fried rice flavour with red gingers & white pepper powder. I like black garlic ramen there but side dishes are not very good and very tiny gyoza...I still like Monte & Sora ramen the best in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"It was my first time trying ramen and I am so glad I came here. The food was amazing and the atmosphere was relaxing. Our server was informative and extremely nice. I definitely recommend it and will be coming again."}
{"text":"First time at this Ramen place. We were greeted once we walked in and given a table. Shortly after a group of four was sat down near us. We ordered with the waiter, and our drinks were put in and given right away. Now this is where it went south. The waiter and waitress were running circles around each other, and werent clear. Our soups were given to the wrong people and me and my husband knew right away. Took them a while to figure it out tho and just kept giving the other group our stuff. Finally after 10-15 mins they come up to us and say sorry there was a mix up. Okay I get it, this is a new place Ill give them the benefit of the doubt. Now after another 10 minutes or more they bring my husbands soup. He decides to wait till mine comes out. We wait basically until his soup is cold and still don't have my meal. Not once did they come tell me it will be right out. 

Obviously they saw that he was waiting for me and ended up finally bringing my meal and a new one for him which was nice and we appreciated it. 

Overall it was a very frustrating experience. They tried to make it better and thats appreciated. 

The food was okay not really worth the trouble, We hope the best for this company but they definitely need some better organization whether its table assignments per waiter or something and more communication with customers."}
{"text":"Great place! Good customer service. Attentive staff willing to help and explain the menu. Also - the food was excellent!"}
{"text":"Really good food! Got the spicy tonkatsu ramen. Finally, a Japanese restaurant that makes spicy food when you ask for spicy. 

5 Stars because in addition to the good food, they were playing Ed Sheeran."}
{"text":"Smooth, deeply flavorful tonkotsu broth (spicy and black garlic also add depth, but not required). Noodles are the thicker, chewier kind which I prefer and the chashu pork is amazingly melty with a charred exterior. Great bowl of ramen!"}
{"text":"Mediocre food and service, overpriced compared to Chinatown. Acceptable if you want decent ramen on the west side of town without the wait but I'd suggest driving the extra ten minutes down to Spring Mountain for the real deal."}
{"text":"Such a great Ramen place! My server was excellent! I had the Shoyu Ramen, and my favorite part about it was the broth. It had a nice and rich taste to it. The noodles and meat were good too. I will for sure be coming again. It's a little far out, but it's worth my time."}
{"text":"This place used to be Jumping Rice & Rolls but has now turned into a ramen place with the same staff. My sister ordered the tonkotsu ramen and I ordered the spicy miso ramen. Wasn't a big fan of either of the ramen that we ordered as it tasted watered down and just flavorless. We also tried their Japanese french fries which sounded attractive but was a disappointment. All it really is is fries with takoyaki sauce drizzled over it. Aside from the food, the staff was very nice and attentive and gave recommendations of what's popular, but unfortunately I wasn't a big fan of my order. Considering this place is new I'm more than willing to give it a second visit."}
{"text":"Located where jumping rolls and rice used to be, so glad we came! After a long day of running around, I wanted soup and ramen was the first thing that came to mind. I had this place bookmarked and saw that they have black garlic ramen so we decided on this place. The food was delicious. I don't normally order chashu bowl but so glad I did tonight. Let me tell you, the chashu melts in your mouth! Mmm mmm mmm! I really enjoyed our order tonight. The black garlic ramen was exceptional! Plus, my husband usually complains about bamboo shoots and normally give them to me but this time, he enjoyed it. It had a sweet flavor to it which is good coz my husband loved it! Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"What an awesome spot for some great ramen! I ordered the miso ramen and the broth was flavorful and delicious. The fried brussels sprouts along with the sauce were the bomb.com. My boyfriend ordered the garlic oil ramen and he loved it as well. 

I was really impressed with their customer service, they were kind and on top of everything making sure our drinks were refilled and we had everything we needed. This place is small but cozy and has a nice clean modern feel. 

Overall I would come back and try a different ramen just to see how awesome the next one is."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Lots of options and the flavor is great. The decor is nice and roomy.  Service was friendly and very fast."}
{"text":"Our new favorite place.. i love the garlic ramen.. very tasty.. and they have a lot of appetizer choices.. reasonable price.. nice place, friendly staff.."}
{"text":"For the miso ramen, the soup is tasty, the toppings have variety, but the noodles seem pre-cooked or was left out for a while. Mine was like a hard chunk of ramen and I had to use my chopsticks to stir it around. Our other bowl had one hard chunk too. 
Ramen is supposed to be prepared fresh so the noodles won't stick together. I hope it was only mine, if not, I feel like the basics of ramen noodles is missing."}
{"text":"This review is for 3.5 stars.

I was close to a 4 but not quite there. Service was fine but honestly overly in-your-fcae.   Might be because there was only one other table occupied so servers were bored and trying to work, but it's a little intrusive when my water is being filled whenever it's 1/3 done and I'm being asked how everything is when a have a mouth full of noodles. 

The tonkatsu ramen, extra spicy, had good broth.  Pretty spicy and not too much meaty flavor.  The chasu was some of the best I've had in town - thick and fatty, almost like pork belly.  The noodles were very average and food store quality.  The rest of the ramen sides were probably below average, just raw ingredients and boiled egg rather than the good ramen-style egg.  My biggest peeve was that the extra spicy addition was $0.75 cents.  At that price, I want my face to burn, but it wasn't more than just chili oil.  

KoKoRo seems pretty good for a quick ramen or takeout, especially when there's not many options in that area, but not in the top 5 by any means in Vegas."}
{"text":"I LOVE ramen and I have been to many around town, this is a great spot.
I ordered the spicy miso ramen because it comes with everything I order extra at other places, corn and a soft boiled egg.
My boyfriend ordered the black garlic oil ramen spicy.
We loved both of our ramens.
I can handle A LOT of spice so just so you know spicy is like a mild.
So for me it wasn't spicy enough but I started slow and wanted to not overdo it on my first try.
My only minor complaint was the miso ramen was supposed to come with garlic and I didn't see it anywhere :( 
Bummer 
I also prefer the ground pork that comes in Ramen Sora and Kobo, because it sticks to the noodles and creates more texture and flavor so I hope they add that as an add on option.
That would make this place even better for me personally.
Service was kind and fast. 
I'll be back."}
{"text":"Tried this as another option for Monta. Had the  Tonkatsu ramen good broth and noodles, spice options and whole roasted garlic in the broth - yummy.

Oh the Kara-age, great!

The music was a bit questionable, but they changed it when asked.

Overall very good and we will be back."}
{"text":"Broth flavor didn't seem as developed and the other noodle houses in town. I'll probably be back, because it's so close to my house but I wouldn't drive here with so many great options just 5 miles away in Chinatown."}
{"text":"Interesting enough place but the food just isn't very good. I would normally write a longer review but there just isn't much else to say beyond that. The fries were probably the best thing we had but how can you mess up fries anyway?"}
{"text":"Got the garlic ramen and was blown away by the flavor. I will absolutely be back. Staff was attentive and Joy let us know about some coming additions to the menu. Highly recommend getting your feet wet with the initial offering. My boyfriend and I are looking forward to next time!"}
{"text":"I am excited to have a new ramen place close by! I shared both the Spicy Garlic Ramen and the Miso Ramen with my partner and had the Cashu Rice Bowl as an appetizer. 

The service was great, and we were seated in a personal booth that was intimate which I like. We were quickly served the Chasu rice bowl to start with. I really enjoyed the combo of the saltiness of the meat and the balance of the onions and rice together. For the main course, I definitely preferred the Spicy Garlic Ramen because it was more savory and salty compared to the Miso Ramen, which was a bit sweeter of a broth. My partner preferred the miso, so it's all to your preference. You can tell the noodles aren't made fresh, but it didn't ruin the meal. Because of this, I would come here again for convenience and if I'm craving a ramen nearby, but I would probably go to Chinatown for homemade noodles."}
{"text":"Having lived in Japan for 5 years and also having tried other the local Las Vegas ramen restaurants, I would give this place a \"meh\". We stumbled on this place and it has been open only 2 days, so we hit it at their soft opening. Water is tap, not filtered and tastes of chlorine. Fried gyoza was just ok, more like a vegetarian gyoza and had edamame in it, weird. I had the Black Garlic ramen. The broth was not bad. Noodles were just ok, a little fat and chewy. The soft boiled egg was cold in the center and not seasoned at all. I won't be in a hurry to get back, but might try in a few months after they work the bugs out."}
{"text":"My work partner and I went here for lunch, at around 5pm the place was empty. I got the Tonkotsu Ramen and it was on point, the broth was smooth and rich and the noodles had i nice bite to them. Joy our waitress was super nice and kept a smile on her face. I had $10 for lunch and money was well spent today."}
{"text":"This ramen was sooooo good! And the price is amazing! The service was excellent, too. I highly recommend this place. I had the black garlic oil ramen. I did not eat the whole cloves of garlic but appreciated them being there. When I am back on that side of town, I will return to enjoy some more ramen."}
{"text":"A hidden ramen gem, buried in a maze of burgers, pizza and ice cream joints. In fact, we were in the area because a taco place caught our eye. But I digress. 

Delicious food. Excellent service. Non-pretentious. Friendly helpful staff. Extensive menu with traditional foods & drinks as well as more ubiquitous offerings. 

We would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Workers can't understand English I do not eat meat (pescatarian) so I asked the guy if it had pork in the miso ramen because I do not eat meat he said \"no mam no pork in ramen\" and guess what? My order comes without corn that I ordered and with meat so I tell him excuse me I asked for no meat. And he looks at me confused like if he can't understand what I'm saying in simple words. Then he says \"you no tell me no pork sorry\" like what?! I clearly did tell him I was not about to argue he should take it back to remake but instead he wanted to turn the tables on me. It should not be this difficult to get a order right the first time maybe they should hire someone who understand English if they are going to be taking orders."}
{"text":"First time here. Grand opening. Not crowded. Nice relaxing ambience. We started with the fried Brussel sprouts for an appetizer. We then added the fried shrimp and shishito pepper appetizers. For the main course we had the spicy pork don and a Tonkotsu ramen bowl with pork belly. Everything was delish and served hot. 

3 Sapporo large beers and a tab for $55. What a deal! We had plenty to take home too!"}
{"text":"Worst ramen I've had in town. Never been a huge fan of the ramen choices in Vegas, and Shoku was at the bottom of the list for a long time. The tonkotsu ramen looked delicious, but it tasted like burnt garlic and milk. The chashu had barely any flavor (which is surprising, because it's supposed to be super fatty pork)."}
{"text":"There's many things to be said about a great Ramen Ramen place. This place's advantage. Its close to my Dad's place. And he loves Ramen, so do I. So why three stars? Well let me walk you through it. 

The place itself how should I describe it. It is relatively small. They made the front of the restaurant into a waiting area which I think would've been better as a place for more tables. Not that the place was swarming with people. Its just that it gives off that vibe of wasted space. Its totally up to the owners but that's just my opinion. The overall ambience is nice. There was a party of 12 people across from Me and my Dad and even with a small shop it didn't seem to noisy. My guess is that the place can sit maybe 28 people. But how they have their tables arranged doesn't look too cramped. Unlike some other shops where it feels like you're a sardine packed in a can, all for the sake of Ramen. 

Service, let's talk about that. Not too shabby. There were two servers up at the time we visited. My guess is they were still getting used to working at the place because they seemed shy at approaching us. I don't bite, well unless you're made out of Noodles that is. Nothing bad though, like I said the place is new. I'm pretty sure by the time the shop kicks up the servers will probably be more acquainted with what they need to do. We got our waters pretty fast although I always try and see if they have Calpico. Which they did, not refillable though. And here I though my fatass found a gem. The food took a bit of time due to the larger party versus just me and my dad. Unless you take an hour to serve a bowl of Ramen, I don't think that's an issue. And one of the best parts about this restaurant. The chopsticks man! Yes the chopsticks! Holy cannoli(sorry I know this is a Japanese restaurant) I mean to each his own but one thing I absolutely hate about being served wooden chopsticks is when you dine out with ither people. They start rubbing the sticks together like they're trying to light a fire. I mean come on! And the same excuse every single time \"I don't want splinters.\" Unless you're purposely rubbing the stick on your gums as hard as you can you will not get splinters. Sorry about the rant. They have plastic Chopsticks. That's where I was getting to. And they look kind of fancy too. The tip is kind of rough to hold the food better. But this isn't a chopstick review isn't it. Moving on. 

The food, hmmm how do I put it? There's parts I like and parts I don't fancy. So granted I only ordered one bowl of Ramen then a bowl of Katsu with rice I've noticed a few things. I would need to come back a few more times to really nail the food review down but here's my two cents. I ordered the Shoyu based broth. The taste, there's better places. But its a really close competitor to my favorite Ramen place. The noodles have some chew to them. Not as chewy as I would like them to be but not bad. The standout in my bowl of ramen would be the Chashu, it was tasty. It tasted like it was seared a bit before serving. Either that or the chef has mad Chashu skills. If I would come back to this place, I would pile on the Chashu. Seriously, it was that good. Don't quote me though. I'm not picky with food. Just a guy who likes things that are tasty. Onto the rice bowl. I ordered their Mayo Chicken. At least that's what it looked to me. I don't have a menu on hand while I'm writing this review. Stop it, I'm not a food critic. Just some dude who likes Ramen shops. The chicken katsu was diced up with some mayo put on top. I would prefer the katsu to be whole. That's just me though. The portion for the rice bowl was pretty big. The dish itself is tasty but I couldn't finish it. I was already full, it had nothing to do with the taste. I still wished their calpico was refillable though. 

Overall I would say this place can become a competitor but its still new so not a lot of people know it yet. I'll come back a few more times since I'm interested to what they have t"}
{"text":"New favorite Japanese ramen place! It's quite and cute place. I like that you make your own ramen. Simply you pick a base soup and toppings you want. My favorite is a black garlic ramen with extra spicy."}
{"text":"Solid ramen place on this side of Vegas. The pork is fantastic. The black garlic is awesome!"}
{"text":"Had the Tonkatsu, Miso, and Black Garlic Ramen, fried rice, gyoza, Karaage and everything was on par with pretty much any of the go to Ramen joints in town. 
Jinya, Kobo, Sora, Tatsu, Monta, Moko, IzakayaGo are many of our favorites and believe it or not, I would put this place as an instant favorite. There's finally one on the more west side of town!"}
{"text":"I went here for dinner with my family. Ramen was good and my favorite is spicy don. A lady who served for our table was nice and fun!!!"}
{"text":"Very tasty ramen, we'll be back. We had Shoyu ramen and Black Garlic ramen, enjoyed them both. Also had deep fried Brussels sprouts, which were tempura battered and good."}
{"text":"Food was good. I can't say the food or service did anything different that distinguishes itself apart from other ramen places. The one thing that stood out to me was how they made their Calamari Tempura. It definitely was not the traditional version of how most restaurants make it. I had the Tonkotsu Ramen Noodles. I would come back with my family and gladly eat here again."}
{"text":"Overall, just okay.  I'm somewhat of a ramen maniac, and this isn't one of my favorites in town, not even top 5.  The best thing in my black garlic ramen was the chashu, really excellent bbq quality and thick.  The broth was mediocre and only warm from the beginning so it was cold by the time I was halfway through the bowl, this is a big negative for me.  Nice amount of whole roasted garlic chunks.  I'm pretty spoiled by all the house-made noodle joints we have now in Vegas, so I didn't really like the noodles here - it's a thicker and chewy style, similar to those packs you can buy at the grocery.  The ramen is plenty filling, you get a sufficient amount of noodles and the broth is a thick, rich, fatty style.  My husband got the spicy and said it was equivalent to Kobo medium spicy level.

Chicken karaage was alright, just a little plain.  Takoyaki was good, cooked through properly.  I would probably come here again if I were primarily needing a ramen place with a lot of appetizer & side dish options."}
{"text":"I'd give this place 3.5 stars. Ramen is ok i got he miso. They don't have the pink radish which is kinda surprising."}
{"text":"Popped in for lunch today solo. What a treat?! I was seated right away, the vibe of this place is super cool, which can sometimes deter the foodiest of foodies away. But I'll tell you the music was hip, at a comfortable volume, the lighting was nice, and the food...omg so good. I had the Niku ramen, which came with two slices of pork, tender and tasty, and a helping of spicy pork, a soft boiled egg, protein packed yay, mushrooms and bamboo, in a tasty, not over salted, pork bone broth. So damn good and rich. And the service was superb. I really don't have enough nice things to say about this place. Normally I go heavy on all my portions, but this was all I ordered and I was more than satisfied, I struggled to finish it out of being full. And I was not about to waste a drop. Seriously you guys, I hardly came up for air once, it was that tasty and dynamic. Each bite was an adventure. I work just down the street and expect to come once a week for lunch. So happy I came in. Keep it up! Look at all that goodness."}
{"text":"I was interested to see what replaced Jumpin' Rice and Rolls (since I got really sick last time I went), and I was pleasantly surprised. It was a cozy little restaurant, with a tasty menu! I ordered one of their fried rice, and the pork belly was so good! But the fried rice was kind of salty to me, so I didn't take that one home. 

However, their fries and ramen are items you definitely should order! It wasn't enough to wow me, but still tasty. The staff were super nice. They always came checking to see if I was okay, and if I needed anything else. So, I think it's worth checking it out at least once."}
{"text":"Joy was our waitress and she was awesome . This is the second time we have been here and love it . We actually drove across town just to go here and it is well worth it . We decided to try some new appetizers and the fried Brussels sprouts were amazing ! We also got the ramen and the broth had a perfect balance of flavors.  We usually go to China Town to get our ramen and this was better than most of the places we've tried (which are most in town ) . The food  so far is consistently good no matter what we've ordered and the service was just as impressive . Can't wait to try a new menu item the next time we come here ."}
{"text":"We are a regular customer here! Love the atmosphere of this place, not crazy crowded , able to relax and enjoy the food! They just update their menu and added more items on the menu, the noodle is as phenomenal as always! Love the unique taste of the torched chashu adding some smoking flavor into each bowl of noodle:) and their agendashi tofu is also hot and juicy ! :)"}
{"text":"My favorite ramen spot!! I always get the Tonkotsu ramen. The servers have started to recognize me by now embarrassingly enough even though I've only been going there for a few weeks... I have no shame though and will continue to eat here-it's just that good. 
The Chicken Mayo Don was bomb and the Takoyaki is yummy! 
The servers are friendly and I've yet to see it crazy busy, so they're always able to accommodate a walk-in."}
{"text":"So I decided to check out the new place of business that took over jumping rice & rolls. It's pretty much the same inside, some paint more seating and different music. Which it already looked amazing so understand staying with a budget, when entering it's very strange how benches are in front of you and you don't know to sit your self or what luckily someone popped out to seat us.  

One of the better ramen places I've had today I went with the miso it's was pretty good and I might come back again to try some others. For now I'll stick with my other two favorite ramen spots as this one is a challenge entering/exiting the parking lot."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, second experience is bringing this place down.  The place still smells like bleach...and the ramen was bitter from the black garlic oil this time.  The noodles were also slightly overcooked.  The inconsistencies might make us drive a little further to Ramen Kobo.  Also, the lamp above our table had two dead bulbs so it was super dark.  Takoyaki was still legit though."}
{"text":"Yummy yummy ramen. I ordered to-go from this restaurant. I've been wanting to try it since it opened and it didn't disappoint.

I ordered my go-to ramen style- Tonkotsu. I got extra pork cuz I like things meaty. I love that this came with egg and it wasn't an add on.  I did order it \"spicy\" which for some reason is an extra cost. The spice level was perfect for me. 

The take away set came in 2 containers with the broth by itself. The amount of broth fit perfectly into the container with the other goodies. I wish there was more broth though. 

I really enjoyed this ramen and I'll be back for more. It was delicious, rich, and flavorful"}
{"text":"A good Ramen spot. If I'm craving ramen on the way home from work, this location is convenient for me. It may not be the best, but if you're in the area and don't wanna drive all the way down to China town, I recommend this place."}
{"text":"I went to this ramen place at 2 in afternoon. It was not that busy and the server served me immediately and he introduced me the menu since it was my first time visited the place. I ordered Takoyaki and black garlic ramen. It was good and the BGM was nice. 

The chopsticks is very unique, unlike the one used in other places. 

I will definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Delicious food.  The squid balls were fantastic.  The Ramen was equally delicious and savory.   The service was \"ok\" my only gripe is that the portion size of the ramen was VERY small.  Paying $12-14 for a bowl of soup you expect something bigger.   About 2 hours after dinner I found myself making a sandwich at home because I was hungry.    I'll for sure go back but it will be more around lunch."}
{"text":"I think i found my new favorite ramen spot !!

wifey recommended this try this place out since it was fairly new...

walking up to the restaurant.. they had this awesome \"ramen life\" poster on their store front.. right away i had a feeling this place was going to be awesome..

walking in.. got greeted by our host / waiter.. and sat us right away.. since it wasn't too busy.. (dinner time) - im sure this place will start getting busy very soon.. 

decor was very nice and very simple.. they do have cool wall art decoration towards the bathroom.. and the lighting was a little bit dark and the lights were a little bit dim.. so all you \"must take a picture of my food before eating it\" people.. maybe use a flash or little spot light to get that nice lighting effect.. (or sit somewhere else - we were towards the back by the bathroom).. or go during the day??

when i usually ramen.. i go for the black garlic style ramen if they have it.. or i ask for black garlic oil.. this place had a dedicated black garlic ramen.. (vampires beware).. awesome !

also ordered a chashu bowl - what they call \"chasudon\" and an order of gyoza because why not.. their prices are very reasonable !!

everything tasted awesome and exceeded my expectations... my wife (who ordered the same thing) thought that it was too \"garlic-y\" (must be a vampire).. but i did not mind at all.. maybe add some butter or vinegar.. if you don't like too \"garlic-y\"

water was very cold and filtered.. 

the host/waiter provided great service.. (refilling my water.. asking if we want anything else.. getting vinegar for my wife.. etc...)

will definitely come back.. for sure !!

enjoy !"}
{"text":"Very cute place! Waiters were kind and the food was great. I ordered the vegetable ramen and my friend ordered the tonkotsu ramen. We also shared a fried rice."}
{"text":"This place is good since it's a decent ramen place in this area near where I work. This place replaced jumping rice and roll. Service is good, they don't forget about you! I ordered two things: the chashu don and the miso ramen. The chashu don is really good! The pork has a powerful taste in the pork, which is good. The miso ramen was okay, tastes like any other miso out there in Vegas. The noodles were a little bit chewy too. Overall this place is good though!"}
{"text":"Love their fried rice, pork belly bowl, and pork chatsu ramen! It tastes like from out of country !!"}
{"text":"Ramen is one of my favorite foods. Saw that this place had opened, but had no interest coming here since I already have my usual ramen spots around town. Then one night, we decided to eat somewhere different because sometimes going to Chinatown can be a real headache.

When we walked in, only one table was occupied and the restaurant was very clean. As I was browsing the menu, the food didn't appeal to me. I know I'm being petty, but my preference is to keep things simple. Throwing 7 different toppings on ramen may make it look pretty, but it doesn't make the taste excellent. Unfortunately, they also didn't have any toppings that I usually eat with my ramen. Would have preferred (and paid for) other options like kamaboko, beef, or even tofu. But you can't have everything, right? NBD, I ended up ordering the Miso Ramen with just chasu and corn. The broth was just okay. It wasn't the best that I tasted, but it also wasn't super bland or disappointing. Did not like their thick noodles and the fatty charsu. One more thing I have to add is that we tried the Kokoro Japanese Style Fries, which looked good from the photos here on yelp. Guess I wasn't a fan of the Oknomi sauce, which made it kind of sweet. For me, fries should not taste sweet for any reason, lol. 

On a side note, customer service was friendly and attentive. My husband also liked his ramen better than I liked mine. Maybe I'll give this place another chance in the future. But when I eat ramen, I need to love it. So I'll be going back to my usual spots!"}
{"text":"This place just opened, this used to be Jumping rice, same owners different restaurant concept. Considering that they just opened, I will cut them some slack and since also this is the closest Ramen place in the south west, so I really do want them to improve coz there is a high chance I will come back. I was about to give them 4 stars, but had decided on 3 stars based on these factors.
- the shoyu broth- though it did not look like shoyu, it looked more like a tonkatsu, they explained that it is because they use a pork broth base.. this was the best broth out of all that we ordered. This one was just right.
-the black garlic ramen, was a tad bit salty, although still good flavor
-the kids Ramen the broth was horrible, it was way way way too Salty, this made it almost inedible to me, though my nephew devoured his
-the chicken karrage had good flavor, but it seemed  like it was not quite cooked, it looked a tad bit pinkish and raw, although the flavor was good, just maybe need to be cooked a little bit more
- the chashu pork was not as good as other places though.. it seemed like they used just a regular pork belly, it was ok, but it was not melt in your mouth delicious chashu pork 

So with a few minor adjustments, this new ramen place has a potential to become a 5 star place for me, I would like to try their rice dishes next time since I did like jumping rice."}
