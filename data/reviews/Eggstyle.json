{"text":"A bright, pleasant breakfast spot close to our hotel.  We ate here several times during our 2 weeks in Brossard.  Come hungry.  They certainly fill your plate.  Crepes, waffles, pancakes, omelets, blintzes, they have it all.  They serve free coffee with your meals and always make sure it's topped off.  The weekday staff speak very little English.  However, a hostess and other staff show up for the weekend morning rush, most of which are competent English speakers.  Either way, we had no problem making understood what we wanted.  Can't account for the other negative reviews.  Maybe the people up here have higher standards than what I'm used to back in the States."}
{"text":"Wide variety of breakfast items, Eggstyle has everything from sides and steak & eggs to dessert crêpes. Great quality food, way above that of your usual chain restaurant. Fast service and attentive servers."}
{"text":"Both Eggstyles in Brossard (the one located in dix30 and this one located closer to Costco) are, as the name suggests, stylish. That is, in comparison to the normal breakfast joint.  However, the food isn't memorable or even particularly good.  The odd thing about one of my dishes was that they served my smoked salmon bagel with tomato inside.  The combination was not very good, and I did not like the fact that they built my salmon bagel on a semi-burnt bagel.  I'd recommend this spot only if you care more about ambiance than breakfast food."}
{"text":"Tres bon restaurant à dejeuner. Ils offrent aussi une variété de smoothi delicieux. Les serveuses sont toujours souriante et tres efficace. C'est l'endroit parfait pour bien commencer la journée!"}
{"text":"WOW. Great service, Great food! First time here, we were pleasently surprised and loved it! Portions were a bit big, but worth the quality and cost. The added touch of a small bowl of hot apples gave the dish a homey feel. We were seated right away and service was quick, friendly and efficient.  A must try for the Area!! Also it has free Wifi!!"}
{"text":"Eggstyle's major problem for me is its pricing vs its value.   While the quality of the food we ate was decent enough, it lacked portion control. When breakfast plates cost $12-13 each, I'd expect the food I order to have more sides content.  For example my wife ordered the strawberry surprise crepe (check picture). It was very good but where are the sides? Where are the potatoes? The fruits? The toast? FEED ME!!!!  I ordered a ham egg Benedict, it was good. I've had better, it however did come with some potatoes, which were excellent and some fruits... but that's it. Where are my toasts?  Mind you this is a $13 breakfast. I can eat like a king at Cosmopolitan or Allo Mon Coco at this price. It's a hard sell and tough to recommend when there are better options nearby.  Sorry.  Other notes :  - The service was completely overwhelmed, we waited 20+ minutes to sit down (and they had two entrances?). It took our waitress well over 15 minutes to take our order after we flagged her down.  - Free Wifi!"}
{"text":"Bon déjeuner standard. Les saucisses sont des galettes plates... ordinaire."}
{"text":"I went there on a quiet weekday. I ordered the meat lovers eggs Benedict while my friend ordered the meat lovers plate. The portions are very generous as we were both full at the end.   There is a choice of 3 styles of Hollandaise sauce for the eggs Benedict (classic, cheese and I forget the last). I picked the classic and it was amazing.  I couldn't identify what it was but there seemed to be a spice or something that really enhanced the taste.  The potatoes that came with our plate were also delicious. I found they were a little on the salty side but my friend thought they were seasoned perfectly, so be aware if you don't like them too salty.   My plate came with a lot of fruits which were varied and fresh. My friend's did not have as many fruits but it did come with hot cinnamon apples which were delicious.   Overall, I find that the food was much better than the average breakfast joint and there is a lot to choose from the menu. The service was quick (although the restaurant was practically empty) and friendly."}
{"text":"Dimanche 7 avril 2013 Eggstyle est un endroit \"stylé\" pour déjeuner mais le menu ne l'est pas. Les plats sont en tous points pareils à ceux rencontrés dans tous les autres endroits à brunch avec, en plus, un service lent, un stationnement pratiquement impossible, c'est un endroit beaucoup trop petit pour la quantité de clients qui y arrivent, combiné avec un service trop lent, c'est le chaos. Les prix sont trop élevé pour ce que vous y mangez.  Sunday april 7th 2013 Eggstyle is simply a \"stylish\" place to eat, nothing more. The menu doesn't follow. Everything is the same as any other brunch place and more to that, slow service or really slow service, impossible parking (no accessible parking spot or very hard to find), it's too small for all the clientele it receives, combined with a slow service, it's chaos. The prices are high in comparaison to what you really get."}
