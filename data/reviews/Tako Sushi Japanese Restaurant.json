{"text":"The food is not great but the price is ok. We don't come for the service but we don't have to wait for a seat during the Sunday lunch hour so it's bearable. If we have a group larger than 8, we get the party special. Otherwise the other lunch specials are reasonably priced (about $8-10)."}
{"text":"Takeout at Tako! Horrible. Awful, thick crusted shriveled tempura. Quality has gone downhill."}
{"text":"A solid 3 stars for this place, which is fine when you don't need to have fancy food.    We ordered a Salmon Love Boat (30 sashimi pieces for $12) and bento boxes each.   Sashimi pieces were nice generous thick slices, decently fresh.  Bento boxes had quite a lot of food.  Mine had spring rolls, rice, steamed veg, shrimp and veg tempura, and ribs.  While the food is definitely not the best I've ever had, it was basically the same as many Chinese places, which was decent enough.    Atmosphere was nice and quiet, service was decent, waiters were pretty friendly and helpful.    Looking at the rest of the menu, there are some items that seemed interesting, such as lobster sashimi, which very few places sell and are generally very expensive.  Here it is $19 for the head and claw, which is not bad.    All in all, not that bad when you don't feel like spending gobs of money.  We each paid $22."}
{"text":"I HIGHLY recommend this restaurant! It's my second most favourite sushi restaurant. The sushi is so good, and bento boxes are just delicious. I went here a couple of times for my birthday and for special occasions and I never get disappointed.  Just one thing that could be improved: the waiting for the food .-. Like it take quite a while. But overall the food was worth the wait"}
{"text":"This is truly a 'meh, i've experienced better' sort of experience. Not bad.....just....was expecting better. Keep in note - the owner and servers, and I assume the chefs, arn't Japanese. Or even Korean. They're chinese. No offense to Chinese yelpers, I just expect a big fancy popular Japanese restaurant to actually be Japanese. Tempura was oily and heavy, not crisp and light. Left me with oily lips and a churning stomach. The portions are larger than I expected, I could barely even dig into my main of my bento 'complete meal'. Service was pretty lousy, but I counted 4 servers in a big, busy restaurant, so whatevs."}
{"text":"Disappointed... Not organization at all when restaurant is busy.. They dont bring you all meal at once, they confuses you with small portions every 10-15 minutes, definitely i wont step in there in a long time... If... If i step in it again..."}
{"text":"Where to start? I should have probably read the reviews on yelp before going to the restaurant .. but I didn't ..  .. btw before i get started why is there filtered reviews? maybe i missed something ..;  anyways went here for lunch with a co-worker because its close to the office .. the decor is okay and we were quickly seated but thats as good as it got .. none of the staff make eye contact, everything is slow even tho the establishment wasn't busy, there was just no importance on quality ..   we ordered one of the lunch specials, the pricing is good, but I learned a long time ago, you get what you pay for, so for $7 to $15 you can get a salad, appetizer, sushi, chicken/beef, dessert, etc  the food was cold and really average, they forgot our sushi and when we pointed it out to the manager he said he would take it off our bill .. a whole $1.20?? for 6 sushi rolls .. like i said u get what u pay for ..  my co-worker, who is from hong kong blasted the manager, but he was no help...  so i will never go back .. but the experience got me back to using yelp! ;)"}
{"text":"Worst restaurant experience EVER. Over priced & small portion compared to any sushi bar i've been in the entire GTA. $50 sashimi boat is worse than $20 sushi plate...never going back ever again. Muscle soup which the server said would have more muscle than soup had dinkie little muscles that were empty...and had more soup...! Don't even mention the service...wasn't good.period. We were too furious with the crappy food. We didn't realize that servers only came by to give us our orders. It's in the don mills area so it would get a lot of corporate employee...I highly recommend you to go somewhere else for your money. This isn't a restaurant that you would walk out happy after eating."}
{"text":"I don`t know how to put this nicely but I`m pretty much never coming back. I`m giving it 1.5 stars because the service was decent but the food and atmosphere could be improved (the place looked old and not well kept).   The thing that killed it for me was I started to notice that there were a lot of flies flying around which gets really annoying, and then I looked at the wall and realized that the specks of black were not part of the wallpaper but in fact baby flies (there were at least 7 of them!). They were not moving so I assumed they were dead... which makes me wonder why no one had cleaned them off the wall yet.  This happened half way into my meal... and then I totally lost my appetite. So that`s pretty much why I`ll never go back. Bugs flying around - even worse, dead bugs lying around - aren`t really what I`m looking for in a resto..."}
{"text":"WOW I'm so shocked at all the bad reviews given to this place! I've been a fan of this place for over three years. It's fairly close to my house, it's a nice sized restaurant with not bad decor. The service isn't bad despite what everyone says, yes, they do gossip in Chinese but when they serve me, they are also nice and bring me what I ask for. The food is great, not the best Japanese food but for the price I pay, I'm more than satisfied. Lunch bento costs as low as $6, and the most expensive one for lunch is around $12. You get so much food, including dessert and appetizer... this place just rocks my world.   I still go once a month, at LEAST. Love this place, and it's always packed."}
{"text":"I walked into Tako Sushi with a small group on a weekday evening. The place was bustling with people and the restaurant looked clean, modern and spacious. The warm colored interior and slightly dimed lights created a cozy atmosphere, even though the place was almost packed and somewhat loud.  Their menu is pretty big and they offer more than just sushi. Their dine-in menu includes appetizers, sushi & sashimi, special rolls, live lobster, BBQ beef short ribs, curry, cutlets, grilled salmon, set course meals, teppanyaki dishes and so much more. They also advertise their room for parties and offer specially priced party menus. There is also another section to the restaurant where the chefs make food at your table. The price is generally moderate but some dishes on the menu can be pretty pricey.  Some of the staff here were friendly, others were rude. Also, the service was slow, even though we had four different servers for our table. It took forever for our orders to be taken, and the food took a while to come. Also, a lot of the servers were sending food to the wrong tables, there seemed to be a general confusion with most of them.  I tried a few things including the saikyo style baked scallops ($7.50) the scallops were meaty, fresh and they were drowned in a generous amount of cheese and delicious sauce. For the main I had the set course curry tiger shrimp dinner ($10.50) which included miso soup, salad, steamed rice, a bowl of thick slightly spicy curry (it was alright) and four pieces of breaded tiger shrimps which were okay- the breaded batter was too thick. For dessert I had the cr√®me caramel ($2.55) and it was a disappointment. The serving was small, way too sweet, and the whipped cream on top was gross and warm.  Overall, the food is okay, the service is slow, the servers are unorganized and the place can get loud and crowded. I'm not too impressed with Tako Sushi."}
{"text":"I went to Tako with my cousin for dinner last night and didn't exactly get the greatest service.  We both had to ask the servers several times about my missing edamame, which was supposed to come as an appetizer but ended up being my dessert. wtf. The miso soup was also super-salty. On a positive note, the sushi was fairly fresh. The sushi pizza and cucumber roll I ordered were both pretty good. Unfortunately, it was kinda chaotic in there on a Monday night! so much so that service was a bit slow and inefficient.  Not likely to go back there again unless I'm desperate."}
{"text":"This is my very first Yelp review, sadly it is not a very pleasant one. I went to Tako Sushi for lunch today, and there are 3 others people with me.   We quickly read over the menu and each person ordered their own combo/set.   The soup and salad starters came fairly quickly, but after that it was a waiting game.   Two of the orders came together and 5 minutes later we had mentioned that we are still waiting on the other two orders. Then it was another 10 minutes before the third order came to the table. We waited for about 5 minutes before flagging down a waiter and asking what is the deal on the final order.   No one bothered to come back and inform us what was going on, and for the next 15 minutes we had tried to flag down several people (including one of the managers) asking what was going on.   The manager's response was just unbelievable. His attitude was basically \"do you still want the order or not?\" And kept saying the kitchen lost the order and there is nothing he can do when I tried to confront him about the situation.  FINALLY the last order came to the table and the manager said this one is on the house.  Food was mediocre plus I was not really in the mood to enjoy it after what has happened.  When we got the check we noticed the manger has taken off the cheapest item on the bill as a comp instead of the actual item that was affected and when confronted he made it sound like we should be thankful he even considered giving us a discount. (We didn't ask for one! He was the one that said this is on the house when he brought the order over)  He finally agreed to make the correction and we left quickly. Rest assured I will not return to this place again."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner on May 5th 2013 a party of 6 plus baby. We made reservations for 6:30pm and was seated after 5-10mins. We were given a table that seated 8 people to occupy the baby which was roomy and allowed the parents to take care of the baby. The place was full.  I came to this restaurant numerous times and each time ate a different main course.   This time we all order our own food. I ordered the sushi dinner $15.50 (8 assorted sushi and 6 assorted rolls) also came with miso soup and salad.   Additionally I added a tempura shrimp and vegetable $4.70 as an appetizer for myself.   All our food arrived at different times and wasn't sure why my friend who ordered sashimi dinner was the last to receive her order. It's just raw fish it should be the FIRST dish to land on the table.  The service was okay. The waitress came by to check on us and the tea. The restaurant light was yellow to dim. The place was okay clean. The washrooms are  dirty/wet tiles and no hand paper towels available. The restaurant was large and at the far side of the restaurant had a few teppanyaki tables.  This place is run by Asian. The sushi satisfied my hunger and I was pleased with it. The sushi rice was nice and chewy warm. My fish was fresh. My tempuras was crispy and yummy. I haven't encounter a bad experience before. I had bento boxes and the seasonal lobster sashimi (which came in a combo) before.  I must mention that normally ice cream is served to people that order bentos. And we only had one bento at the table. Yet the waitress was nice and provided all of us an ice scoop. That was a plus. Yes not Japanese till I end it with a scoop of green tea ice cream :)  I would come here again and again."}
{"text":"Huge place, has a buffet and ala cart; but never packed?? The rolls look fresh and service is ok.  Last time we visited was a few months back and we saw some of the kitchen staff napping in the closed off sections of the restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is close to home, and the food is passable and cheap. There's not much more to say that other reviewers haven't already stated.  The quality of the food is mediocre but passable, the service is awful but if you're lucky you'll get a teppanyaki chef that will put on a good show for your group.  I've had lunch delivered to me at home a few times and also to my old workplace in Scarborough. It takes forever and a day, and it is so NOT eco-friendly since a simple bento lunch will come with 5+ plastic/ styrofoam containers."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great prices, good service ... arranged a group of 12 people, and they were very accommodating.   They split some portions so that we can share, they were very helpful in suggesting items that we may want to try, and no one had a bad thing to say about the food.   If you are at a teppanyaki table, it's great, and watching the chefs prepare the food is fun.  The rest of the resto could use a little updating.   Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Meh, not that great. Had better, service is alright though, quality is good but portion is small. A LOT more rice than fish"}
{"text":"I don't know how long this place has occupied their space, but from the decor, I have a feeling that this place used to be something else. A buffet maybe. This ain't Los Angeles, why would anyone dedicate a giant floor space to sushi with so much competition?  I feel like I'm gonna get mugged every time I enter the parking lot. It's far in the back, with poor lighting, and uneven pavement.  Once inside, you'll quickly realize this doesn't look much like the other Japanese restaurants. The seating are arranged in way which resembles more of a Western venue, than an Eastern eatery. A good portion of the place is occupied by useless decor, like giant wall mounted sushi boats, and fake plants. There is a section where the chef cooks and flips the food in front of you at a threatening distance..what's that called again?  The menu is extensive. I spent fifteen minutes reading through it, and still had trouble deciding on what to order. We ended up getting the \"Love Boat.\" Considering it was three guys, I felt a bit awkward.  When the ship arrived, there wasn't as much love that was aboard as we'd hoped. Especially with the price we're paying. I wasn't comfortable here, it feels like I should have been eating something else, like, barbecue duck or something. I think I smell an air of pretentiousness here. Definitely not your regular sushi experience. At least one can fall back on the fact that all the staff here were Chinese. At least something made sense.....  The food was average. The service was alright. The environment was ineffective. The crowd were all into their late forties. This place really should be turned into an Mandarin or something.  What does Tako even mean?"}
{"text":"I've come a couple of times.. Solid sushi.. Always seating for small and big groups  The service is good not long wait.. As for the food I never go home disappointed .. Try the salmon or tuna Tataki And they have really good speciality rolls The only thing I can complain about is the alcohol choices..besides fancy girl drinks the beer selection is not too good The sushi is on par with any place I've tried I would consider this place average to above average .."}
{"text":"This place used to be pretty good, but they have gone downhill in the last year or so.  The service has always been iffy, but it was really terrible today.  It took forever to get our food and some of our party had almost finished their meal before others even got their food!  My tempura was cold when it arrived as was my steak.  One of the sushi rolls was very dry looking on the outside, like it has sat out for hours.   It took an act of God to get a refill on our green tea too.  I doubt I will be back again, but if I did I would only go to the teppanyaki tables since they couldn't screw up getting everyone's food out at the same time there."}
{"text":"wow so much hate for this place! upon trying the tasting menu, I give it a solid 3.5 stars.  I rarely consider hitting up a Japanese restaurant for lunch but the tasting menu here is quite reasonably priced. Some memorable dishes for me:  - the blanched SPINACH SALAD starter - super palate cleansing - SASHIMI NIGIRI - didn't check/couldn't figure out what fish these were, but so buttery fresh. rice was very appropriately sized to the fish portion - SASHIMI LETTUCE ROLLS - seeing shredded lettuce wrapped within my sashimi felt weird to me, but it did help pick up some extra of the ponzu-type dressing so that it was adequately saucy - BAKED OYSTER - diced and baked with a cream sauce, topped with cheese and baked in the giant shell. Too rich for my liking and I was slightly disappointed that the oyster didn't come whole. Then again, judging by the size of the shell, this would have been a massive oyster to see whole.. - RAMEN - the broth was like MILK it was soo richly stewed. this came, perhaps thankfully, towards the end and I could barely finish it all. - TUNA STEAK - lightly seared. somehow underwhelming, but still like buttahhh - MANGO PANNA COTTA - considering how full I was, I somehow still managed to dummy this in no time. The mango syrup definitely helped cut through the creaminess of the panna cotta. nice ending.  Service wasn't lacking at all, even though the restaurant was plenty busy at noon on a Saturday. Contrary to the other reviews, the quality of the sashimi here tako'd me by surprise. Overall a rather comforting meal."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times for lunch and have never been impressed. Their combo specials are good and very attractively priced. The service has a lot to be desired and the food is okay. I haven't necessarily explored their sushi options and am not too excited to try it either. The few pieces you get with your combo are always inconsistently. If you want a cheap meal and are in the area, step in, otherwise..."}
{"text":"Frequented by locals, this restaurant's business appears unaffected by its sub par Yelp reviews. You would definitely not come here if you were looking for the best Japanese food in Toronto, but if you want good Japanese food at a great price, this is the place for you. Customer service is adequate and the ambiance is inviting for large groups."}
{"text":"Tako Sushi is actually really good, food wise.  I've been a regular here a lot, with a few friends, always enjoy a nice meal here. A large selection of food on the menu, many things to try.  First off here are some items I have tried and liked: LIVE Lobster Sashimi - fresh and delicious, not many restaurants carry this Giant Lobster Teppanyaki  Chilled Egg Custard with Seafood Chicken Karaga Uni Seafood Fried Rice - unique, great to have uni and seafood fried rice! Saikyo Style Baked Scallop Pan Fried Mixed Mushroom  Food is overall pretty good, sushi and sashimi wise, nothing too special but for what you get and the price is pretty good.  Its a nice place to have a nice filling complete meal.  I gotta note, the service is pretty so-so, or annoying or bad sometimes. The servers aren't very attentive or dare i say, sloppy at taking orders or just dumping dishes on your tables with a lack of mannerism.  Other than that though, it is still a good place to eat."}
{"text":"Two gourmet sets + Lobster sashimi/teppanyaki for $10 is the best choice for two dining there - if you are in this restaurant and order rolls, especially common stuff like California rolls, then I'd say it's not their fault that you have to give them 1-2 stars...  I love everything in their gourmet menu, especially the lobster sashimi & foie gras. A meal with these two items + all the other nice stuff will cost you approximately $32 after tax - what to complain?  In fact it is good enough for two meals - I always go there for late lunch and pack the rice with the eel for dinner. I am tempted to order other stuff on the menu but in the end I'd always choose gourmet set - it is simply the best value."}
{"text":"What's up with all the hatin'?   Granted, I've never experienced the horrific food or service that everyone else seems to agree on. I've never really noticed it, actually -- whenever I'm here, I'm too busy reminiscing on old times and cracking a joke or two with old friends.   The food isn't anything godawful. I always order their unagi lunch combo if I'm feeling fishy, or the chicken teriyaki ($6!!). Maybe it's because I frequent much sketchier Chinese joints often, but I've never had found anything to complain about with the service. I mean, just give me my food and my water refills and I'm sated.  There was this one memorable time at good ol' Tako that brings this from a three-star to a four-. I was in a party of 14 or 15 people: high school aged students, no less. We decided to go teppenyaki, sitting at a square table with a grill in the middle and a great view of the food being prepared. The chef was certainly Japanese, dressed in hat and all. He grilled, fried, and sauteed right there in front of us, teasing us and cracking jokes as he served us course after course. Great way of getting rid of post-exam stress; probably the best meal I've had yet, out with friends. Best part? the sub-$15 price."}
{"text":"I go here all the time. I love their \"Kyoto\" deal which comes with maki (3 california rolls, 3 cucumber rolls), chicken teriyaki, salad, rice, miso soup, 2 spring rolls, steamed vegetables, and desert. Most of the time they get the correct order, but usually it's a fairly slow service where most waiters speak little English.  One time they did forget my order, while the two people I was with already received theirs. I complained multiple times, but they didn't even bother to come back. I simply shared my meal with the people I was there with. It's enough since the meals are very large. I didn't bother leaving a tip that time, even though the waitress thought I should have. I decided that from then on, I would only do take out. So that usually works for me. The food is cheap, but the service lacks a lot."}
{"text":"It's one thing to have bad service, but it's another when you have to ask 10 times for the servers to bring you the food that you ordered.  Even though the food isn't bad, the mannerism of the servers and the chaos is very off-putting.  Also I think asian parents should learn that other people do not like having kids screaming all over the restaurant and walking into other peoples' booths.  It is not appropriate behaviour.  I would never come here again."}
{"text":"I thought this place would be different from its new Mississauga location, which I have been to, and was not impressed with the service.  Unfortunately, it's a bit better, but I was still disappointed.   Although the place is packed, when we got there at 7pm, we had a 15 min wait.  I did call around 5pm and she told me \"we are really busy, we don't a take reservations\". When we got there, there were many tables open, and she told us they were Reserved.  So apparently they DO take reservations, just not an hour before you show up. Honestly, I think they are making it up.   The prices are good, it's the downtown Annex/Yonge street prices, but an uptown location, but I think still on the pricier side. $19.95 for a half lobster, appetizers and a main with salad, soup etc. $16.50 for a bento box with 2 mains (short ribs + a teriyaki fish/beef/chicken)  The quality of food, is okay. Nothing terribly special. Except my dessert, the creme caramel had whipped cream and a maraschino cherry cherry on it, with a plastic spoon.Gross.   More importantly, the service. They are quite rude. When the server came to get our drinks, we asked for a few minutes before ordering, He says \"okay cool\", and threw the drink menu in a pile near a computer. The only people that are professional at serving at the folks in suits.   I don't know why people like this place so much. It's busy and noisy, and rude. You'd be better off going to somewhere like Sapporo Sushi (at Yonge and finch), Ichiban (on spring garden and yonge) or any of the like.  Even Memories of Japan next door!"}
{"text":"My family  went to Tako Sushi this past Saturday to celebrate my father's birthday. We decided to try the Teppanyaki Feast ($98.50 for four)  The meal consisted of:  1. Live Clam in Mix Mushroom Miso Soup. Average. 2. Marinated Shark Fin and Jellyfish Salad. Average. 3.Tuna & Salmon Tataki Rolls in Yuzu Sauce. Interesting but the lettuce stuffing was odd. 4. Sushi & Salmon Boat (32 pieces). Fresh but the sushi was poorly executed. 5. Scallop on Shell with Sake Sauce. Nicely done. 6. Shrimp & Chicken Stuffed Mushroom. Average. 7. Live Lobster (1.5 lbs). Highlight of the meal. Fresh and tasty. 8. Strip Loin Steak (AAA). Average, it reminded me of garlic cube steak you would get at an AYCE Japanese buffet. 9. Beef Fried Rice. A little on the bland side. 10. Ice cream  The food in general was average where something things were good and somethings were just average but reasonably priced for what you are getting. Keep in mind that the place is your typical Chinese owned Japanese restaurant and I find that a lot of Chinese owned Japanese restaurants serve mediocre food but are very reasonably priced and focus more on giving customers value for their money than a place like Zen or Aoyama who serve a lot better quality but are at a higher price point.  In terms of service, the service was mediocre. They weren't bad nor did they go out of their way to go the extra mile to make service excellent. Everytime we had a request, the request was completed in a reasonable time without any attitude.   The only disappointing thing was the teppanyaki chef, normally when you have a teppanyaki lunch/dinner the chef usually puts on a small show to entertain the guests but our chef made it seem like it was a chore for him and didn't seem like he had much experience in entertaining guests."}
{"text":"Pretty good. My experience with tako sushi was not as bad as others but I will agree that the waiters are not the best. However the managers were better at serving and the food was overall pretty good"}
{"text":"More like 1.25 *Stars* and that's because they apparently have Wagyu Beef that was still being flown in.  We didn't go for Teppanyaki this round.  As far as the setting and cleaniness is concern, Tako does a good job. I can't EAT atmosphere and cleaniness though.  Disappointed from no Wagyu, I'll go for Lobster where we got Sashimi Lobster($17.95), Sapporo Teppan Lobster($18.95), Grilled Lamb Chops($2.50/chop), Tuna Tataki($8.95), Uni Fried Rice($9.95), and Jumbo Teppan Oyster($2.49/each).  The service was COLD and rude as the waiter just barges in to drop our food off without a smile or a word.  Grabs empties without any excuse me and does it in-your-face method.  One of the suited manager put our Lobster down then picked it back up to turn around, then turns back to us and puts it down.  No eye contact, no questions, no SHIT.  Lobster Sashimi was A-OK but the portion is not worth the value.  Same can be said for the Sapporo Teppan Lobster which was hard to locate the meat as it was mostly shell and it wasn't even crushed or leave us with a Lobster Clamp.  Tuna Tataki wasn't that appealing and it was a bit on the TOUGH side.  The Lamb Chops were ordered Medium Rare and came on the Medium side however it's fine, not sure how it's a Japanese item though.  Uni Fried Rice didn't have much Uni to observe or taste and we didn't even get offered Bowls and Spoons to eat it with until we asked.  The Fried Rice on it's own was fine but if advertised Uni and you had a photo on the menu, at least make an attempt to replicate it somewhat.  The LONE highlight was the Jumbo Teppan Oyster which was yummy and reasonably cost.  Even the Ice Cream took forever to come and then the server slams my friends empty bowl on top of mine and leaves without a word.  I don't UNDERSTAND why there was a packed house here during dinner time especially with 95% Asian.  Is there a new trend towards expensive crappy food with bad service?  EPIC Fail!"}
{"text":"Sounds like my experience was not out of the ordinary.  The food was passable, nothing special, and the service was friendly but terrible.  The salmon sashimi never came, although it showed up on our bill (we pointed it out after we had paid and they credited it back).  The spicy scallop sushi had way too much mayonnaise, the dragon roll and Alaskan roll were both okay not great, and the uni was good.  The beer we ordered never came, and neither did a pair of chopsticks (even though they placed a napkin and placemat down).    We ordered a tonkatsu don which was fine.  Overall it cost $40 before tip, so at least it wasn't super expensive."}
{"text":"Tako Sushi, at first when I heard about the place I thought it was Mexican/Asian/fusion that served sushi and tacos LOL but then when I saw the name of the restaurant, realized it was just Japanese.  Service was slow, it's a pretty large venue, lots of lighting and red/gold decor. Open concept kitchen when you walk in and tables are on the right side. We never really had one specific server, it was more of whoever walked by our seats.   We got there around 7-8pm, so dinner menu. My friend got chicken teriyaki bento box and I got the vegetarian one. Both boxes come with green salad, miso soup and single serving of ice cream. Soup serving was pretty large in comparison to other restaurants that I have been too. Her box had 3-4 pieces of chicken teriyaki, macaroni, steamed broccoli, plain white rice, 4 mini pieces of california roll and few pieces of vegetable tempura. My vegetarian box had pretty much the same thing with the plain rice, steamed veggies, vegetable tempura, 3 mini pieces of cucumber roll and deep fried tofu( forgot the actual name of whats its called) Dessert, since the box came with free ice cream, our choices were vanilla, mint chocolate and mango. We both got mango because we love tropical fruit. The portions were large, really filling and we didnt even finish half of our boxes.  Also the restaurant comes along with a section where you can sit in a private room and have 1-2 personal chefs cooking in front of you (called Tepanyaki) Next time we go, we will definitely try it out. The aroma from that room was so nice, made us even more hungry haha"}
{"text":"Not  professional : Waiters sleeping at tables ... Waitress was cleaning her nails while waiting ... (So Gross BTW !!)  Food portions were quite large but quality of food on the low scale"}

We ordered Sashimi and Sushi Love Boat, Live Lobster Sashimi and a Tasting Menu for 1, so we could try a variety of different items....  Sashimi cut was quite thick (FAIL!) Sushi Rolls (ROLLED POORLY - FAIL!)  Oyster from Tasting Menu (Not Hot upon arrival - FAIL) Ordered Medium Rare (CAME OUT MEDIUM - FAIL!)  The only item that was good is the live lobster sashimi....but than again where else can I find a place to compare that? hmm...  kept on waving my hand until it got tired to ask for some soya sauce...a few ppl saw me but didn't come to our table...(WTF?!!!) I saw a waiter cleaning the table and asked for soya sauce...I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT...HE JUS GOES LIKE \"HERE\"..and passed me the soya sauce....didn't even apologize and go like I will bring it right over...(FAIL!!)  We were given a small table but we ordered quite a bit of food. No one initialized to pick up dirty plates...We had to leave it to the next table and walk it over to the waiter that was cleaning other tables...SERIOUSLY??? It's like a food court...SELF-SERVE! (FAIL)  Once the lobster sashimi came to our table, we were not fully finished with the plate...they wanted to pick it up?!???! During the whole night, there was no initiative to pick up dirty plates because it was lobster sashimi, they wanted to pick it up???  EPIC FAIL!"}

{"text":"DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE!!! They are just unsanitary.  We found a tissue paper in the rice.  I ordered take out and there was a bug in our salad.   I would not eat raw food from a place this bad.  They should be shut down by health inspectors.  Cheap does not mean good!  These are chinese people trying to do sushi.  STAY AWAY if you don't want to end up in a hospital."}
{"text":"Don't know what's up with all the bad reviews. This restaurant has a modern interior and a huge venue. The food is very good and the prices are even better. Chicken don is something like $8.50? What's not to like? Sure it might not be GOUMET but it's definitely a good quality meal. They also have some very interesting teppanaki bars with chefs and the whole works but I have yet to try that. Stop in and see for yourself if your in the area!"}
{"text":"I come here with friends on occasion, but there are WAY better sushi restaurants out there. You can go to an AYCE place and get better quality! Not only that, but when I tell people \"Tako Sushi\", they ask if it's a Mexican sushi place. I always have to spell the name out. xD  Wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"Take-out lunch specials are decent, although they've gone up in price over the years by probably 30%. Was there last night, the service was atrocious and I didn't even get the second half of my meal. But that's all a moot point because...  EFFECTIVE MONDAY FEBRUARY 24th, TAKO SUSHI IS CLOSED INDEFINITELY. THE RESTAURANT HAS NEW OWNERSHIP, NO WORD ON WHEN THEY WILL RE-OPEN."}
{"text":"I'm surprised by all the bad reviews as I came here for lunch today after seeing the parking lot full. This is usually my telltale sign of a decent restaurant. Menu is very reasonably priced and you usual Japanese offerings. I had the Take bento. It came with,miso soup, salad, 3 pcs California roll, 3 pcs Salmon roll, chicken Tempura, nice crunchy broccoli, mixed tempura rice and a small pasta dish. Enough food for a king, but for 12.95! The workers in the restaurant took to the same attention to service like worker bees in a hive! When a table was vacated, before you could blink it was ready for the next people! A definite place to return to!"}
{"text":"It used to be somewhat OK , but now it's just the worst place to eat !!!!  The food is sooo bad ! I could not even finish half of my teriyaki chicken it tasted just awful !! It it was chicken  And not dog meet ??!!!  I hope that the owner will one day realize if the menu prices are somewhat low it doesn't mean to serve people garbage !!  Hope they would charge 5-10 $ more but serve  somewhat eatable food !!  I'm just hoping not to get sick after eating that chicken / dog meet !!  It smelled and tasted awful !  Oh by the way the sushi was probable from 2 days ago , and just kept in the fridge ..  Good luck if you decide to eat there !"}
{"text":"I usually go to the Sushi Delight location on the Danforth, but have been here twice.  It is owned by the same chain as the Sushi Delight location and they have the same menu basic menu but they have a lot of different dishes that the Danforth location does not have too.  My boyfriend and I went here and I felt that we got this great deal on a shared meal that included:  - a medium sized lobster cooked or as sashimi - tempura - rice x2 - lamb rack - salmon filet - mussel soup x 2 - salad x2  This entire meal would've been around $60 altogether, which I think is a great deal!  But we also ordered some extra butter fish on the side that day too.  Service was good, not exceptional, but adequate.  I don't know about their teppanyaki but I would come back for this deal alone."}
{"text":"My mom, who lived in Japan for a number of years, is pretty darn picking about any Japanese food she eats.  We usually settle for the mediocre-yet-satisfying Canuck version of Japanese food around Scarborough and North York.  She'd been to Tako before and had advised me to not to waste my time here.  I was still curious by the large number of clientel this place drew and came only to discover firsthand possibly the worst tempura and maki I've ever had in Toronto.   Our food was also served with a side of Appalling Service.  The young male waiters would chatter between Mandarin and Cantonese and seem to have no sense of what good service means; don't expect thank you's or any polite nods. Considering we can understand everything that was said, it was no different than standing around Pacific Mall eavesdropping on teenage gossip.    Tako still gets a passing grade as the food is mildly bearable.  It seems that the menu is geared towards impressing the Chinese palette for fresh seafood (i.e. lobster, crab), which - as a herbivore - I can't say too much about.    You'll find yourself here if you're a mindless Asian church groupie, but not if you're a foodie."}
{"text":"Worst service ever.   My fiance's family and I came here for my fiance's birthday celebration.   3 of our members wanted to get the holiday dinner special where you get half of a lobster with 5 other dishes. When we tried to place our order, they told us we have to order an even number of specials cuz they can't give us just half of a lobster. The waitress was really impatient in explaining to us and we wished that it was stated on the menu itself. Ultimately we ordered 4 sets of dinner specials and 1 sashimi dinner on the side to share.   Food came out pretty quickly initially.. but towards the end of my our meal.. they made a mistake and forgot to place our udon order. We waited a good half hour for them to check and finally serve it to us when we were ready for our dessert. And the dessert took them another hr.. really did they need to make the ice cream from scratch and turn it or something. The whole dining experience took over 2 hrs.   Thank goodness for good company.. flagging down our waitress was a pain.. and waiting for the food.. was just.. awful.    Aside from convenience since it's so close to where my fiance lives.. we would never dine here again."}
{"text":"Always my go to for sushi and Japanese take out. Friendly and fast service. Rolls are tasty and fresh. Sashimi is cut a bit too thick though. Will return."}
{"text":"Mediocore food and terrible service. The servers took forever to come around to take our order, and only refilled our tea once after waiting half an hour. the person who seemed to be the owner tried clearing the plates off our table, but my friend wasn't even finished her food! He brought the bill as we were finishing dessert...way too soon and we both felt rushed. His actions would have made sense if it was busy and there were people waiting for a table, but this was not the case. There are many sushi restaurants in the area that are much better and will not rush you out.  Oh yes, I should also mention that there is VERY limited parking here, just make sure you read the signs."}
{"text":"We've been to Tako Sushi a few times in the past few years. Their parking lot in front is a bit tight but there are plenty of spots around the back. Most recently we were there on a Wednesday night for dinner. The place is a little bit in need of an update; the decor is not bad or worn out, but the patterned carpet just makes it feel dated. Their teppanyaki is usually entertaining, but on Wednesday we opted for a regular table. Our server was very polite and intuitive, knowing which dishes we wanted to share and when to take away our empty plates. We ordered a spicy seafood soup (very spicy), fried calamari, sweet potato tempura, sushi & sashimi dinner combo, and a green dragon roll which all together cost $48, so not bad. The food quality was very good and we were satisfied with our meal."}
{"text":"We have attended a couple of times and always enjoyed the food and the atmosphere which made the experience last night all the more disconcerting. We had a server who not only forgot to check on us after serving our appetizers and main courses but forgot the main course for one of our party. If she had come back to check on us she would have discovered we were missing an entree. This was bad enough but then to be unconcerned about the oversight made the experience unpleasant. There were no apologies or attempts to mitigate the forgotten dinner making us feel awkward. It sad when staff don't care about the quality of their service and it reflects badly on the restaurant."}
{"text":"Your chinese-run japanese restaurant.  I like their sushi & sashimi diamond combinations. The price and quantity is good for sharing and tastes not too bad~~"}
{"text":"Came here for a work lunch one day. When we walked in, there was a strong chlorine smell, but we think it was their aquarium (for display).  They have a large variety of lunch combos that are reasonably priced. However, the quality of the food is not that good. I got Kyoto sushi combo, which includes miso soup, a salad, and twelve rolls. The salad was over-dressed to the extent that there was a pool of dressing at the bottom of the bowl. The rolls were also not very good, particularly the California roll, which consisted of mostly cucumber more than anything else. The rolls fell apart easily when I pick it up.  I finished the meal with a scoop of green tea ice cream, and that was pretty good. At least they don't cheap out by buying cheap green tea ice cream!  If you don't mind mediocre Japanese food, Tako is a good choice for its decent price."}
{"text":"My family and i love going to Tako Sushi, we go there once a week."}
{"text":"They don't even deserve a star but unfortunately I have to give one.  Server got our order of sushi wrong, brought two plates of Green Dragon rolls we corrected him and said we ordered one of that and one Spider Roll. He walked away. Our main dishes arrived - very mediocre teriyaki beef (no flavour, watery!) - but still no spider roll. Asked the server to check, he says ok. Doesn't come back. I go and find him and ask him to check again, he says ok. Then I see him HIDING IN THE BACK! I finally go to the  manager and ask him what's happening. He says they forgot and walked away from me. Managed to get our bill eventually and the manager comped the dragon roll (after much fight).   What kind of f******g business is this!!!!  Never coming back here again.  Do NOT support this lousy business. Their food and service sucks."}
{"text":"Tako Sushi is one of the best restaurants in the city.  It just so happens that their specialty is sushi.  Well, it's actually only one of their specialties. Looks can be deceiving from the outside as it is located in the side of an old office building in North York.  However, once you get inside, it is a really really nice place.   The food is fantastic, the portions are ridiculous and the prices are out of this world. A meal for about $15.00 will include a platter so salmon sushi and California rolls, salad, miso soup, tempura, teriyaki steak, grilled pork and the list goes on.  That is just one choice of only one meal...  And the quality rivals the most notorious sushi restaurants in the downtown core.   Depending on what you order, they usually include some interesting ice cream at the end with mango, red bean and green tea as your choices. This place is definitely a gem. http://www.takosushi.ca/"}
{"text":"Sushi is ok...most of the items were pretty bland and uninteresting.  Go here if you are DYING for sushi while passing through the area or if you are stuck at work in this MFN area."}
