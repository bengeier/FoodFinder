{"text":"This review is a little tardy as the only time I've been there was a few weeks after it first opened, but it doesn't make it any less true.  We went there on a Tuesday night and were greeted by three hostesses. We were sat promptly but that was the last interaction we had with a staff member that night. We waited at least ten minutes for someone to come over and just GREET us. Multiple servers/hosts walked by our table without even glancing at it. The place was far from busy but we still didn't even get water by the time we decided enough was enough.  We walked out as the hostesses wished us a pleasant evening, and we haven't been back since."}

{"text":"I finally went to Gia Lai after driving past it every day to go to my gym after a killer leg workout. Anyway, I was at first happy with the interior. I was a little suprised though that we were one of only 3 couple in the place at dinner time on a thursday. Anyway, the menu was exciting enough and I decided to get the Pad Thai. I asked for it to be spiced up. Our service was quick and friendly but my Pad Thai was not much to mention. Not bad tasting, but not nearly what I expect. Good portions of mediocre food. Maybe too americanized?"}
{"text":"Food was served quickly and service was energetic and charismatic. Overall great experience."}
{"text":"The food and ambience  here at Gia Lai is great except for our server. His name is Jason but goes by \"Jay\". Everyone at the table was served their food but me. It took Jay 5 or mins to realized messed up and forgot to put my order in.  Our table heard him say \"sh*t\" as he rushed back to the computer to type it in. It took him 5 mins to come back to the table to apologize which was half hearted. He barely owned up to his mistake nor try to mend his error. The restaurant was not crowded nor was he the only server there. The cook served the food and apologized multiple times whole heartedly. Good food, poor server."}
{"text":"The pho is delicious. Also like the wontons and Vietnamese wings. Great restaurant."}
{"text":"Great food. Love the potstickers. Glass noodles are awesome. My wife loves the veggie pad Thai."}
{"text":"No good. Clean but weird decor. Menu is all over the place - identity crisis!  Nothing that the 5 of us ordered was tasty or fresh. The manager was really trying, he's great."}
{"text":"Deserves better than its star ranking. Good people, better food. Consistently delicious and much more than what you would expect from a place in Legacy Village. Music is odd for the type if restaurant - Sirrus 70s channel, but I kind of dig it ;)"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times - it's great! Their tofu with black bean sauce is fantastic. I've had it twice - it tasted a little different the second time around, but it was still top notch!   This is looking like my new go-to for Vietnamese. A true Cleveland gem."}
{"text":"I can't believe this categorize as a Vietnamese restaurant.  I just can't compare this to Superior Pho or BAC, no way these people are giving more than a two stars review.  Me and my wife were there on a saturday afternoon for lunch, and the place is pretty dead.  We were skeptical going in there at first, but we wanted to give it a try.  Anyway, after we sat down for a while review the menu without any service, then we have ordered a spring roll, pho, grill pork chop, and a  vietnamese iced coffee.  First, the spring roll came out as a summer roll,  the pho is not authentic, grill pork chop thin like a paper, and both the pho & the pork chop portion were very small (kids size).  And my hugh disappointment was the Vietnamese iced coffee, it was only half full in a glass, a lot of ice, looked like the drink was sharing with someone else in the restaurant.  From now on, i will just stick with BAC in Tremont where is my favorite Vietnamese restaurant in Cleveland so far."}
{"text":"I'm a bit surprised at some of the lackluster reviews for Gai Lai.  I've been here about 5 times or so during the past 3 months, and each time I've been plenty satisfied with the food, the prices, and the service.  I've noticed that the prices are higher for the dinner and weekend menu compared to the lunch menu, while the portions seem to be the same.  Yes, I've eaten at Superior Pho and No. 1 Pho, as well a few other Asian/Thai/Vietnamese places around town. Am I an expert? No. But I know what I like.  I will say I haven't tried the Pho here yet, but I have tried the Pad Thai, a couple of the rice dishes, the Banh Mi sandwich, the Tom Yum soup, and the spring rolls. The Pad Thai portions are huge, the last time I counted 15 large shrimp on my plate, along with about a dozen chunks of chicken. Needless to say, half my portion went home with me for dinner.   The lunch portion is $11.95, which I think is a fair price considering the size. The Tom Yum (hot and sour soup) was hot, spicy, and delicious each and every time I've ordered it, and the cup portion actually comes in a bowl, and the bowl portions are served in the huge bowls used for Pho.    The Banh Mi sandwich was good, not spectacular, and not unlike the one I've had at Superior Pho, or even the $3 one at the to-go counter at Park 2 Shop.  Finally, is this authentic food? I don't know, I've never been to Vietnam, Thailand, or anywhere in Asia, so I can't really say with certainty as have other reviewers, but I think it's good food, and a good value."}
{"text":"Wow Wow Wow!!!  I love this place. This restaurant will put all other Vietnamese restaurants to shame and raised the standard of all Asian cuisines.   Everything is well put together; food, service, decor, and pricing.  My wife and I  had dinner here Friday night, both of us love Pho, but we decided to get different dishes to share. She had the Pho Ga (Chicken Noodle Soup) while I had the Com Bo Nuong (Rice with Short Ribs). Both dishes were spectacular. The restaurant was packed and yet our food and service were not compromised.   Highly recommended and definitely will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Not bad, not great, Gia Lai is a confounding realm of a beautifully designed interior that makes you think that the food should taste a lot better for the price.  The service is always good, and it's been my experience that there's rarely a wait, but really you'd be better off with takeout."}
{"text":"The ambience is nice and the service is good. The calamari appetizer was the worst I have ever had and the pho was inedible due to the ridiculous amount of black pepper taste. I have never written a bad review in my life and this is the first meal I had to literally leave on the table. I stopped by Chipotle right after leaving the restaurant on the way home. It is no wonder that I was the only one in the entire restaurant. Maybe the other dishes are good but I won't be back to find out."}
{"text":"The reason why I believe this place will not last another year is certainly not due to the quality of their food. Their food is good. Everything else is a complete and utter disaster. They have screwed up my take-out order too many times and their manager is super rude, disrespectful and has no place being a manager for any food establishment. I stopped patronizing them for a little while after their breast-feeding incident (check the Internet). Unfortunately I started going back and I sincerely regret it. I would not recommend this horrible place to anyone even if their food was the best on earth."}
{"text":"Food and atmosphere was good! Service was fantastic! Very attentive staff and management!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised.  Yes this is ridiculously overpriced for pho but you're paying for the decor, the chandeliers, water fountain wall, etc...  After trying out Bowl of Pho, I had VERY low expectations for Asian food in Beachwood but I found that the pho was actually decent.  The broth had authentic flavor, the noodles were cooked fine, the cuts of meat and meatballs had a different texture but they tasted ok.  I'm only ok shelling out $14 for pho when I need a noodle fix and don't have time to drive to Asiatown. They really do need to give more than 3 pieces of basil & mint though.  Their gyoza were really good and fried ice cream was ok, a little too doughy though."}
{"text":"Gia Lai is an interesting setting. They have a good menu for asian fusion kind of food. I just walked in to it because I was at Legacy Village and wanted to eat one sunday afternoon and needed something to eat.   They have a nice interior with a very calming water wall fountain thing in the back. The bar looked good from the distance. But it is not fitting for any particular type. Bar looks like a sports grill but the fountain is like one of the asian zen meditation like feeling. Anyways there is enough space in the restaurant and I am sure they are never crowded.   Food was okay. I mean their spicy tofu with black bean sauce was not the best I ever had and not the worst for sure. It was actually okay! I would not go there again or take someone to experience this place.   If you are looking for an asian fusion restaurant to spend some quite time in the mall and grab a bite! This is not a bad place."}
{"text":"How can this place get good reviews for Vietnamese food? There is no way these people can compare this food to Superior or Minh Anh or Tay Do. It is worlds apart. The pho is average at best, they do not have a quality pork dish, the short ribs are the fattiest thing I have ever tasted. The summer rolls are stuffed with lettuce and have little basil and no vermicelli. I really really wanted this to be good because it is a much more convenient location and it would be really nice to have a good Vietnamese place with an atmosphere that you would actually want to have a nice meal out at. Alas, it is all atmosphere (awesome atmosphere) but the Vietnamese food is really lacking.  I will go back and try it one more time to check out some other things on the menu but if it is anything like my first experience it will be my last experience at the beautiful Gia Lai."}
{"text":"not sure where all the complaints about price and portion are coming from, because i got enough pho for two people, and the fried rice comes in at about the same portions. whoever mentioned a $10 appetizer is literally lying about the price. so as always when people complain about the price of things, CHECK THE ACTUAL MENU BEFORE LISTENING TO THEM.  the only thing on the menu above $15 are some of the non-pho specials which are priced comparably to a place like PF Chang's. most of the pho is priced at like 11 dollars which is decent, especially for how much you get.  the pho broth is actually pretty good, even compared to Superior Pho (i actually prefer Gia Lai's broth) however, the meat was pretty bad  the fried rice was nice and hearty, but not very well seasoned.  a step or a half above most Legacy Village place, and i'd rather see bored housewives spend their money here than at Bar Louie or the Cheesecake Factory."}
{"text":"The place is well decorated and looks really nice.  Bar set-up is extensive and there are lots of TV's (sports bar flavor?) which is odd for an Asian place.  Lots of non-asian staff which I always find strange and non-authentic.  I eat a lot of good Vietnamese downtown at Saigon, Superior Pho and #1 Pho.  There is no comparison.  Spicy Beef Noodle Pho was not all spicy, Short Ribs were fatty and bland, kids pho was bland as well.  On the plus side, service was excellent although somewhat unknowledgeable about the offerings.  The place certainly has promise but they will need to strengthen their kitchen first.  Give it time and try again."}
{"text":"From a convenience standpoint, there are very few places that serve pho around the east side. Problem is, if you what authentic pho, this might not be the best place. There are several good spots downtown that are much better. The key is the broth and its a bit light on flavor and heavy on cinnamon. Most place provide hoisin sauce and siracha along with sprouts. They have it but it's very small in terms of portion compared to other locations.  Price is also high compared to other locations downtown but given the fact that it's in Legacy, they almost are forced to charge more.  Overall, it's decent. Not great... Will I go there again? If I don't have time to drive downtown, yes."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews I was very skeptical about coming here. I thought the food was actually pretty good. Some of the Beef dishes were yummy, the Gai Coun good and the Pho was good but nothing was excellent. Would I go back probably not and with that overhead they won't be there long anyways."}
{"text":"Ok. So an update from my last review. The food is still awful. Please save yourself the time and money and go to Superior Pho. You won't regret it. HOWEVER, if you want some cheap, strong drinks, skip the food and head over to the bar. It's the only thing from making me want to burn the place down."}
{"text":"It felt very underwhelming.  I had the lemongrass chicken and rice, which didn't do anything for me at all.  It was like something I'd cook for myself after getting pumped up while browsing allrecipe.com, only to remember that I am not a good cook.  One extra star for attentive and quick service.  I seem to have bad luck with the east side...any suggestions?"}
{"text":"Visited last night for dinner, I know nothing about Vietnamese food, so I went with a safe option, the chicken fried rice.  The quality of the chicken was great, portion size was CRAZY big, I will probably get 3 more meals out of it!    My dining companion had a chicken lettuce wrap, was seasoned well and the appetizer size was also large, she will get at least another meal out of it.  The table next to us we're served a couple of HUGE bowls...I think those were the Pho dishes, sort of a soup.  Our server was very good, answered our questions and we felt taken care of.   The restaurant is put together well, has interesting light panels at the bar and in part of the ceiling that have changing colors.  The dining crowd last night filled about 1/3 of the space, but the noise level seemed a high, probably because the floors are a type of stone, and the muzak could be turned down a notch or two.  Other than that, I will go back to explore other parts of the menu."}
{"text":"The place was dead but the service was excellent, therein lies the problem.  It was so dead the server was bored, so he kept coming to the table every 3 minutes and interrupting us making it difficult to hold a decent conversation.  When we initially walked in, there wasn't an Asian person in sight, so we were hesitant whether or not there were Asian cooks in the kitchen, we wanted authentic Vietnamese cuisine, and our server assured us that there were. When we received our food, it was evident that the food was completely \"bootleg\".  The portion sizes were good, but that did not make up for the complete lack of taste and blandness or the fact that my noodle soup was missing half of the ingredients.   Next time I'll head back down to Lorain Ave. for some REAL Vietnamese."}
{"text":"Very mediocre... First of all, place looks too fancy for a pho restaurant, decorated as an upscale Chinese restaurant with a modern bar (a little confusing). I did not expect more from the food when I saw the ambiance.  My main purpose for a visit was to try their pho. I have tried some good pho, even in Cleveland, and it was not it. The broth was cloudy, and tasted like instant. I asked for extra sauce , since portion that the server brought was very little (I guess keeping a bottle of it on the table was not fitting with their aesthetics ). When I asked for extra Basil, I was informed that it was and extra charge...it was not necessary, but it was fine.  I have to say, service was prompt, but almost without any inthusiasm. I can understand it since the restaurant was not busy at the time. I don't think this place is going to survive, and honestly, I can see a pub or Italian restaurant in it's place soon.  Needless to say, I will take my pho Sundays elsewhere..."}
{"text":"Had the pho with beef, eye of round, and meat balls.  It was delicious.  Nice atmosphere.  I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Nice décor, prime location, but the food is just so bad!! Can you believe they microwave food? We ordered the rib appetizer and one part was burning hot and the other end of the rib was barley warm, amateurs!!!  My husband ordered the crepe and it was so soggy on the interior, and the pork tasted old.  I ordered the \"recommended\" pad thai, and it was soooooo bad! So bland, there are so many better pad thai options in the area.  All this restaurant needs is a good chef! Don't be encouraged by all their coupons or special happy hours, you will still waste your money because you won't feel satisfied when you leave.  By the way, when I told my co-worker about my experience there, she also mentioned that she and her family didn't enjoy the food experience, so I was glad to know I was not being overcritical."}
{"text":"I love this place! We go every sunday for their steak pho. The place is comftorable and cozy. The staff is great and friendly ! Highly recommended this restaurant !"}
{"text":"I was a little skeptical given it's location with all the chain restaurants in Legacy Village, but Gia Lai actually has decent Vietnamese food!  The interior is attractive and trendy.  But enough about that, let's get down to the important stuff.....the food!!!!  The pho is good!  The broth is certainly authentic and rich with deep beefy flavor.  I've also tried the grilled shrimp summer rolls which on one occasion were AWESOME and on the other two occasions, average.  It seems like it depends who makes it.  One time, the person that made it must have really really loved rice noodles, or may have previously held a position making giant burritos at Chipotle.  The other time it seems like someone didn't want to get their fingers wet.  The rolls are made by immersing the wraps in hot water, but the edge was still hard and folded into the roll. The latter experience actually was worthy of me sending the roll back, unfortunately I was at home eating take out when this was discovered.   Take out is a easy because they have two dedicated \"Take out\" parking spaces which is awesome.  Food is overall all decent.  Quality control seems to be a bit of an issue with my limited experience at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Prices are high.  Banh Xeo wasn't very crispy. Very little flavor in the fillings. It was also not presented with enough romaine, basil, chili. You're supposed to wrap up the banh xeo bites with the lettuce. When I asked for more lettuce, the waiter came out with some iceberg lettuce. My wife ordered the vegetarian noodles which was pretty good.  Service is very good."}
{"text":"I came here soon after Gia Lai opened, so I'm not sure if things have changed since then, but my experience was just okay.   Our server was definitely a novice, but he was friendly enough, so I can't really complain about that too much. I came here for dinner with my parents, and we all ordered things from totally different sections of the menu, but they all looked and tasted wayyy too similar. And they were just average too - not bad, but definitely nothing to write home about.  I would try coming here again for a happy hour or something, but I think there other options with better food at a more competitive price point for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I ordered the beef pho and it was awful.  The meat was extremely fatty and the broth was just tinted water.  I was so hungry that I just continued to eat the tasteless noodles.    My wife had Pad Thai which she couldn't get past the taste of oil that overwhelmed the dish.    This my first post and I felt compelled to tell others so they wisely spend $50 for a dinner."}
{"text":"I don't understand why this restaurant has gotten so many bad reviews.  My boyfriend and I stopped by a few weeks ago. The restaurant was very clean and modern. He ordered a bowl of pho and I got the vermicelli; we both enjoyed our meals. Our waitress was very nice and friendly. We would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Like many other Yelpers, I stopped by with my Mom and sister for a late lunch and walked into a entirely empty restaurant. That always puts me on high alert since it's usually not a good sign.   I ordered the beef pho, my sister got the chicken pho and my mom got the glass noodle chicken soup. We also tried the spring rolls and the crab rangoon. The spring rolls were just okay, but the crab rangoon I found to be super-greasy. And I've ordered this dish from some pretty seedy take-out places. It's never tasted that strange. My mom's soup came out with shrimp and some weird pork in it and had to be sent back. When dining with two other people, all eating soup, well... that's just unfortunate since cold soup isn't appetizing and eating while you're hungry mother waits isn't fun either.  My pho was just okay. My favorite pho spots in CLE blow what they served me out of the water, but it was edible.   The server was very apologetic, but overall I just didn't find the value there for the quality of food you actually get.   I will say they serve up some damn good, fresh limeade and sparkling limeade!"}
{"text":"Walking in, the first impression is that this will get s bit pricey for a typical pho joint and I was right. However, this is also Legacy Village, so someone has to pay for the rent. My wife and I each ordered our own different pho and another dish. The flavors are about 75% spot on as compared to the little Saigon of Chicago. For east  Cleveland, I am willing to settle.  They were skimpy on giving us things like it basil and sauces, but service was good and we got more when asked of our server. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Based solely on my quick dining experience. My daughter wanted to try the phô so we stopped in. I decided I wasn't going to eat based on other reviews. I didn't want to be snobby so I ordered the crab & asparagus soup. I thought it was really gross. Not sure how two of my favorite foods can be combined and lack flavor. With our soups, they brought us two vegetable wontons. They were hard and dried out. Not sure what was in it- tofu? My daughter did not like the tofu in her phô but liked the rest. I won't return."}
{"text":"I love this place.   Admittedly I am no expert in this cuisine, but the meals I have had were delicious, healthy and served by wonderful staff.  I've been there 5 or 6 times in the last few months.  Prices are ok.  The decor is lovely and it seems very clean and comfortable.  Can't wait for my next bowl of pho."}
{"text":"seriously disappointed. What can i say other than this place does vietnamese cuisine a disservice. The flavors are bland, the cooking is heavy handed, the staff unfamiliar with cuisine and sauces."}
{"text":"Not very authentic, and they seem to try way to hard to attract customers. For instance, my waiter was so enthusiastic I felt like my boyfriend and I couldn't get a full conversation with each other without our waiter sucking up to us.  Food wise, I'd say it's tasty but not authentic. Their summer rolls (pork) is made fairly different than a traditional one although the taste is quite tasty and intriguing. The pho on the other hand, comes in one size and I personally think it's a fairly small serving for the price. I guess it is located in Legacy Village after all so the costs has to make up for their rental property.  I'd say if you're looking for authentic pho, this isn't your place. If you're craving pho and live around the area, you should come to Gia La. It's got a great atmosphere and decent food."}
{"text":"Second visit did not go so well. Showed up around 5:45 PM for dinner, which happened to be during happy hour. I wouldn't have known if I didn't ask, and even then, our waitress only mentioned the drink specials (which were pretty good--dollar drafts on Mondays). She only mentioned the appetizer specials after our orders were in the kitchen and it was too late..  The food was noticeably worse than last time, and I don't think it was any coincidence that it was during happy hour. Our goi cuon app (fresh rolls) was smaller and had very little vermicelli. The accompanying sauce was watered down and very runny. My bun thit nuong cha gio (pork/egg roll vermicelli bowl) was probably half the portion I got last time and even less veggies, and the cha gio (egg roll) was filled with mostly carrots. All unacceptable and pretty offensive. My girlfriend ordered the banh xeo (Vietnamese crepe), which had a pretty large and wellmade crepe, but keeping with the trend, had a modest amount of fillings. We both left hungry.  It's like if you show up for happy hour, you not only get discounted prices but discounted effort and quality. Make no mistake, their drink specials can't be beat in Legacy Village, but expect a tradeoff when it comes to the food. For the most part it was still good, but I couldn't help but feel gypped."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times in hopes that it will get better. Today was probably my last time. I've never had anything there except for the Pho. Its really not that hard to mess up but every time i say \" its just ok\" Today I asked for chicken pho and got something totally different! I also always get veggie spring rolls which is another thing you cant really mess up. But they are just over powered with onion to the point where it makes you sick.  Basically you can get much better. I recommend Superior Pho  Also the service SUCKS! The staff always looks like they just rolled out of bed and came to work and they dont seem to be very educated on the menu. Every time i had a question about the menu my server had to go back and ask the question. She also didn't know what kind of soda products they had. I dunno I found it weird.  Needless to say, I wont be back."}
{"text":"Pho??? I just got Pho'ck'd!! Overpriced, lacking flavor, all atmosphere...Now I know why there prices are so, to pay for the expensive decor. Gia La needs to put some of their profits into the food opposed to the lighted water fall on the wall.   Food: I ordered the \"Traditional Chicken Pho\" at $15.95...yuck! This was dried out day old chicken in a bowl of campbells chicken broth with noodles. No traditional flavors at all. No bowl of vegetables or sauces to add. They gave me Teaspoon of Siracha hot sauce and about 5 green leafs to throw in our Pho bowls w/ some raw sprouts.  Yes I said our Pho bowls. Another person on my table had the beef Pho and we were both supposed to share these vegetables. I asked for more greens and she brought me about 5 more leafs. In fact, this is supposed to be Asian-Vietnamese fushion flavor??? More like Asian dishes with no authentic flavors. Its more of an Asian-Bland Fushion.  It is actually sad, I had high hopes for this place. Unfortunately, I have eaten way better Pho at a $5 hole-in-the-wall location.   The high light of this place was the Calamari Appetizer. Delicious Batter, this is what earned its high 1 Star rating. Too bad it was overpriced @ $9.95 Appetizer, I was expecting to be able to share with at least 2 other people on my table of 6. Too bad it was barely enough of an Appetizer for me.   Another dish on my table was the Lemon Grass Chicken.  Sad..just morbidly sad. No lemon flavor or grass. Just tasted like baked chicken w/ grille lines on it. It seriously tasted like it was in defrost cycle in the Microwave and then thrown in an oven for texture.  The only thing that looked good on my table was someone ordered some shrimp and they said it was good, but I didnt get to taste it. Shrimp is pretty hard to mess up though, relief. I didnt ask to taste because on their $20 meal it looks like they got about 3 shrimps on their plate.    I would never go back, or recommend this place. I will not be surprised if they went out of business. I would like to see a good Caribean fushion place here to keep up w/ the cliental around the area. This place needs get out of Cleveland, and go to North Dakota where people have never seen a Vietamese person."}
{"text":"I would give Gia Lai 4 stars, but the service was terrible. When we walked in there was a big party and that was it.  No one was at the counter to seat us until a few minutes later.  The waitress didn't know the menu very well either.  Besides the bad service the food was delicious.  I ordered the Shrimp Rice Paper Roll that came with peanut sauce and it was authentic and tasted delicious.  For the dinner portion I had the Grilled Pork Chops with white rice.  I will definitely be back because the food was good.  This restaurant is not as authentic as Superior Pho or other Pho restaurants.  Updated review: My boyfriend and I went in right when they opened at 11. Service was great (we were the only customers). Food came out fast and very fresh! For appetizers we had beef sate and shrimp rice paper roll. I definitely recommend both. Boyfriend had chicken teriyaki with jasmine rice and said it was good, but will go back to the black pepper steak next time. I had the beef pho and it was a huge portion and tasted fresh. With the service being better, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We dined here last night after a hockey game with our grandsons, so it was a bit late - about 8:45.  We all liked our choices - we aren't experts, but have been to Vietnam and thought the dishes were authentic and delicious.     The service was prompt and couldn't have been more helpful.  The portions were generous (I'm having the 2nd half for lunch) and the room is quite lovely.  We will definitely be back.  For a shopping center restaurant, I'd say this was a hit."}
{"text":"I have to be honest....I am NOT an expert on Vietnamese food. So take this review with that in mind. I'm often in Legacy Village and had meant to stop in to Gia Lai for months. I finally stopped in and was pleasantly surprised! First, it was a weeknight and not very crowded at all. So maybe my server had the time to focus on me. But the service was excellent and the food was really good. Plus they have amazing happy hour deals that I definitely plan on returning for. I would call this place a solid option. Again, cannot speak towards authenticity with regards to the Vietnamese food, however, I had a nice night with good food and service. Works for me!"}
{"text":"Got the pad Thai and it was pretty good. The ambiance is beautiful and service was excellent. I was surprised to see this place so empty during peak hours, although nothing blew my mind food wise, I would return for a second try."}
{"text":"We just showed up at 8:25 for some phó.  The hostess informed us they were closing at 9:00 and they were only taking to go orders.  Is this a new thing?  Horrible business model..."}
{"text":"Stopped in the other night for dinner and the place was embarrassingly empty. After I had my dinner, I realized why.  I started out with a vegetable tempura appetizer. It was not so great. The tempura was crisp...but so were the vegetables. FAIL.  Since I love pho, I decided to try it out at Gia Lai. I'd never had pho with baby corn, mushrooms, and broccoli. Honestly, all I could really taste was broccoli. Don't get me wrong - I love broccoli. But not in my pho.  Not sure I'd go back again to eat but the drinks specials still seem to be pretty good. If you're looking for a lively dinner crowd you might want to look elsewhere."}
{"text":"FOOD: Their menu tries to cater to the Beachwood crowd and loses a bit of its authenticity.  For instance, they do not offer tripe in their pho, but they do offer filet mignon and chicken.  My girlfriend got a pho with eye round steak (typical to vietnamese pho places).  I got rice vermicelli with pork, shrimp and crispy spring rolls.  The pho broth was too oily for our taste, but had a good overall flavor that tasted fairly authentic.  The rice vermicelli was mildly sweet, well flavored and tasted pretty good - comparable to Saigon Grille.  SERVICE + ATMOSPHERE:  Their decor is trendy and modern, which I liked.  The service was pretty efficient for an opening day.    VALUE: The prices are a fair bit more expensive than Superior Pho and Saigon Grille in Asiatown, but that's expected for a restaurant in Legacy Village.  The pho was $10 ($8 at Superior Pho) and the vermicelli was $14 ($9 at Saigon Grille).    They overcharged $6 for our pho, but we informed the waitress and had it corrected.  Also, two waitresses tried to serve us at the same time.   Hopefully just opening day kinks that will be worked out.   All in all, I'd say Gia Lai is off to a decent start."}
{"text":"My wife and. I are great fans of Vietnamese food.  We were pleasantly surprised to find Gai Lai at Legacy Village.  Unfortunately the Bun Cha Gio was not good, bland, no peanuts, no cliantro, and the Nuoc cham was nearly without taste.  Even though we discussed this with one of the hostesses nothing was offered.  We paid the bill and left a generous tip.  We will try this place one more time, but alas may still need to travel to the westside for truly good Vietnamese food. Disappointed in Shaker"}
{"text":"I got the tofu with black bean sauce dish.  It was delicious and I can't wait to eat it again!  I'm for sure stopping in again when I feel like I want a treat!  I did find this place to be a little more expensive, but the food is fresh and tasty!  Well worth it!  Restaurant was clean and organized with friendly staff :)"}
{"text":"This place had a great atmosphere, very stylish, and I truly enjoyed my server but the food was sub par. The calamari looked like it came from the freezer section of the supermarket and it was fried to within an inch of its life! I had to send it away. The vegetarian bun was a small portion with very little in the way of fresh vegetables and peanuts but the egg rolls were very good. I should have went to CPK..."}
{"text":"Overall average. Not bad but definitely nothing special. I got the chicken pho-- the broth and sauces were good. My biggest issue was that the chicken tasted pre sliced/packaged-not fresh.  If I was looking for pho I would go to Asiatown or pho and rice on Coventry.  We also tried the pork summer rolls which were good (also average).  Service was good. Decor inside was much nicer than I had anticipated by the sign. Price was fair."}
{"text":"WWent there for dinner last night. And it was great like the first time visiting. After 8 special made my night fantastic. Definitely gia lai is the place for me to handout at weekends."}
{"text":"Ummm......yeah, not very authentic, and what's with the service?  Decided to go here with a friend on July 4th. Meh, why not, let's try this place?   The place was rather empty, but the service took a while to get to us. We both ordered the rice vermicelli- my friend got the combo (shrimp, pork, and spring roll) specifying to leave out the beef. I ordered the combo, and substituted the spring rolls with their version of a summer roll, specifying that I wanted the summer roll with the pork in it.  The waitress came back, still confused at our orders, even though she wrote it down. Ok...? We clarified again, and we got some of their \"gai la tinis\" which were way too strong and not very good. Although..it was nice to have fruit in them.  The decor of this place is very nice- not...your typical hole in the wall Asian restaurant, but it's very nice and fits in with legacy village. However, the food? Ummm....yeah, not so much. We got our dishes out...and it wasn't marinated pork..it was pork loin. And the shrimp was overdone and the noodles were also cooked too much (they were clumping together). And there really was no marinade..iono, the dish just didn't go well together (in comparison to Minh Ahn's rice vermicelli is really really good).   And it just took forever to get our dishes and it had taken forever for the waitress to get our order. She even gave me the wrong summer roll (not pork, but shrimp in it..? what???)...I asked for some peanut sauce to go with it, but it wasn't your normal hoisin sauce/peanut butter mixture...it was something...clumpy? I mean, it tasted fine...but...it just...wasn't the same.   So.... will I be back? Ehhh...probably not for authentic food...maybe just for appetizers from time to time (although the rolls weren't even that good either!). The food wasn't horrendous, and it tasted fine...it just wasn't authentic. I prefer my e30th and superior area, thank you very much..."}
{"text":"I like the place enough to return occasionally--but I have brought eight people here on three occasions in the past year, and 100% of them had bad experiences. Sometimes I have too, but East side Vietnamese food (albeit somewhat Americanized) is rare and makes a nice change. There are vegetarian options, and for good prices ($11-$12 for a decent portion). BUT: The items on the extensive vegetarian menu are NOT all vegetarian. Good luck figuring out which ones are: I got a lot of lies and dismissals and contradictory answers from different people (wait staff and by phone) simply because they didn't want to go back to the kitchen and ask which ones have no fish sauce--or because even in the kitchen, they have no idea.  SERVICE  After multiple visits over six months or so, I can say it has been consistently friendly, but consistently poor: inefficient, and many mistakes. So many wrong dishes, my guests eventually gave up and just ate the mistakes.   But the WORST thing--unforgivable in food service--is the lack of knowledge about their own dishes, and complete lack of interest in finding out the answers. Aside from vegetarians, we had people with food allergies. That's serious business! Again and again our server thought \"I don't know\" and \"probably\" were sufficient answers. Her smile faltered when pressed for real info--she didn't want to be bothered. (How could these questions not come up every single day? Do most people accept \"maybe\" as an answer about ingredients?)  In the end I was told, regarding some \"vegetarian\" dishes: \"just don't eat the sauce, it's on the side.\" As though a) I should have known psychically that this particular \"vegetarian\" dish had a meat-based sauce AND that it came on the side, and as though b) being charged full price for a sauceless, flavorless meal mis-labeled vegetarian on the menu is an acceptable alternative I should be lucky to get. I didn't get one of those dishes, needless to say.  If you're not going to cater to vegetarians, then don't pretend to. The same concern applies to any questions about the food. Stay away if you have any intolerances or disliking for certain ingredients.  ATMOSPHERE  Nice inside (modern) but quite brightly lit, and the 4 sports TVs behind the bar are out of place and distracting (but thankfully silent). The place is maybe half full at the dinner hour on weekend, and cleared out almost completely after that, so if you don't want crowds and bustle, it's worth a look.  FOOD  Average quality, acceptable for the price. But some dishes are TOTALLY different from the menu.  ALWAYS ask whether a dish is exactly like the menu describes, or something else. Example--the Pineapple Chicken:  I came with a diabetic who specifically did not want her meat breaded in carbs. Some dishes specify breading; some--like the Pineapple Chicken--don't, so she ordered that. It was explicitly stated in the menu as chicken served in a half-pineapple. Sounds fun, right? And she loves pineapple. Well, what arrived was very ordinary Chinese takeout, except for lemon in the sauce which was good and unusual. It was breaded, and it was NOT served in a pineapple; in fact it had just a couple tiny pieces of what might have been canned pineapple. Totally false advertising. She ate it anyway because she has to eat on a schedule--and got sick from it while not even enjoying it.  Other guests have commented on a bad smell in the food. Ok, I'll just say it: they agreed that onecertain dish smelled like baby poop. (But tasted OK. Then again, maybe baby poop tastes OK. I cannot opine.) The seafood tends to be worse than other dishes, I'm told.  I'll go back myself--occasionally--but I will never take guests again! I have been burned every time."}
{"text":"I've been to Gia Lai twice now and while I can't say it's the most authentic Vietnamese food I've ever had, the restaurant is beautiful (the ideal respite from a day of shopping at Legacy) and the servers are friendly.   It's nice to have some lighter menu options (spring rolls and salads) as well as some filling dishes (pho). Again, the options aren't authentic, but when you're looking for Asian fare in the area this is a heck of a lot better than Sushi Rock down the street."}
{"text":"This place is very average which explains why the restaurant is always less than half full. However the fried rice and chicken lettuce wraps are excellent."}
{"text":"I have had two very good meals here. I found the food to be light and very fresh. Vietnamese food is a fusion of French and Asian. Our meals where made to order and were delicious. I found the vegetarian pho to be one of the best in the city. Our services was excellent both times. The prices are fair and we will be back soon!"}
