{"text":"This is the best place I've eaten in Las Vegas...the food is so tasty and fresh. The menu selection is so good -- everything looks amazing. I ended up with the poppyseed pancakes with blueberry-ginger compote. It was large enough for two meals and it was delicious. My friend got the vegan carrot-coconut pancakes so I got to try them too --- they were so fluffy and yummy too. I also ordered the green juice and it was so GOOD. I think the best I've had yet. The service was good. I wish there was a MTO's in Portland. My only regret is that I couldn't stay long enough in Vegas to try out the whole menu. If you are into fresh healthy and delicious and creative food, don't miss MTO."}
{"text":"Love it here. My special lady friend and I come here usually around twice a month. I've never been disappointed by the food or the service. Hangover Burger is phenomenal!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is well done & trendy. Great spot. Menu is certainly big enough and should have something for everyone. I've eaten here twice this week. Had the Philly cheesesteak. It was really awesome. Perfectly cooked. Today I had a Ruben sandwich which was also very good. Well trimmed, so not fatty. My only complaint is it seems a bit pricey. $17 for  lunch without a server.  But the food is really good. So...  I guess I'll pay!"}
{"text":"Counter service. The people that deliver the food ask if you need anything else, but don't mean it. We didn't know where the silverware and napkins were so when they dropped of our food, we asked for utensils. She said, \"they are on the counter.\" and left. They dropped of my dad's pancakes without any butter. The bussers were extremely rude. As we were standing up to leave, I was gathering my baby's things, the busser asked us to move so he could clear the table. I understand needing the table, but they couldn't wait the 30 second for us to leave. The food is incredibly bland, and I ordered chorizo, an item that is typically full of flavor. My husband ordered chicken and waffles, the country gravy tasted like flour. My mom had the avocado omelet. The avocado was still hard since it wasn't ripe enough. My sister ordered an omelet that came with a side salad. That \"salad\" consisted of no more than 7 leaves and no dressing (see photos). I literally laughed. It looked like an incomplete garnish. Definitely pass on this one."}
{"text":"Don't order online - I place an order - was not only charged twice - after an hour and not receiving any food I called and they didnt even have an order in their system for me.  

First and last time trying this place."}
{"text":"We ordered the MTO breakfast and chicken skillet. It was delicious! We will definitely be back for more! Can't wait to try different items on the menu!!! The environment is very relaxing and the service is great!!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best place I've Kentucky fried chicken. First time here and the place is AMAZING! Rachel was our server and she's super sweet. Love the vibe and it was close to where we were staying at."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Has awesome food as well as service. Recommend the Hangover burger and/or BOB!!! My husband is obsessed :) Thank you Dawn and your staff for the great service."}
{"text":"Pretty nice place, great customer service. If you have a sweet go here and get the fat Elvis. It's so damn good."}
{"text":"Never disappointed when we come to MTO.  

Make sure to stop by the downtown Las Vegas location as they have bottomless mimosas"}
{"text":"An oasis of tastiness in downtown Vegas!

Easy to find and park as the parking garage is right above it and cheap at $3.  PLus it is an easy walk to the Smith Center.  

The menu is seemingly small but confounding as there are so many yummy dishes.  They just opened but I have been there twice.  

I loved the Chicken and Waffles, which I've never tried before and they have killer omelettes and pancakes.  Then there's the Fat Elvis.  French Toast with bacon, peanut butter, nutella and bananas.  So good.  The hash browns had me going until I realized they were crispy on the outside and stuffed with mashed potatoes inside.  Wow.

Definitely a must stop-by when dealing with anything downtown.  Or just because you want to check out the evolving scene..."}
{"text":"Usually a good experience but today was one of the worst I have ever had at a restaurant. First, they only had one person working the register while 6 people randomly acted busy behind him. The line built up and took forever while the 6 other staff did menial tasks like put ice cubes in the sink. After waiting in line for 15 minutes, they somehow lost our order. It took another 30 minutes for them to deliver any food. The help eventually came over to tell us they were going to put a rush order on our food but it still took them another 15 minutes after that. For our trouble, they offered us a free pastry, which nobody wanted. Eventually we just left and never received half of our order. Terrible experience"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful experience at MTO Cafe today. I came around 10:45 am on a Sunday. Parked in the attached City Hall garage for $3.00 (Sunday price). When I came in the door, I was seated right away. Thank goodness I came at a good time, as the place was completely packed when I left an hour later. Oh and they have counter seating for us \"solo diners\", which was great. 

I ordered coffee, which was delicious, and in a very generous mug, and the pineapple mint mimosa. The pineapple and mint was pretty mild, but still very delicious. I also ordered the steak and eggs, which comes with toast and \"mash browns\". Simple dish, but was fresh and delicious. Garlic and herbs accompanied the steak and hash browns.

My server/counter attendant Lisa was awesome and personable. I can't wait to come back to try other dishes!"}
{"text":"Loved the Tree Hugger quinoa patties and greens for brunch! Delicious and healthy! Very quick service too!"}
{"text":"Wow wow wow. I had the avocado omelette and was blown away at the taste and the freshness. They had me at the basil infused watermelon drink! Allie our server was very nice and treated us well. Do not miss this place when travelling to the downtown area of Las Vegas. The location is safe clean and relaxing."}
{"text":"Best place to go to when you want that breakfast in my pictures I'm showing the MTO breakfast and my 1st time trying chicken and waffles ... 1st bite is unbelievable ... Young Lee is the man!"}
{"text":"Went with my mom and brother. The service was great both the manager and owner came to see us they were very friendly.  They made us some fresh cookies since they were out on the strawberry short cake. The cookies were \"melt in your mouth\" soft. 

We ordered a bowl of clam chowder and a Hangover burger. The clam chowder is to die for I would travel literally to the other side of town for the clam chowder soup. My brother had the hangover burger this burger was like a slice of home all in one burger for a local person this burger was like a loco move exactly but with a bun. We all will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Well... I have to say I'm quite disappointed and embarrassed for this place. It's Christmas Eve, my girlfriend and I walk in here at 145 and are asked by the girl at the cashier what we would like to order. We ask her for just a moment to get our order together and Some guy, I don't know if he was the day manager or what runs out from the back to kick us out and say they're closing the kitchen at 2. Mind you we still have 15 min left and the place is pretty busy and someone is literally ordering ahead
Of us at the same time. This has to be one of the shittiest customer service experiences I've ever had. My business advisor owns a business in the high rise tower about 50 feet away and ill be sure to spread the word, service blows here. How unfortunate I don't get to try the food here when it has some good reviews."}
{"text":"Very good food 1st time there I will come back. The manager David was very attentive to us"}
{"text":"Kentucky Fried Chicken!  Food was great.  Coffee was really good also. Friendly service.  No longer serve their mini donuts (too bad).  Haven't tried the apple rings yet, but getting some to go. Also we enjoyed the free cookie with Yelp check-in.  I recommend this place.  Try the Kentucky Fried Chicken."}
{"text":"The breakfasts here are amazing (and huge)! I have been here several times and the wait staff is very friendly and truly believe in service. The doughnuts are ode-worthy, and the eggs extra tasty. Now one of my regular breakfast stops. Have had lunch there--also good--and huge! The only cons are paying to park and I wish the menu had a few more options...but don't let that stop you. 

Go. Go now."}
{"text":"Great food! A must have are the bacon dipper pancakes yummy! Service is good attentive and cool ambiance!"}
{"text":"The food is great! We ordered a wide varitey of food.  The staff is very friendly and there is a great ambiance.  Plus, you can't beat $15 bottomless mimosas!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and service!  I had the BLTAE and it was delicious, literally too big to pick up. Probably shareable. Everyone in my group gave it 5 stars so everything is good. Bottomless mimosas and bloody mary's, at least on the weekends."}
{"text":"Finally tried MTO Cafe. Extensive menu for both the health conscious and the merely hungry. The black and blue burger was juicy and flavorful- caramelized onions, arugula, and mushrooms. Yum! Also tried the chicken and waffles. The chicken had a crispy Cajun kick to it that made it delicious. It's served with a side of their country gravy. Our server was attentive and friendly, and the manager (perhaps owner) checked in on our table as well. There is ample seating and a casual, relaxed vibe. The hazelnut latte was great. And! They offer mimosas! Will return soon."}
{"text":"If you are in Vegas, try to drive a little bit more to downtown to MTO Café for brunch.  The food is fresh and delicious.   I will definitely come here next time when I visit Vegas."}
{"text":"This place was delicious and it was so yummy! Definitely plan to come back next year to Vegas and eat here!  The service was excellent! Got my free cookie too yummy!"}
{"text":"This is a really nice place to have breakfast or lunch. The decore is fresh an modern. The food is delicious (love the yoga pants omelette!) and affordable. But what makes this place extra-great is the staff - they are really pleasant and smiley."}
{"text":"I would give them 0 starts if I could 
Worst food ever and very expensive for the crap they selling 
I paid 45$ for an omelette which I send back, a burger, a cappuccino and a small green juice ...
Really?
I left hungry since I couldn't eat that thing 
Toast was soaked in butter, omelette not cooked and taste awful"}
{"text":"There on Saturday a 2:30 .Only person there and my Wrap order took 20-25 minutes to serve. I kept looking around to see what was taking so long. 2 or 3 guys in back prep area. Service was not a priority to them. Good food poor service."}
{"text":"Very dissappinted in service. My boyfriend and I are vegan and specifically came here because another vegan told us of their great experience. I saw that some items on the menu could be made vegan upon request. I ordered the tomato basil soup which came with a grilled cheese - all vegan. We also ordered a falafel sandwich. When the soup and grilled cheese arrived, the grilled cheese looked a little suspicious. I asked if it was vegan, and the woman said no, they don't have vegan cheese. They had no answer when we asked why a non-vegan side would come with a vegan item on the menu. Instead of rectifying their own mistake, we were offered two toothpicks with three small pieces of fruit. The manager said that's \"the best\" he could do. 

We will not return and do not recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"Saw good reviews for MTO on Yelp and a really reliable food blog (bite and switch), decided to give this place a try for breakfast, and am happy I did. For context and credibility...I'm new to Vegas and so far I've eaten at Eat for breakfast, Honey Salt for lunch, DW Bistro for lunch, Yanaka for dinner, Frank and Fina's Cocina for diner and these are all places I've enjoyed and would eat at again. I'm not a chain gal and would never say that Denny's and IHOP have delicious pancakes. With that said...MTO does make a great pancake. I had the lemon poppyseed pancakes with blueberry and ginger compote (ask for extra compote) and a cup of coffee. The pancakes werent too sweet or oily, almost a muffin consistency. Solid cup of coffee. This is a perfect breakfast in a \"clean well-lighted place.\" The restaurant has a great vibe, a hip, but not pretentious decor, and Mike the owner is welcoming. I'll be back and would like to try out their lunch menu too."}
{"text":"Off the strip but it's worth it the drive. Great customer service with hardy comfort food. Interesting twist on familiar dishes."}
{"text":"Breakfast was very good with hospitable service! I tried a scramble and it was very good! Can't wait to come back here & try more items on the menu! The Owners were very nice & both checked in on me during breakfast!"}
{"text":"Great space.
Terrific vibe.
Fantastic staff.
Also, the food exactly what you'd expect comfort that hugs back."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot away from craziness of the strip. Friendly and attentive staff, nice relaxed ambience, good coffee, excellent food. Chicken skillet was fantastic."}
{"text":"From the minute we walked in and were greeted with a smile, we knew we found the right place! They gave us a big Texas welcome! Hubby and I wanted to get away from the action for a bit and find a new spot to have lunch.  Thanks to Yelp and all the great reviews, glad we did it! Great spot, great food & very friendly people.  Gave the waitress a hug on my way out!  I had the Strawberry Fields salad with chicken & he had the Turkey Melt.  All delicious!  And of course, finished it off with the Apple Rings.  Wow, is all I can say.  
 We will be back!"}
{"text":"Ate at the MTO café for the first time today and was not disappointed. The food is amazing. I got the caeser salad and a grilled cheese with fries. The salad was enough for a meal and shared with my friends. Absolutely loved the grilled cheese, so delicious.  I am not much of a fries person but these were delightful. I didn't even put a condiment on them. great food and a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Dined on a Sunday morning when they were apparently short-staffed. Service to be seated and waited on was slow. The coffee was excellent but my food choice was just okay.  I ordered the pancakes with the bacon in the middle (pancake bacon dippers?) and I wish I would have ordered them prepared separately.  I ended up peeling the bacon out."}
{"text":"This placed jumped the shark...mediocre service + cold hash browns + ehhhh omelet = worrisome trend.  Last year, this was a much better spot."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate at MTO on 6/7/2014.  I had the Hero sandwich and my husband had the Kentucky Fried Chicken.  Both were excellent.

The KFC had a subtle flavor in the gravy and when we asked the manager he said they add a little bit of cinnamon.  WOW great flavor.

Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"One of the places that I have had my eye on for quite sometime now! So glad I wasn't disappointed! You arrive and wait to be seated! We were greeting by a lovely lady with such a happy welcome. We were sat down and our server Derek was amazing very friendly and handsome lol. He came and took our drink order. We reviewed the menu and I was stuck in being healthy or eating happy! My sister as usual she got the Broccoli Skillet and added avocado! Very good and healthy, it came with eggwhites, spinach, broccoli, more greens and cheese! I got the harty MTO Breakfast! Which has a lot of protein! With chicken sausage, spam, two types of bacon and your choice of toast! Since I checked in I recieved a chocolate chip cookie, which was amazing!  The place its self looks amazing, I love the street art and other decoration! Best thing for me at least is that it feels clean and looks clean! Which is an A++ in my book! Great place for breakfast can't wait to come for lunch time! They also have validation for parking and I received tickets to the Foodie Fest Amazing made my dreams come true! Thank You MTO and Derek!"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast and wasn't impressed. Had French Toast which was a little overcooked. Friend had chicken and eggs said it wasn't too bad. A little overpriced for what you get. Ambiance was nice, though and you can bring your dogs. May try again, but won't rush back."}
{"text":"This place is killer! Come hungry! Food is spectacular - friendly, laid-back service and great coffee in an extra-large mug! This place is a keeper. We will be back!"}
{"text":"We have tried just about everything on the menu and the food has always been exceptional.  The food is always fresh and has a ton of flavor. The service is great, very friendly staff. Our kids love this place too so it makes it an easy choice for us."}
{"text":"I know by my many check-ins here you would think I'd be giving it 5-stars but it's all about location for me and MTO.  This place happens to be right in the middle of my office and my lunch buddy so we meet here often.  The cafe has a clean and refreshing atmosphere, service is excellent but food is overall \"good\" with a few glimmers of YUM.  

I always read the menu and order with great expectations but more often than not, my taste buds are left underwhelmed.  It's basically healthy comfort food but maybe that''s my whole internal conflict. Anyhow, let''s get to the grub.  Here's a run-down of what I've tried with a *STAR* rating 1-5:

--Coffee  ****
--Green juice ***
--Avocado omelet **
--Fries**
--Philly steak sandwich ***
--Tomato soup with cheese toast  ****
--Caesar salad with chicken ***
-- Fried chicken w/gravy, eggs and smashbrowns *****  (best thing there!)
--MTO Breakfast **"}
{"text":"I have never had an egg dish and hash brown cooked the way I like it until I had breakfast today. The eggs were perfect not dry, taste was perfect, the crunchiness of the hash brown was perfect
 Still crunchy while egg was on top for a while.  Now my fav breakfast find. Am very picky with my egg dishes as I too can cook. Try it!!!."}
{"text":"MTO is fantastic! Great food and great service! The manager David is awesome! They have both healthy food and comfort food! Great place for kids!  Check this place out you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"While strolling through the old town, we ran across this place right outside the old town. They have various choices for vegetarian and even vegan seekers. The food is prepared with unique combinations to elevate the taste. The latte or fresh MTO Juice complements the taste of each dish. Dont forget to ask for 'the bob' vegetarian style!!"}
{"text":"Perfect place to come in on a Sunday. Loved our waitress Michelle she was amazing and made our experience wonderful. Great service, food and bottomless bloody Mary's."}
{"text":"I've tried MTO on three occasions and what can I say? Food is fresh and execution was solid. I had the treehugger and the turkey melt, both were delicious. In fact I didn't know you can make quinoa taste so good. :) Also had the KFC and that was umm ... So awesome I ate the entire thing. I almost want to say this will be one of our fave brunch spots in Vegas. Ambiance was also very nice and open. Good brunch spots are hard to find :)"}
{"text":"Love the food here.  It's a bit pricey but you get what you pay for - high quality food with great flavor.  I took off a star because many of the soda choices were out of stock and the kids cheese burger was overcooked and the bun was hard."}
{"text":"Let me make a categorical statement...........this is probably one of the best breakfast food I have eaten in my life. Not cheap....but then I did not order any cheap dish on the menu.  And I have traveled all over US. The Crab benedict was amazing. Even a simple sandwich  was well prepared. Service too was excellent."}
{"text":"So downtown you have Eat and you have MTO if you want brunch that is not in a casino. I have to say the food and service at MTO was decent, but I didn't understand the high price. The dishes we had were good, but definitely not worth the price tag.

I do have to say, it was a well designed space for the restaurant. I'll probably try it again."}
{"text":"Veggie skillet was amazing! Awesome flavor combos. Great food and great service. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Amazing!! My gals and I came here twice in 48 hours. Great, fresh food. Huge cups of coffee, attentive cheerful service and we voted- cutest chef and owner in Vegas!

Highly recommend. We will be back."}
{"text":"So disappointed!! NO LONGER SERVING MASHBROWNS??!?!!  Say it ain't so, Joe!! 
We have loved and revered the MTO for serving God's gift to breakfast in the form of the heavenly MASHBROWN and make it a priority to breakfast here when we in LV for various kids' sports/dance competitions. In fact this last time, we stayed over an EXTRA NIGHT just so my son could get his fix only to have post-frozen, dry, tasteless, Denny's-type potatoes cubes appear where the mashbrowns should have been. Son, and Mom and Dad, so sad!
All other food, service, atmosphere was exemplary as usual. Still one of our favorite places but I will call ahead to see if they have rectified the situation before coming again. I really hope they do, I would hate to take MTO out of our dining priority line-up."}
{"text":"Great place off the strip - kid and Vegan friendly, won't bust the budget, short drive well worth the trip!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat for breakfast, lunch or dinner while shopping at DT Summerlin. Their menu has great variety, and they are incredibly consistent with the quality.

Amber at the front is always super nice, and Chris one of the managers is really attentive every time I have ever asked for anything. 

My favorite healthy option is the Tree Hugger, with a secret hack to add chicken. The Tree Hugger is a quinoa patty sandwich with a great spicy aioli. The added chicken completes the meal, as I always want a protein.

If you're feeling healthy schmealthy, the chicken and waffles is a MUST try.

Overall, lots of options, good food and really friendly staff."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and environment! They even validate your parking! I went with my friend on a Friday morning in July and he place was fairly busy but we were able to get a table right away. Our server Ryan was very nice and courteous, with a pleasant personality. 
We ordered the mto breakfast, chorizo skillet with cheese, and a fat Elvis to share. The mto breakfast was delicious, especially the chicken sausage and the mash Browns. I was also told that the skillets came with potato which is why I ordered the skillet rather than an omelet or scramble. The skillet was out of this world delicious, especially adding cholula to it. The fat Elvis was where it's at. So decadent and should be shared.
I also took advantage of the free cookie with check in and it was a homemade chewy gooey chocolate chip kind. So full and happy!"}
{"text":"Referred by the  concierge at the Aria.  Donna was our waitress and was great!  Had supper at Ramsey's Burgr last night and this was better."}
{"text":"The food here is the quality Denny's. This place is over priced. I had pancakes w/ bacon in the pancakes that was doughy (maybe under cooked) I also had some kind of hash brown mash potatoes type of side dish (signature dish) that was greasy. Our waitress Michelle was forgetful and wasn't very social."}
{"text":"We found this place on Yelp and had to try it the apple rings are amazing. Great food and service.  Next time in Vegas we will be back."}
{"text":"Good food.  Wouldnt get green juice unless you enjoy cumber.  Serbice wad reallt good. Apple rings  and sanwhiches excellant."}
{"text":"After shopping in downtown Summerlin we decide to grab a bite to eat! The line wasn't bad and we actually got a seat on the patio. I waited 30 minutes to get a turkey wrap. My friend that was with me, ordered before me never received his meal (Chicken wrap). I finished my entire meal before he got up to speak with the manager. The manager stated that his meal would be the next one up. At this point he was beyond hungry so we waited around another 15 minutes . Still after 15 minutes he still hadn't received his meal, so we asked for a refund and left! All in all they have the WORST customer service I have ever seen. The fries were about all I could care for. If your looking for some good fries and bad customer service this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"We had the bacon pancake dippers and mac and cheese. Food was really good. Atmosphere is cozy. All employees were super friendly. Great place for comfort food!"}
{"text":"Went on Friday and it wasn't very busy yet the service was average at best. The food descriptions by the waitress were minimal and drink glasses sat empty throughout most of the meal while the waitress spoke to another employee and folded silverware. The hamburger I ordered was good but undercooked. The French fries were good."}
{"text":"Don't mind the construction going on outside the place is open. We stopped in for brunch on Sunday and there was a full house. We waited about 10 minutes before anyone came over the \"lobby\" where people where packing in to be seated. (I think they were short staffed) We asked the guy to sit at the bar and once we made it there, the service was great! It was my first time there & they were very helpful with menu questions! The place is spotless and very well decorated. Food was great! ***Be sure to try the lattes***"}
{"text":"It was my first time in this restaurant and it was amazing...had the Fat Elvis... I'm not really a banana person (like the minions...lol) but it was fantastic...mimosas were also good...staff very personable... loved the wall mural and the total package of the place...owner was very well loved by the customers and it is apparent that it is not for show because he knows that parents of his customers are visiting the city..."}
{"text":"First time here. Sunday morning breakfast was amazing! All our dishes were hot, fresh, and flavorful. Beyond the good food, the staff was great! A group of young adults, and acted like they were owners. Every customer greeted, every customer said goodbye to, and every table cleaned timely. Wow! Will be back!"}
{"text":"Working in North Las Vegas with a colleague.   We started the day at 5:30 am and went out for a late brunch.  The food is awesome and service was excellent.   We chatted with the GM and she was super friendly and you could tell she loved the place.
I highly recommend this place to my fellow Yelpers.
Try the KFC.  It was superb.  My colleague had the BLTAE and he loved it."}
{"text":"I am staying downtown at the Golden Nugget and needed a tasty, healthy lunch (preferably heavy on the veggies) stat! Thanks to Eater Vegas, I was directed to MTO Café - literally a minute drive from where I'm staying.  I ended up getting the strawberry fields salad with steak.  It was super-tasty -- just the right ratio of cheese, dressing and steak.  The staff were friendly and quick.  I ended up sending my starving boyfriend over after I left so he could get a good breakfast.  While I didn't imbibe, it looked like they had a great beer selection.  I have friends who often stay downtown when they visit Las Vegas and I plan on recommending MTO Café to all of them."}
{"text":"Ask for Donna!  She's awesome!!! Super cool New Yorker  and great food they never disappoint."}
{"text":"With the resturant having more than half of the tables empty,  a line out the door waiting to order.... 

You tell everyone you're not taking orders to catch up?  So basically you cant handle a crowd that fills only half of your capacity. 

Cut your menu down or do a better time with staffing. 

Waited at the front of the line for 15 minutes while you \"caught up\".  The staff just ignored everyone in line making us all wonder why we are just standing here. 


The manager just say on his phone looking confused and nervous.


Finally got to order... was given the excuse that too many people ordered burgers so it cooled the grill down. 

Food wasnt good enough to make up for the long wait and price that came along with it."}
{"text":"The service was great.  I ordered a hamburger medium-well.  It tasted good.  However, I started to feel queasy a few hours later and got severe food poisoning that night."}
{"text":"We're always looking for new breakfast places to try, so decided to venture out to this cafe. I was disappointed in their limited breakfast menu, they basically have a few omelets and the standard  3 eggs and choice of meat items. The cafe is small and you order at the counter. They have outdoor seating but no awning or umbrellas to help give you a bit of shade. Since nothing on their breakfast menu was appealing to me, I ordered the vegan falafal and my partner ordered the Kentucky fried chicken breakfast. He said that his breakfast was ok, but nothing he would order again. My falafal on the other hand was absolutely delicious. The falafals were very flavorful and I loved the light basalmic tahini sauce, it was just right and did not overpower the falafal, it comes served on a bed of mixed greens in a wrap of soft bread. I would definitely come back for this."}
{"text":"Located in an older part of LV that is being revitalized. The decor is tasteful and upbeat. Service is very good. Food is great! 

Visiting from out of town, our family of five brunched at MTO on Easter Sunday. They take reservations for large parties; I should have checked that in advance. So we had a bit of a wait, but it was totally worth it!

Portions are huge. We ordered 3 meals for the five of us (three teenagers and two parents). The Lemon Poppy Pancakes with the Blueberry Ginger sauce was amazing ($11)! My husband happily found a vegan, gluten-free carrot/coconut pancake option that was delicious ($11). My two teenage carnivores split a three-eggs, chicken sausage, sour dough toast meal ($14). (Again, the portions are huge!) 

The diner coffee was delicious. They even had soy milk for the vegans. The fresh squeezed OJ was refreshing. Each beverage was $3.

I would definitely go again when in the area. Plenty of paid street parking nearby."}
{"text":"Good variety of entrees on the menu. Their green juice is delicious!  I really enjoyed their Fat Elvis french toast breakfast. Great atmosphere,  awesome customer service, clean with a nice decor! I recommend other visitors giving this restaurant a try!"}
{"text":"Huge tasty hangover breakfasts, try the chicken in a waffle.  The gravy has a touch of cinnamon, it's wonderful."}
{"text":"Found this place on our way out of Vegas!  So delish!  Great comfort food for sure. Recommend the Kentucky fried chicken!"}
{"text":"This place is worth the walk from Freemont street.   Sure, at first I didn't know if it was a good idea leaving the downtown street when a homeless gentleman starting calling me and my girl \"pieces of s&%#, Mother F$#@$%S\" and another gent was seemingly trying to do something vulgar with a traffic cone.   When we reached the point where the girlfriend was going to start the \"you never listen, ask for directions\" BS, we found it.    Most of the places in Vegas are dark and smokey but when you first go into MTO Cafe, it is open and sunny.  The staff was friendly and service top notch.  The food was delicious and tasted great.  My lady had the berry waffles and I had the Fat Elvis, French toast with peanut butter, nuttela, bananas and a scattering of strawberries, it was awesome!   Say that you used Yelp and they will give you a cookie."}
{"text":"Great place, comfortable atmosphere. Everything looked great but I was unfortunate enough to order the vegan carrot and coconut pancakes. A great example of everything that can go wrong with vegan cooking: gooey, dense and overly sweet to cover up the extra baking powder. Basically a flat ball of dough on a plate with nothing else on the side. I really don't want to be hard on the place but of all vegan things, vegan pancakes are probably the one thing you shouldn't have an issue making ;)"}
{"text":"Very good food with lovely presentation. Everything we ordered was freshly prepared; the really red juice, the chorizo omelette, the French onion soup and the turkey sandwich. I have to take a moment to gush about the soup; rich and flavorful with a sinful Gruyere crouton. The place was clean and smartly decorated. The place and the food was so good I thought it might be in danger of a hipster territorial pissing contest judging by the number of bearded men wearing skinny jeans and fidoras. I would put up a good fight though; the food, service and atmosphere are worth it."}
{"text":"MTO I will definitely be visiting you again when I come back to Vegas!! Great food, great service!!!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice now and the food is solid. I tried the vegan pancakes. They're sweet but heavenly. Eggs were cooked to perfection. The coffee was solid. I want to love it ( and give a better rating) but they need to work on management. Both times I've been we were advised the kitchen was backed up and indeed our food took time. I attempted to go a third time this weekend and despite several open tables, we were told the kitchen was backed up and to expect a 30 minute wait. For such a small seating area and small selection it seems a little crazy. Also, and I'm about to sound old, turn the music down just a little. Fix the kitchen, hire better servers and you might just have one of the better breakfast spots in town."}
{"text":"MTO is our \"go to\" place for breakfast while visiting downtown Las Vegas. The options are all so fresh, the staff very pleasant, and the environment welcoming. The lunch options look so good, but we've only been for breakfast because we wake up and only want to go back to MTO to try whatever we haven't had yet."}
{"text":"This was my first visit with my girlfriend to a restaurant here in at the mall. We're giving all of the restaurants in the new mall a try, and so far by far this Café is #1 by far compared to my previous dining. This guy in a zebra shirt recommended the chicken in a waffle and their hangover burger. Both were fantastic. Later he came back and talked to us and we found out the nice guy was a manager....I'm coming back for that zebra shirt btw haha. He was very friendly, the register girl was very friendly, and the atmosphere was friendly. Will definitely try again after my tour of the mall."}
{"text":"Ordered a Broccoli and Avocado Skillet with a side order of Bacon and waited over 30minutes for our meal. Had to walk up to the counter to inquire about order twice and was told they had a computer glitch. Everyone else who ordered after me received their order and left the premise before we finally got our meal. I was very disappointed and would not eat there or recommend this establishment. A restaurant manager tried to remedy the situation with fried doughnuts but that didn't do the trick in my book! Meal Should've been refunded!"}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast options in town! Huge portions (especially on the MTO breakfast & the Fat Elvis) and the chef brings a refined touch not usually found in breakfast fare. Sandwiches and burgers are great, too! Great food and a friendly staff make MTO a winner."}
{"text":"My favorite brunch spot in Vegas.  Love that their food items are locally sourced.  Bottomless mimosas anyone?"}
{"text":"We've had the pleasure of dining all over the world and must say that this breakfast is truly one of the best we have ever had. Put it on your list of things to do in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Healthy, hip, clean and delicious!
If you want the healthy side of Vegas, check this place out. They also have great service and fun artwork!
Thank you MTO Cafe!"}
{"text":"As an expert in good fried chicken, I was compelled to try the Kentucky Fried Chicken. On top of a mash brown and topped with an over easy egg, the chicken was the tastiest that I have had in a long time. This restaurant is the place to be. Wonderful food!"}
{"text":"Searched yelp for a close by breakfast place as we were leaving Vegas. Parking was easy (and cheap). 
Loved the check in special! Make sure to show the waitress, and receive a free, fresh cookie. It was super delicious! 
I ordered the turkey melt and my husband got the Philly cheesesteak. You can taste the time taken to make these foods. The sourdough bread was to die for. Also, I really like the shoe string fries the sandwiches come with. 

We also got 20% off for Active duty military.  
Would definitely recommend this cafe to my friends. 
The atmosphere is casual and super friendly staff!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for awesome food and a fun relaxing environment, this is the place to be. The employees here are amazing! Shelby, Trevor, & Amber shine way above the rest, they are the reason me and my wife keep coming back, aside from the amazing food that is. Keep up the great work guys!"}
{"text":"This place is going to be (already is) busy!  Its nice to have another fast-casual option in Summerlin.  

We went for \"brunch\".  I use quotes because MTO is one of those restaurants that has a little of everything on its all-day menu.  Ordered a waffle for the kids to share, I had the Reuben, wife had some healthy looking thing with Quinoa cakes (it looked good but I didn't pay attention to the clever name), and got the chicken pot-pie for my dad. Green juice and coffee for the wife, soft drinks for me and dad. Some friends met us so I also witnessed the falaffel, the broccoli skillet, clam chowder, onion soup, and kids pancake.

The food was very good, everybody's looked appetizing and I was glad that my dad didn't finish his pot pie because it meant I got to help him with this pretty decadent dish.  Fresh chicken pieces with the veggies in a skillet topped with fresh baked biscuits... it was delicious and probably a million calories.  My Reuben was made with \"corned buffalo\"... I assume that buffalo is leaner than beef, from a taste perspective it tasted like traditional corned beef.  

The service was friendly and timing was fine (they apologized that it took long as they had only recently opened but it didn't feel too long to us... perhaps because we weren't in a rush and the kids weren't bouncing off the walls). 

A few things of note: 
- 4 entrees and 4 drinks... $76... not a bargain but not totally unreasonable in my estimation.  

- They have one of those new fangled coke machines that dispenses hundred of different variations.  I like these when a restaurant is not busy, but they're a major hassle when busy as you wait for one person to select their beverage and then for the software to reset... not the restaurant's fault.

- Coffee... my wife ordered a plain black coffee, when I went to the counter to request a refill I was meant with looks of confusion.  Finally someone said we are not currently set up for complimentary refills. I replied, \"fine, I'll pay for it\"... after a little more scrambling on their part I went back to the register with her cup, asked for a refill, was reiterated that there was a charge for refill, now replied with annoyance in my voice \"got it, charge me\".  Upon paying the $3+ for an additional cup of plain coffee I said to the cashier \"I grasp the idea that you don't refill premium coffees such as lattes or cappuccinos but most breakfast-y places provide complimentary refills on plain drip coffee\"... He apologized and took 10% of the coffee (approx $0.30)... kind of insulting.  
 
It was a little cold on the outside patio but the heaters helped and it was nice because we could sit there and watch the kids play on the other side of the patio.

We'll be back."}
{"text":"Ryan our server was awesome! Very attentive and had great suggestions on the menu!  Great find in DT LV!"}
{"text":"The Ruben is the best thing ever, it's bison meat... very lean and tasty.  You've also gotta try the mash browns!  The lemon pancakes poppy seed pancakes with blueberry compote, not so good.  Very dry and not enough lemon flavor.  Very good service, on the spot with the bottomless mimosas."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast, great service and fun staff! Highly recommend coming here and getting the KFC breakfast and adding avocado! So good!!"}
{"text":"We visited this location since we know the MTO brand from our visits to the downtown location. When I walked in to this MTO I felt lost I felt like it wasn't MTO which completely defeated the purpose of me going to visit a brand I already know."}
{"text":"Came here based off other yelp reviews and it did not disappoint. Food was great, we had the hangover burger and the BLTAE. Everything was delicious really crispy fries and super think flavorful bacon. Huge coffee mugs bottomless mimosas and bloodies. Worth the 5 min walk off Fremont"}
{"text":"I had the Reuben.... Pretty delicious. I'll be coming back to try more of the dishes they offer. Fries are skinny and good as well."}
{"text":"So good. The KFC was great especially the mash browns.  I've been talking about them since I left. Possibly my favorite meal I had the whole time I was in Vegas."}
{"text":"Stayed at the Golden Nugget and looked up Breakfast places on Yelp and found MTO Cafe. A short walk was well worth it! Breakfast was great! MTO Breakfast entree looked as good as it tasted. Avocado omelet was also very good but could have used a bit more tomatillo sauce. At the last minute we added a side of lemon poppy pancakes and they were amazing! With fresh blueberry sauce and blueberries as the topping they had amazing flavor and the perfect amount of crispness. Don't pass them up!!"}
{"text":"Clean & nice but the food was subpar. I had the lemon poppyseed pancakes with blueberry-ginger compote. They don't have many options for vegetarians. I have no desire to return to try something else on the menu."}
{"text":"Second time here in two days. Loved it.  Will come back. Wish I had one in my town. Great service friendly manager and servers.  Top notch. Try the skillets. Love the large coffee cups."}
{"text":"I came Easter Sunday and they had the Steak & eggs special and was Delicious! They should add that to the menu :) Came a second time and was not impressed. Food lacked flavor."}
{"text":"Took forever for our server to come after we got seated. Our server wasnt writing our orders down so he kept coming back and asking us what we ordered. Then when we asked for our checks our server forgot to get it. The food is good though, if you don't mind waiting a lot. Or just go on a slow"}
{"text":"I do love what they have on the menu.  I just wish there was more of a selection.  The menu is small and I understand why and they do it well just wish there was a little more that they offered at times."}
{"text":"I was expecting a lot more based on the reviews. Decided to stop by for brunch on our way to the strip since we were staying in Fremont Street. We had the bottomless mimosas which were okay. The food all sounded good but was ok. Nothing to write home about. 

The place was very cute and the staff was very nice. They just need to work on their food."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.   Fresh and unique breakfast options.   Everyone is friendly."}
{"text":"-Fresh high quality ingredients
-friendly staff
-clean and spacious 
-pumping out the food real fast"}
{"text":"Great café! Very upbeat environment with tasty fresh-made food to match. I ordered their avocado omelet - VERY filling without being over-stuffed with cheese or other crappy fillings. Fresh-squeezed orange juice and imported Italian coffee, it's a breakfast hotspot definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Glad to finally have stopped in and we had a great breakfast of the chicken fried and eggs.  The bloody Mary served by Lisa was just perfect.  Even though you have to park in the garage, they validate the ticket and you're set.  I'll  definately be back."}
{"text":"Great decor and cute signage for the restrooms. Love the plate glass storefront that looks out on Main Street and City Hall. You can also dine al fresco. The food, I had the MTO breakfast which had 4 different breakfast, toast, 3 eggs and those very good hash browns you're going to hear about. Everything was cooked perfectly. The chicken sausage was my favorite. My dining partner had the salmon burger. Two highlights - homemade pickles on top and they really treat that salmon filet nicely. Highly recommend. For dessert, we had the suggested fried apple slices. Seriously fresh and delish! High points for really happy and competent waitstaff. I recommend this place and I plan on returning."}
{"text":"I've been to MTO Café twice. I must say that it has been a delightful experience on both occasions. The staff is very friendly and attentive. I always get the three stack pancakes.  AMAZING!  I love it there.  Definitely recommend it to others."}
{"text":"I'm glad a place like this has opened in Downtown area, loved the atmosphere and my quinoa dish was excellent! colorful and yummy. When I saw the servers passing by with other dishes I knew I had to try more from the menu, I guess vegan pancakes will be next, I'm definitely returning."}
{"text":"Wow!  So glad we found this place.  We came in for Sunday Brunch and were blown away. We had a mix of breakfast and lunch items.  Bread for patty melt is delicious and homemade tomatillo sauce was amazing.  Oh and pineapple/mint mimosas are the way to go.  Can't wait to come again.  Great location to the Smith Center if your looking for a brunch place before a matinee show."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite breakfast places!  The Chicken in a Waffle, and the Kentucky Fried Chicken!  Always so good, fresh, and worth the drive from south Vegas!  We come every week! S/O to Amber - she's always super friendly, and has great customer service :)"}
{"text":"Had the avocado skillet and MTO Juice. HANGOVER CURED! This place blends the familiar with the unexpected twist, which should please all. Chocolate chip cookies are almost like eating chocolate chip cookie dough. Me likey! Beautiful interior! Great staff! Easy walk from the golden nugget."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday for lunch. Pretty busy little place at lunch time with the downtown business crowd.  Anyhow, there food is solid but overpriced. Nothing exceptional but nothing bad that I have had either. I had the salmon burger yesterday. The shoestring french fries were good, I am pretty sure they are fresh and that was probably my favorite part.  The salmon burger itself, which was recommended by the waitress, was extremely dry. I was hesitant to try it as they stated it was not a piece of salmon . I surmised it was salmon flakes with filler aka what I would expect from the frozen section at any grocery store. So going back to the dry salmon patty, the salmon burger had cream cheese - which again I am not a big fan of but I think the cream cheese and the copious amounts of mayonnaise helped offset the dryness of the salmon patty.  The menu stated that the salmon burger had a balsamic aioli, however I could not taste that at all on the burger and there did not appear to be any balsamic dressing on the burger.  I did like the bread and butter chips on top of the burger (there were five held on top with a toothpick).  My total for the salmon burger & fries, with no drink including a $2 tip was $15. I just don't see going back for the price that they charge. 

I overhead another waiter saying that the hangover burger was great, and my friend who got the hangover burger liked it but I just can't justify paying $13 for a burger unless I was at BURGR or the like.  If I am going to get a hamburger and it's not high end then I am an In-N-Out girl because, hey, that's what a hamburger's all about... but I digress. 

I went to MTO once before, about six months ago, and remember getting the salmon wrap. Again I remember it being okay but nothing really noteworthy. I split it with a friend and it is definitely not big enough for splitting. 

As a side note, they serve beer for $5, there were some good choices Dogfish Head 60 - although they also had PBR, I question who would really pay $5 for PBR - although a friend pointed out he noted a resurgence of \"cheap\" beer as being trendy - I haven't noticed that but I pay more attention to micro brews and wine myself.  But MTO seems to attempt to appeal to a sense of nostalgia by referencing wonder bread and Velveeta amongst other items, so maybe that is their justification for $5 for PBR? Anyway, long story short - okay to try but don't get the salmon burger unless you are in the mood for a patty that has the moisture of the Sahara desert and expect to pay a premium for pretty much anything."}
{"text":"Great food in a modern comfortable setting out of the gaming areas by city hall. Wonderful friendly and attentive staff (that's you Rachel). And some Banksy like artwork!  
Good portions were excellent and was very fresh and tasty. 
Great job all around!"}
{"text":"Their pancakes are amazing!!!!  The hangover burger was great and the treehugger was interesting and delicious.  I love that they have a kids menu as well.  This is a great place to eat downtown."}
{"text":"This will sound pretentious but living near Chez Panisse has spoiled us so badly that our dining out expectations are necessarily very low when traveling. 
MTO is awesome and far exceeded our expectations! If you picked it up and dropped it into Gourmet Ghetto it would raise breakfast standards there, perhaps even rivaling Meal Ticket, the all-time best. 
Vegas clearly under-appreciates MTO as it was nearly empty when we came in at 11:20. By noon it filled up for lunch but given the quality and service I would expect a line. 
The service is friendly and relaxed and was flawless on our visit. 
We ordered both breakfast and lunch items and the food was outstanding. High quality ingredients expertly prepared. Not too much salt (the ubiquitous sin) and just the right balance of flavors. 
(Adding real maple syrup instead of or in addition to the artificial corn syrup people are used to is the only suggestion for improvement we could think of.)
The coffee is great. The Bloody Mary is modest, well-priced, delicious (but lacked even a celery stick- veggies suggested here - ok so two suggestions). 
Fresh juices would also be a welcome addition but lack of them doesn't bring down my rating. 
Great place! Definitely coming back and recommending to everyone we know."}
{"text":"Great spot for breakfast or lunch. Service was outstanding and the food was delicious. Everything seemed very fresh/local/etc."}
{"text":"2 stars for good food and okay service:  However, they deductions for the following:

* When the manager asked us how we heard about their restaurant (it's completely off the beaten path of the tourist visiting Las Vegas and the Strip), I told him it was through Restaurant.com.  I got the look of annoyance for using a gift certificate.  I just love it when businesses get annoyed at you as the customer for using a promotion that they are the ones that put out to the public.  \"Look!!  No one forced you to give a discount/promotion people!!\"  After that conversation, we never saw him again.

* We were told that we would have 2 hour validation in the parking structure attached to the restaurant.  Okay, cool...no need to rush, right??  Wrong!  Upon leaving the parking structure, we found it it was only 1 hour validated and we were over by 15 minutes.  Thus, we had to pay with those automated machines and they didn't accept our CC, but did accept DEBIT Card (contrary to what is stated on the machine itself).

* Weeks later, I received my credit card statement and noticed that MTO charged an additional $10.00 on my credit card.  I proceeded to contact my credit card company and disputed the charge.  Thank goodness for Discover!!  

It was only after this last bullet point did I decide I have to write this review.  After going completely out of our way on our return trip back to Los Angeles, to eat at a restaurant for a pathetic $5.00 discount to use and have this restaurant experience...Lesson learned:  never go out of the way again!!"}
{"text":"Breakfast Food was quite creative, but mediocre in quality at best. Beautiful layout and friendly staff/management.  Our personal experience would not compel a return visit. 

Do not use online coupons, as you will be disappointed. If you are driving to this location, be mindful of the parking (parking garage charges in half hour increments). Some of the \"vegan\" foods are questionably \"vegan\".  Make sure you ask ahead of time."}
{"text":"...waiter said there were no spoons; stirred my coffee with a butter knife. Also, didn't order the soup... because, you know, no spoons..."}
{"text":"came in  for  breakfast  with my family  of  four  on  Sunday the 17th  not  only  were  we  seated  promptly  but my  kids  loved  the etch- a- scetch  that  they got  to play  with while waiting  on food,  so much so  that they now  have that on  there xmas  lists.  food  was melt in your  mouth  good, I  got  the  chicken in  waffle  and a  side  of  sausage, my son  got  the  crustless pb&j,  my daughter  got Mickey mouse  pancakes,  and my boyfriend  got a  skillet!  our  table  was so quite after the food  showed  up  cause we were  too busy eating,  which  can be a  challenged  with kids sometimes  as all  parents  know  to well  :)service  was attentive  without  being  too  attentive, and super  friendly.  you  can tell  the staff  really  are  as happy to be there as  the customers.  this  quickly  has become  our  new found  Sunday spot!"}

{"text":"This place is super cozy, food is amazing. I had the mto breakfast and I loved it. Staff is nice and efficient.it can be a little crowded though. If you check in with yelp you get a free cookie, kudos for that. I will be back for sure"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a sandwich while holiday shopping. Was first time customer and the counter clerk suggested the turkey melt. Was supposed to be on sourdough bread but just looked like regular toast to me. Turkey was sliced very thin and just tasted like processed turkey you buy from Oscar Mayer or something. Topped with wafer this slice of tomato and ugh.... Shredded iceberg lettuce. What is this a Big Mac? Did not smell appetizing in the least. Someone brought it to my table, dropped it without so much as a word and took off. Three stars for this is generous I tell you. 

$17.40 for a not so good turkey sandwich and a coke. This includes a 15% tips that is put upon you when you pay, the option of tipping on the electronic screen. Why are we tipping order takers? Tipping is for people who the IRS takes taxes from in advance for estimated and expected tips. This is not the case with cashiers or cooks. Such is reserved for waiters and waitresses, taxi drivers, etc., who often receive below minimum wage pay and have to pay tax on anticipated tips whether they receive them or not."}
{"text":"Great service loved the turkey melt! Lacie and Hanna helped me out and were very friendly. Went to cream after, love the location and the atmosphere inside the restaurant!"}
{"text":"This place is great!! From the service to the food you can't go wrong!! The Hangover Burger was to die for. It was super juicy and the flavors were on point! The manager Chris made sure we were taken care of from the time we walked in to the time we left. I will definitely be coming back very soon!"}
{"text":"Such great food and service! The cup of coffee alone was wonderful. I highly recommend the BLTAE sandwich!"}
{"text":"Lemon Poppyseed Pancakes are probably the best breakfast dish I've ever had. OMG. Amazing! We also had the avocado eggs and apple rings. Didn't love the apple rings, but the concept was interesting."}
{"text":"Sitting at MTO right now & enjoying a simply wonderful breakfast/ brunch. Chicken & waffles are great as well as the avocado skillet. Customer service also great. Would definitely recommend this place if in the downtown area."}
{"text":"Last night we went to the MTO cafe in downtown Summerlin and sad to say that will be our only visit. The menu looks interesting on line and even sounds good but this was by far the blandest food I and my mom have ever had. It's as if the cook didn't realize you do need to use some sort of salt on the food to make it tasty.

My mom got the bob chicken sandwich and for 12 bucks they really need to rethink serving it on just regular old wheat bread. Mom said it was just \"okay\" but would not get it again IF we came back. 

I had the hangover burger which is supposed to be an 8 ounce triple angus burger with bacon,fried egg,cheddar cheese and special sauce. This burger lacked any flavor at all. It was smaller the the bun it was on,the bacon was over cooked ,the \"cheddar cheese\" not sure if it was on the burger or not.  The fried egg was cooked correctly but again someone needs to tell the cook salt and pepper are okay to add when cooking. In fact I wonder if the burger was even angus because it was bland and sad looking in color. At 14 bucks I expect much more.

I could have gone to McDonald's for the third of the price and had a better meal.

The young man working as cashier,server and general cleaning person for the place wasn't overly friendly but he wasn't rude either. He did however leave our food sit in the window while he wiped down the coke machine and the counters. 

I wouldn't recommend wasting your money here especially with the amount of restaurants in downtown Summerlin I am sure there are better options."}
{"text":"Great cafe in downtown Las Vegas. Loved everything I had on my first visit & already planning on when I can return. I had the green juice, the Chile omelette, & tried the fried apple rings. So good!!! And love that the food is all fresh, much of it direct from the farmers market downtown."}
{"text":"Losing a star after after my last brunch visit... 

I will begin by saying that I'm super jazzed that MTO is now open downtown and the food and servers are great. The Fat Elvis is delicious and the chefs/owners have a real commitment to creating excellent food 

But...now that business has picked up, service has slowed down.. An hour is way too long to turn food around and get it on the table. If the food is going to take that long, please PLEASE get some carafes of mimosas! It shouldn't be a battle to partake in the unlimited mimosa on a Sunday morning, especially if you're paying for it. Just some constructive criticism to ensure the service continues to match the quality of the cafe."}
{"text":"This is a really cool new place.  My wife, 4 yr old daughter along with two friends hit it up this morning after  charity walk at Fremont St.  We were seated immediately, brought our drinks and promptly ordered. 

All five of us ordered something different, and everything was fantastic. I had the Chili Omlette, it was great. Wife had Dunkin Pancakes (I think that is what they were called) and she enjoyed them. Our daughter ordered the Apple doughnuts and they were amazing! Can't recall what the friends ordered but they both had nice things to say.

It was a tad pricey ($75 for 4 plus child) but I will return.  The entire menu was loaded with stuff. I would like to try."}
{"text":"Reasonable prices and HUGE portions. Menu had something for everyone, even vegans, but wasn't overwhelming. Not the most convenient location, but your hangover will thank you. Plus they have bottomless mimosas..Nuff said"}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast. Does not have the same cookie-cutter menu of so many other breakfast places. If you are trying to decide between here and Egg And I ( the other breakfast place in the area with a high yelp rating) MTO is MUCH better. Better food, better service, better menu."}
{"text":"Such a great find! We were greeted and treated by staff as if we were visiting their home. The food was incredible. The avocado skillet had a house-made tomatillo sauce that is to die for! Everything is so fresh. Very cute ambience! Definitely our new favorite breakfast spot"}
{"text":"MTO in downtown Las Vegas has become my home away from home. What started as a convenient place to grab a quick bite for breakfast and lunch on business trips has transformed into a never-miss spot every time I'm in town.

Free WiFi that performs well and power outlets (with USB plugs too!) in every booth help me get work done while I enjoy a delicious meal. Rachel, Lisa and Ally have become the friendly faces I look forward to seeing during my trips. Always quick to smile and ensure my coffee cup is full, they treat everyone that comes through the daily rush with the same level of positive service.

I have not eaten anything I did not like. The food is freshly prepared with care, quality ingredients and looks great on your plate! I eat the Veggie Breakfast Quesadilla way too much, and the Lemon Cilantro Salad is my go-to lunch. Coffee is delicious, fries are crispy...you can't go wrong at this place!

Thanks guys for making a restaurant so much more than a place to eat!"}
{"text":"My mom: \"I like the feel of this place.\"
Me: \"What would you say 'the feel of this place' is?\"
My mom: \"I don't know how to describe it. Yuppie?\"

I brought my mom and bro-dizzle to MTO in their first foray of downtown Las Vegas and the place was hopping for a Sunday morning. We were greeted right away by the gentleman working the counter who turned out to be the proud papa of one of the co-owners. While perusing the menu in our quoted 5-10 minute wait, he suggested what to eat if we were \"really hungry,\" and what to order if we were \"just hungry.\" 

Among the 3 of us, we ordered the avocado breakfast as a skillet, though it was also available as a whole wheat wrap or omelette; the queso carne sandwich; and the bacon dippers. The avocado skillet had a green chili topping that gave it a kick so even though I asked for ketchup and hot sauce, it turned out I really didn't need too much of it, if at all. The queso carne was exactly like it sounded - lots of queso with lots of carne topped on fluffy slices of bread. The bacon dippers was a platter of Americana lovin' - carbs and bacon, married in one item - essentially strips of bacon right in the middle of pancake mix. The presentation wasn't as mind-blowing as the other two items, but the flavor was there. +1 for bacon lovers! 

The cafe is bright and a very modernized, contemporary step up from the usual diners throughout the city. There aren't any $3.99 steak and eggs, but there are $15 bottomless mimosas and bloody Marys! 

P.S. Check in on Yelp for a free order of walnut tossies - they were out when we went, but sent over an equally-winning mini apple pie! :)"}
{"text":"I've only had a few items here and they've all been really good. Only reason for not giving it 5 stars is that I don't think I've had enough of the menu to say everything is great. Have been with a few friends and they got lunch items and said it was good but nothing spectacular. 

I like the outdoor seating by the fountain too. Good ambience on a late morning weekend."}
{"text":"This was our first visit and we were impressed!  Chef Leland is amazing and prepared a delicious burger!  We will be coming back to our new favorite spot!"}
{"text":"This place was a great find. Amazing food, with generous servings. The staff were fantastic very attentive and made sure you were well looked after. Also in a good spot with only 10mins walk to Freemont street. The quality of food was heaps better than anywhere we had eaten on the strip. Highly reccommend the French Toast and BLTAE!"}

{"text":"My new breakfast go-to place! I was in the mood for breakfast and this place really hit the spot. Nice atmosphere, delicious food, decent service and return-worthy.  
I had the Bacon Pancake Dippers (pancakes with a slice of bacon cooked into the middle) and these were by far the best pancakes I've ever had a restaurant!!  I always criticize pancakes at restaurants because I don't understand why they can't make them the way I grew up eating them. MTO's pancakes are the closest to homemade that I've had at a restaurant -- my search is finally over, I'm in pancake heaven! .  The Mash Browns are a delightfully different approach to plain old hash browns.  They have a thin layer of mashed potatoes in between two layers of traditional hashed browns -- they exceeded my expectations; they were flavorful and the texture was just right.  
I will be back and I'm bringing reinforcements (the fam) next time! LOL"}

{"text":"On Feb 15. My husband and I went to MTO Cafe and ordered a pastry and a latte. 10 minutes later our pastry was brought to us hard and cooling because some parts were warm which told me it had been sitting too long. After seeing 7 other customers who came after us get their latter's over 20 minutes of waiting the guy brought my husband his latte. Don't get me wrong, the gentleman was very polite and the order taker was a sweet lady but the organization is as different as night and day between morning and afternoon. We've been to MTO Cafe a dozen times in the morning and the service has been friendly, organized, and fast. The 2 times we have gone around 4pm has been a perfect \"How Not To Run A Restaurant Cafe/Kitchen\" play book. Oh and incase you think I'm lying, my TICKET #25 @ 4:54pm."}

My 3 year old kept calling my green juice \"poop.\" So there's her review. Haha! My daughter got the kid pancakes, they were delish, and the fruit cup it came with was amazing. Strawberries, blackberries, blueberries, apples, and bananas. This place is worth going out of your way to visit. Just beware of the hours-open til 2 or 3."}
{"text":"Interesting retro vibe, friendly service, smooth  Lavazza coffee and delicious lemon poppyseed pancakes! We found this place by accident but will be back the next time we're in Vegas."}
{"text":"This place was really good!
I was so happy to find chicken \"in a waffle\" on the menu because its my favorite dish ever, but I went with the BLTA with egg and was not disappointed.  Large enough that I couldn't completely finish, but good enough that I did anyways! The french fries are thin and crispy and so good. The service was fast and attentive.  The owners (I'm assuming) came and spoke to us and were personable.  Next time I visit Vegas, I'm coming back here to try another dish, it was that tasty.  Further from the strip than I'd like because I'm lazy, but really is worth the cab ride if you're visiting or the drive if not.  
So Good!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant. Great food, great atmosphere, great price. I have tried almost every item on the menu and everything is great. You can eat healthy or decadent. I would highly recommend stopping by and trying this place out. If you are down on Fremont St. Walk down and have brunch."}
{"text":"First time here...got the Hangover burger and a Kool-Aid.  Food was great , service was even better ....even though I showed up 2 mins before they closed.  Gonna be a regular for sure!"}
{"text":"Price is steep for the give service. Food was ok, we ordered two of the MTO's breakfast which seed like spam and eggs. Not too happy with the service"}
{"text":"My friend and I stumbled upon this little treasure downtown on the way to the Life is Beautiful festival. Our server Mike was very friendly and accommodating to us. He split our omelet onto two plates with great presentation. The restaurant itself is clean and the décor is very modern with fun music playing. 

We stopped by the next day to grab a coffee to go and again the service was great and the coffee delicious.  Will definitely be back to try out their brunch with bottomless mimosas!"}
{"text":"I usually come here for lunch so it's nice to check out breakfast for a change. The chicken in a waffle is my favorite breakfast item."}
{"text":"Great little spot.  The food is good and most of the staff is very friendly.  The scrambles salmon wrap was delicious and their pancakes are pretty good as well.  Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Such a great experience we had here for breakfast. I was so tired of casino food and the Fremont area and needed a solid (hungover) meal. This hit the spot!! Ate here 3 days in a row and loved everything about it."}
{"text":"MTO was amazing! Had a wonderful first experience. The food concept is unique and service staff is extremely friendly. Food that is a must try are the apple donuts and fat elvis! You can't go wrong with those! 

Jeana Legarda"}
{"text":"Slow service.  I got my wrong order. Our bottomless mimosas were soo slow. Though I have to say the food was good."}
{"text":"Wow. This is exactly what I want for brunch-- fresh, delicious options. We both had the skillet breakfast, which consists of eggs scrambled with your choice of vegetables, served over crunchy hash browns. Wow! Add bottomless mimosas and call it vacation. Get off the strip and eat downtown!"}
{"text":"The apple fritters and green juice were delicious, but clearly overpriced! And their coffee tasted burnt and the staff was unfriendly! I wouldn't recommend this place. Can't believe I had to park in a parking lot to be able to come here!"}
{"text":"Had a great experience here. staff was friendly and place was clean. Food was good for a cafe. MTO Fried Chicken Steaks special was good. Claim chowder was okay-won't order chowder again.  MTO Donuts was good but little pricey but it's good when it's nice & hot.  I would commend this place if you are looking for a nice sit down cafe."}
{"text":"We ordered the Hangover and Fat Elvis.  First off I am picky on my burgers I usually get the burgers with sauces on the side.  I think mustered mutes the flavors of a good burger.  Everything on the Hangover was excellent.  From the bread to the Fried Egg on top.  I loved how the egg yolk just buttered that burger just perfectly.  The sauce added to the flavor and def. didn't take away from it.  The bacon was perfect.  Not like soggy or overly cooked that you would get from a normal restaurant.  The Fat Elvis was rich and I bet it could keep somebody going all day.  We didn't realize till we ate all of it that it came with a side of syrup and you know we didn't miss it at all.  Thought it came with french fries but I am glad it didn't.  The strawberries that came on top and the side were perfect with it.  Next time we will try it with the syrup on it.  Again the bacon was perfect.  The french toast bread is what I remember my grandma making me when I stayed at her house on the weekends.  I have friends that are vegetarians and vegans so it is nice that this place seems to cater to both the meat eater as well as the health conscience.  They found new regulars with us."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved it !  With all the busy and crowded buffet breakfasts, this is a hidden gem downtown . If your searching for a farm to table more healthy experience then this is it . The big open front windows and cool vibes lend itself well to the whole relaxing experience . For those of you who need computer stations , the booths have usb and charging plugs . They also have wifi.  I pray for the success and best wishes of establishments like these ."}
{"text":"Chicken and waffles one of the best service not the best, the fried chicken the best, not crowded for Saturday"}
{"text":"I usually get their turkey burgers here -  the food is ok but my rating is really about their service.   I was here last Wednesday - part of the lunch crowd.  The place was busy.  It took awhile to get seated - and then it took a long time just to get water and order!  I also noticed that other tables were waiting a long time to get their orders.  We would've left but had to get back to work - there was no time to find something else.  Once our order was placed,  about 30 minutes passed.  I had to get up and ask the person at the front counter what the status was.  She said another 10 minutes.  After 10 minutes passed, I flagged the waiter down - he literally had to stand by the cooks to ensure my dish was done.  Keep in mind, this place is small - so, it's not like they're going from one end of the restaurant to another - it's easy to see who's not being served.  We received a discount for the inconvenience (they subtracted a drink from our order) but even with this, I won't be going back!  If I could give them a negative rating, I would."}
{"text":"I'm glad we chose MTO Cafe for our first breakfast of 2014.  I ordered the MTO breakfast that was truly amazing.  My friend had the Fat Elvis french toast sandwich that also turned out to be fantastic.  Friendly staff, great food and supercool Banksy art on the walls make this a must visit if your downtown!"}
{"text":"Yes! Must go! We had our best meal here at MTO on our recent anniversary trip to Vegas. Donna was one of THE BEST servers we have ever had! She made the meal. And of course the food was outstanding. We even got a sandwich to go for our drive home. We happened to be there on MTOs first anniversary...I sincerely wish this establishment all the best!"}
{"text":"The food and the staff were incredible.  Our server was very attentive, the host was also very friendly. The food was the best I've had in a while..my girlfriend had the BLTE and she fell in love with it. I had the hangover burger and it was just amazing.  Definitely coming back with my friends next time around. Must go!!"}
{"text":"Promptly seated and served by an engaged Wait Staff. High marks.

Ordered the Hen House Wrap w/side order of fries. A moment of humor, when the person who took my order asked if I wanted the wrap as an omelet or a wrap. Hey, it was busy, and he was trying hard.

The wrap was good. It would have been better, if it had more chicken. There wasn't much chicken on a wrap that sells for $14. There was supposed to be a sliced tomato according to the person who took my order, but sadly, not.

I chalk up the \"problems\" as start-up-iris. I'm certain things will be better soon."}
{"text":"Had the Bob sandwich and a fresh mango mint lemonade. Service was great and food tasted fresh!"}
{"text":"Yummy comfort food. The deconstructed chicken pot pie is awesome, wonderful gravy that soaks into the biscuits. The grilled brie cheese sandwhich is creative and perfect for a sweet tooth. 

Only downside is parking sucks."}
{"text":"Awesome brunch! Got the veggie scramble in a skillet (which was amazing) and the lemon poppy seed pancakes with blueberry and ginger compote (also amazing). They have green juices too. Great, friendly service. Would definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"My second visit to MTO Cafe and I loved it! Service is great! I met the owner Ben who came up and introduced himself which I thought was awesome to see the brain behind it all! Didn't meet his business partner but hopefully next time. My server was Jennie and she recommended chicken and waffles which I must say was very delicious.  Thanks all and see you guys again soon. I live downtown area so it's nice to know there are places like this around -- gotta check it out and try out the mac n cheese as well! Amazing!"}
{"text":"Went here with some friends for a birthday brunch.  The location is right by the Las Vegas City Hall and presumably provides dining options in a specific portion of downtown that otherwise lacks options.  The restaurant validates parking for patrons.  The decor is very urban, concrete jungle with industrial looking tables and high ceilings.  The place has a very modern but friendly feel and offers plenty of seating with a properly proportioned dining room.

Service was very good and the waiter made sure those of the patrons partaking in the bottomless mimosas had refills when needed.  I had the MTO signature breakfast which consisted of turkey bacon, spam, sausage, eggs, mash browns and toast.  This was a tasty combination and I'm not a big spam fan from prior experience.  Another member of our group had a chicken wrap which was fresh, and appropriately portioned.  The french fries were shoe string or thin fries and were very good.  The pricing was not bottom basement denny's level but was fair.

This is a great place to go for breakfast, lunch or brunch.  If you hate hipsters and cop an attitude about any place giving a hipster vibe, you should probably go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Great food. 
One of our friends wanted to down a pitcher of mimosas. 
\"Well I'm not sure that's legal, but here's two cups.\""}
{"text":"Food was amazing and great outstanding service from all the team. General Manager really attentive. 
Definitely coming back!!!"}
{"text":"We've dined at MTO a few times. Love the KFC and the green juice is a must. The staff were friendly and helpful, thanks for brightening our day Lacie."}
{"text":"FANTASTIC!!!! Food and service was the best. Wait staff had no problem making a recommendation, and a good one at that!!! 

I had the KFC breakfast, tender breaded chicken strips on top of hash browns, covered in gravy and topped with eggs cooked to order. It was amazing. finished with fried apples and homemade doughnuts. Very delicious!!!

If you are in the downtown area don't miss out on this fabulous little spot!"}
{"text":"The food was very good, fresh ingredients great flavors and presentation. The reason for 3 stars instead of 5 was first and foremost the restaurant manager was extremely rude to us. We had a party of 4 only 2 of us were there and she refused to seat us she stated she couldn't waste a four top on us if the other 2 didn't show up which we understood but she didn't have to be so rude about it, we had a few other friends there who had an extra seat so we asked to combine an empty 2 top with their table and we would make it work she scoffed and rolled her eyes and hesitantly did it. At the end of our meal we also overheard her asking the table next to us who had just cashed out to basically hurry up and leave because she needed to turnover the table smh. The service overall was ok a little slow they were pretty busy but all the severs were nice so it made up for it. The only other thing is the parking situation we didn't mind paying but I didn't realize till later they validated you would think out of courtesy they might mention that as they dropped the check since most people who go there park in the garage."}
{"text":"Super-friendly staff and great food. Had the veggie hash, really enjoyed it. Will come back!"}
{"text":"Great food, incredible service and a warm friendly atmosphere make this cafe an excellent spot for breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"The good was delicious especially the mashed browns. The service was excellent!   What lovely people.  ."}
{"text":"The food was ok, nothing special. The portions were small, we had to go some place else and get snacks because we were still hungry. The food was way over priced, $13 for one waffle and flavorless fruit was ridiculous. I wouldn't go back. The only saving feature was that the atmosphere was nice."}
{"text":"This review is for their Cappuccinos and Lattes 
The staff was friendly and the service was great, but their espresso drinks were extremely watered-down!!!!"}
{"text":"Worth the walk from the Freemont Street casinos for breakfast.  Tasty, unique and large portions.   The service was prompt and friendly too.   Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"The turkey melt and the avocado skillet are my favorites here. The wait is a little long even when it seems no one else is there eating, but the food is always fresh and filling. A little expensive, but worth it in a pinch. Staff members are always wiping down tables and offering to take empty plates, and always greet me when I walk in the door. They have one of those cool Coke machines where you pick exactly what you want, too. Added bonus because I love me some Cherry Vanilla Coke."}
{"text":"My whole group enjoyed everything we had! All of it was so fresh. We walked right in on a Sunday morning with no wait!!! That's nice considering everywhere else on the strip or down town is a long wait on a Sunday. Every employee we encountered was smiling and seemed to enjoy their job. The place is very clean and modern looking. I think the prices are very fair. Will definitely come here again. Looked at the lunch menu and decided I need to try it for lunch some time. Just a side note- I ordered the lemon poppyseed pancakes and couldn't even finish one. They give you 3!"}
{"text":"Service was very friendly and attentive. We had a Caesar salad that was oddly untossed, and thus rather annoying to eat.... Like salad with a side dip, which is a shame as the dressing supposedly was home made. 

We also enjoyed a vegetarian scramble, which by itself was rather bland, but otherwise we'll executed. Add some herbs, basil, thyme, something... We retorted to drowsing it in hot sauce. For some odd reason thisplace does T have fresh ground pepper. Odd. 

The coconut carrot pancake was delicious, really tasty.

We'll be back but will never order a salad again."}
{"text":"Don't sleep on the tomato basil soup!!! I've never had soup like this before. I left MTO about an hour ago and I keep thinking, \"That soup!!!\" Seriously, best soup ever!!! And it comes with a giant piece is sourdough and cheddar!

Also, the owner and staff were very friendly and the atmosphere was fun!"}
{"text":"Here we go, breakfast with two kids... Not always an easy task so we have to make sure to scout it out beforehand. Easy parking, check. No stroller needed, phew. However, I am sure it would be more than welcome. Kid menu, check. In fact, it's super cute! While most parents pull out the iPhone or iPad during a meal, MTO Cafe offers up a fresh alternative - an etch-a-sketch, love it! Kid-friendly, check. Not only is the menu important, but so is the atmosphere. Overall family approval, five stars. 
Not only is it kid-friendly, but I will most certainly check-in and hook up in between downtown meetings. With individual charging stations at each booth, free Wifi and a fun, inspiring ambiance you will find me here, hooked up on a regular basis. 
Parking and location is a breeze, located just below a public parking garage so it couldn't get much easier. I am sure that the landscape will change during the week - business people and those looking for a to-go option. 
One thing I LOVE - the outdoor dining, one thing that Vegas is missing. For this alone, I will return.
The food was AMAZING! Honestly, I am not a huge comfort food gal so I went with the avocado omelet and am so glad that I did. However, I found myself devouring the mash potato, stuffed hash browns... a must! Chef has perfected the french onion soup according to my husband (he was french trained we later learned, so why not give it a try). The littles appreciated the smiley face ketchup that accompanied the grilled cheese and baby boy loved the vegan coconut, carrot pancake - even though he can't talk, I'm pretty sure that lack of anything left is a sure sign. 
With the restaurant just opening there were a couple things not available so we will be sure to visit in the coming weeks to give those a try as well. Until then..."}
{"text":"Awesome option to come grab a bite after a True Fusion workout. I ordered the Body Builder omelette (because I'm a body builder obviously) and it was delicious. My girlfriend tried the Yoga Pants omelette and also really enjoyed her dish. Her only complaint was that there was more cheese than she was expecting on her eggs. 
Pro tip: try the \"skillet style.\" The eggs will be served in a hot skillet and you'll find some hash browns underneath!"}
{"text":"Have been to MTO Cafe at Downtown Summerlin a few times now. 

Sometimes it was good (the clam chowder) and sometimes not so much. About one week ago I decided to try the Chicken Pot Pie as it's one of their signature dishes and I had seen the reviews on Yelp. 

This dish was a deal breaker in that I won't be returning to this place ever again. 

Presentation is cute, comes in a little skillet with biscuits. The chicken was flavorless and tough. I had to add a ton of salt just to have some sort of seasoning. The biscuits were so hard I had to use a knife to cut through them (think hockey puck) and then the taste was like cardboard (think cardboard). As I'm trying to navigate some flavor out of this dish, I happen upon a chicken bone, and I mean a large bone. 

The waitress comes over, asks how the meal is, so I point to the bone and tell her (nicely) I don't think I would order this again and give her the particulars as stated earlier. She was nice and apologetic but nothing more. No manager was asked to come, she just trotted off like, \"oh well, thanks for coming in\", and left me. 

So here I am staring down at my chicken bone, served with dried out hockey puck biscuits covering a tasteless goo of tough chicken and wondering, why I was paying $15 for this meal?

There are waaay to many options in this town to get great food so I'll be checking MTO off my list as one."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Vegas. Kentucky Fried Chicken with the mash browns was off the charts.  Don't miss this place!"}
{"text":"I been here multiple times today I went for breakfast with my family we always used to have breakfast here even when they about to shout out this pleace for health department:( but today I have stomach sick and worst experience ever so sad I never going back again"}
{"text":"Love this place! Everything is always on point and delicious. Always cater My crazy request.  My daughter loves it too! The French fries and red velvet pancakes are her favorite. Mine is the MTO breakfast which I make lighter with subbing egg whites and ham for spam. Always perfect."}
{"text":"Met a friend for lunch here on a Saturday. We arrived at 11:35am, ordered our food, and found a table outside. They were busy- but didn't seem like anything crazy. Tables were filled, but no line to order. We waited over 50 minutes for our food to come. Then only MY order came out- not my friends. My friend was told hers was coming several times before someone came over and asked her what she ordered- at which point she canceled her order. It was ridiculous. There was a family of 5 sitting near us who also had to cancel their order after waiting just as long without food. Not one person who worked there offered a pastry, anything from the bakery cabinet while several customers (kids included) were hungry and waiting. My friend did ask for some fries- and cold ones were brought to her. The staff did apologize for the mess and even had to close the kitchen- turning away several customers (we witnessed this). Very poorly run. I've never seen anything like it. When they did bring my meal out- no silverware or napkins were brought to accompany it. We had to ask after 10 minutes. I love MTO(the one downtown)  and was utterly disappointed at the Summerlin location."}
{"text":"I stopped by this cafe for the first time this weekend for a good cup of coffee.   I had to stand on line that was out the door for a long time as there was only ONE person to take orders, work the ccash computer and serve people coffee and small items.   I got a small plain watered down cup of coffee from a hand pump caraf and was charged $3.25 for the bad coffee and bad experience.  Very disappointing and certainly no desire to ever return."}
{"text":"Awesome service! Food was surprisingly really good for a small Cafe. The lady with the strong funny accent at the counter was really helpful with some menu selections."}
{"text":"thats how they define bacon and midden well steak! Come and eat! And you will never want to eat the second time!
Sooooooooooo bad!!!!"}
{"text":"There's a problem here with ownership/management. The girl at the front counter at Downtown Summerlin does not like her job. She was rude and unfriendly and acted as though we were bothering her. Last visit for me. To be fair, the coffee was good."}
{"text":"The grilled cheese was to die for.  I ordered a side of fries. Only wished I wasn't working because a glass is of Chardonnay would have been perfection with the grilled cheese."}
{"text":"The moment we walked in we were greated with a smile by the hostess and welcomed us to MTO. We were promptly sat and our server Kerry was very knowledgeable of the menu and taking her time introducing the popular food items.  The items we chose were the melt and KFC, both were delish and the coffee was exceptional. Great job MTO for putting focus on service and quality to a great product. Will deff be back :)

We're big supporters of small local businesses and want to make sure they succeed and create jobs for our local economy. ...and to those negative Nancy's out there, \" if you dont have nothing nice to say dont say anything at all \" your parents should have taught you that. Be courteous and talk to someone when you have a bad experience as opposed to bashing them via social media and give them the opportunity to address the issues.

P.s...apple rings are the bomb.com"}
{"text":"Bottomless mimosas for $15...and they are nice and strong! Bacon pancake dippers did not disappoint.    I'll definitely return.

The only downside is you pay for parking .  $3 for the day and MTO validates for 1/2 of the charge."}
{"text":"Arrived for wedding and happen to find this local gem.  Well off the strip and reasonable prices for excellent food if your looking for a break from the crazy food cost in the tourist areas.  Breakfast is when we went and lunch is served in the AM as well, Ruben is amazing.  Have been twice in 3 days and may go again."}
{"text":"Great customer service and delicious food! Need I say more!? It 12 and I love the girl at the registers and the Asian girl services! Omg, they are so sweet and attentive! I love coming here!"}
{"text":"I would compare this to Rachael's kitchen, if you're a Las Vegan. Its made to order, healthier than usual foods. You order & they bring it to you. Not a wait staff but more like upscale fast food. Its nice if you like that sort of thing. I eat VERY clean and strictly and they were able to accommodate that. Food was ok. Nothing that would make me crave it."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting here, and after reading tons of reviews of great this place was I was very excited to give this place a go.

The service itself was good, very personable staff, and someone who seemed like one of the owners or managers walked around and continually checked on all the diners. Something I really enjoy when I go out to eat. They were attentive making sure our water was refilled regularly, and we were finding everything ok.

My girlfriend and I ordered the \"Fat Elvis ($13)\" \"Triple Stack ($10)\" \"MTO Breakfast ($14)\" and a soy latte on the side. 

Based on appearance the Fat Elvis looked the best like something you would expect to see, triple stack looked like your basic stack of pancakes, and the MTO Breakfast a larger version of the Grand Slam from Dennys.

I personally had the Fat Elvis, and it was great, bacon, bananas, nutella, peanut butter, sandwiched between french toast, and topped with fresh strawberries and powdered sugar, what is not to love. As far as the price goes though, I felt it was high for what you got, just that and no sides, which is the only reason we also got the MTO Breakfast to share.

The MTO Breakfast comes with three eggs any style, chicken sausage, turkey bacon, spam and bacon, choice of wheat, Wonder Bread, rye or sourdough, mash browns. Plated looked nothing like the site had advertised, didn't look very exciting to be honest. As far as taste it was just how it looked not exciting, and for the price not worth it at all. The turkey bacon definitely could have been cooked longer, chicken sausage was dry, ordered our eggs over medium and 1 of the yolks had already been busted before hitting our table. Not sure if we had to ask for our bread to be buttered but no butter, just the jam, and the spam were 2 different size cuts, one was more like a thin crispy spam chip, while the other was normal. The bacon was the best part about the dish.

The pancakes from what my girlfriend had to say was once again nothing special, and yet again for the price wasn't worth it. Could have went to iHop for the same thing.

I know I talked a lot about price, but I'm the type who doesn't mind spending money on food as long as it is worth it, and it wasn't worth it.

Maybe if we went with the other more popular dishes such as the Kentucky Fried Chicken, The Hangover Burger, or The Chicken in a Waffle. Our review would have came out different, but everything on the menu should taste delicious no matter how basic the meal is especially for how much they charge.

So, based on my first experience I doubt I would return if it was my choice. But if I do I will be sure to make a follow up review."}
{"text":"This place has become one of our weekend favorites! I love walking into a restaurant where the staff remembers your name and what you like to eat. Huge points in my book. On the contrary of other reviews I think this place is priced great. You almost have to try to spend more than $12 per plate. I always have a bowl of fresh fruit, salad, and the Avocado which has amazing flavors nothing is too overpowering. Their bottomless mimosa is always a must for weekend  brunch. Love this place! Oh and they comp your parking stub!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I moved to Vegas 2.5 months ago, and discovered MTO Café quickly upon our arrival. Nestled in the beautiful Downtown Summerlin, we were thrilled to find this delicious restaurant/take-out style café where you don't have to wait for table service, yet get to sit back and enjoy an awesome (comfort) meal.

My fiancé raves about the BLTAE (Bacon Lettuce Tomato Avocado Egg) Sandwich. It's a huge portion with a heaping side of fries and well worth it's price tag. That alone lures him back twice a month (at least).

I, myself, first indulged in the Strawberry and Spinach Salad with Gorgonzola and a Balsamic dressing. That was delicious. Next I tried the Turkey Melt, and melt in my mouth, it did. So many awesome flavors in one bite - I don't know how they do it. Everything from the dressings to the toasting of the bread is perfectly mouthwatering. 

I've also tried The Bob, which was fantastic. Sometimes they include these roasted cherry tomatoes, which are difficult to chew, but taste fantastic. 

As for the service, we are always always greeted with a super friendly clerk who takes the order, delivers the food, and clears the table. They are even friendly enough to make suggestions on the menu and wait patiently while I indecisively try to order. We've never gone at a time where there's a line or crowd, so I suppose dinner isn't their busiest hour. Nevertheless, we always leave stuffed and so satisfied at the delicious crafting of foods here.

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The BLTAE was amazing and super filling. The service was great and attentive. However, the mimosa's were practically orange juice, next time will settle with just juice."}
{"text":"Cool vibe, great breakfast! Get it skillet style, with the eggs over hash browns, and don't miss the tomatillo salsa!"}
{"text":"Our first time here for breakfast & unfortunately we were very disappointed with the insipid foods. I had the poppyseed pancakes, which was very dry. My hubby ordered the fried chicken and smashed potato hash brown that was very bland. The only compliment I have is on their fresh & well-brewed coffee.  The Orange creamicle smoothie was overly priced at $8.00 for 16-oz serving size!"}
{"text":"Took a short walk over from Golden Nugget for breakfast with friend. Breakfast, coffee excellent. Staff were super friendly and attentive on a busy Sunday morning. I had the blueberry lemon pancakes, light and perfect. Would recommend for breakfast and lunch."}
{"text":"Great food, big portions, great service, great atmosphere.  The food was made to order. Very clean. Definately will come back"}
{"text":"We trusted y'all yelpers, and you did not let us down!!!!


Poppyseed pancakes the best pancakes EVER!!!!

The MASHBROWNS!!!! GOTTA HAVE THE MASHBROWNS!!!"}
{"text":"This place was cozy and had such a relaxing vibe to it. Great mixture of music was playing the whole time we were there. Their mimosas were on point. It was a little crowded so we understood the wait time for food, but man oh man when they served our food...it was delicious so fresh and hot! The hangover burger was amazing, definitely going back for another soon! Our waitress was awesome Allyson, did an amazing job. She accommodated some of orders without making it seemed like an inconvenience. Definitely going again and soon. Thank you guys for such lovely service."}
{"text":"Best omelette ever! I had the broccoli egg white omelette and it didn't disappoint. It was tasty, satisfying and didn't leave me feeling miserably full afterwards.  The staff was friendly and attentive and place was nice and clean. I' ll definitely make this my new vegas breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"First time here and the food was amazing. I came in for lunch and had a hard time ordering because of the options. They serve breakfast for lunch. I almost pulled the trigger and ordered breakfast, but I had to go back to work and I didn't want to be in a food coma. So, I opted for the turkey melt. It was so good!!! The good food came with great service (thank you Lisa)!  Great spot for breakfast or lunch, but she told me they close at 2:00. I'm coming back for sure."}
{"text":"My wife and I are retired and eat out often. This is our third trip here to MTO Summerlin. The location is great, the place is clean, the service is good, the food is good and the price is right. This place has made it to our list of favorite places to eat and hang out here in Las Vegas. It caters to folks of all ages and serves an interesting variety comfort food, including some killer breakfasts."}
{"text":"The Hangover Burger was godly! I went to edc with some friends a few years ago, and I was craving food and this was the only place nearby our hotel that I found on yelp. The fact that it was called an \"hangover burger\" was a sign to come and I'm so glad I did, it really did help recover from my hangover! I even walked a mile to come to this place, best decision ever!"}
{"text":"The MTO Cafe was a great find close to Fremont Street. We loved the vibe of the space and team working for breakfast on a Saturday morning. The veggie hash had a great medley of vegetables with a delicious savory burst of roasted tomato. The Kentucky Fried Chicken was crisp on the outside and juicy on the inside with a rich, tasty gravy and potatoes. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"You have to try the BLTAE when you come here! It is a big sandwich that is packed with flavor. They load the sandwich with crispy bacon strips, basil pesto that gives it a creamy contrast to the crunchy bread, and a runny yolk that just tops it off."}
{"text":"Dont waste your time. Party of 3 on 6/1/2014 1030am. Parking $2.25 the payment machine was BROKEN dont STRESS the exit pay machine also takes credit cards. The only reason this is a 2 star and not a 1 is due to the fact that the front desk hostess young girl was on point. 
* AVOCADO Omelet - TERRIBLE! Why? The Avocados hard as a rock. The Asian male Supervisor stopped by our table asked hows the food? I said taste the rock hard avocado.  He said no thanks are you finished? As he laughed and smiled. My Thai wife was stunned. 
* Tap Water is nasty - Chlorine - Asked for 1 water for some reason 2 waters arrived at our table. Hey LAKE MEAD is almost empty slow down on the water wasting MTO waitress. 
* Chicken and Waffles - nothing special. Best thing on the plate? Fries!  
Here comes the bill aka check... Strange the 4 inch $ 11.00 AVOCADO Omelet still on the bill. I was stunned it wasnt removed by the Supervisor...I didnt want to wait for them to go thru the drama of removing the item so I just left a note on the TIP LINE.... SEE YELP!
My wife was crushed she was hoping this place was going to be dreamy. Not a Kitchen Nightmare....  We will never go back...Waste of  time and money.  Parking drama... I approve this message J K KUHL..."}
{"text":"It was my first time trying a brunch cafe here in my own city and the experience was great! The food is absolutely amazing, and who can resist bottomless mimosas? The servers were extremely friendly and even took the time to entertain us and joke around. Overall an amazing time spent here at MTO cafe. Oh I was also offered a commentary powdered sugar donut since the yelp check in item was unavailable at the time. Upgraded from a cookie to a doughnut, perfect!! Haha"}
{"text":"Sheralynn is the best! She possibly outshined the food (which was amazing). I'm not a big table service person, but she kept us happy!"}
{"text":"Yummy breakfast everything on the menu looked great had a hard time deciding what to have. Will be back again next time in Vegas."}
{"text":"From the outside, MTO Café looks like another of those hipster hangouts that have invaded Las Vegas. But not all hipsters are horrible, nor are the hangouts they call home. Case in point, this bright and welcome addition to the downtown dining scene. 

The restaurant itself is pretty small, and there's a relatively limited menu. But the portions are big, and you can choose from such café favorites as burgers, salads, sandwiches, and breakfast items. It looked like their breakfast items are popular, because I saw lots of pancakes and waffles passing by. But I was there for lunch. 

I chose the BLT chopped salad ($9) and added half an avocado for $1. It was like a deconstructed wedge salad, with cherry tomatoes and ranch dressing. And that's a good thing! The bacon was crisp and delicious, and although I'm not a big fan of tomatoes, they gave the salad the right amount of pop. (You can also add chicken for an additional charge, but I was fine with my avocado.)

My only gripe is that I ordered iced tea, and it looks like the only choice is passion fruit, because I wasn't offered an option and that's what I got. Next time, I'll skip the $3 glass of liquid potpourri and stick with water.

My server was great--super friendly and attentive without being intrusive. And the food was fresh, fast, and filling. Overall, I'd say MTO is pretty GR8."}
{"text":"We are here at least twice a week. Kid friendly and all the girls are super nice and patient with my little one (and his never ending requests for more orange slices). Have never had a bad experience and hope it stays that way. Food comes out fast and always as we ordered it. Favorites include the avocado skillet and the falafel wrap. Always steady but quiet. This is my go-to for a quick weekday dinner when I'm not in the mood to cook! Hope you guys are here forever!"}
{"text":"This was our first time venturing to downtown Summerlin. This cafe was excellent. Service was friendly and attentive. Food was delicious. They serve the breakfast items all day. Decent kids menu. Options of menu choices were fair in terms of number of different items, but what they do make was delicious. Lots of choices from the fancy soda fountain. I liked that there were non-carbonated items for the kids too. Ambience is contemporary and modern. Overall, we had a great experience and plan to return in the future."}
{"text":"We decided to try a new restaurant off the Vegas strip on our last Vegas trip.  

We tried the \"Kentucky Fried Chicken\" and grilled cheese for brunch.  We really liked the fried chicken with hash mash and topped with two eggs.  The chicken was really juicy and cooked perfectly.  Everything went well together.  The grilled cheese with brie and honey was also really good.  We got the fries with the grilled cheese and we couldn't stop eating them because they were sooooooo good.  We also tried the green juice which I thought was okay, just a tad pricey for a small glass.  We finished our brunch with the mini donuts and honey which were seved warm and really delicious. 

Amazing food experience at MTO Cafe, we'll definitely be back next time we're in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Had brunch here on Sunday- great food,
Great service and great atmosphere. I met 2 friends and everything we had to eat was tasty.  One of the owners, Ben, came by to make sure everything was ok- a nice touch.   I'm looking forward to dining there again soon."}
{"text":"It's only fitting that my 100th review is for a place that I'll probably never forget going to.  My buddies and I were on a guy's trip to Vegas and we were staying on Fremont Street.  We were struggling out of bed looking forward to a low key day after hitting it hard the night before so we took a walk over to MTO Cafe for breakfast.  It seems like it's in the middle of nowhere but when we got there the place was pretty full.  Luckily the bar was empty so the 7 of us took over and lined up the entire bar.  That's when we noticed the deal...  $15 for all you can drink Mimosas and Bloody Marys.  Done and Done!

So we turned our low key day into a challenge to make our $15 worth its while and I would argue that we accomplished our goal.  In the meantime, I ordered an avocado omelet which blew my mind.  

At one point during the meal, one of my friends challenged my other friend to chug a pitcher of mimosa for $40.  He accepted thinking the restaurant would never let him do it.  So the bartender went to ask the manager and his response was \"well I don't think it's legal to give him a pitcher, but we could serve it in 2-20oz glasses\".  Challenge accepted! My friend made it through one and a half glasses and won $20.  We proceeded to stay well past our welcome drinking more Mimosas and Bloody Marys and they somehow put up with us with a smile on their faces the entire time.  I would happily come back here the next time I'm in Vegas, which probably won't be too far away."}
{"text":"I love this place! At first we thought it was closed because the construction outside, but we called to confirm it was open. 

Very cute and quaint little spot across from the Clark County courthouse. It's very hip and modern offering healthy dishes such as fresh pressed juices and vegan options. 

I ordered the Pancake Dippers with peppercorn syrup (Yum!) I loved every bite. The bacon was a little tough to cut, but it's expected with a butter knife. 

My boyfriend ordered the Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) and it was phenomenal! I kept eating off of his plate! The chicken with the mashbrowns are a deadly combo. Yum. Yum. Yum. 

Because we checked in on Yelp we received a free chocolate chip cookies & it was warm, soft, and heavenly. 

It's a bit off of Freemont, but worth the 7 minute walk. I loved it. Highly recommend. 

Our server Ryan was very kind and informative. All the staff were pleasant."}
{"text":"Horrible service, avoid if able. My significant other and I were part of a group of 9 everyone else got their food and ours was not made. After 2 times of asking about the food I was told it was not, they did not even know what we ordered, the food was then rushed, the table was done eating, the manager was rude and we were given free burnt cinammon rolls from another mans order!! Disgusted"}
{"text":"So I'm visiting from LA and was looking for an all day brunch spot. THIS. IS. IT. The food was delicious, came out fast, service was good and most of all everywhere I turned I saw someone working hard. You can tell the employees take pride in working here and providing the utmost care to their guests and in the food they serve. Oh! And the music...bangin!"}
{"text":"This cafe is pretty small and right on the outskirts of the strip.  I showed up on a Friday around 11AM and I was able to be seated immediately, but I could see there being a big wait on the weekend due to how small the space is!

I loved that the menu had both indulgent breakfast options and options that were on the healthier side.  I went with the avocado skillet and it was delicious! The flavors hit the spot.  If you're a big eater, you might want to consider something larger.  

Also, great service.  This is Vegas after all and we were very dehydrated.  Our waiter kept our waters full which was awesome and very much appreciated.  I would definitely check out this place again.  It's a nice break from the casinos and strip-hype."}
{"text":"Food was good but very overpriced $12 omlette, come on really avacacado omlette had a forth of an avacacado.. and no side wow..  service was good everyone happy and attentive.. soda gouging too. Three dollars or so for a coke.."}
{"text":"Glad to get away from all the mega casino hotels for a few minutes. Good comfort breakfast. Relaxing, good service. I imagine they get jumping for lunch because there are several government buildings nearby. Wife's cappuchino was delicious and we both had huevos rancheros, excellent. If we get back to Las Vegas we'll make a point to come back."}
{"text":"Comfortable place for breakfast, walking distance from Fremont Street.  Great pancakes :)."}
{"text":"I absolutely love MTO Cafe.  Their food is healthy, fresh and yummy.  I highly recommend it.  David the manager is especially awesome.  He always welcomes me and makes sure my dining experience is great.   I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My family and I were pretty excited to try this place after reading all the reviews. My family went to the outlet mall nearby and I decided to do a nice little 10k run to meet them for brunch (like the brunch running clubs springing up across the U.S.A, but solo). After running from our hotel down the Las Vegas Strip, I arrived ready to enjoy some delicious food. 

Walked in to find out they had seating for 67 people (tiny) and the wait was 45 min or so. Not the end of the world, so I ordered myself an iced coffee and went outside to read a book on my phone and enjoy the sun. 

We were seated just after 45 in of waiting, so hostess was spot on. We immediately ordered food and beverages as soon as the server came over, as we were famished. What we were not expecting was to wait another 45 minutes for the food to come out. (reason for 1 star deduction). 

There service was decent at best. Our server was friendly, but forgot several times when we requested for little things like coffee or water refills, which are all so important when you wait 45 min for food. (reason for another 1 star deduction). 

Finally, when the food came, we were not disappointed. WE ordered the Kentucky Fried Chicken which is chicken fried chicken with two free eggs over a pile of Hashbrowns and covered in a country gravy. Delicious and the most unique gravy with hints of cinnamon. The second item we shared was the avocado skilled which is several vegetables mixed with eggs over hash browns with avocado and tomatillo sauce on top. Good, but nothing out of the extraordinary. The third item we shared was the Elvis French toast with Peanut Butter, Nutella, Bacon, banana, and Strawberries. A winner in my book, and pretty stinkin good. 

So overall experience I give a 3 star for the long wait for food and the below average service. Their food is delicious but with so many great brunch places popping up, I am not sure if it is worth the wait. This on is up in the air."}
{"text":"The coffee here is amazingly good and the service is great. The BLTAE was delicious, and messy! The avocado skillet was really good too - especially the green sauce. 
I got the free cookie for the check-in offer but didn't like it - so they gave me an apple ring to go instead. They didn't have to do that - super nice!

We'll definitely be back next time we're in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Fantastic breakfast and service. We had the fried apple rings, Kentucky fried chicken, and lemon poppyseed pancakes. The apple rings and KFC were the winners for us. The fritters came out piping hot; the fried chicken was seasoned and fried perfectly. Our server, Justin, was excellent; great attitude, friendly, and on it. Several staff members walked around refilling coffee. The restaurant was clean, good music selection. If you're into breakfast/brunch, this is a spot to hit up for sure."}
{"text":"Food was excellent!! Delicious mimosas and Bloody Marys!!!  I had chicken and waffles. The chicken comes with a very savory gravy - with a hint of cinnamon in the gravy!!  In contrast to atmosphere, food was very homemade, savory --southern comfort food style."}
{"text":"Yummy yummy yummy! The food was delicious... both fresh and tasty! The staff was super friendly and fast. Definitely recommend you stop in for breakfast when in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Well well well... I'll have to start off by saying it sucks for MTO (or any business) to have to deal with getting 3 stars or less from people who do not know how restaurants work, oh and the ones who can't cook to save their own lives, oh and definitely the ones who all they know is Chili's and that $6.99 prime rib dinner at the Cannery!! Then they get on sites like Yelp and speak like they know what they are talking about... People! People! .... Stop wasting everyone's time by giving businesses 2 stars because it was too packed and you had to wait longer! What do you want these places to do, something is obviously going right if the place is packed! Or giving them 3 stars because the food was good, but they got your order wrong the first time and that pissed you off but you didn't say anything when that restaurant sends out a free dessert item! You people are annoying, lame, and disgruntled.

Anyway sorry I had to take away from MTO's positives!! The food was great. The atmosphere was great, the options of food were just right (I hate restaurants with a thousand items on it, you know everything on it can't be fresh), and definitely the service I really liked and received from the staff! Chris I believe was his name, but everyone was cool! That KFC dish was definitely permanently programmed on my taste buds!!

MTO needs to open something in the Mountains Edge, or Gramercy area!"}
{"text":"If your in downtown Las Vegas make sure you stop by here for some amazing food! Went in this morning and got the hangover burger. Wow, one of the best burgers in town! Plus the waitress was really cute too! :)"}
{"text":"I've eaten at the MTO on Main St and enjoyed their breakfast. Today I tried the one in Downtown Summerlin. We sat outside which is dog friendly. My wife had the red velvet pancakes which she loved. I on the other hand had the Ruben which I was told was very good and good size portion by the person taking my order. Neither of which was true. I was initially disappointed by the appearance and lack of meat and sauerkraut. Flavor wise it was ok. If you really want a good Ruben you should go to  The Bagle Cafe on N. Buffalo."}
{"text":"If you're that hungry.. order the MTO breakfast.

My plate was about the size of a medium-sized pizza pan. I didn't even finish it.

It was honestly ok, but not the best i've had considering that there was a lot to choose from. A feast for my eyes. 

I also ordered Mimosas and it was horrible. Not sure if the lady really knows how to make one, she keeps gradually adding more and more OJ like she's not sure what color it should be to stop.

My mom seemed to like her philly cheese steak. 

Might be back to try other stuff."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my experience at MTO.  a 4.5 star restaurant is always minimally enjoyable. And in this case, with the service, validated parking, and setting, I enjoyed my breakfast here.

I ordered far too much--but there are a lot of good options on the menu.

* blueberry lemon pancake--nice rise, fluff, and not overly sweet.
* red velvet pancake--on this one day it was a big tougher and as sweet as one might expect. probably a good hit for the kids at your table that like chocolate
* kfc plate:  i finally tried mashed browns--i know it's a simply gimmick--but it worked to get me in. :) overall--a good choice for a filling breakfast--i only wish the fried part were more crunchy/fried. it'd have been nice to have the contrast between gravy and crunch.
* coffee excellent

I had a nice woman training as a waitress, but they clearly work as a team. 
good ambiance--good for either family, business meeting, or couples morning after
parking validated for 1 hr
bathrooms have clever gender signs (eggs, sausage)"}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast. Received excellent service by Ryan our server. We had ordered the Body Builder Skillet (made of egg whites), Sustainable Salmon Skillet (love the cream cheese and salmon), and the Vegan Coconut & Carrot Pancakes that he recommended it was going to be a lot of food and offered us to purchase just one of the pancakes instead of the usual 3-stack. He was right! Our meal was very filling yet delicious! The General Manager, Donna, later stopped by our table to see how we were enjoying our food. She also gave us good tips on where to visit while in Las Vegas. 

Good service. Good food. We'll be sure to stop by again. 

Don't forget to check-in to receive your complimentary warm chocolate chip cookie!"}
{"text":"Nice airy and bright casual restaurant with pretty decent food.  Always had a good meal with friendly service. Priced kinda high considering what you're getting, but it's usually a good experience overall."}
{"text":"Delicious and creative sandwiches that tickle your taste buds.  We ordered the BLTAE, Rueban, and Hero sandwiches all had unique tastes. The BLTAE was my FAVORITE - BLT amped up!"}
{"text":"My order was really late.  They said their online went down.  Took my payment but did not get the food going for over an hour.  Very disorganized"}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere were really good at MTO, but I won't go back. The prices were far too high. MTO is basically a fast food joint that has healthy, fresh food. Yes, they bring your order to your table after you order at the counter and they clean the table when you leave (like Smashburger and Carl's, Jr.). I ordered vegan falafel, upgraded my fries to sweet potato fries, and purchased a drink from the soda fountain. My bill came to $17!

There are many great fast food restaurants in the same area that offer equally healthful food at much lower prices."}
{"text":"Been to this MTO Cafe a few times now. Enjoy coming in for breakfast and taking advantage of the \"bottomless mimosas\". Great service, friendly and the food is awesome. Highly recommend checking it out!"}
{"text":"I'm a breakfast guy... and after my favorite breakfast place in town took a big hit on Dirty Dining and got a \"C\" rating, I was looking for an alternative. When my wife read an article on this place she said I should check it out. I'm glad she did.

My first issue was trying to find parking that was free. It was early on a Sunday morning but the only free spots on the street (still a block from the restaurant) were all taken. MTO is conveniently situated in the bottom floor of a park garage, but inconveniently it cost $3.00. 

I got there right at 8:00am and it was pretty much just me and the staff.  I was greeted very nicely and my server was very attentive.

I wanted the Poppy Seed pancakes but also wanted some eggs, sausage and potatoes, Everything is a bit pricey, My bill with coffee (good coffee) for just me was $29 and change!  Add in the tip and parking and it was almost $40 for just me!  I think it is the most I have ever paid for a breakfast, and I have had breakfasts is some great places.

I did get the MTO breakfast that came with assorted meats... (more than I expected or wanted) and the pancakes(3) were big and pretty good.  I am a big guy with a hearty morning appetite but I took half the meat and half the pancakes home and had them the next morning.

It was a very good breakfast, but I don't know I will be back.  The parking cost was a surprise.  (The waitress said they are working with the city to be able to validate).The coffee machine (I think it was) made a terrible shrieking noise every five minutes or so (like crying cats standing off against one another)  that went on much longer than my early morning brain was ready for. 

 I like good heavy, hearty, crusty European style breads (La Brea Bakery style) and they offered only light weight fluffy types (Wonder bread was actually a menu option!). I ordered whole wheat, (which was thick sliced but also light and fluffy) which I barely touched (I had the pancakes).

I think there are better breakfast placed for much less... and they have free parking."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Great food, good portions, fair prices, very fresh. Super friendly staff. My new favorite place !"}
{"text":"I think this place is a bit overhyped. I came here for breakfast the other day and it was good - even very good - just not great. I like the starkness of the restaurant and the big open windows in the front. The server was nice, thoughbeit a little intrusive. I found the menu to be pretty standard and the one thing that we tried that was different (vegan coconut/carrot pancakes) were reallllly dense, kinda salty and not very good. I *might* go back if friends would want to go, but if you're downtown, go to e.a.t. It's way better."}
{"text":"Cobb salad was fantastic. Lemon poppy-seed pancakes delicious and unbelievably fluffy. Good price point for value. Nice service. Looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"What a great place! The food is full a fresh tasty quality ingredients prepared to perfection. The service is top rate; caring and friendly with smiles on their faces. Amelia was helpful, patient and full of happiness. What a great place!"}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about MTO.

The first time I came here with my husband and my Dad. I ordered a breakfast of 2 eggs over medium, bacon, and a side of toast. Also a coffee and orange juice. All of it came out just great. The eggs were cooked perfect, the bacon is great and the toast was great as well. My husband ordered the chicken and waffles and said it was also exceptional. My Dad ordered the \"Hangover\" burger and said that while it was really good, it was a little undercooked for his taste and he didn't like the sweet pickles on top.
Overall, we were really excited to come back!

The second time we came here was disappointing....
I came here again with my Husband and my Brother in Law. 
I ordered a Coffee, orange juice, and the mini donuts to share. 
First of all the waitress forgot one of our coffees and water, no big deal it just took her a while. When I received my orange juice it had a *thick coarse black hair in it!*
I told the waitress and decided I didn't want OJ after that. She barely said sorry...The mini donuts I received were more like mini dough cakes. They were very dense and not really donut like at all, they were smothered in honey and that didn't even help with the incredibly bland flavor, I dunked them in my coffee and that made them edible. Even tasty. Not sure if they come like this every time though, I would hope not.

My husband and I also split the Chicken and waffles, this time my hubby and I noted that while it was still pretty good, the gravy on the chicken was extremely bland this time around. 
My Brother in Law ordered the Bacon Dippers and the Fried Apple rings. He said the Bacon Dippers were awesome. But the Fried Apple Rings were cut extremely thick, they were fried in batter but the apples were so thick they didn't really cook at all and the batter just fell off, he took one bite and didn't want the rest. Again, not sure if they are always cut SO thick. It's like eating a sliced apple...not what he was expecting. 

Atmosphere is super nice here, it's so nice to sit by the window and have a nice view. The decorations are pretty cute and the place was very clean both times we came. 

We decided we will still want to give this place another try, everyone has off days! But hopefully our experience will be more like the first time we came! If not, we probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Great breakfast and our server Allyson was super friendly and made great suggestions. The coffee was some of the best coffee I've had at a restaurant. Worth the wait."}
{"text":"Wow this place is simply amazing !! Turned normal breakfast into a amazing dish!!!!! Very impressive !!!! Made sure to compliment the chef on his outstanding work !!!"}
{"text":"We went here months ago and I still daydream about it. My group of four was so impressed with how fresh everything was. Very healthy and tasty, not greasy like most places, where you would leave feeling like poo. This was the best food we had while in Vegas by far and I plan to stop back whenever I can. I recommend to health nuts and everyone else. Prices and service were also exceptional, and the decor was modern and inviting. All in all, you need to go here!"}
{"text":"Was in Vegas for a whole week, best place to have brunch around. I have done buffets, top end places and  places like these. Wait staff is great, food is great, and the music was on point. I wished they had a location in my home town. For all you brunch couples out there. This place is a must. Easy to park , great for a mid day meal."}
{"text":"Service was terrible, waited forever....keep thinking just because it was busy, but no. Waitress kept passing us, didn't think to check why we were still waiting even though people after us were served their food. We asked her, she brushed us off. When we finally checked what was going on with girl at register, got story about someone  calling in sick......no apology, no comp....
Outdoor  seating great, food good, price kinda high, not going to run back or recommending to anyone."}
{"text":"Cute little breakfast spot Downtown. I had the carrot and coconut vegan pancakes. They were really delicious. My mom ordered the salmon skillet which was pretty darn good as well. The staff was very friendly and the orders came out quickly. It's right next to a parking garage so its a convenient location. I would definitely come back again and try other items."}
{"text":"Place is going downhill fast. Tables on patio are always dirty and you have to ask wait staff to clean. Also, on patio trash and napkins everywhere and staff walk by as if there only job is to deliver food. Don't see myself coming back anytime soon.  We gave this location a third chance and they still failed miserably. 1st- hair in food. 2nd- waiting for almost an hour to get food...we never did end up getting it and we got our money back. 3rd- same as 2nd time but when my wife asked the worker what is going on he didn't seem to care. Downtown Summerlin get rid of this place."}
{"text":"Best breakfast/brunch in Las Vegas. Now that Pura Vida is closed for good...I rank this place my new fav brunch spot. 

Why? Quality. 
Farmers market local veggies and homemade everything. Attention to detail and custom orders are no problem. My kind of restaurant!

We were running errands or we would have biked from our place Downtown. Easy location to get to. It's near The Plaza parking lot on in the bottom of the City Parking Building. City electric cars and car chargers line the bottom of the garage and the parking is only $3 on the weekends. 

I drink my coffee black. They serve LavAzza coffee and have raw sugar option on the tables. Two wins in my book.

I must confess I do not like breakfast and being vegan on top of that there are hardly ever options in brunch type places...not MTO. The vegan items are clearly marked on the menu.

On our first visit we ordered half our meal a la carte. Sautéed fresh mushrooms, tomatoes, avocado and hash browns minus the mash (I think the mash browns have cream). Tossed all together it was a huge portion that hubby happily devoured. 

We also ordered the carrot coconut vegan pancakes. Like I said I don't like breakfast and can't stand the smell of syrup of anything remotely close to honey. For some reason the pancakes were the one of the best things I have ever eaten. Ever. They were warm, fluffy, sweet and soft in places from agave nectar. Wow. They have changed my life forever :)

I ordered the vegan falafel wrap. Yum! It has a dressing of which I guessed it to be a citrus and tahini base. Stephanie of VegOut makes a similar dressing on her massaged kale salad and it's also similar to WILD's kale salad dressing. Inside this huge portion wrap are long pieces of falafel. It's not traditional like my inlaws make, it's more of a creamy mash mixture that I want to guess it baked instead of fried. It's very good. Also inside is romaine and greens, red onion, cucumber, and roasted tomatoes. I subbed the side salad for hash browns minus the mash again (no possible cream). 
 
Amazing.

We got there at open at 8am on a Saturday and it was not busy. But I imagine that weekdays are packed with the City Building being across the street. 

Belly full of fresh goodness we were very pleased with our meal and will def be back to the little Downtown spot!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best spot in Vegas for breakfast. The Kentucky Fried Chicken was insanely good. The decor is stunning. The service is perfect. The attitude is just right. This place doesn't fit in this town of old school establishments. They absolutely get it and are here to make happy customers. Kids had a great meal also. Flip flops for sure. Oh and the USB and power at every table was a deal maker."}
{"text":"OMG! This is by far one of the best breakfast places I have ever been to! The food is so fresh and you can tell it's made with love. The vibe is so chill and bright and airy atmosphere. You have to check this place out. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Decided to try somewhere new on my day off while walking around Downtown Summerlin. MTO cafe was perfect! Fun, friendly atmosphere.  Food was fresh and cooked to order. I had the Avocado Egg Skillet which is a scramble of eggs, red onion, jalapeño jack cheese & tomatillo sauce, topped with fresh avocado. It's what's under the scramble that makes it so yummy....a nest of their signature potatoes.  They are thinly sliced shoestring type and cooked to perfection!
It's all served in a hot cast iron skillet so the dish stays warm while you are enjoying it! Nothing worse to me than cold scrambled eggs. My meal was at noon and I love that I could order eggs.... Because sometimes A girl just wants breakfast for lunch!  I'll be back to try out the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"Great wrap. I would return. This will probably be my new breakfast spot I take visitors."}
{"text":"I really liked this place. The lemon poppy pancakes were legit. The staff was good and the atmosphere is great. I look forward to going there again in the future"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time staying downtown at the golden nugget. It's a short 10 minute walk and definitely worth the wait!  I'm vegetarian and they didn't mind the special orders and recommended a recently added item to my gf, which was awesome!  Bottomless Champagne was delicious and I asked the owner Matt for some extra as he was managing on Saturday. 
I will totally come back when I'm in Vegas as it reminds me of NorCal type food and great service. Their iPad was having trouble sending orders and out order didn't go through but they were cool about it! Other than the order not going through they were a little unorganized and only 3 waiters for a busy Saturday and the owner sort of walked around like he did not know what he was doing, I even asked him about where the food came from and he was very unsure and his response was \"I leave it to the chefs\"
Food was worth the wait though and I will be back!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The worst part about the place? There are so many choices and you really can not eat them all.
I went for my first time today and enjoyed every piece of it. The atmosphere, the ambience, the décor, the staff, the food, the pictures of food flashing on the screen to help aid your choices, just everything was lovely. 
My waitress was very attentive, came by at just the right times to ask how everything was, and constantly filled up our water (they even filled my water up without me noticing!)
I got the The Hero sandwich, my friend got the chicken in a waffle, and we shared the lemon poppy seed pancakes. Everything was great.
I usually hate chicken and waffles (see Roscoes!) but this was so good. Light and fluffy, soft chicken that's not loaded with grease. 
The pancakes were great too, and different. A little more lemon would have been appreciated but, lemon is my favorite flavor, so I'm a little biased. 
The Hero was worth it, especially cause I'm a sandwich person.
Would recommend, and am going back. Need to try so many other things."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in LV!

Unlike most visitors, my fiancé and I got up at sunrise (6am) and wanted s spot open early and walkable from our hotel in downtown. 

MTO turned out to be a great pick! We split a skillet and green juice at 7am... We were the only 2 people in there. The service was friendly and felt very normal after a night of wandering through Fremont.

I hope to return!"}
{"text":"stopped by when i was staying at the plaza. i had the avocado skillet. good food and i love the big coffee cups."}
{"text":"Overall this was a good breakfast with a descent menu selection. Word to the wise, share a plate. I ordered the MTO breakfast and ended up waisting half of it. I HATE WASTING FOOD!!!! but whats a man to do with breakfast food hanging out in his car all day?the eggs were good and the bacon was perfect. There was was this other rectangular looking meat thing tat was super salty and not that great to taste. It also lost a star for not validating parking. It doesn't have it own parking and, is instead, connected to a parking structure. It was only $3 bucks, but who wants to pay to park for a restaurant?"}
{"text":"I don't usually notice service unless it is outstanding or terrible, but I couldn't shut up about how attentive and alert out waitress was. 

After a night of heavy La Bayou Yard-Long drinking, this hit the spot! The salmon skillet was on point, and the KFC chicken is a nice alternative to its greasy cousin, but I feel there is a lot more to the menu -- such as those delectable honey donuts.

Portions were sized appropriately and you will not leave hungry or disappointed. Price was fair for the quality you receive. 

PS the beet juice (red juice) is THE BOMB - nourishment with every sip!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed this place in downtown Las Vegas. We went here just before hitting the road after spending a fun few days in the strip. The place is cute and had nice decor. Mid you check out the restrooms the ladies' door is labeled 'eggs' while the men's are 'sausages' haha. Also, don't forget to check in to get free chocolate chip cookies and they also validate your parking ticket. Score!

I ordered the lemon poppy seed pancake with blueberry ginger compote. My bf ordered the onion soup and chorizo skillet and out friend ordered the hangover burger. 

I had three huge pancakes! They were really good but I wish it came with more of the blueberry ginger compote, I barely tasted the ginger as well! It was still delicious though and I'm glad they gave syrup on the side. I tasted my bf's chorizo skillet and I loved the blend of the chorizo, egg, tomato and potato! Very hearty meal. He also enjoyed his French onion soup. I think he even liked it more than his skillet haha. 

Overall, great place to have breakfast/brunch/lunch. Decently price and you don't have to wait in line like in the buffets."}
{"text":"This is a really nice out-of-the-way breakfast/lunch cafe. Located across the street from Vegas City Hall, the cafe doesn't rely on the tourist trade but it is close enough to downtown you can walk from most of the hotels, e.g., Golden Nugget. 
Wait staff was excellent and the food really unusual, not your \"normal\" breakfast and lunch menu. Neat pancakes. Worth the walk."}
{"text":"I got the Kentucky Fried Chicken dish at MTO Cafe with their blueberry ginger lemonade.  Both the drink and meal were delicious!  The service was friendly, and the food came out in a reasonable time.  I also had a raspberry macaroon, which was quite tasty."}
{"text":"The girlfriend and I were in downtown Vegas and looking for a breakfast/brunch spot. Boy oh boy did we strike gold! This cafe is fantastic in both service and food quality. The g/f has some dairy restrictions that put our server in accommodating overdrive! She and the chef were awesome in making a delicious, custom dairy free skillet (MTO).
The homemade tomatillo sauce was out of this world. 

I ordered the KFC and my taste buds were shocked to life with enjoyment. Two words....Mash Browns!! We couldn't be happier with our Yelp find. Oh, the coffee is especially smooth and tasty. Take that Starbucks!

We will definitely be returning in the future."}
{"text":"Unbelievably fresh and yummy comfort food. Breakfast options include Spam,....WHAT???!!!  Breakfast and sandwiches were tasty, service quick and friendly (thanks, Donna).  We'll definitely be back when we're in the area."}
{"text":"Breakfast and Bansky art ;) If you're tired of the Vegas strip, crappy overrated old fashioned restaurants, and you're in search of a cool place to eat, then this place is definitely for you.

It was my last day in Vegas and I wanted some nice breakfast that wasn't going to be greasy and large just for the sake of it. Americans love their large portions. Anyway my yelp search brought me here. Actually I was heading to \"eat\" but all the roads were closed off and I didn't want to walk alone with my 19 month old amongst all the foul smelling homeless people so I had to yelp search again but I'm glad I did!

I shared the MTO breakfast with my son. OMG it was one of the best breakfasts I've had, full of protein and lots of YUM without feeling greasy and grossed out afterwards!! Three eggs, chicken sausage, FOUR pieces of bacon (I think two was Turkey had two normal), spam (I wasn't too keen on but hey I'm not American), tomatoes, cheesy hash, some berries and two thick pieces of toast. I wasn't keen on the bread only because I'm from Europe and I'm not a fan of American \"bread\". I wish I took a photo of it but as soon as it came my son was all over it so I missed my chance :( you really have to see it to appreciate how yummy the breakfast is. I love my chicken sausages and turkey bacon so it really was a perfect breakfast for me. Coffee was good too. 

If you checkin on yelp, you get a free pastry. We got a free muffin and a small pastry as a substitute because we had to leave and the walnut toastie was still baking. 

I saw some cool looking pancakes with grated carrot (?) on top and also bacon pancakes!! Which my husband would've really liked if he would've come with us. I'm sad we have to leave today, because I would've come back again tomorrow if we were still in Vegas."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing everything is made to order, just like their name says. The entire menu is a la carte, so you can mix and match anything on the menu. The Apple cinnamon waffle is delicious. Their KFC is also amazing, it comes with the sausage gravy, it's has a unique twist here. Give it a try."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! My husband and I are here from Chicago. Everything is fresh there's no freezer food. 
Staff is amazing, Ben and staff were so friendly. Something were not used to being from Chicago, so were were grateful. 
I had the avocado omelette, red juice which was delicious. My hubby had the poppy seed pancakes topped with blueberries. And he loved them surprisingly being the picky eater that he is. 
And last you cannot leave without trying the fried apple rings. 
AMAZING!!!!"}
{"text":"Great spot for brunch, complete with bottomless breakfast cocktails. The brie and walnut honey glazed grilled cheese is my favorite!"}
{"text":"Took over 30 months minutes to bring out our friends meals, and then one of the servers had an attitude about it. Food itself was good but overpriced"}
{"text":"Free cookie with yelp check-in (they're scrumptious too! Great with a glass of dipping milk)

Waiter was extremely attentive and suggested his favorite item, the Kentucky fried chicken. Surely enough, it was amazing!!! Loved everything about it!!! Two thumbs up

We also ordered a chicken sausage scramble on a skillet and thought it was mediocre. It was definitely missing something in the scramble, I'm thinking cheese but they did have yummy tasting maple chicken sausages to make up for it. The potatoes (which I looked forward to) were soggy and seemingly undercooked for my liking. :(


They also gave us a sample plate of fried apple rings which were alright. Tasted like a apple doughnut but was lacking in the crisp. A bit mushy for my liking but still good."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Downtown LV! I first ventured in for a weekend brunch and have been back multiple times since then. 

Some highlights:
Bacon Dippers peppercorn maple syrup - literally bacon dipped in pancake batter
Chicken \"In A Waffle\" yup, it's chicken in a waffle - comes with an incredible 'hash mash'
Turkey Melt avocado, tomatoes, jack & cheddar, chipotle aioli (spicy) on sourdough + fries
Fried Apple Rings cinnamon-sugar butter icing (genius)
Fresh Green Juice"}
{"text":"There is not enough seating and it took forever to get the food. Parking out front looked atrocious, but we parked at the discovery museum and walked over the bridge. I had the hangover burger, which is not cheap, at 13 bucks, however, it was incredible. Bacon and egg in a burger... Was exactly the amount of richness I wanted today. Probably one of the better burgers I've ever had too. But slow service, crap parking, and price are going to prevent me from giving 5 stars... Fyi, my friend had the Teri turkey burger and she said it was average."}
{"text":"Awesome downtown gem. Just had a fantastic lunch with great service. Can't wait to come back for breakfast, they look amazing. And remember it's never too early for a Crabbie's ginger beer!"}
{"text":"When I come to Summerlin, I always stop here for their espresso. Clean place and great customer service by Alex. Food is fresh and healthy."}
{"text":"Nothing special but it all tasted good. I liked that you could pick the different flavors rather you want it as a pancake, waffle or French toast. They give you a ticket for the parking garage which was nice."}
{"text":"PDSF Review:  PARKING is validated; 50% off in the structure.  DECOR is clean and modern.  SERVICE was absolutely excellent; server was Michael (gives good recommendations and checks on your party regularly).  FOOD was absolute delight.  Wife and I got the KFC special (fried chicken with mashed potatoes/hash brown)... finger-licking clean!   We also got the chicken skillet = healthy and fresh tasting, but after eating the superstar KFC special, the skillet was less memorable.  We also got the red juice, which was healthy and refreshing.  Will go back for sure."}
{"text":"Muy buen sazón, excelente atención por parte de los meseros, 100% recomendable. El ambiente es muy agradable ya sea para ir con la familia o amigos."}
{"text":"I had the Hangover Burger. I'll break it down by ingredient, you'll see why. 

I can't comment on the bun since I ordered it without one, but that wouldn't have affected my review. The ingredients are as follows: bacon, fried egg, Tillamook cheddar, special sauce, and fries.

Bacon: great. Cooked perfectly, tasted good. The quality of food I expected from a place like this. 

Fried egg: amazing. cooked perfectly, seasoned perfectly. If every egg I had for the rest of my life was like this egg I would be happy. I typically order my eggs \"over medium\" and very few people ever get it right. This came out just shy of a perfect over medium (that's what I assume is the standard way, as mine and my wife's were both that way and we didn't specify any particular cooking method when ordering). While it was shy of over medium, it was perfect for a burger. 

Tillamook cheddar: great. This is pretty good cheese. Back when I ate cheese by the pound this is what I would get. Good stuff. Hard to mess it up though, as it's a specific brand. I got exactly what I expected from this.

Special sauce: this was basically cole slaw. It was awful. Tasted like more sugar than anything, I immediately removed it all from the burger. Hugely disappointing, and incredibly over-sweet. Was also really runny.

Fries: just absolutely awful. Easily the most disappointing part of this meal. Taste extremely cheap and low quality. Very little salt, very little flavor other than that flavor you get when you know these fries are some cheap crappy bulk freezer section bag that have been reheated and left under a warming lamp for hours. Just awful. Terrible.

Hamburger patty itself: the flavor was only okay, but it is very visually unappealing. Looks like, again, something super cheap from the freezer section of a crappy grocery store. Blatantly pre-pressed and pre-formed. However, I asked for it cooked medium and it was cooked perfectly. Seasoned well, but the meat itself can only be dressed up so much. Both visually and in flavor.

On the plate, there were also two kinds of \"pickles\". Definitely not my style. I tried both styles, expecting a pickle and getting something from the first that tasted more like a super-slightly-pickled cucumber, and from the second that again tasted like a more-pickled-but-covered-in-sugar cucumber. They were both very not good. I was able to eat the first, but I had to immediately spit out the second. Totally gross. I don't understand why the sugar featured so prominently, cucumbers are sweet on their own and pickles are not. These were not a good combination of flavors.

It's kind of sad to write this review, as the burger's flavor combination with the egg and the bacon and cheese really went well together, but the cheapness of the patty and the extremely disappointing fries make me suspect the quality of all the ingredients. The food is all cooked perfectly. Somebody in the kitchen obviously knows exactly what they're doing. The egg and bacon and patty were all expertly executed. What they don't understand is that quality ingredients are important, apparently. I will not be back here any time soon."}
{"text":"If your at the mall shopping this is a nice fresh alternative to mall food! This is a cute little spot. It's super clean with a friendly staff and the food is really fresh! Loved my falafel wrap. They serve their full menu all day. So if you want breakfast for dinner you can have it! Their omelets looked amazing as the table next to us had them. We opted for the skillet version of eggs and it was yummy! Would definitely go back if we are in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!! Highly recommend! This place was just what we needed to start our day. Food was fantastic and the staff was super nice!"}
{"text":"New fan favorite!!  We love this place. The food is fantastic. The \"Kentucky Fried Chicken\" is amazing. My husband devoured the Reuben.  We have been few a couple of times and love the energy here!  Sounds like they will have a new location in Summerlin Centre. This place feels \"local\". We met Mike, the manager, on our first trip in. Great guy that has a great staff. Next time we walked in, they totally remembered who we were.  That's a great talent to have, especially in a city like Las Vegas, where people are in and out all the time."}
{"text":"A perfectly pleasant brunch on our never ending quest to keep trying new places around the city! Fantastic service- truly interested in conversation. Perfect food and atmosphere- exactly what a diner in the 50's was intended to evolve into! And very tasty desserts- THANKS'S DONNA!!! We've put this place on our \"bring everyone here\" list!"}
{"text":"I found MTO on eat24 when I was searching for something to eat for lunch while I was at work. They offered free delivery with a minimum $10 purchase (before tax). I researched them on yelp and found great reviews so I had to try them. I ordered the hangover burger and it was delicious. The burger is huge! Meat was seasoned good, fried egg dripped down my hand when I bit into it (good thing they gave me a nice thick napkin with fancy plastic silverware) and fries were hot and crispy. I had a coupon from eat24 for $2 off so the order came up to $12.05. LOTS of food for the price."}
{"text":"There chicken with breakfast is great!  I would recommend this place for great quality food.  They didn't have the triple stack batter, so the waitress recommended the red velvet with the chocolate sauce and strawberries on the side.  My lil' one loved it.  My son got the waffles with chicken.  He is smiling!  I have the fried chicken...delicious.  Parking is wired down here but it is walking distance from the Plaza and Golden Nugget."}
{"text":"Thanksgiving burger and hangover burger.

Thanksgiving burger was excellent, the balance between truffle bread pudding and turkey patty was perfect."}
{"text":"The best breakfast downtown. The Big Elvis is the perfect combination of sweetness. The skillets are fresh as fresh can be. Great service too!"}
{"text":"I went here a week ago with my family while we were visiting Las Vegas, and we actually found out about it on yelp while looking for a place for brunch before heading back to LA! 

Location - 
MTO Cafe is tucked in downtown Las Vegas away from the craziness and chaos of the strip. But if you are looking to gamble after a great meal, the cafe is only a few blocks down from the Gold Nugget and other DTLV locales. The cafe itself is simply decorate with a bight interior paint job and large wall art. 

The food - 
MTO had a decent sized menu, and everything on it sounded de-lish! I ended up getting the \"broccoli\" (egg whites, spinach, Tillamook cheddar, jalapeno, mushrooms) as an omelette (other options were a wrap or skillet) and it was AMAZING. I am in LOVE with breakfast foods and this was one of the best tasting and well-crafted omelettes that I've had, and it was just the perfect amount to boot! I also had their green juice which had the perfect mix of fruits and veggies so that it didn't taste like the \"typical\" green juice which is basically liquefied salad, hold the dressing. 

My other family members ordered the \"avocado\" (tomatillo sauce, red onions, cilantro, poblano peppers, jack cheese) and the \"Kentucky fried chicken\" (fried chicken with two eggs, mash browns, country gravy) and they were also equally amazing. 

To finish off our breakfast, we could not resist trying their mini donuts, and it was definitely worth it!

Overall, if you're looking for a great place to eat that isn't a buffet or cost an arm and a leg to eat a delicious meal, this is the place to go to."}
{"text":"Place was super clean and inviting but prices were way too much for their servings. My family had the breakfast and my omelet was nicely seasoned but small, small salad on side with no dressing for over $11.00? BabyStacks cafe blows away their breakfast food menu and pricing for the amount of serving."}
{"text":"Finding a restaurant that has vegan options along with \"regular\" options isn't always easy. We found this place on Yelp and I am so glad we tried it! The serving sizes were perfect. I had the falafel wrap, which was absolutely delicious. My friends had eggs with country potatoes and loved them, and my friend's daughter had sweet waffles. The whole experience was wonderful and the price is awesome, especially for Vegas! I will definitely be going there the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast place right down the street from the Plaza Hotel and old downtown Vegas.  Loved the atmosphere of this place.  The waitress was very friendly and went above and beyond.  Would recommend them to anyone."}
{"text":"Ohmigosh! Drove past this place numerous visits to Vegas. Finally tried last July. I have CRAVED the Pancake Bacon Dippers since. Crispy bacon, pancake is crispy on the edges. Staff are SO friendly!!!! Easy walk from Golden Nugget. My main destination this trip! I am a happy lady."}
{"text":"Let's just start with AMAZING!  This is our new favorite breakfast place in Vegas!  Fantastic food, service and atmosphere.  I had the broccoli with avocado skillet and my wife had the breakfast tacos special. Both were delicious with amazing flavor.  

Plus we had fried apple rings for a little treat after - words just can't describe how great it was!  I almost forgot to mention the coffee is one the best - LavAzza.

Coming back tomorrow for another meal before we head home!"}
{"text":"Great food and service!!  Had the MTO breakfast and it was delicious.  It is a huge meal.  Come hungry."}
{"text":"Wow! Such a cute place! Met some friends here for lunch for the first time.  We viewed the menu as we stood in line. Once everyone ordered, we sat down and caught up. Food was delivered to us in about 10 minutes. 
FOOD WAS ABSOLUTELY DELECTABLE! 

I ordered the cinnamon apple French toast for $11 and loved every bite! 
The staff was friendly and took our empty plates as we finished eating. Super nice atmosphere!"}
{"text":"This hipster brunch spot looked a little iffy outside but I definitely recommend going inside. The hangover burger is out of this world and our waitress was the best. Cary or Carrie (not sure how you spell it) just made my day. She is so sweet and super real. I will definitely stop by anytime I'm in Vegas. I felt like a hungover piece of crap this morning but Carrie and bottomless mimosas just turned that around. Might not be my scene but I appreciate the awesomeness this place throws at you."}
{"text":"I went here over a week ago.  I am still dreaming about my return to have the Hangover Burger once again.   It is TDF.  This is a two handed burger that is indulgently mess...juices running down your arm, about a dozen napkins needed. The egg was perfectly cooked...oozy warm yolk, medium burger cooked medium (yeah!), good sturdy but soft bun (which I don't eat, but gives structure), I believe quality Tillamook Cheddar for a little tang and more unchousness? (sp).  

Just me...I wish service wasn't so cafeteria like but they still bring it too you!  Great place...I will return!"}
{"text":"This is a great breakfast/brunch option if you are near the downtown area.  The prices are moderate, but the quality and portions justify the cost. The interior is spacious, modern and open. I didn't feel like like I was elbow to elbow with other patrons. I guess traveling to places where real estate is much more expensive and most restaurants are tiny and claustrophobic has made me appreciate the spaciousness of many restaurants locally.  

I had the hen house wrap with fries and the red juice. The juice was excellent with a unique flavor inspired by beets, carrots and red pepper. The hen house wrap was a simple chicken wrap that was surprisingly flavorful.  The husband had a plate full of breakfast foods consisting of turkey bacon, hash browns, eggs and spam. Everything was fresh and prepared as requested. The service was attentive without being overbearing. I will be back to sample more of their delicious menu."}
{"text":"Have heard great things about their original location, but Downtown Summerlin is far more convenient for me- décor is on the hipster side with birds, natural wood, and far too many chairs around any given table. Also, apparently ketchup is frowned upon? More on this later.

Menu has several breakfast choices, of which I am not a fan. The soups and salads are all solid, but the sandwiches are hit or miss- please note that the Philly comes with Velveeta, which will put off many people (myself included). The Hero is delectable and a generous portion, too. The same can be said for the sea salt fries it is served with- the kitchen is a bit heavy-handed with the salt flakes, and despite the presence of Cholula at the condiment bar, I had to ask staff for ketchup. Who had to ask the chef to bring out a ramekin from the kitchen. For KETCHUP. At a place that serves FRIES. Found this incredibly odd and awkward.

The 5 cheese macaroni is one of the best I've had with a good, thick roux and curly cavatappi noodles. However, for a $7 side it's practically an entree it's so rich. Recommend cutting the portion and price to make it a side, and maybe offering an additional $9 portion as an entrée, perhaps with a protein."}
{"text":"Very cool brunch spot in DTLV. Great service and staff! Food was excellent and prices are very reasonable. Definitely a new fav brunch spot!"}
{"text":"Ohhh MTO! Thank you for making our Life is Beautiful weekend just that much better. We came here 2 out of the 3 days we were in town...sadly, there were way too many people on the second day we tried to come. But 2 out of 3 ain't bad.

Lots of healthy options at this place, loved the names of the Made To Order breakfasts like Yoga Pants and Body Builder. The food here was just what we needed to fuel us for the 3 days of festival shenanigans; on the healthier and lighter side so we can save the calories for the liquid diet to be had later on.

Service was really great here. Our servers were all really attentive but never overbearing (bc that's the worst)! Really appreciated the non stop flow and constant refilling of coffee. This place does get busy especially this past weekend...not sure how busy they get during other times of the year, but if you want to get seated quickly, make sure to get your ass up and over there before 10am."}
{"text":"The turkey melt was DELICIOUS! I added grilled onions... So good!!! I got a salad instead of fries, and while it was really fresh and tasty, after I saw someone get the fries I was bummed out that I made the healthy choice! They were thin and crispy... I was very tempted to order a side. This place was so good I plan on going back before I leave Vegas... I have to try the Philly.. and the fries!"}
{"text":"$20.00 for burger, soda, and fries? - mm no! - it was not that good! I don't mind to pay more if food is amazing. But all things considered, not worth it. Disappointed."}
{"text":"I haven't even tried the food. I came for brunch in April with my dog because it states on Yelp that this restaurant is pet friendly. However, the tables outside are in direct sunlight and the waitress informed me there were no umbrellas to provide shade. When I asked for a bowl of water, they didn't have one. So I left and went to Bar + Bistro at the Arts Factory where they have a very dog friendly covered patio and bottomless mimosas during Sunday brunch.

Restaurants should NOT advertise that they allow dogs if they're not willing to make basic accommodations."}
{"text":"The food is decent but the service has been just ok every time i've been there.  The food isn't plated well but hey it's still good.  We do continue to go there once in awhile but not as often as some other place we regular.  One thing I must say is that they will validate your parking so take advantage of that."}
{"text":"A cute cafe with some big flavors. 

For our first visit we ordered a grilled cheese which was no ordinary sandwich as it came with Brie, walnuts and honey (absolutely loved it) and a simple salad (it didn't have a lot of anything and was too simple) with a queso carne sandwich of skirt steak, velveeta, red wine onions & fries (everything was delicious). 

With our yelp checkin we received a free chocolate chip cookie but unfortunately it was burnt and too hard around the edges. I still appreciate the freebie. 

With the prices a tad high I expect a little more. The environment is very comfy and I would go back to try some other items as I had a difficult time choosing what to order because a few things got my attention."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast and expected more based on the reviews, but only a limited breakfast menu.  They aren't response for my misconception, so no downgrades there.  

 Order the special which comes with several cured meats, three eggs, toast, and potatoes  meats were just OK. Bacon all day and no smoke. One type of sausage was stone cold. Sunny side up eggs had runny whites. Big negative in my book. 

Showed up with only two eggs, and when i pointed that out they effort offered to cook me an egg.  So no harm no foul there.

Service was great.  Atmosphere pleasant. The food was just OK."}
{"text":"Absolutely the business I love it and have to go back asap love the food here wish it was open longer."}
{"text":"Finally, a much needed alternative eatery in the growing Downtown area for a causal breakfast or lunch. The feel is refreshing, welcomed natural lighting, comfortable and conversational, similar to a walk up cafe you would find in larger cities. The menu fresh, distinct and elevated comfort food. Can't wait for a Sunday brunch there hopefully soon!"}
{"text":"First off, they have a parking garage literally right next door and they'll give you a ticket discounting your parking $1.50! 

Went in around 9:30, so it wasn't packed at all. Ordered the Hangover Burger and the bf went with the chicken & waffles. My burger came with an over easy egg cooked perfectly, oozing out when cutting then burger in half. The burger itself was delicious. Bacon was crispy, the house sauce was tasty and the fries weren't too oily/salty either, no regrets going with the burger (even though it was breakfast). 

Also got to try a piece of the chicken & waffles which was fried nicely and the waffles were fluffy :) 

Would've given the place 4/5 since the service was mediocre, but the food made it 5/5. Definitely will be back if I find myself downtown."}
{"text":"Just discovered this place while waiting to have a meeting at City Hall. Very impressive--had an excellent omelet in a friendly, nicely designed space. I love that it's nestled into the ground level of a parking facility. A terrific way to maximize urban space and offer a place to go in the extended Symphony Park area of Las Vegas."}
{"text":"My mom and I had a great breakfast here! We were staying on Fremont Street and just made the short walk here. The Lemon Poppyseed Pancake are AMAZING. Great coffee, Great service. Much more low key and had local feel for us out of towners."}
{"text":"After walking in,  you go to the counter to place your order. They serve breakfast all day. For lunch there are salads, sandwiches,  wraps and more. Also a small kids menu that is reasonably priced. We shared the $13 Reuben. It came with a choice of fries or a small salad. My grandchildren shared a grilled cheese sandwich off the kids menu. We chose to have it served with apple slices ( there were five very tiny apple slices - even for a kids menu side dish, this was a small portion)
Ambience: it is set up as a fast food Eatery. Very Spartan in the decorating with maybe a dozen tables for 4 and chairs surrounding them. There is very loud music blaring. And with decent size crowd, the noise level is very very loud. They serve the food on real China, a very nice touch considering how informal the restaurant is.
Service: the staff we're all very pleasant and seem to be genuinely happy working there. The food was brought out in the appropriate amount of time. A staff member came and cleared the table when we were done eating.
Food: the Reuben sandwich was fairly light on the corned beef. I know that there was melted Swiss cheese in the sandwich because I saw it. However there was so little that you could not taste it. There was ample sauerkraut relative to the amount of meat. However , it was put on in such a way that it soaked the bottom piece of bread. Overall, a very disappointing Reuben sandwich. Especially at that price point. The kids got grilled cheese. I got to taste their leftovers. That was actually quite good for a kids grilled cheese sandwich (only $5 - quite reasonable). 
Value: for a very informal fast food breakfast and lunch eatery , it was okay. However I feel that he was somewhat pricey for what you get. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Tastiest breakfast I've had in Las Vegas. Really pleasant staff and a nice space too. Well worth a visit."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!  

Friendly delivery people, quick service, and last but not least... high-quality food!  I recommend the carrot and coconut pancakes and the lemon cilantro chicken salad, which may be the best salad I've ever had.  Everything tastes very fresh.  Yum, so impressed."}
{"text":"Excellent food, best way to recover with a fun a night with bottomless mimosas and fresh delicious food. On point DT Vegas has a lot to offer."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic Place for Breakfast! I got the Kentucky breakfast with chicken, gravy, and poached eggs, it was top notch! I could eat that every day if my heart could take it, but it was phenomenal and worth the trip if you are staying of the strip on a visit.

Service was very good and attentive, coffee cups are huge, and the fresh squeezed green juice is perfect for charging up after a hard night in Vegas. Our server gave us local tips and they have free WiFi

I highly recommend MTO!"}
{"text":"Another great surprise in DTS .
Generous fresh portions , great juice , nice atmosphere . 
Definitely  would recommend as a quick get away , 
The staff was very cheerful and the manager came around and ask us if everything was ok she offered refills !"}
{"text":"The food was amazing!!! We had a large party so everyone ordered something different and tried each other's dishes.  Chicken in a Waffle was probably my favorite, followed closely by the Reuben and the lemon poppy seed pancakes with blueberry ginger compote.   My daughter isn't quite old enough to appreciate that the kids menu comes on the back of an etch-a-sketch, but the adult men at our table really seemed to enjoy it! Super cute decor, friendly staff, overall great experience with fantastic food. Great addition to Downtown!"}
{"text":"Had the hangover burger... the best burger I've had in a long time.  Cooked to perfection. The dressing on the little side salad is haunting me. DELISH!"}
{"text":"After reading the yelp reviews I couldn't wait to try this place.  A couple of friends and I went down and tried it out. The hostess was very sweet and personable. The decor and feel of the place was nice. Our server was very friendly and made some good recommendations.   We waited awhile for our food. The manager did come
By at apologize. Then two of us got out breakfast. But my friend who is 8 months pregnant was still missing her food. They sent us some dessert. The food was just okay but the mimosas were good. To make things worse the server ran our credit cards on the wrong bill. So that took awhile to clear up. I may try to go back to see if my experience will be better. It felt like a bit of headache. We appreciated all their kindness but we were over it by the end of it."}
{"text":"Food was great. Service was excellent. Food was fresh and it was a chic little place, can't wait to go back! Got the vegan carrot coconut pancakes and they were bomb. hubby got the Kentucky Fried Chicken he said it was all so bomb!"}
{"text":"Very nice place. Atmosphere is relaxing. Rachel was an awesome waitress. Definitely going back   Bottomless mimosas were the bomb."}
{"text":"I'm surprised this place has such a high Yelp rating... the pancakes are delicious but my husband complained that his steak and eggs lacked seasoning and my entire breakfast platter was given to a homeless man. Except for the toast, I loved that! 

I wasted my money here and I've yet to win it back at a casino. Pray for me."}
{"text":"Super duper friendly staff! Be sure to check in through Yelp and get your free cookie.  We were a group of 6 vacationing and loved eating here so much that we came back the next day.  Broccoli skillet is deeeelish.  Fun vibe. Clean.  Wish there was a MTO Cafe in our hometown."}
{"text":"Although Summerlin is closer, I like both locations.  I love the grilled cheese - I have them add a chicken breast."}
{"text":"Stopped in here on a busy Saturday afternoon and ordered the BLTAE. While the sandwich itself was delicious and the open faced presentation lovely, it was quite difficult to eat. It would have been much better had the sandwich not been served open faced. Putting the sandwich together was messy and because the plates have no rims/lips, the egg yolk leaked off the plate and onto the table. 
My only other complaint would be to have more than one bathroom. With such a busy location, lining up to the bathroom was annoying. 
No complaints on the food itself and although it is a little pricey the serving sizes are quite decent.  I would definitely come back and recommend this place to people."}
{"text":"Love the food here if you can get it. Waited 15 minutes for a table - to be expected on a Sunday morning. Waited around an hour to get food- never came. Asked waiter to check on order. 5 minutes later still hadn't heard anything. Should have been offered a beer or something. Just sat and stared at my empty table with no explanation. Even though I like the food, probably won't return. Too many other options."}
{"text":"Most amazing brunch loved the vibe and the cool staff.  It was so welcoming new favorite place"}
{"text":"Love love love this place.  I've been here several times for lunch because my office is nearby.  The food is always great.  A few items are a little difficult to eat (i.e. The Bob, the chicken slips all around and falls off the bread) but always great taste.

Some unexpected items on the menu as well. \"Kentucky Fried Chicken\" looked great from the view I had of it on another table. Vegan Falafel is probably my favorite.  Warning though: this one doesn't travel well.  Tastes great in the restaurant but was pretty bad a few times we ordered it via Delivery. 

They do a nice job of creating new tastes.  For example, adding honey to the grilled cheese, genius and delicious!

The atmosphere is also nice.  Up beat and fun but not too loud.

Oh, and bottomless mimosas.  Everyday.  $15."}
{"text":"Sweet spot downtown. Interior is well done. Great playlist. Accommodating to kids. Great friendly fast service. Free cookie when you check in!
Got the KFC breakfast due to the reviews here and I'll be honest I probably wouldn't order it again. It wasn't bad but it wasn't delicious either. The chicken and gravy had a subtle sweet smokiness to it that I was not  expecting. Also I am sensitive to overly salted food but  I think this dish could have used MORE salt... But, nothing a few splashes of Cholula and sprinkle of salt couldn't fix. 
Husband got the MTO breakfast which was your typical breakfast fare, eggs, your choice of toast (brioche!) and a plethora of breakfast meats. It was good and filling. 
Would definitely come back to try other things."}
{"text":"Been coming for brunch every time I'm in town. Delicious!! They don't disappoint.  This time we order the avocado skillet and vegan  carrot coconut pancakes and mimosas."}
{"text":"This place has the best clam chowder I've ever had in my life!!! Their BLT sandwich is awesome too (it's made with egg and avocado, you have to try it). Unfortunately their cookies are not up to par, but they have this amazing granola called \"Rooster Boy\" that's the best granola I've ever tasted."}
{"text":"Had a fabulous meal in the new restaurant and this young man Sean recommended such wonderful suggestions we had to try. The food was great!!! The service was awesome!!! So nice to have such wonderful service to match the food!! Thanks Sean for a great lunch and we will be back!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came on sat morning. We had the red juice which was wonderful along with these big mugs of coffee.  My husband ordered the \"Kentucky fried chicken\" dish and I ordered the lemon poppyseed pancakes.  All I can say is AWESOME!  We also got an order of mini donuts with honey which was AWESOME as well!  I also must mention the mashed browns. I could just order those and eat those alone and be so happy!  I am already planning my next trip to this place!"}
{"text":"I love this place first time there it was great. Michelle was our waitress she's great very happy girl good good service. I order chicken and waffles with bottomless mimosas and love it"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!!! It is amazing every single time!!! The food is great and so is the staff!!! My favorite dishes are the skillets but I also know the steak and eggs are out of this world! Also...bottomless mimosas and Bloody Mary's ....can't beat it!!! How is it possible for a place to be on point every time ?! These owners and staff members obviously care about your experience. Come to MTO on Main...you will not be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"We've waited 30 minutes for our food while we saw the people that ordered after us received their food. They approached other tables around us stating that they apologize for the long wait because of a sudden rush of people. But we were before that rush. We saw our food at the area for the servers to give out to customers for 15 minutes. When we questioned them about it, they said they were just waiting for the grilled cheese. They gave us our food without the grilled cheese, and to everyone's great surprise.... Our food was cold. Terrible time management. We used to come here a lot, but they've definitely lost a loyal customer. Especially because one of the workers apologized to a family for their food taking a while (way less than us) and gave them a plate of cookies for free! We got no apology and only thing we got from them was cold food."}
{"text":"Second time to eat at this location and was not as happy as last visit. Prices are expensive for the amount of food you get and I think it's wrong for the machine to ask for a tip as you pay on the register before even getting food or service. It's self serve so basically why am I tipping, it's also tacky to leave a tip jar at the register when they only bring your food to your table as drinks and everything else is self serve. I don't see other restaurants asking for tips for the kitchen staff.
Ordered the apple baked rings, while they tasted good I think it's ridiculous to pay $7 and only get 3 on a plate, very deceiving on the menu board.
Will not return as I will continue to visit EAT downtown and other local restaurants there"}
{"text":"Thank you people of yelp for sharing your feelings about the apple fried rings. They are truly awesome!"}
{"text":"So happy & satisfied that we found this place we used the helpful reviews from yelp! 
Delicious clean food made to order, I had a vegan salad every ingredient was fresh & packed with flavor, my friend had the hangover burger which he said was scrumptious, a little m set to eat but worthy! The staff was very efficient, friendly & welcoming Manon thank you!"}
{"text":"A must place to have breakfast, but try to get here when they open, it doesn't get packed for nothing. Service is amazing... and the food?! Just WOW... really delicious .  Only 10 min away from the strip & well worth it!!! Can't wait to come back again!!"}
{"text":"We agree with those who love the food and excellent service.  Their menu is clever and enticing and delicious, the setting is charming and the service is top-notch (Thanks, Ryan).  OUR BEST RECOMMENDATION IS WELL EARNED.  They do Vegas proud."}
{"text":"On a recent trip to Las Vegas, we needed a place for lunch and decided to try to find something on Yelp with some great ratings. So to MTO we went. You do have to pay to park, they will validate your parking ticket but not completely. When we walked into the restaurant there was a rush which was strange to us because it was like 11:30 on a weekday before the lunch rush. There was an open table next to a couple eating but the ladies, purse was on the open table so they would not seat us until another table cleared which was over half an hour later. We were pretty irritated with the fact that they were unwilling to seat us. When we finally did get seated our service was extremely slow and from the time we entered the restaurant to the time we left the restaurant over one and a half hours passed, just for lunch! The music in the restaurant is extremely loud and we had to shout over the table to hear one another. We asked if the music could be lowered but we were rejected. Anyhow, thankfully the food was superb! Salads were large, fresh and the homemade dressing was divine! The sandwiches were amazing and everything was prepared perfectly. Aside from the horrible service and LOUD music, this place is amazing!"}
{"text":"This place is our favorite place to eat breakfast or brunch!! We love that they have fresh pressed juices. Ask about the juice of the day or fresh lemonade. We always order the lemon poppy seed pancake and the MTO breakfast!!! We have always had excellent service. Ryan is our favorite and even when we aren't in his section he still finds a way to make sure we are taken care of!!!!!! Thanks Ryan and thanks MTO we will continue to come and bring all of our friends when they come and visit! We are wowed every time we come in this place!"}
{"text":"Very nice small restaurant I found online by others reviews. It's across City hall in downtown and I really enjoyed the food and ambiance, but bewared it's small and gets crowded at lunch time when all the buildings around go on their lunch breaks.
A little more pricy than I would have liked for what I ordered but I will be back"}
{"text":"They make the best omelets out of anybody, hands down. Would definitely go back when I'm in Vegas again!"}
{"text":"MTO cafe is all here for you to make you serve out at the best.  If you are looking to have something really delicious for breakfast, then why to choose anyone else when there is MTO Cafe for you. 

They have the super friendly and really welcoming environment. Their main specialty falls inside the Hale (sic) Caesar, and the spinach pecan, plus apple almond. 

Although they do not have the bathroom service which is their main drawback for sure. But overall their quality of food is unbeatable."}
{"text":"Nice café, stopped here for breakfast. My boyfriend got the Steak & Eggs and iced coffee, and I got the Huevos Rancheros. We both loved our breakfast :) Friendly service and they have 2 clean restrooms/bathrooms. One for women, which they label \"eggs\", and another for men which they label \"sausages\". Nice, cute humor. Overall, happy with our experience and would recommend.

PS. I did the check-in for the free choco chip cookie!"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good.  

Philly sammich: 4/5
Waffles: 4/5
Cheese kids sammich: 3/5
Apple donuts 4/5

Service: 5/5

My only complaint was the size.  The restaurant is small, and walking in between the tables were a challenge.  They seemed to be losing alot of business while we were there.  People would walk in and walk right back out because there were no tables available."}
{"text":"Food was good. Service was just so slow as to be laughable. 30 mins wait for our meals when there were about 2 other tables with people in the entire restaurant? There was also a mishap with a bird pooping on our toast. Replacement toast took 15 mins- because of course that is what it takes to toast bread. Disappointing."}
{"text":"You know it's good when you come two days in a row!!! Everything about this place is awesome.  We loved the food, service and the atmosphere. No complaints this way. Whenever I'm in Vegas I will be sure to stop here. MTO is my new Vegas favs for breakfast/brunch. You are definitely winning if you eat here !"}
{"text":"I work at the mall and I ordered Huevos Rancheros on my break. I usually love MTO. The food is great and it is a nice place to eat, a little pricey for the food that they have, but I've never minded paying a little more until today. When I got my food the girl who delivered it was very sweet, but when I opened it I found that my food had literally been thrown in the box. It was good, but it was a mess. I was thoroughly disappointed."}
{"text":"The food is absolutely overpriced and the service is awful. I frequent Downtown Summerlin almost daily and not only was my order completely inaccurate, I ended up paying over $30 for a kids meal and a turkey melt. In addition, my daughter came on a separate occasion and ordered 3 of the same exact smoothie and they managed to mess that up. We're done!"}
{"text":"Wow! Found them on yelp and loved the egg sandwich. Very friendly staff. Also, prices are super affordable because we were off the strip!"}
{"text":"Great food...even better service. Place can get busy but they worked well as a team. I believe Mary was our server's name, she was awsome. Must try a skillet for breakfast."}
{"text":"MTO Cafe is Skinny Fat's easily accessible cousin. Their food is reminiscent of Skinny Fat's healthy options and matches their prices.

The cafe is order first, then sit. My boyfriend and I arrived at 1pm on a Saturday and found sitting no problem (luckily spaces were available after we ordered). They serve breakfast all day and that's what we both opted for.  I was craving pancakes but I can't fathom spending $14 on speciality pancakes with no sides included. Instead I ordered a veggie skillet with no mushrooms for $11 (I think) and my boyfriend got the MTO breakfast (meat and hash browns, which MTO calls mash browns) for $14. We both got iced coffees for $3 each. 

The food looked delicious and it was tasty! Their spam (part of the MTO breakfast) was cooked to perfection.  There was plenty of food to share. Their mashbrowns are a little soft (but I prefer crispier hash browns). I enjoyed my veggie skillet. I wish the potatoes were softer but that didn't stop me from eating everything!

Looking at the other food people ordered, their pancakes looked aesthetically pleasing and their sandwich bread looked buttered and toasted to make a perfect crunch. Next time I return I might opt for a sandwich!

My boyfriend and I left content and full. MTO Cafe is a nice brunch spot (there is no alcohol options here, so might not be ideal for everyone!) without leaving a guilty feeling inside your stomach."}
{"text":"This is one of the best, if not the best breakfast place in Vegas. I have read how great .eat and Babystacks is, but how come no one has written about this one??? I compare it to Snooze in San Diego (originally from Colorado). Modern interiors. Great service. Great semi-healthy and unhealthy food. 

Had the vegan coconut carrot pancake. It's delicious because it's light and not overly sweet. The combination for carrots and coconut is interesting. But it's a large portion. Couldn't finish my 3 huge pancakes. I got some of my boyfriend's Kentucky fried chicken. Yum! I'm sorry but the hash browns in Vegas suck... Except for this one. Delicious! I finished my boyfriend's hash. We'll be back! 

Note: It's right across the city hall and the bus station. Park in the street before Main (metered parking) because there's no street parking in the street where MTO is."}
{"text":"We went here for a little brunch to celebrate a family holiday. I ordered chorizo & eggs in a skillet. Now I don't know where you come from but a breakfast skillet that I am used to is totally full with eggs, meat & potatoes. I would be surprised if this was a two-egg omelet because it was in the middle of a skillet with a tiny amount of hash browns & a smattering of chorizo & small amount of avocado. All this for $11 & I had to eat again afterward because it so small. Now come on MTO give your customers what they paid for & put some more food on the plate!! I know food costs & breakfast is the highest margin meal to serve!!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast and STRONG coffee! Parking in the attached garage can be a challenge, though."}
{"text":"The really do mean comfort food. Heavy large portions. Pretty setup and good, but my mood didn't match the gravity of the food. Not in a rush to come back. Fresh squeezed juice was quite good."}
{"text":"You can't seat your customers because you're open yet closed because your staff is watching Superbowl?  Turning away business for some arbitrary reason?  We were going to join our friends for lunch until we heard they gave this flimsy excuse!  Seriously!"}
{"text":"MTO its been my favorite place for breakfast/brunch, but today they really disappoint me.Today I decided to ordered the Turkey teriyaki burger, and scrambled eggs with sausage for my son. My son's order came out 1st, when I was cutting the sausage I notice a black hair in the eggs. I told my waitress about it and she nicely apologized and changed my son's order. 
About my hamburger I notice my meat had a weird bad taste. I didn't finished it at all. Came home and started to feel sick of my stomach, chills, and vomiting. For some reason I feel that the hamburger made me sick. 
I love this place since the 1st time I visited it. But today was not my day eating at MTO."}
{"text":"The BLTAE is one of the best breakfast sandwiches in town! It's like your standard BLT fused with avocado toast, plus the pop of pesto and two eggs, served open-faced on thick-cut grilled brioche. It's even more fantastic than it sounds (and looks!), and I'd come back to their inconvenient downtown location with annoying garage parking just to have it again.

My guy raved just as much about the lemon poppy seed pancakes, though I would have appreciated more of the blueberry-ginger compote. I'm not much of a sugar for breakfast person, but we'll be coming back for the carrot and coconut version soon. 

NOTE: Full menu available even at opening, which means you can channel your inner five year old and order mac and cheese for breakfast! Unfortunately, I found the Ritz-cracker crust unnecessarily thick and salty, and the noodles overcooked. It may be best to stick to bfast options after all."}
{"text":"This was the first bite of food I had in Vegas and I was not disappointed! Their huevos rancheros on top of mash browns (mashed taters sandwiches between layers of hashbrowns! Get these.) we're smashing and the lemon poppy seed pancakes were slap-your-mama good! 

The loss of a star for me is because Lavazza coffee was served - which was kind of disappointing considering they're in the art district and there are so many great local roasters to support instead."}
{"text":"Ok, we're sold. The reviews are what brought us here, and it's not just hype! I had the MTO Breakfast Low Carb style with no potatoes and no bread. They replaced them with a full beautifully presented avacado. It was absolutely delicious. My husband got the Chicken In A Waffle and he cleaned the plate! I redeemed my Yelp Check -In Offer for a free warm chocolate chip cookie (that hubby ate-evil carbs!) and he, who is ridiculously picky about his chocolate chip cookies, LOVED it. He ate it slowly so he could savor it.  :) 
Let's not forget the service. The staff here is so chill, so laid back, yet 100% on their game! Smiles, friendly attitudes, we loved it. Steve, our server, gets 5 stars from us. We would happily sit in his section again! Thanks MTO, we love you!"}
{"text":"Great place and food is incredibly delicious  :) Server loves people and love what they are doing. Place looking relaxing and farmer veggie on the side order will be more greater than what you expect :) only its served in a small coffee cup smaller than the cup they serve your coffee in  :)"}
{"text":"MTO is one of those places that everyone raves about.  All my friends are always telling me how great it is.  Even my husband had nothing but wonderful things to say about MTO.  Fast forward to my visit - Meh.  Just meh.

The restaurant itself is beautiful and I really like the concept of farm fresh food cooked to order but with a slightly eclectic menu.  That's about where the good ends for me.  First of all, this place is in the so called 'arts' district of Las Vegas.  The area is up and coming but still has a lot of coming left to do.  I am no stranger to downtown - I work right off of Fremont, so I'm used to the re-gentrified-but-not-quite all the way there vibe.  It's kind of dicey & the parking situation is terrible.  We went on a not-so-busy morning & could not find street parking anywhere.  We had to park in the garage, which isn't that big of a deal.  I suppose in that area, your car would be safer in the garage anyhow.  

The food was good.. not great.  I had a waffle and a side of bacon.  This is what really got me though - the waffle was the size of an Ego (you know, the frozen kind you can buy in your grocer's freezer section) and cost $9.  NINE DOLLARS.  For one waffle.  The bacon was an extra $3.  I'm no huge cheapskate - I'll shell out the $$ for a great meal - but for crying out loud... For $9, there should be at least two waffles & some powdered sugar on top.  

My husband and the rest of our party enjoyed their salmon skillet breakfast dish very much, so I think this is a case of 'It really depends on what you order'.  Some dishes are obviously better than others.  I'm sure I'll give MTO another shot at some point.  I'll try something other than the waffle."}
{"text":"First time here and we will definitely be coming back. My husband ordered the steak and eggs and I had the avocado omelette with side of bacon and a pancake. Well I should've ordered a complete order of pancakes. They were delicious. Nice and fluffy, the batter was perfect and the they were so soft. The omelette had a tomatillo salsa on top that was a very nice compliment to the fluffy eggs. I can't say enough about our meal. Very pleased without a doubt. All I can say is everything was FRESH !!!! The staff is super friendly and the service was fast and efficient."}
{"text":"Was ok. Nothing to brag about just a place to eat when you are hungry...won't recommend at any rate."}
{"text":"This is a decent breakfast place. We visited before leaving town. We had the steak breakfast tacos which were good. It was well cooked but nothing fantastic. The sauces that came on the side were super good though. We ordered a special breakfast sandwich, it had two eggs, jack cheese, chipotle aioli, and I substituted ham and bacon instead of the sausage. It was good, but all the flavors were sweet so it ended up being a bit too rich for breakfast. I couldn't eat even half of it before I got a stomachache. The mashed hash browns were fabulous though. Overall a good breakfast place with nice service. Nothing to write home about though."}
{"text":"So you better come here early...because everything I wanted on the menu they were out of! Bottomless mimosas...Out! I was so looking forward to it. My Sunday brunch in Vegas kinda ruined. Then I order a salmon omelette and their out of that too! Come on! Ended up just getting a fruit cup. Thanks a lot MTO cafe for ruining my Sunday brunch :)"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots to eat at in Las Vegas. The food is outstanding and in my opinion, affordable for what you get. I've had the hangover burger, which had so much flavor, and the fried egg added a great touch! But the most delicious dish I had was the B.L.T.A.E! If you come here, you absolutely need to order it! They give you a big portion and everything in the sandwich is heavenly! MTO is the place to be!!"}
{"text":"The two of us came in around noon on a Sunday and got seated right away. Good sized place but I can see it may get crowded. Very clean and lights of light.

Our waiter, Ryan, was friendly and awesome. He was very attentive and didn't bother us during our meal (hehe), only during appropriate times.

My BF ordered the denver omelet and loved it. I ordered the veggie has without mushroom and really LOVED it. It came w eggs over hashed brown, broccoli, spinach, roasted tomatoes, onion and mushroom. SO GOOD! And reasonably priced, unlike Du-par's which we had yesterday. (Thumbs down.)

Wish they had a location in LA. We'll definitely be returning here on our next Vegas trip."}
{"text":"Really good, once again.  Interesting dishes.  Fresh, hot, coming back again next time!"}
{"text":"great healthy food for great price!!! huge portion. i love this place. worth my first yelp review"}
{"text":"Came for breakfast...amazing! Just off the beaten path of downtown. Seems to be a local spot for all the City Hall employees. Service was great. Had to have the \"Fat Elvis\" since I was in Vegas, and it didn't disapoint."}
{"text":"This was an expensive 18.00 sandwich, and it fell apart.  Was mushy as well.  Parking in Downtown Summerlin was a disaster."}
{"text":"This was probably one of the best lunches I've had! I prefer it because not only so they have a variety of options but fresh juices and healthy options and amazing espresso! My mom had the juice of the day and I did the green juice. The food was fresh and taste and the service was on point and had answers to any of our questions!"}
{"text":"By far the best breakfast skillet I ever had! The coffee was on point. The chicken and waffles and French toast were delicious. Highly recommend others to come and try it out"}
{"text":"Holy cow!  This place is amazing.  FRESH local food sourced locally and stored only in refrigerators with no freezers or microwaves in existence.  

Best breakfast we had in Vegas; the blueberries, strawberries, and blackberries were great accents to our meal, and I loved that they have real lettuce (arugula, greens) versus non-nutritional man-created iceberg lettuce.  

This place just opened 2 months ago so it's still relatively unknown by mainstreamers making it fast, quaint, and personable.  It's family run versus corporate and so there's a lot of pride in how this place operates even by staff.  

Every booth has outlets that are USB ready.  How convenient!!

Parking is free on the street on Sunday.  Conveniently located next to the Mob Museum, Neon Museum, Fremont Street Experience, and Pawn Stars."}
{"text":"Great food, very unique combinations blended together to make a great taste. I had a chicken dish what was very well cooked, still moist with a well tasting fried crust. Was laid over tasteful hash browns and had fluffy eggs and delicious gravy covering both. 

Very calm and relaxed environment.

Service was good, mine and my dates water did bottom out once and we had to wait a little longer than expected for the check but nothing to really fault them for. 

Looking forward to returning and trying other dishes to see what else they have to offer."}
{"text":"MTO Cafe is first and foremost extremely overpriced. The food you receive both in amount and quality does not meet the price. It is ok food. Nothing to write home to mom about and it is drenched in oil and butter. My office has gotten good to go from there a few times and each time the to go box is drenched in oil. I would never personally eat here if I was paying for it myself but I only get the food when my boss buys so it's better than nothing but wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"My sister looked for places to eat while we were staying in downtown Freemont and I'm so happy she found this place.  We went here on a Sunday morning hungry and ready to eat.  We were staying at the Plaza and decided to walk there.  I was a bit worried because it looked like we were walking away from the restaurants.  It wasn't hard to find, walked in to a warm building, and loved the decor and variety of music they were playing.  They had an outlet at the booth we sat at, service was attentive, and food was delicious!  I ordered the steak and egg breakfast plate."}
{"text":"I've been back a couple of times since I wrote my first review.  Most recently I had the avocado omelet (red onions, cilantro, jalapeno peppers, jack cheese, topped with avocado and tomatillo sauce) and it was really, really good.  Super filling too.  Lots of cheese, jalapenos, and that tomatillo sauce was perfect.  It didn't come with potatoes but it was so large I couldn't even finish it so the lack of a side wasn't an issue. I tried the MTO juice this time and damn, it was freaking delicious.
On another visit, I had the Falafel (chick peas, tomato, lettuce, onion, balsamic tahini on unleavened bread + simple greens ) and it was quite good as well. 
The consistency of the quality of food has made this place a must for me whenever I visit Vegas.
The only downside for me on this most recent visit was the service.  I'm not sure if our server was new or what but she pretty much ignored us and we were helped by a smattering of other people.  When she came over to take our drink order we tried to order food too but she took off as soon as we told her our drinks and from that point, we really didn't see her again.  Maybe she delivered our drinks? But she certainly didn't take our food order when she did.  Not a single person checked on us after our food was brought over (by another person that wasn't our server).  No one asked if we needed anything else. Luckily we didn't and the food was great.  I had to flag down someone else to get the check to finally get out of there.
I won't let the experience deter me because the food is that good and hopefully it was a fluke."}
{"text":"My dad an I stopped in based on Yelp review. I had the KFC  and he had steak and eggs. Both were excellent! Two words... Damn Good! Thanks."}
{"text":"We came here for brunch on a Wednesday morning. The place has a nice modern cafe look with high ceilings and some booths and some shared seating tables. The staff is super friendly. Our server, Lisa, was amazing!

I ordered the Steak & Eggs, with my 6oz steak medium and my 3 eggs over easy. Oh boy oh boy, the steak was seasoned so well I didn't even need the A1 sauce!!! And believe me that is saying something cuz I always need a sauce with steak. My husband ordered the Huevos Rancheros with mash browns (basically hash brown). Both dishes were awesome!!! I totally finished mine except for half a toast and my husband left just a bite or two too. Honestly it was delicious! Definitely worth a try, or maybe two or three :)

Oh and don't forget to check in for your free chocolate chip cookie!"}
{"text":"Even better than the last time. I went with one of my dearest friends and let me tell you. This woman is THE MOST COMPLICATED PERSON I HAVE EVER KNOWN and the waitress was stellar. Food always awesome. Definitely try the apple pies. Make some room at the end of the meal. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"My son & I had late lunch here today, our first time dining here. We had a great experience. Food is great, it's a bit pricey but the serving is big amount and food is good. They can use a better to go box."}
{"text":"Such a cute cafe! Service was excellent. Kentucky fried chicken breakfast was excellent. Coffee was excellent... Husband had avocado omelet... And clam chowder with was also very good!!"}
{"text":"This is a solid restaurant. I especially loved the decor and friendly staff. Ultimately, it comes down to the food, and the food to me was meh. It was okay but nothing great. 

I had the avocado skillet. Besides the tomatillo, which was great, the rest of the dish was very average. I wish my potatoes had more flavor. My sister had the chicken and waffles. Neither were very good, even with the gravy. Both lacked the flavor or kick I was looking for."}
{"text":"This place is great! 

Its a nice little trndy spot off the strip by City Hall. Everything we had was great and the service was very friendly. The portions are large.I  would rather eat here than a buffet. 

Side note: This is owned by a gentleman in the military. I will be back to support the place next time I am in Vegas not only because it was good, but because we need to support our military."}
{"text":"This was my second visit, both were for breakfast.
This visit was early on a Sunday morning and the music was too loud and energetic for an early morning.
Personally, that really affected my experience.
In addition to that, my meal was the MTO Special (I believe?) it was $14 & enough for 3 people.
It was a bit excessive.
It also cost us $3 to park."}
{"text":"I came across this spot as I arrived to the summerlin shops to do a little shopping. Upon entering I was greeted by a guy standing at the cash register. I was indecisive so I asked what his favorite was. He asked breakfast or lunch. I told him lunch so he told me the spicy chicken sandwich was his favorite and offered one other suggestion. I decided to try the spicy chicken sandwich. When I got my order it was a pretty big size! After took my first bite I couldn't stop. It was definitely good! I got a side of ranch and noticed immediately it was unlike regular ranch. The guy told me it was made in house! For you ranch lovers out there.. you must try! This place deserves 5 stars...very friendly service, and the food was good! Would recommend to a friend and also would return! :D"}
{"text":"Service was the worst part of this visit! The menu seems really good and tasty but if they can't get your order right and they don't serve everyone at the table at the same time it kills your lunch experience. My mother's order was the worst. She ordered the teriyaki steak bowl. The bowl came out about 10 minutes after the rest of the orders first of all. Secondly, she ended up only eating the steak because the rice was swimming, literally swimming in teriyaki sauce. It was like teriyaki soup with rice. My mom not wanting to complain too much didn't mention it to me until we were all done and she had finished most of the steak. So she went to the counter just to tell them hat they messed up the order, not asking for anything in return but just to make them aware of the type of dishes they are serving. My husband had ordered fries with his sandwich and was given a salad. They made that up by giving him a side of fries but the fries he was given looked like the bottom of the fryer fries, all scrape pieces and over cooked. My salad was ok but my chicken didn't seem to be grilled more like defrosted chicken and now that I think of it, I'm not sure if the dressing was on there or not. Anyways, we won't be back and I just hope they work out their quality control."}
{"text":"So I went back with a friend who knows how to order here.  It was so tasty & lots of food. 

A completely different experience than I had last time although my friend says the other location is waaaay better. 

My friend says eggs are organic. Did not hear that from the staff do please double check. 
The hash browns are their signature potatoes & they were unusual & unexpected. It seems like they are hash brown potatoes wrapped around mashed potatoes.  Very unusual. I had to kind of taste it a few time. I Liked It. Very different, try them. 

The eggs were absolutely perfectly cooked! Over medium & they were exactly that. 

The meats on my special were assorted. I am not a spam fan so that went to waste. 

I wish they had an option for the bread. I skipped it as did my friends. So we paid for it & got no other choice. I think this could be improved on. 

The bacon was crispy & tasted great. 

I got some kind of a chocolate or carib drink that was very good.  

It is a menu that could be better understood with photos. For a new person like me, it is off putting.  I hope they add a photo menu or iPad or screen or something to help new people order. 

Sitting outside, it was extremely pleasant. 

Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Loved it here.  The cafe was clean, orderly, open and airy.  The breakfast was divine and the ingredients (Organic and Local) are perfect.  We enjoyed ourselves and our meal was very satisfying."}
{"text":"Really, really wanted to like this place. But alas, food just ok. For the $, totally not worth it... Doughnuts sucked- don't waste your $7 for 3 tiny, dry things. Latte up-charged $1 for vanilla syrup. Seriously??! Located attached to parking garage for which, wait for it, they don't validate. And there was piece of plastic wrap in our skillet. Service not great, but that may vary with your server."}
{"text":"Love MTO. Friendly staff, and several delicious options to choose from. Good for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Be sure to check it out if you're around Downtown Summerlin."}
{"text":"We visit MTO at least once a week, and it is always great. Staff is friendly, and food always comes out right"}
{"text":"My boyfriend's mother and aunt 
Lurrrrved the chicken
Tender and crisp
The skillets were eggcellent 
And the coffee on point 
Full disclosure:
I got a cookie to write this
But a liar I am not
Will come again"}
{"text":"Easy parking, killer menu, delicious juice juices, friendly service.  The owner comes to every table and makes sure the experience is perfect.  Can't wait to visit again."}
{"text":"Food was tasty and the staff was nice, but didn't seem to rush despite the long line. It took 30+ minutes to get our two sandwiches like other reviewers have mentioned.  We asked for a to go box at the end and the waitress smiled and said \"oops, forgot!\"  All well, but when coupled with the slow movement of the staff, generally, you realize that there is a complacency and lack of urgency at this location.  Even after 2 years of reviews stating the service is mediocre, there doesn't seem to be improvement.  Anyone listening?  I don't see myself coming back here."}
{"text":"This place should have a better rating. Great breakfast/brunch food. If you're in the area - check it out."}
{"text":"We went here for Sunday brunch. They have plenty of seating.

Food: We got the avocado and yoga pants omelet. Avocado omelet was pretty yummy. However, both the omelets were overcooked. The hash browns are extra but were very delicious.

Service: Good, no complaints.

Ambience: Super casual."}
{"text":"This is my second time here. I was very impressed not only with the service, but also with the turkey melt. Having worked in the F&B industry for 18 years, I can be hyper critical. There were 3 servers in particular that all grabbed my attention; 2 female and 1 male. The restaurant was bustling and they all had a cool composure, able to multi-task, communicate, prioritize guest needs, friendly, etc. The turkey melt was grilled to perfection and had a wonderful blend of flavors. Don't forget to ask for parking validation, as you'll get 90 minutes free."}
{"text":"Cute spot for breakfast food! It's located close to Fremont Street, but sort of off the beaten path. I think that it is across the street from City Hall, and judging by the suits, it seems like many of the people who frequent this spot work there. However, the place it self has sort of a hippy vibe. I'm a huge fan of the large windows letting in natural light, the mix of booths and high top tables. 
Their menu is mostly breakfast food, and then typical american food (hamburgers, salads, and sandwiches). Everything on the menu sounded pretty good -- seemed \"wholesome\" and mostly healthy. 
I ordered the avocado skillet and my friend ordered the broccoli omelette. Both were good! They had plenty of \"stuff\" in them (I hate it when they skimp on the filling). We also got a side order of seasonal veggies. It was a bit odd that they put hashbrowns at the bottom of the skillet. Personally, I would have preferred breakfast potatoes or something that I could mix in more with the eggs. They veggies seemed a bit over cooked, but the vignette they put on it was good! Everything was solid -- all tasty and well done. Nothing was mind-blowing awesome, but everything was really good."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place with bottomless mimosas! Sherolyn is a fantastic server--attentive, great stories, great attitude! Delicious waffles with berries!!! AND bottomless mimosas :)"}
{"text":"THE BOB
organic chicken, arugula, roasted tomatoes, jack & cheddar, pecan honey mustard on wheat + fries

Everyone should basically just get that and thank me later. The fries are really good. 

Service is friendly. Prices are fair.
A great casual restaurant in summerlin and it is much better than other similar concepts nearby, IMO"}
{"text":"I have to say...I fell in love with MTO. Other than getting a parking ticket in the city lot attached, this place was top notch.

First off, be aware it's not a huge joint. There are about 8 tables and long tall bar to sit at. But at noon on a Tuesday we didn't have to wait. The service was top drawer. We had a very friendly chica and she was willing to give her opinion on different options.

Kids ate off the kids menu. The 11 year old had chicken fingers that he deemed the \"best he's every had.\" They were definitely of the fresh variety and not frozen. Came with fries.  Daughter had spaghetti that she ate a ton of. It was a nice size portion too. 

I wanted a patty melt. In fact, I've been craving one for weeks. But I don't like beef so I asked if they would make me one with turkey. I didn't want the sauce...but they forgot and put it on. Truthfully, it was delicious so I didn't mind. A great burger, very very flavorful. Hubs had the ruben which he devoured. I guess he liked it. :)

This is a spot you should check out if you are ever in the downtown neighborhood."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh! I've died and gone to heaven! Chicken and waffles are the best! So glad it's a block from home! Never thought I'd see the day this mall and restaurants would be here!"}
{"text":"Went the other day for a work lunch.   The openness is nice and that they have power outlets a plenty was a welcomed addition. 

The food was good and the service was great. 

I found they had an online coupon here in yelp for a free cookie.   The waitress apologized they ran out.   I joked I was going to write a bad review.   A few minutes later the general manager came out with a fresh baked cookie.   She told us how the waitress was panicked about what I said.   The GM took it all in stride and went above and beyond. 

Thanks for the customer service."}
{"text":"Had the MTO Breakfast and my friend had the Huevos Rancheros. Both were really good! I'll be back in Vegas in October and definitely going back to this place! Oh, and the customer service was awesome as well! Thanks MTO!"}
{"text":"Okay for the price. I got the hen house which is basically a chicken cesar wrap. It was $11 and came with a giant bowl of fries. The wrap was on the smaller side so I feel like I paid more for the fries than the wrap. Both were good but not that impressive. I wanted to try the chicken pot pie but I wasnt hungry enough. Maybe next time!

Service was fair when I did have to encounter the staff. After placing our orders, we headed outside to wait for our food. Our table had about 5 order numbers which I understand is quite a bit for one group but the server got mixed up a few times. He grabbed wrong numbers to take back after serving certain items. This caused mishaps and somehow they forgot about an order completely. My friend had to go back inside and ask what was going on. They said they were working on it but he didn't get his food until we were all pretty much done with everything. This was odd since another friend ordered the same exact thing!

At the end of my meal, I went back inside to ask for a box to take home leftovers. I stood at the counter for a good 5 minutes before someone finally realized I was there. I can't imagine how annoyed I would be if I was walking  in for the first time and waiting to order something! A manager came up to apologize but they could definitely work on being more attentive to the counter."}
{"text":"Everything was fresh and delicious. The chorizo wrap was tasty (don't forget to add cheese) and don't miss the awesome fried apple rings:-)"}
{"text":"I compare this restaurant to \"EAT\" which is also downtown.  You should try both of them.  MTO is great, I always have excellent service, smiles, and the quality of food is excellent.  THANK YOU!"}
{"text":"Came to catch up with a friend.  I saw this on yelp and overlooked it.  Then I saw a great photo on Instagram by @unlokt  decided to try it. It is located right in front of a parking garage.  Seemed to be the only parking there.  Ashley was our server.  I wanted the green drink, but I don't like celery.  The drink is premade so you can't customize it.  I ordered the Fat Elvis. Thick and goey French toast with Nutella, banana, and BACON in the middle, garnished with strawberries, blueberries, and blackberries. I think the bacon smothered in all that Nutella was the best part!  Very yummy!   Ashley was super attentive, I feel bad we were so busy chit chatting we probably stayed 20min too long.  They close at 2pm, I thought there were other customers, but upon leaving realized they all work there. Unfortunately they only validate $1.50 (1 hour) of your parking as well."}
{"text":"Visited this spot and was yet again very pleased.  Tried the waffle with berries and of course the mini donuts. Both were amazing. 

If your hungry definitely recommend the MTO breakfast. It has everything and more!!!

Mike, the GM was great, stopped by our table and made sure our visit was enjoyable."}
{"text":"By far one of my favorite spots in the entire country! I travel a ton nationwide for work and I use Yelp for just about every place I ever eat. I've had the pleasure of eating here on numerous occasions on business trips to Vegas and I have never been disappointed. The staff are super friendly and the service is amazing.  The food is fantastic!  You cannot go wrong with a single thing on the menu!"}
{"text":"Came for brunch, looked empty on the outside but was surprised to find that the place was full of people upon entering! I came on a Saturday about noon, I suggest to maybe come early. We were seated within 5 minutes so that was good. I ordered the salmon over hash with 2 eggs sunny side up. I was expecting a good amount of salmon but it was just 1 slice of lox. The meal was still yummy, tomatoes were amazingly seasoned. I had to order a side of bacon because the hash seemed Bare without any meat and that one piece of salmon. My boyfriend had the hangover burger and loved it! They offer an all you can drink option of mimosa and I think it was beer? Which is awesome. We didn't get it this time , maybe next time. Ambience is great, very modern. The staff was good too, very attentive, I think the manager also came to check on us and was helping the staff with serving food which is really nice to see. They offer healthy choices on menu too. Reasonably priced. Overall, I would come again and try their other entrees."}
{"text":"First time delicious!  Home cooked quality comfort food with an  eclectic menu. Ssssooooo good.  Looking forward to a return visit"}
{"text":"Two words come to mind - overpriced and mediocre.

I went to MTO last weekend with a girlfriend, her son and my little brother. We arrived around 11, and the place was pretty packed. The menu was fairly limited, but I settled on the Hangover Burger and ordered the BLTAE for my little guy. I about choked when she told me my total.. I could have been served and paid much less. I guess they use better ingredients, but you really can't tell in the final product.

Our food came out promptly, and I was expecting greatness. The burger was smothered in some sort of sauce - maybe thousand island and iceberg lettuce. The whole entire time I was eating this concoction I was thinking of Smashburger's Sin City burger, which is about half the cost and 1000 times more tasty. 

There is no reason to ever return. There are plenty of other options in DS. Skip this one!"}
{"text":"This place is 5 starts all the way. Open, bright, and very inviting motif. If you're looking for an awesome breakfast away from the crowds on the strip this is jewel tucked away downtown. The service was impeccable as well as the food. Our food was served fast, hot, and fresh. My friend had the avocado skillet she said it was very tasty.  I had the BLTAE it was amazing. Cooked just right.  This will definitely be a spot that I return to when in Vegas"}
{"text":"Decided to try something new on vacation, and boy I'm glad we did. The service and the food was amazing! If you are in Vegas and looking a for some great food, this definitely the place to stop!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious! Yummy comfort foods with a little twist. I had a skillet which was very yummy, needed a little salt, but hit the breakfast spot and was loaded with potatoes. My friends got the chicken in a waffle which was heavenly, but very rich. The gravy on top just makes it. 

Be sure to check in and get your freebie :)"}
{"text":"It's just too overpriced for how below mediocre the quality is. Even if it was moderately priced it's still not good food in my opinion. I had a burger and would have preferred any of the basic burger places to it. It's got a good idea (business model wise) but I don't know why they think they can charge that much money for how bland their food is. I didn't like the downtown location either."}
{"text":"Really Good! I had the body builder which is egg whites and veggies. Added avacado. Amazing :) I will return"}
{"text":"Bad first impression. Went in with a coworker who had previously had an awesome experience and was excited to share. There was a large group of guys sitting nearby who were being overly loud and cursing left and right. It sounded like a bar in there and no staff member or manager said a word to them. It was obvious that they were bothering the majority of the people dining at that time. Our server only checked on us once, our salads were mediocre, my coworker actually left hers alone after only three bites (the server didn't even notice this or ask if there was anything wrong with it), and once he picked up our bill he went and sat down at a booth with a group of girls he was obviously friendly with instead of running our bill. The previously excited coworker vowed not to return, and although I was excited and had waited a while to try out MTO, I think I'm good on it now. There are plenty of other options downtown that offer better service."}
{"text":"Food is great been here three times and tried something different everytime haven't been disappointed. Service is great and food is fresh."}
{"text":"The breakfast skillet can't be beat! Eggs are perfectly fluffly, veggies done right over flavorful hash browns in an iron skillet. cappuccino paired nicely.  
They also have a tomato soup on the lunch menu that is delicious and not a heavy cream base but a true tomato base soup with fresh basil in it. Spot on."}
{"text":"If I could leave less than a star I would, staff was grumpy and unattentive, dining room had 2 tables active as I walked in to order takeout, had 3 people say \"right with you\", 10 minutes later still no service. Took by business down the street"}
{"text":"This place was great.  I had never been Downtown before, but I'll definitely be back.  The waitress was great, the food was awesome.  We had bottomless mimosas and there was never an empty glass.  They played great music and it was overall a great brunch!"}
{"text":"My little brother and I gave this place a try and both ended up getting severe food poisoning. Honestly, wasn't impressed with the taste of the food either. I've never written a bad review, but wanted to warn others if they were thinking about trying this place out."}
{"text":"Although the staff was friendly, the customer service was absolutely terrible. I ordered three simple drinks. A coffee, a vanilla latte, and a hot chocolate. We sat down, expecting our drinks to be ready within few minutes, just as we would wait at other cafes. We waited nearly 20 minutes until we finally decided to depart and demand a refund. In that time, two other groups of people were served their drinks within a few minutes of placing their orders. One party consisted of six people in which they all ordered a drink. At the demand of our refund the manager openly said,\"I'm sorry. Our priorities are backwards.\" Um? Sir, if your priorities are backwards I'm not too sure you should be operating a cafe."}
{"text":"Ugh, I want to love you! I had good experience at the MTO downtown but as pretty as this place is, it failed so bad on just my coffee. Which is sacred to me. It was cold and windy and there MTO was in all its orange glory. I walked in, was greeted with great smiles and ordered a simple latte. Like I said, I dined at the MTO downtown so I was ready to enjoy this coffee when it tasted like steamed milk. I popped to the top off to see what it looked like steamed milk with a splash espresso. The color was so wrong and so was the purchase. I brought it back to have one remade and again, although slightly better - it wasn't what it should be. So anyway...."}
{"text":"I think we found a new favorite breakfast place in Las Vegas!  Totally worth to drive here from your casino.  The ambiance is great, modern building and the food is simply delicious.  Then French toast was according to my 11 y.o is the best he's ever had.  Omelette was done perfectly, and my hen wrap was amazing.   Oh and - how can you beat bottomless mimosas?   Bookmarking this place and will be visiting it again for sure."}
{"text":"Food is delicious!!! Their menu is awesome and the service is wonderful!!! Their cronut burger is amazing!!! And they give large portions! Mac n cheese is to die for!!! We'll definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"When you're working the Las Vegas Market and just need to get away for a few for some decent food and a fun atmosphere,  this place is just a quick walk away.  It may look like you can't get there from here, but it's a lot easier than it seems and the food and service is worth it.  Get the skillet with the mash-browns oh and a cup of their coffee."}
{"text":"I decided to check this place out with my coworkers. It's a cute, bright, modern, casual, hipster joint where you order at the counter, they give you a #, and bring out your food. We ordered the chicken in a waffle, queso fundido, 5 cheese mac-n-cheese, and an avocado skillet. Our food came out fast, probably less than five minutes. I enjoyed everything I tasted. Service is efficient and they came by often to check up on us and take away our plates when we were done.

The only thing that threw me off - I was going to get a cup of soup with my mac-n-cheese but was told they only offer bowls so I didn't order soup. I didn't want to eat that much since I was already ordering a heavy, comfort meal. It bugs me when restaurants don't offer what's in writing. Other than that, I thought the food was good enough for me to come back. My coworkers and I liked it so I'm sure we will be back."}
{"text":"Delish! Great place for breakfast! One of my new favorites in Vegas.... The gentleman even gave me additional fruit for free when I let him know of my food allergies and he thought my good touched something that I was allergic to. Great service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Interesting place for Breakfast in Downtown Summerlin this past Sunday (Nov 8)! More of a Fast Food process for ordering, then they give you table a number and deliver the food to you. Drinks were self-served 

I had the Triple Stack and John had the MTO Breakfast. The food was Very Good.. Eggs were cooked as we ordered. The portions are huge so 2 people could actually share one meal. We took a to go box that was pretty full home. It was pretty busy and the service was very good. I would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Great new downtown breakfast/brunch/lunch place. We ordered two different \"skillets\" which are basically scrambles. The one with tomatillo salsa is divine. We also had the mashed potato stuffed hash browns- loved those! We met Ben, the congenial owner, who insisted we try the fried apple rings- they were excellent. Great service, very nice interior and exterior. My kids loved the etch-a-sketch menus. My husband didn't love the shallow, wide coffee cups (coffee got cold quickly) but the coffee itself was good.  MTO Cafe is a great addition to downtown Las Vegas. We're looking forward to going back and trying many more items on the menu."}
{"text":"I came to mto awhile ago and it was incredible. I got the fat Elvis and I had to take some home. Today is father's day and we came to mto. The Fat Elvis was like an appetizer and the simple fountain drinks were $3.00. I asked the server why it was so small and she said, maybe it's how I'm looking at it. I don't plan on returning."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Menu options are limited but the two plates we got were delicious!! Great comfort food and will definitely be back when in town."}
{"text":"After a delicious first time in, I happily brought my elderly friends in to try the food. 
The food was great. The only problem was the staff. 
Our server Fred had no intuition or common sense. When we asked him for extra napkins, he brought 1 (1!) napkin. He forgot to get my toddler a drink and when he remembered he brought it in an enormous glass cup. Toddlers are fantastic with large full cups. After our food was delivered he checked on us (duly noted, points given) then disappeared for 45 minutes. I had to ask another server for our check, and she seemed so annoyed that we dared to bother her. As for Fred, he was too busy flirting to pay attention to his tables. I hope he got some numbers. 
I understand that hiring a young waitstaff is exciting because they are cute & nice to be around. They can also be inexperienced. That inexperience can come off as arrogance and hurt your business. 
I'll be back, when I do my hair & makeup so I can keep my server's attention, but I won't be bringing my friends or family."}
{"text":"The food was tasteless the service was unprofessional and the prices were 20% over than what I expected for the quality of food we received.  This place has shopping mall fast food ethic with just a trendy name. 
Don't be fooled by a trendy label."}
{"text":"I thought this place was ok..not memorable..sorry.  I do like the decor and all though. I ordered the green juice which is nice since it was a healthy drink option for breakfast.  I also got the chicken apple skillet which was ok..not memorable.  I didn't care for the potatoes under the eggs and chicken...the potatoes reminded me of those potatoes you get at a Buffet at a hotel.

The staff was friendly and attentive.  I don't think I'll be back unless they make a change to make their dish more memorable and different."}
{"text":"I stand corrected, I've been back three times because this little cafe has excellent food. Breakfast is outstanding, try the pancakes or steak and eggs. Dinner very good, in fact I'd rate the quality of their food product better than Crave next door. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"My dad lives in Summerlin and during a recent visit we were on the hunt for an easy place to grab some dinner. He told us about the new shopping center so we decided to see what kinds of food were available there. MTO came back with the best reviews so we picked it.

We all had sandwiches, and I'm so sorry but at this point I can't remember what exactly we ate, BUT I do know that we enjoyed our meals and the giant cookie I got for checking in on Yelp. 

The best part about this restaurant is it's totally casual, but the food is wholesome and tasty and the prices are reasonable. I grabbed a menu for my dad so he could start using this as his go-to to go restaurant when he doesn't feel like cooking."}
{"text":"This place is great! The staff are very friendly and attentive and the food is delicious. I've been here a few times before but I kept forgetting to write a review but my experience today prompted me to do so. First the apple rings...Amazing! Then the orange juice mimosa... Amazing! Last, I tried something new the Huevos Rancheros with mashbrowns...Amazing! It was corn tortilas with scrambled egg on top, which was topped of by salsa and an avocado. I also ordered one lemon poppyseed pancake but it wasn't my favorite. I would recommend this place to anyone that likes good food."}
{"text":"this place is hella cute and has really, really great food. the skillets are fantastic (I got the broccoli skillet and it was killer -- and p healthy!), our server (Rachel?) was awesome, and the owner was so friendly + funny. also I had my first ever bloody mary here and happy to report that it was A+++. overall a fantastic place, 11/10 would recommend."}
{"text":"Okay so first things first. This place is worth the trip. Had some really delicious food AND great service. The servers are really nice and the food is made to order. We came for breakfast/brunch-- and the plates are all HUGE (you may want to share). One thing I didn't like was the prices that you read on the menu, aren't the prices they actually charge you. All our food was $2-4 more when they bought the check, which is super deceiving and should be told to you when ordering. 

Outside of that, this is surely a spot that had great selection. Different types of French toast, omelettes, and food at different levels of \"healthy\" for those that are health conscious."}
{"text":"Been here twice now: lunch on a weekday and brunch on a Saturday. There was no wait for a table either time and parking is very convenient in the garage connected to the restaurant. They even validate parking! ($1.50 off, so you might end up paying 75 cents for an average length brunch)

The place is bright, inviting, and clean. The food is hit or miss. 

Drinks: The coffee is delicious and bottomless mimosa deal is killer at $15. Between their two vegetable/fruit juices, I liked the green juice more than the red. The flavor of the green juice is more citrusy and refreshing. 

Treats: The apple rings are tastier than the donuts. Apple rings are perfectly fluffy with tender apples inside, but the donuts are dense, dry, and lack flavor. More like biscuits than donuts.

Lunch menu: I wasn't crazy about the Hero sandwich, but the Caesar wrap was pretty good and the fries are awesome. 

Brunch menu: We tried the waffle with berries and chicken MTO omelette. I wish the omelette had been served with a side of something more interesting than just plain raw spinach and Roma tomato slices. Both items were pretty good, but not outstanding.

I would go back to try the vegan carrot pecan pancakes and to have the apple rings again! It's a very pleasant place for a leisurely brunch without a long wait time at 11:30 on a Saturday."}
{"text":"Get the KFC! It's great. Customer service here is stellar compared to most spots near the strip."}
{"text":"Good work MTO. This place is perfect. I'm staying at the Plaza and I wanted some proper breakfast food. Most of the options weren't looking too promising here in the \"downtown\" area. I had taken a walk down that Fremont St thing and was worried I was gonna be stuck with some crappy casino/hotel breakfast. So I hopped on Yelp - and I'm very happy I found this place. Great food. Great service. Their high rating here is much deserved."}
{"text":"BLTAE - Bacon, lettuce, tomato avocado & egg on brioche bread. Yum! 

My guest had the Monte Cristo with a side of strawberries. He would have it better separate and not as a sandwich."}
{"text":"Great choice! We came because they use fresh, local ingredients (and the reviews). Will come back again because of the wonderful tastes and the exceptional service. Michelle made sure our coffee cups were always full. 

Definitely worth getting off the strip if you are a visitor (we came from Montana). Plus, you're close to Fremont Street.  Try the fried Apple rings. The sauce on them makes the dish."}
{"text":"A perfect place with nice atmosphere and awesome food. Specializing in brunch, lunch & drinks, they have a menu with good variety for all tastes. I HIGHLY recommend the Kentucky Fried Chicken with fresh avocado slices on the top. If you have chance to do something in downtown area, please stop in and visit. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is the cutest little cafe in Downtown Summerlin! I love the atmosphere and the good vibes right when you walk in!!! All the employees were super nice and kept our table clean as we were eating! They are very kid friendly! A lot of space and plenty of room for highchairs!!! The food was phenomenal! I got the Turkey Melt Sandwich & shared it with my 3 & 1 year old! They don't eat much but it was plenty of food! Their fries, ranch and chipotle sauce are \"bomb\" according to my 3 year old. Lol"}
{"text":"I like it!  I got an brocolli egg white wrap.  I can appreciate the portion of the wrap.  It's hard to make a lot of egg whites taste good, and you guys manage to do so.  Turkey melt was also great.  Those skinny fries are addictive.



Nice addition to downtown, well done.  Great place for a big cup of coffee and hearty food."}
{"text":"I ordered the Chicken Wrap with avocado. It was really yummy! Had eggs, chicken and bell pepper. I ordered it without onions. The side sauces gave it more flavor. And if you check in on yelp, you get a free chocolate cookie which was also delicious."}
{"text":"I WANT to love MTO. But they're inconsistent and their take-out food looks sad!  When dining in, it's delicious and usually fresh and the presentation is decent. When picking up and eating 5 minutes later, the salads are pathetic and contain half as much food (so why am I paying the same price??). And the fries are limp and soggy. Is there a way to keep them crispy?  

I also wish they had gluten free options, not just \"a sandwich with a lettuce wrap\" or soup, but a gluten free wrap or something more!!!  

MTO could do better"}
{"text":"I've only been here once, but I ordered the sweet and spicy salad and it was pretty tasty.  My friends ordered a different salad and one ordered a grill cheese & tomato soup, both liked their food.   There wasn't anything spectacular about this place, but it was good enough that I'd go back and try something else another time"}
{"text":"Great food! My family and I came in when it wasn't very busy and were seated right away. We all loved our food and were very full at the end. We got the Fat Elvis( was \"bomb\" says my sibling), Huevos rancheros, teriyaki chicken, BLT, turkey melt, and the pancake sandwich. All very satisfying and the staff were very friendly. 
The only thing that cause me to take a star away was that my dad noticed and chewed on egg shells in his eggs."}
{"text":"This place was definitely some of the best breakfast I've had in Vegas! It's not on the main strip but worth the cab ride! This is a must for brunch or breakfast! 

[Service]
Our server Ryan was attentive and informed ! He made great recommendations and was very attentive to our bottomless mimosas($20). 

[Food]
I ordered the chorizo skillet- Very flavorful! Scrambled eggs with chorizo and pequillo peppers and avocado! Served over a potato mash which is a creamy hashed brown potato! It was awesome! 

 Lemon poppy seed pancake with blueberry ginger compote- This was great as well! Not too sweet and the flavor profile works! 

Kentucky Fried Chicken- 2 eggs any style with a piece of fried chicken smother in bacon gravy served over the potato mash. Again was impressed with the flavor chicken was crisp and juicy and the gravy was delicious! 

[Drinks]
Bottomless Mimosas ($20)- Worth Every penny! More champing than OJ. Just the way I like it!"}
{"text":"This place just keeps getting better! I've visited the Downtown location many times and the one in Summerlin is just as great. The whole atmosphere is really cool. 

I'm not lying when I tell you it's hard to decide what to get because everything is just THAT good. Everything is fresh and if you have to try something go for the Fat Elvis. You can't go wrong with a French toast sandwich filled with peanut butter, bacon, Nutella and topped off with powdered sugar. 

This place opened only two weeks ago and runs like a place that's been there for years. I was greeted the second I walked in and my food came out quickly. Nothing but amazing things to say about this place!! Oh and don't forget the fried Apple rings! 

Good job again MTO! I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"$60.00 and food comes out cold. Girl who brought out food was completely unprofessional and rude. Time to hire a competent staff."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp when I was stuck working at the World Market. Food was excellent. Everything was fresh. And I thoroughly enjoy the free cookie with my check-in"}
{"text":"Lickety split pickup! I was staying downtown and didn't want the same ol' stuff you find everywhere, nor a buffet blah, so I fired up the app and found MTO. Just a few short blocks from downtown, it's a place that tourists can get to on foot if they want to leave the craziness, but it's great to see so many reviews from locals as well.

They seem to focus a lot on the brunch/breakfast aspect, and have a really great selection of simple lunches as well. Most people will talk about the breakfast and that seems to be their focus, but I was in desperate need of a salad after a heavy dinner the night before, and the light stroll with light fare was just what the doctor ordered.

Even though a cobb salad isn't exactly the lightest salad around, it was still perfect. Extremely generous portions of tomatoes, cucumbers, bacon, meat, and a hard-boiled egg. I polished it off completely, but really, you'll be able to share one. I also got a big bowl of fruit that seemed genuinely fresh. Strawberries, apple, blueberries; all in a cup. Your fruit may vary, depending on the season.

Most of all, though, I need to address that dressing. I'm in love with dill, and this dressing was packed with it. It was exquisitely dilled, and I couldn't get enough. I spread it over the salad (takeout comes with dressing on the side) and licked the little container clean. I haven't been this taken with a dressing in a long time, and I'll think it about it for a while after I'm back home.

Like I mentioned, I ordered the delivery right from the Yelp app. They also offered delivery, but I wanted some fresh air and it was a beautiful day. I'd love to come back from breakfast or brunch, as it seems they have a fresh twist on the classics. The space is light and beautiful, illuminated by the sun and nary a twinkling marquee light to be found."}
{"text":"My friend brought me here on my first day (of my first trip ever) to Vegas. The atmosphere was great and all of the staff were friendly and had high energy. I had the turkey melt, she had the bleu burger, we shared the lemon poppyseed pancakes with blueberry compote, and we each ordered bottomless mimosas. Everything was so delicious and the mimosas were spot on! I will definitely be coming back here the next time I am in town and will recommend it to friends who visit the area."}
{"text":"Wow...really great breakfast.  Needed to take a break after eating the large quantities.

My teenage son even loved it and he is picky.

Great service, food, and atmosphere.

Worth the price and walk from old downtown."}
{"text":"Great prices, friendly staff, inviting and laid back atmosphere. I'm glad we walked by and decided to check it out."}
{"text":"Ventured in with my children tonight. The young woman at the counter looked less than enthusiastic about our arrival. She never greeted us, scowled at us and was quick to inform us that the kitchen closed at 7:45. It was about 7:35 when we walked in. I thanked her and we left. This young lady needs a serious lesson in customer service. Business 101...nothing kills a business faster than poor customer service."}
{"text":"Was hungry during lunch hours so why not brunch right? Passed this place numerous times located in Downtown Summerlin, me and wifey decided to go check it out. The minute me and wifey walked in we were greeted loudly \"welcome to MTO Cafe!\"

I waited impatiently in line for about 7 minutes before I could order which I think was a bit long, there were only two in front of me. I ordered the Turkey Melt along with their New England clam chowder, with a cup for water. I paid via their tablet system with a credit card, using my finger to sign. The cashier gave me a number to place on my table so they would know where to bring the food. 

This place is unique in that other then the staff bringing your food you do all the work. From getting the utensils and napkins to even getting the condiments up front by the register. I honestly don't mind this approach as 1 it's less to worry about them screwing something up and 2 there is not spot to tip on the bill! Only a tip jar. They must pay their employees handsomely. 

The ambience seemed busy as it was crowded but definitely welcoming with its random art and warm color tones. They even have USB ports by their seats in case you need to charge up. The Clam Chowder was awesome, had bacon bits in it, which they told me about beforehand. The turkey melt was equally amazing, although I feel they skimped on the cheese, also not to crazy about stringy fries but that's just a personal preference. 

So aside from the wait, stringy fries, and lack of enough cheese in my sandwich I'd say for sure we'll be coming back again as my complaints aren't that dire."}
{"text":"Man, this place was good.  Their \"Kentucky Fried Chicken\" was a winner!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here three or four times and the service is consistently slow but the food is worth it. The grilled cheese sandwiches are terrific and the fries are perfection. Overall worth the wait."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. I had the B.L.T.A.E and it was delicious!  Order their green juice for an extra pick me up."}
{"text":"Vegan options are minimal but these pancakes were delicious! Staff super friendly and accommodating! My potatoes were good even though they came out cold at first they made it right and gave me fresh plate! Super chill atmosphere , beer selection could have more options. Stella was the only thing available. Also parking ticket was validated by taking $1.50 off the parking fee."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast, I have decided to try everything on the menu as I continue to come back.  My favorite is the avocado skillet, and the carrot and coconut pancakes.  I know it sounds strange but it works very well, what amazing taste.  This place is a \"Must Try\"."}
{"text":"Little jewel of a place !!!! It's Wednesday morning 10 am having some breakfast before heading to Hoover dam !!!...parked in the garage and walked to level 1 on the front side of main . Walked in cool casual atmosphere some beats in the background . Greeted right away and sat by our server MANON she such a doll !!! So nice and attentive!!!...I ordered the Yoga pants skillet with avocado which is like egg omelette some green tea and green juice which is full of antioxidants and it was delish !!! For me personally the skillet plate was too much for me to eat so had to pack it to go !!! I will be back for sure !!! Perfect place to take my friends to away from strip ."}
{"text":"Excellent service as I sat at the bar.  The special triple berry ginger juice (made into a mimosa...why not...we're in Vegas ) was light, refreshing and delicious.  $5.95

I was grateful to be able to get one pancake since I really only wanted just a taste...but of course I ate the whole thing!  The lemon flavor in the pancake and the hint of ginger in the berry compote was a party in my mouth! $3.75

Hearty avocado omlette.  Tasted fresh and was filling. $10.95

I am now enjoying the chocolate chip cookie (I got by checking in through yelp) while writing this review...which my spectacular server Lisa was kind enough to heat for me without me even asking.  If I lived here I'd definitely be back.   Definitely worth the short uber ride from the strip"}
{"text":"Nice spring lunch was enjoyed here today. Spring in Vegas means wind and this afternoon it was whipping so much patio dining was out of the question. Boo!

After browsing the menu trying to decide on breakfast or lunch items, I decided on that would satisfy both cravings. The BLTAE won the battle.  Thick grilled white bread served open face and slathered with mayo and topped with shredded iceberg, Roma tomatos, thick cut Applewood bacon and two perfectly cooked Sunnyside up eggs.  This item is located in the sandwich section but this job requires a knife a fork. Great menu item and very satisfying.  Shoestring fries served on side were also very good.  If I would change one thing about this dish it would be the lettuce. Maybe serve with piece of iceberg or step up to romaine or spring mix. Either would work.

We also had the Lemon Poppy seed pancakes with ginger blueberry compote. Yumm!.  I loved the tartness of the lemon throughout the pancakes. Balanced out by the sweetness of the blueberry topping. Another great dish. 

Overall good visit. Next time we hope to enjoy the patio."}
{"text":"There is a parking garage behind. Awesome service. Delicious brunch. Good vibe in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent!

Service: attentive. Helpful. Friendly. Prompt. Manager even delivered the food and ensured my happiness. Good stuff. 

Seating: I sat at the high counter near the window and it was nice. 

Food: 
-they have bottomless mimosas! Regular mimosas are $6 and the bottomless is $20. Waiter basically recommended to go one at a time and if you hit 4, then we'll switch to bottomless. 
-Kentucky fried chicken: chicken itself was pretty bland, but paired with everything else worked well (including my staple breakfast condiment combo of ketchup and Cholula). Got mine with an over medium egg. Mashed Browns were a cool combo of mashed potatoes and hash browns. Good combo. 

If I find myself ever staying in downtown again, I'd come back. BTW, I walked from golden nugget. Not a bad walk. Not next door though."}
{"text":"Few places get an outstanding across as far as both food quality, service quality and comfort. The Food has creative combinations of flavor. Every bite must be savored. My mouth had the pleasure of trying the Fat Elvis, which has bananas, bacon,strawberries,blueberries, peanut butte  and Nutella in between French toast. No need for syrup as it is a mouthful of heavenly sweetness. - I also shared half of the Hangover Burger with the fried egg. Again a mouthful of goodness.-our waitress was sweet & attentive. Not to mention, the owner, Ben, personally came by to check up on us. They also cater to any dietary needs.This place is only a 5min walk from Fremont across the street from City Hall and by far the best breakfast stop!"}
{"text":"This cafe had great food, along with friendly service. 
The best part was the kid meals. My daughter ordered chicken tenders and fruit. For just $7 she got actual chicken (not your typical frozen sticks) and a legit bowl of fruit. The fruit bowl had apples, bananas, and berries. 
My only gripe is all the food was too saucy. Being comfort food though some might like that. 
Overall I will go back!"}
{"text":"Staying at a hotel nearby and ordered the broccoli skillet and \"red juice\" instead of getting room service. Food was still hot after delivery and the juice was fresh. I'll come here again next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Alyson is my friend.  

Place is awesome definitely coming back!
Great service and an awesome vibe!"}
{"text":"Very very good food, great atmosphere and awesome staff. We went this morning and being Saturday we expected to wait, we were pleasantly surprised to be greeted and seated right away."}
{"text":"I've been really wanting to try this place out since I would always pass by the dtlv location. I finally had a chance while shopping in downtown summerlin, and I am mind blown of how delicious it was! 

I had the MTO breakfast and I was not disappointed. It was also A LOT of food, which is always a plus, along with a hazelnut latte, also very delicious. It came with about 4 different kinds of meat, hash browns, eggs and toast, pure deliciousness! 

I was absolutely amazed at the hash browns, They had mashed potatoes in them!!! I will most define you be coming back to try the rest of their menu!"}
{"text":"Delicious food. Hangover burger, chicken and waffles and especially the queso carne. Fries with gravy were great. Love the comfort food here."}
{"text":"Great spot near downtown Vegas. Extremely friendly service, fast and awesome food for breakfast. Can't wait to go back and try more!"}
{"text":"I love this eat24 business on Yelp while Stateside. I really do. I ordered through these guys while in my hotel before I walked over to pickup the order and get an Uber to my partner's workshop for a lunch delivery.

These guys have a corner just down off Freemont. It was a pleasant walk from my hotel to their shop. Easy to find as well.

Huge glass and signage let you know you've arrived. As you walk in there's some seats to your left and turning right means you get to walk into the cafe itself. There's a bar with stools running along it where you can sit and watch the cooks and staff running about filling orders, or there's booths as well as tables and chairs if you wanted to have your food delivered to you.

I imagine this place would be pumping with a lunch crowd and I may have missed the rush by getting in before noon. Either way, I took a seat on the stools to wait for my order.

The wait staff are very attentive and get your order to you quite quickly.

I had mine boxed up and bagged and ready to go in no time.

I also ordered some fresh squeezed juices. Although to be fair for the price I was paying for the juices I was expecting a bit more juice than I actually got. Maybe bigger cups would help in future.

Otherwise the salad and wrap hit the spot and tasted amazing. I would happily go back here for more yums in the future when I'm back in Vegas."}
{"text":"They need to do less and do it better. All dishes we had were underwhelming and short on flavor. Portion sizes are too large (half is enough). Need better consistency. Ordered medium steak and received it very well done. Good try, poor execution."}
{"text":"Great little Cafe within walking distance of the downtown casinos. They had great recommendations (loved the veggie skillet), spicy Bloody Mary's, hot good coffee and friendly service. I would recommend it and would definitely go back the next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!! If I could give this place 100 stars I would! The food is incredible, we literally just walked out of the restaurant and I can't wait to go back!! Amazing food, wonderful service, delicious twists on classic favorites...such a hidden gem! Prices are beyond reasonable for the quantity and quality of food you'll be eating. So thankful we found this place! Run, Don't walk towards this place and make your belly smile! :)"}
{"text":"A beautiful, beautiful cafe.
Sleek, clean and has big glass windows for beautiful sunlight to shine the restaurant. I like how there is a mixture of a few tables, bar seating, booths for more privacy and a long, sleek high table table with bar stools along side their large window that over looks the street. If you need a place to relax and study, this would be it. You can grab one of their booths and set up your laptop and order some food to settle in. They provide power outlets for you to charge your electronics---something Starbucks needs to do. 
Their ambiance is awesome! From their seating arrangement, lighting, art work display, to their kitchen and food presentation. 
Their food is great!! They offer am array of options from the green eater to the extra grease lover. Their side orders are quite large, so be sure to share with two or three people, or, have that as your meal :)
I would definitely return to this cafe."}
{"text":"I like coming here to have breakfast around the Summerlin area after we hit up Costco on our weekend shopping.  I like the bacon pancakes."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service. Friendly and knowledgeable of the menu. The food was delicious. The mash-browns"}
{"text":"I love this place - service is great and the owners are present and attentive. Great addition to the downtown area! **Great for vegetarians!"}
{"text":"Found this spot while waiting for some friends to arrive in Las Vegas. Great breakfast and the staff were extremely helpful and pleasant!"}
{"text":"I decided to come to MTO cafe to have some brunch with my boyfriend. I wanted to try this place because the food looked really good. I got the chorizo skillet and clam chowder. I LOVE clam chowder so how could I not order it. My boyfriend ordered the hero. When we got our food, everything seemed to look delicious. But I was wrong. The \"chorizo\" skillet didn't even have chorizo in it. My boyfriend is Mexican I would know. The whole thing was bland. It was just so disappointing. Well on to the clam chowder, it actually has some decent flavor and seasoning. It had lots of chunks of clams which is a big plus. Usually places are not that generous with their clams. Lastly, my boyfriend's sandwich was just average. Nothing special. Overall MTO cafe is just meh. Nothing to it."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp and I must agree with the reviews, it was very good. All smiles when you came into the door. It can get crowded but the food is worth the small wait. I like the healthier side of the menu. I had the Yoga Pants Skillet with avocado! It was so filling without being too heavy. A great meal plus good customer service. I will be back the next time I am in town. I knocked off one star because you do have to pay for parking. Even when you get validation, it is $1.50."}
{"text":"\"Our friendly tattooed waiter and the many pop-culture (graffiti-inspired) artwork everywhere got along very well with pop rock and some slow 90s classics playing in the background. \"
Just a few bite from our full experience review at MTO cafe!"}
{"text":"My friend and I were looking for a quick breakfast before we hit the road back home, and we stumbled upon this little gem. The food was delicious and definitely Made To Order.  Don't forget the MTO mini donuts!!!!"}
{"text":"Service was great! Very attentive and both employees my husband and I encountered had positive attitudes..but the food! OMG it was so delicious...comparable to hash house a go go on the strip but without the wait..I will be coming back for all my vegas vacations..ohh and also parking structure right next to this place so finding parking was easy and free with validation."}
{"text":"We came here on a Sunday for brunch. Decor and atmosphere were both really nice and welcoming. I got the Hen House wrap, which was really good but the fries that came with it were way too crispy and were almost inedible. The mimosa I got was perfect. We plan to be back to try again!"}
{"text":"This was my first experience here today; I ordered to go for work. This was honestly the worst presentation and taste of food I've ever had. My chicken was beyond BURNT! It was hard like beef jerkey(I'll just let the pictures speak for themselves) ........ eggs over done, soggy hash browns and the weirdest gravy I've ever seen and smelled... so sad bc I spent $13 bucks. I coulda gone to Denny's"}
{"text":"I had the steak and eggs.  The eggs were cooked perfectly and the steak was cooked medium rare like I ordered.  All the staff was great giving energy to the restaurant.   The only drawback is that they  did not have a steak knife to cut the steak.   Other than that  everything was fantastic."}
{"text":"So arrived to a mostly empty cafe.  Order was taken but when I asked for a soda response was \"fountain is out of a bunch you should go check.\"  Placed order and it took over 30 mins for a bowl and sandwich.  When I went to check they had no clue.  Order line was very long and slow while we waited.  Maybe six people but took 20 mins.  We were not the only one.  Woman next to me got part of her order then waited 20 mins for a scrambled egg.  She asked for toast. Server said it didn't come with toast.  She offered to pay. Was told she had to stand in 20 mins long line to order and pay. Food was actually pretty good but for prices they charge not worth the terrible service."}
{"text":"Awesome!!!! I truly enjoyed my breakfast. Service was great.  This was better than having breakfast in those casino downtown. Will make this a stop the next time I stay downtown vegas"}
{"text":"Always love this place. I don't get the opportunity to visit it as much as I once did. Staff is amazing and will always make sure you are taken care of. Food is good with the wait time not being that long.

 Great location for brunch also."}
{"text":"Great place to eat ! I love their healthy yet comforting menu and I go their atleast 3 times a month! Last time I was there I found a hair in my ketchup and I kindly took it back and and asked for a new one ! I think the hair was from the servers not the cooks."}
{"text":"Great location and decor. It's small and kinda loud. Not a huge breakfast food fan, wish they had oatmeal."}
{"text":"We tried to like it here. Nothing worth writing home about. The walk-up order experience was dull and seemed to annoy the young guy. The board menu vs. the paper menu differed and confused us. Food served was bland and not appealing on the plate. No plans to return."}
{"text":"The food is amazing and the portions are generous. This is a must stop every time I'm in Vegas. Everything we've tried has been fantastic. The servers are friendly and efficient. The servers seem to genuinely enjoy their jobs. The iced tea is great- it's a flavored blend called tropical passion. And the coffee is amazing! I really can't say enough good things about this place.

Another nice touch is the plug ins and USB ports at each booth."}
{"text":"Cute little breakfast place downtown. It's got a parking garage right next to it so parking is pretty easy. It is 75 cents per half hour tho but that's given when you're in the downtown area. 

The ambiance is pretty neat. The glass windows allow the restaurant to be brightened up. 

They have $15 all you can drink mimosas. If I wasn't already hung over when I went here I would of taken advantage of that but instead I just got a water with lemon lol. 

I got a chicken skillet which I thought was pretty good. It had chicken sausage, eggs, potatoes, spinach & red peppers. It was the perfect amount to eat. Nieves D. got the Chicken in a waffle Which I thought was a cool idea. She did mention that the chicken lacked seasoning and flavor. But the fries that came with it was pretty good. They were nice and thin and crispy.

I thought the food was good but if I was in the downtown area I'd prolly rush to Eat. for breakfast instead of coming here again."}
{"text":"MTO Cafe just opened at 1:00pm on Oct. 22nd so the timing of the 1st three reviews are a little suspicious. The cafe is on the smaller side, but well designed and welcoming. I ordered the Skuna Bay Salmon wrap, which was not what I expected. The wrap had eggs in it, which were not listed in the description, and I do not like salmon and eggs cooked together. I was expecting something more like a wrap version of lox and bagels. Aside from that fact, I think other people would like this combination. For a $12 wrap, I would have expected it to include chips or fries, but it didn't so I also ordered a side of fries... which where unseasoned and \"floppy\". 

Overall, it's nice to have another dining option downtown, but I think MTO Cafe is a little on the pricey side for breakfast and lunch offerings. It will be interesting to see how they do over time."}
{"text":"What an awesome surprise! Always walked by this place when shopping in DT Summerlin, but finally walked in and have no regrets whatsoever. Ordered the BLT with egg and it was out of the world. Portions were plenty, staff was very catering. A bit in the high end for diner food, but from my only visit so far, well worth their weight. Will def come back again!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here and staff was very friendly and very helpful telling us about the menu. We ordered breakfast. Everything tastes very fresh and well cooked. Big portions. I can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"MTO cafe is a stylish daytime outpost providing a modern take on breakfast & lunch, minutes from the Freemont Experience. The service it swift and the menu is quite easy and affordable. 

The Baked Apple French Toast and cast iron Vegetable Hash are worth the visit. Catch an uber from the strip or get a 24 hr bus pass (machines in front of Planet Hollywood Las Vegas)."}
{"text":"Great food...super expensive for a cafe! I will absolutely return in spite of the higher prices."}
{"text":"Hella good. Fresh organic ingredients, and delicious flavors. 

I had the hen house, the fries were phenomenal. So good we came back twice in one Vegas trip."}
{"text":"Located in Downtown Summerlin, MTO Cafe appeared on my radar due to a recommendation from a co-worker. 

We were greeted from the moment we entered the door! It's a small, but nice and clean, dining area. You order and pay at the counter and then grab a seat and they will bring your order to you.

(+) friendly service from the time we walked through the door until the moment we left! 
(+) cafe was very clean and well organized. tables were cleaned and bussed in a fast and efficient fashion. 
(+) food was very tasty and quite filling! steak was nice and tender and among the better cafe steaks I have had recently. actually everything tasted great and was well cooked with the exception of the toast, which was a bit burnt. no biggie though.
(+) I do love those soda machines where you are able to mix and match sodas and flavoring, much like in some movie theaters!

(-) the only real knock on this place is that it is a tad bit pricey. $3.00 for a fountain soda is  bit high. 2 entrees and 2 drinks came to $35.69 before tip. 

I enjoyed my first visit to the MTO cafe! At this price point it will probably be an \"every now and then\" option, but I am almost certain we will be back to try some other menu items!

4 stars.

Yay! I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Quest Carne was deliciously naughty! And the Skuna Bay Salmon Filet was to die for! Couldn't stop eating the fries!!! MTO Cafe is a refreshing addition to the Downtown restaurant scene!"}
{"text":"MTO serves up classic diner fare - sort of nice to get away from the fancy and flourish of the Strip for a bit.

It's a fairly straightforward menu, but one of their specialties caught my eye: Kentucky Fried Chicken, which is chicken fried chicken on top of hash browns, smothered in gravy with 2 eggs.

Whole bunch of food, but it was extremely satisfying and worth it. One thing different was the gravy - I think it's cinnamon in it that makes the gravy stand out a little TOO much, but I still polished off my plate.

Parking is a weird situation: 75 cents every 30 minutes in the garage, and MTO will validate 1 hour. MTO can get hella busy, and service can be pretty lax (friendly, though!) - just something to remember.

Thoroughly enjoyed a filling brunch, perfect to hike off!"}
{"text":"I have been going to there location in downtown Las Vegas, and was really excited to hear they opened up in downtown summerlin. Food is always on point along with service!"}
{"text":"I live this place! Michelle gives the best service. Try the grilled chicken sandwich on ciabatta bread!"}
{"text":"I don't know how this place is rated so high. Must have a lot of friends. First time and last time. Horrible food and service! When we came in it took 10 minutes before anyone greeted us. Once seated it was another 20 min before our server came to the table. Everything was extremely salty and not fresh. Way overpriced."}
{"text":"A 10 min walk from Freemont street madness but well worth it. Best breakfast in downtown vegas."}
{"text":"What a find close to the Fremont Experience. Great food, very fresh with a large variety of items to choose from. Try the Elvis French Toast, a concoction of bananas, peanut butter, Nutella and French Toast covered in powered sugar. Sweet, filling and tasty too. MTO also features bottomless mimosas and bloody marys to quench your thirst or to make the day right after a long night. Whether you are just hungry or need the hair of the dog, MTO is your go to place for great food, cool environment and a drink if needed."}
{"text":"Great breakfast. My wife and I both had skillets. She had avocado and I had the hash.  Food was fresh with ample portions. Bloody Mary was heavy on tomato with just the right amount of spice.  Excellent coffee. Out server was polite, friendly and very helpful.  Price was reasonable.  Worth going to and they validate parking in the garage."}
{"text":"Can I just say OMG BLTAE? Probably the best BLT cousin I have ever tried, and won't forget soon... bacon, lettuce, tomato, avocado, sunny-side egg, basil pesto, mayo on grilled brioche + fries = amazing! This all was served open faced, and was so spic that I needed to eat it with a knife and fork :o. P.S. They didn't care that we were last minute folk and arrived 10 min before closing :) thanks MTO!"}
{"text":"My two girlfriends and I chose MTO as our newest discovery (as part of our irregularly scheduled brunches together). We were pleasantly surprised by the modern and warm decor. The staff was very pleasant, friendly, and efficient. We all loved the over sized coffee/tea cups. The menu choices were awesome. I had the MTO breakfast with 3 eggs and different meats, and their amazing hash browns. I'm not one to eat sausage, but when I took a bite of the homemade chicken sausage, I was blown away at how nicely flavored and fresh it tasted. The turkey bacon was one of the best I've had. My girlfriend had the lemon poppy seed pancakes with fresh blueberry compote. Her words were, \"wow, these are like a party in your mouth, they're so good.\" Of course, I had to try them & they were amazing! The blueberries were the best flavored and fresh tasting. My other friend had the chicken skillet and raved about the fresh tomatoes and perfectly blended flavors.

When we were finished, the owner came over and spoke to us for a while. He shared that they get their produce from a farm in northern California - all no pesticides. They don't keep a freezer on the property because all of their food is fresh & free of all the \"bad stuff.\" We could tell, because it was a two-thumbs up, five star place! I'll recommend this to other friends and will definitely return."}
{"text":"I ordered the Veggie hash (on the grill) and was a little disappointed with the amount of leafy greens and veggies (spinach, mushroom, tomatoes, and broccoli) in the grill.  Potatoes lacked seasoning/ flavors and the veggies were over cooked with burnt sides.  

Customer service was also a 3-star rating -- Cashier went ahead and helped out another customer who was not in line before helping the people who were already in line.  

Condiment bar can afford to have a carafe of half/half or other creamer options rather than the individual plastic ones - minor details.

Food was delivered in a timely manner and the environment could be good for different occasions!"}
{"text":"Damn, MTO is delicious and everyone here is so nice. The food was fresh and plentiful and the owner, Ben, is incredibly nice and gracious. Our server was very attentive and the place is very very nice. Highly recommended. Oh. And try the Crabbies ginger beer."}
{"text":"I'm pretty disappointed by this place, today... I ordered a vegan falafel wrap, some French fries and a chocolate chip cookie. The falafel wrap was bland and the pieces of falafel were about the size of my thumb, so most of the time, I was chomping on leafy greens and a wrap. I mean, the tahini sauce would've made it more enjoyable, but there was probably about 1tbsp on the entire wrap. The French fries were so crispy, I couldn't finish them. The cookie was definitely under-baked. I've eaten at this cafe twice before, and my experiences were OK, but today was terrible. To add, I placed my order at 9:19am this morning, and didn't receive my order till 10:32am. This place is a 6 minute walk from my place of work, but with a thirty minute lunch break (15 of which are spent pumping breastmilk for my son), I didn't wanna waste 12 minutes walking. I called the cafe twice to get an ETA. The first time I was told, \"It'll be there any minute,\" and then I was hung up on. The second time, I was starting to get impatient, and was told that the delivery guy had four more orders to deliver. I asked if my food would be cold, and was reassured it wouldn't...well that was a lie. I was told they have a 3mi. radius on deliveries... It takes about 8 minutes to drive 3 miles going 25mph...so again, I'm not sure why my delivery took AN HOUR. I paid $20 on food that was COLD and I didn't even enjoy, which really bums me out. Trust me, I get it. $20 is no big deal for a company, but geez, at least act like you care about your customers."}
{"text":"I'm so happy MTO Cafe opened in Las Vegas. I appreciate the diversity in their menu options, and have always been impressed by the fresh ingredients. Everything is made well, and I love their sandwiches. They have some fun dishes worth trying, especially the ones on the sweeter side if you're in need of a treat. I'm only ever really underwhelmed by the salads, which can always be improved with some additions or subtractions, but its nice to have easy healthy options here too!"}
{"text":"We came in on MLK Jr. Day and experienced very slow service from kitchen to table...we were told that two chefs called out on this National Holiday... but what makes MTO Cafe 4 stars?...the quality of the food and friendliness of the staff.

After yoga, we had to eat something before our next class in a day that we opted for a double...so my love and I stopped in to MTO Cafe around 3:30 in the afternoon.  Not many tables were occupied and the overall setting was clean. We were greeted with a warm smile, and proceeded to order a Quinoa Crunch Salad and a Vegan Falafel Wrap.   

We helped ourselves to glasses of water from the self-service soft drink station and waited...watied...and waited a little more. I could sense the frustration from the other patrons who ordered before us wondering where the food was. The server kindly went around to apologize for the delay and discretely explained to us that they were short on kitchen staff at that moment. So, it took much longer to get orders ready, but once we had our food...the result was a couple of happy campers on our end.

The Quinoa Crunch Salad came with quinoa, broccoli, zucchini, avocado, arugula, edamame hummus, chipotle vinaigrette, and hot sauce at $9...simple and fresh ingredients with light dressing. The Vegan Flafel was made with chick peas, tomato, lettus, onion, balsamic tahini on unleavened bread with a simple green salad...this one was so delicious that if we weren't sharing, I could have eaten it all. The falafel was still warm, and wrapped-up compact with all so much deliciousness to make me forget how long we had to wait....the balsamic tahini has just the right amount of sweetness and bite.

I am optimistically sure that MTO Cafe runs more smoothly on a regular basis...I would love to come back to try other offerings. If they make me wait that long for food again though, It may be the last time.

{"text":"I heard so much good stuff about MTO's downtown location. I don't know how this location compares, but I'm thinking that downtown must be better. The food is mediocre I ordered a Ceaser salad today the croutons were bomb the dressing had the consistency and taste of Helmans mayo, and it seems they used a low grade parmesian cheese. 

The atmosphere is great and I like thy E outdoor area music inside could be turned down a bit. Probably won't come back too many other new places to explore here in DT."}
{"text":"Great selection of breakfast and lunch good and service was terrific.  Five stars for the service.  
Food was pleasing to everyone in my party.

They offer paid parking for about the length of your meal so don't let parking keep you from this great place.  Check in for a free cookie too"}
{"text":"I was not impressed. The food was good, but not exceptional. What really ruined the experience was waiting 40 minutes for breakfast. Then for the amount we paid ($75 for 2 adults and 3 kids), it was just not worth it in the end."}
{"text":"Great Breakfast, Friendly Staff.  3 of us went for breakfast and had a pancake stack, chicken and waffles and the egg white omelet with la carte hash browns.  Everyone thought the food was great but $51.00 for the breakfast mentioned above plus coffee and iced tea is a little steep for breakfast. Add to that parking fees and gratuity and you have strip prices for a very good downtown breakfast."}
{"text":"Update: I see other people got their parking validated. I made the mistake of not checking the tips first but I'm sad our server never offered or asked. 

I must come back!!! Ahhh breakfast/ brunch is so delicious! 

Ok so when we first came in it was super empty at 10am, so it made me a little nervous. The server was on top of her stuff but she wasn't very friendly, like not really smiling or welcoming. The menu looked kind of limited so I was a little anxious I maybe should have gone somewhere else. I went ahead and ordered, scared I might be disappointed. 
Then the food came...
It was amazing! Presentation was on point, and serving size was generous. I was so happy! I ordered the yoga pants skillet and it was everything I wanted. Also got the vegan coconut carrot pancakes. Let me tell you about these PANCAKES! They were the most melt in your mouth made by Jesus pancakes I've ever tasted. My mom and sister were also happy with their selections! Plus you get a free cookie with yelp check in!"}
{"text":"My second visit won me over! They have flavored lattes and koolaid. The mini donuts are insanely fresh and delicious. And the Hangover burger hit the spot just how a burger should. The egg was cooked to perfection and the yolk ran over the meat and bacon perfectly. I love that you can go all out and eat healthy, or go all out and get fried chicken and koolaid! 
The service this time was far from mediocre as I mentioned in my first review. We were treated great and even given a free parking validation slip by the hostess. 
They offer a salad that is made different each week depending on what the local farmers market has. And they didn't mind giving me a side salad instead of fries with my burger. The beet vingerette was unique and flavorful. But the fries are a safe bet because I snuck a couple of those too. Overall a great, unusual, addition to downtown and I am glad I gave them a second chance."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Great service. Bodybuilder omelette and red velvet pancake is to die for!"}
{"text":"On my continued adventure to find non animal meals, this is a great spot to enjoy a meal. Check out the menu and tons of pictures to help with your choice. It is open with the high ceiling and the wall to floor windows. Has a very casual feel to it that reminds me of my time in LA. I like the choice of bar, booth or table- depending on who you are eating with I guess.
The parking garage is sweet--just up above- yet far enough to walk off your meal.They do validate so don't forget to ask. 
The service was friendly and quick- they seemed to enjoy their jobs which added to the positive vibe of the place."}
{"text":"Always a favorite neighborhood cafe and a rare gem in Las Vegas because MTO is just that- a neighborhood cafe! This spot is filled with local flavor from the founders, to the wait staff, to the regulars who call Downtown Las Vegas their home. The food is delicious, as attested by so many Yelpers, but what makes this place so wonderful is what it brings to our local neighborhood, economy, and community. If you want to experience Las Vegas for its charm, genuine and down-to-earth hospitality devoid of the pretentiousness and over-branding of the Strip, I highly recommend a visit to MTO."}
{"text":"This place was great! Hit it up before heading to Fremont Street. Their chicken and waffles was fantastic! So were the apple rings! (Think fried donuts but filled with baked apples) The staff was extremely friendly and attentive and you could tell there were having a great time working here. Shout out to our server Lisa. She was great!"}
{"text":"I LOVE MTO!!! I work downtown at Moveline and Ive literally had them deliver the same Vegan Falafel to me for the past 3 months. I love it! & I love their GM! Their customer service is really what sets them aside from most restaurants down here. They build connections with people and really aim to please, which is what its about, if the customer is happy, business is happy. I am anxious for the new location to open up in Summerlin soon, MTO has really become my favorite place to eat and being Vegan with many options to choose from its rare to have a place you dont mind eating at 4 times a week! They are making me go broke! lol, all in all, I am a permanent customer. Keep on doing what youre doing"}
{"text":"My husband and I were in town and in search of a great place for breakfast. MTO Cafe hit the spot! Had the Bodybuilder's omelette and husband, had the Kentucky Fried Chicken.  Both must haves if you come in. Great service. We were extremely blessed!!"}
{"text":"To make a long review short, this place is fantastic. The food, portions, and quality are all reasonable for the price. The avocado skillet, the vegan pancakes, and the BLTAE are out of this world. Oh, and another great thing about this place is their customer service. All of the employees are such a charm. Amber, Allyson and Lilly are really attentive. Their customer service blows my mind. 
On a different note, one thing that I did notice was that a couple of people bitch about MTO not offering wifi... If you're looking to use wifi go to Starbucks, if you are looking to have a good meal go to MTO."}
{"text":"Been here a few times, I get the burger with the fried egg on top and it's always been great. 

What I like about this place is that every time I go, they cater to my wife and her eating choices. Tho its not on the menu, they always make her a vegetarian sandwich and it makes her happy. 

Gotta love a place that serves coke products!!

Also, if you choose to go here, be prepared to eat a meal in one of the loudest settings possible. I can't explain it, but this place gets amazingly loud with a combination of hipsters talking about wearing beanies in the summer or whatever they talk about, a large wait staff taking orders and a kitchen full of pots and pans crashing around. So don't expect to have a good conversation here."}
{"text":"Okay... As a vegan I will never feel comfortable eating here again. My mom and I were in downtown Summerlin yesterday and we were excited to grab dinner here. They had vegan options on the menu... And having tried the tree hugger at the downtown location last summer... I felt compelled to order it again... But lo and behold... A VEGAN falafel started calling my name. I was totally torn. I asked her if they had any nutritional Info for their food. They didn't. I then asked if the treehugger was vegan... I was told it was but they use mayo in the aioli. Good to know because the downtown location told me the sauce was vegan and safe, it clearly isn't if they are using mayo. She then went on to inform me that they fry the vegan falafel in the same oil that they fry their chicken in. Um... Wait what? I had to ask her how this was even possible... And why on earth they would have the nerve to use the word vegan in anything on the menu that was being cross contaminated with animal products. In all fairness... The ingredients uncooked are vegan... But the second they hit that fryer... They are contaminated with fat and oil and enzymes from chicken. It's vegetarian at best... And using the word vegan is a lawsuit waiting to happen (anyone remember the Mcdonalds French fry catastrophe?) I had a salad from here at the beer fest that was most definitely vegan... And it was sooo good. Unfortunately... I will never be eating here again, at least not until they learn proper vocabulary or create a separate fryer."}
{"text":"This place is slightly off the beaten path and ABSOLUTELY worth the effort to get here! The bacon pancake dippers are delicious, the Yoga Pants skillet is mind-bending, the Lemon Blueberry pancakes are incredible! You MUST try the B.L.T.A.E.!! (We came back multiple times so we could try everything!)

All the staff were friendly, but we LOVE Steve!  

Do not forget to save room for an Apple Ring! (HINT: It's not a doughnut--it's three million times better!)"}
{"text":"I was just there on Friday June 20,2014. I love the KFC for breakfast. The smashed mashed hash browns are great. The chicken crispy but moist. Our waitress was alittle un attentive ,but the manager & his father were gems. The place is a one of a kind & I wait to go there whenever I'm in Vegas. Their menu is nothing like anything close to us. I will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"MTO is hyped up Kimbo Slice style and lucky enough, it will have way more staying power than the former street fighting champ's run in the UFC (sorry, Kimbo!). 

Ordered the 'Broccoli' (broc, egg whites, spinach, Tillamook cheddar, jalapeño, mushrooms) in a whole wheat wrap ($12). Added a side of hash browns ($2) bc the accompanying side was two slices of tomato and a few pieces of lettuce. I always enjoy a salty break from an egg sammie (doesn't everyone?), but was turned off by the additional charge. Even more perplexing is that you can order it as a skillet (with potatoes) for the same price. Either way, that side of browns was phenomenal and almost got a second order sent my way. A crunchy outside, an almost creamy inside... oof. So good. Maybe I'll order 6 of those next time. The wrap itself was also very good. A great combo of veggies and cheese made each bite delish. The 'Chicken' (chicken sausage, roasted tomato, caramelized onions, arugula) was also good, but a bit heavy for my taste. If you're a sausage and onions kinda guy, look no further (OK, maybe look down further to the MTO Breakfast). Service? Ours was excellent.

Is the vibe cool? Yes! Do I want to come back here for lunch? Sure! Does paying $28 for 2 egg 'wiches and an iced tea (w/o potatoes) stink? Why yes, it does. Unfortunately, since it's not really located by anything else I frequent, I can't see myself being a regular here. However, a few times a month I'll def be hangin out. A large 2-steps up from a greasy spoon. 4-stars for now and I'll be back for more!

Protip: Check out their fb page for special Sunday night dinners with local chefs.
Bro-tip:  $15 AYCD mimosa or bloody mary's"}
{"text":"I tried MTO today for the first time via delivery. Awesome service and the food was incredible! They even made an exception for my delivery because I called the order in late! Affordable prices and a gem DT LV!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times because their vegan pancakes are amazing! Fluffy, warm, huge, and sweet!! How do they make them so fluffy? Wish I knew the secret haha. My one year old son loves it as much as I do :-) Service is decent."}
{"text":"Amazing food, large portions at a good price-especially for Vegas. My boyfriend got the turkey melt and I got the yoga pants scramble with avocado. We also got the fried apple rings to share. It was all AMAZING! highly recommend this place for you Vegas hangover cure."}
{"text":"Everything we tried was excellent including the simple side salad we had with roasted tomatoes and the tastiest balsamic dressing I've ever tried. I especially loved the buffalo corned beef reuben. Friendly service was an added plus."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore MTO Cafe in Downtown Las Vegas. As soon as I walked in I knew this was where I was going to stuff my face for the rest of my Mondays. They have the most laid back ambience, from the donkey paintings on the wall to the very attentive employees."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this treasure by accident and we couldn't be happier. I got the Kentucky fried chicken breakfast... Eggs, their unique \"mash Browns\" and a perfectly cooked piece of fried chicken covered with just the right amount of gravy. Hubby ordered the mto breakfast and had eggs, several different kinds of meat and toast. We split an order of fried apple rings - a highly recommended indulgence. We loved this place and will go back. Ryan waited on us and was awesome. Friendly and helpful. Great breakfast and a nice break from the LV strip."}
{"text":"Once again meeting a colleague for breakfast taking in consideration her healthy lifestyle I chose to schedule her here :) with that said this time I ordered the waffle with berries (12) and a side oh hash brown (2) 
Loved it! The waffle was pretty well portioned that I couldn't even finish it, it was fluffy and full of flavor :p the cream and berries complemented the waffle soo well it was even too pretty to eat!.. 
Loved what they did to those hash brown! Hands down it's very good! Must try it on your next visit! Love this place"}
{"text":"Had a great breakfast with my friend here. The ambiance is fun and colorful. In regards to food, my veggie omelette was tasty and light, my friend got the lemon poppy pancakes which she also really enjoyed. The owner came by our table and was also very friendly... I guess it had only been open a little while when we had visited."}
{"text":"Disappointing - we've eaten at the Main St location many times, the food & service have always been excellent. I wish I could say the same of the Summerlin location. Our food, Yoga Pants Omelet, Denver Skillet & wheat toast, sat finished in the kitchen window so long we had to get up & ask for it to be delivered to our table... twice. The omelet was browned & overcooked for my taste. There appeared to only be 2 people working the front of the house which was 75% full. Just as we were leaving at 2:00 six more staff showed up. The food was still decent but I'll be sticking to their downtown location."}
{"text":"Love this place, Very good, friendly service. The food is delicious. We arrived about 1:45 pm on a Sunday to a friendly hostess, were seated right away, & greeted by our server, Jocelyne. Our order (1 yoga pants omelet, 1 yoga pants skillet, wheat toast) was served in just a few minutes. The eggs were fluffy and not overcooked, the vegetables were crisp and flavorful. On previous visits, we've had several other items on the menu and each was very tasty. The fried apple rings, basically small donuts with a big apple ring on the inside, are a nice treat. We left with a generous portion of leftovers and to-go cups of our drinks. This small, well-run cafe is a great place for a quality, quick meal served by a personable, attentive staff."}
{"text":"Came here first time due to good Yelp reviews and they steered us right!

Came on a Saturday morning only a few tables were filled they were not busy.  I like the contemporary décor.  Server was great didn't catch her name.  Good coffee.  Started with the apple rings and they were fantastic!  Took a while to get our breakfasts even though they were not busy.  My wife got the broccoli skillet and added Chorizo (not on the menu) per our servers suggestion and it was really good!  They goofed up my Chorizo skillet and I had to wait another 10 minute while my wife ate :-(.  They were apologetic and very nice about it, stuff happens not a big deal.  When I got mine it was not as good as my wifes I think if they added cheese to this dish it would do the trick and make it much better.  Met Mike the GM, good guy and he comped us the Apple rings for the mess up on my order that was very cool.  They weren't perfect and overall a little slow so thats why the 4 stars but I am a fan and will definitely be back and hope to upgrade to 5 stars on my next visit."}
{"text":"Loved this spot!!! The food was great. Hot and delicious! I had the chicken in a waffle. The chicken was tender, juicy and crispy on the outside. The shoestring fries were good as well. My bf had the Kentucky Fried Chicken and he cleaned the plate. I think he liked it! The service was just as amazing as the food.  The waiters and servers were so warm and welcoming. I wanted no gravy and before our waiter reached the table he realized the cooks had forgotten to hold the gravy. He apologized and brought out another plate with the correct order. Overall, great experience! Love the decor too!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the healthiest brunches you can get in DTLV. Delicious, hearty, healthy, and comes with excellent service! Definitely worth checking this place out."}
{"text":"The vegan carrot coconut pancakes are to die for. Crave this place everyday! Great customer service & ambience."}
{"text":"I came in town for a bachelorette party last weekend and a friend of a friend recommended we try here for brunch.  It was one of the best decisions (which are far and few in Vegas) that we made the entire trip.  The food was amazing, the bottomless mimosas were amazing, the service was amazing.

Ordering was tough because everything on the menu sounded like the best thing ever, but I went with the B.L.T.A.E. and it did not disappoint.  The ranch is also delicious, incase you also hail from the midwest and need a side of it with everything.

I would and will be recommending this place to anyone and everyone that tells me they're taking a trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"Amazing! Everything from the food to the service! It was my first time with a co worker and we will be definitely coming back for more! 

I had the chicken in a waffle... And it was so yummy! Everything about it was delightful! The gravy wasn't overpowering... The chicken was flavorful and juicy! The fries were made well! I had the watermelon juice and it was so yummy!!"}
{"text":"Definitely a fan of MTO Cafe at Downtown Summerlin! My husband and I stopped in for brunch today for the first time. I really liked it - I thought the food was delicious and I really like that it's walk up rather than table service. It's nice if you're not feeling like cooking breakfast at home, but you also don't want to wait for service all morning on a busy Sunday at a restaurant. 

We ordered the waffle with seasonal berries and vanilla whipped cream. The waffle was perfect, with fresh strawberries and blueberries, and I loved their house-made whipped cream! My husband had the tri-tip with eggs and their \"hash mash\", which is hash browns with mashed potatoes in the middle, and yes, it's absolutely as delicious as it sounds. He thought it was good but thought the portion was small for the price. I sneaked a few bites and thought it was super tasty! Apparently they used to use a dry espresso rub for the tri-tip but they don't anymore - kind of a bummer, would have loved to try that! Last note, the coffee was good which always makes or breaks a good spot for me. We had a good experience here this morning and will definitely be back!

Tip: when you pay for your meal, have your receipt sent to your phone. I think it's every five times you pay, you get a coupon for 50% off your next meal. Love that!"}
{"text":"Food was great and the atmosphere was very open and relaxed. I had The Bob which was great. I liked the fact that it was saucy and not dry at all. The french fries were my favorite part. They were crispy, fresh, and not oily at all. The ranch was also delicious. 

We were greeted right when we got in and they have parking in the garage for MTO specifically.

The only thing that was a slight bummer was they couldn't split checks amongst 4 people they could only do it with 2 cards max! Not a big issue though, at least we know to carry cash for next time!"}
{"text":"So, once upon a time there was a group of friends who took an impromptu Vegas trip and they each ended up with a VICIOUS hangover. This hangover needed more than a horrible buffet or some b.s. pancakes from a chain restaurant. But where oh where were we to find the cute for our ailments?! 

Upon turning to yelp, we received our answer...M.T.O.

AMAZEBALLZ! Everything was fresh, delicious and served by an awesome waitress who made excellent recommendations. Each of us ordered something different and we were all equally jealous of what the others had ordered...yet stoked with our own orders.

Seeing as I was still pretty much drunk, I don't recall what I ordered exactly...but I have photographic evidence for assistance. Suffice it to say, it was a monsterous pile of delicious breakfast fare and it didn't last long on my plate.

We had the pleasure of meeting the awesome owner who was more than gracious to our group of traveling drunken fools. This place is excellent...I WILL be back for sure every time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Disappointing. It took 24 minutes to get our eggs. 
1- her egg whites were not egg whites! 
2- she ordered sliced tomatoes as a side and they never showed up.
3- she ordered her omelette without cheese and they put cheese in it.
4- no one told me they put Tapitio sauce over the top of my onion cheese avocado omelette.
5- they were nice enough to remake mine and bring it back quickly but it tasted lousy. I only ate part of it. 
6- on a good note, the people were very nice and the server and cashier were excellent.

They ended up crediting us for the entire meal and we didn't pay. So we left a $10 tip and 3/4 of our food."}
{"text":"I've been to the downtown location twice for brunch.  I'm not really into their brunch menu - not enough choices in my opinion.  Had the salmon eggs both times and it was fine.  The apple donuts are amazing though!  The first experience there was very nice service, and we were a huge group.  The 2nd time was awful.  There were 5 in our party, and the restaurant was only about 2/3 full.  The hostess made us wait for 45 minutes, even though they had a table ready for us.  BUT she said they did not have a server to serve us.  We begged her to just let us sit at the table - we didn't need to order anything until the server was free, but we just wanted to sit down, as there is no seating in the lobby/entrance area.  She said her manager would not allow us to sit, that it was just their policy.  HORRIBLE!
Since then I've been to the Downtown Summerlin location for lunch.  The falafel wrap was good.  And my boyfriend's ruben sandwich was amazing."}
{"text":"Cute little place. Manager greeted us and was so nice and friendly. They had etch a sketches for the kids which was great to keep them entertained. Everyone enjoyed their food. Kids raved about the fries. The only down side was our waitress didn't Crack a smile and was not friendly. She looked like she wanted to b anywhere but there. If we are in the area again we would go back."}
{"text":"Waking distance from the Golden Nugget and other downtown hotels. My wife and I ate here twice during our four-day stay because it was so good!"}
{"text":"Very unexpected for the location! We were staying at a nearby Freemont Street hotel for a bicycle convention and wondered off on our bikes on a Friday morning looking for some brunch. I have to be honest the surrounding area is a little sketch! We came across this super nice and hip looking cafe which happened to have a bike rack. The inside was clean well cooled and played great music! Our service was fast and super friendly and the food was absolutely delicious! I had the bacon pancake dippers, yum yum."}
{"text":"Tried this place. Not my favorite. Food wasn't what I expected. Soup (Tomato Basil) was warm, not hot. It tasted a bit too tart. The grilled cheese was not melted. People were friendly. However, I don't think I will make a trip to go there again."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the breakfast at MTO Cafe. My husband and I stopped here on our last day in Vegas. I ordered the yoga pants breakfast skillet with added mash browns and avocado on top. Everything was delicious. The dish had the right amount of veggies and cheese, nothing overpowered one another it all blended together well and most importantly the dish wasn't greasy. 
MTO Cafe was definitely one of the better restaurants I ate at while in Vegas."}
{"text":"I will just say this. MTO is high post. This is for the budget free eater. My expectations were once again, VERY HIGH. I admit, its a cute spot in a super cool location. The patio action was awesome. But the prices and for what you get on the plate......not impressed. I did enjoy my omelette. It was fresh and the veggies nicely cooked. My companion had a waffle with scambled eggs and says it too was good. Basic good food.....keyword BASIC. I would come back and enjoy the patio again for an overall great weekend brunch."}
{"text":"Excellent fresh food presented in an elegantly unique way by a caring and attentive staff.
We enjoyed the BLTAE, chicken in a waffle and fried apple rings.
Donna was the most!"}
{"text":"The parking here is a pain, I drove around for at least 10 minutes looking for a spot. I was annoyed before I even sat down. 

This restaurant has a funky vibe and all the employees are friendly and seem to be enjoying their job. 

I ordered the hen house wrap with a side of fruit. The oven roasted tomatoes were a nice change from just basic sliced tomatoes. There was a tad too much lettuce but overall the flavors worked well together. The fruit was better than most sides of fruit. Each piece of fruit actually tasted like the fruit and there was not one fruit such as pineapple overpowering all the other fruits.  The person I dined with ordered the queso carne without velveeta cheese. She said it needed a sauce and was expecting it to be thinly sliced instead of cubed meat. The sandwich was supposed to have drunken onions and there were literally three small pieces that blended in with the meat. The sandwich was tasteless until she asked for a side of the chipotle aioli.

I will be back because it's close to my house and all the food seems to be freshly prepared."}
{"text":"Had a great breakfast with my girlfriend here. Mimosas, a veggie scramble on top of mashed browns, and a free cookie with check in. What more could you want on a Saturday morning before day two of Life is Beautiful? Oh yeah, how about a delicious wrap served up by MTO inside the festival? Because they were offering their food in the festival grounds too! Will definitely visit this place again when I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"I ordered the grilled cheese and had a mimosa, it was more than delicious! I had such great service from Emily who had helped a friend in recommending what to eat. Emily was very helpful and knowledgeable with what I was eating. :)"}
{"text":"I had the Chorizo skillet and my wife had the Teriyaki Turkey Burger on a lettuce wrap. Food was flavorful but was lukewarm. Mine wasn't cooked in the skillet that it was served in. Good place, good ambience, just would request that the food be served hotter."}
{"text":"We were heading out to the container park and decided to hit MTO Café for a late brunch beforehand. MTO is located on Main St. just across the street from the new City Hall. And even though I can only think of the Food Network when I see their logo, I really liked the feel of this place. It seems like it's a window into the new downtown vision of hip and cool spots. It is fairly small inside though and even at 1pm, we had to wait about 10 minutes for a table. 

The menu is pretty extensive featuring breakfast, lunch and even a couple vegan options. We decided to start off with an order of the mini donuts. Hey, life's short so eat dessert first, right?! They brought out an order of two donuts that were unfortunately just a step above being raw. I hate sending food back but they were pretty much indelible. Our waitress was great, she apologized, took them back and got us a new order right away. The properly cooked ones were delicious! They have a slightly crisp exterior but soft on the inside and topped with honey and powdered sugar but not overly sweet. Definitely a must try!

I opted for the chicken in a waffle and while I'm not usually not a fan of the sandwich style version, MTO's was a hit for me. It's a bit messy so you'll most likely be knife and forking it anyway. The waffle was great, it's light and fluffy with a hint of sweetness. I thought the chicken was a bit \"soft\" but still very flavorful. It definitely needed to be more crispy. In my opinion though, the star of this dish is the sauce. I'm not sure exactly what it is, though I saw mention of it being a form of béchamel sauce. Whatever it is, it's tasty! It's a bit thick like gravy but was similar to hollandaise sauce in flavor. It's a got a touch spice that balanced out the sweet waffle and trust me, you can just leave the syrup off your plate for this one!

My wife ordered the lemon poppy seed pancakes which were really taste. Moist yet fluffy pancakes with an excellent compute of blueberries and ginger. These are 3 large pancakes and can easily be shared for those with smaller appetites. My son ordered a grilled cheese which was one of the better I've ever tasted in a restaurant and was served with a generously portioned fresh fruit cup. 

If you're looking for a cool spot to grab breakfast or brunch, MTO should be on your list. They have some pretty unique menu items and even serve beer. How can you beat a good brewski to go along with your \"hangover burger\"? The prices are a bit high but that's expected for place like this and they at least make up for it with pretty huge portions. Solid 4 stars all around!"}
{"text":"This place is sooo good. Sunday morning and needed a place to take our college team of nine.  First review said healthy and had lots of stars.  Aly was our waitress.  Seated right away at one table.  They pulled the shades down so the sum was not in our eyes.  Healthy, amazing food.  Every thing was awesome - no poor choices. Coffee was awesome too.  Will come back again!  Portions are large - so you could split an order if you are not a big eater.  Really, really good!  Got us in and out quickly too."}
{"text":"Their food is quite good; there are lots of reviews that attest to that.  But this review is specifically about their awesome customer service.

I had ordered a salad with dressing on the side to go for my friend.  When I got back to my house and she started eating it and noticed that there seemed to be dressing all over the salad.  So I took it back to MTO Cafe (luckily, we're only about 5-7 minutes away) and upon explaining the situation to the manager, she promptly said, \"I want to make this right; is it alright if I get a new salad made for you and refund you for the first one?\"  I wasn't expecting the refund and was taken aback at that and she said that she felt bad that I drove home and had to drive back.  We walked over to the register where a gentleman helped me with the refund and explained to me that the salad had dressing and an aioli.  He said it was completely reasonable to expect that someone who wanted dressing on the side would also want the aioli on the side, and apologized for the mix-up.  

MTO Cafe went above and beyond for us today, definitely making a great impression on me and my friend.  We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing and very cool ambiance. Try the watermelon basil mimosa! Good service and the menu has so many good breakfast and lunch choices!!"}
{"text":"This place was good not great. I had the BLTAE or something to that effect, which was good (albeit too large to actually eat like a sandwich), but everything came out cold. All in all, the food was good, the price was right, the space was clean and bright, and there were bottomless mimosas, so I'm not gonna complain."}
{"text":"Loved the location and easy parking -walk to children's museum! Vegan and vegetarian options and yumminess for the meat lovers too. Kids menu limited but they were happy. Salads were fantastic find in the fresh food desert."}
{"text":"Friendly Staff and Amazing food in a hip up-beat atmosphere! Dont miss the Walnut Tossie"}
{"text":"We had another great meal here at MTO!!  Enjoyed the Body Builder skillet for the first time,  it was awesome!!  Manon, was a great help. But, Aly helped out also!!  Thanks Ben for your two awesome locations!!!"}
{"text":"OMG. People! If you haven't been to this GEM of a restaurant yet, you are missing out. It's my new favorite spot. They opened up downtown only two months ago and I've already eaten there (or from there) like 8 times. And if you know me, that's pretty impressive. 

First off let me talk about the food, it takes center stage. The hangover burger is ridiculous. Angus beef, Tillamook cheddar, fried egg and their house slaw IS OUT OF THIS WORLD. I rarely go back for seconds on burgers, this one i cant get enough of. Also their Caesar salads are just the right amount of garlic (for peeps that like that sort of thing, which i do) and caressed by flaky tender croutons. The breakfast is also amazing. Try their MTO special, 4 kinds of meats, eggs and this amazing mash browns (WHAT...) It's bananas. I never knew how good SPAM was till now. 

Guys, check this place out. It's ridiculous good, I for one am going back to try everything on the menu at least once. 

The staff is super friendly and attentive, and the ambiance is hip and inviting. Truly a great find on my part (good job Dre, your welcome bro). ALSO, 15$ bottomless mimosas or bloody mary's...cant beat that. 

Trust me guys, check this place out, your stomach will be thankful."}
{"text":"MTO Cafe is fully a middle of the road breakfast stop. I enjoy leaving the strip for breakfast whenever I visit Las Vegas and since I was going to the container park anyway I decided to stop by.
 We got seated right away and the wait staff was friendly and attentive. I ordered the MTO Breakfast and the MTO juice. I don't remember what was in the juice but it was delicious. The breakfast is 3 eggs cooked to order, mash browns, bacon, chicken sausage link, spam and toast. This is a LOT of food. I ordered my eggs as over medium, 2 were over hard and the third was barely over medium. The eggs were also just a tad too greasy.
 I think I would go back, but I wouldn't go out of my way to visit."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! I've been here a couple of times and it's definitely worth every calorie! They are very generous with their portions. Service is great, especially when I was there with a table with 20 people for work! My boss loved the ambience, great music selection! Definitely recommend this place to everyone! You have to visit at least once!!"}
{"text":"Worst service in town!  Why can't I leave a -1 Star review???

New Years Day 2014.  My uncle and I sat at the bar as we didn't feel like waiting for a table.  Our waiter promptly brought us our drinks after sitting (coffee).  After that, everything went downhill fast.

We both ordered the $14 MTO breakfast.  We waited 20 minutes for our breakfast.  Sitting next to the open air kitchen, we watched at least 6 party's seated after us receive their food before us.  Every single server there works with blinder's on, so don't expect refills on drinks and the like from anyone other than your server.  All servers there avoid eye contact and all of them walked past our empty coffee cups we intentionally placed at the edge of the bar.  It was almost laughable as servers prepared their drink trays next to our empty coffee cups.

I ordered my 3 eggs scrambled and received 2 eggs fried hard & 1 over-easy...all 3 over-cooked.  I brought this to our waiter's attention and told him that I'd eat them anyway (didn't want to wait an additional 20 minutes for scrambled eggs).  I asked for jelly for my 4 pieces of toast and was given just 1 plastic serving.  My uncle asked for jelly and received the good stuff in a small dish (we shared).  Their hashbrowns are mushy...don't understand how that's possible.

I eventually received coffee refills after throwing dirty looks at the young waitress who brags about also working at the Hard Rock steakhouse.

The manager came by towards the end of our meal and asked how everything was.  I looked him directly in the eyes and replied \"awful\".  He turned his back to me and walked away with no reply.

*Note to locals*  If your considering the MTO special for breakfast here, you'll fair much better at Wildfire with the \"Gambler's Special\" without paying 7x the price (seriously...the Gambler's Special is only $1.99, $2.99 with choice of meat).  The difference (besides the outrageously higher price) is the couple pieces of fruit on a toothpick.  Further, the food and service are much better at Wildfire.

Sitting directly across from the kitchen, we did get a good look at other dishes offered and they looked delicious (especially the wraps).  As much as I'd like to go back, I can't get passed the atrocious service and will never return."}
{"text":"Gave this place a try after seeing the other positive Yelp reviews. The good looking photos of the food and interior didn't hurt either. It's always nice when a new restaurant feels like it could be from almost any urban city. I must say, it feels much nicer in person than the photos suggest. Mainly because of the 14 foot ceilings and the floor to ceiling windows that look out onto the new City Hall. This is a breakfast to lunch place so they close at 2:00 PM on weekdays. We arrived at 1:00 PM on a Tuesday and completely missed the crowds. We were promptly greeted, seated and had out drink orders taken by the enthusiastic waitstaff. Tried to order the Chocolate Chip Cookies with Whole Milk and the Strawberry Cheese Cake, but they had sold out. We did split the Ruben and an order of the Honey Donuts. They were both great. Another pleasant surprise, they serve decent coffee! Personally I would prefer a cup of their coffee over a Starbucks, if only for a change. I am a fan. We will return to try out some other the other menu items that looked good."}
{"text":"The MTO cafe is another great addition to the dining choices at Downtown Summerlin. In door and patio dining are available. The indoor space is brightly lit and has comfortable seating. Ordering and payment is done at the counter and you are given a number to be placed on the table. Our order was taken by a friendly staff member and the food is delivered to the table. Refreshment are unlimited and self serve. Upon our arrival for lunch only one person was ahead of us but after sitting down the line grew to six people.
Food preparation is not fast delivery food but made to order. After our food was delivered a staff member returned to check on our satisfaction.  
Th Rueben sandwich was an ample size and comes with pickles on the side and skinny fries. The sandwich was juicy and tender. The special sauce is fantastic. A nice rye bread complements the sandwich.
The BLT sandwich was huge. Very tasty and half was taken home. This sandwich also comes with skinny fries that are soft inside, firm outside and not greasy.
MTO serves breakfast, lunch and dinner. The menu has many choices that we look forward to experiencing on future visits."}
{"text":"I came to check out the new H&M store located in downtown Summerlin mall. I stumbled upon this cafe which is just right across from H&M store. I've always wanted to try this place out, but it's always busy. I went around 3PM and surprisingly there were no line. I was like wow, on a Saturday? 

I went with a few others and the first thing come to mind when we saw the menu, a bit too pricy. Price ranges from $11.00 to $13.00. I just wanted something light and not too expensive, but since we already there, I figured why not just try it. I figured with that price, I'm sure it was going to be a big portion. 

We ordered two lemon cilantro chicken salad ($12.00) and spicy chicken sandwich ($13.00). Both were okay, nothing different. I'm sure you can find something way less than the menu price elsewhere. Overall, atmosphere is clean, love the location, staffs were friendly."}
{"text":"What a great place. Location was great and parking was a breeze. MTO is attached to the city parking garage so looking for a spot isn't a problem. Also, the parking is cheap ($3 for our 2+ hour visit). But let's talk about the real stuff here....the food...

The menu isn't huge, but the variety is. While that might make you think the choices would be easy, they are not. EVERYTHING looked good. I ordered the bacon pancake dippers and my wife had the Skuna Bay salmon omelet. Both were out of this world. The omelets can all be ordered as wraps or skillets so the \"not huge\" menu will force you to make difficult choices (guess we will have to return). Oh, and the peppercorn syrup that came with the dippers was so unique that I wish they sold it so I could use it at home.

We were there with other friends and their choices were all delicious as well. 

Here's a tip....if you are there in the morning and there is even the slightest chill in the air, sit at the rather large (14 person) community table with your back to the window and the sun beaming in on your back makes your comfort food meal that much more comfy. This will be my new brunch spot for sure."}
{"text":"Food was just okay (big portions though). My food came out 20 minutes before my husbands which was lame. Also, we both used $5 off coupons we had received from a friend and come to find out after we left they had only taken $1 off my husbands bill and $3 off of mine. That is unacceptable and sneaky."}
{"text":"Nice decor but ridiculously over price. I ordered a cold press juice and the size of the glass very small and they only served half of the small glass. 6 DOLLARS for 5 OUNCES of juice. The coffee cup was bigger than the juice. When I ask the serve why the juice was so small,  he pretty much did not care about my opinion. 
I was totally going to com back but after that, no thank you. 
Want a Good advice, just go to greens and proteins you will have better food and a fair price for a healthy juice."}
{"text":"Let's be real - There are no fresh, good food places on the Strip, especially for breakfast. Quick overnight in Vegas and we decided to get out for food before hitting the road to Denver. 

We weren't disappointed! I had the chicken sausage skillet and it was fresh, tasty and quite huge. He had waffles with fresh fruit and that was also excellent. I think overall the food and service is definitely worth of 4 stars but that 5th star.... That is thanks to USB charging ports above each booth because they even care to feed our devices. 

Also, because of the Banksy-style art all over the walls. Awesome. 

Definitely worth the stop in."}
{"text":"Reminded me of a Panera with slightly nicer ingredients. Never better breakfast selection and lunch and they marry their ketchup so watch out"}
{"text":"If it weren't for Yelp, I'd be stranded in Las Vegas at a weekend seminar held at the Golden Nugget. Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of choices inside the Nugget complex and along the raucous back alley aka \"The Fremont Street Experience\" but I wanted something healthy and off-site. MTO Cafe was just a few blocks away but it might as well have been in another city. The decor inside was loft-like -- tall and spacious with a window wall facing the street that let in lots of natural light. The open kitchen in the back featured an orchestrated food performance, on par with Cirque -- OK, maybe a little less surreal! 

The service was pleasant. The menu had plenty of choices, including fresh juices and egg specials for guys like me who are going Keto (high fat, moderate protein and low carb). I got the Body Builder Omelette both days I came along with a Green Juice one day and an MTO Juice the other. The food was fresh and delicious, seasoned just right and served in a little cast iron skillet which kept everything warm as I ate. I consider MTO to be an oasis of sorts. So close to the action and yet something I just know I'll come back to whenever I'm in Las Vegas. Guys -- keep it up and may you remain in business for a long, long time."}
{"text":"Not sure how I haven't reviewed this spot before since I've been here a handful of times over the last two years and each time I'm so happy with my food. 

I came here yesterday with a girlfriend and she ordered the vegan wrap, and I had the veggie skillet. I could tell she wasn't too fond of hers and said the tortilla was too hard, but I loved mine. 


I asked for hash browns instead of the russet potatoes and the chef didn't do it, so they just brought me a side of hash browns instead. Our food also took a ridiculous amount of time (30 minutes.) Much longer than the table that was sat and ordered after us, but there was a full house, and the server was apologetic--even though it wasn't his fault. 

Their coffee is one of my favorites DT, and I always ask for a cup to go!"}
{"text":"We picked this spot cause we were looking for something close to the world market. Mto is a very cool place with nice seating and high ceilings. Lisa was our server I had to remember her name cause she had us laughing the whole time we were in the there, very cool and energetic person. We ordered the lemon poppy seed pancakes, red velvet pancakes and the avocado scramble skillet. All were good but the best was the red velvet pancakes, the fresh juice was awesome small glass for $6 but worth it. The bottomless coffee was good to fresh."}
{"text":"This is one of my new favorite places to eat in Las Vegas. Especially downtown (besides Eat). Believe me when I say that EVERYTHING we ordered was bursting with flavors and the freshness.  I can't wait to go back and bring new friends for lunch or breakfast.

PROS: Corned Buffalo Hash
             Grilled Cheese (brie, honey and toasted walnuts)
             Queso Carne (steak sandwich with drunken red wine onions & velveeta cheese)
             Red Juice (beets, arugula, lime, red bell pepper. . . (other things)

             Carrot & coconut pancakes
             Outside seating (if you have pets)
             The decor
 
This was one of those places I thought would be a overpriced corporate lunch stop so I didn't rush here. . . As usual, I was wrong! They have something really good cooking in that kitchen for everyone!  And like most places I gong before trying. . . I'll be back SEVERAL more times because it's that good."}
{"text":"Great service pleasant waiter  and also friendly. Great pancakes as well. When I come back to Las Vegas to know where I can have an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Cute little place downtown, wasn't busy when I came in on a Sunday morning around 9:30am. Cool that there's easy parking in the garage. Had the \"Kentucky fried chicken\" and I must say that it was pretty delicious! I would come back for it! It's not your typical country gravy, it has a bit of sweetness that made it delightful! Yum. I couldn't finish it and it was really cheap too! $13 for my dish. The chicken was extremely juicy and not dry at all. The fiance had the Hangover Burger and it was juicy as well. He killed it. I would come back to try out the other stuff but I would probably order the same thing because it was so good."}
{"text":"I took my girlfriend here, and the service I received was absolutely flawless! I can't express that enough down to the hostesses and the food I had received, the hangover burger blew my mind and it is what I would recommend to anyone that enjoys food !!

I return shortly !!!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent, coffee is good, but service is lacking. Took about 15 min to get a drink order in and they never came back to refill. Now waiting 1/2 hr for check. So don't come if your in a hurry."}
{"text":"My wife and I are here two days in a row.  The food was very good, not greasy like all the breakfast joints in the casinos. I recommend the MTO juice, it was delicious! I had the Avocado skillet one day, and the BLTA sandwich the following; both breakfasts were fantastic!"}
{"text":"It seems like Vegas has really got this brunch thing down, and MTO is no exception.  MTO has your typical breakfast dishes and also lunch dishes on the menu.  Prices are comparable in the $8-15 range with any other spot in town.  MTO is a little further into downtown than your usual Fremont spots, which means it will probably have less of a wait during primetime hours, but there will still be a wait unless you come after noon.  And beware of the staff here.  They are very slow and it takes a while to get seated, but still a nice meal nonetheless."}
{"text":"Ok got my hipster on for today.  Service was on time for a sunday atmosphere took me back to my Redondo Beach/ Manhatten Beach days but once again its all about the food. I personally had the chicken In the waffle sampled the MTO special breakfast which includes Spam and a chicken sausage. It was all.  Ehhh.  Not impressive but not bad either. I am really kinda on the fence with what we had, perhaps one more try for the lunch menu as it contains some interesting SOUNDING at least sandwiches that would peak my interest. Do the prices match the food. Ehhh perhaps for a hipster just not that family vibe more of a college young entrepenour type of place.......i do like that it offers the free wifi, but that should be expected....ambiance, cleanliness, service ,and something about the table flatware rate it a hard 3.75 the food did not elevate it above that but cannot do a 3.75.    I did end the meal with the fried apple rings ...... Yummmm"}
{"text":"MTO cafe is a nice addition to the downtown restaurant scene. Good variety of sandwiches for lunch. Unique breakfast dishes and good service. The interior is bright and colorful. 

The only thing keeping me from frequenting the restaurant more often is breakfast menu is a la carte. Toast and potatoes are extra. I had an omelette that I had to order a side of toast and potatoes and spent $16 before I even ordered coffee. Way too much money."}
{"text":"This is one of those places where you can get food and feel healthy about it.  Typically these kind of places aren't cheap.  

I got the smoked salmon skillet and was disappointed.  The salmon was red and super salty.  I like salty, but I felt like I was just eating salt.  Comes with cream cheese, dill, eggs, and hash browns.  I like my salmon orange and marbleized, so I'm not sure why this salmon is red.  Was it some sort of dye to preserve the salmon to keep it fresh?  

Maybe I'll give MTO another shot and try something else, but the smoked salmon...never again."}
{"text":"New spot to try lunch was great new England clam chowder was amazing had the turkey melt and that was yummy also will come again to try more super yummy and great outside seating"}
{"text":"Very rarely do I give 5 stars, I'm pretty picky. This place rocks! It's clean, the chairs are so comfy and the customer service is outstanding. Now to the food, I ordered a Kentucky Fried Chicken breakfast and it was delicious. Boyfriend got a berry waffle that he loved. At first I thought the prices were a little high, but totally worth it. Quality and taste is perfect. Can't wait to come back and try another dish."}
{"text":"Our service was A+.  Food was good, but for a place called made to order and focused on fresh ingredients, not sure why REAL maple syrup isnt an automatic instead of the fake maple flavored syrup.  Why not just charge for a side of it and make it available?  Good atmosphere with friendly staff."}
{"text":"The food here was amazing and the fried Apple rings - oh my goodness. I wish they sold them in a larger quantity cause 3 rings just wasn't enough (yes I know I could order more than just one).

The food tasted very fresh and delicious. My husband really enjoyed his MTO breakfast and actually enjoyed the turkey bacon and chicken sausage (that says something for someone who seems to be allergic by anything that is not pig or cow origin). I had to taste the mash browns that tasted just like it sounds - mashed potatoes texture with a crispy hashbrown exterior. 

I opted for the avocado omelet - great as well with tomatillo sauce which I think may be made on site (or it just tasted really fresh). The only item I wish would have been included with my meal would have been toast - that was not included. 

Staff was great and the GM Donna was very attentive and polite. Talked with my husband for a bit and shared her favorite items from the menu. Definitely will come back - we'd return for the fried Apple rings alone."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Will recommend it to anyone visiting Vegas. Had the bodybuilder omelet and the lemon poppy pancakes. Very attentive staff, all very welcoming and pleasant. And they have parking validation for the deck. Free cookie was icing on the cake."}
{"text":"Went for lunch got seated at a micro table .since I am 6'6 I asked for a bigger table I was told I would have to wait fifteen minutes despite there being ample seating at the counter. I left and went to bronze cafe my go to spot downtown. Mto is possibly to hip for me."}
{"text":"Over and beyond food, service, everything! We ordered the lemon cilantro salad with steak, turkey melt, chicken teriyaki (for the kids) and mango drinks. Everything we ordered was DELICIOUS! Great ambiance, kid friendly and good music. Another plus, just a short walking distance from the Discovery Children's Museum. We found a new must eat when in Vegas!!"}
{"text":"What an incredible find. This is our second morning in a row for breakfast. Today we had the Kentucky Fried fried chicken all day breakfast, the MTO breakfast and the Yoga Pants breakfast, oh and the deep fried apples which were light and incredible. Well, I'm sure they have plenty of calories, but who's counting. The fried chicken was light and crispy, place on top of some mashed potatoes, topped off with an egg. Don't forget to add some avocado. This was cooked to perfection, and just the right portions. Our son had the MTO, which included three types of meat, spam, Chicken Sausage, turkey bacon, spam and bacon. mash browns and Sourdough toast. I chose this yesterday morning and honestly this was to much meat for me, but once again this was cooked to perfection. I have to say that this was the best sausage I've ever eaten. Our last selection was the Yoga skillet. This was made with diced vegetables with scrambled eggs. Egg whites are also an option with this choice. My GF had this for breakfast and couldn't finish it all. She also topped this off with sliced avocado. I can't say enough about all of our breakfast meals. Both times we were greeted by Donna, she was so pleasant and made us feel welcome. Both of our servers were so polite and attentive. We will certainly be back on our next trip. It was certainly worth the walk from our casino and a nice change from the normal casino buffet with the crowds to boot."}
{"text":"Wow..... Were we surprised by this place. Finally a real downtown cafe!!!   We explore various new places to try around Las Vegas on a weekly basis....this week we tried out the MTO Cafe.....well let me tell you we will be back.
We arrived early Sunday morning to find that we were the first ones for the day. We were greeted by Matt, one of the owners. He welcomed us and we sat down immediately. The place is  a mix of modern with a retro feel to it. Warm and inviting but very metro.  
We were promptly greeted by our waitress and ordered our drinks....the red juice and green juice.  Both were cold and refreshing. The red juice was full of various fruits and vegetables such as beets and pomegranate.  I could have drank a whole pitcher. My partner loved the green juice. 
The menu for breakfast was short but still full of plenty of hearty choices to satisfy all. We were tempted by the various sweet donuts ( which we ordered to go eat later on .....they tasted sweet, with powered sugar and honey from Nevada . It was friggin fantastic!!!). 
We ordered our meals after speaking with Matt who suggested a few I dishes such as the Kentucky fried chicken, but as tempting as it sounded, we opted for the skillets. My partner had the broccoli with egg whites, cheddar cheese, mushrooms and I think sun dried tomatoes.  The eggs were fluffy and full of flavor. The cheese  was gooey and colorful. I ordered the chicken skillet with eggs, sun dried tomatoes, spinach and turkey sausage. It was just as delicious as my partner's dish. Both were served in a timely manner. Our drinks were refilled and our waitress made sure we were ok a few times. 
The atmosphere was full of music but we were able to have conversation without shouting. 
We will gladly return to try out the lunch menu."}
{"text":"We went for late breakfast on a Sunday.. so of course it was busy. We actually didn't wait too long, but the hostess seemed confused about wait times and where to seat us. No real biggie. We sat at the counter and could see he cooks hustling! There were only two, but they worked hard and banged out meal after meal. It was impressive. That being said, it did take a while to get our food (again, it was busy). Probably 30 min. I had the blueberry poppyseed pancakes. They were good. I'd say above average, and certainly a big order. I took leftover home. My hubby ordered the \"chicken in a waffle\". He loved it. Great gravy. Coffee was tasty and the service was friendly. We'll go back. Rachel was our waitress and she was helpful, friendly and fun."}
{"text":"We came here and had the best burger ever.   Lisa is the best she handed my friend kids melt down very well......come here yummy"}
{"text":"This place is just amazing.  I keep coming here to try everything on their menu. I haven't been disappointed yet. Everything I've tried so far is delicious. My favorites are the Vegan Carrot Pancakes, Curried Zucchini & Summer Squash Spaghetti (at the Summerlin location) with some added chicken, The Bob, The Hero and their farmers market veggies are awesome as well. I know that I'm a green person so their Green Juice is good too if you're into juices.  Check in on Yelp and get a free chocolate chip cookie which will hit the sweet tooth spot. 

Other things I've tried are the Chicken \"in a Waffle\" - it's \"almost\" like any other chicken n' waffle dish, but here's the kicker, and I've never seen it come with this before, but this comes with a gravy sauce.  Thumbs up on the sauce. I've tried the Hen House wrap but I changed the Cesar dressing to the pecan Honey mustard sauce because I liked the sauce on the Bob sandwich so much.  But I think I should have kept the original sauce on there. It would have probably complemented the wrap better.  And the New England Clam Chowder was just okay for me. There's either something missing or there's just something different about it.

Well, HAPPY EATINGS! Until next time!"}
{"text":"Boy where do i start. This place is a hidden gem in downtown las vegas. It was about a 10 min walk from Fremont street. Looked it up on yelp and i figured to give it a shot. First off being able to have a beer for breakfast is awesome. Second comes the food. The menu is small but everything on there sounded amazing. I opted for the Chicken Wrap they have. On the menu it clearly stated it was organic chicken which caught me eye. especially with the price you cant go wrong. Food was delicious and service was awesome!"}
{"text":"The food is great! But oh the wait!!! It took nearly an hour to get our orders (on a 20-30 minute estimate) and it seemed they took orders out of turn. They should really need to work on service. This was not up to the standards of the downtown location."}
{"text":"Fantastic for lunch or snacks. Varied menu with interesting flavors and colorful presentation. Staff are extremely friendly without being annoying. The entire place is very well managed. Service is prompt. Food is served fresh from the kitchen so expect hot food to be hot and fresh. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Vegan carrot & coconut pancakes were excellent. At least as good as they look, if not better. The fried apple rings were delicious. I also had the red juice. It was good, but it's really more for the health benefit than the taste. They do not have sugar free syrup. I tried a taste of the agave with my pancakes, but then used my own Walden Farms pancake syrup. Gotta save some carbs where you can. This was a postworkout meal for me. It was a great breakfast, and I would definitely go again."}
{"text":"Oh MTO you guys never disappoint.  
This is my 3rd time coming here and it's always been equally delicious. 

Here's what we ordered: 

Steak and eggs : 
Came with 3 eggs, hashbrowns, steak, your choice of toast, and choice of avocado (half or whole).
Steak was delicious-- tender. Eggs were cooked perfect. The hash browns were buttery. So good.

K F C :
Fried chicken, mash potatoes, a delicious gravy with a touch of sweetness which actually was amazing with the fried chicken. Ordered it with a side of avocado.  

It was gorgeous outside today so we had lunch outside.  It was perfect.  

Dale! Our guy who actually recommended these plates to us as we were ordering was very pleasant, informative, friendly, kind and attentive.  From taking our order to attending us at our table.  Was a pleasant visit at MTO.  It's a happy vibe at MTO.  Love it.

{"text":"Everything is presented to you beautifully, but unfortunately the coffee isn't strong. And not superb food, to little food... no sides. Overpriced because of location probably? I given this place a real shot, came a few times here with friends. Iv had their Bloody Mary too, not sure if it left a impression, can hardly remember it for that matter."}
{"text":"Wonderful breakfast experience. Clean, fresh, cool. That describes the decor, the staff, and the food. 

I tried the Fat Elvis French Toast and as the server Steve predicted, it was life changing. It's a must!"}
{"text":"So sad and disappointing the 2nd time around.  The only reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because the first time I went it was a 5-star experience, but this time it was a 1-star experience.  Which was extra awful because I raved about it and brought my boss and co-worker... and then it sucked.

The server told us they had sauvignon blanc and they didn't.  No biggie, but combined with the rest of the service, it showed a server with a complete lack of knowledge of food and alcohol.  We ordered the Celery Sucker wrap, tomato soup, and green juice, all of which was awesome the first time around.  Juice and soup were good, Celery Sucker was terrible.  It didn't look right to me, and tasted bland and plain, and halfway into it I realized they didn't include the baba ghanoush--the main component of the wrap.  This is the equivalent to leaving out the hamburger patty in a cheeseburger.  So we asked about it, and the server told us they were out of baba ghanoush.  So why didn't they tell us that before they brought us these crappy wraps??  She didn't ask to substitute something in for it, like avocado.  They just hoped we didn't notice that half the ingredients weren't in the icky wrap.  So not only did the wrap suck, but they hoped we were stupid--you can't do that in Vegas, too many foodies here.  The server didn't apologize or ask to bring us something else; she didn't do ANYTHING.  She didn't even smile the whole time we were there.  She came off as generally not bright... so maybe I can't blame her??  Regardless, it was TERRIBLE service.

To top it all off, they'll validate your parking ticket, but the dumb bartender only validated part of it so we had to run 75 cents on a credit card because the machine doesn't take cash.  Awesome.

Needless to say, my boss and coworker were not impressed.  Don't know if I'll be back... if it weren't for the first time I went to MTO (when the food and service was excellent), I wouldn't give it another chance."}
{"text":"Food was ok but incredibly overpriced for a counter service restaurant. MTO breakfast was good. Lemon poppyseed pancakes were quite dry and had no lemon flavor."}
{"text":"Service was friendly, albeit spotty. Water refills were hit or miss with the amount of people. Sat at the bar, place was packed at the time. Prices and wait weren't too bad, but then again I went by myself so it's a little bit easier to find a space.

I had ordered the Kentucky Fried Chicken, the mac n cheese, and a bloody mary. The bloody mary was decent, if you want it spicy ask for it for sure and they'll adjust. The mac n cheese was tasty though a bit runny. The crackers on top are just crumbled ritz crackers and add a salt factor to the dish. I wanted more from the mac n cheese though, it wasn't as hearty as I would like. The KFC was the noms though. The chicken was cooked well but lost it's crispness to being covered by the egg as well as the gravy. Wanted a bit more of the mash browns to provide a nice starch blanket at the bottom. I wish I had added bacon in retrospect but I think that's cuz I wanted more of a salt factor from the gravy itself, and more gravy also. Keep in mind this is a heavy dish though so if you have a nap in mind, this would be perfect to set things up.

I'd stop by again if I was in the area, more to try some of their vegetarian options. My road to recovery that day needed the giant meal and the nap. If you have a large group though, plan ahead, send someone first. Seating can be pretty limited."}
{"text":"Long wait on a Sunday. Food wasn't what we expected. The French onion soup was slimy and tasted more like wine than anything. The tomato soup was really thick and tasted like spaghetti -o's. Water was from the tap. The French fries were cold and tasted old. Maybe we ordered the wrong thing but no one liked their food. We ordered the fat Elvis, Turkey melt, Turkey burger. It was expensive and not worth it."}
{"text":"Bumping my previous review rating to 5-Stars.

Breakfast can be eaten at anytime of the day at MTO. My colleague and I dropped in here on a not-so-busy lunch day and shared orders of the MTO Breakfast and Lemon Poppy Seed Pancakes.

MTO Breakfast: This three eggs prepped any style, mashbrowns, and your choice of meats and breads. When we saw Spam as an option, we requested they just make our order all spam with a side of scrambled eggs and sourdough bread. Personally, this would've tasted bomb with rice (can't help it, I'm Asian), but it was still tasty. 

Lemon Poppy Seed Pancakes: Three pancakes with blueberry-ginger compote, which it could've used more of; however, that's a minor complaint. Overall, these flapjacks were perfectly fluffy and delish!

Service: Accommodating, attentive, and upbeat. 

Overall: MTO's the spot to have breakfast for lunch on this side of town."}
{"text":"Orders in the \"window\" and no ones taking them out, yet there's plenty of employees working.  Had time to write this post bcuz its taking foooooooooorever for my fries and chicken strips"}
{"text":"Love this spot. Tasty food and insanely friendly and fast service. Skillets in particular are super good. A real Vegas gem."}
{"text":"My husband and I just ordered a delivery through Uber Eats. We got red velvet pancakes and lemon poppy blueberry pancakes. I can't speak for the actual location, but these pancakes are delicious! Lots of fresh fruit and a generous amount of toppings. I would definitely check out the actual restaurant."}
{"text":"I love this trendy little spot. I love that they have an outlet at the table if you wanna bring your laptop and offer free WIFI.. 

We stopped in for breakfast on the 4th of July so it was pretty quiet. It's near city hall so I imagine during the weekday non holiday it's preeteh busy. 

 I had the vegan pancakes which were good and my husband had an omelet. The food was good and the service was as well. Didn't take long for us to get our food and it was hot and fresh when it arrived. I loved how it had that downtown feel and loved how personable the staff was with everyone. I'd really like to go back and try more options on the menu, not that I have many but the hubby does. I am just happy to have this as a choice, it gives me a  downtown  casual type place to eat. Its these little spots in Vegas that keep this local feeling normal."}
{"text":"MTO is a great place for brunch in downtown Vegas!  It is definitely located off the beaten path but don't let that deter you.  The ambiance inside is really cool and modern.  Lots of windows and natural light pouring in which is pleasantly perfect for mid-morning brunch.

We were a group of 5 and had to wait about 15 minutes for a table but we didn't mind.  We sat at a big high top by the window.  Our server was very friendly and spent some time joking with our table.  The lunch menu looks great as well!  

- $15 bottomless mimosas or bloodys.  Not a bad deal but they are a little slow on the refills 

- egg dishes were great; you can order them as a wrap, skillet or omelette.  You just get some sliced tomatoes with the omelette which is a little unfortunate for the price

- if you like pancakes, get the vegan carrott and coconut pancakes!  don't let the vegan part turn you off.  These were delish

- mash hash - yum!  basically hash browns on top of mash potatoes.  Can't believe I've never thought of that one before.    

- And don't forget the free chocolate chip cookie for checking in on yelp!  fresh out of the oven."}
{"text":"Whoop! Parking very easy in the garage next door to MTO and they validates! A Deal right there!  
The decor of MTO is very retro.  The atmosphere felt uncluttered and relaxing.

We started with the Apple Rings.  This is a must have treat!

My waitress recommended the broccoli, egg whites, spinach, Tillamook cheddar, jalapeno, mushrooms but add chorizo.  GREAT recommendation!  It was serve in an actual skillet.

It's off the path a bit but worth the effort!"}
{"text":"This place has such a bright atmosphere. Ryan was our server and made sure everything was perfect. S/O to the cooks because the food was DELICIOUS! I will for sure be back."}
{"text":"Great service! Mike the GM is very professional took care of us. Food is amazing!

Definitely coming back!
5++"}
{"text":"If I could leave 0 stars I would. This is the third time they have either totally forgotten my order or gotten it wrong. I waited 25 minutes for my order only to be told they must have lost it and hadn't even started it. And I barely even got an apology or a refund for an order that did t exist. Go anywhere else."}
{"text":"This place rocks. Pleased to hear they opened another outlet in Summerlin. I'm so there soon. Ended up here quite by accident after driving around looking for a place to take two hungry kids and adults post Discovery museum trauma.

I had the tomato soup w cheese toast. It was tremendous. Kids had grilled cheese, and friend had the Bob Wich that was apparently excellent. Eye spying other tables, could have ordered any of it and been good to go. Fun ambience. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times and love the food but today's service was horrible! Hire more staff and smile ladies! I probably won't be back for a while."}

3 stars for parking (parking garage)

1 star for the menu. (VERY SMALL .. VERY..) 
2 stars for speed of food coming out 
1 Star for portion sizes ($7 for ONE kids pancake.. as in One single pancake, lol) 
1 star for prices. (A little overpriced) 


Overall, a very cool spot!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of MTO's Downtown location and the Downtown Summerlin spin off doesn't disappoint either. Their version of Kentucky fried chicken ($13) is similar in name only to the fast food spot with the same name. The chicken here has a thick, well seasoned crust that virtually cracks open. With two eggs over easy, mash browns, and country gravy, this is one of the better breakfast dishes around. Other breakfast dishes are well crafted, like the chorizo skillet and you can't go wrong with the bacon dippers --strips of bacon covered in pancake batter.

The juicy patty and the salty and sharp blue cheese in the black and bleu burger ($13) make a for a great combo. But, you'll need plenty of napkins while eating it. Save some of those napkins for the chicken in a waffle ($13) too. Covered in country gravy along with maple syrup it can be messy but delicious. Their version of chicken pot pie ($15) uses biscuits instead of a typical pastry crust topping, but flavors come through, just the same. It's creamy and packed with pulled chicken, although it could have benefitted from more vegetables.

They've also got a kid's menu with chicken fingers, waffles, and grilled cheese sandwiches. For fast-casual comfort food with a modern twist, they've got all the bases covered for the whole family any time of day."}
{"text":"Glancing at the menu I wasn't that excited. Breakfast items sounded typical and lunch items were slightly more intriguing. What drew me in was the name of the chef/partner, Johnny Church, who doubles as the chef at RM Seafood and Rx Boiler Room and previously worked at The View in Tivoli Village. The concept of elevated comfort food made from mostly locally sourced ingredients pays off in a big way. Dishes are expertly executed with passion and refinement that you won't find in most breakfast and lunch spots.

With a Yelp check-in we received complimentary walnut tossies. I've never heard the name before, but they're similar to tiny little tarts with a thick, buttery crust. That was followed up with an order of MTO mini donuts ($7). Firm in texture with a lightly crispy exterior, they arrived three per order covered in powdered sugar and honey.

My favorite dish was Chicken in a Waffle ($13). Tender chunks of breaded chicken smothered in a country gravy were sandwiched between light and crispy waffles and topped with fresh berries. The dish had everything you could want -- savory proteins accompanied by the sweetness of the fruit, the airiness of the waffles and the combination of tender, crispy, crunchy textures. The mound of skinny fries that came with it weren't bad either.

On a somewhat lighter and healthier side was the vegan carrot and coconut pancakes ($11). Don't let the vegan label scare you. The light and fluffy texture make them as good as most pancakes out there.

The biggest, and maybe the only, low point of the meal was the Fat Elvis ($13). It's French toast with banana, bacon, peanut butter, strawberries, and nutella. Sounds like a mouthful, right? It was and not in a good way. The peanut butter and nutella combo made it so dense and heavy that I could only stomach a few bites. Ok, maybe more than a few, but it was one dish i couldn't finish. And I almost always clean my plate.

Next up was one of the best grilled cheese ($11) sandwiches I've had containing brie, honey, and toasted walnuts between slices of brioche. And, finally rounding out the meal was their Thanksgiving burger ($14). An open-faced moist turkey patty sitting atop a bread pudding \"bun\", topped with an orange-cranberry sauce with a side of mashed browns. It was all delicious. Turkey burgers are usually gross, but I'd come back for seconds.

I was skeptical. The menu at first glance didn't sound inspiring. But, their ability to almost flawlessly elevate comfort food won me over. With a menu that is scheduled to change based on seasonal ingredients, there's plenty of reasons to return."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch today with my family. I'm not opposed to the fast casual concept but this place was priced for full service. I had a simple grilled cheese sandwich (can't eat Brie so I ordered the kids version). My daughter had the kids pancake. $7 for ONE pancake with no sides. Husband had a sandwich and we all had fountain drinks and our bill was $36. We could've eaten somewhere much nicer for that price. Food was mediocre at best. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Great breakfast and a lots of options to choose from. Great and quick service!  Loved the broccoli omelet, nice way to start my day!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place no stars I would. The service was absolutely terrible. We waited over 30 minutes at the counter and no one ever greeted us. There was a nice couple waiting longer than us and they received no apology for their wait even though there were empty seats. Once that couple was seated we still were not greeted and they didn't put our name on this list. We were ignored the whole time we were there. I ended up leaving along with my group because of the way we were treated. Very disappointed in the service. Will not recommend anyone eat here"}
{"text":"Came back to Vegas and stopped by MTO Cafe for brunch. Had such a great experience. Good was tasty and quick - portions are very large and we could have ordered only 2 plates between the 4 of us. We got the Signature breakfast (3 eggs, toast, hash browns, spam, bacon and a chicken sausage), the pancakes which were ginormous, the BLTAE ( BLT + avocado and a sunny side egg) and hen house (chicken wrap). All was delicious. Our server was incredibly attentive (not like our first visit 2 years ago) and we also enjoyed spicy bloody Mary's. This is walking distance from the downtown Fremont Street hotels and just a gem of a place. Definitely would recommend anyone staying downtown to check them out."}
{"text":"Lemon Cilantro chicken salad was refreshing! Dressing is a little tart, but still good. The \"KFC\" was good, but wasn't fond of the sweet cinnamon like gravy. Delicious smoothies, Ok food, excellent service. Oh and love the farm-to-table concept."}
{"text":"Excellent!!!!! Made my 'party' follow me on a field trip from the golden nugget. Well worth the trek!!! Loved it!!!"}
{"text":"Came in from California and met with the family here.  The service was impeccable and the food was great. I had Plain Jane Waffles and an Avocado Omelet.  Yummy!    I need a nap now. Great location and very friendly staff. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Tired this place yesterday with my cousin, she told me about it and this was my experience. It was really busy, as it was Sunday at noon, and our wait was less than 10 for a table! It's a small space but it's so modern and elements of different cities is all around. Our server was really friendly and attentive throughout and I noticed the owners were there talking with everyone, I loved that! I ordered the chicken \"in a waffle\", it was sooo good! Super tender crispy fried chicken sandwiched between fluffy waffles and then gravy alll over! I added syrup to it, wasn't served with any and def put syrup on it. Great portions and a bonus, they serve it with fries. Made my Sunday! Coffee was great too :)"}
{"text":"Great spot after a late night in Vegas. Coffee was the best I've had in Vegas and the food was amazing! The powdered Apple rings were top notch!"}
{"text":"Service was great and accommodating of a large party of college kids. Bottomless mimosas are always a good thing on a Tuesday around noon. I had a side of bacon extra crispy, had to send it back because it came out too flaccid the first time, and I don't eat no flaccid bacon; I like my bacon firm and crispy, not flopping everywhere all moist and bouncy. Bacon came out perfect on the second try. For the main I went with the chicken in the waffle, side of fries extra crispy, cuz I don't eat no flaccid potatoes either. Chick n waff was pretty good, its like a chicken sandwich with gravy on top in between two halves of a Belgian waffle. I enjoyed it. 'Mercia."}
{"text":"I've ate at both locations now, the downtown & downtown summerlin location.. Food is great.. a little overpriced for the portions, but so yummy.. I tried the fat elvis & also the bacon pancake dippers.. soo good.. :P"}
{"text":"MTO Cafe is easily one of the best places in summerlin. Every item I've had has been delicious. My conclusion is that these chefs are way over qualified and I'm glad I get to enjoy their cooking regularly. Each meal seems to be so clean and well put together, As if only the best ingredient had been  hand picked individually to create the meal.

     I recommend this fine establishment to any and all who are looking for an overly delicious meal at a fraction of the price it's worth. To include to an already fantastic eating experience, the staff is as good as they come. Carrying themselves with professionalism, each employee exceeds all standards by having excellent attitudes, genuine politeness and always having a welcoming smile. MTO Cafe has the recipe for success, others should take note. Well done guys and gals, well done."}
{"text":"Delicious healthy food with great flavor combinations. Coffee options are decent and I really enjoyed their lavender infused drink. Great atmosphere & friendly staff. Great place for a quick bite and side convo with your bestie or breakfast with your significant other. Overall 5 stars!! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"There were several good options for breakfast when I checked Yelp for our visit to Vegas (we were staying off the main strip that morning). We decided on this one as it had good reviews and was closest to where we were at. 

We were quite disappointed. I feel like they were trying to be too creative and forgot some of the basics. I'm from the Bay Area and have been to plenty of trendy restaurants similar to this, but thought this fell flat. My wife got the Fat Elvis (bananas, nutella, and peanut butter stuffed between two large slices of french toast with strawberries on the side) and I got the chicken and waffles. We basically split the two plates to try them both. 

I like sweet breakfast foods, but the flavors of the Fat Elvis just didn't work for either of us. It may have been the combination of the nutella with peanut butter. Aside from that, the actual french toast was pretty lackluster. The waffle part of the chicken and waffles was bland--I can make much better waffles at home. The chicken was fine, but the sauce they used on top of the chicken wasn't that great. I've only had chicken and waffles one other time, and it was amazing there, so maybe the bar was set to high for me. The fries that came with the chicken and waffles were pretty good. 

We came in at an odd hour (about 10:40am), so we were the only ones there part of the time. The service was very friendly. But the two meals we got were ones recommended by the waitress, and we just were not fans of them.

For the price (our meals were $13 each), I would have hoped for a lot better."}
{"text":"Came here earlier with my boyfriend to grab breakfast- there was quite a line when we walked in but it moved very quickly- they were definitely well staffed for a busy Sunday morning. We ordered the Greek omelette and the apple cinnamon French toast- absolutely delicious! The French toast was fluffy and the apples were perfectly caramelized- it wasn't too sweet and the cinnamon complemented it perfectly. The omelette was just as amazing- very flavorful and cooked perfectly! Our food came out quickly even though it was busy and we were able to get in and out in just about 40 minutes. Really enjoyed our experience here and surely will be back!"}
{"text":"Ordered teriyaki steak bowl it was little bits and pieces of meat on a spicy hot sauce. Also if you want water out of soda fountain they charge you a ridiculous $2.59 for a 8oz clear cup."}
{"text":"I stopped here for lunch today and had the buffalo Ruben sandwich.  I have to say it is one of the best Rubens I have ever had and I like good Ruben.  The fries were also good, but nothing special.  A little on the high side price-wise for a sandwich at a counter service restaurant considering Jason's deli also does a really good one under $10."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with some coworkers.  We were excited to something new Downtown.  I ordered the Hen House, it was a decent size but unfortunately it had no flavor, so I only ended up eating less than half of it.  My coworker ordered the Grilled Cheese and she absolutely hated it.  It was SO SMALL, it looked like croutons. It came with a \"salad\" which were some mixed greens on the plate, no dressing nada. My other coworker had the Chicken in a Waffle and she really liked it.  The place is very nice and the staff are amazing so I was sad that my meal was so disappointing.  Also, a bit pricey for what you get.  I know they have not been open long so hopefully things will improve!"}
{"text":"The Sustainable Tuna was amazing.  The Blueberry Pancakes were off the hook.  This place is a no-brainer."}
{"text":"MTO Café is the perfect place for lunch at downtown summerlin. If you're tired of local chain restaurants, MTO Café is the place since the original one is in downtown LV! I got the BLTAE sandwich and it is truly a MEAL. It tasted amazing. I ate here at 3 pm and was super full with the sandwich! In the BLTAE, the avocado was super fresh. The French fries were also really good! I finished the entire BLTAE and felt accomplished afterwards."}
{"text":"Good food. A bit overpriced. Mediocrate service at best. 

5 minutes after we ordered a group of 6 walked in, ordered and sat down. They all got their food one by one, while our measly 2 dishes were no where in sight. 

No one stopped by to say \"Hey, sorry we served everyone else but you it's just that [insert excuse here]. But we are working on it. Thank you for being patient, not walking out and giving us a 1 star review on Yelp.\"

With a fussy hungry toddler I told them to pack the food to go. Another 10 minutes passes, finally I see them packing something. They hand it to me with a \"Thank you. Have a good day!\" No \"sorry it took half an hour\".
After shopping at Lush down the street with amazingly attentive, considerate and well trained staff, I wish THEY served food.

My second time here and the first wasn't a great experience either. My friend got her food after the whole group was well done eating but at least the manager was nice, he appologized and gave us free cookies. 

I don't think I'm coming back, this area is teaming with food joints eager to earn new, happy customers."}
{"text":"I'd award a 3 1/2 I could. Why not a 5? For me a couple of reasons. First the music was way too loud, which made conversation really hard. I had poached eggs and they came out really undercooked, to be fair they fixed it with some great eggs. Food was generally good and staff were helpful."}
{"text":"Had lunch here a couple times and liked it.  Found they have an app with free delivery, and now have it delivered semi regularly.  Great breakfast and I like the turkey melt made as a wrap.  They always have super fresh food.  Healthy, yummy, and convenient for downtown."}
{"text":"5 stars...no, wait...6 stars!!!  Lisa, our server, and Donna, GM, completely took care of us and blew us away with not only GREAT FOOD but genuine hospitality and overall niceness.  We really enjoyed our visit.  Thanks very much!"}
{"text":"Staff was nice and my sandwich, the hero was good.  My fiancé got a spinach salad which looked good on the menu but was just spinach and tomatoes.  When she asked about the list of items like the \"root vegetables\" she was told that tomatoes are root vegetables and mint was in the dressing.  Now I have grown tomatoes for years and never have seen them classified as  root veggies.  Whatever..."}
{"text":"Cute place that was fairly busy for breakfast at 10. Friendly staff. Food was a little slow on coming and forgot to bring our smoothies we ordered. Poppy seed pancakes were good and was a generous serving"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat, now that I've discovered the B.L.T.A.E. (bacon, lettuce, tomato and egg) sandwich. To be honest, I don't think I've tried anything else and I've eaten here many times. And I'm not a big french fry person, but I love theirs. 

Employees are always welcoming and on it! Very friendly, outgoing staff despite how busy it may be at lunch time. Atmosphere was spot on for me.

Great location downtown because it's connected to the City Hall parking garage and they'll validate part of your parking fee. 

I've taken several friends to lunch here, all of them enjoying what they've ordered. I believe they'd all be repeat customers as well."}
{"text":"coconut carrot pancakes are to die for! I couldn't believe it was vegan. It comes with a stack of 3 pancakes and the flavors are amazing together. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"So stopped in today.  Ordered the red velvet pancakes and BLTAE sandwich.  It was super busy and the food took a bit long to arrive.  I was a little upset bc the sandwich was cold so I sent it back.  They brought out a fresh one and it was very delicious.  I was already satisfied at this point.  Then someone...maybe manager? Came to the table with a refund for the sandwich and three warm cookies!  Kudos to MTO for amazing customer service.  We are definitely not customers who generally complain or look for a refund.  Will return for sure!"}
{"text":"Tasty food in a fun atmosphere. It's trendy, but substantial, too. I tried the carrot pancakes. Yum! The service was lackluster, but that's to be expected in an area that has a built-in clientele in the downtown, municipal, and intrepid tourist crowd. All in all, it's definitely a nice place for a get-together on a Saturday brunch, or after work. Not a place that I would frequent. Once or twice is enough."}
{"text":"Still loving this place but serving my eggs and side of vegetables (after 15 minute wait) alongside with my check during a 2/3 empty Monday time is just in poor taste. This feels yucky especially to a lone diner who may already be feeling self-conscious. 

Besides that, all was delish. My side of market vegetables had no spinach this time, just chopped broccoli and tomatoes but still very fresh and tasty. The cost of a soy latte ($3) is so refreshing, coming from the Bay Area."}
{"text":"Coffee, coffee, coffee...doesn't have to be Sambalatte quality but match Micky Ds. I'm hoping I just had a bad brew, but if you serve breakfast offer a solid brew. I'm all for do it yourself, but put the cream and sugar on my TABLE I don't wanna have to get up and go to the counter if I have another cup because the first one was weak. Done with that rant. Food was awesome,  waffles were fluffy, and the mto breakfast was cooked excellent. The best thing here: MASHED HASH BROWNS absolutely something to start your day eating a hybrid of chive mashed potatoes and crispy hash browns. I'll return, but its not the best breakfast I'd had in Vegas. Best in downtown Summerlin though. Ha!"}
{"text":"Looking at the food coming out of the kitchen,  the sandwiches looked really impressive.  However, i opted to try the breakfast.  

The food is very average, nothing really amazing for breakfast.  I ordered lemon poppy seed pancakes with blueberry ginger compote.  Each of my 3 pancakes was unlevened or flat and totaled less the 3/4 of an inch high for the stack of 3. The compote was thin an runny, more of the consistency of a thin sauce. The flavor profile was ok, what was lacking was the execution of technique. However the ingredients were fresh. I will have to try them for lunch hopefully my experience will be better.  For now I will stick to one of my 7 favorite places for brunch.

Cost: $15 pancakes & soft drink+ Tax & Tip $3 + $1.50 for 1 hour of paid parking = $19.50 for below average pancakes with no meat side.  

Time: 11 am 
Restaurant:  less then 1/2 full. 

Service, is friendly yet attention to guest needs improvement. In my observation servers could work specifically on anticipating guest needs."}
{"text":"The best breakfast I've had in a very long time. Highly recommend it. Lisa was my server and she was extremely nice, attentive and helpful with the menu. The food quality and and customer service was great!"}
{"text":"Nice, quiet place not far from Fremont Street with very good food, reasonable prices and excellent service."}
{"text":"Nice breakfast/lunch spot in the downtown area serving up some tasty comfort food using fresh ingredients.  We came here kind of early on a weekday so there weren't that many people in the restaurant which was nice.

I got the Kentucky fried chicken which is a piece of boneless fried chicken with a bacon country gravy, on top of an interesting \"mash brown\" potatoes, and topped with 2 eggs.  The chicken was nice and crispy and the gravy rich.  The potatoes were pretty creative, it's mashed potatoes coated with shredded potato and fried like a hash brown.  The exterior is crispy like a good hash brown but the center is soft and creamy mashed potato.  The dish was pretty yummy.

Mark H got the steak and eggs.  It's a garlic marinated steak with the mash brown potatoes and three eggs, another filling breakfast.  I had a taste of the steak and it was good, flavorful and pretty tender.

The restaurant is in the building with the parking structure for the City of Las Vegas government building.  You can park in the structure and MTO will validate your parking.  One thing to be aware of is there's a guy in a government golf cart type mobile that's constantly on the move looking for parked cars with any kind of violations.  Unfortunately our car's registration was expired (we had the new one in the glove but forgot to put it on) definitely our fault but the guy somehow broke our windshield wiper when putting the ticket on the car....grrrr."}
{"text":"They have the best vegan pancakes I've ever had. I was skeptical about the carrot shavings it has, but it really gives the pancakes a good combo of flavors. Portions are very big. Definitely shareable if you're not looking for a big meal.
My only complaint was that the café had rock n roll music playing. That's Not something I want to hear early in the morning. Other than that, I'm definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Great place to enjoy brunch, everything I had was delicious, the pancakes, fried apples, quinoa salad... amazing! Staff was very pleasant which is always a plus!"}
{"text":"Ate here for brunch, got 'The MTO Breakfast'.  What a lot of meat!  My goodness.. I appreciated the variety but wasn't a huge fan of either the sausages or the turkey bacon.  Regular bacon and spam were of course yummy.  My eggs were cooked as I asked, no complaints there.. so why 4 stars instead of A-OK? The best part of this breakfast was the Mash Browns.. I don't know what that smushy stuff was on them but it was delicious!  Also the sourdough that came with breakfast was just perfect.  Good coffee too - this is definitely a nice brunch spot - worth a trip outside the strip to try something different.."}
{"text":"We come every time we are in town.  Place is the bees....  even when the ordering gets messed up and food takes 45 min it's well worth the wait.  I'll camp out for 24 hrs to eat at this place.  The \"mashbrowns\" are to die for.  We will be back tmrw."}
{"text":"This place is amazing and very accommodating! We were just passing through Vegas and consider ourselves very lucky for finding this place."}
{"text":"Good everything but really bad customer experience. 

When I walked in the server said they have free parking offering the validation ticket to the next parking lot which you could use following by your parking ticket when leaving. And when I was about to leave the cafe I asked again should I went to the paying machine or directly to exit, and the answer is directly to exit by one female manger biteing chewing gum.

But when the time I was leaving I still have to pay another $1.5 by credit card (international transaction) besides the validation ticket offering. And you have no chice but paying on the spot cause you were stuck there with a line behind you. 

The $1.5 was not big deal but the experience was really bad with incomplete information so I went back to ask the reason why and got 3 different explanation...

First one is I have to go to payment machines first then to exit by another server. Second answer by the prevuious server was they only provide 1hr validation card and he was sorry for that, which I believe is true however I was not told. 

The last one answer got from female manager (accompanied asides during the conversation) was it was written on top of the card and they ALWAYS explain that, which I strongly believed I didn't catch any part of that during the 1.5hr brunch time, and she insisted they always do while keep chewing her gum... 

Anyway, nice food and all the outlook. But the whole experience was really bad been given misleading information and not friendly AT ALL (the manager) replying while providing feedback...."}
{"text":"I've seen it whenever I've driven in and outta DTLV but, never thought to give it a chance til me and the BF had to kill some time before I started work.

Unlike other cities, finding street parking for MTO (right next to City Hall in Downtown Vegas) was a breeze; and only $2 for 2 hours.

We entered to a very cute interior, think modern diner. Turns out that BF knew the manager, Mike, and he seated us and intro'd us to the menu and what's really good (which is truly EVERYTHING). 

Considering it was just the two of us, we ordered quite a lot of things.

Green juice, latte, black ice tea, salmon skillet, tomato basil soup, the Hangover burger, side of (chicken apple) sausage, and complimentary apple donuts.

My salmon skillet was HUGE. I was not expecting it to be that big. Generous portions of lox on top cream cheese on a bed of fluffy dill scrambled eggs and potatoes. I don't normally eat scrambled egg but, this had to have been my favorite part of my meal.

The BF's tomato basil soup came with grilled cheese and he was pleasantly surprised because he still had the burger and fries coming.
I thought the tomato basil soup and grilled cheese on texas toast was the best I've had...I think much better than Nordstrom's infamous soup/grilled cheese combo! The toast alone was delicious and tasted better when I ate it later in the day. The soup wasn't too sweet or basil tasting as others tend to be, which I loved!

THEN, the Hangover burger came out and it was deliciously huge, too. Who doesn't like it B.I.G.?!!!
Fried egg on top of burgers can never go wrong. The bun(s) were toasted which added a little crunch to the burg. Fries were thin and not oily which is always amazing. It was, also, accompanied with buttered sandwich pickles, YUM.

Apple donuts were a pleasant surprise, too. Mainly cause I was expecting a donut type of dough with apple flavors but, it's actually an apple ring with dough and cinnamon & maple syrup around it. Reminds me of a mini apple pie =)


Overall, amazing experience and I'm surprised I was never here sooner. Excited to go back ASAP!!!!!"}
{"text":"Good eating!
    So this place is the kind of walk up order food then they serve you. I don't know what that is called....hmmm. The food is actually good. I had the tomato basil soup with a strangely small grill cheese. I say this because the soup portion is out of proportion to the grill cheese. You kind of want a little more to deal with all that soup. I don't know crackers  or something? My friend had the chicken pot pie and was in seventh heaven . For a cold night it hit the spot. The mac and cheese is good but they do use a lot of velveeta so the flavors of the other cheeses fade a bit. Definitely will eat here again. Not overpriced and definitely a great stop to eat. Fun drink machine and helpful workers round out a positive experience!"}
{"text":"All the way from LA! Food was exceptional, service was great! Fresh squeezed orange juice and great coffee.  I have nothing to say, but awesome!"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast. 

We came in based on the reviews and the short walk from Fremont Street. 

We split the steak and eggs plate. It included toast and hashbrowns. The steak was flavorful and cooked perfectly, and the hasbrowns were nice and crispy. Everything was delicious, and service was efficient. 

My wife had the coffee, and said it was good. 

I also got the fried apple ring to go. It looked and smelled really good, but by the time I got to eat it, it was cold and not as good. 

Overall, great experience."}
{"text":"Great portions, small but on point menu. Definitely a return place. Chicken IN Waffles... Are you kidding me!"}
{"text":"Service is great! Thank you Steve. Very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. Coffee was fantastic...Lavazza (brand)...very smooth. Free chocolate chip cookies with your check in. Insane chocolate cookies! Super soft and gooey.  On the server's recommendations, we had the \"KFC\" and the \"Fat Elvis\". OMG...the sweet (Elvis) paired perfectly with the savory (KFC). The Fried Apple rings were just an added bonus to this delectable meal. The chicken was crispy even though it had gravy on it. The gravy had a nice consistency and flavor. Did not hide the flavors in the breading of the chicken and was great. I recommend sharing a few plates and ending on the savory. Delicious and will definitely come back."}
{"text":"What can I say about this place?
It's my go to farewell Vegas brunch every time I come to Vegas. It's tiny, intimate, and clean. The service is amazing and everyone who works here is so helpful and make you feel so special. Their grilled cheese is wonderful. Their pancakes are crack. And their bacon is stellar. I had a BLTA with egg last time I was here and was so pleased. There's just something about a runny yolk all over my food. So velvety and sinful. Their bacon pancake strips are also bomb. And btw their fried chicken is one of my favs. Mimosas are great, their juices are delish, and an amazing cup of joe. It's my Vegas tradition y'all."}
{"text":"Awesome place!!! Very good food!!! Very cool server... plus a free cookie just by checking in @ yelp. will definitely come back... Can't believe i finished my meal!"}
{"text":"Because it was just THAT good...I didn't even pause to take a \"before\" pic LOL! The pic is demonstration enough - this is THE place to go for breakfast/brunch! Hubby and I have a pretty discerning pallet and high expectations. No complaints - we're counting it all joy! 

We both got skillets: I got the Avocado skillet and hubs got the Yoga Pants skillet. His skillet pan was empty before I had a chance to look up from my own plate! Definitely a must-do if you're ever in Vegas. I've added Mto to my travel gems list!"}
{"text":"This was our first stop after landing in Vegas. We meant to go to the original MTO but ended up here instead thanks to our GPS. My friend and I both ordered the Chicken in a Waffle. My chicken was slightly over-cooked and dry, which was disappointing considering we were the only table waiting for food at the time. Other than that, the service was great and the facilities were very clean. I would come here again, but I wouldn't order the fried chicken again."}
{"text":"I'm not entirely sure why this place has such good reviews. My girlfriend and I went here and ordered the seasonal berry waffles and the chicken and waffles. These were the blandest waffles I've ever had. The berries were fresh and the vanilla whip cream wasn't overly sweet which was a good thing. The chicken was cooked nicely but the gravy once again was entirely too bland. Why? If I'm paying 35$ for two orders of waffles they better be good. But what do you expect in downtown Summerlin I suppose. My next complaint is the staff. Between the 3 cashiers that all look as if they hate their job to the busser that sags his pants I'm not sure where to go from here. They have 8-9 staff members working for four tables, I'm also not sure how this business model is working for them but if they continue I'm sure they won't be in business for much longer. At least I hope not considering I don't want other people to also get ripped off. To the owner: Reevaluate."}
{"text":"Vegas is a tough place for vegetarians. It's a city that equates meat with success. So I did some research before we went, and chose this place for a nice brunch on my wife's birthday. We were both pleasantly surprised.

We were welcomed warmly by the staff and by a woman who I'm assuming was the manager or owner. When I mentioned that I'd found the place on Yelp, and that it was my wife's birthday, we were offered a complimentary amuse bouche - two tiny walnut tarts.

My wife had the Skuna Bay salmon skillet, and I had the vegan carrot and coconut pancakes. Even though we didn't need them - hers came with home fries, and my meal was already pretty carb-laden - we also ordered a side of these potatoes that melded the best of hash browns and mashed in one dish. Decadent, and necessary.

We also ordered bloody marys, made with Soju, a Korean liquor that's lighter than vodka, so we didn't need a nap when we were done.

Everything arrived quickly, and was consumed with gusto. The food was fresh, inventive and delicious, and the service was attentive without being overbearing. The room has a nice, warm ambiance with plenty of natural light. 

Best of all, the place takes its job seriously, but also knows how to have fun. Social media is embedded in the experience, and the tables even offer USB plugs on the wall to recharge your devices.

The short walk to Fremont Street  burned off a few calories. We'll be back for more,"}
{"text":"I have been to MTO on several occasions and I can honestly so it is a hit and miss. Sometimes the food is good and sometimes it is just ok. 
I have read a lot about how good MTO's lemon poppy seed pancakes are and I will say they did not live up to their hype. I could not taste any lemon. They just tasted like plain pancakes (like boring ones without buttermilk) with poppy seeds sprinkled in the batter. The blueberry syrup was good but I could hardly taste the ginger. The pancakes were also really chewy to the point where I could not cut them with the side of my fork and had a difficult time cutting it with the butter knife they gave me. I would not order these again. 
My husband had the spicy chicken sandwich and he liked it this time. We have gotten it before and it had little to no flavor (hmm shocker there!). From my experience, the sandwiches are usually good here. 
The staff is always friendly. The greet you promptly as you enter the restaurant and are quick to answer any questions and offer suggestions. But be warned, this is not a quick service restaurant though it may look like one. It does take a while to get your food because everything seems to be made to order.
Overall, MTO is a hit or miss restaurant. Don't expect the same quality or flavor everytime you come back. It is a good restaurant to come to if you and your party can't decide on a breakfast or lunch place and happen to be in the area."}
{"text":"Wow- what a great surprise . How long has this been here and I didn't know about it. The chicken egg skillet with arugula was the bomb diggity. Perfect size , great taste. My wife had the broccoli wrap and she says it was yummy and they did not skimp on the broccoli . We will be back very soon. It's one of these meals you continually  think about until you return and have it again. Nice staff too"}
{"text":"Great food. I love the innovative decor, menu and ideas - like etch a sketch kids menus and electric delivery bikes."}
{"text":"Awesome food and great customer service. our waitress was the bomb.com. Have to try the avocado omelette skillet WOW!"}
{"text":"This is our first visit to MTO Cafe and it will not be our last ! Our food was amazing ! My fiancé and I both ordered the Chicken in a Waffle and our daughter had the french toast and it was amazing ! The servings were huge ! Ryan was so cool , he was prompt and helped us navigate through the menu . Our food made it to the table about 10mins after ordering ! We'll definitely be regular customers from here on out ."}
{"text":"We had excellent service (our server Emely was awesome) and the food was very tasty; latte was perfect as well."}
{"text":"One of my top spots in Vegas for breakfast. Organic ingredients, friendly servers, away from the strip.. everything I like. I had the Chicken in a Waffle.. I wasn't expecting it to really be waffle sandwich with chicken. That was pretty amazing. 

The price was about $13 which is pretty standard for breakfast. The coffee came in a pretty big cup but the vegetable juice was kind of small.

I received the free walnut tossie with Yelp Check in which was delicious.

The only gripe I had with this place is that parking isn't free and you have to pay $3 but otherwise, definitely love this place. I usually stay in Downtown Las Vegas so this place is super close by."}
{"text":"Awesome food! A little awkward location but super easy to find. Loved their bloody Mary's and the scramble was amazing. Great food to soak up the alcohol from the night before!"}
{"text":"Great little place to grab a quick bite! Very fresh and customer service is great!!  Prices a little steep for  portions, definitely would be back.."}
{"text":"My pick up order was about a half hour late, and once I got back to work I realized it was incorrect (hangover burger missing the egg) and it still deserves all these stars. The food is fantastic and you can bet I still devoured that burger. The chocolate chip cookies are the perfect texture between crisp and chewy, the macaroni and cheese will change your life, and the juices they come up with are awesome. I've been there for a watermelon limeade concoction (my favorite so far) and they gave me a freebie on their pineapple mint today while I waited. Staff was apologetic and friendly and they always do their best to make it better when you're held up. It's a great place to just hang out. Be careful around the lunch rush if you're short on time, though."}
{"text":"Food\"s so fresh and fabulous! Great casual place to eat with the friendliest staff! Kelly is awesome! Coming back with my dog next time!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Was there for a girls weekend and we wanted go hungover food. There mto breakfast is worth the money and the portion is a great size l. Th serves was great."}
{"text":"Delicious food, great service! Highly recommend! Worth the walk from Fremont for sure"}
{"text":"Comfort food, especially good in the am when you are hungover!

Came here with some friends on a saturday am after a LOOOONG night out to grab some comfort food to make up for the lack of sleep. Ordered the chicken waffle and pancakes to share. Both were nicely presented and was very tasty. I especially liked the freshly pressed antioxidant juices that we got, so yummy! We got each one of the red and green, highly recommend those. 

The food is not very healthy especially the breakfast items, but they sure do absorb the excessive alcohol you put in your body the night before. Parking is validated in the parking structure behind the restaurant, or if you can find street meter parking. Bathrooms are clean. Service is decent."}
{"text":"Have to preface the review with saying that I was on vacation. Sometimes this makes you think a place was better than it really was...or maybe vice versa.

That said, this place definitely toppled me. I went in with a couple friends and my girlfriend after a rough Friday night. 15 dollar bottomless mimosas (which the server refilled, even after we overstayed our welcome...) and something they call \"mash browns\" which seem to be hash browns on a bed of mashed potatoes. Both crunchy and creamy (a combination I rarely enjoy) this unique side dish is what I remembered most about MTO. 

The decorations are cool, it's definitely a \"hip\" type of bar/brunch place. You're bound to overhear some goatee'd gladhander talk about his worthless sales job, or the blonde bombshell reminiscing about the night she can't remember. Comes with the territory. 

Would definitely, definitely eat here again. And drink. And talk. And eat again.

I should mention they gave us free cookies too. Who does that?"}
{"text":"A nice place great clam ..chowder. ..thank giving they were open until 230p I called 5 times between 12pm to 220pm no answer and went into voice mail 5 times.annoyingly and  un professional ..I had a few meals there always good .I was aware.. that managers seat to much and they are not on top of the services.they dont come aroud to the tables to talk to the Patrons .people need to feel well come 5  stars for the food ..4 for the food server 0 for the managers"}
{"text":"I prefer their other location but still delicious healthy food. I have never had something I didn't like here. I enjoy the honey walnut sandwich but my sisters breakfast plate was also delicious! Nice area to walk around after and have some ice cream and shop. This was a side of Vegas I had not explored previously and I enjoyed how local it felt."}
{"text":"The food was really tasty. I had a little skillet fulla brekkie with a little potato. The coffee, which in Vegas often isn't,  was strong and delicious. Big bonus: no tourists."}
{"text":"Fried apple dessert is amazing!! Love the free Wi-Fi and power outlets in every booth & parking is convenient :)

I will def be back to try out the vegan carrot pancakes!"}
{"text":"I want to so badly give this place 4 stars! 

I've been to this place a few times and every time I usually try something new. Each item Ive tried has always been tasty to say the least. 

However, since I live so close to MTO Cafe, I usually end up placing an order for delivery to get my fix. Prompt this delivery service it is, there is always something forgotten in the order i.e. Green drink, salad along with the chicken and waffles, a side mashbrowns, the list goes on. 


Nevertheless, it's always a very tasty, somewhat healthy, way to remedy my hangover, or simply stay home on the weekends for brunch. The second location just opened at the new summerlin mall, I will likely check out this location as well."}
{"text":"Love the vibe! This cafe is one of my favorite, and having City Hall right across the street makes it even better. Support local? Support this cafe! Very nice and hip decor."}
{"text":"Great food, cute little place. My husband loved the turkey melt and the mash browns were excellent. The staff was also very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Food is great but the service is amazing from the moment you get on the door a welcoming hello and smiling faces!!!"}
{"text":"Thanks Ashley, Ben, Mike and all the kitchen stuff for making my daughters graduation brunch amazing!!!"}
{"text":"I appreciate the idea and the flavor of the falafel wrap but the texture was horrible.  A falafel should have some crunch and bite to it.  The falafel here was mushy and unappealing, had the same consistency of an over ripe banana.  The flavor of the wrap aside from the falafel was good though.  And the salad although extremely simple was good with the balsamic dressing.  I'll go back and try something else as I like the freshness and the healthiness of the options but I won't be getting the falafel wrap again."}
{"text":"A small authentic place for locals located near downtown Las Vegas. 
The mimosas were a bit watered down, but their sizzling egg plates are worth the wait! 
The burgers are great, but the fries were stale and not worth it. 
Their hidden surprise, their lattes, tasted fantastic and not bitter! 
Definitely worth the drive off the strip to try!"}
{"text":"Great food! I ordered for my whole crew and the 15 were satisfied with their food! Glad you guys deliver to the convention center"}
{"text":"I love love love MTO!! The food is amazing and the atmosphere is delightful. The only complaint I have ever had is the lag on getting beverages and check backs. You have to pay for parking but they validate for half so it's like 75 cents. Totally worth it!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and friendly staff! Prices r reasonable and they even give a free cookie if u check in! Can't wait to come back and try more!"}
{"text":"MTO does it again. I've never had a wait at this place, and this Monday around noon was no different. I was greeted, seated and served very quickly by the very cute downtown hipsterish looking staff.

Ordered the Chicken in a Waffle, which was bomb. I need the recipe to that waffle batter because it was just that good...And I'm from Atlanta where Waffle House is very much a thing, so there's that. Chicken was nice, but wasn't too crazy about the gravy they had on the side. No biggie. Opted for mashbrowns instead of fries, which I think was a good choice.

Kinda pricey for breakfast food, but it was all yum, so no complaints here, especially since I snagged a $5 off Restaurants.com coupon for this trip. I'll be back, MTO!"}
{"text":"Simply...the attention to service was outstanding... GREAT cup of Joe...
The reasoning behind this rating is that the breakfast was just not memorable.... veggie omelette was well... well done, browned on outside.. next was a skillet dish...omelette w/ bacon / Swiss served on top of hash potatoes... forgettable... Because of the service I'd give it another try... free cookie was hard as a rock..."}
{"text":"Thank you to Yelp for helping us find this place.  It's not the sort of location a tourist would normally stumble on (across from City Hall) but it's well worth the short drive from Downtown to check it out.

*  Easy parking and they validate
*  Very attractive decor
*  Food is terrific and portions are large.
*  Phone charger receptacles at every booth are very convenient
*  The place was full and service was still excellent
*  Unusual menu selections are fun - and well prepared

Recommended!"}
{"text":"Overpriced for fast causal mediocre food. Maybe I bought the wrong thing (MTO breakfast) but it was pretty basic eggs, potatoes, some protein. Very bland, under-seasoned.  $14 add a drink so about $20 after all said and done. That's not worth it IMO. At least the interior design and location is nice w/ Indoor and outdoor seating. Which is why it earns 3 stars instead of 2. TBH I'd rather go elsewhere than support their high overhead costs. I haven't been back their since. If a place wants to charge $14 I want full service and the food needs to not be bland."}
{"text":"I was hesitant at first to come down just because I didn't want to deal with the parking situation down time. The parking garage was a plus, it was only $3 when we went, and the waitress did validate it for $1.50 off, another bonus. 

We had a group of 5, one being vegan, and she found plenty of items to order. I ended up splitting the Fat Elvis and the Fried Chicken & Waffles, I wasn't really into the Fat Elvis, but the Chicken & Waffles were fantastic, not the best I've had, but they were tasty. We also tried the donuts and fried apple rings. Both were good, not something I would order again.  There were a few other menu items I'd like to come back and try, the Quinoa Burger looks great. I'll be back when I find myself in need of a breakfast spot downtown, this is way better than eat."}
{"text":"Came for lunch at the MTO Café on a Monday afternoon (MLK day) and it was extremely busy.  That was okay with me because you counter order, then get a number so your food can be brought to you.  The long line gave me a chance to peruse the paper menu before I could read the menu board at the counter.  They have both indoor and outdoor seating, but the outside tables were in the shade at that time, so I was glad a table opened up inside when we were ready to sit down.

It was a nice day, but a little chilly walking around Downtown Summerlin, so it felt like a soup and sandwich day to us.  When we got to the counter, we were told that, while the menu includes both cup and bowls of soup, they did not have cups available.  Okay...so we ordered bowls.  This was definitely not a cheap lunch.  2 orders of soup, sandwiches, and sodas was $50.  

I ordered the tomato basil soup, which was hot, rich, and hearty.  It says it comes with \"cheddar toast\", which I assumed was like a crustini, but it was actually a sliver of regular grilled cheese...and it was really good.  The soup and \"toast\" was a meal, I didn't need anything else.  But on to my sandwich.  I ordered the Grilled Cheese.  Unlike the kind that came with my soup, this one consisted of brie, honey, & toasted walnuts on brioche.  I was trying something outside the box for me, but I'm not sure why I thought I would like this.  I really think this sandwich will appeal to a lot of people, but it's just not for me.  However, the side salad that came with the sandwich was Amazing.  Baby greens, roasted peppers, a fantastic balsamic.  Yum. 

The BF ordered the calm chowder and he said it was one of the best he's had in Vegas.  Both for flavor and the mass amount of actual clams in the dish.  This chowder was enough for a meal, but he has also ordered the Hero sandwich.  It has grilled chicken, prosciutto, salami, and a mix that looked just like my salad.  He took most of it home, but said it was terrific.

All in all, we enjoyed the fresh space, the food, the Freestyle Coke machine, and we will be back sometime when we take the 40 mile journey to Downtown Summerlin."}
{"text":"Ordered the vegan pancakes, and although I was turned off at first at the thought of having carrots and coconut on my pancakes, they turned out to be amazing!!"}
{"text":"Delish food.... staff is super nice. I got the BLTAE... messiest most delish blt I've ever gotten."}
{"text":"They have amazing food, great service, and a great atmosphere that's what keeps me coming back. Recommend the turkey melt!"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful if you need breakfast or brunch AWAY from the strip. Had the steak and eggs which was bomb.com 

Loved the decor. Very original. The huge windows flood natural light into the place which is a plus. Staff was wonderful! Will be going back."}
{"text":"My son's grilled cheese was obscenely greasy, my turkey burger was fine but had none of the pickled jalapeno the menu said was included. Both of our fries were cold. The cashier was rude, rushed and asked 3 times if the \"go go squeeze\" on my son's stroller tray was from their restaurant. Sorry honey, but I have better things to do than steal an applesauce from your mediocre restaurant. The breakfasts looked huge and delish - maybe if we had chosen different food, I would be happier with my experience. But between the overpriced lunch, the rude cashier and the greasy grilled cheese, I'll probably pass on MTO next time. =("}
{"text":"I have 12 check ins here. I want to like MTO so badly, but I am done. No wifi for guests, no Verizon signal in the restaurant. No decaf coffee. Staff doesn't care.  Lots of other options for great food in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Food was ok. Nothing to rave about. Price was on the high side. Don't plan on coming back."}
{"text":"Their breakfast is very ordinary. Everything is bland!!! Nothing special. The green juice was great though! I also enjoyed the fried apple rings even though the dough was not fully cooked inside! Don't think I will ever go back!"}
{"text":"This is a place a would go back to to try other things... So that's saying a lot! The wait was 5 minutes for the tall tables w bar stools... Our server was friendly and her timing was good. I ordered the grilled cheese. It had honey, brie, toasted walnuts and brioche between two thick slices of butter crisped bread. It came w a side of simple salt and pepper greens w a side of vinaigrette. I enjoyed this a lot. It was just a tad too sweet but quite delicious. My husband had the chicken and waffles w fries which he inhaled so I'm assuming he really liked it. And my niece ordered the chorizo omelette. That was super tasty. Chorizo, roasted tomatoes and piquollo peppers were folded in super fluffy eggs. This was topped w avo...my fave. Also, they validated parking for $1.50. Our parking total was $3 but we did take a 5 minute stroll to Fremont street to play in the golden nugget for a quick second"}
{"text":"Great new restaurant that brings an upbeat and invigorating environment. The decor is hip and trendy. The orange is a bright attention grabbing color. Started with the green juice which had a combination of good flavors, but a very strong presence of celery and lemon dominated the drink. Those flavors should be dulled down a bit to create a balanced and enjoyable drink. For breakfast I had the Kentucky Fried Chicken and the bacon pancake dippers. The KFC was awesome with a great tasting flavor combination that readily complimented each component. The gravy was my favorite part. Will get an extra side order of gravy next time. The bacon pancake dippers are good, but my expectations were overinflated. The lack of flavor was disappointing. Added flavors like lemon, orange, chocolate, blueberries, and red velvet would drastically improve this dish. The peppercorn syrup only tasted like syrup. Ended the breakfast with the complimentary warm gooey chocolate chip cookie provide for free with the check in on Yelp. So delicious! Great friendly and helpful customer service was provided."}
{"text":"Great place to grab breakfast or lunch. Never had a bad meal or  bad service. The soda machine seems to ALWAYS be out of something. Yesterday it was root beer and Dr. Pepper."}
{"text":"Free chocolate chip cookie with check-in!!
The cookie made my top 10 cookie list and the KFC was very good. Basically a Chicken Fried Chicken with gravy"}
{"text":"pretty good food, unpleasant service

my group was seated and ordered, no issues. when our waitress brought out the food, she gave me the wrong order (California sandwich). When I politely asked if I could get my original order, she checked her sheet and and found that she had written California and apologized for the mistake. She initially offered to see if she could get me my correct order, which I accepted. She didn't come back to my table until I flagged her down again, at which point I asked if I would be getting my original order. She responded by asking \"Are you really not okay with the California?\" -- extremely off-putting. She left and the manager came over to ask what was wrong, and he was also extremely resistant to placing my original order, with many disappointed looks and heavy sighs.

I did get my original order fairly promptly once they actually agreed to place it, and the food was decent."}
{"text":"Derek was our server seriously over the top with great service! Not once did we have to look for him to refill my drink (bottomless mimosas) nor anything else  AMAZING server! EXCELLENT SERVICE along with so flavorful food!!! Definitely will return!"}
{"text":"Great food and awesome service! Truly comfort food for a low price. Must go if visiting downtown Vegas and want a great brunch/breakfast/lunch spot."}
{"text":"We enjoyed this place very much.  Nice atmosphere, great service, and great food.  It was not crowded either, which is a plus when visiting Vegas.  Also wanted to give a shout out to Rachel, our waitress! She was awesome.  Very personable, friendly, and it's obvious she enjoys her job.  Thank you for the great experience! We will definitely be coming back when visiting Vegas again."}

Food was good but we found the same quality for half the price at other nearby places."}
{"text":"I am so happy to have MTO Café open in Downtown Summerlin.  It's a welcome addition to the neighborhood.  I stopped for lunch yesterday after some shopping and I'm glad to report it's as good as I had expected.

I was greeted by the staff at the counter in a very friendly manner.  I was studying the large menu board above and two of the staff pointed to some smaller paper menus at the register.  I brought one of those home with me.  I selected the \"Philly\" their take on the classic sandwich.  You're given a number to put on your table.

The menu describes it this way.  \"Skirt steak, Velveeta, red wine drunken onions.\"  The sandwich comes with fries.  I ordered a Coke and I was given a cup for use at their Coca-Cola Freestyle machine.  Silverware (real metal--not plastic) is available at the end of the counter by the registers and there are napkins, straws, and drink container opts there, too.

I selected a table by the east windows that overlooks the Dining Arroyo.  There's a patio there with heaters and some people were sitting out enjoying their lunches.  In a short time, my lunch was brought.  The Philly is on a hamburger style bun instead of the traditional sub-like roll and there was a good amount of fries with the Philly.  

The small cubes of steak with the cheese and onions were excellent!  The fries were hot and very good.  

After finishing while I was just answering some emails, a staff member came by and asked if she could remove the plate.  That gave me some work room on the table.  There is free wi-fi.

I can't wait to go back and try some more things on the menu.  Welcome to the neighborhaood, MTO!"}
{"text":"Generally closing at 3 PM on weekends, MTO has a program called Sunday Supper Series at MTO.  While planned to be done monthly, it's about once a quarter.  On April 19, 2015, I attended my first supper entitled Korean Brasserie. 

This dinner consisted of 6 courses done by different chefs.  The first, the amuse, was by Eduardo Saavedra of MTO Café.  It was two fried California gold oysters with seaweed kimchi and Asian pear mignonette.  

The second course, salad, was by Daniel Ontiveros of the closed Comme Ça.  It was Gochujang pig ear terrine and white kimchi salad, pickled daikon, and cilantro.

Course three, soup, was by Johnny Church of MTO.  was seared abalnoe mushroom hot pot with \"mirepoux.\"

Course 4, appetizer, was by Brian Howard, Chef/Owner of Grazing Pig Food Group, and consisted of heritage pork tartare tenders and heart, soju pickled bae, and Carolin rice craklin.

Course 5, by Brian Lhee, Executive Chef of Yusho Las Vegas, was Korean hsort rib with tofu cavatelli, sesame leaves, and crispy anchovies.

Dessert, Course 6, was by Ashley Traeger and Meilani Marriott of Hapa Sweeters (coming soon to Las Vegas).  The did two small desserts--Spring green tea mini tart and a matcha green tea panna cotta.

After the meal, the chefs were introduced and each one spoke briefly.

I had a seat at the counter facing the espresso machine and it was perfect.  I got to watch the construction of the dishes and it was great fun watching them do their thing.  

Service was excellent, the food was great, and it was a fine evening of supper of a different kind.   Prix fixe is $65 and a reservation is a must.

I look forward to the next Sunday Supper at MTO."}
{"text":"Food was really good. Some of the best pancakes I have ever tasted. I never would have thought about carrots and coconuts in pancakes, but they were great. The blueberry pancakes were even better. Overall the service was good, but they were busy and when we came with a party of 12 it over welled the small kitchen. Everyone enjoyed everything that they ate accept the waffles. Stay away from the waffles and you will be happy."}
{"text":"I couldn't be more happy with the food, atmosphere, and service of this place. We decided to try this place out before going to the Smith Center for a shoe. We had the Hero which was full of flavor and packed with protein. Grilled Cheese had Brie with honey and walnut sauce which was my absolute favorite definitely something I will be getting next time! We also had the New England Clam Chowder which was a bit too thick, but still jam packed with flavor, it would be wonderful for a cold day.  
Our servicer Steve was very nice, refilled our glasses when needed, and was professional.  The GM Micheal came to our table and asked us how our food was, we started to converse with us.  He was very nice, and personable!  I will come back and visit the Summerlin location as well. You can not go wrong with this little diamond in the rough."}
{"text":"Yummy! Ordered the Vegan Carrot pancakes. 
Arrived in front of me were 3 large, thick, fluffy, perfectly moist and heavenly pancakes sprinkled with crunchy coconut, pecans, grated carrots and agave. I could barely eat 1 pancake the serving was so huge. My partner got the chicken & waffles which came with gravy and fries. I loved the crispy crunchy coating on the fried chicken! Very tasty. The Green vegetable juice also pleased me. 

The place is modern, simple but cheery atmosphere. Reasonable pricing. Good service. Wholesome and fresh food."}
{"text":"Found this place after we missed the casino breakfast. Breakfast was great. Fresh and tasty...blows Dennys away! Steak and eggs and veggie eggs were amazing! Now we know where to go! Casual yet upscale decor...friendly staff, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Staff is awesome! Food is also great I did the chicken and waffles! Delicious! they have power at every table with Wi-Fi! Excellent place to get away from an office and get some work done and also enjoy a great meal"}
{"text":"Great spot to eat at....was recommended this spot so decided to try it out.  I'll tell u I wasn't disappointed at all and my server Ryan was friendly and vey helpful.  This is like Vegas best kept secret."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the French Onion soup I've ever had!.... Ruben was less to be desired...Bread to meat ratio is very bad"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in my $14 hamburger that I waited 30m for. Staff seems put out. Food was average. Tables outside weren't cleaned promptly so birds were flocking. Won't be back."}
{"text":"The best hangover burger I've ever had!!! And the apple rings were pretty amazing too. I highly recommend this place. The service alone was worth the stop. From now on, every time I go to Vegas, I'll come and eat here. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this spot after cruising around DTLV and visit here was beyond my expectation! 

Something to note: There are some street parking around or a City Hall parking garage behind the cafe which is $2.25. Fortunately you can get a validation here, which is $1.50 off the charge meaning you are still left to pay 75 cents....why

Back to the business, entrance was inviting with friendly staffs greeting us. Place was hip and trendy with lots of seating. 

I was craving burger so opted for their black and bleu burger which comes with fries on the side. Asked for medium but was more on the well done side. I still enjoyed it's thick and juicy patty. 5/5

I also got to try their Kentucky fried chicken which came with two eggs and a hash. Hash was nice and crisp, fried chicken was seasoned well and eggs were cooked to our preference. 5/5

Friendly staffs, amazing home cooking kind of breakfast and great vibe deserves 5 stars despite its parking situation. I will be back."}
{"text":"Great place downtown. Pancakes were very good and my wife had the eggwhite veggie acrambled and enjoyed it. Service is very friendly and it has a nice atmosphere. We'll be back."}
{"text":"We've been in twice now for lunch. This place is nice! It's got a neat patio and we've had nice service on both occasions. 

The food is very good. The Mac and cheese stood out and we were pleased with our salads. We had one complaint on our last visit and were told the item was changing so it was in transition. I hope they continue to evolve! 

I would certainly go back for a casual and tasty lunch al fresco."}
{"text":"This should have been covered in business 101 but when your recording says you're open till 9 stay open till 9! Drove down arrived at 8:25 to find out you close at 8 ... Won't be back"}
{"text":"I've been here twice already and have enjoyed both my meals very much! I've had the hen house wrap and it tasted very fresh, loved it. Today I tried the Chicken in a waffle, asked for it without the gravy and it was so delicious! I ate it so quickly!  The only reason I say a 4 rather than a 5 is because it's more on the pricey side, but it's reasonable =)"}
{"text":"I have had MTO bookmarked forever and today I finally got to try it. It is very inviting and a very cute place for breakfast and lunch.  We were seated within 5 minutes and our drink orders were taken quickly. Our server seemed personable and was prompt in taking our orders.  It was probably about 20 min before our food arrived- 2 Black & Bleu burgers. They were good and were accompanied by skinny fries which were good but nothing special. The Ranch dressing I asked for on the side was totally blah though.  It may have been made on the premises but again, nothing special.   Our server never came by to refill our iced tea or to check on us. I wanted to order the Apple rings and  it was about 20-25 minutes before she came back to us. I ordered the rings. She had said they typically take about 5 minutes to make - 15 minutes later, they arrived. The apple rings were yummy! Definitely the high point of meal.  Most likely we would never come back- not because the food was bad or the service horrible but there was nothing spectacular about the meal and it just took too long for a work day lunch."}
{"text":"This has been my go to  burger spot whenever I'm on the summerlin side of town. The burgers are juicy, flavorful, and I'm never disappointed. It always feels like you are given a never ending amount of fries(which is awesome!) The cashier people are always nice and ready to get your order.  4/5 because there have been times where the fries felt hard like rocks."}
{"text":"Great service. Their bottomless mimosas are great and not too expensive. Food was excellent and not too expensive either. Their chicken and waffles is really good. Would definitely recommend to someone who loves brunch."}
{"text":"Love the food and staff here! Had the patty melt and it was cooked perfectly. Definitely a top 10 on my lunch list. Quick service and quick cooking! Definitely stop by on your next lunch break."}
{"text":"Great little place across City Hall. The ambiance was nice, LOTS of natural light.

The food was great. The menu was different than other brunch places which I liked; it gave an incentive to come back and try something else... like the carrot/coconut pancakes. The staff was genuinely friendly and inviting. 

I had the Hangover Burger and it was fantastic! I wasn't hungover, but if I was... oh my LORD! You know that scene in 2001: A Space Odyssey where it's a close-up of an eye and it changes into all sorts of colors and then the camera is sifting through space passing all these laser beams at an incredible rate?? Well that's what I would imagine eating one of those babies would feel like... just utter bliss. It comes with string fries which I'm not a fan of whatsoever. I'll have to ask if they have wedges or some other sort of side. 
 
The only blip in the experience was the chocolate chip cookie. It was the hard crunchy type but in the pics they looked chewy... guess which one I prefer? Lol. 
BUT, they do validate parking so, meh. 

I'll definitely return, and I'll definitely recommend this place friends."}
{"text":"MTO is a local establishment that specializes in breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  What do you know?  That's also my top 3 favorite times to eat.  Their motto is simple...fresh comfort food. Their known for their Hangover Burger (its okay), the Kentucky Fried Chicken (Yum), and their Chicken Pot Pie (never tried).  I recommend the MTO Breakfast for $14.99 if you're undecided.  It's my favorite and includes 3 eggs, chicken sausage, turkey bacon, real bacon (the good stuff), spam, potatoes, and your choice of bread.  When I get bored with this meal, I'll substitute the whole eggs with egg whites or pancakes instead of bread.  They can do that here because the food is MTO aka \"made to order\".  The rest of the items on their menu is good too, except the steak.  The best deal at MTO has to be their free cookie if you Check-In to Yelp. MTO is a safe bet whenever I'm hungry, craving eggs, and in Downtown Summerlin.  

2017 Yelp Review #58"}
{"text":"What has taken me so long to check MTO out? Better late, than never.  

MTO is clean, located near downtown, has a decent breakfast/brunch selection, and the cost is just about right.  

What's on their menu? 
-Wraps, Omelets, Skillets
-Pancakes and Waffles
-Sandwiches and Burgers
-Salads and Veggies
-Desserts and Treats

I ended up playing it safe and got the MTO Breakfast for $14.00.  This came with 3 eggs, bacon, turkey bacon, chicken sausage, spam, mash browns, and your choice of bread.  I got mine with egg whites (additional $3 charge) and wheat.  So what's the verdict?  I got a satisfying, hearty breakfast, and at a great price.  Yes...you get a lot.  The egg whites were just your average fluffy egg whites, but everything else was well prepared and delicious.  I love their mash browns, which is a mix of mash potatoes and hash browns.  If you're a fan of both, then you'll love this hybrid. MTO's motto is \"fresh comfort food\".  Definitely fresh, definitely comfort food. There's so much that I still need to try and I can't wait for next time.  What's my plan?  Maybe a burger? Maybe their Chicken & Waffles?  Maybe a skillet? I guess I have to come back at least 2 more times to get my food on.  Peace Out!!"}
{"text":"I love the ambiance of this cafe. The owner's dad was making his rounds and was very friendly. The servers and the hostess were also very considerate. The food and drinks were amazing. I ordered the green juice and my husband ordered the red juice. I had a skillet and I was completely full. Great portions for a great price! I didn't stop there, I tried both of the fried donuts. The fried apple donut is amazing!!!! Can't recommend it enough. You might have to fight someone for the last one. I know it hasn't been open long, I hope they continue keeping up the good work. Great service and real food are appreciated."}
{"text":"Wow, this place has some impressive craftsmanship in the food.  The flavors of the Hangover burger are perfectly executed, the medium request on burger patty was dead on, and its actually seasoned!  

Great fries as well.  The BLT was excellent, but get plenty of napkins.  The bacon thick and tasty, not burned but properly cooked. 

It will be interesting to see if they can maintain this high level of food, but I will for sure be back frequently to see for myself. 

Great staff, super clean, quick service.  Solid 5 stars."}
{"text":"I had the salmon skillet and my daughter had the turkey melt. We both finished every single bit of food! We shared one of the lemon poppy seed pancakes, and we loved it too. The atmosphere is relaxed. It somehow made me feel like part of a community - maybe due to the table layout, but I enjoyed that because that's not something I ever feel in a restaurant. This'll be a new hangout of mine for sure."}
{"text":"Their food is amazing !!!!! I got the French toast & my boyfriend got the Kentucky fried chicken. Both were so good. This might be our new fave breakfast spot now :) & the atmosphere is so mellow & calm & the staff seemed pretty nice & we didn't have to wait too long for our food , we are here on a Sunday & it's not even packed which is more than perfect !"}
{"text":"I have now been twice in the last week.  Once for breakfast and once for brunch.  I LOVE THIS PLACE!   Easy to find, easy parking, unique and delicious food options  (Avocado Omelet was awesome and the fried apple ring concoction is not to be missed....tastes like fried beignet dough over an apple ring!), cute space.  Great coffee and also great big coffee cup (which is important).  All employees were grateful for my business and I felt very welcome.  They even have a limited liquor license for I think beer and wine, which can add to the ambiance when you are deciding on a brunch spot.   I definitely will be back and I love this addition to the emerging downtown scene."}
{"text":"This place is great. Amazing food! Atmosphere very nice and clean. Donna the manager is super sweet and attentive.  Our server  Cho was amazing too. Definitely visit MTO when in Vegas! Close to Downtown Freemont st experience."}
{"text":"Food was really good. MTO breakfast sampler with turkey bacon, spam, sausage etc. Staff was very nice and attentive. Definitely a great place for breakfast."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast and lunch! The food was really delicious. There are options for vegetarians and vegans too! The portions are HUGE and inexpensive!"}
{"text":"A Breath of fresh air on this end of the strip, friendly staff, good food, super healthy portion sizes. Juices are where it's at! Had the chicken fried steak and the wife had the BLTAE, both were spectacular! Will come back next time we are here in LV, thx again MTO!"}
{"text":"This is a surprisingly nice spot considering it is in a parking garage! It is just one of the oddest little places I know of, and it is pretty cool. The food is good, albeit a little high priced, but I think it is worth it. I have to say that the hangover burger was a tasty awesome mess of happy. Fried egg cooked just right with avocado on a perfectly spiced burger, just rocks. 

The atmosphere is very modern and trendy, designed extremely well. They have a bar that usually has spots open to muscle up and order. The staff is also modern and trendy, and have good service. 

My favorite thing is the coffee, it is really good and the cups are big. The price is not jacked up, either. With the price of the food where it is (lunch average $15-$20), you would expect $5+, but it's not, it's just a few bucks and they keep it coming.

I will keep coming back for sure. My love for downtown Vegas continues to grow because I am surprised with something new on a regular basis, MTO is one of the reasons for it."}
{"text":"I really like this place. This location is much better than the one in Summerlin. I've been here 3 times on a weekend morning. I've always had omelettes and they've been consistently flavorful, fresh and unique. Coffee is good, as is the service. It's a little pricy without sides like potatoes or toast, but  I've never left hungry."}
{"text":"I had their bodybuilder plate which was very good. It bought chicken sausage, 6 egg whites, spinach, and roasted peppers. I couldn't have asked for a better platter. I very much enjoyed It. This place is excellent for breakfast.."}
{"text":"This is a jewel in the desert. Unique menu, great prices. Our server Allyson, was amazing. The friendliest person we met in town. It was so good, we ate there every morning. 
It's worth the short walk  \"off the beaten path\"."}
{"text":"The poor review is for the employees not the food.
I have been here for breakfast and it was fantastic. The food was very thought out and had some great flavors. They also have mimosas if you decide to do brunch with friends. I ordered a couple of entrees with friends for breakfast and they were all great. On a separate occasion, I ordered the chicken sandwich for lunch. The sandwich is what hooked me! It is so simple but oh so good.

Like I said, the food is excellent but if you decide to order takeout, there is a very big chance you will never get your order, or if you get it, it will be incorrect.  If the staff just took the time to double check the order it would have been a 5 star review from me. Customer service is what brings people back to an establishment. This is Las Vegas, there is great food everywhere."}
{"text":"It's. 3.5 star place.  You can call it a one time try kinda spot for me.  The food is good,  but it's not a place for someone wanting a \"regular\" breakfast.  This place is very hipster type of setup.  The server we had was decent, but not as interactive and outgoing as some places I've enjoyed a five star experience in Vegas. (See my other review).   The check in offer for a free cookie is cool... But it doesn't make up for the lack of juice choices, not to mention the tiny glass of orange juice I got charged $3 for.  Oh, and that juice... Doesn't come with free refills.  So yeah.  Like I said,  a one time try."}
{"text":"MTO Cafe is a sight for sore downtown eyes. Anything original that falls outside the orbit of Freemont east and The Downtown Project is to be hailed out of the gate, and the good news is that MTO offers a fun menu, an inviting space, and cheerful service. Bonus points for mobile charging stations in the booths, a bottomless mimosa brunch, local delivery, special event suppers, vegan options, etch-a-sketches for kids, and a kitchen that likes to mix things up. These cats are hitting many right notes, and I'm happy to keep returning and supporting. 

But there's a \"but.\" It's small \"but\" but it's crucial and can be summed up with the following moral principle (which I think comes from Psalms, and say it with me): A Tomato is a Privilege, Not a Right. MTO touts itself as the place to get \"fresh comfort food.\"  It's a solid concept. People love diner fare like skillets and pancakes. People also love the idea of garden fresh ingredients. MTO has both! Together! Fried potatoes and eggs WITH ARUGULA! Pancakes WITH FRESH BERRIES! Montague, meet Capulet.  

But then the plates arrive, several times in a row now, and there they are. Three desperate slices of roma tomato that have no earthly reason for existing. Three pale pink, dry, mealy, insipid round disks that make a mockery of the whole \"fresh ingredients\" concept. It's a larger and more generally disturbing societal trend, this habituated tastelessness, but it's particularly glaring at a place that hangs its hat on the notion of seasonality. A tomato, say it with me once again, is a privilege. It grows for a few months in the summer, arrives in our kitchens bursting with the juice of sun beams, and merely asks to be sliced thick and dressed with some sea salt and cracked pepper and a drizzle of olive oil. Torn fresh basil if you have it. When you taste it you taste the earth and the sky while nymphs play the fiddle and dance. It is a near-sacred experience that we get to enjoy for a short time each summer, and then we pack away our longings until next year. We accept a life without tomatoes for the better part of the year. We ignore those crunchy, gassed-up grocery store imitations from Mexico. We hold out, we say \"no,\" because we understand that proper tomatoes are worth the wait.  

The existence of the pale, crunchy roma tomato is our collective failure as a consuming public. We should be better than this. We should all think we deserve better, because we do. The MTO kitchen staff can't fully be blamed for this sad culinary ritual, because apparently we have all of us simultaneously fallen asleep at the tomato wheel. But a restaurant that prides itself on fresh ingredients and seasonality should have a finer sense of what counts as fresh, and what doesn't, and if these pale pink impostors can sneak under the kitchen's radar then one's confidence is a little shaken. Don't settle for what your customers settle for, MTO. Not everything is fresh all the time. I'd happily settle for roasted red peppers, or pretty much anything pickled. Or simply nothing at all, which would be better than negative-tomato."}
{"text":"First time here, and I will for sure be back! I ordered the chicken in the waffle, and it has got be in my top 3 for the best chicken and waffles. If you're into savory and sweet stuff at the same time, this is your dish to try! Fluffy waffles, crunchy well-seasoned chicken breast that is covered in a country gravy. Comes with shoe string fries, too! 

Super friendly staff, cute and cozy area, and great food! Will recommend to friends and family about this place!"}
{"text":"Not impressed. It definitely was not worth what you pay for it. It wasn't  terrible, but the food and smoothies were bland. I feel like I could have gone somewhere a little cheaper and gotten the same or better meal. Underwhelmed and unsatisfied."}
{"text":"A short walk from downtown is this little jem.  Clean and decorated very nicely, but it doesn't stop there, the food is very fresh and original.   I've only visited here twice but both times I enjoyed the meal and atmosphere very much.   
On my last visit I had BLTAE, (Bacon Lettuce Tomato  Avocado Eggs)and delicious and messy, but messy in a good way.  It was a creative combination of ingredients that tasted really good.  Should just be renamed the Best Lettuce Tomato Avocado Ever, lol.   My partner in foodism had the Cobb salad which was huge with tons of goodies.  
On my first visit I had the the chicken waffles which was also very good.   So if your looking for some solid good food, try this place.  
Oh one more thing the free yelp cookie,  I figured it be just a plain old cookie, nope, it came out warm, very nice touch."}
{"text":"cute little eatery off the strip! the food was fresh and delicious. you must try the chicken in a waffle. it's the perfect blend of savory and sweet for brunch; and the gravy is absolutely mouth watering. 

the service was great, the food came out quickly and the GM, Ben, came by our table to see how we were doing. 

if you're looking for a brunch/breakfast in Vegas that's reasonably priced and a few minutes from the strip, this is the place to be!"}
{"text":"I am all about breakfast! It's my favorite meal of the day hands down. So this is of course perfect for me. 

We have been twice and I am severely addicted. I literally crave those darn lemon poppyseed pancakes. It's truly a curse. I gave in to the dark side and there is no going back for me now. Muahahahahahah! I also really enjoy the mini honey doughnuts, although they've been doughy both times. The first time we actually sent them back because they were so undercooked. But none of that stops me from loving every little bit of this place. This last time we went I had the MTO breakfast. Everything was perfect and just the right amount of each item. Of course if you try to finish it all you will definitely be fully nourished.(All depending on your size of course...I ate too much!!) If I remember right it was 2 or 3 eggs, bacon, spam, turkey bacon, mash browns and bread. Oh yah, and chicken sausage which I was not a fan of. Luckily my father in law ordered the lemon poppy seed pancakes so I could still get my fix. 

The décor is some of my favorite. Very modern and eclectic. The whole place actually has a very LA feel to me. We all enjoyed the atmosphere even though the music was pretty loud that day. I don't like having to raise my voice to someone who is half a foot away from me, ha. 

Excellent service both times and great food! I will continue to make it downtown for breakfast as long as they don't get rid of those pancakes. We might have some serious issues if that happens!"}
{"text":"I was WOWed by the food here.  I had the daily special 'Black Chicken', simple dish but it was incredible, cooked perfectly and full of flavor.

If I was in the right mood I would have gotten the 'Fat Elvis'!

Definitely a place for Breakfast/Brunch.

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Love this place!  High protein, healthy food.  I had the Mto Breakfast: three eggs any style chicken sausage (delicious ), turkey bacon, spam (yum!) and bacon, sourdough, mash browns (awesome! ).  A beast of a meal!  The entire menu is very original.  If your looking for a greasy spoon diner this is not it.  No Flo here!  Going to try the teriyaki turkey burger soon!  The downtown is on fire with new restaurants and this is one of the very best!"}
{"text":"Cool place.  The food is unique and really good.  I had lemon poppyseed pancakes with blueberry compote.  Yum!  The restaurant has bright colors and modern design...very clean.  I think it is overpriced, however, I will return for the pancakes."}
{"text":"Showed up near closing time. Treated me like I was the first customer of the day, very welcoming. 

Had \"The Bob\" sandwich. Delicious. 

Spoke with the head chef at length about the history of the business as well as some football. Good company while waiting for the food. 

Great visit. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I've been here a good half dozen times, and I'm very happy each time.  Staff is very friendly, there is usually no wait, easy to get to- there's a parking garage attached to it.  

My Favorites:
- The Philly- this is a lowbrow version, with velveeta cheese.  I like lowbrow food though, sometimes.  It has carmelized onions that are cooked in red wine which go well with the velveeta, somehow. 
- French Onion Soup- it's huge- it has shredded cheese on top of the melted cheese on top of the crouton.  I get a side caesar salad with this for $3.  So $10 total for HUGE soup and good sized side salad. 
- Lattes- Coffee or latte is only $3! Actually cheaper than Sbux!
- Fried Apple Rings- doesn't need much explanation. 

Could Use Some Work:
- Vinaigrette dressing is very bitter, I feel like it's 99% pure vinegar. Their ranch is great though, you can tell it's home made. Get that instead.  The vinaigrette will seriously melt your teeth.   
- No appetizers on the menu! Only side dishes :("}
{"text":"Going to write this review, even though it may be a bit unfair. We went to MTO on our first day looking for a healthier breakfast. They don't do decaf coffee, which is really a bad idea, but we figured we soldier on and do breakfast - the menu looks pretty good. When she came back to take our order she told us they weren't making huevos rancheros. Strike two, really. She was perfectly nice an apologetic, but we decided to move on. We paid for the juice, tipped her, and headed further down Main to Makers and Finders - which is simply amazing. I'll leave it at that..."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, friendly people. Tough to ask for more. We had the bodybuilder scramble and the Fat Elvis. Would order either one again without question. Coffee was really good in big cups, and we even got free cookies for checking in to yelp! Great place!!!"}
{"text":"If you're in Vegas staying off the strip, make the drive to this place. The food served here will nurse your hangover or simply satisfy your craving. 

My friends and I arrived and were seated right away. The place was almost packed but it's not crowded. There's a parking structure next to/above this place. 

I ordered the avocado omelette and, unlike most places, the serving size was not overwhelmingly big. It is just the right size to get your day started. So then I ordered a side of their Lemon Poppyseed Blueberry Pancakes. I advise you to do the same. The taste, the fluffiness, the ingredients...yes! Those are pretty big and they serve three per plate so I shared with my table. The coffee is rich! 

The service? Outstanding! You're greeted as soon you walk in and they're very attentive. Service is fast and your food is rapidly prepared. My next trip to Las Vegas I'll make sure to stop here and have the Kentucky Fried Chicken Biscuit w/ gravy (my friend had this, I had a bite and it was tasty! And not exactly big fan of gravy."}
{"text":"I have been let down by yelp. This place was a huge mistake. Im embarassed for picking this place. There ware 5 of us and everyone didnt enjoy thier meal. I had the mto breakfast and it was so bland. My mom got the avocado wrap the wrap was just ok. My cousin was told she couldnt order chicken tenders and fries because she wasnt a kid. So she was forced to order pancakes. Pancakes were bland and dry. My niece ordered French toast that were too soggy to enjoy. Lastly my sister ordered vegan pancakes she didn't even finish them. I am really baffled with all of these good reviews. Did everyone at the table just happen to order the wrong thing!? We would have been happier going to Ihop. The bill was around 80$  WTF not worth it at all."}
{"text":"First time visiting this place ,  we were looking for a place that had bottomless mimosas and they did! We went everything from the mango flavored mimosa,  to the hangover burger! 
Will return when I come back to vegas!"}
{"text":"After leaving our shitty motel room, we were glad to stumble upon here for breakfast thanks to the great reviews from Yelp. 

Good thing we came a bit early because after we left, half the place was packed with people. Knowing how most American restaurants are, we only ordered 2 dishes for us and our 2 kids. It was enough to feed 5 people. We also got 2 fresh juices (a meal in itself) and the Deep Fried Apple Dessert. It was a lot of food. 

Surprisingly, we still finished mostly everything on our plates. Next time we return to Las Vegas, this will be on our top list of places to come to for breakfast."}
{"text":"Excellent option to nasty buffets, and crowded hotels, not only that but the food is very well created, excellent menu options, great quality and freshness, location is beautiful, my only negative it's that is one of those places they keep you waiting a bit longer that needed! You know....  
That is the only reason I didn't added the 5th start.,  Other than that! It's a must try place!"}
{"text":"Great find downtown. Queso Carne was delicious. Waitress was attentive and also hilarious.  Ordered ranch as a side, told me white people love ranch.  She was spot on, the ranch was great, dip and stick type. They have Estrella in bottle which is great, brings me back to days in Spain. Overall great service and great food. I want to go back to explore the rest of the menu. Apparently they deliver as well. Give it a try."}
{"text":"I randomly came here and it was quite amazing.  The atmosphere that this place gives off is very inviting.  With places like this, it makes it nice to go to the MTO.  The food was really amazing I had the Turkey Melt and it was quite exquisite, the ingredients in the Melt tasted really fresh and delicious where I also tried the Fat Elvis and it was greasy and delicious.  I also tried the Apple Doughnuts thing which was interesting because it was basically a healthy doughnut.  The one main thing that I really liked was how fast the food came out as well as the service you receive from people."}
{"text":"This place was awesome! Stopped in for breakfast while on vacation in Las Vegas. It was walking distance from our hotel which was even better. The service was great and our waitress was exceptional. I started off with the MTO juice which I highly recommend. It was refreshing and not too sweet, definitely a good start to my day. I ordered the Yoga Pant omelet with avocado. It was perfect. Very filling but also light. My husband ordered the Kentucky breakfast which was fried chicken over a biscuit with gravy and hash browns. I snuck a taste and it was delicious! Lastly, we shared the lemon poppyseed pancake. Omg! You just get this! I was worried that it would be super sweet but it wasn't. It was awesome. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"unlimited bloody marys for $20...could be useful sometime. had their apple rings... definitely recommend it. also had their KFC which is fried chicken with gravy and egg. it wasn't bad but also wasn't great. great service and wouldn't mind coming back to try other things."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and even better food. Make sure you try a juice. The service was attentive and the place is clean and modern.  Healthy food options. The fruit cup was the best! Park in the city garage next door. It cheap."}
{"text":"Way too overpriced!! The food was...eh...good. I had the broccoli omelette. It was ok. It came with the omelette and about 4 sprigs of lettuce. Was that a generous side portion? The omelette was $11...come on, really? It was not that serious of an omelette to get away with charging that. My daughter had the kids pancake. It was loaded with chocolate chips, powdered sugar and a red mystery gel. It was good but not for what they charged. All in I spent $30. I don't mind paying for quality OR quantity but this place was clearly neither. The atmosphere was nice and staff was nice. I will definitely not be back nor do I recommend this place. There are better spots to get food from with better portions and quality."}
{"text":"I came to MTO Cafe the second day it had opened. Like Bonnie C., I too am confused how there are reviews about the place before it had opened. The reviewers don't mention a soft-opening....

Anywho, I must say that I was very excited to check the place out, since another place to eat lunch downtown is always welcome. But in this case I have to say I left a little sad. 

I had checked out their menu before heading over and had my eye on a couple of items. We were promptly seated and brought our drinks and while my friend perused the menu I checked out the décor. The place looks great, with nice big windows and a 50's diner meets modern bistro vibe. I ordered the Queso Carne, per the menu is skirt steak, velveeta cheese and red wine drunken onions. The waitress said it was a wrap. My friend ordered the Tree Hugger, with quinoa and veggies. The waitress asked my friend if he wanted any sides and my friend said no. When she brought out his dish we saw that it LITERALLY was just the quinoa patty. No bread, no sides. What?!? Granted, she did ask if he wanted a side, but if she had specified how diminutive the dish was he might've ordered something else. My dish came on a hamburger bun (which was really good, btw) not a wrap as the waitress had said. It had fries with it, which were fresh and tasty, although the menu did not specify it came with fries. 

I think there should be a bit of consistency on the menu, how can some dishes come with a side and others don't? My burger was ok, the meat wasn't really skirt steak, and it was more like little cubes of meat. I think our meals were overpriced. We left feeling a bit deflated. 

I will be back to give them another try for their breakfast because I've seen pictures of the dishes and they look larger than the lunch dishes."}
{"text":"Avocado scramble - yummy!!! Added chicken sausage but would not recommend it, was not a lot of meat, still delicious though. And the lemon poppy pancakes where delicious - not super lemon-y and you could definitely taste the ginger in the sauce. I don't personally like fried chicken, but almost everyone else ordered it and said it was delicious. Great break from the overpriced food and buffets on the strip."}
{"text":"FOR THE CATERING SIDE (prepared on location). I attended a party (almost 300 in attendance) last year.

Here's what was served according to stations: 
(1) chicken skewers, beef skewers, octopus, pickled vegetables 
(2) mini burgers, salmon veggie tart, pumpkin soups in mini pumpkins
(3) dessert station: a.) freshly made mini ice cream cones- chocolate & strawberry balsamic b.) mini cake cube platters

Here's what was served, via models carrying platters:
(1) mini beef wellington
(2) chicken pot-pie 
(3) hummus & kale wraps (like sushi)

Everything was delicious and amazing. The presentation was great, too. There was definitely enough to go around---I really do not think there were any complaints about the food. My favorite stand-outs were both of the skewers, mini burgers, mini beef wellington, and the mini ice cream cones too. 

KUDOS to all the chefs, staff, and everyone (owners) from the restaurant. Everyone was nice, professional, and very involved in the entire process. It's a good sign when everyone talks about how delicious the food was, the very next day."}
{"text":"I think that this place has become a new favorite for me. 

I loved the minimal decor while still being super bright and cheery with a lot of light flooding in from the large windows. 

The service was as good as you can get. Very fast with refills, requests, orders, and they were all hilarious too (such as joking about our love for the forensic file type shows on the ID channel or as Amy Poehler calls it: tragedy porn). 

I loved the coffee because of the large steamy mugs with tons of refills. I also loved the little flavoring you could add and the legit cream to go in those mugs. 

I ordered the avocado skillet and the boyfriend got the MTO breakfast (he was excited about ALL of the meat coming with the dish as some places make you choose what meat you want). The dishes were fresh and tasty. 

Overall, this place hit so many of the things I like in a restaurant. They also validate parking too!"}
{"text":"Great service,  large portions haha, great fat filling food. I don't get to eat this food often because I live a healthy life style.  Chicken and waffles are a good look and a great taste shot out to Tyler and Manon"}
{"text":"This is one of the best breakfast places in Vegas. Convenient parking. Clean and hip atmosphere. 

The service... It doesn't get any better! Superb!  Incredible attitude and genuine interest in pleasing the customer. 

Bacon, pancakes, coffee, eggs... Perfect!

Quality food at affordable prices. Stuffed myself and ordered enough for 2 and the Bill was $15. BOOM! 

I want to come back and try some of the signature dishes, which I didn't know about when I arrived. I Didn't even look at the menu when I arrived... I just ordered."}
{"text":"food was deliciously good. portions were big for the price you paid for. great lication. nice ambience. a good place to hang out too"}
{"text":"Great food and lovely customer service. I felt like I if I was at home . Wish we would a place like this in  Los Angeles ."}
{"text":"Today was my second time at MTO. I left feeling like the first time I've visited: super nice, some ooomph is missing. I've had coffee and my little one had Mac and cheese, he didn't like it (but it was super yummy, it's not them - it's him ;)). They were great about returning the dish and getting chicken fingers instead, which he loved. Other than that coffee was alright and although the menu selection is ok, nothing was too exciting for me that made me feel  I've had to try it out. 
So overall nice fountain view, great spot to sit outside if the weather allows so and generally a four star for me."}
{"text":"4.5. Very nicely designed space. Great menu.  Excellent service. Good pricing. An excellent weekend brunch choice. (Bottomless mimosas!)

Meats on the MTO plate might have been browned a bit more for better color and texture but were nevertheless good. Great breakfast wraps as well (which can, alternatively, be omelets instead).  Fresh juice choices as well as coffee and espresso. 

Very impressed."}
{"text":"This is a good place for a lunch or late breakfast before a day of shopping. I really like their chicken skillet with egg whites. It's pretty healthy and really flavorful.
The service is always friendly when they take your order and the food comes out pretty quickly even when they're busy."}
{"text":"So, my husband, daughter and I escaped out last Saturday evening for a quick bite to eat at Downtown Summerlin.  I had seen some great things about MTO Cafe on Yelp and through Instagram and suggested we give it a try as we were going for something quick and easy.  We each ordered a salad and split a side of fries(I know kind of an oxymoron, but this was concidered a cheat meal).  We decided to sit on the patio, as I always love the option to do so.  We made our way out and had a seat.

Not long after a gentleman with a very large dog seated himself behind us.  No qualms by us about the dog, but that's what initially drew my attention to the fact that we weren't lone soldiers on the patio.

We received our food, which was great(review not 100% on that).  It was from that point that I began to listen to the gentleman behind us begin to boss the friendly cashier around as to his demands of his order.  Then, something was not up to par on his order and he called for the manager on duty that evening.  He came out, also a seemingly nice young man, and he too got an earful from this guy.  

Now, never at any time, would I say this guy was yelling; but I repeatedly kept mouthing to my husband how rude this guy was behind us.  When we got up to leave, I was so curious to know about this guy as at this point I thought he couldn't have just been some customer off the street; he had to have an affiliation.  So, I walked back inside to ask the initial friendly cashier; and come to find out, he was a partner in the restaurant! 

Mr. Matt Moore, if you are reading this, it is one thing to ensure the food that is coming our of your kitchen is prepared well; I can appreciate that immensely, but it's another to demean your employees on your restaurant's patio, especially when there are customers within earshot.  I definitely see you have a lot of experience in the design and construction industry.  And, I also see you served for us; THANK YOU for that.  However, may I make a small recommendation:  Customer Service.  You built this business for a reason and are a part of it's face.  When you are part of its face, I would imagine you most certainly wouldn't want customers thinking that face is full of belittlement or superiority, but rather support and collaboration.  YOU are part of YOUR brand...."}
{"text":"We LOVE coming here for brunch even though they are busy the wait time for the food isn't long. Their fries are so good everything I've tried I've never been disappointed."}
{"text":"I enjoyed food and place a lot , love the menu, tried chicken and waffle ,was delicious I will came back for sure"}
{"text":"Was very disappointed at the lack of choices on the menus and the fact that a place focused on \"healthy and vegan friendly\" items has Absolutely no Gluten free choices other then an omelet and tomato soup.  Food was good but not great. Probably will not eat here again.  Cute decor."}
{"text":"Fantastic place to stop and eat. We ordered the rancho huervos, fruit cup and iced mocha and everything was very tasty. Quick and courteous from seating to eating. Waiter was friendly and provided directions to the arts district. Would definitely come again and recommend."}
{"text":"I rarely write reviews, but felt compelled to do so today after the sweet manager/owner(?) took my 4 month old baby and walked around with her so I could have a few minutes to eat. It was such a kind gesture, and something I won't ever forget. Exceptional service, kind people and tasty food."}
{"text":"These guys are so \"hit or miss\" in terms of service, it's really disappointing. I'm a local trying to support local but the inconsistent service is really a drawback that makes me think twice before going there. The food is always good, that's the one thing I will say.

The service is up and down. For example, there were 4 tables and 2 servers while we were there yesterday and it still took almost a half hour for our food to come out. And that includes a table that was seated after us getting their food before us. No apologies, no discounts, nothing. Just flat out pretended nothing happened.

I think the moral of the story is don't go to MTO hungry. Have a snack before you go because if you show up hungry it is bound to take a ridiculous amount of time to get your food."}
{"text":"We were thrilled to discover this spot. It is a relief to have a normal breakfast, with normal prices, that is not in a casino after many days on the strip!!!

The MTO breakfast was excellent, as were the seasonal vegetables (brussel sprouts perfectly seasoned). The lighting and decor is pretty!

We went for the bottomless Bloodies & Mimosas... WARNING: the bloody's are made with SOJU so they don't taste like what you are used to.* and were impressed with everything. 

Cute, fresh, pretty, light. Super friendly staff. 
Go here and enjoy."}
{"text":"Found this place via yelp! 

Cute atmosphere for brunch and the staff was very friendly and helpful. I had the KFC as recommended by our server. So glad I took his advice! It was delicious. I will definitely be back. 

Added bonus, if you check-in you get a free cookie! It was a nice added dessert with my coffee!"}
{"text":"We came here for brunch on a Saturday.

It is located in the downtown area but slightly off the beaten path.

The restaurant is small but we were seated right away.

They do offer a brunch menu and bottomless mimosas option on the weekend. I had the chicken and waffles which was divine. I never had a variation of this dish served like this before and it was excellent.

The staff was friendly and the prices were fair.

TIP: if you do park in the adjacent parking garage get your ticket validated. You will have to put your parking ticket and the validated ticket into the parking machine before you go back to your car. Make sure the machine gives you a receipt because you will need to swipe it to get out of the garage."}
{"text":"Meh decent food, it really throws me off when my food isn't Hot, My wifes was on point heat wise but mine was obviously waiting on the side til her's was done, cold toast luke warm everything else witch means the cook has no timing witch means to me you don't take pride in what you do, The service was good though"}
{"text":"This place is excellent! The food was great, was a bit of a wait, we went at about 10 am and by the time we left it was packed and for good reason! I had the Kentucky Fried Chicken which was so good! the mashbrowns, gravy, and chicken were cooked to perfection. The coffee was smooth and had a great taste. The owner came by to ask how the food was and made us feel welcomed. I will come back and will definitely check out the Summerlin location!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast/brunch spot! The service was awesome and the waitress was super energetic and friendly. If you check in on yelp make sure you get the free cookie! Our table got a variety of food off the menu and everyone had something good to say about it. Next time I'm in Vegas I will be coming back here for sure. They also have fresh juices that are delicious!!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent, as many others have mentioned. The hangover burger was and had a more than generous (yay!) portion of avocado. 

But I want to focus on the other aspects of my experience. The environment was clean, bright, modern and welcoming. Our server Michelle was friendly and took great care of us, proactively checking with us several times to ensure we have everything we needed. They also validated our parking!

Excellent experience and recommended!"}
{"text":"Great place with great food and service. If you're lucky enough to have Lisa wait on you you will thank your lucky stars, she is such a doll!!!"}
{"text":"The food was great here. The experience, not so much. I arrived with my group of 4 on a Saturday morning at 9am and it was not busy, with only 2 other small parties there. We got seated right away.

We ordered the stuffed cinnamon apple french toast, red velvet pancakes, and steak & eggs. We also checked in on Yelp for the chocolate chip cookie. The cookie was a nice touch, thin and full of chocolate chips. After the cookie arrived, many people started trickling in and the restaurant became full. We waited 30 minutes for our food. That's really long, considering there were only 2 other parties there when we arrived. The good part is that the food is probably more fresh and made to order, unlike some other restaurants.

The steak & eggs was filling and cooked very good. The red velvet pancakes were very indulgent and filling. The french toast was truly filled with cinnamon apples! We devoured everything. At the end when we paid our bill, the waiter brought us the parking validation card.

Parking: We parked in the adjacent parking structure. On Saturdays & Sundays, parking is $3 flat rate. I got a validation card from MTO. Upon leaving the parking structure, we had to insert our parking card first and then the validation card from MTO after. The validation subtracted $1.50, so we still had to pay $1.50. So much for a validation. It's only a partial validation. I could have parked along the streets."}
{"text":"I'm not one to complain about prices when the quality is in line with what is charged, however mto at Downtown Summerlin is outright ridiculous.

I went in for a smoothie and was amazed by a $9 price tag for a Creamsicle smoothie, but thought it must taste amazing for $9!!! It was terrible. Nothing but orange juice and vanilla soy. 

Horrible and $9 down the drain. Staff seemed very young and inexperienced as well. Buyer beware!"}
{"text":"I love this place !! The food , atmosphere , and drinks are on point !! It's casual friendly , and the service is 5 stars !! My favorite are the pancakes ,and Bloody Mary's. They can seat large parties and they have really comfy booths ! The owner , Ben , is super chill and funny !! It's a gem in Las Vegas , and if you want to meet up with old friends or go on a date this is the spot !!!"}
{"text":"MTO (Made To Order) is an absolute amazing find in downtown Vegas. It is almost hidden near the City Govt Center under a parking structure (they do validate your parking for up to $1.50, just ask your server for a validation ticket when you leave), but well worth the search.

When you walk in you immediately feel the energy of the place. Its open layout and very comtempo vibe from the bright and warm accent colors and funky artwork to the made-by-the-owner furnishings, it is instantly inviting! We were immediately greeted and sat when we walked in the door and our waitress was at our table taking our drink order in no time flat. The easy to read menus have a eclectic selection of \"made to order\" items that are designed to feed your need for farm fresh, locally grown food or to nurse a hangover with something a bit more savory. Either way you are in for a treat!

I had the Red Juice, which was a fantastically healthy mix of beets, arugula, lime, carrot, red pepper, and pomegranate. It actually tasted delicious! To counteract my health conscious, I ordered some coffee (which is Grade A btw) and the Fat Elvis. This hunka-hunka pile of WTF-is-happening-in-my-mouthness is peanut butter, bananas, Nutella, AND bacon on legit french toast! To offset the insanely delicious gluttony, the dish is accompanied by a healthy heap of strawberries and blackberry garnish. I was definitely a fat, if not completely satisfied, Elvis (impersonator) when I was finally finished!

I had mentioned to our fantastic waitress that this place belonged in Austin as the vibe, decor, and menu just screamed Hyde Park, Rosedale, or SoCo and as luck would have it the very nice owner, Ben was sitting in a booth across from us. He graciously came over to say \"hi\" (he actually interacted with almost every single customer in the place) and we had a fantastic convo. Honestly, a great guy and his awesomeness definitely translates into this great restaurant. He had us try the fried apples (which literally hurt to eat I was so full, but man, it hurt soooo good!) which were also to-die-for delish!

I was so sad to have discovered this place as I was leaving Las Vegas (see what I did there?) because I would have eaten here for every meal for my three day-two night stay! 

I guess I'll just have to wait til the next time I'm in downtown Vegas, or better yet until the grand opening of their new location in ATX!"}
{"text":"My sister and I decided to have a sister date somewhere downtown and she suggested we try MTO Cafe. Based on the pictures we found on Yelp, it looked well-lit and great for our brunch.

ATMOSPHERE
Parked conveniently on the street in a designated meter area. I know there is a parking garage located behind the restaurant too. Walking into MTO Cafe, it is lit during the day with the natural light streaming from the floor-to-ceiling windows. Very busy, but the service and wait time was quick and friendly. The space inside is very modern chic and relaxing. Perfect for our brunch. Also, my sister LOVED the fact that her phone was dying and they had an outlet literally on the wall at our table, eye-level.

FOOD
I ordered the MTO Avocado Omelet. Portion size was fine, I wasn't starving, so the meal was great for me. Lots of avocado, and served with a tiny salad and a few fresh fruits. I also ordered the Green Juice, very very yummy! I loved how many fruits and vegetables were in there, and you could definitely taste the freshness.

SERVICE
Water was always refilled, friendly service but kind of absent most of the time. We wanted hot sauce, but couldn't be attended til 15 minutes after we got our food. Place was busy, so understandable. I couldn't finish my juice and took it to go. They promptly gave me a to go cup for it.

Overall, relaxing and good experience, but not incredible. I feel like I could have cooked the omelet at home, but the green juice and atmosphere was great. It's a place to go to enjoy fun conversation, light food and the hippie-chic feel of Downtown Las Vegas' booming food culture."}
{"text":"We loved it here sooo much!!! Food was great and the service was excellent,. Our waitress Tamara was very friendly and provided us with a great experience. One of the other ladies, Donna, even fanned my friends food for her! Lol Awesome fun place...and clean!"}
{"text":"Simply amazing!! Love this place and so does my family. Top favorite breakfast spots in Vegas. Definitely recommend people try it and the chicken in a waffle is delicious"}
{"text":"Great breakfast place 
Love the skillet egg options 
Great ambiance and very clean
The manager was very courteous as was the server they made sure we were ok and were enjoying our meal. My go to breakfast spot for sure in Vegas ! Pls open in Toronto !"}
{"text":"Great experience and delicious food. The lovely young lady who to our order was sweet and gave great recommendations. I accidentally order the grilled cheese instead of the kids grilled cheese and they fixed it ASAP. The Bob Sandwich was delicious, the wings were different and fantastic, fries were thin and hot and the MTO doughnuts were mmmMM honeylicious. I recommend this place over Crave or Skinny Fats. It's yummy comfort food for less than $50."}
{"text":"Came here to wrap up the end of a long weekend staying in downtown Vegas. Portions were healthy, food was fresh and quick and the service was great! Would definitely visit next time I'm out in this area of town."}
{"text":"Really great little place... I ordered an avocado skillet without onions and my friend had the broccoli skillet which I thought sounded terrible, but he loved. I wish all the good spots weren't only downtown but the service and everything else was also really good."}
{"text":"OK my husband ordered the yoga pants with chicken sausage, I ordered the apple donut and green juice. This is the place to come if you want to try new delicious stuff. Great breakfast. Great coffee. Great apple donut! Never thought I'd like the fried apple, but after photos, just had to try it. Sure glad I did. It's a fried granny smith apple. I never knew it could taste so good. Great for Paleos and vegans"}
{"text":"Service was A1.  The management as well as the wait staff were very friendly and attentive.  The food was good not great but i think that us because they lend more towards healthier cooking and i didnt know that going in.  The waiter made one mistake on our order but was expedient in making it right."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch! Café was full with a steady stream of customers but there was never a wait. We are locals and it's definitely nice to be able to get brunch without the trouble of the Strip or Parking or drunk people.  It's nice to find small places like this in the heart of Downtown Las Vegas.

Food is very good! I had the chicken sausage omelet which was very good and fluffy. Fiancé had the chicken and biscuit with gravy which was also tasty. 

Free chocolate chip cookie when you check in on Yelp.

Would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Good breakfast, mash browns are the bomb. Good coffee, great bread. Great ambience, variety of breakfast meat in the MTO was plentiful. Find them before everybody else does, and everybody else will!"}
{"text":"Lovely service and incredible food. Our server was great,  and you just can't beat bottomless mimosas for $20."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time with friends. Walking distance from City Hall. Nice open set up, window seating, cafeteria style seating and booths. The host was also our waiter, nice and prompt with taking our order. Coffee is super good! I'm really picky with standard drip coffee, I hate mild, light coffee but theirs was a nice bold dark roast! I ordered the Avocado skillet. Fluffy eggs, pepper jack cheese, tomatillo sauce with slices of avocado on top of a bed of hash browns. Very filling! Portion was big! My gf ordered the poppyseed pancakes with blueberries and blueberry compote. Pancakes were hearty and tasty, the blueberry compote added a nice tart flavor. All in all a great spot for breakfast and brunch served all day. Will be coming back in the future!"}
{"text":"Greatest place in Las Vegas!!!!

Great service!  Great food!  Super nice for families!  Affordable."}
{"text":"My family and I recently visited Las Vegas for an end of summer get away.  Vegas as always was fun but the MTO Cafe was definitely one of the highlights!  The great food, great atmosphere, and super excellent service will make the MTO cafe a sure stop on our next trip.  We will be sure to let friends and family know!"}
{"text":"I am obsessed!

What an impressive breakfast joint all around.

I went with one of my girlfriends who lives downtown - she's raved before about how awesome the breakfast dishes are here. MTO is small in size with a beautiful high ceiling. The ambiance is bright - pretty trendy, hipster, and inviting. 

Rachel was our server and she was laid back and personable, making our breakfast experience very comfortable. She greeted us right away and asked for our drink orders. My friend and I both asked for a water and a mimosa (to start the day off right!) Let me tell you - their mimosa is THE perfect mimosa. I watched them pour our glasses and they ensure you get plenty of champagne, topped with fresh OJ. For $5 a glass ($20 for bottomless) you definitely cannot go wrong with their strong and refreshing mimosas! 

One thing I noticed about MTO is how ginormous their water glasses are. So. Perfect. Helps me from constantly waiting or having to ask for refills. Coffee also comes in a huge mug. I'm a fan. Breakfast dishes (the most important part) were very tasty which completes MTO's 5 star review:

- Steak and Eggs
6oz Tri Tip comes cut with toast, 3 eggs any style, and hash brown. The steak was seasoned perfectly so I didn't need to add anything. The portion of the entire dish was huge, I couldn't finish it all!

- Avocado Scramble 
Scrambled eggs topped with cheese, jalapeños, cilantro, and tomatillo sauce. My friend added chicken sausage for some extra protein and topped her dish with Cholula sauce. Also a delicious and filling breakfast dish! 

Love this breakfast spot. I will definitely be back for breakfast AND mimosas!"}
{"text":"This place lit up my tongue, the people were so amazing and friendly it was a change for me being from North Dakota. Every time I'm in Vegas I will be back always."}
{"text":"I've slowly been eating my way through MTO Cafe's menu. Lucky for me the menu is not large. Also lucky for me most everything served at MTO hits the spot, is tasty, and has been brought to me with good service.

The cafe itself I enjoy most when there are only a few patrons and their music is not up too loud. I have been here a couple times and Ive been annoyed with the volume.

Coffee here is a never fail. Period. Big cups. Good coffee. Plenty of refills.

On my last visit I tried the lemon poppy seed pancakes with blueberry conpote with a side of chicken sausage. Chicken sausage is stellar. Always good, with a medely of slightly sweet spices and juicy with a slight snap. Have on the side. Have mixed in an omelet. Just have it.

Pancakes were \"eh\". The flavor was not enough for me to appreciate them being a \"lemon\" pancake. Blueberry compote, while rich and thick was disappointing because it offered no sugar/sweet flavor to the dish. So all in all these pancakes were bland with a tart sauce on top of them. Pass.

Still holding at 4 stars. I will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Well worth the short walk from the Fremont Experience.  Down-home flavors and a nice assortment of options in a hipster - cool location.  We had the Kentucky Fried Chicken and Chorizo Skillet.  Both were tasty and well prepared.  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"A mistake. The food was heavy and greasy. I had The Bob which was not nearly as light and organic as it sounds and James had the Mac and cheese which was only ok. My latte was essentially a cup of milk with some coffee in it--almost no foam. Overall everything was definitely not worth the $30 it cost. At all. 

I will say that all the employees I encountered were very nice and friendly but for the food, man, I REALLY do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Everything about this place was awesome. The menu was wonderfully laid out, very attentive staff (not just our waiter), very clean and yes the mimosas were bottomless! 1 thing to keep in mind, the music is louder than I am used to, which had the trickle effect that all patrons were talking louder. I'll be back to try another delicious dish"}
{"text":"We loved this place so much we came a second day. The BLTAE sandwich is to die for. Staff is hip and friendly. The bottomless lemonade was yum! Can't wait to come back tomorrow!"}
{"text":"In Vegas, I usually stay at the Plaza. I had no idea this little gem was right down the street. Great job, guys...."}
{"text":"I had the chicken skillet and the red juice! Both were delicious. I prefer the red juice over the green juice but both are good. The staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Food was good. But service was very poor. We did have a big party and delays are expected (over an hour for the food). But when the bill came we were told the check could not have been split. So we spent 15 minutes figuring out what everyone owes. In my opinion I believe it's because of the 20% auto Grat. I might try it again, but this first experience left a bad taste in my mouth (pardon the pun)."}
{"text":"One of my top favorite places to eat breakfast or lunch. For breakfast my fav is the \"fat Elvis\"... French toast layered with peanut butter, Nutella, banana  and crispy bacon  .. yes bacon  and topped with strawberries  , syrup and powdered sugar. Absolutely delicious. For lunch I recommend the \"hangover burger\" the juiciest fully loaded burger  with egg . Always cooked perfectly. Customer service is always great and friendly. They always recognize us and say welcome back guys. I love how they are very creative and always creating new things.... today they offered a blueberry ginger lemonade. Last time it was mango lemonade. They offer fresh healthy juices. I'm telling you this place is great . Fan for life"}
{"text":"Awesome!
I loved the atmosphere. The food was great (and it was my first time here!) The servers were great (I'd definitely recommend this place.)
And I'll most definitely be back as well.
Oh, and the mimosas...."}
{"text":"I found this place on Yelp and decided to check it out since it was close to my hotel. Omg! Food was delicious and my friends praised me for finding this place. I am definitely going back when I'm back in town."}
{"text":"Had breakfast. Everything was cooked perfectly from the cheesy eggs, bacon, toast, pancakes, spam, and sausage.  Services was very good. Portions large. Atmosphere excellent."}
{"text":"Tried the chicken n' waffles.  Nom nom!  Vegan pancakes on point. Oh. Do. Not. Forget!  get the fried apple rings. Jesssus!  It's worth the weight gain here"}
{"text":"Went for brunch. Sherolyn was our server. She was great.  She gave great suggestions for vegetarians. The tree hugger was amazing. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Food is amazing and staff are friendly but if you want a pick up to go order you have to pay for it up front?!?! Not convenient when you're driving, which is when I order most of my to go orders. 
Not great customer service. All other restaurants don't require it."}
{"text":"Amazing food!!! I had the Queso Carne and it is the best hangover cure. Great service and it's a trendy spot for DTLV."}
{"text":"Second time coming here, I work in the mall so this place is really convenient for my coworkers and I. We always leave stuffed we never had a bad experience and the staff is really friendly. I just wish they didn't charge for the ranch. I got a super spicy sandwich and it was honestly a struggle to eat it without ranch."}
{"text":"Amazing food!!!!.Had the Quinoa crunch salad great flavors big enough for 2 to share. Left room for the Vegan Carrot Coconut pancakes. scrumptious delicious desert, Well I ate it as a desert have enough left over for the next 3 days. Huge Huge portions well worth the price will definitely be back, maybe as soon as tomorrow."}
{"text":"I get their food whenever I am near. Learned about these guys when our old office was near downtown. Their BLT is exactly the kind of BLT I've been making since I was a kid, so naturally we vibed. Staffs are all super cool and the atmosphere is chill.  

Also thanks for delivering!"}
{"text":"Talk about an interesting location. This restaurant is in the parking garage for the city of Las Vegas. The service was really good the menu is kind of plain.  They have a few breakfast items and a few lunch items.  I had an omelette and it wasn't anything great but it wasn't bad.  It was slightly pricey for what you got.  I wouldn't say no to this place but I don't think you want to go here a lot."}
{"text":"Came in for breakfast and asked for seasonal waffles and they tell us that they are out of syrup.  Who runs out of syrup at a breakfast joint that advertises pancakes, waffles and French toast?  On a weekend no less.  You can't send a staff member to Albertsons to buy some syrup?  Horrible management skills if you can't pivot in a panic??

I guess since they are out of syrup now, eggs will be next since everyone is forced to give up their carb habits....."}
{"text":"This is a good little place for a pick me up while exploring Downtown Summerlin. My girlfriends got coffees and we all tried a few treats. Ms. G got a pumpkin bar (she shared a bite and it was nice). Ms. W got a lemon poppyseed muffin. And I got two macarons - one pistachio and one salted caramel. The pistachio was good and caramel was fantastic!"}
{"text":"My friend and I recently came here for brunch on a Sunday around 1pm. The place was pretty packed, but we were able to score a table in under ten mins. The parking situation is a bit rough like all downtown spots can be, but at least it's free street parking on Sundays.

There menu had a mix of tasty breakfast and lunch options. They also had some vegan and vegetarian friendly options which was nice for my vegetarian friend. I decided to go with the BLTAE, a BLT sandwich with added avocado, egg and a delicious pesto sauce. It was so good! The portion size was huge too, I had enough leftover for a take home box. I also opted for a mimosa too, $6 each or they offer $20 for bottomless. 

My only reason for a 4 star rather than a 5 would be the slowness in service. I understood it was busy, but it wasn't too huge of a location for the time lags to be so long. Regardless I'd definitely come back here again. Great food and good vibes!"}
{"text":"I came to Vegas with my BFF and wanted some good breakfast. So I went on yelp and found this place. The location is off the strip which I liked and parking was easy. 
The place felt cozy and as if we were in nor cal at a health nut place. But actually it was the opposite to healthy. The food was good and well priced. Not too big on the donuts they sell. They were hard and tasted like cardboard.. But on the other hand juice was on point, coffee was good. 
Me and the \"BFF\"will come back again or I will when I'm in the area.."}
{"text":"A restaurant doesn't have to be absolutely perfect to get 5 stars. MTO Cafe is a great example of a place with very stellar elements of everything to make it a truly exceptional restaurant. 

The location is right across the street from LV City Hall. The atmosphere is retro classic. Food is absolutely superb(two words: Mash. Browns.) And do you like alcohol? How about a bottomless mimosa? 

Brunch food and a bar = my new favorite place. They're only open from 8am - 2pm, so get in early and enjoy the comforts of a relax environment and excellent food.

And if you check in you get a free cookie!(Do it. The cookie is bomb)"}
{"text":"If you like awesome food with good music and great customer service this is the place to go! I love there food and the French onion soup and the artwork on the walls. Our waiter was supper funny!!    I like that they have wall chargers at the booths and the free cookie for checking in here also! They have 2 homemade juice drinks a red and green one that are awesome!"}
{"text":"I enjoy having breakfast here once in a while. They have plenty of healthy options. I usually go for the vegan pancakes with carrots, pecans, and agave syrup, along with the veggie hash with egg whites. The veggie hash is served in a skillet. Both are excellent. I also like the MTO break feast with egg whites, chicken sausage, turkey bacon, potatoes, and whole wheat toast. You definitely won't be disappointed with your meal.

The only complaint I have is the patio tables. I would enjoy dining on the patio, but most of the tables are wobbly and ready to topple over as soon as you place something on them. I am shocked that the manager would allow customers to sit at those tables. That issue needs to be addressed a.s.a.p."}
{"text":"I had a meeting today and decided to come here for breakfast. Today, I ordered the tomato basil soup (comes with half a grilled cheese sandwich) and wow... I devoured it. The tomato basil soup was creamy and slightly tangy and I couldn't put down my spoon. Of course, I had to dip my grilled cheese in the soup, which satisfied my taste buds. This meal was exactly what I craved. The place was pretty busy in the morning since most stores aren't open till around 11am. From the moment I came in until I left, the customer service was great. The cashier greeted me and made sure I wasn't pressured about ordering fast (they have a big menu that takes a minute to choose from). I think while I was there, the waitress asked me about 3 times how the food was, if I needed anything, or to take any plates out of the way. This is the customer service that every restaurant needs. 

However, the only thing I didn't enjoy was the cost. My tomato basil soup cost $7 for a bowl that wasn't really big. I would expect more for spending almost $10 on soup. I don't know if I'd come back on a weekly basis, but it's a good place to eat at Downtown Summerlin in the morning. 

Also, don't forget to check in so you can redeem yourself a free chocolate chip cookie!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. Food was fresh and awesome. Perfect portion size. Owner stopped by to check on us as well as the chef."}
{"text":"Rachel is an awesome server!  Enjoyed the Kentucky Fried Chicken. Need to update the hours. It closes at 2pm, not 3pm."}
{"text":"So glad to have an MTO Cafè approx. 10 minutes away!

Ambiance: The weather today was perfect for outdoor seating! ...But even if one chose to sit indoors, there is still plenty of natural light and they aren't blasting discourteous music (these are two factors I will always appreciate in any dining setting). The interior is trendy--that mod-retro feel with industrial accents. There are plenty of warm hues to make you feel hungry!

Service: What a friendly staff; they're always up to speed. When a customer leaves, the table is cleared within seconds. Everyone smiles--this is a good sign!

Food: You peruse the menu and order up front, are given a number and, then, you seat yourself. Orders come out of the kitchen pretty quickly and a majority of the menu items are a hit! I definitely appreciate the thought put into these flavor profiles. I recommend the KFC and the Philly. I urge everyone not to just eat the food, but to taste it.

MTO Cafè is an excellent addition to this neck of the woods."}
{"text":"Oh Goddamn. This place is the best place in Vegas for breakfast. Do you like alcohol? Check. Do you like good food? Check. Do you want to try the beautiful invention that is mash browns? Check. Do you like freedom? Gottdamn muthafuckin check. 

I can't even say how amazing the food is, but the bottomless mimosas flowing keep everything moving in the right direction. Sherolyn kept us going and was an awesome person. Tip your waitress 30%."}
{"text":"The food and staff at this place is fantastic!  

The reason for my 4 stars (and I'd only take off 1/2 a star if Yelp allowed me) is the parking situation.  On the weekends, it is $3 to park in the garage (EVERYWHERE around is pay for parking) and MTO validates- however, they only validate $1.50.  Well its not a lot of money, it is the principle of the matter to me.  I am going to a restaurant and spending money, why validate if you are only going to validate half?

So while the food, service and ambiance are all great- this little detail annoys me and will probably stop me from going back... unless they start validating the full $3 on the weekends.  Just doesn't make sense to me."}
{"text":"Jocelyne is the greatest. On the real her service was exceptional. She was able to give us recommendations for some menu items we were torn in between."}
{"text":"Definitely my new go-to brunch spot and a hidden gem in Downtown Summerlin. Everyone there is so sweet and smiling. Alyson recommended me the avocado skillet and it was amazing! Love the mash browns that go with it. I would recommend going on a weekday since they get pretty busy on the weekends. Either way, great service and delicious food!"}
{"text":"Pros:
-Good portions
-Friendly staff
-Parking outside the store if your lucky
-Cream in their hash was a little surprise 



Cons:
-Tip jar up front and no way to tip when you pay with card! (I never have cash -_- )"}
{"text":"We enjoy the food here. Interesting menu, some healthier options. One negative is sometimes their silverware doesn't seem very clean (you grab them yourself from baskets by the register). Has nice outdoor seating and also indoor. Love the BBQ chicken bowl!"}
{"text":"MTO cafe is one of the new additions to the Summerlin mall. This is a small cozy cafe. The food is good and the ingredients are very fresh. We ordered the Turkey Melt and the Hero Sandwich. They were very good, I'm not sure which one was better. The bread was soft and crunchy and the portion size was very good. I'm not sure if the value is there though. We end up paying $30 bucks for two sandwiches which seems a bit more than your average cafe. You have the option to change your fries for salad or fruit at an additional price. I guess there is not much of an encouragement to pick healthy options. I got the simple salad and that is exactly what I got, a simple salad. Lettuce, one sun dried tomato and balsamic vinaigrette. The vinaigrette was good, but nothing crazy to it. 
I felt the cafe offered a lot more breakfast options than lunch. A lot of the dishes had eggs, which made the selection a little bit more difficult! 
Overall, a decent cafe if you want a salad or sandwich."}
{"text":"Christine is very pleasant and kind! She was super friendly and patient as my mom and I were trying to decide what to get. The other employees are also very pleasant and courteous. The food was fresh and flavorful. I love that they use organic chicken. Definitely a bonus. Great atmosphere and great location!"}
{"text":"Came here with my grandma for lunch! Ordered their blt that comes with avocado, the tomato basil soup which comes with a grilled cheese basically (they just call it cheese toast since it's regular bread) and a huge Cobb salad. Ate my food without taking a picture because I couldn't wait to dig in. I still have 3/4 of my salad left. Their portions are BIG.  It's the kind of place you order and then sit down and wait for food. It has upbeat music and the staff is super friendly. My only complaint is they were out of Dr Pepper which I'm addicted too lol they have one of those cool touch screen soda fountains and I didn't even know there were so many types of sprite. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great vegetarian options at affordable prices. The waiter was very accommodating and we did not feel rushed as this turned into a 3 hour brunch with bottomless drinks."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot close to DT. So happy to find something vegan within walking distance of our hotel!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were visiting Las Vegas and wanted to get away from the Strip and eat breakfast in downtown. We saw the MTO Cafe on Yelp and decided to check it out.

The restaurant was not crowded (as it was a weekday) and the service was great. We were in and out in less than 40 minutes. The inside of the cafe was airy and illuminated by plenty of sunlight. 

I ordered the Kentucky Fried Chicken breakfast with scrambled eggs and my wife ordered the Body Builder omelet. We really liked that the menu had a mix of healthy and unhealthy options. 

The presentation of both dishes left much to be desired. However, they both tasted great! By stacking all parts of the meal on top of each other, they were definitely encouraging me to mix all of the items together. The chicken was juicy on the inside and had a crunchy, well seasoned exterior. The gravy was slightly sweet but still complemented the chicken well. 

The Body Builder omelet was even better. I have not seen this particular combination of ingredients for an omelet before, but they all worked together well. 

Overall, the food and service were great and the prices are far better than anything you'll see on the Strip. If you are visiting Las Vegas, it is worth the Uber ride if you want a satisfying breakfast/brunch."}
{"text":"MTO Cafe is the hot off the press restaurant that recently opened its doors in Las Vegas's hot new shopping destination: Downtown Summerlin. After hanging out in Sabalatte, my brother and I decided to drive to Downtown Summerlin to experience MTO Cafe. 

  MTO Cafe is in the northern reaches of Downtown Summerlin. Two sides of the cafe give the gift of interesting views of the Downtown. The east-facing windows overlook the pocket park known as the Arroyo. The south-facing windows overlook Park Centre Drive. In daylight the Arroyo-facing seats are the prime seats. At nighttime, the Park Centre Drive-facing seats are the prime seats. From this angle the changing colors of the landmark office building put you in the heart of downtown Summerlin. 

The Daniel. S-pectation:

    I expected to pay a higher price than I normally would off the Strip. I expected a full service restaurant. 

The Daniel. S Report of his MTO Cafe experience:

    My brother and I walked into a restaurant that is more similar to Five Guys (also in Downtown Summerlin). You order and pay for your food. The cashier gives you a number to place on your table with a plastic beverage cup. When the food is ready, they bring it to your table. On the way to the table is a freestyle Coke machine with over 100 flavors to choose from. 

  When we walked inside, a friendly cashier greeted us. I was still undecided. The deal is there is only one burger to choose from. It is their Hangover Burger. Hmm! Should I order the burger or the ruben. The Hangover Burger includes an 8 ounce triple angus with bacon, fried egg, Tillamook cheddar, lettuce, special sauce and fries on the side ($13). I was so not up to a fried egg with the burger. \"Could I order mushrooms in place of the fried egg?,\" I asked the friendly cashier. She communicated this with her supervisor (believe he is the owner). The answer was, \"yes.\" My brother wasn't really gung-ho over a fried egg over the burger. They likewise bestowed his request. 

   The delay time between ordering and seeing the food was short and enjoyable. My eyes took in the nighttime streetscape of Downtown Summerlin with the changing colors of the landmark office building. Looking up my eyes saw the game playing on the TV Between conversations with my brother, my ears took in the dance mixes featuring the late Michael Jackson. 

  When they placed the food on the table, I did the Yelper ceremony of photographing my food. This picture shows a patty with a lot of lettuce alongside skinny fries with a cow dispenser in the background. The picture failed to capture the juicy angus beef, mushrooms, Tillamook cheddar cheese, mushrooms, and bacon. My sense of taste appreciated the flavorful burger where it was indifferent to the ordinary skinny fries. 

  My brother wasn't the only friendly person in my company. The friendly staff would consistently checkup on us. The Manager or Owner also checked up on us. Kudos to the flavorful customer service at MTO Cafe. 

  MTO Cafe is in a downtown that appears to shutdown between 9 and 10 pm on a Saturday night in the Holidays season. My brother and I were here up to the time that that they closed at 9 pm. 

The Daniel. S  No-Spin Zone:

    I walked away from my MTO Experience giving it a grade if 80% (3 stars). Here are my constructive criticism points. The price is to high for what you get. The Hangover Burger with fries is $13. You can make an argument on the quality of the angus beef. Taste wise it failed to exceed Smash Burger, Five Guys, and many of the establishments competing for the Burger dollar. With my $13 Hangover Burger, I ordered a beverage that brought the bill to $17.30. The difference brings a plastic cup of Coke to near $4. Just a little overpriced. For $17.30, there are far better deals than a restaurant that isn't truly full service. Diner at New York Chinese Restaurant is $6 less. A soup, sandwich, and beverage at Cafe Zupas is $6.30 less. The seafood combo at L&L Barbecue is approximately $4.50 less. I could go on and on. Another constructive criticism talking point is that the one burger they offer should be a selection of toppings that the customer chooses. A fried egg on the burger is unappealing for far too many taste buds.

The Exit:

  I returned to the nighttime sidewalks of Downtown Summerlin with a positive impression of MTO Cafe's customer service, views of Downtown Summerlin, and Hangover Burger. At the same time I had a feeling that MTO Cafe might be a rare experience. From my experiences shared in reviews, $17.30 pays for more rewarding dining experiences."}
{"text":"Modern interior with simple but elegant Decors.
Great place for brunch/breakfast very soothing as a hangover meal.

We got BOTTOMLESS MIMOSA $20/person, the waitress never stopped refilling it. French toast were good with enough coating. 

My favorite: Kentucky fried chicken! The chicken had a light layer of coating with juicy tender chicken inside. You could sub your harsh brown with any side with no additional charge. The gravy though was very interesting, not overpowering with a little bit of sweetness. It is definitely different than usual white gravy but very tasty with the chicken. If I would you, I would order it on the side so the fried chicken will not be soaked.

Overall, I highly recommend this place who doesn't have a lot of budget for high end dining but still has decent quality of food. Per person costs from $10-$25. Not bad.

Oh, I love their music selections!"}
{"text":"MTO's 'Kentucky Fried Chicken' is lounging comfortably in my satisfied tummy. I write this review in loving memory of it and the gorgeous experience I am savoring on a cold Vegas morning, in this warm, badass, and unpretentious cafe.

5   S T A R S

* DELICATE & DEEEEELISH 
:::: Kentucky Fried Chicken: They had me at \"KFC\". The name grabbed my attention immediately--brilliant. Is this the original, original recipe the Colonel intended--perhaps the 'director's cut' of chicken breast? Silky eggs laid on a crispy, breaded and pleasurably moist breast. Delicate gravy, tasting of sweet southern roux poured over the top. Yummy, yum, yum 'Mash Browns' hidden underneath to surprise me. \"Wha, good mornin' spuds!\" The whole dish crafted with loving subtlety, the volume just perfect, like tucking in Goldilocks. MTO, you have my gratitude.
:::: Hangover Burger: Decent, and HUGE. The bacon was incredible, shoestring fries stellar, but all that protein was really heavy in the tummy. Be warned--it's the only thing I needed to eat for 7 hours.

* AN ANTIDOTE TO LONELINESS
You ever feel lonely in Vegas? Giant sky, big buildings separated by lakes of space filled with roaming crowds of random party people. For me, these new experiences are a welcomed blast but without my wife there's a melancholy lurking. Maybe that tinge is part of why we booze and party to excess in LV. Well, what I just ate has healed my lonely heart. I'll def be back tomorrow when the isolation resumes :)

* ATTENTIVE SERVICE
Very nice dudes checking in on me often and letting me take my time to write this review!

* GREAT MUSIC / COMFORTABLE SETTING
Louis Armstrong's horn. 2000s Rock with subtle cowbell. All tunes upbeat and go perfectly with the coffee and the subtly-more-hip-than-your-average-diner setting.

* EASY & UNPRETENTIOUS
The biggest surprise of my Las Vegas restaurant experiences thus far is the rare combination of fine quality and the lack of pretension. That subtle Vegas unpretentious ease is present here at MTO in the caramel vinyl seats, the not-overdone lighting fixtures, the easy attitudes of the staff, and the comfortable body language of the Average-Jill-and-Joe patrons. 

Being from Oakland and SF, I've always had to choose between lack of pretension or fine quality. It's a real delight, therefore, to experience them mingled together in the same place."}
{"text":"I visited from out of town this weekend, and my local friend brought me here for a relaxing Sunday morning breakfast.  This place is really cute and perfect for a Sunday breakfast in your pajama pants type of mood.  

Our server was excellent.  He stopped by probably 4-5 times to check on us and make sure we were all good.  Super nice young guy.  He made us The Hulk smoothie and a super soy milk steamer with vanilla.  Loved it! 

My friend ordered the \"Body Builder\" omelet and raved about it.  It looked really chock full of fresh veggies!   I ordered the Vegan Carrot, Coconut, and Pecan pancakes.   YUM!  They were very good.  I was expecting the carrots and coconut to be inside the batter, but they are used for toppings.  They also had a Vegan Falafel wrap that sounded good too, but I did not try that (darn it).  

Very nice ambiance, service, food presentation,and flavor."}
{"text":"REALLY creative menu!   

I stopped by MTO cafe a few weeks ago when the b/f and I were feeling like a trendy brunch spot.  The menu is awesome - really innovative food combinations and a nice offering for different dietary needs.  

Oddly, I had a steak salad for brunch.  (Don't judge me...brunch means breakfast AND lunch people.)  The steak was awesome - and so was the coffee.  The b/f had The Fat Elvis - some concoction of banana, nutella, peanut butter and carb-loaded goodness.  It looked incredible and from the empty plate he left, I suspect he thought so too.

Two OJ's, a coffee, 2 breakfasts, and a side of fruit DID really hike the cost up though - I think it was like fifty something dollars for brekkie.  Not a cheap spot, but worth it for the ambience, the quality of food, and creativity of the menu."}
{"text":"It's been a very long time since I've had food that just doesn't do anything for me. There is no shtick, no wow, no pizzazz. Well, maybe the uncomfortable aftertaste that lingered longer than I'd like to admit. The service was ho-hum, not bad, not good or great. I guess you could say that there approach is food is fuel, not fun or enjoyable. I guess you could say the options in Vegas have left me jaded and this isn't going to hold up to the competition."}
{"text":"My favorite brunch place in Vegas! I make it a priority to stop at MTO Cafe every time I am in Vegas because it is just that good. And they have a free chocolate cookie with check-in offer which basically sealed the deal for me haha.

I've had the Lemon Poppyseed Pancakes, the Hangover Burger, the Chorizo Skillet, and the Chicken&Waffles, and I can only report back by saying that all of it was AMAZING. The Lemon Poppyseed Pancakes were fluffy and so good with their blueberry ginger compote. Definitely ask for extra of the compote! Everything in the Hangover Burger was just ON- from the runny egg to the medium rare patty to the bacon to the special sauce- it was truly perfection in the form of a burger. The Chorizo Skillet was also delicious with the layer of hash browns sizzling on the bottom of the skillet. The Chicken&Waffles were also solid- tender meat and yummy sauce in a waffle sandwich- what more can you ask for?

The second time I visited MTO, my party was offered free Fried Apple Rings instead of the cookies and boy oh boy were these dank. Seriously, these are a must! The batter was crispy on the outside yet fluffy in the inside and the cinnamon sugar icing was a no brainer. The attentive service and cute decor just makes this cafe even better. Definitely make this place a Vegas pitstop!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! They have the BEST bacon...it's like life changing it's so good.  Huge portions and great coffee...makes for a great breakfast."}
{"text":"This was my 1st time here. And I had a great experience.  Emily was my server and answered all my questions. And help me with the decision on getting a mto breakfast which was awesome.  Whoa! Thank you"}
{"text":"I called MTO on a Sunday morning to check for wait times, the girl who answered put me on hold and never picked up again. So we stopped in anyways and the place was being run by a bunch of teenagers. There were no adults working at all. I ordered a skillet and what I received seemed to be a butchered up omelette with no skillet and they served my toast with out butter. My boyfriend got the steak and eggs which seemed fine but they did not deliver his toast until he was practically finished. I don't think we will be coming back to the summerlin location... maybe the downtown location is your better option."}
{"text":"The restaurant was close to capacity the Sunday morning of our visit, but we were able to secure a table for 2 in the very chic dining room.  Chef/partner Johnny Church recently departed RX Boiler Room to open this restaurant that puts a spin on comfort food.   It has proven to be so popular that a 2nd location has or will soon be opening in Summerlin. 

My wife chose an order of lemon poppy seed pancakes with blueberry-ginger compote that no one short of Fat Albert could possibly finish in one sitting.  My avocado griddle -  eggs with tomatillo sauce, red onions, cilantro, poblano peppers and jack cheese over home fries was more than filling.  Hers was good, mine was nothing short of excellent."}
{"text":"Chicken in a Waffle ($13): Country gravy and fries. Great waffles and delicious fried chicken strips.

Hen House ($11): Wrap w/ lettuce, organic chicken, roasted tomato, avocado, Caesar dressing, tomato-basil tortilla, and fries.

The Bob ($12): Sandwich w/ organic chicken, arugula, roasted tomato, jack and cheddar, pecan honey mustard, grilled wheat bread, and fries.

Everything I've had is delicious and hearty without being heavy. The ingredients are fresh and the portions are perfect. It's good food that isn't too healthy (love my fries!) for an easy and fulfilling lunch. When the weather is nice, the patio is beautiful to dine."}
{"text":"I can see why this place gets busy, the food is pretty bomb! The place has a cozy feel going on even though it's busy. The menu is very easy to look through with the perfect amount of selections for anyone looking to eat some breakfast stuff, salads, wraps or burgers. The staff are very helpful and are willing to help get what you need.

My wife and I ordered the Hale Caesar with chicken, kids cheeseburger, and the hen house wrap. They were all very good. We also had the drink special of the day which was the Blueberry Pineapple lemonade, damn that was so good and refreshing, plus you can get free refills on that also."}
{"text":"First off this cafe is ADORABLE! The servers are wonderful (kind and on their game). The mimosas are FIRE! Soooo good, definitely get bottomless (although they are big helpings). The food is excellent! The frenchtoast is AMAZING and so is the avocado omelette and the rancheros omelette!
There is a ton of wonderful natural light in there (great for ambiance and also insta photos!). So fabulous!"}
{"text":"Went here for brunch with my friend it was around 1PM and there was a ton of people there. The atmospheres reminded me of a local cafe nothing too fancy. I ordered the vegan falafel and it was really good it definitely filled me up the only thing I didn't like was the it came with a side of greens I love greens but the wrap itself had greens already a different side would have been nicer. I would have ordered another side but the menus wasn't too detailed. They have alcoholic beverages bottomless mimosas for $20. Our server was very nice, she was attentive. I definitely would go again but they do not have too many vegan options only 2."}
{"text":"First time here, I'm trying the teriyaki turkey burger and lolu wings.  The wife is trying their honey walnut grilled cheese. 

MTO - made to order, so your order - take a number and wait.  Comes out as its finished so you may not get it all at once.

Turkey burger - pretty good, no flavor grenade, but if you like turkey burgers, you won't be disappointed by it. 

Wings - they advertise a ginger / franks red hot mix. Taste like standard wings , which I like - but nothing special if your looking for something new.

Grilled cheese - was awesome (I stole a bite), sweet, cheesy. I'd get this every time from now on. 

** in the dining arroyo in downtown summerlin shopping area. nice outdoor seating area."}
{"text":"Great food but a little foo foo, however could find some basic staples. Puny avocado served first time around but they brought more out as I asked. Bright Decour, strong coffee."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp and it didn't disappoint. Was hanging out on Fremont Street and looking for a good breakfast place. While it's not super close to Fremont St, it's worth the 10-minute walk. The food is fresh, delicious, and the service is wonderful. Hearty portions and very flavorful food made us very happy to find something that wasn't in a casino or a chain restaurant. While all I had were basic eggs over easy, the buttered sourdough was mouth-watering. Pancake was just okay to be honest, but my hubby had the daily special (double sausage, double egg and cheese) and he was very happy!"}
{"text":"Had an amazing breakfast here. The fried apple rings, chicken and waffles, and mini donuts with local honey were all outstanding. Hangover burger was also excellent and service was fantastic. Coffee was also exceptional."}
{"text":"Decided to try after reading the fantastic reviews. First off plan on parking in the city garage next to the restaurant and yes the restaurant will validate. This is a very modern and clean restaurant with great service. Now on to the food, I ordered the fried chicken and eggs breakfast. It comes as a plate of hashbrowns with a country gravy on top then topped with boneless fried chicken and your choice of eggs and priced at about $13.00.  The chicken was very bland with the exception of an overwhelming note of cinnamon. Hash browns were the same as any diner probably frozen shredded russets. The country gravy could not over power the cinnamon so I had to turn to standard table condiments of ketchup and copious amounts of Cholula hot sauce to finally unbind this pile to a consistency and moisture level that worked. If you're on the prowl for cheap eats, look elsewhere. If you like a very nice clean modern environment this may be worth a go. 
With so many choices when I visit Vegas this will probably not be on my return list."}
{"text":"This place makes a great breakfast. Everything we had was on point. Steak and eggs cooked to order perfectly. Great coffee and Bloody Mary's. The standout is definitely the five cheese Mac N Cheese. Rarely do I have a meal where everything is so right."}
{"text":"I had the chicken and waffles. The waffle was done up right crispy shell and soft center. The chicken crunchy, juicy, and flavorful. It is served with a gravy that doesn't overwhelm the dish. The smashbrowns (hash brown and mashed potato I assume) were alright. Overall delicious and priced right. The service was excellent, they also gave our daughters a plate of their fries apples which was very considerate of them, and might I add I will be coming back for those as well as the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"The breakfast was so yummy! The service was great. I can't believe they have been open only 2 months. The menu has some creative and tasty options. I'm soooooo glad we got off the strip. This was our first lunch in Vegas meant for foodies."}
{"text":"This place is a must try in Vegas!  It's super close to the strip and tastes delicious. We got the lemon seed pancakes, Fat Elvis French toast, hash browns, eggs, and chicken sausage.  Everything was amazing!  You can taste the high quality in the food and it's uniqueness!  Definitely recommend to anyone who wants a good breakfast or lunch!  The customer service here is outstanding too, the hostess (we came on a Sunday morning at 12) was really energetic and friendly while the waiter, Ryan, was great at recommendations and fun to talk to!  Awesome experience with flavorful food!  Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Placed an order for delivery online, after waiting about an hour followed up with the restaurant and was told the food would be delivered soon. Another hour passes and still nothing, when I followed up with the restaurant again I was told that no deliveries would be done today and they could not complete the order.

Waited two hours for nothing and was not contacted by the restaurant at any point to let me know they would not be completing my order."}
{"text":"I think some of the Vegas people are a little liberal with their 4 and 5 stars - it must be the mimosas here; this place is cool but don't expect it to be the best thing you've ever been to. It's smallish so there will likely be a wait. The food selection is somewhat interesting but not anything unique or special. 

The server was really nice but a little overworked. He kept forgetting the things we would ask for and was extremely apologetic but still lacking. Most of the staff was running around with their heads cut off and waiting 30-60 min for the kitchen to get their food out. Maybe some operations guy could give them some efficiency tips? It just seemed like they were working way to hard for the output levels."}
{"text":"Great breakfast. We had the MTO breakfast and it was enough for 2 people. Everything was yummy...even the Spam! Yes, I said Spam. Don't knock it until you try it."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to come here for a while. The 20$ bottomless mimosas were awesome. The main reason I am writing this review is for our server Rachel. She was absolutely amazing. She had so much personality! I have worked food and beverage for a very long time as a server on the strip and she really impressed me. The entire staff was also good even BOH. 

The food was delicious as well. I will definitely be returning. If you go, ask for Rachel's section she will give you a wonderful dining experience."}
{"text":"Lemon poppyseed pancakes were good.  Kentucky fried chicken ok, pretty dry.  Salt and pepper fries yum. My son had the cheeseburger it was ok.  Overall good but I would like to give it another try since the menu is full of things that sound so good and hopefully it will be more impressive next time."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here on a Sunday around 1pm and it was pretty crowded but we only waited about 10 min to be seated. The mimosas were amazing and the food was even better! I ordered the B.L.T.A.E and it was one of the best sandwiches I've ever had will definitely be back"}
{"text":"The staff was very friendly and attentive and the food was great! I will definitely be going back the next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Sooooooo Goood!!! Everything is Delicious!!! Come with an appetite! Awesome customers service!! The Fried apple rings are soooo good, definitely a must on every visit! The cookies are nice and warm, just how I like them."}
{"text":"Okie let me open this review by saying: I LOVE MTO cafe DOWNTOWN! I was super excited to try things out at this location but unfortunately it didn't make my expectations. The menu was the same but when delivered the food look extravagant which I liked! The restaurant just had a different feel compared to the other one. Which I could appreciate and like. Plus it provided me with an amazing picture of my meal!  

Okie. But here is the reason this is a one star review I had a beautiful B.L.T.A.E and it was yummy and little hard to eat but yummy! As I took a bite there was a bread tag in my sandwich. I thought it was maybe a hard piece of bacon so I chewed very hard and even tried to swallow it. I was with friends and I didn't wanna embarrass myself but after a while I couldn't and ended up spitting it out. Thank god I did! I mean a bread tag (pictures will be provide just in case). The upsetting thing is when I showed it to the staff they said and did nothing about it. They just said we will be careful with the other meals prepared .....ok......"}
{"text":"Wonderful food and exceptional service! 
We didn't know what to order so our waitress, Rachel, suggested the KFC. She also offered to dump my coffee and start fresh since it was cold. What!! Never had anyone offer to do that! 
And..... Mimosas? Oh ya... 
Definitely a new fav breakfast place."}
{"text":"It's refreshing to finally find an eatery that reminds me of home. MTO is conveniently located and it is easy for parking. I haven't been able to find a cafe that is warm, inviting, and perfectly priced. The food here was phenomenal, I particularly enjoyed the broccoli omelet along with the mashed potato hash browns....the fresh menu and selections were difficult to choose from and there wasn't anything we ordered that was not great. I would definitely recommend this place for all settings, the staff was warm and friendly, and the service is inviting."}
{"text":"The hen house wrap with smash Browns instead of fries is all I need from this place.  Bomb."}
{"text":"MTO Cafe never disappoints! One of my favorite dishes has to be the KFC. Can't go wrong with county gravy, chicken and eggs! 
What always has me coming back is the service. I'm always greeted with smiles as soon as I walk in. One of the servers Alison is always there to make sure all my needs are catered to!"}
{"text":"Every trip we've made to Vegas we have breakfast here at least once. Food is amazing, staff are super friendly & will stop here every chance we get. I recommend any & everything on the menu"}
{"text":"You know when you go somewhere new and your expectations are really high and then you're let down? Yeah, well that won't happen here! This place  is really cute, well decorated and full of light. Been here twice now and the food never disappoints! Bacon cooked inside my pancakes... You can't go wrong with anything bacon! I saw a guy eating the chicken INSIDE a waffle... It looked amazing, will definitely try that next time. 

Ok, the most important part to me... The service. From the moment we were seated they make you feel like you are the only person in there. Amanda and Steve were our servers, I love sweet people! Amanda was just about the most adorable thing! Always making sure our drinks were full and making sure we didn't need anything. Steve was on point, made sure our food was perfect and we were happy. 

So we wanted to let them know we enjoyed our food and especially the service, Donna, the new GM came by and chatted with us. She was so sweet and you can tell she really cares about the service in her place. Then they bring over a plate of Apple Rings to thank us for our feedback... Have you ever tried heaven on a plate? It was really nice of her and we devoured them. 

It's a great place, great food and excellent service! Love it and will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I checked this place out with a business client of mine the other day after seeing the various yelp reviews about it. The interior design is very cool inside and welcoming. Staff is friendly and engaging. They have outlets at the booths that are convenient for laptops and getting work done.

Food: My friend had the MTO breakfast platter. According to him it was good. Bacon was cooked perfectly. Although for the price, I was expecting a larger portion size. I got the chicken in a waffle dish. It was good, but I wasn't in love with it. Once again price was a little steep for what you get. There's a lot of great breakfast places in town where the food is spectacular, the portions are large, and the price is cheaper. 

On a side note there Mashed potato Hash browns are really really good and unique. Unfortunately I found a piece of hair in them......... Being the person that I am I didn't say anything to the waitress as I could tell she was new and didn't want to give her a rough time.

Overall, place is nice, food is a little over priced. Food quality not bad.

Idk if I would come back here again."}
{"text":"Best light non greasy breakfast ever. Ordered the veggie hash and carrot pancake. Delicious and everyone there is super friendly. I would love to have your nutritional facts for people counting calories."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Great Mac n' cheese! Love the bottomless mimosas!!! Thanks Jennine!"}
{"text":"So I have been here 2 times. And both times I had to send my food back. Food comes out at inconsistent times from the kitchen and sits on the expo table. So I was left with cold food while my girlfriend had a hot meal. The only reason for 2 stars is the service was good. I gave this place a second chance. But there won't be a third."}
{"text":"Rachel is the best server ever! The food recommended was amazing and she made the whole experience extrodinary. Try the chicken and waffles or the hangover burger :) we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Nice little cafe inside the Downtown Summerlin mall. The food here is good with a lot of healthy options, while you're out & about. I've been here a couple times & tried their burger, sandwich & soups. Everything I've had here so far has been good. The price is decent for being in a mall location. Sometimes the cafe can get a little busy, so seating can be a hassle but overall it's a good cafe to check out."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend because he looked it up on yelp. We came here for breakfast. And the food was great! I ordered the waffles & chicken sausage & the green drink.  Great tasting food. Very nice waitress. It kind of reminded me of a Northern Cali restaurant or a Silver Lake place. Cozy, healthy delicious food, I think the pricing was decent since its good quality.  

The next time I go to Vegas I'll definitely go back!

There is a parking structure, but there are a few free spaces for the cafe. But they do provide validation."}
{"text":"Avocado omelette over a bed of has browns is amazing! Service here is great as well as the ambiance. I will definitely be back to try more items on the menu."}
{"text":"Nice place, trendy, great mimosas, great place after a vegas hangover!"}
{"text":"Have not been here in a while. Last few times I ate here it was good. Wish i could say the same about this visit. First off the cashier was friendly, like phoney friendly. I ordered a patty melt medium well with fries and a fountain drink. So , seriously the music is so loud I can't even speak on the phone,so I go outside to make the call I came back in and enough was enough I went to the front and asked her to turn it down,the acoustics are very bad and just made it worse. After she turned it down a few if the customers thanked me. I get my food. What a disgusting mess.  The sandwhich was slathered in 1000 island dressing,the toast was greasy. And the fries were a train wreck. I went up to complain and this kid server says to me. That's the way they are made,really? Overly cooked to the point that there is no fry but a fried shell? Ugh,sorry not acceptable, please replace them with hashbrown..then she just walks away I say I don't want them she said it's ok you can keep them, she walks away and I grab a knife and I have to wipe them off my plate into the garbage. Replace means take my plate you moron and replace them. She then brings me out the hash browns totally disgusting overly cooked and nasty greasy taste. I asked for the burger medium well..it came out medium rare and the meat made me want to hurl. All this abuse for 18 dollars. You know what I'm getting sick of shitty crappy over priced garbage and stupid young ditzy kids serving it. This place is a big fat zero. Stop overcharging for horrible food and service,it's bs."}
{"text":"Very friendly, welcoming place - both wait staff and owners! Was looking for a good breakfast place away from the Strip and we found it. Berry waffles for me, and omelet for the husband. Good coffee too."}
{"text":"I've tried many grilled cheese and tomato soups and I feel that this is one of my favorites! It's soooo good. However I feel their iced coffee can taste a little bland so it's not my favorite. The service is great as well."}
{"text":"Quick breakfast pitstop after arriving in Vegas this morning. Searched for 'organic breakfast' (as per friend's request) and this popped up first, so we plugged it into Google maps and headed over. Parked in the garage nearby, and walked in. Grabbed some coffee (comes in a bowl ,lol) and ordered the Bodybuilder omelet and fresh fruit. Enjoyed sipping a great coffee while my breakfast was brought out quickly. Our waiter was attentive, and when we were preparing to checkout the place started getting busy  (Perhaps the reason the request for a free cookie as per Yelp check-in was looked over- no biggie.) Got $1.50 off parking in the garage which was neat.

Overall not a bad place, would be a good idea to stop by to break that fast. ;-)"}
{"text":"This place has a super cool atmosphere  and the food was incredible!! We ordered the MTO breakfast with a pancake. It was a perfect way to start our Saturday. This place is a little ways off the strip but definitely worth the drive!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast, great staff always going above and beyond to make sure you have a good time. All meals are amazing. Highly recommended. Get there early."}
{"text":"I had the Avacado omelet style! It was amazing. The service was excellent and will definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"OMG!!!! Holy holy fried Apple slices  lunch was terrific I had the Bob and my Honey had the the Hero both sandwiches were delicious and the chicken was fresh and \"clean\".  Staff was friendly and fast, great good great service great atmosphere- will definitely be back!!! Yummy"}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped here for lunch on our way out of town after a weekend in Vegas. It was the perfect spot away from the craziness of the strip to grab a bite on the way home. 

Great comfort food (hits the spot when you're slightly hungover) and really cute environment. They even validate parking and we took advantage of the free chocolate chip cookie if you check in on Yelp. 

Both of our meals were great - I had the turkey melt and my friend ordered the B.L.T.A.E. 

Highly recommend and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best breakfast I've been in Las Vegas. The staff is so friendly and the atmosphere is so welcoming unlike some of the other places I've been. Ryan was an amazing and funny host and I would love to go back there for breakfast when I visit Vegas again !"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service! Donna is our favorite! If you haven't been you should go! There is not a single negative thing I would say about MTO downtown."}
{"text":"My husband and I frequent MTO. It's our favorite breakfast spot Downtown. Our go to dish is the Veggie Hash with Mashed Browns (a must try). The staff is always courteous and the food is always right on!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food!  I had the Kentucky Fried Chicken and we'd all be calling the Colonel the General had he come up with this.  It's  simple, delicious comfort food in a who'dathunkit combination and it's amazing.  I'm usually more of a chichi/fusion/healthy-ish eater and wouldn't order hash browns under fried chicken under country gravy, under two fried eggs.  I actually ordered the avocado omelette first but after seeing a pic of the KFC on here, walked over to our waiter and changed my order...and Oooh-Boy-Howdy, it was awesome!  My wife had the Hangover Burger and it too was delicious.  She could only eat half so I ate the rest a few hours later.  Bottomless mimosas rounded it all out for a great 50th b-day breakfast!  Service was great, too.  We'll definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"I haven't put a bite of food in my mouth yet but I rated this restaurant one star just because the cashier he took our order LITERALLY rolled her eyes the entire time my kids and I gave her our order. First and last time I eat here."}
{"text":"I was a tourist that needed a break from the smoky, unhealthy, mediocre restaurants a mile up.  THIS PLACE WAS REFRESHING! 

Just a few blocks from Fremont street was this gem. Atmosphere was on par and the servers were fast and friendly. 

I started with the MTO Juice while waiting on my food. It had a nice celery and apple taste. Sometime later my Avacado Skillet came and it did not disappoint. Fresh ingredients and flavorful. The hubby got the daily special and it was okay. 

Coffee was always filled and the free chocolate chip cookie was a great ending!"}
{"text":"Where do I start, this place is easily accessible and located downtown. I've been here twice now and I will be coming back again, and again. :). The food is great, the service is amazing. The first time I came, I had the chicken and waffles, and today I had the French toast. Easily some of the best food I've ever had. It's a nice little spot, Ally was our waitress today and she was super energetic and awesome to have. She made sure we were doing good, never left us hanging and was just an overall joy to be around. I definitely recommend this place for anyone looking for some great food and amazing service. I'm excited to come back and try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food and service. 

Specializing in breakfast and brunch, this establishment is sure to please. Their diverse offerings range from omelets to pancakes, sandwiches, salads and more.  

Their advertisement of \"comfort food\" is very fitting. You'll be served healthy portions with quality food that will be sure to leave you filing full. 

The food is also non-greasy and on the healthier side. That doesn't mean you can't enjoy a good meaty sandwich of fries. For the vegetarian diners, they also have some solid vegan options. The vegan falafel was my choice and it was excellent. 

Service was among the best I've experienced in Vegas or anywhere for that matter. Everyone on staff was very friendly and helpful. I highly recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"Delicious food, attentive servers, and nice atmosphere. Recommend the Kentucky breakfast! Not sure what we would find in Las Vegas, but happily surprised."}
{"text":"Great food but it's the calling syrup tree sap and the suggested gratuity on the receipt that really set this place apart. And Jocelyne kicks ass"}
{"text":"This is a casual place where you can get a quick breakfast or lunch. I've heard good things about this place and decided to give it a try. 

Food: 
1.Hangover burger (3/5): it was bland and burger was bit dry. Only delicious factor was the bacon. 

2.Chicken in a waffle(2/5): chicken was tasty but waffle was so soggy.

Overall, food was not the best but their bacon is quite delicious so I might come back and just get bacon and eggs."}
{"text":"Love it. Fresh. I always get the grilled cheese made with Brie, honey and walnuts. Very good light pancakes. I'm a local, I come out of my way to go downtown to eat at MTO. I also work down the street and get lunch there."}
{"text":"Not much to say, the staff are friendly, food was standard quality for reasonable price.
Complaints- service was slow between order and receipt of order, tables outside are in need of refinishing.  Otherwise, not a bad place if you're not looking for fancy and don't want to be gross and hit up fast food."}
{"text":"The hash browns are TO DIE FOR! I loved this place. Everything was delish and also the service was great."}
{"text":"Clean interior. 
Good service.
Terrible food presentation (and dare I say: choices)

My mistake wasn't coming here to eat. It was being confident enough to order the Huevos Rancheros. It was such a tasteless and unappealing dish. I thought I was going to get a homemade breakfast, but I got generic \"Mexican\" under two hard Guerrero tortillas. It was just too lazy.
The Veggie skillet was a little better. The canned button mushrooms.. not so much. 

I expected more from this trendy cafe.

I may or may not go back. Perhaps a sandwich next time."}
{"text":"No one wants to start their day with bad coffee . . . Bad coffee is the surest way to make a bad impression on a customer. I arrived at MTO and was greeted with watered down coffee. I mean literally I drank hot water with a coffee color. No amount of cream and sugar can fix this. 

Nonetheless, I waited patiently for my Made To Order chicken breakfast tacos.  Chicken, egg, red and green peppers, onions, a hint of queso on corn tortillas (x3) with red and green sauce. The chicken was dry and bland. The eggs appear to have been browned as an omelette then chopped to fill the tacos. The peppers gave it a mild kick. The salsas didn't help much either. The salsa added a little acidity but no heat.

I'd like to say the service made it all worth it, but this day the front counter was staffed by two young kids who seemed flustered and disorganized. To their credit, they tried really hard.  I don't see a reason to come back again. There are other options in Downtown Summerlin with a similar concept that do a better job providing a great dining experience."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! Went for brunch and I had the egg white broccoli skillet and it was delicious. My husband had a special that was deconstructed eggs Benedict that was equally tasty! Not only was the food good it fresh and healthy. Also got to meet the owner who was friendly, funny and gracious :-) I will definitely go back. I look forward to trying lunch and supporting a local business!"}
{"text":"Super yummy food. Great service.  Stands alone so a clean smoke free environment...hard to find in vegas. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Wow! I had the chef special: chorizo tacos and hash browns. Deep fried chocolate cookie for dessert. Everything was fresh, made with quality ingredients, and extra TLC. I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The staff here were relaxed in a good way and very friendly. You know, they seemed as though they actually like their jobs. The food selection was unique and everything sounded delicious, making it very hard for me to choose. I had the bacon pancake dippers and juevos rancheros, neither disappointed. There is parking right next door and while not the most happening area in the morning, it made for a nice, calm breakfast."}
{"text":"MTO! You're fantastic! Traveling from LA, we stayed in Aria on the strip, but I convinced my friends to brunch in downtown. Most of the other brunch places I called in DTLV had a 30-1 hr wait and I just wasn't down for that (Hash House A Go Go and eat.) Both of those places also didn't let us put our name down over the phone as we were traveling from the strip to downtown (first come first served). MTO had high reviews, but not many, so I assumed it was new and we took a chance and just showed up. Luckily, we came at a good time and only had about a 5-10 minute wait. 

First off, I have to applaud the service here. The server and the wait staff are excellent. They are so enthusiastic, helpful, honest, and provided some of the most warming service I've ever received. It wasn't phony or stagnant; it's so transparent here that the people love what they do! I have to give props to the chef as well; the menu is eclectic, interesting, varied, but comfortable and delicious! 

When asked for recommendations between the salmon skillet and the Kentucky Fried Chicken, our waitress quickly said to get the chicken, hands down. I love when the staff has an opinion on the food-- it helps out so much!

I ordered a coffee, which was bold and delicious! The dish came out pretty fast; it was beautiful; so colorful and it smelled amazing. The chicken is not for the faint of heart; it's heavy and hearty without being super greasy. Hash mash, fried chicken, country gravy, over-easy eggs; crazy combination, but it works out beautifully. Food was cooked to perfection (over-easy eggs were done RIGHT!) and everything was really tasty. We left stuffed and happy! 

I'll definitely be back when in town-- thanks for a great experience!"}
{"text":"A solid 4. 
Food was good, drinks were good, and outdoor seating on a beautiful day just makes for a great breakfast/lunch spot. 
I had the Kentucky fried chicken breakfast and my lady got the steak and eggs. 
We liked that you had to pay first instead of waiting on someone for the bill. 
We also had a restaurant feel, even though we paid first. 
My lady got the hulk and I had the mto juice. Both were great! 
The lattes were great. 
Service is amazing. 
I like this spot. 
#FirstTry"}
{"text":"$12.95 for a Fat Elvis that rather small in portion. Could have ordered the steak and eggs. Service was bad on this day. Got my Son's single stack pancake with lemon poppy seed topping wrong. Pancake was brought to us with carrot shavings and what look like nuts. Had to wait for the order while the food brought to us is getting cold. Very disappointed. Two cookies don't make up for bad service."}
{"text":"MTO is located near Fremont Street, just across from Las Vegas City Hall.  It's anchored under a large parking garage and there were tons of spots available when I went on a Saturday.  Parking is 0.75/30 minutes, but MTO will give you a stamp card for 1 hour.

The restaurant was full when we got there.  There was a part of 3 in front of us.  We were quoted a 15 minute wait but it ended up being close to 30 minutes.  Not exactly the staff's fault for people not leaving, but the staff wasn't exactly attentive enough to flip the tables that were done eating.

It took a good 10 minutes after being seated before our server got to take our order.  Then..we just waited some more.  I had the Kentucky Fried Chicken.  The food presentation was so so, with the egg in top falling apart.  The chicken was not bad, but definitely not something I would go back for.  However, the combination layers of egg, chicken, gravy, and hash browns were delicious.  

MTO's atmosphere is hip 20 year olds.  They have the music up really loud.  

Overall, the food was decent, service was mediocre, and the atmosphere was too cool for me."}
{"text":"I've dined at MTO cafe a number of times, none of which have been memorable, until this past Sunday when four friends and I stopped in for Sunday brunch. The service was inconsistent, extremely slow, and dissatisfactory. Four dishes came out before the fifth dish was delivered 15 minutes later. 

Flavors are okay, price point is fine too, but there are other eateries Downtown that offer superb service with quality eats."}
{"text":"Awesome lemon poppy pancakes and the kfc eggs breakfast really good. Server Ally took great with us even while it was packed. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Love this place...found it about a month ago and since have been here 3 times and I can't get enough... Kentucky fried chicken is amazing, ranch dressing is soooooo gooooodddd, and the mimosas are spot on...as soon as I leave I can't wait to come back"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and friendly staff.  I was greeted and seated promptly as the first customer of the day hahaha.  I ordered the Veggie Hash skillet with my eggs scrambled and a coffee.  The food and staff were outstanding.  Yelpers got this one right :) don't forget to get your parking validated.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Food is fantastic, staff is friendly, service is amazing! If you haven't come here yet, you're missing out!"}
{"text":"Beautiful location and wonderful food.  He had the boss sandwich and i had the bltea. Fast service.  Great prices.  Fresh made ranch sauce!"}
{"text":"Based on reviews we decided to try this restaurant for lunch today. Unfortunately, the Kentucky Fried Chicken breakfast meal that included a fried chicken patty on top of hash browns with gravy and topped with two eggs any style left much to be desired. The environment was noisy and really geared  to 20-something's. We would not go back."}
{"text":"I walked over from the World Market Center while waiting for carpet to be installed at my booth. Took about 10-15 mins and you can just walk straight across directly to it.

Say at the bar and got served straight away.

No grapefruit juice but they do have Blueberry ginger lemonade. Boom  start with that. Delicious. Next I checked in to grab a cookie on Yelp. It's coming at the end of the meal. Heated. 

And then the Huevos Rancheros came. Now I'm not going to bore you with a flowery description,so simply put they were amazing. 9/10 I would do it again. That other one time would be the pancakes I saw go by with full strips of bacon cooked right in. I'm going for that one next time.

Soon as I mopped up the skillet with my wheat bread toast, buttered and delicious. Without even asking my warm chocolate chip cookie appeared before me. Needless to say I ended up slamming that down and all its deliciousness. Restaurant was great. David super friendly staff. I made the whole experience better and just the food.

Bathrooms are also super clean. Yay for clean bathrooms."}
{"text":"I tried the Meze Platter, as I was not disappointed! Service was quick and friendly, and for a cafe, it was nice to have the owner Ben stop by the table. This is a great addition to Downtown Summerlin! I will be back, and can't wait to try more items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Busy little place, open only for breakfast and lunch.  The mashbrowns are fabulous with crispy bits of potato in them, although a bit on the greasy side.  Minor issue with our order but it was rectified quickly.  Bacon done well, brioche toast was amazing!!"}
{"text":"Cafe MTO was a nice surprise.  I was with a buddy staying on Freemont Street at the Golden Nugget and we got up late on a Sunday Morning.  He suggested a casino eatery for brunch. I told him we would never get to the betting windows before the 10am games began. A quick search of yelp yielded MTO Cafe.  

There was only a few people in the place at 8:30 AM.  We sat at the counter and both had Chicken and Waffles.  It was very good.  They used a country gravy and served the Chicken and Waffles like a sandwich.  Nice presentation, good food.   The gravy and the chicken could use a bit more seasoning, but overall it was a filling meal.

I noticed the staff prepared everything after it was ordered.  They were very busy filling \"to go\" and Uber food orders.  Obviously this place has a local following and is not relying on tourists. 

They have some alcohol and serve Coke products.  

If you are in a hurry you might find MTO cafe is a expeditious alternative to lines on the west end of the casino district.  Weekdays are likely a busy time with City hall across the street."}
{"text":"This place is great! I ordered an avocado skillet. It comes with what they call mash browns which were different but so delicious! The food tastes light and fresh. I didn't leave feeling like I wanted a nap, haha. I also ordered a mint infused pineapple juice. That was good! I am definitely coming back! We were served by Lisa. She was very friendly."}
{"text":"Friendly prompt service.  Good food for a new and developing location.  Great if you are looking for a quick bite that is on par with the price point."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, amazing service and phenomenal food! So glad we left the strip and came down here. I love it!"}
{"text":"Still a fan of MTO, but I had to write a quick update.  I frequently get their tomato soup and grilled cheese.  It's a great combo.  Found out today it is ONLY sold as a combo.  

Today I just order the tomato soup and when bill came was charged $7 for a cup of soup.  I asked waiter why it was same price as the combo and he said because it's ONLY sold as a combo.  Huh? Ok, no big deal, but wish he had told me this bit of info when I ordered. I guess I should've asked how much is JUST a cup of soup.  

The manager came over and asked if everything was ok, so I mentioned how I really enjoyed the soup, but didn't realize if I ordered only soup I'd be charged for full combo.  She simply parroted the server and said we only sell soup as a combo with grilled cheese.  

I get it! It's a COMBO!  Good deal for $7, super tasty, just don't; try ordering either item separately, or be prepared to pay for full cost of combo.  :-)"}
{"text":"MTO was so incredible. We got the fat Elvis, chicken and waffle, wings, blue burger, and the Mac and cheese. The establishment is so cute it's like a order and sit down restaurant like a Panera bread style. The food is soooooo good and huge portions for the price. It was only 60$ for all of our amazing food. I will be back!!! The staff were very helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"Went here with the wife. 

Was not very impressed with the food; however, the service was excellent. The staff were so friendly. They provided food recommendations and were so nice.

Three stars...only for the service.

I had the 'body builder'. It was ok... Nothing to write home about. Lacked the flavor and character I was expecting.

The location is a little out of the way, but if you're wanting to get away from the hustle and bustle of the strip, it's a good place to go.

I just wish the food was better here!!"}
{"text":"had a chicken sausage omelette and a side of apple fried rings. The apple fried rings were delicious, especially with a nice hot cup of coffee chicken sausage omelette wasn't very tasty, the amount of sausage was scarce--it just didn't impress. Limited menu. Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing...."}
{"text":"The food is fresh, heathy and amazing!! Coffee nice and strong. The atmosphere is casual with great music. Donna the general manager was great! She was very friendly, informative and just cool. We will definitely be coming back as regular customers."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried the out MTO Cafe!! It was soooo good!  Gotta try! Bottomless Mimosas to start was a good idea!  Apple cinnamon French toast and Patty Melt was our selection and what a good choice it was!  Delicious!  Josh was our server and he was personable and made recommendations which was appreciated!  Staff looked to be having fun which added positive vibes to our dining experience!  Must visit this place again!"}
{"text":"Well I was super excited about trying this place...but...
They have a lot of things with bacon although I do not eat bacon (since 1991)...what I ordered did not come with bacon but my order had bacon in it...
They took it back and told me I would have to wait 20 minutes for a \"wrap\", seriously??
No thanks...

Instantly I bad 1st experience!"}
{"text":"Let's start off by saying I did not enjoy my meal here but I can explain. That doesn't mean the place deserves a terrible rating either. After leaving 3 other restaurants that were closed for Easter Sunday I was a little annoyed. The hostess here is one of the friendliest hostesses I've come across. I didn't even mind waiting 15 minutes for a table even though I'm already running late. I heard about the green juice so I decided to give it a go. It's definitely different , but refreshing. My boyfriend suggested I order the chicken in a waffle. I should know myself already and know that I ordered something similar elsewhere and didn't enjoy it. me. Right after ordering it I wanted to change my order but I didn't want to be a bother. The chicken was partially breaded and way overdone and dry. The gravy was boring and waffles mediocre. The fruit on top was the only part I enjoyed. My boyfriend had the MTO breakfast. Can't go wrong with meat eggs and potatoes. We sat by the bar and watched them put the final touches and garnishes on the dishes and preparing drinks. Overall the decor is eclectic and atmosphere is laid back. Just because I didn't enjoy my dish doesn't mean I won't come back. I should have known I wouldn't like it as I've had chicken and waffles before elsewhere and didn't enjoy the combination. I should have went with the thanksgiving burger. Oh well next time."}
{"text":"Food was average but an odd menu, found a hard time finding something to order that sounded good. Did not like the ambience. Small uncomfortable tables."}
{"text":"So my chicken was extremely bland and tasted undercooked, same with my waffle. 

I'd say don't get their chicken and waffles because it's just not that good at all.

I thought maybe in Vegas they might have good hearty meals...

...turns out this place wasn't worth the gamble."}
{"text":"MTO did a great job catering a brunch for my wife's 40th Birthday. The food was excellent and they went out of their way to make sure all the details and delivery were perfect.  I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"We were craving some brunch food and found this gem with Yelp!

The cafe seemed new and nicely decorated with tables and booths. I noticed there were outlets at all the tables for people who were there with their laptops. Good place to study, read, eat for singles, couples or small groups.

[SERVICE]
The service was great. Our waitress was really friendly and did a great job and making recommendations and refilling our drinks.

[FOOD]
*Fried Apple Rings - Really tasty! Not too sweet, light, and fluffy!

*Chicken in a Waffle - Delicious! You get a nice piece of fried chicken, covered in gravy, topped with bacon, and served in between two waffles!

*Chorizo Skillet - Great for chorizo lovers! It had a really good flavor. The ratio of chorizo, egg and vegetables was perfect.

*Bacon Dippers - The way this was presented surprised us but basically looked like they made the pancakes with the strip of bacon in the middle. My friend enjoyed this dish and basically dipped his meal into a cup of syrup.

*Chocolate Chip Cookies - FREE with Yelp check-in! Score! Very tasty! They come out hot and fresh. The cookies were nice and soft. Great way to end the meal!

[PARKING]
There's a parking garage next door. It's about $0.75 per half hour. Just make sure you validate your ticket before you leave the cafe.

Overall, I would definitely come back and eat here. The wait wasn't too long, the service was great, and the food was delicious!"}
{"text":"Sweet, hip little joint. Great omelet! Beautiful & tasty pancakes... had the red velvet AND the lemon poppyseed with blueberry ginger compote. It was all delicious. GREAT SERVICE!!!! Ryan was a sweetheart and brought Texas hospitality to the table."}
{"text":"This cutely decorated cafe  is worth the short drive away from the Strip.  The food was prepared with fresh ingredients. I had the BLTAE that was tasty and delicious.  The fries are the bomb. Highly recommend MTO !!"}
{"text":"This is one of the new locations in the Downtown Summerlin Mall. Excellent location and beautifully modeled. 

This place seems to be very busy, which is excellent for them. When you walk in, it's an order and seat yourself type of joint. #1 reason why I will tell you this place is overpriced. 
Also overpriced because it's off the strip. You would expect these kind of prices on there, but not for the regulars in town that's far enough from the strip. 
Another thing I'm not much of a fan of, they have shared seating here. Which is okay for some places, but a place like this? Probably not. It's so small in here as it is. People tend to take odd chairs and leave room for 1 person when if they could have scooted down just one, it'd make so much more room for parties over 2 people. It's too hard to leave easy things up to people because they'll fuck it up every time. 

The food here is good. I will say that and that is was pretty quick. 
Overall, just for a lunch with 2 drinks costed us $41.00 plus tip. That's a little much in my opinion. For the location, the food and the fact that you serve yourself, seat yourself and they have a tip on the receipt is just asking a lot of people. 


We had - 
The Hangover Burger
Grilled Cheese
Clam Chowder

Clam Chowder: Delicious. Some of the best we've had in town. Full of clams, good sauce that's not so creamy that you have to force it down.
Grilled Cheese: I was not a fan at all. I probably should have read the description better because I couldn't even eat it. It was just such a bizarre combination of flavors and I do not ever NOT finish my dish. The cheese is not melted, it's half walnuts and the bread is toasted with honey. It was so sweet and odd. 
The Hangover Burger: Delicious. The flavors were all meshed in an tasted excellent. The bacon was nice and crispy and the flavor of the beef was very flavorful. It was very messy, but very well worth it. Oh, and those fries...FREAKING amazing!

The customer service was fine, I just don't know if I'm okay paying a tip when it's not sit down service. But, some people don't agree with this. 

Overall, it's a nice location, modernly decorated, nice people, good food and excellent for a quick hot meal. Just be expecting to pay prices for sit down service."}
{"text":"Love this place for brunch!!


We came here on Sunday because another place we wanted to try out was a very long wait. So, if you are so hungry you can't wait, try this place out!

They don't have a very extensive menu, but the dishes were very good. 

For brunch, we had - 

Chicken Sausage Skillet. 
It was very good, very flavorful and it was a very good portion of food. 
Fried Chicken w/ gravy, eggs and hash browns. 
This was very very good. The chicken breast was so tender inside and perfectly crispy on the outside. The gravy was very tasty as well. It had a very distinctive nutmeg  flavor to it. 

We also had some mimosas - a little more on the orange juice side, but they were cheap. And their bottomless prices are very cheap compared to other places in town.

I love to look around at what other people are eating and their hamburgers look delicious. So, I can't wait to go back and try more goodies :)"}
{"text":"Greasy, soggy, cold, overpriced mess. 

Ordered via UberEATS and it was a complete waste of money. 

Buffalo chicken club - greasy, soggy, breading on the chicken is complete mush. Burnt buns slathered with unnecessary butter. Strips of bacon that taste like old processed bacon bits.

Fries - completely cold, hard as rocks, and obviously not fresh 

Apple Rings - no crispy texture at all, dough falling off of rings. Again - complete mush. 

No flavor. Just garbage. 

$25 + for this horrible meal. Don't order from here unless it's a salad

I've spoken to a manager twice in regards to getting a refund. (A few minutes after receiving my order and again yesterday when I noticed that the promised refund hadn't been issued.) During my initial call I was told \"Yea, our food does turn to mush if it isn't eaten within a certain timeframe & it took your UberEATS driver 40 mins to arrive.\" Um...ok how about you inform your drivers of the mush problem? Jeez. He then told me \"I will contact UberEATS and have them issue a refund. You won't have to do anything else.\"

Fast forward to yesterday and there is still no refund. I call again and speak to Leland. He asks for my name and phone number and tells me that UberEATS will be calling me in regards to my refund. No call. 

So at this point I'm done. The food isn't stellar to begin with but charging over $25 for 3 items that were inedible, acknowledging the problem, & then lying about attempting to remedy the situation just ensures that I, nor anyone I know, will do business with MTO Cafe ever again."}
{"text":"Been coming here for over a year. One of the best breakfast spots in town. I've had all the avocado and salmon skillet and they rock. Fruit is always fresh as well as the red or green juice. The donuts are amazing dessert as well. Great job!"}
{"text":"Was looking for a good brunch place off the strip and found MTO cafe. Located below the parking structure, this cafe is very well laid out. There are booth, tables, and bar seating with plenty of room to enjoy your meal without feeling cramped.

We went Friday around noon time and there was no wait in being seated. Upon coming, I've already looked at the menu and decided we'd get the BLTAE (?) and the \"KFC.\" 

The food took longer than expected to be cooked and we waited a while. I realized that other people who were seated after us got their food first but it seems like they got the simple stuff (waffles, eggs and toast--stuff of the like). Our server, I believe her name was Rachel, made sure we were accommodated so I didn't feel neglected during the wait.

The food portion was good and filling. The chicken on the KFC was done perfectly! Their bacon was thick, non-greasy, and crunchy--very good!

I had an iced hazelnut latte--typical. We also had their juice of the day which was some kind of berry lemonade which was pretty interesting! 

What I appreciate about this place is the ambiance and the thoughtful consideration in designing the place. Their seats had cushion and are very stylish! Makes for a very comfortable time. 

In addition, I think we sat across Rod Stewart so that was pretty cool! 

Overall a great experience with good food and great ambiance!

Don't forget to give your server your parking ticket so you can get a discount on parking. Paid $0.75 for parking after validation."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here TWICE on our three-day Vegas trip. It's super cute and comfortable inside. I love the decor and it's very welcoming. Ryan, our waiter, greeted us immediately and offered a variety of fresh juices and coffee. We ordered coffee, which came in HUGE mugs (my favorite) and we were able to get soy milk on the side, because we are dairy free. My husband got the MTO breakfast which had eggs, a bevy of meats, hash browns and toast. I had the veggie skillet (OMG SO GOOD) and a vegan pancake with coconut and carrots which was insane. Ryan checked back in on us several times, was a delight to talk to, had many insights about the local area, and knew everything on the menu. He seemed genuinely invested in whether or not we were liking our food, as did the several other people who checked on us while we were there. It was such a fantastic experience and so delicious that we had to eat there again on our last day. And again, it was perfect. So... GO THERE! EAT! ENJOY! And tell Ryan we say hi!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about MTO.  The food is amazing - everything on the menu.  Literally.  And the staff is first-rate.  They know the menu, they are friendly and they get it right every time.  MTO has quickly become my \"go-to\" spot for breakfast and lunch. 

You can't go wrong at MTO.  Fresh food, great service and an excellent location!

A special shout-out to Lisa who always goes the extra mile to make me feel welcome!"}
{"text":"Their B.L.A.T.E. is quite wonderful! If not for the pesto, then for the thick cooked to perfection bacon! The staff is great & attentive too! Def 1 of my fav places to have lunch now"}
{"text":"THE GOOD:

-Walkable distance from most of the main downtown hotel casinos & just a block away from Bonneville Transit Center if you want to bus it from The Strip. 

-Interesting menu variety that has something for everyone. So much so that it makes you want to try everything on the menu.

-Was not crowded on a weekday which was when I visited. Very odd for a place with such high review marks.

-Server was very courteous and friendly.

THE BAD:

-While walkable if coming from the direction of The Plaza Hotel along Main Street, the neighborhood is very sketchy and does not feel safe even in broad daylight. And from what I can tell while riding on the SDX, even the walk from Bonneville Transit Center looks hazardous to pedestrians so you may have to walk a very long walk to avoid getting hit by cars.

-I had the misfortunate experience of an apparent lost order where it was not \"relayed\" to the kitchen which could mean any number of things. Waiting 35 minutes for your meal to arrive can do a number of things to your imagination. Who screwed up? It sure sounded like the server blamed it on their computer system. What the heck does \"relayed\" mean? Does it mean it got punched into the system and the send button wasn't hit? Whatever. 

-The manager came by to apologize for the wait. Even asked me if there was something he can do for me. I'm not one to ask for anything complimentary so what can I do but shrug? Not a single piece of appeasement or discount was had or offered to make up for it so it made his apology sound insincere. Why are you asking me how to do your job? It only made me more angry and upset.

THE UGLY:

-In an attempt to bring everything out at once as suggested by my server, and to add insult to injury, my grilled cheese sandwich was cold. No ways would I wait another 30 minutes for them to make a new one. In hindsight I should have asked them to remove it from my bill.

-An overall horribly disappointing experience. But don't let my obvious fluke and lapse in service stop you from trying this place out. I even posted pictures since it seems apparent every other reviewer loves this place. I'm just not one of them."}
{"text":"Once again my fellow foodies here at Yelp helped me to find an awesome place to eat. It's away from the hustle and bustle of the strip but not too far. The wife and I went here for breakfast and boy did we love this place. So many great breakfast options it was hard to choose. We wound up getting the Avocado skillet and it was plenty for the two of us to share. It was delicious. Then we split an order of red velvet pancakes with chocolate sauce on top. I mean how can you pass that up. Once again it was incredible. I wish this place was back here in NJ I would go all the time. If you are in Vegas I highly recommend going here for some reasonably priced great food served by some of the nicest staff in all of Nevada!"}
{"text":"I love this place! We were greeted with smiles and such welcoming vibes. The food was amazing and the servers were so attentive. I will definitely be back and recommend this cafe to everyone."}
{"text":"This review regards a recent visit to MTO. While the menu itself is great and varied, the workers and cooks are substandard. We ordered the creamsicle smoothie, pb and j smoothie, bacon pancake dippers, a huevos rancheros wrap, and a patty melt--totaling $60. The only decent items on that list were the pb and j smoothie and the bacon dippers. 

The creamsicle smoothie was watered down. The huevos rancheros wrap was served as a skillet with zero offer to correct the mistake. And the patty melt was inedible. Given the long wait, I had no desire to complain about the meal. However, when one of the workers asked how everything was, I politely voiced my concerns. With an uneaten patty melt sitting in front of her, she meekly said, \"I'm sorry\" and giggled. ZERO offer to correct the inedible food. ZERO offer to provide a refund for the inedible food. That response is why this review is being left. For $60, she should have immediately corrected the matter and not simply offered a lackadaisical apology and walked away. If you're going to ask how something is and then not correct a discovered problem, why even ask?

Needless to say, I will not be returning. Hopefully, a manager reads this and corrects the situation for future guests and the sake of the business."}
{"text":"Rachel was a pleasure as our server. We were a party of 7 and were accommodated quickly and everything was great. I had the seasonal berries french toast with a mimosa and it was so fresh and delicious. Next time im in Vegas I'll be sure to come back."}
{"text":"I was looking for a healthy option for breakfast and this hit the spot! Located in downtown Las Vegas, it's easy to get to and garage parking is validated.

The menu is small and makes it easy to select something quickly. I tried the Broccoli Egg White omelet, while my folks got the Avocado Omelet, and the oh so delicious Vegan Carrot and Coconut Pancakes. We all shared everything and none of us had anything but great things to say about the food. 

The restaurant is spacious and trendy and the wait staff is super friendly. I'll be back here next time I'm in Vegas again."}
{"text":"BLOWN AWAY!  I saw the killer reviews but was not expecting to be blown away by over bfast but damn they proved us wrong.  Place is legit.  Food + Awesome Service made this visit a A++ experience.  One of the best bfast I've had in a long time."}

{"text":"What a great morning we had. We decided to support a friend and her new adventure at MTO cafe. When we arrived we were greeted in the most friendly manner. The staff here is amazing, our waitress was very friendly and her food knowledge was tremendous. There were five of us so we decided to try many dishes. Started of course by the ladies having bottomless mimosas. Food, yes we had food. I had the 3 egg with meat breakfast. The meat was as follows. Bacon, turkey sausage, turkey bacon, AND spam. That is right I said AND not OR. I guess AND is better. The other folks atheist table ordered many more blends of food. I will start with \"The fat Elvis\". A French toast sandwich with bananas, Nutella and bacon. This was very tasty and very rich in flavor a salty, sweet. Masterpiece. Harry's Berries, waffles with this delightful mix of Berries on the top, the waffle was light and was not too filling. Lemon poppy seed pancakes also with a fruit medley on top and a fruit compote drizzled over the top. Light and flavorful mix, the lemon not too overpowering. Chicken in a waffle, chicken fried chicken inside a waffle sandwich covered in chicken gravy. Chicken was moist, and the waffle light and airy. The gravy on top was definitely home made and filled with flavor. Smoked salmon omelet. This omelet has pieces of salmon and cream cheese soaked into the middle. Eggs were fluffy and the smokey flavor of the salmon with the combination of the cream cheese was like lochs and cream cheese in an egg dish. Amazing. What is a meal without desert. Yes we had desert, recommended by one of the owners. Forgive me for forgetting his name. We had Mini Donuts and Fried Apple Ring. The donuts were coated in powdered sugar and drizzled in honey grown over the hump in Pahrump. Very tasty, but over powered by the fact we still had the fried apple rings. These fried apple rings were awesome. A cut Granny Smith deep fried and served with a cinnamon sugar sauce that we could not get enough of.
  We will be back to this new Gem of downtown. The staff was very attentive, our drinks were never empty. Always a plus with me. The menu is simple one page of choices. They are open for breakfast and lunch. We cannot wait to try the burgers and wraps. Some breakfast items can be had as a wrap as well.
  Please check this out you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Waited for 15 minutes to get seated and no one acknowledged us at all even after i made eye contact with several waiters. I've been here on busy days and this has never occurred. Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Went here based on the many Yelp reviews and I have to say i was a little disappointed. Although its just brunch and its more of a diner style, the food for me just wasn't that great. I had the Kentucky fried chicken with mash browns and gravy. It was supposed to be their signature dish and it was fairly one note. The chicken was meh, not that crispy. We also had the chicken n waffles. Definitely had better in town unfortunately. In the end we were not that impressed with their most popular dishes so this will not be a repeat brunch place for us. Overall solid 3/5."}
{"text":"Service was Great (Drink never got half way, and asked if everything was good at leat 6 times) Food (Hangover Burger) close to perfect, fries were delicious, and the house vinnegeratte dressing really livens up the salad! After this experience I will be a avid visitor."}
{"text":"Our Sunday brunch group has been to MTO on several occasions. Gotta love the bottomless mimosas & validated downtown parking. We always bring out-of-towners to this place. 

I ordered the breakfast burger which was delicious! It was topped with a perfectly oozy egg & came with yummy shoestring fries. My person got the Kentucky fried chicken, which I \"tried\" more than 4 or 5 bites of. My friend enjoyed her Reuben sandwich very much so.

The woman who sat us was sweet and the gentleman who validated our parking was very nice.

Unfortunately the experience was dampened when the brown haired gentleman gave us our check while several people were still eating, which was odd seeing that there was no line and we did not ask for the check. We felt rushed to leave and did so when the drinks were finished."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place a lot. I just liked it ok. With all the places that are wonderful I probably wouldn't come back. Sadly. Hubby ordered (forgive me I forget exact name) the BLTE (I think it's called). He did enjoy this but thought the pesto was strange even tho it had good flavor. Just felt like it was trying to hard to be more than it is. I had the hangover burger. It was very disappointing. I ordered it medium and it came out well done. The egg was well done which kills the whole point of an egg on a burger and the richness of the yolk. It was also lacking any seasoning. The fries were really good. Loved those. The free cookie with yelp check in was good. We opted for the lemon poppyseed blueberry pancake. Hubby liked it. I didn't like it at all. Had a lemon grass under tone that tasted muddy to me. Wasn't light and fluffy and sweet. It was bitter and oddly chewy (did sit under lamp a while). 

Again. Horrible? No. Great?  Nope. There are better places to spend money (Dupars was just down street and food was very good comfort food). You won't hate MTO so I'd say it's worth giving them a chance. But for me they had theirs."}
{"text":"The food is awesome.... My wife got the BLTAE , bacon, lettuce, tomato, avacado and egg. It's a shareable size.
I got the hangover burger. Super yummy and the service is great too"}
{"text":"You walk in, stand in line, order, pay on a tablet and you get hit with a page that asks for a tip. What happened to tipping after you got the service?  Then you get you're own drink, napkins, utensils, condiments...  they should tip the customer.  If you decide to use the restroom, men go in the door with a \"sausage\" image and women go to the door with an \"egg\" image (not funny) (really tacky - all the way around).  Food is nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"This says they close at 3pm. In reality they closed at 1:50pm. Really!! That is frustrating."}
{"text":"I've heard so many good things about the MTO cafe but just haven't had enough time to go and check the place out in person. So for lunch I went ahead and ordered delivery through Yelp. They took about an hour to deliver my food. I don't mind, its delivery. Though I should have ordered a lot sooner if I knew the wait time.

Since it was my first time eating here, I went ahead and ordered a good amount of food. For starters, I ordered the tomato basil soup. Let me tell you it was pretty amazing. The flavors were just right and the didn't taste like too much tomato. I wasn't too happy about the grilled cheese that came with it though, but I got two servings of soup rather than one so I guess that makes up for it. I saved the other bowl for dinner. 

I then had the vegan falafel wrap. The falafel met expectations, though the wrap in general could have had a little bit more flavor. It was pretty dry. The box that it came in had a small side salad which I was pretty excited for after the dryness of the wrap. I looked down and my dressing spilled all inside the box. Didn't look as appetizing as I was hoping. To pair these two items I went ahead and got the red juice. Pretty delicious but a small serving for only $5.

To finish off my meal I had there apple rings. They were very tasty and reminded me of the ones that my mom used to make. The only problem that I had with this was my sauce, again, spilled all over the box so I couldn't enjoy the sauce as much as I would have loved to.

All in all it was a pretty alright meal. The delivery time was okay. The food was ok. The presentation, not so well.  For now, I will give this place 3 stars. I didn't experience any service nor do I know the ambience of the place. I will keep an open mind to my second visit there, where I will actually go to the cafe. Who knows when that will be. Perhaps, even give this place the five stars that everyone raves about.

I do have a tip for the cafe. Either make sure the sauces are fully clothed, or cater wrap the sauces so they don't open. Like you did with the juice."}
{"text":"Easily top 3 breakfast spot in Las Vegas. Incredible service, food, and style. I would give 6 stars if the Benedict was on the menu."}
{"text":"Wow! What a find! Across the street from City Hall, under the parking garage.
This place was amazing! So incredibly tasty! 
We came in around noon on a weekday, and it wasn't even busy! The cute waitresses were very accommodating (service great!). 
I had the turkey melt, while my partner had a California sandwich. Both SO good. Fries: excellent. 
The people next to us had the BLTAE (with avocado and egg), and the egg tacos. Both looked as good as they said they were.
Therefore, I have to go back! Food this good doesn't deserve to be hidden. I'll probably be checking out the Summerlin location (closer to home), but with my many visits to the Arts District, this Downtown Gem won't be losing my business.
Fantastic!"}
{"text":"I recently visited MTO for an impromptu Sunday brunch.

This place really excels in the areas of ambiance, service and design. It''s located in the Parking Bureau across from city hall, and it seems like there's not a bad seat in the house. The restaurant is literally in a glass house, which makes for great people watching. They even have USB outlets at each booth to charge your phone, which my friend and I both needed. I got the impression that the wait staff regarded us as a curiosity, though they really had no reason to; there were already Australians dining a couple tables over.

The food was a mixed bag. We started with \"bacon pancake dippers,\" which turned out to be totally sufficient. The pancakes were very much of the American style - light, airy, fluffy, and likely out of a box. The bacon was excellent and perfectly cooked. The downfall of the dish was the ice-cold maple flavored corn syrup that they served with it. A place known for its pancakes really shouldn't be serving that sort of saccharin hippopotamus wallow, and you certainly can't enjoy a dry pancake.

My friend made a solid choice in ordering the 5-cheese macaroni and cheese. It was very wet and creamy, so much so that I suspect they cook it with coconut oil instead of butter - a suspicion that is corroborated by the fact that they have #vegan options on the menu. It had an excellent flavor and was not oversalted.

The lack of eggs Benedict on the menu resulted in me sending the waiter back three times until I settled on the black & bleu burger - a selection that I would quickly come to regret. The fries were fine, and the mayonnaise was top drawer.  My burger was cooked perfectly medium and was aptly seasoned. It comes with plenty of arugula, grilled onions, Gorgonzola cheese and a blueberry glaze almost as good as the late night experiment that flooded my house back in law school. I enjoy a Roquefort cheese, which is what I expected when I placed the order, but Gorgonzola has always tasted strongly of Windex to me, so I had to take all of that off. The burger was tepid, and the bun left something to be desired. It was too sweet - somewhere between a Wendy's bun and a Hawaiian roll. I couldn't have had more than three bites as the residual taste of cleaning product had curbed my appetite at that juncture.

There was one noteworthy peculiarity about the restaurant. Each time the waiter returned to our table, he uttered the phrase \"breakfast and lunch all day\" in a casual Tracy Turnblad \"love your hair, hope you win\" deadpan; however, this couldn't be further from the truth since the entire restaurant closes at 2pm, causing us to feel rushed.

Overall, I have to conclude that MTO is not exactly worth the trip, but if you're downtown paying a parking ticket anyway, it is a solid choice for lunch. Just remember to order the macaroni and cheese."}
{"text":"The service is very bad and all the waitress's where fighting. It just seemed like an off day for all of them. I got the 5 cheese Mac and cheese and couldn't even finish 5 bites of it. My mom took one bite and almost spit it out. It had SO much blue cheese in it it was inedible and I am a huge blue cheese fan so that's A LOT. I got so sick from just that small amount I ate. I really wanted it to be good but it just wasn't."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast.   Good portion 
Quick service.   Fresh coffee. Friendly staff"}
{"text":"Everything was perfect except service... Took a very long time to be acknowledged. Food came out wrong and was left with no silverware to eat.."}
{"text":"Great place for brunch. Service was friendly and efficient. Rachel was awesome!  The flavor choices throughout the menu are great, the coffee comes in a bowl, and the bloodymary tastes really fresh. BGM was a chill and fun mix adding to an already chill atmosphere. Come to MTO and explore. Great for friends and families. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Great food and super fast service from the ladies but I did notice the manager (I assume) playing on his phone behind the counter.  If your not going to help them get out of view of customers.  The chicken pot pie was scrumptious!"}
{"text":"Since moving to Vegas I have been on the hunt for good bottomless mimosa brunch places. I was super excited when I met some people at a bar who are also all about the brunch life. They had heard about MTO, but hadn't gone so we decided to all go and try it out. The mimosas were pricey ($19.99 per person), and they served them from a jug with the champagne and orange juice already mixed together. Every time we wanted a refill we had to specifically request to receive the champagne separate from the OJ. The servers never remembered, so we literally had to ask with every refill. We asked if they could bring a small jug of OJ for the table and just bring refills of champagne, but they said that they weren't allowed to do that. I like to concoct my own juice to bubbly ratio, so that was a bummer. The food was ok. Looked better than it tasted. The service was also ok. Took awhile to get drink refills. It wasn't very crowded, so the noise level was good. I did think it was cool that there were power outlets at every table so you could charge your devices. Brunch ends right at 2pm, and they also close the restaurant at that time. Secret hopes of extended drinking were quickly dashed."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate at MTO on  a Tuesday morning at 9 AM.  When we arrived, there was nobody else eating the restaurant, which is usually not a great sign the food is going to be good.  However, given the many positive reviews we read, we were willing to stick around and try this place out.  We are really glad we did.

My wife and I each ordered the MTO breakfast which was priced at $14; kind of steep, right? No, not really.  When the food came out, it was a humongous portion of food.  You really have to be hungry finish your meal (which I did).  You get three eggs, 2 large links of sausage, 4 strips of pork bacon, 2 strips of turkey bacon, two pieces of spam fried crispy, 2 slices of toast, and a huge order of hash browns.  Again, a lot of food.  

I have to say, this meal was great.  Everything was good; we were not disappointed.  If we lived in Las Vegas, we would visit often to try other items on their menu.  One baffling aspect of this restaurant is that they are only open 8 AM - 2 PM.  Perhaps this is because they are surrounded by the city court complex and city hall areas.  However, I think they could do a stiff happy hour business in the 4-7 PM time-frame.  They should really consider staying open later to boost their business.  I have no doubt they would be busy as their food and service is top-notch."}
{"text":"Here on the patio on a beautiful March day. Had the B.L.T.A.E. (BLT with avocado and two fried eggs smothered with other goodies) After I negotiated how to put it together I found it was one of the best sandwiches I've ever eaten. Huge portion with side of fries. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"The staff are really friendly, place was rustic/modern. Food was amazing, I recommend the country fried chicken. Trust me it's a different style. And the Blueberry lemonade is absolutely delicious. We came in a large group so they provided amazing service. Thank you MTO cafe for taking my money"}
{"text":"MTO Cafe, is absoultly amazing!  Before you are even seated, the restaurant is full of bright colors, positive vibes, and eye popping decor.  
MTO has a menu that can satisfy all members of your party.  Their menu ranges from the traditional egg and toast, to waffles, burgers, pancakes, wraps, burgers, and ect.  With such an extensive menu, I have come to love two menu items which are: CHICKEN 'IN A WAFFLE' and the FRIED APPLE RINGS.  The Fried Apple Rings is large enough for two people to share easily!  The chicken 'in a waffle' is also very tasty, and filling.  This is one of my favorite brunch locations in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is a great place to start your morning . . . unless you are hung over and don't want to be greeted by the bright sunshine of morning . . . the floor to ceiling window bring in lots of sunshine and really make this place sparkle.

Oh the food . . . I had the \"Kentucky Fried Chicken\" with fresh, and I mean fresh squeezed orange juice . . . the food came quick and hot . . . the chicken was crispy and juicy . . . the hashbrowns were good, would have liked then a little crispier.

The only thing wrong . . . and it had nothing to do with the restaurant . . . the pay stations at the parking garage were not working . . . and it took an extra 45 minutes trying to get on with the rest of our day.

I will be back . . . I just need to find a different place to park."}
{"text":"I adore the vegan carrot and coconut pancakes at MTO Cafe. As far as vegan pancakes go, these babies are the best in town. They're incredibly moist and the agave nectar and pecans added on top just make life better. For $11, you get three huge flapjacks. I'd recommend splitting this heavy breakfast with another person unless you're the hulk or something.  

For lunch, I wasn't as impressed. There's one vegan option - the falafel wrap. It was a little on the dry side and the french fries might as well have been made out of cardboard. The fries had zero flavor and were all crunch. 

Overall, MTO excels as a breakfast spot but could improve it's lunch game.

YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2017: #8"}
{"text":"Stating from the day it was announced that I felt MTO Café was the most relevant restaurant on the list of eateries at Downtown Summerlin it is with some shame that it took so long to visit after the store's opening, but having enjoyed Chef Johnny Church's breakfast creations at the Downtown location several months prior I'm happy to report the dinner selections in the shadow of Red Rock are just as well done.

Eschewing traditional tableside service and instead implementing a system similar to that of Panera, where guests order and pay at a counter before waiting briefly at their table for Made-to-Order creations, it was with a specially requested tasting menu that my experience at MTO Downtown Summerlin took place and leaving selections to Midwestern Chef's discretion the plates presented frequently took me back to my childhood - memories of roadtrips espoused by some things while upgrades on traditional comfort foods were found in several more.

Beginning with flavored waters from the restaurant's FreeStyle machine - the Peach Dasani particularly lovely, round one began with a sharable tray of Mediterranean dips as well as salads and while the tabbouleh was not particularly my style all three of the dips were absolutely top notch, the smoke-imbued eggplant amongst the best I've ever tasted while edamame added a crisp, vegetal tinge to hummus atop piping hot pita.

Conserving capacity to maximize the experience, round two consisted of three soups served in espresso-style shooters and although the clam chowder may have benefitted from just a touch more brine the cream-style tomato and heavily cheese-topped French onion were both reference standard, a similar compliment applicable to the KFC Breakfast, a juicy breast of chicken beneath herb tinged double-crisp batter atop a pile of pan-seared mashed potatoes all beneath a veil of country gravy and an over easy egg.

A bit leery of rumors that the Chicken Pot Pie was substandard as the biscuit-topped version represents a favorite for myself and pretty much everyone outside of Dutch Amish Country (and those who consider Swanson or Banquet to be quality cuisine) I'm more than pleased to say that the version served by Church and Co. is something many Southern Grandmas would be proud to call their own and with both the stock and chicken teaming with herbs while the carrots offered sweet balance an equally deft plate was executed in the case of Meatloaf that opts not so hit diners with a sledgehammer of false flavors from truffle oil, but rather to dig deeper and provide an aromatic topnote to tender veal beneath flavors both smoky and sweet alongside tender orange gnocchi.

At this point admittedly getting a bit full it was thankfully a downsized portion of the vegan spaghetti squash that arrived and again focusing on nuance, with the sweetness of grapes and carrots used to offset the earthy flavors of beets and curry, one would be hard pressed to find any fault in a plate adhering to such dietary standards - the side-dish of fresh sprouts perfectly cooked, though a bit too spicy from horseradish for this diner's tongue.

Not particularly focused on plated desserts, but instead offering fresh-baked cookies and several pastries available throughout the day, it was with two boxes of goods that I took my leave after a long chat with the Chef and his team and indulging in some after the walk home with others saved for the following morning it was somewhat disappointing to find the poppyseed muffin almost inedibly dry, though the rest was just as good as the majority of the savories - both the brownie and almond pecan scone particularly memorable with soft texture and bold flavors while each of the cookies were far better than those offered at Wonderland Bakery...at less than one-half the cost.

Admittedly a bit pricey for a 'quick casual' place, yet at the same time far friendlier in service with both produce and proteins sourced from local sources as Chef Church is a regular at the local farmers markets, MTO Café is precisely what Downtown Summerlin visitors should support - a local business committed to doing things right, not another offshoot from elsewhere willing to mail it in and make bank."}
{"text":"Went for brunch & got the burger w/ arugula dressed w blueberry glaze & blue cheese (black & blue?) w/ mash browns. You can tell the chef cares a great deal what goes on the plates. Loved the balance of flavors! Awesome!"}
{"text":"Items selected:

Walnut Tossie
MTO Mini Donuts with Local Honey
Chicken in a Waffle - Bechamel, Fried Chicken, French Fries
Vegan Carrot + Coconut Pancakes with Pecans and Agave
Fat Elvis - French Toast, Banana, Bacon, Peanut Butter, Strawberries, Nutella
Grilled Cheese - Brie, Local Honey, Toasted Walnuts, Brioche
Thanksgiving Burger - Open Faced on Truffle Bread Pudding with Orange-Cranberry Sauce and Mashed Browns
Lavazza Coffee

Always happy to see a chef preaching the ethics of local-seasonal sourcing and scratch-made-to-order cooking, particularly in the breakfast scene, it was unfortunately a rocky start for myself and MTO Café as even before they opened for business a steady trickle of shady \"Five Star\" reviews began to fill the internet, a trend not uncommon but nonetheless off-putting and causing me pause until more respectable voices were heard...in this case 3 months later.  Open seven days a week from breakfast till lunch and already a downtown darling with critics, city hall, and Zappos affiliates it was on a lazy Sunday that a friend and I sat down to a table in the airy, charming space just after 8:15 and with on-point service highly praiseful of both Chef Church and owner Ben Sabouri's vision much of what followed would prove well worth the hyperbole, a total of seven items and nearly as many cups of coffee comprising our 90 minute stay.  A menu broad in sections yet well-culled in scope it was with a wide swath that we cut through the options and requesting that items be sent out individually as the kitchen felt fit it was from sweet to savory that the morning progressed, an early offering of doughnuts that came off a touch oily and the doughy bread of the 'Fat Elvis' minor disappointments more than offset by fluffy vegan pancakes, creamy brie on lightly sweetened brioche, and superlative proteins such as the fried chicken smothered in béchamel or the tender turkey burger atop savory bread pudding alongside signature \"mashed browns,\" a crunchy/creamy juxtaposition of butter, brine, and starch.  Off to a good start and informed by our server that the new menu is scheduled to debut in just a few weeks I look forward to seeing how MTO evolves over time - early marketing tactics aside this is a spot with 'destination breakfast' potential and along with 'eat' already a reason for suburbanites and tourists to make their way downtown before dusk."}
{"text":"MTO Cafe has outstanding vegetarian and vegan options, like the falafel wrap or the grilled cheese sandwich.  Great location, with decor that is warm, bright, and cheerful; but the service needs to match the decor.  Upon entry, it felt that the staff needed severe assistance with the \"warm and fuzzies\".  It's the simple things that can ruin an otherwise great dining experience.  Personally, if I choose to take the time to eat at your place, then take the time to make me feel welcome and care about the dining as a whole."}
{"text":"This cafe is awesome. The atmosphere is great. The food is MAGNIFICENT. The meatloaf is the best I've ever had. The Mac n cheese is the bomb. The owner is very personable. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS PLACE."}
{"text":"Our family walked in.....And WTH!!! I hear \"somewhere over the rainbow\".....Brother IZ!!!! This place has great food.. Some interesting dishes.  They have Hawaii's roast beef! SPAM LOL!!!
For all you Locals from Hawaii wanting a taste of home,yet some great dishes to go with it.  Check it out."}
{"text":"Damn good breakfast. Good for kids too. The Ms's had the fried chicken with mash Browns. Gravy was out of this world. The apple cinnamon crisps are outstanding. Good ambiance. The service is excellent. It is why they are getting 5 stars. We had Ryan as our server. Very helpful. You can tell there is a respect for food and a real appreciation for the concept. Worth the trip - YES! Twice."}
{"text":"Love this place! After all the crap food in Vegas this just put everything right.  Everything on the menu looked so good that I, of course, way over ordered. I had the BLTAE with veggies and the Lemon Poppy Seed Pancakes.  Everything was delicious and huge.  It was a little pricey but I am use to a $7-9 breakfast meal being in Texas but let me tell you it was well worth it.  

Our waitress came up about 10 minutes after we ordered and apologized for the wait (I hadn't  even noticed the wait time) and then she offered us complimentary Fried Apple Rings for the delay.  We declined the offer knowing we had ordered way too much food but they were so on top of their game and everyone was so sweet."}
{"text":"I would have given the establishment 5 stars if it wasn't for their manager Shaunna or Donna.  It was hard to hear the name correctly. 

Let me preface this by saying I spent 10 years in hospitality in my 20s as a bartender and restaurant manager and can say this woman was one of the rudest managers I've ever met. 

The service was excellent and the food was very good.  They offer a good variety of healthy choices and even have the harden your arteries entrees. 

We arrived with 10 people. When asked to be seated we explained being separated wasn't a big deal. The manager came over and began explaining that she won't allow us to sit at the bar all at once cause she won't flood her kitchen and she doesn't run a restaurant like that. She began to keep going on and on about in a very rude and loud voice.   

 Having been a manager before I understand staggered seating so you don't slam the kitchen but I never was rude to guests.  As close to verbatim as I can remember it she harshly said \"you guys are going to have to wait an hour. I can't sit you all at once and crash my kitchen.  I won't run a restaurant like that. So you guys can wait or go somewhere else\". 

Funny thing is the hottest just sat us all at different tables and the orders came In staggered anyway."}
{"text":"Had the Monte Crisco breakfast sandwich
It was so good I would recommend it everybody"}
{"text":"So we came here for my friends birthday brunch, and let me tell you I love it here. I was on their instagram and I fell in love with a breakfast sandwich and as I show the server he says it must be a special they did. The picture was from like two years ago. I then proceeded to let him know that it's okay, but he said they can make it! I was so happy like honestly they made a breakfast sandwich that wasn't on the menu! Like how cool! The food is delicious and up to par with the environment. Everyone is super friendly. Recommend it for anyone local or tourist to come visit this location! They also validate the parking ticket, so just tell your server about it! Also shoutout to our server the guy with the short Mohawk (his name is Ryan you guys!)and the girls during this time were awesome as well!"}
{"text":"Good food and great atmosphere, open for breakfast and lunch only. The staff is very friendly and the atmosphere is very good. I recommend the place for breakfast and lunch whole heartedly."}
{"text":"This was my first time here.  Staying at the Plaza and wanted breakfast.  Someone in our party saw this little gem and we decided to try it.  It is small and seems like a local joint.  Our waitress, Ally, was the best!  The food was good but some in our party said it wasn't great.  I ordered the BLTAE sandwich.  It was super yummy.  The pesto was a nice touch.  They also had some drink deals with bottomless mimosas.  I would go back.  It was good enough to warrant another try."}
{"text":"I have found my MTO breakfast. What a success. 

Seasonal Berries Waffle: blueberries, blackberries, strawberries. 

Much appreciation for the fact that the little whipped cream topping was not cavity-diabetic coma inducing-sweet. 

Comes with a little side of maple syrup too (also not over the top sweet)."}
{"text":"This is a perfect spot for breakfast, brunch, and/or lunch in downtown. Located on Main Street, it is easily accessible from the parking garage directly behind the restaurant. Bright, open space with large windows looking out towards the new Las Vegas city hall building with a choice of an outdoor seating area that would be best enjoyed in warmer months. 

A bestie and I decided to share all our dishes so we could get a better idea of the menu. We enjoyed the baked potato soup with crispy slices of bacon to garnish (which was the perfect warm-me-up, comfort-food starter); the tomato basil soup accompanied by a miniature grilled-cheese sandwich; the Elvis Breakfast French toast sandwich (which was more like dessert rather than a lunch sandwich but I was not about to complain about it); and the buffalo Rueben sandwich (I'll eat sauerkraut on anything and this was a unique pairing to me). I had a soup-bowl-sized cup of coffee and my friend had a fresh juice made with a plethora of healthy green goodness that helped balance out our carb-loaded lunch. All the dishes were DELISH.

Service was great as well. Our server was very attentive and kept my coffee cup full which is a requirement for a good review when coffee is involved at a sit down restaurant. I will also come back to try the $15 mimosa brunch special with the ladies. I think Mimosas make any brunch just a little bit brighter."}

{"text":"I love the food at MTO - Downtown more than this location. They pretty much have the same menu items but for some reason the execution isn't the same.

Banana Nutella Muffin:
I had such great expectations for this muffin that I bought 3 for me, myself and I - we were all disappointed. Me thought it lacked Nutella. Myself added more Nutella on the 2nd muffin. I didn't waste any more time and calories on the 3rd muffin and just tossed it. I mean, if you're going to put key ingredients onto the name of the menu item, those ingredients better exist! You can taste banana but the Nutella was lightly drizzled on top of the muffin - so sad. The muffin itself lacked texture and was very dense and dry. I'm not expecting cupcake...but a muffin should not be like this at all. 1/5

Turkey Melt:
Turkey, avocadoes, cheese and tomatoes. Comes with fries and pickles. Nothing crazy, nothing fancy, nothing extremely different, nothing noteworthy. 3/5

What you should definitely try: Hangover Burger, skillets, Fat Elvis and apple rings. Those are good!"}
{"text":"I walked here from jury duty since I was hungry but felt like I deserved a treat. It was definitely worth the 6-minute walk from RJC and 12-minute walk back to my car.

They were closing in an hour when I got here so I want sure why the hostess was hesitant to give me a table where I can charge my phone that was out of juice. No group of more than 4 people showed up the entire time I was there and there were sure more empty tables than the one my appetite and I occupied. I didn't get service until somebody saw my Grumpy Cat look on. They were apologetic about it and they tried to overcompensate by telling me they have a new employee and everyone was checking up on me every 5 minutes when I just shoved food in my mouth.

I ordered a few items enough for 3 people. People who passed by stared at my food. One actually said, \"wow, that's a lot of food!\" I'm aware.

Green Juice:
Apples, cucumber, lemon, zucchini, green pepper, celery and baby spinach. This was pretty good. If you don't mind the taste of celery, you'd love this. 3.5/5

Apple Rings:
They look like doughnuts but it doesn't have a lot if dough at all. They're filled with apple rings drizzled with cinnamon glaze served piping hot. 5/5

Fat Elvis:
Thick French toast with peanut butter, bacon, bananas and Nutella inside and dusted with powdered sugar, with berries on the side. You'll feel extremely fat after a few bites but it's delicious so, you'll end up with mixed emotions of guilt and happiness. 4/5

Broccoli:
Egg white skillet with spinach, broccoli on top of potatoes. This was good but a bit oily. 4/5

I would say my experience was 3.5 stars. But they actually give back to the community. They help Childhood Cancer/ Leukemia so, I'll give the extra half a star for that."}
{"text":"My man loves this place, and told me I had to try it.  we went for brunch and then place is beautifully decorated, located in downtown summerlin.  it's cafeteria style where you order at a counter and they serve you.  

we both got the chicken in a waffle.  presentation stunning... it is waffles with a chicken fried chicken breast in the middle with white country gravy on top.   it looked so good I couldn't wait to eat it.  sadly I was a little disappointed.... it needed seasoning BAD.  For the price you pay for this, and the long drive from green valley, I really wanted to love this place.  I believe sometimes restaurants cam have bad days where seasoning is a little under, so maybe it was just that.  I may give them another try since all their food looks so beautiful.  cross my fingers"}
{"text":"We came on a Sat morning for breakfast, it was 2/3 full in the restaurants, the line was short thou.  

Mom ordered the hen house and she really loved it!  Hubby had the rueben sandwich with side salad instead of fries, it was delicious! I had the huevo ranchos and elvis, huevo ranchos was not impressed and it looked kinda sloppy.  The french toast was good so it kinda make up for it, it was stuffed with banana, bacon, and peanut butter. Nothing can beat sweet and savory! 

The food came out so slow, even slower than a regular restaurant.  Not sure why! However the servers there were awesome! Very friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"Don't bother if just driving through Vegas. NO parking available in parking structure.  Obviously just for local business people."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast for the first time today with my family and It was absolutely the best. Everything was fresh and hot. Pancakes to die for. The atmosphere was so nice. I highly recommend this lovely place."}
{"text":"After three days for a quick vacay in Vegas it was nice to escape the hustle and bustle of the strip and find some quality food. Parking is in a structure and would cost money, BE SURE TO GET A VOUCHER! It's great. The food was as expected and of good quality. 

To put it in perspective, I felt like I had been hit by a train from the night before and was willing to really eat anything. But, I was willing to eat at MTO cafe. I got the scramble and it was nice and substantial. Decently priced and you get what you ask for. The staff was quite friendly and patient to our slow thought process on the day. And the parking voucher was big kudo points. He handed it to us without even having to ask."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE the French toast here! Great customer service and they do try their best to seat you as fast as possible given that they're almost always busy! Really great place for breakfast!"}
{"text":"So good. Everyone is right about the food!! Comfort food with a little twist to make it a little different , yet fresh and delicious. Had the French onion soup, I'm picky about my French onion soup and the soup here was definitely one of my favorite . The green juice is in one my top two favorites I've had. Again I'm super picky about green juice. We also had the KFC and the BOB. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu here. The only thing is you may wait 5min longer for your food than at other places, but is worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I was very happy to meet some of your staff this past Tuesday at the Shelby Museum event! The burger with the Quail egg was AWESOME! We live right up the street and plan on visiting your Downtown Summerlin location very soon."}
{"text":"From the comfortable artwork to the attentive service this spot has it all. Now let's get to the food. I got the avocado skillet with fresh tomatillo sauce, cilantro, and mashed hash browns. 

It was served still hot in a cast iron skillet and thru already had my favorite hot sauce on the table. The free cookie was a little over cooked but hey it's free right? The coffee was smooth and simple. Go ahead and make sure to come out here for a nice brunch."}
{"text":"What happened to this place?!? Started off so good, considering the one in downtown is great. Just had my final meal there. Gave it too many tries. Just got worse every time. The staff is very nice but the food is just thrown together with no care. I get the same thing every time. And every time it tastes more bland and sloppily put together. Owner has to get this location together."}
{"text":"The Kentucky Fried Chicken and Fat Elvis breakfasts were phenomenal!  Great service, cool atmosphere and bottomless mimosas. Short walk from Freemont Street. Best breakfast/brunch of our trip by far. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"All I can say is you must get the KFC. Just order it and prepare to be happy. I was pleasantly surprised. It is worth the hassle of parking in the structure. I almost left because of all the construction but don't let that stop you. Go inside and eat!!! Fantastic food and I am über picky. Thanks!!"}
{"text":"The young lady that took our order was very polite and pleasant. ThIs was our first time here so we had a lot of questions. Every time that we asked a question, Diana would jump in the conversation to answer. I believe she is the boss. Maybe if she quit micromanaging her employees, they could flourish on their own. 

I ordered the MTO breakfast.  I ordered scrambled eggs but was brought over-easy. No big deal. It was corrected and brought back. 

The coffee was warm but far from hot. Diana said that she made the coffee when she first came in. Ya I could tell. The next cup was much better. 

As for the food, it was pretty good. My wife had the broccoli omelet and said that it was incredible!!  My MTO breakfast was pretty good. 

I would definitely comeback but have something different next time. 

My advice to Diana would be to give your employees a little more freedom to answer questions that are directed to them. They are friendly and intelligent. Remember, there is a reason that you hired them."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place for Breakfast/Brunch. Very different to what I would expect from a Vegas cafe but being off the strip it doesn't have to be touristy or overpriced!

Very friendly staff and very chill vibe. I ordered the Lemon Poppyseed Pancakes with the Blueberry Ginger Compote and a side of Bacon and Sunny side up eggs. It was DELICIOUS! I was in a sugar coma for hours! 
My boyfriend got the Body Builder as an omelette and that was super tasty as well. The coffee here is also delicious!
Will definitely be back to try bottomless mimosas!"}
{"text":"Everyone deserves a mental health day. I just so happen to like breaking up my work week by taking Wednesdays off. Downtown Summerlin is so quiet during the middle of the week. With all the food choices, it was difficult to pick a place. I have heard many good things about MTO and decided to check it out for myself. 

The atmosphere is open and industrial. Large tables are abundant and promote communal sitting. From the empty restaurant I saw when entering to the jammed pack area upon leaving, it is good that people don't mind sharing space. I sat outside and enjoyed the sunny day. Yes, it might have been 65 outside, but I was glad to have the peace and quiet. Once it starts to warm up, it will be a great place to sit and read.

The counter service is efficient. Once the order is placed, you just find a place to sit and they bring it out. The prices are really reasonable for the quality of food. I got the black and blue burger and was shocked by how well it was prepared. The blackberry sauce was fantastic against the blue cheese. I could not have been more happy with what I got. For $13 it was the most reasonable meal I could have got within the plaza."}
{"text":"An excellent breakfast place!

Quality food for a good price...one portion is enough for two! We order the french toast and the BLTAE. The french toast was good, but average. Now, the BLTAE was amazing and plentiful! The bacon was thickly sliced and loads of them. They didn't go cheap on us. The egg was shockingly an amazing addition to what I already love with the BLTA. It makes it so much more flavorful and rich...however, it was a lot for me to consume. I would recommend asking for the egg, on the side, if you don't like the idea or can't take too much richness in your food. It can be overwhelming. 

We haven't tried anything else, but from the service and food that we have, we would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Great place, great food, great service. We had the MTO breakfast and chicken and waffles. Our plates wiped clean. Definitely worth the visit and return."}
{"text":"Omg this place is amazing The food takes a little bit long to come out when it does it is so worth it ordered the avocado and the B.L.T.A.E."}
{"text":"Don't get this 3 star review twisted. I really like this place. The food is very tasty, the staff is always friendly and this location has a cute outdoor patio. I would give this place a solid 4 stars if it wasn't for the prices. 

Now I'm not one to complain about the cost of stuff. If it's good, I will justify it. But keep in mind this is a quick service place. Order at the counter, get your own soda and they bring your food out to you. So when I see $7 for a cup of tomato soup, Nope, that's where I draw my line. 

My spinach salad was so awesome but without chicken ($3 extra) it would have been a little boring simply because it would have only been 3 ingredients- spinach, quinoa and tomatoes. My honey got the tri-tip breakfast plate and the meat was rare (not even warm it was cooked so quick). So we brought it back up and the quickly fixed it but the flavor was just very beefy (not in a good way). The rest of the plate was delicious but he wouldn't order it again. Said he'd go back to the protein plate instead. 

Overall, yummy and quick but it hits your pocket just a little too hard. Which makes MTO more of an occasional lunch stop instead of a regular one."}
{"text":"Regretting leaving the tip at the register before getting the food and service.  When I asked the food service girl for a comment card for feedback, she suggested Yelp.  Well, Missy, I not here to compliment you.  Based on the poor reviews here that go back to it's opening, you'd think management would correct the customer service issues.  Apparently not.  I also found the food overpriced, and customer service lacking.  They seem to expect a 15-20% tip for food you order at the counter, then when seated, I asked the server for a fork, she points us to a service stand?  WTF.  I understand why this place was pretty quiet at lunch today."}
{"text":"Amazing food but SO SLOW! Bummer, I'm not sure why it takes sooo long to get your food."}
{"text":"Amazing! My veggie hash was the best egg and veggie in the morning experience I've ever had. My husbands apple stuffed French toast was amazing also, but I am obsessed with this veggie hash! If you're looking for a guilt free breakfast on your way in or out of VEGAS, come here! There's a garage above it and it was not a hassle getting to MTO cafe below. Top notch customer service and a friendly, fun, clean atmosphere. we will be back soon!"}
{"text":"We drove out to Summerlin on the Fourth to watch the parade and MTO was one of the handful of restaurants open for lunch that day. We ordered some classics that were made to order with  fresh ingredients that left everyone satisfied.

The line was about 10 deep at 11:30 on the holiday but moved quickly. The menu is fairly large with both standard American breakfast and lunch fare. Our wait was about 5 minutes and after ordering through the fast casual set up and pouring our drinks, we had a seat outside where there was some shade to protect against the temperatures which were pushing into triple digits.

The food was brought out in a timely manner despite how busy it was. The tortilla was layered toward the top on my huevos rancheros which pleased me that the texture wasn't lost from the salsa and egg yolk. I also got to have half of my wife's turkey melt. With both dishes, the creamy, fresh avocado stood out the most.

Even though we were outside, an employee regularly checked on us and cleared our plates when we finished. Lunch for three was a little pricey at $42. This is a worthy stop if you're looking for standard breakfast or lunch and might not have time for a full sit down meal."}
{"text":"I've dined in a few times and overall like the food. I ordered delivery not having time to leave the office today. It took almost an hour and a half to receive my food and the fries were cold, hard, and crunchy. The wrap and side salad with avocado was pretty good though. I'd still eat there, but will try to pick up if at all possible. Maybe the food will be more fresh."}
{"text":"Food was good... the fat Elvis was delicious same with the walnut tossies and the French onion soup.
They forgot to bring out a few items of ours and for some reason one of the managers/owners came to talk to us like every five minutes to talk, and kind of stood right by us interestingly enough and watched us eat and it made us a little uncomfortable."}
{"text":"This was nice surprise. It was delicious, good portions cooked well, this will be a definitive stop next time i come back to vegaa"}
{"text":"I'm going to give this place the benefit of the doubt. I came here on Mother's Day and the place was packed, but fully staffed. The busboy we had was more helpful than the waitress. The service could be better but the food makes up for it. I had the hangover burger and it was great. The chicken my mom ordered wasn't dry or bland. I recommend the hangover burger and the KFC breakfast. The coffee is also great. My brother ordered the fat Elvis French toast and was severely disappointed. Nobody mentioned specials or dessert: two things I would have liked to been informed about. The place was clean but the service demands that two stars be taken."}
{"text":"Currently in an Uber on our way back here for a second time before we head to the airport! We LOVE this place. The food is fresh and creative and the service was so friendly. I had yoga pants and wanted to try pancakes but didn't want a full order. The server offered to bring a single pancake which was perfect. We left feeling full but not gross, a sign of good quality ingredients and excellent balance. So pumped for this second visit!"}
{"text":"Cherylynn...possibly spelled wrong.. was the awesome server who brought us our amazing brunch. I had the kentucky fried chicken which was supurb. All the food items (poppy pancakes and quinoa salad) were plated beautifully and tasted even better than they looked. 
Overall the whole staff was above and beyond friendly, knowledgeable,  and warm and welcoming.  Ill be back"}
{"text":"Honestly one of the BEST breakfast spots in Las Vegas. The atmosphere was awesome and the service was beyond amazing. My boyfriend and I really enjoyed the food. It was excellent. Nothing to complain about here & highly recommended to anyone looking for great food and great service."}
{"text":"Trevor! Thanks for sending over the extra fries unbidden. It made a great lunch even better.

So, I can't figure out why this place doesn't have a line out the door. Was looking for a good breakfast spot while staying at the Nugget, and seeing the line for Starbucks in the morning stretched back to the pool area. That is only a slight exaggeration. Went to Yelp, found MTO, and did a take out order for breakfast. An outstanding latte, great coffee, Denver omelette, and some kind of chicken-y wrap. All excellent. Friendly service at the counter, too.

The next day was the capper, though. We stopped in around 11:30 a.m. on our way out of town. I had an absolutely superb sandwich EBLTA -- egg, bacon, lettuce, tomato, and avocado, for which I swapped out the bacon for chicken sausage. It was amazing. She had a turkey cheese avocado melt that was made from hand-carved turkey and reportedly delicioso, though I didn't taste it. That EBLTA was all I could handle.

Especially with the Trevor gift fries. And he didn't even know I was Yelp Elite 2017 (struggling mightily for a 2018 badge)."}
{"text":"Wow! What a treasure.  Came here after visiting Pawnstars on a Sunday morning with my husband, brother, sister-in law, daughter and her husband.  Everyone loved their food. I had the red juice and lemon poppyseed pancakes and tasted the hangover burger.  All were delicious!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot! Friendly staff! A little out of the way but was worth the trip. Tons of food on my plate, so come hungry!"}
{"text":"Whether you find yourself exploring downtown or reporting for jury duty (like I was), this place offers quick service and is located within walking distance of Regional Justice Center and caddycorner to City Hall. The service was fast enough that I was in and out and back at my jury seat withing the alotted hour.

I had the hangover burger which is a delicious mess of a burger and so yummy (Not for dieters) They also have super yummy crispy skinny cut fries. All of their food looked great.

This place is small and fills up fast, but turn around was pretty quick. You can also place orders to-go. They also have counter top seating.

Etch-a-Sketch's are available to distract yourself or the kiddos."}
{"text":"Service is great and they have healthy choices as well as not so healthy choices, my wife loves the tree hugger plate and I like the skillets"}
{"text":"Forgot about this place for awhile so glad to rediscover it! Love the breakfast B.L.A.T!  Was nice to sit outside because the weather was nice.  The staff is great and often checks to make sure you don't need anything!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit due to a voucher we purchased on the Radio show. I asked about a Gluten free menu. I was surprised that there isn't one. I ordered the chicken salad bowl but the cashier profusely apologized for ringing up the quinoa salad when he brought the food out. I kept it because it was going to be my second choice. He even brought me the other dressing to try. It was delicious and healthy with lots of arugula and cukes. The hubby ate the BLTAE sandwich which was highly recommended on Yelp. He said it was one of the best sandwiches he ever ate. Eating outdoors on the patio in the sunshine was an added bonus. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing in every way.  I've visited here several times and always enjoy my food!  I've tried everything from the Queso Carne to the Mini Donuts.  Everything is fresh, delicious, and made with care.  The staff here is super friendly and truly make me feel like they enjoy coming in to work everyday.  I challenge you to go here, enjoy some Lemon Poppy Seed Pancakes served by their lovely staff and try...just try to not smile for the rest of the day in utter satisfaction and delight.   Trust me, you can't yelpers...you just can't."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times, and every time the experience has been okay. My favorite thing about this place is really their adequate amount of outdoor seating, making it a good location for a weekend brunch. The food is not bad, but it usually takes me a while to even decide what to order because, in my opinion, nothing on the menu really stands out too much. And their dishes are a little over-priced for brunch or lunch. If they lowered their prices I would probably come back more often."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and the morning workers' customer service was better than expected. My mom didn't like how her latte was made so they fixed it."}
{"text":"Went here twice during Christmas week. Food is delicious, huge cups of coffee, great homemade donuts and apple rings, delicious green and red drinks, reasonable prices, fresh ingredients, and above all, great service. The restaurant is clean, with charging ports in the booths. Try the MTO breakfast, it can serve two people. Burgers are amazing! The place is off the strip but really easy to get to by car. Nearby is the Gold and Silver pawn shop, where you can snap a few pictures of yourself after your meal at MTO. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Very nice little local restaurant! They offer a freshly made green juice for breakfast and pour a very large cup of coffee. I had the broccoli skillet, fresh veggies and eggs over hash browns. The kids pancake was an over sized Mickey Mouse and very tasty as well. Definitely a great breakfast spot that you need to check out!"}
{"text":"Glad we found MTO.  We were staying at the Cal and were looking for something different (non casino). MTO has really great service.  Not your typical diner food either.   Went there for breakfast (I love breakfast!) yesterday but found the menu to have some interesting options.  I didn't get a breakfast meal after all, instead I had the quinoa patty with grilled chicken breast and avocado.  It came with a salad.  Also has a green juice.  The husband had the breakfast that had bacon, spam and sausage.  He couldn't finish his meal it was so much food.   It was about 15 min from the Cal and near City Hall."}
{"text":"Wow. What a lunch I had here. Met a friend who recommended it before, and we headed here during lunch time. We were greeted right away, staff was friendly and the place was bright. If you drive here they validate parking for up to an hour in the connected parking lot, you just have to ask.

Our server was strange a bit, but all smiles and super personable. I ordered the tomato soup and the turkey melt sandwich with fruit. Off the bat the sandwich comes with fries, but to upgrade to fresh cut fruit is 2 bucks, some people will probably complain about that. When I got the turkey melt it was seriously delicious. There was fresh avocado, melted pepper jack cheese, even the chipolte aoli was delicious and I normally hate sauce. It was really just the perfect sandwich. The fruit that came as the side was also really fresh and delicious as well. Would definitely recommend that sandwich! 

I am sure you are wondering well Jen, if the place was so awesome why the 4 stars? Well kids, because the tomato soup and grilled cheese was not 5 star worthy. If I had stuck to just the turkey melt I probably would have given it 5 stars for that. We also tried the 'famous' apple rings, which were basically fresh apples in a coating and fried. They were good but for anyone watching their weight it is a nightmare! 

Overall I really loved this place and may be back for another Turkey melt!"}
{"text":"Fried Apple rings were to die for but you have to eat it right away. Passion mango tango special juice of the day was ok, nothing special. We ordered the Kentucky fried chicken dish which was soooo good. The chicken was perfection and seasoned well. The eggs were nice and fluffy. I didn't care for the gravy which was a disappointment but I got over it quickly. The corned beef hash dish was so good with slices of beef not dog food like the manager said! Great customer service and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Nice outside atmosphere. Yo can eat outside or inside. We had the teriyaki turkey burger and fries. It was very good! Prices reasonable."}
{"text":"I tried the MTO Cafe for breakfast, The staff are quite friendly. On an average It takes around 10 mins of waiting to be seated. The place is cool and feels at home. The decor is simple and elegant. The Red juice was simply refreshing and brought in a full vibe of energy. The sandwiches and Wraps also taste good, we tried the \"Kentucky Fried Chicken\" and \"The Hero\". Loved them ! 
Good way to GOO !!

Overall a good Experience !!"}
{"text":"Amazing healthy food.  Service was fantastic,  food came quickly so a great place to stop for lunch during a work day.  Meal on average will cost 35-45 for two people."}
{"text":"Not your typical Vegas joint!

After a night of poisoning my body with who knows what kind of alcohol. MTO was a pleasant surprise. We all wanted to have some yummy food and MTO fit the bill. 

Still feeling the effects of a hangover I wanted some comfort food. Kentucky fried chicken with gravy, hash mash and eggs was the only thing that was going to cure this hangover. Damn that was good. Chicken breast was battered just right and juicy. Gravy was light but flavorful. Hash were crunchy and tasty. Eggs cooked perfectly over medium. I couldn't have asked for a better meal. 

Now check this out. For those that eat chicken fried anything with gravy and all that stuff that taste so good but is bad for you. You know that this stuff is filling and weighs you down a bit. Almost to the point that you regret eating it. Well not here at MTO! Food was great, fresh and everyone at our table were stoked on their meals. I had some nibbles from the other plates and I would love to see MTO in my hometown of San Diego. 

The slogan is \"Fresh comfort food\" and I have to agree."}
{"text":"Love this place! I find myself craving it all the time after trying their Turkey Melt (with their house salad as a substitute for fries) and their Body Builder skillet! Both are fantastic and a must try! Wish they closed later since their menu could definitely be great for dinner - who says you can't have breakfast/brunch food for dinner?! Haha definitely try MTO when you are at DTS! :)"}
{"text":"MTO Café is located in downtown Las Vegas, and although it's not really too close to anything else, it's worth the trip. I had the all-you-can-drink bottomless mimosas and Bloody Mary's - only 20 bucks which is a good deal in this town. For brunch, it's like \"hangover heaven\" with a lot of options when you've had a few too many the night before. I had the \"Kentucky Fried Chicken,\" which is a fried chicken breast, a few eggs, very little potatoes and hash browns. It sounded like a lot of food but was pretty small, especially when compared to the photo of it on the flat screen TV. Their beer is super limited, which makes me think that I'd only go back for brunch. There are some other great options, like \"Chicken in a Waffle.\" Im too curious not to go back and try it!"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch! Just had a procedure done down the road and decided to grab lunch at a new spot. Friendly service and let us add a couple things to our orders with no problems. Prompt soda refills also. 

I had an omelet. I'm eating keto right now so no carbs, they have a great selection of healthy options as well as keto options. Even have a bodybuilders omelette made with egg whites. 

My husband had a salad. It was packed full with eggs, turkey, cheese and chicken breast. He enjoyed his meal as well. Got very busy but didn't seem upset we stayed late and worked on our laptops. Great service!! Oh and you can use the city wifi also."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and I really like this place. The food is good and fresh. Last time I had the lemon poppyseed pancakes with blueberry compote, and it was the best pancake breakfast I have ever had! Yesterday I had the grilled cheese with salad. The sandwich was grilled perfectly but I didn't really care for the type of cheese, just my personal preference. My friend had the turkey melt with fries and it was perfect. The portions here are really large, we've had to take half home every time. 

The cafe is only open until 2pm, and if you get there between 12 and 1 you will have to wait. The hostess was very nice and attentive, our server the first time was great but the second time (different server) a little brusque and impatient. No biggie, everyone has a bad day sometimes. Both time a managerial type came by to check on us. Beware if you have a hearing problem, the music is really loud and you will get that annoying echo because it is all hard surfaces in there. This is really the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars. 

All in all a good breakfast/lunch experience. I like to support local businesses and will be back."}
{"text":"Great service. The food was mind blowing. Nice place if you're looking for local food rather than tourist traps."}
{"text":"Our waitress Rachel was really nice. I ordered the chicken in the waffle which was a chicken breast waffle sandwich minus the gravy. It was decent, waffle was good, chicken was good but needed a little salt. The fries were also good and I tried the mango lemonade which was also good. My hubby had the hangover burger and he didn't enjoy it but he is really picky. Overall I would try this place again if I am in the area. It's connected to a parking garage which is good."}
{"text":"Fabulous service, nice atmosphere, decent food. The quinoa crunch salad is awesome with lots of avocado, avocado hummus, watermelon radish, broccoli, arugula, quinoa and hot sauce. That whole Summerlin shopping center is a nicely landscaped space."}
{"text":"Love love love this place I've had half the menu now and I'm never dissatisfied. The fat Elvis is perfection."}
{"text":"They were really busy today!  We had fried chicken and Denver skillet. Service from the kitchen was slow but our waitress took great care of us while we waited. The large coffee cups made the coffee cool off quickly . The chicken was tender and seasoned well. The Denver skillet was delicious but it was a large portion and the whole bottom was covered with their mash browns. Great place if you are looking for large portions."}
{"text":"Tried a variety of items this morning, pancake bacon dipper, 5 cheese mac n cheese, and the hangover burger w/fries. 
All yummy, all amazing, service great, free wifi, outlet for my laptop which is allowing me to catch up on many yelp reviews!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, good food and very friendly staff. Local hangout. The Manager, mike is super nice and professional! Really enjoyed our breakfast here and we will definitely be back next time we are in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Great food with healthy options and not so healthy but do yummy options.  

Great atmosphere with nice urban artwork and modern music. I didn't feel that the music was too loud. 

Good service: The waitresses greet you very nicely and are very personable. When it's busy, the waitresses can be not so attentive at times. However, the manager is very active and keeps it flowing. On a separate occasion, the manager comped my table some mini-donuts."}
{"text":"Absolutely spot on.  Had a bottomless Bloody Mary and the skillet with chorizo and mixed peppers and veggies.  My uncle had the chicken in between two waffles, which he enjoyed immensely.  The Bloody Marys had a bit of orange and ginger to lighten it up a bit; very good addition.

Staff were happy and friendly and took time to explain what they do and even allowed us to sample things they were preparing for later, like a caramel apple sangria.

It's not cheap, but not too expensive.  If you want to have a great breakfast and enjoy your morning slowly, this is the place to be."}
{"text":"MTO Cafe has opened its second location at Downtown Summerlin, open from 9:00am-9:00pm daily.  This means that its fans can now have MTO for dinner and that's what four of us did tonight.  I've only ever had breakfast at the original location on Main Street so I've been curious to see what their other menu items are like.  Tonight's choice was the chicken pot pie, comfort food that's apropos for the fall weather.  MTO's version is served piping hot in a skillet with four buttermilk biscuits, shredded chicken, carrots, onions, celery, and leeks: so tasty!  The biscuits serve as the \"crust\" of the dish and it's definitely a hearty meal.  A generous serving, I shared it with the pals and they agreed that it was delicious.  
This location differs from the first one in that you order at the counter and seat yourselves.  There's a flatscreen TV, a Coca Cola freestyle soda station, an outdoor patio seating area, a community table inside, as well as comfortable tables and booths.  The booths have convenient electrical outlets in the wall to charge your electronics while you dine and the dining tables have purse hooks, a feature the ladies (and men with murses) will appreciate.  Service was excellent, too.  Open just in time for the holidays, there's no doubt that this MTO will be buzzing with business, gaining more fans along the way.  Glad you're in my 'hood now, MTO--we'll be visiting you often."}
{"text":"MTO Cafe: Made To Order.
This is a nice, new, cheery spot located across the street from City Hall, on the first floor of the parking garage right there. A friend and I met for a meal on a recent Friday at 11:00am and were seated right away. The menu offers up breakfast and lunch items, many of them comfort food style: chicken n waffles, grilled cheese sandwiches, as well as a Fat Elvis sandwich (French toast, Nutella, bacon, peanut butter, and strawberries).  The 'made to order' part applies to the breakfast, where you can choose a wrap, omelet, or skillet form for options that include avocado, salmon, chicken, chili, and broccoli.
I had the MTO breakfast:  3 eggs, chicken sausage, 2 slices of turkey bacon, 2 slices of regular bacon, 2 slices of Spam, mash browns, and toast.  Opting for egg whites and sourdough toast, it was a larger than normal meal for me with all of that meat.  The bacon was made just right, but the Spam wasn't cooked long enough and the turkey bacon was buried underneath the eggs and just limp. The chicken sausage was good, too.  The mash browns are a combo of mashed potatoes and hash browns and I enjoyed those very much.  I left one slice of Spam and half a slice of chicken sausage on my plate, full from all that food.  
I used my Yelp check-in offer of free Walnut Tossies when we got there.  Our server had never seen it before so she took my phone over to another waitress who cleared it with her boss.  Said boss, Ben, came over to our table and introduced himself as one of the owners.  Apparently I was the first person to use the check-in so he asked how it worked on the phone app, I showed him, and he was very happy.  I was happy with the Walnut Tossies at the end of the meal for dessert, 3 little mini-pastries of walnut and brown sugar.  
Overall, it was a good experience, especially since my friend treated me to this meal.  I don't spend $14 on breakfast on a normal basis, but I'll come back to try some of the lunch items.  MTO Cafe is a cool addition to Downtown and nice to have as a dining option there."}
{"text":"MTO was a good experience.  My boyfriend and I went for Valentines Day (drawn in by their bottomless mimosas).

We had the Kentucky fried chicken, the Broccoli breakfast and the bacon pancake dippers.  I loved the Kentucky fried chicken!  I like the gravy they use and the hash mash, chicken and eggs go together so well.  I like how the pancakes for the bacon pancake dipper are thin.  I wasn't a big fan of the broccoli breakfast.  It was a little bland.  It's a healthier option, but I felt like it would benefit with more seasoning.  However, you have a choice to make it skillet, omelet or flatbread style.  The skillet style serves it with potatoes."}
{"text":"Underwhelmed. We gave MTO a try this morning while shopping for Christmas presents in Downtown Summerlin. We were in the mood to share a snack versus ordering a full meal each, so we went for the triple stack of Vegan Carrot Pancakes + Coconut and Agave Syrup. Despite how the item is worded on their menu and expecting a carrot cake version of vegan pancakes, we were served plain, flavorless, gummy pancakes topped with raw, shredded carrot, coconuts and agave syrup. 
Like I said, flavorless and so odd. Who serves raw, cold carrot with warm pancakes? The textures were very strange and not at all pleasant. Plus, because the pancakes didn't taste like anything at all, all you could taste was carrot and coconut. 

Won't be venturing back, but the food was quick and the staff were pleasant, for what it's worth."}
{"text":"We stopped here on our way out of Vegas for brunch. Good god. It was incredible. My boyfriend had a huge French toast and I had a grilled cheese and tomato soup. The grilled cheese was filled with fontina and Brie. 10/10 would go again."}
{"text":"Another Fremont Street gem! I had a ridiculously good and unhealthy breakfast here. It was fried chicken with gravy and eggs and mashed hash browns and everything good in the world on a plate. And I ate every bite of it. I am a sick human. I would highly recommend this dish. The hsuband got the waffles with the Nutella and the PB and the bananas and whatnot..... So rich and tasty. Don't question it, just check this place out."}
{"text":"Service was super friendly from the cashier to the expo to all the members who checked on us! Great outdoor atmosphere and food was SO yummy!! Can't wait to check out the rest of their dishes!"}
{"text":"I was so happy to find this cafe near downtown. It has a great mix of savory and comfort food as well as light and fresh choices. There is enough for both the vegetarian and the carnivore to be happy at MTO. 

I enjoyed a nice cappuccino followed by the hero sandwich, which was nearly more than I could finish. The meats and greens were very proportionate to the bread and pesto and it was exactly what I was hoping for. The fries are small and thin style and quite tasty.  The seasonal fruit cup was also colorful and fresh. 

The service was friendly and timely. An all around great experience that is well worth getting off the strip for. If you're looking for a good brunch, look no further. It is in an easy to find location near the downtown area with ample parking.

Also, check in on Yelp and get a free cookie for dessert!"}
{"text":"Favorite new brunch place in dtlv! Loved the fresh green juice and fried Apple rings! My boyfriend had lemon blueberry pancakes which were delicious and full of flavor. The inside is bright and welcoming and the staff are all lovely. Everything came out perfectly timed and great, also a big fan of all the vegetarian options. There's something for everyone in this cute little place!"}
{"text":"Had brunch and loved it.  We shared the Avocado Skillet and the Kentucky Fried Chicken dishes.  Both were delicious and the portion was very good.  The chicken dish was similar to a chicken fried chicken breast served over \"mash browns\" and topped with eggs and white gravy.  Any one of those would be good but the combination was GREAT.
We look forward to our next trip.
Oh, park in the attached garage and they validate for parking for an hour.  VERY convenient."}
{"text":"Came on a Sunday around noon for breakfast after reading about this place and wanting to see if it would become one of our new favorite downtown spots. They were pretty busy when we got there and there was a 10 minute wait, but we were seated in about 5 minutes.

Our drink orders took a little longer than hoped to come, but that was fine. After some deliberation we decided to try the MTO breakfast and the lemon poppyseed pancakes. Our server, Ruby, may have just been having a bad day but the service continued to go downhill. We had to ask for silverware so we could stir our coffee. Another server brought the food out and it took her several minutes to even come by and ask us how it was. We asked for jam for the toast; she came by and forgot it, and when she brought it we asked if she had anything other than grape. by the time she let us know they only had grape jelly, we were done with our meal. She asked us if we wanted dessert, and as I said \"no thank you, I think we're ready for our check,\" she walked away. To me that is just rude. The rest of the staff seemed much friendlier and more attentive, but our particular service experience was sub-par.

Unfortunately, the food couldn't make up for the bad service. The turkey bacon was limp and had poor flavor. The fact that they only have Welch's grape jelly is kind of weird considering they offer 3 kinds of toast. The sourdough toast was really just warmed bread with a touch of butter, it wasn't very toasty. The bacon and sausage were fine but forgettable. The pancakes were good (not great) but the compote is poured on with none on the side, so at times the stack is exceedingly dry. Overall the portions were good for the price, but their signature breakfast combo is pretty lackluster and the flavors just didn't really come together.

If you're looking for a good breakfast downtown I'd recommend Eat instead."}
{"text":"I'm sorry to give you such a low rating, it started off going great, we got seated right away, our server was courteous and quick to take our order, and the food was great, that is when we finally got it. 
I'm sure something happen to make our breakfast take longer than I'm used to, (now this could be the standard) either case it would've been nice to have been informed about our meals and not left wondering if we were forgotten."}
{"text":"Great breakfast.  Plugs at each booth to charge your devices.  Dave had the lemon poppy seed pancakes. He thought it was both a creative idea and excellent delivery. I had the Chorizo skillet which was SO very tasty. It's a bit off the beaten path but worth it.  Go get breakfast there.  NOW!"}
{"text":"Looks like I'm the odd one out here, but MTO Cafe was not as impressive as their Yelp profile would suggest. While I had an A-OK experience, I'm not sure if I'll be back. 

Came here with a large group of friends on a Sunday for breakfast/brunch before leaving Las Vegas to return back to Los Angeles. The great reviews are what led us here. I guess you can say that we left disappointed.

First off, we had terrible service. It took forever for them to get a table ready for us, despite a half empty restaurant. When we finally did get seated, the wait to order was very slow, and when we finally did order, the food came out months later. I think I grew a couple gray hairs here. The servers seemed friendly, but they just could not get it together.

The ambiance is nice. It's a seemingly clean restaurant, with a modern look to it. Nothing bad to say about it. Definitely a small, trendy cafe kind of a place.

I ordered the steak and eggs, which were A-OK. Nothing noteworthy in terms of taste, but not bad. The quantity was large, which is a plus. Also, when I went, there was a Yelp check-in offer for a free cookie. The cookie was alright. It was free, so I can't complain. Prices were reasonable.

Summary: MTO Cafe offers a pretty average breakfast experience all-around, mixed with some of the slowest service I've ever encountered. The prices are fine, the food is OK, the quantities are huge, and the atmosphere is nice."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch with friends. The food is good, the price is okay. Sat outside in their patio and it is quite nice and relaxing."}
{"text":"Searched for a place to get some grub after a long rest from all day traveling yesterday. Searched yelp and found MTO Cafe

I had the Hangover Burger-  awesome flavor and great size. Filled even me up!!!  

Son had the chic and waffles -  great with the gravy, but also tried it with maple syrup-  both were great!!!

Wife shared the MTO breakfast with a lot of breakfast meats- (asked for double bacon, minus turkey bacon)
There was even the 808s favorite meat- SPAM

All in all a great experience. Ask for Ryan-  he paid attention to refills and was very attentive and friendly!!!

Will b back!!!

Aloooooooooohaaaaaaaa!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here on the advice of some of my colleagues at work. They exclusively suggested the chicken sandwich or the hangover burger - they said I would not be disappointed.

And they were right. I ordered then hangover burger - medium well - and received a fluffy soft bun, angus burger with bacon, a fried egg, and topped off with what seemed to be bread and butter pickles. The burger was cooked perfectly, and the condiments on the burger enhanced the flavor of the burger itself. The fries are shoestring style, and cooked to perfection. 

Now, I love the burger bar. Hubert Keller is my go-to guy for a perfect burger, but MTO seriously gives the burger bar a run for their money. I would definitely return to the MTO cafe. And at $14 it makes the burger bar look ridiculously overpriced. My only complaints is that the waitress refused to separate checks which can make eating out with colleagues for lunch difficult."}
{"text":"Came here with my family this morning,  family of 10. We were seated right away. We walked over from the Golden Nugget, it was about 3 blocks away. The food was OK nothing out of this world.  The pancake bacon dippers were alright,  the pancakes were too thick and slightly over priced 11$ for 4pcs. Everything seemed to be a la carte,  except for the burgers which included fries.  The service was good, one of the owners was there and made sure we were taken care of. I wasn't too crazy about the food, all my family pretty much agreed."}
{"text":"OMG! My experience here was beyond amazing. The place is absolutely beautiful, the service couldn't be better & the FOOD omg the food. It was delicious very well put together. My favorite was the lemon poppy seed pancakes they were to die for. I highly recommend this place you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Went to have some brunch at MTO it is a neat space, with minimal decorations that kept our attention. Being from restaurants we always watch the operations of the kitchen and the wait staff. The first red flag we saw the expediter eating French fries in front of the line, in front of all the customers, gross. You have an open kitchen yes but duck in the back and feed your face. From the waiter he said his name was Jose or something like that. We asked if the chef was on duty and the waiter also said no, probably why the whole kitchen was a free for all and slow. First we ordered the pancake dippers. It was a plain over mixed pancake with bacon in it sliced into strips. Nothing fancy. Then we watched the expediter \"Jose\" walk over to a table and shake someone's hand with his gloves on.  We then ordered our sandwiches. I had the tree hugger. I think if I ate a tree it would have had more flavor than this. It was a good concept and that's all the good I can say about that. It was a quinoa bun two patties. That had absolutely no flavor at all. It had some kind of sauce in the middle and a few leaves of spinach and a few small tomatoes. It had the potential to be good if they used a little seasoning salt or some herbs or anything that could flavor the cardboard patties. The coffee was good. The hangover burger we ordered was cooked perfect and was juicy. If we were going to come back I would order the burger. It  The fries are bag fries nothing special. We ended up paying fifty dollars which seems very expensive for a mediocre brunch. It is Comparable price to EAT, with less flavor in the food."}
{"text":"I took my kids to experience MTO Cafe and once again... we weren't disappointed.  Not only was the food imaginative, it was just downright YUMMY.  X got the Fat Elvis.. what a dish.... French Toast with Nutella.... bananas, strawberries, black berries.. both generous AND fabulous! T got the Farmhouse wrap.... so healthy, tasty, and delicious, love the thought of a Caesar dressing on it instead of the usual Ranch.  Nice touch. I had the Falafal Wrap... Great choice.  Very tasty AND they brought me extra Tzitzaki sauce for my pleasure!!  The whole staff bends over backward to make the dining experience friendly, fast, and fabulous.
This place has that hipster / Portland feel to it so it's like traveling and never leaving home!  Great music, too. Thanks MTO for making the \"foodie\" in me happy!!"}
{"text":"This was such a great recommendation! By far the best breakfast in Vegas! I had the Smoked salmon skillet and my husband had the Kentucky fried chicken. Both great. There was a sweetness to the chicken that paired well with the gravy. Who knew smoked salmon, cream cheese, fluffy eggs and mash-Browns would be so good together! 

The staff are kind and helpful. Donna gave us some great recommendations for other places to eat around, but we will be back here for breakfast for the rest of our trip!"}
{"text":"Service was excellent, even with a party of 6 and a full house.  Food portions are huge and beyond delish. Had the MTO juice, was a good morning refresher. Im still craving the chicken and waffles and BLAT! Absolutely cannot wait to eat here again!"}
{"text":"Has to be my favorite breakfast joint in Vegas. Very trendy, hip and most importantly delicious food. Had a few things on the menu and all were very good."}
{"text":"Good food tucked underneath a parking garage.  Had both of their specialty juices which sent my taste buds flying!  Overall good spot for a quick breakfast!"}
{"text":"So went there with high hopes based upon reviews. Was really disappointed. The place itself was really nice with the decor and atmosphere. The first server that saw us came and sat us, then two other servers came and asked if we had been helped. That may seem like good customer service, but the way that they acted it was as if there was no server rotation. Watched the same server take the next two tables while the other servers were doing side work. As we were leaving two purple came in to eat at 1 pm and the same server we had said they closed in five minutes even though anything I saw said 2 pm.

Now in regards to the food, a single mimosa shows on the menu as $5.95 but the actual price on the ticket was $6. That may not seem like a lot but when they sell thousands that adds up. The lemon poppyseed pancakes did not have any lemon flavor to them, I ordered a burger and it was bland and overcooked. The fries had no salt on them what so ever. Would not eat here again."}
{"text":"I tried the chicken and waffles and the dish was good! Next time I'm in the area, I will definitely come back. I got to meet the owner and he was very friendly and he genuinly wanted to hear our feedback and opinion about the service and food. Great experience!"}
{"text":"Im glad i went here. Great food and menu with a lot of variety. My food was amazing and came out so quick. Im definitely coming back and their ranch is not bad :)"}
{"text":"Went there for brunch and the food was awesome. It's a small place and was very cute. The staff was very friendly and attentive. We did the bottomless mimosas and our glasses were never empty. There's a little bit of everything on the menu."}
{"text":"The food was excellent and the staff was amazing! The chef sent me out a taster of their clam chowder special that day and it was one of the best chowders I've ever tasted. I also loved all the artwork and atmosphere of the restaurant. I will definitely return with friends or family (: (:"}
{"text":"Went Saturday for breakfast. Parked in the parking garage which cost $2.50 for an hour or so. Husband had huevos rancheros and I had the fat elvis. Nothing short of amazing. I like their green juice and the coffee was awesome. I love the decor. Very nice...I'll be back."}
{"text":"My two children and I went here for lunch after a trip 
To the Discovery Children's Museum.  I'm a Vegas native, and it's been fun to watch downtown start to come to life again in the past couple of years, so I was looking forward to trying MTO out.

We walked in, and the ambiance is very fresh, modern, open, and inviting.  Service was great too... Everyone was very attentive.  A nice plus too was that the kids each got a chocolate chip cookie for dessert for free.  Another plus was that this place has the best ranch dressing we've ever had.  Hands down.  Our family loves ranch dressing, and at MTO it's made from scratch and so delish!

Now to why I have given MTO three stars instead of five.  The menu was pretty limited.  Granted, the kitchen looked small, so that could be the reason.  The food was good, but not great.  Not something I would drive downtown to seek out.  The kids had the chicken finger kids meals.  I had the chicken sandwich.  I think it was called the Bob.  The sandwich was just okay.  The chicken was kind of dry.  And, there was a big smear of chocolate on my sandwich.  It was obvious that someone cut my sandwich in half with a knife used to also cut a dessert.  I do love chocolate, but this turned my stomach a bit.

I also think MTO is a tad bit overpriced for what you get.  For one sandwich, a water, and two kids meals it was $40 with a tip.  I just don't think the food quite justified the cost.  They do validate parking garage parking as well which is nice (pretty much your only option for parking), but when I left, I discovered that they only pay for one hour of parking.  So I was in the garage, digging for change or my credit card to pay the balance that I wasn't expecting, with cars waiting behind me.

Was MTO great?  No.  Was it bad?  No.  I don't think I'd seek it out again, but wouldn't be opposed to eating there either if I was with a group of people who wanted to try it out."}
{"text":"I really enjoy walking into an establishment and being greeted warmly. And that's exactly how it was here when we walked in for breakfast. Even though it was crazy busy inside the staff all had smiles and were nice and friendly! That makes a huge difference! 

Now let's get to the food! I only got the 5-cheese Mac n cheese due to not being too hungry but oh my lord was it DIVINE. I consider myself a Mac n cheese connoisseur and this was one of the best I've had yet! The favors were delicious! And you could tell all ingredients were fresh! Score! The wife had the Sustainable Salmon omelet and she enjoyed it. On a scale of one to ten she gave it a 10. She too enjoyed the atmosphere and food. 
We will definitely be making another stop here in the next few weeks to try some more of the awesome looking menu!"}
{"text":"MTO looks modern and unassuming from the outside, but when you walk through the door the hip décor immediately draws you in, you want to be a regular. Everything is made to order, the way it should be. They have a large selection of breakfast and lunch items, juice, and an espresso machine for fancy coffee drinks. After my first visit, a work breakfast, I immediately returned the following weekend with my husband in tow. 

The lemon poppy seed pancakes are killer, I only wished that they had more blueberry compote. I also love their mashbrowns! Crispy on the outside and creamy like mashed potatoes on the inside. YUM! The MTO breakfast seems to jump off the page and land in front of every man I have ever dined with here, it's a huge hit. On the lunch side, the Hen House is essentially a Caesar salad in a wrap. It wasn't a show stopper for me, but decent. I've also tried the Queso Carne. The onions are delicious, again I just wished there were more of them. The Velveeta was surprisingly good, but it was overpowering, they really need to add a bit less to make it work. However, their fries are absolute skinny, crispy, perfection! I can't wait to try a few more things...and become a regular!"}
{"text":"It was absolutely amazing. Highly recommend the Kentucky Fried Chicken breakfast.  Green Juice was so delightful and so refreshing.  Come have an awesome breakfast with the friendly staff of MTO."}
{"text":"Decided to take the short walk from my hotel to check this place out and I'm glad I did. It's cozy (you can see the kitchen staff and give them a thumbs up a after your first bite no matter where you're sitting) with lots of natural light. Generous portions and moderately priced. Has a very Ann Arbor vibe. Coffee was good but not memorable. Ordered the KFC which was tasty and potentially outstanding hangover food (I was sober at the time, mostly) but still light enough to leave room for the Fried Apple Rings which was the real star of the meal in my opinion and the must have item between the two. Worth checking out if you're downtown."}
{"text":"This cafe could have a lot of potential. Instagram makes it look legit. Had 4 different items ordered that are all Instagram photo worthy, but taste is extremely lacking. Service is very slow. Not a busy day and took over an hour to get our food. Sodas were flat, the waitress checked and said the machine was fine. Waitress was kind, but service wasn't prompt. My vanilla latte was good, but was warm and not hot when I received it. 

Bonus: you get validation for the parking garage

Edit: parking. Validation was only for 2hrs and we were there longer bc of slow service. So still had to pay the difference in parking"}
{"text":"Staying downtown on business - 10min walk away from the Downtown Grand Hotel... Had the body builder skillet and it was awesome..."}
{"text":"I had my typical experience when I try to go to a new area: made a wrong turn, then realized that parking isn't free (a definite pet peeve). Then the food seemed to take a long time before it came out. I started wondering if the favorable reviews are flukes. 

In the end, I'm happy that I came. 

Everything that others have stated about the food--higher price, but higher quality and portions, are entirely true. The menu is full of interesting, but not necessarily always healthier, twists to typical comfort food. I had the \"Kentucky Fried Chicken.\" Boy was it good! High quality meat, gravy goodness, egg on top. Winner!  The fresh juices were pretty good too.  We tried both between our threesome.

Open windows with grand views of City Hall--sexy
Posh interior with available plugs to recharge in the booths--sexy
$3 parking, even with $1.50 off validation--not sexy, but acceptable
Great quality comfort food--awesome

Other than the parking cost, the only downer is that I feel like I need a nap after devouring my plate. Good thing I'm going shopping at the outlets nearby afterwards. 

I will be back. Heck, I wish there was one of these near my neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Rolled in here for breakfast on a Saturday morning around 10am. I was semi-surprised that there were only 1/2 the tables taken, maybe it was too early for the Vegas shopping crowd. 

Trendy little cafe, with a modern look. Not a place I would take a date for a quiet fashionable meal. Not a whole lot of ambiance here.

I ordered the Fat Elvis, which is french toast filled with peanut butter, banana, and bacon. Topped with lots of fresh fruit. It was very tasty and I enjoyed it. They have tropical ice tea and regular ice tea available, as well as your normal soft drinks from the fancy multiple flavor coke machine. 

The nice girl who took the order was very friendly, and helpful. She made a few recommendations and explained a little bit about how the process works where you order up front, get a number, and have a seat. Food came out fast. Very pleasant people working here. 

I'll be back to sample other menu items. Its clean, friendly, and not too expensive."}
{"text":"The OJ is not freshly squeezed. I've had better fried chicken elsewhere like say the local supermarket. But I will say that the \"mashbrowns\" were delicious. I've never heard of an omelet being served without toast & potatoes. Especially not for $11 But I will say that the staff were very friendly & they allowed my wife to bring in her own coffee."}
{"text":"Our server was incredible and the food was absolutely great. We went for breakfast, and I had to request a different oil be used on my meal, but they accommodated me kindly. If I was ever in Las Vegas again, would definitely return."}
{"text":"Waited over and hour for our food our waitress never came near our table after taking our orders. We attempted to wave her down to find out why two tables who had only been seated 15 minutes already received their food and we had been there over an hour and nothing (keep in mind there were only two of us). After watching everyone around us come and go and waiting another 10 - 15 minutes we finally decided to just leave. We walked past our waitress on the way out and she said nothing. I give them one star because zero isn't an option which really sucks because we were extremely stoked to try this place :("}
{"text":"MTO is amazing! We were warmly greeted as soon as we walked in and the pretty redhead cashier, Noelle, didn't rush us while we took a few minutes to look at the huge menu. She suggested the chicken and quinoa salad which was so good! She even checked on us while we were eating to make sure we liked everything, and brought us our silverware when we forgot to grab some after ordering. I can't wait to go back there again!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Great outdoor seating, fast service, and the food is delicious. The chicken and waffles are one of the best in town."}
{"text":"Not only was the menu interesting, the food tasted excellent!, high recommends for the chicken pot pie and the Rueben!!"}
{"text":"We waited over an hour for our egg dishes. Our server kept going to check in the kitchen but we never saw her actually ask anyone about our orders. Finally, we told her to bring out whatever was ready and not to wait for all orders. She still waited. My huevos rancheros were sitting for a while before I got them so they weren't hot. I asked our server for sour cream and then watched her enter stuff into the computer and forget about my request. When she came back, I asked again for the sour cream and she said, \"we don't have sour cream\". Why didn't she tell me that the first time? Then she said, \"i thought you had asked for salsa\", which would have been a reasonable mistake if she had actually brought out salsa...So then, to make up for the disastrous breakfast, the manager discounted only 10%. Really? I would have expected a more reasonable resolution and for the manager to even come to our table to apologize for the wait. We watched our server talk to the manager and they seemed to be laughing and joking about what to do. So after the over an hour wait for EGGS, watching other people come and go, the terrible service, and the careless manager, the food was not worth the wait. Very disappointed with our overall experience."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast and hamburgers. Family friendly and perfect area to walk around and shop with a full stomach. Prices are very fair, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Been hearing about MTO for a bit. I found out about it at the Downtown 3rd Farmers' Market. At this point, I really prefer to go places where I know they are getting good ingredients. This was recommended by the folks who work at the market, and they told me they were buying a lot of their ingredients there, sooooo....
I finally got there, they had an etch a sketch for my 2 year old son to play with, and we ordered the bacon (excellent), the fries with gravy (very good), the hash browns (awesome!), an onion soup (tasted like it was made today, fantastic), and the caesar salad and strawberry fields salad with chicken. The Caesar was good, maybe not great. The Strawberry Fields salad was amazing, the arugula, the strawberries, the balsamic dressing! Magnifique! Also we tried the walnut tossies, mini pecan pie like cookies, yum. I will be back, and they may even deliver to where I live!"}
{"text":"I had the MTO breakfast and my fiancé had one of the skillets.  This place had impeccable service and ambiance.  The food was Amazing!  We also partook in the bottomless mimosas.  They filled our cup and ensured that our experience was top notch.  We will visit this place EVERY time we come to downtown LV.   Thank you MTO."}
{"text":"For brunch and lunch, this is a good spot. The good thing about MTO is that you can still order healthy options, or get something a little heavier. The portions are really big so you definitely don't leave hungry. The arugula crunch salad has so much flavor and is a 5/5!!"}
{"text":"This is a GREAT spot for a nice breakfast (although I think they server lunch and dinner as well). They have many healthy and filling options for the healthy and hungry eater. They have several fresh juice options which are a great way to start the day. We had the green juice which hit the spot.

I had the avocado scramble and my wife had the broccoli scramble, both with hash browns instead of mash potatoes. Both were very tasty and hot, but nothing mind blowing, just very good. I recommend getting your scramble in a skillet as it will keep your food hot until you finish it.

Our waitress was cheery and fairly attentive. If the weather is agreeable out, they also have outdoor seating although it faces the street. I definitely recommend giving this place a try."}
{"text":"It was quite good but 12.00 for an omelette no toast or side was a little shocking. The staff was friendly manager was quite serious and not a lot of smiles."}
{"text":"BLAND and overpriced. Customer service at the register was great, but the food was VERY bland. We got the chicken teriyaki bowl and the bob sandwich. The sandwich was tiny, they forgot to put avocado in our sandwich, and the salad that it came with was gross. The teriyaki bowl lacked flavor. This meal was a waste of money."}
{"text":"Loved this place! There were several vegan/gluten free options as well as some goodness packed fresh pressed juices (or if you're feeling naughty -- bottomless mimosas). The service was incredibly accommodating, friendly, and quick. I would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"This place is great! The bestie and I were searching for brunch and mimosas. They offer bottomless mimosas and bloody marys. The food was great as well as the service. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place for a while. It reminds me of Rachel's Kitchen. It is a little bit expensive, but if a little money isn't an issue, then the food itself can hold up against a little scrutiny. The ingredients seemed fresh enough and the taste was good. I would go back again since it feels a bit healthier and quicker than some of the other options around.

Service was quite good and they came out to check on us often."}
{"text":"After sampling a Hangover Burger at the Redline Rendezvous YEE, I looked forward to going to the new MTO Cafe to try more of its offerings at the source.  So, Diane and I met another couple there to do just that.

At first I was put off a bit by the spartan interior, lack of any other customers at the time, and that there was no waiter service.  For some reason, I had it in my head that the MTO Cafe would be much like the Sahara's old bustling full-service Nascar Cafe, and be a haven for comfort food.  I was right on the second supposition, but in error on the first.  And, I was slightly embarrassed that I had recommended such a casual, seemingly fast food eatery as a place to sit down to dinner with friends.

But once the food arrived, and I gazed at and initially tasted my BLTAE, my concerns were quickly dispelled.  My friends were pleased with their food: a Black & Blue Burger with French Fries, and a Grilled Cheese Sandwich with Tomato Soup, as was I.  Only Diane lamented that her Hangover Burger was not medium rare as requested.  Yet this place is decidedly not a fast food joint.  Some very good creative cooking occurs here.

I had almost instructed the order taker to hold the egg, but thought it would be more sporting and adventurous to try a BLTAE just as is was intended to be served.  This turned out to be a wise decision, for the oozing egg yolks from two quite large and perfectly prepared Sunnyside Up Fried Eggs lubricated and added flavor to the large sammie, which I had to figure out how best to eat.  I was initially torn between cutting through one-half of the heaping and rather messy sandwich with a knife and then eating it with a fork or wrestling with it by hand, before just picking it up with one hand the normal way and directing it at my mouth.  But to get my mouth around this imposing specimen on a plate took some doing.  Yet after opening my mouth like a gaping upraised garage door, sliding the loaded and egg yolk-drenched bread slices inside, and then chomping down on the strips of crispy bacon, I was in comfort food heaven, and knew that this sandwich could be eaten in the conventional manner.  Slices of red tomatoes and shards of lettuce, large chunks of very fresh avocado, and a generous heaping of excellent crisp matchstick Fries added to the enjoyment of my meal, along with a multi-variety Coke dispenser with unlimited refills. 

In rating a restaurant, In my book the quality and taste of food are of paramount importance.  And, although the ambiance here was somewhat stark and resembled a school cafeteria, the place was clean, and restaurant staffers were friendly, helpful, and accommodating.

I expect to be back!"}
{"text":"This is our go-to place. Everything we've had has been excellent. From the hangover burger, to chicken and waffles, to fat elvis, to falafel wrap. 

Quiet, clean and nice. Our favorite."}
{"text":"Shopping sprees can leave ones stomach growling and this place happened to be on our path when that happened.  My girls and I walked in and were greeted by numerous employees (love that).  It was quick and easy to order.  We all three ordered a caesar salad.  I wish the girl taking our order would have informed us on the size of the salad especially considering that my girls are 9 and 11 years old.  One salad would have fed all three of us because they are HUGE.  The three salads cost me about $50 (including 3 drinks) which was a little hefty I thought.  The dressing tasted like bottled caesar salad dressing.  Nothing fancy.  The service was fast and friendly but the food was just okay."}
{"text":"I was looking breakfast and found this place on yelp. Glad I did it was really good I have the avocado skillet, grilled cheese and apple donuts. All was very good!!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out. It was on a Saturday afternoon. Parking is in an attached garage. You have to ask for a validation ticket from MTO Cafe. Parking wasnt free but its discounted. Service was good. The cafe was quaint and modern. Now on to the food. I only had a chance to order the Skuna Bay Salmon Burger. It was topped with balsomic aioli, chopped romaine, cream cheese on a potato bun with fries. I thought it was pretty good. The salmon came out moist and the aioli wasnt overpowering. There may have been too much mayo/cream cheese though but it wasnt smothering. The potato bun was nice and soft. I was pretty full by the end of my burger but wish I had room to try more items on the menu. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Great ambience.  Superb location.  Ok food
 
Is this a coffee shop or a modeling agency? Waitresses here are supermodel status, except about  a foot shorter lol

Would def come back."}
{"text":"Yup, all 5 stars for this place. They don't have a freezer here, so all of the ingredients are fresh and in some cases picked up from the farmer's markets. Pretty cool. The taste is delicious too. They use quality ingredients so you end up with quality tasting food. The staff is friendly and able to make adjustments to the menu items based on your dietary needs. Coffee is very good too.

With all the expensive garbage on the strip, it's nice to see a place like this in the improving downtown area. Hopefully downtown will continue to develop and offer another destination to LV visitors. For the time being, Made To Order Café is reason enough for me to visit."}
{"text":"This was a really fun place and the staff was so animated. Rachel was such a great server and had great advice on the menu and options for us. 

I had the KFC and I really enjoyed it. This is Rachel's favorite dish on the menu so I couldn't pass it up. The pancake dippers are bit like French toast dippers in size at all. It's a full piece of bacon with batter poured on it. So I felt dipper wasn't a true rep. 

The music was a bit much for me on volume with all the rest of the visual stimulation though."}
{"text":"Staff is super nice and service is quick! Food is great! Great place to stop by and get a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"5 star breakfast food. Steak and eggs were fantastic, well cooked, mash was awesome. Brioche bread as a topper, tasted like desert."}
{"text":"We'll be back for sure.  Coffee was delicious.  Service was excellent.  Everyone was super friendly.  I highly recommend Fat Elvis and KFC.  We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Wow! This place is fantastic!!!! Went here on a whim after the children's museum and so glad we did. This was one if the better restaurants I've been to in Las Vegas. My kids split the chicken and waffles. The chicken was perfectly cooked and the waffles were delicious. My wife had the Philly cheesesteak with fries and I had the Reuben. The reuben was the best I've ever had. BEST.EVER.SERIOUSLY. It was made with buffalo meat! Yum! Our table also split the apple rings and they were to die for! I don't know how long this place has been here but I hope it does well. I will be bringing all out of town guests here."}
{"text":"Great little spot south of Fremont on main street. I had the fat Elvis.  This is the best stuffed French toast i have ever had. Consists of peanut butter, nutella, banana and crispy bacon. One of those eyes roll back in your head moment.  When i make it back to Vegas going to stop by here and try something else from menu like the chicken fried steak and bacon gravy. Service from Justin was awesome."}
{"text":"Had a Broccoli egg wheat wrap and hubby had Vegan falafel wrap. Awesome food and super heavy. Couldn't finish the whole thing all by myself. Also ordered the special of the day - a risotto appetizer.

Great food in pretty good quantity!

PS: 
Btw, best fries I've had in some in some time. Thin and long- crispy outside and soft inside. Yummm!!"}
{"text":"My Beautiful Wife and I spent the weekend in Las Vegas, celebrating her Birthday and our Anniversary. We were staying in Downtown @ the Four Queens and quite frankly, felt inundated with all of the so-so choices for breakfast. We Yelped and thought that MTO sounded interesting. What a great decision. My wife had the High 5 Stack, very light and perfect pancakes. I had the Kentucky Fried Chicken and I have to tell you that this is Fantastic! Their Hash Browns are excellent and they top these with the best breaded chicken breast that I have had in a long time. Cover that with GRAVY and fried eggs, well I had to go back and have it again this morning.

Very friendly staff and great service. I met the owner today and he is just a warm, genuine and friendly person.

I can't wait to come back as I want to try a Fat Elvis, a Hangover Burger and I can't remember the name of the sandwich, but it has Spam and a Mornay sauce on a Brioche Bun! Wow! What a fresh and innovative menu. I wish you nothing but the best of luck.

Wish we had an MTO in LA.

THANKS, 

Steve"}
{"text":"Food is really fresh and service is friendly! 
Super cute spot across from City Hall :)  If coming for lunch, they will validate parking for 1 hour.  Unfortunately not much outside seating. 

Everything on the menu sounds delicious! Ended up with the Body Builder skillet, with egg whites/chix sausage/broccoli/spinach/onions/mushrooms, and added hash mash for some carb. It was surprisingly tasty and not too salty. They seem to serve breakfast even during lunch which is nice. A bit pricey for what you get (my skillet w/ mash was $13), but overall a really solid lunch spot!"}
{"text":"Bottomless mimosas need I say more ??? 

This place is great. The food was excellent. The menu is not that large but its a small cafe so it matches the environment. The staff is really nice and the place is clean. On a weekday.. Parking is horrible but its worth the little walk for the large amount of food you receive. I will be returning ! .. Come on bottomless mimosas with several types of flavors."}
{"text":"I came here for an afternoon snack while strolling summerlin. It's a clean cafè, however, doesn't give any impression from the outside. But as they always say, \"don't judge the book by its cover\". That's what I did and nothing did change.

I ordered a chicken falafel. The falafel itself is pretty big and could be shared. However, it tasted nothing special. Sad to say, it's too commercialized. I ordered some fries too, which is pretty crispy and good.....You can't go wrong with fries anyway!!

I believe they have a special drink every now and then. I'm not quite sure how often they change or have that. But that day, I had Mango Lemonade, which is sweet and refreshing. However, it also tasted like as if it came from just the concentrates. 

Price is not so bad. I wouldn't come here if you can still wait to find a better place to eat and explore."}
{"text":"The best secrete that Vegas has to offer! Never had better steak and eggs than this place! Enjoyed the arrangement and especially the amazing taste of the drinks and food! Love it! We will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"1 star because the service by the blonde snotty teenage cashier really made me & my boyfriend's experience here poor.  I had to greet her, she looked annoyed that she had to help another customer, and my questions were answered with short, blunt, minimal answers. Needless to say she didn't assist me with anything other than taking my money. Good thing she doesn't work on tips! Food was pretty good, but then I just saw them on Dirty Dining this evening eeeeekkkk! So now I;m seriously not going back. Crappy service and demerits for cleanliness? No thanks."}
{"text":"Why the HELL did I not come here sooner??? DAMN..sustainable organic whatever,man..it's still DAMN good!! Amber took the time to explain the menu, sign ups,etc and Allison and Trevor were a delight..I got the Vegan falafel and my daughter got chicken and waffles and all I can say is HELLA GOOD!! And they're playing kick ass music...all kinds of peeps here. ..I'm digging on this place.."}
{"text":"Great service and yummy food. All of us ordered breakfast and loved our food. It's kind of pricey, but worth it."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches! I got the Reuben - it was really tasty.  It would have been fantastic if it were sliced thinner because it was really tough to bite through. Friends got the turkey melt and the bob.  Both said they were really good.  The pickles are awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Having been to the original location Downtown I was relatively confident that I would enjoy this location as well, I we wrong. We came here for breakfast today, my mom ordered the Kentucky fried chicken and eggs and I ordered the tri tip and eggs with toasted brioche. 

The food took longer than expected to come out and it was with disappointment that I note how little I enjoyed just about everything I tried. The brioche was barely toasted and somewhat cold, the eggs were a soggy mess as were the hash browns and the tri tip was absolutely flavorless. I was forced to douse my entire plate with salt, pepper and chili sauce to give it any sort of flavor whatsoever. My mom's chicken was just as disappointing. The only thing about our meal that I enjoyed was the iced tea which was brewed well and strong.

I have no interest in returning to this location again."}
{"text":"In the area for lunch, I was excited to finally get to try this much-hyped eatery. 

The interior is modern and open with lots of light and very cheerful decor. We were greeted quickly and given the chance to peruse the menus as our drink orders were taken. I was drawn to many of the menu items that were available, so it took a while to figure out what to order. My mom and I opted to share the Kentucky Fried chicken and eggs (gravy on the side) and grilled cheese with brie and honey with walnuts. 

The chicken was great. Lightly battered and not oily. I'm glad she chose to have the gravy served on the side since neither of us cared for it. It was a little too sweet for our taste we skipped it altogether. The hashed browns were great and the eggs were cooked well. I enjoyed the grilled cheese quite a bit. I had hoped for more crunch or char on the bread, but overall the tastes were all very complementary. A little more crunch to the bread would definitely have take this dish to the next level for me. 

Service was great and the vibe was just right. I didn't love the parking situation, but since most people who dine here likely work in the area and walk here, I don't see that being an issue for most."}
{"text":"Please, do yourself a favor and order from this place on Postmates/DoorDash or visit the place during Jury Duty (its a short 5 minute walk from the courthouse). I've gone the past two days and it's been amazing both times. Great service and the quality of ingredients you get for the price is really good for the area. It's a shame it's not open until dinner. 

I had the turkey club sandwich which was very good. Fries were above average as well. The next time I went I had their steak and eggs. The steak was cooked as desired and it was marinated in garlic and other herbs. He eggs were also cooked as desired (a perfect medium, most places can't seem to figure that one out). I feel like I just want to buy stock in this place and just so I can get an employee discount."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend and tried their tomato soap... souurrrrrrrr. We had pancake and omelet too. Omelet tasted fresh and pancake was ok. A little too expensive for what you getting. 
I was just going to leave couple of stars because of the tomato soap but manager surprised us with a \"discount\" for waiting which i didn't think was necessary."}
{"text":"This place was pretty quiet during my lunch time visit but I'm not complaining. Our server took our order after letting me and my friend catch up a bit. We both got the B.L.T.A.E. sandwich. Hope I spelled it right. It was sooo good and filling. Not to mention messy.  I was a little worried about the pesto and egg but all those ingredients combined with your traditional BLT mix made it a well put together combo. I only ate half as it was a monstrous sandwich for a Lil Asian girl like me. Definitely worth worth a revisit for lunch to people watch especially."}
{"text":"Just go! Trendy, reinvented American food. No wait, great coffee. I had the BLTAE. Wonderful! Shoe string crispy fries too! Husband had Kentucky fried chicken. He said it was the best breakfast he's ever had. We parked in the parking deck and they validated the parking. Go. Quit reading other reviews and go!"}
{"text":"Don't try to order off the kids menu unless you can prove you have a child with you. I wanted plain chicken fingers and they don't offer it on the regular menu. Also, I wasn't feeling well enough for a full meal of something else. They wouldn't let me get chicken fingers. Clearly they don't understand that some adults have health issues and can only eat certain foods and/or smaller portions. My husband ordered a burger and a drink. Totaled $17. I really don't think my $7 overpriced, kids chicken fingers should have been a big deal. I am now waiting for Blue Ribbon to open at 11am so I can go get some chicken fingers. I'm sure they will be glad to take my $7+. At many restaurants, I often order from the kids menu when I am not feeling well. NEVER have I been denied food. I always make sure to order a drink and my husband gets a full priced meal to make up the difference. This place just has bad customer service and I won't be back. It's really unfortunate, because I have enjoyed their food in the past. Oh well. Time for some Blue Ribbon !"}
{"text":"I think this place is great!! Was looking for a brunch spot and this was the top rated on yelp-totally didn't disappoint. 

Venue is new and modern. Love that it's attached to a parking structure (so much easier than searching for metered parking downtown) Menu is funky and I love that they have vegan options. 

Vanilla latte-better than Starbucks 

Red juice-I hate beets!!! But I actually found this juice really pleasant.

Chicken waffle sandwhich- the chicken was salty and the grAvy not overpowering. Super good!! And decently portioned, great dish to split so you have room for apple rings!!!

Apple rings- super simple, the best part of my my meal. Next time I will go back just for a latte and apple rings :)"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The menu is fresh, unique, and way better than was expected! The fresh juice is good, but the breakfast sandwiches are to die for! Will def be going back!"}
{"text":"I have enjoyed 2 lunches here and  today I really enjoyed the avocado omelot and the pancakes that were amazing. The service is always excellent. Prices are a bit steep, but all the restaurants at Downtown Summerlin are. I feel that the food here is worth the price."}
{"text":"Love this place for breakfast. When in Vegas or out in Summerlin you best stop in. Good stuff! Very friendly staff - especially in Summerlin."}
{"text":"Outstanding.
Everything was perfect and delicious.
Coffee was exactly to my picky palettes preference.
Lemon poppyseed Pancake was fluffy and moist and toothsome and amazing.
Eggs were over easy and over medium as ordered. Not my usual breakfast experience.
The fried chicken breakfast was Amazing and yes, there is fried chicken in it although the description leaned out out, perhaps assuming you will assume it's included since it's in the name? I've misjudged names so encourage explicit details.
Parking is the lot above and validation makes it free.
Bathrooms are the same clean, spacious, well lit options for both eggs and sausage. ;)"}
{"text":"This was such as awesome find! Sometimes you just get tired of Hash House when in Vegas and crave something fresh and new! This was definitely fresh and new, at least for us! And, OMG this place has vegan pancakes!!! I don't think I've had any pancakes at any restaurant since I went off of dairy 10 years ago, so this was so exciting for me! and they were GOOD!

In fact, everyone in our group was happy with their meals. It was a lot like Hash House, but with many healthier options. But there are still indulgent options for those whose diets were left at home. The portions are definitely comparable to Hash! Non of us could finish, I would probably share my plate the next time we go.  

The location is great too, just a little bit North of the strip. It's worth it to venture off for a good meal!"}
{"text":"Good.  I enjoyed my skillet, and my family enjoyed their meals.  I appreciate the great service and healthy options."}
