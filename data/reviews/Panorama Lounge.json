{"text":"I went with some friends for a birthday on a Friday night and the place was packed ... luckily we booked the restaurant ahead of time or else we would have been sitting at the bar for a while waiting for a table. *phew Overall food experience here was delicious but portions were small and a bit pricey. I guess Panorama was bent more towards tapas style dishes then actual dinner entrées. Regardless, the food was good (chicken supreme & baked halibut) and they all went well together with their array of cocktail drinks. I had no issues with the service and in fact found them to be quite nice. The place is beautiful with a great atmosphere and impressive scenery from the 51st floor. Amazing place to take pictures."}
{"text":"Holy Terrible. My boyfriend and I went to the restaurant for a special occasion and boy was it an occasion.   At first glance, the menu looked quite lovely.  Lots of options for a lady with some dietary needs & a date with a healthy appetite.  Now, we have become quite addicted to both top chefs going on right now, but I don't think it took a genius to realize the *&^# food we were served that night.   It also took approx 15 mins before we were served.   The hostess stood at the front of the restaurant scratching her newly waxed lady area.   And simply acted unprofessional the entire evening.  I switched seats so I wouldn't have to watch her anymore.  Yuck.   Second, the manager stood in the front lobby with a mitt full of cash (the gold ones) like she was some sort of baller.   Again, super unprofessional.   Third, servers congregated around our table to discuss others in the restaurant.   Yes, talk about us, but not where others can hear.  Three strikes before our appies even arrived.   Appies: sesame seed crusted tuna.  bland. boring. and no sesame seeds in sight.  yawn.   next.  crab cakes from a frozen bag of awful.   $20+ dollars worth of terribleness.   Mains: Steak for 32 ridiculous dollars.  again, not inspired at all. the cut of meat was atrocious. the beets were nice. that is it.   tandoori shrimp with a side of bland, cooked in a sock rice.    I don't normally complain - esp when we were about to pay with a gift card but something had to be said for the bubble wrap shrimp and the terrible rice.  The server, who was lovely, insisted on replacing the meal, but I was half way through and not interested in taking the gamble on another dish.  She obviously took the meal off the bill.   Thanks.  Points back to you.   She got a nice tip.  Panorama has a terrible vibe.  I will never return to eat there.  I'd rather pay out the nose at the Hyatt for a city view.    shame shame shame.  we were going to stay for dessert, but decided to spend our cash elsewhere.  See my next post for where I had my actual meal."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place four stars only because of the view. You can sit inside or on the terrace 51 floors up. Food is pretty standard fare.  You do have to pay $5 cover just to eat dinner which makes no sense. Maybe it's for the elevator ride? 51 floors divided by $5... you do the math. Or I'll do it for you - it equals stupid."}
{"text":"On the contrary to Dean L's opinion, Torontos skyline is something to experience and marvel at.  As a Canadian living in San Francisco, I love coming back to my city.  Panorama however is the last place on earth where I will be spending another two hundred dollars.  I wont go into detail as to how horrible our experience was but a brief synopsis :  -The manager David was very rude as soon as we walked in and refused to accomodate our party in any way  -Our server gave us hot sauce to give the bland food some taste and it burnt our tongues and lips to the point they got swollen. -There raspberry iced tea tastes like cough syrup -There was HAIR in the pizza that was ordered and we were still charged for it.  When we spoke to the manager about it he acted like a complete jerk and said you shouldnt of eaten the pizza at all but the hair was found on the last eaten slice -They do not validate parking -There is a cover charge over the weekend -A couple of tourists were making out next to us  All in all as a Torontonian Im very disappointed and what a waste of a night whilst here in Toronto.  The view is not worth the hassle and expense.  It is very expensive and the food is tasteless.  Never again David, you were horrible!  If you really want to burn some money I suggest you taking a lighter whilst sittin on your comfortable sofa at home rather than going through the hassle of going downtown and burning your money at Panorama!"}
{"text":"I agree with another reviewer on here - \"Only giving two stars because of the view.\"  Since we were here for drinks, we thought to order an appetizer to share and ordered the Panorama Platter for $40. Let's just say that if you look up the definition of \"paltry\" - you'll see Panorama Lounge listed right beside it. It could barely be considered an appetizer.  I would highly recommend spending the money elsewhere to eat."}
{"text":"Last minute Mother's Day Brunch Booking.  Thank goodness for www.Eatertainment.com.    Apparently, they only serve Sunday brunch once a year - on Mother's day!    Steps: 1) Buy tickets and paid in advance via www.Entertainment.com 7 days before mother's day 2) Select 11AM or 1:30PM sitting 3) You will get a personal email within 24 hours to confirm your booking  The food was decent - $39 per person (includes tax and tips).  The view was amazing, despite the crazy weather we had this Mother's day!!    I would definitely go back for Mother's Day Sunday Brunch.    ps.  The services was great as well, we brought one extra ticket since one of our relative cannot make it.  They actually gave me a credit of $39.  Very nice of them!!!"}
{"text":"The deal here is that you get an unbelievable view of the city. To get to the restaurant, you take an elevator from the top floor in the Manulife Centre and go up all the way to the 50th Floor where the restaurant is located. The food and service is pretty good, but it's kinda a cheesy place to bring a date, however, it's a pretty dope spot to go for a pre or post drink if you're going to the movies. Now that's a date I can get behind."}
{"text":"Allez-y pour la vue ! Endroit idéal pour boire un verre lors d'une occasion spéciale (anniversaire par exemple). Les cocktails sont bons et originaux mais chers donc prévoir un budget. Attention, mieux vaut ne pas y manger, les portions sont (très) petites pour des prix (très) élevés !"}
{"text":"Great ambiance - though there were many of us there, a lot of young couples were taking advantage of the dim lights, romantic atmosphere and good mix of tunes.  The price, though, did not sit well with me - $11 for a pint of keith's, for instance.  I then ordered a veal and beef dish that was on the \"Main\" item list, thinking that it would be more filling and therefore justify spending a bit extra rather than one of the appetizers.  It was incredibly small and unsubstantial.  They even charged for the slice of cake I arranged them to bring out for my girlfriend's birthday."}
{"text":"Ooooooh Toronto Looks so good from the 51st floor of the Manulife Center.   Relax......Toronto's skyline isnt anything to write home about!   And neither is Panorama.  I dont think Torontonians actually go here.  Probably because of all the horror stories that people hear.  Rumour is that they have such a hard time hiring that they usually get the service industry rejects as employees.    My last experience confirms this rumour.  To make a long story short, the food we ordered never came (because our server didn't know the Kitchen was closed).  And if that wasn't bad enough, our drinks didn't make it to our table either.  We later found  out, that this was our server's first day on the job.  He offered a sincere apology and also bought us our drinks.    But who cares, I cant imagine any reason that I would ever go back.   If your a tourist looking for a good view of the city.  Make friends with anyone with a Downtown Condo, bring a bottle of wine to the roof top terrace and enjoy the view!"}
{"text":"I came yesterday night around 8pm with some friends. I made a reservation but we had to wait for 25 minutes until we get a table outside, with all the downtown view.   The balcony patio where we ate has a very nice view... But don't expect to eat well : food are ok but very very very expensive. Moreover, the service was good but the busboy and the girl at the reception were not smiling at all. Be happy to have a job guys !!!!   Piece of friendly advice : eat before somewhere else. Then, go there for a drink or two, to get the nice downtown view.   Cheers"}
{"text":"Went here about a month ago & just loved it!! Sick views of Toronto, good (albeit waaay overpriced) drinks, and pretty decent service.  After our server decided to just stop coming to our table to re-up the drinks (not the smartest move, considering we tip on every single one), we hightailed it to the bar & just sat there.  Aside from the laughable way the bartender was pouring our beer (totally wrong), it was a pretty solid experience.  Definitely worth checking out if in Toronto, if anything, for the view alone!"}
{"text":"I wanted so badly for this restaurant to hit a home run... sadly it wasn't even close.   The view is spectacular, the service is great, the food is atrocious. Come here for drinks and you'll rate this lounge highly, come to eat and you will be greatly disappointed.   .........  Our server was attentive, polite, and professional. We had made a reservation but were running late- I called ahead and they held our spot no problem. After we stepped out of the elevator it was clear the reservation was unnecessary (the lounge was empty), but this might not always be the case.   The panoramic views of the city are just incredible. The restaurant had a cozy vibe, a high end feel, and an impressive private elevator up to the 51st floor. There is an outdoor patio which almost everyone accessed to take photos.   We ordered three dishes to share- the jumbo tiger prawns with slaw, the pulled pork sliders, and the Barcellona tapas sampler. The prawn platter consisted of two shrimp pieces atop of mediocre, radish and onion-loaded slaw. Not terrible, but for $14 not impressive by any means.   The tapas platter came out next and was nothing short of gross and unimpressive. I'm a very passive person and not very picky with food, but this was one dish that should have been returned to the kitchen. The platter advertised sausage, artichoke hearts, peppers, bocconcini, and olives. It arrived with cold, pickled artichoke hearts, soft, cold, slightly rotten tasting red peppers, cold and lifeless bocconcini balls, mediocre olives, freeze dried NASA-grade melba toast, and three small rows of small, thin salami slices. Disgusting, but I was starving and forced myself to finish.  Our last dish was the pulled pork sliders which also fell short. Seeing as I had enjoyed a delicious pulled pork sandwich at the Mill St. Brew Pub days earlier, I found these to be sadly disappointing. They looked cheap, the bread tasted funny, and the meat was covered in a cheap barbeque sauce. Fail.    Gordon Ramsey would have had a cow. Whoever came up with the claim of an 'Award Winning Menu' was sadly mistaken.   I would only visit again for a drink."}
{"text":"Beautiful decor, awesome atmosphere, semi-expensive prices (perfect for a date night), but the experience I had with the service was sub-par at best. Our waiter was extremely rude and sarcastic to us. We asked to split the check and waited for him to come back to ring us up, and he told us \"Oh, you didn't calculate what it is with tax?\" No, we didn't, because that's your job and not ours. We might as well help ourselves to drinks in the back if that's the case.  I'm sure service here isn't like this on a regular basis, but this one individual who served us treated us like we were an inconvenience."}
{"text":"Yes it is the view that sells the place. I agree go Monday through Thursday, and go early enough so that you can appreciate the sun going down and see the Toronto skyline change dramatically. All the photographers can get on your nerves a little, but the love-seats for two are kind of cool, if you do not mind making out in a \"fish-bowl\"  Certainly \"The Terrace\" on top of the Park Hyatt is a lot more sophisticated, and their \"bar\" menu is adequate if just looking for a light snack/meal with your cocktail."}
{"text":"Only giving two stars because of the view.   Went here with my boyfriend yesterday and can I say how disappointed I am! The drinks took over 30 minutes. I got their panorama frozen cocktail drink and there was nothing special to it & was overpriced. My boyfriend just got a pepsi and it was 4$  with no free refills (the waitress did not say there were no free refills and went on and refilled it anyways so the pepsi was sooooo overpriced!!!)   Going onto the food, the food was ok. I got a pan seared chicken supreme and my boyfriend got the seared tender beef tenderloin medallion. It took REALLY REALLY long for it to come out and by the time it came out, it was not even warm :\ 5-6 hours later I got food poisoning !!! UGHHHH!  After getting the dessert menu, the waitress did not come back for the next thirty minutes to take our order so we decided not to get dessert in the end (WHO KNOWS HOW LONG IT WAS GOING TO TAKE TO GET OUR DESSERT!!).   LAST COMPLAINT, when my boyfriend was paying he was only going to give them 10% tip due to their horrible service. But, the waitress said our debit card did not work after 2 tries. When we gave 15% tip (WHICH SHE DID NOT DESERVE AT ALL) on the third try, it worked. Sketchy much? Hmmmm  I would definitely, absolutely, NEVER come back here again -_-\""}
{"text":"Food is terrible but drinks are pretty good. But I like to come here for its stylish ambience. Both posh and intimate, and you can have amazing 360-degree view of the city at night. Hanging around at balcony is a special experience. Service never fails to meet our standards as servers are really courteous."}
{"text":"Went last night for my best friends birthday. Called on Monday to make a reservation for Friday for 10 people @7pm, was told they were fully booked and to walk in. Ok so we did...   51st floor lounge, I wouldn't use the word restaurant.. The place was empty. We got a table easily with 10 others available. There was only a handful of people and didn't pick up much later on.   Service, sub par.. She was friendly.. But not genuine.  Food was not good at all, wouldn't recommend the food.   Drinks were ok, the summer breeze tasted simply of juice, no alcohol content. The chocolate cream was alright, not what I expected.   Overall the experience wasn't one I would repeat. I would rather dine at the cn tower. And enjoy the food there."}
{"text":"Great view and drinks. Best of all the chocolate fondue with fruits."}
{"text":"The view is beautiful but the service was very very slow. I went after a movie for a quick nightcap and although we were seated quickly, it took longer than it should have to order and receive our drinks. And even longer to request and pay our bill. I'm not even sure we had a server."}
{"text":"Great views of the city.  Can sit outside in the summer and it's beautiful.  Food for vegetarians is decent.  The ravioli is good.  Pizza was too dry.  For carnivores the chicken was supposedly great.  Service was subpar but you are really going for the views.  Can try it out."}
{"text":"The view is the only reason to go this place.1. You will need to pay a $5 'cover fee'-just you know this is place doesn't have the lounge vibe at ALL.2. The food  is basically 'pub food' which includes overpriced quesadillas,burgers and some fish mains=same bad quality. 3. The burgers come with potato chips and they don't even have mustard-I'm taking thy don't have mustard in the kitchen!!!!4.we were 9 and our appetizers and mains came at different time. 4. I had to ask the waiter more than once for my drink 5. The lighting is too bright and the crowd is 99% out of town (from the suburbs or tourists)....so if after these 5 reasons you still want to go be my guest and go ahead and waist your $$$$$ you will be better going to jack Astor's"}
{"text":"The view on the patio of this place (especially the south patio) is stellar, but I would not recommend it for any other reason.   Everything is over priced - the cocktails are $15! And the food is sub par. We had the ravioli and the chicken - both of which lacked in flavour and in size.  The décor leaves much to be desired, and the seating is crammed.  I would recommend going here for one overpriced drink on the patio to soak in the view, and then heading somewhere worth the money to eat."}
{"text":"There isn't much to say about this place that has not already been said, but I feel that the people approach this venue with the wrong attitude, which will almost ensure a unsatisfactory experience.  Panorama is a cocktail bar that has probably the best cocktail menu the city can offer, outside from that, the place doesn't offer much. And it doesn't need to. The reservation policy is simply that you cannot make a reservation here, but exceptions are sometimes given to large parties(only on the assumption on that many drinks will be purchased). It's really up to the Woman who answers your call, and whether they like your voice or not. So...policy is that they cater to money. The place charges you a 5 dollar surcharge for the elevator ride up to the restaurant, and they get away with this because of the word \"lounge\" in their name..which is just about as pretentious as having to give your credit card information to make a reservation. When you get inside, it's really just a restaurant with a balcony overlooking an alright view.  The Maitre'D is just the most snobbish person you're likely to meet, but it's probably all that high altitude air he is subjected to on a daily basis.  I can't imagine why anyone would go there and sit in the restaurant, because it's just like any other restaurant, except they charge you five dollars for entrance. There are two-person lounge chairs out on the patio, and on a summer's night with a light breeze, it's the perfect setting for a romantic date, or just chilling with friends.  The drinks there are not cheap, but very good. I would recommend 'The Panorama,' and the 'Silky White Russian.' The food is mediocre, and usually comes in appetizer portions. But that's hardly their selling point.  Panorama is not a place for a first date, maybe last. It seems there is always a crowd of gossip hungry, impeccably dressed yuppies snouting around in other people's business. The bar staff are rather pleasant. The place is always buzzing on the weekend, and I recommend calling ahead to ensure that the restaurant isn't closed for a private function. I was turned away during TIFF because Clinton was having an exclusive shindig."}
{"text":"The view is probably the only reason to go to Panorama.  I was being shown around Toronto by a friend when I asked about rooftop lounges/bars.  Panorama is basically that.  We paid the $5 cover and were seated fairly quickly outside.  The service was extremely slow.  I'm not sure if we entered right around a shift change, but I doubt it.  We ordered drinks, a lowball manhattan and some girly cocktail.  My waitress looked at me funny when I ordered and asked me to repeat my order because she hadn't heard of a manhattan before.  Regardless, our drinks came out alright.  I could have used a touch more whiskey in my manhattan considering the price, but that tends to be a habitual complaint at most bars.  We also got the triple flavor creme brulee.  It was fairly terrible; do not get it.  The music was also rather techno/house-ish which didn't particular fit the clientele or ambiance in my opinion.  Luckily, the music was only really loud inside and not on the terraces.  The view, so I'm told, is one of the best of Toronto's night skyline.  Personally, I've been spoiled by Chicago, NY, and SF's skylines and rooftop lounges.  I would have liked to be closer to the edge of the building, a bit higher, and could have done without the metal safety bars which are about waist-high.  All in all, it's worthwhile to get some drinks on the outer terrace and spend some time conversing and taking in the Toronto skyline."}
{"text":"I came here with an old friend, looking for a chill place to wind down the evening and have some drinks and dessert. If I just had to review this place as a lounge it would easily get 4 stars for the stunning view of downtown Toronto, and modern and classy atmosphere. The servers were pretty attentive, and the drinks are decent. I ordered a couple different cocktails (each around $14!!!). One was pretty good, I think it was the White Russian, the other called Electric Blue or something like that was a sugary overload, it felt like I was drinking frozen blue raspberry Kool-Aid!  Not enjoyable at all!   However, this place is called Panorama Lounge & RESTAURANT! And for that, it loses a couple stars because the food was not only heinously expensive, but portions were meagre and everything tasted awful. I have had much better lemon tarts purchased in the frozen dessert section at the grocery store! In fact, both desserts we got (lemon tart and some chocolate brownie thing) tasted like they were semi-thawed out frozen desserts.   Given the fact that there are a few other rooftop bars (I love the Roof Lounge at the Hyatt) around this area with just as stunning a view (and similar price tags), but much, MUCH better food and more creative and tasty drinks, I won't be visiting Panorama again."}
{"text":"Ce bar lounge restau est connu pour sa vue panoramique de Toronto. Etant situé au 52e étage vous aurez droit à un repas \"au top\". Attention cependant si vous n'êtes pas fan de l'ambiance classy et chic ce lieu est à éviter. Comptez 15$ le cocktail et 12$ la bière : mais encore une fois, on paie la vue. A faire en été avec la terrasse! PS: amenez y votre \"date\" vous marquerez des points!"}
{"text":"Not my favourite experience in recent memory.  I was excited when I heard out of town friends had decided to make reservations here for dinner especially once I read the reviews about the spectacular view and even some of the notes their various food and drink options  It's located on the 51st floor of the Manulife Centre in/close to Yorkville, so naturally I was anticipating shelling out some extra money for the experience, but with that I also expected the food/service/drinks etc to match.  My disappointment with this place began before I even entered the restaurant, down 51 floors below a hostess awaits guests caring less about whether or not you made a reservation and more about charging you a $5 cover to take the elevator up to the restaurant. Even with a  dinner reservation?! I can imagine this being the case if you were strolling in for drinks, but I found this ridiculous - especially with what was to come.  We arrived at the top and were looking forward to our reservation as my friend had called twice to ensure our reservation was facing the \"good view\" which looks toward the city core (CN Tower, etc) when he mentioned his name at the door, they barely acknowledged him and walked us to a corner on the opposite side of the restaurant - still with a view, but certainly the lesser of the two and not what he had gone to great lengths to ensure our out of town friends would have wanted to see.  After being seated it took a lifetime for our server to arrive to take our drink orders, I saw an Old Fashioned on their cocktail menu and with no description, asked the server how it was made/what bourbon was in it. She starred at me blankly and and said \"I don't know\" and then that was it. Not impressed I asked that she find out and let us know as 2 of us wanted one. She took half the drink orders, disappeared for 15 minutes and then returned to tell us what was in the OF, so I ordered one and thanked her for looking into that for me - blank stare is all I got and no response. When my drink finally arrived I can safely say it was the worst cocktail I've had in recent memory; the serving was about about 1/2 of a typical cocktail, the bourbon was merely a colouring (couldn't taste it), and the balance of the drink was crushed ice, and mostly soda. Very disappointing.  Later in the meal I ordered a glass of white wine and that too came in an Oompah Loompah sized glass, and was much less than a 6 or 8 oz pour - yet still charged a premium.  At first glance their menu was actually very well priced (heirloom tomato salad for $15, entrees ranging $27 a $35) standard for what I would expect, and consistent for what the menu was. For my main course I ordered the Cornish game hen with sweet potato mash and green beans. The presentation was basically a pile of everything and a ladle of gravy - so basically no presentation value, while the Portion size was barely enough for one. Came with half of a cornish hen!! For those unaware a cornish game hen is already about the size of 1/2 a regular chicken, so to receive half of that is basically (once you remove the bones) rendering you less than a quarter chicken - you'd be better off ordering at Swiss Chalet. With these portions being consistent across my friends meals I could see that their TERRIBLE pricing:portion ration was consistent across all menus.  My friend ordered the supposed margarita pizza and it was appalling. No buffalo mozzarella, no fresh basil, whatever cheese that was on it was browned and over cooked - it resembled a frozen pizza. As an Italian Canadian, I was disgusted. for shame.  Lastly, the service (as I've eluded to already) was deplorable. No personality, no conversation, no knowledge of menu, nothing. Just blank stares, short snippy responses and was totally inattentive. Once she dropped off our food (in long gapped stages I might add) she didn't come by to do a quality check until we were done. Even then we got - \"are you done?\" And like a sucker I still tipped 15%  Overall the experience top to bottom was atrocious and there isn't a farts chance in a windstorm that I'd go back, in fact I'd implore you to save yourself the disappointment and avoid this place. If you must go, go for a beer to see the view, take a selfie and get the heck outta dodge.  Eatcrest way wayy WAYYYY out!"}
{"text":"Panorama is a beautiful rooftop Lounge & Restaurant that overlooks the city of Toronto. The ambiance of the setting and scenery are really nice. One side views Toronto city and the other side views partial city skyscrapers and landscaping of greenery.   I came here last weekend of the 20th for a weekend in Yorkville to visit my best friend and to attend a wedding on the island.  Our flight was leaving late Sunday night and came here for a last drink and enjoyed a piece of the chocolate bread pudding cake. The chocolate fondu looked amazing too !"}
{"text":"I live very close to panorama and the theater below (Varsity) is our destination of choice almost every Friday night. I hadn't been to Panorama in a while (and had forgotten how terrible it was) so we headed there this Friday. We paid our ($5) cover and headed to rooftop that was already abuzz with tourists and tweens. Already a little wary, I ordered appetizers and drinks which were thankfully decent enough to light a hope of a decent meal. No such luck - the mains here are beyond deplorable. I orderd roast chicken and my SO got the the steak - both were tasteless pieces of cardboard and mine came with a sauce that suspiciously resembled the dip for the appetizer. When I asked to change it - the hotstess said that the kitchen was super busy and the chef could not be bothered to fix anything (which was the same excuse I had received when I had asked for extra pita for the dip). To top it all, I had a really bad stomach upset the next day. UGH!!! never to be repeated."}
{"text":"***Disclaimer: My boyfriend took me here for a romantic, celebratory dinner, so my review may be influenced by what a nice night I had.***  I think it is really tacky Panorama charges a $5 cover. Right away it makes me feel there is something wrong with it. Yes, I understand people may exploit it for the view, but I still find a cover charge for a supposedly upscale place to be very lowbrow.    We arrived pretty early and only had to wait about 10 minutes for a coveted table for 2 on the patio with the view.  We had: Chicken drummies - These taste like the sauce came from a President's choice bottle. They were very messy and really nothing special.   Carpaccio - Lacking in flavour, but thinly sliced, melt in your mouth beef.   Seared Tuna - This is my kind of meal! However this tuna had a slight bitterness to it. But it was fine. Edible. Not offensive.   We had prosecco to drink and a cocktail that had gin and grapefruit juice that was really nothing special.  Our server recommended the drummies and the gin cocktail.  She was a good server, though I question her palate.   The food at Panorama is fine. Simply fine. The view is spectacular. The ambience is nice. Perhaps if I didn't have such a lovely evening this would have been a 2 star review. I'm not saying skip Panorama, but if you come here, modify your expectations."}
{"text":"5 stars based solely on the location. The view of Toronto's skyline from Panorama Lounge is absolutely breathtaking. Great spot for tourists to stop by and take pictures. I also enjoyed the relaxing atmosphere here."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, this establishment takes advantage of the view, and understands that they can cut corners everywhere else and people will still come. The drinks taste good, but I had 4, and felt nothing (they were like virgin), and 3 would usually be my absolute maximum! The food doesn't taste great and is overpriced. The music was decent the night I came. I guess they should be given credit that when my friend came with a large group of people, she didn't have reservations (and it was a weekend, so it should have been impossible to get it), and she got a table right away (or was this just good luck)."}
{"text":"I really don't know how to write this review correctly because I really didn't get a chance to eat there.   Let me explain  Thursday night my wife and I headed over to Panorama for dinner because we that this was a great place for dinner. Being out first time at Toronto, we added it to our list of places to go to. So we arrived just to be told that they were closed for a private party. But hey, thanks for not bothering to post that information on your website so we could waste money on a taxi ride over there.   Friday night, I decided to cover all my bases and make reservations. Completed the online reservation and went about my day thinking everything was set. Now my wife and I were getting ready for dinner and we receive a call from the manager from Panorama. At this point, it was a little before 7pm and our reservations were at 7:30. The manager called and left a voice mail since I didn't pick up as I was busy getting ready. Well, that voice mail from the manager from informing us that he was canceling our reservations but was welcome to still come by as \"walk in\". Seriously?   We decided to go some place else which ended up being AMAZING! (You can read my other reviews to see where)"}
{"text":"The view of Toronto and The CN tower is phenomenal. Keep in mind from the $5 (after8pm) cover charge to the overpriced food the view is what you are paying for. I had the heirloom tomato & yellow beet salad which at $16 was a great disappointment with little to no goats cheese, two overripe (mushy) slices of beefsteak tomato & one tiny beet cut in chunks. I've had golden yellow beets before this one was a blush pink, tasty but not as advertised. It was also not very well plated for a restaurant. My friend let me try her flatbread pizza which was tasty but not something she couldn't get elsewhere for much cheaper. Her watermelon mojito while refreshing was on the tart side as they did not add any simple syrup. We shared the ice cream cookie sandwiches and overall I had no complaints about them. Some in our party ordered the chocolate fondue & said the melon was off. We had what we thought a good seat by the balcony door so we could see the view and easily slip out for a better look. Turns out this was incredibly drafty. Actually quite windy all night and very cold. When we stepped out onto the balcony we noticed it was not nearly as cold or windy outside as it was at our table. Our service by Max was pretty good. Oddly they do not split bills. Which in the end when you think about it would be a lot less work for them because we all ended up paying separately anyways (which they do allow). So at the end of the night our group of seven had to figure out what we owed individually then pay by debit, credit and cash and the server had a zillion slips of paper and still had to figure out if it all added up."}
{"text":"Super surprised to see the low reviews for this place. I had the most amazing time here with my now husband. We went during the summer months, giving us the opportunity to get a seat outside and a great view of our beautiful city. Our witness was super friendly and came by several times to see if we were doing OK. Our food was OK, but the view made up for it.  Although it is a little high in cost, it is a great place to go to for a romantic dinner."}
{"text":"It has been at least 7 years since I came up to this patio \"in the sky\" and I must say it is still one of the prettier views of the Toronto skyline, facing South. Come here at night, and you get to see the CN Tower in the distance, and on the left side, financial district all gleaming.  You might wonder why I am only giving 3 stars, and the view is the only thing that is getting any stars, as the service is still no good, and the food is no good as well. I just came up here for drinks, and to bring some people up, who have never been. One ordered some appetizers, and most of them came out cold.  From reading the previous reviews, I guess it is lucky I did not pay any $5 cover fee, but if you are visiting the city, and you need a good lookout, come up here, don't eat, just get a seat on the 'outdoor' patio, and enjoy. Hopefully it is not too windy, as I was up here on a very windy night!"}
{"text":"I went here a few times and it was amazing. The view alone was worth it. The drinks and food are extremely pricey up there (pint of Sapporo $11, that's just ridiculous). The only thing that is worth ordering is the nachos, everything else is a rip off. Staff is nice but a little annoying on busy days.  If you decide to go here, I suggest you do exactly what I say, you'll thank me later.  Go to www.eatertainment.com Sign-up to get the VIP Card (you collect points and get 10% off food at Panorama and The Bloor Street Diner).  If you're taking a date there or just going with friends etc... You first go to The Bloor Street Diner located on the ground level of the building. You eat lunch and pre-drink there for a decent price. Beers of Sapporo are $8 here as opposed to $11, 51 floors above you. It's a really nice and cozy diner. When it becomes 5pm, you leave the restaurant and go to the elevators up to the 51st floor. Grab 1-2 drinks each, enjoy the view and lounge style venue. You'll save a ton of money by eating and drinking at the diner. Plus, your food is 10% off and you receive points. Both the diner and panorama are elegant, classy and mature places so the transition between them both will be unnoticeable, except for the view and menu prices.  It's the perfect place to go on a date or have a meeting.  Hope this helps!"}
{"text":"came here again this time in summer to check the balcony patio and night view to the city.  thursday night after 11pm was pretty packed (only on the balcony though). but they immediately had a spot for two. they don't take reservations for the patio and they can only accommodate up to 6 people outside. the staff was somehow not very friendly and attentive and there were too many ppl who behaved like tourists on CN tower - posing and taking pictures of each other through the whole time we were there. but it's worth coming here for the experience."}
{"text":"You come for the view!  Terrible service, terrible food, ridiculously overpriced. Have one drink here and eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"I was visiting Toronto for meetings, and my clients insisted we go here for dinner.  They wanted to show me the Toronto skyline.  And the view was beautiful...but the food was HORRIBLE.  Like, one star horrible.  The only reason I awarded 2 stars is because of the view. Is it expensive?  Yes.  But I knew it would be...we were at tourist central, where it's gimmicky.  I was okay with that.  However, the food was on par with airplane food.  I am not kidding.  There was one vegetarian option, spinach ricotta manicotti.  I don't normally eat things like that, but it was my only choice, so I ordered it.  I have had almost this exact same dish on American Airlines, and I have to say that pre-prepared airplane food was better.  Ugh. So the food was expensive, and it was BAD.  I will just echo everyone else's sentiments...come for the view.  Don't eat the food."}
{"text":"Visited on Sat Nov 22 at 9pm. They charge $5 per person to come up, not sure why is this place a club? The bartender is also the DJ so they were playing top 40 when we came in. Music was a bit loud to talk. The views looking North and South are still amazing and worth coming up here.   We just had drinks, a bit pricey but expected for the area and the view. Didn't get to try the food. If they eliminated the cover charge it would encourage me to come back again."}
{"text":"Judging from most reviews here, this is a horrible place to come in for a group celebration especially on a weekend. My experience here was for 5 of us on a pretty quiet week night (no cover) which seems to be the best time to come visit here. 2 of my group were visiting the city and Panorama was a great place to take them so they could literally see most of the city on their 2 day trip. And that view is simply amazing!  Now I missed the dinner portion of the evening and joined for dessert and drinks. It's tough to call this place overpriced because it is a prime bar/lounge in the city close to Yorkville so I don't think complaining too much about the price is very warranted as cheap drinks and similar ambiance's can be experienced at so many places around the city. I ordered a mojito ($12) and a warm peach cobbler with ice cream (around $10) and both were great, especially my peach cobbler which came out in 3 separate fried dim sum-like pieces with ice cream on the side. Very delicious. My table mates got the chocolate brownie for 2 I believe which had a larger bowl of ice cream, strawberries and tiny cups for caramel dipping. I'm not a massive brownie fan as they just seem to overwhelm me as a dessert and this tasted extremely dense and heart stopping but that's what people want in a brownie I presume?  Our server was very friendly and always around asking us if things were all right etc. I giver her extra points for convincing the kitchen to dish out our desserts as they had closed around 15-20mins by the time we ordered and I doubt that was just for the extra tip as gratuity was already added on to our bill.   Overall a very pleasant but expensive experience and I can definitely see myself coming back here some time in the future."}
{"text":"Came here for Nye party. I wasn't exactly hyped about this event because I just spent $50 to go upstairs.. So the night boiled down to these three things - extremely loud music, booze and AWESOME staff. I didn't come for the food, I came for the party!  This place is a good one to take your significant other, be it a birthday or anniversary. Although the view isn't that of CN Tower awe-ness, it definitely isn't shabby for a casual date.  Staff - they were absolutely excellent, from coat check to bartenders. They were so friendly, I had the shivers talking to them. If you do plan on going, make sure you get a hold of Richard (Asian gentleman). He was so good to our group, bringing us the drinks while on the dance floor!  Unfortunately, I can only give this place 2 stars for the following reason - price. It's ridiculous to have to pay $50 for a ticket which was probably the elevator ride up to the 51st floor and one complementary cup of champagne. The rest of the drinks were paid for on my visa. Highly doubt I'll be coming back, even for the next NYE party.. With the money I spent on drinks + the view, I'd rather go back to CN Tower and pay a little bit more!"}
{"text":"We came here late on a Saturday night against my better judgement. The food was awful; absolutely awful. We had this platter of h'ors devours which seemed like a few things picked up at the grocery store in the AM that had gotten stale by the evening. To add insult to injury they changed an ungodly sum for this platter of assorted stale snacks. The chocolate cake was all icing and left much to be desired. Alcohol was also marked up significantly more than other local bars.  One redeeming quality was the service. Our waitress was very attentive and friendly. I was quite surprised given the location. Crowed was typical Yorkville but I think there was more tourists."}
{"text":"I don't think many Torontonians know (or maybe care?) about Panorama. I mean, we rarely look up as we're more focused on what's in our general eyesight. I had heard about this lounge from some people in high school. I was thinking of something special to do for my bf's birthday and I suddenly remembered about this place.  The view was spectacular and that was the main reason for being there. I didn't have to pay the $5 cover charge I've seen mentioned in other reviews but I was there right after work (around 6:30pm) so I'm not sure if that made a difference. I knew the food and drink would be expensive so I had made dinner reservations elsewhere. We each ordered a drink each. They were nothing special though; I've had better drinks. We were running late for our dinner reservations so I asked for the bill; can you believe 2 drinks came up to $20+ ? My rating is for the view alone; otherwise, the city has so many other restaurants to offer."}
{"text":"Honestly, came here and reasonably occupied for a Wednesday night.  It's not my first time, but the one thing I like about Panorama is the vibe. You don't feel like you're in an over-the-top restaurant, or a seedy bar. The staff is friendly and you can actually meet people, have a beer, and relax.  I'd say the 5th star is missing because, honestly, it's a little pricier than it should be. Obviously I'm not expecting anything cheap, but after tax and tip... well... they should make the place a little nicer.   Otherwise, fanatic view of Toronto at night, and a good bar selection. We came at 11.00, so a little late to review the food."}
{"text":"Noticed a lot of the reviews below mentioned not to come here for the food. Therefore, we did not. We just came here to see the spectacular view of the Toronto skyline and for some drinks. Very upscale place. Chic ambiance with some chill/house music playing in the background (my favorite), we loved it! We sat outside for a bit to admire the view, but it was freezing and quite windy so we went back inside. We had a couch to ourselves and just lounged. It wasn't packed the night we went which was nice. That could have made the Panorama Lounge experience go sour being that this place can only hold so many people! Would I return? Well, absolutely!"}
{"text":"Beautiful Views! Great food ( has improved in the past few years) very good good cocktail selection. Busy even in a Monday night! Love this place! One of our fave spots for date night :-)"}
{"text":"The view is amazing! the decor is nice. I like the underground parking, so I don't have to step a foot outside and ruin my shoes :)  What I don't like is that the menu keeps changing every time I come here! why?? why you keep taking away the things I like and keep making the menu worst and worst every single time!???  The drinks are great!! so come for drinks, but not the food! I love the couch seats at the back for groups, will fit only about 8 people, its a nice little private area!  Also I wish the waitresses would come around more often, I always see them standing around the bar chatting."}
{"text":"On y va pour en prendre pleins les yeux et ca marche! Vue sur la CN et les buiding du financial district on n'hésite pas à jetter un oeil dehors entre chaque gorgée du martini qu'on a payé bien cher pour admirer la vue!  parfait pour passer un bon moment entre amis mais c'est un budget a prévoir et encore plus si vous souhaitez y manger!"}
{"text":"Beautiful view, must see at least once every season! ( good excuse to keep coming here haha)   The knowledgable staff, chill deep house music and modern decor makes this a good place to stop by!   Come here during the week an hour before sunset to see the skyline of the city change, you will be more excited about it when you have some alcohol in ya haha  Wasnt too hungry but my friend and I ordered some spring rolls and chicken flatbread, glad they were small portions or we would've been too stuffed to drink. Apps tasted good :)  We got pretty buzzed, he ordered vodka tonic( multiple orders and double shots) and I got this tasty dessert like drink called the White Russian. It tasted so good! like a vanilla milkshake.   Great spot for drinks, nice view and good conversation."}
{"text":"Aside of the view, this place doesn't have much to offer. The food is definitely overpriced and not really worth it. The vibe is ok and the service is just fine, at least during week nights."}
{"text":"Come for the view, stay for the service.  The view here is great. No doubt about that. It's perfect for tourists or a romantic date.   I came here with three others last weekend for a birthday dinner. I missed most of the dinner, but had a few apps and a few glasses of wine.   I wasn't overly impressed with this place. I feel like the patio area we were seated at was super cramped, all the tables were really close together.  The nachos we had were just okay. The wine was about 8 or 9 at the LCBO, but cost us 50 here. Holy overpriced.   The service was great, except I wasn't too fond of the server's outfits..if this is a classy joint, why are they wearing hoodies..  Overall, I'd rather prefer to go to the Thompson Hotel rooftop patio. You can smoke anywhere there, and it has a 360 view (walk around the bar) and I like the cocktails there better."}
{"text":"came here for some drinks with friends after dinner.  so you enter via the manulife center, get into this elevator that fits five people packed like sardines in a can, zooms upwards to 50th floor in 3 seconds (yes there's some ear popping, stomach flipping), and you enter this one room filled with glam people, glass walls, white couches, and chandeliers.   the patio is kind of nice. you can see really far away but the night i was up there it was kind of windy and cold.   my impression - very expensive drinks, and a bit snobbish. think i'd rather go somewhere else."}
{"text":"This place is a gigantic waste of time and money.  Came here because of all the hype during a friend's birthday - a lounge 52 floors above the ground? Sounds cool, right? First of all - you're a lounge/restaurant.. I don't know why they charge cover, do they not make enough money? The girl taking cover looks absolutely miserable - well, I'd be too if I was just sitting there in the cold lobby beside the elevator taking money from a inconsistent stream of people. The service is not great up at the restaurant.. the servers didn't come and greet us for about 5 minutes, and then when we sat down, they didn't come back for over 10 minutes.  I didn't end up getting anything because the drinks were super overpriced and when they came, the glasses must've been for elves .. how small can they get? The only good part of this restaurant is the one side with the view.. however, if you don't have a table on that side, it's really awkward squeezing past everyone to take panoramas for your instagram.   Don't think I'd come back here."}
{"text":"You won't come here for the service or the food, you'll visit this place for the view, and that's about it.    Stopped by here on a Thursday night after work for drinks with a friend.  We arrived fairly early and there were plenty of empty seats on the outdoor terrace, however, since there were only 2 of us we were told that the vacant tables were reserved for groups of 3 or more, so we would have to wait for a table for 2 to be seated outside (which was the ONLY reason we decided on this spot).  So, we went to the bar, and ordered a drink, well, we didn't order a drink right away, because it took the bartender FOREVER to make her way over to us to take our drink order...seriously, there was no one in the place and it took over 20 minutes to actually get a drink.  Once we had our drinks, it was time to wait, and wait, and wait for our table to become available.  Our total for 2 drinks was $32 dollars!  SERIOUSLY!    FINALLY about 30 minutes after we arrived we were escorted past a row of empty tables (for 3-4 people), to our table.    The view really is spectacular.  We sipped on our drinks and then waited for our server to ask us if we were interested in ordering any food, which we did.  We ordered their nachos with chicken...BLECH!  The nachos can best be described as a small plate of nachos topped  with shards of chicken pieces, a smattering of black beans, and a bright orange, gummy, gelatinous substance, which I am only assuming was cheese,  Their nachos (and I'm using the term rather loosely here) also came with a side of salsa, guac and sour cream.  The guac was the only thing worth eating, though I suspect it was store bought as it was the best tasting thing on the plate and I doubt it came from the same kitchen that could produce something so disgusting as the nachos.  We ate the nachos, snapped a few pics, paid our bill and left...never to darken the doorstep (rather elevator) of this establishment again."}
{"text":"Pretention, deluded self-importance with a side of so-so food, horrifying service and a beautiful view!  Visited this restaurant on a Sunday night . . . was virtually deserted upon arrival but filled up nicely by the time we left (10pm). The only thing this place has going for it is real estate, with service being absolutely among the worst I have ever experienced. 15 mins went by without even so much as a nod from the waitress. Appetizers (weak Cesar salad, average \"Loblaws\"- style dips and a not-bad won ton dip) came out in about 20 mins but then the real waiting game begins . . . . My husbands medium steak was debatably well-done, my squash ravioli was not bad and a good size. Others at the table had chicken lasagna, tiger shrimp and pineapple pizza. The reviews were mixed and I thought the lasagna looked a little too previously-frozen for my taste. To be honest all this wouldn't have been so bad but the waitress or cook staff or whoever managed to execute my biggest restaurant pet peeve . . . bringing out 3 out of the 6 dishes before the other 3 are ready. So we just sit around as our food gets cold waiting for everyone to be served . . . and waiting and waiting while other people in the restaurant get their food. It really just burns me up.  Anyways, I know this isn't really a place know for its stellar cuisine but more for the drinks and view, both of which were great and lived up to expectations.  I would come back here for drinks only."}
{"text":"Finally decided to come to Panorama since I live 2 blocks away and wow, what a view. Late nights it does become a bit more upscale even on a Wednesday night and I felt a \"little\" out of place with jeans on.  I generally really liked the place, made some great mixed drinks that didn't disappoint after watching a bar tending competition. Only thing was the music selection, which didn't fit well in my mood. I'd expect them to tone down the beats by 1 a.m. and play some more ambient mellow house."}
{"text":"Beautiful view compensates for their mediocre food.It's not a restaurant so I didn't expect anything special, but.. The food could be better. Their cocktails were good though, and we could take them out to the patio. Prices are about average, not expensive at all."}
{"text":"The view is cool, but the service was lousy and the food is overly-priced.  they also have a $5 cover charge - for what reason i dont know?  the 360 restaurant on top of the CN tower is much better - even though it is more expensive, at least the food is decent and the service is good there!  dont waste your time or money at Panorama."}
{"text":"Lots of money for a view.  So crowded upstairs, drink prices high, impress a good prospect, conveys you're important to me."}
{"text":"Was here for a work dinner (read: not concerned about prices) and got the Lobster Mac. If you are a little buzzed and are looking to sober up before bed, AND gain 5 pounds in the process, GET IT! People at the table couldn't stop stealing from me."}
{"text":"amazing views. service is usually pretty bad. food is decent. best for drinks and apps. their menu has moved to a small plates menu. great, again for sharing and as apps with drinks. Their seating is relatively low to the ground. definitely a trendy feel."}
{"text":"Great view; mediocre  food. What can I say? Bartender is decent."}
{"text":"So despite my earlier and somewhat critical review I have actually been to Panorama about ten times now. Why, you ask? The view from the north and south facing patios are just fantastic and thus it is a great place to bring visitors. The last few times I have been pleasantly surprised at the great service provided by the servers. Yes the place is pricey and the food and drinks are expensive. But I don't know another place that quite serves the purpose it does in the city. It is a lovely place for a patio drink where once can admire the Toronto skyline and the ambience and decor are great. Just one drink though...I can't pay $17 dollars for a cocktail twice in the same night."}
{"text":"One star for the view and location. Yah, that's already kind of me.  Where do I begin? My friend had reserved a table for 18 of us for a birthday dinner. We were informed they needed the table back by 8:45. When we got there, they gave us a corner area by the bar with a large coffee table and we were told that was our dinner area? Are you kidding me? The hostess was not helpful. Then the manager was involved and had a table set for us but we were told that we'd ahve about 75 minutes for dinner. We were definitely sure with their service at that point, they wouldn't be able to serve 18 of us in that time frame.  First we had the dinner table problem. Secondly, the original waitress was not happy that we were moving to the table where she wouldn't be serving us so asked us to settle the tab right away instead of asking for 2nd round of drinks. Thirdly, in the middle of sorting out the dinner table, another server pointed out we brought our own cake so there will be a service charge. Really? You're not even serving us and you're telling us you charging us for the cake when we were already calling other resaturants in the area for their availability?  If we didn't have other plans for 9ish we would have left by then.   Food and drinks were very much forgettable. Honestly, if they had a more exciting menu, i would have ordered more than an appetizer.   Our waitress at the dinner table wasn't the brightest. Most of us had drinks, the few that didn't want alcohol had asked for water. She came back, forgetting who asked for water when she could have just brought everyone water (which we suggested at that point). She was very polite, but just not on top of things. At one point before the food came out, our party wanted to order more alcohol,  and no wait staff could be found. Oh actually, we found some of them in the back area drinking and talking to each other. This was 8:30 and their patrons capacity was about 40%. Really? You guys make that much that you don't want to serve at 8:30 which is probably still early for your shift? I'm sorry, I went through my waitressing days and this is disturbing at Panorama at this price point.  By the time I left the clientele was getting interesting. One would say there were guys who brought their hot girlfriends/wives in skimpy outfits. If you asked the wrong person, they might say those hot women were escorts. I can only comment that they were hot  ... I'll give them that much. Not sure the role they were playing last night. Ask around for yourself and make it an evening there if you want a place with a city view, peopple-watching with terrible service and crappy cocktails, and boring food menu."}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend. When we arrived we had to ask the taxi driver where it was located because we couldn't find signs for it. We then discovered that it was located in the mall... Next, we took a tiny elevator up to the 50 somethingth floor which was a very claustrophobic experience. When we arrived, (after the five dollar cover charge to take the elevator for EACH of us), we discovered that the inside of the restaurant did not provide the classy experience that we were hoping for, and expected from the website. The only good thing about this restaurant was the view. It was unfortunate because the drinks were at an average of 13$ each, which I would have been more inclined to pay for if the restaurant didn't look so tacky. The floors were the same as they were in the rest of the mall, and there was a dirty feeling overall. Don't waste your money and your time. Find somewhere else to go. I don't even believe the view was worth going."}
{"text":"I obsoletely loveeee this place !! The view is Amaizing, nice place to have a couple of drinks and enjoy company of friends  One thing is it gets really packed, hard to get seats with the nice view"}
{"text":"Came here twice, once to celebrate my birthday and then my friends. It's beautiful view from the terrace, specially during sunset. We had couple of appetizers and pizza that was good but nothing that impressed me. The prices are really high, and people are so dressed up. This is a place where you can take your date to show off."}
{"text":"It's good at Panorama.  There is pretty much only one reason you come here. It's the view. It's gorgeous and on a great evening you get a great shot of the Toronto skyline.  Drinks come at a premium but I figure it's what you pay for having that breath taking view.  When I was there the staff was a bit slow on a slow night but I did have an alright time here. Definitely date-worthy territory here and on a weeknight it isn't crowded.   I probably will come back here in the future to check it out again."}
{"text":"I feel that this is one of the most over-hyped places in Toronto, and I am glad that its Yelp rating is somewhat in line with my experience.  I went around 9 PM on a Saturday with a friend and my girlfriend.  We chose this place because she had heard a lot about it, and it's right beside her apartment.  Cover charge: $5 on Fridays and Saturdays.  This is fairly standard for lounges, no complaints.  The place was rather full: all of the table were taken, and we waited at the bar for people to leave.  Turns out, if you want a table, you need to make a reservation.  This is probably especially true if you want to sit on the \"good\" side: the side where you can see the CN Tower.  You get a decent view of the tower from the bar, and it's really nothing spectacular, especially if you have been to other cities like HK, SH and NY; or even cities not known for their skylines such as SF and Tokyo.  After a few drinks, a table opened up, and it was on the \"bad\" side, no surprises.  The bad side has a truly terrible view, as there was absolutely nothing to see.  Onto the drinks, the beer selection they had were minimal, and they were out of the stable Toronto brew: Steamwhistle.  I ordered a few glasses of wine, and tried a lot of the cocktails my GF had ordered.  Most of them were uninspired and insipid.  In particular, the Toronto Long Island was especially bad.  However, I think there was a creamy Banana drink that was quite creative and worthy of praise.  The ambiance and decour were nice, and the music volume was comfortable so that a conversation was possible without needing to shout excessively.  Our waiter was attentive and gave helpful suggestions when needed.  Overall, we still had a lot of fun, but I wouldn't attribute much to this venue.  If you have a friend coming in from out of town, this place might be a decent choice, but be sure to reserve a table ahead of time!"}
{"text":"The music here is TERRIBLE. Seriously, if you put on some David Guetta (who I don't even like that much), I would be happy because that slow music gives me a headache.   As others have said before, the panoramic view is obviously breathtaking, gorgeous, mesmerizing, etc (everything along those lines). Five dollar cover to go up, which is great, even if you're not going to order anything. Service was REALLY slow and they didn't even offer water to start off. The drinks are super pricey but that's expected at any club/lounge but the drinks were really weak. The scene was also pretty weak because, assuming most people were tourists, everyone was in their own social circle. Most people were dressed up but don't be ashamed if you come here looking casual.   The whole place actually has a luxurious ambiance with nice chandeliers and sofas but there is no lounge feel to it. Definitely come here for the view but skip the food & drinks."}
{"text":"I loved my experience at Panorama. It's always a nice place to take someone on a romantic date or to chill with your friends after dinner for drinks and desserts :) I'm also really happy that they open so late (usually until 1-2am). Btw, they are opened everyday from 5pm to close! Definitely a great place to hang out after work.  Breathtaking view on the 51st floor. Even if you're not seated at a window seat, you're welcome to venture out to their patio to have an even better view of our city! Pricey place to dine but definitely worth the view. They are in the heart of Toronto, so expect everything to be pricey lol. And their customers are based on majority business people.  From reading the reviews, dinner service doesn't seem to receive that good of a feedback :/ I remember coming here on a late Monday night recently and it did seemed short staffed. But our server, Richard, was fantastic. He was very professional and was very pleasant to talk to :) He came to check on us from time to time to see if we needed anything else.... even though he was so busy running around, dashing in and out of the kitchen, and juggling plates on both hands!  The lobster mac and cheese is definitely a must order. The best one I've ever had so far in Toronto. Drinks and desserts are standard... but still satisfy my cravings :)  I'll definitely come back again, despite the bad reviews! Ooo and thank you for hosting the most awesome NYE party of 2014!! Although tickets were $50 to get in, great DJ music, fun crowd, amazing service from beginning to end :) Cheers to another great year!"}
{"text":"Amazing view of the city. Recommend going mid week when there aren't many people there. Ultimate romantic venue for a date or to take someone that is new to the city. Much cheaper than CN tower and view is just as good if not better because you can see entire downtown with CN tower one way and all uptown on the other side of the value."}
{"text":"The best part of this place was the romance.  So I wasn't there with a date and instead with two friends but the couples that were there looked like they were having a ball. That is before the wind really picked up and coulpes starting moving inside.  Here's my really quick run-down: Pros: great view, great atmosphere, unique Cons: windy, expensive, a $5 dollar cover charge at a restaurant...What?!  Go if you haven't ever been or if you boss is paying."}
{"text":"Go.  -1 star because: the food could have been better for the price, and their wine list is for pansies.    +4 stars because: the view will make anything romantic, and the place is chic."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came here last night for drinks. We sat at the bar, since we were not having dinner, just drinks. We ordered drinks and I asked for the wi-fi password. The manager came promptly to tell me the wireless was for administration only. My internal dialogue went as follows: Oh really? Why is it called panorama guests?  But I politely smiled and thanked him and told him it was not a problem. I was prepared to use my 3G to check-in when the server came to provide me the password, as another server had informed her what it was. Now she, really does her job exceptionally well.  The bar itself is small but we had a great spot, could check out the view from the top and enjoyed our drinks as we clinked glasses a few times that night."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for 20 years and never get tired of this place. Yes,  the food is average, the drinks are over priced, but the service is great and the view is spectacular. Personally, I liked the vibe here better when it was a piano bar back in the 80's, but times change. This is the best place in Toronto to catch a sunset, or a nice place to start or finish your evening.  This place is just a menu change away from being rated 5 stars in my book!"}
{"text":"I came here on a weekday night and we were seated immediately. It was very busy when we left. The food was mediocre and the drinks were ok.   Outside patio is spectacular. Simply blissful. It's got one of the best views of Toronto skyline. Bring a jacket during spring and fall.   It is also a bit away from the noisier music inside. You can have conversations with your date (or friend) and hear each other. Strong wind may interrupt your conversations once in a while, knocking off things on the table.   I ordered a skewer which was bathed in grease. We ordered drinks, cocktail and coffee. We were not in a hurry so I can not complain with the pace.   The service maybe slow but the servers are way nicer than Canoe. This is a less pretentious place than Canoe. This is a place to relax and have a great noisy conversation. Yes, noisy conversation. You have to speak louder in order to be heard.   I will come back here. To bring a date. Or a friend. Or something in between."}
{"text":"Okay yes the view is amazing.  BUT the food was very lackluster and the service was really really bad.  We had made reservations for a group of 13 inside the restaurant.  When we got there, they shoved us in a corner and expected us all to sit around a coffee table that could only accommodate 8 and very uncomfortably at that. When we asked for the proper table for dinner that we had reserved, they claimed we were out of luck because WE had made a mistake when reserving.  What???  Keep in mind the restaurant inside was almost empty.  Finally, after a lot of discussion, we got a table.  It took forever to get food and the server, who had zero personality, couldn't even seem to be bothered to get us drinks.  All in all, I am never coming back."}
{"text":"Might be a little expensive, but the view is so nice if you can get a table on the balcony. Took my wife to here for our very first date and now we are married."}
{"text":"I came here few month ago with my friends who visited Toronto from NewYork. I really like to show them Toronto's beautiful night view. We order pints of draught beer and some snacks that I usually order. I also asked for cold water. I already know they serve water with a short straw and wedge of lemon or lime in, but the server just serve  us water and her attitude to serve the glasses of water seemed so rude. I looked around other tables and found out they all got served water with straw and lemon. For the snacks, she served cold one which had been a while since it's cooked. I couldn't take it this time, so I complained it with the server and she excuses that's how it's served. Do you think I am idiot? I can tell which one is cold snack or not!! I've never got the food like that in Panorama Restaurant!! Eventually, she didn't get us a new one. She kept saying change order!! How disrespectful!! I hope she is not a racist, that 's just who she is. I will never come back. I would not recommend here anyone."}
{"text":"Great view from the 51st floor, you can see all of Toronto from a birds view. Can go out on the balcony as long as it isn't too windy, but breathtaking feeling.  Great ambiance - upscale, intimate or for groups, feels like you are on top of the world.  Service - is decent, nothing exceptional or bad I can remember.  Menu - mostly appetizers and a vast drink selection, a few entrée items and not much in the seafood or vegetarian options.  Overall I think Panorama is a restaurant you have to visit atleast once, especially if you are not from Toronto. It is the perfect place for a special occasion or with someone special."}
{"text":"A great place to grab a drink and enjoy a view of Toronto! You have to go through some escalators of a building and into some random corner where you take an elevator, but then you enter a nice lounge with huge glass walls on both sides.   I came at around 10 pm on a Monday night (who goes out on Mondays #selfiesong) and it was pretty empty. My friend got a very sweet chocolate drink and some food and I got a ginger fizzy whiskey drink. It was strong and delicious. After we warmed up a bit from the alcohol we braved the cold outside and took pics on the patio. On a clear night, downtown core is beautifully aglow.   Recommended to be my one of my friends from Toronto and I'd definitely recommend it to anyone visiting!"}
{"text":"I come here for the view when I want to just chill with a friend or two.   The ambience is always upbeat and quite busy and loud. I like the energy and I'm always in good company so its fun. The patio is beautiful, especially at night and would be a really nice place for a date if you can get a nice spot outside. Its annoying that they don't take reservations on weekends though - you have to either go early or grab a few drinks at the bar before you can get a seat at the patio. I don't mind but its a lot louder at the bar than it is outside so it depends on who you're with and what kind of atmosphere you are looking for.   Food is okay, I would not recommend coming here for dinner unless you know you are having dinner purely for the view as you can definitely get better food elsewhere. Drinks are good, bottles are the same price as anywhere else comparable so its a nice place to just chill on the couches on the patio over a few glasses of wine.   Service is okay, I find they kind of just leave you but always pop by just as you need another drink. Overall a great place for a drink and view :)"}
{"text":"2.9 Stars:  I am writing this one basis of a SINGLE weekday experience at Panorama:  1.  First impression:  51st floor of downtown building (South building of a pair).  Overall impression is that it is more of a lounge than restaurant.  Dimmer lighting, dark colours.  Tables lining both north and south facing windows for views of city.  This is primary reason for this restaurant , I am assuming.  2.  Host:  Very friendly.  Seated us along window near back.  3.  Staff:  Assuming dress code; mostly female wait staff, dressed in white, certain physical characteristics in common.  Took several minutes for them to approach us, despite restaurant being underpopulated.  Very friendly service, however, somewhat concerning regarding initial time of contact.  4.  Drinks:  Both alcoholic and non-alcoholic.  Standard.  Tasty preparation.  5.  Food: Ingredients tasted slightly old; some use of flavours and well seasoned in both appetizers and mains.  My impression that the meals spent a little time under a heat lamp.  Uncertain.  Portions adequate to generous.  6.  Dessert:  N/A.  7.  Exit/Cost: Cost was reasonable, given location of restaurant; some dishes too expensive for what you receive.  Overall:  My impression is that this is a hybrid restaurant/lounge that is more lounge than restaurant, given appearance of staff and overall lighting and furniture design.  Reduced stars for service.  My impression is that this lounge/restaurant is geared towards clientele with specific needs and wants more of a lounge feeling.    Thank you"}
{"text":"We all come here for the view and not the food but that needs to change. Order the Lobster Mac & Cheese and you will know what I mean. This baked dish has hint of dill and crusted topping that gives your palette both a fun flavor kick and a welcoming texture balance to the creaminess of the cheese. Paired with a Light wine you wont want to leave. The staff is courteous and entertaining though it would probably be better suited for the host staff to have personal conversations about financial issues and eviction notices in private rather than in earshot of the customers. They did however encourage us to step out onto the balcony with our drinks while they prepare our meals to further enjoy the Toronto Skyline which was a nice change of pace during the evening.  Must try fellow Yelpers."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night with a group of friends for a birthday, and had a great time. The cover was only 5 dollars per person, which is not bad at all. The best thing about this lounge is the spectacular view of the Toronto skyline, unfortunately it was little foggy the day we went but my friends still managed to get great pictures. The drinks tasted great...but pricy, the bartenders were friendly. Tried the pizza and bruschetta appetizers they were okay, but not really worth the price. Good place to bring visitors and people new to Toronto for the view of the skyline, but would skip on the food."}
{"text":"Great place to chill at night! Located on the 51st floor, you get a great view while you enjoy your the companionship of your friends/date. And as far as the food items go, items are pretty much fusion or nothing out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"The view is spectacular...  Let's just get that out of the way.   Obviously that's the draw.  Big open windows on both sides of the top (50th) floor of the Manulife center and you can see it all.  An almost 360 view of the city and its burbs. Oh yeah, and you can drink while you gape at the cityscape.  And they have good drinks too.  Yeah, they are a little pricy, but it's nice to have a champagne cocktail while looking at the city lights.   Don't ask me about the food.  I wouldn't go to eat there anyway. Depending on what you're looking for, you may want to take or leave my next piece of advice. If you aren't looking for your regular obnoxious, generic, wannabe chic, club atmosphere, then stay away from this joint of Friday and Saturday nights.  There is a cover fee on top of the overpriced drinks and your experience will go along with all the garbage that comes with \"da club\" scene.  Lame music played too loudly for anyone to talk, no available tables, lines and long waits for drinks... etc... If what you are looking for is a nice, chill place with a wicked atmosphere to have a drink in and marvel at the city skyline... then go on a weeknight and have a nice relaxing and unique evening.  No cover charge and its usually very low key during the week with great service. They have a terrific patio in the summer too... For an ever more intimate experience with a great view, try The Roof Lounge on the 18th floor of the Hyatt."}
{"text":"Servers were rude. Food was not great and the decor needs to be replaced. For that price I shouldn't be sitting on peeling Ike's furniture."}
{"text":"WORST experience ever I personally had in any restaurant I have been in.  NEVER GOING BACK.  It was my gfs birthday and thanks to one of the servers and a grumpy old manager (Nicolas) who acts more like a bouncer than a manager my gfs birthday almost got ruined. As we walked in, one of the servers/hostesses walked towards us sipping on a Starbucks coffee and did not even look at us properly or smiled at us while asking for my name. Next, she wants to see our ids. I got a bit irritated at her approach because the couple before us who also looked young but did not have to show any ids and were seated first. I even advised her that we don't drink so there is no need for that and normally she should have us seated first and then ask for ids only if we order drinks. I also asked her why are we being asked to show ids like this when the couple before us did not have to. At this a second server yelled at the first server telling her not to let us sit down and she is getting a manager. My gf was polite and showed the first server her ids and after telling her how i feel politely i took out my wallet to show her my ids ( I am 28 and so is my gf  ) next thing you know the manager comes behind us arms crossed and as per my opinion very rudely asked me what my problem was . I didn't expect that but after telling him what happened and advising him i did not request a manager and there is no problem I was treated very rudely in front of the guests and servers (That's how i felt ) He did not seem to care about how we felt and his behavior was very INTIMIDATING.   We came to have a good time on my gfs birthday at a location we thought was nice and classy and upscale and instead we had the displeasure of meeting the manager ( Nicolas ) who almost ruined my gfs birthday and made me feel disgusted with the way we were treated.   We like to eat out a lot and had a lot of good experiences and excellent hospitality at many mid and upscale restaurants downtown but the Panorama Lounge and their below average service has left a very sour taste in my mouth. Me , my family or my friends are not going to a place like that to spend money and get treated unjustly and be disrespected like that anytime soon. We ended going to this nicer looking restaurant inside CN Tower and had a good time.   The servers and the managers in Panorama as per as our opinion are not well trained and they were making us feel they were doing us a favor by letting us walk in to their restaurant. BELOW AVERAGE SERVICE. NEVER GOING BACK."}
{"text":"A friend planned after-dinner drinks at Panorama for Friday night and had booked for 16 people. It was my first time there and I had mixed expectations of this place after reading so many bad reviews. I sort of came expecting the worst and was pleasantly surprised then when we had really great service up until we finally left after 2am. Everyone from the bartender, our server and the hostesses to the ticket girl on the bottom floor were friendly!   It is pricey for sure.. $11 pints of beer, $13 martinis so I wouldn't make this a weekly thing but it's an awesome view and if you have a lot of people and can get the VIP room, it's sweet!  $5 cover on Friday and Saturday"}
