{"text":"We've been here twice and both times the food was really good, as well as the service.  It's a pretty big place with a nice long bar.   No complaints whatsoever at all.  :)   $3 house margarita specials are cool too!"}
{"text":"I did not have the best of experiences at Casita del Lago. My dish was poorly put together; the vegetables looked like something I could buy from Walmart."}
{"text":"We got a Groupon for $11 for $21 worth of food. There was a party of 4. There was one other party when we arrived. They offered daily specials. The server did not inform us of these specials, there was only a sign when you walked in. We ordered 2 pitchers of margaritas they were good and not skimpy on the alcohol. We order fajitas, chili rellenos, seafood special, and California Burrito. Nothing WAS GOOD! Fajitas had no flavor, they were not sizzling, rice was hard and bland, the beans color was scary, with fake cheese throughout the meals, the seafood special tasted very fisher and chewy, like chewing on a tire!!Salsa was bland with no spice, had to request salsa with some flavor,(which was a little better) the chili rellenos were not CHILI RELLEONOS more like canned sliced chilies in a tortilla...There were only 2 people working and throughout our meal more people showed up. Place was not very clean with litter on the patio. Not pleased. To try and established a Mexican restaurant in the Cleveland area you must STEP IT UP!! Will not be returning. Can get much better Mexican food throughout. Not worth it at all!"}
{"text":"So-so regular Mexican restaurant atmosphere, but the food was strangely above par. I live in a majorly Hispanic area of Chicago, so I'm surrounded by Mexican and Puerto Rican restaurants. I've come to expect the same, boring food from most of them. I have a few favorites in town, but this place along a lonely stretch of Lake Erie was quite surprising. My luck is bad trying the more authentic things like the fish, stews and moles, so I tend to stick to the things I can judge...the chicken fajitas were great. Really, the best I've had in several years. But next time I'm trying the Mole!"}
{"text":"I really don't prefer this restaurant. The staff wasn't the friendliest, the food was just average and the waiters were just watching TV (which was turned up really loud) in Spanish. We had to talk over the volume and then they wouldn't let our friends use their Groupon since we had one as well. We probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Well...it was good when it opened...not so much anymore.  Ate there Friday, 4/27, and had an awful meal.  Salsa was watery and no flavor.  My enchilada was about 4 inches in length...a far cry from what we usually were served and it was just so/so.  Rice was sticky and refried beans tasted burned.  Huge disappointment...service was very slow and the waiter did not even ask why my husband did not eat the rice or beans.  Emailed them and have not received a response yet but don't think we will be going back.  And...the vase on the table was so greasy and gross...hard to say when it was last washed.  Time to return to Nuevo Aculpulco in Olmsted Falls...a farther drive but ALWAYS muy bien!"}
{"text":"Do not even waste your time! I came here because they closed the one in Berea nog mistake! I came in and ordered a margarita and cheese sauce.  3 minutes lateriI was ready to order my entree.  The waiter never came back to take my order iI waited 15 minutes.  There was no one else in the restaurant.  I wasn't even greeted.  I finally got someone's attention and asked for my check.  I've never been treated so poorly.  I will never reccomend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"I've been to CDL three times now. It was a great place to take my girlfriend for a quick dinner. Very good Chips and Salsa. The tacos are great. The burritos are HUGE and you can not beat the price."}
{"text":"The staff was so rude from the get go and there were multiple flies buzzing around as soon as we sat down that I didn't even order food.   A server didn't acknowledge our table for quite awhile, not even a hey I will be right with you or anything. We all wanted to order drinks and as soon as we told the server that she gave some attitude and said she would have to get someone else to do that for her.  So then the other server comes over and was so rude. She immediately started complaining about somebody to us and acted like she didn't even want to take our order. She gave such an attitude when someone asked a question about one of the drinks and did not return with our order for quite some time.   At this point I decided I wasn't getting any food there because the staff was awful and after looking at the menu it's just American  food trying to pass off as Mexican and doing a horrible job. The menu items sucked. I figured I'd just eat some of the chips and salsa. The first server came to take my friend's food orders and I asked her if the tortilla chips were corn or flour. Her response was \"ugh I don't know does someone have an allergy or something\". Being someone that does have a food allergy that was really annoying. That is a serious this for us and she was so rude about it.   I waited for my friends to finish their meals and ten left and headed over to Laz Cazuelas to order some food to take home. That place is a million times better and just down the road from this shot hole so I highly recommend going there. Oh and this was the first time I have ever left a zero tip. Being a fellow server I really don't like skimping on tips because I know what it's like but they were so bad I didn't think they deserved anything"}
{"text":"Round two.  Still no bueno.  I suggest you avoid Casita unless you enjoy a side of fruit flies with your runny queso and greasy beef.  Didn't deduct a star because as another reviewer pointed out the salsa is pretty decent."}
{"text":"Just arrived home from this place.  We met there with a group of 6 people (the organizer's choice).  Horrible horrible experience.  When my wife and I arrived (about 10 minutes after the appointed meeting time) everyone was sitting there, so I assumed we'd missed the opportunity to order.   Nope.  The waiter hadn't even been by yet, we were told.  No one had menus, so I got up and somewhat sarcastically asked the bartender (the only employee in view) if I he minded if I grabbed some menus.  He pointed to where they were.  When I was walking past again on my way to the table, I asked (this time not so sarcastically, thinking maybe this was the case) if we should come to him at the bar and let him know our orders.  No, he said he'd be by.  Eventually another guy showed and took drink orders, then even more eventually we got our orders in.  Chips and salsa then arrived.  Horrible tasteless chips (we know because we soon ran out of salsa and ended up chewing them dry for quite a while, waiting for our food, and then later, long after the food was done, when we were waiting for our bills).  After about 15 minutes the waiter came back and told one of our party that they were out of whatever she'd ordered...so...15 minutes after they took our ORDER, they're just looking at the tickets in the kitchen?  Did I mention our party were the only people in the restaurant?  Eventually the food trickled out.  Our waiter had forgotten several of our orders, so we had to help him get things sorted out, and even then there were at least two wrong orders.  I can't speak for anyone else's meal, but mine was awful.  Seafood burritos, it was flat to the point of pathetic and the 'shrimp, crab meat and scallops were actually some cheese and maybe 5 of the tiniest shrimp I've ever seen (like 3/8\" long).  No scallops in residence, much less even imitation crab meat.  For $13.  Unremarkable rice and a spoonful of refrieds.  I had a margarita with my dinner and it was obviously made with that el cheapo mix that tastes like lime soda.  Eww.  Checks never arrived, even after an hour, so again my wife and I performed service duties by walking up and asking.  Since we'd specifically told our waiter that we were together, ours came immediately (thank god), but the manager then showed up and stood there asking what everyone had ordered.  We told him that the group had asked for separate checks.  \"Oh, they're separate,\" he said, as he held a single check in front of his face and continued asking what each person had ordered.  My wife and I threw our friends under the bus at this point and bailed.  Honestly, I'm still hungry.  Let me repeat that...I just came from a Mexican restaurant and I'm still hungry.  That's a first.  I mean, you can at least fill up on CHIPS AND SALSA at a Mexican place, right?  Nope.  My burrito was so pathetic and the chips and salsa so marginal, I'm actually still hungry.  You've been warned."}
{"text":"Love the chipoltle cream sauce, but last visit was kinda eh. No one to greet us, took a few minutes to even recognize we were in the place. Long wait when we said give us a few minutes to decide. Probably our last visit. We will find another place to spend our money."}
{"text":"This was the worst dining experience of my life. Please do not ever go here!! The restaurant was freezing cold, the one waiter was absolutely not trained and didn't listen, and we were there for 2 hours!! Have you ever been to a Mexican restaurant that long?!   The food was old, dried out or even spoiled, over cooked, and just plain bad.   To top all of that off the manager was unprofessional and rude. After sharing with him all the issues we had with the meal he said \"what do you want me to do?\" And walked away. We had to call him back over to inform him we would not be paying and left. This was unreal. Get a new job if you don't have pride in your work.  Please do not go there!!"}
{"text":"My original thoughts for this review were to just be kind. My mother told me if I didn't have anything nice to not say nothing.   In real life, when someone sadly informs you that a loved one is dead, you just know something just isn't right at all and they waste time stressing you out trying to put it to you mildly. The way I go about it is to come out of nowhere and tell it like it is. Not wasting any time sugarcoating anything this time. I've been to tons of restaurants, from Mexico to Scotland to Egypt and most places in between. This is the worst place I've ever patronized, and so nearby in location it's mortifying.   The only reason I went there in the first place was it's nearby, Mexican and I bought a Groupon. There was some kind of notice about Groupons that I didn't understand. Maybe they could use some education on language. There is a new feature on Groupon where they say they just send your name to the restaurant instead of you printing it out. Cool. My printer is broken and I don't have a smart phone. I mentioned the Groupon right away, suspecting they might not honor one if not done properly. Said Groupon already told them I was on my way. We were told they knew nothing about this so I asked for directions to the nearest library so I could go and print it out. The waiter gave us proper directions and I came back with my coupon. I really didn't want to go back. Over that two miles to the library there were many more appetizing places on the way, but I already paid $11 toward this meal. I highly doubted I would go right after already seeing the menu, standard, but filthy. I don't like to handle or order something that is dirtier than anything out of my dumpster, and my neighbors are slobs. All restaurants need to pay better attention to the menu matter, and some are much better than others. This review is so negative I won't bother to elaborate. I should have been smart and saw the red flags all over the place. Blame it on my blind determinism. If you walked in there with nothing invested, you'd leave. I was really hungry for just a taco by then, and how can you go wrong with that?   Stale chips and the salsa, I'd beat them in any contest with my own homemade. Any shithole has better salsa.   Mexican restaurants are similar to Chinese and McDonalds in that you know what's going to be on the menu. At this place, they were out of both tamales and shredded beef. Worse than that time Friendly's was out of vanilla ice cream. Who the fuck manages these places?  In my attempt to provide proof I paid for my Groupon, I had to pump gas in 5 degrees right by the lake, then it was freezing cold in there.  The food wasn't fresh, definitely not good, but neither my partner or I got sick.  I can't believe this place has been there so long. I definitely won't be back. The one good thing out of this experience is that I discovered an amazing library, Avon Lake Library. That place blew my mind, nice work there."}
{"text":"Great and fast service. Never a wait for dinner. Every time we have gone for dinner there were only a couple other people there so it is always quiet.  It is typical Mexican food... Large quantities.  They even have a section of the menu for the \"less adventurous amigos\" aka hamburgers and chicken nuggets.  It's not a gourmet restaurant, but I have never had any complaints."}
{"text":"If you're looking for atmosphere go somewhere else! Casita was DOA at 8:30 on a Saturday night. Not that the place doesn't have potential, the dining room is sizable with a stage and a large dance floor. I wondered why they werent taking advantage of the venue with a live band or some other form of entertainment. The decor is your standard Mexi-bar fare.   You're here for the food! So I'm happy to tell you the food is GREAT!!! I'm not Mexican food connosoisseur and I don't particularly consider my palate sophisticated but I enjoyed the food here and so did my husband. I had the seafood enchiladas and my husband had the chicken crema (sp?). Both dishes were well seasoned and my husband commented on the quality of the chicken.  We would certainly eat here again!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have eaten at Mexican restaurants in Arizona, California, and Texas.  All very good.  Well this is Ohio and we didn't expect anything great, we were wrong.  This place has good food, great drinks, and the service is the best.  We've been going there for quite awhile and it really the best mexican food in the area. One of the things that really sets it apart though is the service.  We would go in a maybe once a month, the manager always remembers us.  Our kids go in with friends, he remembers them.  What finally prompted me to write a review though is my daughter went in with friends to enjoy the food and margaritas.  The chips they put on the table were the red corn chips.  The manager noticed my daughter wasn't eating any and went over to check if everything was OK.  My daughter told him everything was fine, but she had a red food dye allergy and  couldn't eat the chips.  He went back and made her, her own basket of regular corn chips.  To me, that is service above and beyond.   My husband and I have since moved out of the area, but when we are down visiting the kids we always try to take time for a meal there (we have yet to find a really good mexican place near our new home.)"}
