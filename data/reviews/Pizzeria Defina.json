{"text":"I keep giving this place a chance, and will continue to do so. 

First- the pizza. It is great which is why I keep going back. It would get 4 stars but for what follows. 

The service is the problem for me- I have been there frequently for 45 minutes watching tables (like 3)that arrive after us get served and leave before our pizza arrives. It seems like they staff one hard working, competent server AND one poor server per shift. Or the kitchen is just disorganized?

At other times I'm the guy getting my food and leaving in a reasonable time. 

If it were consistently slow, I would only go when in the mood for a leisurely date night and be perfectly happy.  But with my luck, that would be the night everything arrives in 15 minutes and there is a huge line out the door with pressure from the server to pay my bill."}
{"text":"If you are coming here for the pizza then don't bother. Average at best -heck..even worse than domino's =/ -too pricey and they take they take too long."}
{"text":"Great pizza, went for lunch, lots of families and it was packed at 1pm on a Saturday. Would have given them 5 stars but they messed up our order. The service was very good and the pizza tasted great!! I would recommend a visit!"}
{"text":"The pizza was still good! But I prefer other pizza places to this one. We had the Defina Sausage and The Butcher pizzas. The crust was a bit thicker than I prefer and they skimped out on some of the toppings. The service and ambiance were good, but I couldn't help comparing it to Libretto and still prefer Libretto's pizzas (at Danforth and Ossington locations). With that said, they have a lot more options on their menu and I would still come back to try some of the other pizzas/dishes. I'm hoping to re-visit this review after trying a few more plates and hopefully edit it for the better!"}
{"text":"Hands-down, great pizza. Once we discovered, we haven't been anywhere else (for pizza n whatnot). Service has been great since we've been there too, so keep it up! See you soon."}
{"text":"Had the Roncy and the Defina Sausage pizzas.  Both were super tasty and would order again!"}
{"text":"We have had several misinfo experiences with this place. They will confirm kamut on a phone call but once you get there even then a server there female will say yes, not 2 seconds after you order comes back with oh I am afraid there is no kamut?! The annoying individual who if you go you will guess, is not only condescending but done this twice.... once she suggested she wasn't the voice on the phone and threw a new person under the bus for the misinformation! Yup classy chick that one !
We have decided they just ain't worth it! I mean no reservations allowed, no accuracy with their wine selection,no kamut guranteed so like ciao baby!
Apparently this happens often! One would guess they would get a clue by now as to how amazing this offer can be for those avoiding mainstream flour! 
#lets be special"}
{"text":"Daaaamn skippy, that was one fine grilled peach and burrata salad. Nice presentation and fantastic balance between creamy (burrata), sweet (the peach), salty (the prosciutto) and acidic (the vinaigrette-laced rocket). 

I also like that they give you a choice between Naples-style (floppy) and Roman-style (crispy) pizza. 

Service was good, quick and attentive without being invasive. 

One gripe: They said their scotch bonnet peperoncini were going to blow my tongue off. I put an entire teaspoon in my mouth and felt the barest of tickles. I love spice, but really, I prefer a tasty, salty peperoncini at any rate, and there's was neither. So, umm, I guess I'm rooting for them to make better in-house peperoncini."}
{"text":"Five stars for the brussels sprouts! I crave the dish often now, and so do all of the regulars! Amen for Defina!"}
{"text":"Defina is up there in the Toronto pizza scene and on par with Pizzeria Libretto and better than Queen Margharita, FBI, Buca, and Terroni. Staff: friendly enough, great service. Decor: nice and unique but hey we're here to eat some pizza!

We ordered the pesto, excellent pizza, real chicken; and the butcher, which actually has all four meats (pancetta, sopressata, sausage, prosciutto d'parma) in four separate slices so it's like getting four mini pizzas, awesome! We also ordered their Las Vegas award winning pizza (I forgot the name sorry) and it was excellent too. All pizzas were in the true Napoletana style (thin crust, tiny burnt crust edges etc.) Prices are reasonable too, plus you'll get leftovers unless you can somehow eat a whole wheel!

We did sit near the window and it was hot as hell but the staff kindly opened a door for us. Great beer selection and the wine deal on Tuesday (I think Tuesday?) We got there at 5 and the place was pretty empty but I heard it fills up quick."}
{"text":"Amazing Napoleon pizza, excellent straight-forward service and best of all a descent price! Great decor and a nice cool, calm atmosphere. One point to make for the owners is maybe seek VPN Certification and attract more hard-core Napoleon pizza lovers."}
{"text":"We came here for a 75th birthday party for my relative. There were over 30 people so we were moved to the party room upstairs. It was a very nice and trendy space, perfect for the event. Appetizers were served and were very good. Supper was served at 8:30 which was very late for my sister Claire and I. WELL IT WAS WORTH THE WAIT. The first thing they brought out was a Brussels sprout dish. Incredible!!! A roasted bean dish was next! Very good!! Cesar salad was next.. it was ok (not the biggest fan). I had never eaten wild boar before, but the Wild Boar Meatballs were incredible!! I ate 4!! A variety of pizza came out next which was incredible!! Some of the better pizza I've ever had!! Dessert was also delectable!! This was Claire and I's first dinner like this and it was a hit!! Such good food and atmosphere!!"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza... I had the red hot chilli pepper on kamut crust. Savoury and hearty - will be coming back again."}
{"text":"The food was good but the service was terrible. We arrived at 3:30 on a Sunday afternoon and were not served our pizzas until 4:25. Incredibly slow service and at a time when it wasn't that busy. Also, when three of us received our pizzas at the same time, the fourth person had to wait over five  minutes more for her pasta. Not cool. Yes, the food was good, but we were hungry and it was an unpleasant wait."}
{"text":"I've been back twice more to get take-out here and have found the pizzas not quite as good. In both cases, the crust was quite tough. It's hard to gauge whether this is caused by the fact it ends up sitting in the box for 10 minutes on the way home but regardless this issue detracts from the take-out experience. 

Per one of the other comments below I haven't had any issue with the charring level as the three times I have had pizza here there have been black-spots-a-plenty on the bottom of the pies.

All in all, at the price point this is a solid pizza joint and given that the house is regularly full, I think that the local Roncey population would agree. 

Take-out experience = 3/5"}
{"text":"We waited to be seated for about ten minutes. Were rudely treated by the waiter who seated someone else first, who arrived after us. Walked right past us to do it as well. Then the entire staff continued to ignore us. We left and I want back in to ask if anyone saw us standing in front of the bar for the last ten minutes. \"And no was all he said...\" 

 Will not be returning anytime soon. I am not easily offended. That was ridiculous. Too bad. Their pizza is almost worth their staffs arrogance."}
{"text":"Based on reviews, I was expecting a decent but average meal.  But I LOVED my Honey pizza (pear, gorgonzola, pecan).  I also enjoyed a nicely-made post-dinner latte.  Both worth having again.

Our server was lovely, and not at all phased by my 5-month old baby who had a lot to say.  

My 2 friends both enjoyed their pizzas as well.  One asked for an ingredient substitution, and was granted it with no issues.  We also liked that there are 2 types of crust.  I ordered the softer of the 2, and loved it."}
{"text":"I go to a lot of pizzerias and grew up eating gourmet pizza, Defina is truly delicious. Their pizza dough is so good I even ate the crusts. Also the crispy Brussels sprouts were to die for. 
Authentic pizza!"}
{"text":"Great pizza comparable or better than Libretto and the like. Crazy good brussel sprouts."}
{"text":"This pizzeria is warm and inviting the moment you walk in. We were greeted immediately and asked where we would like to be seated. We opted for the back and my boyfriend and I were seated in front of the area where the pizza is prepared. I watched in awe how the pizza was made in from scratch and cooked to perfection in a matter of minutes in the wood burning oven.

I ordered the \"The 504\" which had tomato sauce, basil, fior de latte, soppresata, red onions and mushrooms and grand padano. On the first bite it was so flavourfull and you can taste all the ingredients. The thin crust was just perfect (you have the option to select different flours for your pizza). It was delicious. What sets this place apart from all the other established pizzerias is how fresh the ingredients are and how fast a simple yey delicious pizza is made and brought to your table. If you like pizza, this place is a must try!!!"}
{"text":"The pizza was all right. It wasn't the best, but it wasn't the worst. And if were really hungry like me. The pizza slice is very small. Not enough to satisfy your hunger."}
{"text":"Love this place. It is our go to Italian place in the hood. We usually get to starters like the brussels sprouts and a salad and share a pizza. Everything we have tried has been excellent. Service can be on point but if they're really busy it can lag as it's hard for the servers to get around. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a cozy meal at a great place."}
{"text":"Roasted Root Vegetables sounds gross (celeriac purée isn't a very exciting idea, either) but seriously, this was delicious.

The margherita pizza was also delicious-- it's chewy, but not too soggy to pick up. I am happiest when I don't have a puddle in the middle of my pizza (ahem, Libretto, Famoso), so this one hit the spot.

Highly recommended-- date friendly, family friendly, great ambiance, too."}
{"text":"Pizzeria Defina is not bad. I had not eaten in the Roncesvalles area in eons so I was enthused about checking this place out with my pizza-obsessed friend the other night and it was decent. I read some not-so-great reviews and wasn't sure what to expect but apart from the pancetta missing from my Roncy pizza ($16; Neapolitan crust--I like that they give you the option of Napolese or Roman crust), which had a nice amount of crispy-edged guanciale throughout, and the burrata ($12) being a big disappointment, it was alright overall and this had a lot to do with the great service and lack of pretension. Even without the pancetta, my pizza was pretty good but I'm sure it could have been that much better in a way that only pancetta can improve things. (I love you, pancetta!) Be sure to ask for the spicy oil with your pizza.

My friend ordered the Diavola and I could tell she wasn't nuts about it but we still ate every last bite. I only wish the burrata would have been better. It was a small piece that came surrounded with minced caramelized onions, a drizzle of olive oil and a little scoop of some tomato-y sauce. I guess the memories of Campagnolo's burrata are still alive and well and have set the standard for every burrata that follows. Kind of like the one that got away... 

If you're in the Roncesvalles area, Defina is worth a try. It's laid back with a lot of locals and families with kids. They also have a list of cocktails you might want to try (we didn't), or you can always hit up one of the nearby bars."}
{"text":"Tried out Pizzeria Defina for the first time today and it was delicious. I am new to the neighborhood and trying to find some new restaurants and I will be definitely returning. Food was great, excellent service and lovely atmosphere. I recommend this place!"}
{"text":"exquisite pizza - the roncy and lobster bisque were the most delicious and layered Blanco 'zas.

got a side order of the tomato sauce to satisfy a craving for it, and of course, it was ridiculously good."}
{"text":"I have eaten in most of the pizza joints in Toronto. I have to say this is my favourite. 

WIthout the get-in-get-out feet of other trendy places, Defina is always warm and welcoming. The service is fast and the food is great.

My personal favourite is the regular-old margherita pizza. I like a classic. You can get your pizza on a fluffy or \"Roma\" crust. I always choose the blistered Roma. If they ask you if you want spicy oil, take it. It's so simple, but really compliments the pizza."}
{"text":"Great local place! The food is always fresh and delicious.
Service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favourite restaurant on Roncesvalles! I am glad we live close by so that we can see how busy they are and avoid the line up. Defina has never disappointed us with its amazing food, wide craft beer offering, and great people who make this place full of life and deliciousness! 

We come here whenever we have a craving for pizza. From simpler margherita to more unique and adventurous 'pizza expo' creations, everything we tried has been delicious.

It can get busy even week nights and gets very noisy when it's packed but that's part of the fun. We love sitting at the very end in front of the pizza guys. A bit quieter there and got something to look at. Whatever they're doing, they are doing it right."}
{"text":"The pizza was really, really great.  The server was very friendly.  The price was right.   Would go back. 

Oh, and they have $6 20oz heini, sapporo, or rickards."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Pizza I've had in Toronto (and I've been to many many many pizzerias)!! After a day at High Park we decided to stop by here (thanks to yelp), and was pleasantly surprised. 
There was a line-up at the door, since it's a pretty cozy place. But we didn't mind the wait as we could see the chefs creating dough masterpieces on the other side of the restaurant and I was basically drooling seeing the pizzas come out of the wood oven. 

The staff was nice and apologetic about the wait and ensured us it will be made up with the delicious food, and they couldn't have been more right. We ordered the Burnt Eggplant Bourani to start and got 2 pizzas as main - Pesto and 2013 Best Traditional Pizza. I usually cannot finish more than 1/2 a pizza, but I got through 7/8 of this one because it OH SO DELICIOUS! Topped it off with a giant Profiterole for dessert. I cannot wait to be back in the west end just so that I can come back here!!

One star taken off because the restaurant was a tad too small resulting in the line-ups."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! The pizza and appetizers are delicious (my favourites are the brussel sprouts - just order them!! - and the wild mushroom pizza. The vibe, staff, decor...it's all wonderful! And seriously, you gotta try those brussel sprouts :-)"}
{"text":"\"Can I have some more water?\" after waiting around with an empty glass.

\"Oh sure, let me just fill it from the tap and give you no ice\".

Pizza is good but the service is down right poor. If I were the owner, I wouldn't like my restaurant being represented this way."}
{"text":"My favourite pizza place in Toronto; absolutely incredible ingredients, great crust and some innovative combinations."}
{"text":"I highly recommend eating here. Bring your mother, grandmother, sister, neighbour, local pastor...

The drinks were generously poured and the food & scotch bonnet oil were flawless."}
{"text":"A Roncesvalles treasure has been discovered!! 

I found Pizzeria Defina because I was going to have lunch with a friend that needed something gluten-free, and also we wanted to go somewhere special. This pizzeria seemed to be the perfect choice: has tons of gluten-free options, reviews were awesome, interior seemed really pretty... so there we went. 

We were lucky because we arrived early and it was not too crowded at that time, but heads up, it gets busy busy around 1-2pm - would have been difficult to get a table. I ordered a creamy pizza with yukon gold mashed potatoes and mushrooms. Whaaaaaaat, a pizza with potato? Yes, it works!!! And it is delicious!!! I thought it was going to be way too heavy, but on top of the Napolitan style crust the mix was spot on. Also, the brussels sprouts we ordered as appetizer were crunchy, lemony, and perfect.

I honestly can't wait to go back and try all their pizzas and their appetizers and their everything."}
{"text":"I don't find many combinations of kid friendly environment and sophisticated food, so Defina has moved high up on my short list of places to dine on Roncy. No small feat to stick out on this strip of eclectic and interesting restauranteurs who have to endure what seems to be the outcome of fertility drugs in the tap water. I can't comment on the night atmosphere, but the day atmosphere is just right for families. Service is friendly and speedy and music drowns out the protestations of little ones. All this and pizza that makes my mouth water just thinking about it, interesting choices on the beer list too.

Only downside is the tables are so close together you feel like you are sitting in each other's laps. Maybe they spread them out when it's adults only?"}
{"text":"This is a great pizza place. Their Pumba pizza is delicious. The staff working there are all very friendly and helpful. Wonderful food overall!

The only issue is that they do not take reservations and are very busy. Expect to wait at least 30mins standing in a cramped entranceway if you are going there on a weekend for dinner."}
{"text":"Positive: Amazing thin crust pizza, its as good as it comes. Friendly staff and nice decor. 
Negative: The topping seems to be less generous compare to a year ago, someone is cutting corners :p"}
{"text":"Phenomenal. A cozy, quaint Toronto gem, with great service and romantic decor. The mushroom pizza with kamut crust was stellar, as were the brussel sprouts (with the bacon left off.) Crispy green beans also delectable - perfectly cooked with a light creamy garlic sauce. Our new favorite Italian place!"}
{"text":"We waited for about 20 minutes to get a seat, but as soon as my party of 5 was seated we had a great time! We each ordered a different type of pizza and were stuffed. Someone commented below on the prosciutto pizza not having much on it, but ours was heavy with toppings. I also ordered calamari and it was enough to be my actual meal, I could've licked the plate. We also ordered the caesar salad and it was delish. My friends just moved to the area and it will def be the spot we hit up.
Our servers were efficient and super friendly. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Roncesvalles is a great neighbourhood to live in, High Park is a quick walk west, the lake is a hop, skip and a jump south, the Bloor subway line is a stones throw away north and there is easy access to the highway off of the Lakeshore.

There is also a large Polish community in Roncesvalles.  Every September the community closes off the street to have their annual Polish festival.   The street is crammed with people, music is playing, perogies are frying and vodka is flowing, and people are laughing and having a great time.

Around 2 years ago the street went through a major streetcar track and water main project.  With that, many small businesses closed, 18 to be exact.  Since the construction finished, there has been a number of great restaurants, cafes and boutique stores opening up on the street, Pizzeria Defina being one of them.  In the evenings and on the weekends, Roncy is just bustling with young families with their strollers, dogs and coffees.  The vibe on this street is addicting, if you don't live here and you are just walking through, it sucks you in and you don't want to leave.

Defina has been a great addition to the street, bringing you a great rustic relaxed restaurant that offers fantastic pizza and pasta.  They offer many options, but the pizza is their main item on the menu.  They offer around 20 different pizzas on 2 different crusts, a Roma style, which is a thin crispy crust or a Napoletana which is a thick doughy crust.  I always order the crispy thin crust because I'm not a fan of thick doughy crusts, but that's just me.  I have tried a number of the pizza's on the menu and they are all good but my favourite by far is the Red Hot Chili Pepper.  It has nice red and yellow peppers, jalapeno peppers, and a spicy smoked chorizo for the toppings.  For an added bit of spice I like to add some of the scotch bonnet peperoncini which is a spicy oil.  They also offer chili flakes which I add once in a while but I find the oil to be enough spice for me.  With the thin crust I find when I pick up a slice some of the toppings fall off, so you make a bit of a mess on the plate.  When it comes to pizza I can eat and eat and eat, so I can finish a whole pizza to myself, but if you get a starter, one pizza can feed 2 people. 

They have a great selection of appetizers, I didn't order any this time around because I was by myself but when I am in a group we always order the warm olive plate.  If you love olives like I do, then the olive plate is a great starter.  It comes with a selection of different olives in a nice warm oil and bread.

In addition to the delicious pizza, I really enjoy the vibe and atmosphere of Pizzeria Defina.  You walk in the  and the walls are exposed brick, the floors are hardwood, there is a huge wood fire oven in the back and a chef twirling pizza dough in the air, there is nice art on the wall by local artists and there is good music playing, sometimes it's a little loud but that's ok.  There is one piece of art that I would love to steal and put up in my place.

{"text":"Neat little place - great brick oven pizza, and very good service. The menu is intriguing, and I admire that they're willing to experiment. I had their \"Red Hot Chili Pepper\" pizza, and I was not disappointed - spicy and delicious! I also tried their nachos, which I was curious to try in an Italian place. Different, but not at all bad. I'd like to go back and try other dishes, especially the appetizers. It's also really cool to be able to watch your pizza being made - the oven is in the back of the restaurant, but in full view of most of the tables. The bar is excellent also, very good cocktails. The decor is quite nice as well. 

The quality of the ingredients is really what makes this place - every individual bit of my pizza and appetizer were yummy on their own. 

The only downside was the number of servers - there was only one server and a bartender (who doubled as a server) while I was there, and given how quickly the place can get packed, they really could have used a second server. 

Lots of families with young kids eat here, yet you'd never notice. A testament to both the servers and the clientele, methinks. 

Finally, their pizzas are best fresh. I've seen some reviewers whining about take-out quality ... seriously? You don't get brick-oven for takeaway! Though given the lack of quality take-out pizza in Toronto, I can hardly blame them. Poor souls, truly."}
{"text":"Incredible food, fantastic service and very good prices.

Full disclosure: a good friend of mine is the manager here. I'll try to be as objective as I can, but honestly, if I didn't love the place, I just wouldn't write a review. Luckily for my tummy and our friendship, I was completely blown away.

Chad and I came for dinner on a Good Friday evening. At 6:30pm, it was PACKED. It seems that this is the go-to place for young west end families to dine. Thankfully, the kids were all well behaved. We sat at the bar since we didn't really feel like waiting for a table. Firstly, the service is great, and not just because I know a couple people that work there. The staff genuinely like each other and are happy to be there. The bartender was friendly and knowledgable and service was quick. The people I know there are from my past life as a server at Il Fornello and were always very professional and great at their jobs.

To start, we shared the calimari appetizer, a steal at $8. It was INCREDIBLE. It was perfectly cooked (grilled over a fire, I think) and served with roasted tomatoes and impossibly tiny olives that gave it a great salty bite. I loved this. I could have eaten a whole meal of this. We also had house-baked bread on the table with scotch bonnet chili sauce, which meant I got dinner and a show as Chad choked on the super hot chilis.

Chad and I both had the Napoletana pizza ($13), which featured anchovies, olives and oregano. He had it on the crispier roma crust, and I had it on the chewier napoletana crust. It was tasty, but I should have ordered a pizza with more toppings, as this was not the kind of pizza you get when you can't have cheese. It's a simple pizza where you get to really let the crust, sauce and cheese sing. Totally my fault, this isn't the first cheeseless pizza I ordered. My friend actually recommended that I get a different one, but I really really wanted olives and anchovies. The olives and anchovies were perfectly balanced throughout. I particularly loved the tomato sauce, which they were very generous for mine. It was fresh, flavourful, simple and made from scratch. It actually tasted a lot like the sauce I make at home, and I make a damn good sauce.

I was super happy with my dining experience, and loved that it didn't break the bank, even though we split a bottle of wine ($29) and had cocktails. I'm definitely coming back and will try their pastas next, just to get some more of that sweet, sweet tomato sauce. I was told that they're working on some new menu items that will include dairy and gluten-free options. 

If you're looking for really delicious food, friendly, unpretentious service and a warm, casual atmosphere, this is your place."}
{"text":"Really good.

I fucking love pizza. So ive been to quite a bit of pizzerias. 

This place is da bomb dot com.

Awesome staff. Great cozy atmosphere. Good vibes. And Great Food. Hell ya.

We waited for like 40 minutes on a wed night but that didnt matter cuz the service was quick and excellent and the food amazing.

Had the wild boar meatballs to start. Really good.. warm tasty tomato sauce with mozzarella and basil on top. Not too gamey nor chewy as i expected. Nice surprise.

Had wild mushroom pizza and diavola. Thin crust. Yum as fuck. Im sure all the other pizzas are fucking good too.

Definitely on the top of the list for pizza with pizzeria libretto. That place is fucking lit as well.

Libretto for a little more modern hype atmosphere (the one on university at least)
Defina for a little more cozy and intimate atmosphere.

Oh and the chilli oil that they gave us was hella good too. Put that shit on everything. Mmmmm.

Also very reasonably priced.

Highly recommendable to everyone."}
{"text":"we initially wanted to go to another restaurant in roncy but the waiting time was just too long as we were already super hungry by the time we parked.  we decided to try this place out.  we had to wait for about 20 minutes but the staff was great and gave us some water as we waited on the stools in the front.  ambience was great and the place smelled good...we were salivating.  we ordered three pizzas - the pumba, the best traditional pizza, and diavola.  all were super tasty and all the ingredients were so fresh!  crust was crusty!  i really like the pizza at pizzeria libretto and this was just as good!  we were impressed!  would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Wow unbelievable food ..... I can't believe this place was two minutes from me! I would never normally get a pizza with beets but it was amazing! Craft cocktails for $10! I had a bourbon drink with maple bacon flavoring and Italian white wine to die for!"}
{"text":"They are known for pizza but it's the other dishes where they shine. The salads and apps are  delicious. It gets crowded but its worth checking out."}
{"text":"I think I had one of the best customer service experiences at Defina. The service is amazing and the pizza is too. Often, there is a wait so be prepared for that. We waited nearly 40 minutes on a Friday night to be seated, but we were served drinks and tended to very nicely. Try the lasagna pizza!"}
{"text":"I've been to Pizzeria Libretto and thought Pizzeria Defina knocked it out of the park. The ambience is great, I loved seeing the open wood oven! Since we went on Tuesday, we were presented with some delicious sample wine. For food, I had \"the butcher\" and my friend had the \"Adonis\" (vegetarian). The Butcher was absolutely delicious and I loved having 4 different pizzas in one. My friend enjoyed her Adonis very much as well. I have no complaints about this place and would definitely go again."}
{"text":"Place was okay. Saw it on you gotta eat here so I thought i would give it a whirl. 

Tried several pizzas, the 504 (meh), chicken pizza (delicious) and lobster pizza (interesting but wouldn't have it again)

The bison meatballs were very good. 

Overall, service a bit slow, pizza was okay but not sure if I would be back. I've had better pizza at several different places in the city such as True Tru, G for Gelato, lambretta"}
{"text":"I have happily eaten here several times now but most recently was for a birthday. When we arrived, our reservation a) existed (which is sadly rarer than you would think & b) was sat immediately. Also a plus as it was quite busy. Thanks to the wood burning over the place smells legit. On top of the great service, and a pleasant pop-in on our meal from the owner, their beer vendor was in house giving away samples. Free samples. Pint size free samples. :D  Not too shabby! I recall having a crispy brussel sprouts, and the diavola pizza, which was nice and spicy. It would have rivaled for best birthday ever if they managed to squeeze in a chucky cheese size ball room but hey, nobodies perfect. 

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This place has fantastic food. The pizza was great. We had the pesto pizza and the asparagus as an appetizer. We loved the food! The place is really cool too and has a nice vibe to it. Its a little cramped, but because so many people go here because it is so good. We had to wait about 10 minutes on a Saturday night when the line was out the door. The place was worth the wait! The only negative thing I could say was that the service was a little slow and other tables somehow got their food before we did and we arrived earlier. granted we did not order right away, but still...The wait staff made it up to us, so I have no hard feelings and they were very nice and helpful either way. We saw the place online so i figured I would make the review. Check it out! You will love it!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best Pizzeria I've experienced in Toronto. The place is very rustic, cozy, and welcoming, we had the window seats, great view of Roncy. The cocktail, wine, and beer list were excellent. And the pizza... well the pizza is just as good as it gets, I've been to Rome and anyone there would be proud to serve what they offer. Our group split Pumba and Margherita, Rome style crust (ultra-thin, crispy outside). Pumba was wild boar meatballs, garlic, finest cheeses. Margherita is in the classic style, simple ingredients, yet incredibly delicious. Absolutely divine. The pasta was nothing short of spectacular either. And the service was excellent as well, obviously could tell some in the group were not familiar with all the Italian wording, and made really great suggestions for everything. Since I live close by, I imagine I will be coming back quite often to this gem."}
{"text":"This place makes the best pizza ever! I love the vegetarian mushroom pizza. The brussels sprouts were also delicious. It's a small, cozy place and the service is amazing! I definitely recommend everyone check it out - you will not be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Fine tasting pizzas, attentive and knowledgeable staff mixed with a great ambiance. Throw in incredibly delicious side dishes (Brussel sprouts ) and you got a winner."}
{"text":"Better than Libretto....

As a pizzaiolo I can atest that is worth the drive from Suburbia

Grab a pizza and a pint monday special and dig in

Awesome steak for the gluten free in your dinner party"}
{"text":"The decent pizza and wine list was overshadowed by the horrific service.  I have dined here four times now and the service and attitude have been progressively worse each time.  From now on I will actually go out of my way to get pizza across town at Terroni or Il Fornello.

The entire staff, starting with the incredibly arrogant host, need to take a field trip further up Roncy to The Westerly or further down Roncy to Cardinal Rule to take notes on how to be cool while delivering excellent customer service."}
{"text":"Overall the food at Pizza Defina is fairly good. The pizzas and pastas are mostly reliable (although the pizza can be soggy in the middle, and the boar meatballs were disappointingly bland). A high point is the green beans with truffle aioli and grano padano--delicious. When it's busy, the service can be abrasively brusque. The major indictment, however, must be reserved for the music, which is godawful and wholly unappetizing--last time i was there it was a relentless playlist of classic rock (and even heavy metal) clichés from the 70s and 80s. Fine for driving to the beer store, but a drag during dinner."}
{"text":"Awesome service and unbeatable food.

Note: they do not take reservations. But in this day and age that's a great thing, because then the restaurant isn't holding open tables for people that might come/show up late. I came here on a Tuesday night (2 of us) around 7:30 and got a table right away. Had we been a group of 4, we likely would have had to wait maybe 15 minutes? The place was about 95% full. 

They have a $5 special on beers on Tuesday, so that was nice for our server to tell us. We ended up getting the brussel sprouts to start, which were great. They're mixed in with some peppers and cheese which help kill the natural awful taste of sprouts. For dinner I got the wild mushroom pizza and it was out of this world. The pizza is perfectly thin so that you don't feel gross for eating the entire thing and the dough is great enough that you will want to eat the crust. 

Overall, for 2 pizzas, an app, and 2 drinks, total was around $75, including tip - I can't complain. I'll definitely be back to conquer everything else on the menu."}
{"text":"AMAZING PIZZA PLACE! Truly authentic taste and deliciously light tasting. Everything feels fresh. Will definitely be returning. Mmm pizza!!"}
{"text":"LOVED this place so much!!! We ordered their #504 Pizza and their Patagonia Charcuterie Board. The #504 had thinly sliced soppresetta, black olives, mushrooms and other goodness and the board had medium skirt steak topped with chimichurri crab salad, mashed cassava and chips, deep fried cheese, asparagus, focaccia and pickled zucchini. 
I want to give it 4 and 1/2 stars. Only problem...not enough room on the table for our food and we felt a little rushed and left without eating all of our food and had them pack a doggie bag. They closed to prep for dinner service after we left so we felt bad. 
Other than that we will be coming back. Best pizza and we want to try another Charcuterie board."}
{"text":"We came here last night for dinner. There was a bit of a line so we had to wait for 30 minutes or so but no big deal. The hostess was really friendly and offered us drinks while we were waiting. 

My companion had one of their polish beers which was delightful (and I'm not a huge beer fan). I tried two of their cocktails and they were ok. 

We had the grilled peach salad to share and it was very nice! For our mains, I got the Wild Mushroom pizza and my companion got the Roncy pizza. The Wild Mushroom pizza was amazing! One of the best pizzas I've had in the city. My companion really enjoyed his pizza but he thought the pancetta was quite salty and wishes the pizza had more potatoes. The service was friendly and prompt.

All in all, I enjoyed myself and would definitely return!"}
{"text":"The best Grilled Calamari in Toronto !! The wing is too salty for us , hard to finish the whole plate, there should be some bread served with it...

Great vibe there. We got lucky, we went there right before the big lineup! 

Pizza tastes great love it. Will go back to try something else for sure :)"}
{"text":"The food is 4/5 but the service is a zero. We phoned an hour before our reservation to confirm they had Gluten-free crust. When we arrived, they had none and the owner chided us for not asking if they had gluten-free crust \"today\". By then we'd ordered drinks so we decided to work around it. Ten minutes after finishing our appetizers we could see that our pizzas weren't in the oven and the chef was on his phone. Our server, in this case the owner, had forgotten to put our order in. She promised us ice cream on the house. Of course, it never came. We reminded the owner, but after waiting ten minutes, we paid and left. Really, how long does it take to scoop ice cream? An hour long meal stretched out over an excruciating two hours.

If you go, try to ensure that your server isn't the owner who is too distracted and too quick to blame staff and customers when things go wrong."}
{"text":"Delicious! We had a wait for a table that went a bit over expected time but trust me it was worth the wait. Service was incredibly friendly and the pizza was delicious. The pepper oil is a must. Will for sure be back when in the area"}
{"text":"After having TERRIBLE service at Fat Cat, we decided NOT to stay for dinner.  We changed our plans and walked down the street to Defina.  We walked in the door and the waiter kissed our hands and was over the top nice, helpful, funny, and flirty.  We were getting a kick out of him!  We sat at the bar, had an amazing meal, and we were so happy that we decided not to put up with terrible service when we could have such great service (even when they were packed!).  Food was great, wine was great, my only comment is that I thought the crab cake (singular) and appetizers are a bit over priced for the serving size..  That said, I really like this place a ton!"}
{"text":"I heard about this place so decided to try it out....loved their pizza....went for the beet one...it was full of flavour. My only challenge was the fact that I had to wait for 1 hour to get a table."}
{"text":"I really love the food at Defina, but my experience with the service has been a little hit-or-miss. Recently my younger sister treated me to dinner there after we both had a rough day, and we received the worst service! We happened not to be dressed as well as the other patrons that evening (though still respectable), and were somehow totally passed over. Our server lavished attention on the table of four next to us, but never checked to see whether we liked our food, or came back to refill our water. We wound up paying at the bar after a few minutes of trying to get his attention, and got out of there. 

In general my experiences have been positive, and they offer GREAT food. But, if anyone from the restaurant is reading this, it is a sign of good service to make people feel welcome even if they happen to be wearing lame shirts, or look like they've had rough days. Hopefully this is just a small anomaly from an otherwise great restaurant."}
{"text":"The wifey had mentioned that this restaurant was featured on \"You Gotta Eat here\" and boy should you ever want to eat here! (Disclaimed - I haven't researched whether or not it was actually on the show\". 

We ate here on a Saturday at 2:30pm so the afternoon rush had cleared out but there were still a fair share of patrons seated. We were greeted at the door immediately and told that it would just be a couple of mins before we could sit. 

As promised, a table was ready within minutes. Menus were provided immediately as were two cups of water. 

The Menu - the menu contains small plates, pizza's, salads, and vegetable plates. Initially I was really interested in the Vegetable Quinoa Crust Pizza but the lady sitting next to us had ordered the last one. Thankfully we were close enough to see the dish and it was appropriately served on a cast iron skillet garnish with Arugula (couldn't see what was hiding on the inside). It smelled amazing. 

We ended up ordering the eggplant bruschetta, wild mushroom soup and the lamb merguez pide. 

Now here's the only bone I have to pick. We waited almost an hour for the bruschetta, pizza and a soup when the restaurant wasn't even that busy. To me, that's way too long. To make it worse, there was no bread provided to make the wait easy . The owner, Domenic (who's name I learned towards the end), did visit the table several times to apologize for the wait, which was well received. While I have to admit that the wait was long - and as it was my first time I don't know if this is common or not - the food was absolutely exceptional. 

A) Wild Mushroom Soup - it's served exactly how a French onion soup is served. A creamy, rich delicious blend of mushrooms, topped with a crusted cheese (gruyere) layer.  It was divine. Loads of flavour and a generous serving that can be shared between two. 

B) Eggplant Bruschetta - apparently this was the dish that caused the delay. I've roasted eggplants loads of times and I know that they take forever. However, if a dish is going to take 45 mins, I'd let the customer know in advance. I would imagine that the eggplant would be acceptably prepared ahead of time to reduce wait time, however, if it had to be made from scratch - I would definitely forewarn the customer - of at least ask if they'd want another dish to arrive first to reduce the perceived wait time. With that said, when the eggplant finally arrived it was delicious. Some might call it a eggplant parmesan, while others might call it a bruschetta. I'd say it's somewhere in between. Beautifully charred cherry tomatoes sat on top of delicious fresh eggplant that was baked in a wood fired oven for a generous amount of time. The tomatoes exploded when the butter knife made contact. It was absolutely delicious and perfectly made. 

C) Lamb Merguez Pide  - this dish is astounding. And by that- I mean it's art. The platter it's served on is perfect. Perfectly thought out, measured and executed. The dough was perfectly cooked, (picture a perfectly cooked calzone meets a croissant), with an open face and delicious ingredients tucked throughout. The first cut from the edge revealed the home made tomato sauce and goats cheese. As you move closer to the centre, you experience the kale, lamb, olives and all the other delicious ingredients. 

What a work of art! 

When the meal was done, I called over who I thought was the owner and asked him if he owned the joint. He said 'not today' as he probably felt our pain in the long wait. Dominic is a humble, friendly and excellent executor who will make sure you have a great dining experience. I've only met one other operator who gives as big of a sh*t about their restaurant - which I let Domenic know. 

The wait times may be long but the food is absolutely worth it. I'd go here again, knowing to have a snack beforehand, based on my experiences. This could be mitigated by a generous and complimentary servicing of delicious home made bread with their already delicious olive oil. 

All in all this place is top notch for the money paid and despite the wait, the food is stupidly good."}
{"text":"Defina epitomizes everything you would want/look for in a really good restaurant. The food was excellent, prices were reasonable, portions were large/filling and the service was awesome! As a certified meat lover \"The Butcher\" really hit the spot and is HIGHLY recommended option! The movie themed cocktail list and wood-fired oven were nice touches. Highly recommended date or weekend hangout spot. Really can't say enough good things about this place! I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Loved this place. Staff was friendly. Beer selection was great. Grilled Caesar salad was unique and tasty. Loved the big chunks of double smoked bacon. Last but not least, the pizza was excellent. 

Was able to try the pierogi, The prosciutto and arugula and the butcher. All great. 

Definitely going back."}
{"text":"I do takeout here all the time because the food is simply amazing . I have tried all their apps , a couple of their pizza and so far have enjoyed every dish. 
I dined in once and found the service mediocre."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a late lunch on a Sunday and  enjoyed our experience.   We shared their yummy green beans and their 2013 award winning pizza, not sure what it is called but the menu clearly marks it as an award winner. 

Winners for me, pretty much everything.   Robin, our server, was kind, helpful but not intrusive.   We really appreciated her accommodating our request to pay a little bit more to get more than just the standard 5 ounces of wine each glasses comes with as a standard.    5 ounces is always just a little one or two too ounces short.  6 or 7 ounces is perfect for our obviously alcoholic tendencies and she easily delivered although it was clear our request was not a common one.    

The green beans are essentially green beans with finely grated parmigiana but they still deserve high praise because they were so perfectly seasoned and perfectly cooked.   Not too hard, not too soft, just right thinks this (formally) goldilocks.  

I really appreciated the three crust options, ranging from different Italian regions as well as different crispness levels, such a nice change from other TO places.   

We took home a couple of slices and they were even better after we re-heated them at home.  

We will 100% be back.  Very nice Neighbourhood spot.   Cozy and yummy all in one."}

{"text":"Very helpful staff! AMAZING FOOD!! From appetizers, to salads, to pizzas- everything is amazing! Found this place by accident while walking in the neighborhood, but I am so happy that I stumbled upon it. I have been there already 5 times with friends and family and the quality of service and food has been maintained high.
The place is small and cozy  and during the weekend it created a wait list (which is normal) but letting you know so that you get ready for about 30 minute wait with a glass of their good selection of beer."}
{"text":"We got takeout so no real comment on service. The peeps we spoke to were nice though.

So we got two pizzas. \"The Caesar\" and The prosciutto pizza. and a couple appetizers. 

fried pickles: awesome

Bison meatballs: 3 lousy little meatballs for like 9 bucks. 3 dollars a meatball? seriously. rubbery, in an over-salted tomato sauce. I was sad when I opened the container at home.

Prosciutto pizza: Average, not much prosciutto really and the centre of the pizza was super soggy. (we're only a 4 minute walk from the restaurant so it wasn't that it was sitting for too long)

The Caesar Pizza: Ridiculous. Waste of money. Pizza crust with a TON of iceberg lettuce and some dried up old pieces of overcookd bacon and a single little piece of chicken. Avoid. Avoid. 

I'm not saying I'd never give them another chance, but this was one of those big disappointments on a very hungry friday nights."}
{"text":"There was a bit of a wait, but we were checked on regularly and made to feel like our waiting was appreciated. We did not end up ordering pizza, but it looked great. I got the Kale Salad, feeling like I needed something lighter. They were very accomodating and brought me some bread on the side when I asked. The only downside I would say is the place is rather loud, so it is difficult to have a conversation with the person your with and we were sitting very close to other customers."}
{"text":"I live around the corner from this restaurant and it is always packed every night so decided to give it a try for my birthday tonight and it totally rose to the occasion! So very happy with my experience.

The staff were so attentive and down to earth. Very accommodating and genuinely concerned with our comfort and enjoyment of the food. I shared that it was my birthday and they surprised me with a massive cream brûlée for dessert, which I totally did not anticipate. It was a very delicious crème brûlée as well with a hint of lemon and some berries below the torched surface. Probably the best crème brûlée I've ever had. 

We ordered an artichoke appetizer that came in this creamy sauce that was to die for. Our pizza crust was very soft and generously topped. Great food, great service, very cozy and feel good vibes. I can see why this is such a hot spot in Roncy! A+ :)"}
{"text":"If you're a mushroom lover, then this is the place for you. And even if you're not a mushroom lover, this will still be the place for you.

I got the Wild Mushroom pizza and my friend had the 504. We both loved our choices! The wait for the food wasn't too long, dough wasn't too thick (or thin), toppings were generous, nothing was under (or over) cooked - I really have nothing bad to say about this place. They also have a chilli oil on the side which is the perfect finishing touch. 

On another note, the serve Boreal Gelato here - aka (one of, if not) the BEST gelato in Toronto! Didn't have a chance to try any of the desserts, but I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Ambiance, character, great food and regulars. This place has so much charm, perfect for date night or small group to share a few plates with. Went for pizza, but the regulars (table next to us) highly recommended the Brussel sprouts and seafood appetizer which I plan on trying next time."}
{"text":"I just discovered this place and I ADORE it. 

First of they have one very cool dinning room. They have a very nice modern/vintage mix. The pizza prep area is also open, so you can see their gorgeous wood oven and the pizzaiolos working their magic. 

As for the menu, they have a good selection of pizzas and appetizers, but concise on the other main dishes offering. But the goal here is to eat their pizzas ;) 

My friend and I both ordered pizzas and man, they are big! 

First stop, The Butcher's pizza. If you haven't realized by it's name, this is for meat lovers. 4 different type of meats. And the difference is that they are not mixed but in 4 distinct slices. I find it interesting, you can appreciate each type of meat, it's like you ordered 4 different pizzas in one. 

Then we also shared The Expo. This pizza won the 2013 Best Traditional pizza at the Boston food fair. And it truly deserved it! The sausage went very well with the mushrooms and bufala cheese. 

We also got served pepper flakes and their homemade chilly oil. Both had a nice kick without being overly prominent on the dish. 

I also must commend the amazing service we had. The waitress was fun, very knowledgeable and made sure we did not miss of anything during dinner. 

I highly recommend this venue."}
{"text":"This place semi impressed me as it's hard to go wrong with warm woody lamp lit tones and a stove oven. 

Now, I DIDN'T order a pizza...I know right. If my gluten intolerance would give me a break that would be very different. Considering it is a pizzeria, I had to hope for the best in the case of my dinner. Usually these fancy extensive butter using European based places will fill you up with just a salad. I got some big green salad which turned out to be rather literal with the word big. So good too. By the end I was ready to break. After that we got fries and  \"crispy\" green beans. Yep, both really great. The fries are a little different just warnin yuh. The green beans really hit the spot and gave me something to take home. 

Everyone around me got pizza and I don't remember anyone saying it was anything special. The woman beside me ordered ribs. And oh.my.god. number 1: they took longer then the rest of the orders; number 2: the dead thing was HUGE and on a cutting bored. She could barley slice it. The side of beet chips were great but that's coming from a vegan, hippy, healthy, anything-vegetable-including-grass-goes person. 

The service was pretty good and the whole feel of the place was great. It's small though. One big table for a big party and the rest are pretty much date tables. It's a warm atmosphere and all that and the wine list was pretty good as far as I could tell. 

They didn't seem to know how to maintain the temperature which can really throw you off I think....

All in all, I think it's a hit or miss but in the end, it's just nice to walk outside after dinner and be on Roncesvalles."}
{"text":"My favourite pizza place in the Ronces area. It's basically packed every night of the week so it's a testament on how good this place is. Service is great, good selection of drinks and wine, and great pizzas of course. Favourite items on the menu: the 504 pizza (although I've tried a bunch of others that are also good, this one is most memorable), the wood fire chicken wings and the crispy brussel sprouts are a must! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I really loved both the atmosphere and the food. The pizza was delicious and I watched them cook it in the stone pizza oven on display at the back of the restaurant. Great wine as well. 

The only negative was our server was a little crusty and short with us. Not much interaction. 

Also the food comes really fast. I would've preferred it took longer so we could've stayed longer. I felt rushed out of there. But I guess that would be nice if you were in a hurry."}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed myself here. From the food to the decor to the staff. The pizza is great and the crust is the best. The Ceasar salad was really good too, though it was small. It was very flavorful.  The bartender was very amiable. The best thing was their dessert. The Creme Brule was so so delicious. The other dessert we got was also great. I just forgot the name. The restaurant is actually Italian and they had a cute white brick wall that they projected old movies on. It was a great atmosphere with delicious food. I would definitely go back regularly if I could."}
{"text":"There was nothing wrong with my food, the service, or the experience.  I just didn't think anything was really that good. 

The king oyster mushrooms were delicious and smoky, and if you use the accompanying dipping sauce you'll just get a mouthful of sweetness that masks the flavour of the mushrooms entirely. The pizza was ok. I appreciated that both chili flakes and a scotch bonnet hot sauce were made available. For those who like a bit of spice, chili flakes won't do much."}
{"text":"I was shocked to see only three stars out of five on this site as the average! This is the most enjoyable pizza I have ever had.
Pizzeria Defina makes neapolitan pizzas in a wood oven just like the famed Libretto, and Pizzeria Via Mercanti (whose owners used to cook pizzas at Queen Margherita). But what do  they do better? The toppingssss. They are not only more interesting than the average place, but they are plentiful. This is the only place in Toronto that has convinced me it is worth to pay more money on pizza than what you would pay at Pizzaiolo.

Not only is the food great, but one time my girlfriend left her sweater on the chair. We were then walking down Roncesvalles and someone from the restaurant chased us down and returned her sweater!

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had in Toronto, hands down. Fresh ingredients and reminds me of pizza in Europe."}
{"text":"I've heard of this place for some time and have been meaning to visit.  So glad I had the opportunity to do so.  The thin crust margherita pizza was so dainty I ate the whole thing myself.  The caesar salad had freshly grated soft bits of parmesan cheese -- to perfection.  The gentleman behind the bar was like a host -- very hospitable and friendly.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Went there for an early dinner on Friday (6pm) and was able to get a table for two without a reservation. There was soon a lineup out the door, though. 

I had the 'Bill and Ted's Excellent Sangria' which was pretty good, and the mushroom pizza which was fabulous. 

My date had a spicy pizza with sausage and hot peppers, which I had a slice of. It was pretty good, too. 

Our waitress was super nice and helpful, though the hostess was a little snotty. Oh, well. 

All in all a nice meal."}
{"text":"The food was good, the pizza was above fast food pizza. Unfortunately our waiter is such a unpleasant person. The services were extremely slow, unfriendly and inhuman. I would never come back again and I should have just ordered pizza pizza at home."}
{"text":"I have held several events at Italian restaurants in the past, and they all fell short. Yes, most of my guests seemed to love the pizza, but I am just too particular I guess. Though I do love Pizzeria Libretto - but they can't be the only restaurant (chain) in Toronto that serves delicious pizza? The kind of pizza that when you take a bite, you can savor each individual ingredient.... How is it that I like to put it? Mmm... oh, \"when the ingredients sing in perfect harmony..\" Ick! So cheesy! No pun intended. HAHA I know, I am a riot!

Anywho, so after a great deal of research, and a lot of back-and-forth, I contacted Pizzeria Defina, and OMG, Roksolana (owner) patiently put up with my million questions (poor soul), and agreed (shocking!) to give us a family style experience. Oh yeah, we are dining like one would in Nona's house in Italia--pass those plates around and mangia!

The days before this dinner were stressful! The fact was that I had no idea what we were going to be eating. Roksalana had said that my group would get to sample a few appetizers, and each person would get a couple of slices of pizza, and a dessert. This sounded fine to me when she and I initially discussed the menu, however, the week before this dinner I had gone out for brunch with friends, and the restaurant and I had agreed upon a similar deal (family style--but in this case brunch, not dinner), and that experience did not go well at all! So I guess you could say that I was panicking and maybe even traumatized. \"What if this dinner is a complete bust like the last one? I will feel incredibly guilty for dragging 10 friends to another disastrous meal.\" But I took a deep breath, and decided to take the plunge and trust Roksalana.

We arrived for our dinner at 7pm, and our table was ready for us. Shortly after our arrival, our waiter came over to our table and asked if I was there (\"is Itanni here?\"). So I introduced myself, and asked if we could wait a couple more minutes before the first course came out. At 10 after 7pm we received our first course, and let me tell you, I blew out a huge sigh of relief. Unlike my last family style experience, the portions we received at Pizzeria Defina were plentiful, and the staff was relaxed and knowledgeable. I also did not have to worry about timing, or having my guests leave hungry.

I normally review each individual dish, but in this case, I don't see the point. The review for each dish would read the same: \"wow, delicious, amazing, fresh..\" We were all blown away by the food. This was a meal of my dreams that I did not think anyone would be able to make a reality, and somehow Roksolana and her team did. We dined on dishes that were made with fresh ingredients, perfect ingredient combinations, on-the-money seasoning, vegetables grilled to perfection, perfect pizzas.... I died and went to food heaven.

From the bottom of my heart, THANK YOU Pizzeria Defina for accommodating my request, and for giving me one of the best dining experiences of my life. The food was phenomenal and I can't wait to return!

{"text":"Wandering around hungry on Roncesvalles, a friend and I decided to try this spot. Something about maple and bacon on a sandwich board was very alluring. 

The place had a nice atmosphere and smelled delicious. It was kind of empty but it was a cold Tuesday. 

We sat down. Service was very friendly. The 2 staff we met were both passionate about the food there. It's really nice to see people get excited about the menu items. We went with the special pizza of the day which had 2 different types of bacon, basil, cherry tomatoes... I think. There was more, too. Anyhow... Absolutely delicious. It came on a nice, soft dough (which was recommended over the hard dough). This pizza was amazing. 

The pizza fed 2 people nicely for $18 before tax and tip. 

The pizza here is better than most, if not all, pizza I've tried in Toronto. I really enjoyed the scotch bonnet oil; I thought that was a nice touch!

I would recommend this place for pizza for sure. It's affordable, has a nice atmosphere and friendly staff that are passionate about their food. Most importantly, it is delicious!

They told us how they won an international pizza contest in Vegas and that they were entering again. Congrats and good luck, may the best pizza win!

I'm still thinking about that pizza I had there..."}
{"text":"This pizza is to die for!! Honestly probably the best pizza I've had in Toronto to date. I love the super thin crust and how there's so many different topping options. Beautiful and cozy atmosphere too! I can't wait to come back again for dinner :)"}
{"text":"Finally authentic pizza in a city that is overrun with Pizza Pizza's, Pizza Nova's, Boston Pizza's....and such.

Left with a very good first impression, I will have to see if the second impression is going to be consistent."}
{"text":"To start we got seated right away on a Saturday night at around 7:30 for 2 people. Started off with a wild rice kale salad. It was amazing. That's coming from someone who never eats veggies let alone kale. I got a margarita which was amazing so was the fire roasted tomato. Big fan of this this place. Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"I was here for an early Saturday dinner, and found it really enjoyable. 

The pizza's flavour was excellent, although the combination of super thin base and lots of toppings left the center part pretty soft and wet - not something I would have an issue with, but I know it's a deal-breaker for some people. I got lavender creme brulee for dessert (I was torn between that and an orange and chocolate tart, the server recommended the creme brulee), and it was good. The lavender came across stronger in the smell then in the taste, but the custard was excellent. The sugar on top was a tiny bit burned in places, but it's almost impossible to find a creme brulee where that's not the case, so I can't fault them too much.

All in all, a good meal with fast and friendly service. I'd definitely recommend it to friends."}
{"text":"Consistently good food! Their pizzas are wonderful (and you can select from a couple of different types of dough) but their sides are really what do it for me! Be sure to try their Brussels sprouts!

The restaurant itself is small and always busy, but as they don't take reservations, you'd do well to go early or be prepared for a wait.

They have food and drinks feature pretty much every night to keep things interesting.  Their cocktails are pretty good, so keep an eye out for their cocktail specials.

Defina has a private event space upstairs (aptly named \"The Upstairs\") that I've used on two occasions, once for my birthday and the other time for our small wedding lunch.

The Upstairs is a bright, gorgeous space, with its own (full) bar, bathroom and AV.  There's a coat rack too.  I worked with the owner on a menu to suit both events; they charge a fee per person, and add the cost of drinks on top.  

To start off the event, they offer appertizer boards (cured meats, cheeses, fruit and roasted veg with amazing breads) as well as a welcome cocktail and can do a lovely family style table, complete with white table cloths and flowers.  It makes for a lovely ambience!  I pre-ordered a selection of food (pizzas and sides) and they brought the food out.  My only gripe was that the food could have come out sooner, but because our guests had had appetizers, they weren't starving :p

For the wedding, there were couches and a little area that served as a play area for our little guests, which was helpful.  Overall, The Upstairs is a gorgeous, intimate space that's excellent for small, intimate events!  Brava Defina!"}
{"text":"I ended up here last night with a friend after trying to go to Barque and find a two hour wait for a table.

Walking in here we were seated almost immediately near the back. The service was excellent. Though we had a regular server, there was always someone coming by to see if we needed anything or to check in. The bartender was especially friendly.

It's hard not to compare this place to Libretto. It's very similar. What I like better about these guys though is that there are more options. For around $15-18 a pie there's a wide variety of vegetarian, salami,and other cured meats. While we debated with going the traditional route, Lisa and I went with the Divina and the Roncy (Napoletana style crust). Both were excellent. I can't say I've ever had potato on a pizza before, delicious.

It was a loud crowd on this Saturday night. The place was full of small groups and couples in their late 20's and early thirties. Pretty lively all around, not a place you would want to go if you're expecting a quiet dinner with intimate conversation.

It's a pretty nice looking place and was quite busy when we walked in. The staff that got us a seat was very attentive and made sure we got a spot quickly. 

After ordering the motzarella bar, we were told that it was '86ed - the ONLY reason I knew what that meant was because of too much kitchen nightmare episodes. We then switched to the Patagonia ($26) 

The dish had a really nice skirt steak topped with a very salty and fishy crab topping. It ended up being a fishy meat and was a little confusing. Another confusing part of the plate was the arugula with blueberries and pickled eggplant. I like all three things, but together, they confused me! The cassava mash with the Stearns was quite nice and so was the fried provolone. 

For the pizza, we got the diavola ($14). This was really good. Thin and light. Just the way I like it. 

If I did go back here, it would only be for the pizza. I did want to try the wings as well."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Toronto. Rustic environment. Delicious and authentic Neapolitan pizza made in a wood burning oven! Great service too!"}
{"text":"My sister and I decided to come here right after work for dinner. We loved the ambiance of the restaurant. Small yet spacious enough , rustic and had a lot of unique decor pieces. For example they have an old school black and white movie playing from a projector on the wall. Or the wooden tree barks used as candle sticks- overall, cute decor and great atmosphere.

Staff- friendly, suggested menu options and was attentive. 

Food. We started off with the Caramelized Plum salad which came on a wooden board (unique!) and EXTREMELY delicious. The salad consists of arugula, bufala cheese, prosciutto, toasted almonds, saba vinaigrette and it also had warm plum (never had that before but it worked very well with the salad). It was delicious and I'm glad we decided to order it. Not enough for a main in my opinion though so we decided to do a salad + pizza split for the evening.

We then got our pizza. We ordered the pesto on Napoletan (which is apparently a softer thin crust). The pizza had lots of fresh and vibrant veggies such as different types of peppers, spinach, red onions and sun dried tomatoes.

You can taste the crispness of the pizza from the wood oven which was made to perfection and the pizza was extremely easy to eat. It was not soggy and not hard. The only disappointing factor was that I was not impressed with the chicken on the pizza. It just seemed bland and had no taste. Perhaps it was marinated or even tossed in the pesto that would have been better as the chunks are rather large.

They also give you a side of chili flakes and spicy olive oil which is DELICIOUS and a plus for pizza.

Overall it was a great experience and I will return :)"}
{"text":"The place is very welcoming honey feel. Food was great as well. We started with the char roasted vegetable which was great and the fried  Brussels sprouts with bacon and padano cheese that was tasty too. For the main we chose the wild mushroom pizza to die . Highly recommended if you're in the Roncy neighbourhood ."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Cosy, delicious food and nice service! It's nice to see the menu change every few months."}
{"text":"I wasn't terribly impressed with this place. Reviews looked good, so we went to check it out. In general, I'd say the combinations of flavours were a bit odd. Steak with dungeons crab bits crumbled on top? It was less surf-and-turf, more fishy-meat... Then there were blueberries and pickled eggplant on dry arugula... It kind of felt like food you'd make if you were cleaning out the fridge... But the pizza was quite good... The wait was too long, the service was average, and the food decidedly lacked lustre."}
{"text":"After a long walk through High Park my husband and I looked down to discover we'd unlocked the highest possible Sunday achievement: A freshly snoozing toddler near delicious restaurants. 

Anywhere on Roncy on the weekend is going to be filled with the melodic, sometimes dissonant, sounds of children dining. You've been warned, but don't let this deter you. There are some truly delicious options.

We slipped into Pizzeria Defina, tucked our sleeping sweetie into the corner and ordered many, many things. Brussel sprouts, meatballs, their award-winning pizza, chianti, IPAs, house-made gelato and espresso. Everything was perfect. We stayed so long our little lady eventually woke up and got to join in the pizza party, gelato first... just how toddlers like it."}
{"text":"Amazing location, food was delicious, service was superb, would like to see it expand abit too small. Loved my time there, but waited 45 minutes on a Friday evening for a table, wish we could bring our own wine and pay the corkage fee. Highly recommended! Appetizers and wings were great."}
