{"text":"I've been ordering food from this place since 2003. It seems, in the past few years, that this restaurant has become unsanitary. The last time my family and I dined-in there, the table and chairs we were seated at were sticky and the spoons were dirty. Afterward, I'd only been ordering takeout but this last time, I discovered that the cooked veggies in my takeout had not been washed thoroughly and still had dirt in them. That is quite disgusting and I'm very disappointed in their carelessness for their customers' health. I will not be ordering from this place anymore."}
{"text":"Food is always good here, although i did notice they started to microwave the roasted pork.  Anyways, when I go, there are 2 lady servers there they both are pretty good.  However, when you go and the guys are serving, you better just walk out.  the service with them are horrible.
But again, great food as always."}
{"text":"Oh so yummmm ... I can see why my fellow yelper willing to drive 50 miles round trip for this place ... (I drive ~40 round trip for this place)

It is oh so authentic ... and the price is beyond reasonable for the quality they are serving. Just as the name point out, they serve Hong Kong style food .... and oh yeah, they taste like they are straight from Hong Kong (almost ;)) 

Love the wonton noodle, fried beef noodle, and many more ... and the roast duck, chicken, pork and all are awesome as well .... be adventurous and try them out !!! you won't regret your drive to this place"}
{"text":"4 stars for roasted meats.  Stars deducted for poor attitude from owner.

Good Chinese roast meats and authentic Cantonese cooking in a former Thai buffet restaurant space.

I was excited to see Roast Duck \"Lai Fun\" Noodle Soup but was disappointed when the lai fun turned out to be more like udon.  Lai fun is the classic noodle accompaniment to roasted goose in Hong Kong.  It's silky and delicate - this one was thick and heavy.  

When I protested to the server, she passed me on to the owner who said this is what lai fun is like in the US.  I was outraged - how can you  use this as an excuse especially when the dish was advertised in Chinese only?  Obviously whoever could read it would know what it's supposed to be like.  You don't pass off fettucine for spaghetti just cuz you're in another country!

I hate how people like this give Chinese service a bad rap."}
{"text":"This is a filthy place.  Several times I saw cockroaches crawling around.  The service is terrible.  Only thing I like is their barbecue items.  Now I don't even go there because Mekong has better barbecue."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sun evening before my usual 6PM mtg and found it strangely quiet, but still quite busy as orders were being filled and dispatched. An entire roast suckling pig was soon on display for customer pickup. This is indeed where this restaurant shines: Cantonese siu laap -- roast meats -- usually in pork and duck varieties, but you'll also find chicken and occasionally cuttlefish too. Only saw pork and duck here in various combos. Had the rice plate combo with foh yuk, roast pork belly with the crackling skin, and cha siu, which is the red, slightly sweet glazed roast pork loin, hopefully with some char on it. Absolutely outstanding. The \"five heavenly layers\" that make up a good piece of roast pork belly were all present, the skin was cracklingly crisp, and the slight sweet char on the cha siu provided a nice contrast of textures and flavors. Spicy salt & pepper squid came with a breading that didn't appeal to me (I like cornstarch instead) but flavors were what I expected. Great meal."}
{"text":"I used to come to this place a lot with my family when I was a kid. After many years of not eating here, I took my friend Carmon here for lunch hoping for some fantastic duck noodle soup. The duck was great, but the soup itself did not have much flavor, and they gave a skimpy portion of noodles. Our waiter was weird too, he took a long time to get us our hot tea and he brought each of us our food at different times. If you ever come here, get a whole duck or roasted pork to go. Those are the only good food items here."}
{"text":"Roast BBQs are quite good and reasonably priced, other food are also good.  Service is OK, but surroundings could be cleaner and tidier."}
{"text":"The service is so ridicous bad?the watress says nothing good to us?because someone has not paid the tips for last meal?"}
{"text":"I have been looking for a place since I moved out here that has GREAT fried rice.  On Christmas Eve, this place did not disappoint.  Delicious food ad quick take-out. Yum"}
{"text":"I started eating here 8 years ago.  It was recommended by a Chinese friend when I complained that I was unable to find a place that offered 'chow fun'. I have noticed a substantial decline in quality and service over the past 3 years. Even the portion sizes have decreased (as a rice entree would provide at least 3-4 meals now has changed to 2-3). It is still my quick go-to chinese restaurant. My fav items are:
!. Salted Fish and Chicken Fried Rice
2. Chicken Chow Fun with Black Bean Sauce (sub out from the beef)
3. Pork Chops and Onion Rice Plate
4. Eggplant with Spicy Peanut Sauce (great vegetarian option)
Yes, the decor and service leave much to be desired but I mainly get the items to go (whether it's picking it up on way into the office (lunch) or picking it up on the way home.
Overall assessment, tasty food, somewhat reasonable prices, bad decor and service.  If it's all the about the food for you, I would recommend this place.  If you want the full monty (including atmosphere and service), you may want to skip this place.  That's okay... more for me!"}
{"text":"We always wanted to go this place due to the fact that many other Hong Kong Chinese restaurants are really good and it seem like it was like a great authentic Chinese food place to go to.  This is by far the worst place i have ever been. 
 I ordered the egg fu yung, it came with 3 patties, just green onions on top and gravy. no other vegetables or other condiments like I have at other places and worst of all it was burnt.
 We ordered Peking Pork Chops and it tasted like orange chicken, try figure. 
And last we ordered Seafood Chow fun, it was slimy and seafood was chewy, uncooked and no flavor what so ever.  
The top it all off, we were not offered any other drinks, server just gave us water that tasted so bad due to the fact probably because the glass cups were not washed well as you could see other lip stains. We all felt grossed out and sick after and my 3 year old daughter was nauseated  all the way home.  Me and my wife had a headache as well. Probably because, i presumed of the MSG and uncooked seafood and the overcooked egg fu yung.  
Last, it was 105 degrees outside and I was sweating like a pig inside with there ceiling fans off and the A/C prob seem like it was set at 90 degrees.
First and last time at this place."}
{"text":"If you're looking for Chinese BBQ then it's a moderate choice as well as the occasional Cantonese style steamed seafood. Limit your expectations for rice or noodle dishes tho..."}
{"text":"So the roasted duck was delicious in flavor, HOWEVER the prices were kinda outrageous and the duck was microwaved.  I paid 9.50 for half a roasted microwaved duck, and 8.99 for a platter of mediocre appetizers (2 egg rolls, 2 ribs, 2 crab puffs, and 2 skewers).  The food was SLIGHTLY warm and got cold the minute I started eating.  THE WORST PART was when I paid and the waitress harassed me into tipping her more even though the service was mediocre.  I barely had enough for the forced tip and felt uncomfortable with her harassment.  Not eating in again, I'll take my duck to go."}
{"text":"This was the worst Chinese food I've ever had. I ordered cashew chicken lunch special. The only thing I touched was the crab puff. The waitress never asked what we wanted to drink, and never came back to check on the food. Terrible service."}
{"text":"I visited Best Hong Kong due to my friend from Tempe who told me he had to stop by here every time he came back home.  Raved about the duck.  I've never understood duck...very little meat and bony.  Why not just eat chicken?  Anyways...

We were greeted by a very non enthusiastic male server who seemed to grunt more than speak.  I thought maybe it was a language barrier...but my buddy said he was his least favorite waiter and a horrible one at that.  We both work in the service industry and are very sensitive to bad service.  He took our order competently and brought us back cokes and waters (always order water!!).  He brought the food out and was not very agile in placing our plates (my buddy ordered for both of us and always listens to his stomach!).  Twice I thought he was going to put a plate on top of a plate...I hate when I have to move stuff around for them to place it.  After that...we didn't hear from him until he brought the check...even the sound of a straw being sucked with little beverage failed to get his attention.  Finally a girl who was hanging out by the kitchen spotted us and brought refills.  The service was the worst part...

The food was incredible.  My buddy ordered a 1/2 duck, 1/2 chicken, pepper pork chops, beef chow fun and Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce.  

I've never had duck this good.  This duck was actually meaty (still bony, but what can you do right).  Very, very good.  Blew the chicken away.  The chicken was good too...but it was a very familiar taste.  Beef chow fun isn't my favorite noodle, i prefer chow mien, but I went with it and it was good.  The pepper pork chop was very good.  I think i ate more of that then anything else.  The Chinese broccoli was delicious and I ate many stalks of it (and I'm pretty much anti-vegetable unless prepared perfectly).  

I hear they have other servers that are better and I'd recommend going in on their days of work.  The food is incredible and I'd definitely give this place 5 stars if the service was superb."}
{"text":"I've only ordered from here, but have done it about 5 times now. The language barrier with the people who take your order over the phone makes it pretty difficult, but if you can get past that the Mongolian Beef is sooo worth it! I love that stuff! Its spicy and the grilled onions are amazing. I didn't even know I liked onions that much! 
But the eggrolls are greasy and just taste bad. I don't think you should have to cover them in sweet and sour sauce to make them good. Also one time I had the Kung Pao chicken and it wasn't even kind of special. I was bored with it and halfway into it looking for somethng else to eat. 

I don't know, maybe I shouldn't give this place such a good review then, but the rice and mongolian beef make me love getting food from here"}
{"text":"Service is sooo bad!!! Don't want to go there any more. A server there said she doesn't welcome ASU's students. Also, she seems like impatient when we order."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in the valley...particularly when the owner is there.  I asked them to make me a special dish that my husband (who is Chinese) cooks for me and they whipped it right up.  Went back another time and asked for the same but the waitress didn't quite understand and it wasn't so good.  Other than that one time, it's always great.  This food is the real deal!"}
{"text":"It's not a very luxurious place, but the food is amazing! It's a pretty good value too. I wouldn't go there on a date since it's not too fancy, but with friends or family, it would work just fine."}
{"text":"I used to go here frequently for family diners. They always easily accommodated our large groups. I have never seen the place packed but it is usually decently full.

I have so many dishes that I love that it is hard not to spend a fortune when going there so now that I live on my own I save this place for special occasions and good paychecks.

The duck is my favorite of any duck I have gotten before.

I also love the black bean chicken, garlic green beans, and salty pepper pork.

It's always been clean when I have gone. The bathrooms are very nice though the locks haven't worked on multiple occasions."}
{"text":"Went here on Thanksgiving, the duck lo mein was awesome.  The service was very good also, would highly recommend.  I will come back here again sometime soon."}
{"text":"Pregnancy cravings!  BEST Chinese roast duck (sui op) and roasted white pork (sui yuk) in town.  I live down the street from Phoenix Palace, but I make the drive here.

In the appetizer section, you can order the 2 BBQ combination.  In the rice plate section, you can choose one of the plates and it comes with rice and some vegetables.

NOM NOM NOM."}
{"text":"I've been eating here since I first moved to the area in 1996. I absolutely LOVE this place. The roasted duck, Hong Kong style chow mein, the salty pepper pork and salty pepper squid. It just doesn't get any better. They give you a very authentic and home-made feeling with their culinary creations. High recommend."}
{"text":"Best of Hong Kong,  This has been probably my favorite Chinese place in the Valley.  I don't think they necessarily have the best tasting food, but their food reminds me a lot of my parent's cooking.  I tend to take co-workers there, they have really cheap lunch specials and a lot to chose from.  I usually end up getting off work, and spot by and grab it to go.  They have really good food and would recommend this place.  The service can be slow, but it's mostly because they have 1 or 2 waitress that take care of the entire place.  It's a family owned restaurant and has had some changes in the Kitchen.  In my opinion, I don't think the food is as good as it once was, it's fallen off a little.  Still give it a try, good Cantonese Style cooking."}
{"text":"After living in Asia for many years, I find that this restaurant has flavors most similar to those that I have come to love.  Definitely one of the most authentic!! We find that we never go wrong with the Roast Duck, Spicy Green Beans, Pepper Shrimp, and Stuffed Tofu."}
{"text":"Massive disappointment. Apps were greasy and bland. My entree was also not good (beef chow fun with black bean sauce). The texture of the meat was weird and the sauce had literally no flavor. 

I'd love to say something good about this local joint, but there really isn't anything that stands out. The person we dealt with was friendly, but that's about the only memorable thing, if that counts."}
{"text":"Best Peking Duck!!! Over the top GREAT service! I made reservations for Dec. 25th.  It was very busy but they seated us immediately. Our entire party was extremely pleased with their meals. The staff was VERY kind & accommodating."}
{"text":"It was ok.  I wanted to like it more.  We found it on YELP while my daughter was in the hospital at Cardon's.  She wanted egg drop soup which, by the way, was very good (little too much tofu for me).  My wife liked the hot and sour soup and the crab puffs were good.  Egg roll was a little mushy.  Portions were small considering, but prices were very reasonable ($5.15 for lunch special).  The reason I gave it 3 stars instead of 4 is that there is no orange chicken on the lunch menu and the sweet and sour pork I got had some nasty fat chunks in half of the pieces I got.  One I had to spit out into my napkin because I couldn't chew it up.  Even with that said, I would probably try it again because everything else was good and the price was fair."}
{"text":"Not the prettiest place nor the best service in town either but the food is good. Although good I still gave it 3 stars because the menu is inconsistent. If they would serve only duck, roast pork or char siu then this would be 5 stars all the way! But if you order outside of that then it's hit or miss. 

Just like they have in China town shops they have the duck and char siu hanging in an heating box where you can see the food before ordering. You can order it whole or by the pound or you can order them as a combo which they call rice plate. I order the 2 meat combo which comes with 2 meats of your choice stacked on top of a pile of white rice. My 2 meats are roast pork and duck, watch out because they give you enough for lunch and dinner. The duck is cooked perfect where it's still moist and juicy. The roast pork is a roasted slab of pork belly and they chop it up bite size for you. The best part of it all is it's only $11!?!?"}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant several times. I love the roasted duck. The duck is a must because it is so delicious. They sell a lot of authentic Chinese food here which is a plus. The food comes out quick and the service is good. It's a decent place and I will keep coming back when I am in the area."}
{"text":"I had lunch there the first time. Mongolian Beef, Crab Puffs & Egg Rolls were outstanding. Definitely my new 'Go-to' Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"I have been here a half dozen times.  What you see is what you get.  It's all about the food.  This place has been here for many years... and the staff has as well.  This is serious Chinese food.  Are looking to get it right?  Come here."}
{"text":"The very best lunch specials!  Cashew chicken is our favorite along with the delectable garlic green beans!"}
{"text":"This is as close to authentic Chinese food as you can get in AZ. The fresh steamed fish is delicious. I drive from the other side of town just for lunch. Great service and reasonable prices. There is never a wait! I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Barbecue with rice a very simple but delicious meal.  Portion size is pretty good and I tastes great."}
{"text":"If I could, I'd pin a medal on Best Hong Kong for the stupendously good Pork and Oyster Hotpot I had there the other night. At 8 pm on a Sunday night, the place was busy (with about 2 dozen Chinese and me) and the service was very good. Not a fancy place, but it's all about the food--and the food is seriously good."}
{"text":"Ok. So we came here on a coworker's suggestion. Don't know why because I wouldn't ask his opinion on anything but my other coworkers figured they could trust him on this one. So here we were - four of us on a Saturday night. The mall was kinda hopping because there were a few spots here that were still destinations at this time of the evening - Asiana Market, Hodori Korean Restaurant, Saketini, and Best Hong Kong Dining. Oh yeah, there's also an Oregano's. So we go into the restaurant and it has a funky layout like a diner where you walk through to the cashier and then they seat you - there are rails that sort of force you to walk past the hanging ducks. This place seems to be known for its duck so I was determined to have some. We were seated and given water immediately - love that delicious chemical flavored local tap water. We then put in our orders and waited a while. Luckily we were entertained by some of the other clientele. There was this dude with extremely glittery shoes. I refrained from taking a photo lest the owner of the glittery shoes figured I was mocking him and ends up being a kung fu expert - breaking out into martial arts and/or a Michael Jackson video. Either way I'd be a goner. Googling \"chinese glittery shoes fashion trend\" got me nowhere - this guy was clearly ahead of the pack. Then our food finally came. My coworkers got some boring standards like fried eggrolls, rangoons, crab puffs, etc. I got the duck lo mein that somebody mentioned in a Yelp review - thank you fellow yelper! That was a winning dish for me. Awesome juicy duck with tasty skin together with cabbage and noodles. Noodles were a little greasy but the whole thing together was delicious. Gave some pieces of duck to the coworkers and they all were feeling buyer's remorse about their own plates. Place itself has very much a diner like feel to it and service is good but a tad on the slow side at times. I was full by the time I finished my meal. Price is actually very good for what you get - can't complain there. Parking? In a mall with a bunch of other restaurants so you get what you get. Watch out for the people coming from Saketini - those folks wouldn't know the difference between a mall parking lot and Phoenix International Raceway if you hit them on the head with an eggroll. Will I be back? For the duck lo mein in a skipped heartbeat!"}
{"text":"I couldn't be more upset and dissappointed after eating here. I've passed this restaurant on my way home everyday for the last seven plus years and have been missing out on exceptional Chinese cuisine.  Egg roll...deeeelish!  Tonight we had the General's chicken and it was zesty, sweet and though covered in sauce it was very crispy. We also ordered the Mongolian beef which really brought out the sweetness of the chicken.  The chicken brought out the spicy flavors of the shallots and pepper sauce and all I can say is these two were meant to be ordered together. Last but not least was the vegetable chow mein, ...all I can say is it was a meal by itself.  Firm noodles, crisp broccoli, celery,  snow peas,  and perfect seasoning.  I'm seriously upset I have cheated myself out of some great dishes for so long."}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese restaurant in town! The roasted duck is the best and the price is very reasonable comparing with other Chinese restaurants."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese place hands down. Since I've come back from China I tend to stay away from \"Chinese food\", this is the only place I ever go religiously when I get that pang for homecooked Chinese food. Everything is amazing, and they have the best duck I've had in America. NTM I can order in Mandarin Chinese and they don't look at me like I'm crazy because the nice lady at the front speaks Cantonese AND Mandarin."}
{"text":"Picked up lunch to go.   Ordered the beef and broccoli for about 6 bucks.  The portion was average sized and came with fried rice, an egg roll, and a wonton with sweet and sour sauce.  

The beef and broccoli had mushrooms and carrots mixed in and had a nice light sauce.  The rice was good and had fried egg in it.  The wonton and eggroll were both nice light and crisp.  

Nothing ground breaking but nicely done and I would try it again."}
{"text":"As I come in on a Thursday evening, I did not expect it to be this packed! I was drawn in by the reviews of the roasted duck over rice.

There was this one poor older Asian lady (totally reminded me of my mom because of her looks), was the waitress for all 10 tables to herself! Running food, taking orders, answering the phone, it was insane. I saw that another slightly younger lady was helping her out a little, but I almost felt bad for the older lady. Despite the chaos, she still took the time to answer my annoying questions about the food.

Even though it took a while for the older one to get to me and get my order of duck with fried rice in, the dish came out QUICK.. piping hot, fresh, and big for 6 bucks (2 dollars extra for changing white rice to fried rice). A little greasy, but I expected it from duck. The older lady came to check on me and I felt so bad that she was busting her ass and nobody was really helping.

However, incredibly AUTHENTIC and a great deal. As I was leaving, I told the older lady that she works too hard, lol. She thanked me and laughed, and ran off to help other customers."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place out after I had a sudden craving for century egg and pork porridge. I also ordered 1/4 roast duck. The porridge was delicious, with a nice ginger flavor to counteract the century eggs. The roast duck however was much too greasy and some of the other dishes were too salty. Make sure you drink plenty of water."}
{"text":"The food is so good here and inexpensive! They have the best roasted duck and roasted pork meat! A plate of Half duck of pork with rice is only $6.49. The portions are huge. I also like their sizzling plates and their porridge soup. Definetly tasty food. However, service is rough. A hot or miss."}
{"text":"I had the tofu curry lunch special. The portion of food was very small, the picture makes it look like more than it actually was. There wasn't much flavor to the food. I don't think I even tasted any curry. The fried rice had way too much eggs in it, more than I've ever seen in chinese rice. Didn't enjoy my meal. Another chinese restaurant I won't be going back to in Arizona. I miss New York City!"}
{"text":"This place is the real deal.  BBQ pork, roast pork, and duck are best in town.   Veggies are definitely worth the price.  Fried Hong Style Noodles are also a favorite."}
{"text":"Well, some dishes are good and some dishes are not so good.  Portions on the small side compared with ACE and Mekong Palace a mile north.  3 1/2 rounded up to 4."}
{"text":"The parking lot is dimly lit.the restaurant  is very dated. It was not very busy about 4 tables at 8.00 pm . We ordered barbeque  pork.  It was dry and overcooked.  Also ordered wonton soup . The broth was salty the only vegetables  were nappa cabbage .the wanton did not taste fresh. We then had beef chow fun the noodles looked old and the beef was tough and salty  . Prices were cheap. Not a place that I would recommend"}
{"text":"Pretty tasty and authentic!
We tried their beef brisket pot, it is very tender, tasty, and pretty good size! It is one of the best beef brisket I have tasted after moving here from hk.
They also has roast duck, BBQ pork, crispy skin pork and all looks great and delicious!! There are live fish in the tank, and I saw some customers order steam fish, which looks really good and fresh !
Orders arrive pretty quick, will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Came here with my parents because they were raving about the roasted duck noodle soup. The soup was OK but I think the aspect that stuck out the most was the portion and cuts of duck they give you are very generous, none of that small portions with 90% bone and 10% meat nonsense. The broth was decent but the noodles weren't great. They were typical thin, Chinese soup noodles so there wasn't anything amazing or off-putting about them. Our food came out very quickly and overall service was good. I'd probably come back here to try some of their rice plates or eat family style but would not order the duck noodle soup again, sorry mom and dad!"}
{"text":"We always come here for duck noodle soups. They have very good BBQ pork and duck. Their price is on the low side and their portions are good. Sometimes I feel the restaurant is not very clean, i just look the other way."}
{"text":"In short: A monument to crappy-ness.  Decent food muddled by horrible service, becoming a bit overpriced as well.

Well what can I say about best hong kong?  Rather than going on a tirade of negativity, I'll list the good things about it.  The food is decent, half the time...... well that's it, I guess.  Now the tirade: When you go sit there, it doesn't inspire you to eat.  Looks dirty everywhere, it may not be actually dirty but you just feels creeped out.  The staff is rude from owner/hostess up front, any one of the non english speaking waiters, and the bussers.  To get something extra like rice or water is like taking a kidney from them.  Food is sometimes good on not so oily but it's hit or miss really.  Only reason I go there is for the duck, it's probably one of the better dishes anywhere.  I don't bother dining in anymore, just get my duck and vamoose. It used to be pretty affordable, but over time the prices have gone up a lot.  When I started coming here the whole duck was 12$ now half a duck is 10$. 

Although I have never been chased by the staff, two of my friends were chased out to the parking lot demanding 15% or more on the tips.  There service is probably deserves a -15%, it's that bad.  I'm really surprised by the general disregard for customers.  Another funny thing is that the staff understands english pretty well but if you have a complaint then they pretend like they are hearing english for the first time.  It's pretty funny to see.  Don't go here if you can help it."}
{"text":"Food was okay, I just don't like the smell of dirt in the air!"}
{"text":"Best chinese food in phoenix area...must try sweet sour chicken chow fun and chow mien my favorites!!!!"}
{"text":"I didn't have any issues with service that previous reviewers had, but I can't really see myself going back to this place. The food wasn't bad, it was actually pretty decent, but it wasn't a \"Wow, I can't wait to go back!\" kind of experience. 

I guess what it comes down to is that I can't knock the place for being bad, because it certainly wasn't, but there are at least three other Asian restaurants and an Oregano's in the same tiny strip mall, and I kind of wish I chose any of them instead."}
{"text":"I gotta share something with you other yelpers.  My late wife always used to tell me this, but being the non-learner that I am, I have not listened.....but on Friday, I went to have some lunch here with a friend.  The food was OK again -- not great, not bad, but acceptable as Cantonese food goes.  But I also wanted a whole roasted duck and about 2# of roast pork so I ordered that too and asked them to cut that up and just put it into take home containers for me.  But I what I did not do, which I should have done, is go to the deli counter and watch what they were doing.  They gave me the driest, oldest duck they had and the burnt and fatty piece of roast pork.  My wife always told me that Chinese restaurants are notorious for doing crap like that, and she should know being Chinese herself.  I must always remind myself to remember that and always remember to listen to the advice of my wife!!!  These places always give the crap stuff to unsuspecting customers.  I should have know better -- my bad!!"}
{"text":"Need a roast pig or roast duck?  Get your delicious meat here!  I love getting the duck from this place.  On holidays such as Thanksgiving or Chinese new year, you'll have to come early or they'll be sold out.

Oh, and their cha siu (bbq pork) is tasty too!"}
{"text":"Excellent Cantonese Chinese food!  I tried the Kung Pau Chicken today and it was excellent.  The menu appears to have many options.  Give this place a chance when you are in the area...you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"According to my fiancé (who is Chinese, and has been here far more than me), this place can be pretty hit-or-miss. However, this review will be based on the experience that I had at this restaurant.

Basically, I love duck, roasted duck especially. So when my fiancé told me about this place, I was stoked. We visited together for the first time last night and got half a roast duck and pork with garlic sauce. Their duck is awesome (seriously awesome), and their pork turned out to be great. The only thing I wished was a little better was their rice. I thought the staff was really nice, though; it seemed like they were genuinely happy that I enjoyed their food. I'll definitely be coming back for that duck."}
{"text":"If I could rate this place 0 stars I would. My girlfriend and I both got super sick from the food here and she's a vegetarian and I'm not. We ordered completely different types of food yet the outcome was the same. We both ended up spending the rest of our Saturday night vomiting and regretting ever setting foot in this so called restaurant. First of all the only reason we tried this place is the fact that there are so many great reviews. This is absolutely the strongest evidence against the corruption that yelp has been accused of. These reviews have to be a complete farce or I'm surround by a ton of fully mentally challenged foodies. When we first walked in we knew something was off by the smell of the place. It has that same dirty smell that most asian supermarkets have. Everyone was completely rude to us and once they saw us the woman working the register actually took the menu out of the bag, almost hinting that they didn't want us ordering from them again. As terrible as the service was the food was one hundred times worse. So bad that not only did we get the worst food poisoning ever but we couldn't even eat more than a couple bites of the entrees. This place deserves to be shut down and placed on some sort of quarantine by the government. Don't listen to any of these other reviews on here they are obviously paid for and if you do decide to chance it, we'll god bless you and I hope you cancel all of your planes for the rest of the evening."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here Saturday evening with another couple.  The place was pretty dead so we were seated right away.  We were also the only non-Asians there so this was a good sign that this was an authentic place.  The general look of this place also set the vibe that this was authentic as you can get in Arizona...you know...with the hanging roast ducks and pork, the non-English as a first language staff, etc.  Anyway, I was looking forward to this meal.  What I wasn't looking forward to was the service.  Almost every single Yelp review slams this place's service.  Almost everybody thinks it is horrible and even the people that we went with had dined there before and said it wasn't very good.  I however thought the service wasn't bad at all and was actually pretty good.  Sure our waiter didn't speak very good English which made it a bit difficult but he was pretty friendly, brought everything we asked for (forks, napkins, etc.), didn't screw up our order and was super fast with my diet coke refills.  So I have absolutely no complaints on the service.

The food:

* Sizzling rice soup = pretty good.  I want to try the hot and sour next time though.
* Lo Mein = pretty standard like every other place but it was very good.
* Sliced roast pork = excellent and not overly sauced
* Salty fish and chicken fried rice = I have no idea why we ordered this and really wasn't my choice but my friend insisted we try it.  It actually wasn't as bad as it sounds but it was in fact a bit weird for my palate.  I think I should stick to fried rice without the fish though next time.

Anyway, the place is definitely worth a try.  Just don't let the look of the place or most of these reviews scare you away."}
{"text":"If I  could give this restaurant 10 stars, I  would. Being from the Bay Area, I am extremely critical of any Chinese Food. I  decided to give this a try for our Chinese New Year dinner since I was down here in Phoenix for business and was going to miss our annual celebrations.
A very hospitable woman greeted us and asked what type of tea we wanted.  The server was very prompt and attentive and each time she came to our table, she had a beautiful smile on her face.  
The food was excellent..we had the combination tofu hot(clay) pot, pork belly with preserved vegetables,  clams in black bean sauce, pea sprouts in garlic sauce and Westlake beef soup.  All came out in perfect succession.  Truly a Chinese Food delight in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"The first thing that strikes you when you walk into this restaurant is the array of barbequed and roasted meats hanging next to the register. If you are familiar with such roasted delights, this sight immediately reminds you of some of the best that Cantonese food has to offer. For those who are seeing this for the first time, it can definitely be intimidating. But fear not, this is one case in which a little gastronomic bravery really pays off. And one thing is for certain, Best of Hong Kong Dining certainly knows its Chinese BBQ. The BBQ pork, roast duck, and roast pork are as good as anything I've had in the Phoenix Metro area. 

Unfortunately, thats the highlight of this restaurant. This isn't to say that food there isn't good. I've been there quite a few times and each time had a decent meal. Growing up in a Chinese family, I've learned to take my Chinese food very seriously and can safely say that the food here is pretty decent - not spectacular, but not bad. 

As for the service...let's be honest. The majority of Asian restaurants in general have this type of service. It can border on rudeness and even be strangely unnerving, but in a Chinese restaurant, its all about the food. 

If you are looking for great Hong Kong-style barbeque and decent authentic Chinese, this would be a fair choice."}
{"text":"The roast duck and char siu are delicious! I've tried their other dishes but none of them really stand out to me. Service is not always consistent."}
{"text":"Authentic Cantonese style food. Pork belly was crunchy. Hot and sour soup was on point. Bbq pork and duck were very good."}
{"text":"the restaurant formerly known as the best hong kong.

what happened to this place?  this used to be our go-to chinese restaurant in the east valley!

the food has gone down hill and the service which used to be 3/5 has gone to 1/5.

there was this young college age kid/busboy/waiter (who knows, he could have been older, just add 10 years to what you think they are) who actually chased us out the door and demanded that we leave 15% tip when we only left 10%....what a dufus

hello, we're trying to send you a message idiot.  i guess the best message is to not eat there and tell 100 other people to do the same

you shall be called \"Worst Hong Kong\""}
{"text":"My husband and I have been going here for years and they never disappoint. We like their king pao chicken. Also, every time I'm sick my husband comes here to get me their chicken porridge."}
{"text":"Chinese broccoli w/oyster sauce and combo roast duck/ roast pig. Roast pig selection was full of fat and they also threw in bbq pork which I didn't want! ;(

The Chinese broccoli w/oyster sauce was pretty bomb though! Roast duck was ok!

Overall there were a lot of Chinese people eating in here so I'm sure they must have something that taste superb!"}
{"text":"We wanted to have chinese one night for dinner in honor of Chinese New Year so we chose to come here Friday night. I know there are plenty of options near us but specifically we wanted good roast duck and was steered here upon my search.

We had: 

2 BBQ Combination Plate (Roast Duck & Roast Pork) - was a bit turned off by seeing them put this in the microwave before bringing it to the table. But it tasted good and the skins were still crispy so I guess it wasn't too bad.

Pan Fried Seafood Chow Mein- our favorite dish here. My BF is a sucker for this dish anywhere we go and it did not disappoint. Noodles were crispy and gravy was pretty tasty. 

Beef and Egg Sauce over Rice- This was a bit of a disappointment for me. It tasted very bland. Also, the rice was not jasmine rice which made it a bigger let down. (I hate when Chinese places use cheap rice, it ruins the whole dinner for me.)

Green Beans w Minced Pork- I love sauteed green beans at Chinese restaurants. This was okay. A little too salty for my liking. It would be perfect to eat with rice and yet again, if only there were nice and fluffy jasmine rice to accompany this dish. It would have made it better. 

It wasn't an awful meal, but it was nothing remarkable either. There were some dishes I did enjoy (bbq plate and crispy chow mein). But I can find better variations of these dishes elsewhere. 

Portions are plenty, we had sooo much leftovers. And for 4 dishes it cost us a bit over $30 which was definitely a steal."}
{"text":"I'd come for their bitter melon & beef dish again.

Wonton noodle soup, roast duck, and chow fun were average."}
{"text":"Went to eat here expecting a Chinese food dining experience but got a little bit disappointed. Order a Kung Pao Beef but it's really sour, Seafood Tofu kinda plain and need a Lil bit more salt, but their Pork Chop is good. The service is excellent, the only problem that I had is the food taste is just okay. Overall if I'm looking to eat pork chop I'll probably drop by but in the mean time I'll keep on browsing for other chinese food restaurant in the area."}
{"text":"Had the Mongolian beef with fried rice, crab puff, egg roll, and egg flower soup. All this for just $5.65! The crab puff was the best I've ever had, but the egg roll was just average. The fried rice and Mongolian beef were excellent and the egg flower soup was above average. The food was ready quickly. I did not order any beverage since there was none listed on the menu and the server never asked if I wanted anything to drink. However, the elderly gentleman at the next table was sipping some tea with a metal tea pot next to his cup. Darn! I would have ordered tea if I knew that was an option. The menu was in both Chinese and English. Chinese speakers walked in and placed orders. 

An older Asian woman took care of everything from seating guests, to taking orders, to serving orders, to busing tables, to ringing everything up. She was awesome. There appeared to be one other employee cooking in the back. The decor is eclectic Chinese and there are roasted ducks hanging in a case and live fish (in a tank that really needs to be cleaned). Interestingly, I could not find any roast duck items on the lunch menu. Maybe it is a dinner time thing only?

This Hong Kong restaurant is located in a strip shopping center on the corner of Dobson and Southern Ave and is adjacent to a Korean, Vietnamese, and another Chinese restaurants and an Asian grocery store. There is parking close to the door, but the parking lot is very busy so finding a parking spot can be challenging.

I would return again to try other dishes."}
{"text":"One of the best Chinese places I have gone to in Phoenix. Their Orange Chicken is amazing, and I'm really picky about my Orange Chicken. My husband really loves this place, and we have converted his family to them as well. Will continue coming as long as we live in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Wow! Great food, and every bit as good as the best chinese restaurant in San Francisco, CA. 
I am 3rd generation chinese american, born and raised in SF chinatown, now living in Arizona. My Mom is 89 years old and just moved from San Francisco to Mesa, AZ last week. We had fresh Sea Bass (from the tank, it doesn't get fresher), Chinese Beef Stew (a family favorite, but fatty and grisly - order only if you appreciate fat and grisle), Roast Duck (best I've ever had), chinese greens (choose which one you want, you will get boring bok choy) with chinese black mushrooms (prepared to perfection), chicken corn soup (will order again!), and mixed chow fun (good, but it is a simple/common dish, not usually too exciting anyway). ALL was very very good, prepared just right. My Mom said \"This restaurant is every bit as good as the best in San Francisco\"  (Mom is not only a GREAT cook of chinese food herself, she is a gourmet chinese food 'snob' of sorts - and I mean that in the best way possible.)  If all goes well, we will be having her 90th Birthday Banquet here in a few months!"}
{"text":"I am giving it 5 stars based on value and taste.  Presentation is not fantastic, and decor of the restaurant isn't great either.  However, you get tasty, no-frills Chinese food for little out of pocket expense.  I personally love the roasted duck, which is hanging in a heated box when you walk in (which is how all no-frills chinese joints should keep their duck).  It is by far the best roasted duck I have had in town.  Their Char-shiu pork (red chinese BBQ) is pretty darn good.  I can eat that stuff like candy it is so sweet.  

Other favorites are the beef with green beans, sweet and sour (chicken, shrimp, pork....doesn't matter), and the chow mein.  I would recommend this to anyone that is on a budget and wants some relatively authentic Chinese food.  Sure, they have the Americanized stuff on the menu, but there are tons of fresh options that I haven't tried that are probably good.  I only say that because I have never had a bad meal there."}
{"text":"By far my favorite In Arizona. I stumbled upon this place nearly a year ago and I've been coming back ever since."}
{"text":"Best HK = best roast pork
The roast pork and roast duck offered here is, in my humble opinion, yummier than Phoenix Palace and Great Wall. 
The crunch on the skin of the roast pork is mouthgasmic  their century egg porridge is the very definition of comfort food, and their garlic A-chai (a vegetable dish) is A-mazing. Keeping it short because the smiley waitress is walking towards my table with garlic bean sprouts!!"}
{"text":"I bought their roast duck, which was tasty for Phoenix standards, but got sick and minor rashes on my body after eating it.  This has happened consistently that I no longer trust eating the roast duck here.  It wasn't food poisoning but rather someone with a cold prepared the duck and got like a minor cold and rashes on my legs.  

I had to take antibiotics to remove most of the rashes.  The rest of the rash disappeared only after I did a herbal detox.  It took a month to remove the rashes.  I am scared to eat here again."}
{"text":"The place was amazing ! What we tried was Beef with green beans and they were FRESH! Won ton soup was SUPER AWESOME and we absolutely loved it!!!!! We went there 3 times and this was our 4th time! I recommend this place! It is Amazing:))"}
{"text":"We've been here a few times now, and I generally get my staple: the roast duck rice plate. It's the cheapest duck in town, and it's damn good! $6 for a good size serving of duck and rice that will often last me two meals, you really can't beat that. My partner is a fan of the egg drop soup. If you're lucky enough to be there around lunch time, the lunch specials are great! The kung pao chicken is spicy and flavorful, the Mongolian beef is tender and some of the best I've had in town. But honestly, the main reason I go here is the duck. It's worth it!"}
{"text":"Roasted duck is mediocre. The duck skin is not very crisp, but the seasoning is fine. The char siu is extremely fatty and unless you want to be eating a plate of mostly fat, I would not recommend this. I cannot recall the other dishes we ordered, but I distinctly remember all of the portions served here are on the small side for their price. On the plus side, this place features traditional Cantonese dishes."}
{"text":"Excellent food, but horrible service.  I normally do take-out since the service is slow and not very attentive.  This place has authentic Chinese food at pretty good prices.  It lacks atmosphere and looks like it could use a total restoration, but I've eaten all over the world from five start restaurants with beautiful decor and  table settings along with a gigantic bill to little hole in wall places wondering if they have a health inspector  in their country. I like this place since I've been doing take-out from them."}
{"text":"Five stars for the roast duck.

The fried tofu is also real crunchy and comes with some delish sauce for extra flavor. 

The chow fun has the good \"wok hei\" (that nice char flavor) most of the time. 

Is been ages since I've been here with the fam,  but this is definitely back on the list."}
{"text":"One of the best places in the valley for Cantonese/Hong Kong styel bbq meats and rice plates.  The food is delicious and ridiculously cheap.  It is not consequence that you will see a lot of students from MCC and ASU eating here.  Follow their lead and order a rice plate or platter of bbq proteins.  Otherwise come here and order family style and you will be in heaven."}
{"text":"As much as I want to provide this place with some love....well I can't!

I think the food here is pretty authentic and good; if you're willing to wait for it.  My buddy and I ordered their pan fried noodles with beef, bbq pork, and peking duck.  Needless to say the bbq pork was pretty good.  Our noodles and duck, well we ate it at  home since it took so long for it to come out.  Needless to say, I was content with my noodles and the peking duck was what I expected it should be.  In the end, having to bring my food home after waiting really put a damper for my dining experience.  

I think if they would hire more help it would definitely alleviate some service woes.  The food is good and authentic.  The place needs a makeover for sure, but I guess you should expect that from a dive Chinese food joint! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent food here - nothing spectacular or remarkable enough that I would remember it. Not bad, just forgettable. 
I've eaten here a few times, the last time with my bf's whole family... 
One thing that does stick out to me is how the waitstaff has stink-face. This guy never smiled OR responded to anyone when he refilled our water glasses. 

If you're in the area, they do have some really cheap lunch deals - it just takes some navigating so you get something Chinese versus \"Chinese\", if you know what I mean. If you come with a big group, try one of the family meals (I think the family meal menu is all in Chinese, like at most restaurants) - you'll get a better bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Whats the owners name and I know Ms Li i don't her last name did sOmebody give me her name I'm not sure"}
{"text":"After inquiring about several dishes and not finding exactly what i was looking for, I ordered some really simple.  Jook (congee, rice porridge).  A staple.  Ridiculously simple to make with the ingredients of rice, water, and a bit of ginger.  It was incredible how terrible the bowl was.

The price was good.  The appearance was fine, but the taste set a new record and not a good one.  It was straight narsty.  There was no rice taste whatsoever.  The only thing I could think was that they use mostly rice flour instead of rice to make it.

Maybe I ordered the wrong things, but I don't think i'll be giving it another shot.  It is certainly not among the Best Hong Kong Dining in the valley."}
{"text":"Everything is really good here except for the eggrolls, which are only mildly disappointing.
The chicken in Black bean sauce from this place is bordering on sublime, and they do a really good job with fresh live seafood, vegetarian dishes and various types of Chinese barbecue like Char-Su and Spare-ribs.
I came here religiously but I got in a political disagreement about Tibet with a Nationalist Chinese mainlander waitress who is attending University at ASU -From then on the price of the Sauteed snowpea leaves (not on the menu -but for sale at the nearby Chinese market for about 1.99 a serving)  kept getting more and more expensive every time I came in, so when the verbal price reached fifteen dollars, and I had been accustomed to paying ten dollars other places, I got pissed off and stopped going.

Real Chinese food. Made and served by real Chinese Mainlanders and a Mexican guy in the back named Shiloh.

Some of the best food I have had anywhere. These guys don't fake it.

Free Tibet!"}
{"text":"Best Hong Kong Dining is the most authentic Chinese food I've found in the Phoenix area so far... in a restaurant anyway.  It's a chop shop... meaning you can eat at their restaurant or buy meat by the pound and they'll 'chop' it up for you.  You can often hear the sound of their cleaver working... chopchopchopchop. lol  It's reassuring to me.  It's sounding out authentic Chinese bbq pork, duck, etc.  

That being said, I haven't ordered out of the chop shop yet.  They have my favorite Chinese dish, cod (or random fish filet) in black bean sauce.  It is delicious here... fresh and sure to please any fish lovers pallet.  

I'll definitely be back and though it's not a fancy place for a 1st date, I'd take a group of friends here.

See ya there!"}
{"text":"Went to this place because we had heard they had some of the best roast pork/roast duck. Well people were right, the wife and I picked up a roast pork plate and roast duck plate. Both were delicious. They gave us a lot of rice (which was flavored we think).

The decor was lacking but hey the food is what makes the place right?

If you're looking for authentic roast pork or roast duck, this is the place to get it at."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I tried this place out for the first time. We went during lunch and no one was in there, but it didn't smell like sewage like hodori did next door so we decided to try it out. We both got lunch special items, the chicken and vegetables and the chicken curry. They both came with soup which she had the egg drop and I had the hot and spicy, both tasted funny and we could not finish them. Then the meals came out. The chicken was rubbery and way over cooked and looked like it was swimming in saliva. After only a couple bites we both decided it was not fresh and had hardly any flavor and could not eat any more. We left the full plates and paid for our meals, the server then proceeded to ask for a tip after noticing I did not fill in the gratuity due to the horrible food and service they presented. I then felt bad and filled in a 10% tip. My lowest tip amount, and I even work in the food industry and understand that a 10% tip is awful. On my drive home I had to pull over and vomit what I did eat. I hope they can get their quality of food up to par soon before they have to close down. I do not recommend anyone eat there ever."}
{"text":"I love this place! We come here all the time for dinner. This place usually is not that busy so the service here is pretty fast. Can be in and out within 30 minutes. The food is fresh and always delicious. I always order the crab puff which the sweet and sour sauce is amazing! Then I get the beef chow fun dried style and it's great. Tastes like my moms homemade chow fun. Although, the service isn't all that great, it makes up for the food. Definitely will always come again and again. Also everything is fairly decent priced. I didn't see anything over 20 dollars and they service roast duck, bbq pork, and fried pork which at some places can be expensive. Great place!"}
{"text":"They have authentic Chinese food including cantonese food. I especially love cantonese food because cantonese food are not made with too much strong spices or msg. I have been to this place 4-5 times and I was satisfied with their food all the time. The reasons I gave 4stars are they don't have enough servers, so I had too wait quite long time to place the order, and second reason is their interior looks old and not clean. But I highly recommend their food!!"}
{"text":"This is my family's go to Chinese place in Arizona. It's been a while and I was pleased to find the food as good as I remember it (Mongolian beef and garlic eggplant are my favorites). Prices are good and food comes quickly! They have some larger tables with lazy susans in the back for family style, and a semi-private room for small events. Service and interior decoration are wanting; maybe don't take a first date."}
{"text":"An amazing place that has the perfect feel of homemade food and the richness of dining out.  And it's certainly authentic.  Where else in Phoenix can I find old grandmas wobbling around heading to the kitchen and wobbling back?  Went back twice already, the first time I ordered the Beijing Style Porkchops, and finally a place that gets it right.  Drenched in sauce, tender to the bite, and a huge bowl of rice to go with it.  The gai lan on the side was just another strong staple added to the side.  The second time was to grab some BBQ Pork and Duck.  Both came out extremely tasty, and I have zero complaints.  I will certainly drive another 40 minutes to come back and eat their food."}
{"text":"Hands-down the best duck we've ever had.   Fish dishes are fantastic and their egg foo young is incredible.  We go here at least 3 times per month, either sit-down or take-out.   Prices can't be beat."}
{"text":"Best roast duck in the valley. Come to this place for real authentic Chinese food. The service is alright, and I really would give it 4  stars for decor, but the food is just so good that I gave it 5 stars. I highly highly recommend the duck lo mein. It is simply to die for!"}
{"text":"Beat roasted pork in the valley. Don't miss it! I have been their customer for 10 years!"}
{"text":"This is probably my new favorite Chinese restaurant in Phoenix.  Some good, authentic food at fair prices.  I followed some Yelp recommendations on my first try and they were right on.  I wanted to try both the BBQ roast pork and duck, so I got a combo plate over fried rice.   They were both excellent, and large portions but I really liked the BBQ pork.  Mongolian beef was another fan favorite that I have to agree with.  I did not care for the Spicy Garlic Sauce Chow Mein with Shrimp, Chicken and Beef, largely because I am not a fan of green peppers, and there were quite a few.  My only complaint is that all of the food was a bit greasy, so when I come back, I will try some other dishes."}
{"text":"The best roast pork in the Phoenix area.  Succulent meat, shatter crisp skin and just the perfect amount of fat to make a bowl of rice a must.  The duck is moist and flavorful. My only complaint is that the skin was soft. 
The hot and sour soup was good although for my taste neither hot or sour enough.  But a little hot oil and black vinegar fixed that right up. 
Mongolian Beef is excellent.  My wife and mother swear by the cashew chicken."}
{"text":"It's been 6 years since my review of this restaurant! Man does time fly by. We used to eat here a lot and our name for it was Best F'n Hong Kong Dining and it still holds true. If you want a roast pork or duck either to dine in or to go this is your place. Although restaurants that sell Chinese style BBQ meat are common in CA, it's hard to find in AZ so I appreciate that Best Hong Kong offers it. While we were dining here we did see a fairly constant stream of customers coming in to get the roasted duck to go. 

We came here to dine in. Last time I was here they had family meals which included a ton of food and were a great deal for what you got. It seems like they did away with this but the prices here are still reasonable and they have a good variety of items to choose from. At our recent visit we had the roast pork with bitter melon, combination tofu hot pot, sauteed rock cod fillet, and sauteed Chinese greens. All our dishes came out in a speedy amount of time and tasted great. You know a place is a legit Chinese restaurant if they have bitter melon on the menu and their dish didn't disappoint. I'll admit I can't eat a lot of bitter melon and will usually only eat a few pieces but the rest of my family enjoys it and I liked the BBQ roast pork included in the dish. The combination tofu hot pot is one of my favorite dishes here, filled with a generous amount of fried tofu, thinly sliced scallops, large shrimp, calamari, chicken, shitake mushrooms and vegetables. Quite a lot in just one hot pot! The Chinese greens we had were baby bok choy I think and were well seasoned. The rock cod came with a generous portion of tender fish with vegetables. 

Service here was very friendly and sweet by a young lady and gentleman who spoke both Mandarin and English.

The decor is a bit dated and slightly grungy (It hasn't changed since my last review lol) but hey, the food's good so I'm not complaining!"}
{"text":"Crunchy pork belly and roast duck is my favorite here. Probably eat here once a month."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places for roast duck and roast pork their regular Asian food like kung pao chicken is very good as well."}
{"text":"I was about to eat at this restaurant as usual. But one of the servers shout at us and asks to leave. Due to we didn't pay tips last time. This is so fking ridiculous. ??????????AZ?????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"This is MY GO-TO place for eating Chinese food in Arizona! As a Chinese-American and a modern foodie, I can appreciate the simplicity and authenticity of this Chinese restaurant and all that it has to offer! Let's first by saying, yes it's not the nicest looking place. It's not sleek or reputable by design, but it works, the food is great, and the service is pretty good too! 

I go here with both my families, my side of the family and my wife's mom and dad, and even though we order totally different stuff on the menu, it always ends up being great!

When I eat with my family, we order whatever we want. Usually it'll involve a couple of meat dishes that you know are fresh from the guy cutting them, a noodle dish, clay pots or hot pots with yummy sauce to mix with your rice, and maybe a seafood dish! 

When I eat with my wife's mom and dad, they order from the fixed \"family menu\" which is usually cheaper but includes four dishes: a soup, a meat, a seafood, and maybe another meat dish? I forgot! But again, it still turns out to be great! 

Hands down the best restaurant to eat authentic Chinese dishes while having some pretty good service! I have been going here on Sundays for years now with my two families and will continue to go until it stops being great! 

Here are some helpful tips that I can offer:
1) Best dishes to order 
-Half of Whole Duck (ask for more duck sauce, it's good to put on the rice)
-bbq pork (char siew) or crispy skin pork (it's the 3 layer fat pork, I forgot what it's called)
-beef chow fun  (if they ask wet or dry, ask for it dry)
-Seafood combination crispy chow mein (egg noodles if they ask?)
-salted fish and chicken hot pot, or Taro and pork belly hot pot ( my fave)
-soy chicken with the ginger on top (half of whole)
-salt and pepper fried squid 

2) Ask for rice bowls, usually your table has plates and silverware but I like putting my rice in a bowl so that I can mix it thoroughly with sauces that I have available and grabbing pieces of meat from dishes  

3) Ask for the hot chili sauce (lat chiu yao), it goes well with everything

4) Dont be afraid to ask for refills on rice!!! It's cheap, they don't care!

5) Order a drink cause the water doesn't taste so good (we always get hot tea anyways, more authentic that way)

6) in the winter time, ask for the hot dessert soup, it's sooo good!

I hope I influenced you to try this place! It has a special place in my heart and my stomach"}
{"text":"Legit Hong Kong chinese food, we've lived down the street and never thought to venture here.  One day we decided to come because my grandpa was visiting and we wanted to take him to a Chinese place.  As good as it gets for HK Chinese food.  

To try:
beef chow fun with egg sauce (bland for most but I prefer less salty things)
roast duck lo mein ( a little on the salt side but good!)
Roast Duck & Roast pork is YUM."}
{"text":"Whenever I crave Chinese food, which is often because I AM Chinese, I hop in my car and drive 27.1 miles down to this place for several reasons.

1) It's authentic.
2) It tastes reliably great every time I go.
3) There isn't another Chinese place on the north side of town that serves anything comparably good.

I know the young college kid/busboy/waiter that Madi D. mentioned and yeah, there are times when he's a little space brained but it's not intentional and for the most part, he's pretty attentive to customers.  So yeah, the service may not be a 5 but once you get to know the people working there, they take care of you.  While I agree that it shouldn't matter because a patron is a patron but still - this is just how it is... 

My favorite dishes from this place include:

* Eggplant and garlic sauce
* Beef stew
* Porridge
* Salty fish & chicken fried rice
* Four season beans
* Beef noodles
* Bitter melon

It's all very tasty and believe me, I wouldn't drive over 50 miles round trip several times a week just so I could yelp about it later.  I've brought many friends and family here and will continue to do so in the future because it's just that damn good.

If you see me there, feel free to introduce yourself, you can tell if I'm there because my oil dripping car will be in the parking lot (read my review for Right Toyota!).

Cheers!

{"text":"The flavors were super flavorful, and when I ate my leftovers, the MSG was even more overpowering and saltier than when I ate it fresh at the restaurant.

Everything also shined of oil. Had duck and BBQ slices, which tasted good. You have to ask for the duck sauce. The oysters in their oyster mix dish had soooo much sand in them. Their fish and bok choy was okay...The hong kong style beef slices was good, just MSG-y. 

Bring your own water or buy something to drink... their water tastes gross...

Also, the soap in the bathroom was 10x watered down."}
{"text":"Bye far one of the worst experiences I've had by far  with customer service. I placed and order to go. Mongolian beef with broccoli and black pepper chicken with mushrooms with side orders of the crab puffs and egg rolls with a side of teriyaki sauce. Took about 15min.

I saw the women who took my order only put two sause in my bag. Kinda stingy when you ordered 2 plates and 2 Appetizers. No boggy though. I asked her if I could get two more sauces. She worldly replied that you put plenty of sauce in the bag and that I didn't need anymore. I asked agen if I could please get two more sauces. She asked \"why you need more\" 

Are you kidding me i have to explain to why I want more sause(thinking in my head). I replied that I would pay extra and that two really not enough with the amount of food that I ordered. Lodi's costs under her breath and walks away Emerald turned with a whole entire 16 oz cup filled with sauce. Ahahhaha my family and I will never be returning here. 

Know for the food
Crab puff were a little skimpy but had really good flavors. The first order was wrong I asked for the Mongolian beef with BROCCOLI ONLY. when i got home it was all mixed with other veggies. Not what my bf ordered/ or wanted but said it was still really good. I got the black pepper chicken with mushrooms. The whole played was grounding in green onions. Seriously there was more green onions and there was chicken. The chickan had a really weird texture to it almost chewy not the normal sentencing of real chicken I wasn't really able to eat it gross me out. 

I have ordered other things here in the past that were really good like the orange chicken. Their soups in sizzling plate dishes. But with how you allow you employs to treat your smores is ridiculous. I will never come back here again.
STAY CLEAR!!"}
{"text":"This review is for their BBQ To-Go deli. I've ordered the bbq pork char siu and also the roast duck. The original owners were helping chop up my meat into slices and it reminded me of Cantonese places in SF Chinatown.  

The meat flavors are always on point and more fresh than other places I've  ordered from. Order the BBQ meats and you won't be dissapointed. When I don't  feel like cooking this place is good to spot to get to go.  Don't  forget to ask for sauces with your order.  Best of all they a credit card friendly."}
{"text":"Have been going here for years and it is consistently great. Reasonable lunch prices with many excellent options."}
{"text":"This restaurant used to be a nice place to go for good BBQ food, didn't visit for a while until last weekend we take out a whole roast duck share with family visiting from CA... all of us who ate the duck start vomiting and diarrhea.  Reported to health department this morning hope they will go check them out about the issue.  We might not going back again after this incident.  Very bad and painful experience."}
{"text":"Have been thinking about coming here for the lunch specials for a while but I never get done with class in time to make it. So today my last final of spring semester got done and I had a half hour to get over there so I rushed on over and decided to try the sweet and sour chicken lunch special. I am pretty happy with what I got. For $6.10 after tax, I got a bowl of egg flower soup which was pretty good. Not long of a wait at all and the rest of my meal came. The fried rice had no veggies in it, just egg, but was decent, and the sweet and sour chicken apart from being slightly tough was good. The spring roll was average, and the crab puff was out of this world amazing. Another thing I should mention is this is either take out or eat in, but if you eat in they seat you, give you water, and take your order like a normal restaurant. They are very nice, and it is very possible that I might be back over the summer semester."}
{"text":"Been going here for about 20+ years now, still has the Best Roast duck in the state.  Always come here for a whole roast duck and roast pork and bbq pork.  As good as it gets in arizona.  :)"}
{"text":"After a \"comedy of errors\" last night for dinner, my wife and I arrived at this restaurant.  We started the evening wanting Middle Eastern food, but apparently after 8:00 PM on a Friday night good luck finding one that is open.  Virtually all we went to were closed.  Strange as Friday is supposedly a \"party night\".  We ended up going to total of 5 Middle Eastern restaurants finding all of them closed.  

Acknowledging this fact, we decided to go for Korean, but in the parking lot, we saw the Best Hong Kong Dining was open and changed our mind for Chinese.  Now, we knew about this place.  We had driven by it many times as the Korean restaurant and market share the same plaza as this Chinese restaurant.  

We went for dinner at Best Hong Kong Dining when we found that to our delight they are still open at 8:30 PM!  

I ordered a seafood and bbq hot pot.  My wife ordered a seafood chow fun.  I kind of knew what chow fun was, having eaten Chinese food often enough while an undergrad in the early 1990s.  

As far as the hot pot, I ordered it expecting something more like a \"lau\" or soup.  What I received was more of a \"stew\" cooked in a clay pot.  It was surprising, but it was tasty.  

My wife enjoyed her chow fun.  When I tasted some, I found it to be tasty.  I remember eating chow fun back in the early 1990s and it tasting so bland!!!

Anyway, we both were content with what we ordered.  We plan to stop by again for lunch or dinner soon.  We wish the restaurant well.  We want to see more business though.  It was still a bit quiet when we were there."}
{"text":"Despite being seated in the back far from everyone else with my Asian boyfriend, I find myself coming back here again and again.  The service is not very good, especially what I perceive to be racism against white people.  However, the food is as authentic as it gets for Chinese cuisine in the Phoenix metro area.  Having recently returned from a stint in China, I can say this with a basis for comparison.  One distinct advantage to the already huge menu is that the cooks will even prepare food choices that are not listed on the menu.  Service is slow, food is good; don't expect any fortune cookies.  Ah!  One last thing: If you like \"hot pots,\" be warned: The hot pot dish on the menu is already prepared and simply served to you in a literal hot pot."}
{"text":"It's not the best Cantonese food I've ever had, but this could rival the average restaurants in bigger city Chinatowns such as New York or San Francisco. We were expecting poor service judging from the other reviews here, but the lady was actually very nice to us and never rushed us during the meal. She even offered to fill up our rice in our doggy bag for no extra charge! Can't say the same about most other Chinese restaurants! Decor was no frills, but this would be a good place to bring the family for a home-style Chinese meal. Now onto the food... 

We ordered the honey walnut shrimp, braised pork belly with vegetables, and seafood pan fried noodle. Very good food all around - the sauce with the shrimp was done just right and in the right amount. The braised pork was tender and the rice was a great vehicle to soak up the sauce. The pan fried noodle was done just right - crispy on the outer edges and soft where it soaked up the sauce. In the end, I'd say I'm a fan and would come here again for solid comfort Chinese food."}
{"text":"Been here few times. One of few places where you can buy Chinese BBQ in the area I know of. Today I opted to take out steam whole chicken for dinner. It comes with ginger sauce which makes the dish that much better. The chicken was moist and had enough salt content but wish it had little more seasoning. I wish I opted to get their soy sauce chicken which I remember being really good before. I've also tried few of their other dishes including chow fun, pea leaves, and fish stir fry and they were all good. Their BBQ duck is really yummy as well."}
{"text":"Probably my mother's favorite place for siu laap!  Since she lives in Glendale, I'm often asked to be the delivery gal to bring her roasted duck, boiled chicken with the head still on, and roasted pork whenever she needs to do some Chinese ceremonial tradition.  If it's not me she's forcing to do the grunt work, it's one of her co-workers.  Regardless, even if it's on the east side, it will always show up to Mommy W. fresh!

I first came across this place when my friend invited us out for dinner.  It seemed to have all your Americanized and authentic foods.  Service can be a bit of a wait but it's definitely worth your time.  Kudos to the chef for making such amazing flavorful food.  Prices are reasonable and the place is clean.  I haven't tried any of their lunch specials but my friend says they're pretty decent.  They make a delicious Mussels with Black Bean Sauce and their Salt & Pepper Shrimp is pretty amazing as well.  And there's nothing like some rice soup [aka porridge] when you want something warm.  It's the Asian chicken noodle soup [comfort food].  I stick with either the pork with the century egg or the fish fillet porridge.  Momma W. makes it best but Best Hong Kong Dining is a close second.  

The only reason why I don't frequent here as often as I should is because parking is always a pain.  There are some other eateries and a grocery store in this strip plaza so parking can be pretty sketchy.  You know us Asian drivers.  Look out!  :P"}
{"text":"Made me sick to my stomach! Don't eat here if you value your intestines. 
Mediocre food. The potstickers dough was chewy, the chicken in the King Pao spongy, and the squid in the seafood chow mein not cooked well."}
{"text":"All of the food I have had here is great, I especially like the Stuffed Tofu and the Black mushrooms and chinese greens (if you can't tell I am a vegetarian) They have a lot of vegetarian meals, and although I hate doing it on principle they are always really nice about making stuff without meat for me (like stuffed tofu). 

The decor is old and they don't have booths which is always a downer, but the place is always clean. the service is average Asian food service, they get your order, refill your water, and bring you your food, no real interaction. Whenever I have asked about ingrediants they have always been knowledgable, and helpful in picking out non meat meals when I asked, so I would have to say their service isn't bad, just not uhh outgoing.


They are quick with take out, and always correct with the orders and additional stuff like utensils and napkins (which is not a big deal until the one time you don't get them)."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy here, just solid good food at cheap prices. The rice plates are less than $6.00 and the BBQ Pork, Roasted Pork and Duck are always a sure thing. The quantity is shareable between 2 people or one hungry person. Service is pretty good and if you want to just take out there is always the roasted duck or the roasted or bbq pork that is fresh and hanging in the glass enclosures like you would fine in most Chinatowns. Need a quality cheap Chinese place in North Scottsdale that is like this."}
{"text":"Good for cantonese style bbq with whole ducks hanging and bbq pork on display. BUT today when we visited, we watched the owner come in through the front door, put on his apron and immediately grabbed a duck and started chopping away for my duck lo mein. Didnt wash his hands first! Who knows where he just came from."}
