{"text":"I was stuck in downtown Charlotte on a Sunday afternoon, and virtually every business was closed. Hotel restaurants can be disappointing, and this place was absolutely empty at lunch time, but I was hungry and there were not many other decent looking choices. I turned out to be pleasantly surprised. I had pulled pork tacos, and the pork realy was delicious. Maybe a bit heavy on the cumin, and pork tacos really should be served on corn tortillas, not flour. The coleslaw was a nice touch. Pico de gallo and guacamole were better than I expected. My waiter was very attentive. The bar looks pretty nice but I didn't stay for drinks. Definitely exceeded my expectations."}
{"text":"Had a really great experience here. Our food order took a long time coming out, but before we could complain, they approached us and let us eat from their brunch buffet for free. It was a very nice buffet, too: all manner of fancy foods, custom-made pasta and waffles, hot breakfast foods, seafood, meats, salad, and even desserts! The waiter kept bringing us new things to try, and he never let our glasses get empty. I would definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"NC was too hot, humid and hood for my liking so I hid at this bar most of the time. They have decent priced drinks and pretty good food.

- Mediterranean appetizer. Fresh, warm, thick pita chips w/baba ganoush, hummus, tzatziki sauce, cheese and a cucumber salad. This was a damn big portion and all the dips were good. Definitely get this if you need a drinking snack.
- Cheese plate. Pitiful. Came with a strawberry/fig jelly, another orange flavored one, strawberries, blueberries, sesame crackers and some grocery store bought cheese. Cheddar, swiss, wedge of brie. Nothing fancy. If you're a cheese lover, definitely pass. 
- Veggie burger. Weird and flavorless. The pita it came on was good but the burger itself tasted like plastic. Made with lentils, brown rice and I have no idea what else. I did not like this at all. 
- Chicken quesadilla. Huge with lots of chicken. Tons of cheese, nice slightly crisp tortilla, moist chicken and lots of yummy guac, sour cream & pico de gallo to dip it in.
- Calamari. This was... weird. The batter got a little soggy with all the sauces they put on it. There was a sweet/spicy sauce (Think sweet Thai chili), along with a cumin/curry based sauce. I think I would've preferred just salt and pepper. 
- Banana ravioli w/ice cream and a caramel sauce. Mmm crispy fried banana raviolis with creamy cold vanilla ice cream and warm caramel sauce. You can't go wrong with that combination.
- Chocolate torte. Flavor was good but the cake was dry. 

Side note: The waitresses are very nice!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast here before my trip to the airport. Good food and better service. Well worth the $12."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch one weekday and we actually got here a little bit before noon, which is a good thing before the lunch crowd came.

Our server was a little off - gave us breakfast menus instead of lunch, but still very friendly.  She suggested us to have the fried cauliflower as it was a special.   It was really good, so they should keep it on the menu!  For my meal, I wanted the brisket flatbread.  Our server told me they were out.  As there is pimento cheese on there, I decided instead, well let me have just the pimento cheese if that is available.  She decided to check in with the kitchen.  She came back and said good news, they had enough for one of the flat bread.  I of course ordered that, but I'm not sure how you do or don't have enough for a menu item at the beginning of the day???

The flatbread, while it is messy with the toppings, had great flavor!  I really enjoyed it!  I would get that again.  It was plenty for me and had some leftover for two more meals.

I think if this restaurant, being uptown and having a nicer feel to it, got their act together on service and availability, I would bump them up one more star.  Overall, a good choice for a quick good lunch, but hopefully they have what you want!"}
{"text":"Yep, an okay lunch buffet with different offerings depending on the day of the week.  I've been on what I guess is Asian day (pretty good, especially the ginger shiitake soup), taco day (kind of lousy ground beef hard shell blah), and on some kind of pasta day (decent).  It averages out to okay.  The desserts are usually pretty decent, a small cake or cobbler serving in a glass with ice cream and whip."}
{"text":"Food was amazing but unfortunately I can not say the same about the sercice. We had to search for someone to seat us and then couldn't find anyone to get our bill. I went up to the bar and the bartender was delivering food to the tables. We finally found our waitress after about  10 minutes and we're able to pay our bill. The food was 5 stars but sadly the service was a 1."}
{"text":"This place completely ruined my entire visit to Charlotte. I entered the restaurant last Sunday night and saw 2 employees inside. Since no one bothered to greet me although I was just standing there, I asked the bartender where should I sit. He advised I can sit anywhere I would like. I took a seat right in front of the bar and waited. And waited. And waited. No one ever came to even bring a menu. When I asked the bartender did I need to sit at the bar to get service, the waitress whose name was Nikki advised she didn't know where I sat and she would be right with me. 10 mins later she came back with menus and asked if we would like a drink. My little sister ordered apple juice and I advised I would need a moment to review the menu. Once again, we waited. And waited. She hadn't even come back with the apple juice! Finally we got up to leave just in time to see Nikki attempting to pass the apple juice to another waiter on duty saying she \"did not wanna go over there\". As she saw me approach she shoved the glass in the guy's hand and said \"There she goes\". Excuse me? I advised the waiter he can keep it because I was leaving due to the terrible service. As I make this statement, Nikki says loudly YEA IT SURE IS. The waiter attempted to provide some form of service by asking \"Are you sure you wouldn't like it? Sorry about that.\" He should not have to apologize for this grown woman's trashy behavior. The ambiance of the restaurant doesn't match the level of service that's for sure."}
{"text":"The new lunch buffet is several dollars more expensive (currently $10.50) than it was last year, but there are a few salad additions that are an upgrade.  The salad bar consists of spinach and mixed greens, three cheeses (including a great blue cheese), grilled chicken, chickpeas, beans, carrots, tomatoes, cucumber, three types of dressing and various nuts, crunchies, croutons and dried fruit.

Each day the buffet theme changes, but the entree and side items are all fairly average.  They serve two types of soup, bread rolls and butter, and at least 3 desserts plus cookies.  If you're into variety, this is a good lunch option."}
{"text":"Meh. I ate this room service so I'll cut them some slack. But I had the BLT + pimento cheese, which was not great. Too much cheese and suffering from a bacon deficit. Fries cold and soggy. No bottle of wine for under $35, so I passed. I will say that the dessert menu looked amazing..."}
{"text":"I got the Peach Panini. It was great! Loved the sweet potato fries as well. Had a great meal that evening. The only complaint I had was the price was a little steep."}
{"text":"That's it, I can't handle it anymore, I'm updating my review because I can no longer recommend this restaurant - it is SO cold in this restaurant every time I visit I can't take it anymore. I am wearing long johns (seriously), a battery heated vest and a winter jacket over that. And I'm still shaking. Management says it's the building and nothing can be done. Something can ALWAYS be done if the right person is in charge. Rant over.

I've eaten here many times and always order the buffet. Because of that, I think its best trait is the variety and quality of food, with a different theme each day. It's also cost effective and the staff is friendly. 

Cons/suggestions for improvement - would like each day to have a new unusual salad dressing to try outside of the normal boring three provided. Sometimes this happens, but not often. Next, there are two bowls of lettuce... can we have two different types of lettuce rather than the same one in each? Lastly - the soups... I appreciate that one is usually unique and changes day to day, but why does the second soup have to be boring chicken noodle everyday?

Only other comment - this restaurant resides in Antarctica, especially in the summer. Bring a sweater, or better yet, a winter jacket!"}
{"text":"Smoked Ribs, gourmet chicken tenders, sauteed green beans!!! The chef needs a raise!!! All Excellent!!! When chicken noodle soup can taste this good you are definitely suppose to serve it every day!!! I'm glad you do!!!"}
{"text":"Nice and quiet spot to slide in for a very good meal. Two forks up!"}
{"text":"Great spot for lunch for NASCAR museum nearby. We loved the vegetarian eggplant dish. The burger was alright. We will likely stay at this Hilton location next time around. Seems accessible to various interesting spots in charlotte."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I come to Coastal Kitchen for their lunch buffet 1-2 times each month. I must say, their salad bar is pretty great - always spring greens mix on the bar (I dislike iceberg lettuce for salads), and the veggies are always fresh and the grilled chicken always tasty. The last time we ate here we waited an inordinate amount of time for our drinks, which was quickly recitified by the bar staff when we asked about them. LOVED the recent \"healthy/fit\" buffet which was lots of veggies (ratatouille - yum!) and fresh selections, which is great as a couple of us are on diets and fruits and veggies are best. And this does not go along with my diet AT ALL, but as a chocolate chip cookie fan, theirs are phenomenal. At some point I may have the willpower NOT to get one when I visit, but I doubt it.... Getting the weekly newsletter is great for planning lunches; we know in advance what the offerings are and can plan accordingly. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great food at a food price for lunch when in uptown Charlotte. The staff is awesome. Everyone is friendly. At time you may have to wait for the food on the buffet to be replenished, but that's rare. I've only been for lunch as a work close by. Stop in and see for yourself."}
{"text":"I have been here for lunch, breakfast and drinks only and I do have to say it is A-OK.  Breakfast was a huge buffet with very fresh fruit and lots of options.  Lunch is usually always good, it is pretty inexpensive for all you can eat buffet.  You can get on the mailing list to know when it is MAC AND CHEESE day which is FANTASTIC.  But I have been some days for lunch where it has been 'eh'.  Overall it is A-OK!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is not bad for a hotel restaurant!  I travel to CLT for business and am staying at the Hilton.  I have been ill and did not feel like going out so I had my friend meet me here for dinner.  I was in no joke Nike shorts and she came from getting a spray tan so you can be casual which is nice.  I like the ambiance and we did sit at a table since we weren't dressed for the bar.
  I stuck with water since I am sick and my friend had a Titos and cran so I can't comment on any speciality drinks.  We split the tuna appetizer.  I thought the rice and the wontons were a bit too much -- it would have been fine with one or the other but otherwise the tuna and seaweed were delicious.  I would recommend starting with this.  
  For entrees, my friend is doing Whole 30 so she had a salad which she liked.  I had the salmon entree.  I loved all of the veggies but the potatoes which were a bit over salted.  The sauce on the dish was good but I would get it on the side next time.  Coastal is a nice option to have at the Hilton!  I would recommend it if you don't feel like leaving the hotel it is worth it and not gross like some hotel restaurants are."}
{"text":"Well here I go! Coastal kitchen is one of the Hidden Gems of downtown charlotte.  Don't get me wrong I've been there on some so so days! However the quality of the food is a constant and the freshness is on point! This great Friday the fish was poppin, the maple chicken was exotic, and the Seafood chowder was well out of this world. If you ever want to eat in a serene/comfortable setting where they get it right 9times out of 10, your answer is Coastal Kitchen"}
{"text":"Pretty ordinary: We had lunch there and it was a perfectly ordinary lunch -- a mushroom flatbread and a caesar salad -- both were OK, neither was especially good."}
{"text":"Nice ambience. Good place for meet up or casual meetings. Located at the Hilton lobby (spacious). 

Wine quality is subpar. Pizza was burnt. Quality is decent but not polished."}
{"text":"All right, the pic, I know, I was super hungry. I'd had a long day climbing trees, lookin for food, I was starved. But the club sandwich was AWESOME. It only used two slices of bread so, maybe it's not a traditional club. The bread was toasted and buttered though, think grilled cheese bread, w/ club sandwich filling. It was legit unreal, best club I've had in 8.6 years, which is huge on the Richter scale. W/ the club you get a side,
Sweet potatoes fried,
Just like the dude, 
You should abide.
This jaunt is a good spot. Crowd can be a little rowdy, they have regulars, they have travelers, gypsies and marsupials. Any hotel bar that pays enough attention to its local scene to have rotating drafts, is good enough to check out. This place is good enough to do a double take."}
{"text":"The Shrimp Lump Crap with double cream and sherry is awesome!  I could not believe the huge amount of fresh lump crap on top.  I live near the coast and was hesitant about the crap being Krab or fishy tasting crab.  It wasn't that at all. It was \"spot on\""}
{"text":"Went for restaurants week and it was great they didn't simplify or take anything off the normal items that are on their menu- they limited the items but they were all served as they would be normally. Tuna app was amazing!"}
{"text":"Went here for Sunday Breakfast. It was good. I thought it was good on the part of this establishment to have a full breakfast buffet for an average of $3 more than most breakfast dishes.......so that is what i went with, as did my husband and sister. Had plenty of your usual options, scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon, fresh fruit, yogurt, cereals, granola, bisquit and gravy, grits, toast varities and fresh made to order egg  & omlette cook. I left full and satisfied. Coffee was strong!"}
{"text":"Really hit or miss on the lunch buffet...check in advance what is offered."}
{"text":"The southern caprese salad is fabulous. Would love to have it every day.  The fried green tomato was over salted but otherwise great. Tried the short rib arepa and the arepa was so salty I couldn't eat then. The short rib on top was so so...maybe even under salted ... Skipping the arepa next time."}
{"text":"Had such a fun night at the Hilton Bar the other night.  Our Bartender Juan was awesome.  We will definetley be back!!"}
{"text":"While a buffet is totally not my style - I have to hand it to Coastal, they do a good job.  I get take out lunch from here about once a week and I have to say that the quality is good.  The food is always fresh, it is clear that they use nice ingredients.  They also do a very good job of refreshing dishes, even if it's not totally empty on the buffet, so what you eat is usually pretty fresh.   The soups are always outstanding.  They always have chicken noodle and a soup of the day.   The chicken noodle is so good, the broth tastes homemade.  I've never had a bad soup of the day either.  

The ambiance isn't great in the middle of the hotel lobby (is it even a lobby?), but if you are getting it to go, that doesn't matter.   All in all, this is a solid place to run and grab a week day lunch with consistent quality."}
{"text":"In my opinion it's the best place to eat lunch uptown.  Great variety on their buffet, with a different style of food (Indian, Asian, American, Hispanic, Continental etc) every day.  All you can eat plus a beverage for $12.  Highly recommended"}
{"text":"I have been here for breakfast, lunch and i guess, dinner. I must say that it is cheaper here for sure compared to other hotels that serves breakfast. They have a wide variety of food and fresh fruits and the service is great. They also serve now a small plate menu like tuna crisp which is really really good. I can't wait to come back here and try everything new in the menu! As what I heard they've had some changes and put on more additional and international food that's going to cater everyone's taste especially mine!!! I am definitely going back and bring my friends to try this place!!"}
{"text":"Very nice bar within the Hilton Center City Charlotte hotel. Decent menu selection, which breaks up different courses (appetizers, entrees, desserts) into three categories - World, Southern and Local (if I recall correctly this was the breakdown). Try the Tuna Crisp for a light snack or divine appetizer. If you're really hungry, the Fish and Chips will easily satiate (one enormous piece of fried catfish). Plenty of TV's around for the sports afficionados and the service is friendly (albeit not always prompt)."}
