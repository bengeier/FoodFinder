{"text":"We have lived in the area for a couple of years and until recently had never been to Koji. In the past 2 weeks we've now gone twice! We don't go out for food often so it says a LOT that we've been there so often in minimal time. My boyfriend and I love it there. It's the only place in Toronto where the sushi is actually interesting and has many different taste experiences. 

The chef is so creative and we were thoroughly wowed by our dishes that we ordered 

The service is very friendly and warm. We went back the second time with my boyfriends sisters who also absolutely loved it! We will be back!"}
{"text":"It took me awhile to check out Koji even though I live nearby but boy, am I glad I finally tried it out!
I usually get chirashi or sashimi and this was the best sashimi I have ever had! 

The sashimi is fresh, good amount and the best part is that some of them are lightly seared so it tastes extra good. 

The salad also comes with delicious dressing and a sashimi order comes with a side of rice which is rare in the other sushi restaurants I go to usually. 

The staff are very friendly and quick. 

Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our dinner at Koji. Got the White Dragon, Kamikaze and Ninja rolls, all were delicious. Also had the salmon pizza which was one of the best we've had! Will definitely be going back often"}
{"text":"Seaweed salad was excellent (and comes topped with cucumber and avocado). Rolls were a decent size and very good tasting. Not a ton of selection: most of the rolls are a dynamite with different stuff on top. Tuna hand roll was spicy and delicious - tuna all the way down to the tip! The veggie dragon roll was unique and we would totally get it regularly, especially if they put real chunks of sweet potato in it instead of what was basically sweet potato fries. A little expensive and not the best pop music soundtrack. Great location."}
{"text":"Epic little find, tucked away in a tiny strip mall in an unassuming block on Dupont. Decor is simple and neat. Attention is very, very caring. The food is tasty & elegantly presented. Prices a fair. I feel like the days of true budget sushi are over, so now that I'm habituating to $20 sashimi combos, I've become more focused on value. 

This place, my friends, is high value! High-quality fish in really creative propositions. We had their sashimi delux platter, which was fresh and delicate. The fatty tuna was torched and drizzled in shallot oil, to enhance the experience. See? Attention to detail is high value! We also had their sexy roll, which had a distinctly pleasant mouth-feel (ohhh now I get the name!). 

The chef was extremely friendly and warm -- She'll be seeing more of us!!"}
{"text":"I was happily surprised by the value and quality for the price of this local restaurant. Apart from the classic California rolls and such, you can have really well made traditional sushi with lots of choice of fish or seafood."}
{"text":"Super friendly service offsets the anger that the 'angry roll' brings to the table! Everything we've had is delicious! Try the Tako Yaki!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Ordered a bunch of sushi and it was so fresh and nicely done. The service is also perfect. They have excellent attention to detail. Priced great too !"}
{"text":"Given other reviews and some word of mouth, I thought this place would be an above average sushi place, but it really exceeded my expectations. Delicious, creative and beautiful dishes. Great service. Very reasonable prices. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"i've only been for lunch, but it is a really nice place for very good sushi.  udon was good too.  staff was friendly and served tea while i waited for takeout."}
{"text":"Super nice people, quality rolls.  They even came over to ask if my son wanted the wasabi in his to-go box.  (\"No.\")  Thanks Koji Sushi!"}
{"text":"This is by far my fav sushi spot in junction area! The service is great and the quality is great and they go that extra mile and put extra touches on their presentation and treat their regulars like family. Cant say ENOUGH good things about KOJI! Check it out! You will not be dissapointed"}
{"text":"Considering it's the only Japanese spot in the area, it's a great one. The veggie special is the best I've ever seen. Staff is warm and friendly and service is quick."}
{"text":"Freshest sushi in the market. And idk how the chef does it, their sushi is the right small perfect size for your mouth. Bite size. You don't have to slice it open to fit in your mouth unlike some other restaurants. Great service and friendly staff. But none of that beats the quality of their fish and food here."}
{"text":"Really great service. Servers were very kind and even the prep staff said goodbye and thank you when we left. Awesome lunch menu and a beautiful set up."}
{"text":"Hidden gem in the Junction triangle! So happy that this restaurant is only 5 mins away from my place."}
{"text":"Heard good things about this place so decided to check it out. Thought people were exaggerating but it's actually quite good! Fresh fish and great service."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Fri around 1:30pm.
Restaurant was about 40% full.  Service was friendly and attentive.  I got the beef teriyaki lunch special.  It came in a bento box with miso soup, salad, spring roll and a few pieces of fried fish for $10.  Was good tasting all the different items in the bento box.  The beef was more over cooked than I liked and wasn't  much beef either.  Overall portion size of the bento box was good.  They also offer barley tea for free.  Would be interested in coming back to try different dish."}
{"text":"had the ninja roll, rainbow roll, spicy salmon and oshinko rolls. 
all were pretty good tasting with very nice presentation!

selection for special rolls was mostly dynamite based so you'll have to stick to the basic rolls if you're trying to avoid deep fry."}
{"text":"Before I slap five stars on another \"amazing\" place with a \"cool\" vibe and \"retro\" light fixtures, I like to ask a few questions of myself that I wish others in the Yelp-I-Verse would ask. Not that these are all the right questions or that I am more knowledgeable, no. However, I do rely on Yelp and hate to show up at some highly rated place (like Nodo in the Junction) that is grossly overrated and disappointing.

Here goes...

1. Does the service leave me feeling like the people who work here really care about my experience, their jobs, and the success of the establishment?
2. Is the food really delicious? When I compare this to the other sushi (or whatever) I have had before, is this a home run? Do I want to come back as soon as possible and bring friends?
3. Is there value here? Do I get my money's worth? A great steak at 40$ is different that a great steak at 140$.
4. Is this review reflective of my experience and not simply me adding to an echo chamber of other \"amazing\" reviews?

At Koji, absolutely yes, yes, yes, yes... without any retro light fixtures or cool vibe."}
{"text":"Have really enjoyed the many rolls I've tried. I usually order take out though once I brought my mother and we ate in. Some of the best sushi I've had in TO. 
I was overjoyed to see them on UberEATS BUT I'd say they accept orders approx 20% of the time, in my experience. The one time (read: only) I was was able to get through they slipped in a free can of Coke with a note apologizing for the wait - which was very generous and unexpected. TBH I hadn't thought it was too long, but what the heck. LOL
My other tries to order through UE went by the wayside. oh well.  Wishing they could manage to get it together on the UE front. They'd have much more of my business."}
{"text":"The food and service at Koji are both excellent. We like ordering the platter for two, $38+tax. Comes with green salad, miso soup, tempura, and a platter with a green dragon roll, spicy salmon roll, salmon sushi and sushimi, tuna, and few other nice sushimi pieces. Everyone that works there is super nice and friendly and there is bottomless tea."}
{"text":"I've been to this place twice since it opened (I love sushi) - but just for take-out. The service was really friendly and they offered tea while I waited for my order. The Chicken Karaage was good, came topped with what I think was thinly sliced roasted ginger and scallions - it was a nice aromatic addition. The salmon is a really good quality too. So happy they moved in - can't wait to try other options!"}
{"text":"Went to Koji Sushi from reading all the reviews left by everyone. Decided to give it a go, the interior decor is very appealing for being in the symington/DuPont area.
The waitress and chef behind the sushi bar are very kind and friendly. The food we order are 2 donburi fish and the  dynamite combo. Simply delicious, will be coming back to this establishment."}
{"text":"Currently eating here. Ordered the Chicken Katsu Don Buri. Chicken is well cooked and moist yet still crunchy with the bread crumbs. Sauce tastes great with the rice too. 

Wife had the chicken teriyaki. Not dry at all. Wasn't bad but the Katsu Don is preferred over the teriyaki. 

Decent portions too. 

The place is clean, service is great. They are very friendly here. 

Highly recommend this place for folks looking for some decent quality Japanese. 

I believe the place is run my Korean folks so though no 100% authentic Japanese, it's as good as it gets. This place could use more business! 

Don't let the ghetto Portuguese vibes throw you off!"}
{"text":"This is a cute Japanese restaurant with creative sushi combos, vegetarian options and good service. I highly recommend the veggie sushi rolls with fried yam, avocado and inari. The tempura was good as was the tofu teriyaki. The portions are huge. Sushi platters seemed very popular here."}
{"text":"Koji is good! Finally a sushi place out west to cater to the Emerson junction triangle!  The fish was fresh and their portions are perfect. I had the lunch sashimi combo and shared the salmon sushi pizza. I will definitely go back as it is the nearest to me and it is also a nice little place to catch up with friends too.  

The staff was friendly and they were great with service. This place is relatively new so decor is still coming in.  All in all I liked the food and the price was also decent."}
{"text":"I love Koji Sushi (uploaded some pics). That being said, I ended up bringing a couple of friends here from out of town (they loved it too). They offer fresh, and delicious sushi... and they present it very nice too! Lovely staff and space."}
