{"text":"I love this weekend place! Great farmers market and delicious menu for dining!! Inside and out you'll enjoy this hidden treasure in Tempe! Relax outside by the fire pits, watch the kids play, eat yummy food grown with love at the Singh farm. You may have the pleasure of meeting the Owner Ken, he's a great soul! Come with family, friends or alone and enjoy the Signh experience! And...Free outdoor yoga some days!!"}
{"text":"Having been to the previous Sighn Farm I had an expectation of it being similar but on a larger scale, I was a little disappointed upon coming and not being able to walk through any kind of garden like areas, just a small one by the restaurant.  But what it did have was an expansive park like area that was beautiful, the small pond was very clean and the water was crystal clear. Seating was everywhere and they offered blankets to sit and enjoy the sun or shade. It also had volleyball, corn hole and bat mitten with all the equipment available for anyone to use. It really was a very picturesque and relaxing place to have a picnic or munchies from their bistro bar. I hope that the owner plans on expanding this to become more like the original as the secret garden atmosphere was something I truly enjoyed before."}
{"text":"I FINALLY made it out to Singh Meadows this past weekend and came home will all kinds of goodies!! I totally miss the cozy farm but I know this move was out of their control so i'm embracing change! The best part, dogs are allowed at this location as long as you go around back and sit on their patio! YEEE! Harvey is going to be the happiest camper. They're open Saturdays and Sundays only from 8 AM - 2 PM.   When you arrive, you walk up to their market of sorts that is rather small but packed full of local goodies like in-season produce, honey, dips, breads, baked goods, sauces, jams, cheese, spring rolls, etc. Once you purchase your food for the week, head out back where you can order from their quaint little cafe and snag a fresh juice! They also had baby goats in a little corral and they were SO cute! This is a great place to let the kiddos run around - it is like a wide open pasture. The fact that the market is indoors, makes it bearable in the summer! I will definitely be making a regular stop here to get fresh, local produce because it really doesn't get better than that!  This trip, we left with corn, tomatoes, peppers, Baba Ganoush, chive pretzels, spring rolls, a delicious watermelon juice, and a granola bar. I'm heading out of town this week so next time I will absolutely be snagging more produce! Thanks for being so awesome as always, Singh Meadows!!"}
{"text":"Hidden behind water park. Old goal course with farmers market-like place. Not a lot of shaded places to sit and eat. Food and drink available to buy. Got a kale pizza.....WAY too salty and oily. Quiche was amazingly silky and delish. Dogs allowed on leach outside. Blankets provided if you want to sit or lay on grass. *still comparison to Singh Farms."}
{"text":"Great place! Not too busy! I had the best spring roles I've ever had in my life here. Great location and great food. It is a fantastic way to spend the morning. Very family friendly and large grounds to go explore. A hidden gem in the middle of the city!"}
{"text":"Glad to see that they found a solution to keeping the store open and a venue where the community could come together and relax offering a peaceful environment, higher quality snacks and light meals in a park like setting.  Limited produce on 3/26 but I'd guess we are in a transition between winter and summer harvest, looking forward to the summer goods.  While worth a visit on a Saturday or Sunday as the property develops I am looking forward to Mr Singh turning this into a larger piece of paradise like he's done with the original location."}
{"text":"Very cute but small indoor farmers market. Produce pricey but appeared fresh and plump.  The desserts looked amazing especially the giant cookies and basket of almond croissants layered in powdered sugar.  Though menu was small, everything we ordered was great especially paired with the beautiful outdoor seating amongst the great spread of green grass and pretty pond.  Food + ambiance = 5 stars.  It's so neat that they offer blankets for picnicking in the grass and multiple bouncy exercise balls for kids and adults to goof around.  Now for our food - greatly exceeded expectations.  We shared the spinach pizza and I thought it was one of the best pizzas I've had.  It was crispy, creamy, and spinach was finely chopped to perfection.  The kale salad was very fresh with some craisins and some sort of soft beans and so perfectly dressed.  Im not a bbq fan so hard for me to love the trip tip sandwich but it was decent.  The blackberry bran muffin would have been perfect but there was too much sweet glaze.  It was soft and had fresh blackberries in the center. Will definitely return and need to visit the Singh Farms location."}
{"text":"If you are in search of fresh produce the Farmers Market on Brown is a much better bet.  SIngh opens at 9 and by 9:45 everything was VERY picked over in the produce department.  They was still had plenty of bread , baked goods, and honey if that's what you are looking for.  Stay away from the $9 juiced drinks.  They are mostly ice and ~2 ounces of juiced beverage.    As the other reviewed said its a work in progress and certainly a pretty place to go for a picnic as long as a farmers market isnt on your agenda."}
{"text":"A beautiful mind can transform anything into beauty and the owner of Singh Farms is one of those beautiful minds. It's a work in progress but if you've been to his beautiful Singh Farms, you know that the finished product will be just as wonderful because anyone who can transform a plot of dirt off Thomas and the 101 into a secret garden can do anything.   Singh Meadows is right behind Big Surf and right now, it's an adorable market filled with fresh produce and homemade honey, pastries, bread etc. It also has a cafe where you can order delicious food and juices. The meadow outside is a huge grass area overlooking a pond where kids can run while you snack on the treats. Right now it's a lovely place to visit on the weekend for breakfast and some locally made groceries and as time goes on, I can only imagine what this creative mind will create with this fresh canvas of green beauty."}
{"text":"Singh Meadows did not disappoint our Green Chamber luncheon attendees.  We all enjoyed grilled cheese sandwiches, pizzas,  salads, and strawberry shortcake that were made with their delicious produce.  I'm skipping dinner tonight because I ate beyond being full!"}
{"text":"What a great spot for food, coffee and a place to chill with friends and family.  Love all of the organically grown fruits and vegetables that they sell as well as the amazing baked goods. So cool that they have transformed this old golf shop and outdoor are into an oasis."}
{"text":"Amazingly beautiful! Great food, juices and views! So close to my house will definitely be back! They even let you take your pups!"}
{"text":"Great out door place for a Sunday afternoon when the weather is good. We have twin boys who are about 22 months. They had a great time running around. They have a nice lake to walk along.  They have few items for food. Nothing super fancy but it is all made with fresh ingredients. Coffee is excellent and they have fresh juices as well.  Would highly recommend for someone with kids."}
{"text":"I love this place, I love the food, I love the cold brew coffee, and I love how passionate the owner is about bringing joy, farm fresh food, and fun to his customers."}
{"text":"I was so disappointed when Singh Farms had to close to the public. It was a great place to spend a Saturday morning wandering among the trees, small gardens, fresh produce stands and food vendors. A great family place. A great small community destination in a large city.  But, low & behold, Mr. Singh has now opened a new destination - Singh Meadows. We spent a couple hours today wandering this beautiful setting. Rolling grassy meadows, a small pond with a walking path. Peace and quiet. Mr. Singh has outdone himself - once again. Singh Meadows is totally different than Singh Farms; but, just as twins are identical, and each one carries his own unique personality, Singh Farms & Singh Meadows - are twins, but totally unique.  This morning we bought a pot of French press coffee, some wonderful breads, and fresh apple cider. Sitting at one of the handmade picnic tables, we indulged, watched 3 baby goats (kids) being bottle-fed and enjoyed the spring sunshine on our backs. There was no place else I wanted to be.  Fresh produce from Singh Farms, fresh breads, honeys, and lots of local food products. Spread your picnic blanket out on the grass, let your wee ones run to their hearts content and feel the cares of everyday problems just melt away.   Minus one star because I know that every time I return (just like Singh Farms) it will only get better. An absolutely must. This farmer knows what he is doing."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem!! The food and view are amazing. It's a great to relax and spend quality time with family or friends."}
{"text":"The place is just gorgeous!!! The tangerines were so delicious and juicy, and the coffee was delicious too!! Oh and the marble rye was so yummy!!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place! I came for the first time yesterday and I'm back again today!! Who knew this hidden gem was even here. An old golf course converted to a beautiful farmers market/meadow, Singh Meadows is so peaceful and perfect.   Think lots of grass, a pond, space for kids to run around and play, nice seating, delicious fresh food and drinks. I can't think of a more perfect place to enjoy life. Free badminton, yard games. Fresh produce and lots of cool local goods for sale.   I am in love with this place and I will come here often!"}
