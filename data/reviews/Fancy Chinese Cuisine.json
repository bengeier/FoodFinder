{"text":"My entire family (grandma down town great grand kids) come here 2-3 times a month for dinner.  I highly recommend that reservations are made bc it's so insanely busy that they may not have any tables free if you just show up.  They take reservations at either 6 or 8pm.  We always go at 8, since we won't have to rush ourselves.  Food is good quality for the most part, we always order the Peking duck everytime.  Also recommended is the king crab dish (if you can afford it), which is a truly massive crab....the shell is big enough to fit as a helmet!  The beef ribs with wasabi sauce is very tasty, as well as the sweet and sour pork.  The tofu dessert is especially smooth, very nice.  Parking can be troublesome, as it's a small lot, but if you take the 8pm reservation, it should be ok.  The only reason I don't give full stars is bc food quality is not always consistent, depending on whoever is in the kitchen.  Also, if they have a function going on, I would not go in, as they tend to severely neglect all other tables in favour of the party...we once had to wait over an hour for just the soup to show up, and all the rest of the food just had a randomly slapped-on-plate look.  All in all one of the best chinese restaurants in the city."}
{"text":"Overall one of my favorite dim sum restaurant. Food is always steaming hot and delicious. Customer service is a hit and missed, depending who you get. Instead of showing up to get a table number, call in 30mins-1hr before you go and they will put your name down on the waiting list. This way when you show up, you will be next in line."}
{"text":"I've come here for both dinner and dim sum.  For dinner, we were able to get one of the private rooms behind the cashier's desk.  We had one of the banquet set meals for 12 people. The service was great and the food was delicious.  For dim sum, I came here around 10:30am on a weekday. There was a bit of a line up as it's cheaper before 11:30am. I think it's $2 per plate before this time. Dim sum was delicious and service was adequate. Dumplings didn't tear apart when you take them out of the steamer so no picking at the fallen filling that's left in the steamer afterwards.  Yay! I'm a fan."}
{"text":"First off, if you ever want to come here, make sure you make a reservation. If not, don't even think about it. They perpetually have a sign on their door that says \"fully booked\"   Secondly, I want to commend this restaurant other English name selection (common, FANCY CHINESE CUISINE?). But even more, I would like to commend their Chinese name selection. It is essentially named after the wealthiest business man in all of Asia. Not that it has anything to do with anything, just wanted to point it out.   The food here is actually pretty good, and this is coming from a Chinese person born and raised eating Chinese food from the homeland. You can't go wrong ordering the peking duck, lobster, chinese style deep fried chicken, and the sweet and sour prawns. Oh man don't even get me started on the sweet and sour prawns. I think I ate the entire plate. Addictive!  If you have a big enough group of people, they will serve you a tofu dessert at the end of the meal that comes in an wooden bamboo pot. It is so very very smooth and delicious!  It is a bit more pricey here, but the food you get is well worth the extra shiny penny."}
{"text":"It is perfectly understandable that for the price of the dim sum here, I may not get a top notch salted egg custard bun. I do, however, expect to find egg in some way, shape or form.   That is not the case here at Fancy Chinese Cuisine. Salted egg custard is substituted by some sort of sweet orange syrup. The orange syrup even has orange dots in it sometimes! I'm unsure as to whether these dots are just intentionally there to make it fancier (harhar) or if the food colouring was just poorly mixed in. The deep fried glutinous rice balls also have this filling, so beware.   Knock-off custard aside, the rest of the dim sum is alright. The rice noodle rolls, fried bean curd and shrimp rolls, beef omasum and clay pot rice are among the better choices. For less than $3.50 a dish (unless it's a \"special\" one) during peak hours and $2.38 during early bird hours, it does the job."}
{"text":"Always full house!!!  We tried dim sum and dinner there, it is decent.  But gotta love their tofu fa in a wooden tub!!!  They serve that at dim sum and dessert for dinner as well!"}
{"text":"Consistent good food.  We usually come here for dinner.  First to time we came, every other table othered Peking duck, so our 2nd visit included it.  It's done pretty good here, not the best I have had...the wrap was a bit doughy.    We tried once for dimsum, but it was only so-so.  Dinner is more memorable.  Yes, parking is chaotic, but we try to eat earlier, so it's tolerable."}
{"text":"I have been here for dinner, but never dim sum until recently with my Dad. We came here and had to wait about 20 mins for their after tea special 1:30PM-4:30PM for $2.68 per dish!  We ordered the siu mai, shrimp chive cake, stuffed shrimp tofu and eggplant, egg tart and one other dish i forgot. They all pretty standard but still good. The best part was ordering the bamboo basket rice with shrimp for $8.95. Its a big portion for 3 ppl at least and has lots of shrimp in halves. Its steamed with garlic and a bit of egg white, but taste really good. If you have the shrimp bamboo fried rice as take-out its priced $12.95, but if you eat in its $8.95 and can have max 2 of that order per table.  I would go back to enjoy that dish itself of course!"}
{"text":"Pros: free newspaper (Singtao or Ming Pao), tofu dessert in wooden pot (first come first serve). Above average dim sum (if you like Rol San in downtown, you ll like this place in uptown).  Cons: ridiculous wait time (45+ min) even at 2ish. You could grab some bakeries and a milk tea at Lucullus next block while you wait.  But still, no one should wait that long for a decent dim sum on the weekend."}
{"text":"Price is good and the quality of food is reasonable at that price. The tofu dessert is amazing. You must try it! The only thing that is bad is not enough parking spots available at the plaza."}
{"text":"Great place to eat with a good selection for dim sum but lines can be a bit long if you don't have a reservation and it has definitely gone up in price over the years"}
{"text":"I always come here for dim sum lunh and don't forget about the delicious shimp fried rice."}
{"text":"If you want to be treated like crap and get attitude from your server, this place is for you.  Tips to survive a meal here:  - ask for things twice because chances are, they ignored you or forgot about you the first time. - look at your food thoroughly because chances are, there's either dirt or a chunk of plastic in it. - the duck they choose for you was clearly on a diet. Be prepared to be unsatisfied. - be prepared to go without the pastries or black sesame dessert as by the time your server remembers to get it for you, there's no more left and you'll be forced to see other tables eating it."}
{"text":"We came here on a Sunday afternoon at 1:30 p.m. for the dim sum special. All small, medium, and large dishes were $3.28. They said the wait was 10 to 20 minutes but it was around a half an hour. The d√©cor was quite nice with some soothing curve patterns. There was a purple wall with some bubbly pattern that looked out of place. Like all dim sum places, even if you do not want tea, you have to pay for it. Here it is $1.20 per person. We had the beef rice noodle with soy sauce. It was not hot. It was a large so perhaps there was more meat which gave the dish higher marks versus other places I've had it. If it was hot, it would a A- to A, but at lukewarm temperatures, B- to B. Next came the dessert tofu fa. The serving size was huge equaling one and a half large soup take out containers. The texture was smooth and very nice and stood out from the equivalent you would find at the end of multi-course Chinese dinners, A-. If you choose a dish you do not like, can you really hold that against the restaurant for making something that does not satisfy you? I would say no. However, what if you accidentally ordered something but it turned out not to be a dish that you are ho-hum about? This happened here. It was a pan fried seafood pancake. Having a good experience at Muncheez I thought I would give crepe/pancakes dishes more tries. Unfortunately, this was heavy and oily. I could not really taste the seafood and there was not much of it, two pieces of shrimp at most. There is turnip in it which I personally do not like the flavor of. I am quite confident in saying that if you do like this dish, this was average to slightly above average, C+ to B. For me it was a C to C+."}
{"text":"Bad food, bad service. Food was very oily, bland and just not good. Will not return here!"}
{"text":"Just *just* had a 10 course meal here and am impressed with the quality of food and speed of service.  Had their house soup (complementary), 1/2 fried chicken (add on to the 10 course meal), peking duck, bok choi in fish broth (not a fan), fried tofu with seafood sauce, fish with veggie stir fry, crystal wrap which is diced duck from the peking duck served with lettuce, a few bowls of white rice, sweet n sour pork, 1/2 cold chicken, 5 desserts for the table (lotus buns, sesame with egg yolk custard, green tea cookies, tofu dessert, red bean dessert and black sesame dessert).  I expected a huge bill but it only came out to $30, tax included.  Not bad not bad...  I wasn't there for the ordering process but our other table had crab instead of lobster and spicy tofu with chives instead of the tofu seafood dish we had.  Would return here for a family gathering.  It is not ultra fancy but there seem to be fancier people.  It is not as loud as in your typical chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good and consistent but you need to make a reservation unless you are willing to wait."}
{"text":"Watch out for hidden $30 \"holiday\" fee that gets added to your bill at the end between Christmas and new years even on days in between that are not holidays. Food is typical Chinese food but service is pretty crappy for this type of restaurant."}
{"text":"I haven't been here for dim sum in over a year, but both times were a huge lineup.  The fried calamari and hai gow were the best dishes we had.  All the others like spare ribs, radish cake, cuttlefish curry, etc. were just okay.  The worst was the BBQ pork rice rolls that had an old refrigerator taste to them.  Service was good though."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner last night with a group of 8 people and it was quite busy for a Monday night - which gave me some hope for this restaurant.   The decor is simple - no gaudy chandeliers or gold gilded walls here. Instead there is light wood paneling on the walls, halogen lights recessed into the ceiling and blue \"mood lighting\" strips over the center part of the ceiling. The front/back part of the restaurant can be partitioned off to make a private room.   What I noticed right away was the overall cleanliness - the tablecloths are bleached white brocade fabric, you can see into part of the kitchen from the main dining room, dirty dishes that the waiters clear away are put into Rubbermaid storage containers with lids (so they can be stacked, and also don't look disgusting to customers walking by the \"cleanup station\") The washrooms have no doors - they are airport style where you walk around a little wall. I liked this since restrooms at Chinese restaurants are usually gross and I never want to touch anything... Automated soap and pull-down paper towel dispesers are also a nice touch. Obviously the manager here thought about hygiene.  The food was pretty good but service was a bit slow. About 4 of our main dishes made it to the table before we were brought our tureen of soup. A few bowls of white rice also took about 10 minutes to get to us. We ordered 3 large crabs prepared 2 ways - fried with chili salt, and wok fried with ginger and scallions. Both were too salty even though we had requested that they be prepared with less salt when we ordered and overall it took away from the crabs. Other things like chicken, fish, stir-fried beef with gai lan (Chinese broccoli) were good, not exceptional. The pork ribs were not impressive.  For dessert I've been used to getting a tureen of red bean dessert soup tossed at me at almost every Chinese restaurant I've been to in the past few years, so I was very surprised and delighted that they brought out THREE desserts for us! There was the red bean soup, but also black sesame (tzee ma woo) and tofu dessert soup (dou fu fa).   Dinner for 8 came to about $120 (with taxes and gratuity). The parking lot in this plaza is small considering there are lots of restaurants in it. It got busier later in the evening (around 7:30-8pm).  During peak evening dining times (Thurs-Sun, after 7pm) be sure to call a couple of days ahead to book a reservation; in fact just save yourself some grief and book a reservation regardless! Each time I come here there's a sign taped to the door saying \"Fully Booked\" - meaning they don't even want to bother dealing with walk-ins and apologizing for being busy.   (I also noticed the security cameras all around the restaurant... Wonder what they are spying on... )"}
{"text":"Recommended for large groups but book in advance. There are several set menu dinners that offer great variety of dishes for everyone to enjoy. A 10 course dinner with dessert is ~$300, tax and tip inclusive. Great for celebrating special occasions with friends and family. The assortment is well planned and the quality is quite good. Also suggest coming in car pool because the parking lot is horribly inadequate. Park at the plaza next door."}
{"text":"Come here every time we visit Toronto from Chicago for the past few years.  The service and food quality have always been excellent and of great value.  This time around, I found both their service and food quality were less than I expected, but were still above their competitors in all measure.  Perhaps to save a few dollar, they now provide cheaper paper napkins instead of cloth ones.  Their spoons and bowls were of the tougher and thicker kind instead of the delicate thinner china.  They have less servers, have to push them working much harder, and forcing us to wait a little longer.  My fear is that they are following the path toward being a common restaurant instead of providing a lead as being a fine dinner.  I shall be back in a few month, and I shall give them one more chance to prove themselves, but I shall start looking for an alternate site as my go to place for fine dinning."}
{"text":"Yummy! Lot of choices! The price very good.  I always go here for high tea time.   Every time need almost 30 mins line up for seats. (I am talking about weekdays.)  Recommand: Soup dumpling! and 'Tofu dessert' (Tofu Fa) LOL"}
{"text":"I had a terrible experience there. As we were waiting to be seated, the lady at the counter spoke to us in this very annoyed tone of voice, and kept on giving everybody annoyed looks. During dinner, we first ordered a 6 course meal, and they gave us free soup. However, because we had a few more people joined us, so the soup and food was gone fast. So we ordered for more food and asked for more soup. Before the food was served, they took away all our utensils along with the soup we asked for (it was still full), and only left us the tea. When we told the waitress who took our tableware away, and ask for replacement, because the elder really wanted the soup, I could not believe the waitress actually said it's already been taken away, she cannot replace it, and there's nothing she can do about it. So we ask for the manager on duty, the manager herself, only gave us new utensils, not a single sorry. The moment our food arrive, the waiter rush over to ask if we would like our dessert serve also. I did notice, they were closing, but it was around 10PM, so I think they were trying to rush us out. I still got to say this, we're paying customers!!  I personally would not even give this restaurant a star. However, Yelp requires at least 1 star.     Terrible service,  food was alright, nothing special. Price was fair.  Would I recommend/return? NO!!"}
{"text":"Came in on a weekday morning at 10:15 am and it was already full.  It was not until about 10:45 am when some of the first set of customers started leaving, by which time the line up is fairly long.  First thing they ask you is which of 2 complimentary Chinese language newspapers you prefer.  The dining area is clean, and staff to customer levels are okay.  From 8:30 am to 11:30 am and also from 1:30 pm to 4:00 pm, S/M/L is $2.88.  Tea is $1.20 per person.  Food quality is good. Portion size is average.   Will return, but probably much earlier in the morning."}
{"text":"The only thing fancy about \"Fancy Chinese Cuisine\" is that they're named after the richest guy in Hong Kong.   The service is HORReeeeBruu here. Let me give you the highlight of the night:  1. My brother reaches to pour hot water into tea pot 2. SLAP SLAP SLAP 3. Shock at the table  Yep, the waitress slapped my brother's hands and reacts all pissed off about us not properly steeping the tea. Mind blown.  If you want to get slapped silly by the waitress, by all means, come to Fancy.   Food is also horrible. Everything was served with those microwave covers on top, and the peking duck was not juicy at all - the flour skin was so floury and was served wrapped in saran wrap. The only thing I liked was the crispy sweet oyster dish.   TLDR; Run away as fast as you can.  P.S - I guess the L.E.D. name tags on the servers were kinda 'fancy'."}
{"text":"May have caught them on the wrong day; came here for Mother's Day dim sum and the staff looked a little bit overwhelmed. Food was solid but they ran out of several dessert \"staples\" relatively soon (egg tart and tofu flower) which was surprising..."}
{"text":"We come here for dim sum. Food is ok.  Service is really bad.   Don't think we will come back again."}
{"text":"Tucked away in a rather outdated corner plaza, I was surprised to find a paper sign outside the glass door that said \"fully booked\" on a Sunday night. Really! Who goes here? I wondered.   Luckily, we had reservations for the night so we were good to go.  It looks better and cleaner on the inside than it does on the exterior, and the food was better than I thought it would be.   The good: I didn't find the food overly salty, the fried shrimp was served hot and crispy (deveined as well, thank goodness, I think it's lazy when restaurants leave them in).  Not amazing, but OK.  I say it's OK because they really seem to try but sometimes miss the mark.   For example, the black bean stir-fried clams were fresh and full to the shell brim with plump clam meat and not a single closed or bad clam was served.  On the other hand, the sauce was a little too goopy, as if too much cornstarch had been added.  The crab was nicely put together with ingredients but was also a bit overcooked so that the crab meat itself was a little dry.   On that very busy night, I'm sure the kitchen had more than their share of work to do that night.  Plus the prices are on the low-mid end and I would say that what you get for it is more than fair."}
{"text":"I enjoy eating at Fancy - the food is pretty good, quick service.  And the price is very reasonable.  If you know you are going there - try to make reservations.  I been there for dinenr a couple of times and seen them put a sign out saying they are fully booked for the evening.   Sevice is pretty good and food very tasty  The down size of this place is it is pretty tight.  So if you have young ones no where for them to run around.  They place each table pretty tightly."}
{"text":"This restaurant serves incredibly slow. The service is despicable. I ordered several dishes with family and we only got 2 dishes within 30 minutes. Other tables beside us got their food far faster. We reminded the staff about our delayed food and they assured us it's coming out but that never happened. In the end as we left, we never even got some of the food we ordered. We ordered har gow and it took over an hour to come. I'd rather just go to a fast food restaurant than deal with this service. I would not come back again."}
{"text":"Went here for dim sum this afternoon. The last time we went to Fancy, we weren't too impressed by the dim sum, but decided to give it another try as our usual place, Ginger and Onion was closed/ moved. Today's dim sum was much better than during our last visit. Last time, the food was just okay. I'm guessing like many restaurants, it is hit or miss, but ingredients tasted much fresher today. I left feeling satisfied. I really liked their custard buns, rice with sausage, and deep fried taro dumplings (although I order the dumplings everytime I get dim sum so I'm probably biased, but these were nice and crispy). The spare ribs, beef tendons and har gow were decent too. I wouldn't order the pig blood (tough and overcooked) or steamed rice noodles (bland) again though. I wouldn't say that the food is fancy or gourmet, but it's good and the price is pretty good."}
{"text":"The food here for dinner is very consistent.  I've never been here for dim sum so I cannot comment on that.  However for dinner, it's the same quality every time.  The service is very good and the place is clean.  Price is reasonable and the taste of everything was just fine for us. There were four of us and we ordered 4 dishes...lobster, chicken, beef with veggies and a mushroom with veggies.  It was the perfect amount of food.  There was a soup to start off with like most Chinese restaurants and an assortment of dessert (red bean, tapioca, tofu dessert) to pick from.  Overall the experience is really good for a Chinese restaurant.  The negative is the there is not enough parking spots in the plaza.  You're pretty much parking at the community centre that is 5 minute walk down the street if you come here after 7pm."}
{"text":"Fancypants in the house!  First off, I always appreciate a good bathroom (no, really) and Fancy delivers. Ethnocentricity aside, dim sum restaurants are not known for the cleanliness or even usability of their bathrooms, but this place features non-stanky facilities and even motion-sensor hand towel dispensers! Oooohhh... always a good idea to judge a restaurant based on its bathroom. Exceptions apply, however.  I would expect as much as most of the staff (and I'm pretty sure management) are transplants from the mysteriously closed Honey and Garlic in the sad husk that was the former Swiss Chalet at Kennedy and Denison plaza. As anyone who used to frequent Honey and Garlic will know, they knew their stuff.  More normally, I like to judge my dim sum places based on a few factors: efficiency, quality and price.  The gold mark of a true Chinese establishment is the efficiency of the staff. Always. If you see waiters loafing about, not doing much, you know you're in for a bad trip. Why? Because you can quickly assume that the management doesn't know what the hell they're doing if they aren't working their staff hard and when that happens, you know the regulations are lax. So, Fancy does well in this respect. They work hard, fast and to the point. Only once did we have to ask them to refill our tea pots. Gold star!  Onto the food... it's decent, to say the least. The sweet tofu dessert came in the most adorable wooden bucket. The har gow were decently sized and not at all half-frozen, unsteamed or dried out! The fried eggplant/tofu with shrimp paste were delicate and light and HOT. Important! They had the right hot sauce(s) and other sauces for steamed beef balls, spring rolls etc. Also important.  Price-wise, not the best. It's more expensive than you'll find at other places in the Markham area, but not as gougingly expensive as the white-linen, fine china places. They charge a lot for \"tea money\" (per person tea charges) so that'll bump your bill up a bit.  I'm told that the owner's son (?) works for the Ontario Food Safety and Inspection board so you won't find any scary or terrifying randomness crawling around in your food. From what I saw and experienced, the place is clean as a whistle.  Definitely worthy of becoming a regular dim sum spot if not for the horrifying parking lot that, for some reason, is a Bermuda Triangle of all automotive sense and logic. Be careful! You will almost be backed into."}
{"text":"I come here regularly for their dimsum. It's my go to dimsum place. For it's price point, it's definitely one of the better dim sum places in Markham. We order a variety and we are rarely disappointed. The food is consistent every time and comes out pretty fast.   I particularly love their tofu dessert, octopus tentacles and Chiu Chow style dumplings (chiu chow fun gor).   The downside is that the wait is always at least half hour on weekends and so I would recommend calling in advance to place a reservation even though you still need to wait with a reservation. They simply put your name on a different list so you get a table a little bit faster.   I've come on a weekday before and it's far less busy. But if you don't mind the wait, the dimsum is well worth it."}
{"text":"Came to Fancy Chinese cuisine this Friday and it was packed.  Decor of the place is nice and modern with a twist of Chinese theme.  We wanted Peking duck and Lobster but they said we cannot get that in the combo and had to order one separate which was disappointing.  We opted for the Peking duck as it looked so good and it was not bad.  The duck was on the small side but was cooked pretty good with crispy skin.  We also got the lettuce wrap for an extra $5.  The place was nice and clean as the items we ordered such as the lettuce and sauce/toppings for Peking duck was sealed in plastic wrap.  The service was quick and good.  We ordered a dinner for 5 combo - we get to choose one main course from Lobster, crab, Peking duck, etc and than choose 4 dishes from the below list (I took a pic of the combo menu but it is kinda blurry).  We got the Peking duck, sweet and sour pork, Deep fried sole fillet, Half Crispy Chicken and this Bok choy with mushroom.  The food was fast and quality is good.  The combo for 5 was around $73 which is pretty good price.  You also get free soup of the day and dessert - you have 3 choice - red bean soup, tofu pudding and something else I didn't understand.  haha.  Most of us opt for the tofu dessert as it is pretty famous for that. The parking lot is a mess thou and there are a lot of mad drivers that almost hit me.  Overall, Fancy Chinese Cuisine is a nice find in a small plaza that I didn't even know exist.  They also take credit card which is a good thing.  Rating:  Service: 3/5 Food Quality: 4/5 Comfort 3/5 Decor  4/5 Value: 4/5 Parking: 2/5"}
{"text":"This place has a fantastic deal, they don't expect tips. Or at least that's the impression we got from their horrible service.  I am a paying customer and you are not a volunteer. Never again.  The nail in the coffin: - when the waitress waved me off for asking her to check on our dessert after the table behind us got theirs and we had ordered before them.   Yep, ever get a hand wave and an eye roll from someone you're expecting to tip? Mind blown.  Needless to say, my meal this evening was such a disappointment. The Peking duck was all skin, the wrap was floury, the server spilled our sweet and sour sauce for the fish and didn't replace it, the chicken and vegetable dish tasted the same as the beef and mushroom dish, and the lettuce wrap came an hour after the rest of our dishes arrived still wrapped in seran wrap.   Don't waste your money here. With plenty of Chinese restaurants in Markham, go somewhere else. You work hard for your money, so hard for your money, so go somewhere where they'll treat you right."}
{"text":"I've only really been here for dim sum, so I can't really comment on the dinner experience. Originally this restaurant was only so so, but there seems to have been a change in their employees because much of the older managers/waiters have been replaced by relatively younger workers. (I noticed this months ago, so not exactly a new change.)Most would think that the younger crew would be less responsible, but ironically they actually seem to be working harder than the original set of workers, which helped to improve my experience at the restaurant.  Food wise, I believe that it's among the better dim sum places that provides quality food, along with affordable pricing. Some may argue that restaurants such as Spring Court Villa have better dim sum, but even if that were true, you'd be paying double the bill that you would get at Fancy at Spring Court.  Food is flavourful, and of course there's msg but for a Chinese restaurant it's not that bad. Some of my fave dishes include the egg/milk tart, chicken pie, and chicken feet (if you think it sounds gross, just give it a chance!)  Overall this restaurant offers good food, with a good price to boot. My go to dimsum restaurant with my fam ;)  EDIT: In addition, you order by filling in a sheet, but there are some items that they roll around in carts. So they've combined both the efficiency of sheets and the cultural value of dimsum carts! A popular cart item is the tofu fa. I personally have never tried it, but I've heard good things, and it comes in a BIG tub to share =)"}
{"text":"The venue Toronto/GTA, the target a holiday dinner. Weather in Canada and the holiday spirit, two entities that have been at loggerheads since time immemorial.  The weather seemed to have the upper hand in this battle as it brought down most of the city to its knees with an ice storm and just as a final finishing blow when the opponent is down, decided to throw a snow storm punch. But never underestimate the heart of a champion (dedicated food lovers in this case) as plans were set forth with all sorts of arrangements made for back up and then back ups back up in case one spot fell through. In the end the food luvers triumphed and threw a one two combo of their own that won this battle. After it became impossible for my hosts to pick me up from downtown an alternate plan was formulated and I met them up town. My normally short walk to the Union Station felt like Rocky Balboa running/training through the street of Philadelphia  (cue in the theme from Rocky) Risin' up, back on the street Did my time, took my chances Went the distance Now I'm back on my feet Just a man and his will to survive So many times, it happens too fast You trade your passion for glory Don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past You must fight just to keep them alive  It's the eye of the tiger....... Ah well even with numerous detours due to power outage we made it to this venue. My hosts are regulars here and had a good table reserved (red envelopes help in times like these). This was a set menu so other than sharing the wine and see the events unfold there was not much else to ponder in terms of food. So here is a blow by blow  1)  BBQ Pork with Jelly Fish (I don't eat pork but did enjoy the Jelly Fish it was seasoned well) 2) Seafood Medley. One of the better dish we had for this meal. Nice plump shrimps and scallops cooked to the right consistency.  3) Hai Kim. Crab claw with stuffing. One of my fav items on the dim sum menu. Served pipping hot. Just right IMO 4) Sharkfin Soup with crab meat (OK before everyone pulls out the pitch forks I don't have any appreciation for this dish and was obligated to have it as to honor my generous hosts) This version was one of the better iteration of this soup I have had. Sharkfin is almost always lost in soup but the crab meat at least provided the texture and the seasoning satisfied the umami one craves.  5) Fried stuffed chicken  with shrimp paste. My hosts had taken notes I guess when I raved about this dish I had tried at a UYE at Maple Yip Restaurant. Maple Yip does it a lot better IMO as this was OK. Not your mundane take on fried chicken for sure. I would describe this dish more like Hai Kim with chicken so if you like those taste profiles by all means go for it.  6) Scallops with greens and garlic. Hmm I didn't care for this dish much as the dried texture doesn't appeal to me. Greens were cooked and seasoned well.  7) Steamed Grouper with Scallions. This one disappointed, as even the hosts commented that it was way over cooked. 8) Stir fried lobster with E Fu noodles. A bit starchy for the meat IMO. The noodles were done just right. 9) Seafood rice in wrapped in lotus Root. I didn't try this dish as it had pork sausage in it.  10) Assorted desserts. Not a big fan of desserts for this cuisine. The Tofu with syrup was the better choice IMO.  Other items being just run of mill items. The service was immaculate but I guess this had a lot to do with the red envelopes being handed out to staff and my hosts being regulars here. Even though the place was at capacity (bursting through the seams if you ask me) they performed well. All said and done a good way to spend a dreaded day in the comfort of family and friends. 3.5 Stars."}
{"text":"Came here for dim sum on a Sunday. Restaurant seems to be very popular for seniors, probably because they give you free newspaper. Food was nothing special. Ran out of egg tart was offer milk tart instead. Got the tofu dessert which wasn't as smooth as expected. Custard bun was my favourite but some have more filling then other. Just a FYI let it cool down a bit service wise was pretty brutal, ask a server for napkins and told to ask someone else because she is carrying dim sum. Typical can't expect much service from these place, even saw two employees arguing with each other smh."}
{"text":"A friend of mine and I took a pilgrimage up to Pacific Mall this morning as we were planning to buy a large batch of dumplings from the local manufacturer who's up there. When we go, we usually stop for a quick Dim Sum brunch at Ginger & Onion but we found out, to our dismay, that they closed down a couple of weeks ago...  With Dim Sum deeply on our minds, I suggested Fancy as our alternative as I had gone here once before earlier this year when I found the lineup at Ginger & Onion to be well over 45 minutes.   I remember Fancy as being a very good alternative but on my second visit, I realized that Fancy is actually very good! What really caught my attention this time was how good the Shu Mai was. Better than almost any of my other regular Dim Sum joints. Everything else was of course very good as well and I think that Fancy deserves a more regular pilgrimage up from the downtown core.  If there is anything to complain about, it is that the area where they are has so little parking that it's always a struggle to find someplace to leave our car."}
{"text":"I was excited to try a new dim sum place, especially one named Fancy! Getting to Fancy wasn't difficult to find, just north of Steeles on Kennedy. We arrived for dim sum, the day after Chinese new year. Unfortunately, just for today it seemed, there was no early bird or afternoon pricing (it was peak hour prices all day), so it was a bit pricey for 10am dimsum. The total for 16 dishes (4 people), plus tea, tax and tip came up to about $70. Just rating the dimsum, everything was pretty average tasting. If you do come, try to come at a time when the prices per dish are cheaper."}
{"text":"Came for dim sum  85 for 18 dishes, 7 people,  Service was passable but they forgot a dish and when we asked them, they served it to us but it was still cold inside.  Otherwise, food was good. A little on the pricier side but we were full."}
{"text":"Went for dim sum on a Saturday morning. Got there around 10:45 and waited about 20 minutes for a table. They have a special before 11:30 where s, m and l are all for $2.88. Decent food for a good price. Will definitely be back. Parking can be a bit tough though so best to go early."}
{"text":"Dim Sum is great...awesome choices of dim sum, parking is also easy however packed in the morning. Come earlier in order to get a seat.  Service is also great and friendly people.Recommended to come more often."}
{"text":"Dropped by for the first time and was extremely satisfied. I read the reviews prior to going and waa sure my husband and i wouldn't get a table as we did not make a reservation. Howevern we were lucky to get a table right away even though it was really busy!  The menu had a huge variety of items. My husband and i got fried shrimp dumplings which was really good. For the main course we had the thai fried rice which was scrumptious as well. However, the stir fried oyster is to die for! It was a little on the pricey side, but it makes sense as oysters are pretty expensive. We were really please with the food and the quantity was decent as well. We devoured the oysters but had to pack the rice as we couldn't finish it all.  The service was pretty good. We didn't have to wait too long for the food.  I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Impressive. I seldom enjoy yumcha experiences but I must say, the food here is pretty good. Thinking back to the many similar restaurants I've been to, this place definitely surpasses them all.  All of the dishes were served steaming hot, the flavours, textures, and colours of the food were appetizing and delicious, and service was quick. The deep fried tofu rice noodle roll in particular, was a unique and very yummy dish. I would highly recommend you order it. The only complaint I have for this restaurant is their egg yolk buns. It's one of my favorite dishes so you could see why I'd be a little disappointed. The yolk wasn't runny and the bun wasn't hot enough.   I would definitely come back again the next time my parents force me into eating this type of cuisine (yum cha)."}
{"text":"Damn girl! You fancy!  My family came for a birthday dinner for my bro. After braving the nightmarish parking lot (kind of small considering all the restaurants in the place) I was greeted by a sign on the door that said \"fully booked, please reserve ahead next time\" or something. My brother and I had a chuckle about that. Seriously, when is a Chinese restaurant ever FULLY BOOKED?! The servers all had these LED flashing nametags that were pretty cheesy, and the decor was classic Chinese Restaurant: peach wallpaper and recessed coloured fluorescent strips in the ceiling.  When the food came, I was pleasantly surprised. Then more came and I was in heaven. Basically, every dish tasted really really good. My bro is a fried rice snob, and he stated the that fried rice was top notch. I really enjoyed the deep fried fish in corn sauce.. still crispy under the sauce. Their deep fried pork chop also managed to be tender and not greasy at all. The peking duck with flour and lettuce wraps were also really great. Service was good and the food came out quickly. We had a ton of other dishes that I can't name/remember at the moment. There was a LOT of food. For dessert, they had three kinds at our table: my favourite sweet tofu soup thing, a sweet sesame soup thing and the dreaded red bean soup. Two out of three ain't bad.   All in all, it was a little less than $20 per person including tax and tip which is considered expensive for my family, but I think it's a steal. We had tons of leftovers to take home.  I will definitely be back for dinner with friends. I'm already planning on coming back here for my birthday. Next time, we're totally going to try their seafood.   If you'd like to go for dinner, make sure to reserve about a week ahead."}
{"text":"Came here for dim sum at 10:30 with some friends.  We waited for around half an hour for a table, but it was a civic holiday, so to be expected.  We ordered pretty standard fare: congee, bbq pork buns, siu mai, har gow, turnip cake, honey-glazed pork ribs, squid tentacles.  The food took a really long time to get here and it's nothing to write home about.  Wasn't great, wasn't terrible.  Their portions aren't the biggest for their prices though; I left feeling unsatisfied and still hungry."}
{"text":"Although it's not entirely \"Fancy\" inside, the food is definitely worth its price (especially during happy hour)! Between opening and 11:30am, and 1:30pm-3:30pm, the price is $3.18 for all small, medium, large sizes on weekends, and $2.98 on weekdays. Their portion sizes are average and the food is absolutely delicious!  Normally, we order their rice noodles with beef and enoki mushrooms or shrimp. They do have an off the menu order for tofu pudding, which is classified as a 'medium' dish and is a MUST ORDER. It comes in a medium sized wooden container and definitely enough for 6 large bowls. When ordered, they have a separate bowl of sugar for you to scoop on top of your bowl of tofu pudding. It's not overly sweet and delicious when mixed in with your tofu pudding.  Among other things, if you don't make it for their happy hour, Fancy has lunch specials from 11:30am-3:30pm. Food selection ranges from mixed sauce fried rice, fried noodles, etc. Those dishes are fairly priced and come in large portions.  Fancy is definitely a place to visit and I will definitely continue to come here for Sunday dim sum!"}
{"text":"Overpriced! Peking duck taste horrible. Customer service needs to be improved. Stop putting starch in everything and very salty"}
{"text":"Dim sum!!! Four of us came and we ordered: sui mai, har gow, black bean ribs, beef tripe, congee with minced pork and egg, meat in rice noodle, deep fried taro dumplings, bok choi with goji, stir fried ho fun noodle with beef, and eggplant/tofu with shrimp.  Yumsville. Would recommend pretty much everything we ate, except maybe the har gow, meat in rice noodle, and eggplant/tofu with shrimp. I found that the har gow wrapping was a bit mushy. Meat in rice noodle didn't have enough filling, but taste was still good. The eggplant was quite oily and didn't have much flavour even with the shrimp on top and the sauce it comes with.  Top choices: the deep fried taro dumplings, sui mai, and the black bean ribs. The ribs are fall-off-the-bone! Congee was also great. The bok choi goji was a really nice combo - the gojis were so sweet. Ho fun with beef wasn't overly oily, and the beef pieces were tender. Loved mixing it w the hot sauce that comes w the sui mai. Beef tripe here doesn't stand out compared to other dim sum places that I've had it, so I enjoyed it ad usual. Would've been nice with a bit more garlic flavour in the sauce.  Overall, great place for dim sum. You get your value for the money. Tip: come in the non-busy times (before 11:30am or after 1:30pm) to get a deal on the dim sum dishes, and to avoid the crowds! Next time I gotta save room for the tofu dessert...have heard so much good stuff about it."}
{"text":"We visited on a Thursday around 12:45pm. It was busy, but no wait time. Restaurant is clean-ish and decor is like your typical chinese restaurant.  Food - 3.5/5  Ordered 6 items, see pictures below. I felt the food was hit or miss. The deep fried squid tentacles were one of the best I've had. Not too oily, very crisp, with a subtle squid flavour. The beef tendon was also very tasty; sauce was full of flavour and tendon melt in your mouth. Pumpkin congee and steamed taro cake were good, but nothing to write home about. Siu mai was a too oily; you can see the oil glistening in my pictures. The deep fried savoury triangle was the worst I've had. The dough was way too thick and the filling was primarily just minced pork. Usually there's a couple of other ingredients in there and the size of the individual triangles are usually bigger. I was quite surprised and disappointed that this simple dish was done so poorly. There were a few carts being pushed around and tofu fa dessert was one of them. We didn't order it at the time, but asked to take it to go afterwards. It was horrible. Also the worst tofu fa I've ever eaten. It was not silky/smooth at all and actually chunky and thick. Felt like I was eating normal tofu actually. We placed 1 order and they gave us 2 big containers of it. We thought we lucked out at first, but tasting it afterwards, we realized they were just trying to get rid of it. I would have given Fancy a 3.5/5 but took off half a star for the tofu fa. My other experiences at this restaurant have been better though, so it's still a place I would frequent.   Service - 3.5/5 Typical chinese dim sum service. Have to flag down the wait staff to get anything you want. Very typical. Food came out pretty fast.   Value - 3.75/5 If you come between the hours of 8:30am - 11:30am and 1:30pm - 4:00pm, the dishes labelled S, M, L are all $3.18. If you come between 11:30am and 1:30pm, S is $3.18, M is  $3.58, L is $3.88. Most dim sum places have this sort of deal with varying times and prices. Fancy is reasonably priced and I would definitely go again."}
{"text":"The fried eel in salt and pepper was actually really good!  The eel meat was quite tender and moist.  It wasn't very heavily seasoned in salt and pepper so you didn't have to worry about it being too salty.  This was the best dish of the night."}
{"text":"I have heard many aunties and uncles ranting and raving about how good the food is at Fancy Chinese Cuisine, and how hard it is to book a reservation.  It is alleged that without a reservation you shouldn't even think about stepping foot in this restaurant - even on a weekday!  It is also alleged that you must make reservations 2 weeks in advance.  With all this hype - I had to go see for myself if these allegations were true.    The place was indeed pretty busy for a weekday.  Upon entering, I noticed a sign on the door that said \"FULLY BOOKED.\"  I am just wondering if they keep that sign up permanently or if they really ARE that popular as I have passed by many a times and the same sign was hanging on the door.  Fabricated demand (e.g. marketing tactic?) or truth?  I would soon find out.  Whenever we go out with my uncle, we let him do the ordering.  Tonight, the fate of my taste buds would again, rest in his hands.  My uncle likes fried, or roasted things - things with a nice crunchy texture and he loves his carbs.  So I was not surprised at his menu selection tonight.  Appetizer:  Daikon Radish and Pork Bone Soup - The natural \"sweetness\" of the daikon radish gave this soup a really refreshing flavour.  Although it was not a highly concentrated soup, it was quite tasty.  But it was not as \"lo for\" (old fire) as I've had.  The term \"lo for\" refers to the amount of intense flavour that is attributed to the beef/chicken/pork bones that are used to form the soup base, usually, from long hours of slow cooking.    Courses: Roasted Pork with Wakame Salad & Jellyfish - The pork was really salty and had an odd taste to it.  The skin was not the crispiest either.  However, I liked that the pork was the right amount of fat to meat as sometimes all you are eating are mouthfuls of fat.  They could've been a bit more generous with the serving of jellyfish that accompanied the pork.  Garlic-Roasted Chicken - Chicken was tender and juicy though lacking in any real flavour.  The skin was nice and crisp and I loved the fried bits of minced garlic.  I hope I brought a stick of gum?  Ginger-Scallion Braised Lobster - This was a tasty dish, and the size of the lobster was bigger than most restaurants I've eaten at.  My sister always goes for the tail, and she pulled out a substantial chunk of meat from it.  The lobster was fresh, and meat was solid.  Yum!  Yeung Chow Fried Rice - Pretty standard.  Has chunks of barbecued pork, shrimp, and broccoli in it.  It was not too oily nor too salty.  Just right.  Fried Calamari w/ Tempura Jalapenos - This was an interesting dish.  Portion sizes were mini-esque though.  It was a spicy dish.  The batter was light and not too oily.  Honey Garlic Beef & Chinese Broccoli - A tad bit on the sweet side for me.  If you're bringing your nana do not order this dish as she might chip a tooth in her dentures trying to eat the Chinese Broccoli stems.  If I were making a land model, the broccoli would've been one of the trees.    Sweet & Sour Battered Fish - The batter, again, was fresh and not soaked in oil.  The colour was a nice pale yellow, which means they use fresh oil (thank goodness!).    Dessert: What I loved about Fancy was that desserts are served in individual portions which meant that everyone could get their heart's desire.  You could choose from: Red Bean Soup, Black Sesame Soup and Tofu w/ Simple Syrup.  I ordered the Tofu w/ Simple Syrup and they neglected to include the syrup.  I had to ask for them to bring it.  I looked around and saw that other tables, in addition to their sweet soup of choice, got a plate of green tea cookies and sesame balls.  Not sure if this depends on the amount you spend, or if you have to order their set dinners.  But we didn't get to sample these.  Verdict:  The Chinese name of Fancy Chinese Cuisine is Li Ka Shing, which phonetically sounds like the name of the well-known Hong Kong tycoon who is the richest man of East Asian decent, and the world's 10th wealthiest.  However, something tells me that if Mr. Li were to visit Toronto that he wouldn't choose to dine at Fancy.    Some of the dishes were a hit, some of them were a miss - but there was nothing that really stood out in my mind that differentiated their cuisine from other Chinese restaurants I've been to.  Some points of differentiation from the service standpoint included: replacing dirty dishes with clean ones and providing wet naps.  From a plating and presentation perspective, Fancy really doesn't make it a priority.  The dishes came out at assembly-line speeds as we found ourselves eating at competitive speeds just to make space for the courses as they arrived at the table.  However, the high-speed service came to a lull once we were finished our main courses.  The bill appeared at the table even before dessert was served.  It felt as if we became an afterthought once the main courses were served and the bill was paid.  Parking was not a problem, but keep in mind I went on a weekday."}
{"text":"For dim sum, you get a paper and order instead of carts. If you're seated and order before 11:30am on weekends every dim sum dish is $3.20. Good deal and food was good. Service was not great but to be expected"}
{"text":"Fancy Chinese Cuisine serves up delicious and high quality Chinese food at reasonable prices. The service was mediocre and passable. The restaurant is clean but the decor is dated. However, you are not coming to Fancy for service and decor.  You are coming for the reasonably priced food.   We ordered the 3 course Peking Duck meal and still had left overs. The Peking Duck was well cooked. I would highly recommend the Peking Duck.   Fancy usually has a bit of a wait on the weekends - so plan accordingly."}
{"text":"Not too shabby.   Made a reservation about a 1.5 weeks in advance and I was surprised I was on the list. We got our table in about 15 mins of waiting. I don't really understand their queuing system, but i think we were just put in priority bc we made a reservation.   Food choices, are your basics. Har Gow, congee, rice noodle rolls, turnip cake etc. Prices range from $2.70-3 depends on size. If you order before 11:30 on Saturday, it's $2.50. I think this is why I made a res. for 11am, and we didn't seat until closer to 11:20. After looking at the menu, I made out the chinese at the bottom and I was like omg!!  We were on the border line of this cut off, and i don't think she gave us this deal.   Stuff didn't taste terrible, except some got cold quickly, but nothing I would run home and call about. I've had better for simliar price.   There are three things on the dim sum menu with no translation. I have learnt that if in doubt, do not order it. We were looking for some vegetarian dishes and I read the first two words of  a 4 part phrase (Gow Choy, nine vegetable, garlic chives). I thought it was a dumpling. UHHH, I ended up with blood cubes, with the chives on top. Fail. And I've learnt my lesson.   Service was okay. Not especially fast, but they were busy. Our dessert arrived first, but good thing it was supposed to be served room temperature.   Wouldn't come out of my way for here, but if in the area, an okay choice."}
{"text":"Like its distant cousins, Ginger & Onion and Honey & Garlic, Fancy offers an efficient,  somewhat inconsistent fare, though reasonably priced and in a pleasant and comfortable setting. Nothing in particular stands out on the menu - although the tofu dessert is better than most. I imagine everything is done by the book in the kitchen. I compare the food to that at Asian Legend - generic and not much imagination. You go there because it's a safe choice."}
{"text":"Best dim sum that I've ever had in my life! I agree with those who think it's true when they say that Chinese food in Toronto is better than the US. We got there early (around 9:30am) and we didn't have to wait at all. However, when we left around 11am, there was a line out the door!  Their menu is very extensive and the prices are great for the quality and portions. Everything tasted fresh and was cooked perfectly. We ordered heaps of plates and all of food came out in a timely manner. We were sat in the back so there weren't many carts that came by, but we were able to grab the most AMAZING puff filled with a warm custard/egg yolk mix... and now I'm dreaming of that dessert.  One star off for the service (typical Asian service) and the parking situation, which was horrendous. There are a ton of shops in the plaza, but limited parking in the their lot. I'm looking forward to coming back again!"}
{"text":"This place is packed every weekend which makes it very hard to find parking in such a small parking lot.   I get my dimsum fix and always leave satisfied. Make sure to get their homemade sweet tofu dessert (bang for your buck)  The service is pretty good too. They do their best to make sure you get everything you ask for in a timely manner. I rarely have to ask a second time for something.  They all work fast pace.  Try to go early to get a spot if you can!"}
{"text":"Once again another Chinese restaurant makes an attempt to fill this corner at 14th ave. and Kennedy rd. and it opened just recently so when I came here on Wednesday 2:00 pm hoping everyone is at work, NOPE!  I was one of the younger person there though, at least give me that.  Waited behind approximately 5 groups of 3+ and as I wait I heard a guy at a table said \"Hot Pot Rice\" again? as 1 of 2 Push-Cart Lady circled their table but this is an ORDER FORM style place.  The ONLY other cart was for Egg Tarts.  Another table ordered what I found later to be Egg White Stir Fried Glass Noodle and the Waitress ask them \"What a Deal?\" where I found later on it's a lunch special item for $5.95 that can feed 2.  The atmosphere here is no longer Traditional Chinese like it's predecessors but it is more Modernized Casual which makes it more relaxing for me so it doesn't feel like you're going to a Banquet Dinner.  Monday - Friday ($2.00, except special items) 8:30 am - 11:30 am 1:30 pm - 4:00 pm  Weekends ($2.30, except special items) 8:30 am - 11:30 am 1:30 pm - 4:00 pm  The PEAK(11:30 am - 1:30 pm) time has specified pricing.  The Dim Sum pricing is inline with the immediate area as it's only a block away from Honey & Garlic.  The Lunch Special list looked on point as well, as my nose lead me to the Ginger Onion LOBSTER pot(9.95) I saw at the next table.  The Hot Pot Rice(Ribs & Chicken Feet) was standard but what was NEW to me was the POT they used which is more like the Cast Iron used for HK Sizzling Steaks rather than Ceramic.  Egg White Stir Fried Glass Noodle I mentioned above was good too and I realized it had Pork Bites in it as well as Fried Dried Scallop Shreds on top.  Took HALF of this home for my family.  Shrimp Dumpling is NICE, Chiu Chow Dumpling had good clean filling that wasn't mixed into a SLOPPY mess, Egg Tarts were FLAKY but Tiny.  Ordered Pan Fried Seafood Pan Cake which felt like it was all DOUGH so I will not try it next time.  Another unique item was Sticky Rice Roll w/Mango which was nice and CRISPY outside but I wish there's more Mango flavour inside but worth a try.  The old standard for me is always Siu Mai, but this one was SUBPAR as it looked a little mangled and didn't fit the standard SHAPE.  It had a piece of Shrimp in it as well as Fish Eggs(Tobiko) on top and something else I was able to PICK OUT, a small whole piece of Pork Fat.  I love Pork Fat as much as the next guy, but not in this application.  I only had 1 Siu Mai, so maybe I got LUCKY.  IF you want to come for a LATE LUNCH, I observed that around 2:30 pm about half the tables became available.  I also saw a Hand Sanitizer on their wall next to the FISHY in the tanks.  You will notice the KING CRABS for sure while you wait.  FYI, there's around 4 Security Cameras scanning the area which is displayed on an LCD behind the register counter.  SMILE!"}
{"text":"Decent pricing and quality for Chinese food. Their menu is usually set meaning you have a choice to select one main dish (Peking duck, lobster, fish, crab) and sides. The sides can range from 3+ dishes which include more simple dishes like sweet and sour pork, eggplant, steamed chicken, short ribs etc. I like the deep fried fish with sweet and sour sauce also Peking duck and garlic and ginger lobster is recommended. Prices range from 80+ which is not bad for 4 ppl or more. Food comes out fairly quick. Generally you would have to reserve as it gets booked pretty quick. You will also get complementary soup- usually pork soup. They also give you chinese dessert as well- tofu, black sesame and red bean depending what they have that day. Would recommend coming here for a group dinner."}
{"text":"Came here at 9:30am today, which was Good Friday and we waited about 15 minutes for seats, which wasn't too bad. The seats were fairly spacious, for three people, we were given a six person table, and the newspaper came along when we ordered the tea.  Regular price (because it is considered a holiday):  S $3.38,  M $3.78,  L $4.18,  SP $4.38  We ordered a total of seven dishes. The Chiu chow styled dumpling and chives and shrimp dumpling tasted average and we're average in size, the Chiu chow dumpling is usually massive anyways. I liked that they had a solid filling. It wasn't like those places that would try to put less ingredients in the filling.  The chicken pie was good, but since a lot of dim sum places offer this, it wasn't anything especially new to me. We also got a shrimp rice roll, which was standard to me. The rice roll though is quite smooth.  I really recommend the green onion and lap cheung pancake because it's delicious when it's freshly made. In addition, their honey braised ??? was quite tasty. The meat seemed a little overcooked, but it counted as a special dish, which isn't that expensive compared to many other places that charge $7.  I didn't really like the radish cake. There was a lot of flour, there wasn't a lot of radish for me to taste and it wasn't crispy enough for my personal liking."}
{"text":"The braised fish with tofu was excellent! Great clean dining atmosphere, nice & efficient staff. Will come back in the future to try their dimsum!"}
{"text":"Huh. No review yet. Okay then. This is my mother's side of the family's go-to restaurant for family dinners. It's not amazing, but it'll do. They still have those set dinners where you order 3 dishes, then choose a special dish (eel, Peking duck, lobster, crab, etc.). I forget how much this costs now. Go for the eel. It's the most value for money.   The Peking duck is hit and miss. I've had it where it's been amazing and the duck, even sans skin and stuff, was my favorite part of the meal because it was super tender and delicious, and I've also had it where it's been on the dry side, and the crepes/pancakes for wrapping the Peking duck has been on the thicker side.   A nice thing for this restaurant is that they usually have a few kinds of sweet soup to choose from. We're fans of the black sesame sweet soup, and the tofu flower.   Do make reservations before coming. They're quite busy."}
{"text":"At 2PM today, I had a good dim sum where I had ordered 11 items for about $35.00.  I still had to wait for about 25 mins even though they said the wait would be 15 mins.  When I sat down, they gave me a piece of paper, so I can check off the food items I want.  I had ordered chicken feet, fried dough, congee, egg tart, etc.  After we received our 11 items, we couldn't finish half of the things that were on the table, so we packed it to go.  Gratuity is 10% usually, but give more if their service is awesome and staff there are friendly."}
{"text":"A good quality dimsum place with no overall complaints. Come here before 11:30 or after 1:30 to take advantage of the special pricing. You order on a paper menu that also has English on it and this is not a traditional cart based dim sum experience (although they did have some extra items on the carts).  We ordered 14 plates and here were my notes: - Food was hot and fresh - The bean curd roll was amazing -  Sesame glutinous rice balls were really good. The custard inside was melted like an sunny side egg yolk - Felt there could have been more fried doughnut rice roll, there was only a stick or two -  Steamed rice was better than average  - Har gow/siu mai/chicken feet/beef balls etc were standard  - Total price out the door was $50 for four people, pretty decent (we were all full and took some home too)  Service was prompt, our tea was refilled without any problems. We didn't need to wait at all as we arrived at 11am. Although I have to say we were seated in the private section where there were around 10+ tables and you're enclosed by four boards/walls. I'm not claustrophobic by any means but it felt really weird not having any windows."}
{"text":"Havent been here in a while, because I got quite sick of their dim sum. But I recently came in Saturday morning for the morning special and I was delighted with the food again. They definitely increased the price though. But hey,its worth it if they are able to keep the quality. I came at 8:45 and there were only a few tables left. At 9am there was a hige crowd already lining up.   S/m/l on saturday from 8:30-11 is $3.18. From monday-friday it is $2.88. Tea price per person is $1.20. Even after the special they have a lot of \"s\" dishes which is $3.18 or 2.88 on weekends so I dont think it is a big deal not coming in before 11. Plus they have alot of afternoon dishes like the shrimp fried rice in bamboo leaf for $8.75 which I think is super worth. Portion is huge too.  For the dim sum, I got the spare rib rice, steamed bean curd with veggies and beef intestine with turnip. All three were amazing, fresh, and hot. They give our free chinese newspaper in the morning as well."}
{"text":"Huge line up Waited almost 1 hour for a table For the amount of people that were dining at this restaurant the food was not that great Dishes were regular to below average for dim sum in the Markham area Would not come back"}
{"text":"Went for the dim sum.   Awesome food and service at very reasonable prices.   Recommend to friend!   Especially like the barbecue pork buns and the crispy egg tarts.   One negative is the difficulty with parking but it's hard to fault the restaurant for this."}
{"text":"Not bad for dim sum (go early) and not bad for dinner (go early).  Why go early?  The parking lot for the restaurant is not that large and is shared with other smaller restaurants or offices.  The hosts/servers are fairly nice and the food is fairly decent.  One word of advice though...Don't order the Yang Chow fried rice.  The dish was kind of bland and the shrimp didn't taste fresh.  I think they use frozen shrimp.  Otherwise, the fried tofu dishes or the crispy fried skin chicken is kind of divine."}
{"text":"This is one of the best chinese restaurants in terms of food quality and price. The price is on point for the quality of food you get. I've been here on multiple occasions for breakfast (dimsum) and dinner and serivce has been consistent. Of course like most good chinese restaurants, go a bit early as there is usually a line to be seated. We made reservations and still had to wait 20 mins for a table with my family. My favourite here is the pekking duck with lettuce wraps (+$5) and my mom loves getting the fresh bass. Other than that, I don't usually do the ordering nor am I picky but everything is generally delicious. Definitely recommmend!"}
{"text":"Very good Dim Sum, dinner menu is so so, Beijing duck is kind of salty, parking is hard to find but still come for Dim Sum"}
{"text":"We were here for a birthday dinner and ordered the $229 prix fixe menu for twelve. In the past,this has always been a decent family restaurant, decent price, service and quality. My last visit was six months ago and found that the quality of both have deteriorated.   There should he twelve pieces of spring rolls but one was missing. The menu mentioned that the lobster would be at least 4.5 lbs but when it arrived, we were expecting a big lobster of 4.5 lbs. however,upon enquiry, we were told that the menu did not specify that it would be one lobster. The point was they only promised the weight and even if it is a dish of two lobsters as long as they deliver 4.5 lbs, that is what they promise. The overall price for Friday, Saturday and Sunday is an additional $60. The price and quality of food has a clear gap.  They also gave us a wrong dish. There was no sweet and sour pork on the menu but it arrived erroneously. Upon enquiry, the manager did not apologize and just took the dish away!!   Overall, poor expeelrience. Disappointing!"}
{"text":"?????????????????????????plaza??????????????????????????????????????????????????d,?????????????ok,????????????????????????????????????ok??????????ok??"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, after years of coming to this restaurant for both dimsum, lunches, and dinners, I'm extremely disappointed in the quality of their food and service and it's dropped significantly with each visit. Their dimsum is always packed and lineups go for close to 30-45 minutes. The quality of their dimsum has become quite oily and fatty, with the main attractions being their noodle/rice specials offered after 11am.   For dinner service, their set menus start from $60 with meals geared towards tables of 5 or more. However, the servers are all extremely pushy and encourage all tables to order 6 pound lobsters and their set meals, which is just an excessive amount of food for smaller parties. This place is also extremely rushed giving you the bill as soon as you finish eating (without you ever requesting it!) and in the middle of another table's dinner, they explicitly asked if they were done with dinner and wanted to leave yet. Their practices and behaviour is extremely uncalled for and rude.   Our party of three sat down for about an hour long dinner and we definitely felt extremely rushed at the end, as though we were being hurried out by staff, even though we had ordered 4 dishes among our table. Overall, their food is on the cheap end, but you pay for it with a poor quality of food, awful rushed service, and a pressure to over-order."}
{"text":"Fancy has been here for years, but I've never stepped foot into this venue. Finally coming here for dinner, its always recommended to make reservations as this is a popular place which in turn makes it impossible to find parking at times. If you're a dim sum lover they've got great dim sum options here usually before 11:30am or after 1:30pm."}
{"text":"Fancy Chinese cuisine is anything but \"fancy\".    I just had the most terrible dining experience at this place. For anybody wanting a nice, pleasant meal, please don't come here.  The waitress spilled chicken sauce all over my girlfriend's high end jacket.  The manager and owner did not offer to pay for the dry cleaning.  As a matter of fact, they were even rude about it, brushing off the incident like its not a big deal and that we should be just clean it ourselves.  They did not apologize nor showed any signs that they care.  This is the kind of experience that I expect in a ghetto restaurant.  Goodbye Fancy Chinese cuisine.  You will never see me ever go back there again!"}
{"text":"Good Dim Sum, but not great. The beef balls and the spare ribs in black bean sauce were excellent. The deep fried taro dumplings were on the low end of quality - very low end - barely crispy. The shrimp roll with salad dressing was fun but is sweet enough to be dessert.  The other problem was that the service of the dishes was very slow. For some people at dim sum that's actually a good thing: relaxing on a weekend morning."}
{"text":"All the beef dishes look so amazing. The 4lb lobster is huge, fresh and at amazing prices. I guess that's why there are long line ups everyday. Only downside is the long line ups. The service is also quick.  The ginger flavour lobster lacks taste. The sweet and sour pork I ordered doesn't taste good. The ribs with eggplant are excellent. They also gave complimentary chicken feet soup."}
{"text":"Came here several times for dim sum and dinner. The place can pretty busy (you need to make reservations especially for dinner) and service is decent but at times very slow. Food is good but it's not consistent at times. For dimsum, the price changes accordingly with respect to the day of the week and time you give in your order (menue in pictures). There is a selection of free Chinese newspapers every time you go."}
{"text":"Great Place to Dine. A bit pricer but the food is not bad. A major plus is their washroom is extremely clean...love that!"}
{"text":"Pretty typical Chinese restaurant. Dim sum time is always busy but it's delicious food :) the quality is a bit inconsistent but I've never had a bad experience so I'm going to go ahead and give it the four stars :)  The service is quick and everyone is pretty friendly. It's noisy for the most part but aren't most dim sum places? And it's clean, which I really appreciate. Ha-ha  My recommendation: I love the tofu dessert here!"}
{"text":"Been here a lot since the restaurant opened and finally writing a review.  The food is always consistent every time I come here with family -- we usually come here after 1:30pm on weekends to take advantage of their cheaper dim sum price ($2.88 for S/M/L dishes), and also on evenings.  Generally the set dinners for the weekdays are cheaper than those on the weekends."}
{"text":"HK Dim sum restaurant - Lunch  Speed Read: 1) Good price / value 2) Tofu Dessert 3) Garlic shrimp fried rice 4) Horrible parking  There are lots of dim sum restaurants around the area.  With the exception of a few premium price ones, many value type dim sum places serve garbage, and some time spoiled food on hot summer days.    It's our recent favorite dim sum place.   Dim sum are generally good quality. Average service. Below average price.  2 highlights are the garlic shrimp fried rice and the fresh made tofu dessert (tofu-fa).  Tips: Very hard to find parking!!!!  But if you do find parking, usually the wait for table is not very long."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located at Kennedy and 14th. Parking here is insane because of all the shops, mainly this restaurant. Came here for my grandfathers 80th birthday, honestly nothing really special.  The back room felt really cramped, there were around 20-25 of us and when we asked the waiters questions like what food was coming (because it was pre-ordered with the reservation) they had no clue.  The food was below average. The lobster barely had any meat in it, BBQ pork wasn't that great and really dry. What did taste good was a creamy soup with some corn in it. Other than that, everything was either average or below par.  I didn't have a chance to have a dim sum experience here but so far, it's not looking good.  2/5."}
{"text":"Ready for bad service? I am currently sitting in the restaurant right now and have never experienced such horrible service before. This will be the first time i ever leave without tipping and we are now no longer regulars here.   1) our lettuce wraps came significantly later than our other dishes.   2) the Peking duck carrots had dirt spots on them.  3) our appetizer soup came after the first course.  4) we ordered our dessert before another table (dessert soup and pastries). The table behind us ordered their dessert about 5-10 minutes after us and they got their dessert and the last of the pastries. My guest inquired with a server and the server actually WAVED her off and said, \"it's coming.\" Another 10 minutes later and it clearly was not coming so again, we again called over the same server, and told her that the table behind us ordered after us and got dessert before us. The stubborn and rude server said, \"it's not dessert, it's the soup.\" Until we insisted its dessert and only then did she say, \"ok, you're right.\" Of course at that point they didn't have any more pastries."}
{"text":"Fancy is always a popular place for consistent food and value. It is pretty much always fully booked for dinners and long waits for lunch hour dim sum - make sure to make a reservation to slightly decrease wait time.   I would recommend the shrimp rice for dim sum.. it's a really big portion for about $8. The tofu dessert is quite good for a large group at $4/bucket. Other dim sum are pretty standard. Radish cake is very nicely pan fried. Alot of the fried rice dishes are good too. The one thing I don't like is the steamed egg yolk bun - it's really runny and orangey-yellow with bits of duck egg yolk.  For dinner, I really like the complementary daikon/yellow bean soup! For dessert, they give tofu dessert (the best), black sesame dessert (slightly runny, but not too bad) or green/red bean. The green onion fried chicken and gai lan was pretty good - bit oily, but crisp and sweet.  Also good: Lobster, tofu/shrimp and many choices on the combo menu."}
{"text":"My favourite Chinese restaurant. Super packed though. Be prepared to wait without a reservation"}
{"text":"Reasonable and good price for dim sum. Good quality and not too much MSG or too salty unlike most dim sum places. Order before 11:30am for discounts. Call them to book reservations and get a number before you come. Will come back again :)"}
{"text":"I've only been to Fancy for dim sum so the review will be based on my dim sum consumption experiences.  FOOD The food is authentic and well seasoned. The fried dishes are made well and doesn't taste bitter (which is one indicator that they use fairly fresh frying oil). The rice in a pot is on the drier side so I tend to avoid getting that unless my party asks for it.   SERVICE The wait times can be pretty outrageous, I've waited for over an hour before on a weekend and it seemed pretty normal. You get a free issue of that days newspaper (in chinese of course). The serving time for the food varies, if they have a lot of people waiting for tables, it seems like the food comes out from the kitchen much faster. The servers are really attentive and will refill your tea and water when it is empty! You just need to lift the lid of the pot to the side and that signals to them that it needs a refill.  Will visit again? - ya :) got to take advantage of the $2.88 dim sum deal before 11:30AM."}
{"text":"I have heard many great things about this restaurant and wanted to try it. I finally did and it met my expectations of what it should be. Fancy Chinese Cuisine demonstrates what Authentic Chinese Cuisines is about but has a few flaws that stop it from being one of the best in Markham. The restaurant decor is nice but really nothing special about it. The servers are attentive and will always be as helpful as possible. We ordered the four course dinner (Lobster, stir fried bak choy, etc with rice)  and the dishes were very flavorful. However, some of the dishes we ordered were bland and overcooked. Overall, this restaurant is a very good and I recommend this to anyone looking for a Chinese place to eat at. I rate this 4 stars out of five. If you have any feedback or questions, please feel free to ask."}
{"text":"March 11, 2018 My three friends and I went to Fancy for dim sum at 1pm *call ahead and book* it was very busy. Some ppl didn't call and they had to wait (they got there seat when we were almost finished eating ) but it is a nice place to go. We ordered steamed sticky rice roll  *i really liked it*, shrimp dumpling (har gow), shrimp and chives  ** sorry I don't remember the other names, but they tasted good also. It is a good place to go, just remember to call ahead.. the tofu dessert was delicious"}
{"text":"The quality of the dim sum and specials is good here. Everything comes piping hot which I really appreciate. The dim sum is ordered from a paper form with English translation, which makes it convenient for the non-fluent Chinese readers. The specials are good value, with large dishes of rice to fill hungry stomachs fast. I would recommend the seafood rice or the chicken rice which comes wrapped in a large leaf that gets cut open in front of you.  The only minus is the really bad parking outside. It's a nightmare to park especially during the meal rush hours. It drives me crazy just to park my car here. Definitely not enough spaces."}
{"text":"Tasty dim sum overall. The only issue is that service can be quite slow, even compared to other Chinese establishments. Come here early in the day.. line up can be long."}
{"text":"Food was good, order the Peking Duck and added 5 bucks to have it serve lettuce wrap as the 2nd option. The problem is that there were not a lot of duck meat served so should had gone with regular style which is cut up roast duck style. Oh well, next time we will be wiser in the decision."}
{"text":"First off, weekday dimsum is cheap (where all dishes are one price) between 8:30am-11:30am and then between 1:30-3:30pm. Their dim sum is pretty good. Their TOFU dessert is the best i've ever had anywhere!! You're gonna have to arrive early in order to get a seat. Try to sit near the back because the restaurant is pretty chilly. They give you a list of dim sum to choose from and you just mark off what you want and hand it in. Every now and then, they'll have carts being pushed with some desserts, etc.   For the price and the quality of the food, this dim sum place is here to stay. The service is definitely not the best. We had a couple of grumpy looking waitresses that served us."}
{"text":"The food here is tastier compared to most chinese restaurants in markham.  You have to call at least a month ahead of time if you want to reserve a large table (10+ ppl) for fri-sun dinner.  Their lunch dimsum is also really good here. Great selection and all size dishes charge as a small dish price if you place your orders before a certain time (12:30 or 1pm) i can't rem but it's indicated on the menu."}
{"text":"We had a simple weeknight dinner here.  We didn't have a big group, so we didn't take advantage of the set dinner menu.  We ordered a Spicy and Pickled Fish Fillets ($14) and a Green Beans Stir Fry ($12).  Both were bold in flavours.  Some might find them too salty, but we love salty.  The ingredients of both were average fresh.  The portion was average.  The pricing was middle of the road.  I have been to places where similar dishes would be cheaper or more expensive, so I suppose if you look for a deal, al carte is not the way to go here.    Service was average and in line with Chinese restaurants of the same level.  As far as al carte dinner goes, Fancy is 3.0 out of 5.0 on my book."}
{"text":"We have been here on several occassions for both dimsum and dinner. For the most part the food is usually good and so is the prices. We have some slight inconsistency with the food, but overall worth going back to. My rating would have been a 4 but the server today was terrible to the point that she was rude. Hoping for a better experience on our next visit."}
{"text":"Once every week, my mum and grandfather have dim sum and go grocery shopping. This is the place where they go for dim sum. When I am available, I get to go too! Yay!  The dim sum here is consistently decent, my grandparents have never complained about the quality of the food, although some days, some dishes may seem smaller or less than usual, I guess it depends on the chef.  If you come here before 11:30am, all of dim sum dishes (except ones marked \"special\") are the same price.   The staff are very friendly, especially once you've become a regular, you'll arrive as if you're seeing some old friends. The main seating area seats a large number of tables in various sizes, they also have a private room area which has tables to seat smaller groups, which they open up when it gets super busy.  Along with dim sum, you also get a complimentary copy of the Chinese newspaper. It's not much, but it's better than having to pay for it or having to find it somewhere else.  It hasn't been too busy when we go, but they do take reservations, so keep their number handy and give them a call when you've decided you're heading there that day, or even if you call them up to let them know you and your party are on your way there, they'd put you in the queue and you'll likely have a table all set by the time you get there without too much of a wait (if they're busy). Their busy days, as with most dim sum places, are likely Saturday and Sundays.  So don't spend all your time waiting and give them a call!"}
{"text":"I have trouble deciding if this place is a 3 star or 4 star... it is ok for a Chinese restaurant but not great. However, it is one of the better Chinese places - I find a lot are not consistent or too oily/salty. This restaurant also recently increased their prices so I do not find it a good deal anymore. The parking lot has limited spots and sometimes you have to wait in line for a table. However, it is my to-go to restaurant in the area. I usually get the Peking Duck combo and they carve the duck right in front of you. Pretty nice touch and it was decent. However, I find some of the other dishes to be mediocre - it can be a hit or miss. I didn't really like the stir fried clams as they use cherry clams and didn't cook the clams thoroughly. The veggies seem pre-boiled with sauce poured on top instead of stir fried. But some other dishes seemed good like the lobster."}
{"text":"So many great choices. Glad that we had a large group to order a bunch of dishes to try. The favorite was steam egg custard with lobster roe, perfect smooth Cooked just right, tasty dish to go with white rice. The second favorite was the salt egg with bitter melon, a specialty that you don't find in too many restaurant. braised whole duck, spare ribs, tofu with cod fish,fry noodles with seafoods and snow pea leaves are all delicious! Service was good. Great dinning experience especially when the check comes, so inexpensive, such a bargain for a great meal!"}
{"text":"My family comes here fairly often for dim sum and the quality of the food is consistent and generally good. Go in the morning (around 9) to avoid the lineups and the parking situation, and to get the special prices. Service is as expected from a Chinese restaurant - quick and to the point.  After 12 you can get the lunch dishes which are quite good as well! We are a fan of the thick noodles (ho fun) in satay/black bean sauce. Dinner is also decently priced and good quality, though we haven't been in a while. Overall, this place is a solid choice for any meal of the day."}
{"text":"Love the dim sum here. Most items are ordered through a menu but sometimes they bring out items on the traditional push cart like the tofu custard/pudding dessert. It comes in a really cool wood box and is a must have when you come here. When ordered off the menu everything comes freshly made. Everything tasted very good here and one of my other favorites was also the egg yolk custard bun. The bun itself is a light orange color and if you like sweet stuff like me then you will love this bun."}
{"text":"We ordered 12 dim sum dishes so we can have a nice variety of dishes.  Taste: The dishes were very average. I definitely had better dim sum dishes at other Chinese restaurants in the GTA. You can tell that they tried to use cheaper ingredients to make their dishes. They used more flour in the turnip cake dish than turnips. In the congee with meat and seafood, there were very few pieces of seafood (very small pieces of octopus and maybe one piece of scallop) and meat (I think the meat was just pig skin). When you look at it without stirring it, it looks like plain congee.   Authenticity: The dishes that they offer are typical dishes that you will generally find at any dim sum places.   Atmosphere: The restaurant was pretty clean with simple decorations.  Service: The servers spoke Cantonese and understood English. The service was really good. You can easily get the attention of the servers and they will fulfill your request fairly quickly.  Price and payment: We went during the morning tea special so all the dishes were $2.98 each. They wrote the time that you placed the order of the food on the piece of paper. I think it is to make sure that they charge you the correct price when you pay the bill. They accept credit cards but you have to take the bill and pay at the front.   Overall experience: I grew up eating a lot of dim sum with my family in Canada and Asia. I understand that I will not get the same taste of dishes as those in Asia so my review is based on my experience with dim sum in Canada. Even with this standard, I would say that this restaurant is very average. If we come back to this restaurant, it would be for the price and not the taste."}
{"text":"Quality has sure gone down in the last couple of years. I came for dim sum and dinner during the Chinese New Year season. Not only did food quality go down, but their service was quite slow.  Staff: The food is so slow now. It took over an hour for most of our dim sum dishes to come and our last dish (chicken buns) took a little under two hours. The staff weren't really clearing dishes and they kept piling up. For dinner service, it was near impossible to find someone to place our order and then throughout the night no one refilled out tea pots.   Food: For dim sum, all the deep fried stuff tasted burnt and were very hard. At dinner the meats were all very overcooked and tough. The cha shu was notably the worst. Nothing was good for either meals.  Overall, still not the absolute worst, but we definitely cancelled another reservation due to the poor service and food."}
{"text":"Wasn't planning on eating out again tonight, but last minute invite and there we were. We have been here many times. Quality of the food is high and prices are very reasonable. Food is served family style and it comes fast and furious. Service is about quickly jamming the dishes in and speeding away. Solid 3.  Tonight I didn't sample everything. We had a lot of food for six adults and three small children. Lots of leftovers Ubiquitous soup of the day Peking duck with pancakes and lettuce wraps - always good 1/2 chicken with crispy skin and garlic - yummy Tofu and broccoli - the tofu was amazing Beef with Chinese greens - tasty Deep fried squid and deep fried green beans - I passed on this. Apparently it was bland Stir fried shrimp - delicious Clams in black bean sauce - pedestrian apparently. I did not try as I'm not a fan Tofu and red bean soup - apparently the tofu was very good. I was too full. Cookies which were not appealing enough to try."}
{"text":"I like this dimsum place.  I would have given a 4.5 but there are no halvsies.  Great dimsum. Great service.  Downside...the wait for seating on the weekend. The line is out the door when you go at peak times.  11am is the latest you should arrive if you dont want to wait long.  They dont take reservations.  Wouldn't mind doing take out from here in the future."}
{"text":"I have been here many times over and my family have always enjoyed the experience here. I would say this has become my parent's default place for family dinners whenever they come to Toronto to visit me and my sister, especially when we can't make up our minds as to where to have dinner. Everything about this restaurant is just awesome - service, atmosphere, portions, food quality, and price. We always leave happy and satisfy.   They have set dinners or you can order from their regular menu. We normally come here for dinner, we haven't tried their dim sum service yet. But then again, we don't generally dim sum too much. We generally order a set dinner and add other dishes if needed. I really like their Peking Pork Chops (I know the Chinese name better but can't seem to type Chinese ..... so this may not be their English name for the dish...). Their steam fish is really good too. I also like their desert that comes with the dinner service - you get a choice from red bean sweet soup, mung bean sweet soup, and sweet tofu desert. Their desert is always not too sweet (I don't like overly sweet Chinese deserts or overly sweet desert in general).   The only draw back of the location of this restaurant is their parking lot. Their parking lot is small..... so if you coming in a group, carpool if you can. I would also make reservations if you are a large group for dinner."}
{"text":"I now frequent this place for dimsum. Busy place so make sure to call ahead of time for reservation. Good quality dimsum and served mostly what we usually order. Food always come fresh and hot as you preorder it first. Servers are are nice, attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"Review is only based on Dim Sum during lunch on Saturday. The food is alright, a few hits and misses but nothing tasted bad. The radish cake was very cakey, there's way too much flour in the recipe so it wasn't that great. The dough fritter cheung fun was good. Dough fritter remained crispy and it wasn't too oily. The mango + osmanthus cake was the highlight. It wasn't too sweet and not too \"hard\".   Service was average at first, didn't expect much anyways. We were sitting inside the room so there's 2 specific waitresses to look after the room. It wasn't a huge room so the service was alright and quick. As I was still eating I noticed one of the waitresses pushed the cart full of dirty plates right next to me. It didn't bother me since I know she was going to move it away after she's done cleaning a nearby table or something. Right? Boy was I wrong. She left it there! I wasn't sitting near the corner or oddly seated. I was sitting at the 3rd table which is pretty much the middle. It was odd because there were no tables leaving and she just leaves it there for no reason at all. So I told her to move it, she looked like a deer in headlights. She eventually complied and didn't say anything but after 10 minutes she moves it back to where it was! Right next to me while I'm still eating. No tables were leaving and she didn't need the cart for cleaning. Who does that?!  I probably wouldn't be back, or next time I'll make sure I'm not sitting inside the room?"}
{"text":"Reservations for dinner are a must, this place seems to be fully booked every single Friday and Saturday night since they opened!  The food here is reasonably priced and consistent quality. We usually come here as a family and order the combos where you have soup, the option of peking duck or lobster, along with your choice of 3, 4, 5+ other side dishes such as sweet and sour pork, steamed egg, clams, veggies, chicken, etc.  The dessert options are always a choice of tofu, red bean or sesame.  This place is maintained quite well for somewhere that is so busy, the service is generally prompt and portions are decent. They also serve dimsum but I seldom come so far!"}
{"text":"Fancy Chinese Cuisine is the single biggest reason why this plaza is known as one of the worst parking plazas on Markham.  Ever since they've opened shop here the parking is completely swamped and crowded especially during lunch and dinner.    Why?  Cause they offer solid Chinese food for dim sum in the mornings/afternoon and solid Cantonese style fare at night.  Unlike most dim sum places that are only busy for dim sum, Fancy is equally busy at night as their set menus offers fantastic value and flexibility.    We've been going on and off for years and have pretty much always been satisfied with the food served here.  Food is made to order fresh, served promptly and delicious!  What more can you want?   Well, maybe better parking!  Haha!  Solid 4/5!"}
{"text":"First off - PARKING in this place is absolutely insane! The restaurant is located in a tiny little plaza where there is limited parking.  The overflow ended up at the Mr Sub next door but then I was chased by him because I was using his customer parking (fine fair enough). I ended up further away at a pizza pizza by the next traffic light which was a short walk over but come on! I want to park where Im eating people!!  I would make reservations.  I think I was there at prime time for eating (Sat night at 8:00pm) there was a lineup out the door.  Although the restuarant is basically at full capacity - the staff are quick to get the ball rolling.  I would suggest if you are not asian (like myself) that you have an asian friend or crowd with you - the 'specials' are basically in chinese so if you want the english menu you're probably getting riped off.   I had 9 people in my party and we ordered from the special chinese menu. We had 6 dishes plus 2 desserts.  The bill came to roughly $112 which ended up being $15/person.  The food came quickly and hot.  In all we had - 2 dishes with duck, pineapple chicken, soup broth, BBQ ribs, lobster, fried porkchop, seseme sessert (like black soup lol) and the tofu looking soup with sweet syrup.  I was pretty stuffed and there was plenty of food to go around.   I would say I have had better chinese food - but I would like to try their Dim Sum since everyone on here seems to rave about it.  I will definetely go here again however maybe at a different time.  However I suppose it's good to walk off your meal :P"}
{"text":"One of the best places ever! The  value is substituted for their quality of their food. Here is a list of what we got.   Peking duck- They will bring out a cart with the whole duck and they will then carve it in front of you on a plate. It has very crispy skin not fatty. It felt like I was eating at a banquet. Delicious!   Stir fry beef- Awesome! It melts in your mouth and you can taste the vibrant flavors.   Maggie sauce shrimp- tasty! had no complaints.  Sweet and sour fish- It had the right ratio of sweet and sour mixed together with deep fried fish. Great.   lettuce cup with duck-when the flavors mixed together, the taste was balanced and delicious.   Tofu dessert- Sweet but not too sweet. I could tell there is a little hint of ginger. It was a pleasant dessert.    Overall, I think this is a great restaurant with lots of potential. I hope to come again soon!"}
{"text":"They do serve fancy food here at reasonable price. It is way better than the Magic Wok just down the road. The servers are friendly, but the place is so popular, it would be better to reserve and eat at the 5:30 sitting. If you want \"normal\" sitting during the weekend, you will need to book at least two weeks ahead. If you want you eat there during any special weekend, then you should reserve at least a month ahead. I'm not kidding you."}
{"text":"Came here for a baby's 100 day celebration. The food overall was very good.  Service was ....ummm def had better. The waiter was polite but had little experience hence no clue what he was doing. Often times he would forget to serve the food for us. Or served more to others that some of us had nothing left (me!). First course (the pig)...I love my jellyfish but there was none left for me :( I almost didn't get a crab claw (2nd course) until my FIL spoke up.   The rest of the dishes were good and warm (yummm lobster... veggies....soup etc). Def. alright & a good place to bring a big family or relatives. The sweet tofu dessert was very well made. So soft and yummy. I also liked the green tea biscuits.   Washroom was clean :)"}
{"text":"Low prices and delicious dim sum!!!  This is my go to place for dim sum. I've never felt that any dish I ordered tasted bad, the quality of all of them are very decent. It's also one of the much cheaper dim sums I've gone to which makes it really worthwhile.   the only problem with this location is that their parking lot in the plaza is quite small and sometimes it's a hassle to find parking."}
{"text":"The line up here for weekend dim sum is massive!  We talking about out the door massive.  Luckily we were here for a friend's birthday and a private room was booked for our party so we didn't have to wait.   Phew!  Dodged that bullet.   Fancy is your typical Chinese dim sum place with the typical minimal decor and serving up the usually suspects like ha Gau and Sui mai etc.  Nothing fancy (no punt intended) or creative like some of its competitors however you are also not paying $2 for one piece of Har Gau either. The food tasted quite decent and dishes were served swiftly.  The service was sufficient for Chinese restaurant standards.   Overall a good experience but I would really recommend making reservations to avoid long waiting times."}
{"text":"Great Food, Great Service, Food comes very prompt but it does get hectic when it is busy."}
{"text":"Never had a bad experience with this place. It's typical of everything you'd expect in an authentic Cantonese place. Servers work hard (but may not be the most polite and that's okay) and food tastes good. Ambiance is basic and acceptable. You get what you pay for. If you want a dim sum fix at a reasonable, this place will satisfy. Prices are cheaper before 11am on weekends."}
{"text":"Between 1130-130 the prices are a bit more SP $3.98 L $3.88 M $3.28 S $2.88  But if you were to go between 830-1130 and 130-4 all dimsum is $2.88 so make sure you go during these times!!!  We bought 12 items for 2 people and it cost us just under $40. And obviously couldn't finish all of it, so plenty of leftover for dinner.   Make sure to come early or book a table because it gets really busy.  Staff is great, they're constantly around so you can always flag one down."}
{"text":"Dim Sum review Pretty good for quality and price. I missed the early bird price (before 11am) but the regular price wasn't extreme either like at some other places.  Parking seems difficult here as the plaza is busy during meal times. Ask for a number from hostess to wait to be seated, they will call out in Cantonese, so if you need help let them know you need English, as my husband had one job and forgot what 42 was so she kept calling and staring at him!  The dim sum menu is ordered off a paper, no carts wheeling around cold food, except the dessert cart which is covered in a clear shell.   Not much English from servers but they were all friendly and quick to refill tea and clear dishes. I asked for Chrysanthemum Tea(gook fa cha) instead, it's really nice and floral.  Lots of shrimp in the har gow, the rice wrapping had a good sticky chew. The lotus wrap sticky rice was really good, infused flavour from leaf, stuffed full of various meats(Chinese sausage chunk, ground pork, chicken and shiitake mushroom). I'm a shrimp fan at dim sum, so got the shrimp roll and dumpling just to be safe, both were hot and crispy. Ordered a special dish, The Crab Claw, and it was very fresh like you'd get at a wedding dinner.   Would come back again, it did not disappoint.   Washrooms are decent and it's to the right of the bar/kitchen, not left of the front entrance."}
{"text":"Oh you fancy, huh?  We were trolling Markham for a dinner place when I remembered Fancy.  We had been here once before about a year ago, when reservations were needed about a week in advance and there was still a 20 min. wait for a table.  On this particular Monday night though, we were able to stroll in sans reservation around 8pm and get a table for four with ease.  We decided to go with the set dinner for 4 ($53.95) which included our choice of a main like lobster, bass, crab, etc and then 3 other dishes.  We chose lobster, beef with bak choi, deep fried salt and pepper fish and half a crispy chicken.  Dinner started with complimentary house soup and then our dishes arrived quickly after.  Lobster was good with impressive meaty pieces.  Beef and bak choi, a bit on the greasy side and bak choi cooked pretty al dente but I prefer it this way.  Salt and pepper fish...so salty, so satisfying.  Crispy chicken, just crispy like it's namesake.  Portion sizes were good and along with 3 bowls of rice, it was just enough food for the four of us (no leftovers).  Dessert was a choice of red/green bean soup or warm tofu (tofu faa), and a few cookies.  Other tables got sesame balls but we did not.  Service was not bad.  Wait staff had a sense of humour and were efficient at taking away empty plates and lobster shells.  And how could you not love those flashing neon name tags?  Just when I thought the service industry couldn't introduce any more flair.  They don't take VISA so cash is probably preferred.  We'll be back if we're in the 'hood again."}
{"text":"I want to give it 3.5. Parking can be challenging like most ppl mentioned on Yelp. Came here on a Sat at around 10:50am and waited about 30 mins for 2 ppl. There were a lot of ppl waiting (mostly 4-6 ppl groups waiting). I dont know exactly the pricing but I think its what the other mentioned here if you ORDERED before 11:30am on weekend all Small, medium and large dishes are $3.00. Tea charge i think was $1.40 per person which is quite pricey in my opinion. The food taste good for the price. Milk custart tart was good but wish it was hotter because it was just luke warm. Wil come back to try othet dishes."}
{"text":"Here's the thing. If you do not make a reservation, be prepared to wait an hour (like I did, on a Sunday morning), being surrounded by a crowd of hungry, angry, & usually fobby older asian parents/grandparents.   The hostess has the worst system of seating people - first she will give you a number and call you when a table opens up that seats your specific amount of people.  For example, even if I came in before table #65, they might get a seat first because a table of 8 has opened up and I only have 4 people in my party.  Therefore, don't get upset if you think they're randomly calling numbers.  The dim sum here is yummy.  They have these little time discounts, so for example: eating before 11:30AM is cheaper than eating from 11:30AM-1PM, and it becomes cheaper again from 1-4PM (check the pictures).  There are small, medium, large, and special; all different prices.  This is completely worth it for a lot of the dishes, especially the steamed pot rice - it is literally $3 for a pot of rice with beef ribs and a chicken claw. Yuuuuuuum. Everything else is very average with 0 complaints.  They serve you within the first 10 minutes of you ordering .. but there is a very slow trickle of your food at the end. I waited and extra 10 minutes for the curry squid.  You have to double check what you order because they do tend to forget items sometimes.  Overall, make your reservations and come enjoy a nice Chinese dim sum meal with your fam :)"}
{"text":"Food always comes out fresh and good.   Other than the stank a$$ look that one China women host always gives lol.   They have a good deal $2.88 for all size dishes from 1-4   wait is usually under 10 minutes   I recommend only because I'll be back again since its affordable but the drive already takes up most my gas $$ haha"}
{"text":"We visited the restaurant on a Saturday morning around 930am, already busy and was given a number to be waited. Took about 10 mins for the wait... The food came quite fast as we ordered almost 11 items for 3 people. The dim sum qualities weren't terrible, taste pretty much like regular dim sum at most places. The most interesting dish was the Chiu Chow style beef ball- 4 beef balls in a bowl of soup. The soup was quite tasteless, and the beef balls were not as flavorful as regular steamed beef balls.   Overall, prices were descend, not too too bad for the early bird price ($3.28 S, M, L dishes) and the discount valid Mon-Sun until 1130am (except public holidays). The atmosphere of the restaurant reminded me of the ones in HK. I will come back again when I am around that area."}
{"text":"Toronto people, you are all so lucky w/ a place like this.  When I read some of the reviews, it just goes to show how \"petty\" some Yelpers can be.  C'mon, complaining about long wait, efficient but less than polite service when the place is packed/turned over 8-10 times a day?  I almost bet these Yelpers have never worked a real job that requires some sweat and wits to get thru the day (try standing on your feet 10 hrs straight serving over 2000 people during the entire time).  Fancy is many notches above the typical good tasting restaurants in this ultra competitive city.  If Fancy migrated to NYC Flushing, FORGET about getting a seat unless you slip an envelope of cash to the manager (Andrew Jackson or above), that's how good this place is in my opinion.    Food quality:  10 Stars. Price:  5 Stars plus (10 Stars if outside of Toronto due to competition/comparison locally) Service:  Good enough for the pace.  Truthfully, anyone who lounges around and not eating quickly and go home should get bad service so the next person can have seating to enjoy. Ambiance:  Simple decor but aesthetically pleasing.  Look at the geometry and spacing, some Feng Shui in action here boys n girls.... Details:  Yes, all about details in the whole shebang.  Dim Sum, snacks, main dishes, fancy food, street like food, dessert, nothing disappoints.  No waste at all, this place is like an elegant machine that just keeps on churning out high quality eats.  Any newbies who hasn't tried this place, ignore the negative reviews.  Take it from someone who has eaten 000's of roast ducks, 000's of lobsters/scallops/, 000's of live fish/Geoduck/fresh Abalone, giant scallops, live prawns.  This place is too awesome to pass up if your #1 priority is good tasting Cantonese food.    Only thing you will not find here are those odd ball dishes made w/ funny parts of animals or insects, which can be delicious too, but not main stream enough to warrant them as menu items.  You know, inner parts mixed into the Dim Sum dish, funny herbal body parts soup, fried insects or worms, etc.  And yes, I tried them a few times too, just proves I don't pass up any potential culinary experience for my taste buds."}
{"text":"Fancy is still a great place to eat.  Prices have gone up since I last recall so I deducted a star.  We had Peking Duck, Lobster, Fish with Tofu, Beef and Choi, Pork Chop With Peking Sauce, and Shrimp with Maggie Sauce.  All were pretty good.  Service was not bad.  Dinner came with soup and dessert.  All in all, a good meal."}
{"text":"Finally, Finally, I got to order the special set meal I been wanting to try!  Our table has some disagreement on either lobster or crab... but crab wins!!  And we have more disagreement on what to order as the 3 other dishes from the set menu.... But all I care was I going to have my crab!!  The XO sauce was spiced by real fresh Thai chili! While my dinner mates were in tears, I saved them by eating all the chili and most of the crab!  - Sweet and Sour Fish Fillet - Chinese Broccoli with Beef - Fish Fillet with King Mushroom  I guess they all tasted not bad as my dinner mate finished most of them while I busy eating my crab.  3 choices for dessert... and I got to try them all too!!  The only complaint is they ran out of the complimentary soup of the day!  With 10% discount our bill came out to be $53 with taxes!"}
{"text":"Seafood: excellent. Everything else: mediocre or bad.  We had a Cantonese banquet-style dinner of about 15 dishes. The shrimp was among the best we've ever had. The special grouper (not sure the proper name of the fish) was soft, succulent, and insanely delicious.   The non-seafood dishes were one disappointment after another. From lettuce wraps (\"san choi bao\") to Beijing duck to simple stir fried vegetables (\"bok choi zai\"), every one of them was broken in one way or another. The lettuce wraps duck meat was overcooked and too crunchy to chew, the veg dishes smothered in oil and rendered nearly inedible.  Go for the seafood, skip the rest."}
{"text":"This place is more legit than any restaurant in Chinatown. I was the only Gweilo in the whole place, I felt like Chris Tucker in \"Rush Hour 2\"; that's when you know it's legit.  PRO TIP: Go there with a Chinese friend, they seem to have a secret menu which can only be unlocked by someone you can read Chinese."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good though I would recommend going to different places on the area. It is very clean and the selection is plenty but what I really don't like is their special pricing from 8 am to 11:30. The advertisement states that everything is $2.88 but we were charged one dish at $4. As well as the sheet of paper wrote free tea but we were charged for tea too! Everything that should have been $25 ish became $35 which js expensive for a dim sum place. The service was amazing though, they would come by and walk around, offer us more tea and very politely add items when requested!   There definitely places in the area for a lot cheaper! That said, they do make really good dim sum! I do miss the mango fried rolls though which is not on the menu this time.   If I'm really craving for the same taste and service, I would definitely come back but being wearily of what I will order."}
{"text":"One of my favourite go to dim sum places! Been here countless times for mostly dim sum but their dinner is fantastic as well. It's reasonably priced for good quality dim sum with good service. Compared to cheap places with mediocre dim sum (like Perfect), or expensive places that I'm not really willing to pay for on a weekly basis, Fancy's is a perfect medium. The only downside is parking here - Fancy's is located at a very small and cramped plaza so parking is sometimes difficult.  Came here on a Sunday at 11 with my companion and had to wait about half hour to be seated. Saw some people were able to make reservations beforehand so not sure if that would've shortened our wait time. However, we were seated just in time to catch the flat rate dim sum (before 11:30am) so yay!  You order off a list of items here but there are occasional carts being pushed around (with a plastic cover over them, +10 points for hygiene cause how many times have you seen people flip open all the dim sum steamers before picking one out??).   Ordered about 6 items which was more than enough for 2 and only cost ~$30 - my companion and I were stuffed! Along with your dim sum basics (like har gow siu mai), I love that they offer milk tarts which is lighter than your regular egg tarts (but they have that too!). Tofu pudding is also a must here but only if you come with 4+ people as you have to get the entire tub. Lastly, if you're here after 11:30, be sure to order the garlic shrimp fried rice. It comes in a large dim sum steamer (good for ~6 ppl) and although technically a main dish, definitely still worth checking out!  Fancy's will remain as my #1 dim sum spot till I find a similar place with more parking!"}
{"text":"Came here for the early  bird dim sum, and  when i got the bill they charged me the regular rates. Rude wait staff."}
{"text":"\"I'm so fancyyy\" is always playing in my head when I come here. Despite the classy name, it's definitely a regular Chinese dim sum restaurant with a good dinner scene. I've had dim sum many times here over the years, and it's one of my cousins' and I's go-to spot.   I really hate when places try to \"remix\" and \"fusion\" OG dishes like cheurng fun (gonna butcher these names, get ready) har gow, and siu mai, but Fancy is DELICIOUS! They keep it original and has really good size and quality. There is very high priced dim sum places, and very bad places in Markham, Fancy is inbetween. Not breaking the bank, but good quality and price for what you get.  Since I've moved away, I have not been able to visit as much. I 100% know though that Fancy is one of my faves and I recommend it."}
{"text":"Normally don't have any expectations for service at restaurants like this but the service was great here. The staff was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"This is the best place to go for authentic Chinese food. There is usually a line up for dim sum but definitely worth the wait. The staff are all extremely friendly and attentive! The service is really fast, we never wait long for our food to come. The food is delicious especially the seafood rice and tofu dessert which are signature dishes at the restaurant - used with high quality ingredients and does NOT taste like MSG. Price is very reasonable for the portions are food you get. I would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"TLDR: Quality of service has certainly got worse throughout the years. But food still tastes decent.  My family and I always come here for dinner, and sometimes for their dimsum. The dimsum food seems to have got worse since the last time I came (cold food, slow service, portions smaller). For my update, I came here with my family on a Sunday night. Don't forget to book in advance, they don't take want walk ins, especially on weekends. Service was terrible, we were seated, and no one attended to us, we didn't even get our tea until we asked twice.. the boss walks around and does nothing, maybe that's what he's suppose to do? But honestly, if you're not going to attend to us, find someone that will! We literally sat there for 10 minutes trying to get someone's attention (which failed), then  we got up to ask someone to take our order... sad, I really liked coming here... but the service is just simply, terrible.  Also, for years, during dinner time, we would get to pick our dessert (tofu pudding, red bean or black sesame), but this time, we didn't get to pick, we were given watered down red bean soup..."}
{"text":"As one who frequents chinese food restaurant I understand it's not about service. But if doesn't mean they can be rude and condescending. Food itself was not bad.  Most dishes were quite salty. Lobster slightly over cooked. Fish and crispy chicken were good."}
{"text":"Four of us went on Sat 2013-09-14 for dim sum. As usual, you have to go early and wait for a table. The cost for four of us (without any alcohol) was $41.66 (incl HST) + tips.  The food was good. However, we suspect 2 of the dishes we ordered were forgotten. One dish (a rice in a pot with Chinese sausage) came out in 1h20m. We were told it takes 1h00m to come out. The rice was mildly warm, not hot.  Most dishes have to be ordered from a list. They were priced according to small, medium, large.  Some dishes were pushed around on a cart. We chose a colourful dessert. See my 2 photos for the dessert."}
