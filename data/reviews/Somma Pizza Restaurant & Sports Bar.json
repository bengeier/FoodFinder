{"text":"We are regular customers and are always pleased with the food, service and friendly staff! When planning a surprise 60th birthday party for my husband we knew it would be at Sommas!  They reserved the bar side for us, rearranged the tables for food and made everyone feel welcome! As expected the food, drinks and service were excellent! Everyone had a great time and it was a memory we will never forget ! Thanks Mark, Susan and all of the Sommas staff...you're the best!"}
{"text":"VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THE SERVICE AT SOMMA PIZZA!   I recently bought a groupon for somma pizza, in Verona PA!  the groupon deal was either for take out or dine in.....The was the groupon was set up, was very mis-leading.....Once i bought the groupon, i paid $13 for 2 - 16\" pizza for take-out and in the Fine print -  it read, dine-in value only for $20.     Went to dinner with a date,  he was paying, but i provided the waitress with groupon, she immediately said, this is for take-out only....I said, please read the fine print and of course she wouldnt, but she proceeded to get the manager/owner.....The manager was extremely rude, wouldnt even look at the groupon and rufused to honor the $20 groupon deal.........and said it was for take-out only............The waitress came back to table and said i could use it for $13 off my order.......  and showed me the dine in groupon, as to make a fool out of me......... I left the restaurant, very disappointed and contacted groupon immediately.....Groupon responded back within 12 hours and said they are handling this matter, they asked me to provide my phone number, so the restaurant can contact me..........Its been 1 week now, and still no phone call from the restaurant......... I will not go back to Somma PIzza..........the food is nothing special and the management sucks!!!"}
{"text":"A great spur-of-the-moment stop on the way into Oakmont. We sat outside on the patio, and it was the perfect warm day for it. The staff was incredibly friendly and attentive. We ordered a grilled chicken salad and a cheese pizza. The salad was a mix of iceberg and romaine, with awesome fries (not greasy at all) and fresh, flavorful grilled chicken. Large portion. The house dressing was a ranch that was one of the better we have had. Would have loved a house balsamic to try. The pizza was also great, they obviously use more than one type of cheese and quality ones at that. Did I mention we had all of that for around $20?!  I do second what another poster said- the interior seemed somewhat unclean and certainly outdated. But the food, value and service exceeded our expectations, and the patio seating only added to the experience."}
{"text":"Four of us (2 couples) used to go here on Sat nights for beers and pub food. Staff was usually friendly and efficient, sometimes not, depending on who was there. That said, the pizza is ho-hum at best. They call it a pizza place when it is actually a bar/restaurant that happens to serve pizza. Crust is so-so, canned mushrooms and sauce. Steak salad uses Steak-umms. Frozen shoestring fries. Just plain mediocre, for what you spend. And what you spend is considerably more than what you get.  Not worth $70+tip."}
{"text":"Love this place! Been coming here for years! Amazing atmosphere and great food. Highly recommend the buffalo chicken wrap!!"}
{"text":"The food here has always been good. They make an awesome white pizza. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because the place is outdated. I always see dust and the walls need painted."}
{"text":"My fiance and I were in the mood for wings, so we searched the Pittsburgh area for a Thursday wing special.  After some google magic we decided on Somma.  We arrived and the parking lot was full, a good sign.  The inside was clean, smoke free, and we were greeted immediately.  Our waitress was nice as could be, chatty, and quick with our drinks and food.  Somma was just what we were looking for that night.  The price was right, easy parking, friendly service and a good atmosphere.  The next time we get a hankering for wings we know where to go!"}
{"text":"the food was good, but the change machine in the arcade is rigged I put in a two dollar bill and I got one quarter back very disappointed"}
{"text":"Good place to watch a game and eat some decent food. We usually get pepperoni rolls for a appetizer. They have the typical sports bar menu with some specialty pizzas and they don't shortchange you on the toppings. And the beer is always ice cold."}
{"text":"Stopped here with some friends. Nice sports bar atmosphere with some cool stuff hanging up. Ordered some  of wings,seasoned and the Kevin. Kevin wings was a semi wet Cajun hot rub sauce. They was very good. Also ordered the buffalo chicken dip which was also very good. Had some dark side of the moon beers which were poured the correct way. Enjoyed and will be back."}
{"text":"We used to love Somma, but it has really gone down hill.  Service was pretty good, but we went very early (3:45), and there was only one other table occupied so it wasn't like there was a lot of other diner competition for the server's attention.  We had two chicken salads, a half dozen 50 cent wings, and a kid's chicken tender dinner.  The salads were huge and good, though mostly iceberg lettuce (blah).  The chicken tenders were inedible.  We asked for some ranch to dip them in, $.75 extra.  (I think that is the first time we have been charged for dipping sauce for a kid's chicken tenders).  The fries were horrible.  Finally, the wings tasted like fish (we were here during Lent so I assume it was old oil they used).  My wife partially ate one  wing, leaving the rest untouched (glad it was 50 cent night).  Most places usually ask when you leave food basically uneaten, but no inquiry as to whether the wings and chicken tenders were okay.  I honestly hate to rate a place poorly but they just missed the mark everywhere.  And a $49 tab (including $8 gratuity) was just too much for what we got."}
{"text":"Delicious food and friendly local vibe. Menu has a ton of options. Definitely a great spot to grab a bite and a brew!"}
{"text":"We have been going to Somma's since they opened. Everything there is amazing!! I couldn't even pick a favorite! Buffalo chicken pizza, chicken quesadilla, burgers and sweet potato fries are at the top of my list!! I highly recommend Somma's to everyone!"}
{"text":"Dinner was really good tonight. Pizza was perfect, half plain half pepperoni. The kids loved the Italian hoagie & Fries I do think they should have added a little more meat it was very thin, good but thin. I liked the loaded steak & cheese.  Highly recommend and we will return !"}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service. Try the Chicken Pesto pizza! Enjoy watching sporting events on all the TVs."}
{"text":"This is really 3 stars, but I rounded up since it was my first try of Somma's and we tried only one item on the menu: the vegetarian bruschetta pizza. If they keep the same performance next time, assuming there is a next time, I will go down to 3 stars.  We got the pizza for take out. While slightly better than your average chain's pizza, I felt it was still oily and not fresh-tasting. The pizza was cheesy: vegetables were far and few between compared to cheese. The thin crust was OK, but not much distinct from other places. Overall, slightly above average pizza for a slightly high price.   Next time, we might try sitting in to take in some of the sports in the air."}
{"text":"First time visit at Somma 3 weeks ago with a group of 7 ladies. Made a reservation as we were a large party. We were given a table in the.back room, which was perfect for us, however after drinks & appetizers were served we were ignored for over an hour. The group ordered 5 large salads, a Tuna melt sandwich & Chicken Parm dinner. Waitress ignored our table for over an hour while we made several attempts to ask where our dinner orders were. Food was OK....didn't expect anything more than typical bar food....which it was. Waitress informed us that bacon was not crispy & steak was steak-ums on salads. Should have left while trying to order dinner, but will never return to this place!"}
{"text":"It's unfortunate that I have to give this place 1 star.    It's not worth 1 star.  We had a group of folks and the service was atrocious.   It was obvious that the server did NOT want to be there.  The food was very low quality.   Prepackaged reheated food.  Garbage.  The kicker which really ticked me off is the built-in 18% gratuity.   I typically tip 20-25, when deserved of course.  However the server did not deserve 5%.  She didn't care she got her 18%.  I can promise you this, I will never visit this dump again."}
{"text":"I hadn't stopped by in a while.  Its a good place for groups, although the bar area does get packed.  The pizza is definitely good and they apparently make their own ranch for you pizza dipping weirdos (jk, i love you guys, but come on!).  The rest of the menu is good as well, I had the smokehouse chicken sandwich it was tasty.  They get some minus points on their fries, I would love to see a thicker cut.  One other point that would be nice to see is a beer menu.  Although the selection isn't as wide as some of the other local spots but thats not a major deal.  The dining area is great for families, they have a small \"game room\" and lots of booster / high chairs. The women's room has a changing table."}
{"text":"Steak pizza is very good, we have ordered it twice. And they make a perfect rum and coke.  But the burgers tasted bland and were spongy, most certainly frozen patties. And the carbonara used mushy cheap ham in the sauce... yuck. Service was very slow, seems like they were short handed that night.  Fries aren't good either, cold dry shoestring fries.  Our server was friendly, and with some hesitation was able to replace an entree with a pizza."}
{"text":"Have been in several times and always enjoy the food.  kid friendly and wait staff is alway attentive.  It's a pizza place, get the pizza."}
{"text":"Thought this was a pizza joint but it's really a beer joint. It's always crowded about the time we drive by after quitting time.  We ordered a pepperoni and mushroom pizza. Mushrooms were rubbery.  Although service was excellent, we did not finish the pie even after we picked off the shrooms.  Two stars is only for the pizza rating."}
{"text":"I have always loved this place! It is still delicious as always. Sommas has always been one of my favorite places to eat. I loveee their burgers they are the best. The cheese fries, wings, and pizza are really good as well. Definitely would recommend a stop to sommas!"}
{"text":"I have been going here since I was little. I love everything there! Their ranch dressing is also amazing... The downfall for them though is the prices. For example the wedding soup there taste great BUT its almost $4 for a cup .... And its definitely not $4 worthy amount.   Service is also great! I will definitely always go back :)"}
{"text":"Cool, genuine sports bar with a neighborhood bar food.  Excellent pizza, wings and game day drink specials.  Check out there cool colors might mini Stanley souvenir cup tin 18 oz cup for $3!  Very cool tin cup is yours to keep (see photo ) only during Penguins Stanley cup games!  Cool cup!"}
{"text":"Great spot for a quick meal or if you want to hangout a little while, it's great for that too. My husband LOVES the Southwest Chicken Salad and I am currently low carbing it so I've gotten many of their sandwiches w/o bun and they are very accommodating. All have  been delicious so far. I also know the wedding soup is some of the best I've ever had (prior to low carb)...great taste but not too salty like most soups when you get soup at a restaurant. The staff are really friendly and welcoming and Mrs. Somma is usually making the rounds to the tables and checking on everyone. We love going here and can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I've driven past Somma's soo many times and always wanted to stop in.  Well I finally got my shot at it when my son's baseball team had pizza there after a tournament game.  I love pizza so I was excited to see, try, and smell their pizza.    When you first walk in the hostess is right there to greet you.  The bar area is to the right.  It was busy in there and it looked like a nice place to hang out when I don't have my kids with me.  We had a group of probably 10 kids and 10 adults.  They put us all the way in the back.  It was a nice and spacious area with a long table for the kids and 3 round tables for the parents.            They have a little arcade room for the kids that was perfect for them.  They had one of those claw machines that had stuffed animals in it and one that had nice looking bouncy balls for kids in it.  My son and daughter wanted to try to get a ball.  It took them a few times to get it but on their third attempt they both won a ball.  Then I gave them another dollar and they just kept winning.  This claw machine was a big hit for the kids.  It was easy to win and that just makes it so much easier for parents!  The adults ordered drinks.  I didn't have any but the beer selection looked really good.  The parents were having a good old time lol!  The waitress was really nice too.  She was by herself mostly helping us out and she did a great job for such a big group.  Then the pizza finally came out.  It smelled great.  They ordered about 6 different pizzas.  There was a meat lovers, a pizza that had hot peppers on it, a peperoni, and just plain cheese pizza too.  The specialty pizzas were big hits.  Everybody really liked them.  The kids ate the pepperoni and plain cheese pizzas.  The kids liked their pizza but kids always love pizza usually.  Honestly the cheese and pepperoni pizza didn't look as good as the adult's pizza.  It was just a little too greasy for me.  That's what happens with cheese and pepperoni pizzas but that was probably the only negative thing I would say about the pizza experience at Somma.  Overall I really liked it here and I will be back.  If you looking for somewhere to just chill have a drink this is your place.  If you're looking for a good time with the whole family this is your place.  If you want really good pizza with great service go to Somma's!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Saturday around 200pm . 7 diners. Cool sports bar space, lots of tvs and lots of seating. Staff was super friendly. Table had a white pizza which was very tasty and huge. Others had side salads and a couple had gotten a buff chicken salad and grilled chicken salad that came with fries, cheese etc. homemade ranch was a winner with everyone. Side of fries were pretty good and a large portion. The winner of the meal was a massive meatball hoagie that was one of the best I've ever had in the city. I would return here again with no hesitation! Good draft list as well ."}
