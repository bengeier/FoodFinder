{"text":"I really like this diner a lot especially for breakfast. It is fast and inexpensive and delicious. The home fries are so tasty. They have quiet an extensive menu for both breakfast and lunch/dinner. Portions are large, food arrives quickly and service is good. Give them a try!"}
{"text":"I was there today and I most likely will not be returning anytime soon. The server Elmer was very slow and messed up our orders. Everyone else who works there seemed very unhappy to be there an really just brought down the vibe. It then took our server so long after he cleared our plates to bring the check that we stood up to ask for it and the lady ringing us out was extremely rude. I have not been here in a long time and will never go back."}
{"text":"Best late breakfast in the area....breakfast special is always a good bet. Yes things can get busy in there but the servers are friendly an usually handle it well. Food is just like mom and grandma used to make. Will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"Yummy breakfast food. Their breakfast special is 2.99 & comes with three eggs, potatoes, bacon/sausage/ & toast. It's served all day. Anyone that knows me can tell you I'm a potato FREAK! Their hash browns are AWESOME. I'm actually drooling right now thinking of them!  Our hostess looked like she was just unfriendly and at the end of our meal she rang us out while on the phone taking a personal phone call. Our server came over to take our order, didn't introduce himself and just stared at us for a few seconds before asking if we knew what we wanted. Took forever to bring us our check .. I had to actually get up and go to the counter to get it because he was just staring into space.   Good food. Good portions. Bad service."}
{"text":"The service has really gone down since the new management has taken over. Food seems very bland, and you can obviously see they miss the hostess that used to work in the afternoons. I would not recommend this restaurant at all."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a late Sunday Breakfast. We usually do Bob Evans but this was on our way home from church so we figured we'd give it a try for something different. The restaurant was completely packed but we were seated very quickly. I got a coffee, my first cup was definitely not the best coffee I have ever had, but when I got a refill, it was much better, might have just been a weak pot. My boyfriend and I ordered off the breakfast menu. The French toast was well made, I ordered it with strawberries that turned out to be the consistency of a sundae topping. I wish I would have been warned that it wasn't actually fruit. Otherwise, the food was good. We especially enjoyed the home fries. The price of the meal for the amount we received was fair. Overall, we would probably give Luna's another go, maybe on a morning other than a Sunday!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I visited Luna's at 10:30 on a Sunday morning and were seated immediately, which we were pleasantly surprised by. Our experience was great! The service was a little slow because they were so busy, but the staff was incredibly friendly! Despite the fact that our waitress was so busy, she still checked on us multiple times and made sure our drinks were never less than half full. To top it off, the food was amazing. My boyfriend and I ordered the southern skillet, biscuits and gravy, and banana nut pancakes, and we loved all 3 items.  I would absolutely recommend Luna's to anyone!!  I wish I would've taken a photo of the food before we dove in!"}
{"text":"The breakfast is always good. The lunch and dinner items, not so much. They seem to always mess the orders up whether it's not adding items that you've requested or removing items from a sandwich. Overpriced for the quality of food you receive."}
{"text":"Too bad there are not zero stars or less for ratings. We chose to try out this place because we had an Entertainment coupon which said it was valid anytime. We asked if we could use it when placing our order, and the waitress told us that they do not accept them for breakfast. We should have gotten up and left then. The over-easy eggs were runny, the toast was cold, the grits were lumpy, and our waitress tried to serve our meals to the table next to us. We tried once again to use the coupon up at the register, were again refused, and when we called their attention to the fact that it said valid anytime, the cashier called our attention to a little handwritten notice taped to the front of the register counter that said they did not accept the coupons for breakfast. First of all, nice place to put it, when you have already finished eating, and secondly, what the heck difference should it make when you use it? Six dollars is six dollars, regardless of what time of day it is. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Breakfast was horrible.  Went there for the first time in a few years and they have really went down in quality.   Pancakes tasted funny. Scrambled eggs were more fried then scrambled. Bacon was like burnt leather.    At least toast was good.   But to be fair my wife liked her scrambled platter."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a home cooked meal then this is your place. Their food is fantastic with a variety not usually offered by a family style restaurant. What a great staff too; they always are attentive to your dining needs to assure you have a great experience along with fantastic food. Breakfast, lunch or dinner is always a great bet when you're in the mood for some down home style cooking"}
{"text":"The food was good. My mother and I were quite annoyed with the staff! Our server was very nice and it isn't that the staff isn't nice, most of them are. What was annoying that the one waitress was allowed to have her children run around. Sorry Luna's is not a daycare! I have no problem with people bringing children to work but watch them!"}
{"text":"Another nice little mom and pop diner.  I've been here for lunch 3 times and each time the food has been delicious, satisfying portion size and a good bargain.  The servers are pleasant and attentive.  They have some good lookin' desserts but I haven't had room to try them yet. Try the fish sandwich."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast after passing it every single day on my way home. The inside reminds me of a NJ diner, but the food was anything but. The corned beef was so tough and dry; the turkey club we ordered came in pieces, the bread was soggy. The French fries were the highlight of my visit. The locals swear by this place but it's definitely a pass for me. Service was average, the price was fair, and at the end of the meal I was still hungry, that's never a good sign."}
{"text":"The waitress was nice and attentive.  She took our drink and food order right away.  The food arrived in about 5 minutes, fast! Our food was good and we had a pleasant time.  Now the down side.  The place could use a thorough cleaning/updating.  When you go to pay the bill and look at the area in the back, it is filthy.  The wall going to the kitchen is gross.  I will not be going back!"}
{"text":"-Chicken soup was delicious -Pancakes and eggs were ok; go for the short stack if you don't want a ton of heavy cakes. -Dijon chicken was good; a bit dry but tasty -Friendly staff; vigilant and attentive -Bathroom was not great; needed to be serviced -Overall, like visiting your Aunt's house..."}
{"text":"The burgers are the winners here. Go with them. Not so much the cold sandwiches. It's not that they aren't ridiculously large, it's that they are not memorable for anything other than that. I'm beginning to suspect that some of them are premade and held in the fridge.  Servers are always friendly, but in the 3 years we've been coming here, I would swear no one has bothered to clean anything other than the tabletops."}
{"text":"AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL!!!! Cold and under cooked food with a rude and disrespectful owner. Neither of us took more than a couple of bites and we were both disgusted. when we went up to pay for our coffee, the owner told us that was \"hard to believe\" and three our check. Seriously? Who does that??? I could understand if we had eaten it. We told our served right away that we didn't like it and 99% was left on the plates. Even the coffee was nasty, but we were willing to pay for it.  We've been there a few times in the past and it was so-so. They don't make a lot of things fresh (per our server). Most everything is pretty made, but today we were looking for a fast meal, not a perfect one. What we got was disgusting slop and attitude. Never again!"}
{"text":"We entered Lunas on a weekday for lunch and a woman rocketed past us carrying a high chair and quickly put it against a booth in the corner. She didn't say anything to us. Then a second woman came out of nowhere and said 'You can go over there' pointing to the general area the first woman was now standing.  It was really weird. I've become accustomed to being greeted, being asked how many people are in our party, and also being asked if we need a high chair or booster chair. But okay, I guess we'll skip all that and go directly to sitting and my almost 4 year old is apparently sitting in a high chair again. Lunas was half filled with senior citizens and half empty. The TV's in the corners had the news on. And senior pricing and specials we're plentiful.  Luna's definitely caters to the areas seniors. But the value isn't just for AARP cardholders - The whole menu is priced very reasonably. Today I got the Westsider. It's sliced meatloaf with gravy atop a piece of bread. It was served with a side of steamed veggies, a bowl of soup, and a scoop of mashed potatos. Delicious! The food here always reminds me of the stuff my mom used to make. Their corned beef is really good too. The waitress turned out to be attentive, friendly, and efficient too! If you're in the mood for some feel-good food then Luna's is the place to try. Trust me."}
{"text":"This has been one of my favorite places to come for years!    They really cater to a senior crowd and even feature early bird specials for them.  The prices are reasonable overall though.     The main thing I come here for is the corn beef.  The sandwiches are stacked and thinly sliced.  I absolutely love them.    They have a lot of pies to choose from for desert, but I never have any room left to try them,.  You can take a look at them on your way out when you pay your check at the register.    I am getting hungry writting this review.  See you at Luna's."}
{"text":"Food here is fantastic....staff is a bit odd, but friendly enough.  Have been coming here since 1998.  Salads are really delicious here, sandwiches are also tasty.  Nice place to hang out with pals."}
{"text":"I stopped into Luna's on York Road in Parma Heights for a quick lunch. This is a local restaurant that I used to enjoy going to but today I found the overall experience to be disappointing. The staff wasn't especially friendly or quick at seating us. The table was dirty, with syrup all over it. The server seemed to be in a rush and appeared disinterested in us. While the food was served quickly, it was lacking flavor. I had a grilled chicken sandwich and the bun was soggy. The fries were tasteless. I don't anticipate visiting the York Road Luna's again any time soon."}
{"text":"The food and the prices are awesome.  End of story.  The service can be a little slow, and when they're hectic perhaps it comes across as a bit rude.  If you are looking for a warm greeting, lots of check-ups during your meal, and a very \"on top of it\" server, this place might disappoint.  But if you want an awesome breakfast on the cheap (can't beat their 2.99 special), a great corned beef, traditional dinners, etc, all at good prices you will enjoy yourself."}
