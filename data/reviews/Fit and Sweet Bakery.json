{"text":"Picked up two Nutella tarts after dinner. A bit overpriced at $2.50 each but really yummy! Traditional pie crust tart base, a heap of Nutella, a caramel with chocolate button topping. Delfish. :) 

If you're not familiar with this place, it's fairly new (less than 6 months) and owned by a family. Lovely people."}
{"text":"I walked by this place several times without going in. The name is \"Fit and Sweet\" but the window shows all this salad and hummus stuff so I got turned off. One night I was looking for any kind of food o I went in and explored.  I was offered oodles of samples (all delicious) and the grilled chicken is so good omg, I dunno what they did to that bird but it was lit lol ok soo the soups were all good but my favorite was the cabbage soup aka borch? i really like those light borak things.  lol these are funny names. There's not a HUGE variety of food but I just discovered the bagged baked stuff for $3 and you better believe I'll be in there on a regular basis.
TIP: The guy there looks scary but he's nice and the ladies look nice but they're NICE. ha... you thought controversy was about to happen

4 stars!!"}
{"text":"Super friendly couple owners, service is slow since only one person makes the sandwiches, but the taste and price are excellent.  You get a free pop with purchase of a sandwich.  One of the owners offered everyone waiting to try their homemade soup, and I tried all three - Borscht, Chicken, and Yogurt.  The Borscht was a yummy vegetable soup.  The chicken soup was a little spicy and aromatic.  The yogurt had an interesting flavor and aftertaste.  I love all three soup, would definitely come back for them in the future.  I only had a macaroni salad and a piece of chocolate marble cake in this visit.  My friends who had the chicken sandwiches all enjoyed their food.  As we were eating, the lady owner offered us a piece of Anthill cake as dessert.  OH. MY. GOSH.  It reminded me of a favourite childhood sweet of mine!  The crunchy dough is bound together with caramelized condensed milk and topped with walnuts, this is similar to a Chinese pastry called Sachima but EVEN BETTER!  This bakery is quite promising, I would visit again to try other food and sweets."}
{"text":"Get the honey cake balls, get more then 2 cause you will devour them! The staff are nice, place is clean and new looking forward to getting more sweet stuff soon. Best of luck to the new business."}
{"text":"We just had some take out for lunch and it was perfection. The Kabobs were amazing. Came in a great portion with rice and a nice size delicious green salad. The borscht soup was just like mama used to make. This paired with the great price, I've found my new favorite place in the hood."}
