{"text":"While the staff at Eddy's Deli is as friendly and helpful as in any average restaurant, their food is simply bad.

I ordered their dinner combination - meatloaf with mashed potatoes and a chicken soup. The soup smelled very bad and tasted worse. I suspected it was spoiled and only ate a spoon. Meatloaf was bland and mashed potatoes were, well... like any mashed potatoes. 

While my stomach problems the same night might have been caused by something else (but very unlikely), I strongly suspect they were caused by the food at Eddy's. I would not recommend dining at this restaurant.

The seats are also cramped."}
{"text":"I have been to Eddy's several times with my parents and the food is very good.  The restaurant itself isn't fancy and the service can be somewhat slow.  Their crab salad sandwich stood out to me and their breakfast options are always a hit!"}
{"text":"This is my absolutely favorite breakfast place by far and their Reubens are killer!  The food is excellent and the portions are definitely man size, I never leave hungry!"}
{"text":"My family and I have been eating here most of my life and will continue to do so. The laid back atmosphere and classic meals are what keeps bringing us back.  I especially love the HUUUUGE salads which could easily feed 4 people, and the yummy appetizers like Hummous and Grape Leaves.

The prices are so good, I am not sure how they can stay in business, but I am glad they do.  The breakfast menu is equally large and affordable with Crepes, omelettes, or corn beef hash to name just a few.

All in all, one of the best places in the county to eat large, delicious meals, with no stuffy waiters or high tabs at the end."}
{"text":"Great little find in cuyahoga falls! It is a \"greasy spoon\" kind of place with a huge menu and breakfast served all day. They could seriously cut the menu in half and cut the daily specials to like 3-4 or something. Deli sandwiches were huge (had a second meal in leftovers). Prices were reasonable and service friendly. Don't go looking for fancy... go for good quick large portions. Would have added a star if the place felt cleaner... as long as you know you are heading in to a little neighborhood greasy spoon style place you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great spot for Sunday breakfast, esp. if you go early.

If you go often enough that staff gets to know you, they'll have your regular orders memorized.   That is really nice!

Breakfast is available all day and it's usually quite good."}
{"text":"Went on an all u can eat wings night and could handle only one plateful. Lots of food for the money, but ambiance, unprofessional atmosphere, and lots of unbused tables made me skeptical. Garlic/parmesan wings were tasty."}
{"text":"This place is nasty.  They serve rotten meat for Philly cheese steaks.  I asked them to replace it and got charged for both meals.  Don't waste your time or money.  They even charge .40 to read the newspaper and will just add it to the check without telling you.

Stay away"}
{"text":"Looking for a new place for our family to try for breakfast/lunch we chose your restaurant on Saturday October 18, 2014 around 12:30pm. 

I am not one to ever complain, but the combination of our food & service we received today was absolutely terrible.  Our waitress was inattentive and did not know menu food ingredients.  When asked if there was egg in the veggie burger she said she didn't know & said they probably wouldn't know in the back either...or she was to lazy to ask.  

First our drinks came, my daughters Dr. Pepper tasted terrible & when we asked for something else it seemed the waitress already knew & wasn't surprised that it tasted bad.  Next came my side salad which was nothing more than wilted iceberg lettuce, rubbery onion & a dried out cucumber.  When the meals came, I had low expectations due to what we had received already.  A turkey sandwich on sourdough, which was so dry and disappointing, not to mention no offer of condiments from our waitress.  The hummus I ordered, was the worst I've ever tasted in the stow/kent area (and I eat a lot of different hummus).  I could not even eat it mixed in with my wilty salad.  

Then came the bill, $50 for 1 appetizer, 2 meals, 2 sides of French fries and a side salad?  We asked for the hummus (listed as $5.95 on the menu) but was $6.95 on the bill to be taken off since it was so terrible, the waitress seemed annoyed with my dissatisfaction but took it off.  Then I saw that the onion rings ordered instead of the potato chips with the turkey sandwich, which the waitress said would cost $1.75 more, were listed as $2.25.  My daughters banana split waffle listed for $6.95 had an additional topping charge of $2.25? My wilty side salad listed as $2.50 on the menu was $4.95 on the bill.  Finally, I noticed that the Apple juices for my 2 young daughters were $2.25 each, then looking back at the menu saw a smaller size available for less which the waitress never mentioned or asked which one we wanted.  

When getting ready to go, we were never offered boxes for the leftover French fries and as we picked them up in the paper the were served on, the waitress walked by shaking her head.

Upon paying, the cashier asked how everything was in which my husband answered it was just ok.  The cashier did not even question or seem concerned as to why that was his response.

So not only did we have a terrible food quality experience but were overcharged and/or ripped off on just about everything we ordered.  

I will not hesitate to express my disappointment and disgust for our entire Eddy's Deli experience to everyone I know.  A truly awful and overpriced dining experience!"}
{"text":"It just seems like they don't care. The first thing we saw pulling up was an almost empty parking lot with 2 of the kitchen staff smoking by the side of the building. But hey, it was an off time of day. Our waitress was nice. The food...My omelette looked big and fluffy, but it had a kind of rubbery yet watery texture, with cheese melted on top of it, but not inside. The bacon inside was completely crumbled into tiny bits, which would have been ok, but there was no cheese inside to hold it together, and the egg seemed like it was cooked separately, so it didn't stick to that either making it hard to eat. Limp home fries. Nothing was seasoned. The real problem was that they served me completely rock solid biscuits with sausage gravy. I mean, the biscuits could not be pierced by a fork, and they were totally melded on to the plate. I could not even pry them off the plate with my fork using all of my force. They were completely inedible, making me wonder how and why this got approved and passed through the kitchen and on to me. The waitress took it back and gave me a new one, saying that the cook said he must have pressed the wrong button on the microwave. So the food is microwaved, and the microwave either has an Annihilation button, or it was cooked for 15 minutes without the cook noticing, or it was really old and stale to begin with. The other problem, was my partner's sandwich. He ordered a \"manhattan\" and explained to the server that he wanted some substitutions which she wrote down. No tomato, he wanted American instead of Swiss, and he didn't want it on rye. So, it arrived exactly as it is in the menu with none of his specifications: tomato, swiss, and on rye. He was not happy, but didn't bother saying anything because we didn't want to stay longer. The biscuit thing might have been a mistake and not the norm, but when multiple things go wrong on one occasion, I start feeling resentful that we went there and paid for the experience. All together it just seemed like no one wanted to be there, including us."}
{"text":"If you're a single man and don't mind dating someone who has children; there are some really good looking women who work here. But besides the service, I ordered their walnut waffles which were really good but kind of bland (the walnuts would have been better had they been baked into the waffle and not just sprinkled on the top). 
  My waitress was a really cute burgundy haired girl with a great sense of humor. And the hostess was equally as pleasant. I give the hostess a lot of credit, I overheard her talking to my waitress, she has some type of cancer but she looked great and I wish her the best of luck! Whatever pains she is dealing with she kept a smile on her face the entire time."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Eddy's for lunch on a Sunday afternoon. When I walked in the door and the checkout line and the waiting to be seated line were converging in tight spaces I instantly realized the building was a bit too small but I find it hard to blame a business for being too busy. This was the only downside to our experience. The service was friendly and prompt. The menu was expansive considering what I was expecting going in. I ordered the Reuben Classic and the Beef Barley soup. The soup was very good, though i would like a little more beef in it if it were my main dish. The reuben was great, stacked high with a heaping side of chips or french fries. Prices were reasonable with great portion sizes and friendly service, what else can you ask for? Hopefully they differ from all the other businesses at that location and can stay around for awhile and get a chance to do little remodel and add some space and I will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Good selection of food.  Prices were reasonable.  Not a very large establishment and the booths were falling apart slightly (my bench had no cushioning and moved when I moved.)   Cajun Steak Benedict was very good."}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast place in the area. The home fries are out of this world and I am picky about them!!!!! The French toast is so good as well. The price can't me beat for what you get. I love this gem!!! It's always busy and plates are always overflowing."}
{"text":"This restaurant lived up to the dirty standards set by its counterpart in Cuyahoga Falls on Oakwood. I could have made a sandwich will all the crap on the floor. The servers were all unkept as well and one didn't even know the difference between Chicken Gumbo and Chicken Dumpling soup. I saw her twice serve what she had told the patron was Chicken Gumbo but was actually Chicken Dumpling. This was even after the first patron told her it wasn't chicken Gumbo at all. Know the menu. Just looking around inside the joint it screamed \"We don't care.\" Very unfortunate because the food is pretty good. Big sandwiches stacked with a ton of meat. I ordered the New Yorker which was hot corned beef, cole slaw, and spicy mustard between two pieces of rye. Well, no mustard and the pieces of rye couldn't have been thinner. Lots of corned beef though and it was good. Just overall uncleanliness left a bad taste in my mouth, not the food.

Update 2/26/12:

While the cleanliness/appearance of this place still leaves a bit to be desired, the food is top notch and I am increasing to 3 stars based on that alone.  We tried the location in Stow again for breakfast and it is without a doubt one of the better breakfasts I have had in a while. We have been going to breakfast a lot lately and have been disappointed a few times elsewhere.  Huge omelets at Eddy's.  Huge portions overall.  I got the corned beef and cheese omelet with swiss.  Awesome.  Home fries were good too.  Almost a hybrid of homefries/hasbrowns.  

The service was okay too.  Actually the food came out lightning fast and very hot.  Thought we were at El Campesino for a minute. 

My wife still doesn't like the place based soley on the appearance but she too agreed the portions were huge and the food was pretty good."}
{"text":"This is a nice hidden gem! Great coffee and the portions are huge! They know how to make breakable bacon and the staff is super friendly!"}
{"text":"I love Eddys . Food is great no matter what you order .. Fast and friendly service.

Do your tummys a favor and order the bacon cheddar burger on a pretzel bun.. Your tummy will ty..."}
{"text":"Great device, but with maybe a dozen customers at 11:30 AM on a Monday, what would I expect.  I order a late breakfast of 3 eggs over medium, american fries  rye toast.  It arrived fast.  The eggs were perfect, but the bacon tasted like yesterday and was barely warm.  The fried potatoes were also barely warm.  This was a mediocre meal.  To do Eddy's justice, I will be back, to see if this was just an off day.


  Fresh, clean and friendly atmosher.  I would hope I will be well satisfied next time."}
{"text":"I visited the stow location a while ago with my mother as a chance to check out a newer establishment in the area. Absolutely awful experience. We waited 20 minutes approximately to get our order taken. Then another 25 to get our food.. When we got out food, you could still see raw sections in my chicken. I did not eat it. My French fries weren't cooked either. My mothers chips had green mold on them. We both did not eat any part of our meal.. We waited for the waitress to come back to realize and when she finally did, we pointed out what was wrong with our meals and she said ok and left to get our check. We literally had complete meals sitting on our plate and were not offered new food or the money off our bill. Absolutely unethical for business.
Don't come here unless you're looking to skip the meal but pay for it anyway."}
{"text":"My wife and I ordered the chicken cordon blue because the waitress said it was delicious. It had the consistency, smell and texture of wet pate cat food, roasted chicken to be exact.  I wouldn't feed this to my cat, because she prefers chunk style wet cat food.  The manager was rude and refused to take it off our bill (I was kind when I asked). All joking aside, the food is disgusting - steer clear."}
{"text":"Low salt but canned... spotty service but huge portions.

Every day has an all you can eat option... there are ~ 10 specials on the board in the front... and a huge amount of options in every section of the large menu.

Dinner on a Wednesday in lent means all you can eat fish... you can get a potato or pierogies... and salad or soup.

Potato options are epic... baked, mashed, home fries, sweet potato, sweet potato fries, rice pilaf... and a couple more I heard a waitress rattle off to the next table... not sure if the pierogies are on the regular starch list but they were an option with the fish.

Pierogies were not made in house... Mrs T's or some other mass market plain potato variety... smothered in Onions... they were OK... nothing special.

The veggie was canned green beans... love that they weren't salty... but there was no flavor... no bacon... no onion... nothing.

Burger was huge and moist and good with giant slices of tomato... onion rings were a tad greasy, but the onion inside was sweet and not mushy.

Regulars got better refills on drinks and chatter... we were sort of left to hang with no check for a long time.

Will go back for breakfast... something like 6 options for stuffed potato pancakes??? 

There is an outside patio... this was the fist day of spring... and it was snowing... so all the chairs were piled up... looks nice size and worth a try on a warmer day."}
{"text":"This is becoming a favorite of ours. The food is good and fast. We never wait long.cc As others have said the waitresses are friendly and very attentive. The portions are large enough that we always have food to take home."}
{"text":"Great place to eat.  Great corn beef!"}
{"text":"The best summary I can give is that the best thing about this meal was the store bought chips they served with my sandwich. 

The French onion soup was clearly canned and the cup was choked with bagged, stale croutons. It was $4 for a cup which was atrocious given the quality. My fish sandwich was bland, the lettuce was wilted, and the pickle was unpleasant. Word of advice - have good pickles if you're gonna call yourself a deli. My boyfriend's gyro clearly had meat that was pre-sliced and frozen, and they forgot the sauce. A deli served pre-sliced frozen meat. 

When the waitress asked how our food was, I shrugged and she walked away. Do yourself a favor and just don't."}
{"text":"Tonight was my second time there...previously it was for breakfast and while not outstanding it wasn't good or bad enough to leave a review. My husband had the all you can eat chicken which seemed like a great deal at $9.99 but in reality he would have been better off with one serving from KFC or even Acme or Giant Eagle. The first order came out and it's obvious it's pre-breaded stuff like Banquet and tastes like it too....the there's the refills...you have to flag someone down to ask for more (easier said than done between cellphones and smoke breaks) so long story short don't bother. I had the Hawaiian stir-fry \"special\" which I might add was no special at all...it was a $1 off the menu price for the stir-fry but then they add a $1 to make it Hawaiian but throwing in a handful of canned pineapple. The server was friendly and great with drinks but like I said might now quite get the AYCE concept. A couple other things...there was a little kid rolling silverware and putting cups out...I'm all for showing kids work but handling the clean cutlery and coffee cups should be left to someone who understands cross contamination or at least have gloves on. Instead of leveling tables they also shove paper napkins between the table and the wall which were pretty gross...and take a close look at picture 2 you'll see the big dirty spot where they don't wipe down the whole table. My advice is to take your money down the road...there are better options."}
{"text":"I may just have to try this one. But I can say if its like the one in stow I'll be disappointed. The stow store has horrible service. Food is  basic nothing stands out other the portion size. I can deal with basic edible food but when service sucks I'll spend my hard earn money somewhere else. Just to note I gave them 3 tries before I quit going there."}
{"text":"I can't believe I have lived here for so long and it has taken me this long to visit!  The interior is very basic, no frills.  The menu is too large- I, personally think they need to reduce it a little.  When you walk in, they have tons of daily specials, which indcates to me that not all of it is fresh (learned that from Restaurant Impossible).  

When I go, I tend to order the potato pancakes, which are delicious!  Best $4 I ever spent!  I also ordered the beef & latkes, which are potato cakes stuffed with corn beef- so, so, so good!  Their corned beef is the best I have ever had.  The reuben is huge!  If I had someone to share it with, I would get it every time!

My kids like the burgers.  My oldest is vegan and there isn't much she can eat from there.  Their grape leaves left a lot to be desired and their hummos is hit or miss, which isn't made there.  They order it and you never know when it will be available.  The last two times they haven't had it, which is the reason why we haven't been back in a few weeks.

Service has always been pleasant."}
{"text":"The food here is great. A very good mom and pop type family restaurant. The corned beef delicious.  The portions are huge. We love it there!"}
{"text":"Love breakfast at Eddy's! I like you have a choice of home fries or hash browns. Eggs always cooked perfect! Pancakes are very good. In the fall, try their pumpkin pancakes - Fantastic! Corn beef hash is homemade, not canned stuff most places serve. My personal favorite is Cajun Steak Benedict. If you like spicy you'll love this! Lunch is very good as well. The soups are home made. Love the Matzo Soup! Deli sandwiches are piled high. I enjoy sitting by the kitchen checking out the dishes as they go by. The menu is large, great way to check out all the different foods. The food is always served very fast, even when the place is jammed.

Most of the wait staff is very friendly and attentive. Give Eddy's a try and judge for yourself!"}
{"text":"Getting worn around the edges. Soups are overly salty. Was once pretty good but is beginning to slip. Interior needs a makeover."}
{"text":"Serious gnat issue !! While the food is good waving away gnats for the entire meal as well as dead ones on the wall raises questions as to the cleanliness of this place. They seem well aware they have a problem since the response when I mentioned it was simply \"I know \" ! If you know you have an issue then why not address it ? Maybe someone from the health department should try and eat a meal there and see how gross the gnat issue is !"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for Eddy's deli. Unfortunately their corned beef hash was almost inedible. There was a bone in it, and it tasted like it came straight from a can. I had a decent reuben from them once, but I would not recommend their breakfast hash. Also, the atmosphere really needs an update. There was a rip in the booth I was sitting in."}
{"text":"Stopped for dinner on a Friday night. Clientele was solely elderly white people. The vegetable omlette was so very, very greasy and unseasoned. Toast was overly buttered. The fruit cup had decent fresh pineapple, but the melon was a bit off. Large portions, decent prices, ok service. A neighborhood greasy spoon."}
{"text":"Would not recommend.  Gave this place a couple of chances, but no more.  The last experience sums it up.  Outside of business is unkept - very tall weeds surround the building and the grass is a couple of weeks overdue to be mowed.  Once we went in, had to wait at least 2 minutes to be acknowledged - all employees were in the back doing who knows what - none came out with customers orders or anything for a customer, so who knows?  No friendly greeting when we were acknowledged, just \"how many\" and \"follow me\".  Once seated, we had to wait for a long time for our waitress to come over - she was shooting the breeze with a 'regular'. When she took the order, it was short responses at best. And when I didn't say the type of bread, I received a very curt \"what type?\"  When the food was brought out, it was plopped on the table and the waitress walked away.  Nothing about whether we needed anything else.  Had to flag her down for A-1 - I ordered steak and eggs, so being asked about this should have been automatic, I would have thought. When I looked at my food, most of the home fries resembled grizzle and the eggs, which should have been over easy were much closer to scrambled. The toast was heated bread.  Could have complained, but didn't bother.  The waitress did ask later how everything was and when I said \"so-so\", she didn't seem overly concerned and didn't ask anything else - just going through the motions.  When we checked out, she didn't even ask how it was.  She just took the bill, said the total and we paid.  No thank you, nothing.  So...with all of the other options in the area for good \"home style food\", why on earth stop here?  That is, unless you're a regular - there does seem to be a different standard of treatment for that group.  We tried to be friendly; we tried to engage our waitress in conversation, she wasn't interested.  Go someplace else - there are some very good options in the area."}
{"text":"Impressed!!! We waited a bit for a server to come seat us, we almost left. Boy, am I glad we did not! Thanks to Mark's YELP, I tried the reuben. WOW! It was the biggest reuben I've ever seen and was great!! My wife ate the philly which was also HUGE and AWESOME. They use lean roast beef on their philly, not ribeye. I usually hate philly's because they are too greasy. This one rocked! 

If you're in the neighborhood, check this restaurant out. I don't think you'll be disappointed. It's in an area where you wouldn't expect a restaurant, but stop anyway!!"}
{"text":"Good place for breakfast.  Very reasonably priced.  Large portions.  The corned beef sandwich was piled high. I have had the fried chicken here and it was very good."}
{"text":"3.5

This is a great local place to come to for lunch. I got the French dip, which was good but not great. The dipping sauce was great, but the meat left something to be desired. My husband got the corned beef. Now that's a sandwich!! It was piled high and the meat and bread were great. My husband asked for a side of the horseradish to go with it and I strongly recommend that!! The fries were actually very good as well. 

The service wasn't the best, but it wasn't terrible either. The waitress had her kid with her while taking orders which we thought was a little strange. But she was pretty pleasant and nothing terrible happened. 

We will absolutely be back for a quick lunch trip sometime, but I can tell you this I will be getting the corned beef!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed, first off we just moved to the area and wanted to find a good place to eat that is in walking distance. This was the closest restaurant to our house so we were very excited to check it out. That drastically changed when we walked into an out dated, foul smelling dining room. As soon as we walked in the one server looked at us and continued to do other work on the computer rather than at least acknowledge we were there. Then when she did finally look up all she said was \"sit where ever\". The biggest draw in my eyes for the restaurant was the patio. When I asked if we could sit out there she let out a big sigh and told us that since it was only her and one other waitress that she didn't want to be walking back and forth (mind you there are 6 other people in the entire place). So I politely said thank you but we will find somewhere else and rather then suck it up and make the 10 foot walk for us to sit at the patio she said bye and we left. Terrible service, would never go back or recommend this place to anyone"}
{"text":"Fast service, reasonable menu prices.  Food was okay and same for cleanliness of restaurant"}
{"text":"Local place that charmed upon first visit.  Our waitress (Kristi) was attentive, genuine, and extremely helpful. The wide variety of options will be sure to satisfy every taste bud and I would highly recommend this local diner for a quick bite to eat.

Also is open 24 hours on thursday friday saturday!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Food pot
Rations have gotten bigger and quality continues to go up. Prices are phenomenal. Lots of regulars here and the waitresses are so friendly. When we come back to visit (I used to live here but moved) we ALWAYS come here at least once. 
I'm a 40 yr old mom with gluten and dairy allergies. The cook is always accommodating. Can't go wrong coming here!!!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I went in to eat we got the All you can eat Chicken Wings. They were ok. The fries were better. I went to use the bathroom. The floors were dirty and sticky. Some places on the wall looks like black mold or some one's crap???? I use to go in there when I use to live up the road and things werte better. Willn't be going back."}
{"text":"Okay,
Eddy's. The Akron area's only  answer to Jacks Deli and Corky and Lenny's on the east side of cleveland. The food is actually pretty good. The restaurant itself is disgusting. if I were the owner of the place and my space in which customers sat to eat was that dirty I would not even be able to walk into my own restaurant. I go in there and just accidently touch the table with my arm, my arm is sticky. There is mass amounts of dust on the window sills next to the booth and I believe I remember seeing a dead bug as well. Hope he didn't die eating the food. The service is eh. If the owners name is Eddy.
Eddy - your kitchen is probably very clean. Please please please please. Take a mop. A dust rag. Heck a paper towel would be something. You loose what could be a five star rating cause your space is so disgustingly dirty. 
This guy just opened Lyla's down the street from me and its Mediterranean. O how i fear for that place's cleanliness"}
{"text":"cozy small-town restaurant. the restaurant itself is a little tarnished, but we always have great service, especially with Brandie and the young lady who busses tables. i would recommend the greek omlette with greek sauce."}
{"text":"Tried to give them the benefit of the doubt once again. My mistake.

Good luck getting the wait staff to care about ANYTHING like cleaning (seen food on the floor and seats AND smeared on tables from the previous night's business), getting your food right, entering your order correctly. The ONLY thing these \"waitresses\" care about are their cell phones, standing in the back and gossiping (LOUDLY, and cursing while they're doing it), and snatching the tips while leaving the table filthy."}
{"text":"If I could pick a word to describe my experience, I would have to go with \"Ehhh\". Here's a quick rundown. 

The restaurant: We were met by the scent of sewage/rotten eggs when we got inside. Probably should have left then, but decided to stick it out. The restaurant is outdated, there were flies and gnats buzzing around, exposed wires near the check out area, and it was just kind of dirty overall. 

The food: Bland bland bland. My burger had no seasoning at all, and even with it being topped with cheese, bacon, and Dijon mustard it still had next to no flavor. As my boyfriend put it, he had no idea bacon could be flavorless. My only guess is poor quality of food. My boyfriend had a salad and the only thing you could taste was lemon juice. It was edible, but we didn't enjoy anything. 

The service: We were one of 2 tables at the time of our meal. There were 4 waitresses/staff members. Despite this ratio, rather than our waitress checking on us and providing service, she spent the entirety of our meal chatting it up with the table of waitresses at the back of the restaurant. I had asked for a side of ranch prior to getting the food, and never got it and never had the chance to ask for it. Our waitress didn't check on us until we were finished. I'd understand if it was busy, or you were short staffed. But when you're ignoring customers just to chit chat with your coworkers, it's unacceptable. This is your job, not break time. 

I love supporting local places, but this is definitely one that we will not be making a second trip to."}
{"text":"Exactly what I was looking for. Great deal for $5.50. The hash browns and bacon was hot and crispy. The eggs were just as I ordered. It also came with a side of toast. They also have breakfast skillets,a variety of eggs Benedict meals and other breakfast choices. They also have sandwiches and meals. There are many regulars here. Most of the customers are greeted by name."}
{"text":"Outstanding pastrami Rueben!   Huge section of great sandwiches and comfort foods.   Friendly waitstaff."}
{"text":"Good food.  Clean and neat.  Small tight seating is a negative.  I feel claustrophobic.  The atmosphere is quaint.  I call it \"old people\" dining.  It's very quiet and morning to do for kids.  If you bring kids, bring crayons and a coloring book at the very least."}
{"text":"We order from here often,  as we live around the corner. This place has a homey feel. 

The menu is HUGE! We love the breakfast options.  Sausage gravy and biscuits, Eddy's Slam, and the omelets are our go to choices. My only complaint is that the hash browns could be crispier.
The gyros are awesome, too .
Craving a salad? Get the ranch dressing. They must make it from scratch. It's so good! 
We really love the Countryside, which is an open faced fried veal cutlet sandwich. So good. Always perfectly cooked and juicy. Order extra gravy. It's worth the splurge. 
But the real star of Eddy's is the soup. I'm a huge soup gal.  I eat tons of it when it's cold. I've never had a bad soup there. You know it is made in house because it is always just slighty different. But always great. My favorites are Clam Chowder and Italian Wedding.  The only bad part is they are each only available one day each week. 
They also have an online ordering option, which is nice. But if you want to make any substitutions or modifications to an order, you can't with the online ordering."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed with the inside of the restaurant, but we were able to sit on the patio which was refreshing.  Our server was friendly and efficient.  I had the Falls Favorite, which was a turkey, bacon, swiss on toasted croissant.  It was certainly yummy and worth the price, but I think I could make something comparable at home.  I also happened to get the bottom of the chip bag on my plate, which would have been more devastating had I actually been interested in chips.  In defense of Eddy's, noone in our party ordered the reuben they are famous for, so maybe that would have impressed us more."}
