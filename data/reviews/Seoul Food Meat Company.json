{"text":"100 percent the best wings I've ever had. We ordered the soy garlic wings 2 times in one sitting they were that good! Please don't ever change we will be back next time we are in charlotte for sure"}
{"text":"If you're looking to eat authentic Korean food then this is not the right place.  Food was awesome with great vibes and thought they did a great job with the interior.  Service was good and they made my drink just the way I like em.  BBQ is their main thing there and it was marinated just right.  Reading few comments from some people being disappointed that it's not an authentic Korean restaurant and guess these folks still didn't get the news.  It's NOT a KOREAN RESTAURANT although I think the owner is Korean American with the name Seoul being the capital of Korea but the concept is not authentic Korean.  I think they did a great job even though it's only been open for few weeks? preparation is not the easiest thing to do in any business but you guys did a good job in a tough environment.  I'd definitely go back and next time I'm taking UBER!"}
{"text":"The wings are great. Not sure what Koreans do to make wings so good. I thought that was a Buffalo thing. Great tacos as well in a casual busy setting with all of the local craft beers on tap."}
{"text":"We are all thrilled to have the first Korean chicken wing place open up in Charlotte. But guess what? After a two-hour wait, the food was quite disappointing. The flavor of the chicken wings was not even close to what authentic Korean wings should be. Not only that, they don't even look like the authentic wings. Giving this place two stars only because the drinks were good."}
{"text":"Stopped by on a road trip and had the soy garlic wings, cracklings, kimchi slaw, deviled eggs, and mango lemonade. Everything was delicious, even the cracklings were homemade and we're making popping noise throughout my meal. The chicken was my favorite. It was twice fried, so it was crispy and hot. It had the perfect amount of sauce. Our server was attentive and helpful and even recommended places to visit on our trip (thanks, Christy)! This was a great place for dinner and I wish I hadn't been designated driver so I could have sampled the watermelon soju. Thanks for a great dining experience!"}
{"text":"Awesome chicken!!! good environment!!Watched cubs making history here!!!!"}
{"text":"Great location but the food was not good at all and WAY overpriced.  Fried Pork belly was terrible, I thought I was going to break a tooth.  The only thing I had that was good was the fire chicken.  Ramen mac was ok.  Tried this place, won't be back."}
{"text":"The food is flavorful and everything is \"family style. The soy garlic wings are to die for crunchy, juicy and full of flavor. The sauce on the whole fried fish was delicious however I did find it very hard to eat with all of the bones and couldnt find a lot of meat. I guess that's what you get when it's whole fried lol. As far as the sides, the pimento cheese corn is bomb. Would recommend as an appetizer, it's served with rice chips. LOVED the tomato ponzu. My one complaint is the cheap flimsy cardboard lunch boat they expect you to eat out of. Please upgrade to regular plates!!     Cant wait for the full menu to roll out!!"}
{"text":"The wings were a lot better this time than the first time we went. Love the shrimp chips with the pimento cheese dip. 
Didn't love the pork belly or the 'mac n cheese', which is really just ramen noodles with a not so great cheese sauce, but I would definitely go back for the wings."}
{"text":"Great service ! The servers are friendly and always there to assist you 
Food was ok  I wouldn't rush back ."}
{"text":"SO GOOD!
All of the meat is amazing, and the sides are really delish too. I would recommend the chicken wings - both flavors are bomb - and the beef rib. 
There's a really fun patio with bar games and great beers and cocktails. If you haven't been here yet, definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"Love this place, very authentic food 
Good vibe and lots to do, outdoor area is nice
&"}
{"text":"My friends rave about this place. I enjoy it, but it's not a personal favorite. I find the portions to be small for the price you pay. Menu lacks variety.

Sunday Bloody Mary bar is a decent value."}
{"text":"I recently went to Seoul Food. There are quite a number of options on the menu. My friend and I's eyes were far bigger than our stomach and we ordered way too much food. The quantity of the food was great for its dollar value. The service of our server was excellent. He was very attentive and was sure to explain the menu to us in full, and answer any random questions we had. Now to the flavor of the food.
There were some things that were better than others. We tried the spring roll (great), the deviled eggs (good), and multiple preparations of pork. I felt the pork belly was just okay as was the kimchee pork. The chicken wings were tasty. But I will say everything tasted pretty one note. No matter what we ordered seemed to have the exact same flavor profile. I will try it again just to make sure to have a more rounded experience."}
{"text":"So yummy!  Love the vibe-urban industrial decor, dinner served on a sheet pan family style-fun!  Loved the beef spare ribs, soy deviled eggs, bao buns with the bbq, WINGs are huge and crispy, juicy, super flavorful...everything is so good!  Try the watermelon soju, too!!"}
{"text":"OMG!! So yum. Strawberry Soju = absolutely delicious. Soy garlic wings were light and crispy and yummy. The buns were delightfully good. Excellent Ram and cheese. Pulled pork and the Kimchi short ribs were amazing. We could barely eat half of everything and we ordered small orders of meat. Will definitely be coming back! Service was great and we got our food 5-10 minute after we ordered. Very quick."}
{"text":"We had an amazing experience.  Ordered the wings, half and half, pork, fire chicken, and tons of sides and it was so good.  We recommend it to ANYONE.  Also the dessert green tea ice cream/donut was very good."}
{"text":"Hey self proclaimed food experts and those who want every menu to conform to their dietary needs.... Shut up! This place is unique, food is very tasty, and service is excellent. If you want to have more vegetarian options go to a vegetarian restaurant. Charlotte needs more restaurants willing to take risks with unique food. Not every new restaurant needs to serve shrimp and grits just because it's in the south."}
{"text":"Did you know that barbque was invented in North kora probably? Well I'm pretty sure it was after eating at soulful meet company! Got the crispy pork and spinny potato on stick wow lot of food and came out fast! Good bbq sauce too! Saw other food want to go back and try eat like fire chicken and Roman Mac n cheese! Go to soulful and try real Koran barberque!"}
{"text":"We just had lunch here and it was amazing. The fire chicken was really yummy and the beef Korean tacos were to die for. A cool little place in South End that I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"first time here the fire chicken was moist and hot and the ram'n and mac leaves something to be disired, but the potato rings were a nice twist on the usual french fry, the collard greens were really good and so was the bulgogi taco, sweet amazing and fresh!!
the bao bun was light and sweet as well!!!
overall a nice place to eat kind of loud when it's at capacity not really a romantic spot!!!
but the food is really good!
4 stars!!!
service is nice, but stay on them they move quick!!!"}
{"text":"This is our go-to restaurant when we have guests visit us in Charlotte. My wife and I went there a few weeks ago and their menu was updated, offering even more surprises and delicious eats! We cannot rave enough about the fire chicken. It is such a unique dish and the portion is worth every penny. Their portions in general are great. 
I also recommend the sweet potato nest and the Choiang broccoli to add a little green to your plate (because you may want to/need to make room for the ramen mac and cheese). 
Drinks are reasonably priced - they have a full bar which is great for everyone. 
Atmosphere- laid back and casual. 
Finally, I feel they offer a little bit of everything if you have people with allergies or are just picky eaters in general.
Update: Kim bap bulgogi and the Seoul margarita- get them!"}
{"text":"This is such a cute place with such a chill vibe. 

I had the wings and ramen Mac and potato swirl.  I gave them a 4 Bc the sides were extremely unique but they weren't my favorite. 

But those wings though! AMAZING! Nice and crisp on the outside but still moist. The flavor, soy garlic, was great!!! 

I'll definitely be returning!!"}
{"text":"Very solid and interesting place. Southern BBQ with a heavy Korean influence. Also everything is a la carte and family style. So we got several items and shared them so we got to taste many different things. The star on our tray was the fire chicken. It is not spicy but it is very good and I like the cheese on top. We also got a couple if tacos. The pulled pork taco was disappointing as the pork was dry and really didn't have much flavor. Of the 2 sides the kim chilli Ramen was our favorite. 

There are many other interesting items on the menu and we plan to go back to try those out. We saw some diners with the spareribs and they looked good. 

If you like to try new things this place is great choice."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time with my boyfriend last night and we were not impressed.
The only decent thing about it was our server, Rebekah. She was very attentive and very nice. We did find our food runner to be a tad awkward. She brought our food to the wrong table twice and each time when she realized it was our table, she just awkwardly dropped it off with no eye contact and just slithered away. It would have been nice for a smile or anything... But no. 

Moving along to the food, we got the Korean ribs, pull pork taco, brisket taco, collards, and wings. The Korean ribs had no flavor whatsoever, we were blown and shocked. The tacos were just okay .. as were the collards. The wings were just okay too, they did have a little too much sauce on them and plus we had like only two napkins on our table...yikes.

Overall we probably wouldn't come back for the food but maybe for drinks later in the future.
This place has great potential but needs more flavor profiles in their food."}
{"text":"Great food in charlotte. The service could be a bit better, but overall, it's a spot that everyone should check out."}
{"text":"I love Seoul Food.. Think Korean meets southern fusion. As a vegetarian, I was worried about going anywhere with \"Meat Company\" in the title, but I was surprised at what they had to offer. Everything is basically served family style, and the portions are large. First off, the drinks. I've had pineapple, melon, coconut and the yogurt soju so far. My favorite is the yogurt, it's just a tart yogurt drink mixed with a smooth soju. The pineapple, melon, and coconut are all served inside the fruit. They can be a bit expensive, but they're pretty big and are a blast to share with friends I'll say that the menu was somewhat limited for me, but I love what I get every time I'm there. I almost always get the tofu (wings). They are just large cubed pieces of tofu that are fried and covered in either a spicy tomato based sauce or a soy-garlic sauce. The soy-garlic is by far my favorite. These portions are extremely large. I'm never able to eat the small portion alone. The ramen cheese is exactly what it sounds, ramen but made just like mac and cheese. I would say that it is definitely good, but I think it is missing the creaminess of southern mac and cheese. The potato swirl is a must. It's a spiral cut whole potato covered in a sort of cajun seasoning. The sweet potato birds nest is a pile of sweet potato's cut like noodles that are put in a pile to somewhat look like a nest. The pimento corn cheese is a must for the pimento cheese lovers out there - though they are served with dried shrimp chips (but I love them anyways and make an exception). Overall the restaurant is adorable. It's decorated beautifully and I heard they are in the process of opening a back \"adult playground\" with multiple private karaoke booths for groups and parties. The service is top level, I couldn't ask for more. On Sundays they have a killer bloody mary bar, it's pretty impressive.. and I make it a point to go to Seoul Food before every panthers game and grab some tofu \"wings\" to snack on."}
{"text":"Every time I visit Charlotte, I always make sure to save time for Seoul Food. The menu takes classic southern bbq recipes and smashes them with modern Korean flair leaving you wondering not so much with \"What did I just eat\" but rather \"OMG may I have another.\" Definitely a fun spot to bring newcomers to eat, drink, and eat some more."}
{"text":"This place is promising! It was only a soft opening but I will definitely be back when they fully open and have all the items in the menu. Okay now for the review! I was extremely disappointed to find that it was \"authentic\" Korean food. It's Korean style food mixed with Southern style (that's what our waiter said)  I was looking forward to cooking Korean BBQ in front of yourself. But it's okay! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Exceptionally loud dining room, not sure what crowd they're trying to cater to but that was just a terrible setting for it. Very bad insulation as well, the place is packed but still extremely cold. 

Now on to the food, that I didn't get to eat. I came here for the wings, and requested a sauce sample to see which one I would prefer. The waiter argued that they couldn't do a sauce sample, no real reason just management doesn't permit it. I told the waiter that would be the difference between a sale or no sale.

He comes back a few minutes later with ramekins of sauce, that the manager approved because it was my first visit. Had the garlic soy dropped on me, luckily it was sealed. The spicy bbq sauce is neither spicy nor particularly tasty. The garlic soy is entirely too sweet, it may be decent on the chicken if that's what you're looking for. 

My wife and her friend enjoyed their food, however it was served quickly which smacks of pre-cooking menu items rather than cook to order. I can't really suggest this place to anyone just based on the atmosphere and the fact that there was a weird hesitancy for sauce samples."}
{"text":"The restaurant itself has a fun vibe - backyard bar area with games, private karaoke rooms inside and korean music videos playing throughout. The food is another story. If you want good KFC - korean fried chicken - go to Bonchon. The fish tacos were ok but the ramen mac n cheese was reminiscent of improvised college food and the potato swirl tastes like seasoned cardboard. Oh and the fly in my hubbys beer was a great addition! Definitely WONT BE BACK"}
{"text":"Disclosure: 
If you're planning to go, make sure you read this blog and understand that this is NOT an authentic Korean restaurant... AKA if your taste buds are looking for bulgolgi or bibimbap or those cute little side dishes that go with traditional Korean dishes... This is not it. They offer American cuts of meat - marinated in Korean flavors/spices. http://www.charlottemagazine.com/Charlotte-Magazine/February-2016/Seoul-Food-Meat-Co-Opening-Saturday/

With that said... Their food is absolutely amazing and quite honestly is the only reason why I would go back. 

They were ill prepared for this grand opening and have a lot to fix... The kitchen and process is number one. Two - their wait staff. They had one bartender on deck for a full house. All but one waitress (ours, her name is Kim. Ask for her) looked like a deer caught with headlights. They didn't smile and it was like they were scared of people. 

Average table wait was a minimum of 1.5 hours. The first table that they seated I believe waited 2 hours.  
Needless to say, customers were getting antsy... Some left. We ordered 2 XL large orders of their chicken wings to start (which smelled so good btw) - but it was sent back twice because the chicken was undercooked. Apparently they have small fryers. The wings eventually got nixed and I never got to try them. :(  

They were also working off of a very limited menu: no crispy pork belly, no pulled pork, and more. 

We were two seconds away from walking out at that point. The manager/owner (super sweet) came over and apologized profusely... Offered us a round of shots and also comped all of our meals. It was extremely generous of him and I'm glad he did otherwise we would've never tried their extremely tasty tender beef ribs.

I was extremely disappointed with the wait time, but the food is undeniably good. 

I would highly recommend you try it out, BUT I would suggest waiting at least a month. This will give the owners time to fix the above mentioned issues... And hopefully by then they will be serving their full menu so you can try everything out."}
{"text":"Came to visit family in NC and this place was highly recommended. However, I must say I was very disappointed. The servers were very rude and not friendly. The food was okay, but not my favorite. It was mostly meat that was very fatty. They made us pay for our food before we received it and then over charged us after the meal. Our bill was over $300.00 and the manager told us to \"fuck off\" when we spoke to him one on one. This place is also not dog friendly and was discriminatory, belittling customers and taking advantage of out of town visitors."}
{"text":"Found this place through Yelp. Was intrigued by their tag line... BBQ restaurant with Korean twist... Interesting fusion concept! 

We got there around 6PM and was able to get seated immediately. Between the three of us, we ordered 2 main dishes and 3 sides. Here's my verdict:

- Beef ribs: ahhhmazinnnggg! Really delicious and love the sauce that came with it. Huge portion. We couldn't finish ours and had to pack the leftover. Ate it the next day and it was still as delicious. 
- Fire chicken: it was OK. It was smothered in the spicy Korean paste and melted cheese. Did not enjoy the combo much and would probably pass this dish next time I eat here. (The paste is similar to the one you would get in your bibimbap dish in typical Korean restaurant but spicier) 
- Ramen mac and cheese: interesting but nothing spectacular. The ramen noodle basically replaced your typical mac. 
- Birds nest: love this! Crispy and delicious! 
- Potato swirl: great sides. Came with some type of spicy aioli sauce? 
- Great ambiance. They also have outdoor seating and several TVs inside

Will come back and try the wings next time! Seems like the wings is crowd's favorite judging on the orders from other tables ;)"}
{"text":"First of all, we went to the soft opening and we were still impressed by the service.  Not only was our server, Jennifer J, fantastic, but when of the dishes sold out they offered us an upgrade to the best option in the restaurant. A $10 upgrade - for free.

Let's talk about the food, now. It was amazing. We loved the beef ribs, the ramen Mac and cheese, the bao buns, and the sweet potato birds nests. No complaints, nothing but fantastic things to say. We will be back way too many more times."}
{"text":"Soft opening- clearly Charlotte was excited for these guys to open! Despite the wait and smaller menu we were excited and eager to get a taste of what we could. Food was amazing.. Perfect blend of Korean comfort food!, walks the line just right! The Ramen Mac n cheese, kimchi slaw and pimento cheese corn were all incredible!
Can't wait to come back.
Also.... The keep pounding punch is like a vacation in your mouth, so try that cocktail while you wait, bc I'm sure there will be one for a while. This place is awesome."}
{"text":"I've eaten KBBQ in big cities, as well as homecooked, so I was nervous upon hearing the word \"fusion.\" But the food here is objectively delicious. The beef ribs have the smoked deliciousness of kalbi and the Korean fried chicken is amazing. The cocktails and local beer selection is on point too which is a huge plus. It's a small restaurant so a wait seems inevitable at peak hours, but our food came out really quickly after ordering (~10 min). The interior is reminiscent of a modern KBBQ place with Kpop music and wood/metal designs, but without the grills in each table. My encouragement to this restaurant would be to keep it up and add a few more popular Korean offerings to the menu in some form - dukkboki / spicy rice cakes and real kimchi as sides, vegetarian bibimbap (this would make the restaurant more veg-friendly - for group outings, it's hard to pick this place if someone in the group doesn't eat meat, they'd be stuck ordering sides) and add bulgogi to the meats."}
{"text":"Food is good but the service sucks.u will place an order on the phone and will tell u 20mins will be ready but they will make u wait for an hour and will give u a cold food.u will think it will be hot food but it's not.the front desk Spanish girl very rude and not doing her job."}
{"text":"Holy moly. Worth every penny. Would come back in an instant. Easily a 5 star based on food, staff, price, service, atmosphere, etc. do not miss out on this place."}
{"text":"The food was as good as it looks. The fried pork belly was by far my favorite. They also carried a wide selection of craft beers. In the part of Texas I am from, there is nothing like this around. Good BBQ with a Korean twist."}
{"text":"The food here was great! Definitely have to try the potato swirl and beef ribs with Bao bun.. Also had pineapple soju which was very refreshing.. Definitely will come back and will recommend this place to all of my friends!"}
{"text":"I lovvveeeee their chicken wings marinated in soy garlic. The spicy bbq was more of a gochujang flavor but chicken itself was very, VERY crispy. I went to S. Korea few years ago and my family would order chicken wings and they would deliver it to our apartment and I felt like the chicken wings I had here today was similar like the ones in Korea. Our waitress, Jinyi was very nice and helpful. I will definitely be back with more friends and family. Hopefully they will have all their sides available next time because I was disappointed that they didn't have ramen Mac and cheese."}
{"text":"Parking is tight. However, the food was great. The beef rib was big and very tender. The crispy pork belly was crunchy & delicious.  It's clear that it's a neighborhood favorite because it was VERY busy and it was only 5pm. I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Y'all, this place is the real deal.  We didn't know what to expect, but everything was wonderful. We had the pork belly, pulled pork & fire chicken along with the Ramen mac & cheese, pimento corn cheese, and bao buns.  Everything comes family style on a big tray, and you should definitely bring some friends if you want to get the most out of your experience. I can't wait to go back & try some of the other menu items. The service was very friendly and fast, and you can sample the beers to see if you like them before you decide. Great atmosphere & even better food!"}
{"text":"Really had high expectations for this place, and they came up short. The atmosphere was cool and the menu looked great.  The food came out almost immediately and is really missed the mark with me. The wings were decent and the sauce was good on them, cooked pretty well. Also got the beef ribs and the pork belly and they were really just ok. Nothing remotely special or unique about either of them. The Bao buns were also just ok, and the ramen mac n cheese was decent."}
{"text":"Love their wings and tacos, not so much the sides.  Service has been excellent every time I have gone."}
{"text":"Amazing place , delicious food. Very friendly staff . For sure we will back soon ."}
{"text":"I had half an order of chicken with spicy  bbq sauce and cheese. I also had some Cajun spiced potatoes that were nice and crispy. 
My friend had a taco but it was full of cabbage and she was not impressed!"}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch in a Friday. Fantastic ginger wings. Fantastic tacos. Had a egg nog beer drink...., phenomenal! Not one for sweet dongle/ beers but this was great. Fiery Chicken not so much of a hit. Will be back. Great ambiance great service."}
{"text":"I work on a project here in town and recently found this place. I tend to go with a large group as we work late at times and it's nice that my team gets to share a meal and have some fun. Today was my fourth visit in the past month and every time we go we drop at least $300-400 and overtip our waiter (Kevin, who is awesome). We went tonight with a party of 9 and was joking with the waitress (Victoria) that it was the second time they were out of young coconut for their coconut soju and we really like them. We ordered 4 tonight. She came back with only 2 and the other 2 were in shakers and said that we were to be charged $15 for them. We told her that when we were there previously with Kevin, we were only charged for $10. Somehow awhile later the General Manager came and asked us why we were giving Victoria a hard time, which we weren't. We just said we were previously charged for them at $10. He went on to say that it could not be true and we must have remembered it wrong because they don't have that price point and that we were being confrontational and he will leave us to it. Wow! I am floored at the lack of professionalism in food service even after we said it was fine to charge us the $15. We were insulted and the General Manager, David, can use some education in servicing paying customers. I did speak with Victoria when I paid the bill to make sure she understands that we were not giving her a hard time and she totally gets it. David was rude and has lost the business of our team at dine-ins, team events, and take out. Too bad you are losing customers this way."}
{"text":"When I came to Seoul food yesterday, I came expecting good food. I got that, and more. The food was incredible, especially the BEEF RIB!!!! And my server Francis was one of the best I've had. He knew exactly what was good, and he let our table know the most popular items on the menu. He was there exactly when we needed, and dances when he leaves the table. Good food, good service, good people."}
{"text":"Awesome addition to the Gold District. Limited menu since it was their 2nd night. The pulled pork and chicken wings were outstanding. Especially enjoyed the side pickles and daikon. Looking forward to repeat visits as the menu grows. Also hoping for more kimchee options in the future. Baby friendly."}
{"text":"Simply put, overrated. I've been here about 4 times & the pinnacle of my admiration for this place was visit #1, mainly because it's a bit different that other restaurants in Charlotte. What you will find is that the actual \"meats\" here are quite good, however all of the (overpriced) sides are not so good. So if you just go for the meats & are not concerned with sides (the menu is a la carte) then you might love this place but for me the sides are equally important. Atmosphere is nice, I just see it as a once  year kinda place due to the strange (to me) asian/southern fusion flavor to all their offerings & their lack of solid side options."}
{"text":"The lack of service and courtesy for repeated loyal business customers from the GM David is unseen before, esp for a Korean restaurant. They just lost at least $9600 of business in the next few months plus tips thanks to the terrible service experience."}
{"text":"Fantastic change of pace from the typical restaurant. I've loved almost everything I've had. Beef rib wasn't particularly for me but the flavor was still fantastic. Don't sleep on the sides, they're amazing. Not-so-secret pro tip: Get the bbq pork, bao buns, and kimchi slaw and put it all together and you've got yourself an amazing Korean pork bbq sandwich."}
{"text":"This place was awesome. We went on our way to the Charlotte Airport, only 15 minutes away. It's a cool mix between Korean food and southern food. The Korean sauces used for dipping the meat was incredible. Not to mention the wide variety of craft beers on tap. You can't go wrong here. I only wish we had one of these up here in NY."}
{"text":"Love this place, and the service is great. It's an eclectic mix of Korean and southern food, and it works. I feel like there are plenty of good things on the menu to satisfy those looking for an authentic Korean taste. They have good soju as well."}
{"text":"Piggy, crunch, wings, spice, sweets, service--what's not to love, especially when they're done this well by people who love doing it?  Start with still-popping pork crackling, lightly enhanced with sriracha dust and enough for all four of us (eat the half-pops first), followed by everyone sharing belly pork, ramen mac, sweet potato bird's nest (which could pass for desert in a pinch), fire chicken (not all that fiery but amazingly flavorful), both kinds of wings (all flat available) that may not be \"Korean\" but sure were good, and bulgogi spring rolls--all served by the most helpful wait staff we've seen in a long, long time.  Anthony G. was superb and another gent (probably a manager) who asked us how stuff was, immediately got us even crisper pork belly (with still-juicy meat) at no extra charge.  They obviously aim to please, completely.  Fusion has become an overused cliche, but here it very aptly describes Southern style cooking of Korean favorites emphasizing the best of both worlds."}
{"text":"Great all around experience. The staff here couldn't have been more courteous. The food was great. The atmosphere was relaxed and inviting. Thoroughly enjoyed our first time here. My wife and I tried several items off the menu to get a sampling of all they had. Everything we tried, from the wings, short ribs, pork cracklings, pork belly, and kimchi slaw was tasty. Will def be coming back, and look forward to their future expansion."}
{"text":"Best wings we've ever had!  Tofu was fantastic, too!  Sides were good too--slaw was great, broccoli salad was boring.  Bao buns went well with the meal.  The green tea biscuits were a perfect end.  Cool Korean music and vibe. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Gave this a try with some friends for lunch. Yes, it's on the pricy side and everything is a la carte, but the lychee soju, fried chicken, and kimchi slaw were on point. Our server was friendly and helpful. 

Food is family style and delicious!"}
{"text":"Unique spot with great food!  And my server was outstanding.  As was the manager who checked in a couple of times to make sure everything was going well.  Overall, made to feel especially welcome at Seoul Food.

Ok - the food.  Pork belly was succulent and tender with just the right amount of crispiness on the skin. Portions are huge so go with a group if possible.  Or be prepared for leftovers that taste as good or better on Day 2.  Deviled eggs were delish and the sweet potato bird's nest (I think that's the name of the dish) was inventive while being quite tasty.  For a drink, I had a  margarita made with a hint of pineapple.  Worked for me!

Give it a try - well worth a first look...and a second look and...well, you get the idea."}
{"text":"Great pork belly great spare ribs great service great atmosphere best barbecue we've had in  a while."}
{"text":"Great food! Their ramen mac and cheese, fire roasted chicken and potato swirls were amazing!! I would highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Well, bad customer service can really ruin an experience. We ordered takeout tonight for the first time and got a few items to try. The pulled pork was decent as was the spiral potato. Upon recommendation from the manager, my husband ordered the beef rib. The rib had so much fat and no meat that it was completely inedible. The fat wasn't even soft, it was hard and chewy. My husband called the restaurant to tell them and the gentleman who answered the phone said he had to talk to his manager and would call back. He calls back to say that we can come back in for a replacement. After seeing the first rib, no one in their right mind would want a replacement. It was also inconvenient for us
to drive back. Lastly, the manager should have called back to correct the situation and at least refund the rib. Ah well, at least we have dinner for our dog."}
{"text":"Interesting food... good food...definitely not traditional Korean BBQ. I will be back to try more of the menu. Loved the pork belly and the ramen mac n cheese. Food is served family style."}
{"text":"This restaurant was very yummy! My boyfriend and I went there last night (on a Sunday) and we LOVED it. No wait / YES we liked that!
We ordered crispy pork belly, ramen mac & cheese, wings and bulgogi sausage. This was PLENTY of food for 2. 
The wings were our favorite, then the crispy pork belly - would get both again!! 
Good prices, cool atmosphere. 
Service was a just OK but not bad. Need more napkins, please!"}
{"text":"Very interesting concept. Great Korean-southern fusion foods in a sport bar environment. It's great to come with a big group so you can order many things on the menu.  We devoured the whole Tilapia that is really crispy and tasty ( a must have). The beef ribs is great to eat with the Bao. Pork belly could be better if they use piglets (thinner skin and less fat). The wings are slightly too big. However, they are still very flavorful. Definitely going back there with friends."}
{"text":"Definitely a place for those who like \"loud\" music and drinking. For those korean food lovers, sorry this is not the place for you. The food was kind of blend. Fried chicken wings needed more time to marinate. Crispy pork belly's flavor was lacking. The cheese sauce in mac n cheese ramen was blend."}
{"text":"Amazing! I was a little sceptical going in as I had never tried foods such as pork belly, but it was incredibly delicious! I loved all of the food I tried except for the Ram 'n' Cheese (it was ok, just not something I'd personally recommend). Everything else was great! The pork belly, sweet potatoe bird nest, soy garlic wings - outstanding! The service was great as well. Being my first time here, the food they recommend was delictable and they were very friendly. I definitely recommend eating at Seoul Food Meet Co."}
{"text":"I was so excited to have had the opportunity to check this place out with a group of fellow Yelpers!

I loved the set up inside. It was a nice night, so the garage door was open, giving us a nice breeze and feel like we were kinda outside some. It's a fairly small spot but there seemed to be a decent amount of tables inside, along with a bar that had indoor and outdoor seating at the bar.

For a drink, I went with the white wine cocktail (mainly cause someone else ordered it and I just didn't want to make a decision of choosing off their decent drink list). My husband got the yogurt soju, at the recommendation of our waitress. As we were soju virgins, we didn't exactly know what to expect. Guys, this drink was amazing!! It came out smoking in a cocktail shaker and they give you a few shot glasses to drink it out of. Next time I want to try the watermelon or pineapple soju, as I heard they serve it literally out of the fruit. The sojus are totally worth the money!

My husband and I ordered the 6 wings (half and half for sauces), the pork belly, the pimento corn cheese and the potato swirl. Our meal came out on a metal tray.....perfect for sharing, which is great for a date night or in a big group. Our group passed around items as well, so I got to try a few more foods. The pork belly was spot on delish and well cooked. The potato swirl was a highlight. I think it had something to do with the seasoning. The wings were super large sized....aka, order less than you can eat of normal wings. I liked both the sauces and would definitely recommend the half and half.

Service was excellent. Great new spot and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Go during the weekday happy hour for a great deal on all the sides. Smoked wings are great as are the side but the pork and chicken are just ok. Favorite sided, deviled eggs, Ramen Mac and potato swirls. Also very dog friendly patio with dog play area."}
{"text":"Great fusion bbq food with fun and energetic staff to fit the atmosphere. Location in the heart of the Gold District makes this a prime place to start off your night with dinner and then bar hop through the area. Soccer-pool out back is a blast as well. Recommended to all"}
{"text":"I've been here twice in the last couple of weeks. Once for lunch. I loved it so much that I brought my sister and BIL for dinner. After my experience last night though, I probably won't be coming as often. THEIR HOSTESS WAS ATROCIOUS. She sat us at a 4 person table, after we told her there were 6 of us. She told us she couldn't combine tables, when we saw a waitress moving tables apart. None of this bothered us as much, however, as her attitude.

If you look past the hostess, the rest of our experience was great. Their waitstaff were friendly and attentive both visits. The highlight was definitely their wings. My husband and I preferred the soy garlic, my sister and BIL the spicy BBQ. Also enjoyed their kimchi fries and deviled eggs. My kids seemed to like their kim bap, which was loaded with meat."}
{"text":"This place is good, but bonchon has better KFC. Its a nice place to go and hang out with friends. I recommend people check this place out."}
{"text":"Just ate here for the first time for my wife's birthday. Don't listen to the negative reviews, this place is amazing. We had the wings (both ways) crispy pork belly, bao buns, and ramen Mac and cheese. Everything was great. Perfectly seasoned, tons of flavor. The buns were perfect for the pork belly. It's a family style service, so make sure you don't order too much and it won't be too expensive.  Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"It started off with great service and ended with excellent food! I woke up the next day craving everything I tried at Seoul. My only disappointment was getting full too fast. The wings, fried to crispy perfection and tossed in some of the best sauce ever, lived up to the hype. I'm not even sure how one chooses what to have amongst so much of an interesting selection. We rock paper scissored our way to the bulgogi kimbab, baby back ribs, Kimchi fries, and pork belly spring roll! I was in hog heaven (literally)! I can't wait to go back and try as much as my tummy will allow me to have!"}
{"text":"I can't speak for the food but the service was awful when we came here to try it out for Valentine's Day. We were seated and someone came over and told us about the food and drink specials and the drinks were promptly brought back. After that, we looked over the menus and decided what we both wanted. This is when I started to get aggravated. People were running around like chickens with their heads cut off and our table was completely ignored for over 15 minutes while we just sat there and waited. The funny thing was it seemed like no one was really working that hard to help the actual people seated. Everyone seemed to be disorganized and looking around the restaurant, I wasn't the only one who looked annoyed by the way things were going. We decided to cut our losses and leave and go somewhere else. Based on the bad experience, I will not be returning ever again. It also gives me a bad perception of their new restaurant \"Let's Meat\" opening next door since it will be ran by the same individuals."}
{"text":"Every time I eat here I'm amazed how it tastes the same! They don't skip a beat. The food is GREAT every time! I've tried almost everything but they have the best wings I've ever ate!"}
{"text":"Tried this place last night..it was really good. Great for 4-8 people as it kind of serves family style..I will definitely be back, great atmosphere and good food. The soy garlic wings were really good with the most crispy skin on chicken I've ever seen, try them and you'll see what I mean...kimchi slaw was great, sweet potato birds nest great, pimento corn was different but great also."}
{"text":"LOVE the environment here - it is so fun hanging out outside, playing pong or one of their other games. Really unique drinks and large beer selection. 
However, ask for clarification on their menu items before ordering and accidentally eating pork for the first time in 10 years like I did. they were so sweet and accommodating about it after I explained to them what had happened."}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoy the atmosphere and the wings and crispy pork belly are delicious. The service is great as well."}
{"text":"Okay this is not a fair review because I haven't actually tasted any food. Got here at 4:30 and was seated at 4:50. It is now 6:25 and we have not been served. No way this restaurant can survive unless they get their act together. I don't care how good the food is --they never should have opened if they were not prepared."}
{"text":"Great people, awesome atmosphere. Karaoke is a blast there. The good is a little different, but I'm excited to hear that they are adding an authentic KBBQ."}
{"text":"Went for the first time. The whole tilapia was delicious, the ramen mac was ok, not much flavor. The soy garlic wings were good. The taco was amazing! The dirty rice was good and the sweet potato birds nest was difficult to eat as it was super crunch and couldn't really scoop it up.

Service was ok, nothing spectacular.

The music that was on was super vulgar. I'm not an anti vulgar words or anything but when I'm eating a meal I don't need the music blasting the F word the entire time. That's what was on. 

I will def go back for the tacos and to try other things too."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times and although their wait for drinks can be crazy at times, it's not enough to deter me. 

Their fruit punch beer is super refreshing and since I'm a creature of habit, this is usually what I get here. I've tried a few of their mixed drinks and soju concoctions when friends got it and they were delicious, except for their fruit punch mixed drink but ya know, to each his own and all that. 

Aside from their drinks, their food is dooope. You really can't go wrong with their kimchi pork tacos, fire chicken, wings, or green tea sugar biscuits. 

They even have a dog park and games outside so bring your fur babies, play some games, and enjoy their food and drinks."}
{"text":"We had been waiting for this restaurant to open up for weeks and were so excited once they finally opened up their doors this past Saturday.  Unfortunately we were not impressed, and it was obvious that this restaurant was not ready to open.  We arrived around 7:30 and were told that they would only be serving $20 sample platters for 2 and with only select menu items.  This was pretty disappointing because my husband was so excited to come here to try the Korean bbq wings and they were not on the platter.  The platters of food were served only about 5 minutes or less after ordering, before our drinks, without silverware (had to wait for more to be cleaned), and without even hardly being able to speak more than a few words to the two friends that came with us.  Normally it is great for food to come out quickly, but the platters of food looked very sloppy and were served cold, which was surprising since they came out so quickly-- we're assuming we probably just got food that had been sitting out for a while.  The beef rib was delicious.  I was not a fan of the chicken or ham on the 
platter (may be better if warm). 

The mixed drinks were okay, but we thought it was a little odd that the menu did not list what ingredients/alcohol were actually in the drinks so we had to go down the entire list and asked what was in each one, which just seemed like a waste of time.  An entire glass of water was spilled on my husband with a minimal apology, but we just chalked this up to it being their opening night.  

Taking into account that this was their opening night I am giving three stars, but it was more of a two star experience.  I am not sure if we will try Seoul again based on this experience, but I am hoping some positive reviews will come out once the kinks are worked through so that maybe we can consider giving it a second chance."}
{"text":"Great place! Was in the area and just randomly decided to try it! Got the fried chicken half and half (spicy bbq and soy garlic) and the fries and it was delicious! Would definitely return"}
{"text":"After freshening up from completing the Spartan race, we needed a spot that would satisfy our pallets and our appetite. I found this place on Yelp and we hit the jackpot. From the menu on the site, we already knew what we were going to order. Everything, and I mean everything we ordered was flavorful and savory.  We ordered the Pork kimbap, soy garlic and spicy bbq wings, ram n cheese, fish tacos, pulled pork, potato rings, soy pickled devil eggs, and you have to partner the Bao bread with the pulled pork and kimchi bbq sauce. As I'm writing this review, I want to go back right now but it's an hr in a half away. Let's just say I will be making my way back in the next 30 days. Did I mention it was a Saturday night but the wait was only 30 when they told us an hr? By the way, GO DAWGS!!!  loved the flag"}
{"text":"Its a great place for families and big groups.  Its a modern day twist to korean food.  As food comes in smalls or large family sizes where you can share.  Bogulgi Taco was terrific and a must have, to bad its just one taco per serving.  I had to order more.  The chilli ramen noodle dish was good too."}
{"text":"i love love love this restaurant the fried tilapia is amazing as well as the sides literally got full for a reasonable amount, second time being there and it was as amazing as the first"}
{"text":"If you are ever in Charlotte North Carolina make sure to check out this place! 

The ambience is great for groups of all ages. Even four legged friends are welcome and will have there own area to play! 

I traveled recently to this restaurant with my bf. It was a Saturday afternoon and the weather was perfect. Parking was very easy to find and the wait was not long at all. As we are waiting had some fun at the word search glass. Nice touch!

We were greeted right away by our waiter who offered Everton the menu! He was very friendly and helpful with some of the items!

He recommended some great items! We tried the beef rib with an order of the best wings!! Kimichi fries were a great touch! I ordered the Pineapple Soju! It's supposed to be for sharing but I was able to enjoy it on my own! We were stuffed! 

During the meal we were greeted by the owners Tim and Lisa! They were so nice to come and check on us.

As we finished our meal, we checked out the outside area. As we walked around back, we were shocked to see KTV!!! Karaoke!! They had several rooms that can get the party started! We went outside to see a bar with their very own beer! Lots to choose from, I tried the grapefruit beer! So yummy!  As we were drinking we played a game of connect four and giant jenga! They also had corn hole and soccer pool! So cute! And did I mention the doggy area?!

Had a great time here and will definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"I love love love this place! From the location, the decor,  the hospitality, 
 the staff, and of course the main event, the FOOD!

It took me a while to get in this place but when I finally got the chance to come I haven't stopped going back!! The service is always great here. Server menu knowledge is always on point and are always willing to give suggestions. Food is served on a large tray and everything can be shared, so I suggest you get a few different things, trust me there will be plenty of food! I started with the pineapple beer that they have on tap which I find pairs well with most dishes but I'm sure any of their options are great. I go for the collards which have jalapenos which gives it a nice but not over whelming kick. I have had both the Kim Chili Ramen Mac and the Ram N Cheese both are great cant go wrong with either! Now, the meat! I have had the kimchi pork spare ribs which were fall off the bone tender and juicy! I haven't had the chance to try the beef ribs but I'm sure they are phenomenal! I also had both flavors of wings (soy garlic, spicy BBQ), while both of these are undeniably delicious and  super crispy, I am sold on the spicy BBQ, sooo good! Now to my personal favorite the Kim Baps! sushi rolls (although they look very similar) don't have nothing on these babies! My favorite is the Fire Squid, these little suckers are bite size yet hold so much flavor! Absolute must have! I will be trying the beef rib nigiri kim bap next! I'm always full by the time dessert comes around but they do have dessert options. This place is just all around good! I have made it my personal mission to have every single thing on this menu and I cannot wait to go back! 10's across the board Seoul!!!!"}
{"text":"The food is ok, good when we're all drunk. Great drinks.  I like the karaoke section but it's too expensive. You can spend 200$ easily with food and drinks. 30-100 an hr?? Too much. Came to this place cus I heard saigon night closed down. If it wasn't for the price we would've been a regular customer. We will Def be back but maybe once a month."}
{"text":"So my experience here was not the best. My friends and I made reservations for a large group of 6, because one person was running 10 minutes late they refused to seat us. Then once that person arrived we waited for two hours before being sat. During our wait we were told that we were just waiting for another group of people to get up to be sat. The disheartening thing is that the hostesses were sitting smaller parties in the middle of open tables that could have easily been used for our party. The food was nothing to rave about and I was let down with its quality. When time to receive our checks we all voiced that the gratuity that was tacked onto our checks was doubled. We had to notify the server and we were told that the system did it by itself. They changed the amount and we paid. Scary how many people probably paid double the gratuity because they didn't notice it. I don't think I will be back. Nor would I recommend it."}
{"text":"Mediocre food, at best. Absolutely terrible service. We ate and drank at the outside bar where two dudes struggled to handle the work load. And it certainly wasn't busy by traditional standards. We ordered the ramen mac and cheese as one of our sides and they brought out something that looked liked ramen with Wendy's chili poured over it. We immediately said we didn't order that and we won't eat it. The kid bartender said that's what we ordered and he can't switch it out, nor take it off the bill. I said we ordered the mac and cheese ramen, so bring it out. I wasn't going to argue. He would simply have to pay for it out of his tip. Perhaps he should write orders down if he can't remember them. Then as we were eating, we watched him do the same thing to a girl who ordered a drink. She told him she didn't order that drink, and again he said he can't take it off the bill. The drink sat on top of the cooler for 10 minutes and then he sold it to someone else. Smh. 
As for the food, the brisket was on the dry side, lacked natural flavor, and had far too much fat. Both ramen dishes were underwhelming and basic. The pulled pork wasn't awful, but definitely forgettable. The pimento corn cheese was a tiny, tiny portion with way too many \"chips\" that were made of shrimp but were more like pork rinds. The fully loaded potato salad's flavor was bland, yet dominated by the taste of cucumber. 
This place was such a disappointment."}
{"text":"The soy garlic wings are life!!! We also had the Ram and chz and Collard greens both of which I highly recommend. The kimchi fries were ok the fries themselves in the dish were a little too greasy for my liking. Pork spare ribs very tender and delicious! We will def be back!!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time last night and was very impressed! I had been to a place like this in Brooklyn and loved it, but Seoul blew it out of the water!

The cocktail and drink list is really creative and fun and they have a broad selection.

There were 3 of us and we got:
Pulled pork (small) - DELICIOUS!!!
Fire chicken (small) - really good
Half and half wings  (large)- they are SO crispy and the sauces are delicious, a little on the sweet side, but I have never had better tasting wings in my life
Buns- the best!!
Ramen Mac and cheese- cool concept, really different, wasn't a huge fan but it was still good
The fried potato skewer- this was so different and SO good!

This is such a fun and different place that has incredible food! This was one of the most memorable dining experiences I've ever had and I can't wait to go back.
All of the employees were very friendly as well and the restaurant itself is gorgeous!"}
{"text":"I was born and raised in Koreatown Los Angeles. Had a business trip out to NC and was looking for a local Korean place to try. Stopped by here for an amazing experience. The food was delicious. Really interesting takes on traditional Korean dishes. It would be really successful here in LA as well. I spread the word to all ,y East Coast Korean peeps to swing by and try this place. I'll try to look for my photos of the food."}
{"text":"The food was really good and the service was excellent. Our waiter was really attentive and seemed to really care about our experience. It is definitely a place to order and then share. The atmosphere is casual and the service is really quick. It is more of a fast casual dinning experience than I was expecting, but I will be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and great ambiance. The music is pleasant. The large size ribs is massive. I will definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful and delicious! The drinks are great and staff and bartenders are super friendly!"}
{"text":"I was at this spot on Thursdays night I had a great time the food was great right on long with the service David and Tony was the bomb I will be back with my crew I love you guys"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte. I highly recommend the crispy pork and beef rib. The chicken wings are also amazing. Really can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to write a review for the longest. 

Food- I dont have any complaints about anything on the menu.  The wings are always hot and the sauce is unique.  I recently tried the green tea cornbread  (Im glad I did) it was soooo delicious.  I wouldnt have ever thought to put those two together. Kimbap (not sushi) is also a musy try. I enjoy the fire chicken with a side of fire sauce. I haven't had the opportunity to try the main dishes ,but its extremely hard to when their wings are so good. 

Service - It tends to be a little slow at times yet the servers are still friendly and welcoming. This may come during their peak hrs. They are attentive and prompt when it comes to bringing out your food and making sure you have what you need. 

Overall, I enjoy the atmosphere and food everytime I visit!"}
{"text":"This place is a nightmare. If you want to wait 20 minutes for a drink, this is the place. How about staffing more than two bartenders in the back. Not to mention they are about the rudest thing ever.  Avoid at all cost..."}
{"text":"This is easily some of the best food I have had in my entire life! And I have had a lot of food...

We came on a Saturday evening and were seated immediately. This is not a testament to their popularity, we just happened to hit the \"sweet spot\" for getting a seat. Within 15 minutes, the place was packed!

We ordered the Crispy Pork Belly and the Fire Chicken for our meats. For our sides, we chose the Soy Pickled Deviled Eggs, Chili Ramen, and Bao Buns. 

I'll start with the meat: The Crispy Pork Belly was prepared perfectly. Crispy on the edges and soft on the inside. It was like eating bacon on steroids, and I can not think about it without my mouth watering. As for the Fire Chicken: I have never had chicken that tastes this good! The chicken had a spicy and smoky flavor and was perfectly moist. Plus, it was smothered in cheese!

The sides were also good, but not the stars of the show. The Bao Buns were nice and fluffy and served plain to use as a catalyst for eating the meat. The chili that was served atop the Ramen had a good flavor, but I would probably try another side the next time we dine here. However, the Soy Pickled Deviled Eggs were delicious! I will never pickle my eggs in vinegar again. Soy it is!

And last, but not least, let me tell you about the alcohol: we ordered the Apple Soju which is served in a shaker with 2 small glasses. As with Saki, you pour for the other person, never for yourself. Slightly carbonated, drinking the Soju was like drinking apple soda. Fantastic! 

For those who like to stick to beer, I would recommend the Blueberry Lager. It is served with fresh blueberries and tastes like blueberry soda. They seem to have a knack for serving alcohol that doesn't taste like alcohol... dangerous...

In closing: Go here! Eat, drink, and be merry!"}
{"text":"Service was good. Food was OK until about 20 minutes later. My stomach was upset for hours and I became violently ill. I'm never going back."}
{"text":"I love Seoul! Great environment and awesome food. Get the ramen and the BBQ. go when it's nice out and play games and enjoy some drinks. I've tried pretty much everything on the menu which is why I'm giving 4 stars. Otherwise I would give 5 for my favorites. You should definitely go. It's a fun hang out spot and something different for food in charlotte."}
{"text":"I absolutely fell in love with this place.  I took a girl here on our first date and needless to say, thank God I did.  The ambiance was great.  I loved their take on Korean bbq.  We were so stuffed and on cloud nine that I felt that I could have taken over the world one Korean rib at a time.  Charlotte foodies.  Give this place a shot.  It's on my list of places to revisit when I make it back to the east coast."}
{"text":"Not a huge fan of their food- a few items I'd recommend though are the wings, ramen mac and potato swirl.  Its a perfect place in the spring and summer to take advantage of their big patio in the back- a lot of games for you and your friends to play! Reasonable drink prices and if it rains when the employees get into work, all draft beers are half off for the entire day!"}
{"text":"Just came here for a quick Korean fusion fix and left with happy tummies. The atmosphere is nice with open garage doors, tv to watch the game, and open bar with dog friendly outdoor patio. The menu is creative and the food had the Korean flavor mixed with southern BBQ twist. The portion size of the meat was filling. My husband and I ordered 2 meats and 3-4 sides and couldn't finish it all. The restaurant is only 10 mins from the panthers stadium and has ample parking lot in the back. The servers were friendly and we received our food within 10 minutes of ordering (we were here Sunday lunch time.) I definitely recommend this place and the area is quite nice with brewery and coffee shop close by. My favorite was the chicken wings...has a great crunch to it!"}
{"text":"The perfect combination of the Asian/American BBQ. The food is made family style and served on a tray to be shared. The crispy pork and fire chicken were cook just right and the portions are great for the price. I absolutely loved the sauce pairing with the meat. I didn't get to try many sides but the kimichi slaw and sweet potato nest did not disappoint. Service was quick and friendly. I highly recommend this place but come with a big appetite!"}
{"text":"Excellent fusion bbq, we tried the pork belly and the sides with kimchi fries and spiral potato. The bbq was savory and tasty. As they state on the website it's fusion not traditional Korean bbq. I enjoyed the crunch of the pork belly and the bbq sauce. The kimchi fries were the best combo of kimchi, sauce and potatoes. I enjoyed the flavors.
The spiral potato had spices for the sauce, came on a skewer and had amazing flavor.  Good service and cool modern decorations at Seoul!

The soju alcohol drink was like a yummy sour patch kid flavor, you drink in shot glasses. The entree comes in family style so be prepared to share. We liked the food and one entree and two sides was plenty of food for two. 
They had a parking lot behind the building, easy for lunch."}
{"text":"Seoul offers a very interesting combination of Korean and Southern food. The beef ribs has a nice flavored and cooked perfectly. The crispy belly is tasty and the skin is very crispy without being oily. If you like noodle and Mac and cheese, you need to try he ramen and cheese. The died wings are huge size and very crispy!!. We had yummy green tea ice cream for dessert. It's fried doughnuts filled with green tea ice cream."}
{"text":"It is always a great time when we come. The food is very unique and take some of our friends out of their comfort zone. Even though they don't know what kind of food it's going to be they always leave happy. Are usually get the pulled pork which is always delicious. This time I got the baked mac & cheese which was very very good. The service is always great, I can never complain. And they usually have a few drinks specials going on. If you're in the Charlotte area it is definitely worth A visit. I wouldn't make it you're only stop if you only have one night in Charlotte. But it should definitely be on your shortlist if you're here for a while."}
{"text":"This is good but wasn't what I was expecting. This is Korean-American food not Korean food. It's kind of street food with Korean tacos etc.. The staff were friendly, there is only street parking. It was good but wouldn't go again as I don't like the street style food with American twist."}
{"text":"decent wings, good beer. ill prob go back..."}
{"text":"This is my first time at Seoul meat company. First of all our server was nice but not attentive. Had to get up a couple of times to ask for napkins at the bar. 
Now the food.... 
We ordered crispy pork, Kim Chi ribs, brisket taco 
The pork was ok, ribs lack Kim chi flavor big time, and the taco was the best of the meal. 
We ordered collard greens as a side and asked several times for vinegar.  Finally our server told us that they don't have vinegar or she is not allow to give out vinegar. Really? But she did offered salt instead. LOL. 

But at least she was friendly."}
{"text":"This restraunt all around awesome!
The restaurant is a Korean BBQ place with delicious twists. I came with my family to try it for dinner one Friday. The food can be family style or single (but family is more what it's meant for). We ordered the fire chicken, fried pork belly, and half/half of the wings for our entree and pimento corn, kimchi slaw, and a spiraled potato as sides. All of which were VERY good. At the end of the night we did agree that all the entrees we're worth ordering again and the spiraled potato. Definitely will be coming back to try the rest of the menu.
The ambience is nice, and there is K-pop music and videos. The wait staff was very helpful, kind, and timely."}
{"text":"Okay so I saw some reviews which were not pleased with messiness of eating. I saw a review which panned the flavors. Well I decided it was different and I didn't mind messy so I would check it out. I am in town for work for a couple weeks. I have had some good food. I have had some bad food. You'd was neither.

The food was very very good. 

I had the fire chicken and ramen mac and cheese. 

The chicken was some of the most tender chicken I have had, ever. (I travel for work, about 250 days a year).

The sauce on the chicken was incredible. The sauce on the side not only was very hot but had great flavor. Amazing!

The ramen mac was good. Sure it may be improved but overall, very nice.

The service was impeccable. The stars was attentive but not too attentive. Service was quick. The food came out fast. 

The prices were fair and overall it was one of the two best experiences I have had dining in Charlotte. 

Oh and that fire side sauce? If they decide to bottle it, I will order by the case."}
{"text":"Seoul Food Meat Company is truly as good as it gets.

I've had a couple of dreams about how good their wings are. Like legitimately I've told people in my dreams that they have to have the best KFC wings and that would be at Seoul.

The atmosphere of the entire restaurant is pretty upbeat and fun, with open seating, a good bar area, and TV's all over the place. I'd say if you're in a hurry, come back when you've got some time to spend to appreciate the food because this food deserves your time and full attention. Also side note, it gets pretty packed here so it's not really an in and out kind of place.

I started off the night with the pineapple margarita. I'm not much of a pineapple fan, but I thought this was pretty delicious, especially with the coffee/sugar around the rim. Definitely a unique spin on it! Probably could have had a little more booze, but it was tasty nonetheless.

Once we were seated, we ordered the kimchi fries and the crispy pork belly. The kimchi fries were so good and a great way to start. They're pretty messy so it's fun reaching in to the middle of the table with your fork or fingers to get the fries over to your side of the table. 

The crispy pork belly actually surprised me a little bit. I'm usually not the biggest fan of pork belly only because it usually has so much fat left that hadn't been rendered down. It was NOT the case here, and each piece really was crispy on one end and super tender on the other. The sauce served with it was perfect.

Now for the main star of the evening. The WINGS. There really isn't that much to say other than the flavor is a 10 and the crunch is a 10. We got half and half soy garlic/spicy. I wasn't the biggest fan of the spicy but hands down the soy garlic were the best wings of my life. If that's what you want, come here.

I'll be back very soon to have those sweet, sweet wings. There's a bunch of other sides that need exploration, too. CAN'T WAIT."}
{"text":"Hands down the best wings. I love the positive vibe there. I'm always happy when I leave there. The staff are happy and strike up friendly conversation. One of the most trendy places in Charlotte with an outstanding menu."}
{"text":"We went for 2 birthdays and the service was excellent!!! We took our waiters recommendations to order and everything was great. Love that it was family-share style. The drinks were creative and so yummy!"}
{"text":"Told no.  


This place is great.. I come for beers all the time, but I went to eat there for the the first time and was not taken care of. I explicitly asked \"are the spicy bbq wings really hot or not really?\" They only have two flavors so I was thinking maybe they were medium spice. And our waitress said nah you can handle it they're not that spicy. They were hot as fuck and I couldn't eat them. Asked if I could have the other flavor and the manager said yeah if you pay for more. Wowwww. I just wanted something I could actually eat. 

Told no."}
{"text":"The best chicken wings I've ever eaten were at this place.  So good I went back twice while I was in Charlotte.  I ordered them with the soy ginger sauce.  They were perfectly breaded with just the right amount of breading.   They were crunchy.  They meat was juicy with flavor.  Oh and there was a great amount of meat on the bones.  Sauce was perfect. Not too hot. Not too sweet.  Oh my goodness perfect.  Did I mention the best wings I've ever eaten.   Get them here.  I also ate some of their ramen and cheese (think mac me cheese) seemed a bit dry but had a great flavor.  We tried a variety of things on the menu but kept coming back to how delicious the wings are.   This place is busy.  Super busy.  Go early or prepare to wait. They have an outside space(two of them actually) the bar was great.  Drinks were different with great prices. Only disappointing thing that happened was because they were so busy I decided to get a to go order.   After I got my food and was ready to leave they opened the outdoor space.  Big Enough for everyone who was waiting if they wanted to sit outside.  So I asked if I could sit outside as well and eat my food.  They said no that I would need to go ahead and leave.  The girl even checked w the manager.  No, he said, I needed to leave.   So.  I did.  This won't stop me from going there again and ordering chicken wings.  But thought it was a bit short sighted on their part.  I would've bought drinks from the bar and would have ordered more food.  Oh, well, lesson learned."}
{"text":"Caught them at the end of their four thirty to five thirty dollar side special . I ordered the spicy garlic soy wings spicy barbecue wings and the kimchi fries. I really enjoyed the soy garlic wings they were crispy with nice flavor. Kimchi fries could use some improvement. The fries were not hot and were soggy. The kimichi topping lacked flavor. l would visit again for the soy garlic wings."}
{"text":"We love this place !! The wings are amaze !! I can't wait to book one of their Karaoke rooms. Only think I would say is they need to polish up the hosting part, we go there a lot and every time there's some sort of mistake with wait times and seating. Since the food and atmosphere is so good we are willing to look over that part ;)"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our lunch here on Fathers Day. Good beer selection, nice cocktail menu. The food was awesome especially the insanely big and impossibly crispy wings. Seriously how do they get them so crispy! The Kimchi braised pork ribs were good, tender, and meaty with a very tasty red dipping sauce. The whole fried crispy Tilapia was also excellent and had a nice spicy kick to it. The ramen mac n cheese was interesting and had a nice kick to it as well. Birds nest fried sweet potato was amazing. The deviled eggs are a must try as I've never tasted anything quite like them. Service was exceptional and we look forward to our return."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure what to expect with Seoul Food but I hadn't read the reviews yet. The space is very casual and just as we sat down they dimmed the lights and cranked up the KPop music that accompanied the sexy videos on the TV monitors. Unfortunately the music became too loud to talk to each other but the videos did want me to break it down SYTYCD style. 

The menu is modular so you can mix and match meats and sides which all come out in cardboard bowls or metal trays (like pizza). Food came out pretty quickly but not all at the same time. We ordered whole fried tilapia, sweet potato birds nest, Ramen Mac & Cheese, Pulled Pork and Bao Buns. It's not the best place to be organic / soy-free / gluten-free to be honest but I took a half bite of the Ramen Mac and Cheese and it was delicious and had wonderful crunchy toppings that added some robustness to it.  Hungry man loved the pulled pork and the delicious spicy BBQ that he put in the Bao buns. The BBQ sauce is the same sauce as the wings, so I bet those are awesome. The whole tilapia came out and was dramatic. It was glazed in soy chili sauce which unfortunately I can't partake in on doctor's orders, but what I tasted of it, it was quite tasty. However because tilapia is a small fish, there wasn't much meat and it was a bit dry because much of it was stuck to the fried skin. The owner/Manager(?) Tim checked in to see how the meal was and said they're changing the menu every day and taking in feedback. I should note that the sweet potato birds nest  is good but it's really more of a dessert than a side. It's fried in rice bran oil which is great, but it is also drizzled in honey and cinnamon so it's definitely sweet. 

The mixed drinks were quite good- I had the yuzu citrusy \"jar\" which was like a lemonade with vodka and my husband got the closest thing to an Arnold Palmer which was perfect with the pulled pork! 

Next time I'd really like to try the kimchi slaw and tomato salad and we'll probably sit outside so we can have a conversation. But here's how I'll leave how Hungry Man felt about this place. \"If we ate here in another town, I'd say 'I wish we had one of these in Charlotte.'\" I think that speaks volume."}
{"text":"Ok - we got a Karaoke room. It's loud, it's expensive, it's small, but it's fun and you have a server helping you with the machine and somehow dealing with the yelling of orders over the music - with a smile! A bit of a younger atmosphere, being in Southend. We all tried several dishes and EVERYTHING was exceptional. So Much Flavor! Don't expect a light meal, but expect a some kick-butt Seoul Food!"}
{"text":"I didn't try the wings and they looked amazing, so disregard that missing last star if you are a wing person.  Also, it should be noted that this is not a Korean BBQ place, it is fusion Korean and BBQ.

I had some time to kill before meeting a buddy at a brewery and I figured this would be a great place to get a quick snack in.  I went belly up to the bar.  Super friendly bar tender.  I got the spicy tuna kimbap which wasn't exactly what I was expecting, but tasty none the less.  It looked kind of cooked?  Maybe?  I dunno.  Also got the kimchi fries.  Not quite as good as the bulgogi fries from Banh Mi brothers, but still damn good.

You could spend some money here eating, or you can eat on the cheap.  Great place for bringing broke friends or a tag along that has already ate, lol."}
{"text":"I wanted so bad to like this new spot in Southend. It is very loud in the restaurant, and tables are on top of one another. Our group was seated in a corner and literally had to squeeze between chairs to get to the table. It took our server about 15 minutes to acknowledge our presence. After ordering drinks and an appetizer, we waited 45 minutes for our drinks. The server didn't make eye contact with us, while other tables who were seated way after us were being served (and had drinks!) - the appetizer - wings - were delicious, perfect flavor, but no dipping sauce and lack of drinks didn't provide the best experience. We eventually were served water in plastic, cafeteria style cups... For the price, I expected a glass... Nonetheless. Our group finally got bar drinks after our appetizer was complete and we asked the server about our drinks... She said she would go kick the bartenders a$$??? Grapefruit beer was delish, but again, after 45 minutes I would hope so. We ordered the fire chicken and lots of sides (they were out of pulled pork) - Everything for your table is served on one tray and you serve yourself in a paper tray. Chicken was not tasty, nor did anyone really eat it. Ramen Mac and cheese was similar to ramen and cheese wiz. The Bao buns were interesting and good. Corn pimento cheese, rice, pork rinds, and slaw has way too many competing flavors that just didn't jive. While in the restaurant you will be treated??? to Asian music videos that are somewhat lewd in nature... We were confused by the purpose. If I went back, I would only have the wings and bounce. You will find better service at McD, and I hate to say it, meal, too. Will not be surprised if place does not make it."}
{"text":"I don't quite get all the hype about this place. 

I met a friend for dinner and lucky for us there were other yelpers there who had already ordered so we could see some of the goodies they tried...and they shared their sriracha cracklins with us! So nice! Also, probably the highlight of the meal. 

I thought we did a good job ordering a variety of stuff but overall I just left underwhelmed. 
Here's the run down:

Sriracha Cracklins - Great way to start the meal. Loved them! 

Potato Swirl - Pretty good. I liked whatever the coating was on them.  It's definitely an interesting take on a crispy potato. 

Half and Half Wings - These were good, but not great. There was a lot of breading. If that's not your thing...skip them. 

Crispy Pork Belly - These could have been better - they came out very dry. Not sure if that's normal or we just got a bad batch. 

Smashed Potato Salad - No. Just no. It was very runny and I'm still not sure all of what was exactly in it. 

Sausage - I forget the name of it but it was the sweeter version of the two options. Not my favorite. 

Also, our service was just okay. Our waiter kinda rushed us through ordering and didn't really explain all the menu items. So that was a bit of a letdown. And then when we said we didn't like the food, seemed a bit confused and sent another waitress over?! 

Eventually, the manager came over and apologized an asked for our feedback on what we liked and didn't like so that was a very nice touch. He seemed to really want to get our input to make the food better! But by that point I was pretty much over it. 

So...Am I glad I gave them a try? Yes. Will I be running back for a second visit? No thanks."}
{"text":"Highly recommend! I was apprehensive about a Korean bbq but now I highly recommend! The wait was about an hour so we went to the brewery next door which still could reach our pager. Our server was very friendly and helpful. The potatoes skins and Mac and cheese were delicious! I was not to happy with the fire chicken. The pineapple drink was also tasty."}
{"text":"Omg where do I start , I took my date here and they didn't only impress her but me as well. Def a good spot for first dates ."}
{"text":"Amazing ambiance outside, dog park is huge attraction for me personally. If you're going to get anything, the wings are the move. Did not love the cheese on top of the pulled chicken but the chicken itself was smoky and flavorful. The yogurt soju is wicked cool, it involves dry ice. Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Tons of food delivered on cafeteria-like trays. Delicious different tastes. Love the fire chicken and the tacos. Favorite item: kimchi ramen mac n cheese."}
{"text":"The wings are definitely five-star worthy, especially the soy garlic. They're crispy and have a lot of meat of them with great flavor. The rest of the menu is okay but doesn't have any stand out dishes. 

The atmosphere is very cool, especially the back patio where there are yard games and a big outdoor bar. They have flavored beers like pineapple the are Saporo and pineapple juice - great combo."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere here and food was decent. My family and I tried most of the menu. The only item that everyone really enjoyed was the beef ribs. So while ordinary and non-descript the meal was overall, the beef ribs were truly, truly worth the trip....."}
{"text":"Beers, Bao buns, brisket, wings, and trendy music videos. We had a nice lunch. This is a great place to stop by for lunch. We will come back."}
{"text":"Well, just got into Charlotte for the weekend for a wedding. A nice and tiring 7 hour plus drive because of all the traffic on 77 coming in. Checked into the hotel absolutely starving. At 8 PM, most things are closing so options were a bit limited. I almost just settled for ordering in pizza but decided to Yelp the area a bit first. Seoul Food came up on the first page. Read some of the reviews suggesting that it was a nice fusion between Asia and good ol' fashioned comfort food. I decided 4 stars on Yelp was worth dragging by sorry butt out of bed and make the drive out. 

At first, I thought I was in the wrong area. Then you see this building well lit. The outdoor areas had a dog park (AMAZING!), corn hole (or bags if that's what you call it), pool with soccer balls, and a nice outdoor seating area. Walked in and the ambience just screamed clean with a hip vibe. Sat at the bar (eating solo and felt less lame that way haha). The service was quick. Bartender was knowledgeable about beer selection and made great suggestions based on your likes. I ordered the pork belly, kimchi fries, and green tea corn bread...a bit ambitious, I know. The food was out within minutes. Being Asian, I'm really picky about my roasted pork since that's a staple in our diet. Their's was spot on. Skin had the nice crisp and chewiness that is iconic. The meat was juicy with a nice char on the outside. If I had one comment, it would just be that the meat was lukewarm when brought out to me. Not cold by any means but just not with that warmth that I grew up with. The corn bread was on point. Nice crunch on the top, soft and moist inside with a perfect hint of green tea that by no means overpowered the taste of the corn. The kimchi fries...how do I even begin? The fries were fries...nothing to blow you away. But the toppings...wow. Kimchi with some mayo aioli and a layer of bugolgi. This absolutely made it. I would definitely come back to this joint to try the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Great spot in Southend with two great patios and a dog park! Their back patio even has adult games like soccer pool ! They also have different themed karaoke rooms for reservation - sing in the comfort of friends! You must order the fire chicken and bun. 4 stars is only due to not having more healthy side options."}
{"text":"We have gone to Seoul Food twice now, and it won't be the last by any means. It is one of the best casual places in Charlotte to go for a good time. 

As far as things to do, they have amazing outdoor games including giant jenga, connect four, washers, beer pong, corn hole, and life size soccer pool which is always a blast. Even better they have a dog playground that is off to the side, so dog lovers can enjoy seeing the pups play while non dog lovers don't have to worry about it. Great for groups or just two people to hang out and stay busy. There usually isn't a long wait to play any of the games. 

As far as food, the pork belly will actually melt in your mouth. The pulled pork is the boyfriends favorite. The steamed buns I could do without, but the sweet potato bird nest is a must order. I've sampled all of their tacos and have never been disappointed. The Rahmen with cheese is also a must have, get the pork cracklings on top. 

They have a large beer and drink selection. Full bar plus they carry several local breweries on tap. In addition they also have fun drinks you can order in fruit. If you are looking for somewhere to eat, have fun, and relax with friends this is your place. 

As a warning, it will be busier on week nights, so be prepared to wait a little longer. During the week you can have the whole back patio to yourself. They also have rooms that you can rent out per hour for Karaoke."}
{"text":"Food was very bland, but juicy. Never a dry bite. Adding flavor instead of relying on sauces goes a long way. I recommend the wings over meats. Comes out fresh and hot so the wings dont get soggy. Its a work in progress.
Edit: forgot to mention, the spiciness scale is of an average american. Not on the korean spiciness scale."}
{"text":"Seoul easily has the best wings in Charlotte.  They are absolutely delicious.  I absolutely love the spicy wings but the soy garlic wings are also very good.  I like to order them with their Dirty Rice which is perfection.  That said, their fish tacos are my favorite item on the menu.  If you go, try everything to learn your personal favorite.  My friends and I go and we all love something different but enjoy everything.  They have a very chill vibe and some tasty beers on the menu.  They are good for eating outside and are pet friendly if you'd like to sit outside with your fury friend.  They do play sports and you can watch both professional and college football.  I 100% recommend, they have something there for everyone."}
{"text":"Delish! My server was so cute and very helpful.  I think he was surprised to see me there alone at 4:45 on a Friday.  But that aside the food was awesome. The wings were crispy, juicy and flavorful.  The pulled pork taco was the perfect ratio of smoked porkiness and cool condiments.  

I will return...with Family and friends!"}
{"text":"Some friends and I ventured to Seoul Food on a Saturday evening. The six of us were seated immediately at large picnic table on the patio. We decided to split 3 large orders of meat and two sides a piece. Our eyes might have been bigger than out stomach. We were all stuffed and we still had a few small left overs.

Wings and pulled pork were definitely the favorites. Large crispy wings with good flavor and very juicy. Tender, moist pulled pork with a little sauce on top and extra on the side. We had the kimchi spare ribs as well. They were good and tender, but for $ 6-7 more than most of the other meats, I probably won't get it again.

As for sides we ordered the potato swirl, Pimento cheese with shrimp chips, Bao Buns, Ramen mac n cheese, spicy cracklins ( pork rinds with siracha dust). The swirl was good, but very small. Buns serve a good vessel to shovel the vast quantities of meat in. Pimento cheese was very tasty and good for sharing. Ramen was not that good, cracklins are good but nothing special. 
 
Overall, the meats are definitely the star here, but here. Good value for the amount and quality of food you get. We'll definitely be going back again."}
{"text":"To be totally fair it was a last Friday night so I would expect the place to be busy. However there were no less than eight empty tables and servers standing around and we still had to wait. My hubby ordered  the beef rib and it was Fred Flintstone size, extremely tender and tasty. I ordered the half and half wings, half of which were awful. The ramen Mac n cheese wasn't cheesy and the noodles were over cooked. Our server Vivian was attentive and efficient. The best tasing thing for me was the cucumber garnish on my husbands tray. Definitely won't be a go to for me."}
{"text":"This place was loud, too dark, and had unfriendly staff. The bathroom was a mess with towels all over the floor, soap and other liquids from the sink basin to the floor to the toilet. The food is pretty good, though, and really beneficial for those who are trying to venture out to expand other areas of their flavor palate that they might not be familiar with...but want to stay close to what they know. Korean fusion helps the cause. The downside to this place is that the food is expensive for what little you get in portion, service, and establishment. There isn't much value as a diner, so twice is enough for us for now. We may go back another time in the future to see if things have changed for the better."}
{"text":"Date Night, passed it a couple of times decided to stop by. Servings are Huge and enough for everyone to share. We tried the Beef Ribs, Pulled Pork, Pork Belly, and the Sweet Potato Nest. The Environment was really laid back and very trendy."}
{"text":"Seoul Food is always consistent with amazing food. Drinks are good especially the pineapple soju. Beer selection is a little expensive though. The wings are by far my favorite. They are super crispy and meaty.  I could eat the soy garlic wings all day. The pulled pork on bao buns is also amazing. Pimento corn cheese is different but yummy as are the sriracha cracklins. The potato swirl is the only thing I've had that's average. Everything else has been amazing. The patio is great and they have a lot of games if you want to hang out at the bar or have drinks and socialize. The other side of patio with tables for eating is also dog friendly!"}
{"text":"The servers are very good at explaining the food and drinks.  Although they have a wide beer selection I'm not a beer drinker.  But I liked the Soju straight which tastes somewhere between rice wine and vodka.  

We started with the potato swirl which tastes like Pringles original potato chips.

The pulled pork is my favorite entree item!  Along with an order or two of the bao buns (which are bread only, nothing inside) it makes for a whole meal.  

The beef rib isn't rendered enough so it was very chewy and hard to break apart.  The Brunswick stew is a little soupy.  I wasn't crazy about the tacos but the pulgogi was my favorite.

They do have a light dessert which is basically a green tea ice cream popsicle."}
{"text":"BEST WINGS I'VE EVER HAD EVER!! The rest is decent but the wings...my mouth is watering just thinking about them. My friend is looking into shipping them to me in Michigan with dry ice they were that good."}
{"text":"Not too impressed, wings and Kim chi coleslaw were ok, but would try other places before going back."}
{"text":"Unbelievable WINGS and good sake cocktails. I'm not a \"wings guy\" but oh man, these are hands down the best in Charlotte. I think they are fried twice because they're crunchy on the outside. Service was lacking only one time, and that was for a large party in a private room. I would never say \"no\" to Seoul, though. 

Try the yogurt sake drink! Can't remember the name but you won't regret it"}
{"text":"We came here as mistake, my dad wanted to take my sister to a Korean bbq restaurant for her birthday and I got confuse and made the reservation to the wrong place, what a AWESOME mistake, I actually had this place bookmarked on Yelp but I never got the chance to go. We got there and my parents were already there, this place have an outdoor patio and is pet friendly, we love that because we love to take our puppy  everywhere, we got a table outside,we ordered drinks, I got the pineapple  soju served in a pineapple , my sister got a martini  and my mom got plum wine , we where a little confuse with the menu so we order little by little (sorry to the server, shout out to the server he was amazing, great costumer service)  first we order the crispy pork belly with 3 orders of bao buns and the kimchi slaw, my sister order the swirl potato fried which was seasoned with a delicious Cajun seasoning, I got the ram & cheese  with was good and my mom got the sweet potato  bird nest, it was very good but I will go a lil low on the cinnamon. Then my brother order the ribs the big one and they were AMAZING !!! The meat was so tender and flavorful, we loved it. We got them with more bao buns and kimchi slaw can't go wrong with those, oh my sister got the Korean salad and my mom order the pimento corn cheese  or something like that, that was the last thing we ordered. The bill came to almost $200 which it was ok for all that we ate and drink , we think it was a fair price for all the food we got, compare to other restaurants !  It was a great experience ! We will definitely comeback!   I can't post more pictures because we were too busy eating to take pictures hahaha"}
{"text":"Great food and great service!! No cons, tons of pros. We loved the pulled pork and the chicken. You HAVE to get the ramen mac n cheese. The dessert and drinks are really good also. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Menu is very small. Most of the meat was pretty good. White wine cocktail tasted like flat soda water. Got the potato side that was recommended. Just swirled cut potato with cajun seasoning. Underwhelmed with this place."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Seoul. They've got great food, a great selection of drinks & cocktails, karaoke rooms, and a pretty cool outdoor space that includes many games and even a dog run area for your pups to party. 

Food wise, a must order is their Korean style wings. Go for the half & half to try both sauces, although I think the soy garlic is the clear winner. After that, I'd recommend going with the Fire chicken. Add a side of bao buns to make some little sandwiches with the chicken, you'll thank me later. Pork belly is decent. 

For sides: potato swirl is good & the ramen mac & cheese is a must try just because. The sweet potato nest is pretty solid, although they're like string fries so if you don't like that, I'd skip these. 

Overall, a great place that you definitely won't regret visiting."}
{"text":"I was expecting more of a place I could eat a dinner but the environment was more of drink and eat bar food. Which isn't a bad thing! The bar food and sides are excellent. The fusion is very well done. I love southern cuisine and Asian cuisine mixing them is surprisingly genius. The music videos playing all over a pretty cool too. Definitely a place to check out if you want to hang out with a group friends."}
{"text":"Tried out this place today. The menu looked very interesting online, and it did not disappoint. We've tried kimchi sausage as an appetizer. Flavor-wise it was great, and the way it was cased, you could tell it wasn't mass-produces. It was a bit on the dry side though. As the entree, my husband and I ordered beef rib, with the side of collard greens, ramen \"mac'n'cheese\" and sriracha cracklings. Beef rib was super yummy, but a bit too fatty. Which is just a matter of personal preference, I guess. Ramen was the best of both worlds - I might need to start making this at home. Cracklings were also very good, nice balance of crunchy, fatty, spicy, and when they were brought out to us they were still making the crackling sound :) 
My favorite part was the dessert. They call it green tea biscuit, but essentially it was two mini-donuts filled with matcha ice-cream. And it was freaking delicious. Might be my new favorite thing to eat. The hot sugary donut and the smooth creamy delicate ice-cream are a winning combo. Had to get seconds and ate on the way home. 
Friendly staff, great service. The only other little negative was the music - a bit too loud, could barely hear my husband from across the table."}
{"text":"Sooooo good! 

We've been here a few times and it's really a great combo of east meets west. 

For starters, you can't leave here without the kimchi fries. It's like a Korean version of a poutine. This can be a meal all it's own or split it with a friend if you are feeling generous. 

The fire chicken is off the hook. I don't think it is exactly worthy of the term \"fire\" as far as spicy, but the grill flavor might be the goal of the name. The huge portion of five thighs for $9 (small) is more than a main course. 

Other items I've tried are the tacos and pork belly. The pork belly is pricy but it's something really special. The hard crunch is really impressive since the meat is still really moist and juicy. 

The space is pretty loud and this is speaking from the lunch rush. The food comes out as it is ready so the spacing of meals at a full table can be a little awkward. 

The staff is always willing to explain items on the menu. They are quick to fill drinks and help when they can."}
{"text":"Where to start...this place is delish!! Everything we had was amazing!  Pimento corn cheese w/shrimp chips..yum!  Pork belly, garlic wings, bau buns...it was all SO good!!  Great vibe w/the Kpop music and fun staff.  Definitely will return!  Oh and did so mention great beers!!"}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere but Terrible service. Waited 26 minutes to order one drink. The guy bartender inside is an asshole"}
{"text":"Solid. Delicious food, solid brand experience throughout. Loud environment with the music. One recommendation ... WET WIPES! Haha"}
{"text":"Just pure awesome and kimchee ribs are on point. Only issue was wait and that was at dinner rush on a Friday."}
{"text":"Excellent casual dining experience.  Waitress was super friendly and helpful. The food is reasonably priced. The wings are HUGE and really tasty. I made the mistake of ordering a large basket for 3 people and a ton of different sides and 2 entrees. It was wayyyy too much food, but everything was so good! Ramen Mac n cheese and the garlic wings were my fave!"}
{"text":"This place instantly became one of my all time favorite places. I don't even know where to start. 

First off, the food variety, quality and consistency are all great! The wings are incredible (bon chon vs here is a toss up though).  The sushi roll things are very good (and cheap), cracklings, potato spiral, fire chicken and pork belly are my go to foods. 

Atmosphere is outstanding. Hands down the best fun bar scene in town and it even has a dog park!!! Just be careful bc the turf gets crazy hot there. 

Drinks are great. Must try yogurt soju. Expensive but delicious. 

The only draw back is that they have a bunch of no english speaking workers and they are kind of lacking in communication between front and back sections."}
{"text":"Arrived on a chilly Tuesday afternoon. The place wasn't super busy. We were immediately greeted and shown to our table.

The menu was explained with a smile. We chose the rib, bao bums, ramen mac and cheese, pulled pork, a kimchi taco, and a half and half wings basket. 

The food came out super fast. The food is served family style, on a tray. 

I have to say the wings were killer. I have eaten wings at a number of the top spots in Charlotte and these are the best. They don't have a lot of flavors but the ones they do are done to perfection."}
{"text":"I celebrated my Mom's surprise 40th Birthday Party here in their Hip Hop Karaoke Room on 3/8/18. My family had an incredible time! The service was fantastic! Our food came out really fast! We all ate the wings. They were the best wings we had ever had! I strongly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Chicken wings - awesome, I would say that compared to Korean fried chicken in New York City, this joint ranks in the top 3... Which is very impressive 

Crispy pork belly - awesome, very authentic from my own experiences with Chinese style pork belly... To all the reviewers who called it tasteless, they fail to appreciate that pork belly by nature is supposed to be minimally spiced. Some salt and a lot of fat makes for a delicious combo. 

Pulled pork - pretty good. I was never a big fan of this as a food category but this place ranks up there with the best

Alcohol menu - out of this world, I would come here just to drink if possible, rather than limit choices to the traditional Asian staples like hite and Sapporo, these guys went out of their way to find truly \"craft\" beer. Big round of applause. 

Ramen Mac and cheese - having gotten by college on a staple of korean ramen I would say that although very tasty, this menu item lacks the fiery red powder that we have all come to fear and love of Korean ramen. So while exceeding expectation, Seoul foods interpretation without the spiciness is odd. 

Ambiance and decor - very contemporary if you like shake shack you'll love this 

Check this place out ... I would highly recommend"}
{"text":"Wow. I dig pretty much everything about this place! 
On Saturday afternoon, around 1:30, I was meeting a first date. I was really shocked at how busy they were! However, this was a sign of how amazing this place is.
The ambiance, the decor, the building - all very open & \"warm\" feeling. I love the idea of the outdoor bar area (covered, I'm thinking, just for the winter). I absolutely freaked when I saw the dog area! I'm already thinking about taking my dog Cooper there in the spring & summer!

My date & I got the meat sampler platter - which, you guessed it, was all meat. It was a limited time special. We also ordered the sweet potato bird's nest. I ordered the grapefruit sparkler cocktail & my date ordered a couple of cocktails - Buzz City & one other (can't recall the name).

We didn't wait too long for this massive pan to arrive. The presentation was nice & we had many sauces to choose from. There was pulled pork, pork belly, ribs, brisket, fire chicken & one other type of meat. My favorite was the pulled pork & pork belly.

Our bartender was fantastic! Super friendly, attentive & knowledgeable. 

While I scored a nice parking spot by the restaurant, I can imagine parking is an issue - especially now, since they have another restaurant opening next door.

Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"I am super happy that yelp suggested this place to me. With this being my 1st Time in Charlotte I had absolutely no idea of where to go. I was sad that I could only order from the late night menu because I really wanted to try their beef ribs, being that I don't eat pork and not many places offer beef ribs. What I ordered from here were their wings (20 of them yum) they have garlic and spicy bbq, which were both amazing! But my fav would have to be the garlic. Along that we order the \"fat brisket bulgogi taco\" which was so juicy with so much flavor. It had just the perfect crunch with the pickled veggies. We also got both the beef bulgogi and fire squid Kim Bap. Now the beef was drier than I've had before so I wasn't much of a fan but the fire squid gave me life. It was juicy and tender and I definitely wanted more. We also tried one of the local craft beers to go along with our meal. Now for all of this food our bill was less than $40 bucks, can you say winning!! Lol. This would be a place I would want to revisit if I ever return to Charlotte. They also have multiple rooms to have your own personal karaoke party which seemed really cool. Along with an outside bar with multiple games like corn hole and more. We didn't get to enjoy any of those festivities because we were super hungry and tired at the same time. But if you go make sure you check all they have to offer out!"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb. Wings are Devine and crunchy and jumbo sized. Get the half and half wings."}
{"text":"Sooooo much food! We tasted a bit of everything and left full. We ordered small sizes of everything. It's a great place to go with friends and the food is delicious."}
{"text":"First time here on a Wednesday night sitting out on the patio...it's packed with one server. None of the menu was explained to us so we ordered blindly not knowing exactly what to expect. We honestly ordered enough food for 6 it's ridiculous that our waiter didn't go over how everything was served! I will say the wings and sweet potato nest was delicious but the chicken and pork belly was nothing special. Wouldn't come back or recommend to friends!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Best wings you will ever have (both flavors are amazing) tacos are also very flavorful. They have a good beer selection, one blueberry beer in particular where they put actual blueberries in the beer which was delicious. Staff is also super friendly and helpful to answer any questions about the menu you may have."}
{"text":"So, I'm physically in this restaurant right now at a birthday dinner. When we were sitting a customer urgently warned us about a certain dish to steer clear from( ramen noodles covered in cheese).I didn't cause a scene because it's my good friend's birthday....let's begin though, backstory aside. The menu is pretty unimpressive so to be safe I ordered the braised fish tacos. They're drowned in cole slaw and cucumbers....quite frankly they're disgusting. I took a good look and slid it away. I told the waitress I didn't want the food and she called the manager out. He condescendingly explained to me that he isn't running a tshirt business and can't resell my tacos and that I could try something else because he was still going to charge me. The food here is trash..the service is as well.I won't be back and you (the reader of this review) shouldn't come here to begin with. There's nothing Seoul-ful about this food. Horrible establishment"}
{"text":"Seoul is a neat spot in a quietly booming area that includes Unknown, Craft, and Lady M Cakes. I've been here a few times, but my most recent visit was on a whim with my wife (because cooking is time consuming and we were already hungry). Overall Seoul is a unique experience in the Charlotte scene that boasts an amazing meat selection, creative cocktails, and a great presentation for sharing. 

When starting off with a drink, don't be afraid to go off the norm and try something other than the local craft beers. While I got a Sapporo on draft during my most recent visit, our waiter encouraged me to try the yogurt soju on a previous visit. It was an impressive display hitting the table still in the shaker while smoking from the addition of dry ice, and was an overall hit at the table.

Getting to the meat of the restaurant, the portions are large and come out on a large tray to promote sharing (think family style, but with an edgier presentation). My wife and I got a small serving of wings, pork belly (one of the best in the city), and ribs and were unable to finish everything. Also don't make the rookie mistake we did and only order meats. They have some neat sides that are worth trying.

Again, Seoul is a unique addition to Charlotte and I would certainly encourage others to try. Also be sure to watch the K-Pop music videos playing in the background for some unexpected entertainment!"}
{"text":"Everyone talks about the hot wings, but the tacos are unreal. Great drink choices and nice patio outside to chill on."}
{"text":"What to get: half and half soy garlic and spicy wings
Service: 4/5
Atmosphere: bar and snack place, large, busy space
Wait: 20 mins (Friday 7PM for 1)
Parking: street parking, some small parking lots

The Experience:
This is actually a 3.5, but I like rounding up. This place is very popular and a great spot for drinking and snacking. I love my Asian snacks on a Friday night, but so does a lot of people in Charlotte. Be prepared to wait during their popular times, even if you're coming solo like I did.

Parking was kind of tough. I circled twice and you have to read some of the signs to be sure you're not parking illegally. A neighboring company does the pay mobile app on your phone, but if you're there, it charges for overnight fees by dinner time...so I'm unsure if other people also paid the overnight fee or just parked without knowing.

The place itself is extensive. There's the indoor dining area, an outdoor front patio, and a back patio with games to play. They also have karaoke. Perfect place for college kids. Although you probably want to bring groups here, it can get tough with the wait, even if you're going to just sit at the bar.

I'll cut to the food. You get the wings. I personally liked the soy garlic wings, which had a kind of thick crust on it when fried. The spicy wings were tasty as well. You can order wings as half and half so you can taste both.

I also tried the potato swirl, which was kind of fun. The cut was thinner than I thought, so it was like eating thicker chips. Plus you get a sauce to dip it in. It's fun to try, but I wouldn't get it again.

Flavored soju was a bit expensive, but it's only right to wash it down with either beer or soju. Lychee soju is lightly sweetened with a few lychee on a pick for you.

Lastly, service is courteous, but can get swamped. I try to go easy on them and be extra patient when it's busy, but be sure to wave them down every once in awhile. Sometimes it takes awhile for them to get to you.

Overall, a fun place, especially for happy hour, drinks, and Korean-influenced snacks. I probably won't be back for awhile, but I hope that they can possibly open another location to alleviate the crowds. I'd love to see it grow."}
{"text":"What a fun place. Great fusion food - really like the ramen mac and cheese - coupled with fun outdoor options. I mean, what is better than eating lots of BBQ (some really spicy ones at that), and then burning it up playing human pool and giant jinga? 

This place is definitely popular, so try to get here a bit early. We were here at 7, and after dinner, all Karoake rooms were occupied by 9 pm. 

Five stars for the concept - there really isn't anything like this in Charlotte area. Bring the group and have some (very affordable) fun!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of southern BBQ, Korean BBQ, and chicken wings. After a 4+ star rating on Yelp, I thought it would be a perfect spot to go to while in Charlotte for the night.  I hopped in an Uber and went to the Southend of Uptown.

The area is really hip and the restaurant is very well done aesthetically.  We were greeted at the door and hustled outside to a wooden picnic table.  The menu is fairly unclear to the average eye, but surely the waiter would be of help, right?  He was friendly, but didn't really have any good suggestions of the crowd favorites.   We ordered cocktails and wine along with an order of the Deviled Eggs and Spicy BBQ wings that came out promptly, but before drinks and even water.  There were a shortage of setups and no napkins for the very messy wings.  The wings were of the breaded variety and were actually pretty good, but just too saucy.  

We then ordered a series of items: Fire chicken, pork ribs, bulgogi sausage, ramen mac, sweet potato, and the spiral potato.  The fire chicken was decent, covered in cheese and hot sauce. The pork ribs on the other hand looked like something I dissected in high school biology class.  They needed to have a lot more mix of Southern BBQ with a few minutes on the grill to make for a much more appetizing look and taste.  They were literally inedible.  The sausage looked like a gray mush wrapped in pig intestines.  It was cold and if it was smoked, it might have been slow cooked for 35 seconds.  The Ramen Mac was a soup of cheese and noodles with mediocre flavor.  The potato dishes were average at best. 

Overall Seoul Meat Company was a complete disappointment and I'm shocked that there were so many good reviews.  This supposed fusion of southern BBQ and Korean BBQ needs to have a revamp of both sides of the equation.   The only reason I gave it 2 stars was because the wings were pretty good.  The other food pulled the score way down."}
{"text":"So legit! I'm so glad my homies took me here. Come here with a bunch of people so you can order the entire F'n menu. Everything was so good. The brisket was to die for. Wow! I don't even use that phrase but I just did. Lol. Anyways, it was super tender and the large portion right on the bone was enough for 4 people to share with left overs. If you have a dog, they'll love you too (just make sure you bring the bone home). 

Speaking of dogs... this place is good for pets since they have a nice outdoor area with games, etc... Very fun atmosphere. If you want to sing, they got karaoke rooms for that too."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is so cute and fun. The outside area has some games, a dog park and a couple heaters for the cold weather. Server was pretty attentive although she didn't mention her name.. 
We ordered the two flavored wings, loaded potato salad, kimchi fries, pork, slaw and potato swirl. Everything was OK. Not the most authentic Korean food I've had but if I had to order something i would suggest the garlic wings over the other flavor. Juicy and flavorful."}
{"text":"Aright y'all this place is the BOMB. Where else are you going to get fantastic food, beer and games in the back, as well was Karaoke?! No but really, this place was so much fun. The food at Seoul is mostly wings which all I'm going to say about that is, between my 12 friends I tried just about every flavor and loved them all. Here's the cool part, all you vegetarians out there, they have tofu wings! And this is coming from my somewhat picky vegetarian girlfriend, she was a fan of the tofu wings so dig in! I'd also recommend getting the sweet potato birds nest, it legit looks like a birds nest with the fine bits of sweet potato - it's a winner for sure. 

Now that we covered the food, time for Karaoke! Yes this place has 3 private Karaoke rooms with a designated waiter to each and you never have a bad time at Karaoke. I'd recommend going on a Sunday, it's half off the room rent so it's $30 an hour as opposed to the usual $60, and with a decently that's dirt cheap. The rooms are, for lack of better verbiage, LIT. The night we went also had a tent up in the back with a bar and all sorts of games from beer pong to table tennis and such so that was definitely a lot of fun! 

ProTip: Get a reservation for big parties, this place is busy busy busy. And the same goes for Karaoke."}
{"text":"I have not tried everything, but what I have sampled were great
Garlic wings - great, perfectly fried and seasoned
Sweet potato birds nest, fun side.
Great Customer service

I will come back"}
{"text":"Here we go...

You'll be initially saddened at the typical wait wondering if they'll ever find you or if it's a twisted game of hide and seek. Eventually if you wait it out, you'll be pleased to try the baked ram (ramen) & Cheese, damn it is amazing. The brisket and ribs are good, but the accompanying sauce is a bit spicy and distracts from complimenting the bbq. The soy garlic wings are sweet and tasty, however the batter is laid on a bit thick and makes it a bit much on the crunchy side. I tried a fat brisket bulgogi taco and it was amazing and flavorful.

Overall, it is a good spot to try with friends and they also have karaoke rooms if you feel like getting hammered and forcing everyone to join in on Wonderwall. Come through. 

Got it? Good."}
{"text":"Tried out Seoul Food for the first time and had a great experience. The food was awesome and our server Rebecca was friendly and helpful. She made great recommendations and her service was top notch. The food was delicious and the portions were quite large. I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"There's nothing that negatively comes to mind about Seoul food meat company. From the moment we sat down Christie was very helpful and extremely knowledgeable about the menu. Even the trainee was very attentive to my water staying refilled. The food was fast and absolutely delicious. My brother and I decided to split an order of 20 half and half wings as well as some pulled pork and brisket tacos.  Between the two of us we still left with half of each taco as well as 10 wings because they are so big!  I have been raving about it since stepping out of the building. It was a very satisfying experience. Definitely on the list of places to suggest as I look forward to trying more things on the menu."}
{"text":"Finally got the chance to go and OH MY GOD THOSE WINGS THOUGH! The soy garlic wings were the best wings I have ever had, with the perfect crunch and flavor. We ordered tacos, fire chicken, the Seoul Good Salad, etc... (tons of food) Since it is family style, it was way easier to finish and allowed everyone to try all the things they wanted to. Our waitress was super nice! She explained the menu to us and when the food came out, made sure that we knew what we were about to eat. The K-Pop music playing made the eating process extra fun! I loved it, and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"If you're not eating here you're living a half-life... a cursed life. Any time I come in to charlotte this place is a must stop. Literally everything is delicious, bartenders and wait staff are fabulous. I have never had an experience that was less than excellent. COME HERE FOR DATE NIGHT IF YOU LIKE DELICIOUS THINGS."}
{"text":"Amazing wings and great pork belly. Definitely don't have to order a lot to fill up two people. Dog area is great for your pup and plenty of games to play with your friends. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"It's okay but the service kind of sucked. Asked three times for something and never got it but it was on my bill. 

I'll go again but I'll stay at the bar where the service was good and you only needed to ask once."}
{"text":"As a \"sides person,\" Seoul Food was a dream come true! Served \"family style,\" we ordered a small pork belly, small brisket, and large pulled pork. We also had the potato spiral, sweet potato basket, baked rame'n cheese, and bao buns. We ordered Seoul Margaritas, too. 

Every single bite was completely delicious. The flavors are a perfect combination of hearty southern dishes & unique Korean flavors. Our waitress was knowledgeable, sweet, and on top of things. Food was delivered promptly and accurately. The atmosphere was lively & fun without being over-the-top loud. It was a wonderful experience from start to finish and we will definitely be back! YUM!"}
{"text":"The only time i've had good Korean bbq is when I go back home to NYC, so when I walked into this place I had very high expectations. Korean bbq is one of my favorite things to eat. I ordered the ribs, soy garlic & spicy bbq chicken wings and a side of kimchi slaw. I wasn't aware that it was a fusion of American flavors with Korean. The kimchi slaw was actually very disappointing to me. Kimchi is fermented cabbage and is my top favorite dishes of all time. It didn't resemble kimchi to me at all, and the kimchi flavor was sincerely lacking. The chicken wings were very crispy on the outside and juicy/tender on the inside. I personally didn't like the flavors. The soy garlic lacked a kick of flavor and the spicy bbq was a little bit too salty. The beef rib was predominantly fat which was seriously disappointing. It was tender, but way too fatty. I grew even more despondent when I found out there was no soju to be offered. All in all, I think everyone should go and give it a try, but just remember it's not your traditional Korean fusion."}
{"text":"Date of Visiting + Reason: 11/10/17 at night for a birthday dinner

This is probably my 4th time going to Seoul and I must say, they do keep up consistency ESPECIALLY when it comes to their service. 

So, this is what I had: 
(i) Small Wings (6 pc, 1/2 & 1/2) - The wings always come out hot, crispy, & they don't skimp on the sauce. I always ask for a little extra. [SN: The only downside is that they seem to be 'cocky' by not providing ranch or blue cheese. I don't care how good your wings are, they make it BETTER for sure (especially if it's too spicy for some customers)]. 

(ii) Fire Squid Kim Bap - This was relatively ok. The squid needs to be a lot more spicier and the kim bap (I know it's not sushi) needs to be more composed. What I mean by that is 'tighter' so it will not fall apart. I really couldn't experience eating the whole thing because it just kept disintegrating & I had to combine every component individually; even though it was \"wrapped\" up. 

(iii) A pint of SAPPORAO - I mean, you can never go wrong with beer. 

Decor: Mediocre - I like the outside area(s) more and the private karaoke rooms ++++++++

Service: NOW, THIS IS WHERE THEY EXCEL! I would give their service, alone, about a 4.80/5.00 and that's only because I had to remind our server to bring my extra sauce. :-)

All in all, Seoul is an awesome place for a date, birthdays, casual get-togethers,  sports, etc. If you come to South End, make sure you visit Seoul. You will not be disappointed. 

--TrizzyO_o"}
{"text":"I've been dying to try this place & I'm so glad that I finally did! The service was friendly & quick! The food is family style & does come out at different times but it worked out perfectly. There menu is so fun! Tons of choices! Most things contain pork or are cooked in pork, however they do have chicken & tofu options (just make sure to ask). Their drink menu is as also pretty diverse. Overall I had a great experience & I will be back. 

Favorites: Kimchi Fries, Spicy BBQ Ribs, Ram N' Cheese & Green Tea Sugar Biscuits"}
{"text":"Great for so many occasions! Fun with a group of friends, date night, or with family. The wings are phenomenal and the Mac and cheese ramen is super good too! The drinks are great! I love the watermelon and grapefruit beers. Back patio area has awesome games and an additional bar. Great for outdoors in the summer!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place.  I had high hopes that this place might fill Charlotte's void of Korean places and good BBQ both.  Instead I got pork belly so hard and dry you couldn't cut with a knife, rubbery bao that had obviously been sitting out way too long and to top it off a completely flat soda.  At least the staff and setting were pleasant."}
{"text":"Amazing! The ramen mac n cheese is a bit overrated but I'm still glad I tried it. Next time I go I'm just getting a bunch of wings because those were the best I'd ever had!"}
{"text":"So I want to revisit this review in a couple of months because the place is promising. Georgous brand new spot of a repurposed building. Very minimalist and industrial in the design. The meat is on point though I will say what should be spot on interpretations of Korean classics leave a bit to be desired. I think all in my table had every meat offering that Seoul Food had on its menu (which, might I add, is a very targeted menu, very focused which I can appreciate). Everyone liked their main, though out of the wings the soy ginger was preferred and one would think that at a Korean place you could get a really good spicy (gochujang) bbq sauce. It was just alright. Meat portions were hearty and everyone left with the box. Service was good for a large party, though at the time the POS machine could not separate our check only tally which tested everyone's math skills and patience a little. So let's talk banchan. The sides were kinda weak all except the water kimchi which I would have hoped they gave me more of. The potato spiral was delicious as were the bao buns, really good to make your own steamed bun sandwich at the table. Yes, I get it we are in the south and maybe not everyone likes the traditional sides but we are an adventurous bunch in Charlotte, trust us a little more that you don't have to coat ramen with cheese or mute the heck out of kimchi with mayo and call it slaw. Unless it is delicious and thrn I am all about it. Have at it! My 3 year old, bless her heart, started a mini revolt because they had no soup (p.s. though there were kids and babies there it will take some creativity on parents' parts to find something for kids to eat before they can tolerate spice). She is more old school than me, I guess. 

Meat company, I get it. I do. I will give up my wish to have traditional classic sides and try to get on board with the interpretations my only wish is that they execute them better to make me a believer. We are so almost there though. Definitely support them and I will be back to see how they evolve. And it is kinda awesome to see Kpop and Korean rap on the screens. Feels like a little piece of Seoul in the heart of Charlotte. A lot cheaper than taking a flight so when I get second home sick I will find myself there."}
{"text":"Seoul has a great concept! They've got a great selection of meats and shareable sides. Some of my favorite things on the menu are the fried whole tilapia, the fruit punch beer,  and the dirty rice! 

The even have a great patio space that is nice when the weather is right. 

The only downside to this place is parking can be tough."}
{"text":"Great place that knows what it wants to do well and executes.  It's Korean BBQ in some respects and some modern fusion.  The chicken wings are excellent - the crispy skin and yummy flavor make them winners all around.  The chicken breast was very flavorful and tender - delicious.  The sweet potato birds nest was also a nice side.  Service is quick, atmosphere is casual and kind of hipster.

Don't come here expecting a lot of greens (although they do have broccoli which looked lonely on our table among the large amount of MEAT)."}
{"text":"Heading to a game at BOA stadium and needed a bite to eat before so we wandered off to Seoul Food Meat Company and we were glad that we did! It was packed so we grabbed three seats at the bar and each started off with a beer. I would definitely recommend the soju even though I did not order it, I watched the bartenders make a few and it looked amazing.  Plus it was served in the fruit that you ordered (I saw watermelon, coconut, and pineapple).  

Three of us split the following: 
Cripsy Pork Belly (small), too salty for my liking
Pulled Pork (small), amazing! I highly recommend the pork. 
Soy Ginger Wings, the best thing that I ate at Seoul! The skin was perfectly breaded and so crispy.
Pimento Corn Cheese, I personally enjoyed this dish but others in my party did not care for it
Choiang Broccoli, fresh and delicious 
Collards

Excellent food with an awesome staff, I would definitely recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Here are my favorites:

Try the wings! They're huge & extra crispy. Order both flavors! 

The beef rib is amazing too! Remember the portions are huge so share with others. The meat is super tender and delicious.

Coconut Soju is my favorite - it comes in a coconut & is super creamy! 

Lychee Soju is my next favorite - it's not too sweet and the flavors are perfect together well."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend for dinner and didn't really know what to expect about a fusion of Korean food with a southern twist. As a good Yelper would do  I fired up my Yelp app and read the reviews and some entree suggestions. After perusing the menu and consulting with my fellow Yelpers suggestions, I settled on the pulled pork, bao buns, collard greens and the spiral potatoes. Everything was good. The pulled pork came in a mound of meat, yep that's right, it literally was a mound of meat and it was drizzled in a homemade \"bbq sauce\" which has a little kick to it. The spiral potatoes are good and the seasoning they are dusted in also has a little kick to it. Now I'm from the south and southerners love our greens especially our collards. I was a little skeptical about eating collard greens in a Korean restaurant but I said what the hell, you only live once, and I tried them. They were pretty good and well seasoned. The bao buns were warm and delicious. Overall its plenty of food and even if you get the smaller portion, its enouhh to share. 
One other important thing, they have a lot of beers, cider and cocktails. Not sure what you want to dri k, you can ask for a sample of the beer or cider youre pondering. 
I'm not ruling out coming back and next time I'll get the ginger soy wings with spiral potatoes."}
{"text":"Good food and excellent service! 

Lots of hits and misses on the menu but despite some so-so menu items, 5 stars for the wings and service. Ask for Vivian. She's awesome! 

For S&G, get a beer tower. It's pretty cool. And don't forget to check out the out the outdoor patio! There's a dog park, some cool beer pong setups, and other goodies.

Wings here are super crispy, with a super savory thick crust. It doesn't sound very appealing until you take a bite. You'll be hooked for sure! Despite there being 3 options, there are only 2 flavors: soy garlic & spicy garlic. Half & half is simply half order of soy garlic and half order of the spicy. Both flavors are delicious, but one is usually better than the other depending on the night. I find the flavors inconsistent every time I dine here. Regardless, it's always good. Wings are a must try for sure! 
Every wing dish comes with a small serving of pickled radish. It's not for everyone but I highly recommend tasting it with the wings. It brings in a nice, sweet tangy crunch to the wings. 

To make the wings next level: 
Get a side of Ramen Cheese. Comes with little crispy bits on it. Excellent. It's the ultimate cheesy compliment to the savory wings. Try them together. It's so good! Top it off with a beer and you're good to go. 

On occasion, pairing the wings and ramen cheese with the sojus is also good. Both the lychee and coconut soju are tasty. Lychee leans a little sweet, and tangy. Very refreshing!  

Other things to try, though less urgently: 

Crispy Pork Belly: Typical crispy pork belly. So good and hard to mess up. They make it reallllyyy crispy here (yum) plus a nice meat to skin ratio. (Other place love to skimp on the meat). The meat is also very juicy here but borderline oily at times. Still a delicious treat. 
If you want to bring it to the next level: Order a side of bao buns, and get some of those pickled cucumbers. Put that all together and drag it through the dregs on the soy garlic sauce. It's heavenly. Finish off with beer. (Disclaimer: Pork belly is quite overpriced here. You can go a mom and pop asian shop and get way more for cheaper.)

Pimento Cheese Dip: the chips add a cool spin to the dip. it's a cold dip.  it doesn't come out hot. you'll like this if you enjoy pimento cheese/ non sharp cheese. the novelty did wear off as I ate though and got distracted by other food (namely wings and pork belly) but definitely a great appetizer type dish. eat the chips touching the dip first as these types of chips tend to turn soggy quickly

Blueberry beer. It's damn good. 

Things to Pass On:
Beef Rib: comes with a giant bone in the middle and vinegar based dipping sauce. didn't seem like a lot of meat for the money plus the meat was dry pretty much everywhere except for where there was fat

Kimchi Pork...meat wasn't really tender and the kimchi flavoring didn't really do much for me. there was hardly any kimchi in the dish and it was cooked in so you miss that nice little sour bite that's characteristic of kimchi. feels like they're going for savory but missed the mark and landed somewhere in messed up burnt siracha flavor land

Kim Chili Ramen: oi. basically chili with ramen noodles buried underneath. there was no taste of kimchi at all (like the pork, it was cooked out completely). an absolute pass, unless you're a die hard chili fan...then you do you.

Soy Deviled Eggs: horribly dry with a pickled flavor. a huge miss. maybe if you're a fan of dried pickled eggs but hard pass for me"}
{"text":"The other night I had dinner at Seoul Food Meat Co. while visiting Charlotte.  It's nestled in a cute part of town where you'll find a couple of Growlers, a cafe, and some cool looking townhomes.  This area reminded me a lot of a cool part of town in Atlanta.  Super clean and Seoul Food Meat Co's restaurant just shined bright with its white brick building with clean simple lettering on the wall and black framed large window.  Before I entered the restaurant I was pleased to see they had a cool and pretty spacious gated patio and after I learned it was a pet friendly patio, I was elated.  I made a mental note to bring my furbaby with me the next time I'm in town.  Once I entered the restaurant I immediately thought to myself \"oh wow, what a cool spot!\"  Loved the industrial & rustic style and feel of this restaurant.  Very inviting and notches that the place was packed even for a weeknight.  Everyone looked like they were having a good time.  They played Korean pop and had a bunch of flat screens to keep all entertained.  The bar area is pretty cool looking too.  They have a neat wall to the side of the bar filled with colorful bottles.  Thought it was cool to see the view behind the wall was a big window that brought in some good light.  Felt like a cool backdrop  The entire restaurant was very organized and well put together.  After dining here I kept thinking a restaurant like this would kill it in Atlanta.  They should open up a location there.  Seriously.  

We were immediately greeted by our servers who were super friendly and helpful throughout our entire dining experience.  They were prompt from start to finish.  Our drinks came out pretty fast.  I had a chance to try the watermelon beer, lychee lemonade (non-alcoholic), and also had some of their watermelon soju.  I enjoyed all three.  Very refreshing for the hot summer heat.  It's cool how they had the watermelon soju inside an actual half of a watermelon.  Loved that!  

A couple of things I noticed after looking over the menu
-like how they have a wide array of side items.  I mean a good variety of them.  (I heart sides)
-clean and simple menu
-had a good amount of protein items including a fish

Now on to the food.  Our group had the following:
-chicken wings- ordered the both sweet one (soy garlic) and spicy & sweet one (spicy BBQ).  Enjoyed them both that we ordered a second round for our group.  Packed with flavor and perfectly fried with a nice cool she'll.  I hear they use rice oil for their chicken wings which is a plus.  Loved how the wing and drumsticks were huge.
-soy pickled boiled eggs- yum!  Heard they pickle their own veggies.  This was one of the fav amongst our picky group
-Korean slaw- nice sweet & spicy dressing.  Cool Korean twist to the good ole Cole slaw I'm used to. 
-ramen mac & cheese- this was unique.  Never had this style before but felt worked with the fusion style restaurant they are.  Definitely recommend eating this as soon as it comes out.  
-kimchee Brunswick stew-  good and had layered flavors.  Liked their take on the Brunswick stew.  Very clean tasting with just the right about of seasoning.  They loaded it up with yummy meat and veggies that go in a Brunswick stew
- fresh pickled slices- so light, fresh, and tasty.  I could've eaten like a fistful of these.  Wish there were more.
-beef ribs-  WOW!  I mean really wow!  Great flavor and cooked to perfection.  It literally fell off the bone.  Topping it with their secret special sauce was like the perfect combo.  Seriously this one is so good!
-crispy pork belly- another yummy item!!  I think my bf at like half of them himself.  Cooked so well.  Very nice crispy outside with perfect texture inside.  I've had a lot this style in ATL but Seoul Food did it right.
-dirty rice- this one was good too.  Don't know what they topped it with but that compilation added a very nice flavor to each bite of my rice.  Wish I had more of that topping. 
-pulled pork- it was good.  Definitely liked it with the BBQ sauce that came with it.
-fire chicken-  really enjoyed this one.  Topped with some yumminess and the chicken was nice and moist. A good counter protein from the meat.
-buns- would definitely the bao buns with your dinner.  Super soft but a nice casing for the proteins and sides.

I would highly recommend this restaurant.  It is a great representation of how to get Charlotte on the foodie scene.  Love seeing how the people of Charlotte have embraced this new gem of a place from what I observed.  I guess I was amongst some cool C-Town foodies.  Seoul Food Meat Co is innovative and creates a cool atmosphere for those looking to have dinner with friends, family, or coworkers.  This is an establishment that serves some good fusion food that scream a labor of love.  Those going in with an open mind and open palate will be pleasantly surprised that this is a forward thinking fusion hub.  Keep up the good work and I'm definitely coming back here when I'm in town."}
{"text":"The food and service is great.  The food portions are big but I would recommend getting Ramen Mac and Cheese, Soy Garlic Wings, Fire Chicken and the mini green tea ice cream sandwiches.

I had the pork and pimento corn cheese and they were not as good as the above mentioned items.

The service was great and I would go back again."}
{"text":"Good food, great yogurt soju, even worse customer service. Hostess had a terrible attitude."}
{"text":"This place is worth a try.  I wouldn't eat here everyday as the food is very heavy, but the meat is always cooked to perfection and the food presentation makes eating fun.  However, I was not a fan of the Ramen Mac and Cheese, it has a weird taste to it.  They also have a variety of cocktails poured into carved fruit, they are fun but overpriced for the amount of alcohol you actually get."}
{"text":"Love love love this place. Food is on point, staff is great, service is impeccable. I am here at least once a week!"}
{"text":"When I think of Seoul I think of Korean so naturally kimchi is somewhere along that line.. Dining at Seoul.. I didn't see the \"authenticity\" of what's call Seoul! I'm guessing and/hope they will twerk the menu a bit after they manage to sit down and take a breather! They are crazy busy! We ordered: 
Pork Rib, soy garlic wings, crackling, Mac and cheese ramen, ban baos, sweet potato bird nest, 
Spicy chicken and Pork belly 
Drinks: lycée-itini and sparkling wine. 
Pork rib was good. No special seasoning, 
Soy garlic wings was awesome! Nice fried skins but taste like teriyaki wings. I love the crackling. Soo yummy. 
Ban baos is like a bed of pure white gluten clouds. Soo a pillow like that it will help your meats sit nicely in there and oh so tasty! 
Mac and cheese ramen. No, just no!!!
Sweet potatoes bird nest was a hot mess. Some side were burnt some were not, tastes good on the NOT burnt side. 
Spicy chicken is spicy! I couldn't mess with that 
Pork Belly was juicy and and a perfect crunchy outer skin! 
But the honorable mention along with the food is our waitress! Esther L. manage to be on point even though it's a mad house! Waits for table is 1.5 hrs. But Esther alway make sure our soda was filled and our drinks were never empty.. Most businesses doesn't realized this, but even if the food isn't good. Or it's lacking that day. It's the people like Esther that will get people like myself to come back and give the food another try!! And when it's bad service and the food is good. I will tell 10/20 people about the services and stay away for a long time. 
I hope Seoul will incorporate more Korean speciality into their menu. I'm sure charlotteans are ready for these type!"}
{"text":"I don't get why so many people rate this place so high? The sides were terrible (ramen mac and cheese turned my stomach), pimento corn cheese, not good, the swirled potato was great. Also had a spring roll app that was too greasy to eat.  

The wings were good but I can get wings about anywhere and the pork belly was not memorable either. I give this place 3 stars based solely on the outside seating, bar, and play areas.  A great place to hand with friends and you can bring your dog!

{"text":"So this review is for two things. The food and the karaoke room.

I haven't had too much off the menu besides the wings. They are just so good it's hard to order anything else. They are huge and a little goes a long way. Try both flavors, you won't regret it. They offer a large selection of alcohol with interesting flavors,so be adventures.

Now the karaoke room. I threw a surprise party in the Rockstar room one Friday night.  They said the room holds 25-27, but unless it's children size people, keep it under 25. There's room, it's just cramped.we had  20 and it was perfect. It was hot in there and we had to constantly request for the air to be turned on. We had to keep opening the door so we could stop sweating. Eventually after we keep propping the door opened, they turned it on.
Now the karaoke machine is all in Korean -_- .. i wasn't around for instructions, but everybody said it was complicated. Luckily we found one person who could somewhat figure it it. Unfortunately it def took time, figuring out how to find each song,out of our paid 2 hours. 
They have a call button which really didn't make the server come in the room quicker.
Food and alcohol came out in a timely manner.
The karaoke itself had a decent selection of songs. The best part is that it's scored at the end of each performance. Makes it competitive.
Overall i will definitely rent a room again, it was so much fun!! They also have different rooms for different size groups and special prices sometimes on a weekday!"}
{"text":"Update: This place is hands down a staple now in Charlotte. They have amazing food, great atmosphere, the outdoor bar and play area is fantastic! The service is always great. Every time we go we always bring a lot of people because it's one of those places you wanna enjoy with a group for your friends. We always order almost the entire menu. The 12hr rib is beyond this world, the soy garlic wings as well. For sides potato salad, potato swirl, egg rolls, kimbap, kimchi fries these are our top picks! Delicious and only $4 each. We absolutely love this place and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great lunch with a co-worker.  Staff was very attentive.  Ordered the pork belly, fire chicken, sriracha cracklings (pork rinds), potato swirl and green tea ice cream and biscuits.  Pork belly was flavorful with a candy-like coating.  Fire chicken was good, but very hot.  I probably will not order it again, but don't let that stop you.  Cracklings were great, and the seasoning was on point.  Potato swirl was outstanding, especially with the aioli.  Green tea ice cream was a bit less flavorful than I'd like, but the biscuits were a nice combo.  All in all, a very solid business lunch.  The bar is fascinating -- lots of options and flavors.  Will go back for Happy Hour soon."}
{"text":"Yet another lackluster addition to Southend framed in a fun, millennial appealing atmosphere. 

The silver lining for this place is their wings. As many others have said in their reviews, their wings are pretty damn good. If you skip out on the wings, you will probably be curious as to why this place is always packed (pro tip, get the Korean BBQ flavor). 

The drinks...I ordered an old fashioned, which is pretty hard to mess up, but boy did they mess it up. After 10 minutes the waiter brings out what looks to be someone's drink that had 2 sips left, to which I asked \"is this someone else's drink?\". He laughed and replied with \"that's just how it comes\". $13 in the hole for this crap; I was not laughing. It was a watered down mess. I think a nun that's never had a sip of alcohol in her life could probably make a better one. The beer I ordered was also a joke, brought out in a 10oz plastic cup and charged $6 for. $20 later and didn't even have a buzz. 

The rest of the food is certainly different and I think it just tries too hard. Their version of chili cheese fries are the kimchi fries. It's a muddled mess of flavor that doesn't mesh well with french fries. Their version of \"burgushi\" from Cowfish is not exciting at all. Bulgogi beef with no flavor that's wrapped in rice and kelp is just a terrible idea. If you have to put a warning on the menu about it \"not being sushi\", then it's probably indicative of something that's just a bad idea all around. 

Seoul Food Meat Company looks like it should be a killer spot. Unfortunately I think the best thing about this place are the cornhole boards out back. Joining the likes of Zeppelin for crappy, overrated spots in Southend...2.5/5."}
{"text":"Seoul is great. Delicious food (especially wings and fire chicken for me) and an awesome outdoor area with lots of games as well. Drink selection is solid too. The fruit Soju is good but disappointing they didn't have watermelon last time anymore."}
{"text":"A bit pricey but the food is great. I would definitely suggest the chicken wings!"}
{"text":"I brought my boyfriend to this restaurant to introduce him to Korean BBQ.  We liked the food and the waitress was great. But don't ever say hello to the boss and the female bartender.  They just looked at us and gave us a nasty look. Maybe they don't like people in suite. We head over straight from the office to have lunch. The last time I came to this place, the boss was nice to us . But we were just casual that time. Listen all office workers..... don't come to this place. They do not like people dressed up."}
{"text":"Bulgogi Kim bap and kimchi pork tacos for lunch is bomb. Not too pricey and staff is always on point. Not stingy on the bulgogi either which is huge...don't want a big ole roll of rice. Definitely an easy quick lunch"}
{"text":"They have plenty for me as a vegetarian. We love eating where I am happy and content, and my partner can still have his plate o' meat. The staff is always 100%, too!"}
{"text":"Seoul Food killed it!  A total experience from start to finish, other restaurants could learn from this place.  From the K pop music videos playing all over to the passionate and knowledgeable waitress, you knew you were somewhere completely different.  The food was different too, and delicious.  I gotta give a shout out to the chicken wings, they were like little Korean fried chicken!! Everything else was delicious too, even the drinks.  I kept watching food coming out of the kitchen and it all looked bomb, good job guys"}
{"text":"Fresh new establishment. Nice industrial setting and gets pretty busy. As a first timer I recommend getting a large party to enjoy the environment. Food looks and tastes great! Americanized Korean Food with a twist of the southern style eatery. Will definitely be a spot for a nice Saturday night for drinks and to get a bite to eat!"}
{"text":"I love this place. And it somehow got even better after the expansion. Food is amazing, serving sizes are big, and the bartenders are great. The beef rib is a must order."}
{"text":"Amazing food, and a lot of it. The soy garlic wings are some of the best I've had. The portions are family sized for the table so be sure to bring several hungry mouths with you."}
{"text":"I'm an out of towner who has family in the area, and every time I come to CLT we can't help but to stop at this place for a quick bite. This place conceptually is clever, they have karaoke rooms that you can rent, outdoor seating and a bar, games and a dog park, and has Korean music videos playing on flat screens throughout. Very new hipster CLT vibes, but a great place to bring the family for a fun night out, or erm day drinking for the younger crowd. I deff wouldn't call this place kid friendly, but I've been here with family ages 20-70 and we all had a great time. 

Now on to the menu. The food comes out on giant trays for the table, and everything is served family style so you can try different stuff if you wish. Things I loved were: the bulgogi tacos, Ram Mac--fusion of ramen mac and cheese, the birds nest--sweet potato straws piled high, the pork belly, and the soy garlic wings--if you love wings these are for you (!) super crispy and crunchy with a savory and sweet sauce. The drinks are also clever and delicious, pineapple soju that comes in an actual pineapple, and the prickly pear cocktail are some faves.

All in all this spot has great customer service, creative food, and great vibes. Will continue to come back!"}
{"text":"My husband is crazy about steamed buns and since I figured they had it this place was on our list. 
We got there around 7:30 on a Saturday, place was packed and we had to put our name on a wait list. I believe it took around 10-15 minutes for us to get a table, which wasn't bad considering how busy the place was. 
They are a Korean - Southern BBQ fusion restaurant and I can assure you the fusion really worked. 
The service was great and the food was served so fast I could not believe, specially because they were really busy that night. 
I decided to get the soy garlic wings with Ramen N' Cheese  (Mac and cheese) and my husband ordered the crispy pork belly with Bao Bum (steamed buns).
My wings were so crispy I could not believe it! Specially because they came in a soy sauce and they were not soggy at all. The Ramen N' Cheese was from another dimension, one of the best Mac and cheese I've ever had !!!
The crispy pork belly was good but kind of blend so pouring the sauce the it comes with it is basically mandatory because it makes total difference in the flavor.
The experience was pretty good but they are overpriced. They charge 4$ for each side and the dishes itself cost more than in similar restaurants in the area. 
I would go back just for the Ramen N' Cheese itself, but with they prices probably I won't be back as often as I would like."}
{"text":"Great food! Options for both meat eaters and vegetarian and a Fun South Korean vibe.  Highly highly recommend the fire chicken, kimbap, and wings.  Pick a couple sides to mix with all the meats"}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good and I had a decent variety of menu items. This place is family style so I would recommend going with family or good friends that you can share the larger portions with. It is also not a Korean bbq it is a Korean BBQ fusion so expect some different flavors. Also a lot of the food has a little spice to it so if you can not take any heat I would not recommend it to you. Big fan of the chicken wings and the fire chicken, and enjoyed most of the other dishes also. It is a bit pricey and was very crowded when I went and had a lot of trouble finding parking. Seems this area is becoming really trendy so Seoul fits right in."}
{"text":"Came back for more! Was craving the honey glazed, crisp wings all week and was not disappointed! Potato swirl and kimchi fries (both with an American twist) absolutely delicious, even for tastebuds naive to traditional kimchi! Can't wait to come back..."}
{"text":"First time here and we will be back!  The food and awesome service at the bar made up for the crappy hostess. We ordered the large wings - half soy garlic and half spicy BBQ. The wings are huge - so much so that we took home about half of them. The kimchi cole slaw is a must. Delish collard greens and the bao buns are heavenly!  The atmosphere is carefree accompanied by Korean pop videos that appear straight out of the 90s. Patio looks awesome - cannot wait to try it next time."}
{"text":"Some of the best food and bar scene in charlotte, especially the wings. Even better is the service and short wait times for your food to arrive.  My go to combo is the spicy bbq wings, beef rib kim bap, and an ice cold sapporo draft.  Done."}
{"text":"I've been the restarant a couple of times. The first time I went was when they just opened and I had an awesome experience. I even got the chance to meet the new owner. I've been a couple of times since but my experience today will cause me never to go again. A friend of mine who had never been before ordered the hot wings and complained that they didn't taste right and were overcooked. We spoke to the manager and expected to at least have that portion of our meal comped. Instead the manager on call made a very flippant remark of will you bought it you ordered it you bought it and just kind of walked away.  I've never had such horrible customer service and just really a disrespect for the customer.  Clearly they are only interested in folks were 25 years old and are too drunk to notice that they're not getting a customer service. Even on the way out he made a remark of \"come again\", which quite frankly was just not necessary.  So if you're looking for the manager in question he's the heavyset Asian guy.  I would not recommend anybody to go there because they don't care about treating you well as long as they have bodies in the seat and people ordering drinks. You have been warned."}
{"text":"The first time I tried this place, it was great. I don't like wings and I think theirs are great! Have to get the potato swirl and the pimento cheese. 

However, the second time I visited this restaurant I got food poisoning from an undercooked fire chicken dish. Make sure to cut into the chicken and check it out before consuming!"}
{"text":"We had a great server but the food and the bartenders suck--save your money and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I really love this place! Everytime I come to Charlotte, I make a point to stop by. They have a really cool selection including things like Ramen noodles as a Mac + Cheese but items like the crispy pork belly, fire wings and yogurt soju keep me coming back. Super authentic like what you could find in bars/eateries in Korea! Only reason I knocked off a star is the service is spotty. It's either on point or it'll take you 30 minutes to get your drinks. It might help to get those call buttons for service for waiters like in Korea;) other than that, it would be 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Tremendous wings, I ordered both of the flavors and couldn't really decide which I liked better. There are lots of cool games to play and a nice dog area. I would like to go back for more wings and to try some other things on the menu too. But this is also a great place to bring your pets and it just so happens they have really good food and drinks."}
{"text":"Nice little spot in my favorite part of Charlotte, South End. Great atmosphere within the restaurant with a nice layout. 

I had the fire chicken which I heard was popular and a side of the ramen mac and cheese. The fire chicken consisted of chicken breast covered with what tasted like a spicy barbecue sauce and shredded cheese on top. It wasn't too spicy, but there was a sauce on the side just in case you needed a little more kick!

The ramen mac was pretty good, just be sure that you mix it well before you dig in, or else you might miss some of the flavor.

Sn: our server did say the wings were popular, and that is what my dad ordered. He had the soy garlic, and I must say. THEY TASTED AMAZING. The glaze was PERFECT. I will definitely be getting the wings when I revisit."}
{"text":"Best wings ever! Gigantic, crunchy, tender and delicious...especially the soy garlic. It's a good thing I don't live too close to Seoul or I would be eating there every day!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was absolutely amazing! Great service, drinks, and delicious food. The portions are  so big and surprisingly cheaply priced. I stumbled upon this restaurant accidentally and couldn't have been more pleased."}
{"text":"Oh the flavors are so good!! Ordering the correct portions is a little challenging. We had way to much food but thought we had over ordered. I feel like the server could have been a little more helpful with explaining the portions. The wings were SOOO crispy and the bao buns were pillow soft. I do think they should give 4 buns with the order. Also the broccoli salad was cold and we were a big fan of that. Overall the seasoning and flavors were def worth giving this a taste!!"}
{"text":"Gotta love when you go to a restaurant and the food is as fun as it is good.  We popped over to Seoul after a work meeting to get some grub and a beer after hearing over and over again how cool it was.

First thing, this place is dog friendly - if I could give them an extra star for that I would.  The outside area is large and spacious and perfect for groups.  The vibe is exactly what you hope for - industrial, unique and eclectic enough to make you feel cooler than you actually are.

My recommendation for the food?  Look through yelp photos!  I was really excited for the Ramen Mac, but ended up being WAY more impressed with the Pimento Nachos.  The wings were really good, but they were fried - which is not what I was expecting.  The Bao Buns don't come with meat inside so we stuffed some pork belly in there and it was awesome.  Next time I want to try the green tea biscuits for sure. 

The service was positive, the food was fun and delicious, the weather was beautiful... I wish I was still there.

Probably not an ideal place for vegetarians - if you couldn't tell from the name alone.... that said there is actually a small selection of non-meat items that are really good!"}
{"text":"TL;DR Version:
- Great Wings!!! Best in Charlotte (BBQ / sauce based)
- Great tasting food / Meats. Remember it's NOT traditional Korean BBQ.
- Fun atmosphere. Cool karaoke rooms.

Longer Review:

Food: 5/5
The wings alone are worth the visit. Definitely get the 1/2 and 1/2. I usually get a take-out order of wings each week so yeah, I've done thorough research. You're welcome.  A note for my fellow discerning wing connoisseur: you can request all flats (boo!) or all drums (the best part of the wing) for $1 more. The other non-chicken wing meats are delicious too. So are the non-meat food options. The birds nest is another go to for me. 

Location: 4.5/5
I like that it's a bit tucked away from the main street (South Blvd) but still convenient to get to in South End. Parking is usually not an issue and there's plenty of bars a short walking distance away.

Value: 5/5
The price is moderate and well deserved given the quality, quantity and taste of the food. Customer service has always been friendly during my visits, especially my take-out orders.

Service: 5/5
Top notch service over at Seoul. Very attentive and the wait times for picking up your grub is usually around $20. It's become more popular so you may want to RSVP if they do that.

Atmosphere: 5/5
I've been to Seoul since it first opened and the updates they've made are pretty solid. There's some pretty dope karaoke rooms with awesome ambiance courtesy of wall paintings. You soak up the sun and your adult beverage outside while playing a plethora of games outside like corn-hole, etc. This spot is pretty legit for tailgating since it's in close proximity to Panther's stadium."}
{"text":"Holy. Crap. These tacos are AMAZING!!! We did the bulgogi and the kimchi and they are so delicious and well priced at four dollars a taco. (So much meat on them). You are doing yourself a disservice not coming here. We will be back just to get the appetizers we didn't even get to try this round. Excellent addition to Charlottes bar/restaurant scene."}
{"text":"Amazing. One of the best places in Charlotte. Fire chicken is my absolute fave and the ramen Mac is my favorite side. Pork belly tacos are dope as well. Great outdoor space that is dog friendly. You won't regret coming here!"}
{"text":"We had the roast pork and the spicy chicken, it was really good with the sauce that was given, also our waiter, I think his name was Kevin, he was really great! I highly recommend our waiter! We also got the chicken wings, it was really spicy, but overall the food was great"}
{"text":"Yepp, I am a fan now.  So we were craving for wings and looked up yelp and decided to visit the long due, Seoul Food place.  It was about 8PM on Tuesday night and this place wasn't much crowded at the time.  Got a table pretty quick and was attended pretty quickly as well.
Our server Dylan - is a great guy, he is very enthusiastic and interactive and made sure everything was alright with us the whole time we were there.
The Food - you must be bored of reading same kind of reviews. The Food was GREATTT.  Their menu is small but the taste is big.  We ordered a small Fire Chicken, a small wings (soy garlic) and a Asian ginger beer.  Loved the ginger beer, but $8 is a bit steep though.
Fire chicken was delicious - the portion was big enough, its basically boneless chicken, chicken meat pulled off of thighs I believe, cooked to perfection with juicy inside and coated with their spicy sauce and cheese on top.  Awesome, loved it.  The sauce is what takes it to a whole different level.  We also got the boa buns, it was fun to look at them lol we sandwiched the chicken inside boa buns and made a burger for ourselves.  For 9 bucks I felt it was worth it.
Wings - ordered a small portion soy garlic sauce wings.  these wings are big, nicely fried (great crunch) and juicy inside.  again the sauce - makes me crave for more!! there was little touch of sweetness and that's a winner for me.  again for 9 bucks, worth it.
The atmosphere is great, the ambience is great, all young guys and girls working there, a bit loud music, open bay windows, nice bar set up/ area, they use rice barn oil for all frying. 
 A great place to hangout with friends/love ones for sure."}
{"text":"My favorite dish is the bulgogi taco with white rice. Perfect combination. It's a little pricey for the small portion size, but the flavors make it all worth it."}
{"text":"The tofu wings are to die for.  Love the drink in the watermelon and all the games.  Best happy hour spot"}
{"text":"Excellent! We chowed on everything. Pork belly-delicious! Beef Rib-heavenly, Kim chi Mac n cheese-out of this world, wings were orgasmic. Bottom line go! You won't be disappointed. Staff was the best! 1 flaw was the specialty drinks, a little pricey and so so. Still this place gets a 4.9999 out of 5. I can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"The food was AWESOME! There wasn't anything our group ordered that was questionable. There is outside seating though we chose to sit inside due to the heat. The noise level needs to be buffered slightly for conversation purposes! Great energy!
Warning: The bbq will have your eyes rolling back into your head! The BIGGY is there are items on the menu everyone can choose from... GF/DF/Vegetarian along with the eat everything-ers!"}
{"text":"This place is so amazing, I meant to take pics and check-in but the food didn't make it . I recommend trying the wings (half & half meaning half soy ginger/half spicy), Mac & cheese ramen as well as the broccoli salad. If you prefer a meatless meal, tofu wings are an option or if you prefer fish I definitely recommend trying. My only minor complaint is service can be slow however the quality/atmosphere definitely makes up for it."}
{"text":"We can't get enough of this place! What a great special!!  The staff is always super friendly! The soy garlic wings are like heaven in your mouth! This time we got the meat platter that was  on special. We get the beef rib a lot too. I take the bone home to make broth. Last time we were here (3 days ago) we tried the new wing flavors to vote on. We got the pimento cheese and it was awesome!!! We tried the Kim Bap spicy squid for the first time too. Pretty good. I like the size of the facility and the different atmosphere from room to room. They have karaoke rooms, out door space with games.  I think it's so funny they play gangster Korean rap videos!!! Great job and happy anniversary!"}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere was very good. It is interesting how they put a Korean twist on southern food. I had smorgasbord of food that include the crispy pork, kimchi sausage, bulgogi taco, pork taco, kimchi coleslaw and some greens. My favorite was the crispy pork, bulgogi taco, and the kimchi Coleslaw. They also have a good beer selection. I am definitely coming back on my next visit to the Queen City."}
{"text":"Holy cow. Wow. We found this place by accident while road-tripping through. We always like Korean BBQ so decided to give this fusion version a try. Amazing. We wanted to order everything but the portions are huge, so we restrained ourselves. Got the pork belly, the kimbop, and kimchi fries. Flavor explosion! Now we are planning our next trip south to be sure we can swing through and try more of this menu."}
{"text":"I didn't even mean to review this I thought it was soul, spell error. But I have eaten here twice before. Honestly I don't want to be negative about it Bc they are new, so I'm praying for benefit of the doubt. Was super excited to hear about this place opening. But wasn't what I expected. Then I embedded in my mind. Hey consider it Carolina style Bbq with Korean flavors....... Sorry the concept is amazing, the flavor, presentation and service, a little sub par. I'm sure my friends will drag me out again for the soju, but til that time Nahhh I'm good. I hope they do better next time around"}
{"text":"Their food was excellent and the service was exceptional as well!

Sometimes I feel as though when you sit outside, sometimes you're forgotten about. Not this time! Our server took great care of us and suggested great food as well because it was our first time. 

Being Korean myself, it is not very Korean inspired as impersonated. Yes, there is pickled diakon (which is not very good) and kimchi, but nothing really authentic. If you're looking for anything Korean, try again. If you're looking for some good food, give it a try!"}
{"text":"6:40pm seated 
6:51pm first time seeing our waitress
6:57 still no beer... oh wait she brought them. 

I didn't think service could get worse my first visit. From the seating to the 10+ minute wait to be acknowledged by our server, the whole experience was disjointed. 

Stuck to the wings, sweet potato nest, and kimchi fries. The kimchi fries came out much earlier than the rest of our food.  Not sure if that's typical or if it was a mistake. The wings are great. I would come back just for those."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited on 3/11/16 to kick off my birthday weekend. I had seen some blogs talk about Seoul Food and since I love Korean and Southern food, I knew I had to try it. There were a few kinks, it was hard to find parking near it (but that is to be expected on a Friday night I suppose) and there were several empty tables but we had to wait 20ish mins. Perhaps because they didn't want to overwhelm the servers/waitstaff. However 20 mins on a Friday night is not bad and the food was so worth it. 

Our waitress told us to pronounce her name \"Win\" (I'm not sure how to spell it) but she was amazing. She kept our drinks refilled, was very personable, and kept us updated on everything. She was very sweet and made sure every need we had was met without asking. 

The food was amazing. We had the crispy pork belly, pulled pork, ramen mac&cheese, potato swirl, kimchi cole slaw and the bao buns. Standouts were the pulled pork, ramen mac, and cole slaw (though I didn't try the buns because my husband devoured them). The pork belly was a tad too crispy and a tad too greasy, so I probably will try a different entree next time. The potato was good, but was a little to spicy for me. 

We were pleased with the portion size also. We went to a similar family-style bbq place in Brooklyn and the portions were tiny. However, we left Seoul Food full and with leftovers. I can't wait to come back and try more sides/entrees and I hope that they will include brunch on the weekends soon."}
{"text":"Really nice place. Simple menu, fully stocked bar, great service. This place is in a renovated part of Charlotte. Will be back to try the beef ribs."}
{"text":"SFMC, as they point out in their door when you walk in, isn't Korean BBQ, and that's totally ok.  What they're doing here is unique, and really special.  Combining an extensive Japanese beer list with Korean influenced southern BBQ and sides is a winning combination.  Even the kimchi kimbap is good, especially for breaking up the salty, fatty meats.  Overall, order a hitachino beer, and anything BBQ'd. Add a kimbap and some sides (potato swirl, broccoli gochuchang and some pinch buns are all good ideas) and you'll be in for an above average, relatively inexpensive, dinner for 3-4 people.  The service can be hit or miss, especially when they're busy and the inside and outside are open.  Also, the water, if you're outside, tends to taste plastic-ey.  Still we make a point to come back every couple of weeks.  Also, if it's raining, stop by, as they usually have some drink specials to entice you in."}
{"text":"Terrific time. Food was wonderful and great selection of beers & cocktails. Very fun, diverse games outside too."}
{"text":"Came back here this other night since my last visit. 

The wings were awesome. Last time I thought they were too heavily breaded- not this time. The garlic soy were very good. 

The fire chicken with the buns were great. 

Favorite of the night was the grapefruit beer! Omg so yummy! 

Service was on point and Dillion was awesome! 

They've seemed to improve since their opening. I'm sure this place will strive!"}
{"text":"Sorry, I believed the hype I read online but this place did NOT deliver on soooo many levels.  Their only vegetarian entree alternative is the tofu \"wings\".  Being that it's an Asian restaurant you would think they would know how to properly prepare tofu.  The huge 2\" cubes of tofu that came to the table were gelatinous, flavorless blobs.  Aside from the sauce they were dipped in, there was ZERO prep or attention paid to these.  The texture and consistency was nauseating.  I ate one half of ONE cube before realizing my meal was inedible.  I did order the Ramen Mac and Cheese (without the srirachi cracklings) and that was \"ok\", but nothing that would cause me to return here.  The spiral potato thing was decent.  Waitress asked what the problem was with my uneaten tofu and I told her in detail everything that was wrong with the dish.  She apologized and then promptly brought the bill and charged me for them.  

Really?  Feel empowered to make it right in the eyes of me, your customer, and swallow the $0.99 (for a $9 dish) you have invested in these tofu hunks and make me want to give you another chance.  There's absolutely ZERO reason for me to return here.  The generic industrial-chic decor is a positive.  That and the spiral potato thing.  That's all."}
{"text":"Great bbq place!!! Service was fast and friendly (5), food is ok last few times we were there and sometimes it was delicious but last time was ok (4), place looks great and the price as well."}
{"text":"Always a great experience -- and my mom's favorite! 

Never had anything that doesn't blow me away. Potato swirl is to die for, fire chicken is amazing.

Was told by server that food would take longer than usual due to kitchen power outage I believe, no problem! Food came in completely reasonable time, hot and fresh as ever.

Would return every day if I could."}
{"text":"Soy Garlic Wings:
BBQ Wings:

Texture: 
super crispy the kind that makes you write a song from the crunch...I know I'm not alone in this thought

Size: 
There are some huge finds in the box that leads me to think the wings don't belong in the drummette but drum size for scaling. I prefer wingette size.

Flavour: 
soy garlic: blend of perfection..a salted garlicky.sweetness.

bbq: so good and a splendid take on bbq sauce.

Overall I try to hit them up every 2 weeks for the wings that I will now order as mixed for the sauces..it's a meal that you don't have to dip or pour anything on...they do it, sooo well for you.welcome."}
{"text":"Food is delicious, a little over priced.

Drinks, bar, and outdoor activities are great."}
{"text":"Seoul Food Meat Company fills an interesting niche in the Charlotte restaurant scene.  

The menu is relatively simple - but, oh so great!  You have a selection of about 7 different types of meat - available in small (1/2 pound) and large (1 pound).  I really like the pork spare ribs and the beef rib (only available in large).  I found the crispy pork belly to be a bit fatty for my taste - but, hey, it's pork belly so it's hard to complain about it.  

Then, you have a selection of maybe 10 sides.  I love the brocolli salad and the crackling pork skins - but, I've tried almost all of the sides and haven't been disappointed. 

Now, what i really love is the chicken wings.  They are so darn tasty and addictive.  Available in soy ginger or spicy bbq - I like them both, but the soy ginger leads in the race.  

I usually go with my parnter - between the 2 of us, we choose one small meat, 10 piece wings and 2 sides.  This gives us plenty of food and a few leftovers.

This is not a quiet place - prepare for it to be loud if you're sitting inside.  Weather-permitting, I always prefer to sit outside.

This has become our go-to restaurant when friends/family are in from out of town - it consistently shines!"}
{"text":"Food:

If you never had KFC before (Korean fried chicken) then this is a must order. The chicken batter is soft but there's a crunch when you bite into it. They only have two flavors but the soy garlic & the spicy BBQ pack a punch of flavor in your mouth. Another item to get is the crispy pork belly. It's a unique take on traditional Korean Sam geyop sa. It has the right combination of being salty, soft & tender but also crunchy as they leave the skin on. The combo just works. The beef ribs looked like they got cut from a dinosaur. Yes they were that big but also very soft & moist. If you had traditional Korean BBQ chicken then the fire chicken is a must. The gochu jjang, the red pepper flakes and the chicken just work well together. Honestly everything was good from the ramen Mac & cheese, kimchi slaw, and the Sriracha cracklins (pork rinds) you can taste the traditional Korean flavors but with a American twist.  

Look/feel:

When you first walk in you notice the Kpop videos playing on the screens and blaring from the speakers. It kind of makes you feel like you're in ATL or DC. They keep the lights dim but it brings out the total ambiance of the restaurant. The original mixed drinks also has names like, \"keep pounding punch\" & \"Hornets sting.\" Let's you know that they take pride in this city & the local sports teams. They haven't got the shipment of soju in yet, but that's something that I'm excited for. Soju is like Korean vodka and it's great when mixed together. Now they do have sake as well as Japanese & local craft beer. 

All in all, the food was great and the ambiance makes you feel liked you stepped into Koreatown. Since this is a new restaurant they're still working out the kinks as well as working with a menu that isn't 100% established. But from what was sampled I can't wait to go back and to tell them to shut up and take my money."}
{"text":"What an awesome find in Charlotte! Coming from LA which is a mecca for Korean cuisine outside of Korea itself, it was a very pleasant surprise to find fusion of American barbecue and Korean flavors at Seoul Food. 

The (giant) beef rib had a hint of Korean flavors--don't forget the dipping sauce! While both flavors of the wings were good, I did like the soy garlic better. I took them back to the hotel on the first night, and they stayed crispy in spite of the travel. 

The tilapia is served whole fish preparation style, I absolutely recommend even if you're squeamish at the sight of the head. There's an Asian glaze on the fish which makes the facial features less distinct, and the flavors are definitely worth the adventure...plus you can't beat the $14 price tag!

 The bulgogi taco was also delish...can be a nice appetizer while waiting for your main event. The service was also very good. Gabby helped us the first night and she was great. Simon helped us the second day, andhe was good too. Sara came up and introduced herself to us; I think she may be a co-owner or manager.

This place is definitely a favorite in Charlotte...I do hope they expand all the way to LA! I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"We went to Seoul Food on a Saturday night and \"Brittany\" (actually Susan) was extremely rude.  The bartender lied to me about her name, and wouldn't tell my friends where to get water. We ordered tacos, wings, and drinks. We asked for water and Susan told us they didn't serve that. They never once told us that it was self serve until I approached the manager.  I'm extremely regretful I spent $40.00 at this establishment and received well below average service and was lied to repeatedly. The manner of the staff was severely unprofessional..."}
{"text":"Wings are really good.  Service is really bad.  And, the volume is unbearably loud inside.  The atmosphere out back is nice though.   If they solve the volume and service problems I'd  return."}
{"text":"Love coming here with a group of people and trying lots of dishes. Don't miss the chicken wings for sure! And fun cocktails."}
{"text":"Seoul has redefined wings for me. Crispy, big, meaty, and sauced so well. We did the half and half wings, kimchi slaw, Ramen Mac and cheese, and sweet potato birds nest. 

The best was the wings and service. The staff was personable and the wings were out of this world. The best amount of crisp and we got the half and half sauces. Both the spicy bbq and soy garlic were delicious. The spicy bbq sauce was essentially the same sauce as the sauce you get at most Korean restraunt to spice up your meal, but on the wings it was wonderful. But the soy garlic was my favorite. 

The staff was very friendly and multiple people checked up on our table to be sure that everything was good. They also had a pretty good beer menu with both Asian and local beer selections. 

The one thing we did not like was the ramen Mac and cheese. It was a little dry and underwhelming. The rest of the food was pretty great. The kimchi slaw was a welcome side dish and the sweet potato birds nest was the lil bit of sweet to top everything off perfectly. 

I will be back. Charlotte offers a lot of great places to eat, but this one will become a staple."}
{"text":"My fiance and I were really looking forward to dining at Seoul Food based on the reviews on Yelp. Plus, we love good Korean food and BBQ. We didn't think Seoul Food lived up to its Yelp hype. 

We arrived at 6:45 on a Friday and had an hour wait, which was expected!  We walked over to Unknown Brewery and had a beer while we waiting for our table.  Upon being seated, we each decided to get a cocktail since the drink reviews were so stellar on Yelp.  I ordered an old fashioned and my significant other ordered a martini.  When she set down my old fashioned and the liquid was completely clear, I knew it wasn't going to be good.  There was maybe a splash of bourbon, and the rest was water.  Really not good.  My significant other's martini sucked too. Same issue -- it was completely watered down.  Have no idea how it's even possible to water down a martini.

Anyway, our food came out quick, which we both appreciated.  We ordered 6 wings (half and half with soy garlic and spicy BBQ), pork belly, ribs, sriracha cracklings, bao buns and collard greens.  Here's my rundown on the food:

Wings:  The wings were amazing-- probably the best wings I've ever had.  They are really big and crunchy, and they have awesome flavor. Especially the soy garlic wings, and I generally prefer spicy! 5 stars.

Pork Belly:  The pork belly came to our table cold and without flavor.  This could be really good if they found a better way to flavor it.  I know that there is BBQ sauce, but pork belly is too delicious to have to smother it in BBQ sauce! 2 stars.

Ribs:  I really liked these, my SO wasn't as thrilled. The ribs came out cold too.  I thought that the ribs were seasoned well but slightly overcooked. 3 stars.

Sriracha cracklings: it's hard to mess these up.  They were good, but nothing special.  4 stars.

Collard Greens: These came out cold as well, and they didn't have any flavor.  2 stars.

I'll probably be back here, as a lot of my friends like the atmosphere and the food.  But when I come back, I am going to stick to the wings and beer!"}
{"text":"Yes, yes, yes, and yes! We passed by this place last year when visiting NC and this year we knew we had to stop in for some dinner.  So very glad that we did. We were seated immediately upon arriving (sans reservations).

Abstract, our server, was awesome.  Calm and cool, didn't mind all of our questions, refilled drinks in a timely manner, could do no wrong!

My husband and I ordered several things to share. The Spicy Wings were delicious, similar to Korean Fried Chicken wings we get at other places, so we were very happy with these. A Kimchi Pork Taco was also very tasty, though a little harder to share as it was a single taco. The bulgogi kim bap (not sushi!!!) was very good. We also had spring rolls, crispy and oh-so-good.  Their menu changes a bit from time to time, but something I always see on it are the Green Tea Sugar Biscuits.  Don't hesitate. Get them for dessert. Hell, get them for your appetizer, your meal, whatever, just get them. Sugary, crispy, cool, and melty all at the same time.  Yum.

We will be back in a few months when we are in town! Definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant several times and it's always been good. However, my experience today was less than desirable. My friend and I ordered the wings (excellent as always) and an order of the loaded mashed potato and ram and cheese. We each took a small bite and didn't care for either. I asked if I could swap mine out for a different side and explained that I didn't care for the taste of it. Well, long story short, the manager wouldn't exchange the items and told us that we'd still be charged for the ones we didn't eat.  I told her that I'd never dined anywhere that wouldn't fix the customer dissatisfaction (not that it's common) but it was to no avail.  Needless to say, I'll miss the wings because I won't be back and I'm now glad that my blogging group stopped having our monthly meetings there."}
{"text":"Unique Asian fusion food mostly in a Korean style. Eaten here many times and never ordered something I didn't like."}
{"text":"I love the idea of this restaurant! Its like Korea meets southern cooking. I came and got the beef rib which was probably the best meat ive ever had (pause). It was very juicy and tender. The rib looked like it was off the side of a bull! It was so good! 

For the sides we ordered the dirty rice x2 (soo good) broccoli (it was fresh broccoli with gochujang sauce on top) and the kimchi ramen chili (good but tasted more like chili than kimchi). We also had the extra kimchi cucumbers which was really good! We also got the The potato swirl which was ok at best. 

For dessert it was the green tea biscuits. Basically was green tea ice cream with doughnuts which was awesomee. One of the few places id say id come back for!"}
{"text":"Good place to go with a group to try different things. Everything comes out on big metal trays versus individual plates - picture meat on a sheet tray.

Wings: the wings brought this from a 3 star to 4 star restaurant in my opinion. They have a thick, crunchy shell like I've never had anywhere else and the inner meat is tender. Overall flavor is on the tangy side and delicious!

Pork belly: a bit on the fatty side with skin crispy like a pork rind. Tastiest when dipped in accompanying sauce

Short ribs: huge portion - order this to share or if you have a huge appetite. Very juicy with good flavor, although I've had better at other American BBQ joints

Potato swirl: a fun side that reminds you of something you'd get at a fair. The sauce is spicy and tasty

Sweet Potato Birdsnest: we couldn't figure out how to eat this - hard to pick up, broke into a ton of pieces, on the dry side. Not impressed.

Ramen Mac and cheese: novel idea, but not quite a success - difficult to eat (you can't fork ramen) and tasted like Velveeta

Overall, the atmosphere is good and the food is an American spin on Korean and a good spot to go if you're craving meat and carbs and drinks served in pineapples or coconuts."}
{"text":"We came here with high hopes and excitement but left disappointed and underwhelmed. We ordered the crispy pork belly and received a low quality, mass of pork dripping with grease. The sauce that came with it was good but didn't get enough. The tuna Kimbap had mayo, which is ok, since this is not a truly traditions Korean restaurant but an excessive amounts. The wings were on steroids and the sauce was not good at all as The Kimchi slaw sauce. A waste of $50."}
{"text":"Wow! The fat brisket taco made me kick my boyfriend. It was that good. Abstract the server was a pleasure. I will be back to try it all!"}
{"text":"I've come here quite a bit, this is a great place to go with a group. If you order a bunch of small dishes you can share and get quite a variety. It's got great wings although there is a lot of batter on them. All the sauces are delicious though. The meats are all very good. The sides often have vinegar or soy, so I tend to stay away from most of the veggies. It's not a place to go if you're watching calories, as you'll definitely leave stuffed and salted. They have a wide variety of drinks, so it's great for beers or soju to try the local Korean drinks. If you are scheduling a bday dinner this place is perfect. Always a fun atmosphere and nice staff."}
{"text":"Being a vegetarian this place wasn't too ideal for me unfortunately. The ambiance was pretty cool though. The staff could have been a little more helpful but I think they were just a little busy. My favorite thing was the hot ginger tea. Being a girl that loveeeees Mac and cheese and lovessss ramen, even though I was a little skeptical to try the ramen Mac and cheese I was still very intrigued! Needless to say, I'll stick to eating my Mac and cheese regular as well as my ramen but hey to each his own, this place just wasn't it for me."}
{"text":"Family style portions(shareable). Small/simple menu, easy to order.  Garlic Spicy BBG (half & half) were amazing, big, juicy, and crispy. Will order more next time. Kimchi Chili Mac was fulfilling and good. I will not be ordering the baked Mac and cheese ramen - too dry. Bulgaria roll not impressed needed some dressing. Pineapple beer was good. All for $40.

Great atmosphere. Was greeted right away. Waitress was very patient and helpful. Recommend a few items."}
{"text":"I love Seoul. The food is wonderful and the karaoke rooms are very clean and they have a good song selection. Looking forward to the summer, their patio looks awesome!!!!!?"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The soy garlic chicken wings are a real winner and the patio is wonderful, so many great games. Try the pineapple beer, surprisingly delicious!!"}
{"text":"Wow.

I had been waiting for a good time to get over and try out Seoul, and finally made the time with some friends on Saturday night. I repeat, wow. Nothing could have prepared me for the deliciousness that awaited. 

My fiancee and I arrived around 7:45 to put our names on the list. We milled around the bar area and checked out the menu while waiting on the other two in our party. A couple of TVs in the dining room were playing college football games, and the two TVs at the bar were playing Korean (I presume) music videos with the audio coming thru the house speakers. The place was packed, which is obviously a good sign, and we were finally seated around 8:15.

While still waiting on friends we placed an order for the pimento corn cheese. A healthy scoop of the pimento corn cheese is served with what I can only describe as a potato chip that has the texture of a cheese puff... or a cheese puff in the shape of a potato chip. Anyway, so good. The sweetness of the corn was a great complement to the pimento cheese.

Once everyone arrived, we essentially just ordered everything on the menu. I personally got the pulled pork which had great flavor and the lightly drizzled sauce added a nice zing to the dish. I would highly recommend the Ramen Mac 'n' Cheese, a creamy mac 'n' cheese dish with ramen noodles serving as the pasta. I also tried the crispy park belly (meh), sriracha cracklins (great flavor with the sriracha powder, but I've never cared for cracklins), and the sweet potato birds nest (essentially stringy fried sweet potato rolled up into the shape of a bird's nest).

The service was excellent, especially given how busy they were. Our waiter (Jude I believe his name was [Hey Jude {great song |I digress|}]) took great care of us even though it was our first time, we were indecisive, and had SO many questions. 

Hitting up the beef ribs next time with a side of who the heck knows?!"}
{"text":"Great food ordered from postmates. I must say very very delicious. Only thing I wish portions was bigger but I'm just being greedy lol will return again."}
{"text":"Get the soy garlic wings - best wings in town. Such a fun concept for a day and/or night out with friends.  Great for sharing.  It can be challenging going as a date night - make sure you're ready to eat lots!"}
{"text":"Unique vibe and atmosphere. Delicious food served in a casual style. We were checked on multiple times by our waiter and other staff. The wings were great."}
{"text":"Very awesome, unique place.  We shared pork belly, wings (with half spicy and half soy garlic), and collard greens.  We also tried their watermelon soju.  Everything was very good.  Pork belly was very crispy, too much so for my boyfriend, but I loved it.  Very salty though.  Wings were great.  And the soju was served in a watermelon.

I would definitely go back and try more things, but for 3 people we were stuffed."}
{"text":"The food there is great.  I love the pork belly, it's so good along with everything on their menu.  The staff was very friendly and attentive. I'm new in this city so it's nice to finally find great food here. The kimchi and the pork is a must try, but everything is great.  Very laid back atmosphere. Must try u won't regret it."}
{"text":"Wings and kimchi fries are a must!  Gets crowded but as long as you can deal with that you're good."}
{"text":"The siracha cracklins were the highlight. They were still \"cracklin\" in the basket at my table. I was disappointed in the potato swirl thing, just didn't have that much flavor. I also ordered two flavors of wings. It took 3 attempts to bring me the half and half I ordered, no big deal, the waiter was nice and kept trying until he got it right. Probably just personal preference, but the breading was too thick for my taste, and the BBQ sauce didn't do it for me. The soy flavor was better, but those 3 wings will be my last ones. Although the place had a cool vibe, nice outdoor back bar, and a unique play yard for adults (plus a dog park), it's not really someplace I'd go back to."}
{"text":"For all you meat lovers this is the place for you. It's cute, fast and good. Make no mistake, bring your appetite. I'm not a heavy beef or pork eater but I wanted to get in on this new sensation. While it didn't disappoint, it was too heavy for me. But I can say that the Pork Belly and BbQ Ribs were outstanding. You'll need plenty of water if you get the meat platter. Short of giving it a five star is because the \"strongest\" cocktail there was not strong at all. And I'm a cocktail having Woman with my meal. The sides are a la carte, which is good so you can create your own meal. The game area is so cool with its kickball pool. Oh and it's dog friendly(the game area)"}
{"text":"This was a great slice of innovation.  The tacos had fresh, interesting flavor ideas and the pork belly strips were of a perfect combination of meat and fat.  Crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.  I highly recommend you give this place a shot."}
{"text":"I visited on a busy Saturday night.  When we arrived they were on an hour and a half wait. We were added to the list, and were told they would call when our table was ready. We walked to Palmer St. Game bar to pass the time.The beef ribs and wings were fantastic. The staff was pleasant. I would say that a different system to handle the wait list ought to be devised. It seemed the system used when I was there was terribly inefficient. Text messages would be better than a phone call for both staff and customer. I'd come again."}
{"text":"Korean food is one of my favorite cuisines and moving from A2 has upped my standard for this delicious cuisine. The food here was fun and whimsical. There was a lot of fusion with various cultures and I loved the homemade sauces and indoor/outdoor seating! Food wise...I love the wings (note get a mix) and the watermelon lemonade- get those both for sure on your next visit here!"}
{"text":"I've never had anything bad here. This is another spot I take my visiting friends too. It's a nice casual place for dinner. If you don't get the wings in the honey garlic then you are missing out. I order them every time. Nothing on the menu is as food as the wings. They are HUGE too. Honorable mentions are the ramen Mac n cheese and the fire chicken. If you're feeling adventurous, try the soju. It's really refreshing. The back patio is so fun for a group at night. You can have food ordered out their or get drinks at their bar and play pool soccer, beer pong, or a few other games. Dogs welcome on the back patio. There's a fenced in area for them :)"}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant for tapas and a good night with some friends. Located in the plaza midwood area, it offers the same chic, yet affordable dining experience found through the neighborhood. The short rib tacos and Brussel sprouts should both be on your order."}
{"text":"Found this little baby online and when we got there they made it clear that they are not traditional which was fine with me."}
{"text":"Cute little Korean American fusion place! The wings they have here are kind of similar to Bon Chon or Kyo Chon (Korean fried chicken). 

In line with the name of the restaurant, the majority of the menu is meat. Non-meat eaters will not be able to find much to choose from.

Interior atmosphere is nice but parking is lacking (few spaces available for the demand and the lot isn't paved)."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I, being new to NC, decided that on the day that NC State was playing at BoA stadium to go to Seoul Food. Needless to say, it had better be worth fighting traffic and being stopped by people walking and big coach buses holding players. 

And it was. It was definitely packed around the area but we found a parking spot and went in -- it was crowded and loud but we got a table for two quickly. Joey was our server and he was very helpful in giving us an overview of how things worked, and checked up on us frequently after we got our food, plus gave us the weekly specials that we could capitalize on later, which was super cool.

Of course, our eyes are bigger than our stomachs and we ordered way too much -- a medium half&half order of Korean-style fried wings, kimchi fries, and the brisket and pulled pork taco. We didn't know that the kimchi fries came with the bulgogi-marinated brisket, which was a pleasant surprise. For 4 bucks, you can't beat the side of fries -- they're a large basket piled high with kimchi and brisket and an aioli sauce. You don't need ketchup for those! We both liked the fried wings, although we agreed that the spicy one was probably better. It's not too spicy and the sauces are thick on both wings. You definitely need to wash your hands after those. The tacos are overstuffed with meat and pickled veggies and were great, although by the time we tackled those we were full!

As for drinks, I got the Lychee Temple, which is just a Shirley Temple with lychee flavoring -- really good as a contrast to the food there. Next time I will try a cocktail and see how that goes. 

Overall an amazing experience! Definitely would like to try it again :)"}
{"text":"This place exceeded my expectations! I don't usually expect a lot from bbq fusion but this place had great flavors. My boyfriend and I went on a Saturday and got pork belly and pulled pork. The crispy pork belly was actually crispy! Everything was served family style and there were pickles included. We also got some baos to stuff everything in. Bill came out to be $30. Service was a little slow but not ridiculous, we were very happy with the experience. 

I think they are expanding to include an outdoor area and they have parking behind the building."}
{"text":"I love the concept and how all the meats are put on a tray to be shared with the table. I LOVE their sides especially the Kimchi fries. The deviled eggs are okay, I wouldn't get them again. However, the crispy pork belly is disappointing. I definitely will not get them again. They were too chewy and too salty. They do look so good though. I really like the chicken wings, even though I think they are a wee bit salty. I think they would be fine if you eat the radish with them, but I don't like radish so I just ate them alone."}
{"text":"Decided to make a trip to CLT for the 4th of July weekend and stumbled onto this place on yelp. No regrets. Got their pork belly with a side of kimchi fries, bao buns, and tomato salad. The pork belly was moist with a bit of crisp on the skin that went well when you made a sandwich with the bao bun and tomato salad. Give this place a try and you won't regret it.

{"text":"First time at Seoul and I see why people were excited about this experience! Let's start with the entertainment- there are karaoke rooms for rent, there is an amazing patio space with soccer pool (Google it), beer pong, cornhole, and a full dog run space. On the inside there was a Bloody Mary and Mimosa bar set up!  I am a vegetarian and there were a ton of options for me. My boyfriend ordered the wings and pork belly. I was impressed that the spiked seltzer waters were on the menu! Overall the food was awesome. So original and perfect for the Southend vibe."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place.. try the wings and ribs for sure! Then ramen Mac and cheese is awesome."}
{"text":"This place is unique and fantastic! We tried several items from the menu and loved them all! We can't wait to return and try others."}
{"text":"Seoul Food puts a mouth-watering spin on two totally different food cultures, Korean and American Southern, and pulls off an affordable high-concept restaurant that is perfect for date night, groups, vegetarians and hard-to-please food geeks.

The atmosphere was hip and the service impeccable; my late October visit was made even better relaxing outside on their picnic tables. Not packed on a Monday night, dinner here was the perfect follow-up to flight night across the street at Craft. The wings were much larger than expected, due in part to the generous crispy exterior and splitting the order between the spicy and soy garlic provided some nice balance and taste variety. Crispy pork belly was no joke and the pimento corn cheese had a great combination with the puffy chips and cool, smooth dip.

The casual nature and brown paper presentation of some of the dishes is a nice contrast to the obvious care and attention paid to food, drinks and the overall experience. There are plenty of great dining experiences of all types around Charlotte and Seoul Food is right there at the top for fans of South End."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh! So my friend and I are always trying to find new restaurants to try and I am so glad we (she) finally found this one. Let's start with the location - perfectly tucked away but still right in South End! plenty of parking to the side of the building. 

Our server (it kills me that I can't remember her name) was so sweet and asked if we had dined there before. when we said we hadn't, she took her time explaining the menu to us. 

Everything sounded so good, but we decided on the fire chicken, mac & cheese ramen, potato swirl, and sriracha cracklins. My favorite, hands down, was the ramen. IT WAS SO GOOD I was scraping the cheese off of the side of the cardboard container. 

The fire chicken was so tender and juicy. We ordered a small and I still had enough to take home. The potato swirl was good and reminds me of festival food but with flair. Our least favorite were the cracklins, which were still good, but just kinda reminded us of spicy pork rinds. 

We will definitely be back - soon! I wish I could give more kudos to our server as she really was the sweetest. They're inexpensive and they play super cool K-Pop videos that my friend and I couldn't stop watching. 

Yum! :)"}
{"text":"I was genuinely excited to visit Seoul. Great name and concept. Sadly, I was left thinking it was too much of a hype. Which, can be shaky my respected fellow yelpers! I don't want to discourage you from trying it. I have been to some excellent Korean places with the american twist which may be in part why I feel a bit of a disillusioned....just keep in mind, Charlotte continues to grow its \"gastro-scene!\" 

Ultimately, I thought it just didn't make sense. I get what they are trying to do but it just didn't work for me. The Ramen Mac&cheese, well, great concept but it didn't work after it's not longer 100% freshly served 
The beef rib was very fatty and didn't have much flavor. The pork belly? How do you ruin this? I am sorry, but no flavor whatsoever. The braised fish taco, I only took a small bite and I was done with it. 

I am sorry I started off w the negative. What I can definitely say is that I WILL be BACK for their drinks and great wings! I really couldn't complaint about those two!

Thank you for letting me Yelp/Vent;)"}
{"text":"Multiple occasions I've been here and my husband and I have said \"this may be my favorite restaurant in Charlotte.\" It is always consistent with delicious food and the best service. Everyone is so welcoming from the moment you walk in to the bartender serving drinks. It makes it a great place to take out of town guests as well. The deviled eggs are my favorite along with the fish taco! Definitely get the wings, as well."}
{"text":"A total gem! The crispy pork belly is out of this world. Be prepared to wait for your table. I'm impatient and get hangry but I still think it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Except the loudness, everything is good . 
The fish tacos are the best I have ever had. The chicken wings are tasty. Ribs are soft , could use a little more sauce/seasoning. Service was fast and courteous. 
Over all we had a good time and enjoyed the food."}
{"text":"The soy garlic wings ARE OFF THE CHAIN GOOD !!!! Holy mole these wings are tasty. They have a barbecue wing too but it's good. It is saucy too. The atmosphere is awesome. They have these little karaoke rooms but there are expensive to rent for an hour. They're drinks are good too. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I feel like Seoul is that person you knew in school who so desperately wanted to be part of the \"cool\" crowd but their efforts always felt a tad forced. For a dining establishment, they have all of the wanna-be elements: bar with local drafts and flavored beers, outside patio which also includes an area to play games, and a dining 'concept' that sounds equal parts interesting and completely made-up.

The concept is that they're not a traditional Korean restaurant but lean more heavily towards southern BBQ fare, yet find a way to combine the two. For my last visit, I went with a group of coworkers (most of whom had already dined here before, only two had not) and the two newbies were still completely confused after the waiter gave the restaurant's elevator pitch.

If you are a newbie to Seoul, please note there is a dedicated parking lot. It's small and will fill up quickly during peak times, as to be expected. Hopefully, you'll be able to score a spot on the surrounding streets. You can choose to dine inside or outside. For the patio, they have water misters going on hot days. The menu is a la carte because sharing is caring! Also, there are themed karaoke rooms (such as a country, hip hop, etc) that can be rented per hour, obviously you will have to book these rooms in advance.

Food: most people are going to tell you to get the wings. Personally, the wings have not blown me away and you get more breading than you do meat but I'm in the minority here when it comes my opinion of their wings. So I'd say try them because you may like them.

However, my recommendation is the kimchi fries. The fries seem to most encapsulate their fusion concept. There's meat (bulgogi), some sort of Asian dressing sauce, and a traditional Korean element, that being the kimchi. They're just the right portion size and do a good job of soaking up any alcohol you may choose to have with them.

 As for drinks, I'm basic and have had the grapefruit shandy (comes served with a slice of grapefruit). You can't beat a citrusy beer on a hot, summer day. Also, when dining with a group, go with one of the flavored sojus. My group of coworkers and I easily sucked down the watermelon soju.

From the bartender to the waiter, service was excellent. All were super friendly and willing to describe any menu items/offer suggestions."}
{"text":"Seoul Food has absolutely amazing food, quick service even when crowded, and is my new go-to Charlotte restaurant. The wings are fantastic (I recommend the half and half) as is the mac and cheese ramen. My favorite surprise on my last visit was the Sunday all day mimosa bar with a huge selection of juices (like watermelon mint and pineapple basil). Make sure to check this place out!"}
{"text":"I order take out from here frequently. If the takeout is good I know if I ate it fresh I would pass out due to deliciousness overload."}
{"text":"This is probably the best Seoul food slash Korean BBQ spot in Charlotte. I've been meaning to take my wife here for months. Needless to say she loves it! Great food at awesome prices. We'll make this a go to for our Korean fix."}
{"text":"Fantastic atmosphere, attentive service, and delicious food - no complaints here! The fella and I stopped in around 5 pm on a Saturday (I know, early bird special), and we were promptly seated. I loved the concrete floors and aluminum chairs (which were pretty comfy for aluminum) and the twinkly lights strung above. Even though it had an industrial feel, it was still cozy. And I did love the constant Asian rap videos/music playing... super fun vibe.

I wish I could tell you our waitress' name because she was so helpful and fun! She gave us the quick rundown on the menu, and we decided to try a little bit of everything. Here's how the food shook out:

- Small order of wings (6 total) half & half on the sauce: the wings are bigger than I expected, so I'm glad we went small. The fella loves a little heat, but the spicy wings were too messy for him. He needed a wet wipe and two napkins after just one wing. The soy garlic were amazing - great balance of sweet and salt.
- Crispy pork belly: the fella's favorite, just okay for me. The fried part was so hard, I thought I was gonna crack a tooth.
- Pulled pork : my favorite, by far. I almost got the meat sweats just from this.
- Dirty white rice: pretty good, but just a dollop of a sesame/soy pasty dressing on top of white rice.
- Potato swirl: not really spicy like they say, but they do sprinkle sriracha dust on the spiral. The sauce it comes with didn't add anything to it. Pretty darn tasty.

All that plus two glasses of wine and a Red Clay cider cost just under $70. A steal!

They have a ton of drink options, too - local craft beer, Asian craft beer, cider, wine, cocktails, sake, and other fun options. We sat at the bar for an after-dinner drink and saw waitresses carving up huge watermelons and pouring liquor into them.

It was too hot the day we went, but there was also a pretty cool looking patio with umbrellas along Church St.

I know the reviews on this place have been mixed, and it's possible we were just there on their best day yet, but we couldn't find anything not to like about this place!"}
{"text":"Oh Seoul, you know the way to my heart with your Korean flavors and innovated dishes. It all started with a coworker bringing some of your wings into our office and I was hooked. 

Came hear for happy hour and some bites to eat. The environment is cool. It's a clean industrial wood look, with music videos playing on several flatscreens. 

Our server was great and answered all of our questions. The food is served family style and comes out on the same tray. And some items may come out faster than others. Think Korean tapas style. The menu has a lot of unique items so be sure to ask questions. They also have a variety of adult beverages and local brews on tap. 

I ordered a bulgogi taco, chee chili ramen and collard greens. The bulgogi taco was my favorite. It was messy, but massive and packed a punch of flavor. The bulgogi was sweet and delicious. It had crunch and spice. It took me back to when I had the best bulgogi of my life at a food truck on the North Shore of Hawaii. The greens were spicy and had plenty of pork belly. The chili was interesting. It was a little spicy, but reminded me of a chili Mac. On the bottom was their take on Mac and cheese using ramen instead of macaroni. Service was on point. They were great at keeping our table clean and our cups full. 

We eventually moved out to the patio. On the way we saw the private karaoke rooms which you can rent by the hour. I love karaoke! On the patio, there's a bar and tons of games: giant jenga, cornhole, and oversized pool game.  I haven't laughed so hard in a long time while playing pool. It's pool, but with soccer balls and is harder than it looks. 

We're already planning to come back to eat and karaoke. If you like good drinks, food and fun, you have to check Seoul Meat Company out!"}
{"text":"First time trying Seoul Food Meat Company due to the high reviews on Yelp. The service was prompt and the waitress was extremely patient with first time customers and willing to give suggestions and opinions on menu items. One great suggestion was the mimosa bar which I absolutely loved. We opted for an entire bottle of champagne for $20 which was a great value considering the price of just one glass. The bar was well stocked, clean and easy to use. 

Food wise The restaurant became mediocre and inconsistent. The pulled pork was absolutely delicious, a rich smokey flavor and tender meat. I paired it with the bao buns which allowed me to make my own mini pulled pork sandwiches. The sauce for the pork is definitely not your typical southern vinegar based sauce but a slightly spicy and smokey tomato based recipe, totally delicious and unexpected. 

The pork tacos were good but uninspired. The portions were well worth the cost. We ordered two but upon receiving them realized one would have been sufficient. They consisted of pulled pork, Asian slaw, a tangy sauce topped with brined cucumbers all sitting on a flat bread type base. While they weren't bad there was nothing to warrant going to Seoul Food Market just for them. They could have been pork tacos at any restaurant. 

We ordered the pimento corn cheese which gets an A+ for presentation. Served on a metal tray piled on a heaping serving of shrimp chips (chips with shrimp flavored seasoning). The pimento cheese was a bland generic concoction. While the addition of the shrimp chips was unique the dish as a whole was disappointing. 

The final thing ordered was the ramen mac and cheese. This item came highly recommended on yelp. Upon trying it I was disappointed but this item more than anything else. While upending the traditional mac and cheese format was intriguing the dish fell flat. The cheese sauce poured over the ramen noodles was reminiscent of craft macaroni and cheese. I was surprised but this given the high reviews of the item.

All in all Seoul Food Market is a niche restaurant worth giving a visit. We'll be returning and trying different items next time."}
{"text":"Great food and energy in this place. I love the wings and fire chicken!! The drinks are delicious. My favorite is the lychee soda and the watermelon margarita! It's loud, social, and fun. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place has delicious food at rally good prices. I wouldn't call it the best of the best, but it's quite good. The wings are very tasty and flavorful but they're really heavily breaded. They have fun creative ideas like chili ramen kimchi mac and cheese, but the flavor of that side I was so looking forward to pretty much fell flat. I couldn't take the kimchi and the chili really overpowered everything. My friend got the \"sweet potato nest\" which was really a hardened fried ball of sweet potato \"strings\" and was very difficult to eat. 

I think this place has a lot of potential. I love traditional Korean food, and the idea of creating a southern fusion flare is really fun, especially when done family style, but they just have some more tweaking to do. 

Also, I asked about which of their cocktails was \"not sweet\" and I was recommended something that tasted like a lolly pop. Pretty much missed the mark there. 

I'd go back again because the prices were really low for the volume of food you get, and I absolutely love the atmosphere, but I think they have an opportunity to refine the flavors in their dishes a bit (at least the half dozen or so that I tried.)"}
{"text":"So while in Charlotte for a year, I had been meaning to check this place out for a while given the word of mouth traffic that it seems to get among fellow travelers to the city. We finally were able to have a \"team dinner\" and made our way over to this joint after making a reservation on a weekday. The joint was busy already by the time we walked in and continued to be busy as the night progressed. The joint itself has enough tables for groups and tables along with a bar hosting a suite of drinks. 

We were seated in the middle of the dining room with our group of 10 people eagerly awaiting our menus/meals. The server was very helpful and very quick to provide anything the group needed. I was certainly excited to see the \"Korean spin\" given my roots on southern bbq. After perusing the menu, the group decided to order the beef ribs, pulled pork, the pork belly, and the fire chicken for meats. We then proceeded to order the wings along with the ramen mac and cheese, the kimchi  fries, and tacos. We accompanied all this food with of course some soju . The food came out fairly quickly on large platters and we were all able to get a flavor of all the different food. Starting with the sides, the kimchi fries were delicious and simple and offered a good way to start the meal and great for any fry lovers. The ramen mac and cheese was good although it seemed just more standard mac and cheese then the fusion flavoring I was searching for but still a solid dish. The tacos were delicious and they all disappeared fairly quickly from the table. The meats were all very tender and well cooked. The beef rib came out on a huge bone and was tender off the bone. The pulled pork was again delish with the meat being tender and the marinade being just right on them. The pork belly was crispy on the outside with the frying process and were good. I think they were probably my least memorable but definitely worth a buy especially with groups. The fire chicken was BOMB. The chicken is honestly so juicy and tender and just packed with flavor. My buddy and I were busy inhaling all bites of this and instantly regretted when we ran out of it. The chicken wings were also good. They were standard wings to me that I could get anywhere else so no fusion aspect which was slightly disappointing but overall all the food was very good.

I am glad that I was able to check this place out prior to leaving Charlotte. It certainly has great service, great food, and a fun atmosphere. This is definitely worth a  stop for any people in Charlotte and for any BBQ lovers."}
{"text":"Making it simple
Pros:
Location cool
Server was great
Drinks ok - yuzu and lychee drinks
Sides were ok to good .. Mac/eggs
Pork belly was well fried pork belly ...ruin that and u really suck. Portion was good.

Cons 
Wings battered and the batter steams the chicken. Nah man. Also the flavor bland and too much batter.
Sauces are made for the lowest common denominator. 
Expensive. Price did not match quality.

If you ever had decent bbq or decent Korean a mash up sounds like a easy win.
Well.... That didn't happen.

Basic bros and broads and the hot new I'm cool because I'm here folks will like it.
If you like food you can pass. I could possibly come back to try a couple of sides I didn't get but overall... I'm good on this place. Plus I don't feel so well.

{"text":"I ordered the tilapia and it was different. They fry the fish whole and bring it out head and everything. Pretty cool. But it wasn't my favorite. To drink I had a Lychee Temple which was presented beautifully and taste very good! My Fiancé ordered the Pork Belly and he loved it. He said it's probably the best so far. My brother ordered the fire chicken and he didn't care too much for it. They don't have a lot of options. The menu is pretty small, I would love to see more things added. The food in my opinion is just okay but the employees makes up for it. Our waitress Sarah was very nice and always made sure our drinks were filled. Another male employee came and helped me out when he noticed I was sorta confused on how to start eating my tilapia. I didn't get his name but he was very helpful. Overall, I love the atmosphere and I will be back just because everyone was very nice and welcoming."}
{"text":"I had to write a review about our first experience here, only for the fact that the wings were the best I have ever had in Charlotte.  The soy garlic sauce is subtle yet delicious and they are fried to absolute perfection.  Also, they are HUGE!  I don't know what kind of birds these people are using, but I'm all about it. 

Unfortunately we only got to try the mac and cheese because they were out of a lot of things, but I would like to come back to get the crispy pork belly and ribs.  I had the watermelon lemonade (with Tito's!) which was pretty incredible.  They have a great selection of local brews, too. 

We were quoted an hour wait when we walked in, which was odd because there was only one couple waiting in the lobby area.  My partner and I found a couple seats at the bar within 10 minutes and when I let the hostess know, she said we were next on the list.  Come on girl, you quoted an hour and it was only 10 minutes??  That's alarming because I probably would not have stayed if this wasn't our first visit.  I would suggest a phone/text system so patrons can hang out in the neighborhood if you're expecting hour to hour and half waits.

Nonetheless, I'll most likely be back to get the wings to-go or for a quick bite at the bar."}
{"text":"Why this \"restaurant\" has 4 stars ceases to amaze me...

The best way I can describe the style of their food is food truck style: expensive, small portioned, poorly executed. We spent $40 on two small and dry kimchi sausages (lg portion on their menu), mac and cheese ramen (which was cheddar cheese melted on ramen noodles) and bao buns (probably the best thing we had). All of the items we ordered were served in the same cheap brown boxes you get from a food truck. The service was very slow, even though the restaurant wasn't busy. 

They spent all their money on the attractions and not enough effort on the food."}
{"text":"Good variety of well prepared food in a casual up-scale atmosphere.  Good people watching at the bar where their excellent drinks are handy!  Only complaint was the paper/cardboard they serve your food on.  A bit cheap - apparently they are trying too hard to be different."}
{"text":"Wings are awesome,  the half and half is the best.

Pork belly is is both crisp and chewy, but in a good way .

The Korean donkey, ( their mule) is great.
I can't leave without having a few. A great fusion experience !"}
{"text":"Love this place! Totally dig the vibes as well(kpop music playing in the background). Before you enter there's a sign clearly stating that it's not going to be authentic Korean food, so don't come here expecting authentic Korean food!The concept here is like family style where everyone shares everything which is awesome so everyone can try out all the dishes! The sides are actually really big for $4 btw. We ordered a bunch of food, wings, fish tacos, potato swirl, ramen mac and cheese, pimento corn, Seoul garden salad, etc. The ramen mac and cheese was good but eat it while it's hot or else when it gets cold the cheese gets all stiff!! Our waitress was also awesome, she had such a fun and upbeat attitude(: I can't wait to come back and try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"Excellent fish tacos, broad selection of beers, and even better chicken wings. The customer service was on point, as expected in NC!! They have cool karaoke rooms, never seen anything like that before. The outdoor patio area is made for dog owners, not to mention the adjacent bar is equally as accommodating as the inside... perhaps better during warmer weather. I must try if you're in the area. You won't be disappointed---great for casual eats"}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed this restaurant. The atmosphere is relaxed and date-worthy. The food has an interesting take on Southern plus Korean barbecue. This is definitely not the typical Korean barbecue joint that you would go to for KBBQ. But I appreciated the influential Korean flavors that were infused in the mains. Definitely would recommend the kimchi fries!"}
{"text":"So I'm SOUTH korean hehe.. and appreciate traditional as well as clever fusion type of Korean food.
I love this place, their flavors are good and korean or not their bbq is on point. 
TRY their beef ribs, the sweet sauce it comes with I can drink straight out of pan. The beef rib is MOIST, you know you love that word and completely fall off the bone. 
The atmosphere is great with a fun back patio and very friendly staff. Just note for any Koreans, they don't speak Korean.. I tried once and all I got was a \"bow\" every time they saw me lol! 
Their \"KFC\" or korean fried chicken is amazing, better then BONCHON that opened recently for KFC. Very Crispy and light between their yangyam spicy sauce and their sweet soy honey based sauce. 
Their Kimbap roll is very flavorful especially the bull go gi Kimbap! If they can somehow incorporate some grill off the table for korean bbq, that be a great idea too! 
Anyhow, I would just come here for the wings and drinks alone all summer long!"}
{"text":"I would say I am very adventurous when it comes to food and have been looking for a restaurant with Korean dishes. While this is a fusion restaurant and does not offer true Korean fare I still appreciate the dishes. One of my favorite items on the menu are the wings (I personally love the half and half of spicy and soy garlic). I got a bunch of sides such as the birds nest, Sriracha cracklings, and the potato swirl. We also ordered the pork belly tacos. All of these items are shareable and come in great portions. I had a great server and awesome food so you can't beat that. I can't wait for the next time that I go (I already have my order ready!!)"}
{"text":"Staff extremely friendly.  Menu was a little hard to understand. Ordering s family style.  We wasn't too hungry so we order some side dishes. Sweet Potato Birds Nest, Fish Tacos, Fatty Beef Taco, Ramen Mac Cheese and Green Tea Corn Bread. Food very flavorful. Will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"This is not your typical Korean BBQ joint. The interior looks more like your hole in the wall southern BBQ place with a slight upscale twist. We were in the mood for some KFC and ordered the wings. While they were good- they did not satisfy my craving for Korean fried chicken. Their blueberry lager was OUTSTANDING. I was so sad to find out that it's not sold commercially. Will be back to try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"One of the best wings in Charlotte!  They could be a bit hotter, but they are enormous and very flavorful!  The fire chicken is hot and awesome!  Got the pork belly one time, but was not too impressed with it.  Service has been good every time I have gone.  Go and feed your soul you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Disappointing to put it in a word. We grabbed seats at the outside bar but were assailed by the overpowering smell of a paint job near the counter. The cocktails were sickly sweet but luckily they had beer. As for the food - Everything was sweet! No, not all Korean food is supposed to be sweet! Went in with very high hopes thanks to Yelp that's rarely (if ever) let me down!"}
{"text":"Crazy good place with an incredible variety!  Come hungry and leave stuffed with goodness you won't find anywhere else."}
{"text":"Best wings ever!!! Just bring your own blue cheese or have it at home! We get them 1-2 times a week so good always super crispy!!!"}
{"text":"Omgoodness this place is fantastic. We got the pulled pork, bao buns (amazing), potato swirl (which is a skewered potato sprinkled with sriracha seasoning), kimchi slaw and what's called not a sushi roll. 

Our waiter Abstraxxx is amazing! Fantastic recommendations and is passionate about his art and the offerings at this amazing (have I said amazing enough?!) restaurant. 

I'm from Socal so eating good is my passion and I would totally recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times and it is always a home run!  This is a great place to go with a big group of people.  The menu is set up to try a lot of different things and to share.  The wings are constantly raved as the best in town (soy garlic are my favorite but if it is your first time do that half and half).  The portions of the proteins are generous (1/2 a fire chicken is good for 2 ppl to share).  I have tried most of the sides but my favorites are the ramen mac, choiang broccoli (amazing) and my personal favorite the spiral potato (a must have).  The atmosphere is really cool and its a good spot to just hang out and drink.  The back porch is a lot of fun to go watch a game or grab some drinks with friends.  They have a lot of beers on tap and even a fruit punch beer which is a combination of all the shandy and fruit lagers on tap.  They do have some quirks (no soy sauce and they won't serve a beer on tap on the back porch in the main dining area) but nothing to ruin your overall experience.  Strongly recommend to try this place out!"}
{"text":"Planned a girl's birthday dinner there (mine actually) the atmosphere is great. The bar area would be fun to hang out at. The food, meh. I was excited about almost everything on the menu but the crispy pork belly was more like ... Crunchy break your teeth belly. The tofu was .... well really mushy and the seasoning with it just made it worse. the soy deviled pickled eggs need some work. The ramen mac & cheese was great and really spicy. And the pulled pork BBQ was wonderful too. All of the specialty drinks are fun. The drink served in a Pineapple is tasty too."}
{"text":"In love with this place! The wings are ridiculously good!!! I think they were double deep fried, and the flavoring was perfect. Similar to bon chon wings, but you get more meat. Also, we ordered a whole tilapia that was marinated in a delicious spicy sauce!! I tried the pork kimchi taco and fish taco, the fish taco was my all time favorite! If it's your first time, go for the wings!!! But honestly, with all that I tried, I don't think you can go wrong with any dish! And the service, amazing staff! Must go if you're an out-of-towner like myself."}
{"text":"Good flavor.  Good service.  Not the cheapest place ever, but the quality is on point."}
{"text":"We are from Tampa Fl where Wings are everywhere! These are the best I have ever had. Some of the largest also..Very good..Even the Ramen Cheese was good"}
{"text":"We love the ambiance here and the food is on point. The karaoke rooms are an added bonus for those nights when you're feeling a bit brave."}
{"text":"We have done trivia here twice and had a blast..but this last time was not great. First, it took our server 1.5 hours to bring out drinks. This is not an exaggeration. Then the speakers kept giving a lot of feedback and was extremely loud. Since the speakers and control panel is locked away we had to wait for our server to come back to help us out. She was friendly, and I think a little overwhelmed, but the service was absolutely awful. After expressing concern that our drinks were taking way too long, the manager did give us that 1.5 hours free for the room and comped some of our drinks. I am not sure if I would return however.

Side note - The menu does have quite a few vegetarian options despite having 'meat' in the name of the restaurant ."}
{"text":"whenever I come to Charlotte and I know I'm meeting up with a big group, Seoul Food Meat Co. is my go to. The portions are generous and if you come during happy hour (4-6 M-Tr I believe) you can get the food and an AMAZING price. 
Since they have this happier hour I try to make a point of only coming here during those times because how can you beat $1 sides!"}
{"text":"Love the place!!! Such a cool environment! Been here several times for food and karaoke! We love the yogurt shoju!!

We have gotten almost everything on the menu and it has all been delicious! The pork belly is divine. 

The place is great for adults but they have a fantastic semi enclosed play yard and dog yard that's nice if you have kids or dogs who like to run around."}
{"text":"One of the best Korean wing spots in Charlotte!  Tacos take traditional korean meats and put a tasty spin on it.  Dirty rice is perfectly seasoned.  Highly recommend Seoul Food Meat Company."}
{"text":"I must say a very disappointing visit here. As a local chef here in the charlotte area I was taken back by the lack of execution in the food. However the one outstanding item were the wings which were crispy spicy and cooked perfect. For meats we had the pork belly which was bland and the skin not crispy next the sausages which was ok at best needs to be grinded finer. The sides were all 1 star for me the pimento cheese corn dish was bland and sweet which i did not care for nor did anyone else at the table. The collards were undercooked and bland as could be. Next was the alleged broccoli salad which was blanched broccoli and chile sauce terrible. Our service was wonderful very atentive always full water glass and never an empty beer. I will not be returning a very disappointing weekend night which are few and far between."}
{"text":"Great place for a casual night!  Their food is pretty good and I love the fact they have the Korean style karaoke private rooms.  This is what Charlotte needed!"}
{"text":"The bao buns are so delicious! Also by far my favorite outdoor space of any bars in charlotte. Tons of games to play and a dog park! The grapefruit beer they make is a must try!"}
{"text":"I love this place!! It has amazing food, amazing atmosphere, and so many activities. I always take my out of town guests here for dinner and then we end up staying all night. Their pulled pork & bao buns are so good, their wings are HUGE, and I dream of their ramen mac-n-cheese. They also have fun karaoke rooms that you can reserve by the hour (it's half price Monday-Thursday) and a great back patio with lots of games. This place is not one to miss!"}
{"text":"This is the only Korean BBQ spot I've been to in Charlotte, but I'm not interested in trying any others-it's that good. Go. Go with your friends. Go with your family, or go have a drink at the bar. This place has trendy style and laid back vibe. The food is delicious and easy to share. If you're new to Korean food, try the wings (any style). You will not regret it."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is nice, the drinks and wings are good.  We live right down the street and have been a good handful of times.  Last night we went and ordered the beef ribs....90% of it was just fat...there was barely any actual meat.  We have ordered this before and not had this problem.  The owner tried to sell us on the idea it is a fatty piece of meat and is normal....there is nothing normal about paying $23 for a rack of ribs that have virtually no meat.  This really soured me on the place."}
{"text":"We had my birthday party here. The service was great and the food was phenomenal! We also rented the large karaoke room for a couple of hours and enjoyed their delicious soju. This is definitely a place locals and visitors should try."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely beautiful! The decor is on point. The bar that opens to the patio is on point. And most importantly, the food is on point. I came here with a few friends a while ago and I've gotta say: i have never been to a restaurant like this before. Southern bbq+Korean twist? Love it.

They have fruit soju in fruits! We tried the pineapple and coconut soju. Coconut was my favorite. It wasn't too sweet and didnt have too strong an alcohol flavor. So delicious!

I think my group got several things:
The fried tilapia. I was not expecting them to bring out a whole fried tilapia. It looked kind of grotesque when i saw it at first, to be honest but my, oh my did it make my taste buds scream for joy. Fried to perfection! The outside is nice and crispy while the inside is moist and delicious. 

The crispy pork belly is also so on point. The skin is suuuper crispy and not at all soggy. It's a little fatty but I like it that way.

Ramen mac and cheese? Can't go wrong with that. It was yummy. 

Don't forget to get the bao buns. They may not seem that appealing cos it's just buns but just you wait until you put some meat up in there. 

Now when all of this comes to you it may not look like a lot of food, but believe me-- it is. The servings are small, but it's enough to fill you up so don't be mistaken. 

Last but not least the service was fantastic! I wish every dining experience that I had went a little something like this. There wasn't once when our water/soda cups were empty. Our server Sarah constantly checked up on us and made sure we were happy. Fast and friendly is all i could ask for and Seoul Food Meat Co gave me that and so much more."}
{"text":"My favorite foods at Seoul Food will have to be the Fire Chicken and the Tofu BBQ wings.  The fire chicken is absolutely mouth-watering, and the tofu is cooked to perfection with excellent bbq sauce.  The bulgogi eggrolls and tacos are also amazing!  I've never had bulgogi before visiting this restaurant, and they made me fall in love with it!"}
{"text":"It's Korean food with a southern twist 

I had the wings which was pretty good. I like the how crispy the skin was. I also had the kimchi taco which was extremely juicy so do be carful because it can get a bit messy . They also had this sweet potato fries kinda thing that was really good actually"}
{"text":"Southern BBQ with an Asian flair. Don't think of this as Korean BBQ, for it is nothing like the grill at your table, type of place. This is truly an American style BBQ joint viewed through the lens of Korean flavors. Their wings are extra crispy without being overly battered and come with just enough flavors of soy to bring out the umami. The BBQ sauce has hints of oyster sauce, and as with many Korean restaurants, kimchi and other pickled vegetables come as accouterments to most dishes. There is a serve yourself bloody mary bar on Sundays with more mixers and pickles. Especially lively when the game is on.  Attentive staff, great happy hour deals, everything I ordered was tasty."}
{"text":"Rad servers and food! Chicken Little was our server and the dude knew the menu well and recommended a few options for us to try out. We had the pork and bulgogi tacos as well as their wings which were massive. Kid you not I could only get through 3 of them. 
Will definitely be back with some friends to try their pineapple soju and other meats. 
Only thing I'd recommend is them potentially offering some blue cheese for the wings!"}
{"text":"We were very excited to try out new Korean restaurant in Charlotte. Went there for lunch and we were very disappointed on their food.  They do not serve authentic Korean food.  The Korean kimchi Sausage was very dry and the chicken wings has too much batter on it."}
{"text":"Great service. Great atmosphere. The wings are some of the best in Charlotte. After hearing numerous reviews of this place, all of which were glowing, we decided to try it. We were not disappointed."}
{"text":"I was skeptical about this place at first (I'm not usually into fusion flavors) but I loved everything I tried: fruit punch beer, wings, pulled pork, and dirty rice. They serve it \"family style\" on a big tray and bring the food out as soon as it's done, regardless of order. The waiter was super helpful and guided us through the menu since it was our first time. They have some cool outdoor space as well, including giant pool and (normal sized) corn hole. Portions are big so keep that in mind when ordering. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Quality of food: 
7.5/10 
We got the wings (half and half), Baked Ram and cheese, and the potato swirl. If you go in on a week day before 5, sides are only ONE DOLLAR. Food was great. We really loved the wings. 

Quality of service: 
5/10
Waitress was very attentive, but too overbearing. She stood ten feet away from our table during our entire meal. 

Wait time:

We didn't have to wait for a single thing 

Atmosphere:

Not making the best use of space
Not really any style continuity"}
{"text":"We ate at Seoul with a few friends that were visiting from out of town. The portions are big and great for sharing with the whole table. As far as meats go, the fire chicken is the best. We also liked the pimiento corn cheese and the kimchi slaw. Great selection of beers and cocktails too."}
{"text":"This was my second time going to Seoul Food Meat Company. I really like this place and to me, they have the best wings I've ever had! They are so crunchy and good. I get the soy garlic and they are not overpowering at all. They are a nice size and you won't be disappointed. 

I also had a brisket bulgogi taco. It was so good and flavorful. The only complaint is that it was kind of oilily. It didn't change the flavor at all, it just made it messy. It also came in a bowl that was too small for the taco so it was spilling on the table. 

For the side, I always get the Ram n Cheese. This side is like eating heaven. Super cheesy and I could probably live in it. I would be okay if it came with a little bit more as it's not a sharable size. But, to be honest, it's so good, I recommend to be selfish with it anyways.  

Last time I was there I had the crispy pork belly and some steamed buns. They were both really good but for the price of the steamed buns, I would get something else. The pork belly is a large portion so share that for sure. 

If I could I would give them a 4.5/5 as I think they are higher than a 4. You won't be disappointed by going but take in mind that during dinner time it can be very crowded and you might have to wait a while. They do have some cool games to play outside by the bar."}
{"text":"We had a good experience,  but there were a couple of things we ordered that just were not that good;  still, worthy of 4 stars overall.  This is not a traditional Korean food restaurant but rather a Korean fusion restaurant. We knew this but just fyi as name alone can mislead. 
It's a family style food joint and small portions are more than enough for 4.  The restaurants interior is rustic looking and pretty cool (5/5). Service was great (5/5) and he helped us with ordering.   We ordered quite a bit: Kim bop with  bulgogi that was a favorite (5/5); kimchee fries were very good (5/5); sirracha crackling were decent (4/5); kimchee pork spare ribs, I was disappointed with these, they looked odd and the flavor just wasn't good (1/5); sweet potato birds nest was thin sliced and deep fried with honey and cinnamon (4/5); kimchee pork tacos (5/5); bulgogi taco (5/5); fried pork belly drew mixed reviews and were so so imo (3/5).  
Next time we'll stick with the bulgogi Kim bop and Kimchee fries and tacos.  
Also owner is opening a traditional Korean food restaurant next door so will try that when it opens."}
{"text":"The sweet potato birds nest side is one of the stupidest inventions I've ever seen.  Impossible to eat."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place out! I would go solely for the \"soccer pool\" outside. They also have a gated dog area, beer pong, large connect four, with an outside bar. The outside is just where it's at. The inside is pretty neat also, with rooms to rent by the hour for a private group karaoke. Neat! There's like 4 rooms to rent out, by size. Smallest $30 hour. Largest $100 hour, but it's a big room! So cool. 

The food: it's a Korean BBQ place. Food options are interesting. We tried: * sweet potato birds nest - its shavings of sweet potato fried with honey & cinnamon. So good! Hard to eat. But yummy! * bao buns - not that good, I saw some reviews on here saying to get those so I ordered them. But don't! Very weird, not like the buns from futa buta if you've had those - they are a gold mine. *kimchi fries - also delish! Reg French fry with kimchi on top (like a red cabbage) just a little like a sauce on top. Interesting and good but hey I love fries  * crispy pork belly - entree, good amount. Meat itself very soft and juicey but also has a hard tough side that is way too crispy in my opinion. 

Drinks: I had the * \"Seoul margarita\" $11 pretty good! I love margs. The rim was interesting, mix of sugar, salt, coffee bean crumbs and ? * \"Seoul fashioned\" $12 my dudes go to drink, he said it was good. Came out looking fancy with a orange slice & cherry. Pretty standard for those. Drinks are kinda pricey. You have choice of which liquor to use, and the price can go up. 

Tip: Monday - Thursday \"happy hour\" with $1 sides. Good deal if you can get there! Otherwise all sides are $4. 

Service: they don't really do reservations unless you have a party of 6+. They do not use the no wait app. I came here early like 5:30 so got a table pretty quick and was waiting on my date. Waitress came right away and gave me the breakdown. Then she kinda disappeared for a while. I eventually had to flag her down after my date showed and we had been waiting like 5 mins. Other than that, the food came out pretty quickly."}
{"text":"If you're looking for unforgettable food go here, I think I found my new favorite wings. Not exactly sure how they get the wings to be crispy crunchy on the outside and not overdone on the inside. Literally some of the best food, you'll ever eat. They have a cool outside patio where they have outdoor games setup which I'm sure is a lot of fun in the summer."}
{"text":"Awesome outdoor area! Great place to drink outside and hang out. The soccer pool and beer pong tables are phenomenal."}
{"text":"Excellent all around experience. To start the drink menu is top notch with a beer selection of local Charlotte, domestic and Asian beer options. As for the food...just wow. The beef rip is enormous and very tender. The hot chicken was awesome with the bao buns. Lastly and the best part of the meal was the wings. We ended up ordering both options and they were equally excellent...maybe the best wings I've ever had. They had a nice almost crunchy texture and were larger than you would normally expect. And the sauces were both very good. 

The service was also great. The waitress and bartender were both very nice and helpful. 

The only compliant I have was the limited menu, from what I hear due to the opening wiped them out. Even with that compliant I would still give this a 5 star. I'm excited to head back soon and try the other food options."}
{"text":"We just loved this place! We got a platter of food because we couldn't decide what to get, and everything was outstanding. We particularly liked the barbecued ribs, which were exquisite. The second best thing we loved was the wings. We ended up ordering way too much food so pace yourselves when ordering. The menu is too extensive to go through here, but I would urge you to try as many things as you can. Don't forget to stop here when you're in Charlotte."}
{"text":"If I was in my 20's again I think I would have liked this place much better. It is trendy and loud but the food was good. I started with the soy garlic chicken wings and they were fantastic. I then went with crispy pork belly rolls and they were also good. They did have some local beers that I enjoyed. The place was packed so you can expect a wait but they did turn them over fairly quickly. Enjoy the videos they play, I'll leave that to your imagination."}
{"text":"Cool place to hang out and have a drink(Keep Pounding). Service was decent!  But wasn't impressed with food, lacked flavor and all the meats wings, spareribs and pork belly all really fatty...  We actually had a couple bites and didn't eat anymore.  Wasted $55 bucks with tip but now we know.  Not our cup of tea!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Great food and great service. I'm from NY and I was visiting friends here in Charlotte. I had a wonderful experience. Definitely a place to visit if your in Charlotte!!!! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time today and had the fries, wings and deviled eggs. Sides are $1 between 430 and 530 Monday through Thursday. Food was good. Will def try to come back for the $1 sides!"}
{"text":"Love the food and the people and the ambiance ...go for the food stay for the drunken karaoke. If you love traditional foods with a twist and creative appetizers to your hearts content this is the place for you. Take your family, buddies and anyone willing to try new foods out and become an American idol."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, nice servers, variety of drinks, and my favorite out of everything, the Bulgogi tacos and the fried pork skin!
Would definitely come back for more."}
{"text":"I visited here to watch some football(Go Dawgs) and check out a new place, and I'm glad I did. The staff was extremely friendly and good to be around. They have an inside bar and a covered outside bar with heaters during the cooler months. They have a very nice dog park and games for adults. There also are several karaoke rooms if thats your thing, which is nice. This is a very fun place to visit, sing your heart out, play some games, and have a few drinks with friends.

Now on to the food. I went with the soy garlic wings, which were amazing. They have a breading on them and were fried perfectly. They don't offer ranch or blu cheese, but you won't need it. The flavor was great and the wings were large. Definitely some of the better wings I've had in Charlotte. 

Parking is street parking, so I'm not sure how busy this gets during peak. It is also a few streets over from the train which is nice. I'll definitely be visiting again."}
{"text":"Meats meats meats! Our love affair with Seoul started as a spark and his grown into a fully blown conflagration. We come here at least once every two weeks.

What to order? You've gotta get the chicken wings and the fried tofu--no vegans here, but the tofu is seriously as good as the wings. Also, get the beef ribs. 

The sriracha cracklins and potato swirl are our favorite side items. If you wanna feel healthy with all your meat, get the tomatoes, too. They are marinated in soy sauce and are a nice light complement to the meats. 

To drink: the coconut soju is the best. And the date tea, if you are keeping it nonalcoholic!

{"text":"A Unique Menu and a Great Atmosphere!

I am giving this place 3 starts because I did not like their take on traditional chicken wings.  They attempted to do an Asian style breading, on a bone-in chicken wing.  The breading was heavy and thick, and I was never confident whether I was biting into breading, chicken, or bone, until I had committed to the bite.  It's a strange way to eat chicken wings.

Aside from that, the atmosphere is great.  They have a nice patio with a view of uptown.

I really want to go back and try something else.  It is so promising, with this unique menu, that I must give it another shot. I will try the BBQ next time, and we will see."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere, trendy decor, great menu. I wish out server had mentioned that the portions are GENEROUS. Our group ordered way to much food. Typically when I see small plate share-ables around $4-$7 I think, \"you're going to need to pile up\". Not the case! 1 taco would have been enough protein for me. The Pork Rinds were the BEST I've ever had. Perfect flavor and so filling. The Pork Belly was also incredible. Crispy and flavorful. The large portion can feed 3-4 people easily. The Sweet Potato Birds Nest is incredibly difficult to eat (spiky little shredded strands of sweet potato crisped into a nest shape), but was delicious. 

I will say that all of the food is served on trays or cardboard boats. Not a spot I'd bring Mom, but an awesome place for friends!

We were in a Karaoke private room for the evening celebrating a birthday. They were super cool with letting us bring in our own birthday cake. Our server was hard to get the first 2 hours (drinks got low and empty!), but he kept apologizing and definitely made sure to take care of our bills promptly. (He also reminded is that gratuity was included, which was really classy.)

Overall this was a hit! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Only come here if you need a drink on a cool day while sitting outside enjoying the okay view of downtown. I had the sausage (so bland, will never order it again), pork belly (omggg so much fat! If you want to GAIN weight & nasty fat then I highly recommend this), sweet potatoes bird nest (too sweet, sweet potatoes are naturally sweet but I guess it's not sweet enough for them, so they add sugar ontop), side of rice (okay rice) & wings; probably the only thing I would eat if I came back to this place."}
{"text":"If you want to try something different and really good, then please go by this place to eat. My wife and I decided to give try it because where we were going to eat was closing soon. We had the great pleasure of having Ms Jordyn as our waitress. She was nothing short of phenomenal, she really took good care of us. We had no idea of what we wanted, so she suggested a few items without overwhelming us. \"DARN GOOD CHOICE\" the food really didn't take long, but now we are FULL & TOTALLY SATISFIED !!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Very cool restaurant! Very good wings. We had an awesome server and everyone there was so nice to my 3 year old son. They made him special ramen so he didn't have to eat anything spicy. We all loved the wings as well."}
{"text":"So looks like most of the reviews are either hot or cold. This is my first time here and maybe I just came with the right people. 

The wings were the best part - double fried Korean Style - the coatings were unreal and so crispy - the Soy Garlic and Spicy both kick butt - try them both! The Cracklins were good covered with the Sriracha/spice powder - the portion was huge and is plenty to share - they almost seem to magically refill themselves!! The last best thing was the fried tofu - nice firm texture and lots of flavor. The potato salad and the Ramen Mac and Cheese were nothing to write home about.

If you are a drinker - go all out and get the Coconut Soju - dude (or dudette) it's just not a party without that Soju - it will sneak up on you and kick your a$$. Warning - do not try to eat the coconut - not that I'd know anything about that (ahem).

I would definitely come back for the wings!"}
{"text":"Not bad at all. Seems like a fun place out back also. Worth a trip. Food was above average which is a thumbs up. Carefully with the pork belly good ....but full of fat."}
{"text":"Southern style meets Asian fusion! This place is phenomenal. They have an \"adult\" beer games set up for beer pong outside, perfect for the fall weather. The inside decor was also cool with the bar on the left as you walk in and tables to the right with a V.I.P. room in the corner. The manager was nice enough to provide us the room with our party because we had two little ones with us. The menu was pretty simple and meant to be shared. A few of my favorites that we ordered were the kimchi fries, crispy pork belly (it's the Filipino in me....reminded me so much of lechon), and the sweet potato birds nest which was crispy with the hint of honey! I highly recommend this place to anyone visiting Uptown Charlotte. The parking was tough, there were limited spots on the side but we managed. It was the first day of College Football that's why it was packed otherwise I'm sure it's not too bad any other day. I can't wait to be back here the next time I visit!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love Seoul. We highly recommend if you're looking for a guilty pleasure stop, with their *amazing* wings and ramen Mac and cheese. We also think Chertiam makes the bar the optimal place to sit! Don't wait. Go now and thank me later"}
{"text":"Such great food and atmosphere knew something had to be wrong, because it wasn't packed! Once I received my tab I found out the answer, the management. Had a billing issue with drinks and tried to solve it with the manager but she insisted her bartenders were never wrong and wouldn't check the cameras. Turned a $5 dollar matter into a loss of 4 customers."}
{"text":"Food 8/10

{"text":"This place is great! It has some unique entree options and hands down the best wings in CLT."}
{"text":"One of the best and most unique places in Charlotte. The wings are amazing and all of the sides are delicious. I always try different sides each time and am never disappointed."}
{"text":"LOVE the wings! I actually crave it some days...it's a nice location and outdoor seating is available too."}
{"text":"Love their back patio for hanging out and day drinking with friends. They have good beer selection and fun games. The soy garlic wings are the best wings around and I've had friends that love the tacos."}
{"text":"THEY'RE WINGS ARE TO DIE FOR! Some of the best chicken wings I've had in my life. Order them. Your welcome. 

I also ordered some ribs and they were super tender and tasty. 

Get they're loaded fries too! Super tasty. Atmosphere is really cool. Service there was good and employees were super helpful with choosing what to get. Definitely recommend Seoul! I'm new to Charlotte, this is one of the best spots I ate at so far!"}
{"text":"Amazing! My husband and I love to go try the different Charlotte restaurants. I've been wanting to try Seoul for a while now but heard bad things from their opening. Seoul had some big shoes to fill and they did. Our server Tony was incredible and answered so many of our questions and had great suggestions. We ordered the beef rib, bao buns, spicy BBQ wings & the cracklins. Everything was perfect. My husband has been raving about the beef rib to everyone. The atmosphere is perfect as well. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Unique food served on a shareable large tray. Very different and in a good way. Friendly staff. Sweet potatoes bird nest is cool as well as the \"not sushi\" items. Someone ordered a whole dish that was served upright with seasoning on top. Not for me but interesting. The brisket was tasty. All was good. However, the pork belly is just that not just a catchy name for a food item. Mostly fat that we did not like. Easy to over order quantity. Oh and good music with a younger flare to it. I would have rated a 5 for scepter for the pork belly. But I should have known being what it is. The only gluten free meat item is the pork belly. Definitely a unique experience that is a must try!"}
{"text":"Holy Moly this place is amazing. Let me start by saying I'm a picky eater so Korean BBQ would not be my first choice for a nice dinner. Boy, was I wrong. This was delicious. Everyone at our table was in heaven while eating. We ordered basically everything on the menu since we were a large group and everything was amazing. Cool atmosphere. Writing this review is making my mouth water. I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Great wings but the rest is a bit bland. I suppose i'm expecting more of a korean kick and punch of flavors rather than the typical american BBQ."}
{"text":"First things, first this place is the most authentic, best food I have had in Charlotte. If it wasn't against my moral compass, I would get a tattoo of \"Seoul Food Meat Co.\" on my chest, slightly below my heart. Now that I got that out of the way, Seoul Food Meat Co. is not your typical Korean restaurant - it is much, much more! It is a hybrid of southern BBQ with a Korean twang and the flavors are amazing. I had the wings and they are nothing short of incredible. They were literally straight fire. Seriously if you aren't into spicy foods, I recommend you proceed with caution. I chose the \"soy garlic\" flavor - I would bet that Colonel Sanders would even say they are finger-lickin' good!

The sides I chose were potato swirl and ramen mac & cheese. The potato swirl seasoning had a ton of flavor. The ramen mac & cheese was cheesier than a dad joke and the ramen base made me question why I hadn't thought of it before. The atmosphere felt modern, lively, and open but not crowded. The beer selection is interesting and I must confess that, even though I am a male, I indulged in the pineapple beer, which was surprisingly delicious!

Service is a big deal to me, but since it was so great, I don't know how it could be any better. Perhaps mind reading? In summary, I will be back.  If anyone from Seoul Food Meat Co. is reading this, you can be sure I will be an honorary ambassador for eternity.  I wish you the best and thank you for feeding my Seoul!"}
{"text":"I really love the kimchi Mac and cheese. It was different but amazingly good. I also loved my spicy wings. The staff were friendly and attentive and I enjoyed the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great food, service, and atmosphere!! Play area outside for cornhole. They even have a small area for dogs! Highly suggest checking it out."}
{"text":"Oh good lord, the beef brisket taco is what dreams are made of. We also had two varieties of Kim bap,  potato spiral, tomato salad and cracklin (a first for this yankee.) Everything was good, but seriously, get the beef brisket taco. Our server Abstract was super patient with us, since this was our first time, and did an excellent job of making recommendations and checking on us. It was busy, with people waiting to be seated, but we didn't ever feel rushed. The Korean pop music in the background was a bit loud, but not awful. An interesting drink and bar list round out what was a really great dining experience."}
{"text":"Quality spot to eat or drink. Have to say they may have the best wings in CLT if big CRISPY wings are your thing. Bartenders are on point and I like that they don't skim on the drink garnishes (it's the small things right?)."}
{"text":"This place was OK! It's super casual and seems to have a great beer selection, service is speedy and friendly, and the concept is interesting. Pluses: most of the food we ordered was tasty. I have a thing for Korean kochujang sauce and really liked both the spicy BBQ wings and the fire chicken, and the pimento corn cheese (served with those puffy shrimp crackers) was outrageously good. The small order of fire chicken was enormous and I highly recommend. 

Minuses: it's loud in there, and our spendy cocktail was so stingy it seemed like they had made one and then split it into two glasses (we had to go for a backup cocktail at Davidson St. Public House afterwards to make it up to ourselves). The sweet potato birds nest did not sit right as an appetizer, it was way too sweet. But I figure those are just the breaks of finding your way around a menu at a new place. Would eat again!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Unfortunately I don't come to eat. I come to black out. Pineapple soju and Sapporo all around! 

If you do eat, grab the soy garlic wings. The hot have too much sauce and take away some of the crispness! Potato swirls and Kim bap are also on point!

Expect a little waiting if you are trying to order drinks from the bar at the back deck when it's busy though"}
{"text":"One of my fav Charlotte restaurants! THE BEST chicken wings i have ever had in my life, doesn't even need dipping sauce! I also loved the ramen mac and cheese! Also have awesome drinks and a cool outdoor space for when there is nice weather. A great south end gem."}
{"text":"So there was 8 of us total which was a perfect amount of people to go to this restraint because they serve family style food here. We got the fire chicken which was delicious, the pork and the wings. The wings were so delcious!! The only thing about the wings is they say they are spicy but they were not that spicy and even their hot spicy sauce wasn't too spicy to me. The sweet potato nest was really good too, I think ours was a tiny overcooked but they were still good. So besides the food this place has a really awesome back patio. They have soccer pool, a dog park area and beer pong. It was a lot of fun to hang out after we ate.  Cool place to hang out"}
{"text":"Don't get it twisted! The seoul food here is down home good too! Especially if you're into pork belly its amazing. I personally had the soy garlic wings and the kimshi taco, and the Brisket taco. The kimshi taco had a little kick to it and was very good. Don't get discouraged by the size of the taco because its packed with flavor, the Brisket taco was good as well. Lastly the wings we're fresh crunchy and full of that fusion garlic/soy flare very good! All in All i'll be back! I saw some other items I want to try!"}
{"text":"My friend and I ate here last week and both got severe food poisoning that lasted for three days. The food tasted great but I won't be eating here again."}
{"text":"This restaurant really let me down. As far as the Korean fried chicken, it was probably the worst thing that I had there. With BonChon chicken now open I'd imagine they will have to step their game up. The pork belly was also very tough and extremely salty."}
{"text":"Great location with fun outdoor patio...but don't go for the food. Lots of fun elements as a bar. Dog area, karaoke rooms, good service, bar games. A good place to hang out but the food was lacking."}
{"text":"Fabulous lunch setting! The food is wonderful - easily the best chicken wings in Charlotte.  Great beer selection too!"}
{"text":"First things first; what a beautiful space. I fell in love with the vibe of Seoul Food from the moment I walked in. Before we had even been seated, I was planning to bring friends and family from all over to this spot just because of the atmosphere.

I went for a Thursday lunch with my man. We were seated quickly after choosing to stay inside rather than outside; it was a particularly windy afternoon. We were seated right next to an open window. Normally I'd be happy with the combination of indoor and outdoor seating, but the leaves blowing in the window and into my face ruined some of the whimsy.

Our server arrived shortly, introduced himself, and walked us through the menu. Everything was pretty self-explanatory. We placed our order -- pork belly and sausage with a potato spiral and sriracha cracklins -- and excitedly waited for it to arrive.

I really like that they serve you on a tray for easy sharing. Everything we ordered was tasty, but for me, the cracklins stood head and shoulders above everything else. They were still actively crackling and popping when they arrived at our table. The flavor was delightful and they had just the right amount of crunch. As for the rest of our items, I enjoyed the potato spiral but found the accompanying sauce to be rather unfortunate. The flavor was unbalanced, too spicy, and it didn't complement the potato very well. The pork belly was nice, but arrived with no seasoning, and its sauce was also lacking for me. For $25 for the meat alone, I didn't feel as though we got our money's worth.

Once we'd finished, my date ordered the green tea biscuits for a light dessert. By this time, the restaurant had cleared out and we were the only ones left. Somehow, it took 20 minutes for dessert to arrive at the table. I can't imagine a scenario where that's acceptable. Once our server finally brought them out, there was no mention or explanation for the wait.

My biggest gripe is that there are very few gluten free options at Seoul Food. I enjoyed what I had, but with so few things to choose from, I imagine I'll end up ordering the exact same thing on every repeat visit -- and that's no fun. Seoul Food: if you're listening, expand your GF offering. We're a loyal people and we'd like to eat as well as everyone else."}
{"text":"Beef Ribs, kimchi pork ribs, spring rolls, sriracha cracklin, and pickled radishes and watemelon lemonade are soooooooo good!!!!!"}
{"text":"Short version:  Great food, ok service, take a large group and try everything.

Long version: Service was nice and friendly but understaffed so you may need to ask a couple times to get things.  Despite this the food came out fast and was great.  The food is served family style so I would suggest going with a large group so you can trying more of their dishes.  We got the beef rib, both kinds of chicken wings, pork belly, tilapia, mac n cheese ramen and potato crisps.

The beef rib was good, I would recommend eating it with the sauce they serve with it.  It gives the meat a lot of flavor and makes everything moist.  I suggest eating it on their buns, making you own slider.   The chicken wings were very crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside but a little greasy with the rice oil they use to cook them in.  While I didn't like the pork belly too much my family all enjoyed the crunchiness of the pork belly and the dipping sauce they provide.  The  tilapia was my favorite dish, the sauce they put on it is amazing.  As for the sides the mac n cheese ramen is great if you are looking for comfort food but potato crisps have great flavor and I would highly recommend them as well."}
{"text":"Seoul takes Korean food and caters it to the community it is located in. If you're going there for authentic Korean food you will be disappointed. However their food is just as amazing. We tried the pork belly, kim chi coleslaw, rice and tofu soup. Delish!

We also ordered blueberry beer but when asked what kind of beer they used the server had no idea. We did not like that response and wondering what type of beer we were drinking. 

The atmosphere is lovely with exposed brick walls and warm lighting. We also liked how they played Korean Pop music on TV which you don't see very often. lol

We would definitely come back and just a heads up you don't need the large size for two people. A small order is more than enough meat for 2. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place is not my go to place. I'm only giving a three star because the service itself deserve 5 stars but the food only deserve 2. Everything was out.  We ordered almost everything on the menu... Not satisfied only with the service!"}
{"text":"I'm one to never give a bad review. Maybe this style food isn't for me but that aside I ordered pork there was fat on every bite and on the top of each piece was a very hard layer that wasn't eatable in my dtand"}
{"text":"How much salt can one person ingest in a single sitting and still live? EAT HERE and find out! I highly suggest that you avoid this place if you have a history of high blood pressure, diabetes, dry eyes, dry mouth or if you're a super taster! I have never had so much salt in my life! 
The problem with the menu here is that there is no balance whatsoever. Everything you order is a super flavor salt bomb and you find yourself with nothing to tame it or balance it. You will drink a TON of water, so get ready. I suggest you order a plain white rice upfront to eat with any of the other dishes to try to balance out the flavors in your mouth. This place is really doing way too much. I would not recommend to anyone. 

We ordered soy ginger wings, brisket tacos, kimchi fries, soy pickled deviled eggs, spring rolls and green tea ice cream. The ONLY thing I would recommend is the green tea ice cream with sugar biscuits. 

I would never return to this place."}
{"text":"A co-worker recommended this place and we loved it. Sat outside on the patio and luckily the night was beautiful weather.  We tried many items on the menu and nothing disappointed. The wings and fried pork belly were exceptionally good. 

The only down side is that the drinks are quite pricey - $9 for a small drink (which equals one shot). We paid more for our drinks than we did for the food."}
{"text":"Food is fantastic and very well priced for the extra large portions. Fun place to hang out in the yard with a beer or grab a delicious meal."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. A unique experience with a fusion of Korean BBQ and southern soul food, I have yet to find something on that menu that was not delicious. The wings are probably the best I have ever had, the ramen'cheese is great.
They have a nice large outdoor area complete with a great play place for furry four legged friends and some games. If its all too crowded, they deliver short range (like to nearby breweries!)
Highly recommend Seoul Food Meat Company!"}
{"text":"Eh. Mediocre. The best part was the pork belly. Part of the problem was the staff. There wasn't many. So if you're looking for a job, that's something they definitely can benefit from. Granted they just opened not long ago, I didn't want to be too cruel, however, I could use a drink and a knife with my food. 

Drinks - got lychee martini: 1) they didn't have martini glass avail  (ok I didn't mind, just pour one in), 2) took a while for a refill 3) too sweet for my taste 

Food - we ordered pork belly (REAL GOOD), kimchi sausage (eh, ok I suppose), noodle Mac and cheese (reminded me of canned cheese), dirty brown rice (seasoning on point! Ask for more on a side!), deviled picked eggs (not enough marinate for me - personally). 

Would I give it another shot? May be for a beer outdoors. 

P.s. We asked if they can put the game on, we walked out with an epic review of Korean videos!"}
{"text":"As a vegetarian (mostly), I had worried for a long time about coming here and having nothing to eat, but a closer look at the menu proved otherwise! 

My fiancé and I ordered the Fire Tuna Kim Bap (similar to sushi, but no raw fish), the broccoli salad (with a siracha-sesame drizzle), the potato swirl, and the soy garlic tofu. The sauce on the tofu was SO GOOD!

There was also plenty of other stuff I'd be willing to try, especially if you catch me on a meat-eating day!"}
{"text":"Some great food. Interesting vibe. Great service.  Not so much family friendly. A little pricey.

Ok here's what I liked. The crispy pork belly! Omg so good. I do however wish they had additional sauces that weren't spicy. But the pork was amazing and the sauce it did come with was tasty, just a tad on the spicy side. The  sweet potato bird's nest was tasty! My husband enjoyed the loaded mashed potato salad. I can appreciate it's uniqueness but it wasn't my fave. Mostly because I don't care for cucumbers and it has their house pickled cucumbers in it and they were bigger chunks and I didn't care for the texture. But I wouldn't say it was bad.

As far as family friendly. Well not with smaller kids or picky kids. There is not a lot of selection of non spicy items. All the items are unique, which we enjoy trying new things but our 5yo was not so interested. Also, the TV's are playing some Asian pop music videos but they are pretty risque. So not so appropriate for a little one. I kept trying to avert his attention. That being said I would maybe come back I just wouldn't bring little ones. 

What I really didn't like... The ramen and cheese. Yuck gag. It was horrible. Sorry, but I really hated it. Even the 5yo who loves Mac and cheese and any kind of noodles wasn't interested. Also, it was a little on the pricey side in general. ..

I would still recommend the place with no kids and no ramen."}
{"text":"YUMMY & FAST! I ordered take out & walked over in exactly 9 min from my apartment & the hostess was just finishing closing my TO go bag, talk about  fast service. The wings were out of this world, huge, I don't even know what they gave in the side (not ranch) but whatever it was I ate it all! I got 1/2 hot 1/2 soy. When I get the wings again I'll prob go all soy. The fire chicken YUMMY, & the next day leftovers were just as good! So glad I finally tried this place! I'll prob eat here weekly now."}
{"text":"The food here is incredibly delicious. The wings were huge, crispy, moist with two amazing sauces. By far these are the best wings I've ever had. We will definitely return soon!"}
{"text":"This place is such a unique little slice of heaven and the food is one of a kind good! It really is Korean soul food! Bear in mind that everything is 'a la carte' but to me, that's a good thing because I'm one of those people that often doesn't want a side and then wastes a boatload of fries that comes with my meal, or wants all the sides and gets some major upcharges. Rather than substituting or wasting food- you order exactly what you want and it's the perfect portion. Not to mention the food is delicious! I recommend the wings, as they are HUGE, crispy, and have the perfect flavor. If we're being really real though, my favorite thing on the entire menu is the spiraled potatoes. They somehow cut a potato into one big spiral, put it on a stick with some kind of heavenly seasons and then deep fry it and it is honestly the best a potato you could possibly get. If you go (which you should), definitely try the potatoes! This place will not disappoint!"}
{"text":"This place was incredible! I'm so glad to have something like this in Charlotte--it's bringing ethnicity, diversity, and fun to the city. 

We ordered pork belly (with buns), kimbap (korean sushi), both types of wings, and the ram 'n mac (mac and cheese made with ramen noodles). 

The wings were beautifully seasoned, and the spicy wings have a kim-chi-like sauce on them. They are mildly spicy. We really enjoyed the kim bap quite a bit--it was a new item on the menu, but there were several meat filing options to choose from. All very flavorful and tasty. The pork belly was EXTRA crispy. This was my only complaint because it was hard to taste the meaty part of it. Ram 'n mac was a fun, quirky twist on mac and cheese. There were pork rinds on top to make for some good texture. 

The atmosphere of Seoul Food is casual, but fun. Food is served on trays and in cardboard servers. Everything is messy in the best way. Price-wise, my husband and I were able to eat for $22 total and we had PLENTY of food. 

We also had a chance to speak to the owner, who showed us around the restaurant and all of the new karaoke rooms they have! They are beautifully themed/decorated. Their outdoor space is spacious, you can bring your dog, and they have jumbo-sized pool/billiards that you play with soccer balls! The owner told us that eventually they will be making an all-you-can-eat Korean BBQ section. 

We had a great time and look forward to going back. Such a great fusion of authentic Korean food and southern flavors."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere and the food is great. The wings are perfectly crisp on the outside and juicy on the inside. Kimchi fries are delicious. The patio has games and a space for dogs."}
{"text":"We were in town for work and came here on a recommendation....wings were excellent, but beware of the large portion, it's a lot!

Porkbelly was also a favorite!"}
{"text":"Wings! Wings! Wings! Get the half/half chicken wings. Definately a top 5 wing experience. Everything else (fire chicken and pulled pork) was ok, perhaps because they were overshadowed by the wings. 

Great selection of Japanese beer also. Perfect accompaniment to the...  Wait for it....  WING"}
{"text":"Definitely more for my boyfriend than me, but if you look at the menu and think it sounds good, it tastes as good as it sounds. It's also fun spot for drinking and has a nice patio"}
{"text":"This is a must to visit! Korean Seoul food at its best!

We tried this place since they won the Charlotte wing fest and our son said they were the bomb! 

We ordered half and half which is half spicy  BBQ and soy garlic! Both were sauced well but still crunchy and nice size not skimpy! We also tried the soy pickled deviled eggs - DELISH AND DIFFERENT from my traditional southern style and the potato swirl nothing fancy bout it but really tasty as far as tators go. Lol  they serve the wings with pickled radish which was unexpectedly good since I thought I didn't like radish but pickled is the way to go with that! 

The real star  of the show was the FAT BRISKET BULGOGI TACO  talk about flavor - thin sliced marinated beef, some kind of slaw and pickled cukes IT WAS THE BOMB DOT COM lol you must try one - I was also pleased at the size of it since they're $4 each  but worth it for sure! 

Bottom line - as their motto says FEED YOUR SEOUL!"}
{"text":"We got a watermelon soju to start off...awesome! It was so smooth, refreshing, and slightly bubbly. 
We got the fire chicken(flavorful and so juicy!), spicy ramen n cheese(OMG so delicious and creamy), BBQ wings(which had the crispest yummiest skin!), greens(salty like soy sauce and just so good), and some bao buns to stuff all of our meat into! 
We cannot wait to go again! Service was exceptional! We have to go back and try the green tea sugar biscuits as they were out it this time. This place is definitely a diamond!! Also, atmosphere is great. They play K-Pop and other Korean genres of music on the TVs and it just added to the amazing experience!"}
{"text":"I just love the Soy garlic chicken it has a nice balance of savory and sweet. The service great always greeted with a smile"}
{"text":"I did not want to go here; because, it's Non traditional Korean food. It's not traditional Korean food; but, it's the best of Korean Bar food! 

We went with the kiddo to meet the family.  The hostess took our name down and when asked how long is the wait; her response was all the tables are full and when they get up, I will let you know when it's your turn. Honest answer for a bar serving bar food on a Friday night! Bad place for a Mommy and Daddy with two sleepy kids at 6:00 at night. But my single brother picked! Go figure!!! 

We waited 30 minutes and them started to explore the building. The bar was nice but people continued to walk down a back hallway with bottles of liquor. Our adventures payed off and we found an outside bar with a super mega tent over the whole back deck and a mega GAME area!!!  
Flip cup or beer pong for the young; but, husband and the kiddo found pool soccer??!!! Awesome fun! 
It's now my husband new favorite game!  But wait... we got a table .  In a private room? 

Because it's also a norebang! (No-day-bong) private room with two mics, two tambourines, 1000 plus songs, korean Kpop dancers, and a karaoke machine!!!  Written in Korean! What!  The waitress was kind and let us know how the machine worked with putting songs in a cube and skipping songs. So we finally ordered food. 

Then the meats came:
Beef ribs- fall off the bone awesome meat! 

Crispy pork belly- omg loved it  

Fried whole Tilapia- my absolute favorite. It's great you get the head and tail too!  100% band for your buck. 

Half and half wings - okay not as good as smoked wings. Taste the same warm or cold. Either way good with a cold beer. (Hint good bar food) 

White rice    WAY OVER PRICED! Really it's just white rice! $4 a bowl which would buy you a giant 10lb bag of rice! 

Soy pickled Deviled Eggs - yummy 

Kimchi Vinegar Slaw- had a lot left over. 

Full rack of ribs- huge! Fall off the bone! Everyone devoured this bad boy!  

I think the manager stated 1/2 price norebang during the Sunday- Wednesday. My oldest asked to have her birthday party here! Lol"}
{"text":"Great watermelon ale! They add a splash of fresh watermelon juice!!! Had a few tacos and the KF wings. Tacos were great. Wings were amazing! Salad was just a salad and the Ramen and cheese was different but pretty good. Pulled pork was moist and delish!! Hope to be back soon!"}
{"text":"Really fun place to hang out for all different kinds of fun! Their small plate dishes are great for trying everything and sharing with a group of friends. I came here for a small engagement celebration and had a great server for the 13 of us, which I know is a lot! The food came out fast, hot and delicious. Then we made sure to hit up one of the many karaoke booths! How cool is that? Also have a nice bar patio. On a sat my friends and I came to share watermelons, coconuts, etc filled with alcohol. I recommend stopping by here if you ever haven't!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try Seoul Food Meat Company, however the experience wasn't amazing.  Service was incredibly slow, to the point we got our beverages after some of our food arrived and we were never offered a second round.  

Now to the food.  The kimbap and the spring rolls were awesome, the fire chicken was tender and juicy, the pimento cheese was a little bland, and the bao buns were literally just buns.

I would recommend asking a lot of questions about what you are getting because he menu has no descriptions.  Overall it was decent and I would probably go back, hopefully next time I get a server that actually pays attention to our table."}
{"text":"The soy garlic wings are my guilty pleasure. So crispy and full of flavor. Laid back atmosphere and some of the best service I've ever had in my life."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Tried 5 different meats and they were all delicious but I think my favorite was the pork belly. It was melt in your mouth but then the skin was crispy and crunchy like a fresh made pork rind. Def going back here. Perfect atmosphere and great good. Perfectly befitting of a South End eatery."}
{"text":"One of my new favorite spots in Charlotte! Great atmosphere, great food and great staff. We ordered the soy garlic wings, pimento corn, pulled pork, kimchi slaw and dirty rice, and I loved everything. Since they recently opened, they were out of several sides and are still figuring out how much food to keep in stock. I will be returning shortly to try some of the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"If I could give this spot 10 stars I would. I had soy garlic wings, a potato swirl, white rice w/ sauce on side (I will get it mixed in next time), and crispy pork belly. The way they make the wings extra crispy yet not overcooked on the inside hit the spot as I'm a wing enthusiast. The potato swirl was seasoned so well and the dipping sauce gave it the right amount of kick. It was like peeling off a potato chip. The sauce they use for the rice is very good. Not a strong flavor but it makes it better than regular rice. The crispy pork belly was on point. The dipping sauce is perfect for this meat and goes well with the dirty rice. I came during happy hour so my sides were cheap. I wouldn't mind paying the full price. A big portion of everything I had. I was stuffed yet still had some pork belly left. It was so good I pushed myself to finish it. If you're in Charlotte this is definitely the spot to hit. Only about 15-20 minutes from the airport."}
{"text":"Nice hangout spot downtown with decent drinks. The food was JUST OKAY. Ordered beef rib, pork belly, broccoli salad, and spiral potato thing.  

Rib portion was tender and seasoned well but very fatty cut. Pork belly was basically like eating soft fatty with crunchy outside pork rindsone bite I could feel the grease going down my throat. (Much better versions at Soul Gastrolounge and Block & Grinder) Broccoli salad... steamed,cold, with Aisan sauce drizzled on top, yep that's it 
The best thing was the spiral fried potato with dipping sauce. It had a kick to it. Hubby ordered pineapple beer to drink, it was tasty. I had rum punch which was okay."}
{"text":"Love their soy wings even better love having them as a business neighbor so I can schedule late meetings with clients! ;)"}
{"text":"We took our friend, a student from South Korea, here tonight. We all loved it. She said her favorite item was the soy garlic wings, and we also enjoyed the pork belly, potato swirl, soy deviled eggs, and ramen Mac n cheese. I was impressed by the amount of meat they give you. If I had to do it over, I would've ordered one meat for the 3 of us and tried more sides. As it was, we took home leftovers. 

Our waiter was great, and the ambience was nice too. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"I am a fan of barbeque and I am a fan of korean food. This is an acceptable fusion of the two. The kimchi ribs were cooked and flavored well.  The wings are good but the soy garlic flavor wasn't as good for me. In my opinion the tacos are about a dollar overpriced for what you're getting but the braised beef had a great taste.

The staff seemed upbeat and super friendly and the atmosphere is obviously modern and casual. I am not from Charlotte so the location to me seemed sketchy and parking was a hassle.

Some issues for me were that the white radishes that came with the wings were tasteless and the ribs had only one minuscule side of pickled cucumber.  Also, seating is a bit small.

Other than that, this is a good place to get some fusion food and definitely a place I'll go to again."}
{"text":"First time here we had a blast! Second time, not so much. We called when they opened to place a pick-up an order. After waiting 45min for food that they said would only take 15min, they offered us the food for free since their card reader repeatedly would not work. They then decided to make us wait longer while they \"fixed\" the problem and then went back on their offer, and charged us full price. As someone who works in this industry and puts service first, its sad to see such a young business make such a horrible decision so early. Never going back!"}
{"text":"This is a nice, trendy place that offers a unique food experience and some good drink selections too.  Everyone raves about the wings, which I like but not as much as most.  There is a beef rib that is a little pricey but very much worth this.  I is a single rib that looks like the rib on the beginning of the Flinstones that tips Fred's car over.  THis slab of meat has been marinated for days and cooked slow and low for about I think about eight hours.  Tender and juicy and like nothing I've ever had."}
{"text":"If you want 23 lbs of meat for one or two, great.  The sides are bad.  Ramen Mac and cheese tasted like prison food and the collards were greasy and as a southerner, the worst I've ever had.  Service is ok, but food needs a big revamp!"}
{"text":"Wow! Amazing food , atmosphere and staff. The wings are to die for. The service is quick and prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"Amazing sides - a little bit of a wait. We sat at the bar on a Friday just to be able to order faster. Sides can add up. We got 2 sides - Sweet potato bird nest & ram Mac & cheese. Both delicious! Then we shared a couple of tacos and a kim pap (not sushi) 
Overall great food will be back but be prepared to spend 50+ with sides and drinks. As everything is ala carte"}
{"text":"First time here and I'll definitely be back. 
Service: Our server was great.  He said sometimes people over order so he made sure we ordered just enough food for two hungry girls. What he suggested was perfect. He was also funny and friendly. 
Food:  We ordered the small kim chi spareribs -really good; small crispy pork belly- crispy chunks of pork perfection; potato swirl- Yum!, how can you go wrong with fried potatoes; and Ramen mac and cheese- ummm I would pass on this next time,  not a lot of flavor,  but an interesting spin on mac and cheese.  

All in all I'm glad we tried it and we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"If you want awesome Korean food with an American flare, great drinks, and great service...Then Seoul Food Meat Company is where you wanna be. We walked in on a bright Sunday afternoon and was promptly greeted and seated. Our server Francis, came right over and introduced himself and took our drink order. I had the Panther drink which is a fruity refreshing drink. We also had strawberry Soju which was also refreshing with a bit of a kick. I had the Crispy Pork Belly, Green Tea Cornbread, and the Pimento Cheese Corn to eat. And EVERY bite I put into my mouth was pleasurable! The pork belly was so tender and yet the skini was crispy. I ordered a small, but the serving wasn't small at all. The cornbread was moist yet firm like a muffin. Exactly how I like my cornbread to taste. And the Pimento Cheese Corn was so good that you almost couldn't stop eating it along with the shrimp chips that came with it! The wife and kid shared wings as well which were amazing. Crunchy, slightly sweet outside. Tender meaty inside. What more could you ask for! They have a large back patio area with games for those who like to hang out, have a drink and good food while socializing."}
{"text":"Best thing on the menu, beef rib. Wings are also delicious and the staff is SO nice! They have a dog park attached to the restaurant that gets pretty busy. My girlfriend and I take our dog a couple of times a week to tire him out. Overall, great place!"}
{"text":"It's been four years since I've been back in North Carolina and it's good to be back. Hit up Seoul Food Meat Company on a Sunday with a friend for a late dinner. The place was pretty packed, both inside and outside, with beerpong raging on the patio. That's a winner in my book. After we were seated, we started off with some Korean Donkeys (Moscow Mules). Service was really slow. After bringing us waters, our waitress never came back. We're talking 10 minutes plus. We ended up tracking down another waitress who became our new waitress. That's a star off for that. Our new waitress did her best to make up for it by being friendly.

The food, however, was incredible. They are served tapas style and we had quite the feast. Soy garlic wings (5/5): Korean Fried Chicken done right. Perfectly crisp and flavorful in a tasty sauce. Fatty brisket beef bulgogi taco (4/5): loved the flavor fo the bulgogi and the aioli but it's made to order so you can't change your order. I wanted to take off the cabbage slaw but had to resort to scraping it off myself. Come on, y'all. Pimeno cheese corn (3.5/5): the creativity is what makes this a cool dish. Take pimento cheese, use it as a base for a corn dip, and add shrimp chips that serve as scoopers. I've never seen anything like it. Potato wheel (3/5): I've had this dish in Shanghai so was pumped to have it again. It was better in Shanghai, though. Take a long stick, add circular fried potatoes to it, add some seasoning, and a dipping sauce. I just wasn't a big fan of the seasoning or the sauce."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! The sign on the door says it's not your average Korean food and they are right! Korean BBQ was unreal! The pork belly melts in your mouth, but everything we got was delicious. The waitress was very helpful and knew the menu well. We ordered more than our fair share....and we ate it all! 

What we got: 
-Pork belly (small)
-Fire chicken (small)
-Sweet potato birds nest
-Ramen mac and cheese
-potato swirl 
-Lycee martini 
 

They serve everything family style so keep that in mind when ordering. They also mark on their menu what items are gluten free! Will be going back ASAP!"}
{"text":"I have to admit I did not know what to expect when I came here. THIS IS NOT TRADITIONAL KOREAN FOOD. The sign on front door even stresses this.

1) Try to park in the private lot. The nice hostess told us that there is truck depot across the street and they have a hard time getting out if you street park.

2) Bathrooms are clean. 

3) The staff is very knowledgeable about every single item on the menu. We had never been there before so this was good. 

4) The food:

Hits: the pulled pork tacos are delicious. They are loaded with Korean pickled veggies and decadent pulled pork. The soy sauce and garlic chicken wings were nice and crispy. Be careful when you pick these up they are physically hot. Next are the pork ribs. These are event with the dipping sauce. 

Misses: the ramen and cheese. Would have been better baked. The crispy pork belly was too chewy. The fire chicken was not spicy like I thought it would be. Next time I will leave these items off and it will be better I think. 

All in all we will most likely come back."}
{"text":"Probably one of the worst restaurant experiences I've ever had in Charlotte. We sit down and the bus boy is cleaning the table beside us and sprays us with the cleaner. We then order a beer and it takes over 20 minutes to get to us. No apologies or anything by the server. We then order our food and specifically ask for the wings to be our app and that doesn't happen. Our main meal comes out and everything tastes bland. We had the fire chicken beef ribs wings which were all fatty and bland tasting. We expressed our dissatisfaction with our experience and the waiter ignored us. We will never go back. I will end this with the fact that my husband and I eat out all the time and will always give a place a second chance but not this time. Eat at your own risk."}
{"text":"Hellooooooo new fav place in CLT!!! This place is seriously delicious. ORDER THE WINGS! You seriously MUST order the wings - they are the crispiest, juiciest, most flavorful wings I've ever tasted - and I'm not even a wing-lover. Our crew of 4 ordered 10 wings as an app before chowing down on a ridiculous platter of more meat and sides... and it was incredible. 

For dinner, we split two half-options of the brisket and pork belly along with 3 sides. The boys ordered the butter beers (heavenly - a must try for HP fans), and the girls ordered the house margarita (happy median between sweet and sour, with a surprise coffee-tasting \"drip\" of sorts on the side - random, but it worked!). Needless to say we rolled out with very happy bellies. 

The atmosphere is very casual. Food is served in recyclable (I assume) baskets, which I find kind of strange - is there a reason that real dishes aren't used? Seems like a lot of waste. Aside from that, though, the atmosphere is vibrant and fun, and we also discovered the karaoke rooms in the back hallway heading toward the outdoor patio. We didn't get the chance to step inside, but it looked like people were having a blast. Great spot for a birthday celebration or just a fun night singing wirh your crew."}
{"text":"When you go somewhere 3 times within a week you know its good.  I have sampled most of the menu and my fav's were the wings and pulled pork.  Cracklings and the potato swirl were the better sides I had.  What was more impressive with than the food was the service, on each occasion I had a different server and each was just as enthusiastic and eager to please as the others.  I will most definitely return again."}
{"text":"After almost a year, I finally put my first visit to Seoul behind me and decided to give them a second chance. The good news is, I didn't get sick this time! The bad news is, the good news stops there. Everything about this visit was just off. Service was off. Timing of the dishes was off. Food quality was waaaaaaaay off. They were even off on our table, giving our wings to the group beside us. 

We ordered a lot of food and none of it was even what I'd consider average except for the wings, which as mentioned earlier, we had to ask the table beside us for when one of the waitresses dropped them off and left them there despite that table telling her the wings weren't theirs... So, besides the average wings, we had:
- Tofu taco = disgusting with soggy/wet tofu and a cold, store-bought flour tortilla 
- Bulgogi sausage = nothing special, a little tough and dry
- Pulled pork = a little soggy, no distinct flavor unless you doused it in the spicy hoisin sauce 
- Ramen Mac = also disgusting, giant pile of plain ramen noodles dumped in a paper boat (so, the ramen at the bottom stuck to the paper) with a gross cheese sauce carelessly pooled on top; we had to mix it up ourselves to coat all the noodles 
- Potato swirl = not as awful as the rest but desperately needed seasoning 
- Sriracha cracklings = Ok but should really be  billed as an app, not a side 

Our server offered no help or explanation of the menu, even when asked. I had to prod him to explain what the fruit punch and egg nog beers were all about. We had various servers all night long, and no one ever checked in or asked what we thought of the food. This despite them clearing trays with half-eaten items.  

We were one wing in to our apps when our dinner order appeared. There wasn't even enough room at the table to put the tray down so the sever just awkwardly stood there, staring at us until we cleared a few things away ourselves so he could drop the tray. 

Such a shame this place isn't better. The concept (Asian BBQ joint) is great but the execution falls way short!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Ramen Mac and cheese so yummy, not heavy at all. Sweet potato birds nest was fun and sweet. The best of all was the crispy pork belly. We had a small and shared all three things and it was plenty. Tony was our waiter and was delightful. Great new place and fabulous food."}
{"text":"Loved the rib - it felt like I was in the Flintstones it was so big and it had a ton of flavor.

I enjoy bringing a large group and splitting the side dishes.  They are always a favorite including the giant wings.  The only side item we have had we didn't like was the birds nest potatoes... they just didn't have any flavor.  

I also didn't love the pork belly.  It wasn't my cup of tea.  

I can recommend the fish and the fire chicken.  Both were also stellar.  

Really super attentive staff and again good local beer selection."}
{"text":"It's Sunday Funday!!! I've been meaning to come here for a while. Let's start off with the parking. It sucks. I had to park down the block near the Unknown Brewery, for $3. The restaurant didn't seem busy. I noticed several people park behind the building then go elsewhere(not fair to paying customers). Ok, my Kanye West rant is over. 

Walking in, my friend and I requested a table for two. The hostess said, they were short staffed it would take 15-20 mins, but we could sit at the bar. Welp, to the bar we go Diana! 

The bar. I definitely appreciate any business that has purse hooks! Yess!! We were greeted right away. The bartender was VERY Informative, without looking at the menu he covered everything!!! I swear our food couldn't arrive fast enough!

What we ordered:
- Drinks: I settled for Lemonade! Which was amazing considering I had a birthday hangover. My friend Ordered a Margarita. Which sneaked up on her later (she has a low tolerance) I'll have to judge for myself later! 

- Food: The Kimchi Pork Ribs- were okay. Fire chicken- nice smoke flavor! Comes with shredded cheese on top, really good. 6 wings (3-soy Garlic and 3-Spicy) the spicy wings had too much sauce. The Soy garlic were crispy with great flavorful!! As for sides we ordered the Ramen Mac & Cheese, along with the potato swirl! The Best!!! Needless to say I will definitely be coming back again soon!!"}
{"text":"First off..the creative name gets them some brownie points! They tell you right at the front entrance \"This isn't your typical Korean restaurant\" what they mean is their dishes fuse traditional Korean specialties with your classic American BBQ dishes.  It's a very cool concept, that leads to some really tasty menu items.  

So far my experience with the menu can best be described as 80/20.  80% of the things i've ordered were really good...the other 20, i will pass on in the future! 

Best items:
1. Soy Ginger Wings (the other flavors were ok, but this is by far the best)
2. The Brisket taco (probably the tastiest item on the menu)
3. Fire Chicken (tip, order the sticky bun side to put the fire chicken in!)
4. Pimento Cheese Dip
5. Deviled Eggs
6. Pumpkin Beer!!!!

Ok Items, but not the best
1.  Ramen mac n cheese (i was just hopping it would be better.)
2.  Kimchi Pork Taco (not bad, but not the brisket)

Items i will pass on:
1: Potato Salad (just didn't do it for me. Very bland)
2. Sweat potato birds nest"}
{"text":"Oh-M-GEE!!!! If you haven't been here; YOU BETTER GO!!!! 
Holy bageezy!!! this place has the best wings EVER!!! 
Great atmosphere, great food, why are you still waiting???  Go!!!! 
(Don't ask for Ranch; they don't serve it, but you absolutely will not need it!) The potato swirly thing... Yummo!!! oh and the pork belly... Heaven!!!
The patio is amazing; all kinds of stuff to do, and they even have a little doggy park area.  You must try this place out."}
{"text":"Okay here is why I'm giving this place a 2: Their fire chicken is garbage, it's just a strange tasting chicken and cheese dish. 

Yes the waitress was sweet & she described the dish but she didn't mention it'd be loaded with cheese and sauce. I thought it'd be a more smoked / drier or not as wet dish. 

She did try to see if I could exchange the dish or take it off but the manager was being a jerk. 

Y'all should better describe your items or just take that one off because it's not that good of a dish. 

& I really did want a refund or the ability to swap that weird dish out for another one."}
{"text":"O-M-G This place is fantastic and 5-Star!!!!! You will not be disappointed!!!!! Ample space for drinks and games and the food is the most authentic Mix of Korean American Fusion with fun variety!!! The Wings have won awards for their perfectness!!!! Who knew fried wings could be so perfect!!!!!"}
{"text":"Have been here a few times because it is always a good meal. Almost everything is served family style which is the best way to experience a restaurant with a wide selection of good food. Their drink selection is also unique and probably the only time I'll enjoy drinking because it all tastes so good. The watermelon soju and lycee soju are some of my favorite and can be shared. I've tried most of their meats and you can't really go wrong with the exception of the kimchi pork. 

Service is amazing as well. Last time I came here was with a big party. The service was exceptional despite being a large party. Drinks were always filled and the server came by frequently to see if we needed more drinks or food. Really glad I came with a large party because I finally got to try sides that I have yet to try and they did not disappoint! There is one server in particular that gives the best service I have ever had. He works pretty much every time I go there. Will note his name next time I see him."}
{"text":"Went to lunch yesterday with a friend and my 1 year old. Staff was very friendly, my daughter loved the music and kept dancing in her seat. The food was excellent. The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because it's family style and I don't like that so much. But it worked for us fine yesterday. Prices were decent also."}
{"text":"Big fan of crispy wings and that's just how they are served here. Got a 10 piece half and half and wings are huge, probably could have went with smaller portion for one person. Spicy wings were much more flavorful then the other option. Got the kimchi fries as a side and was well worth price and calories, the bulgogi beef on top was a wonderful touch. 

Washed down the the food with a fruit punch beer that was really light and refreshing...place was jam packed even on a rainy Sunday afternoon, and servers were pretty attentive. Friend did have the tofu option and literally took one bite and thought was disgusting, but who's eating tofu at a place w meet in title right."}
{"text":"So glad the planets/stars/other celestial bodies aligned and I was finally able to get to try this place out.  I was supposed to go play tennis, but the pouring rain said otherwise... and then what I thought was going to be a \"quiet night in\" turned into an amazing feast.

Firstly, I want to commend the servers and staff of this place - I know it probably does take a lot of patience to deal with food noobs to this place.  Everyone was so friendly and had a ton of suggestions - especially since it was my group's first time there.  

While we were waiting for the rest of our party to arrive, we found a spot underneath the metal awning behind the bar which is probably my favorite spot since you have bar service right in front of you and can people watch into the rest of the entire restaurant.  People will be fighting me for this spot when it gets warmer and the weather becomes more predictable, but for now... I'll take a little rain since it drove people inside.  

Our very nice bar server suggested to start with soju, but I was leaning toward the beer- she must have had training from Leonardo DiCaprio and \"inceptioned \" me since I decided to go soju anyway.  I forgot how good soju can be - they offer a ton of different flavors, but I went straight up.  Later a friend ordered the yogurt soju and it came with a smoking shaker....  later I deemed it unicorn tears since it was so good - I've also had a good base of regular soju so my talking filter was unhinged that evening.

The table became ready and everyone arrived so we decided to take the awning party to the table.  The menu has a lot of choices... it's a one page menu, but it can be intimidating.  The BEST part is that you can't go wrong with anything you order... and don't be shy to share!  We ended up trying things off of a complete stranger's table (we traded bites of items).  I love it when food brings people together.

Got to try the pork belly, wings, brunswick stew, kimchi slaw (vinegar), soy deviled eggs, ramen mac & cheese, sweet potato swirl.  My taste buds and stomach were a pair of happy campers that evening.  

Overall the place has a great location... I love the fact that they don't let people park on the street in front of the restaurant.  Lets you see the patio and also gives you an unobstructed view of uptown when you are in the patio itself.  The decor is super inviting and comfortable, just like the people working really hard to make sure you have a great experience here.  Great place - I'll definitely be back since I'm within walking distance (a bit dangerous - I can hear the soju bottles trembling behind the bar already."}
{"text":"I have to agree with Candyce in that I don't get the hype. I came here with some friends for some late night grub.

Everything is served as it is available. So you could get your sides before your protein. I ordered the wings, the Ramen chili and the soy deviled eggs. The ramen chili and the deviled eggs were ok but nothing special. The wings were great - fluffy and crispy breading with tender chicken inside.

Atmosphere-wise it's quite loud inside. They have a patio with a few picnic tables that seems like a better option. 

The only reason I can see this place as being successful is because of the neighborhood it's in. It's Trendy."}
{"text":"AMAZING! I have been here twice so far and both types the food and beer has been wonderful! I HIGHLY suggest the wings! Very large and crisp with great flavor!"}
{"text":"The fire chicken and the potato swirl were amazing. The pulled pork was a bit fatty. The birds nest (fried sweet potato) wasn't anything special. Kimchi coleslaw was good, as well as the broccoli. Definitely try the flavored soju! I can't wait to go back and try the wings."}
{"text":"The best wings in town- period.  Big and crispy - always 100% cooked.  Thankfully they are finally open at lunch.  Go there- today - get the wings.  You're welcome."}
{"text":"So many great things to say about this place! Delicious beer (try the blueberry), GIANT wings, amazing kimchi fries, great fish tacos!! The service was fast and our waiter was extremely knowledgeable of the entire menu and receptive of any questions we had! I'm leaving completely stuffed and totally satisfied!"}
{"text":"While not a crowded category, Seoul Food is easily the best food in that part of South End. Just get the wings They are the best things on the menu. Also GET THE YOGURT SOJU. Do it."}
{"text":"Great facility, great Decour, clean sleek bloody Mary and Mamosa bar. Their food selection is not large. Wings were good, fried tofu was wonderful! Tacos were okay."}
{"text":"Great place. The wife and I have been here repeatedly. The staff is always very friendly and service is quick and excellent. We've tried a good selection of the menu between us and what we've mostly enjoyed everything we've tried. 
All the appetizers are good, some great. My favorite are the cracklins. The vinegar taste in addition to the spicy seasoning makes them unique and uniquely addictive. I even get extra to take home. The potato swirl is probably the next best. 
Can't say I'm a fan of any of the meats other than the chicken, but the chicken is good. 
Our favorites entree item are the wings. They are delicious and perfectly cooked. After experimenting with the menu, this is probably what we will be getting on all our future visits. (Okay, who am I kidding, I still need to try the tilapia...but after that, it is wings)"}
{"text":"I didn't know what to expect when I walked in here. Haven't had a good experience with Korean fusion before, but this place is amazing!!! The beef rib was to die for; marinated and smoked to perfection. The wings were better than bonchon (I am originally from philly) and the kimchi pork brunswick stew tasted better than my mom's kimchi jiggae. The variety on the beer list was perfectly paired with the food. The service was also on point as well. Can't wait to come back to Charlotte again to try more of the food, especially the pork belly!"}
{"text":"The bartender was great and had amazing conversation. They use dry ice in their sake, which is really cool touch. This place has amazing crispy fried garlic wings. Their happy hour special is pretty dope. $1 side items are great. Got the chili ramen mac and collard greens ... both were on point."}
{"text":"They have a really cool atmosphere and the outside bar with games truly makes the restaurant. However, a tad overpriced. If you don't watch the bartenders they'll under pour your drinks."}
{"text":"When I heard the word pork belly was on the menu I  ripped my shirt off and turn green until I dose myself with 10 lbs  of pork belly..After I bathed myself like a Dog , I realize this restaurant was very hip trendy service was awesome with beautiful young Korean ladies and men , if you like Korean men , I will stick with Pork bellys instead .  Very cool relaxed place..
 I will come back.. I enjoyed it ...I really love this place long time.."}
{"text":"Absolutely adored this place!! The atmosphere, food, and service is out of this world! The kimchi fries are our favorite! We rented a karaoke room for a group of ten, and had one of the most memorable experiences ever. We even had our own private server! I will continue to come here when we want to get lit and eat an amazing meal!"}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong.... I love some greasy comfort food, but this food takes greasy to a whole new level. I've tried this place three times now because I WANT to like it, but I can't get over the amount of oil that drains out of my food. If they fixed that problem, this place would be much better."}
{"text":"My husband happens to be a tough food critic.. I was not very surprised when he loved the wings! They were warm and well seasoned, fingerlicking good! To be very honest the best we have eaten!  Everything we got was delish.. they also have private rooms for hire and a dog park.  Needless to say, we are fans and highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  Best place to eat in South End.  This place keeps me coming back, they take care of my dog...  water readily available and the occasional beef rib bone for him.  The patio is great!  The atmosphere is really nice.  It's different, Korean hip hop/pop playing throughout.  The service is TOP NOTCH!   Food comes out quick and hot.  

The drink selection is great too!   Just a heads up, the beef rib can be kind of fatty.  That is my only negative for this place.  But like I said? It is the best place to eat in south end!"}
{"text":"I highly enjoyed the fire chicken and the kimchi very very good and nice atmosphere..the service was great!"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE Korean BBQ & thought I had eaten the best, that is until I ate here! The porkbelly and wings are my favorite! The food was phenomenal but they also have so much to do like private karaoke rooms and games outside on the full service porch. I would highly recommend it and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We tried this after several friends recommended it. We did not regret it!!! We ordered the spare ribs and the wings (soy garlic & spicy BBQ) AMAZINGGG!!! We also order a sweet potato birds
Nest which was good. I definitely look forward to going back."}
{"text":"Love Seoul. The service is always efficient, even when they are swamped. The food is good, and the atmosphere is top notch."}
{"text":"So I ran across this place doing my part time job, Postmates so I told myself I have to try it out myself. Me and my guy decided to drop in tonight to get a bite to eat and I am so glad we made that decision. The food was GREAT! We order the potato swirls, ramen mac and cheese, tacos, fried chicken, and 20 piece of wings. The waitress warned us that the portions were big and she wasn't lying. Nevertheless, we enjoyed every bit of it and actually took home 10 wings and the fried chicken. All I can say the food was great, people were extra nice, and the cost wasn't bad at all. We will be going back soon!"}
{"text":"A must-go for anyone living or visiting Charlotte, Nc! Get the wings and blueberry beer. This is always a go to spot for meeting up with friends and playing outdoor games."}
{"text":"There are so many great things about Seoul Food so I will give it to you as succinctly as possible:
1. The pork belly: Melt in your mouth good. Cooked to perfection with a crunchy exterior
2. The soy garlic wings: I'm not kidding, the best wings I've ever had. And I LOVE and eat ALOT of wings. Crunchy on the outside, tender on the inside, and perfectly sauced
3. Ramen mac: How have I never tried this before? It's so simple but so genius. Imagine if Ramen and Mac n Cheese had a baby. Cheesy heaven
4. Beef ribs: Falling off the bone tender. Super flavorful!
6. Hitachino Nest Hefeweizen: Special shoutout to this beer! Perfect drink pair with a plate of meat.

This is a great place to visit with a group of friends!"}
{"text":"I went here a few weeks and had a decent experience. I went with a friend and it was a busy Saturday evening and we sat at the bar. However we couldn't get a bartender to pay us any attention without us waving them down. And this was a regular occurrence for everyone who sat around us during the evening. Our food was amazing. The drinks were pretty good. 

Now to my second experience...I came back 4/13 for dinner with my boyfriend and it was a terrible experience. From the time it took to get our drinks to the 40 minutes it took to get our food even though the tables on both sides of us ordered after we did got their food before us to the service. It was just a mess. And the management told us there was some confusion in the kitchen (whatever that means) and that was why we didn't get our food. When we got our food it was delicious which is the only thing that made it tolerable. The manager gave us 20% off which I feel like is unacceptable considering I waited 40 minutes and two tables I know for a fact ordered and were served before me. Additionally our server didn't inquire about why our food was not coming until we brought it to his attention. It was just underwhelming overall. It will be a long time before I come back to this place and I'll hope the service is better but I won't hold my breath."}
{"text":"Interesting place that has a southern and Korean fusion. The environment was nice and laid back."}
{"text":"Looking for something fast and different my boyfriend and I decided to try this place conveniently on South Blvd. near home. If you are new to \"Poke\", it's Korean/Hawaiian just FYI; because you should automatically know that, right?? . Ordered two \"build your own\" bowls totaling $25 and some change including tax. However, they do have a discount/punch card for frequent flyers in which your 11th bowl is free. While I did not at all enjoy the seaweed salad (one of the 3 toppings I chose), or the bean sprouts atop my bowl, after picking those both off.....it was ok. The seaweed salad and sprouts tasted a bit....canned? Definitely something skunky there, that wasn't right. However, my boyfriend's bowl was pretty good. They have crushed flaming hot Cheetos as a topping offering....yes, Cheetos. It's actually pretty good. Soooo, all in all I would give it another try and make my bowl a bit differently opting for more fresh toppings. I think it's worth trying if you are looking for something that is quick and different. Especially if you live in the area. It's better than eating Chipotle everyday for lunch ?."}
{"text":"Very much enjoyed our meal here! We went on a Sunday night and it wasn't too busy - had our food out in about 5 minutes from ordering. Tried the wings and the soy garlic were delicious - light and crispy with tons of flavor. Main course was the beef rib and we weren't disappointed! Again, full of flavor and very juicy (a little fatty which probably contributed to that). We live close by so I know we'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"So after my lovely bride and I went to see I Love Dogs we needed a little something to eat and ended up here amid a passel of pups. yea doggies!
Medium-big wait for a proper table inside and kinda tight and kinda noisy so we eventually found ourselves out to the patio (sign says no glass past the door) on a warm sunny afternoon. Not sure how this plays when it gets hot hot but dining out of doors in the spring in the shade is good by me. Found two at the bar, got situated, got waters, got menus, got some help figuring out what it all meant... sort of.
On recommendation we sampled crispy pork bellies: oh my, this is the biggest small ever! (love/hate to see a large) 25mm bits fried hard on the rind and hot and soft and wet everywhere else with a little taste of the mainland in a savorable sweet brown sauce; ram -n- cheese: because it's PPF and some long stringy noodley thingy in cheese is universally good everyhow you do it; spring rolls: lightly fried and crisp and perfect for early June; plus dirty white rice and fruit punch to wash it down.
Got a kim-chili for giggles, MLB says \"Ooo! Hot!\" I say \"Kimchi in lieu of standard spicinesses, neat!\"
Finished with green tea ice cream on sweet biscuits which eats exactly as good as you'd expect."}
{"text":"Big disappointment.  This place has only hints of Korean flavor, and honestly....the wings were the only thing that tasted good. I lived in Korea for some months and really wanted to like this place.  I know it's not meant to be authentic Korean, but the flavors just completely miss the mark. My pork belly was disgusting.  I was in a larger group, tried pieces of other plates and was completely underwhelmed.  I would consider giving them 2 stars, but the average reviews are way too forgiving so I felt the need to go with 1.

Go to the kbbq place next door.  Much better!"}
{"text":"Love the industrial vibe of the place. Love the servers, some of the nicest I've ever come across. Love the menu, as everything is mouthwatering, or close to it.

Food comes out lightning fast, like you're still wondering if you ordered the right stuff, and bam! there it is, leaving you to decide by looking at it. The flavors are also spot on. Even the televisions nail it (at least when we were there), with some Asian game shows, along the lines of MXC, subtitles and everything. Nice.

What isn't quite right is the execution of the dishes.

- Ramen mac & cheese: Flavor was good while warm, but unfortunately after a minute or two, that cheese turns into a government cheese glop, which is not attractive at all. The crispy pork skins added nice texture, until dissolving into the glop.

- Wings (specifically soy garlic, but I suspect on others): The flavor was again spot on, but the breading was so thick, it was tough to get at the meat below. I think this was a breading and not some alien, radioactive Troma-movie like super-thick skin, but I really don't know. Our son loved them, however.

- Pork belly: great flavor, but totally mixed textures. The meat was great. The fatty portions, in bits, was good. The cracklins were often too tough to eat due to fear of breaking a tooth. Next time, the pulled pork would probably make a better choice.

- Buns: Related to above, trying to make sandwiches with pork belly (and other items) was a good choice, and with pulled pork, would probably be an excellent decision.

- Sweet potato swirl: Again, amazing flavor, but one of the oddest things I've ever eaten. If you can get any to your mouth, it dissolves in cloudy goodness, but getting it there is a challenge. Bonus: If you save it, take it home and chill it in the fridge, it becomes a lot easier to eat (though you still get the stickiness of the sauce on your fingers).

- Potato swirl on a stick: Also great flavors, but a little unwieldy, not quite as bad as the sweet potato however. At this point, we were just slowing down. Had as an appetizer, this would have probably been better.

End result: Amazing flavors, even presentation is great. But eating some things wasn't the easiest, and definitely messy. Think fajitas, but worse. Probably not a first date place. And wetnaps would do wonders."}
{"text":"The meal was enjoyable and the restaurant itself is beautiful. I did not find anything we had for dinner exceptional. 

I am a big fan of BBQ and Korean food. So, naturally, I thought I was going to absolutely love Seoul Food Meat Company, but I felt like I was missing my favorite parts of both cuisines. I went with my cousin and we had a beef rib, pork belly, a half-and-half order of wings, the spiral cut potato, and some kimchi slaw. 

The beef rib was ok. It was a large short rib marinated like kalbi and supposedly smoked. There wasn't much smoke flavor, but that could be due to the fact that it was cooked medium. It took some effort to get the meat off the bone. Generally with smoked BBQ, it should only require a gentle tug to pull the meat off the bone (it should not be falling off). 

The fried pork belly was delicious. I have never seen pork belly like that in Korean or BBQ restaurants - but it is common in Filipino cuisine as lechon kawali or in Chinese cuisine as siu yuk. 

The Korean fried chicken wings were decent. Not the best I've ever had. The SoGa (soy garlic) was pretty tasty, but the hot flavor just tasted like kochujang. 

Honestly, the sides were ok, but I wish they also had straight up kimchi."}
{"text":"I got sick from eating at this restaurant. The seat we were sat at was tiny and awkward, and very close to the neighboring table. We ordered 2 meats and 2 sides. The ribs seemed boiled and were mushy. The wings were actually ok, pretty large and crispy but very salty. The ramen Mac and cheese was basically a square of ramen with a slice of kraft melted on top. The sweet potato birds nest was very greasy and hard to eat though it tasted decent. After dinner we went to a movie and I became very ill from the food. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for a while!! Came here and got sat right away. I'm glad we came at a good time because after we were sat, there was a pretty large wait. Our server was Dylan and he was an awesome server and very sweet and attentive. He asked if we were there for a special occasion and my husband told him it was my birthday. They didn't sing to me thank goodness but they did give me complimentary champagne! 

We started off with the wings half and half. They are not lying when they say it's JUMBO. Wings were delicious and had a great flavor to it. We also got the pickled deviled eggs. I got the fire chicken (small portion) and my husband got the crispy pork belly. The fire chicken was good! I wish it had more sauce to it. The small portion was huge. The crispy pork belly was good but they are not joking when they say it's crispy!! We got a side of \"dirty\" rice. The sauce that came with it was good but I could do without it or less sauce. The food came out quick! 

Overall, we had a great experience here. Atmosphere was great. Food was awesome. The manger/owner came by and checked on us and that was a nice gesture. Dylan, once again was awesome!!"}
{"text":"It has a cute back seating area with like lawn game style. Would be awesome for summer months. Very unique idea and has a fun atmosphere so I was exited to come here visiting from Boston. Unfortunately was a disappointment in food and taste, especially when I love Korean food! 

Basically it Korean food made to order like BBQ. Meats comes on a metal tray with sides. 

Kim chi cole slaw was lacking in taste and overly strong with just pepper. 
Kim bap was my favorite and closest to the Korean taste.
Wings... eh i think Bon Chon chicken taste 90% better. 
Ribs ... made the mistake of ordering regular ribs but we wanted the big beef ribs. It tasted OK.
Collard greens : I would pass if you are expecting the \"Southern\" taste but it's js tastes like its cooked in broth.
Devislish eggs were pretty good. Love the idea of incorporating \"Korean\" touch to it by using aged or soaked eggs.
Also got the corn dip with shrimp chips? Don't remember the name but that's as pretty unique and I love it.

Overall I'm glad I tried it."}
{"text":"Friendly service. Food was just okay, like maybe the food isn't the focus of the place. We ordered I feel like everything on the menu. We liked everything we ate but not enough for a repeat performance. The place does have a nice, chill vibe--it was a great place to enjoy an afternoon watching the Panthers play!"}
{"text":"I ate here a week ago after picking my husband up from the airport. We walked into an empty restaurant with a sour smell. I thought twice but based on the reviews I figured I'd give it a chance. We ordered pulled pork, an order of wings in both sauces, the kimchi slaw, the pimento corn dip and one of the potatoes on a stick. I wouldn't say we didn't try enough variety to get a feel for the place. The food was ok but nothing special. The pork wasn't very smoky, the wings were drenched in sauce, we could've skipped the slaw, the pimento corn dip would be better warm and the best part was the fried potato. The portions are pretty small so it adds up quick unless you go during happy hour like we did. No issues with service but I can't say I'll be back."}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch and I still can't move because I'm so full. 
The chicken wings (half and half) were amazing and so crunchy. I ordered the squid kim bop, that was alright. It was spicy but I was expecting the squid to be hot. I would try a different flavor next time.
I got 4 different sides (kimchi fries, deviled eggs, Brunswick stew, and corn cheese dip). My favorite was the kimchi fries and the corn cheese dip. SO DELICIOUS! The portions were huge! One thing I didn't like was how I couldn't order extra chips for my dip. I was willing to pay extra but they don't not give you that option unless you order another portion of dip. Also, I felt like everything I ordered had kimchi in it, which is delicious, but I wish they would highlight other Korean flavors. 
We ordered the pork belly, it was average.  The star of show was definitely the chicken wings and sides!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Wonderful service. Server was very knowledgeable of the menu and guided us to the perfect meal. Beer selection sort of limited. Fun and games galore and a great social place. Definitely #1 place for visitors and natives to charlotte. Can't wait to go again but it will be a while before I am hungry lol. 
Fed 5 hungry guys for less than $90 and we were all full."}
{"text":"After waiting a few months for them to work out any kinks, I finally got the chance to try out the Korean fusion bbq here in Charlotte. I came on a Saturday evening with a 20 person reservation, and they were happy to have us and the service was surprisingly good for that amount of people! The server at our table was very patient as it was most people's first time, and we all left full and happy. It's definitely best to go family style with whatever size group you have, in order to try everything they have to offer and split the cost. Everyone shared what they ordered and the highlights were the Fire Chicken, both flavor wings (they only have 2 which my personal favorite was the red chili paste), and the ramen mac & cheese. The kimchi spare ribs were too subtle in flavor but they were cooked nicely. Might as well just order a side of kimchi with something else.

And of course with the large group we had to share the watermelon and lychee sojus. Without some soju shots, it's not a true Korean night out!"}
{"text":"First of all, the wings here are HUGE! If you want an abundant amount of meat, definitely order the wings. Seriously, you will get full off of 5 or 6 of them. 
I prefer the soy garlic flavor over the spicy bbq because it is more flavorful and the sweetness paired up with the garlic is very satisfying. However, I do think the wings need some work on holding the flavor in-once you get past eating the skin everything tastes bland and that is probably because there was so much meat left. I had to order the kimchi coleslaw (which tasted like like regular coleslaw, I don't know where the kimchi comes in) to help me finish the rest of the wings. 

Then, the crispy pork belly was overpowering in flavor-as in it was too salty in my opinion, especially after eating the wings. It tasted great with the bao bun but by itself I would not be able to eat more than two bites. The pork belly skin was super crunchy though, the crispest I have ever had actually. I would probably order this again with a side.

Finally, the pulled pork was the only meat entree I actually enjoyed and would order again in a heartbeat. It is packed full of southern barbecue flavors and had the perfect amount of vinegar in it. I was able to eat this by itself but paired with the bao buns the taste is out of this world. I highly recommend trying this one out! 

Overall, the food was average and some of the meats were too greasy. The meat dishes are hard to eat by itself but if paired with the right sides like bao buns and potato swirls, it could taste a lot better. I wish some of the sides came with the meats though because paying $4 per side makes my wallet cry. The service is great when slow but poor when busy. I would probably come back next time and order only the pulled pork and try out a couple of drinks because soju is awesome."}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time today and was impressed. I wasn't familiar with Korean food, and the menu doesn't give a lot of explanation. I had to ask a lot of questions, but the server was more than happy to explain. I'd recommend the wings with half and half sauce. The spicy sauce wasn't too spicy, just an adequate amount of spicy. We thought we needed to order a few side dishes, but the wings were plenty filling. Overall it was a great experience, and I plan to return."}
{"text":"I'm going to start this off with pointing out it was my mistake, the pescatarian, picking a meat company restaurant for dinner. When I initially looked at the menu, I saw that they had tofu wings, so I got excited and there are usually several fish options, so I figured I would be good. Unfortunately, that was not necessarily the case. There were fish options but not many... the tilapia was spicy and the wrap they said was tuna salad which isn't exciting. I figured I'd just go the route of a side of veggies or two. Usually this isn't the issue except all of their veggie sides were spicy and I am not a huge spice fan. I also considered the tofu wings but they only had 2 kinds of sauce - spicy and soy garlic. 

I just felt that my choices were very limited - and I get it! I went to a restaurant that has \"meat\" in the name so for a part of it, I can really only blame myself. I gave 3 stars just because even if I did eat meat, the sides were limiting to carbs or spicy food and not much in-between. 

On the other hand LOVED the watermelon beer! It was beautiful, refreshing, and very tasty. I am not sure exactly how they made it but it tasted like fresh pressed watermelon juice mixed with some kind of ale. It was perfect."}
{"text":"The combination of Korean and Southern BBQ just makes sense. The beef rib is phenomenal. The kimchi tastes homemade. The pork, available in several forms, is succulent. You literally can't go wrong here"}
{"text":"I will put this down as my favorite Asian restaurant thus far in Charlotte.  It is fusion, not Korean as the name \"Seoul food\" might suggest, but the flavors are balanced and on point for each item I tried, both for Korean and the Chinese flavors. And I am very picky about my Asian food across the board. 

The Korean beef ribs are an excellent take on Kalbi Jjim ( ), not Regular Kalbi (which is what most Korean places serve), which I happen to love. Meat is fork tender.

The pork belly is Chinese style with super crisp fatty side (almost like chicharones) and super delicious with a side of Bao (the Chinese buns).

Bonchon style fried chicken would definitely hold its own against original Bonchon chain. My favorite is the soy ginger flavor. Fried, yet not greasy at all, because of the special process. 

Free tiny sides with the meat include the sweet radish cubes (the kind you get at Bonchon) and Korean style pickle slices. 

The sides I purchased included kimchi slaw (it's not kimchi, its not fermented. it's a spicy slaw with definite strong Spicy flavor which evokes Korean) which was refreshing and definitely in the Cole slaw family and shouldn't scare anybody off.

Sadly the ramen mac & cheese is not yet available on the menu, because I really wanted to try it (slowly expanding the menu I think, and the place has been only open 6 days since their soft opening).

I took mine to go, waited maybe 10-15 minutes because didn't call ahead. but hanging out waiting for my order, the interior was nice, kind of a reminiscent of a Bonchon but bigger bar. TVs showing Korean music videos and the like, very modern and cool vibe. Well lit. Plenty of parking in back. Owner was super nice. 

I'd go here if they only had the Bonchon style double fried crispy non greasy wings. They're super popular in New York and California, and it's great that Charlotte finally has them."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. We had the pulled pork and fire chicken plus the tofu wings. The only reason I gave 4 stars is because they were out of a ew of the menu items."}
{"text":"So glad we went here with friends before a concert at the music factory. Four of us and lots of food served family style. Our server Tony was great! Attentive and helpful. Fun beer and drink list. Draft specials when it's raining and save a buck when you check in on Facebook. Order a pitcher of beer and get these cool pretzel sticks! 

We got 3 meats and 3 sides for the four of us and it more food then we could eat. The Kim chi ribs were fall of the bone and had great flavor. The crispy pork belly was my favorite. Also loved the chicken. The Bao buns were wonderful and the Ramen Mac and cheese stole the show. We also tried the wings and loved the crispy soy ginger ones especially."}
{"text":"Awesome BBQ!! Atmosphere is great- young and old alike all sitting around eating good food at the bar. Loved the pulled pork and brisket...and the Ramen Mac and Cheese oh and the green tea corn bread. Service was fantastic- both fast and friendly! This is a place you NEED to eat at when you come to Charlotte! Will definitely recommend and return!"}
{"text":"Without a doubt, some of the best food ever! Get the soy garlic wings, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I like the place I do, we will def come back but I have to complain about how pushy our server was on trying to raise our tab with shots, If it had just been my husband and I, I would've understood, but we had our baby with us and we had already ordered beer. He asked us if we wanted to order shots at least 4-5 times and in a very frat boy obnoxious way. Other then that, the crispy pork belly was delicious, kimchi fries were delicious I would've liked more kimchi though, kimchi sausage taste was great but the texture was funky, don't know if it just needs more binder or what, ramen mac and cheese I wouldn't order again, bao buns were nice and soft and really good with the cucumber salad and pork belly with sauce. 
I look forward to trying more things and more beverages when the time is right, I'm super curious about soju."}
{"text":"I had been looking forward to trying this place for quite awhile and I'm so sad I didn't like it. I got the chicken wings, deviled eggs and the kimchi Cole slaw. The Cole slaw was ok at first bite. After 3 bites I couldn't eat anymore, something about the flavor was not appetizing. The first wing was good, but time I made it to the second I realized I couldn't eat anymore. Between that and the deviled eggs it was so salty I couldn't take it. I had 3 glasses of water while I was there and I just could not quench my thirst or get the flavors out of my mouth. My boyfriend got the fire chicken and the cracklins -he said they were \"ok\". The atmosphere was fun, a little loud, and the drinks were good too. Servers were nice. I wish I liked the food more. :("}
{"text":"This place offers some really out of the box food. Amazing combo of Korean and Southern Comfort. Would recommend this to any adventurous or curious eater!"}
{"text":"Beef ribs and the wings are amazing. Went 3 days in a row because of them. I think it even restored my faith in humanity..."}
{"text":"I discovered this place for a birthday dinner and I was pleasantly surprised. They have a cute patio area with lots of seating. We sat in the private room and the service was prompt despite the size of the group. Unfortunately, I was on a vegetarian diet this week which sucks if your visiting a restaurant with the words \"Meat Market\" in the name lol. I ordered the soy ginger tofu, sweet potato bird's nest and ramen mac & cheese. We also shared the a shake(I think) served in a watermelon, which was delicious. The tofu was not my favorite but my friend's wings looked delicious. The sweet potato birds nest was okay, it is similar to a deep fried sweet potato hashbrown. The ramen Mac & cheese was good. Over all the atmosphere is very nice and the next time I will definitely order the chicken."}
{"text":"Great food! Wings and fire chicken are amazing! Don't miss out on the grapefruit shandy either! Local favorite!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, very good beer list...what's not to love?

Our server made a lot of great recommendations for my group to order: ramen, pulled pork, potato ball thingys, etc etc etc...there was too much food to choose from and my boss had the company card sooooo...we ordered A LOT! Nothing was bad. 

The end. 

PS....I know this a very blanketed and general review, but when something is solid, sometimes all you need to say is, \"it's solid.\" What more do I need to say?!"}
{"text":"Consistent. Whenever I take someone to seoul food I can guarantee them that it's going to be good. The place can get packed and you might have to wait but it's always worth it. They have a ton of sides which have always amazed me. Recommend the ramen mac n cheese, bao buns, pork cracklings, wings, and everything else on the menu. Dogs are allowed outside too, so bring the 4 legged friend."}
{"text":"I loved this place. We went for lunch on Saturday and it was really great. It's not Korean food but Korean inspired. The service was very friendly and fast. The portions are huge. The beef rib was fatty smoked goodness the way they should be. The pork belly was a combination of crispy, soft, and salty perfect. The chicken wings are huge and very tasty. The ramen Mac and cheese was simple but hit the spot. The noodles were the perfect consistency. The spiral potato was like a perfect potato chip in a stick. They are dog friendly too.  I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"From California and traveled in to eat some southern food. This was by far the best meal I've had in a very long time. Very busy place and the wait is a bit but so worth it. I plan to visit in June and making it a point to go here on every visit!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the food here!  The soy garlic wings are the best, but I don't think I can pick a favorite it.  I am giving a giving three stars because I rarely get seated efficiently.  I had to just leave after hearing the hostess figure out where to seat an unscheduled party and then looked at us (2 people) and told us we can sit outside.  After we said no (because it's 50 degrees) she pushed twice saying there were heaters.  We weren't offered a wait time for inside or another solution.  Unfortunately, we had to leave."}
{"text":"Wow! If you are looking for something new come here. Let me preface this by saying it is no where near traditional Korean food but is instead a fusion place that takes southern BBQ dishes and puts a Korean spin on it. The food here though is amazing! When I was there I had a sausage, the kimchi fries, and the pimento cheese corn dip. I was blown away at the flavor each item had. I am a true Korean food lover so I really enjoyed seeing many familiar flavors in the dishes. Check the website to see when happy hour is!"}
{"text":"A few friends took me here when I was visiting Charlotte for the week and I was definitely intrigued. BBQ food meats Korean flavors- hence the name Seoul food.. cute. We ordered the wings, the crispy pork belly, the sausage, the kimchi mayo slaw and the sweet potato birds nest. I think my favorite was the sweet potato birds nest which were thin crispy sweet potato fries essentially in a birds nest shape. The food was just good. Cool concept though!"}
{"text":"Great place to hang out or come with a group of friends.  I like the family style meals and their wings are great! They will fill you up though!  The outdoor adult playground is wonderful on a warm afternoon and they always have a great selection of beers!"}
{"text":"Place smells great, horrible service on the weekend. Had a simple order that took 30 mins to handle. Half of our party was served, half of our party was not. More staff needed for busy hours. Food turned out to incredible, overall was worth the wait. This would be a five star review if the service was better. Will return."}
{"text":"I wish these wings were not so good because I can't stop thinking about them. Sooooo good.  Soooo crispy.  Also loved the cracklings.  Friends in my group loved the fire chicken, wasn't my favorite but still pretty good.  We got the steamed buns to go with it which was pretty good and different.  The woman who waited on us at the bar (really nice Korean woman working the bar out back) was great,  she took great pride in introducing us to Korean food, and gave good honest recommendations about what she thought our kids would and wouldn't like (warned KimChi fries would be too spicy, but they looked great so I would like to go back and try).  And yes, we brought our preteen kids who loved playing all the fun games out back while we caught up with friends.  A great addition to South End."}
{"text":"We came here right at 4:30, which is when they open so service was super fast since there were only 2-3 other parties there. I would recommend coming with a large party so you can order more things and sample everything. 

The half and half wings were my favorite. Both flavors were equally good. The wings are ginormous and had a thick, flavorful, crispy coating. The spicy wings were barely spicy, and I have a pretty low heat tolerance. I also recommend the choiang brocolli, which also says spicy on the menu but is not at all.

The crispy pork belly was ok, just VERY crispy, almost to the point where it was hard to chew. It comes with a really good sauce and I'd recommend ordering the bao buns to go with it. 

The ambiance is pretty modern/rustic which I enjoyed a lot. The food is expensive though, definitely more than I was expecting."}
{"text":"Wow, just wow! I can honestly rave about this place for days. It only took me one visit to realize how great this place is!

I would come back here just for the wings! The rest of the food is great, but their wings are very unique. They only have two flavors, which I think they should definitely get creative and come up with at least two more, but the flavors they do have are fantastic! I like the soy garlic better because it's got a good balance. Sweet, salty, and a very small amount of heat. What makes their wings perfect is the way they prepare them. I'm not sure if they're breaded or if it's just the way the oil congeals when it's cooked with the chicken but wow, are they awesome!

I had the opportunity to try their other food items like the Fire Chicken, which wasn't very \"fiery\" to me at all in terms of heat, but it did have a little kick. It's pretty much chicken breasts, topped with some type of chili paste, and melted cheeses. I really enjoyed it. Their beef brisket and ribs are awesome too. 

I didn't have the opportunity to try many sides, but I did enjoy their ramen chili. It didn't have much ramen noodles in it, but the little bit it did have rounded the side dish out pretty good.

The only things I think they can improve on is expanding their wing flavors like I mentioned, and figuring out how to get more seating because it appears that they can get a little crammed when it's busy. Other than that, I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Excellent service. Even more excellent food. What more can you ask for?

We ordered the deviled egg, wings, ribs (buns are a must), coleslaw, dirty rice. I highly recommend everything we ordered. All the food came out promptly and super delicious. It's 5 hours after my meal there and I'm still drooling at the thought of the ribs sandwiched between the baos and that dirty rice...so yummy! I would eat here everyday if I lived here. 

This place is definitely a very unique concept. I would agree it's southern BBQ with an Asian twist. My co-worker and I flew into Charlotte for a work meeting and stopped by for lunch. We walked out full and happy. We even boxed up the leftovers to continue the feast back at our hotel rooms."}
{"text":"Great vibe.  Great food selections, fast and tasty.  Pork belly using prime ingredients, not the cheap fatty belly selection.

Turn the clock back to the college days.

A complete playground...  the adult one."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! We had the wings and they are the best I've had!  You have to try them. We had the mac and cheese, the beef sushi, the beef and kimchi empanada. I'm a big fan of their kimchi.  The service was perfect. Jnelle was very friendly, she had great recommendations and she made sure we had everything we needed, without being overbearing."}
{"text":"How are you going to charge some one$100 dollars for an hour for a karaoke room for 3 people and said there was nothing open but that time.. everywhere I went from atl to la never said such a thing.... food was good but service and tone was stuck up."}
{"text":"Best service I have received at a restaurant in some time! Our server was Tony and he spent so much time explaining the menu to us since it was our first time there. We got the pulled pork, wings, potato swirl, slaw and bao buns. Everything had a kick but was excellent! A bonus being that it came out very quickly. 

I would highly recommend this place! Great atmosphere, prices, and service!"}
{"text":"Delicious tofu wings and normal wings and always a fun time. I'll never get tired of their interesting foods and always bring visitors to Charlotte there. I had my birthday party there!"}
{"text":"Believe everything you've read/heard about the wings. They will blow your mind. We got the pork belly, fire chicken, half and half wings, and bao buns all for $37 and we were stuffed and had plenty of left overs. The meats come in small (1/2 pound) and large (1 pound). We got all smalls, and for 2 people it was more than enough. Awesome atmosphere, nice outdoor patio, Korean hip hop (K pop.) Great little spot. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"I've been to this Charlotte hot spot a few times by now...and I have mixed feelings.  On the upside, I loved their unique fusion menu of Korean street-Southern comfort foods; and I enjoyed their quirky \"tray\" presentation.  Then the downside...of impossible parking, long wait and haphazard service!  Let me explain \"haphazard\".  First of all, many of their food items are cooked separately (in separate kitchens?), so the foods do not come out all at once...which I find annoying!  On one of my visits, they misplaced some of our order (AKA Forgot or Lost)...so we literally had to wait 45 minutes for them to prepare some of our food.  On one other visit, we had to resort to eating at the bar...which was awkward. Did I mention that it's very loud here?  It's super crowded, hectic, almost a club-like atmosphere...with some people just walking around!  I did like the foods, but their overall ambiance did not appeal to me.  I prefer quieter, more organized restaurants, so this will NOT be my hot spot anytime soon.  If I do opt to go again in the future, I'm going to make an effort to go on a weekday, during their off hours."}
{"text":"I like the ambience. I think lighting is everything, when in comes to dining. This place got that part right. Our bartender was also really amazing. She was super busy, but was still able to provide excellent service.

We ordered wings, Korean pork belly, Ramen Mac  n cheese, the slaw and the pimento cheese dip.

They have no ranch dressing! WTF! If you are serving wings, ranch is a must. Dude get some ranch dressing!

It's all just okay. With the exception of the Pimento Cheese Dip, that was super tasty.

For beverages: they have a great selection of craft beers, BUT no drink specials... If you want a better deal on beers go to Craft, it's across the street. 

I'd be a repeat customer, but only for beverages and the ambience."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time last night.  I will start by saying the outdoor patio is a great space and would recommend definitely sitting outside. For food we ordered the ramen Mac and cheese, sweet potatoes birds nest and vinegar kimchi for sides.  For our meats we had crispy pork belly and wings.  The pork belly came out first and we thought it was good until the wings came out and that stole the show.  The wings are phenomenal. Very different than normal wings and has tremendous flavor. As for the sides the Ramen mac & cheese was very good and the sweet potato was very good and different. Next time we will pass on the kimchi.  Overall they do it right and can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"I thought the food was great!  We had some wings and pimento corn it was delicious.  The service was great food came fast!  And they are open for lunch on sunday! Quite good!!.  The hot wings could be a lil more spicy but besides that i cant wait to come back!"}
{"text":"We were in from out of town tonight and had an awesome meal at Seoul. Our server Eddie knew the menu really well and made several great suggestions.  Despite ours being the only table outside on a chilly night, he checked in with us regularly.
We ordered a lot of food, but the pork tacos, kimchi fries, ribs, and sweet potato birds nest all stood out and were all incredible. The sweet potato birds nest would be good to save for last - it would make a great dessert.  
Also, the patio area is dog-friendly and well fenced in - if your dog slips its leash, it won't escape out to the street."}
{"text":"Wouldn't recommend this place. Came on a double date with another couple and we tried a few different menu options. The ramen mac n cheese was dry, the Korean chicken wings were entirely too big and looked like they were pumped full of steroids, the collard greens were decent but nothing to rave about. My bulgogi sushi roll was what I was looking forward to, but the bulgogi was entirely too tough. I got tired of chewing :-/ My cocktail was watered down. The staff is very friendly and the atmosphere is fun!! The concept is awesome but the execution of the dishes is less than stellar. It left a lot to be desired and I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"I love love love this place!! First off the pork belly!! All things goood!!!! The onion ring tower hit the spot. It's seasoned to perfection!!! The portions are huge and you can definitely share!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good spot in south end. A large drink menu that includes your beers, cocktails, and specialty Asian drinks as well. Great food. Korean fried chicken is without a doubt some of the best in town. Picked soy deviled eggs are also delicious. I've had their beef ribs and fried pork belly but wasn't all that impressed. Generally don't go there for a sit down dinner anymore, but rather for drinks and snacking on those wings. Service is good. Food comes out quick. There are also games on the patio for entertainment."}
{"text":"Crowded, loud, great location and a mixed bunch. 

Bulgogi kimbab was bomb, could eat these all night.

Potato skins on a skewer, good and fun to eat while drinking.

Garlic soy wings were tasty.

One of the above caused me to squirt massive amounts of liquid out of my rear. I lost a nights worth if sleep and as i am now sitting at the airport, hit the pot several more times. Love getting on a plane in this type of scenario... Thank you Seoul. 

And if you're ok with getting 1 drink every hour. This is your place. They need 6 more bartenders to accomodate the crowd."}
{"text":"Nice laid back atmosphere, service was friendly and fast. I gave only 3stars because there wasn't anything I particularly liked that had my taste buds dancing . Was the food good, yes , everything was prepared well but I just think I can't appreciate the Korean fusion cuisine.  

I did like the sign on the door that stated \"We are not a traditional Korean restaurant \" lol. I even asked for chopsticks and it was a flat no, we don't have them . The foodie in me ordered a lot bc I wanted to try different stuff but it was a lot of food . Meats are a Lil pricey and sides you order separately at $4 a pop but you get plenty so it balances out. 

I feel my Fried pork skins were a Lil too hard and lacked flavor unless I dipped them in the chili oil.  The green tea muffin I ordered it so my 2yr old would have something to munch on but he didn't like it , I tasted it and it was good just different.  The soy deviled eggs, hmmmm ... if you like soy sauce flavor go for it! Koreans use soy sauce in almost everything.  The kimchi coleslaw was my favorite , I should've ordered rice and just killed that. The bulgogi tacos were the winner , simple, flavorful , and decent size . Also it's the only thing the toddler, teen, and father ate .

I can see why this restaurant is popular , offering Korean flare to American style dishes . I would take a newbie foodie here to ease into the taste of Korean cooking."}
{"text":"I really don't understand the hype to this place. I've talked to several other friends and they say the same thing. Their food is mediocre at best which sucks since I had such high hopes for this place.

My family and I came in on a Saturday evening and it was pretty packed. We probably waited around 45 minutes before getting seated. The first thing we noticed was that it was hella loud. We practically had to scream at each other to converse. 

Now onward to the food. Since I was so hyped about this place, I prepared my stomach to try almost everything on this menu. Needless to say I left frustrated with the quality of the food:
Fire Chicken: probably the best thing i had here. The chicken was made really well and had melted cheese on top for flavor.
Crispy pork belly: second favorite. Skin was really crispy but the fat from the pork was practically dripping when I picked it up. Definitely was a turn-off.
Ramen mac and cheese: EW just ew. The ramen all stuck together and was cold when we got it. The cheese did not coat the ramen at all.
Dirty rice: I can't get why they call this dirty rice. It was basically plain rice with some dressing on top. 
Wings: Crazy amount of batter (I Understand korean fried chicken is known to have batter but dang it was a lot). Also a bit on the sweet side.

We also got other dishes from the menu but it's not even not mentioning. Quite honestly, save your time and go elsewhere. There's so many great options nearby."}
{"text":"There was NOTHING in this place that hit my buds that DID NOT have flavor... And NOT all this same flavor.. I love this place... And the drinks are awesome...me...\"oh, umm I will have a corona??!!!\" Lady and my son I unison \"umm , we make our own beer.\" 
Oh great son, could you have not gone over Carlolina beer etiquette with me before we left the house"}
{"text":"Went to Seoul for the first time for a weekday drink on the back patio. First, there were flies everywhere. It's summer and hot out but still that's pretty gross. Second, the bartender was honestly in the top five rudest I've ever encountered. He would only take one order at a time and slowly at that. When he finally could be bothered to take your order it would be 3-7 minutes for a draft beer. And he took everyone's credit cards to close out- then proceeded to take 3 parties food orders and hold our cards the whole time. 15+ minutes for 1 beer and to be treated like an inconvenience is really unacceptable. Definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"Food is great.. Cool atmosphere.
Must try. Got the wings half and half and the pork with dirty rice and Kim chee slaw.. The slaw was incredible."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. I got the wings (half and half) and both flavors were amazing. I also had the spiral potato, shredded pork, and the buns. Overall everything was amazing and I'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"This literally used to be my favorite restaurant. The food is amazing and the atmosphere is great , Janelle is literally the best waitress they have! Until I went there for my birthday and they were extremely rude from the time I made the reservation till time I left ! We had a party of 12 , and only 6 of us was on time , and they kept telling us how they can't sit us down until the rest of the party comes ! Then I ALWAYS order the kimchi fries with the kimchi on the side (as you can see in the picture) but for some reason they were making a big deal about it , even making the manager come to the table to explain why they can't simply but the kimichi on the side which I was still paying for ! So instead of bringing the kimichi on the side with they brought my fries completly plain with nothing on it , when it usually comes with bougli and 2 different types of sauces !"}
{"text":"It's hard to believe there is a place as cool as this! The food is amazing and the ambience is perfect to spend the night. My husband and I tried the soy wings, the pulled pork, the sweet potato nest and the bao buns! Can't say which one was the best! If you are in Charlotte this place is a MUST!"}
{"text":"Pretty disappointing experience. Manager was extremely rude and food was barely 'subpar'. They can do better than this, I'm sure."}
{"text":"Seoul Food Meat Company has a flair that you can't find anywhere else. Everything that I have tried here is good and whenever anyone mentions going here for dinner I always say yes. Their wings are amazing and the potato spiral is fun to look at a delicious. The restaurant is in a cool location near downtown and they have a lively outdoor area with foot pool and other games. Definitely will be going back here and would reccommend."}
{"text":"Sarina was so so so helpful and knowledgeable and awesome. The food was awesome too :)"}
{"text":"I literally cannot SING the praises of Seoul Food enough!  My friends and I visited on two separate occasions last month, one of which included utilizing one of their amazing Karaoke Rooms, and another just me and my husband for some dinner. WOW!  The food here is incredible.  I wouldn't necessarily say this is traditional Korean food, but I would say that its so delicious and doesn't even matter! The wings are out of this world delicious, as is the Ram & Cheese, the deviled eggs and the tacos! I would pass on the broccoli if it were me!  The Karaoke rooms are rented by the hour, they do not take reservations, but its a FUN time for a large group to sing with their friends only."}
{"text":"Love it!!! I could eat here every week! Great dinner options, awesome appetizer specials, local South End beer options, AND a new outside deck that was still under construction when I visited. Highly recommended to anyone venturing around South End!"}
{"text":"The best way to describe this place is Southern food with an Asian twist.  Sounds weird, but give it a shot.  We've been back multiple times at this point, and will keep coming back.
What to order:  the bbq.  Ask for extra sauce.  Order bao buns to stuff it in, and I would go with one set of buns per person.  The pimento dip with chips is amazing.  We also love the sausage.  The Brunswick stew is really savory.  The ramen Mac & cheese is also yummy."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat great food while my pup tags along.  The Korean BBQ sauce is good on anything you put on but, it has a kick. BEWARE...they do not carry ranch or blue cheese so you may see some regulars carrying their own.  Overall, it's a great place to go and a must visit in Charlotte.  My personal favorite is the brisket with ramen Mac & cheese."}
{"text":"I've been to Seoul ladies and gentlemen and the food at this place pays homage in all the right ways.  Soju in a pineapple is just over the top in all the right ways.  Crispy pork was heavenly and the wings were flipping outrageous.  Don't sleep on the biscuits with green tea ice cream either.  P.S. the Kpop was a nice touch.  Simple things done extremely well at very reasonable prices.  Loved it!!!!  I can't wait to return.  Great service too!!!"}
{"text":"Review update! I came back to this place to give them a second chance, because everyone deserves one. I ordered the bulgogi taco, 1/2 and 1/2 wings, Ram Mac, and kimchi spring rolls. Annnnd...the spicy red wings were good...and the fire dipping sauce was good. Everything else was not. The soy wings were not tasty..bland and boring. The spring rolls had beef and pork inside and looked very processed/not at all fresh. When I told the waiter, he said he could get me something else, but was quick to add, wouldn't take the rolls of the check. Why? I don't like them, the flavor was gross, and I will be hungry because I'm not eating them. That's fine, I didn't complain for the money. I hoped to get something more edible, but I decided against ordering anything else if their policy is to charge you no matter if you hate the food or not . I've not liked  much of anything they have, so why waste time and money. Ram Mac was extremely boring...and extremely tasteless. The taco was also not great. 

The customer service was poor, a huge disappointment. And I wasn't happy again with this place. The drinks are the only decent looking things, as I saw some being delivered to a nearby table. I didn't feel like sticking around to try them, though."}
{"text":"HELLO delicious crispy chicken wings!! If you come here you have to try them. This is always the best part of the meal. I've been here twice now, on my way to breweries, to load up on carbs and calories and would say they are very consistent with food quality. You should expect to wait during busy lunch and dinner hours. We put our name in and stood around the bar to kill time. Try the Sujo. We enjoyed the strawberry and were surprised by how delicious the lychee with yogurt was. Such a great experience pouring the drink into your cup while the steam from the dry ice spills out. We also had the ramen cheese which wasn't as great as I would have hoped. It seems they cook a block of plain ramen and then sprinkle some cheese on top. Nothing special. The steamed buns were top notch, definitely recommend giving those a try. Now this is a barbecue place so I would suggest you try some of their meat. I will say it's our second time to try the pork belly and each time we were disappointed to find that the crispy part of the pork belly is so hard it hurts your teeth to chew it. Seems a little strange although the flavor is great. We had the pickles to help cut through some of the grease we were eating. Everything you order comes out on a tray which is excellent for sharing and creating conversation. Will definitely be coming back next time we're in Charlotte but probably just for wings and sujo."}
{"text":"Went here last night with my gf. I like it. The food itself is good. But not Korean good if you know what I mean. Not authentic Korean taste in my opinion. The meat quality, perfect. Chicken wings were HUGE. Got a lychee-tini. SO GOOD. Very refreshing. Didn't taste like there was much alcohol in there which, I love! Our waiter was nice, she knew what she was talking about. Except this one weird part when I asked her how is the tilapia and she it's very pretty and good for pictures. . Other than that it was a good experience! I would go back!"}
{"text":"Not bad but nothing to rave about. It gets a little bro-y so if that's the vibe you're into then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"One of the best places to eat in CLT! The drinks menu is very different than most places in south end which makes it a novelty to have in such a beer heavy area."}
{"text":"Great reviews so I was really excited to try this place but it just didn't deliver for me. It was just ok and honestly I probably wouldn't go back unless I was going with a bunch of people who wanted to go. 

Great atmosphere, great service but the food just wasn't that great. I got the fire chicken, the flavor was a little bland and there was nothing spicy about it. Tried the pork belly and it was incredibly dry. The pork rinds were you know- pork rinds, nothing special there. The pimento cheese was just ok but the chips or whatever those things are that come with it has zero taste. 

All and all nothing was bad it's just not memorable but the place is pretty cool. A lot of people like it so if you're wondering about it I would at least give it a try."}
{"text":"Brisket tacos were amazing and the wings were delicious. I just wish they served ranch dressing here."}
{"text":"This place is Korean-American fusion. They serve everything family style so go with people who like to share and try different things. They have main meats, wings, tacos, and sides. The absolute best thing on their menu is the wings. They have two flavors soy garlic and spicy BBQ both are amazing. The soy garlic are slightly sweet and salty and have the most amazing crunch while the spicy BBQ have a little bit of kick. Some of their dishes are unique and not quite my preference but it's fun to try new things and this menu has so many things to try. Can't wait for another trip."}
{"text":"Pros:
Great patio with lots of games
Lots of great beer selections
Great food
Friendly staff

Cons:
Long wait for a table on a weekend
Slow service (15 minutes to get a drink)
No heat lamps (or they weren't turned on)

Takeaway: This is one of my go-to spots when it is nice weather. They have great food and the outdoor games (giant jenga, pool soccer, beer pong) are great for a Saturday or Sunday afternoon.

Would I go back? Definitely!"}
{"text":"Korean and Southern barbecue fusion is so spectacular, I don't get why more people haven't jumped on this concept. 

The restaurant is so upbeat with Kpop music. The aesthetic is very modern southern, with wooden table tops and metal chairs. The food is served on baking sheets covered in parchment paper with food on paper trays. 

It seems like the optimal way to eat is family style, which I believe is the best way. Just order a bunch of food, try everything, then split the bill evenly with your friends. I recommend getting a salad with all your food, just to balance things out.

I highly recommend giving this place a try."}
{"text":"Came down from D.C. And really glad we stopped here. The food was really good here. We had the wings half/half. Potato swirl (so much flavor!) chopped pork and finished it with the watermelon sojo. On top of the good food, the ambiance was nice with good music to keep you going. However the best part was the customer service. I was shocked how good this guy Kevin was when helping us with the menu to making us feel at home."}
{"text":"Get the beef rib!  I crave it when I think about it.  The wings are awesome and so is the pork belly.

There are a few underwhelming things on the menu,, like the pimento cheese and the ramen mac and cheese, but that didn't take away from how much I liked the place.  

Their specialty drinks are also a neat addition.  I will be back."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the portion size was just right. The wings are the best!................."}
{"text":"This place was incredible. The food was top notch and the drinks were great. Service was fast and very informed about the menu. I was so pleased with the environment and food quality. I work at a Japanese restaurant that has very good bao buns and the bao buns we had tonight at Seoul were some of the best I have ever had."}
{"text":"Outstanding food and service.  We were promptly greeted and seated when we came in.  We didn't realize it but we arrived shortly before they were closing down their lunch service; this didn't effect our experience - we weren't rushed at all.

We tried the combo platter that we was recommend by our waitress.   All the meats were were top notch and we enjoyed everything. 

If your in the area, stop by - you won't be disappointed. 5 stars the whole way."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!! Five stars for all. Never been before. But this place is really great. The waiter was so energized and tell in one minute what's going on over there !!! The beers are so interesting, i think we'll come back only to trate the another twenty beers they have. The service was extremely fast. Really fast. Even the music was funny, Asian pop and rap videoclips was playing all the time. This is the right place if you don have nothing to do late at the night)))"}
{"text":"I went here on Friday for lunch with a group of co-workers and oh what a great surprise this little gem was. We had a party of 7 however we still didn't wait but 5 minutes to be seated. The décor inside is simple yet chic with wood tables and thankfully a nice music playlist of hits was playing in the background (I hate a stuffy environment). The waitress came and we let her know this was our first time at the restaurant. She explained that the meats are ordered separately from the side. 

Me and a few of my co-workers decided to spilt a few food items and ordered wings (half & half), Ramen Mac & Cheese, Green Tea Corn Bread, and Kimchi fries. The food didn't take very long considering we had 7 people in our party but the wings did take a little longer to come out than the sides. However, it was worth the wait. The wings were some of the best wings I have had...light yet crispy and the sauce was unique but I liked it. The half and half wings included both the spicy and soy wings and I think I prefer the soy but I equally enjoyed them both. Let me just say this...I can't wait to eat these wings again. They were that good and even better as leftovers the next day. 

Now let's move on to the sides Green Tea Corn Bread didn't disappoint as I'm a carb lover and the sweet butter was the icing on top. It's really hard to mess up fries so the fries were good but not anything extra special (again they were needed as I'm a carb lover). Now while the Ramen Mac & Cheese was good it's just mac & cheese so I wish I had of spent my $4 on another side. Either way I will be back anyway and I will try some of the other sides. 

Additional feedback from my co-workers: A lot of gluten friendly options which is a plus, one of my co-workers is team meatless and loved the tofu, someone else had the Brunswick stew and thought it was some of the best they ever had."}
{"text":"First off our waitress was great! She was helpful, kind and very patient as we went down the menu asking what we wanted to eat. 

My main complaint is that once our food was out and we were done eating and beginning to nibble around the rest. Our waitress and other wait staff kept coming by our tables asking to take our items (water at that, which members of our party are still drinking). 

Then after being there for an hour, a normal time to sit for dinner and catch up with friend. A waitress from another section walks over and takes the bags on our table that our main waitress bought over for us to box our food and begins bagging our food and basically kicking us out. 

It was very odd and I have never experience such. Customer service. While the wings are amazing, I really do not recommend any other items on the menu. 

It's unfortunate that this place was ran with such impatience, because the ambiance is amazing and it has the potentional to be a great place."}
{"text":"There's not much that I can say that hasn't already been said. This place, this food... everything was awesome. We started with the wings, half and half. Soy ginger wings are the best I've had in Charlotte. The crispy pork belly loved it. The collards weren't anything to write about. Probably won't get those again but they have you a healthy portion. The buns were a good compliment to the pork belly. Coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Yes, y'all. Yes. 

I've been wanting to try this place for awhile now so my boyfriend decided to surprise me with dinner here on a Saturday night. We found parking really easily in the parking lot next to it (although the parking lot was super dark) and went inside to put our names on the wait list. We were quoted 45 minutes and were lucky enough to grab two seats at the bar. We started with the Seoul Fashioned (for him) and the Lychee-tini (for me). Both were super strong - in fact, mine was too strong and I gave it to my boyfriend. I will say that I felt the portions of the drink were kinda small for the price ($10-$12). I asked the bartender for something sweeter and she recommended the Keep Pounding Punch. It was more delicious (in my opinion) and more reasonably priced ($8). By this time, our table became available. 

Once seated, my boyfriend ordered another drink- the fruit punch beer, which he loved. We then ordered various items off of the menu: half and half wings, cracklings, potato swirl, steamed buns, brisket taco, and fire chicken. My favorites were the taco and the soy wings. I DON'T EVEN REALLY LIKE WINGS, but the soy ones were superb! My boyfriend liked the wings best, as well. We made friends with the table next to us, including a couple who says they've eaten here several times. They highly recommended the beef ribs and said the pulled pork isn't great, so my fella is already planning on trying the ribs next time. 

I also have to say, we had great service. Everyone from the bartender to our server (I think her name was Susan) to the person who brought out our food was really friendly and accommodating. It seemed like everyone who works there enjoys working there and that made for a great experience as a customer. 

There a few things that would've made this even better:
- better portion sizes for some of the mixed drinks
- hooks for purses to hang on the table. The chairs are curved on the back so purses can't hang there and I refuse to put mine on the floor
- lights in the parking lot

All in all, this was an awesome spot and my boyfriend has already dubbed it as a top contender for his favorite bar in Charlotte. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Such a fun place! The food is unique and well prepared. Not a lot of fuss. But the outdoor bar is great, complete with games like beer pong. Refreshingly different."}
{"text":"My first visit to Charlotte and Seoul Food was the best rated place near where I was staying. Came for lunch so wasn't crowded at all and got a table right away. Somewhat industrial/rustic decor with K-pop playing on the TV screens. 

My husband looves their beernog - that's correct, it's a stout topped with eggnog. Interesting concept. Also interesting that a lot of their beer selection is actually Hitachino (Japanese), but I'm counting that as a positive because I dig their beers.

Now food, everything is pretty much served family style on a big platter in front of you. The husband tried to convince me that 1/2 of meat is not a lot and we had to order several things. Trust me it's not trivial... We couldn't finish a bunch of stuff at the end.

Kimchi BBQ pork ribs - My favorite of the bunch. Very tender ribs and got a nice spicy kick to it.

Bulgogi sausage - Can't say I could have picked out the bulgogi flavor in a blind tasting but it was good.

Crispy pork belly - The most disappointing part of the meal. The fat was an overwhelming portion of the serving (I say going on 70%) and the skin was difficult to chew on majority of pieces. I ended up just picking off the small pieces of meat and left all the rest to waste.

Broccoli - The healthy part of our meal. It was more or less steamed broccoli with gochujang on top, no idea why my husband was such a big fan.

Potato swirl - This was excellent! It takes art (or a nice machine) to cut the potato this way. Each piece you pull off is very thin but crispy on the outside and I really like whatever seasoning it is they put on it.

Overall, had a good meal and it was certainly a fun concept fusing southern BBQ with Korean flavors. Seeing other reviews, looks like the dishes are really hit or miss. And if you order the \"correct\" or better items will define your experience here."}
{"text":"Southern BBQ with a Korean Twist. 

Seoul Food Meat Company is an excellent barbecue establishment with huge portions of perfectly fried/smoked/grilled meats with just a very small hint of Korean flavors. If you are not an adventurous eater, the meats are not very diverse in flavor and you will find familiar favorites. My favorite was the Beef Rib and the Fire Chicken, both are perfectly cooked with just a hint of that amazing Korean kick.

If you want to get crazier, the sides are really what you should focus on, there's a variety of 12-15 or so sides, each one looks better than the next. Ram N' Cheese was actually surprisingly not terrible and one of the better of the indulgent sides. Be warned though, they will fill you up!

The service is also super friendly and the dining area is very clean. I love the natural lighting the place gets during the daytime. Would definitely recommend to a friend, especially if it's their first time in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Food and service were great. I grew up on Korean food, so trying fusion style food is always a fun experience. We ordered way more than we could handle but there were no regrets! I would definitely go back for their chicken wings, fire chicken and alcoholic beverages. The melon soju we got was really good. Service was awesome too. Our server Amus was friendly and had great recommendations. They also provided some water for our dog out on the patio."}
{"text":"The food is really unique and delicious. The table management and food service experience are terrible.  Expect to wait, even with half the tables empty. Wait staff are inattentive.  This is my third time eating in. I will only do takeout from now on."}
{"text":"This place is the truth. I lived in Korea from 2010-2013, and eating here made me feel like I was thrown right back into a past life. With the super crispy chicken wings, smell of gochujang in the air, and Kpop videos blaring from every tv screen...I was in heaven. The service was the best I have had since being in Korea. Our super friendly waiter Kevin explained the menu like a boss, took our order, and had our food out in less than twenty minutes. This place is not your typical traditional Korean restaurant, but it reminded me a lot more of places that my friends and I would go to living in Korea. I love that this place exists in Charlotte. Best dining experience in years hands down."}
{"text":"Them wings though!  Stopped in here on Saturday and service was great and prompt.  I ordered the spicy wings and boy they were delicious!  One of my favorite spots in the South end area!"}
{"text":"Great food, casual atmosphere, and fun K-pop soundtrack! Had the wings and kimchi slaw, and both were very good. Each wing is large and my favorite was the spicy BBQ."}
{"text":"Wow, the wings! I am not a big wing eater but the wings here are delicious. This restaurant offers indoor and outdoor seating, and is a great place to dine with a large group. You can order a large tray of meats and sides and share with the group. Portions are ample and you will not leave hungry. 

This restaurant is in a great location, and is walkable from so many of the Southend Charlotte hot spots. This would be a great place to grab lunch before heading to the numerous breweries in the area."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is the only thing this place has to offer. Outside patio is awesome and lively with a ton of games to keep you occupied while drinking. We were informed that the wings were voted the best wings in North Carolina  honestly call me crazy but I was just not a fan. We got half and half and both flavors were mediocre at best. They were cooked well which I did enjoy but the flavors were not there, they unfortunately tried a bit to hard. I'll stick to my favorite Triple S wings at Greystone Pub down the road. The tornado potato was pretty good but nothing to call home about. It was pretty soggy. The service however was good, attentive for how busy they were. Overall not a bad place but I would never go there to eat again."}
{"text":"The food is great but I have a real issue with how they handled our reservation. It was a joke. When I called to make it, I was given a long disclaimer--we don't hold it longer than 15 min, we won't seat you until everyone is here, the person who made the reservation must be present, if you try to come with less people we won't honor the reservation... The day of, I got a super long text reminder of their policies. Fine. I get it. However, if I have to follow your strict guidelines, I should be able to sit at my reservation time or within that 15 minute grace period window. 

Reservation was for 6 people at 7:00. Parking was awful. I  was in the first car and was able to park and walk in before 7:10. I let the hostess know I was here and the other car was trying to park. They made it in the door before 7:15. I'm pretty sure they didn't bother to actually hold a table for my reservation. No one else was waiting when we arrived nor did they while we proceeded to wait 40+ minutes to be seated. It was a few minutes to 8:00 when we got a table for a 7:00 reservation. No apologies for the wait. No customer service. It was very disappointing since I had hyped up the restaurant so much."}
{"text":"I wanted to go to this place for some time now  but it is always a packed house in there as now I know why! 

The food is really unique and unconventional. There is a slight twist on everything that makes you want to try just about everything . 

It is more tapas /family style restaurant so going with a small group is perfect because you can try a lot of different things. 

My favorite by far that I tried was the collard greens! Hands down someone threw it down in the kitchen for real with the greens. Literally taste like they stole my mom's recipe and cooked it in the back of the kitchen! FYI my mommy can make some excellent green!

I tried the tofu wings which I was shock at how good they were honestly and I tasted the actual wings which were equally flavorful and delicious.

I was not a big fan of the pimento corn cheese as it was too heavy on the corn side and a weird texture to me. 

The atmosphere is casual but classy as the vibe is just very different than any place in the Queen City. This could be due to the K-Pop that was playing in the background on the televisions. Hearing the Korean version of R Kelly is always fun as this guy was playing drums in an random corn field. 

Nevertheless, back to the point. Try just about anything and you can't go wrong! Great place and be prepared to wait if you get there too late."}
{"text":"The food was delicious! Keep in mind this was a soft opening so it has a lot of kinks to work out with service and organization. We were the first to be served since we were the first to put in our order. Judging from the atmosphere when we were there, there might be a lot of bad reviews. Don't let them scare you away or else your taste buds will never know this unique...southern fusion?! (Is that a valid term for this?)

The lychee temple was sooooo good! You won't regret ordering it. It wasn't overly sweet either!

The Kim chi cole slaw and Bao buns are MUST HAVE side items. They really complete the meal with whatever meat you order. Ramen mac and cheese was interesting to eat. Make sure to eat it immediately otherwise the cheese will thicken to drying glue consistency.

Beef rib was so tender. It was cooked well; however, I was expecting more of a pronounced Korean twist to the flavor.

The crispy pork belly is...well.. crispy! Don't expect a braised pork consistency. This is your baked pork belly that's drier.

Fire chicken was good as well. It surprisingly had sprinkles of cheese on it. 

The Korean fried chicken wings were the bomb dot com! They do take longer to come out than other foods. These were larger than your average wing. The breading is thicker than normal fried wings. They were crispy, juicy and evenly coated. I love how it's served with pickled radish to cut the grease (I think that's how the pairing usually is in Korea?)

FYI all the food is served on trays like a good ole southern BBQ joint. Gochujang sauce is served with your tray."}
{"text":"Wow! Talk about Horrible service. Took about 30min to order a round of beers for three and then 2 hours to be able to get food. And the food wasn't even good!! Good location but then again there are a lot of other good locations around southend. WASTE OF TIME!"}
{"text":"This place is doing something different and I love it! My bf and I had the beef rib, which was amazing. The flavor was all that Korean BBQ goodness you want. We sandwiched some of the meat in the Bao buns, which were fluffy and sticky and pure heaven in your mouth. I also ordered the spicy ram n cheese. Not too spicy, just enough. It is to die for my friends. He ordered a side of the pimento corn cheese, which ended up being my favorite item. It's served on a bed of puffed rice chips that are lightly salted so they aren't bland, but the  cheese itself must have drugs in it. I'm addicted. We will be going back to try the wings and other side's sometime."}
{"text":"The beef ribs sold me .. wow ..must try 

For the price of this dish and the quality, it's simply amazing. I wasn't crazy about their wings,even if they said they won some Type of award . The service is fast and great atmosphere"}
{"text":"Yummy food. Ordered the Kimchi fries, bulgogi kim bap, Crispy Pork Belly, and 1/2 Soy Garlic Wings 1/2 Spicy Wings. ALL super good, the pork Crispy Pork Belly was my least favorite but still yummy - needed a little bit more salt. Our wings took a while to come out that the waiter was even surprised - once he noticed though he was on it. 5 stars for him! Coming in from out of town and would for sure come back for those Soy Garlic Wings - explains why they've won they're the best wings in Charlotte."}
{"text":"We had half and half of the soy garlic and spicy wings and they were large, saucy and deliciously fried. I can't wait to get more. 

The fire chicken was simple, cheesy, spicy and close to what you find in Korea for chicken dishes. The bulgogi spring rolls were also a nice meaty sweet twist to them. 

My only complaint and issue with Seoul is that it does not have ranch...an absolute necessity with wings."}
{"text":"Wish I could give it 6 stars. It's that good. It's basically delicious southern BBQ with an Asian twist. So your mouth watering ribs have a touch of hoisin. The Mac and cheese? Made of perfectly cooked ramen. Pulled pork, spicy chicken, sausage, it's all cooked to perfection and served on a platter southern style. Atmosphere is very cool, servers and bartenders are nice (they patiently explain the different types of Soju, or Korean liquor), the patio areas (plural) are cool, and I can't wait to check out the private karaoke lounges! If you haven't been to Seoul Food, you're missing out!"}
{"text":"Visiting the city for work and this place was recommended by 2 people for some of the best fusion Korean food in the uptown area. 

Get reservations because without them, the wait was 1 to 1.5hrs, so we decided to have take out from them instead. Take out was supposed to take about 15 to 20 minutes we got our food after 30. The problem is the food came out in a paper bags but needed to be reopened at the door and checked again. We thought it was odd and inefficient to have people in the kitchen package everything and then have to reopen the bags again. Suggestion, maybe you guys should label your containers and don't send it out of the kitchen until people's entire order is done.

The place was extremely busy with people overfilled in the patio and crowded around the bar. Appeared to be a trendy place for the college crowd. Average age was probably 25. Extremely loud, you couldn't even hear the person beside you. The game was on near the bar. 

Despite all that, the food was delicious. We split the medium size of the half and half fried tofu (spicy wasn't as spicy as I expected), smoked beef brisket (so good), fish taco (good) and the sweet potato nest (surprised they were able to get sweet potatoes so crispy and loved the hint of cinnamon), Bao buns (3 in the order), and brown rice as sides. This was enough to share between 3 people with left overs. 

Food was (5/5), Ambiance (1/5), service (3.5/5) and therefore over all was about 3.5/5."}
{"text":"Cute spot located in South End that specializes in southern inspired dishes with an Asian fusion. The wings are everything which I would recommend the soy garlic wings. Their speciality drinks are a little lite on the alcohol but when you ask for a drink not on the menu the drinks came back amazing, I'm thinking cause they looked up the ingredients . One of my friends ordered the deviled eggs which looked green to me so I passed but he loved them lol. 

They have a wonderful patio which in the south can be good and bad with the heat we sweated our butts off but it was well worth it. They play Asian videos and music that are very close to hip hop and R&B which was really cool. 

They also serve drinks in actual fruit like coconut and watermelon that I want to try but with real alcohol lol. Anyway very cool spot to try and the service was great. 

Hidden gem, a must try"}
{"text":"Food is amazing and the staff is always very friendly and welcoming. My husband loves the crispy fried pork as it reminds him of his favorite filipino dish, lechon. The soy garlic chicken wings are delicious and probably the best wings we've ever had. Overall- great food and awesome environment to hang out with friends."}
{"text":"Interesting cross between standard Asian fare (Mostly Korean) and southern staples.  We tried a decent cross section of the menu and was impressed with most all of it.  

We arrived late in the evening, and there was still a fairly good sided crowd, however we were able to get a table right away. It should be noted that apparently two of the more popular items on the menu were out, so if you're desire is the pork belly or sweet potato come earlier in the evening. 

Our waiter was quick and friendly, his advice surely didn't steer us wrong. 

Overall I'd give it a 5 star rating, and maybe it's not fair but while the fusion of the two food styles were tasty, I wasn't blown away, so I have to be honest with the 4 stars. I'm more interested in going back to try out all the beers on the drink menu."}
{"text":"I went to Seoul with a huge group of 12 people.  This included a variety of kids, parents, and young adults who all had a blast. The waitstaff was able to seat us in a timely manner and were super nice and easy going when it came to such a big group.  This place is more of a family style ordering, so I jumped in to order with 2 other people.  We ordered the rib which is huge and amazing.  You must try!  We also go the chicken wings which were delicious too.  The sides we tried were the mac and cheese, salad, potatoes, and broccoli.  All of the sides were delicious too. Additionally, their alcohol selection has a variety and includes Asian drinks too.  Seoul is a must visit place if you're ever in Charlotte!  The atmosphere, staff, and food are top notch!

I've been a couple other times with friends and always have a great experience. I wanted to add that the wings, sweet potatoes, and tacos are some of my favs.  I did not like the tuna (not) sushi, because they use tuna salad instead of real tuna.  Their fruit beers are light, delicious, and refreshing!"}
{"text":"I love this unique restaurant. It was unusually warm out today, so I decided to schedule a happy hour here since they have such a good patio. 

Unfortunately, even though it was 75 outside, they had a tent up over the patio still. I feel like this was a pretty busy oversight since the sides could easily be rolled up. We ended up sitting on the front patio so that we could be outside. 

I love their food. I've had a large portion of the menu in the past. The ramen Mac and cheese is one if my favorites and the tacos are also quite good. All of the meat I've had are amazing. The wings are my favorite wings I've ever had. They are crispy and delicious. I love the soy garlic and my husband loves the spicy BBQ. We of course had to get them this time too. 

They have $1 sides until 5:30 which is a great deal, so we had to get something. We decided to go with the soy pickled deviled eggs and they were amazing. They are now my favorite deviled eggs. The soy added great flavor. 
 
Our service was pretty bad this time. We did have a really big group, but I couldn't get more water the entire time even though I asked multiple times. Others had the same problem. 

There are so many good things on the menu, you really can't go wrong. I recommend coming with a group and getting a bunch of things to share!"}
{"text":"It was disappointing how the bartenders treated my fiancé when she questioned what was put in her drink. As someone who doesn't drink alcohol, it was clear from sipping her \"margarita\" that it was simply $10 juice. To have to get a manager involved and still question her unprofessionally will lead us elsewhere in the future."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I mean so amazing I would drive across town to get some spicy wings here! Stopped in after a round of bar hopping and was starving! The service was prompt, the place was packed for a Thursday night, and the food was to die for. Only had the wings and a glass of wine, but will definitely be back to try out other goodies!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing. Such a hidden gem. Had a snafu with reservations due to having a few not able to come but they were so nice and sat us anyway. The soy garlic wings are amazing. The beef rib on the bone is the best I have had. Will be back many times."}
{"text":"My best friend and I came here strictly because of the reviews because Yelp, duh. We sat outside which was comfortable. Our waiter, Frances, came out immediately and greeted us and got our drink orders. My company had the pumpkin beer that was on special. Get this, it's pumpkin beer but rimmed with maple syrup and sugar, I don't like beer but this was good! I ordered the lychee temple. Not sure what was in it but it was refreshing and had a pear taste. Very good. 

For our meal, we opted for the large crispy pork belly. Now, it was delicious but, the crispy top was way too crispy. It actually hurt my teeth to chew. We ended up just eating the soft middles and leaving the crispy tops. 

For our sides, we ordered the Raman Mac and Cheese, the pimento corn cheese, and the soy pickled deviled eggs. The Raman Mac and cheese was really good. We enjoyed that and it was safe to say, it was the first to disappear off the tray. The pimento corn cheese was amazing! Very tasty and a great portion. The soy pickled deviled eggs were TheBomb.com!! My only concern is make it an order of 4 instead of 3. Lol! The great throw down over soy pickled deviled eggs almost happened last night but we are ladies so we cut it down the middle. lol.

For dessert, the green tea sugar biscuits are delicious! We literally had no room left in our stomachs but I always get dessert for review purposes only . So the ice cream is literally green tea, not a flavor but like actual green tea. Try the ice cream. Then try the ice cream with the biscuit. It's a complete game changer. So delicious!

I highly recommend this place. It's incredible, the service is excellent and the price was perfect. We enjoyed ourselves and plan to return soon! Thanks Frances for being an awesome server!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Ate the spicy bbq wings and the ram 'n cheese. And Chicken Little was a great server"}
{"text":"Finally made it over here! Great addition to the gold district! 

We went late on a Sunday night. I was happy to see that the back patio was still open and they were still serving food even though it was after 9 o'clock.

We decided to sit on the new back patio they just built. They have an impressive adult playground they just built with beer pong and other fun games to play. It is the perfect patio for a spring day with friends.

We decided to get some late-night eats. We got the sweet potato Birdsnest, The pork belly and fish tacos, and the corn pimento cheese. 

I've heard their wings are their best feature, but I am not a big wing fan so we did not try them.

We are very happy with the food that we had. It was SUPER FAST! The food literally came out in five minutes after ordering. The sweet potato Birdsnest was a nice side item and was sweet. The corn pimento cheese was delicious. They serve this with \"shrimp chips.\" I wasn't a huge fan of these, but I loved the pimento cheese. Both tacos were of decent size and we're loaded with meat. We were very happy to have these and they were big enough to share.

The bartender was very attentive and kind. They also have a great selection of craft beer and cocktails. I like that they have a Korean liquor I've never heard of. I always like trying something new. You can buy this in a cocktail mixer to share with friends, which is a great idea.

They have also just added private karaoke rooms. If you have never done this before- DO IT!!! They have rooms ranging from $30-$100. They are easy to rent in a blast with friends. This is a great idea and something you can't find anywhere else in town.

We will be back. Good drinks, good food, and a great patio. They have all of the things they need to succeed in South End/Gold district."}
{"text":"Seoul Food Meat Company, you will always and forever have a place in my belly and heart.

If you come here, I promise you that you will be back again.  This is Korean food with a Southern twist.  You just gotta try it out.  They have indoor and outdoor seating with a fence so your dog can with with you outside on those hot days and cool nights.  There are tvs around the restaurant and there could be sports on, or some fun Korean Music videos to watch.  Either way, the vibe is always poppin.

The food, my. Goodness.  What really brings me back are the wings.  They are fun and different with the crunchy texture it has packed with such great flavor. I also like the Pimento Corn Cheese.  When I have my cheese cravings, I like to order those.  The pimento cheese comes on top of shrimp chips, trust me, just order them.

This part is pretty random to state, but kudos on their bathroom.  Even when you go in, you still get a cool hip vibe in there just as in the dining room.  Every time I go in, it's always so clean so the staff is great with keeping that up."}
{"text":"The culinary experience was superb! I want to tell you guys some things that are worth mentioning aside from how delicious the food was which I am sure you all already read enough about from the other reviews. 
It's easy to say the food tastes good when it's served fresh and hot (because we are usually hungry at this point), personally I feel what separates SFMC from other BBQ joints, is the amount of time and details they put in from food preparation, presentations, to boxing your left overs.  let me put it in this way, I never thought leftovers are good until I had reheated the swirly potato chips, it was still crisp and maintained it's flavor. Of course the bbq and the beef rib were still tender ( never seen any BBQ place that will take the time to pack each item separately, they even saran-wrapped the beef rib to ensure it remains it's flavor and texture). 
Not to mention the PRICE?!!?! For the quality and the amount of food with the little to nothing I paid for, I don't care who's going to be president 2016, I will be going there on the regular for sure. 
There are two things I despite the most in Southend-  bad drunks and limited parking spaces. It's always a plus not have to worry about finding or paying for parking. They got a spacious parking lot in back.
Once they open up the patio area, with the garage door open access to the bar, definitely a nice new hang out spot on game nights and weekends."}
{"text":"I have to give Seoul Food four stars because there is still meat to be tried and games to be played. But I do have to say - the experience that The Lady and I had here was north of 4 stars. 
We arrived here on a Sunday night and were seated almost immediately. I do wish we could've sat outside, but we arrived probably about 45 seconds too early... but there were nice picnic tables in the patio out front. 
Our server was quick to greet us, and we ended up trying a vegetarian meal - Fire Tuna Kim Bap (which is, as much as I still don't understand, is dissimilar to sushi), cold broccoli salad with sesame oil and gochujang sauce, the soy garlic tofu blocks (this was in the place of wings), and the potato swirl with a paprika and parmesan crust. I've never seen a potato preparation even close to this swirl, so that was a fun unique take on a potato chip. And the tofu was... well, it was tofu. But the sauce on it was stellar and I could tell that it would've translated beautifully to real wings. 

Everything was stellar with great flavor, seasoning, and texture. However, \"Seoul Food Meat Company\" kind of implies that their meat is their specialty, and I didn't get any. Next time you best believe that I'm going to try ribs or hell I may even get a whole fish. The world is my oyster.

The atmosphere of the whole restaurant is really cool, and there's Korean music videos playing on the tvs. When we were there, I got to witness the greatness that was Korean hip hop. Y'all don't know great music videos until you've seen Korean hip hop.

Lastly, the patio out back looked incredible. And I've heard that they have an innovative game... soccer pool? What is this sorcery. A definite must visit when we get more time. Anyways, maybe I'll grab John H. soon and head there since The Lady doesn't have carnivorous habits..."}
{"text":"Interesting concept. Not totally southern, and not totally Korean. A fun and eclectic mix of tastiness. On a nice day, OUTSIDE is the place to be. There is a cool, relaxed vibe, like you're at a friend's backyard barbecue. There's cornhole, big Jenga, and even 2 soccerpool courts. They also have an area for your dog to play. 

We had Kim Bap (a fully cooked sushi-style roll), spare ribs, ram 'n cheese (mac 'n cheese made with ramen noodles), and kim chee slaw. We discovered that putting some slaw with the rib meat was super yummy. Ram 'n cheese was so-so. The cheese was just poured over the noodles, not actually baked. The Bibimbap Kim Bap was my favorite. So flavorful and pretty. Oh, and we had soju. Soju is a Korean distilled beverage. It came in a cocktail shaker and must have had dry ice inside because fog was rolling out of the top. So fun."}
{"text":"This was my first time having Korean fried chicken, and it was game-changing. Korean fried chicken wings put regular American bar wings to shame. They are crispy, meaty, plump, and bursting with flavor. 

My boyfriend and I shared the half and half (soy garlic and spicy) medium-sized order, which included 10 pieces. Interestingly, our server said that Korean fried chicken takes longer to cook, but it came out within five minutes. 

Another game-changer was the pimento cheese corn paired with the most addictive, indulgent shrimp chips. The shrimp chips were so good that when the owner stopped by our table I asked him how I could get more and if they sold it by the bag. He said that they make the chips in-house. 

All sides are only $4 each, a reasonable price. 

We also ordered a half-order of fire chicken, but it was too spicy for me, and this is coming from someone who loves spicy food. Completing our meal were the bao buns, and we agreed with the server's claim that they were like pillows of bread. If you order protein make sure you put them inside of the bao buns. 

The building and décor are industrial and minimalist, and I loved watching the Korean pop videos on the TVs throughout the space. 

The only reason that I don't give Seoul five stars was because nobody greeted us for almost ten minutes, and the restaurant wasn't even half-full. We had to wave down a server that was walking by before anyone noticed we were there. Also, the bus boy next to us accidently sprayed us with his cleaner. It was an accident so not a big deal to me, but I can imagine some grump throwing a fit if he gets a mouthful of cleaning chemicals. 

This was only its third night open so I am very forgiving, but that service component needs to be fixed if Seoul wants to make a name for itself in Charlotte's competitive food industry.

Overall, I loved the atmosphere, the creative concept, and the delicious fried chicken. I'll definitely return."}
{"text":"As always, the chicken is great. Specially love their spicy sauce, actually not that spicy for me. But their kimbab(not sushi!), squid kimbab is pretty spicy. Ordered bulgogi and squid kimbab but like squid better. When I tried squid kimbab before, it was not that spicy as I remember. Just be aware when you order squid kimbab, it can be very spicy sometimes. The pork belly was awesome! The balance of crispy skin and tender pork is perfect. First time to try and you should try if you love crispy pork skin. Kim-chili was spicy chili with kimchi in it but not as spicy as squid kimbab! This is my favorite place with outdoor game area and good food. But it will be good to avoid certain busy times as it will be so packed and bathroom lines will be too long lol"}
{"text":"Not like this restaurant needs any more good reviews, but I had to share my first experience there. Crispy pork belly with fluffy bao buns and the spiraled potatoes were my favorite!! I had lychee soju and melon soju (comes in an actual melon!)) and both were so delicious, I'm craving some right now.  Pretty hip atmosphere and good vibes.  Highly recommend.  I'm going here everytime I visit Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Was not particularly impressed with the crispy pork belly. It just was tasteless. The decor is great and the service is good.

I would like to give this place another chance.  I've heard good things about the wings and hope to try those and maybe this spot will be redeemed."}
{"text":"Overall it was pretty good. The chicken wings were definitely on point. We got the half and half, and the soy garlic wings were delicious. We tried some of the tacos and the bulgogi taco was on point, however the pulled pork taco was so disappointing. It was so dry and I couldn't eat it. The pimento corn cheese was good, but the presentation was better than the taste. The service was friendly, the food was good, but I just was a tad disappointed based on previous reviews and the price was a tad high."}
{"text":"Beef rib is amazing. Chicken wings are delicious. Love their sauce. The pork is okay and kinda dry. Parking is hard because there aren't many slots. Get the beef rib!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Loved everything I tried. 

Pork tacos are the besttttt!!

Large portions ordered a la carte. 

However, it is incredibly loud to the point that you won't be having a conversation on a Friday or Saturday night."}
{"text":"One of the best places in South End as the food is terrific, drinks are plentiful and atmosphere is fun, friendly and unique.

Very social vibe out back on the patio with a ton of adult games. Also they have private karaoke rooms you can rent out for an hourly charge which is a cool touch.

I've had the wings, pulled pork, potato swirl (comes w/ two delicious sauces), the ramen mac and cheese and the beef rib. ALL great.

Try the Soju! It's a korean drink that tastes delicious. I like the yogurt. Comes with dry ice in the bottom so it's fun to share and very refreshing.

Only slight critique I have is the BBQ sauce has soy sauce in it, making it very salty. So use with caution or don't use at all (unless you love soy sauce on your BBQ). -- Still 5 stars for me, because that is the theme for the restaurant being it an asian southern fusion."}
{"text":"Ehhh well I would go back. Just nothing to rave home about.  Pork belly was great but some really crunchy pieces in the mix. 

The pulled pork was actually my favorite as it had good flavor. The Mac and cheese ramen was eh ok. The wings were big but a little too breaded. I prefer tender juicy wings. 

Water service was a little strange. Why bring me a new water instead of using a water pitcher? After all, I'm drinking out of a plastic water cup. 

With all this being said, I do want to go back and try items I missed out on! After all, we atleast had great service!"}
{"text":"I have eaten Korean fried chicken at a couple of different places, but this was the best. The vibe was awesome, the offerings unique and everything we ordered (half and half wings, Mac and cheese ramen and loaded potato salad) was SO good. We also had the pineapple soju in the pineapple and it was perfect!"}
{"text":"Casual dining, Fast Service, Good Food 

Came here at off hours, probably right before the dinner rush, so i'd imagine this place could get a lil busy - however, the service is super fast. I sat at the bar, ordered food, had a drink and was in and out in under 20 minutes. 

The menu is on 1 page, which might seem small - but is packed with a lot of dishes. There's a huge app/small plates column which has a lot of dishes not clearly explained - so I pretty much used Yelp/pictures to guide my ordering. Here's what I ordered...

Ramen Mac & Cheese - good flavor, name says it all - exactly what you'd expect. Not the most upscale cheese sauce, but good drunken food quality at the very least. 

Bulgogi (i think) Soft Shell taco - pretty much what you'd expect coming out of a food truck - but better! Loaded with meat, tons of flavor, yummy. 

Fried Pork Belly - heart attack on a tray..lol. Super fatty, crispy skin, very flavorful, and comes with a really good dipping sauce. 

Definitely would come back."}
{"text":"Not your typical Korean BBQ - this place is a fusion of Korean and Soul food. We went on a decently busy night. Great atmosphere, friendly and attentive servers, and amazing food. We had the Fire Chicken, Kimchi Pork Spare Ribs, Doenjang Collard Greens, Chojang Broccoli Salad, Ramen Mac & Cheese. Just the right amount of spice in the food but some of the side sauces have a bite! Would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE!!!

I checked this place out right when it opened.  While they only had about half of the menu available, at the service sucked, it was a unique concept that I wanted to come back to after they got their act together.  So I gave it a second try.  Big mistake.  

I felt sick for 36 hours after eating here.  I pretty much just wanted to consume fruit, veggies, and water to purge my system of the filth that Seoul calls \"Korean\" cuisine.  

\"Seoul\" food is more like \"Soul\" food and really really bad soul food at that.  There is essentially No Korean aspect to the food.  It is the greasiest, heaviest, heart attack on a plate that I have ever encountered.  

I started with the chicken wings. They were huge and looked interesting. Then I took my first bite.... I have no idea what the hell the thick greasy crust was, but it was a lot thicker (and far less pleasant) than skin and a bit of breading. It took some work to get throught this grease rind to the meat.  Next was the pork belly.  Now I love some pork belly, just not Seoul's pork belly.  Parts of this \"crispy\" pork belly were hard enough to break a tooth on.  And the flavor was definitely lacking. This was a dish that could have easily taken an Asian angle, but again, there was nothing Korean about it.  Next up was the ramen mac and cheese.  Don't, just don't, Ever order this slop.  

I really wanted to get the short rib but they only offered it in a massive slab.  I mean, i love a massive short rib but that was just way too much food for the two of us.  The short rib was really what got me to come back since i had enjoyed it the first time I dined here.  It would have been nice if my date could have tried it as it had a chance of being the one palatable thing that we would ordered.  Sadly, every single thing that we ate Sucked and was real waste of a Saturday night while also blowing through my quota for cholesterol for the next month.  

The atmosphere was totally Frat-Tastic!!!  It looked like a frat house after the party ends.  Overly bright lights and every surface soaked with beer.  

I'll never go back."}
{"text":"I have been waiting for Korean fried chicken wings to come to CLT! Not really a big fan of the limited Korean restaurants that already offer them. Seoul's is super crunchy and juicy. I'm actually a big fan of spicy foods, but I actually enjoyed the milder soy garlic sauce flavor more than the spicy bbq. 

Their pork belly is nice and crunchy. Spiced ham was great with the bun bao. Fire chicken was my boyfriend's favorite.

Can't wait to see what else they add to their menu!"}
{"text":"I've never experienced something so overrated in my life. The wings are great but besides that. It's not really worth the hype."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for wonderful BBQ with Korean flair. They have awesome twists on bbw classics (pork belly and wings are my favorite here) and a great atmosphere to go along with it.
You can find the following unique activities/items here:
Outside bar
Corn hole, beer pong, soccer billiards, and other outdoor games
Great outdoor patio
Private karaoke rooms
Soju

Overall, this has been one of the best place to hangout on a warm night for good food and company"}
{"text":"I thought this place was alright. Great ambiance and great drinks (minimal ice so it makes you feel like you're getting a good sized drink). The food comes out extremely quick but the service is so-so...minimal water refills and may forget if you asked for a condiment or side. We had high hopes for the food though - we ordered the half and half wings and while the flavor was awesome they were SO fried, like the most deep fried wings I've had to date. We also got the BBQ pork which was pretty good, the Sausage that was cold BUT maybe it's supposed to be served that way? Our waiter wasn't around for us to ask. And the mac n cheese sounds great but really its like ramen noods with non mixed in cheese and pork rinds on top. Overall - I may come back...but probably only for drinks and a good hang out spot."}
{"text":"Some of the best American Korean infusion you ever try in your life, I definitely recommend the wings and karaoke night"}
{"text":"Oh my must I say FABULOUS!!! 
Great atmosphere, Great Food, and Great Service!
The 1st time we went here we returned 2 more times in one week. The wings are amazing, make sure you get extra napkins because they are messy. Nothing on menu that we haven't tried that didn't knock our socks off!!! Oh and potato Swirl thingy is pretty damn amazing and a must try too!
Yummy this review makes me want to go there right now! Lol"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had a great experience at Seoul for lunch. We had the wings, ramen mac & cheese and the potato swirl. Our server, Jenny, was knowledgable and very friendly. The wings were amazing. Unlike anything we've had before. They're huge and have a thick crispy skin and are super juicy inside. The soy garlic flavor was our favorite, but the spicy bbq was also pretty good. The potato swirl was so good, crispy and delicious. The ramen Mac and cheese was also good, very unique!"}
{"text":"Awesome food with a good variety! Although not true full Korean food, this is a good mix of southern style BBQ with the twist of Korean BBQ flavors. With food on the somewhat expensive side, had a great time with sharing with 9 other friends for a Friendsgiving dinner which resulted in an inexpensive dinner split evenly with a ton of choices. Definitely worth it with friends."}
{"text":"Fantastic for date night. Drinks are a bit pricy, but the vibe is great and the food is more wild than you'd expect. Huge fan, a great spot for double-dates and out-of-town guests."}
{"text":"4.75 Star Review!

I've been DYING to go to Seoul ever since I found its Instagram page and tonight was finally that night. I ordered the Bao buns, Sweet Potato Hash, Spicy Ram n' Mac, Lychee Soju, and I took on the WHOLE FRIED TILAPIA!!! Everything was AMAZING; however, the Spicy Ram n' mac tasted more like buffalo sauce than a take on mac & cheese. Was tasty, but I was expecting a hometown favorite. 

Now...the tilapia....

THE most tender, juiciest fish I have EVER had in my 25 years of Life!! Honestly, if it weren't for the bones, I would have inhaled the entire thing in one large bite. DEFINITELY recommend, if patient enough to be wary of bones. 

Lychee Soju was great. Came in a personal shaker and didn't initially TASTE strong, but the second I got up, I felt the entire shaker hit at once. VERY tasty, though

If the Ram n' Mac was cheesier, I'd give Seoul a 5-star rating."}
{"text":"Had my birthday celebration here this past weekend and overall it was a good experience.  I loved the manager and our server, both Kevin's, as they were very accommodating and efficient for my party of 35+.  My guests and I definitely enjoyed ourselves on their fun patio and their rock star karaoke room.  Only complaint was that random people who were there were eating from my catered food and the staff there couldn't really do anything about it.  A few times I happen to be out in that area I had to stop people myself from picking at my tables of food.  I understand it could be difficult to keep up with who was in the party and who wasn't so I would do it differently the next time around.  Also the bar staff was super rude, probably the worst I've seen or ever experienced (inside and out on the patio).  Other than that it was a memorable night.  Thank you Seoul Meat Co :)"}
{"text":"Today was my first time at Seoul Food Meat Company and it was good. The service was fast and friendly and our waitress was on time with everything. I ordered the wings which is the best thing on the menu according to everyone that eats here and they did not disappoint. I they only give you a choice of 2 sauces but I got the half and half and both flavors are good. I also ordered some fries but not your typical fries. These fries came loaded and it was ok, not the best in the world but they were ok. Other than that they have a game section outside and a place for pets to play. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great place to go with friends and share small plates. Unique flavors and blend of Asian with southern cuisine. Go hungry as the food is pretty heavy and it's difficult to eat \"light\" there."}
{"text":"I've been dying to go here & OH MY GOD!!! It was beyonnddd my expectations! It's slightly expensive but it was worth every penny... very different and very flavorful!!!!! I'll be back"}
{"text":"This place is always pack. But overall, super friendly staff and fast service. I had their fish tacos and I wasn't disappointed at all. I'll most definitely come back when I'm in town."}
{"text":"The food here was delish! First let me start off and tell you I was amazed by there customer service! They sat us in an area really crowded & loud and then the manager Dave showed up asked if we wanted to move to an area less crowded! Then they told us bc it was after midnight we couldn't get the beef rib, well we did and it was amazing! We had wings, sweet potato birds nest, kim bam, and everything was so good! Even the grapefruit fizz drink I had was refreshing! We will be back because they went out of there way for us and also the food was absolutely amazing!!!"}
{"text":"The wings, The Beer, The Games, The Service!!  It was all sooo Goood!  My buddy brought me in to let me the taste the best wings I've ever had and man he was not wrong.  We split 10 with two different sauces, a garlic sauce and a spicier Thai sauce, I think... They were fantastic!  I think they are lightly battered before being deep fried to crispy perfection!  WoooooooWeeeee.  Pair those up with a couple Juicy C beers and forget about it...game over.  Speaking of games they had some good looking beer pong tables, a soccer style billiards game and corn hole as well.  Place is a good time, great food, good beer, and the staff was great.  Go, I'll see ya there."}
{"text":"I had come to this place a few times because of the tofu wings. It had been recommended by the wait staff multiple times for vegetarians. This last time I had dined there the bartender asked if I was a strict vegetarian and had informed me that the tofu wings are fried in the same oil as the chicken wings. It really bothers me that this is not clearly stated anywhere on the menu and the staff does not bother to say anything about this. I am so very grateful for the bartender that did speak up and let me know. However, I now know there is nothing truly vegetarian friendly here despite what the restaurant says."}
{"text":"Great chicken wings! I love it here the food was amazing. I took away one star because of how small the place is versus the amount of customers they get. I'd alway have to wait for a very long time."}
{"text":"I watched a bartender under poor several groups throughout the night.  Eventually when I ordered a drink from the bar, the same thing happened to me as I watched her make the drink.  I ordered a vodka soda, and when I looked at it, it was entirely carbonated through the drink (unusual for a drink with alcohol in it).  I proceeded to drink it as well as my buddies, almost entirely club soda.  I then asked the bartender to poor me a different drink and confessed that I had witnessed her do the same thing prior to my order.  She proceeded to cry and ask, \"are you calling me a liar?\" -multiple times and as it got very awkward for me, she asked me if she could buy me another drink, I really did not want a drink bought for me on a bartenders tab.  She then went around the bar and proceeded to get more and more angry.  All I wanted was a repour, of a simple drink, and did not want to start any drama.  Then the manager came out and claimed that we called the bartender was racist.  In a nutshell, it all got very odd, over dramatic and uncomfortable very quickly.  I will never come back here, simply because of how inappropriate the staff was over a simple request, and how they proceeded to make the situation a race thing.  Oh my, oh my."}
{"text":"So so food. Drinks were good. Not some place I would like to return to. Service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"This is definitely a most try restaurant in Charlotte. And they make it known that it is NOT a traditional Korean restaurant. The atmosphere and food are great. I was with a large group so the service was acceptable as it was like 15 of us and I don't really feel like we waited too long. The wings, the wings are huge and delicious! Definitely can't go wrong ordering them. The pulled pork taco was too greasy for me to eat. Ramen Mac & Cheese was okay but I wouldn't order it again. The soy pickled deviled eggs where different, if you like deviled eggs get them for the table and give them a try. Sriracha Cracklins are good, how could you go wrong with sriracha fried pork skins but be ready to share because it's a high order. All of The Meats are tasty and a nice serving. All and all the food is reasonably priced so trying a little of everything especially with a group is always fun."}
{"text":"I would eat here everyday if I could. Servers are so friendly and helpful. The food is delicious, hot and fresh. Even when I order things I'd never consider liking or am hesitant about, I end up cleaning my plate. Awesome vibe, fair prices, and just high quality food. Great addition to South End!"}
{"text":"Went to Seoul for the first time on Saturday night. I've heard good things and it definitely did not disappoint. We arrived around 7:30 to get our name on the waiting list. We were meeting friends at 8pm. One thing that was frustrating is that the hostess could not give us an approx. wait time. She did tell us that there were 8 groups of various sizes in front of us, but I have no idea what that means in terms of a potential timeline (she said the same thing to group who came in after us). I was really hungry and kind of wanted to determine whether or not to order an appetizer.

ANYWAY, we were seated about 30 minutes later, which was faster than I was expecting. We ordered the pimento corn cheese. It came out almost immediately and was delicious. It was like pimento cheese but it had a lot of corn in it which added good flavor and texture. It was also served with these rice cakey chips. They were really good and light, which complimented the pimento corn cheese.

I ordered the pulled pork tacos and they were great. The pulled pork had excellent flavor and it was topped with a fusion sauce and cucumbers. Delicious. We also ordered a side of the ram n cheese. It was basically mac n cheese with ramen noodles, and it was SOOOO GOOD. I will definitely order that again.

There are a few reasons I am giving Seoul 4 stars on my first time:

1) There aren't really any healthy menu options - it's all meat and mostly fried sides. Everything I tried was so delicious, but I felt guilty afterwards.
2) It is very loud in there, which is good and bad. It's exciting that so many people are there to enjoy good food and have fun. It was difficult having a conversation at times with our friends.
3) Our waiter brought one check at the end without asking. We were very obviously two couples, so I found it strange that he brought one check and then had to go divide it by couple when we asked. When he brought out the separated checks, they weren't correct so he had to go back and do it a third time. Overall, I just wish he asked how we wanted to split it up before assuming.

Anyway, we will definitely be back to Seoul! This is a hoppin' spot with great food!"}
{"text":"Excellent tacos and kimchi! Love the setup too and friendly service. Sauces and spring rolls were delicious and full of flavor as well. Looking forward to coming back and trying even more things, a perfect place to eat tapas style!"}
{"text":"4.5 stars

OMG why have I not come here before?!? Shame on me. Traditional, no..freaking awesome fusion BBQ, hell yes. Well, the bf decided to hit up Seoul Food after my class ended early yesterday and boy were we glad he did. Outside seating was basically full so we opted to sit at the bar. The bartender was super helpful and explained everything just perfectly. 

I wasn't that hungry so we opted  to share a small fire chicken (about half a pound) with a ram n cheese and bao bun sides (sides are $4 each). Food came out quick. I LOVE THE CHICKEN!!! That was the juiciest chicken I've had in a long time.. The spicy sauce was a good add-on, glad I had some to take home. The bao buns were a good call, make your own sandwiches. Loved this part. I had to dock half a star because the ram n' cheese was super dry...It was a valiant effort in theory, but execution wasn't all there today. Be generous with the cheese sauce, it will only help. And some sambal could be a cool fusion add in. 

We will definitely be back for more, hopefully it was an off day for the ram n cheese because its such a good idea!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and the food is on point!  The only reason this place doesn't get 5 stars is because my most recent visit the service wasn't it's best. They were extremely busy and they are still new so I'm chalking it up to that. The wings are amazing you absolutely need to order those.  Buns are delicious and go with anything you order. 

Keep in mind this is best enjoyed family style. We ordered the tilapia, wings, buns and to top it off the pineapple soju!"}
{"text":"Gimmicky joint with inattentive service. The barbecue isn't Korean and they don't have any Soju. This place is a waste of time. Spend your dollars elsewhere."}
{"text":"Spicy ramen Mac and cheese, broccoli salad, fire chicken...everything we had was so good!!"}
{"text":"This place is really cool. It's different from everything else in Charlotte. The drinks are great, they have a ton of options--and the bartenders really know their stuff. Anytime I can order a beer with a slice of watermelon on the side, I count it as a win! 

The food is amazing, I can't speak highly enough. Really enjoyed everything we tried. I recommend ordering a handful of plates to share with a group.

You can rent out karaoke rooms as well, how cool is that?!"}
{"text":"After grabbing a drink at Unknown, it was 10:00 and we had not yet eaten, so we decided to head to Seoul. We sat down at the bar and were extremely excited to see some amazing craft beers. We hit up the grapefruit shandy and blueberry lager. Thank goodness they had more than just IPAs.

What was even more exciting was the food menu and all the delicious combos we could create. We settled on the small plate of the pulled pork BBQ and spicy smoked chicken ($9 each), two orders of the bao buns and the Raeman Mac N' Cheese. 

When the food came out there were two huge lumps of mouth watering meats, steamed buns, sides of both sauces and the Raeman. From the time the food came out until the time we got our bill, we were trying to figure out if they mistakingly gave us the large order...it was huge!

Needless to say when the bill came they did in fact give us the small platter (an unbelievable price for such amazingly tasty meat).

The chicken was extremely spicy without even dipping it into the extra sauce, but was incredible as was the flavorful pulled pork and the buns were a perfect soft
texture. The one thing I could do without was the Mac and cheese, which wasn't great and could have been cheesier; seemed a little watered down.

However we will absolutely be back here for the service, great selection of beer and incredible meat!"}
{"text":"Love it. Awesome. Always good. Prices fair. Food quality great. Service is solid. Ways can be long but that happens at a good place like this"}
{"text":"Short version: Will not be dining there again, bad service, disrespectful unprofessional manager GM David, inexperienced serving staff, and paper plates ANNOYING!!!

Long version: GM David called us liars when we questioned the refill price which was +5 bucks more than what we ever paid. It was a valid question and our +4th time there as a group. What was worse was the fact that in hearing distance from us he had the nerve tell the waitress we were trying to take advantage... It was a valid question and really we didn't mind to pay but the unprofessional demeanor and his accusatory tone set us off. GM David:  Pick your battles wisely because your resturant is now on our no-go list."}
{"text":"I don't normally leave reviews - places have bad days but this was bad. 

There were 4 of us, we got seated quickly. Great. 

We ordered a bunch of things off the menu: soy garlic wings, bulgogi taco, kimchi pork taco, pulled pork taco, fried fish taco, Mac and cheese ramen, pork belly, dirty rice, kimchi loaded fries, kim Bap bulgogi.  In addition to some alcohol. 

The wings we good. Really crunchy, good flavor. IT WENT DOWN HILL FROM HERE. 

The rest of the food came out - the only good was the bulgogi tacos. The rest was either flavorless or cold. We left 90% of the food on the table. 

The waitress didn't even come out to check on us after the food came out. It was about 20+ minutes before she came to ask how the food was. We asked for the check and when she asked if we wanted the food boxed we said no, it wasn't great and told her it was flavorless and cold. 

I am SOOO SURPRISED manager didn't come over to talk to us. We just saw the server talking to her and them looking at us. Most of this could have been solved if the manager came to talk to us.

We paid the check and walked out the door. All 4 of us completed dissatisfied.  Never coming back."}
{"text":"Dude, I read the reviews before coming here and was looking to make my own opinion. you people are wack, THIS PLACE IS AMAZING. Get the Soy Glaze wings, 1,000,000 of them. beer selection is awesome. sides are all wonderful. I'm so happy to have this place around. no healthy options, but heck, it's the south."}
{"text":"I would give this place 5 stars im only giving it 4 stars for the simple fact we didn't eat here we simply came here for the drinks! Best way to describe this place is fun! fun! and more fun! Myself and one of my other friends went in $10 each and purchased the all you can drink mimosas the bartender brings out a bottle of champagne and you mix it up yourself from their mimosa bar its a do it yourself bar really cool idea. My other friend purchased the pineapple soju drink its a   pineapple where you swoop your drink out wit a utensil that comes with the pineapple. They have alot of cool drinks here with the smoke coming out of the drinks etc.. One of my friends mentioned i never been anywhere where i complain to myself we have to much to drink lol we definetly got a great bang for our buck.

This is not your traditional korean restaurant  i didn't expect to have as much fun as we did. This is a great place especially while the weather is still warm outside to go with a group of friends.In the back they have a great open space patio with adult games out side such as jenga and connect four. We were like big over grown kids outside playing while drinking. I also especially love the open window bar space in the bar in the inside as well its inside but its outside if that makes sense. If you are looking for a non traditional korean restaurant come and get the great experience me and my friends did here at Seoul!"}
{"text":"Located literally steps from my temporary South End apartment, I knew I had to visit Seoul Food as soon as I saw the sign. In the brief weekend we moved in, we ate at Seoul Food twice and I can't wait to go back to try more. 

Packed at both 8pm and 11pm, both experiences were memorable -- having now ordered the soy garlic wings, pork ribs, broccoli, and Kim-chili mac, I'd definitely continue to stick with the meats and try out different sides. Broccoli was just broccoli with a spicy sauce, and the Kim-chili mac reminded me of Cincinnati chili too much for me to actually enjoy it. On the other hand, both the pork ribs and the wings were incredible.

The bar/restaurant's environment is lively and fun -- we walked by several times and it was never not busy. I'm absolutely looking forward to ordering the soju on my next visit -- each of the ways to drink it were creative, silly, and made for groups. 

Will definitely come back and bring others."}
{"text":"Love this place....I'm not a big wing guy but this is the only place in Charlotte that I go to specifcly for the wings and of course the crispy pork belly and I have yet to be disappointed. The bar games make it a great place for a group to get together as is the small dog park they have. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Seoul Food was great! I'm very glad we made the effort to stop by (even though I think it is a little pricy, and the waitress was rushing us). 

Parking is a little tricky, as that area--although new--appears to get busy in the evenings. We had a moderate wait for a table as well, it is was very popular that night. 

What I really liked about this place is that it appeals to a variety of people. I saw young people, old people, people from a variety of walks of life--I like that. And that's a good sign the food is good. And it was! Even my dinner companion loved the food--which is a big feat because he normally doesn't enjoy Asian food. The flavors were strong, and it the food was unique. Definitely stop by!"}
{"text":"Very unique concept! We ordered the spicy wings to start, with great cocktails.The wings were very large, very crispy and puffy, mildly spicy and very tasty. Finger licking yummy. These should not be missed.  For our main courses, we ordered the fire chicken and the beef ribs with potato salad, kimche and ramen mac and cheese side dishes. Both main courses and the three sides were served on a single platter. Everything was delicious."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great service. Portions were HUGE!!!!! Great atmosphere and great people making delicious food. It's was odd thinking mixing Korean food with American BBQ but I believe they stuck with tradition but did not reject innovation. ¯\_(?)_/¯"}
{"text":"The drink selection is great and food is tasty! Definitely give the Yogurt soju a try and the Lychee soju is just as delicious. Service is great, the staff is always so friendly. Will come back!"}
{"text":"Service was great! Food was excellent! It's a great spot to hang out, eat, & drink with friends! Totally recommend !!!!"}
{"text":"Wings were amazing. Thin crispy outside and super juicy inside. We had the soy garlic...yummm!"}
{"text":"Wings were seriously amazing. We are only in Charlotte for one night but considering eating this place again later."}
{"text":"Great wings.   Service getting better.  Very popular."}
{"text":"The portions are pretty big, try the sweet potato nest. Ram n cheese and fire chicken are not worth the hype."}
{"text":"Beef Rib is amazing! The size of the Rib itself was shocking! Literally falling off the bone! Also ordered the wings, let's just say definitely not your average wings. Everything is grade A. Very impressed and will definitely be returning for more! If I had to complain it would be no ranch or blue cheese with wings. But however I understand they are trying to keep it as authentic as possible, as were the simple minded wouldn't. However overall highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Conflicted in this review. Went there yesterday, on a Sunday evening. First impression was more confused than anything else. Had a tent set up with some outdoor games, TONS of people (almost all twenty somethings). Everyone was having a great time. Went inside, was solo and the only option given to me was to sit at the bar, which was completely packed. So I manage to squeeze myself in. Two people working the bar, had to wait about 5 minutes to see a menu, another 5 to order. Ordered the small order of brisket as well as the sriracha cracklings. Waited about 10 minutes for the cracklings, another 10 for the brisket. 

The good? The food was delicious. The cracklings were fresh, seasoned pretty good, nice and spicy. The brisket was delicious, cooked pretty well (although little to no smoke ring) and came partially sauced with more sauce on the side, as well as a little bit of Korean pickles I believe. 

The bad? I was sick all night. I am the last person to ever blame being ill on a specific meal or restaurant. However, this was the only thing I ate that day, I felt great before hand, and the problems I had when I got back to my hotel were gastrointestinal and in more than one way. 

Would I give them a second try if I found myself in the area? Maybe. I like the concept, I love their take on Korean food, and the food tasted good. However, the prices were a bit high, and I probably would have passed if I had known beforehand that the atmosphere was more frat house party than dining establishment. Also the part where I made 12 trips to the bathroom afterwards. If you're looking to party and get some food to soak up the booze, this is the place. If you are just looking to get some food, keep this in mind."}
{"text":"We had a very similar experience to what others have mentioned here. We had such high hopes for this place and were there celebrating a new job. I will need time and distance before I can go back for the only good thing we ate, which is the wings. Much of the menu was crossed off (which I can appreciate to a degree, if you can't serve it right, don't serve it). The waitress suggested we order a large of almost everything-which was hugely misleading on how these giant portions would come out. After getting sick, we threw most of the $90 meal away. Pulled pork, pork belly, and corn cheese dip, bao buns, were all pretty bad. The kimchi slaw was ok but the only \"veggie\" available. The meal made my wife and I very sick. The worst part, the restaurant had mostly empty tables and we were rushed out of there-like in and out in less than 60 minutes. Our waitress (who was nice but not really great) offered to go boxes less than 10 minutes after we got our food, and other servers were hovering the entire time and were coming by our table many times taking plates we were eating off of. Asking us if we were done. Really rude. Also had an $11 old fashioned and it tasted like water. Rough start guys. Hope you can get it together and stay."}
{"text":"I've been to this place a few times.. and overall, my experiences were phenomenal! The food is delicious as always and the service was fast. I always recommend this place to my friends because it's a great place to come in groups- because you can share the food. I'm glad we have a place like this in Charlotte! It's a must try."}
{"text":"Last night was my second time eating here. The first experience I was impressed by all 4 of the tacos and the fire chicken. However, last night the food was plain awful. There were 3 people in our group and none of us enjoyed the meal or even finished it. Honestly disappointed by the quality vs price. 3 stars because I'm conflicted on ever going back. Hit or miss"}
{"text":"I really love Korean food so I may be too picky but after going here twice, I did not like this place.  The menu items are titled well but don't live up to the name. Ramen Mac and cheese seems like it should be something amazing but it's ramen with cafeteria cheese on top.  The Kim chi sausage is bland and the guys at our table had fun coming up with analogies as to how dry it was (it's so post-apocalyptic wasteland it could win 6 oscars).  The sweet potato nest is sticky gooey and falls apart easily, making it hard to eat.  The chicken wings are breaded heavily and very sticky also.  

The pulled pork and beef ribs are decent as is the Kim chi slaw and potato swirl.  The pimento cheese isn't bad either.  But honestly this restaurant is in south end; if you want great chicken wings, tavern on the tracks is up the road.  If you want pulled pork, you can check out saucemans or macs.  And if you're hankering for some good Asian fare, you're better off going to futo buta, nikkos, or ru sans.  The dishes that should differentiate this place from other restaurants are boring and bad and the dishes they do acceptably can be done better by nearby restaurants so unless one of those are too busy, I'd suggest going there."}
{"text":"Still going with my first review. We have been back a handful of time since the review. It's such a great spot for food and fun. Soy garlic chicken and crispy pork belly hands down. Oh and they are sure not your typical Korean BBQ."}
{"text":"Excellent food - wings crispy, yummy pork belly , sriracha cracklins, pimento corn cheese, ramen mac n cheese and fire chicken. Happy hour specials all sides are 1$ each"}
{"text":"On my second visit to Seoul, the wings were just a great as I remembered. Last time I tried the ramen Mac as a side. It was good enough for something to have one time, just to say you tried it. I chose a potato swirl this time. Lots of flavor and seasoning. It came with spicy mayo on the side if your taste calls for dipping sauce. 

I tried a cocktail this trip, a Lychee-Tini with my choice of Tito's vodka. I enjoyed the balance of flavor. You could taste the alcohol, but not an overbearing taste, and the lychee added some delicate sweetness.

Our server, Dylan, was absolutely wonderful. If you haven't been here yet- make some plans."}
