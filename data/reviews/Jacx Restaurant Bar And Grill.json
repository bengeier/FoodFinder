{"text":"Friendly staff, restaurant is quite clean and up to date. Had their pizza a couple times to go, it's quite good and has a homemade quality to it. Also been there for the brunch buffet on weekends. It's not the largest buffet but the food is well done and is a mix of breakfast and lunch items as well as continental. They open a little late on weekends so check the hours before you go."}
{"text":"What a fabulous restaurant! Although a bit out of the way, the food, service and ambiance are fantastic! They have a great menu that's sure to please a range of people, including great pastas and curries. They also have daily specials.

This is quickly becoming my Friday evening destination!"}
{"text":"Need a big fix of meatloaf? Here's your place!  Out in the middle of nowhere (since the 404 extended to the 'wick, Woodbine Ave is now nowhere) you can find Jacx next door to Brice's Furniture.  I stopped in with a couple of associates in the early afternoon on a Saturday for a late lunch.  The place was fairly empty, and the staff was busy putting together the Christmas decorations. This might be why service was rather slow at an otherwise quiet time.  Fortunately I was not in a rush.

The menu is filled with a seriously diverse selection.  Linguini with Seafood?  On it.  Liver and Onions?  On it.  Curry of the Day??  ..On it...  The decision was tough.  Normally I would have had the Seafood Linguini since that is a pretty strenuous test of a restaurant,but I was not wanting the carbs.  I settled on the Meat Loaf, served with Mushroom Gravy, potatoes and veggies.

The plate arrived with a load of meatloaf, two thick hunks, slathered in gravy.  I had the roasted potatoes with it.  The meatloaf was thick, moist, tender, and loaded with flavour.  Overall, a great feed, and worth the wait.

For desert, I tried the Caramel Chocolate Cake, which is a La Rocca product.  Who doesn't like La Rocca cakes?"}
