{"text":"What can I say... This restaurant is amazing! Went for lunch and received the best customer service. I had the order of chile verde chilaquiles w/ rice and beans; they were delicious! Their salsa for the chips was so addicting, I could not stop eating it! We also tried their pollo asado and it was really well seasoned and tasty. I definitely recommend this place, I know this will be one of those places I visit often for lunch. They also serve breakfast which I have not tried, but will soon."}
{"text":"Yum!  This place is a gem.  It's in a tiny house on the south side of McDowell.  Parking is in front of the building next door.  We were the only customers for most of the time we were there.  I hope that changes, because this place deserves to succeed.

It's homey inside, with mid-matched tables and chairs.  Service was prompt.  My friend and I ordered melon aguas frescas, which were light and refreshing.  I ordered the chile relleno.  My friend ordered the enchiladas.  Another friend who joined us mid-meal ordered carne asada tacos.

The food was authentic and fantastic!  My plate was huge and full.  The chile was a fat poblano.  It was cheesy and was served with crema atop it.  The rice DID NOT have carrots and peas added; thank you very much.  It was topped with a modest amount of melted cheese...just enough to add interest. The beans were delicious, and were garnished with queso fresco.  I do not normally eat breads, but when a basket of fresh tortillas arrived, still steaming, I had two of them.  I could not finish my meal. So much food.

My friend's tacos were street tacos on a long tray, garnished with slices of fresh cucumber and lime.  The server brought her sauce and told her it was very hot.  She agreed that it was.  Her tacos looked fantastic!

This place is near my office, so I really really hope they succeed!"}
{"text":"Friend and I had lunch here today.  Service was not that good.  When food was brought out, order was not correct.  Very bland tasting food, nothing special about it.   The chicken was very grisely and have a few pieces of bone in it.   My friend said that made it authentic.  I said it made it bad!  Don't want to throw this place under the bus, but  will not be going back."}
{"text":"Came here on Saturday to try the chicharron gordita and I have to say it was delicious.  I also ordered a chichen huarache and had Jamaica water with it.  My husband had the birria and he said it was the best he's had in a while.  When we first walked in the place was empty because we didn't realize that they close at 6 pm.  The place is a very humble restaurant.  No fancy decorations indide or out.  It's in a rougher area of Phoenix but I would totally return."}
{"text":"I do some shopping at a couple of local restaurant supply places in the area and decided to swing into this unassuming, small place on the south side of the road. The exterior signs touting al pastor, birria de chivo and chili rellenos sucked me in. 

On my first visit, I went for the staples of a carne asada taco an al pastor taco and a pork chicharon gordita. The carne asada was solid, not the best in town but solid. I really like it when it is grilled over charcoal or wood but kitchen logistics as they are I understand the reason why places don't do it. The seasoning was good and it came with a nice soft corn tortilla. The al pastor was pretty stinking good. Great seasoning, just the right amount of pineapple and the same corn tortilla with a little diced onion and cilantro. My favorite of the day was the pork chicharron gordita. It was really really good and I have a feeling it's going to be one of those things I just crave every couple of weeks.

For my second visit, I decided to give the chili relleno a try and it was nicely fried, the chili wasn't soft and mushy but rather had an al dente bite to it. Plenty of cheese, fried well without being greasy and all around a really good relleno. I also had another al pastor taco and it was better than the first time. The seasoning was a hair away from perfect in my non expert al pastor opinion. It was cold and windy out so hey, let's also try the birria de chivo. It came with house made tortillas (amazing), diced onion, cilantro and lime. It hit the spot and if you are new to goat this will have you craving more.

I talked with the chef a little and he spent a really long time (10+) years working with Matt Carter over at The Mission in Scottsdale. Omar knows what he is doing. He decided to pursue his dream and open his own little spot and he is making small additions as he goes. He showed me his trompo and he is hopefully going to get it in action soon after a couple of logistical issues are figured out."}
