{"text":"Brunch here was great. Laid back, good food, Bloody Mary bar - what more could you want after a weekend on the town."}
{"text":"Great food, service was a little slow but everyone was friendly. Lamb sausage burger was out of this world"}
{"text":"One of our favorite local places to get burgers! Fantastic service and a very cool environment."}
{"text":"Benjamin's is one of my favorite burger places ever (and I'm a vegetarian!).  My husband and I love the atmosphere, service, and most of all the food.  The veggie burger is real - not a store bought frozen patty, but real and you have amazing toppings to choose from!  My husband always switches up his choice, but we have never had a bad meal there - also their side dishes are fantastic.  Typical sides, with a little bit of a twist."}
{"text":"Starting with the positive, the food was delicious, and the decor was very pleasant (as others have mentioned below).  The front window was open, so we enjoyed a nice open air dining experience while dining inside.  We enjoyed the charcuterie very much as an appetizer and each one of our four dishes were delicious.

While our server was nice, I was very disappointed in the length of time it took for our food to arrive.  From sitting down, it took approx. 45 minutes for our entrees, and there was only one other table in the place!  For it being that empty, I would have expected much quicker service.  

Also, for the classy casual vibe that the restaurant is trying to cultivate, it was very disruptive to have two children running around shrieking and climbing on things.  I don't know if they were an employee's or the owner's, but it was a very annoying addition to our meal.  I'm a big proponent of trying to let an establishment know of a problem in case they can fix it before I take it to the internet to complain, but how do you ask them to please take their children elsewhere?"}
{"text":"I love this place.  The atmosphere is great the burgers and cheese plates are great.  I believe there's a good happy hour.    No complaints we live within walking distance and this is our favorite place to visit."}
{"text":"I finally checked this place out.  I'm giving it 3 1/2 stars mostly on potential.  They seem to be addressing previous complaints placed on yelp.  The bar is well stocked, great beer selection, and my burger was great.  It was under cooked but the staff addressed it and I got a new burger ASAP.  The atmosphere is very chill. Great place to relax, even a good date location.  I want this place to succeed.  Honestly I don't understand the complaints about the prices.  If you want a shitty cheap burger go to McDonalds."}
{"text":"Ordered the goat cheese and apple burger and it was yummy. A little under cooked, but still delicious. Great customer service, they were willing to seat our large party in the lounge area."}
{"text":"Saw an ad in the city paper, and well, the burger people in us just had to check it out. The place is small, with a modern minimalist style. I got the rosemary balsamic goat cheese burger with apples...DEVINE, my friend got the BBQ burger, which was also quite delicious. The burger patties alone were tasty...their grill must be amazingly seasoned! I have a mean appetite, so in saying that I still felt slightly hungry when done...an appetizer would have hit the spot. I only gave it 4 stars tho because the service was under par...straight to the point, no friendly hellos...will try again because luckily the burgers make up for the lack-luster service."}
{"text":"The vegan burger is amazing but the service is horrible!!!! I have returned so many times, hoping for change.  Sadly, I will have to forego the amazing burger - it's not worth the rotten mood that accompanies the poor service."}
{"text":"Yes. The burgers surpass any others in this city. But the Shrimp & Grits...the finest by far north of Charleston SC. And Sangria. And Bloody Mary bar. And Bourbons. Just come here."}
{"text":"Before eating here, I always thought \"a burger's a burger.\"  However, I stopped into Benjamins Western Avenue Burger Bar while traveling and I was quickly proven wrong!  I ordered the \"My Morning Burger,\" and absolutely loved it!  The food was great, the service was friendly, and the atmosphere in the restaurant was relaxing.  If I'm ever back in the area, I will definitely be revisiting."}
{"text":"Entertainment for the taste Budds!!  Great atmosphere & great burgers. I had the goat cheese, green apple, burger & it was the best ,cooked the way I liked it. Cole slaw was great!!  Bryan's burger was the Benjamin's burger cooked to perfection with crispy home fries in a cozy intimate setting music low enough to converse over. Very friendly staff in a clean environment!!  Muted lighting for a great atmosphere! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Small bar and three other areas - tables in front room, tables outside and a back room with a pool table. Good craft beer options on tap and in bottles. Great bourbon selection. The veggie burger is a little different - sweet potato and chick peas but I liked it. The home fries are good too, but the best part of my lunch was the wasabi broccoli salad. It tasted like a broccoli sushi roll. I really like the two large widows in the front - lets a lot of light in and makes for an open air room when weather permits."}
{"text":"Really good burgers.  Candied jalape√±o burger was very simple but very flavorful, just the right amount of heat.  Wife had apple burger, also top notch.  Home fries were amazing.  Top 5 burger places in the city."}
{"text":"Food is scrumptious. Portions are small. Service is hit or miss. The menu items are beautifully written and I guess that is what you pay for. The hype. It is overpriced. The food and the drinks could use a bit of generosity."}
{"text":"Good food, not so good service.

My boyfriend & I went on a Friday night, so we expected them to be pretty busy. We were greeted right away & were told there was a wait. However, a table opened up a few minutes later, the table was cleaned & we were seated promptly. The gentleman (who I believe was a bartender/bar back), that seated us brought us water & said our waitress would be over shortly. Well, about 20 minutes later, our server, REBECCA, hadn't greeted us until I flagged her down. She took our order & that was the last we'd see of her until she brought our bill, which we had to again, flag her down for. Another waitress brought our food & our waitress, didn't come to check on us once. The same gentleman that seated us cleared our plates. He and the food were probably the only positive part of the experience. Doubt we'll go back."}
{"text":"I am excited to report a drastic improvement at Benjamins.  I have had several fantastic burgers since my initial review.  I will say that despite their best efforts, the smell is still there.  I wish they would install a proper hood.  Other than that I would recommend a visit!"}
{"text":"We spent the weekend in Pittsburgh, and this was by far the best food of our trip!  Cool atmosphere, delicious food."}
{"text":"Aka Bier's Pub... This is a great local spot. Their gourmet burgers are fantastic.  If you enjoy goat cheese get the goat cheese and apple burger.  We will be duplicating this burger at home.  

The BBQ burger is good,  tip... add the cole slaw for some zest. 


Definitely hit this spot of you're I  the north side of Pittsburgh.  Friendly staff and great ambiance."}
{"text":"Beautiful burgers here to compliment the Sierra Nevada Pale Ale
Good service and knowledgable too"}
{"text":"My experience here was not memorable for any good reasons. In fact, the oven was apparently broken when we arrived, and despite the fact that it took them almost an hour to fix it, the free appetizers we were promised did not appear for at least half an hour, either. Our waitress was nice, but I'm pretty sure she brought me the wrong beer.

This aside, my salmon sandwich with brie was exactly that - a few slices of very smokey salmon and three chunks of brie. I'm not a chef by any means, but how much talent does that really take?? In addition, my side of tomato-basil pesto pasta salad, which I'm sure you're thinking sounds yummy, was really bland.

The best part of the experience was the outdoor seating on the deck, but I was glad I wasn't at one of the tables crammed down in the alley. This out-of-towner was not impressed."}
{"text":"Burgers. They are my soulmate. My one true love. If I could eat a burger every day, I would. So when I find a burger I've yet to try I can't help but succumb to its meaty ways.

The menu features burgers (duh) and a few sandwiches, salads, and starters. Naturally when I go to a place that refers to itself as a \"burger bar\" I get a salad. Just kidding. I got the Top Shelf Cheese burger which is a single burger with lettuce, tomato, onion, and your choice of blue, brie, or cheddar cheese. I went with blue cheese because it is the ultimate. The burger was delightful. Seriously. It was a blend of sirloin, brisket, and short rib. I'm a firm believer that you don't need to do a blend if you have quality ground chuck but this blend was flavorful, moist, and overall cooked to my specific temperature requirements aka medium.

The sides that accompany the burgers and sandwiches could use a little work. My broccoli was ok as was the pasta salad and home fries. If Benjamin's steps up it's side game it will have a really great burger combo on its hands.

And for all you gluten free people, Benjamin's offers gluten free buns!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite burger places. Their goatcheese and apple burger and different but still delicious. The only reason I gave them a 4 instead of a 5 is because they don't have fries. What kind of burger joint doesn't have fries?!"}
{"text":"I think its got to be the best place for a burger in the burg......"}
{"text":"Benjamin's is a great place to grab a burger and a beer after work. Their happy hour deals run until 6:30 and they include half off apps and a different special every day. Tuesday they have a burger, beer, and a shot for $11.95. For $1.50 you can upgrade from their classic burger to any burger on the menu. Cheap yuengling drafts and great service as well. 

I almost always go with the candied jalape√±o burger which has some kick and it always hits the spot. The jalape√±o cream cheese on the burger makes it. The bacon fat home fries are the way to go with the sides, as their other ones really don't give you too much. 

You can't beat the cheese board and meat board for snacking during happy hour, oh and the pretzels come with jalape√±o cream cheese to dip.

 I really like this spot, definitely a go to for HH in the North side!"}
{"text":"I have tried so hard to like this place given its proximity to my house, but I just can't. While the burgers themselves are fine (though $$$$), everything else is terrible, from the sides to the other sandwiches to the smoked salmon (I suppose the charcuterie plate is just OK as well).

Beyond the food, the service is usually downright rude, the inside of the place is just bizarre, the bathroom is always disgusting and usually out of toilet paper, the ventilation is terrible so you'll smell like a burger when you leave, and it's so expensive for what it is. 

Again, I've wanted to like this place and have been here quite a few times, but I regret it every time I step foot in there."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my burger with the truffle mustard, and romaine lettuce with salsa and balsamic vinaigrette dressing. Plus they had Anderson Valley's Winter Solstice (bottle) to accompany it.  I walked out smelling like a deep fryer, but it was completely worth it."}
{"text":"BEST Burger I have had in a long time.  I travel a lot and eat in a lit of places across the country but this one is a favorite..."}
{"text":"I ordered one of the burgers that you can pick the kind of cheese you would like to have on it. I chose bree. I got a side of home fries and a bloody maria as a drink. I had to explanation what that (my drink) was to the waitress which was slightly difficult conciderring the high volume of the music. It was 2 pm they already had the music up almost to club/bar volume. The drink was like 9 dollars and my burger was around 10 pretty expensive for a greasy lunch for one person. I had a craving for a greasy burger and that's what I got. If your into that kind of thing go for it. I like that they have a pool table as well."}
{"text":"Went here for Saturday brunch. They have a great brunch menu and a make your own bloody mary bar. I ordered a breakfast item, but one of my friends had a burger and loved it! We were able to sit outside, and it was lovely. I can't wait to come back here and order a burger! The menu has sooooo many that sound delicious. 

The service wasn't spectacular by any means, but it was fine. The interior of the restaurant looked nice, but we sat outside so I can't really comment on it."}
{"text":"Atmosphere and service were great!!  Good selection of drafts and cider with happy hour specials. I had the veggie burger with green apple and my love...aka goat cheese. The patty was fresh with wonderful flavor and the toppings went great together. The side of cole slaw was very tasty but a bit on the small side. Will definitely return when the weather is warmer and the store front opens up to the outside!"}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place. Good beer selection, great service, and excellent burgers! We try to go here every time we come to Pittsburgh. Plus, this place is pretty close to the stadiums, so it's a good place to grab a meal and drink before a game."}
{"text":"Best veggie burger you'll ever have, and the sweet onion bisque is to die for! Also gluten free friendly!"}
{"text":"Great choice before seeing a show on the North Shore, and probably smarter than trying to get into Burgatory or one of the other places near the stadiums and Stage AE.
We made it in time for happy hour, and they had solid specials going on. We tried the cured meat plate (half-off appetizers). Good selection (included some giant homemade pickles), and enough for 2-4 people to snack on. Draft beers were also $2 off. Our server was pleasant and attentive. 

The burger by itself was good. A thinner patty than say, Tessaro's, but I don't think that's a bad thing. . . I was able to finish most of the burger. They grind their meat in house. I managed to find a little bite that wasn't smothered in candied jalapeno cream cheese and bacon, and the patty was really flavorful. I think their fancy pants cheese burger would be great because you'd get to taste the actual burger patty with fewer toppings. 
Fellow reviewers did not steer me wrong. The candied jalapeno burger was very tasty . . . well-cooked bacon and, oh man!, that jalapeno cream cheese! It had a little bit of a spicy bite, but definitely not overwhelming. I'm going to have a hard time convincing myself to try other burgers when I go back. Also, the home fries . . . really good with some poblano peppers and onions, crispy but not burnt. I eat a lot of potatoes, and this is how I like my home fries.

First time at Benjamin's - will visit again!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the best burgers I've ever had!!! Yum! Had the candied jalape√±o burger with home fries. The burger was excellent and the home fries were delicious. I will probably come back for more."}
{"text":"Infused vodkas and a make your own bloody mary bar  make this place a must stop for a Sunday brunch.  The hangover helper is beyond awesome.  Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Their burgers are amazing -- from the patty itself to the toppings. My personal favorite is the goat cheese and apple. They have great choices for sides too, although I've only ever gotten the home fries so far. The atmosphere is great and the staff are friendly. 5 stars all around!"}
{"text":"Excited to try Benjamin's Western Avenue Burger Bar..  I ventured out in the steady downpour today.. It was about 11:45 so there was plenty of parking.  What a cool little place!  The bartender was friendly and took my to-go order. The menu has a lot to choose from..  it was tough to choose. I love burgers~!  I went with the \"Buffalo Blue\" Burger (Buffalo Sauce, Blue Cheese, Romaine Lettuce) well I must say \"it was a mighty tasty burger\".  You can tell it was good beef and real blue cheese crumbles.  The burger was juicy and quite delicious.  I was surprised that \"French fries\" weren't on the menu.  They are just such a great accompaniment to a burger (American girl always).   

Sides include: Bacon Fat Home Fries, Sundried Tomato Pesto Pasta Salad, Curried Cabbage Cole Slaw, Potato Salad or Broccoli Salad.  

Bunch on Sunday 10:30 - a.m. - 9:00 p.m. brunch menu & build your own Bloody Mary bar available until 3pm.  Theres a small dining room area - bar and a jukebox! !   I love that!  There is outside seating (weather permitting).  I bet they have a great happy hour.. I cant wait to go back! 

Nice draft beer selection.. always rotating.. that's cool.   My meal was $10.95 - burger plus a side - a little above average.. but was it worth it? YES"}
{"text":"Benjamin's is awesome! First off I must say the food is pretty good. The jalape√±o creme cheese burger is one of the best around. Sometimes service can be iffy tho when there is a crowd but they manage to do a good job. They have no kitchen but they do have a tiny grill at the end of the bar. This will surely slow the process of cooking many meals at once. This is a good place to go when you aren't in a hurry and don't want the same old food. I would recommend Benjamin's for happy hour or a lazy Sunday lunch or dinner. They have some great daily (happy hour) specials so be sure to call and ask!"}
{"text":"Was there for Sunday brunch, was excellent!! Very good food!! Even though kitchen was slow, short a cook, it was worth the wait!"}
{"text":"After reading about this place I was eager to try it. It's located in the Mexican War Streets in the Northside which is right down the street from where I live. I called in a take out order since I didn't have time for a full sit down meal. The person who answered the phone was friendly and helpful. I ordered the soft pretzels with truffle mustard and the rosemary goat cheese and green apple burger with a side of home fries. When I went in, my order was ready to go which I appreciated.  Like others have said, all the food seems to be cooked at a flat top at the end of the bar which is weird. The pretzels were nothing special but the truffle mustard was delicious and flavorful. The burger was juicy and the goat cheese was melted over it with the apples cut into match sticks. I ordered the burger medium well and it was just that. The burger was great. The home fries were run of the mill and like a lot of other posters I can say their side dish menu is lacking. They should invest in a fryer and offer some french fries or other options. Overall my first experience with Benjamins was positive and I would definitely try it again!"}
{"text":"I have been to Benjamins twice. Both times just for drinks, so cannot comment on the food. 

What I did experience was bad service. The first time the bartender was more interested in socializing then bringing over the drinks.  Second time, it was not the severs fault the service was bad, she was the only one serving an increasingly busy place for Sunday brunch. What annoyed me was the owner just watched her sweat and did not step in to help out. 

Would not suggest the Manhattan."}
{"text":"This is my follow up to the letter i wrote to the owner last week. They claim they serve food until 1030pm. What really happens is the waitresses begin to lift all of the chairs on the table to mop the floors so they can go home. The bartenders are banging glasses and bottles in order to clean up for the day. They have no respect for the few patrons. This has happened to us more that once at this establishment. My party could not believe the rudeness and disrespect towards the patrons on Sat night. We will never step foot in this place again. There are too many professional restaurants in the north side to patronize."}
{"text":"I was craving a burger and had been looking to try, so I ordered take-out. Ordered 'fancy pants' with Manchego. They forgot the fancy. No braised onions or truffle mustard. Luckily I had Target Dijon in the fridge. The meat was very good. No cutlery,  which you need for the home fries. Luckily I had a fork at home. My husband is going to be pissed when he sees $37 for 2 burgers and desert and I can't even shoosh him with my enthusiasm."}
{"text":"I would give this place 6 stars for the beer and 3 for the food (we had) thus the 4.  BUT my wife and I went back for drinks a second night.

The place has a great selection of craft beers.  The bartender gave some good suggestions and I ended up with a nice flight (the first night).  All the flavors I had were wonderful.

The cheese and meat plate we ordered was just OK but I felt bad as we left a lot of the toppings on the plate.  They needed to add more bread/crackers and make it bread that isn't so hard.

The second night we went back we sat at the bar and split a pulled pork.  The sandwich was much better this night.  The best was learning about a new brew available, Redrum, and meeting the brewer himself.  In fact, I enjoyed it I bought a 6 pack and now have it at home.

The beer, the staff, and the people could easily make this a local hangout for me if I lived in the area. I feel they are just shy of 5 stars due to the food.  I would be there nightly having another flavor or two.  

They have live music too.  I wish they didn't pipe it in so loud in to the main area so conversations didn't have to be yelling matches.  If you want the music louder just go upstairs. Leave it as background for the main bar area.

If  I lived there I would easily say \"I'll be back soon\"!"}
{"text":"I was hesitant to try this place as I did not know what to expect. As soon as I walked in I loved it.  They have outdoor and indoor seating with brick interior that makes it feel cozy.  We went for brunch and started on the back patio however the weather did not hold out and we found ourselves inside shortly after.  Our waiter seemed a little off that day and confused about menu items although I think he was just helping out.  They had a blood Mary bar which I would recommend if you like these drinks.  For my entr√©e I went with the BLT-bacon, lettuce, tomato, and fried egg. It was supposed to be served with fruit but came with potatoes. The sandwich was delicious. I would have preferred fruit but the potatoes were very tasty. What amazes me about this place is they have one tiny stove that they cook most meals on one at a time.  The only disappointment was someone in our party ordered the crab eggs benedict. They forgot her ordered and she was served after we all finished eating and did not like the crab. The restaurant more than made up for this by brining her out a side of potatoes right away and serving us 2 bread pudding desserts-these were delicious and served warm with ice cream.  The owner also came out and apologized and asked for suggestions for improvement.  Overall I would skip brunch and go back for a burger and $3 Sangrias they have on Fridays."}
{"text":"Been wanting to come here for awhile to try it out, today I came and we sat outside. Really cool Pittsburgh atmosphere! And the food was better than expected! I hear they are known for their burgers and I can see why! I started with a Caesar salad, which was very good, and also way bigger than expected for the price. Then I had the candied jalapeno burger and it was AMAZING! Definitely adding this to my list of favorite local spots!!!"}
{"text":"After attending Yelp's Burger Bonanza @ Benjamin's I had to go back for an encore.

Being that it was my daughter's birthday and that she loves burgers as much as I do I figured that, that was as good a time as any to make a return visit.

Upon entering we were greeted and quickly seated in a booth next to the bar.

The wife and daughter both got a cream soda and I got a Coke. We started off with the Shrimp and Grits for our appetizer. (Byrd's Mill organic corn grits, habanero cheddar cheese, brown sugar and butter.) My daughter doesn't even like grits but, she loved these.

My wife and I both went with the Candied Jalapeno burger with pickles and lettuce and tomato and the birthday girl ordered a bbq, bacon cheese burger with lettuce and tomato. We patiently sat and watched in excitement as our Bacon Fat Home Fries (onions & poblano peppers) were being cooked next to the bar.

It was like Christmas morning as our burgers were brought all at once to our table. I am so glad I went with the Candied Jalapeno Burger! I ordered it medium and that's just how it came to me. It was super juicy and cooked perfectly! The freshly ground blend of Sirloin, Brisket & Short Rib was amazing and by adding the jalapeno cream cheese really makes the burger. It was so good! The Bacon Fat Home Fries were really good as well and complemented the burger to a tee.

My other complaint was the bun as it missing something. it could have been buttered or something. The house made pickles were great also.

Our waitress was perfect the whole night and never left my Coke or water glass get empty for long."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this gem while visiting Pittsburgh over the holidays and ended up sticking around for a full 5 hours (we blamed the snow, but it was mostly due to not wanting to leave).  Here's why: 
- friendly, down to earth service
- the best burger I've ever had, hands down (whoa!) 
- great happy hour prices (and sizes of plates!) 
- cozy, polished atmosphere without feeling pretentious 
- a touchtunes jukebox (okay, sometimes this can be a bad thing, but my friends and I greatly appreciated it)
- great craft cocktails (try their barrel aged selections) and equally delicious beers, along with generous pours of wine 

Do yourself a favor and check this spot out!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Good burgers and a nice bar. Great vibe. Is a very laid back place and seems to be a popular place to go before a Pirate Game (short walk to PNC Park).

Every burger I have gotten here is great! One of these days I'll have to go out of my way to order something that isn't a burger, but I just can't do it!

I had the bacon and onion with provolone. Asked for medium and got medium. Some places don't even know how to cook a burger, but they do here."}
{"text":"Great burger bistro on Pittsburgh's North Side. Cozy atmosphere and good eats. The burgers are made in a special grill and the variations of burgers are excellent."}
{"text":"If you're going here for dinner, great choice. The burgers are amazing here; the Candied Jalape√±o burger is my absolute favorite. It has a layer of their candied jalape√±o cream cheese which is sweet, spicy and creamy. Amazing. They also serve this cream cheese with their pretzels, if you want to give it a try without committing to having a whole burger with it. If you're feeling extra hungry, get the My Morning Burger because it's huge. It has a whole breakfast on top of a burger: an egg, bacon and home fries. There really hasn't been a burger that I haven't liked here. As a side, the home fries are a great accompaniment to go with the burgers. The home fries are the way to go because the other sides I've tried (broccoli and cole slaw) aren't that great. 

Although dinner is great here, I'm not sure I can recommend going here for breakfast or early brunch. The brunch menu hasn't disappointed. However, when I came here for brunch, they sat us in the lounge area and the music was blaring which doesn't quite set the mood for enjoying my delicate quiche. I think for brunch, try to get a seat outside or in the bar side. Perhaps music is less loud in those areas. 

Overall, great burgers and drinks.  Awesome daily specials that make you want to return each day of the week. Loud music at all times, including brunch service."}
{"text":"Went into Benjamin's a few weeks ago and had a decent dining experience. It's a smaller restaurant and it makes for an intimate setting to have a meal. I ordered BBQ wings for an appetizer and they were some of the best I've ever had. The meat was literally falling off the bone. I just wish the serving size was slightly larger.

As for the burger, it too was one of the best I've ever had. Ordered the Kentucky bourbon burger and everything about it was perfect. The patty itself tasted incredibly fresh, the bun was buttered and very light and the toppings on the burger were all very good. 

The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because of the service. Our server, a younger woman, took our order and didn't check back in with us after the appetizer was brought out. I wanted to order a beer with my burger but another employee brought us our meal. We didn't see our original server until she brought us our bill, which was 25 minutes after we got our food. A little frustrating but things happen, will consider coming back again sometime."}
{"text":"This was a great whole-the-wall place my girlfriend and I stumbled upon looking for somewhere to go in the North Side. It's nice because there is no wait and it's a very intimate atmosphere. I got a crab cake sandwich with a pesto pasta side, both of which tasted amazing. I'm not a fan of cold pasta, but whatever they did to this made it fantastic. My girlfriend got a burger with home fries, and they were both great as well. The kitchen is literally apart of the bar, and the guy who is cooking the food was 2 ft from us (if that). He is an amazing cook and should be given some serious props for the environment that he works in, as I could only imagine how high pressure it is. Overall, great place, nice staff, and most importantly amazing food."}
{"text":"A strong burger with a great meat blend. The brisket plays well through the burger and every bite is very fresh. Don't be afraid to get the burger a little less done, it's good fresh meats and the flavors compliment better somewhere between med-rare and medium. 

I've been here a couple of times and have had a couple different menu burgers, but a standout burger for me is the Candied Jalape√±o Burger. Love the idea of creating my own with the unique options available."}
{"text":"We've been back for lunch or brunch since my last review,  and we really do like it there.  We're still hesitant to try dinner after that last,  awful time."}
{"text":"The hamburgers were good but a bit over priced. We wanted Cheddar cheese instead of Swiss and they charged us $1.25/person for the substitution. Never telling us ahead of time. Nor did we see it on the menu. Nice atmosphere"}
{"text":"Ok ... I really don't even know where to begin here.  I'm always hesitant to make the claim \"that was the best burger I've ever had\" because seriously ... that's a mighty bold claim.  But ... that might have been the best burger I ever had.  To boot the standard tired side of fries is wonderfully absent from the menu.  Don't get me wrong ... I've never met a French fry I didn't love, but how refreshing to have some really good quality and different sides.  Personally, I recommend the Broccoli Salad.  Although I was unable to enjoy the delicacies of a liquid variety ..... this visit ..... I will surely return to try out a few of the great beers they have and a few of the numerous top shelf bourbons I spied behind the bar.  Benjamin's deserves every star .... and then some ...."}
{"text":"We came here on St. Paddy's Day for dinner before a dessert-only wedding. It was fairly busy but we got a table right away. We started off ordering some beers. They've got about 8-10 craft taps. 

Unfortunately I'd just had a burger at home the night before, so to eat I ordered the crab cake sandwich. My food was good. The crab cake was big and very moist. I really enjoyed the pasta salad I had as my side. 

My husband and friend we were also with both got burgers. My friend looooves their burgers. My husband liked his as well but he did say he's had better. My friend disagrees, but I didn't have one so I cannot settle the debate!

When we got the check at the end of our meal we did get charged for the wrong more expensive beers. But I understand that the staff was probably going a little crazy with St. Patty's day! I'd really like to go back and try the burgers for myself."}
{"text":"I went here with a couple friends before the football game.  We wanted something quick but substantial.  I am a big fan of the \"vibe\" of this restaurant, cozy, dimly lit, fire place, beautiful bar.  

The menu at this place isn't huge and all sandwiches/burgers (but hey! its a burger joint so I guess that makes sense).  There are a lot of fun options, rosemary balsamic goat cheese and green apples, aged cheddar, wine soaked onions.  So I might not be the prime candidate for this spot because I don't eat red meat or pork.   Generally, burger spots have some alternatives (turkey burgers, chicken breast, salmon, portabellas) but this place only had a veggie burger.  I wasn't floored by the patty.  I am normally a fan of zesty bean based burgers but this was had a sweat potato base.  It wasn't horrible but I have had better.  The consistently wasn't stellar. 

I ended up getting the rosemary-balsamic-goat cheese with green apples.  It was good but the toppings were the best part and the bread was a bit much. 


We also got the mustard truffle pretzels which isn't really anything fancy on the pretzel front (just normal Giant Eagle mini pretzels).  The truffle mustard was awesome though! I think the order is $1.95 so its not breaking the bank and makes the Giant Eagle pretzels understandable. 

PROS: Cozy ambiance, good bottle list, fire place, pool tables, fun toppings. 

CONS: No draft beer, limited veggie options 

OVERALL: I will be back. Apparently, the menu changes frequently so I look forward to some updates."}
{"text":"It was fun ---- I did not get a burger or my rating might have been higher, cause they sure looked good.  We split some appetizers and had some beer.  They ran out of mine while was on a roll - so I switched to the Manhattan, and therefore never developed an appetite.  In other words - damn good drinks!"}
{"text":"You gotta have the burger!  Such a great mix of different beefs.  I highly recommend it! I also recommend the war streets beers. Get yourself a flight!"}
{"text":"First time here. Very much enjoyed. Nice craft beer options from War Streets Brewery. Attentive staff. Pulled pork was very good. Next time will get the Apple Goat cheese burger my husband had. Very yummy."}
{"text":"If there's one thing I love, it's a good burger, and my goodness, based on the meal I had here Benjamin's knows exactly how to make a good burger!

I stopped in with a family member because we had a discount card for Benjamin's, but after our meal we'd come back whether we were getting the discount or not. I ordered a top shelf cheeseburger minus the onions and with a couple extra of my favorite toppings. And the burger I got was, well, really darn good! It was definitely not undercooked, but the dripping of juicy beef goodness that had me carefully eating over my plate the entire meal was a clear indication that it wasn't overcooked, either - and given my history of getting overcooked burgers, this was fantastic. My dining partner enjoyed one of their fall ales in addition to their burger, and the two things went together really well. I was admittedly way more focused on the yummy burger than the booze at that point.

I guess my only tiny complaint was that I had a little confusion with the menu, which led to me getting a spicy side dish with my food. So much of the menu includes a list of ingredients that you can choose from, that I didn't realize that ordering a side of broccoli would include all of the listed ingredients (which included wasabi) mixed together as a dressing. So I ended up eating a pretty spicy side of broccoli with my burger. It tasted just fine and now I know better for next time, but it wouldn't hurt if they clarified which parts of the menu were \"pick your ingredients\" and which ones weren't.

But overall, Benjamin's is definitely somewhere I'd eat again, and now it's on my top five places to grab a great burger in this city. My dining partner and I left feeling full and content. Can't wait to stop by again!"}
{"text":"Best burger in the city hands down. Owner is a hardworking and impressive guy! Def will be back."}
{"text":"Mmmmm Meat! Best gourmet burgers ever.
Great service, fun menu, cozy atmosphere, fun decor. 

Bloody Mary Bar for Sunday Brunch is a nice touch. 

So far have tried the Mushroom Swiss Birger, the Barbeque, and the Candied Jalepeno cream cheese and Bacon burgers.... And recommend all of them. 
#allofthemeats

The Pickeled stuff and deviled eggs are also great:)

Love the simple concept of the place!  

Count me in for another."}
{"text":"First off, I wish I could give Benjamins an extra half star for excellent service and beautiful bathroom.  Seriously, the bathroom is spectacular and they handled our party of 11 like complete pros.  

My problem is, the burger I had just doesn't stand up to others I've had in the city.  It's good, but nothing mind blowing.  I started my meal off with a side salad, which was a little odd because it had salsa on top.  It was a very tasty salad with good balsamic dressing, dont get me wrong, but definitely the first time I had salsa on a salad (and not much else).  I ordered the Top Shelf burger with Aged Cheddar cheese.  I got a side of home fries.  I added bacon and pickles to the burger.  

The burger was big, with toppings piled high.  Not a bad thing, but I appreciate a bun that can handle a big burger, which this was not.  I ended up eating most of the burger with a fork and knife, and just picking out the bacon and eating it by itself (it was really good bacon).  The pickles were not standard dill pickles, but a sweet and spicy pickle which was OK, but not what I would have chosen.  The home fries were good, but let's face it, not french fries, which is what I think everyone wants instead.  

I'll stress again how great the service was... they separated all of our checks without us even asking.  They were extremely attentive and friendly.  I would go back just based on this fact.  Great service like that is hard to find!"}
{"text":"Pretty much just good things to say. Delicious food. Almost 100% are friendly and attentive. Good beers. Maybe just wish there were a few more tap lines. And wish the pool table was back there still. Freal. Great tofu sandwich. Great burgers. Awesome brunch."}
{"text":"I've been here numerous times and their burgers are so good! That is the main reason they get four stars... Staff is so so and it is definitely not a place to go for anything but a burger they are not really interested at all in having a bar scene(drinks are expensive here especially the bourbon which they have a huge variety of) and as soon as they start slowing down at the end of the dinner rush they start cleaning up like they couldn't get out of their fast enough

Great food, OK service, and really just a place to eat and head elsewhere to hang out post dinner"}
{"text":"The burgers are great! I live around the corner so this is my neighborhood \"go to\" bar for a nice, reliable dinner. I've never had an overcooked burger there, actually this is one of the only places I've been to that will serve a burger with any amount of pink in the middle. Great selection of beer and whiskey too. I definitely can see where some of the poor reviews about service come from-  it always does take awhile for us to get our order in, but every time I come back I like Benjamin's more and more because even though the service could be quicker, I really like the staff here."}
{"text":"Amending my previous review. Came on a not terribly busy Sunday night, and somehow ended up with one waiter taking care of us primarily, and a second waiter coming over after we had ordered appetizers to ask us about ordering food, and when I replied that we had ordered but then clarified that we hadn't ordered dinner yet, he became exasperated. The appetizers came out at the same time as our burgers (which we did receive apologies for), which were all cooked to a medium rare (at most) despite 2 of 3 of us ordering them more well-done. The shrimp with the shrimp and grits appetizer was unseasoned and over-cooked. Not sure I'll be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Great food, great service and great atmosphere! A welcomed addition to the North Side! Try their speciality cocktails and amazing selection of gourmet burgers."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and both times the wait staff was  dry good at checking in on us. The burgers are the best. Next time I go I will tell them to surprise me. I know what e er I get it will be great."}
{"text":"BWAB is the latest edition to the burgeoning burger scene in the burgh'.

As such, I was intrigued to visit, and delighted for further development in the Northside.

The interior is cozy, and the brick above the bar is a nice touch. The rest of the interior doesnt really match it. This really seems to be a metaphor for the lack of congruence BWAB exhibits. 

Ok, I get it, premium burgers justify a premium price in the ever recent trend of making pedestrian american fare into something more culinary. Some places have been successful at this.

As it stands now, I left with neither a positive or negative experience. That in itself, is a negative. 

They are new, and as such, do not have drafts yet. They have a decent bottle/can selection of micro's. The menu is succinct, and you have the option of burgers. Good job, as I think menus exhibiting brevity are generally prefferred.

The list of burger options reads well, however the sides read like something akin to Denny's. 

My girlfriend, as usual, ordered better (Goat cheese and apple burger), and I ordered the Bleu Cheese, Lardo, Green Olives, Pimento, Onion.

They did cook both of them to med-rare, which is one plus. The lardo was one giant piece, resulting in an inequality of distribution across the burger. The other ingredients were sparse and lacked the definition.

If you are trying to juxtapose different flavors, they should really all have an element of uniqueness to them.


The side, hash browns/home fries, looked like they came out of a frozen foods section. 

If you want to justify your 11/plate price point, it is going to take a bit more than Orieda and some fancy toppings to win over my burger loving self.

I hope these are merely growing pains, but my girlfriend and I both left stating that we could probably construct a better burger ourselves. 

This is not a problem unique to this restaraunt, but people tend to get wrapped up in the concept and skip the details. Sorry, but we yelpers notice this stuff.

If you are going to step up to Wingharts or Tessaro's, you better bring your A-game."}
{"text":"I've been to Benjamin's multiple times and always have a good experience. Great burgers and drinks!! Go for brunch...the short rib jalape√±o cheddar waffle is amazing! The Bloody Mary bar isn't bad either. Service is always great too. Only downside is the place is small, be prepared to wait during peak times. Also on street/metered parking is hard to come by during game days/concerts/events on the North Shore."}
{"text":"Fabulous neighborhood restaurant / bar! Great burgers! Awesome craft beer & really good service. Neighborhood bar with really good food & local vibe. Give it a try! You will be happy you did!"}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I've had in a long time. That secret sauce is incredible at first bite. I had never been here but so glad we stopped there today for lunch. Great service, very clean and trendy place. Thank you Bier's Pub, I will be back."}
{"text":"I'd like to see this business get a boost in their star ratings and here's why. 

The decor is so lovely on the inside , lit candles on the bar and modern art works on the walls. The back section of Benjamin's  has additional seating a pool table and   oversized black comfy couches.  I can see myself having fun back there ;) I dined here two days in row and enjoyed both visits. 

And also Benjamin's has a back patio seating area, for those of you who value this sort of thing.

I ordered the cheese board yumm-o which is served with truffle mustard and wine braised onions. The blue cheese was soft and melt in your mouth delicious.  I did think it was odd that there was no cheese knife so I had to eat the cheese with my hands. I used the cheese to scoop up the mustard, no biggie.   I also ordered a burger topped with truffle mustard and wine soaked onions with a side of cole slaw.  I wasn't a fan of the coleslaw , way too much vinegar.  The burger was juicy and hot and peppery and made to order. If they cook all the burgers this well I'll be back to sample more, particularly the blue cheese, green olives topped burger. 

Warning, they serve all their food on paper plates with plastic utensils , that justs a heads up!"}
{"text":"That Kentucky Bourbon burger... Oh my goodness! Has to have been the juiciest \"well done\" burger I have ever tasted. it was absolutely delicious! The bread was tasty and lightly toasted, and the bacon slices were perfectly thick and perfectly slight, the provolone was also melted just right. I typically define a quality burger by an ability to eat it \"as is\", not adding anything that is not on the menu description. This burger did not even require extra sauces or ketchup. Service is friendly and fast, and if it matters to you like it matters to me, your water will never be left empty. The only reason they are not getting five stars is because the sides (one comes free which every burger) is nice, lack much to be desired. I physically could not eat the broccoli salad the taste was so displeasing, and a friend who got home fries, left dissatisfied as well. They don't serve basics like French fries and potato chips, and I think that is probably a \"miss\" but just be safe and trust the name, burgers are certainly their forte!"}
{"text":"My husband said it was the best burger he has ever had. He had the goat cheese and apple burger. I tasted it. The burger was aeesome, but the cheese had too much rosemary for me.
I ordered the BBQ wings. Wow!!!! The near fell off the bones. The sauce was perfect. 
I recommend highly.
We were there late I the afternoon so it was very laid back."}
{"text":"We were here for a party, people were ordering mostly drinks, but some food also. 2 bartenders at the bar, who stood the majority of the time staring at the cash register with their backs to their customers. I don't mean for a minute, or 5 minutes, but even longer. The bar backs were behind them pointing, making faces, etc, because they knew how bad the service was. I've been here for lunch before and the food was good, but on a this Friday night the service was dismal!"}
{"text":"I have put this off too long and for no good reason.  I. Absolutely.  Love.  Benjamin's!  Yes I love a burger restaurant that really doesn't have a kitchen and that operates without a deep fryer.  Why?  Probably because they have the best burger in Pittsburgh.  I am sure that statement can be met with disapproval, and I don't care.  These bar side made burgers are so good!  I have yet to have a burger cooked there that wasn't cooked incredible perfect and to my requested standards, seasoned wonderfully and was so full of flavor.   Their candied jalapeno burger served medium rare is my favorite and I get it every time I come.  I also really enjoy their shrimp and grits, actually the BEST shrimp and grits I have ever had.  Perfectly cooked grits, not hard or gritty, with a habanera cheese sauce, topped with broiled shrimp.  So delicious.

I need to point out that my first visit to Benjamin's was for a Yelp event last year.  I am so happy they had that event and I got to attend, because otherwise I don't think I would have ever tried this place.  


Now since they lack any fryers and the kitchen is literally on the corner of the bar (IE the oven, prep, plates) their side dishes are all raw minus the bacon home fries.  I don't mind this at all, I prefer something a little healthier to go with my most likely 800 calorie burger, but I wish the sides were a little more inventive, and I wish they offered a salad as well.  Last time I tried the broccoli salad as my side.  Eh it was ok.  The broccoli was nice, crunchy, and vibrant but the sauce and other components lacked flavor.  I also had their pasta salad and potato salad.  The pasta salad was my favorite of the three but still wish there were some other options for sides.  
I must also mention, they have a Brunch with a Bloody Mary Bar on Saturday and Sundays, and offer daily drink specials, on top of their Monday through Friday Happy Hour specials which you can get $2.00 off your draft choice.  Just a couple more reasons I love this place."}
{"text":"I had lunch with some colleagues at Benjamin's. This was my first visit and though I was intrigued by the burgers, and some other menu items, I was craving  smoked salmon on the drive in this morning. As luck would have it, Benjamin's offers a pastrami style smoked salmon with brie, romaine, onion, tomato, dill aioli on a toasted wheat Kaiser roll. This sandwich is pared with a choice of side dish and who can resist wasabi and broccoli? Very nice, fresh broccoli florets, shredded carrots, and sesame with a light wasabi dressing. The menu pricing is slightly upscale and my lunch cost $13+ with no drink. I like water! Benjamin's does have a full bar and the atmosphere is very \"pub\" like which is to say that it is comfortable, the music was appropriately loud enough but not too loud for conversation at your table, there is a TV showing soccer, and the seating is fine. Tables w/chairs on one side and a long bench on the other.

I cant wait to try this place again. Next time I'll be checking out the burgers for sure!"}
{"text":"Good cheese plate. Good sangria. Service was mostly attentive. Nice crowd. Lovely old interior. Nice outdoor seating - you can watch the world go by on the North Side. Across the street from the Modern Cafe, another excellent joint. Excellent prices. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"I am such a fan of Bier's Pub and I find myself here more often than I care to admit during football season! I've only been in for brunch or drinks but have had a great time during all of my visits.

They're known for their burgers and they truly live up to the hype.  I usually order the crabcake benedict, but have tried the hangover helper and other items from the menu - all very tasty.  They have a small build your own bloody mary bar and the drinks are always flowing here.  It's been bustling with business every Saturday or Sunday I've been here.  It's your standard bar/restaurant atmosphere and our servers are always friendly.

My only complaint is that the food almost always takes FOREVER to come out.  Don't come here if you are looking for something quick before a game. Definitely have some time to spend hanging out with your friends and having at LEAST 3 drinks before you get your food.  Service is nice but sloooooow.  Foods great though and it's a fun place to go before heading down to the North Shore for a game."}
{"text":"Stopped in with a bunch of clients on their recommendation.

Very good burger bar with great decor and charm.

Ordered the candied jalepeno burger with bacon. Asked for it rare and it came out perfectly cooked and topped with spicy, jalepeno cream cheese and crispy applewood smoked bacon.

Bun was fresh and did not get soggy while eating the burger. As a side I opted for the curried slaw which was also very good and cut the unctousness of the burger.

Everyone else reported thier burger and sides were excellent, particularly the bacon fat home fries.

Service was very good and prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like Benjamins...

I've been to Benjamins 3 times, and each new experience has been worse than the previous. The first time I ate there the service was fine and the burger was awesome. It was cooked properly, and the toppings were tasty, without taking too much attention from the meat.

The second time we had really slow service, and the burger was just slightly overcooked. Not a huge deal, but its not the type of inconsistency you want in a burger joint.

The third and final meal I ate here was by far the worst. Although the restaurant was nearly empty, the service was awfully slow. It took about 15 minutes to order, another 10 for the drinks to arrive, and another 20 after that for the food. Every burger at our table was overcooked, and not by a little. The toppings were still great, but an overcooked, flavorless patty means you're in for a bad time. What a bummer. 

The servers and bartenders are super friendly, it's in a great location, the price is right, and the atmosphere is great. But when it comes down to it, the burgers are mediocre. A solid 'meh' rating."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my visit here.  The food was very good and the wait staff were attentive.  I ordered the pulled pork and potato salad.  Everything was delicious."}
{"text":"In the interest of honesty, I'm a regular. But I have to post a note about the changes they've made. The tasting room looks amazing, they're bringing in local music, and they're promoting local beer. Jake and Abbey are doing it right. They've kept the old favorites, but are making small changes to make it their own. The only small critique is that I've noticed a couple of folks comment that the new chairs aren't designed for larger patrons. This is a great asset to the neighborhood. 

PS check out the new sides... and grab a Kentucky Bourbon burger."}
{"text":"I was disappointed that I didn't love my experience here as much as I did when I came to the elite event earlier this month. After coming the first week of October and sampling a lot of Benjamin's signature items (shrimp and grits, candied jalape√±o burger and the crab cake), I couldn't wait to return! My boyfriend is a huge burger fan so I knew I wanted him to experience this place as well. 

We came on a Thursday night around 830. It was kind of busy and the bartenders were very busy, considering they were not only covering the bar but the table service as well. Our service was awesome, our server was super friendly and attentive to us despite how busy he was. 

I ordered the candied jalape√±o burger with a side of broccoli with wasabi sauce, a side salad and the curried coleslaw. My boyfriend ordered a traditional burger with fries and a side salad. 

He liked his burger and fries but didn't feel as if it was anything out of the ordinary as far as your average burger goes. We both felt the side salad wasn't worth nearly $4. It was decent in size but the only toppings were soggy tomatoes, white onions and croutons. Nothing special. The curried coleslaw was disappointing- barely any curry flavor and the vinegar taste was overwhelming. The wasabi broccoli was alright, but I didn't finish it because the sauce was a little over powering. I'm giving this place three stars primarily because the candied jalape√±o burger itself is that good. The sauce is amazing. 

I don't think I'll be returning, unless I have an intense craving for the candied jalape√±o burger."}
{"text":"Amazing! Try the \"My Morning Burger\" and goat cheese and apple burger. Best burger I've had in a VERY long time. The meat is packed with flavor and makes all the difference. They are doing it right here!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here with a friend and the food and cocktails were great. I ordered the shrimp and grits w/ a BLT which was amazing. I would recommend this place for anyone who happens to be on the Northside."}
{"text":"I just wish we hadn't had our daughter with us.  It was pretty dim and quiet, and she was bored, but we loved the burgers and the bar menu.  Will go back on a date some time!"}
{"text":"Going to call this: BEST HAMBURGER IN PITTSBURGH! I'll seriously fight you over this opinion! (maybe not fists, but rock'em sock'em robots or a spirited bout of paper, rock, scissors) anyway, the burger was juicy and tasty, it was like an atomic bomb of flavor! When was the last time you said that about a burger? Me, the spring of 2001 at a tailgate, but that's a review for another time. The sides were creative and fun, the side salad was so huge, it had its own zip code! To top it off they were super sweet to our dogs! I'd show you a picture but I was to consumed with the flavorful meal I was wolfing down!"}
{"text":"Great brunch! The lamb sausage and eggs were fantastic. I was eyeing up the Bloody Mary bar, but unable to partake ( having a long drive ahead of me today)."}
{"text":"Very interesting to have a place open up across the street from Modern Cafe, which I visit a good bit, and be more on it's level as far as class. Sure, you walk inside and Benjamins is beautiful looking. From the exposed brick right down to the wish-I-had wooden tables. But with this look also comes an aroma of greasy burgers that you are sure to walk out smelling like. They are doing what they can to ventilate, I guess, as they had a large metal device trying to take out some of the smell. It just wasn't enough.

The bar tender, who also served us, was very friendly. He suggested things from the menu that were unusual and a must try. Unfortunately I wanted to try what he suggested as a veggie burger. More like bun burger with a paper thin patty of veggie burger. I do not recommend the veggie burgers from this place for a second. I just tried my hand at a veggie burger the week before at home, and mine was 8x's better on the first try. Yikes.

Beer selection was plentiful. I love when places have a lot to choose from. I'd like to go back to the billiards area on a game day with some friends and hang out there. 

All in all it was, well, A-OK. My dates burger was delicious so I'd say, stick with the burgers. It is, after all, what they are known for."}
{"text":"I stopped by here last Friday evening with my fiance for dinner.  We had tried going to Benjamins this past summer whenever we were in the North Side only to be turned away because their oven wasn't working.  We figured it to be a fluke and headed over at around 7:00 PM on a frigid night.  Whenever we arrived the place was packed with only a single empty table which we were shown to promptly.  This table ended up being near the front of the restaurant and next to two windows and so both my fiance and I elected to keep our jackets on during the whole meal.  I would imagine this is usually not a problem but happened to be that night since Pittsburgh was in a cold snap.

For our dinner my fiance and I decided to start off the meal by splitting the soft pretzels and choosing the truffle mustard over the candied jalapeno cream cheese dipping sauce.  This would later allow me to order the candied jalapeno cream cheese and bacon burger for my entree with a side of curried cabbage cole slaw since I wanted to try different things.  Within a short time of ordering the pretzels came out with a welcome warmth to them.  They tasted pretty good on their own with my only complaint being that they might have been over salted a bit.  That was easily remedied by rubbing some of the salt off before I ate it though.  The real star of this dish ended up being the truffle mustard.  Who would have thought combing truffle with mustard was a good idea?  Well it was as the strong truffle flavor came through first before making room for the nice mustard flavor.  Our entrees came out a bit later and as my burger was being placed down in front of me my first thought was \"This is it for my $10.50 burger?\"  Of course I could have went with the double but the $4.50 more for an extra meat patty that wasn't very large probably wouldn't have made me too happy either.  In any case I decided to start off my dinner by digging into the curried cabbage cole slaw.  There wasn't much curried flavor to the cole slaw but it did have a lot of vinegar on it which I enjoyed but I imagine that many others would not.  Then I moved on to the burger which ended up tasting pretty good .  It's  meat was cooked to the proper medium temperature and the candied jalapeno cream cheese provided some good flavor with a bit of spiciness.

The bottom line for me is that I probably wouldn't stop here again in the future.  It's not that the food was bad as I ended up enjoying most of what I had ordered but I think that it is overpriced for what you receive."}
{"text":"Very solid burgers here, you can tell they are freshly ground in house. Fun combinations, I'm partial to the one that comes with goat cheese and a giant pile of julienned apples. Also, THANK GOD I FINALLY FOUND A PLACE WITH A GLUTEN FREE BUN. Jesus, Pittsburgh is a city obsessed with wheat. 

My one complaint: their potato salad is so promising, what with bleu cheese and a mustard vinaigrette, but the one time I got it, the potatoes themselves were undercooked. Like crunchy raw. Other sides are top notch, like the bacon fat home fries and the vaguely Asian broccoli salad. 

Go for brunch. Get the Hangover Helper. Thank me later."}
{"text":"great atmosphere, interesting menu, friendly service. love this place. it's tiny so will be packed on a weekend night, but nickys isn't the only great find on western ave. they don't have a huge draft selection but what they do have on tap is quality and there is a decent supporting bottle selection. they even have vegetarian options in case you have a meat free person in your party. better than your average burger joint for sure."}
{"text":"Stopped by on a recommendation, had the goat cheese and Apple burger. O. My. Good. Lord. Everything about this was amazing and delicious. Cooked perfectly, great taste, great prices, great service. My husband had the meat plate and the cheese plate which we took half of both home and are later and they were still delicious. We loved it SO much we went back the next morning for brunch and the bloody Mary bar. SERIOUSLY. Also amazing!!!!! I had the smoked salmon, which they forgot the fruit, but not sure if I'd have been able to eat it w everything else!!! Absolutely DELICIOUS!!!!! My husband had the hangover cure which he also raved about!!! And the bloody Mary bar?! Everything you could want...just a great little place!!! You leave smelling like burgers, but is that REALLY a BAD thing?! I'd recommend Benjamin's to any and all...which we have friends coming from our of town this weekend, we will be stopping by before the pirates game!!!!! Can't wait to try something new!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I went there on a beautiful Sunday. We visited the Warhol and were hungry. We were seated promptly but the server did not give us menus while people coming after us already got them. We waited for water and finally got the water ten minutes after. We asked them to clean the table because the table was not cleaned as well. The burgers arrived very long after other people arriving (and ordering) after us placed their orders. There was a mistake in the order (issue with the type of cheese and side) - we kept the burger (we did not want to wait again). The server did not charge us for this burger.

During all our meal, the server came very rarely to refill our water or drinks. So, the service was really not great.

For the food, the burgers were really good. The choice of side (broccoli salad, home fries, potato salad) change from the usual french fries.

Obviously, the servers were busy and the place seems packed on a Sunday. But in that case, why there is no more server?

So, very good for the food but horrible for the service. Might be a place to go when it is not packed/crowded."}
{"text":"Benjamin's has really expanded over the last year, and I'm happy to see it! I've been to the restaurant a total of six times, and each time is better than the last. They have expanded their menu (mainly the appetizers and sides) and ventilated their grill as per Yelpers requests, and seem to have a vested interest in the opinions of their patrons. 

The Siracha deviled eggs are pretty disappointing in my opinion, but the balsamic goat cheese burger is worth the trip alone. Their unique flavors are refreshing, and frankly a little higher brow than most upscale burger joints (read: Burgatory) which is definitely a good thing. 

Upon my last visit however, my party waited for upwards of an hour for our meals to arrive. The chef came out of the kitchen to personally explain the situation to our table. He said that the propane ran out as he was cooking our order. He felt extremely terrible about the whole ordeal, and comped the entire meal, plus our hefty bar tab (easily over $150 total).

My experiences at Benjamin's continue to be pleasant surprising, and I'm glad to see that they continue to gain popularity. I just hope they stay underground enough that I won't have to wait for upwards of an hour to get a table, like some other burger joints (read: Burgatory)."}
{"text":"So, I tried Benjamin's today in Allegheny West.  Not a huge disappointment. The service was very good.  The burgers we ordered were accomplished very well. 

I had BBQ Bacon Burger and my friend had some Balsamic vinegar, Apple, whatever burger.  I hesitated ordering it because I imagined cheap nasty bacon with ValuTime BBQ sauce.  It was actually quite good.  The bacon was very thick cut.  The bun was perfect and toasted.  It appeared to possibly be whole wheat as well.  I unfortunately did not get to try my friend's burger. 

I had home fries and he tried the cole slaw.  The home fries were good, but very breakfasty.  I would've been happier with fresh cut french fries.  They were light and not soaked in oil but not exactly what I wanted from a burger place.  The cole slaw was _NOT_ cole slaw.  It was cabbage but with a vinegar dressing.  It was very tasty and felt like it was much healthier than something slathered with a cream dressing.  I would order it again but I don't feel it should be called cole slaw.  
 
The menu was actually rather confusing at first.  It seemed to be in the wrong order, if that makes sense.  We also only went hoping to have appetizers or something small and really the only real option was a meal or wine/beer.  The appetizer section seemed to be lacking any sort of appeal.  The other sandwiches that were offered did not appeal to me at all.  My friend thought of the Salmon but decided against. There also did not to appear to be a children's or Smaller portion section of the menu.  Yes, I order from the children's menu.  I like the smaller portions and the smaller price.  My favorite is the \"Chicken Toes\" from James' St Gastropub. 

I did have the White Sangria which was amazing. We did not sample any other drinks because it was a quick lunch/early dinner. Overall, I would return but it would not become a frequent spot for me. Other's commented about how the food was served in the past.  I was ok with how it was served and how the staff treated us. However, it was really more of a nothing spectacular, nothing horrible thing.  I saw no specials and nothing extremely fabulous stood out to me.  If guests were visiting, I would show them one of the other awesome places we have to eat first before returning."}
{"text":"I went here with my boyfriend last night. The place was completely dead at 6pm. The waitress was a complete ditz that kept dropping utensils and ignoring our needs (We were one of two tables that had people sitting there.) She spent most of the night texting on her phone, not paying attention to the fact that we were out of drinks completely. We ordered two servings of appetizer pretzels with mustard. Mustard was great. Pretzels were cheap, store bought hard pretzels. We stared in disbelief for a few minutes before deciding to eat them. We ordered and shared a BBQ, Swiss Cheese, and Bacon burger, (Which was a little too red, but okay.) They do all of the cooking on a flat top stove right in the dining/bar area, which fills the room with a foul grease smell that you will end up smelling like in a matter of minutes. I was pretty disgusted with the atmosphere, and the restaurant appears to be confused as to what it's trying to be. All of my clothes reeked of nasty grease. Thought I was going to a pretty decent burger place, not a Dennys."}
{"text":"Bier's location has been a lot of things. \"True\" (or was it \"Tru\") was the first place I went to. Great, friendly servers, great bar. Cassis had great, interesting food combination, and established it as a fantastic brunch place. Then Benjamin's added great burgers (I even survived their early burger-on-white-bread days) that kept the unique-flavor mojo of Cassis. 

Bier's has largely (and wisely) kept much (all?) of Benjamin's burger and sides menu, kept the great bar and engaging staff, and added the interest of self-brewed and (mostly) local beers. Bonus that brewer-owner Jake is a good guy, a local, friendly, and hangs around and cares about the place and his customers' experiences. 

A few neighbors swear by the jalape√±o cream cheese burger. My go-to is Swiss cheese and mushroom (excellently saut√©ed) burger and broccoli salad. I've taken a couple vegetarian friends there who have loved the veg-burger renditions. 

The home brews I've had have been top notch. I don't have the fancy \"over-tones-of-hazelnut-and-espresso\" lingo because I'm no beer connoisseur, but the stouts have been stout and the ambers, well, amber. (Don't ask me about anything lighter.) All good to excellent. 

Nice, local, good place with moments of greatness."}
{"text":"Wish I could write a positive review of our first trip to Benjamin's on Western Avenue. The whole experience was poor at best. It felt dirty and dark. One table of two and two at the bar. We ate outside. A limited menu. Both burgers were undistinguished and...I hate this...served in small paper baskets. A $12 burger should not come in a paper basket. One side (in the same basket) was poor lettuce and the other side of home fries was just warm and charred. The music was loud and very strange. Annoying. So, folks, get your burgers at 5-Guys. Yes, it too may be loud and busy but the product is of much higher quality. I wonder what will follow Benjamin's. We can only hope."}
{"text":"*Brunch Review*

Bier's Pub (formerly Benjamins) has never failed to deliver a fantastic brunch experience. The make your own bloody mary bar, along with the infused vodka's is a fantastic way to start brunch. They also offer coffee with baileys/godiva liquor and mimosas. 

The brunch burger is my favorite but every other brunch entree is delicious as well.  The Hangover helper, the big breakfast, the french toast...All great."}
{"text":"Cool little Northside spot. Definitely worth a visit. Good selection of micro brews and liquors. I did not sample the food during the visit, but the food dis look quite good. Cheers to Bier's pub."}
{"text":"The candied jalepe√±o bacon burger I ordered here was solid. The burger itself was cooked perfectly at medium, and the toppings provided great contrast. To me, the burger was superior to what's offered at a lot of other Pittsburgh burger joints, including BRGR, Burgatory and Tessaro's.

I also ordered the pretzel appetizer, which also comes with the candied jalepe√±o cream cheese and mustard as dipping items. So tasty.

Unfortunately, the service left something to be desired. Service was sluggish, and seemed a bit short staffed. I was waiting for a friend for a little while. I was given a glass of water, but had to go to the bar to order my appetizer. Perhaps service issues were a fluke.

My hubby, a self-proclaimed food snob, devoured my leftovers when I got home. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I've ever had!! We had the baked Brie for an appetizer. They had a great list of drinks and craft beers! I had the Rosemary and goat cheese burger and my boyfriend had the mushroom and Swiss. Everything was a absolutely amazing. There were so many things I wanted to try on the menu and it will be my first stop the next time I am in Pittsburgh!!"}
{"text":"I'm happy to say that Benjamin's has progressed significantly since my last review and has earned this 4 star rating! They seem to have addressed each of my initial issues and I'm now a fan!! They have draft beer!!! OK, not a lot of taps but still, enough to suffice! And they had $3 beer specials on my visit there on Saturday - including 21st Amendment! I love that!! So count me in as a happy camper!

We sat at the bar, which is really charming. The whole place just feels good, even without the fire. I'm sure that's coming as the weather turns. Kasey was our bartender and was just totally awesome and attentive. She was great and a delight to talk to. We ordered burgers and they were spectacular! The beef really does make a difference and these were incredibly flavorful - the custom hand mixed blend rivals most any others I've ever had - and is far better than that of Burgatory in my opinion. I had the burger with the fried egg on top (love that!), thick cut smoked bacon and  hot sauce mayo and I'm here to tell you it was fabulous! It was bigger than the burgers we had here previously so I think they've adjusted things properly. My wife's goat cheese and green apple burger was equally amazing and we both left stuffed!! 

Although I didn't order them, the pretzels which initially were vending machine quality bag pretzels are now on the menu as \"soft\" pretzels with truffle mustard so I'm assuming they've improved there as well!  A great place and I can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"Walked down for lunch on Sunday.  Brunch with bloody Mary's available.  Wanted to try the burger since they have the fresh ground meat mixed from a couple different cuts.

Tasted great best burger so far in Pittsburgh.  Home fries a neat and different side option.  Well worth it especially when you compare to something like five guys (chain).

Inside it's a neat looking place with bar and sidewalk seating.  Not a big place so if see a line you will have a long wait. Also the kitchen is very small at end of bar.

We had a great experience and the price surprised me. Less than $12 a person for a burger and side."}
{"text":"I finally made it here for lunch! This place has been on my radar for quite sometime now and what a great lunch spot it was :). Every time I have driven past I would always smell burgers and it always was a delightful smell. It's not a very big restaurant, but they do have a bar and extra outdoor seating. When you walk in you will notice the big chalkboard with the weekly specials displayed. On Saturdays and Sundays they serve brunch and offer a Bloody Mary bar. 

I knew from the start I was going to order a burger, and pretty quickly decided on the bbq burger which came with a BBQ sauce and applewood smoked bacon. The BBQ sauce is not on the sweet side it's more tangy, but complemented the burger well! The burger itself is made with a blend of sirloin, brisket and short rib. It was so fresh and well prepared! If you are not in the mood for burgers they do have other menu options as well. For my side I ordered the pasta salad and it was just okay, nothing special. My mom ordered the Kentucky bourbon burger and she really enjoyed with. The bourbon sauce was on the sweeter side compared to the BBQ sauce. She went with the home fries as her side! Overall I think this is a pretty solid burger joint and would definitely like to stop in for brunch one day!"}
{"text":"I love it here!  I've been to a birthday party in the upstairs lounge and for just a normal lunch. Both experiences were fantastic! The staff is very friendly and accommodating, and we had a 2 year old with us. The food was great and the atmosphere is hip and trendy but relaxed. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We came in on a Sunday night with two table taken in the place and were asked to move to a smaller table in case a larger table came in. They are closing in 25 minutes and we wanted to watch the football game. I said we would move if a larger party came in and got attitude from our waitress.
I would think they would want the extra income before closing. We live in the neighborhood and are in the industry. Dirty looks and attitude don't work for us."}
{"text":"A $12 burger in a paper basket, yuk, but I can live with it. Serve my kids raw burgers and vent your grill into the hallway and not outdoors...that, I have a real problem with. 

We will not be going back, but then again, it will probably be something new soon enough."}
{"text":"Slow - for a burger that is flame broil - it's a good burger but nothing I couldn't duplicate in the back yard - The business is great for this spot - everyone extra friendly - the home fries were OK but the Potatoes salad was missing a lot of identity! Overall I would eat here again in a pinch but would not be my 1,2,3 choice to grab a non- commercial burger place! No milkshake or tradition fries and that's because the kitchen is basically behind the bar! Again no distinguish flavor or homemade ranch or signature taste that says their name! Nothing that makes you have an addiction to and crave later! But perfect for this area that is without this kind of variety! Another thing! They had to turn down customers because they have only about 50 seating amongst 4 tables - so smaller couples have to sit at the bar - not cool!"}
{"text":"This place is one reason(among many) everyone should come visit Pittsburgh 
a little place with about 8 tables plus a bar.
Friendly bar tender working big tv with Sports going on behind him 
living room like feel 
waitress so kind and welcoming 
I love their menu! its a called a burger bar for a good reason
its a bar and they make some mighty fine burgers
they have a grill right next to the bar
so many choices you pick a burger then the toppings 
being a pescatarian I opted for their veggie burger well done (sometimes veggie burgers are mush) but not at Benjamins they cooked it well done as I asked
I had goat cheese and granny apple topping DELISH
and the roll was fresh and amazing 
my side was their potato salad with blue cheese boy oh boy was it good
my kid had a bacon cheese burger and he ate the entire thing exclaiming it was one of the best burgers he has eaten
they offer some tasty sounded apps like a cheese board, Brie (my next visit) pretzels & wings for example plus salads sammies n such
they have a nice selection of sodas from Hanks to my choice of Jamaican ginger beer. 
The prices are so reasonable you can't go wrong here
burgers sodas even a beer all under 50 bucks
go have a burger
next time I want to try their desserts
easy enough on a saturday night to find parking on the street"}
{"text":"Believe the hype!! 

I've been told by several people how amazing this place is, and I need to go. So my boyfriend and I were on our way to a venue in town and he was craving a burger and I remembered Benjamin's was in the area. He ordered a buffalo blue burger and I got the candied jalape√±o and cream cheese burger....both were AMAZING!!! Best buff burger we've ever had!! And the cream cheese burger was insanely good!! The hash on the side is beyond words...it's made with bacon fat, yum! The server was great, they had some great happy hour specials as well. We will FOR SURE be back!!"}
{"text":"Burgers are good but the sides are lacking. If you're looking for a new place to try on the North Side, give it a try. However, I think it's a little pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"Benjamin's is a new bar taking over BRiX's old space (and I believe by the same owners) after zoning issues caused them to close their doors. Their menu is focused, offering about a half-dozen varieties of burger, some available as house-made veggie burgers, and gluten-free buns upon request. Three sides and a few appetizers ranging from pretzels to pate are also on the menu.

The space is narrow, with a large bar sitting on the right half and a handful of tables on the left. At the far end of the bar is where the cooking appears to take place, and beyond that in a separate room is a billiards room(And maybe more, I didn't venture inside). Arriving on a Saturday evening, there were a few sporadic diners, but plenty of space even for a large walk-in party. 

In addition to their full bar, Benjamin's has a beer and wine menu - no drafts though, currently at least. Their can/bottle menu has a few craft and local favorites in addition to common macro selections. The prices are reasonable, and their daily happy hours can make this bar a steal(4:30-6:30 - ranging from $1 PBR to $4 wine).

We started off with the mini pretzels and truffle mustard($2). The truffle mustard was as it sounds: Mustard with a splash of earthy truffle flavor that really comes through. I'm not sure it's my favorite truffle-flavored condiment, but it was tasty. The pretzels themselves appeared to be regular store-bought mini pretzels.

I chose a burger with green chilis, salsa, and chipotle sour cream and a side of home fries($9), while my friend decided on an egg, bacon, and hot sauce mayo burger with slaw($11), both medium.  The food came quickly and immediately the first thing I noticed is that my burger was entirely raw. The server was happy to correct the error and did so quickly. In the meantime I had some of my homefries, which were good, but just homefries. I would really prefer french fries, but I'm not sure they have a fryer here.

My burger came back warm and cooked to a nice medium. Eating these burgers is a messy task - they are juicy to the point of excess and leave your area soaked. Unfortunately, I found the flavor of the burgers to be lacking, and my toppings didn't really didn't add much. My friend agreed that his tasted a bit bland.

Because Benjamin's is new, I would like to go back and give them another shot, but there are a lot of places to get an excellent burger in Pittsburgh, so they're entering a market with some pretty tough competition - especially if their menu remains as focused as it is. I do like their attempt at combining a classy atmosphere with spruced-up blue-collar food, but at some points it felt more like an identity crisis than a synergy. They appear to be working at it constantly, though, so I'm hopeful that in time, Benjamins will shine"}
{"text":"The burgers are really good - it's such an awesome atmosphere. I love sitting by the fire. One tip, as a typical booth sitter, the chairs are awesome. I think they are still getting into the grove and I'm excited to keep going back."}
{"text":"After having tried a couple of their burgers at a yelp event, I was eager to come back with a couple of friends and working colleagues. I called ahead and reserved a table and because we were 10 people, they put us in a room in the back. Now, although it was bit off and out the way, it was not a problem at all for us. Our waitress was one of a kind and really friendly and always made sure we had everything. The reason I give them 3 stars is, because their burgers tasted nothing like the ones I had at the yelp event. I craved their Candied Jalapeno Bacon Burger, but unfortunately it was dry. The meat, the bread, everything. We had so many different kinds of burgers and one person at the table had a chicken Cesar salad. She did enjoy her salad, but the rest was really underwhelmed with what they got in front of them. Their beer selection is okay and also the food is okay, but I wouldn't go out of my way to visit again."}
{"text":"I went here on Sunday, walked in and sat right down. There were people there but nothing crazy. It was not to loud,the Pirates game was on. Everyone was friendly and our order was taken in a timely fashion. I'm not a huge burger person, but I would go here again. I had the bourbon burger. I was over well happy with the visit."}
{"text":"Drive for 45 minutes just to eat a hamburger? (Did I say a very good hamburger?)

Read the feature/review in Thursday's Trib magazine section. First trip, ever, for a specialty hamburger. Certainly will not be the last!

Visited on a Saturday afternoon. Restaurant was just about full. Nice contemporary atmosphere. Very interesting selection of beer from the taps, bottles and cans... yes, cans. Had a little of each!

Burgers were excellent. Cooked exactly as requested. Sides were also very good. Slaw was not typical, much more creative. 

Very good service from the server and bartenders. 

Excellent French press coffee, and the pound cake with blueberries was one of the better desserts I have recently enjoyed.

We have already determined our selections for the next visit. 

Never knew that hamburgers could be this good.

Oh, I should mention that, for a gourmet burger restaurant, no one has any attitude problems.  I have seen too many reviews about poor service with indifference at other places. 

Benjamin's is a fairly new venue. Everyone works hard to deliver a good customer experience. 

Great wine and beer choices. Great food. Great service. What else could you want?
Sure, you can have that too: fair prices for a first-rate meal.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"OMG there burgers are to die for...nothing healthy but so freakin good worth the years of plaque build up on your arteries. Coming from AZ with all the pathetic healthy tuna burgers with gluten free, carb free, low fat, low taste this place is awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Was there for the burgers yesterday.  Very nice burger, perfectly done.  Loved the truffle mustard and red onion combo.  Their mixed drinks need a bit of work. Ordered a Negroni that tasted like straight gin, and a Manhattan that was way too sweet.  The cheese and meat board is pretty decent, although I would like to see some stinker cheeses on rotation."}
{"text":"I didn't even have a chance to eat the food here. I called around 8:30 on a Wednesday night to ask what time the kitchen closed and the told me they stopped cooking around 9 or 9:15. We were about 5minutes away visiting a family member in the hospital and had not eaten. I have wanted to try this place for awhile so we rushed down to get there before the grill got turned off. Walked in the door around 8:50 and was told that the cook turned everything off already so we couldn't even get take out . I will try to eat here again and hopefully give them a better rating but for now i am giving them a two star due to customer service."}
{"text":"Fancy looks, fancy prices.  Not a whole lot of options on the menu.   Got the pork sandwich.  The pork was good, but just not a whole lot of it.   Price per portion is on the high side."}
{"text":"Food was good enough. Didn't care for the home fries. But that's just me. Also no dessert or milkshakes. Baked Brie appetizer was delicious. Waitress and staff were friendly. Would probably go again."}
{"text":"An interesting little place.  They've improved upon the dinnerware since the reviews hating on the paper plates.  They are at least metal now.  I'm still hoping that they'll use real silverware soon, instead of plastic.  The interior is dark and cozy...and they need to bring some aspects of the restaurant up to snuff.  In addition to the silverware, get some decent real storefront windows - don't paint on your logo yourself.  Also, the music was somewhat strange.  Well, okay there was just one song that was of obvious questionable subject matter when in mixed company.  I was with my husband so I just cocked my head, said 'well that's an interesting song to hear at a restaurant'...but I'll tell you the old lady at the next table looked appalled. 

Anyhow...the burgers were REALLY GOOD.  I'd definitely go back again for the burgers.  Juicy, perfectly cooked, seasoned just right.  Love it.  And they have hard cider.  Woot!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice now in the past few months.  Pleasant atmosphere, nice staff, great beer selection and AWESOME burgers.  

So far I have had the \"candied jalapeno cream cheese & bacon\" and \"Fried egg, bacon, potatoes, hot sauce mayo burgers.\"  I ordered both cooked medium, and they were spot on.  

As for sides, I've had the \"curried cabbage cole slaw\" and the broccoli salad.  Both were delicious.  Their soft pretzels with truffle mustard were also very good.

There was a small issue during one of the visits, which is why this isn't a 5-star review.  My friends ordered soft pretzels that never arrived.  Well they arrived eventually, but only after reminding the server.  They received an apology from two staff members.  I'm also pretty sure they weren't charged for the pretzels.

My only suggestion to improve Benjamin's menu would be to add some fancy french fries!"}
{"text":"Benjamin's is a laid-back craft and burger bar with a nice vibe, great service, a very decent beer selection, a nice cocktail list and good food.  They have both a main floor dining room and an upstairs lounge area with additional tables, couches and a few televisions.  The whole place has a very cool ambiance that will have you spending a lot of time in here."}
{"text":"Very nice spot! Great beer selection and extended wine list. They also offer seasonal cocktail list. My boyfriend and I split bunch of apps and had burgers. We were not disappointed!"}
{"text":"Benjamin's has really improved. I went there when it first opened and the food and service were horrible. I went back last night as a lot of people in the neighborhood have been saying it improved. They were right, the food and service is much better these days!  I got their staple item, a burger with bacon fried home fries. Both were very good. The appetizer I got was was shrimp and grits. It was done differently than I have ever seen it, but it was really good."}
{"text":"One of our regular haunts, The Modern Cafe, was packed, and our party couldn't get a table, so our fearless leader suggested we go across the street to this new place, Benjamins, and give them a shot.  It didn't take us long to figure out why this place didn't have as many customers as their neighbor, because the prices seemed ridiculous, although the atmosphere was ever-so-slightly upscaled compared to The Modern.  We arrived at 4:30, which was supposedly happy hour, but we didn't seem to get happy hour prices on the beers and such that we ordered.  Two people from our party ordered the Grilled Cheese sandwich because they didn't have enough money to buy a burger.  Yes, you heard me right.  The burgers were THAT pricy.  The grilled cheese turned out to be very weird - grilled cheese on a pancake?  AND of course, it was ALSO overpriced.  Apparently, our party wasn't the type of clientele that this establishment was interested in, because it took forever to get somebody to take our order, even though the place was mostly empty.  And how long does it take to cook a couple of grilled cheese sandwiches, anyway?  I had a cup of coffee, and nobody ever bothered to ask me if I wanted a refill, so that's all I had.  My friend had a couple of Budweisers with his \"grilled cheese\" thing, plus some home fries that he paid extra for but didn't end up eating because they were greasy, and his tab was over $16.  At one point while waiting for our order, we decided to shoot a game of pool upstairs and left our stuff at the table.  In a few minutes, the same inattentive waitress hunted us down and asked whether or not we were still going to use the table, even though our food hadn't come yet.  She had an attitude about it, even though we were the ONLY people in the place who were using a table.  This surley waitress was training a newbee, and ended up handing a sizeable tip to the apologetic and sincere newbee, and pretty much stiffed the surley one because she treated us like we were poor college kids and not worth her time or effort.  We frequently go out to the restaurants and bars in this neighborhood, and there are some excellent places that we visit often like Nikki's Thai, Peppi's, The Allegheny Sandwich Shop, Georgio's, and of course, The Modern Cafe.  If Benjamins lasts more than a year, I'll be shocked, because neighborhood regulars like us won't be spending any money there."}
{"text":"The BLT Sandwich was the best I've ever had! They were very generous on the bacon as well. Simply delicious!"}
{"text":"I'm not going to lie, I wasn't expecting to give this place a 4. Maybe it was the fact that I had the worst burger of my life earlier in the week at another restaurant, but this place got it right. We came for the Tuesday special of a burger, bourbon and beer for 12.95. I upped my choice and got a specialty burger for 3 dollars more I believe.

I got the jalape√±o cream cheese burger cooked medium. And thank you, it was cooked MEDIUM! Yay! Honestly the flavors were perfect. It wasn't very spicy so and the cream cheese was heavenly. I will say the sides are definitely lacking. My home fries were just eh, and they're cooked in bacon fat so I'd think they would be amazing. 

We also had the meat board as an app, which was very good but for $11 I think it could have been a bit better. 

I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Came in around 1 pm on a Thursday. It wasnt that busy at all. Stood there and no one acknowledged us for about 2 minutes then I actually had to ask if we had to wait to be seated or do we seat ourselves. It seems as if the only waitress/hostess there was the bartender too so maybe someone called off that day.  I was told to wait to be seated, and we were. We were finally asked if we wanted something to drink but by that time we were wanting to get an appetizer. She walked off abruptly after taking our drink order so we didnt order an app. We ordered the good morning burger and another burger that had a burger patty and a lamb hot sausage patty. Although the burger was good, the lamb sausage patty definitely overshadowed the beef. If I went back Id just get the lamburger because it is amazing! It tastes like homeade Italian sauasage but the lamb just takes it another level! The home fries were really good.

Overall the service seems like it can be hit or miss and the burgers were pretty good. I feel like this place is a little pricey but Id go back just for the lamb sausage."}
{"text":"12.95 special for a burger, beer, and bourbon (+$1 for a craft beer and +$1 for a craft burger) is an awesome deal! The burger was surprisingly delicious and the side dishes were quite good. We also got marinated olives (another surprisingly tasty, different take on olives) and a cheese board, which was pretty basic, but had a wide enough range of flavors (bleu to Brie). We really enjoyed ourselves, but the service was a little strange."}
{"text":"The wings taste like smoked brisket hot dogs. I don't think I've ever had wings so disgusting. The pretzels were alright but the side sauces were gross as well. I wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"Yum enough which could of been 4 stars but seriously not gluten free. They either gave me the wrong bread or something is not right and I'm basically fucked for the next 3 days. Gf people avoid! Otherwise cool venue and feels good except for the food being overpriced for what it was and the food not actually being gluten free."}
{"text":"Benjamin's is a solid choice if you're in the Pittsburgh area and looking for a bite to eat. They have a pool and game room in the back if you're interested in hanging out and a lively front room, but might feel a bit grungy. Since I came with a group of 8, they sat us at a table in the back. The service is fast and friendly. While the food is good, I wouldn't say it is miles ahead of any other burger bar. 

Their menu has quite a bit to offer and would be a recommended location for anyone looking to grab a decent bite at a fair price."}
{"text":"Very nice place! It's a small neighborhood joint that has a lot of warmth and ambience. The waiter was very friendly, and even made me a martini based off of what my taste buds wanted at the time. Very strong too by the way :-) For appetizers, we enjoyed the cheese board, smoked salmon and Cured meats. All three were amazing! So many amazing flavors. The Cured meats came with a few slices of homemade pickle slices, and spicy brown mustard. The smoked salmon came with capers and horseradish sauce. The cheese board included salted almonds and pure honey. I didn't have a burger but they have many selections and options. My father in law had one and he described it as amazing! I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Compared to last time I was here, this was a much better experience. I stopped in for brunch last weekend with the intent of having a bloody Mary, only to end up having breakfast and two drinks. First off, Jaime at the bar is a really great server. She's attentive, outgoing, and friendly. She's the type of person that wants you to enjoy yourself and will make sure you do - so props to her. For breakfast, I enjoyed their rendition of lox and cream cheese. Instead of being served with a bagel, it came with two thick slices of toasted marble rye bread. In addition to the bread, an assortment of toppings, including tomato, lettuce, and onion were served. Their jalapeno cream cheese is served on the side as is an aioli sauce (although I felt it was unnecessary). The bloody Mary bar was well stocked and clean. For the alcohol in my drinks, I opted  to try their house infused vodkas. Lastly, I enjoyed chatting with the two female cooks behind the counter. They were extremely friendly and interesting. 

I really wish every time I went to Benjamins was as good as this experience."}
{"text":"Great burger joint!  Perfect for pre and post football game!  

Make sure you ask about the pour on the wines!  We asked about a specific wine and was only told it had been replaced by a different region, but we decided to try it anyway.  What we weren't told was about the size of the pour...yes, it is on the menu, but I expected to be asked if we wanted the 4 oz or 8 oz, or even the entire bottle.  Instead, I was just poured the 8 oz.  After 3 glasses, I basically bought the entire bottle for $40!!  Way too much on this type of wine.  I'm not a wine snob, but I know when a wine is worth that amount of money and this wine was good, but definitely not $40 worth!  Kinda felt like we were duped.  If the waitress had been SPECIFIC about the pour, I would not have ordered three glasses of wine...the fact that it gave me a good buzz is probably what helped them sell me a $40 bottle of wine.  Seriously??!!  Way overpriced.   Good thing the food was good...that's what got this place the 3 stars."}
{"text":"I love burgers so this isn't much of a stretch for me.  If you are looking for a casual dining experience, some nice cocktails, and cheap beer specials then I think Benjamins would do you well.   I keep my burgers simple (American cheese, lettuce, tomato, and mayo), so I haven't strayed too much on ordering anything else.  

I will say that the appetizers that we've order have left us a little wanting.  We did order the cured meat tray, which was billed \"as the best in Pittsburgh\", didn't quite live up to that.  Was good enough, but nothing to live up to that hype.  We also ordered the baked brie, which was tasty but didn't really have that much actual brie in it.  Soft pretzels however are great, as soft pretzels always seem to be.  

Besides my burgers, in which I always order a double, my wife tried the roasted portobello sandwich and Rosemary-Balsamic Goat Cheese & Green Apple burger.  Both were adored.  

The ambiance is great, it's cozy, and warm.  That does have it's downside though.  It can get crowded, and sometimes I do leave smelling a bit like the grill.   None of these negatives have stopped me from going back though, as I've been there 3 times in the last two months."}
{"text":"It's an awesome burger.   Lets be real.  The bread is from bread works.  Score me 5 points.   The burger is a wonderful blend of awesomeness.   Beer selection is outstanding.   Come watch football and have a beer and burger."}
{"text":"Benjamin's is top-notch when it comes to burgers.  They likely have some of the highest quality beef I've ever had in a burger.  The service has always been impeccable and reliable.  Favorite options have been the top shelf cheese and also the mushroom burger.  All the sides round out the meal as a healthy burger + veggie option.  Thanks Benjamin's for turning me onto the burger once again!"}
{"text":"A great alternative to Burgatory or BRGR! I have sat at the bar and at tables and I have had attentive service every visit! The Rosemary Balsamic Goat cheese and green apple burger is my favorite!The flavors compliment each other well and it was cooked medium as I had ordered.The red wine braised onions&truffle mustard burger was also very good.I was not impressed with the buffalo burger though-it was just ok. My boyfriend has also had the fried egg burger which he said was spicy but not overpowering.The burgers are a little pricey but the goat cheese and apple burger is highly worth it-I don't think I could say the same about any of their other burgers however. Of note, each burger comes with a side but fries are not an option. that does not bother me but I know some diners would not be happy. The curry cloeslaw is ok-but if they have the blue cheese potato salad order that-it's awesome! They also have good drafts!"}
{"text":"I decided to go with a burger at Benjamin's and it was the right choice.  I dare say this is the best burger I've ever had in the Burgh!  I went with the mushroom Swiss.  I had it with a side salad which came with homemade ranch dressing, another winner.  And it was nice to watch Benjamin himself running around, seating customers and getting drinks.  He's in elementary school!  All the more reason to support this place!"}
{"text":"Had a solid brunch/lunch here at the bar, as tables were hard to come by due to renovations in the back room. Our party had a black n blue burger, the crab cake eggs Benedict, the Hangover Helper, a bloody Mary with house rosemary-infused vodka, and coffee. It was all delicious. We had to wait a while to pay, but otherwise it was a good trip.

Verdict: Muddy Waters' bloody Mary bar is better, but Bier's eggs Benedict are above Ease's for coming with a token fruit or vegetable (in this case, two slices of tomato)."}
{"text":"If I need runny eggs and toast to dip in my eggs, I want to be at Benjamin's. I understand that other places can make eggs but no one does it like Benjamin's. And the potatoes are better here....and the bacon is perfect. And the coffee mugs rock....and the waitresses are great!  I could go on but I don't the whole world to figure out how great this place is because we will never be able to get in again!!!"}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I were craving burgers for our girls night dinner. This spot was just the ticket! They are known for their burgers, so if it is your first time visiting I highly recommend you check one of those out. I decided to opt for the Top Shelf Cheese burger was some cheddar. Being 8 months pregnant, I needed to make sure that I had no pink in my burger. Thankfully they were able to deliver on this request, as I did not need to send it back to the kitchen. They have several add ons available to those who want to build their own burger instead of choosing one of their pre-made options. The side salad I got was HUGE! They only have two options for dressings which was kind of womp, womp - but that was okay because it was super filling. The pesto pasta salad is a must for a side. If you head to this place in warmer weather, request a patio seat in the back! It is quaint and intimate - great spot to enjoy a dinner with friends or family!"}
{"text":"Benjamin's is good bar/ restaurant on the Northside.  The ambience and use of space is excellent, more restaurant than bar and tastefully done.  The slow roasted pork sandwich reminded me of my mom's pork toast with its moist hint of connsmon.  The sliders with bacon and jalape√±o cream cheese seal the deal.  Perfectly cooked, spicy without being overpowering, and bacon.  Everything is better with bacon."}
{"text":"Stopped here during a bike ride.  Anytime we're on Western Ave, we're going to Carmi, but decided to switch it up today.  

We started wth the Sriracha deviled eggs.  Half of them were good, the other half were as if they ran out of yolk and were half filled so that was weird.  Docking a star for the egg.

Ordered the BBQ burger, got the habanero cheddar instead of the regular cheddar.  Burger was cooked a great medium, super juicy, super flavorful.  We split the burger and had a side salad and the home fries.  Ask for the home fries extra crispy! We did and we're not disappointed.  

Would definitely come back for the burgers!!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love Benjamins. Sounds like they had some growing pains starting out but this is one of my favorite places on the Northside. The burgers never disappoint and the bar is great. Try the burger with the carmelized onions - heaven!"}
{"text":"Minutes from my home and it is my favorite burger place in the North Shore! Pairing it with a beer makes it a dream!"}
{"text":"Bier's Pub is fantastic! Great burgers, particularly the fancy pants burger (in my life I've never enjoyed a burger without cheese... until now). But Bier's Pub doesn't just do burgers well, their drink menu is expansive and most impressively they are the home of War Streets Brewery, which even just starting out serves up some delicious beers. If you're in for the holidays do yourself a favor and get  the Mary Barry Bier. Overall, fantastic food, brews, and service!"}
{"text":"We were in the mood for burgers, and this was the right place to come. All the burgers were cooked perfectly...rare was barely luke-warm in the center and the meat was flat out great. Toppings were very fresh, and the raw onions sweet with no bitter bite. It was served on a fresh roll that was very slightly sweet.  

Sides of broccoli salad were very good but didn't go that well with the burgers. I would order a different side next time.

Draft beer selection was not extensive, but they offered tastings (poured more than fairly) and the beers they had were really good.

We did not have any issues that others mentioned with the service.  It was friendly and efficient even though they were pretty crowded.

A great stop for a great burger."}
{"text":"The selection is quite sparse and what is offered are hamburger patties on buns which are very dense and chewy. The potato salad would be better described as mustard salad and the tepid limp broccoli salad isn't worth the calories.  Stay home or save your money by braving the drive-through at mccdonalds..."}
{"text":"FANTASTIC. The atmosphere and the food are wonderful. When I say the service was slow I don't mean it in a bad way. It gives you time to have a drink and appetizer while looking over the menu, what I mean is I didn't feel rushed.  The burger I had was the Apple & Goat Cheese. I just moved to the North Side and I will visit this place again and again !"}
{"text":"Upon moving to Pittsburgh in 2015, I immediately began my quest to find the best burger in town. I would continuously order my go-to favorite at several burger joints: a medium well cheese burger. Everything was just mediocre. When I found Benjamin's, my mind was blown. Now only is it a quaint little corner restaurant that has an intimate feel, but their food is amazing. I've been here probably a dozen times and it never disappoints. The burgers are always perfect. My favorite sides include the home fries and sundried tomato pasta. I also love the Siracha deviled eggs. Try this place out if you're on the North Side... or make a special trip. It's definitely worth it."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place.  It's nice but just a touch overpriced for me, especially on the North Side.  I was here for lunch on a Saturday but ended up with the brunch BLT and side of homefries.

The sandwich was a little lopsided; all the B was on one side and kept falling off.  I wish I had more L, and the T was one slice in the middle, so I wanted more of that, too.  I really didn't enjoy the chunks of onion.  I'm not talking about a thick-cut ring, or slivers of onion spread on top - there were big chunks of yellow onion just tossed on the bottom of the bun.  I did enjoy the fried egg on top, though.  I love fried eggs on anything!  It added just the right amount of moisture to the bread (a hamburger bun, naturally).

It was busy, so we sat at the bar.  I love sitting at the bar.  I just wish I had the quick service that everyone around me was afforded.  I couldn't decide on a beer when I was first asked what I wanted and I waited until my meal arrived to get a beer - and I had to ask for it.  I wasn't sitting at the far end, I was smack in the middle of the bar and two girls kept walking back and forth but never stopped to inquire if I was ready for a beer yet.  I hate to harp on it, but if I'm paying $9 for a draft, I want $9 service.

I'll be back to try more, but I'll try to come at a slower time and speak up sooner for that beer!"}
{"text":"This place was absolutely awful.  The service was extremely slow and the quality of the food was just terrible.  Hamburgers were extremely undercooked and unseasoned.  A trip to McDonald's would've been a better experience than wasting time going to this restaurant.  If you like the idea of sitting around wasting time and being concerned about the risk of getting e-coli. poisoning I would say it would be fine -- Otherwise, stay away!"}
{"text":"Kind of underwhelming. We walked in and were seated almost immediately on a Saturday afternoon. However, it took a while for our server to come take our drink order. The place wasn't busy so I don't know what was causing the delay. We ordered drinks and a few appetizers. We got the Cured Meats, Cheese Board, and the Pretzels. The Cured Meats had a nice selection, but the Cheese Board left a lot to be desired. There wasn't much to it and I didn't feel it was worth the price they charge. The Pretzels were tasty, the mustard was bold and flavorful, but the jalape√±o cream cheese spread is what took the crown. It was absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"I stopped in here on my visit to Pittsburgh because I love a good burger & the place I stayed recommended this place. 

The city I'm from has a ton of great burger places so I'm slightly spoiled. It was a great place to hang out, have a few drinks, eat, & shoot some pool. 

Upon entering, I noticed the music immediately. Great music was playing that night. It made me want to dance while eating my burger. We were greeted & it smelled delicious. It's nice that this spot is next to a road to where you can watch people, dogs, & cars go by while you eat. Most burger places in my city don't have that.

For the appetizer we decided to have the Baked Brie (Brie, Granny Smith Apple Slices, Roasted Almonds, Wildflower Honey, Crostini). If I lived in the neighborhood, I could probably go here all the time to drink & eat baked brie the night away! 

Looking at the burger menu, I was slightly overwhelmed. In my city, there are gourmet burger places, but most of them have 2 or 3 go-to burgers. This menu... Every single one of them sounded tasty! I decided to go with the Candied Jalapeno Burger (Candied Jalapeno cream cheese & apple wood smoked bacon). The burger was great. My only complaint is that it was a little dry. I normally order my burger medium so that it has pink & plenty of juice. It was still great... it just came out a little more on the medium-well to well side.

This place doesn't serve fries. Instead they have other sides along with Bacon Fat Home Fries(Onions & Poblano peppers). I wish places here in Louisville had that side!

Dessert choice... Brownie Sundae! We weren't able to finish it because we were so stuffed!

The last thing to mention with this place is the beer. Options on tap as well as plenty of cans, bottle, wines, & cocktails to choose from. After eating, we decided to play pool while I had a few more drinks. The staff there was great! I invited them to my city... yeah... when I drink a lot I tend to want everyone drinking & to have a good time with me. I hope I wasn't obnoxious. :-)

I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Stopped by while passing through Pittsburgh on a road trip. So happy we did ! The Beer selection is AMAZING and so is the food. Staff are very friendly too. All around great place."}
{"text":"Pretty decent place. The atmosphere was warm and inviting. My friends and I stopped by on a cold rainy night for a few burgers. 

I felt like being semi-healthy so I ordered the rosemary goat cheese and apple burger but with a veggie patty. I regret ordering the veggie patty because it was not very good. It wasn't terrible, but I've had better. (Ex: kaya, stack'd, burgatory). 

The cheese and apples were delicious, however. I definitely would order again, but with a regular burger!

For my side, I got the ginger broccoli. It is served cold, which I wasn't expecting. It was really good, though!

All in all, good place that I'd be willing to try again."}
{"text":"Bad experience today.     Tues is burger and beer and a bourbon shot. !      12$.     My staff member to busy on his cell phone.     I order a beer doesn't ask if I want to order food !   I finally get another wait staff member I order a burger !   When I get my check it's almost 19$.    And I didn't even get a shot !      It's tues burger night.    So instead of $12 bucks with a shot of bourbon I get a 19 bill with no shot !!   Go figure.   SERVICE is usually great there ,it wasn't tonight and  I won't be back.     The check was fixed when I asked about it but still not offered a shot !!   I WONT BE BACK !!"}
{"text":"Great, flavorful bar/restaurant with a comfortable atmosphere. Four brunches this morning, a couple quiches, a couple lamb sausage and egg entrees, and of course the make-your-own Bloody Mary bar. Everything very good. Nice outdoor dining options in patio or on sidewalks."}
{"text":"Prior to catching Ghost B.C, at Stage AE, I found myself with time to squander, so to Western Avenue I hoofed it wielding a Just Pay Half Hot Card in search of a mighty burger.

As it turned out, Benjamin's no longer accepts the Hot Cards (thankfully, I had funds!), and while I've had mightier burgers, what Benny's is serving up doesn't run away from the likes Burgatory or Tessaro's either. 

Freshly ground and hand-made daily, Benjamin's burgers are a compelling blend of sirloin, brisket (!), and short-rib (!!), creating beefy, bloody, smoky alchemy within mouths and a toasted Breadworks bun. 

Benjamin's offers a number of burger builds as well as salad, snacks, and other types of sandwiches, but I created my own monster of brie, lettuce, tomato, onion, and bacon, shouting giddly \"IT'S ALIVE!!!\" as beads of jus rolled down my fingers upon first munch. Winghart's has a similar burger dubbed The Shipwreck, and it does not compare, my Benjamin's creation acting as the Kraken, pulling it down further into the depths of the ocean. 

The housemade pickles put my taste buds in a trick as they accomplished something I never thought possible: The coins of cured cucumber were sweet, sour, and a little spicy simultaneously, causing my eyes to roll like a slot machine  as I bit into each jarred medallion. 

The bacon fat homefries had an off-putting dryness to them, and despite what the menu said, I detected no lardy flavors in the underseasoned tuber cubes.

Nonetheless, I took in some of the Pirates game at the dark, wooden bar, one comfortably co-opted by locals, politely spurning the advances of tipsy middle-aged women as I conquered yet another Liberty Steak, pondering what a blasphemous North Shore Good Friday evening Papa Emeritus II had on the dimming horizon for this Catholic boy gone astray...

P.S. The service was adequate overall even if it took some time for the bartender to warm up to me (he came off as a tad curt at first). He seemed to know all the other patrons, though. 

P.P.S. Benjamin's is the brainchild of Paul Tebbets, formerly of the defunct wine bar known as Brix.

P.P.PS. I'll vouch for the men's bathroom as it was quite nice. I usually don't mention restrooms in my reviews unless they're abominable or spotless or unusual, so take it from a pro."}
{"text":"The menu is outstanding! Our server was helpful and talkative, we enjoyed hearing about the plans for the restaurant. The burger I got was delicious, hard to believe it was turned out by a two person kitchen staff located in a small open area of the bar."}
{"text":"Visited twice. Menu items are varied and good. They have a big list of brews. Lunch crowd is brisk.
I really enjoyed the burger w egg for a brunch. Quiet out if the way spot off peak hours."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a bite and a brew.  

Great spot to have some good times in the neighborhood.  There were many having some fun on the Pool Table in the back room.  

The beer and wine list are not long but there are some good selections.  
The menu is limited.   The burgers are hand made using a custom blend of sirloin, brisket and short ribs.  Cooked on a little grill at the end of the bar.  
The Fired Egg, Bacon, Potatoes, Hot Sauce Mayo Burger was tasty and juicy.  A two napkin burger.  The potatoes were tasty.  The mayo on the burger was limited or almost nonexistent, had to ask for a little more.  My associate had the Portobello Mushroom & Swiss burger, said it was delicious."}
{"text":"Benjamin's was a real find. Their unique blend of ground on-site burgers gives a great, one of a kind flavor. Service was excellent, friendly, and very knowledgeable. Decent gluten free bun (hard to find)"}
{"text":"I went to Benjamin's with some friends. The small restaurant was crowded, and although we were told that it'd be an hour wait, there were plenty of seats at the bar. The menu is small, focusing only on burgers and a few sandwiches. I ordered the wine braised onions with trouffle mustard burger. The burger came out perfectly cooked. The meat was perfectly seasoned and all of the flavored complimented each other so well. Hands down, this is the best burger in the Burgh!!"}
{"text":"Wife and I were in Pittsburgh looking to buy a house and we stopped in at Benjamins for diner.
I had a bacon cheeseburger with lettuce and tomato and home fries.
They were out of Corona so I had a beer on tap sorry do not remember name but it was good.
The hamburger was among the best I have ever had and was totally delicious.
The home fries were equally good.
The service was excellent and fast and friendly.
I would definitely recommend Benjamins for all your burger needs.
I would not hesitate going back again."}
{"text":"Let's say you want to watch a hockey game, drink a beer, and eat a burger. This is the place for you. I don't watch hockey, I don't drink beer, and I don't eat red meat, and even still I found Benjamin's lovely. The veggie burger made of chickpeas is slightly dry, so do yourself a favor and get it with a sharp cheese (I got the blue cheese), tomatoes, lettuce, and onions. The hamburger received rave reviews from my dining companion (he order the one with bacon, a fried egg, and sriracha-- what a combination!)The burgers come with a choice of sides ranging from a carrot coleslaw to homefries (cooked in bacon fat) to a tomato and basil pasta salad. In short, you won't be stuck with a boring plate of limp fries. The service is friendly and efficient, the food is cheap (two burgers for $20, way cheaper than DC), and the space, while slightly loud, is charming."}
{"text":"This place is charming and has a great selection with uniquely wonderful offerings.  It is not very large. I had the soft pretzels, green apple and goat cheese burger, and broccoli salad. My spouse had the cheese burger and bacon fat home fries. The waitress was friendly and attentive. The pretzels were perfect. Warm and soft with mustard and jalape√±o butter, yum. The broccoli salad was good, but needed to be cut smaller and seasoned more. In fact ever part of our meal was woefully under seasoned. The burgers especially under seasoned. They were cooked perfectly and piled very high with our preferred topping, but the buns were cold. Also the bacon fat home fries were just bland and no crispy bits, salt, pepper, or onions. The tested like greasy baked potatoes. I'll probably go again  I'll just ask for a salt shaker."}
{"text":"The burgers are delicious.  They are very juicy and many unique options for toppings.  It is a large burger so you will definitely leave full.    The Brie appetizer was also very good."}
{"text":"Had the jalape√±o cream cheese and bacon burger. Was a little hesitant but the jalape√±o cc made this burger an amazing combination of taste and spice. Wife had a portobello mushroom Swiss burger on a gluten free bun. Little girl ate the biggest BLT we ever saw along with the burgh fried egg on the sandwich  as awesome as the food was the service from Alana was even better and that says a ton cause the food couldn't have been any better."}
{"text":"I ate here with a co-worker while on a business trip. The burger was amazing and the service was very friendly!  Desert was an Oreo mousse cake- delicious- I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We have been going to Benjamin's for a few years now and this is by far our favorite burger joint in the Burgh!  We found this place by going to a Yelp event years back where we got to try a lot of their food menu items.  After that event we knew we had to come back and try it out for ourselves.  We did and we just keep coming back.

     You have to park on the street for Benjamin's but we have never had a hard time finding street parking.  We usually park at the most a block away.  If you come here on Sunday's or after 6pm it's free to park on the street in Pittsburgh.
When you walk in the bar is along the right side or you can seat down at a table on the left if you prefer that.  There is a nice area in the back part of the restaurant to lounge and eat at a table as well but we always go straight to the bar to eat!

     These burgers are great and that's why we travel from the burbs to come all the way here.  We used to order their shrimp and grits as an appetizer to start but we don't anymore.  My wife got an allergic reaction after eating them and I had to run and I mean literally run to Rite Aid to go get her some Benadryl.  I'm sure it was nothing that they did but she just had a bad reaction so we haven't ordered that since.  

     My wife loves their Candied Jalapeno Burger.  She always thinks she should try something else but just like our recent visit I told her if it isn't broke don't fix it!  So she ordered it again and loved it.  I usually go with the BBQ burger.  This last time I went with their Kentucky Bourbon instead.  Their burgers are so good I just didn't' want the bbq to take from the flavor.  I made the right choice.  This burger was so juicy and just right.  I'll be ordering it the next time we visit.  

     The one complaint that I have would be their side dishes.  They have a bar side grill that they do all their cooking on.  That's great and I like that there are no fryers or fried food.  Just I still want some fries with my burger.  I eat healthy usually so maybe even baked fries or sweet potatoes fries would work.  That's the only thing missing for me here at Benjamin's.  

     The bar area is nice and they have one TV in the front of the bar and two in the back.  Probably not the best spot to watch a game but it's still decent.  The bartenders are usually good and they seem nice.  We have noticed that they do get caught up in conversations or watching jeopardy while  on the job but I still love this place.

     If you're tired of all of the chain restaurant burgers and want a truly great burger come to Benjamin's.  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I love the burgers at Benjamin's, but I have to talk about the brunch I had on a recent Sunday there. I'm not certain if the full menu -- in addition to the brunch menu -- was available because it was Pittsburgh Marathon weekend, but that was a nice surprise. And a couple people at my table took advantage, getting breakfast burgers for their late brunch. A couple others ordered omelettes, which looked dense and delicious, more like a frittata. Me? Easy choice -- buttery shrimp and grits. Spectacular.

Most of us took advantage of the bloody Mary bar -- extensive list of goodies to add, several different mixes (and spice levels) to serve as bases and a long list of vodkas -- including a few they'd infused on their own -- make the bloody bar a mandatory stop on a Sunday morning.

Finally, I have to say I was impressed with the service. Benjamin's was jammed not long after the marathon had passed through Western Avenue, but the folks helping us did a good job of keeping our glasses full and making sure our food got out in a reasonable amount of time. 

I'll always be willing to go back to Benjamin's for a burger. I'm happy to say I have a great neighborhood option for brunch as well."}
{"text":"This is a great neighborhood restaurant to go to on the northside. The meat and cheese plates are to die for - great portions for an incredibly reasonable price. The pretzels are also incredible; three large pieces with a spicy cheese sauce and mustard sauce. Solid drinks. Next time will definitely try the burgers."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Benjamins, and it will not be my last. The menu had a variety of burgers, sandwiches, and mouth-watering starters. Our table kicked things off with an order of the pretzels and dipping sauces. The pretzels themselves were nothing out of the ordinary; however, the candied jalape√±o cream cheese was the perfect blend of spicy and sweet. The Fancy Pants was my burger of choice for the night, and it did not disappoint. The red wine braised onions were a welcomed change from the typical caramelized onions you find elsewhere. Regrettably, I opted for the pasta salad, which left me immediately wishing I had gone for the home fries. Oh well, there's always next time. 

One unfortunate aspect of the dining experience was the flies traveling through the front doors and violating my personal space. Though it's nice to have outdoor seating available to customers, please try to keep the insects from bugging the indoor patrons."}
{"text":"Finally!!! I've experience what all of the rage had been about.
I had the candied jalape√±o burger and thought I was being orbited into space; spice space that is!
What an absolutely delicious piece of art that is this burger.
My mouth is watering thinking about the experience as my stomach yearns for the next visit.
Cute little bar/restaurant that packs in the people. Make reservations if you can."}
{"text":"I'm so glad that when Bier's took over Benjamin's they kept the same menu, because I thought the former had fantastic burgers. Probably one of the best in the Burgh. 

Thankfully, this still holds true. The burger is phenomenal. Just thinking about it makes my mouth water. Honestly, a good burger starts with good meat, and I do believe they purchase quality meat. I asked for my burger medium, and it came out more medium rare. No biggie though, because it was still delicious. Just go up one notch depending on how you like your burger. I usually ask for medium because it can vary from place to place. 

The BBQ burger I ordered had a tangy sauce and cheese. Plus, I was so happy to have a complete burger, since they offer gluten free buns. Thanks guys! Great to have a normal burger somewhere, even while being gluten free. I also got the side of whiskey baked beans, which were very tasty as well.

The sad part to this story is I can't try their beers, but my hubby really liked his. Again, thanks Biers for making the smart decision to not only offer GF buns, but carrying local gluten free Auroch's beer. I was so happy to have a beer with my burger! Can't wait to do it again soon."}
{"text":"I had a burger with manchego cheese, onions, lettuce, and tomato, and the home fries as a side. The burger was very good, juicy and well-seasoned. I was also excited about manchego being an option to top the burger, amongst the stand options of provolone, cheddar, and bleu. It's worth mentioning that the onions were also seasoned and lightly fried, which added a nice flavor other than raw onion. Decent selection of beers, though what I initially chose was out at the time. Service was a bit slow, but the chef came to our table and took our orders himself, which we really appreciated. If I'm in town again I wouldn't mind stopping by ."}
{"text":"Took the family in on a Saturday afternoon, we were the only people there at that hour so the service was attentive. They were very helpful about finding ingredient lists for one of us with multiple food allergies, and it was awesome that they had options for him. Burgers were quality beef, cooked up nice and juicy, on very nice buns. They were a bit pricey but not ridiculous, and they were quality. We all left satisfied. Food was served on a metal pie plate lined with waxed paper, and utensils were metal (not plastic.)
I only wish that they had regular french fries, and that we had asked to have the fireplace turned on."}
{"text":"Stopped in to grab something quick, fresh and light . Ordered a side of Pesto Pasta salad which was not fresh and tasted dry and boring. Also way too many gnats flying around our table and around food . Some even landed in our beers. Huge turn off when you see bugs surrounding your food at a restaurant . Please do something about this."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I have ever had. It's fresh and it's juicy. The only complaint I would have are about the limited choice of side dishes. I understand the limited space is the reason ,but it still needs to some how get fries on the menu. This is the second time I ate there , and both times were good. I would highly recommend"}
{"text":"I came here for the first time a month ago and have been back 3 times since because it was so good! I had heard that this was the \"best burger in town\" and after testing it out, I think I agree with this sentiment. I have tried both the rosemary gouda burger and the red-wine braised onion burger and both were fantastic. Every burger on the menu sounds appealing, so I will work my way down the list. The service has not been consistent but on my last visit it was great, plus I don't might sacrificing great service for a great burger. Each burger comes with your side of choice - I'm not sure you can go wrong here but the pasta salad is a nice alternative to fries. Also, the brie and honey appetizer is absolutely delicious - if that is your type of thing don't pass it up!"}
{"text":"Urban legend has it that the owner's renamed the wine bar formerly known as Brix, \"Benjamins\" because they poured so many 100 dollar bills into the renovation project!  You can see where the money went, it's got a chill, but beautiful vibe with a roaring fireplace, exposed brick walls, tons of great art, a friendly knowledgeable staff and a pool table and plush couches in the well styled back lounge.

The menu is broken up into 3 sections \"Not Burgers\", \"Burgers\" and \"Snacks\".  The specialty burgers are as creative as they are delicious, I got the MASSIVE fluffy apple and rosemary goatcheese \"fat boy\" 14 oz burger, and it was as tasty a burger as I've ever had.  Between Brgr, Burgatory, Tessaros and Winghearts, trendy gourmet burger bars are big in the burgh, and Benjamins brings a free spirited, unpretentious but high class twist to the game.

I ate at Benjamins Wednesday night, and I'm already enlisting friends to bring when I go back this weekend.  I'm not much of a wine connoisseur, and Benjamins has a nice wine list and very well stocked micro brew list to wash down their killer burgers.  I'm sorry Brix Wine Bar didn't work out, but Benjamins has risen like a phoenix from ashes to create something even better!"}
{"text":"I had a burger with Apple and goat cheese...the others also had burgers and everyone lived them. The atmosphere is fun and the staff is most accommodating."}
{"text":"This chic artsy rustic place has great food but most importantly the warmest, kindest staff with the best vibes! Tonight's cocktail was the cherry on top of another amazing time at Biers!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Benjamin's for a while now, and I had the chance to suggest it when I had dinner with friends last Friday.  It was a nice day and we were lucky enough to snag the last outdoor table which was great.  The place was pretty packed but not so bad that one would feel uncomfortable though it was getting more crowded by the time we left around 8:00 PM or so.

We go there in time for the tail end of happy hour plus they had their sangria on special, so I ordered that and we ordered the pretzels appetizer which was half off and which came with their candied jalapeno cream cheese and truffle mustard.  The pretzels were warm and soft but the star of the dish was the jalapeno cream cheese.  It was so good that I saved the little remaining bit to have with my burger.  The mustard that came with the dish was also great, but we were all clamoring for the jalapeno cream cheese, which made me wish that I'd ordered the burger that comes with it, but I will do that next time.  

For our burgers 2 of us got the veggie burger which was honestly close to the best veggie burger that I've ever had in my life.  I will definitely go back there.  I got the Buffalo Blue burger with the veggie patty and overall, the sauce must have gotten soaked into the veggie burger because it was completely dry and hardly there so and had very little buffalo sauce flavor, I was happy that I still had some of the jalapeno cream cheese, but the burger itself was tasty.  My friend got the Goat Cheese and apple veggie burger and really liked it though she felt that the amount of shredded apple on top was excessive (it was) and took at least half of it off.  Her husband got the fancy pants with beef burger and he enjoyed it.  My friend and I got the broccoli salad as our side dish and while it was okay I felt like the broccoli was way overcooked to the point where it was kind of too mushy so I really didn't enjoy that.  My friends husband got the potato salad as his side, and said that it was fine, but nothing great.

So, overall we really did enjoy our burgers and appetizer and will definitely go back, but we may try different side dishes and options the next time and maybe it will hit 5 stars."}

Ordered the soft pretzels, just to try out two dips that intrigued us - the candied jalape√±o cream cheese and the truffle mustard. I was not a fan of the cream cheese because I don't like the heat, but my husband took it down! The truffle mustard was good, more of a finely-ground, stone-ground mustard that had a smooth finish. Smacked the sour and bitter taste buds all around! 

Our meal was a split burger and side - the BBQ burger and the broccoli salad. 

My thoughts on the burger:
The first thing I noticed was the doneness; as I cut the burger in twain, the juices flowed into the lower bun and onto the plate. YES. This is a medium rare burger! Probably the first correct one I've had all summer!
Next, the bacon. 
Thick strips of bacon, not too over-peppered, and still with a bit of chewiness. Tasty. 
The BBQ suave was on the savory side, most notably from the pepper, then what I think is a smidge of onion powder. All mingling together nicely on this fine burger. 
The bun: surprised it wasn't toasted, but that is all. 

Broccoli Salad:
Boasting a soy-wasabi dressing, this chilled salad rocks the salty buds. It is truly covered with this sauce, assumably, it's been brining/marinating in it. Mostly soy sauce flavored, it didn't have the wasabi punch I was expecting. Good, nonetheless. 

I suggest giving this place a try. My hubby and I are taking the afternoon to compare this and Bubba's in Bridgeville (both new to us). We'll let you know the winner later!"}

{"text":"Got a regular burger  with Sharp cheddar. Good stuff good service. Good vibe. Wish they had fries. I'm sure they want to kill everyone that says that. But I'd recommend trying this place and looking forward to going back."}
