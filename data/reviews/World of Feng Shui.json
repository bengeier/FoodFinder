{"text":"Very cool feng shui store. They even do consultation over the phone and will try to help you look for exactly what you need. And everything in the store is labeled and has an explaination!"}
{"text":"5 stars cause I love to improve my well being and state of mind! Ha! But really 5 stars because its the best Vegas has. Nice place to visit, cool stuff all around. For me its hard to walk around inside this place because I am always afraid to bump into stuff and knock something over. Thats just me though... I will take pics next time because I am amazed that nobody has taken pictures from here. Lots of things are expensive, but like Marissa F said, \"Some very nice, albeit expensive pieces, but there is something affordable here for anyone looking to balance their chi. \" -True."}
