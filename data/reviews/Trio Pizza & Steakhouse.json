{"text":"Trio's pizza is amazing. I stop here on every visit to Calgary. The pizza isn't greasy, and it tastes fresh. There's something about the sauce that tastes so good--it has kick. I usually do pick-up, but I've eaten inside once. It's nothing fancy. The restaurant is fairly small. The pizza keeps calling me back though. When I get cravings for pizza, I seriously consider driving down from Edmonton just to get Trio's!"}
