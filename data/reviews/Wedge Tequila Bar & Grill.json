{"text":"There were a lot of choices for tequila, however, maybe a total of 3 ounces in the very well Iced drink.   The chips were interesting but the dips we had were very good and flavorful.  I had the steak tacos with black beans, rice, and some kind of pickled medley.  The place was almost dark as there was no lighting at the tables nor above us and we had to use our iPhone flashlights to read the tiny writing on the menus.   My meal was cold.   The bill was wrong but we worked it out amongst ourselves to get it right.  For $40 I don't think I'll be going back."}
{"text":"The taco flight of 5 smaller tacos for $12 is a great deal. I immensely enjoyed the fried avocado (Monday's taco). The tinga pollo was very good. Pastor was good. Bacon was very salty. Camaron was a little disappointing. They tend to be pretty salty which I found a little distracting. Good vibes, reasonable prices. The cheesy burrito looked so good. I had dinner envy the entire night."}
{"text":"it was extremely loud and it took forever to get our food.  i'll try this place another time, but this visit wasn't up to par."}
{"text":"I really like Wedge's food, customer service and ambiance. I've been here over 5 times with friends and have never been disappointed. Their food is great- they did recently redo their menu so some of the items I ate regularly earlier were discontinued, which was a bummer. They have a ton of different tacos to choose from- you can mix and match for a \"taco dinner\". Burritos are also great- they've always willingly made me non-meat dishes by removing the meat (which were on the menu as meat dishes) since I'm vegetarian. I've never had a bad experience here with the food or the staff. They also have some outdoor seating under a cute canopy of lights which is great for the summer months. They do tend to get pretty crowded, busy and loud some evenings with large groups of people- so the service would be slower than usual, but it wasn't terrible."}
{"text":"Awesome experience eating here! Food never disappoints and last time we went there our server Jimmy was knowledgeable and funny! Their drinks are always well made, especially anything with tequila in it. I recommend having a lime margarita or strawberry pineapple tequila shot. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"\"The Abstract\": There are better places in town - Maize #1, by far, Huaraches Moroleon #2. Chipotle #3. Not exactly trendy, but the food is better at those places.   Was this worth a \"date night\" with my husband ? Not really. When you have to pay for a baby-sitter a date night better be worth it! Wedge was more miss than hit for us, and while it wasn't terrible, it just isn't worth a repeat for us, especially since we can't really come here with our son - too bar-like b/c most of the tables have high bar stools. There are better (casual and pricy) places for a date in C-U.   Pros: The server was great! Mixed up a fancy N/A juice for me since I'm pregnant.   The fish tacos- very good- loved the sauce especially. But go easy on the cabbage! The steak tacos w/ poblano - good.  Beer prices were reasonable.  Meh:  Tacos al Pastor - decent, but not worth a repeat visit, IMO.  Guacamole - decent flavor- a bit too acidic, not enough salt.  Cons:  Chips and salsa are NOT free - it's $3 for an order!  Beans - fresh out of a.... Can. So easy to make good beans, no excuses here.  Guacamole price was high compared to other places around town (and yes, I know the cost of an avocado $0.90-1.79/each- esp owning the El Toros in town, I'm sure the owners get them cheaper than we can at Meijer. Price was $6 for a small portion that was *maybe*a single avocado.   Seated right by the door - kept getting interrupted so servers could get liquor out, new patrons walking in - it was freezing! Forget a  nice date - we were cold and felt *very* rushed. If you want to get drinks and linger, or dessert, sit in the back. If you want a Jimmy Johns \"Freaky Fast\" experience, sit in the front.   Carnitas taco - absolutely disgusting. It tasted like the meat was rotten. The nuts were whole and just didn't work  - would be better chopped up, but they dont' really add to the taco. This actually made me feel sick. My husband agreed."}
{"text":"Went to Wedge for the first time last week will definitely come back. I ordered a burrito it was a very generous portion. The food was really good but the management was better, if that is possible. We walked in, were seated right away and the waitress was great. We never had an empty drink glass at the table the whole night, the infused tequila was awesome. I asked for the manager, Kate came out and I told her about my great experience. Hope theres more managers like this in town cause alot of places need her."}
{"text":"When the Fuentes brothers want real Mexican food... they go to Maize!  The food is OK.  But claiming to be \"the spirit of Mexico\" means more  have a large selection of tequila.  For one, change the salsa and merenge music for Mariachi and Norten~as.  Second, salsa should be served automatically with any tacos order.    Pros: the food and drinks were well priced."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Definitely the best margarita in town. I really enjoy their special tacos on Fridays-shrimp tacos- my favorite. Great service, never ever a bad experience."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Great vibes especially when you can sit on the patio. Mexican burger is my favorite from the tortas but the tacos are great if you want something a bit lighter. Margaritas are good too but strong so beware haha"}
{"text":"If I could give my experience at Wedge zero stars, I would. I have been many times before and had a good experience, but last night was horrible. A group of friends and I chose to sit inside because outside was super crowded. Our server came to us, and asked us our drink order. She would not let my friend order a virgin drink, because \"sweetheart it tastes bad.\" My friend even said I do it all the time ( and we have done it before at wedge), and she still just shook her head no. Ok fine, so we stuck to water. Then it came time to put in our food order and all six of us ordered, and I ordered nachos. Ten minutes later our food comes, and one friend gets soup and I get tacos. I practically have to chase her down to tell her that no one ordered soup and I ordered nachos. She snatches away the tacos and soup and tells me \"sweetheart it will be a few minutes.\" I tell my friends to start eating, and 15 minutes later she comes back with ice cold nachos. Plops that down and walks away. It took you 25 minutes to get me nachos, but why were they cold?! On numerous occasions our server was just standing at the bar area, not doing her job! There were maybe 3 tables inside that needed service and she was exclusively an indoor server! Our water glasses were empty for almost 15 minutes before my friend kindly asked for a refill, and she looked at us silently, walked away, came back with a water carafe slammed that onto the table and walked away. Sweetheart, you don't go into the customer service business if you do not know how to provide even adequate customer service. Our server was just very rude, inattentive, and gave us major attitude for absolutely no reason. Another example of her incompetency, one friend asked for no sour cream with her quesadilla, our server answered with major attitude: \"you know it comes in the middle right.\" Meaning the middle of the plate, and so you can't just write no sour cream on your note pad?! My friend said I know, but the server just stared at her so when the time came there was sour cream on her plate. The best part of this whole experience was at the end our server was suddenly sappy sweet and told what a pleasure it was to serve us--ummm no you sucked. And your nasty niceness at the end did not help your tips, sweetheart."}
{"text":"I am from Indiana and located this restauant on Yelp. I was in town for a friend's event and I was excited to find a tequila bar. Online the menu shows several infused and flavored tequilas which I was looking forward to trying. On arrival we learned they have changed their menus and none of these are available. So instead we got margaritas which were good but overpriced for the size $9 each for the size of a small martini. Tacos were Awesome! Chips were greasy and bland. Go for the tacos but not if your looking for infused tequila... their web site is inaccurate and needs updating."}
{"text":"I had the tamale dinner.  Among the best tamales I've had in Champaign.  I might have to do a blind test against El Charro.  Good red pepper margarita.  Guac a little disappointing, kind of bland.  Nice ambiance, good prices, good service."}
{"text":"Recently went to Wedge and it wasn't the best dining experience. The food was very overrated and overpriced, with small portion sizes. The service was mediocre and the seating was very uncomfortable. I will say the alcohol selection and bar setup is very nice."}
{"text":"Always amazing tacos and food, especially love the taco of the day. But I regretfully can't rate it any better, the old fashion was sickenly sweet and the sangria were very watery. For a bar that's just not okay. If your only having beer and food, this place is awesome, but if you want a cocktail or a Margarita go elsewhere. They do have an extensive tequila offering, so if you drink your tequila straight, there is that."}
{"text":"Stopped by on a chilly evening to meet some friends for a birthday party. I would not recommend this restaurant for a group outing as there are very few tables that seat over 4 people. I would recommend (the) Wedge for a date, however! It is cozy and the atmosphere is lively. Servers were attentive and didn't mind our party being laid back about ordering. I tried a delicious añejo, the guacamole, and a pastor taco. The drinks are reasonably priced for the location and atmosphere, and the bartenders/waitstaff are educated about the drink menu. The guacamole comes in a very small portion but it was quite good (I found the chips to be greasy though). The tacos were tasty.. perhaps not as authentic as el charro or maize but decently priced at $3 for what you get (quite a filling portion and the taco was piled with lots of extras, including roasted pineapple and chile de arbol salsa--yum!).   I'm not sure that I will be back immediately but it's a worthwhile spot to check out if you want something a little different for the area."}
{"text":"BEST MEXICAN FOOD I'VE HAD. I got the chicken mesquite fajitas, each bite was better than the last! I also had the autumn berry margarita- unique and delicious. I will definitely be back for the great service, great atmosphere, and especially the great food!"}
{"text":"Disappointing. I wonder if this place imagines itself more as a tequila bar than a restaurant. We went there for a meal. I like fish tacos (some people think it's an odd combination), but this was so overcooked I could barely bite through it. The black bean side was good. The pickled vegetables I think I liked the idea more than the executable. Rice was bland.   My dinner companion said his salad was just OK and didn't even bother to finish his margarita.   The potato wedge appetizer was good and the aioli was nicely spicy.  All in all, it was just ok. I'd probably go back, but I'm not in any rush."}
{"text":"There's a cute little tequila bar on Neil st and inside this bar you can find a handful of trendy students having a good time over great drinks. The bar tenders are cute and friendly with their own edgy styles. The wait staff, young and professional with good knowledge of menu items.   I decided to give this place a try after reading reviews on it. It was a grey cloudy day and it had just finished raining, as cute as it looked, outside seating was out of the question. But just to let you know, it is available.   It is a seat yourself place, So I plopped at the bar, quickly greeted and met with a drink menu. By the by, all cocktails are only $6 on hump day..    I love me some margaritas. The spicy pineapple margarita was my choice tonight and I had that to enjoy while looking over the menu. Finally decided to have the steak torta, carnitas taco, chips and ranchero guacamole.   There was no stagnant wait time to place my order as the bartender was very attentive despite the semi crowded bar. It was about give minutes later, boom, my chips come out. The chips are a crunchy kind of good. There are three kinds of guacamole in which I ordered the chunky spicy kind. It was a perfect accompaniment with my drink and anticipation for my meal.   Before I can get halfway down my drink and just as I got over the chips, tada... Here comes my food. The timing couldn't be any more spot on.   The steak torta was very tasty. It was seasoned and moist with the toasted bread just crisp. The sandwich was pretty darn good. On the plate were also potato wedges that came with aioli dip. Without the dip, the wedges were.. meh. It's all about that dip.   Done with my first drink, I gave the bar tender a nod and boom another one came. Completed my steak, on to my taco. The carnitas or pork, was a bit dry and it was just ok. Following the steak, it wasn't great. Finished it anyway, dipped it in the guac and poured salsa on it. That did the trick.   Munched on the chips some more as I wrote this review.   The environment is clean, friendly and inviting. The wait staff is awesome. The food is great. And the prices are reasonable. The music is trendy and relatively current.  I would come back here again for sure.   The restroom , sit or squat.   I give it a sit!"}
{"text":"Love the Cameron tacos & had great service! We enjoyed the drinks and loved learning about the different types of tequila they have to offer."}
{"text":"Good tamales Cactus ROCKS the house!"}
{"text":"To start off, the place is small and quaint. I could see this as being a successful eatery if they had proper management. The guacamole was basically out of a bag. I don't mind spending money if the product I'm getting is worth it. The food was decent.  This place has a lot of potential but the management is very lacking. There were about 5 employees sitting around and just one person waiting the whole restaurant. Manager was just at the bar having a drink, very unprofessional.  Next time I'll stick with the original El Toro."}
{"text":"We had such high hopes! It's a cute restaurant with a lot of ambiance. All the signs of 'winner.' Unfortunately it ended being a disappointing experience! We ordered a number of dishes and everything was bland or awful. The chips were stale, the ceviche flavorless, the salsa watery, and the wedge salad was the worse we ever had. (How do you mess up a wedge salad? ). On top of the bad food....service was slow. And, we sat on the patio next to a chain smoker. On our way home we stopped by another restaurant to 'erase' the bad memories from our palates. We normally enjoy dining out downtown was bar far the worst experience we've ever had."}
{"text":"Not your everyday Mexican restaurant; Wedge offers a very stylish bar scene with a unique twist on your typical Mexican food. The fish tacos were AMAZING! My boyfriend tried the shrimp, and we both agreed that the tilapia tacos were better. (I even indulged in a pomegranate margarita afterwards!) Overall great first impression!!"}
{"text":"The food tries its best to be upscale, though I'm not really buying it. The Tacos Pastor and the sandwiches are pretty good, but not super-fancy and a bit small for the price. The place is also a bit tiny, and if you've got a group larger than four, good luck getting seats.  Why four stars, then? Because this place has a ton of tequila, and a lot of really good choices. I was a huge fan of the tequila flights (I sprung for a Reposado flight my first time there) and they've got a bar full of bottles you can't get anywhere else. I've found it annoying that I can't get a plain old margarita in the past, and then I remember that I can get a glass of Riazul for $6 and I shut right up. If you're looking to do tequila shots with the limes and the salt and the children in Campustown, this isn't going to do much for you. But if you're looking for a nice place to sit back and enjoy tasting a spirit that people normally don't sip, it's awesome."}
{"text":"I am so pleased we decided to try this place. They are under new management since 2015 and the results are amazing. First, the service was excellent. Clayton and Grace are fantastic. Second, the margaritas and tequila selections are amazing!! Clayton made the best with the best. The Pear Margarita was refreshing. Not sure what to say about the Strawberry Pineapple Margarita (with basil) other than fantastic. Third, the food was great. Fresh ingredients. We had quesadillas and the pastor tacos. So good! Do not pass on this place because of past reviews."}
{"text":"What's the best way to conclude a Friday night reunion with your sorority sisters? A night of tacos at Wedge! Or so I thought ...  I have lived in the Urbana-Champaign area for three and a half years due to attending the university and have never experienced Wedge. With that being said, I was more than happy to have the opportunity to try out the menu. Plus, who doesn't love a good taco? On that night, myself and a few others found an angled parking spot across from the outside patio, which was a great space although it was too cold to sit outside. We walked around to the front, went through the double doors and seated ourselves once we found our group. My group had a reservation for about 20 people that all arrived within a few minutes of each other and we were seated at a combination of tables to make a longer one.  Within a few minutes, we were warmly greeted by a waitress and asked our drink orders. We all ordered water and unfortunately did not receive that or the menus for another 15 minutes. When those two things arrived, we thanked the waitress and began perusing the options. I chose the steak nachos which consisted house-made tortilla chips, cheese sauce, and chorizo for the price of $9.50. Sour cream, pico de gallo, guacamole would be brought out on the side.   FOREWARNING: Nachos are described as enough to fill you up while at the restaurant, but don't expect leftovers!  After waiting over 35 minutes to place the order and numerous cups of water later, the ONE waitress returned to take all 20 orders by herself. We then waited over 40 minutes for the food to be placed and multiple things were forgotten. The steak nachos were seasoned well and the chips were fresh, but essentially the meal was not worth ten dollars. Chipotle would provide more than the plate for just $7.   At no point during the visit were we checked on and repeatedly had to ask the waitress for essentials such as water, napkins, new silverware, etc. However, she immediately rushed to our sides to distribute/retrieve the checks without giving a formal goodbye.  Overall, the lack of service is what ultimately resulted in the three star review. I hope that I can try Wedge again on a different weekday at an earlier time and hopefully will be able to give a different summary."}
{"text":"We have been to Wedge a couple of times and I expect we will enjoy a margarita there next time we are in Champaign-Urbana as well. The food is good - nothing remarkable, but tasty. The infused tequila margaritas are the real gems. I love the spicy pineapple margarita made with habanero-infused tequila; my family members, however, prefer the jalapeño- infused tequila. Fast service; friendly and attentive servers even when they are busy. It is a fun casual place to enjoy a unique cocktail."}
{"text":"Wow.  I was disappointed by Wedge.  I had high hopes for this, and my spouse and I went here for a nice date night.  The restaurant was packed, and the tables were way, way too close together - our chairs kept bumping into the tables behind us, and the waitress was tripping over chairs trying to get to us.  It was uncomfortable and awkward.  The service was not good at all.  I think it was because they were understaffed and very overcrowded, but I still like it if the waitress checks in more than every half hour, and if we don't have to ask more than once for things like napkins.    The real problem, though, was the food.  My margarita was nice, and the appetizer was mediocre.  I ordered two vegetarian tacos.  One of them was just alright, but when I bit into the other, I found ACTUAL FISH BONES.  I am not kidding.  Not just one.  Maybe 5.  I had a mouthful of them.  It was completely revolting.  When I told the waitress, she did take it off our bill, but tried to argue with me about whether it was actually fish bones, and tried to tell me it was \"hardened flour.\"  I definitely know it was not.  Finally, our dessert was pretty underwhelming - the \"death by chocolate\" was basically a piece of boxed chocolate cake right out of the fridge, thrown on the very edge of a large plate with nothing else on it.  If it weren't for the LITERAL FISH BONES in my vegetarian taco, I probably would have ranked this a two, but sorry - that's just foul."}
{"text":"I enjoy the tacos and drinks at Wedge and am a bit surprised they don't get more business. Last night my husband and I both had 3 tacos, 2 margaritas, and shared an appetizer for under $60. Appetizer was good but I agree with others that chips are kind of greasy. Drinks were great! Tacos were hit or miss - 2 were great and 1 was kind of bland."}
{"text":"A place claiming \"Tequila Bar\" status should be ashamed of its sorry excuse for a margarita. Brown with too much agave nectar, warm from lack of ice, using the slightest amount of a house tequila I've never heard of. This margarita reveals a lack of appreciation for the spirit supposedly represented. What a tremendous disappointment. The tequila list is fair - but nothing you can't find retail at a nearby liquor store. And the food is average. But I can't imagine the situation that will take me back to Wedge."}
{"text":"Last night we had early evening dinner reservations for a party of six. By the time my wife and I got there (a little late due to rain), the others were already seated and had ordered some appetizers -- chips & salsa and traditional guacamole -- which were quite good. We had a smattering of margaritas, tequila flights, beer and the Ladies Best Friend, which my wife really enjoyed. The drinks were outstanding.  We were initially seated inside, but chose to switch to outside once the rain had completely passed and the tables and chairs were wiped dry. Five people had some sort of taco meal and I had steak Mesquite Fajitas. Everyone seemed to enjoy the tacos. The fajitas were not sizzling as one would normally expect. They were just okay.  Service at Wedge was exceptional! Although the interior was already crowded, our waitress was attentive inside and remained so once we moved outside.  I had not been particularly tempted to go to Wedge since tequila has traditionally upset my stomach. However, I did try some habanero tequila, which was very good -- with no bad effects!  We were celebrating a birthday and the birthday girl got a free tequila shot after dinner. Not bad.  All in all, we had a delightful evening and will surely return -- perhaps to try one of the many different dinner specials that Wedge has throughout the week."}
{"text":"I went to Wedge last night for dinner and drinks. It was so fabulous! We got a table right away- even though it was Friday night at 6:30. The sangria is delicious! My husband and I both had taco plates. We each had different types of tacos. All were so good! We had the shrimp dip with chips- amazing!! Our entire bill including alcoholic drinks, appetizer, and two full meals was right at $40.00. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Not impressed. Canned nopalitos. Elotes had too much mayo and cheese on them. And the corn was bad too. Just didn't taste like real Mexican food. Stick to Maize."}
{"text":"Where to begin. This place is a bona fide cluster...you know. I have been wanting to try it after hearing about all the different drinks and tequilas they had, but all that waiting was in vain. First off, I made a reservation, but was placed under a tent in  a parking lot on a 45 degree evening. It was warm when we first walked in, but were placed in the back where there were no heater lamps and the temperature was unbearable. We asked to be moved to a table closer to the one functioning heater lamp and were accommodated by the staff (although, in hindsight I wish we wouldn't have been so we would have gotten out then). After being comfortable for about ten minutes the lamp was moved to the back so we were freezing again, but by that point we were ready to leave.  We ordered apps to start and got salsa and the ranchero guac. The salsa was good, but the guac was TERRIBLE. it was as cold as the wind blowing under the tent and despite the menu listing it as guacamole with pico de gallo and queso, there was no cheese visible or to taste and as many chunks of tomato and onion as corn (which coincidentally is not supposed to be in this version of guacamole). This led us to believe that they just made one large batch that they could serve as any of the three sub par renditions and stored it in a freezer all day.  My drink (the diablo) was satisfactory. My boyfriend ordered the traditional margarita that included patron, patron citronage, orange liqueur and agave nectar. It tasted awful and they upcharged 50 cents for his request of Don Julio Blanco, which is acceptable, but then he was randomly charge $3 for Grand Marnier out of the blue. At that point it wasn't even worth dealing with so we paid and left.  Their menu looks pretty good until you start tasting the food, but an individual taco is $3 and a platter of 5 tacos is $15...not a mathematician but that's not really a deal...actually it's not a deal at all.  BOTTOM LINE: just don't do it. The food is wanna be upscale but is a flat out miss. The drinks are interesting, but seem to be a crapshoot depending on the specific cocktail."}
{"text":"I want this place to do well, because it would be great to have a fancy Mexican option in town. I think they could make this into a pretty solid little restaurant if they fix some problems. The drinks are tasty, but very very heavy on the ice. They are charging drink prices comparable to Boltini down the street, which actually gives you a full glass instead of all this padding. We felt a bit ripped off. I also wish that the specialty cocktail selection had some not-sweet cocktails. One of us got a taco plate and the other got a torta plate. On both, the sides left a lot to be desired. I'm pretty sure our beans and rice were out of a can, and the potato wedges were fresh out of the freezer... The tacos themselves (1 shrimp, 1 fish) were pretty good, though! Only complaint is that they didn't double up on the tortillas, so one of mine fell apart a bit. The steak torta was pretty good, although it would have done well with some pickled chiles.  I am somewhat annoyed that they don't provide free chips with dinner. The entree size isn't that big, which would have been fine if we got chips, but we left feeling hungry. Another rather big oversight is not providing some sort of spicy table salsa. The food wasn't very spicy in itself. Any good Mexican restaurant should have some house salsas.  I think the main problem here is cutting corners in really obvious ways: drinks loaded to brim with ice, no chips, no table salsa, sides are low quality afterthoughts. Even the lack of the doubled up tortilla. Come on guys, tortillas are not expensive. You can afford to give me 4 instead of 2 with my $8 entree.  Another weird thing that was noted by all my dining companions: Pretty much every Mexican joint in the town has Mexican people working the back AND the front of the house, including several restaurants owned by this very same family. Here, the front of house waitstaff is exclusively white skinny blond ladies. That has to be a conscious decision.  I can't help but throw at least some side eye at an establishment that decided that actual Mexican people aren't \"classy\" enough to wait tables."}
{"text":"it's just ok. inconsistent service and food. depends on when you go. but the thing that will keep me away forever... terrible music played way too loud. if you like 90's frat rock or super high energy electronic robot music... maybe this is the place for you. But it's ear poison for me. Too bad because it's very close to our office. We walk by it on our way to better options a little father down the block."}
{"text":"For the area, the food is good-- not the best Mexican/Latin food that I have had, but definitely better than the standard El Toro/ Mas Amigos food. It is more Latin-American fusion than anything. Great tequila list.   In terms of mixed drinks, wish they had more margarita options like prickly pear, grapefruit, or tamarindo. But I will say that their standard lime margarita, which I judge all tequila bars/ Mexican restaurants against, was pretty good. Just too bad they use orange juice in the mix.   All in all I would go back again."}
{"text":"i just went here for drinks and salsa and chips... so i can only comment on that.    maybe the food is wonderful.  i can't say.  the drinks were... okay.  weak, but okay.  they tasted alright, but i felt like the margarita choices were slim.... and kinda strange.  red pepper?  pumpkin?  maybe they were trying too hard to be out of the box.  a little too hard.  it's okay to be different, but maybe try to be something i'd still like to ingest.  jalepeno and pineapple is not something that sounds appetizing in a margarita.  ever.  i got a pumpkin margarita.  thought i'd swing for the fences and try something different.  it didn't taste bad, but i'd never order it again.    the chips and salsa do not come to your table standard either.  you have to order it.  the salsa is warm.  like heated up.  not spicy, but actually hot, temperature wise.  this was the first time i've encountered hot salsa.  i didn't prefer it this way.    the dining area is small, but the atmosphere is nice.  it's super dark in there, though.  the bar is nice looking and there is a hell of a lot of tequila, so if that's your jam.   you'll have a lot to pick from.  it's trying to be upscale.  it's bordering on pretentious.    will i be back?  probably not.  i prefer to drink my tequila in less refined establishments where i can get drunk, possibly eat a worm.  this will not be that place.  i'm absolutely sure of it."}
{"text":"Don't know that I'll ever go back to be honest. 2 trips ago the silverware, dishes, glass, and table all needed cleaned badly. Last trip was during lunch rush (12:15p) and there was 1 girl serving the entire place so we turned right around and left. It's too bad because they used to be pretty good."}
{"text":"A group and I ran across this restaurant when we were exploring the city.  The food really was great,  the environment was really laid back, and they have a really long list of great drinks (mostly tequila) .  I definitely recommend the tacos and also the guacamole!"}
{"text":"Delighted to see a business back in this space (formerly Carmons): the space is great in terms of the ambiance and, as somebody else posted, is probably especially good for dates (less good for really large groups). Lovely bar and great acoustics.  I also think the service was excellent.  My one serious criticism, and I hope the owners are paying attention: for the love of GOD choose better wines by the glass. Yes, this is a tequila bar. Yes, y'all make excellent and innovative mixed drinks. But have somebody who actually likes wine make the selections!  I would already have been back had I not incurred PTSD from the whites you serve."}
{"text":"I really like going to Wedge for drinks-great place to hang out.  The drinks are a little pricey, but since they're quite strong you don't need to worry about needing many rounds.  I've tried the food and wasn't impressed-Maize is much better.    The service is dependent on the folks working.  Usually indoor has much better service, though nothing special.  The girls working outdoor last night weren't all that friendly or attentive."}
{"text":"This place is so amazing.  I'm so glad a tequila bar of this quality opened up in town!  the pastor tacos were unbelievably amazing and the blood orange marg I got was a little strong for me but incredibly delicious.   I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Wedge is a welcome sight for my belly... yes my belly can see tacos. I like the idea of well done Mexican Cuisine in downtown Champaign. I\"m a big fan of the way they do their tacos. I have had a pretty tasty Margarita here as well, that said, I like Pacifico with my tacos. The staff is on point.  What?!?!"}
{"text":"Amazing food - amazing service!  Their restaurant signage caught my eye and made me want to go there. And what a wonderful choice it was. From start to finish the experience exceeded our expectations. Incredibly fresh Mexican food bordering on gourmet. Unique dishes like the various types of guacamole (my fav is the mango guac), incredibly delicious queso and chips (now that's some queso) to side order of potato wedges that are like air popped fried. The main entrees we're just as delicious. The wait staff so very friendly and helpful in their recommendations. Can't wait to come back and visit Wedge again!"}
{"text":"After reading some reviews I was a little hesitant about going to the restaurant. However, my boyfriend and I ended up here after the farmers market that was right across the street. We arrived and were seated outside instantly. Their menu was very extensive and I had a hard time figuring out what to get. My boyfriend and I both ordered margaritas and split two different guacs. Both of them were to die for. Wedge uses a lot of jicama in their guac and tacos. I had never had it before and I fell in love. I got a wedge salad and tacos. I couldn't finish them both because I was so full from guac and margaritas. Everything was really good. The bill was a little high totaling 60 for the both of us. Still, I really enjoyed the meal so I will return. I will most likely just tacos instead of tacos and a salad."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to Wedge this past Friday, thinking we would try something new after some friends were talking about Wedge.  We started off with the Yucatecan Ceviche, it sounded fresh and delicious and the description included habaneros.  We got our appetizer within a few minutes of ordering, it looked great, but not only was it not spicy, but it had barely any flavor.  We the ordered the Carnitas dinner plate, and I ordered the fish taco and the shrimp taco dinner.  The tacos were alright, again, very flavorless and the rice portion was laughable.  The Carnitas were absolutely flavorless and we found that there was more fat to pick out than actual good meat.  We both felt sick after eating here and were severely disappointed in a place that our friends thought was such a good place to eat and have drinks.  The ambiance was nice, a little dark to the point where we could barely read the menu and the wait staff was awkward and stood around at the bar most of the time.  There was a DJ playing pretty cool music, but it was WAY too loud for the size of the restaurant, and being seated so close to the speakers, it was highly unpleasant.  Overall, very unhappy with our first time at Wedge, we won't be back."}
{"text":"New location is really nice.  I had the steak quasadillas and it was pretty good.  Some of the steak was chewy but the flavor was really good.    I like the size of the outside patio.  The service was pretty good too."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food! And great margaritas as well. The tacos were extremely fresh and very reasonably priced. I would definitely recommend it to anybody!"}
{"text":"This was a great restaurant with good food and drinks.  Sorry to see it closed.  .  This was my go to place for creative Mexican food and bartenders that would create a fabulous drink. This restaurant could operate in San Francisco bay area and be successful."}
{"text":"Great food and service.  Lived in San Francisco bay area which is a foodie paradise.  This restaurant is the same in quality of  food"}
{"text":"UPS: Great food, generous portions, well-priced, creative menu, great location, a few free parking spots, hipster hotspot. DOWNS: Slightly odd that no Mexican people serve the customers, service is inconsistent (ie food can arrive quickly, but both times it took FOREVER to get the check). If they can iron out the service issues it will be a GEM :)"}
{"text":"I went here with a meetup group last night. We ordered chips and guacamole and chips and salsa as appetizers. Good stuff! Then, we all ordered drinks. I tried the Spicy Mango margarita. It was delicious and I loved that you get that spicy kick on the get go. Others had the sangria and El diablo. Everyone said the drinks were tasty. :)   I had the pollo torta for my entree and it was really good. The chicken wasn't dry and the flavors were nice. Everyone else's food looked delicious too and I didn't hear anyone complain. It was a good night out with good food and tasty drinks."}
{"text":"Great spot for tacos and margs in downtown Champaign. They have a ton of different tacos to chose from so you can mix and match, and best part is that you can get them as a lettuce wrap. They're pear margarita is very good as well!"}
{"text":"Love the wedge on neil. We tried the wedge 2 on winsdor, love it! Food is great and the drinks are awesome. Can't wait to use the patio in the summer."}
{"text":"I have liked how the outside looked ever since I came to UIUC, and I was enticed by their advertisement. Unfortunately, I was extremely disappointed with the food. (No comment on the drinks, I didn't have one.) Everything was cold or looked like it had been under a warmer even though we were some of the only customers. The chips were hard and greasy, as if fried more than twice. The guacamole was mediocre at best. The water even tastes awful, no amount of lime could cover it up. The rice looked and tasted old and the way the food was displayed was unappetizing. The service was fine, but she really shouldn't recommend something that tastes gross. Maybe this would be good \"drunk food\" but I won't be returning to find out."}
{"text":"Everything would be better if the taco tortillas weren't so fried. I concur that everything was kind of salty."}
{"text":"Went here on a sunday late afternoon and got exceptional service Jimmy. I had a lime margarita which tasted great. I had a steak torta which I recommend, it was very flavorable. Ive eaten here a number of times and reccomend it to anyone looking for good Mexican food Champaign."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in Downtown Champaign.   I would recommend coming on a Wednesday for their $6 taco dinner and $6 margarita drink special. The hibiscus margarita was delicious and reminded me of summer! Definitely will be back here before school lets out to grab a drink on their patio."}
{"text":"This is a good place to get a delicious margarita in Champaign. Good quality one, so a bit pricey compared to the in-Campus margaritas. But definitely worth it.  Especially during summer in the patio."}
{"text":"Nothing to write home about. Not worth the price. The tacos are really greasy and you leave with a stomach ache. They use too much oil in their food. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Drinks are great - wide selection of tequilas and tequila flights.  Food is so-so, we've had dinner several times at the wedge (trying different items) and have never been impressed."}
{"text":"How is this place 3 stars this place is amazing luv 2 eat great Mexican food  Carnitas are good, meat is super tender  Really good meal to help college students pass the chuunin exams."}
{"text":"The tacos here are so awesome!!! I love spicy food and this definitely does the trick! The camarón tacos are SO spicy and so delicious! I crave them all the time. I also love the steak and tilapia tacos.   The guacamole flight is so much fun! There are so many delicious guacamoles to try, but my favorites are the original and the mango. Delish!   The service is also wonderful. Each time I've been I have a very attentive and polite server.   My only complaint is that the drinks are not very strong! However they sure are tasty and there are plenty of margarita options to try!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It serves good food and has a fantastic selection of drinks. Great place to meet up friends for dinner or late night drinks (or desserts!)."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful Mexican restaurant, I love coming here and have never been disappointed by a single meal. Best margaritas I have ever had. Service is amazing."}
{"text":"The margaritas are amazing and they make their own infused tequila which is really good as well. I had a hard time picking a drink, and I need to go back and try the sampler shots flight. Theres quite a few food choices, and I ordered the fajitas which were a fairly large portion. It is fairly busy on the weekend, so call ahead and make a reservation. The nachos are a perfect starter that is shareable. Definitely the perfect place for some drinks and a quick bite .The staff is all very lovely and friendly!"}
{"text":"I went with a friend here to celebrate New Year's and we were quite disappointed in the food. Our server, no doubt, was fabulous, but the food was completely subpar, especially when you have places like Maize, El Toro, or even Q'doba who seem to have gotten it right.   Our guacamole left much to be desired. I make guacamole all the time, but this had a taste that it had been left in the fridge for a day or two, and was not a bright green color that would have indicated freshness. It was extremely acidic, but perhaps that was so you didn't realize the avocado was not fresh? The chips that supplied the guac were extremely flimsy, and not designed to be any kind of dipping chip, especially not with something as heavy as the guac. We did not ask for seconds.  The drinks were strong but it felt and tasted like cheap tequila. It didn't settle well with my friend and I. The names are cute and they sure entice you, but I'm pretty sure the chef/bartender/owner has had no real experience with amazing drinks.  The menu is surprisingly small, and they do tacos as basically their center focus, although there are some other things on the menu. I wasn't in a taco mood so I ordered the carne asada, and my friend the pork dish. The pork was good, the carne asada had a decent flavor, and the food came out fast. However, these plates were not worth $13. This same meal at El Toro or even at Maize would be cheaper and fresher.   In summary, we were disappointed that we started our evening there, and even more disappointed when we left and went to Big Grove Tavern because for $13, they were serving roasted chicken and vegetables, something you know was high quality based on where they get their ingredients and the overall knowledge that their chef knows what they are doing.   We give Wedge a year before it closes. Unless of course someone is brought in to give the menu and the chef a revamp so that people want to come back."}
{"text":"You're a bar and you are open until 2 for Christ sake. Stop trying to kick us out at 10."}
{"text":"Had lunch at Wedge and ended up with the worst service I've had at a restaurant in a very long time. We were seated outside and totally forgotten about until having to go inside and ask for a server. The drinks we ordered never arrived but absolutely appeared on the bill. After asking for those drinks to be removed from the bill we were given a tired apology and a coupon for free appetizers on our next visit which won't be happening. First and last visit."}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday night at about 10pm. It wasn't very crowded so we were seated and served very quickly.   I ordered the Lomo (grilled ribeye) and Pastor (pork) tacos with rice and beans. The rice and beans were average and the Lomo was below average. The Pastor, on the other hand, was AMAZING! I would come back just to eat the Pastor tacos. They're really juicy and bursting with flavor!  I also had a Sparkling Raspberry Margarita and a lime margarita. They were both good but I preferred the lime margarita.  If you eat pork, get the Pastor!! It may be the best pork taco I've ever had."}
{"text":"Wedge is a want to be high end restaurant but really not much more than an El Toro with more eclectic menu options. The Tacos I had were good but the pickled veggies were actually frozen when they brought them out. Also, the margaritas are average. A place that advertises themselves as a Tequila Bar, in my mind, should have drinks and cocktails that are unique and try to blow you away, that didn't happen for me."}
{"text":"Food is great! Tastes delicious and even better when they have their $2 tacos on Tuesdays and Sundays. I would go for the Lomo (steak) tacos. Also, the Potato wedges are sooo flame!  Service is mediocre but very friendly. Sometimes I feel like the waiters get confused at what they're doing - doing too much or doing too little.   Drinks are pretty good. Except they forgot to put salt on the last margarita I ordered... huh?  Atmosphere is great. Bathrooms are clean and tidy. Outdoor seating is very nice too."}
{"text":"Had lunch here this past weekend after a very long night on the road. Started out with the tortilla soup. Lovely little bowl of tastiness. The only thing that would have made it better is a skirt of lime. The chips and salsa are also very good and the sangria is some of the best I've ever had, and I make my own a lot of the time. The tacos where all very tasty and fresh and I even ate the black beans, which I usually stay away from, but decided to try them and was glad I did. The only bad part of the meal was the rice. Very bland and almost remained me of converted rice, oh well. The service was excellent and very cute, I might add.  I will defiantly be going back next time I am in town."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful lunch today.  Best fish taco I have had in ages.   We will be back very soon.  We had a great server also.  They have about 8 different tacos, so choose your favorite."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner with a friend this past Thursday evening and we had a great experience from drinks to food to the customer service. We were able to be seated outside on the patio immediately upon arrival which was great!  Our server was very friendly and attentive; she provided recommendations for drinks and food and she didn't rush us out after finishing our meal which I really appreciated, especially with it being such a pleasant summer night to sit outside.   We both went with the taco dinner-I chose 1 fish taco and 1 of their calabacitas (zucchini blossoms, yum!) tacos, while my friend went with 2 chicken tacos.  We also both got one of their lime margaritas.  The dinner came with refried beans, rice, and some pickled veggies too!  All in all, we were both pleased with our food!  The calabacitas taco was my favorite hands-down, but the fish taco was pretty yummy too.   I would definitely recommend Wedge as a great spot to sit outside, catch up with friends, and enjoy some Mexican food in downtown Champaign for a fairly reasonable price."}
{"text":"Very good service and food. I don't think I have seen the waiters without a smile on their faces. The food was great and prices were good. No complaints about the resturant. I would highly recommend  this place for Mexican food lovers."}
{"text":"We arrived, where seated and given water.......25 minutes later we left. Not once did anyone even speak to us, and it wasn't busy either. We really wanted to try out this place but no one would take our order. We instead went to Billy Barooz and had a wonderful meal and a great waitress.  BTW Wedge: it was my wife's birthday, thanks! *sarcasm"}
{"text":"I went here with a friend Sunday night and they had $4.00 margaritas! That's a plus! We had already eaten dinner somewhere else but the margarita was tasty. And they checked on us but not to a point of bothersome. I'd go back. ;)"}
{"text":"Ok, so we started eating the chips and thought, hmmm, I don't know, but then, they sort of grow on you and tasted pretty great.   I had a fish taco (first ever) it was really awesome, although I didn't care for the taco corn shell. No problem next time, they offer lettuce wrap as an alternative.   I've had the margarita before here and those are excellent!"}
{"text":"I knew this place would be good.  My mojito was one of the best I've had. I loved the tacos al pastor. In fact I love anything al pastor.  When I heard it was a tequila bar, I assumed there would be tons of latin women in short skirts and loud mariachi musica. No miniskirts tonight. Music was quiet and more classical than I expected. The place is dimly lit, but it looks great.  Not sure whether to consider it a bar with food or a restaurant with excellent drinks."}
{"text":"Stopped in for drinks and snacks to check it out.   Had a standard margarita (tequila choices including home infused were overwhelming) and my wife had a sangria (good - not soda pop). For snacks got the potato wedges with aioli and a veggie quesidilla.  Both were spiced but more savory not overwhelmingly hot.   Were a few pangs of infant restaurant problems (credit card machine operation was spotty).  All in all pleasant place for a drink and food was interesting.  It is quite small so if it gets popular, it might be a hard table."}
{"text":"Service was great as was the atmosphere.... Good however was far from exceptional. The kitchen has yet to discover something called salt, or any seasoning whatsoever the food was all very bland. Even the tortilla chips were salt less.... Will not go back here."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere of this place and the food is amazing. The service was spectacular, we had Steph as our waitress and she was so attentive. The alcoholic drinks are very tasty and well made and everything is very decently priced. The different types of guacamole are awesome and really bring a lot of variety! I will definitely be back and recommend this place to my friends when they are looking for a nice place to eat in Champaign."}
{"text":"So they were our favorite. Now when we go they have too many servers that take your order and you never see them again or just don't come back to the table until it's bill time. I had the lomo tortas with a tequila Moscow mule. Don't order this at the wedge at the crossing. Sandwich is too thick and potato gets are never done all the way. The beverage was strong but all I tasted was tequila and lime. But if you see my pic I guess they couldn't fit the ginger beer because of the huge ice cube in my glass. It's gone down hill since it first opened. Of course. I'm sick of dining out."}
{"text":"I always get the calabacitas tacos in a lettuce wrap and love it every time. I've tried a few other tacos before and they were also great but I love the calabacitas the best. They used to have a two taco dinner on the menu that comes with a side of rice and beans but now everything is sold separately. The price still equals about the same. I recommend getting the side of rice and beans because they are both delicious. The service is not the best but they do really care about your experience and if your food is not how you like it they will redo it for you. My mom had to send back her food twice due to ingredients in her dish she specifically said she was allergic to and the manager ended up giving us a free dessert and appetizer coupon for our next visit."}
{"text":"So. Myself and three other people wanted to sit on the empty patio at wedge with our dogs. Since the downtown wedge allows this and the owner said it was fine we went on the patio with the pups. When we got there the brunette basically threw the menus at us and didn't say a word. Next the blonde waitress came out and said 'we don't really do this whole dog thing' and that  in the future we shouldn't expect it. This was after she gave us waters with a disgusted look on her face. After that we made the decision to leave on our own accord because they made us feel so unwelcome. We went across the parking lot and jupiters gladly accommodated us and our dogs. Even bringing out bowls of water for them and the entire staff came out and hung out with us. Never again will I ever go to the wedge at the crossing and if you want to go to a place with your pup. Don't count on wedge. Failure!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Wedge. The atmosphere is trendy and their tacos are actually awesome. All of them. My personal favorite is the camaron, but I also loved the lomo (ribeye), pastor, and chori pollo. Great margaritas too. Nice patio when weather permits. It's also right across the downtown parking lot, which is very convenient."}
{"text":"15th time at The Wedge, apologies for the delayed post. The Carnitas is consistently outstanding. Great place highly recommend for great food and margo's."}
{"text":"My group of four unanimously agreed that this was a good place to have a meal. The menu is different from many Mexican restaurants. The main dishes are tacos and there are some entree options as well as a nice selection of appetizers. I had one chicken (pollo, for your Spanish speakers) taco and one vegetarian of some kind. They were both pretty good. I would be interested in trying other items on another visit.   Parking was easy. The best part of the meal was the margerita."}
{"text":"I've hosted several parties here and the food is always amazing. My friends and I consider this place one of our favorites in downtown Champaign. They are always accommodating and staff is always friendly. Our favorites are the tacos and their guac is made fresh daily. Delicious raspberry margaritas too!!!"}
{"text":"Objectively bad. When I found out this place was owned by the people that owned El Toro it all made sense. I do not know how this place or El Toro manage to stay in business considering that they are literally some of the worst \"mexican\" places I have ever eaten at.   A friend of mine ordered the guacamole and reported feeling not well after eating it (she hadn't been drinking so you can't blame the booze)."}
{"text":"Food was amazing, the servers were all exceptionally nice! The cocktails were quite good. I will be going back again soon."}
{"text":"Do NOT GO HERE. I have 3 friends that have had food poisoning on 3 separate occasions.. (And when they consulted the restaurant, they denied that it was their fault) If you must go, do it on a Saturday so you can be sick all day Sunday....."}
{"text":"Great slightly upscale Mexican food. Loved the chips and salsa. Great tamales, and tacos."}
{"text":"I got food poisoning from the steak here.   So did my friend (who ordered a steak sandwich), and while we were dining, I overheard a phone call that was very likely a possible foodborne illness complaint. (The waitress responded with comments like \"I'm so sorry.. no we have not had any other similar complaints.. I am so sorry I will have the GM call you back.\" I did not think anything of it at the time because I understand it could be anything.)  I called, with no mean intentions, to inform them that I, as well as the doctor I went to see at Carle Clinic, were 95% positive that Wedge was the source of this foodborne illness, and the doctor assured me it was NOT the flu.  Wedge did not return my 3 calls until 3 days later, and the GM's response was that \"I'm pretty confident we are not the source. There is a bad flu going around.\" Thanks for the call. By the way, unless your steak always tastes that dry, then there probably was something wrong with it. Will not return again.  GROSS!"}
{"text":"We went here for dinner and the service we recieved was excellent, unfortunatley the food was terrible. I ordered 5 tacos (3 different kinds) with sides of rice and beans. The food was lukewarm, the the tortillas were too thick and very greasy, and combination of food used in each taco just didn't work or taste very good. Too bad......."}
{"text":"This place a great selection of margaritas and tequilas. Unfortunately, our margaritas came to us room temperature (maybe a little cooler but definitely not cold) but they were pretty good anyway. The chips were great, the rest of the food was fine. Not the best Mexican food in town but definitely the best selection of margaritas and tequilas."}
{"text":"Had a dinner date with my husband on a Friday. I thought we would need a reservation, but the restaurant was far from crowded. The kitchen is fast! The Polly y mango salad is an excellent dish, with a really interesting combination of flavors and textures; I would definitely order it again. My husband had a couple of tacos, which were different and delicious. We're not a fan of the pickled vegetables (maybe because they're served cold?), but the black beans are good. The chips are best when still hot. We'll be back when the weather is nicer, and we can sit outside."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic. Shrimp tacos and chicken tacos. The different flavor guacs were worth the trio, and they came with 3 baskets of chips-bonus! The waitress was fantastic and gave us recommendations on drinks. The outside patio was beautiful with very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Wedge is really decent for a Champaign-Urbana spot. The tacos are good and so is the mango salsa with the chips. It's nothing spectacular but for a decent price you can have an alright meal.  The severs/bartenders are REALLY friendly which I love. They'll cater to your every need and are awesome at recommending drinks. Never overbearing either which is awesome. The place is pretty small but with enough seating to never be extremely crowded. There's music playing, and the tequila drinks are honestly really good. They never skimp out on flavor."}
{"text":"What this place has going for it is the Tequila. It is a great spot for professionals to come and get a drink with their friends. Food is tasty but menu options are limited. Seating is also limited because of the size of the restaurant (which is very small) and when it fills up the place gets pretty loud. Lots of solid daily specials for their tacos and drinks."}
{"text":"Had dinner here this past week. We had some Ceviches for appetizer and ordered Pollo Torta and Mexican Burger. The food looked great, but tasted a bit salty. I thought that if the food was much lighter in flavoring, it would have been the best. Chips were too oily for the ceviches. The waitress was very bad with our requests, it took her so much time to get us the checks."}
{"text":"I thought this was a restaurant but it's more like a little bar tucked away in Downtown.  It's not amazing.. but I also live in California now so I have ample access to great Mexican food which is cheaper than this.  Still.. it was pleasant.  The waitstaff was nice.  There were a ton of girls here for some reason the night I was there.  I did not try their margaritas even though it was a $5 special.  I find that sometimes the well drinks at tequila places aren't that good anyways.  So I tried their tortilla soup.  A bit dissapointing for a Mexican restaurant.  My favorite one was at Grove Tavern.  Then I tried their carne asada.  Large in portion.. ehhh.. it was just okay.  It seemed a little dry to be honest.  It's kind of weird that I remember El Toro being so much better.  But maybe it's because I was a college student back then.    Anyways, not too much seating area so I can't imagine getting a seat on a busy weekend night.  As for upscale.. ehhhh.. I don't know.. beside it being in downtown, I'm not sure about that."}
{"text":"One of my absolute favorite places to grab food. Eclectic food menu, drinks menu, and vibe.  The tacos and chips & salsa are very authentic and very yummy!  Also, the staff has been great every time I have been."}
{"text":"Wedge is one of my favorite places to eat in Champaign. I'm a sucker for all kinds of Mexican food, and the selection at Wedge does not disappoint. It's the kind of place you can eat at frequently, but still always have something new to try. I've sampled many of their tacos, but my favorites are the ceviche and the chorizo & egg. I love that they switch up their drink and food menus seasonally to accommodate for what's in season. I'd recommend Wedge to anyone looking for delicious Mexican food that's a step up from your typical fast casual dining."}
{"text":"Based on a co-worker's recommendation (who was with us on this visit), we just went there as a group for lunch (party of 7).  It was about 11:45am and we were seated almost immediately when they grouped a couple tables for us.   We ordered a couple orders of nachos (with chicken) to share amongst the table, and they were pretty decent.  The chips were unique and seemed to be cooked fresh.   No salsa was offered at all though, and I think it would have helped.  All but one of us ordered the taco special (2 tacos, rice, black beans, and some sort of pickled vegetables).  The one who didn't ordered the Portabello Mushroom sandwich, and honestly his dish looked the best of the group.  Large freshly fried potato wedges looked very attractive.  Pretty much everyone avoided the pickled veggies (even the vegetarians in the group), because they looked a bit disgusting and tasted like they looked.  The black beans should have been advertised as \"paste\", because that was the texture of it.  The rice was ok, but didn't have much flavor on its own.  I got the Chori Pollo taco (chicken and chorizo) and the Pastor.  We frequently order from El Toro Bravo and the Chori Pollo is one of my favorite dishes, so I had high hopes for this taco.  It was drowning in raw tomatoes and sour cream (both of which I hate).  The Pastor was much less dressed, and was much tastier.   The little cup of orange-ish salsa provided had very little taste, so I didn't even use it.  My understanding was that this is supposed to be slightly more \"upscale\" than the other El Toro owned properties, but I was not impressed.   We have had awful service at El Toro Bravo lately also though, so maybe the quality is just going down across the board.  I have never been to the one downtown, but I expected this one to be even nicer since they have tons more space.  We won't be going back for lunch.  They do have 1/2 price appetizers from 4-6pm, so we might give it another try for happy hour and order something else.  Service: Sparse, although they did clear dishes fairly quickly Food Quality: Low, in my opinion, compared to other places in town. Space:  Adequate - no one else was there, so it was fairly quiet."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night and waited about half an hour. Tables stayed open, and two in our party of four were shooed away from sitting at the bar while we waited so they could seat someone there. That's all to say that the wait was mildly annoying, but they're still newish, it's a Saturday night, and they seemed understaffed, so I'm willing to overlook that a bit.  The food was a welcome surprise after many of the mediocre reviews. I had a chicken taco, a fish taco, and a tamal. The chicken taco was great. Wouldn't change a thing. The fish taco came with a pretty sizable piece of fish--tilapia. I would prefer another kind of fish, but appreciated the size. The chipotle sauce on it was delicious, but it definitely needed a bit more, so it came across a bit dry. The tamal was quite good. I've been disappointed in most of the tamales in this town, but this one was moist, and the spicy salsa on top really gave it a nice taste. Overall I really enjoyed dinner.   The drinks weren't bad, but my mojito seemed pretty weak and almost none of the mint/lime came across unfortunately. My date liked the blood orange margarita though.  Ultimately, I want to give Wedge 4 stars, but there were a few too many missteps. The food was good though so we may return."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday afternoon. Enjoyed the line margarita, guacamole, pastor taco, and the churros! Would definitely recommend this place. Great service!"}
{"text":"So yummy!! Love the el pastor taco. And all the tequila! My boyfriend got the burrito that is smothered in cheese sauce and he loved. Very chill place and perfect for a nice day to sit outside."}
{"text":"Their tacos really are pretty great. Their choices of margaritas are very plentiful and I don't think anyone could be bored with their drink menu. Their fajitas, though, seemed old (not even sizzling when brought out, although still hot-ish). The meat was about 3/4 fat, instead of meat, so eating the fajita tacos was more of a task than enjoying a meal since I had to pull out the fat. I think if I go back, I'll definitely stick to the tacos. Tried the pineapple and mango jalapeno margaritas...the mango is definitely more spicy than the pineapple. Both were decent, though.  ---the Monday margarita flight is amazing!! Also, the Monday taco special is great. I'd definitely recommend getting tacos when you come here, but steer clear of the steak! The blood orange margarita is now a favorite."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to this restaurant on a whim.The drinks were great and fairly priced. I enjoyed the margarita. Do not go here if you are looking for Americanized Mexican food; this is not the place for you. If you crave traditional Mexican fare The Wedge will not disappoint. The food was good, the drinks were good, the service was good. It was not stellar, but fine. The waiter didn't bother us too much, but wasn't on top of refilling water and drinks. We will go back."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite restaurant for Mexican style food. Fresh, amazing flavors, not smothered in cheese. Love the Lime margaritas which were on special tonight, as well a variety of tacos!  We also had quac and chips and chili relenos(sp) I'm in Champaign a couple of times a year, always try to go to the Wedge!"}
{"text":"went with a friend, we ordered tacos and some guacamole for an appetizer. The tacos came out first, pretty tasty. We sit for a while and drink our drinks, and then the waitress brings the check. When we asked about the guacamole, she went to the kitchen to check. She came back and said the cooks didn't make it, and now the kitchen was closed, but she'd take it off our check and bring the new bill. Except she walked off, leaving the original check with us, which only listed the tacos. So actually, she just never entered the order in for guacamole. Which is an acceptable mistake...what's not acceptable is lying to the customer and blaming another staff member."}
{"text":"An excellent Mexican and Tequila bar in this sleepy college town.  Everything here is very fresh and made with quality.  It is a really small area.  A U shaped bar, with a few high top tables, and a bit more private booths.  No TV's at the bar, which is saying something in this town.  I really like the vibe here.  Relaxed and cozy during off hours.  Though this small spot gets packed during the weekend.  Though the bartenders and waitresses do their best, and the food always seems to come out quick.  My family and I found a seat in one of the booths.  A smaller menu, with a few aps, tacos, and a few entrees.  You can mix and match 5 tacos for $15.  I love the Pastor, and Chorizo tacos.  The Pastor has a great mix of fruity sweetness and heat.  The Chorizo has a really good kick.  Fresh as can be guacamole, and the black beans are so flavorful.  Certainly not your typical mushy flavorless mass of beans at most mediocre Tex-Mex places.  The bar is well stocked.  I am not a Tequila guy at all, but the Margaritas here are top notch.  They make some really good cocktails with the several house infused Tequilas and a huge selection to choose from.  Tasty food that is more than the typical Tex-Mex joint, good bar, good service, and an all around fun place for a meal and a few drinks in this wonderful, but small downtown."}
{"text":"Try the Juan Collins. It's a crisp tequila version of a Tom Collins."}
{"text":"I wish they had their hours written on their front door. Their website says they close at 2:00am on Thursdays, but it's a blatant lie. By 11, they were closing up shop and subtly telling us to get out.   Besides that, I gotta say that their tortas are quite delicious. I also had a spicy mango margarita. I couldn't taste the mango, but it tasted exactly like alcoholic low-viscous hot sauce."}
{"text":"So, after our poor experience with Wedge early on, my wife and I decided to give them another try for brunch.  BIG MISTAKE.  First off, and most importantly, I got food poisoning -- possible culprits were their guacamole that had a faintly moldy taste to it, the chips that were stale, and the mushy rice that seemed like it had been sitting in a steam table all day.  Even if you don't buy the food poisoning issue, the food was just awful.  Crushed, canned pineapple on the (moldy) guacamole; mushy, gross rice with obviously pre-frozen vegetable medley folded into it; lukewarm coffee.  I didn't even get asked how I wanted my eggs on my huevos rancheros, and they came out over-hard (blech).  The tortillas (like the chips) were stale.    The service was terrible as well, complementing their awful food.  Our waitress only brought one of us a water (odd choice), asked for our drink order and walked away after only ONE of us answered, tripped and sloshed my lukewarm coffee all over the mug and saucer, and rather than cleaning it up, simply set it down, asked if I wanted a napkin, and never returned with one -- leaving me with a mug covered in coffee.  We had to ask for silverware after our food was delivered.  Meanwhile, the other server was shouting across the patio to (who I guess was) the manager on duty for information as to what various items on the menu were.    Given there is better Mexican AND brunch options within walking distance of this place, I can't imagine why ANYONE would go here."}
{"text":"While the food is good, it isn't worth the consistently bad service. I went in with a friend and the waiters were grouped at the end of the bar talking. After two minutes of standing there I had to walk over to them and actually asked to be seated. They didn't seem apologetic, only annoyed that I interrupted their conversation. This persisted the entire night, having to waive them down to order our food, to get refills, and eventually or check. I've even gone back a few times because I love the food and its the same story every other time I've been there."}
{"text":"After a rough experience here right after they opened, we decided to give it another shot this past weekend. Unfortunately, things were even more disorganized than the last time. The host was very friendly and attentive, letting us know he would be able to seat us soon and that we can hang out at the bar until the table was ready. The fact that we were greeted by a host was a great improvement for me because last time, I felt the confusion with seating and lack of a seating host/hostess was a major problem. When we approached the bar, the bartender brought one of us a drink right away while the rest of us needed some time to look at the drink menu. This is when the chaos ensued. A bunch of servers needed drinks for their tables and pretty soon, the lone bartender was caught up mixing margarita after margarita which all must be made to order. Then, large groups of people decided to also hang out at the bar while they waited for seating. At this point, a kind bus boy took pity on us and decided to put our drink orders in but he was unable to use the register, leading to a long line of customers who received drinks but hadn't paid. Our table actually became ready before we could pay for our drinks! We had to wait to pay before being seated. I was glad, once being seated to be out of the chaos of the bar. However, our server was just as disorganized when he forgot to bring us water after my boyfriend asked for it on 3 occasions. We didn't get water until we were almost done with our entrees! After all that, the food was pretty good. I had a chili relleno taco which was crazy! and surprisingly delicious! But unfortunately a lot of it was a little bland. Maybe the disorganized service put a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"Wedge is a restaurant that serves Mexican food, but served and plated creatively.    As an appetizer, we ordered a tamale. To our surprise, the tamale came with pickled cactus (which we thought was green beans).  I was happy to see the pickled cactus because this side dish is more in line with authentic mexican food  I ordered a steak torta and it was packed with flavor and the steak was nice and tender.    The dishes are reasonably priced. I thought the food and service here were really great. Plenty of street parking and free in the evenings."}
{"text":"This place is a hit or miss. Unfortunately, it's a miss for me. I came here for brunch and I had 2 tacos + rice and black beans. The food was decent. They serve it really neat and pretty compared to a regular Mexican place. I was so disappointed you had to pay for chips and salsa :( For the size I think it's a little bit overpriced - although it is understandable due to the location.   The drinks? For a tequila bar I think the drink menu is underwhelming. I've tried the sparkling pomegranate and perfect patron margaritas - they're ok. I've had better and cheaper margaritas before.  The nice thing is they have outside seating in the summer!"}
{"text":"I live for their nachos!!! My husband and I always plan to go there when visiting my sister in Champaign. The drinks are always good and \"knock you on your ass\" strong. I'm not exactly a fan of their other menu options but those nachos are delish!!!!"}
{"text":"After the show at The  Accord, we walked in the general direction of our car and decided to have a nightcap here.  The patio looked inviting and had comfortable seats.  We each got a margarita, the Pear for me.  Awesome.  The chips and salsa were great.  The chips were thick.  I also got a veggie taco, filled with zucchini and black beans.    Our server was really sweet and efficient.  I am posting a pic of the pretty sink in the ladies room."}
{"text":"Not anything amazing. You can find way better Mexican food that isn't pricey in Chicago or around campus town. I had the 5$ margarita special and it wasn't good. Too sweet and too little tequila for my taste. Won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"Had lunch here with my daughter while she was visiting in town.  The food wasn't all that impressive but decent.  The service on the other hand was deplorable.  Although there was a very small lunch crowd and several people on staff they were very slow to attend to us.  Food was delivered with no utensils or napkins, getting water refills and drink orders was impossible and never got the ashtray they said they'd bring.  We sat on the patio and had to go inside to make request several times."}
{"text":"Dark haired server chick that worked 2/22 at close was the rudest (unrelated to our table) server I've ever had the displeasure to encounter. Coming up to our table and coming at one of the people in our group in a horrible disrespectful manner was beyond uncalled for. Hopefully some sort of tact or manners will be utilized next time. She was much better at quietly wiping down menus. Normally a good time, as long as dark haired bully isn't there. Fantastic tacos though!"}
{"text":"Both of us had gotten pretty sick the next morning, but at least the food tasted good.  Starting off with the \"Perfect Patron Margarita\" and Modelo, we were greeted with a warm \"Fondue Del Mar.\"  We also shared the Ribeye Torta and three different tacos."}
{"text":"sad to say our experience had been bad! First time customers, a new wait staff, nice and courteous, yet very naïve to what was going on. ordered our food, shrimp tacos, knew they would be spicy, yet the shrimp had been overdone, taste like rubber, the spices takes over the concept of what the shrimp should taste like, not good...our friend ordered the pork with a side of tortilla, those had mold on them. I ask for the waitress to look at the tortilla, she took it back in and came out and said it was a stain from the cabbage.. hmm NOT! can tell the difference of red stain and green mold.. the assistant manager came and apologized, yet, knowing they gave their waitstaff such a bogus excuse makes me wonder what else is going one..first time visiter, never going back!"}
{"text":"We have been to Wedge a few times recently and are enamored with the food. Wedge has great discounts on margaritas, too (which we love). We have never had bad service at Wedge. The flautas come highly recommended!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I heard many great things about Wedge and we have been wanting to visit for some time! We were finally in town so we decided to stop in for a drink but we ended up staying a while! We had such an amazing time! The bartender, Kate, was so friendly and made us some delicious drinks. We later found out she was the General Manager so that was neat to talk with her and taste her drinks that she recommended! The food was great, the atmosphere was fun... Overall we are very pleased and are excited to come back again!"}
{"text":"The margaritas are so different , in a good way!  I had the Mexican burger, it was amazing. The service is excellent too!"}
{"text":"The outdoor patio is so cute, but seriously it's waaaay too close to the street and parking lot. One does not forget that traffic is nearby due to the frequent noise and the persistent smell of exhaust. However, the drinks are divine (lots of margaritas from which to choose) and apps are varied and pleasing. If the server warns that a dish is spicy, he/she is not messing around. I absolutely love spicy food, and I was not disappointed.  Although I miss the old Carmen's restaurant at this same location, Wedge seems like a pretty good addition to downtown Champaign."}
{"text":"Restaurant review I have seen wedge so many times in Downtown Champaign that I had to check it out myself. The reviews on yelp were not so hot and I can see why based on my Sunday night dinner. I was happy that there was not a lot of customers so no need to wait for a table, however the hostess/waitress in one who seemed to be covering the entire dining room was not friendly at all. She told us you can go pick your table and came back after we were seated with the menu. I don't like to complain, but throughout the whole meal she was not at all friendly until right before the check came. Sunday they had 4 dollars guac and 5 dollar lime margarita. I got both and the steak torta. First the guac and chips, the guac was fresh and well made, the chips were unfortunately freshly fried and a hot greasy mess. Somehow we must have gotten the bottom of the tortilla chips as they were all cracked into little pieces and dripping in greasy. The lime margarita was spot on, very heavy on the alcohol, but that is a good thing! Finally onto my torta and potato wedge entree. The steak torta really lacked any unique seasoning or flavor. The steak was very rough and chewy. The potato wedges that came with the meal were fine. Overall I was less than impressed as other reviewers noted.   Pros: daily specials per below, large margarita and tequila menu  Cons: Below average customer service, food lacking seasoning, tortilla chips that were greasy and broken into little pieces  Hidden deals: Daily Specials Sunday: 4 dollar any guac, 5 lime margaritas Monday: 12 margarita flights, 12 taco samplers Tuesday: 12 fajitas 5 limte margaritas Wednesday: 6 any cocktail, 8 any torta Thursday: 7 nachos, 5 lime margaritas Friday/Sat: 1/2 select appetizers from 4-6 pm  Health code rating: Not listed on the website, but the other restaurant report is horrendous"}
{"text":"Visited this little spot when visited family in the area. Great selection of margaritas and tacos. I had the burrito which was very good, seemed odd they only had one type of burrito but it was good. Wife had a couple of tacos. Shrimp ones were too spicy for her liking but I thought they were good. Overall we all were happy. Queso dip was a good appetizer with chips! 4 stars due to only one burrito option and no enchiladas on the menu."}
{"text":"Monday night specials are great! The $10 taco sampler and $10 margarita sampler are a great way to get happy hour started. Our server was very attentive and the patio was kept clean. My chair was broken when I sat down, and it ripped my dress a little.   I was with a group including my mother, and she thought the clothing on the waitresses was a little risky (shorts were pretty short/tight). I used to work in food and I can see her perspective, but for downtown champaign this kind of apparel is nothing new.   I would suggest a visit! Good presentation is also exceptional for the CU area."}
