{"text":"Best burgers anywhere near Charlotte!  Been coming here for years since my days teaching at Stanly Community College.  I would stop for lunch on my way home to Charlotte.  14 years later, I am bringing my kids here.  They have really made it bright and cheery and still kept the food quality the same.  There is just really not much to compare to it.  Great food, shakes, ice cream, you name it.  If you read my other reviews, you will see I can get quite picky.  I don't have a thing to complain about here.    it's an easy ride from Charlotte and well worth it!"}
{"text":"Lived in area my whole life, been going to the sundae shop since a child.. Great burgers and fries. A must try is the bbq sandwich, when it is offered. The Clarks do an awesome pulled pork sandwich."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! It's located in a perfect spot that just begs you to try it if you're out near the Reed Gold mine. The service is amazing - our server was all smiles and was engaging with the kids while we figured out our orders.   I had a double cheeseburger (all in) and fries with their extra special tap water (for which they are known by the area high school kids). My burger was delicious, amazing, and sloppy. My fries were not that hot, but everyone else said theirs were piping hot, so the wind must have cooled mine down or they were out of the fryer first. I shouldn't really complain since I ate every last one of them.   If I find myself to the East of Charlotte again, I will definitely take a detour here! Next time I'll try a milk shake or ice cream - they looked amazing!"}
{"text":"Have eaten here since they first opened and the food is the best. Love the Burgers and Fries and the Banana Splits are awesome. Year round good food."}
{"text":"I love the Sundae Shop.  It's cute for a date night or for bringing the kids.  The food is mainly hamburgers, hot dogs and fries.    They seem to have odd hours of operation, I'm not sure if they are set in stone hours but I do not see them operating normal business hours.    Also, remember if you come here it is cash ONLY.  We had to leave one time because we didn't realize it was cash only and only had our cards on us.  Other then the hours and cash only, my Fianc√© and I love this place."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Good selection, and great staff. Love the fries and the BLTs. Has a great drive in vibe.  Love that it's so close at han"}
{"text":"This is a very popular and very retro burger/hot dog/ice cream walk-up restaurant.  I usually get the cheeseburger all-the-way (ketchup, mustard, onions, and chili) and fries.  I don't like eating in my vehicle, so, weather permitting, I eat at one of the outside tables.  My one disappointment with this place was the $5.00 banana split that I once ordered.  It was made with all soft serve ice cream.  That's just not acceptable."}
{"text":"Loved it. Had cheeseburger and onion rings. Onion rings were the best!  And of course a banana split!"}
{"text":"The most amazing hamburgers in town. They take cash only tho so be prepared. Milk shakes were okay but the burgers were amazing. Fries were very fresh. I will most defiantly come back here again!!!!!! Nice customer service too."}
{"text":"I go to the Sundae Shop on a regular basis, whether it's for burgers or just ice cream. Burgers are made fresh and the onion rings are great. All the ice cream is delicious and the hot fudge cake is amazing as well."}
{"text":"When I was a boy, on hot summer days my Mom--who loved treats--would pile my brother, sister, and I along with our large dogs into the car.  Off we'd head to a local dairy farm that also ran a burger/hot dog/ice cream shop similar to this one.  We'd each get our choice of ice cream including the dogs.  It was always a wonderful time.  Unfortunately, most of these places have long disappeared so finding one in Midland was a great surprise.  I ordered an old school favorite:  peanut butter malted milk shake!  So very good.  The big ol' heavy straw didn't collapse when a heavy draw is put on it.  For those who don't like thick shakes, a long spoon is provided to reach all the way to the bottom of the cup.  Great shake, even better memories, and all for $3.50.  I'm hooked!"}
{"text":"This was a Yelp recommendation per the usual.. looking for food on the back roads while headed to Myrtle Beach. We stopped here to grab a quick bite (bacon cheeseburger and fried fish sandwich) and it satisfied the cravings! Very cute spot in Midland, reminded me of a classic Dairy Queen. I wanted to try a yummy shake, but in the interest of a 3+ hour car ride I passed. I did try a small vanilla cone with fruity pebbles which was good, but it was melting because it was so hot!  Long story short, I would try this place again, thanks for coming through in the clutch."}
{"text":"Fun little hang out for quick lunch. Only reason I keep going back is for the sweet girl that works there and is always so helpful - Shannon K I believe her name is, you're lucky to have such a great employee!"}
{"text":"Can't believe I stumbled across this gem. I may never be able to eat another burger anywhere else again. Bacon was smoky, thick, well cooked; burger had great flavor and texture; the bun was the perfect thickness. It may well be the perfect burger. I didn't bother with dessert but boy did that banana split look amazing."}
{"text":"There have been many times I've driven by this little shack on the way somewhere or another. Most times I thought it was closed. Not closed as in \"not open at the moment\" but closed as in \"wonder how long they have been out of business\".  As it turns out, you just have to catch them at the right time, but it's worth doing - this is a great little hamburger shack where you walk up and order your food, then promptly figure out where you are going to eat it, They do have a few places that you can plop down out front in the parking lot, but most are in the sun, wind and rather uncomfortable at best.  If you live nearby it might be worth heading home, but don't go too far because this isn't travel food. You need to eat it while it's hot."}
{"text":"The BEST hamburger I have ever eaten! I was told it was good but I thought \"a hamburger is a hamburger\". It is like an old fashion,  all the way, to die for, burger. They are fast and inexpensive! I will become me a regular!"}
{"text":"This food is awesome! I had a cheeseburger, cheese fries and a sweet tea. It was so delicious. Perfect all around. Doesn't get much better than this! mmmm."}
{"text":"Excellent hot dogs and burgers!! Order at the walk-up window then they call your number when it's ready. Takeout only. They do have a few picnic tables in front if you want to eat there. Ice cream and shakes are also great. There's always a steady flow of customers which tells me this little joint is popular, and for good reason.  Checkout the menu photos I posted. Cash only!!"}
{"text":"At a crossroad in the middle of the countryside in NC one can find this magical sundae and burger shop. Slide your car up in front of the shop. Then look at all you options. I got a bacon burger and it was awesome. It was just what you want on car cruising type of day.  The cones and milkshakes were not to miss as well. Take in the sights too as many people come and go while cruising on."}
