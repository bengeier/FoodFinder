{"text":"I had the Murtabak with beef from the Malaysian place, which is a tasty concoction of beef and egg wrapped in a thin roti for $7. The stand is operated by a woman at the cash register, and a man making the murtabaks by hand. He spreads a ball of dough, flips it like a pizza to almost a crepe-like thinness, plops it down on a big hot plate, throws in a scoop of your chosen filling (veggie, beef, chicken, or fish), cracks open a fresh egg, smooshes it in with a spoon, and folds it up. It's filling and tasty, even though it doesn't look like much. My Malaysian friend, who ordered the same thing, and said it tasted pretty authentic. I feel like they could do a lot more business if they had another person making food, because while the guy was very skilled, it's easy to get thrown off by how long the line up is."}
{"text":"Just wanted to put it into persepective, 7 bucks for a martabak is on the expensive side, but until there is more selection in terms of malay/indonesian street food this is the only place you can get them other than making them at home.  Also wanted to add, I wish that they offered martabak manis in addition to their martabak telur."}

Some are best cooked to order or served in a Restaurant setting. i.e. overcooked/over-Citrus'd Ceviche Mixto($5.00)"}
