{"text":"Saw this place on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives and had to come try the brioche french toast. We went on a week day and it wasn't very crowded. Everyone seemed to enjoy their food that I was with (people got omelet, the Wolfpack (hash browns with eggs and bacon in between more hash browns) though noone thought it was outstanding.  The brioche french toast I had came with caramelized bananas and pecans and I had to ask for more bananas because I literally was brought 3-4 small slices of banana on top of my french toast and the pecans were all bits and pieces. To their credit, they brought me out a lot more bananas and they were caramelized and in the caramel sauce.  I would definitely return."}
{"text":"I've been here on several occasions. The food is always so yummy. I like to get The Over Easy. So flavorful. The french toast is amazing (both versions), and to top it all off, they have FRESH SQUEEZED OJ!! Omg. I love fresh juice (This also makes for excellent mimosas). The ambiance is nice and casual. They play great music and if you can avoid their busy hour, the wait is never long. I've felt unsure about the service in the past, but had a great experience the last time. Wish I could remember the servers name, but he was very attentive. Overall, definitely recommend for breakfast/brunch"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped into Over Easy for breakfast last weekend. The place was very crowded (as we expected). After waiting for a table for about half an hour, we were seated in a very well decorated restaurant. While I wasn't too crazy about the food, I will say the service was great. Our server (known as Funnyman on the receipt) was the perfect blend of fun and responsible. I honestly wish there were more servers like him at local restaurants. The food is decent, but the service is something to remember."}
{"text":"I wish we would have waited the 90 min. at Snooze where we usually go. We waited 45 minutes for our food to show up from the time we placed our order! The food was completely mediocre for the prices they have the nerve to charge! $5 for a glass of OJ. $2.50 for a regular cup of coffee. Then the waitress comes by to ask if we want a refill, not telling us there are NO refills and charges another $2.50 for each cup!!! The service was crappy. I hate the feeling when you feel like you just threw money away. The quality of the food is just crap! You can go to Snooze for the same price and even less on some items for much better tasting food. They also have no gluten free options, no soy or almond milk. Then we got charged for items that we ordered but never got when the food came out. I will NEVER eat here again. Also, the bathrooms were as dirty as a gas station bathroom which makes you wonder what the kitchen looks like and how clean that is! Total waste of money."}
{"text":"We saw the Food Network's Diners, Dives, and Drive-Ins when my parents were in town.  So, we decided to try it out but went to the Scottsdale location because it was closer than the Phoenix location.  It was on Bell Road right next to the Ice Den.  I guess normally there is a 30 min wait but we got seated right away.  I ordered Omelette #4 (spinach  with tomato, garlic and feta cheese).  It was DELICIOUS!     My mom had the blueberry pancakes and really enjoyed them.  Prices are a little high ($3 for 3 pieces of bacon), but all in all, I thought the food was tasted very good and was filling.  I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"The breakfast at Over Easy is excellent, and Danielle who had to put up with us is funny and took care of us. Make sure you ask for her....!"}
{"text":"Saw it on Diners,drive inns and dives- it is a gem! Glad we went service was awesome,good and rprices great. My only complaint was it dint appear to be very well kept.Dust pictures and baseboards on the walls which you would sit right up to. A good clean could fix all of that! Have already reccomended it to several people and will make it a regular stop..."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE! The service was great here, everyone is so nice and helpful. I went here for only one thing and it was the waffle dog. I definitely recommend it to everyone! The portions are relatively large so the pricing isn't bad. Its a really laid back environment where sitting at the bar isn't bad. Its gets pretty packed just before noon, so get there early."}
{"text":"Presentation is everything and breakfast started with a dirty cup of coffee full of grinds.  The bus boy was walking around with toilet paper stuck to his foot.  Need I say more?"}
{"text":"Visited for the first time this morning and even though it was recommended by a friend who'd dined 2-3 times before I was hesitant seeing all the negative reviews. We thought it was great! Arrived at 8:15, sat on the patio and had great food & service. We had the brioche french toast, waffle dogs & scrambled eggs - all were great! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Wow, as I was going through my reviews I found that someone had deleted my review for over easy..i thought they could not do that.. My whole review focused on the owner and how I saw him in line at safeway buying cheap store brand lunch meat huge packages of it..and how he wears shorts and crocs..i mean cmon buy some pants and real shoes..you have some pretty bad reviews.. Own up and stop buying safeway brand lunch meats..some og your most loyal customers have not returned.."}
{"text":"First time there but $48 for breakfast the only thing that wowed me was the prices: $5 for a glass of orange juice,  $10 for an omelet and I could go on and on; but the flavor and quality of the food just wasn't there."}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday morning and it was 45 min wait, and I'm not quite sure why. I'm starting to think breakfast joints are the way to go in the restaurant biz cuz they're always packed. The food here was good but nothing to die for like Matt's. The omelets and French toast were good (but French toast came out cold), the hashbrowns were excellent, the tater tots were typical, and the homefries were average. I was a fan of the ice coffee with mint in it but I wouldn't recommend it to people who usually drink super sweet coffee beverages. I'm giving this place 2 stars instead of 3 because the wait was unpleasant and the servers were rude, and the hostess was a prima donna."}
{"text":"Hey, guys? Here's another thing that Food Network broadcasts: COOKING SHOWS! This way you can stay home and make something for yourself and then we won't have to read how disappointed you were by your \"small\" portion of french toast that looked bigger on DDD's (just like McDonald's burgers REALLY look juicy in the picture menu!), or that you were hot (you live in Phoenix!! Is this a news flash? Wear a tank-top!), or that the wait was long and you had to stand in your Ugz for 15 minutes (quick! call WHINE-1-1).   I partook of the \"Over Easy\" twice, and clearly had diff'rent experiences from others:  First time, there was no wait. Sat inside with my main squeeze, had a friendly waitress, and enjoyed: I had a truly delicious omelette with salmon, asparagus and goat cheese, hash browns and toast. the omelette was fluffy and nicely done, and the hash browns had that \"glorious brown/gold crust of crunchy heaven\" layer on top.  What'd he have?......Oh, yeah! The egg breakfast - and the eggs were done just right. Both our toasts were in-the-middle. they could do better on their jams: standard issue, and full of corn syrup. Yuck.  Second time: main squeeze + two friends. Sat on the patio (and bypassed a 15 minute wait for indoors). Yes - it was warm, but we knew it would be. There was still a fan and it was still before noon. We survived. Had yet another omelette - even BETTER the second go-around. My bud had fluffy, golden brown, delicious looking blueberry pancakes - with the blueberries underneath ( I snuck a bite), the squeeze had eggs and tots (which were crispy and not too greasy), and the other bud had a sausage omelette (which he sung the praises of).  It was charmingly ludicrous how many times we got offered water refills (they REALLY wanted the patio patrons to be hydrated and happy - it was nice to see). I also had a lemonade with mint (house-made and oooooh so nice).  What made it nice was our sassy waitress Sarah (who still hasn't hiked Squaw Peak and playfully razzed us for having come from doing just that). She was attentive, funny, easy-going,  and knew the menu. The patio, in fact, was quite a-buzz with attentive staff (with water pitchers).  I will be returning.  So, um.....yeah - it' a small place. You can see that going in. If there's not enough elbow room for you to show off your new handbag or your 12th piercing, this place might not be for you. And yeah - the patio is OUTSIDE (gasp!!). Have a glass of water before-hand and quit yer' bitchin'! Hydrate!  Oh, and P.s? Matt's Big \"B\" only got big because it was on TV. The wait there is just as long, the place even more cramped, and the prices the same. Stop being lemmings."}
{"text":"We started going to Over Easy when they were on 40th st.  Why did they ever move?? We were at the new place once and that was enough.  The old place was quaint and the servers were great, very personable.  The new place is echoy(kids yelling and crying is magnified to another level) and impersonal.  I like the carmelized banana and pecan french toast.  The item I loved is no longer on the menu.  My husband likes the L.E.O.  Tried the Scottsdale location and the waitstaff give off an attitude.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Mediocre taco-bell remodel serves decent faire.  First of all, the patio is UGLY.  Cheap varnished pine slats and chairs colors that don't match the table color make this a quirky place that appears thrown together.    The food *was* good, but too expensive for the (lack of) atmosphere - a waffle, 1 egg, 3 strips of bacon is $9.    Cramped seating makes this a poor option for kids."}
{"text":"So I have eaten at this place twice and the reason I give it 2 stars is primarily the atmosphere and very friendly staff. The ambience is cool, fresh and bright. The staff is very attentive and nice.  Now to the food. Very mediocre. Had a hard time believing it was on the food network. The Wolfpack was just a plain tasting meal. And the second time I went I ordered chicken fried steak. The gravy was sooo bland I scraped it off the meat. The home fries were also kind of lackluster compared to other breakfast eateries in Gilbert such as Liberty Market or the Farmhouse just as examples.  What really had me miffed on the second visit, my friend and I sat at the bar. Shortly after we arrived another couple sat next to us. We all waited about 20 minutes maybe a little more for our food. But the couple that sat next to us got their meal paid for bc of the wait and my friend and I didn't. We waited just as long and also had a single item each. Just didn't seem right but all I can say is that I have no imnmediate plans to return. I believe two chances is enough especially after this incident."}
{"text":"Ordered the Healthy choice with White egg and wild mushrooms; it was tasty I love mushrooms so very happy there were many.  There could have been a bit more white egg plus blending in much better with mushrooms too..Looked like mushrooms just dumped on top.  I was disappointed with the side serving of uncored green raw extremely thin sliced tomato. Thought there was not alot of love put into it.  Atmosphere was stuffy not over freindly servers didnt smile or offer suggestions to get more of my business....hmmmm??? My expectation was higher out of an Aaron May establishment."}
{"text":"I love this place. Walking distance from my home.  This is the best breakfast in town.  Worth the table wait and only open till 1:00 pm but just wonderful.   The French Toast is to die for, the hollandaise sauce is homemade light and a touch of lemon, country gravy is the best. They do have a light menu but this is not a diet place.  Order several things and share. Best in town"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with a friend, on the recommendation of another friend of hers.  I had the Croatian Spinach Loaf, basically a loose quiche covered in sauteed spinach and melted cheese, with a side of fruit.  It was delicious!! My friend had the Wolfpack, which is best described as breakfast sandwich with has browns in the place of bread. Also quite tasty.   The place is casual and the staff friendly, especially the hostess, who came over and chatted with us for several minutes. I will definately put this on my rotation of places for breakfast!"}
{"text":"I eat here a lot and it's usually pretty consistent. They have MANY yummy options. Sometimes their fried stuff (tots, waffle dogs, etc.) are overdone and taste greasy, their Jalapeño biscuits and gravy are super tasty but they have overcooked them a time or two. That being said, if I ever have an issue, they always graciously apologize and take care of it which rights any wrong in my eyes.   It's not wether you make mistakes but how you fix them that matters. Thanks Over Easy for making my family happy time and time again!   Oh, one thing that would make my family even happier would be a kid's plate (like some cereal and sliced bananas) since the waits can be very long and little ones tend to get cranky."}
{"text":"Went here because of its feature on food network, nothing stood out here didn't feel like anything special."}
{"text":"I had the 2 egg breakfast with a coffee and it was so delicious. The waitresses were so tentative and nice. I really like this place and it will have to turn into a regular place to go for breakfast."}
{"text":"Average service. Bad food. I had Eggs Benedict and the english muffin was burnt so bad I almost could not saw through it with my knife. Hollandaise was tasteless. I was surprised they would bring the food to me like this.  There are MANY better options in the area. Skip this one.  On a side note: they seemed to not mind a customer having her dog in the outside eating area. I am a dog lover, but this is disgusting. Your dog does not belong at a restaurant! She should have been asked to leave."}
{"text":"Yes the Guy  phenomenon from DDD is annoying. This place is for Arcadians to to feel warm and fuzzy about seeing their neighbor there. Food is nothing great at all. Too small and long wait for bad results. How can you screw up breakfast? Don't bother unless you need to be seen by your neighbor. Wildflower is 30 seconds up the road and waaaayy better."}
{"text":"Service was great, atmosphere was okay but the food was sub par. I ordered the avocado eggs Benedict with home fries on the side. The eggs were overcooked and the hollandaise sauce was definitely not made in house. If I were ever to come back here. I would go with a different choice."}
{"text":"Rebecca's reviews: parent edition. My parents watch a lot of food network, so they insisted we stop in! This place is oh so cute. My parents were pleased, they said they couldn't see the restaurant decor around Guy Fieri's spiky hair on the tv.  Anyway. The food was good! Especially the waffle dogs, basically a state fair deep fried breakfast sausage. Delicious. The eggs Benedict was done to perfection. My dad says \"the eggs properly drained when pierced with a fork\" and \"good amalgamation of flavors.\" My mom says \"Tom! Who describes things that way!?\" I got the chilaquiles, which were the only \"meh\" of the day. We came to the consensus that they could use more eggs and salsa.  Overall a good breakfast with many more interesting menu items I want to try. Would you go back? \"Yes!\" Mom says. \"If she says so,\" Dad says."}
{"text":"Over Easy has AMAZING food!! I suggest the Wolfpack breakfast with garlic and jalapeño cheddar biscuits and sausage gravy.   Yummo!!!!"}
{"text":"Good spot for a late breakfast.      Delicious entrees but a little short staffed on a late monday morning.     Probably had more to do with the onslaught of the stagemom/figureskating crowd next door at the ice den so I presume it was an \"off\" day for the staff.     Had the hamsteak with redeye gravy which was good.   The wife had an omelete which turned out delicious as well.     Solid breakfast joint and will return!"}
{"text":"Over Easy has been a favorite breakfast location of mine for quite a while now!  The wait staff are friendly and they have a great patio for enjoying breakfast outside on beautiful, sunny mornings.  The \"Selena\" is my go-to item of choice - love it!"}
{"text":"Very good.  There is usually a wait if you are there before noon.  Worth the wait though.  Banana french toast is good and not overly sweet - half order is fine!  Wolfpack is good but it is a hellalotta food.  Will try the waffle dogs next time (I think that's what they were called!)  Good service always."}
{"text":"We waited over 15 minutes to be seated at an empty table.   We then waited over ten minutes for our waitress to arrive, let me clarify this is an extremely small restaurant and there were several servers.  Once we ordered coffee we waited over ten minutes for her to return. The coffee was horrid, so bitter we almost couldn't drink it.  I ordered the burrito with ham and onions, 30 minutes after we ordered the waitress came back to make sure my order was correct, I informed her what she said was not correct, she then said she would go to the kitchen to make sure it was made right. Low and behold I get my burrito with the incorrect ingredients and missing key elements. The two other people that were with me had food that was ice cold and chicken and waffles that were definitely refried several times.  The next time the waitress returned was with the bill, not even to check and see how the food was. After over an hour of our experience the table behind us had still not received our food, and they were sat long before us.  Avoid this place if you want any kind of service and decent food."}
{"text":"Our server was amazing, our brunch was perfectly prepared...pork green chili over grits, french toast and veggie omelet...fresh squeezed orange juice...it was a great way to start the day...have to go back just to try all the other items they offer.."}
{"text":"This has become our new fav breakfast spot. Chicken and waffles are excellent. Kid friendly which is one of the reasons we like this spot. Must try"}
{"text":"Over Easy is pretty good. I wouldn't say it is the most amazing breakfast place ever, but it is decent and reasonably priced. I've eaten the waffle dogs, pancakes, and El Pollo Loco omelette. My favorite was probably the pancakes. They were really big and perfectly cooked. The waffle dogs were about the same as the pancake dogs you can buy at the grocery store. The omelette didn't have much seasoning and the chicken was a little dry. It was cooked well though. The hash browns and home fries don't have much seasoning either. I like a little salt on my potatoes, so I have to add some every time I order them.  The staff is nice and the manager always makes his rounds asking everyone about their food. We've never had a long wait even when it seems busy.  I will definitely go back, but I will probably just stick to pancakes."}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for sub-average food, poor service, and a lasting impression that you just got ripped off, come on down to Gilbert Over Easy!  Our waiter visited our table no more than three times, and argued with us when she did show up. Want a refill? Too bad! What is this, Village Inn? Looking at the menu, where they have a few unique items, they have no combinations which ensured us an expensive tab for breakfast.  Despite being recently featured in the New Times for their Chicken and Waffles, they have no appropriate condiments. No ranch, no honey mustard, no honey, just hot sauce. Our server even had the audacity to argue with us about what we should enjoy on our chicken. She stopped short of calling us liars, at least.  When our food did arrive, it had the texture of rubber combined with the delectable flavor of cardboard. There was one exception -- my Eggs Benedict was a flavorless soggy mess.   When it was time to leave, our server really shined! Previously absent, she made two surprise entrances to rapidly usher us out the door. We were left confused and unsatisfied, like our first high school dance.  Seriously, Over Easy, get it together."}
{"text":"I was in town for a friends wedding and this little place happened to be near my hotel. I'm so glad I went! There's usually one thing I notice a restaurant can work on ( I've worked in customer service since I was 18, so I notice these things. ), but this place was perfect! The service was impeccable, the coffee hot and strong, the staff polite and friendly, the atmosphere warm and inviting, and lady but not least, my breakfast was spot on. The hash browns weren't oily or overly crispy, my gluten free pancakes were some of the best I've ever tried ( yes they have gluten free options ) and my eggs and bacon were cooked just the way I like them! I wish I had written this review sooner because I now cannot remember the names of my servers, but the lovely young lady who hosts is such a gem and the woman who was my server was such a treat and so courteous! I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"We love this Over Easy. The food is fresh and delicious. I especially like the egg white and aspargus omelette. Our 22 yr old son loves the WOlf pack and our 13 yr old like the chocolate pancake. Big Daddy and I often share the lox and onions with egg whiles. DIVINE.  Betsy as the new GM has made a tremendous improvement in the atmostphere and fun of the place. Sam is a great server and they run a well oiled machine. They know their regulars and they take care of them. Eat there once or twice a week. Love it!"}
{"text":"Disaster. Victim of their own success. Great food, but should be avoided at all costs. Lousy, lousy service. How can scrambled eggs take an hour to cook?"}
{"text":"Food came out cold, tastes mediocre, and they refused to take their own living social deal. The place is also dirty and poorly lit."}
{"text":"My colleague found this restaurant at random while we were visiting Phoenix from Dallas. I had ordered pancakes, eggs, bacon, hashbrowns and was going to settle for Coffee when the waiter told me that they have a really great black tea. Shortly after ordering, he brought a teapot loaded with Chai tea and a container of Honey. Although I consider myself somewhat of a entry-level tea connoisseur, I must admit that this was simply the best tea I had ever had. Additionally, the overall experience of this restaurant is amazing and it shows at about 9AM when the diner is completely packed. This was the highlight of my first trip to Phoenix! Thanks"}
{"text":"I live a few blocks away and I love breakfast, so I'm really pulling for this place to get their act together. This review is aimed squarely at management. I want your restaurant to survive! Stop making this so hard!  I've gone to the Farmer's Ave Over Easy three times. Each visit was on a Sunday. Each visit it wasn't particularly busy.  1) The food is pretty solid. That's why I'm pulling for them to right this ship.  2) Both times the service has been beyond bad. Despite us each time being the server's only table, we couldn't get a drink refill to save our lives. The servers all look particularly unhappy and miserable. Perhaps the manager isn't easy to work with, but they drop off your first round of drinks, and then you're left to literally wave them down each time you want more diet coke or water. I had to wave down our waitress three times this last Sunday to get a refill on my diet coke (the cups are very, very small.) The waitresses are all behind the large counter and they seem to be more preoccupied with counting receipts, or wrapping silverware, or being on their phones. They don't look up. They don't even talk to each other. They look pretty unhappy to be at Over Easy.  3) This last visit I went to order an omelet and the waitress told me they were out of bacon and ham. Pretty much the only thing more ridiculous for a breakfast place to be out of would be eggs. It's bacon and ham! That's like half your menu, gone!  Honestly, if I didn't know better, I would think they're trying to make this place go out of business. The food isn't as good as Tempe favorite NCounter, but Over Easy is at least as good as Tempe's Snooze. The difference is that a) Snooze hasn't run out of bacon and ham, and b) Snooze's servers apparently don't hate their jobs."}
{"text":"Saw this restaurant on Diners, Drive Ins and Dives and had to come here when visiting Phoenix.  And this place didn't disappoint!  The caramel apple mimosa, eggs Benedict, and of course the waffle dogs.  So yummy. Our server was great!  We sat at the counter and enjoyed talking with other servers and manager.  This is a must do again when back in area!"}
{"text":"They ruined it by moving... The new location is awful, I was literally shoved around by servers trying to get to my table. The wait outside was bad and then the wait to get served was even worse. Not worth the hassle any more. We will not be going back."}
{"text":"This is the second Over Easy restaurant, and I am updating my original review which was done just 5 days after it opened. The patio is inviting. The front room is sort of weird in decor. The backroom is like a high school cafeteria and needs an ambiance fix. It's basically breakfast food with a few twists, like malted waffles and pancakes with Reece's pieces. The service and food have improved, and I have been back a few times for breakfast. I can't comment on the lunch menu. Hey, this is not a destination place--but there's not alot of options in this neck of Scottsdale, and if you are ice skating at the den, hiking or working out nearby, hit the patio for breakfast."}
{"text":"I am very disappointed with my experience here. This was our (my husband, daughter and myself) 3rd visit and while not impressed our previous times today was a disaster. The hostess was extremely rude, the service was non existent and the food was cold. The table next to us got their food, ate and left before we got our order with no apologies or explanations. We had brought a guest with us and frankly I was embarrassed because the location was my choice. I don't see how this place rates the rave reviews I have heard. I am not sure if it's because we have a small child and they are targeting the hipster crowd but we felt very unwelcomed and unwanted there. Very sad and we will not be going back."}
{"text":"I would not go back. The quiche like dish that I had with so burnt on one corner that I could not stick a fork in it. We told the waitress they did nothing about it. The other omelette was overdone they need to figure out something other than breakfast to serve."}
{"text":"There server sucks 100 degrees outside.she asked if we could sit outside.also they couldn't make my daughter a grilled cheese.I guess no cheese n white bread.your better off going to ihop!"}
{"text":"Oh Over Easy, you taco bell looking motherfucker. I had such high hopes for this place, I mean the only thing better than breakfast in my book is MAGIC and well there wasn't a whole lot of that coming from my meal. I ordered steak and eggs (a classic) which was like 7 or 8 bucks (in the back of my mind I knew there was a hitch), but instincts aside I was still hyped, sadly like most things in my life disappointment:)  The \"Steak\" basically was badly seasoned deli roast beef stacked over my horribly cooked eggs, my plate was over flowing with watery steak juice it really should have been served in a bowl it was gross I mean gross, the coffee drink was good (kinda girly) and the decor was aiight.   So if you find yourself waking up sunday morning smelling like crown royal and cigarettes with someone you barely know and never want to know again take them here.  Oh yeah \"Matt's makes this place look like a cracked out denny's or taco bell (ha because it used to be one I know I'm lame) zing.\""}
{"text":"Want to find out how to ruin something as simple as corned beef hash?? Come to Over Easy to find out!! Wooo Hooo!  Wish Yelp had a NO star option."}
{"text":"The cornbeef hash is awesome. The butternut squash french toast should not be served as breakfast, it is a rich, heavy dessert. The sauce to those french toast, however, should be on the table! The service was great, though I never judge a restaurant for service. Food establishments serve one purpose, to serve food! Anyway, everyone should try the crazy chicken dish, it's tasty, no wonder it is so popular. oh, and the lemonade, is also delicious! I don't know that it is on my list of \"return\" restaurants, but it was good for breakfast."}
{"text":"What a Great Place to have Breakfast/Brunch!  We stopped in on a Monday Morning and the place was packed but we still received good service and a great meal. I had the sirloin and eggs with Camelized onion and Jalapenos. What a unique and well done breakfast combo.  Steak was tender and plenty of it as well, the jalapenos and onions packed a great punch against the creamy and perfectly cooked eggs. The problem is there are so many good things on the menu I will just have to come back to try them all, deciding what to order was a dilemma to say the least.  My dad had the Salmon Benedict. He said it was the best breakfast he has had in a very long time. Perfectly poached eggs and homemade hollandaise sauce were key according to him, but the real star was the thinly sliced fresh and smoky salmon.  I guess this will be the next thing I get!  Way to go Over Easy, you are a must try when in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Food was good but not great. I had the Chicken fried steak and the only complaint was that it wasn't crispy but soggy from frying. The prices were a bit more than you regular breakfast establishment  but service was good. One other thing cost this place a star.... the noise. Busy places have noise but a restaurant should be able to find decor elements to keep sound from echoing so bad... this is not a place to have a conversation in."}
{"text":"One of my favorite meals in life is blueberry pancakes. The blueberry pancakes here need an urgent makeover, stat! I believe the blueberries were canned or frozen but definitely not the size or taste of a fresh berry. And the blueberry glob was spooned into the middle of the pancake upon cooking so the only time a blueberry is consumed is when you get to the center, which is a huge disappointment. Finally I feel the pancakes are overcooked or the mix balance needs adjustment, a great blueberry pancake is soft, fluffy, digestible and takes u back to grandma's kitchen. These were leathery, heavy in the stomach and unsatsifying. For the love of blueberry pancakes please show the pancake gods that better can be done."}
{"text":"Very, Very Good!  A bit of a wait, but not bad.  Freshly made sourdough bread, beautifully made omelettes, and the bacon, Oh the bacon.  Tastes like real-cured, old-world style.  Awesome!  Give it a 5!"}
{"text":"I've been to this establishment a few times and always remembered the food being good.   This time, not so much. I had the 3 egg white and sirloin plus hash browns. The food was just okay. I expected the sirloin to come out crispy but it was more like they boiled the meat. The only thing that saved the meal was the caramelized onions.   All in all I won't be coming back. There are way better breakfast places to eat at. Try Snooze. There maybe a line but it'll be worth it."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Had two $20 groupons. Even at nearly half price, it was a bad deal. First meal was a burrito. Large, but even with sausage, was amazingly tasteless. My wife had lemon-ricotta pancakes and could taste neither. Used second Groupon 2 weeks later hoping different items would impress us. My corned beef eggs Benedict was awful. Corned beef was mushy like cat food and barely a teaspoon of hollandaise sauce. Did not finish (and I was hungry). Wife had French toast and said it was good. Expected so much more after reading Yelp. Either they had all their relatives write glowing reviews or they got a good TV review then stopped trying. Sorry for the bad review, but really disappointed....twice!"}
{"text":"Been there about a couple of times now, have been very disappointed and urge people to look for a decent breakfast elsewhere.  The first time we went, my wife and I put our names down and were told it would be 20-30 mins wait. A family arrived shortly after us and were told the same thing. After around 15 minutes and elderly couple arrived and were told that there was a wait. The elderly lady complained outside saying that they were regulars and shouldn't have to wait. Two minutes later, the hostess came out the door, walked past ourselves and the other family, and escorted the elderly couple in. Of course we all complained and the hostess commented she didn't realize that we had all been out there longer. The manager defended her saying that \"this can sometimes happen\". So we left.   Just last weekend, we thought we would try again. Actually got in straight away and had our two year old with us, so our hopes were up. Then we got served, literally. The coffee tasted like water with a couple of soaked coffee beans. The waitress was a no show after taking our order. Never asked how things were or if we were after anything else. Our water and coffee flavored water was never refilled even though we did ask for it, twice. Our food, which took about 30 minutes to arrive, was originally delivered to the wrong table, and when we did get it, was flavorless, bland and cool. The manger then came by asking if everything is \"wonderful\". By that I'm sure he meant was the tv station on the right channel, because it certainly wasn't the food or service.  When we left, we finally saw our waitress, and over heard her complaining to the manager that we had been there too long, had backed up traffic outside and her tips were going to suck. Here's a tip for you young lady, actually be a waitress, check on us every now and then and find out why our flavorless crud of a breakfast is taking so long so that we can get out sooner.  We will never be going back, \"wonderful\" isn't a word associated with Over Easy and I whole heartily suggest that you all look for somewhere else."}
{"text":"You know, I really wanted to like this place. My boyfriend and I have driven by many times, but never had a chance to stop in until today.  When we walked in there was a gentleman (possibly the owner??) sitting at the host stand doing a crossword - he stopped promptly and seated us.   The atmosphere was cute, we sat outside on the patio and looked over the paper menu while we waiting for our server (you think they could afford to at least laminate the things). When our server came I asked about the Over Easy Ice (basically an iced coffee with sweetened condensed milk and spices) and he pretty much had no clue what I was talking about - he didn't know the menu at all.  We started with the raz cranberry scone with vanilla bean creme freche. It came to the table drizzled in honey and had a huge mound of the cheese on it. As soon as I took a bite I was dissapointed. The scone was stale, like, second day stale. What a bummer, especially because it totally had the potential to be really amazing.  I ordered the mushroom scallion cheese omelette. It was something you would find a Denny's for a lot less. Greasy, greasy, greasy. My boyfriend got the smoked salmon with asparagus - he liked it. His meal was pretty much the only good thing on the table. He got the sourdough toast, which came dry without any butter - not even on the side. It was left untouched on the table.  What a let down. With their hip signage and atmosphere, this place could be so much better than it is.  And for heaven's sake - use fresh scones!!!"}
{"text":"Bad service! The malted waffle for $5.00 looked and tasted like a toaster waffle. We went here because the rating was good but........."}
{"text":"Poor service. I don't get why this place gets so much business. They are lucky there's not much else around Arcadia....otherwise any place that values service even slightly more would crush it. I've yet to have a decent service experience...just a bit sleepy when it comes to focusing on the customer."}
{"text":"Love this place! Used to come here every Sunday with my husband and always order crying pig omelet, what a great treat for pregnant woman!!! Service is always friendly and fast, we never had to wait."}
{"text":"Not very friendly staff. I'm not really sure our waitress said more than 5 words to us.  She never asked us how are food was or if we needed anything. She came up & placed our bill down on the table & walked away.   The food.....hubby ordered an expensive waffle that was small, but he did enjoy his side of breakfast sausage. I ordered the chicken fried steak...YUCK!! How can gravy that has bacon pieces in it be BLAND?! I'm not sure how that happens, but they seem to have mastered it. The chicken fried steak was WAY to over cooked and had NO flavor.   We will not be back."}
{"text":"This place is for sure on the top of my breakfast list!!  I wasn't very hungry so I just ordered the blueberry pancakes and man were they tasty!! They were LOADED with blueberries and topped with powdered sugar, they just melted in my mouth, my 10 month old tried blueberry pancakes for the first time and loved them as well.  I ordered one scrambled egg for my little one and she gobbled it right up!! The egg was cooked perfectly, buttery and fluffy.  I also ordered a side of bacon, crispy, delicious and flavorful.  The only downfall is the place is pretty small, but the food makes up for that :)  The menu doesn't have a huge selection, which is refreshing as most places hand you a book to look over and it takes you 30 mins just to decide what you want.  We will be going back soon!"}
{"text":"Love the Loretta sandwich.  Ask for it with an egg on top- gets all gooey and delicious.    They changed breads, though, and it's not as good.    Friendly staff, little or no wait (if you go at the right time), and good prices.  Great coffee, hash browns, muffins, etc."}
{"text":"Cold syrup for the pancakes. Cheap silverware. Noisy. Dirty carpet at entrance. Won't be back. Waitress was attentive."}
{"text":"Fast, consistent, friendly, inexpensive. Good food with No attitude-everything one wants In a fast casual breakfast diner!"}
{"text":"TERRIBLE SERVICE!! Had family visiting from out of town. We waited over an hour and still had not been served. Had only seen our waitress twice. Other takes with the same amount of people who came well after us were being served before us. After an hour and 20 minutes, we just got up and left. I told our manager to which he responded with, \"well, sorry.\" I will never go here again, and would absolutely not recommend it!!! If it gave me the selection to choose zero stars, I would."}
{"text":"I went to new location so excited.. What I found was today at 8:30 am was a rude waitress and manager more intrested in eating his breakfast. The waffle dogs was dry and the piggy thing was rubber. I was super let down at this place. Never again!"}
{"text":"One of the first breakfast stops I tried when I moved to Phoenix.  My boyfriend and I stopped in during a weekday, immediate service and attentive waiters. I believe his name was Andy, he recommended the Wolf Pack and the French Toast... neither of us were disappointed!  So much flavor and perfection! Andy also named off a few other breakfast stops for us to make around Phoenix. He was so knowledgeable and outgoing, he really made a great impression on us! Can't wait to stop in again!"}
{"text":"A few weeks ago a friend sent me a text message of what looked like corndogs with powdered sugar on them. The caption read \"You have to check this place out\". Being a person that believes that any food you put on a stick must be delicious, I was intrigued and found out later that those were NOT corndogs, rather they were Waffle Dogs... a piece of sausage, dipped in waffle batter, and deep fried. SOLD!  After a morning hike the hubs and I headed over to the Over Easy location on Indian School and we did wait about 20 minutes to be seated. The restaurant was full of people, always a good sign.  We sat down, were greeted by a very busy, but friendly, server. We ordered the waffle dogs, the hubs got the 'wolf pack' and I ordered off the menu, just an egg, some tomatoes and toast. (Sadly, I am watching what I eat, and figured that the waffle dogs were more than enough to guilt me the rest of the day)  The table behind us asked the same server what Over Easy was known for, and his answer \"We are known for everything except for our healthy options\". I laughed because the joint DOES have some great healthy options, including omelets, yogurt with granola, etc however those don't hold a candle to the incredibly creative and delicious options that the menu is filled with.  Both of our orders were delicious, and we will definitely be back. If you haven't been to either location, I highly suggest you check it out. Local, fun, creative and delicious. Annie likes."}
{"text":"I have never had an experience like this for breakfast. The restaurant itself is so cute, which is why I thought I was going to love the place. BUT, unfortunately that wasn't the case. We ordered our food, waited a decent time to get it.. when it was brought to us I asked for ketchup for my eggs and apparently I was forgotten because it was never brought. As we were waiting my friend realized he never got his potatoes.. So not only are we waiting for ketchup and potatoes but to actually start our meals but we are waiting on the waitress to actually for once come and check on us so we can let her know. We ended up having to ask the bus boy ( who had the best customer service btw) that is the only reason I kept my calm. At this point I've lost my appetite. My eggs were cold.. The banana nut French toast was not so great. This meal ended up being 37 dollars. Completely NOT worth it. I couldn't believe I was paying for this horrible service.. Definitely won't be returning OR recommending this place."}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for breakfast places so I've been meaning to try Over Easy for a long time.  I finally went there this Sunday morning.  Although the place was packed, the wait was relatively short (~10 mins).  They sat us in a corner of the restaurant behind some sort of partition.  As my friend put it, \"it's like sitting at the kids' table.\"  Our area, with 4 tables, is sort of separated from the rest of the restaurant.  Although a little strange, at least it was quieter.  They pack so many tables in the room that I think it may be a fire hazard.   Either way, I ignored the thought of a flaming death and went on to enjoy my food.  The waffle dogs are actually very good.  It's not greasy at all.  The batter had good flavor and the sausage was not too salty or greasy.  The sauce brought just the right amount of sweetness.  Overall, a very balanced dish.  My friend's caramelized banana french toast looked awesome, while my corned beef hash with eggs was also very nicely done.  I would probably prefer a little more corned beef and a little less potato in the dish though.    Overall, I will be back for more breakfast goodness."}
{"text":"Maybe I just expected too much after seeing them on Diners Drive-Ins and Dives, but  wasn't all that impressed. Maybe I didn't order the right thing, but it was just average. Better than Denny's lol. I was not crazy about the bratwurst sausage patty. I ordered it as an extra and was expecting regular breakfast sausage.  The prices and portions were good, will probably return, but not going to make an extra effort"}
{"text":"I don't live in the Valley, but do visit often for business. I've been wanting to try it the last 4 times I've been in town and finally made it in on New years eve. This time the wait was only 20 minutes, in the past it's been an hour or longer. The food was very good and I love the sweet potato tots! However, I was disappointed with the service. I don't know if they were short staffed, but I had to flag down our server for items that weren't brought out with the food that had been requested when we placed our order. We were never checked on until we were almost done eating. I will probably go back again as long as there isn't a wait..."}
{"text":"easy place to have a great breakfast..Nice dark hair waitress does a good job of taking orders fast..Enjoyed"}
{"text":"I heard that there are only two good Breakfast places in phoenix: Over Easy and Matts Big Breakfast.  I am a big fan of quality breakfast and am pretty picky about them.  This Over Easy location stops seating at about 11:30am.  Frankly, I think thats ridiculously early so i Inquired as to why.  I was told that they would stay open later, but as a part of their lease they have to close early because they share a parking lot with the neighbors.  Their Scottsdale location stays open later and the menu is exactly the same.    We got there around 10:45 on Saturday.  The wait for a table for 2 was about 30 min. They have a pot of coffee out, with a sign that says \"help yourself to coffee while you wait, we will be happy to add it to your check.\"  Listen up.  If i am waiting to eat at your place, you can at least give me the coffee for free while i wait.  If im drinking coffee BEFORE i sit down.  There is a damn good chance that i will order a cup when i get to the table, just charge me for it then.  I was peeved by this.  Its coffee for gods sake.    Once we got our table, one of us ordered the Pecan Banana French Toast, the other got an Omelet.  The food was good, arrived quickly and the chef came around to several tables to see how everything was.    Contrary to what others said, the portions were average and were what we expected.  The service wasnt bad either.  The place was pretty crowded and they still managed to keep my coffee cup full and the food came out quickly.    I dont think there is really anything spectacular about this joint, the food was good, the menu was standard.  But its pretty good and we'll probably come back."}
{"text":"I have been to the other site in Phoenix, so I was excited to see one near me. Had early breakfast to celebrate New Years. Had the traditional Eggs Benedict. Really yummy. The hollendaise was perfect, as was the poached eggs. Even the muffin was better than most. Sweet potato lots are crisp and tasty. Will come back again not only for the food, but for the great service."}
{"text":"The first thing we saw was a line of empty concrete benches outside the door and a  \"please wait to be seated sign\". There is a reason why the sign is outside - there is no room inside for waiting.  We're not sure if you're supposed to automatically park yourself on the benches or go inside first to sign in or what.   The interior feels like a 'pop-up' restaurant, where they went to a dollar store for supplies, others may find it unique or kitschy.    Since it was our first time here, in we went.  A few moments looking around for someone to catch our eye, a gentleman filling water glasses beckoned us to an empty table.  Since our placemat was our menu, we began looking for what to order.  A waitress came to our table a few moments later, and indicated she had a table of 3 and a two top would be available momentarily.  She used a lot of words, without actually saying she wanted us to vacate, and she certainly didn't indicate where we were supposed to vacate to.  When I ask if she was trying to say that the other waiter wasn't supposed to seat us and did she want us to move, she changed her mind and told us to forget about it.  I'm sorry, but this is incredibly poor hosting skills.  We ordered an omlette with mushrooms, onions, ham and american cheese, which came with a side of potatoes,  also ordered were the cheddar jalapeno biscuits with sausage gravy.  Let me say that I LOVE biscuits and gravy - but will only order them if them come with sausage gravy because I detest the flavor of wet flour that restaurants serve as \"country\" gravy.  What I got could in no way be considered sausage gravy - it was country gravy with a piece of a link added on top of a biscuit.  The concept of this is awesome, the reality is awful.  Thankfully my eating companion didn't find them as gross as I did and switched meals with me.  The omlette and potatoes\american fries, were fine.  Between the rude reception from the waitress and the less than stellar food, we won't be returning."}
{"text":"I ordered Chilaquiles.  $8.50 - the menu is very vague, I would recommend asking what their version of a specific dish is because I was fairly disappointed with mine.  I received a platter of chips, cheese , salsa n an egg prepared over easy.  Looked like a platter of nachos.  They had missed one ingredient...chicken.  They apologized and asked if they could just give me a side of chicken. Then they gave me 20% off of my bill...not sure how I feel about that.  Anyway...just ask questions before you order!"}
{"text":"Love the food!  Have been about a dozen times now.  So many mixed feelings about it not being terribly packed when we go.  I want them to succeed but love being able to be seated usually in less than 15 minutes.  Chicken and waffles is my favorite, my teenager loves the chocolate chip pancakes.   Hubby is thrilled to have a nice bloody mary selection.   Definitely in my fav's!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place. We don't have very many good breakfast places near our house and we were so excited to find this place! We have been going there every weekend for a couple months now. My favorite is the croatian spinach loaf although the pancakes are always good. And I'm normally a pancake and french toast kind of girl but this is so good I don't miss them! My husband has tried the breakfast burrito, omelates, steak and eggs plus the chilaquiles. All very good! Everyone is really nice and the manager and one of the servers, Laura, always come up to say hi which I like. I feel at home here and we plan on making this our regular breakfast place."}
{"text":"This may be the best breakfast place I have ever been to. The biscuits and gravy is to die for. Its has this crazy chowder taste, that is so different, but unbelievable. The buiscuits have jalepenos, which are so good. The fried egg sandwich with sausage is amazing as well. I really dont know how they do it, but it is truly amazing."}
{"text":"A great place for a great breakfast. I am so glad it is so close to where we live. Not fancy,but very good food and service."}
{"text":"I enjoy coming here.  I usually get there very early when it's not busy so I've not had any service issues.  I've tried several things on the menu and some I liked better than others. They have lots of interesting choices and standard breakfast fare. I love loko moko. My husband enjoys the eggs and sirloin.  Staff has always been friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"A good friend highly recommended Over Easy, and since going out to breakfast is one of my favorite activities I was excited about trying this little restaurant.  We arrived around 845, the restaurant was busy but they were able to seat us right away on the patio. It was warm outside and their drip was not turned on.  Our waitress was civil but not friendly and our questions about the menu were given short answers.  I told her it was our first visit, but her attitude was flippant.   My son ordered two eggs, bacon, and a pancake. The eggs, over easy, were cold. Bacon was good. The pancake was fluffy, nutty tasting, but the syrup was served in a squeeze bottle. It was thin and tasted like fake syrup. He wasn't impressed. And he said he didn't want to give the restaurant a second try. He is  teenage boy and he eats everything. That speaks volumes for the food served today.  I tried the country eggs Benedict over a cheddar jalapeño biscuit. The waitress said the hollandaise was good and made in the restaurant but said the gravy was also good. I asked if I could try hollandaise on one and gravy on the other. A half  and half. The hollandaise had no flavor. The gravy had chunks of sausage and was pretty good. The biscuit was dry and heavy... Not good. I love spicy but this didn't really have spice. And our waitress charged me for the gravy.  The poached egg was undercooked. The hash browns, although generous in serving size, were mushy mixed with a few crisp shreds.  Our waitress walked by several times without stopping to offer refills or check in. I noticed her giving two tables refills and then presenting them with the check. So at least I knew I would get a refill once I got my check.  It was a disappointing Saturday morning breakfast.  We have other restaurants in the area that are not franchises that serve up consistently tasty and affordable breakfast entrees with service that is friendly and courteous.  Over Easy... We are over you."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Every time I go there I have such a great meal!  The staff is so nice and can't seem to do enough for me.  I love the new  breakfast burrito on the menu called the Selena (eggs, hashbrowns and your choice of 3 items inside)!  Yum!!!.  I have come here with some of my friends that have young kids and the staff is so sweet to them!  The omelette's are so big and good!  I never leave hungry!  There may be a wait, but I find it is worth it!"}
{"text":"The food is ok. Mostly bland and they're not very accommodating however everything is fresh and made from scratch. Their potatoes are delicious. Average customer service but they do offer discounts and coupons which is good because they're quite expensive. Overall we go back because of the freshness of the food."}
{"text":"I must tell all, definitely worth a try for breakfast! And besides the food being fresh, filling and great, the staff is wonderful!"}
{"text":"Watched the clip on triple D and REALLY wanted to like it, but I have to agree with another re viewer's assessment that this place should be called over-rated.   Checked it out last weekend with the BF.  Half order of Banana-Pecan french toast, side of hash.  My French toast was completely deflated in the center by the time it got to me.  The tiny bits of banana  were not sufficient for the portion of toast. The sauce, eh...nothing special.   Hash was under seasoned and my BF reported the CF steak could use some help as well.   Maybe we just ordered their 2 worst dishes, but I'm not willing to go back and try anything else.  Positives were the service was fast and friendly and the wait really wasn't that long, even for the weekend."}
{"text":"Found this on DDD website. It's cute and the menu is interesting. We chose this restaurant because the dish Gary's Croation Spinach Loaf sounded really good. But they were out of it. Disappointing. I got the eggs Benedict instead. They were accommodating in taking out the English muffin and putting the eggs over hash browns. The hollandaise sauce was very good. We liked it here and recommend it."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever...we came in  and were asked to leave by a lady with glasses...we we're all sitting in different areas on the comfy chairs and waiter was confused and made it seem like it was our fault and got kinda smart with us. The waitress came over to see what was going on... the confusion started and she became very sassy and rude. All over a seating arrangement mix up and her being in business like. Working in this type of business u should never ever talk to people or treat us how she did. I was totally embarrassed and I will continue to let people know how rude her service was. This reminds me of amys baking company on hells kitchen that's how rude she was"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of food network. I've been excited to try this place for a little while now. The service quick and friendly. The atmosphere was nice enough for a small local joint.   The thing about a place like this is that it's all about the food. I wouldn't say it s the greatest thing I've ever had, but it is much better than the chain restaurants. The food has the taste of homemade to it. The waffles and pancakes have a lightness to it that you can't seem to get in chain restaurants or from the supermarket. They have real maple syrup and the taste just can't be duplicated. The chicken that came with the chicken and waffles was not very seasoned, which I liked, but others may not if they are expecting a ton of flavor from it.  Overall, I'd like to give it a 3.5 but will round up to a 4. I'd go again every once in a while but I wouldn't necessarily make it a regular."}
{"text":"Stopped in to have brunch after hitting the gym pretty hard next-door at lifetime fitness. Needed a high-protein low-carb meal. We were greeted immediately, had our coffee within a minute or two, and our order was at the table with 5 minutes. They had zero problems with my special requests for my meal. I ordered a meat omelette and some cottage cheese and was not disappointed. Very friendly staff, nice atmosphere, coffee was good. A little pricey for an omelette but they accommodated my special requests, so I have no problems with paying a little extra for it. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Got there around 10 a.m. on Saturday, only had to wait about 15 minutes.   We decided to switch up our brunch routine and landed on Over Easy because it was featured on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives. They have an extensive menu, so there's a crazy amount of options, especially for breakfast. I ended up getting the caramelized banana & pecan brioche French toast and my girlfriend ordered the Chilaquiles.   The food was good, but came in small portions and was a bit pricey for how much we got. After really looking forward to eating here, it's safe to say we were underwhelmed.  Given how busy the place was and how much praise it gets, we just didn't get what the fuss was about. Maybe they're resting on their laurels after receiving national attention.  I wouldn't avoid it, but there's plenty of other places to grab brunch. I doubt we'll be back."}
{"text":"Very good food.  Quick and friendly service.  Everyone helps out to make sure you are getting taken care of.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"(I posted this for 'wifey' as she is not a current Yelper.) My girlfriend & I went to your restaurant today for breakfast.  The food was very good.  I had some issues with the help. The older petite gal was very nice but if you are going to charge $2.50 for coffee, how about more than 1 refill?  And my friend & I wanted to split our meals and asked for another plate.  The tall slender young guy said OK and then proceeded to go to the counter & count some money.  When my friend finally went up to the counter & asked again for the plate he said just a minute and finally a few minutes later gave her the extra plate.  It would have been nice to have a hot meal.  I'll never go back..."}
{"text":"This spot is good for breakfast. The food was delicious. I had the wolfpack with over medium eggs loved the idea of having eggs and Bacon put in between hasbrowns.  Also shared an order of the caramelized banana nut French toast no need for syrup. My friend had the over easy dish which was also delicious ask for feta cheese to top it off made it a little bit better. The staff was friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Food was cold and bland. We ordered the Chicken Fried Steak and the Corned Beef Benedict. Sent back the Chicken Fried Steak and received another one, but was still cold. Service was decent. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Love this place!  I've been twice but each experience was excellent!  I love sitting at the counter, reading the newspaper and enjoying whatever it is  that I ordered.  I love their french toast!  Super yum!    Their counter has those retro boomerangs on it.  You can sit there and watch the cooks in the kitchen, that is always fun for me.  They have a cute covered patio, but I have never sat on it yet.  We really like counters if the restaurant has one.   I also love that it's super close to my apartment."}
{"text":"We had a very disappointing experience today at Over Easy. First of all, the service was lousy, slow and inattentive. We had to remind the waiter twice to bring drinks and once to bring toast that came with my father's meal. The food was equally unremarkable:  I had the cheddar biscuits and gravy and they were bland, barely seasoned and cold. My husband had the famed \"waffle dogs\" and he said they were \"decent,\" but that's about it. Our friend had the chicken fried steak and found it lacked seasoning, and the breading was sliding off of the meat. She said the hash browns were the best part of the plate, giving them \"three stars.\" Overall, we will never come back to Over Easy again due to the service and bland, average food."}
{"text":"We were on vacation in Scotsdale when we are here... 2 mornings in a row. We couldn't decide what to have so we did a double feature. The food is great. My husband had the Wolfpack and I had the in house made corned beef hash. So good. I'm taking away a star because if you eat somewhere twice and the service is totally different then something isn't 100% with their training. First day was spot on, friendly waitress with quick coffee refills, second time our waitress seemed lost in her own world, the manager gave us a refill & we never saw the waitress again until she dropped our check without making eye contact"}
{"text":"No WiFi!! I think that's done on purpose so people don't hang out there. I'm not sure why this place got DD&D to go there, the food was okay."}
{"text":"Meh.  Got the french toast - perhaps it's just because people raved about it that I was disappointed, but found it soggy, SO overly sweet and thought the bananas tasted rubbery.  Would go for eggs next time."}
{"text":"Totally worth the hype! I ate the breakfast burro where you pick 3 things that you want inside and it was incredible. My fiance got the jalapeno biscuit/gravy thing which was also super rad. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is oozing with curb appeal, and my waitress was friendly. Food came in a reasonable time, and the fair  prices reflect that the food is good quality.  This is an excellent establishment, and I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Food was really fast and tasted amazing. Big portions, we actually shared the WolfPack. We recommend it to all for a great, quick breakfast that fills you up!"}
{"text":"My new review is 5 stars - I have grown to really love this place. They have wonderful food, mostly good service and are in walking distance from my house. The move to the new location made a HUGE difference.   My old review  was 3 stars - I met girlfriends for breakfast here last weekend.  I didn't love it, I didn't hate it.  I didn't really think much of it either way.  I probably would not suggest going here again but would go if someone else invited me.  The food was okay and has some untraditional & interesting twists.  The wait was very long."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to eating at this restaurant as it is close to my home and I have been excited about trying out a new breakfast joint.  Needless to say, I was filled with disappointment from the moment out waitress came over to take our drink order.  The woman was one of the most unfriendly waitresses I have ever met.  She approached our table and rudely asked for our drink orders.  Before I had even finished asking her for what I wanted she walked away and it took her almost 40 minutes to bring over the lemons for my water.  As she walked away, both my friend and I looked at each other with a look of shock on our faces.  Neither of us had ever experienced anything like this before in our lives.    The rude and unfriendly waitress returned to take our food order and although she wasn't as unfriendly as our first encounter, it seemed clear that being at Over Easy was just not the place she wanted to be.  After taking our order several other people ventured into the restaurant and took seats.    We sat for almost 40 minutes and finally noticed that several of the people at the tables that arrived after us had been served their meals.  I eventually got up and walked to the counter to inquire where our food was.  I was informed that it would be out in a couple of minutes and it was.  It was brought out looking like it had been sitting under a warmer for about 20 minutes.  The food was barely warm and all of the edges had started to dry up from the warmer.  Although we were assured that they had just come off the oven, it was clear that they had been sitting for awhile.    I was less than impressed by this restaurant and would recommend McDonald's for breakfast over this joint.  It's really too bad cause the menu looked great but the horrible service coupled with the bad food was a definitely thumbs down from me!"}
{"text":"I truly wanted this place to be good, as I live around the corner.  The first two times I tried it the service and food were not up to par so I decided not to go back.  Fast forward to this week, after a year or two hiatus I decided to try it again which was not a good decision.   I stood at the front counter for way too long before a server suggested that I just sit at the bar.  Two other patrons came in after me and sat at the bar as well.  I waited again for a server to come by to take my order for an unacceptable amount of time.  I placed my order, and after another extended period of time I noticed that my food was sitting in the window.  The server waited until all three patrons food was done before she went and brought them to us.  My meal was cold, and they brought the wrong side items.   There are a lot of good breakfast places in Gilbert unfortunately, this is not one of them.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!!!"}
{"text":"Arrived pretty early so wasn't too busy. Had the pollo loco omelet. It was good. Nothing special about it though. Maybe I ordered wrong thing off the menu because everything was just good not great. No complaints though."}
{"text":"We dined for breakfast at Over Easy today for the first time. The oatmeal at $5.00 was without favor and toppings were $1.00 a piece. The green tea had to made from hot tea, as green tea was not an iced tea selection and priced at $3.25. The staff was without personality and we will stick with First Watch and Good Egg in the future."}
{"text":"Great service ! Our server: Arianna  was super polite and friendly! Our drinks were on the table ASAP. Food came out fast. Cute place to have breakfast. Food was good. Location not bad. I would try it again."}
{"text":"We saw them on 2 food network shows so figured it's worth the drive and we were right.  Everything was delicious.  I want to go back and try a couple other menu items but had to go with the waffle dogs.  Amazing."}
{"text":"Not happy with this place. Was quoted 20 minutes, took 35 to be seated. When we were seated it took 10 minutes for our server to greet our table. When I was finally served my coffee there was a hair in the mug and crusty food on the creamer plate. When I spoke with the manager his apology was 'I'm sorry, I'll make sure your food comes out great'.  Shouldn't that be all your food that comes out great? When my second coffee was brought out it was full of coffee grounds. I hate poor service and restaurants that think they're above good service because they're the newest trendy thing."}
{"text":"Glad to see that all of the reviews for Over Easy aren't stellar, as I've been consistently underwhelmed by this Camelback corridor breakfast joint. At the base level, there just isn't anything exciting about the food. I could make it at home, so why go out of the way to pay for something that I could find at any random greasy spoon? I know that a lot of the Arcadia set love Over Easy, but it simply strikes me as an okay-at-best, retro-trendy hole in the wall. Also, and certainly worth mentioning, the service was bad - unfriendly staff and I felt sort of like I should be grateful that I could grab a table, rather than feeling welcomed. Skip it - Over Easy is over-hyped and under-delivers."}
{"text":"I have not eaten here. However, I will not eat a location that uses Hickman farm products. The sole purpose is because using these products forces female inmates to work in their facilities. Although that may not seem bad look at it this way:   1. They claim to pay a higher wage to their \"employees\" yet they actually only pay the inmate $0.30 an hour as well as pay the additional $14.70 to the department of corrects. Any money that an inmate makes is supposed to go towards any restitution they may have post their release. Makes the IRS look like a puppy, right?  2. They do not allow these women to shower or change before returning to their prison yard. This means they return covered in chicken feces. Once they return, they go through the typical strip search which leaves aforementioned feces on the floor for other inmates to stand on in their bare feet.   These are pieces of the puzzle and the fact is that I have first hand knowledge of these events. If I were you and didn't have that knowledge, I would not believe it either. You are welcome to disagree with me if you would like.   I would love to try this restaurant but with a clean conscious I cannot. If there is anyone from in their management that is reading this, please feel free to do your own research. I agree with desiring to use a local business and applaud that. I just urge you to find another provider."}
{"text":"This is such a cute and simple place to eat! The staff is awesome and food is delicious. Definitely a place to try if you haven't yet."}
{"text":"Found this online on a \" top 10 \" places for breakfast site ..... not sure who's actually going and eating at this place before adding it to the list ???...   The place was cute from the outside... looked promising ....**  inside kinda burst your bubble !!  The staff was very friendly and service was just fine .... **  putting the feel of the inside...aside ... the food left very little to be desired !!  Like another reviewer wrote... breakfast is a favorite meal of the day  and I am always wanting something fresh , yummy and made with really good ingredients... whatever it may be ... Let's just say , the blueberry pancakes will never be one of my favorite breakfast memories !!  Although the blueberries were fresh .... the cakes were very Dry ...and the batter was so bland it tasted like cardboard... if it weren't for the sub par maple syrup ...it would have been inedible.... I ate one cake out of three. ...  My husband got an omelet .. ham, cheese and tomato... hard to go wrong there ...  it was ok... nothing special but definitely better than the cakes ...  We had breakfast the next morning at Butterfields just down the way a few minutes and it ROCKED !! The omelet was amazing  ( the ingredients so fresh and delicious )... and the fresh berry pancakes with mascarpone ...... A game changer !!!   Over easy in my opinion is a good place for locals who enjoy a quick place to get a bite ... and even enjoy a bloody mary if so inclined ... but not for me ....:-("}
{"text":"I have gone here a few times with both my friends and family, and it has never disappointed us. The caramelized banana french toast that was featured on Diners Drive-ins and Dives was just as good as Guy described it! I also love how they have a \"healthy choice\" menu that includes a variety of clean food options! Overall this is a great place with a super relaxed environment, and I would recommend for everyone to check it out!"}
{"text":"Breakfast is widely considered to be the most important meal of the day.  During my one and only visit to Over Easy I had a breakfast that ensured that I didn't need to eat for the rest of the day, and I was happy about that because I don't like to let anything that is important pass me by.    As soon as I saw the chicken and waffles listed on the menu I knew that there was no need to look for anything else.  Something about the menu's advice of enjoying the dish with both hot sauce and syrup resonated with me, and that sealed the deal.  Plus there was free maple syrup (more on that later).  Both the chicken and the waffle were good, but neither was astounding.  I was served a large chicken breast that had tons of flavor.  Did I need hot sauce?  No, but it certainly didn't hurt.  The waffle was also enjoyable, but there was something that just seemed to be missing.  Perhaps the best aspect of the meal was that maple syrup was automatically served - I didn't have to pony up any extra cash to enjoy one of nature's most perfect foods.  The coffee wasn't bad either. That was certainly reflected in the six cups that I managed to take down as I was taking pleasure in my chicken and waffle breakfast, which by the end were completely submerged in a 50/50 mixture of maple syrup and hot sauce.    Maple syrup, hot sauce, and good coffee, it's hard not to enjoy a breakfast that allows you to have all of those at once.  After all of that gluttony and review-rambling, I feel compelled to give Over Easy four stars because the food was pretty good but there was certainly room for improvement (the waffle could have been better and that constituted half of my meal)."}
{"text":"Hungry for Breakfast? Don't want to wait too long for a table? Want large portions that are delicious? Over Easy is the place. This is our favorite breakfast place, they even have gluten free pancakes. Gets crowded on the weekends but service is fast. Can sit outside on the patio when the weather is nice. Get a to go box and finish the rest for lunch!"}
{"text":"I knew they had one in Arcadia so I gave it a try.  It was just as good as expected.  I enjoyed my favorite, the bourbon glazed french toast.  The place was clean and the wait staff was nice.  I would go back and I would suggest it."}
{"text":"Went to this place cause I saw it on the food network.  The bourbon glazed french toast was out of this world, tasted like candy.  It was clean and the staff was nice.  I would go back and I would recommend it."}
{"text":"This is one of the best breakfast places in the Valley. The food is out of this world and the service is great. We showed up at 1:00 PM on the 4th of July. They close at 1:00 but they seated us anyway. I had met the owner over eighteen months ago. He remembered my name.   The hash browns can't be beat. They are grilled to perfection on the outside. The chicken fried steak is smothered with sausage and bacon gravy.   I would review the other food but I keep coming back for the chicken fried steak. Gotta try something else one day."}
{"text":"First of all, I used to go to the Taco Bell 10 years ago before going down the street to my high school math tutor. I am amazed with how they changed the building into a quaint, unique little local breakfast eatery. I went today with a friend of mine as breakfast isn't a usual meal that I go out for, but since I've been wanting to try the restaurant I made an effort to make it there before its early closing time of 11:30am.   Being a graphic designer, everything about the place is simple and what I thought, delicious. I ordered an iced coffee, although I wish they would have had a Chai Tea on the menu, and the Loretta which is one of their breakfast sandwiches. Not to mention the sweet potato tatter tots as a side. Both were very delicious especially with adding the famous Chulula sauce on the sandwich and a bit of ketchup to the tots. I wish the bread on my sandwich was a bit more crispy so it wouldn't get soggy as quickly as it did, but the taste was great. If you are looking for a local Phoenix breakfast, for sure check out Over Easy. I would definitely go back, however the seating is mostly outdoors. Perhaps not a great spot during the hot Phoenix summer months, but I can definitely see myself there once it starts getting cooler out!  I am sure this place gets pretty packed during the weekend. I would say going during the week during the later part of the morning will allow you to miss the high traffic. Speaking of traffic, the traffic noise is a bit much if you're outside. I, however, was able to tune it out for the most part. I think they should have put the patio more in the back, but such is life!"}
{"text":"Really great and unique menu and great cocktails. Not the same old boring breakfast. Coffee was above average. Go here, you won't regret it"}
{"text":"Just went for the first time and had a FABULOUS experience thanks to my server Morgan!!! Food was great, service was better- will definitely be back again and request Morgan's section ! Very attentive and knew the menu very well! Food came quickly and I got the Selena breakfast burrito  and it was very good. I would highly recommend it!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice... the first I wasn't impressed at all, nor was my wife or brother.  We all had different dishes.  I, the Chicken fried Steak, Wife the Chocolate chip Pancakes, and my brother the chicken fried chicken... we all shared the B&G.  Before i lead into the food experience let me tell you about the wait.  Granted, it was Tuesday, the day after they aired on Diners , Dive In's and Dives (or so we were told).  We waited for 1o minutes before the Owner (slash) Host (slash) food runner (slash) Manager (slash) phone receptionist decides to take our name.. 5 of which he spent catching up with an old acquaintance. (yes, i could've used a \"/\" in lieu of \"slash\" but it makes for a better read)  We're finally seated after 15 minutes.. (let me remind you we live n Phoenix.. it's 108 bloody degrees outside so 15mins is a long time).   I notice all 6 tables parallel to me are \"plateless\"..everyone looks hungry and anxious falsely romanticizing the wait with aspirations o well crafted dishesf .  The couple next to me exclaim how they've been waiting near FIFTY MINUTES for their food.  I also notice there are only 2 servers to an overcrowded,hot..yet well shaded patio.  I talk my wife out of leaving 3 times within a 30 minute period.. we even rock-paper-scissored for it... i lost.. but refused to leave.. why.. cuz i am a STUBBORN man.  I gotta tell you.. I HATE bad business...It bugs the bajeezuz out of me. You (Mr owner) OBVIOUSLY KNOW when the show is airing.. how about preparing ahead of time.. hire a freaking Host for \"whatever\" an hour and splurge on a food runner... another server would be nice but heaven forbid..that 3.50 an hour plus tips might break you....maybe the economy isn't so bad and everyone in the Phoenix area IS employed and you can't find help. One more cook equals 3 would be good.  4 lonely hands not so bueno. The way I look at it... in the time it took to order, get served, and then the 3 minutes to eat they could have turned the tables twice with proper staff.. feeding trice as many people, MAYBE making people happy (but ya need better food for that) hence making you some more money... but hey.. that's just me. Stick to cheap ways, doesn't matter here in Phoenix... everyone gets away with mediocrity... no competition.  I don't care if the owner is nice and has swanky white glasses.. get real dude... I'd rather you run the place than serve me my food.    Service wide.. i thought the guy clearing off tables and setting up was \"OFF THE CHAIN\"... Mr. Johnny on the spot!!  I'm not joking people.. this guy was the only guy with a sense of urgency.  Give him a raise.. if it wasn;t for him people would be waiting an extra 10 minutes on top thier already wrongfully delayed seating time.  The CF steak was  not bad but the gravy was less than average (clumpy and BLAND) therefore lessening the overall taste.   The pancakes tasted as if were made from a generic box mix with some extra ingredients chocolate chips added.  Nothing special..ANYONE can make the same at home.  The B&G.. well the biscuits were hard and oily.  The gravy.. again.. BLAND and clumpy.  I had the tater tots.. honestly.. i think they are Orida frozen tater tots.  Everything is served on small plated so it \"looks\" like a larger portion.  I'm not one for large portions anyways so no complaint there.    Overall.. the food looks appetizing from a distance.  Up close and personal - not so much.  Another tip... how about staying open past 11:30... 1:30 sound better.  I could have discovered how much i don't like this place many months ago.. but i always managed to arrive just as they've stopped seating."}
{"text":"Lets start by saying that overall the food here is good, although that is the only reason I am giving more then one star. I ordered a to go order over the phone and the service was friendly, when I arrived to pick up the order my bill was around 20 bucks. I handed the waitress that brought me the bill  2 20 dollar bills so I could leave a tip. She ended up pocketing the other 20 dollar bill and never came back with any type of change or a thank you or anything. I asked the hostess to talk to the manager and he came out and asked the girl and she pulled it out of her apron like it \"accidently\" slipped in her apron...the manager was not at all apologetic. I recently ordered another to go order and I was never told over the phone how much it would be. I called back and asked how much the bill was, the waitress on the phone proceeded to say how much it was and I asked her to repeat it and she said the price again SUPER slow and acted like I was retarded or dumb this time when I went to pick up the order I asked the waitress to talk to the manager and she said that he was here and was in the back. I proceeded to pay for my meal and she WALKED AWAY like HELLO ARE YOU KIDDING ME. I stood there a minute and another waitress came over and finished checking me out and I asked her to talk to the manager and she told me that the waitress that originally was checking me out was the manager.....on top of all this I never received a thank you... I think the employees here need to have a staff meeting about who the manager is and how to properly engage with customers....HONESTLY, the worst customer service I have EVER had in a restaurant."}
{"text":"Took my wife to Over Easy for breakfast and what an experience. It was our first time and while trying to decide on what to order my wife saw the lady's plate setting next to us and asked her what she had ordered because it looked so delicious.  Low and behold after speaking to lady for several minutes we realized it was one if the owners (Andrea or Andy). She was so engaging and a very nice woman. My wife ordered the Pumpkin French Toast with a Mediterranean omlet. I had the Denver omlet and a belgian waffle. We also had an order of the Blueberry muffins. OMG!!!!! Everything was so fresh, the muffins were so gooey and has so many blueberries - Yummy!!!!! The omlets were awesome mine had so many fresh vegetables it was Yummy!!!!! The Pumpkin French Toast was freshly made and Yummy!!!! The waffle was good but the maple syrup made them Yummy!!!!! EVERYTHING was amazing... from the fact that the owner was there and took the time to talk with us made us feel welcomed and like part of the family.  Highly recommend it!!!!! We got there early and the place filled up pretty quick but that should be expected due to the entire experience.  Will definitely go back!!!!! This place rocks- food, service, hospitality 100% it was Yummy!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Don't bother with the new location - they've become too impressed with themselves!  Was a frequent customer at the old location on 40th Street (old Taco Bell), so thought I'd try their new space at 48th St & Indian School in a grocery anchored center - BORING.  No personality and what's worse is it seemed that along with the change in location there's been a change in attitude.    We walked in and stood inside the door, tables were open - there were a couple of people ahead of us, just standing there and talking.    After about 3 or 4 minutes (generally, not a long time) except when you are being ignored.  Finally, one of the other waiting customers (I thought)  asked us, \"Just you two?\".  They were EMPLOYEES!!  Should have left then, but my prior positive experience with Over Easy gave me reason enough to stay for the food.  Not a smart decision.  We sat down and were, again, ignored!  We did get water, but none of the servers came by to greet us, take an order, ask a question, anything until we stopped someone and asked them to find our server.  Finally put in an order, which of course, came out wrong.  Either the server didn't write the order correctly or the cooks can't read.  In any event, no one bothered to check if what they delivered was as ordered.  They've lost the panache and the desire to impress their customers with good service and good food.  Won't be returning.  Too bad, good breakfast places are hard to find."}
{"text":"Wow!  Just had the eggs  and wild mushrooms.   Absolutely delicious!   Have never been disappointed with the food here!"}
{"text":"Great place yo wrk but victor is a total douche bag whos extremely verbally abusive to all the employees.... He needs to be gone he doesnt deserve a position like that where hr treats all his employees like crap.. Its extremely sad.."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place since it opened, and I just finally got the chance last week.  And I was pretty unimpressed.  Maybe it was just that I had been building this place up for so long and had too high of expectations, or maybe it was the fact that we showed up for breakfast at 11 a.m. (30 minutes before they close) ... not sure, but I will not be returning any time soon.  It is not that I had a bad experience per se, but just that there are so many other great restaurants in the Valley that I will not be spending my eating-out money here!   I tend to get really excited about homemade lemonades, and when I saw the mint lemonade, it kind of reminded me of Matt's honey lemonade which is so frickin delicious, I decided to give this stuff a whirl.  Bleh ... waaaay too sweet! Tasted like they dumped way too much simple syrup in or something and the mint was very overwhelming.  Stuck with my water from then on. To eat, I ordered the cheddar jalepeno biscuits with sausage gravy.  My food arrived cold and the biscuits were hard, but the gravy was pretty tasty, and I liked the fact that each biscuit had a piece of sausage on it, so I had some sausage in every bite. Given that they were closing soon, I didn't bother asking them to heat up my food.  My friend ordered the Wolfpack, which was eggs, cheese, and bacon sandwiched between hash browns.  His meal actually looked way better than mine, and it was steaming, so I'm assuming it was served at a better temperature than my meal. He ate most of his food with no complaints, so I think he enjoyed it, but he didn't have too many positive things to say either.  Service was OK - actually pretty slow considering we were one of about three tables there.  Ambiance was like a diner but not as cute as Matt's and didn't really fit for the upscale breakfast prices.  The patio was really nice, but they only had two small fans to cool it off, so that was not an option in the 106 degree weather.   All in all, my friend and I both agreed as we walked off that while we thought our food was OK, we were in no hurry to return."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times now and the first experience was good  so thought we'd give it a go again since I wanted to try the waffle dogs. Came in 11 on a weekday and not too busy. We were seated promptly, given some ice water, and then began the 15 minutes of trying to flag down a waiter. We were told our waiter would be with us soon. Finally, the other waiter just took our order and we were a little confused why the our waiter was MIA.   Now we waited another 30 minutes for our food to arrive... I was ready to bail but felt too committed at this point. The table next us hadn't even received their food and they were there before us. We could see that people who had arrived after us had gotten there's and it was beyond frustrating. Luckily the food came out hot and was good. The waffle dogs were not really crispy but overall an indulgent treat. The Tammy egg white sandwich was great along with the sweet pot tots. The waiter was very apologetic and told us some excuses why service was so slow and bad, and that it wasn't normally this way. He was a nice guy in a bad situation so we understood. Management needs to step in a make sure that huge take out orders don't slow down service and the kitchen. We left full but disappointed . Also, the table next to us just got their food as we were leaving And had to send it back cause it was cold (they had the MIA clueless waiter)."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place out after reading several good reviews. First of all, if you are going to eat here we recommend you sit at the counter looking into the kitchen like we did so you can see the cooks mopping up grease off your eggs with the same towel they dropped on the floor and have been using to pull pans out of the oven and move saute pans with. Health code aside, the food was the most disappointing we have ever had. I ordered the Wolf pack over easy at, get this, Over Easy. The eggs were completely hard buried in crappy frozen hash browns. Before I even got this steaming pile we watched it sit under the warmer for 10 minutes while they killed my wife's egg white omelette. Over an inch thick and completely over cooked, it broke in half when they \"folded\" it. It had burnt edges all around from the broiler. Once the food was finally delivered and we looked at the mess in front of us, we dropped several dollars down for our coffee, pushed our plates away, and drove to Matt's Big Breakfast."}
{"text":"My review for over easy is seriously delinquent...but hey...better late than never right? I will start by saying that every time I come in to Over Easy I feel like part of the family. The staff, as well as the owners are always in a good mood, but at the same time no one is ever \"fake-nice\". Sometimes I come across a wait at the restaurant, however it never feels like the wait is long.  I've had several different menu items, but my favorite is always the pancakes. I know, I know, simple but delicious!! I've never had a bad food experience here and thus every time I show up I know it's going to be good. Also, please note the coffee. I am a coffee-aholic, so good coffee in a joint is important to me and they definately have it. Always good, and always fresh.   The restaurant itself is small, with only a few tables inside, a patio and the counter by the register. What I love about Over Easy is that its laid back. Over easy is not trying to be trendy or pretentious in any way. It's breakfast people, let's not make this too complicated before noon."}
{"text":"Was really looking forward to trying a new breakfast place.  Very disappointed.  I ordered the 2 eggs breakfast with sourdough toast and bacon well done.  Everything came to the table cold.  The bacon was undercooked and limp.  The toast did not taste like sourdough and looked like it had been put in a sandwich press instead of a toaster, plus it was cold and unbuttered and the butter served was cold so it just sat there on the toast and the jam was runny.  The hash browns were tasteless.   The service was just ok but the ambience was way too noisy.  Will not go here again."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  After arriving in Phoenix hungry,  disoriented, and surrounded by national food chains, we stumbled upon them in Google maps and headed over.  The food was delicious - french toast, pancakes and eggs, om nom nom.  The service was even better.  Andy is hilarious and super helpful.  He gave us lots of recommendations for local restaurants, bars, and neighborhoods.  I'll be back next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Super cool little open air patio. It was a wee bit chilly this morning, but with the strategically placed heat lamps, the temperature was just right. Quite cozy, actually. Service was friendly and mostly efficient, right up until it came time for the bill, at which point our waitress disappeared into some kind of crack in the spacetime continuum. Actually had to hail the host over to get it for us.  Mixed reviews for the food - the french toast with carmelized bananas and pecans was incredibly delicious, the toast so big and fluffy and tender, the bananas soft and fresh... but the \"three eggs with herbs and mushrooms\" was, well, I don't know - just not good, and probably should have been called \"an ungodly amount of slimy rubbery mushrooms dumped on top of some decent eggs with an herb, maybe two.\" What sounded cool when were ordering was the tater tot potato option, which sounds good in theory, but when it came down to it, was kind of weird. That could be just me, but these tots weren't even that good.  Would I come back? That's the real question, right? Yeah, probably. Not the first place on my list though. And I'd probably stick to the sweet stuff."}
{"text":"Good: Waffle, Chilaquiles (mixture of tortillas, ranchero sauce, chicken, sour cream & cedar cheese topped w/ egg), house made granola, and Waffle Dogs. Also they made a mixture of maple syrup w/ Chalula to dip the waffle dog in which was surprisingly tasty. The chicken fried chicken with waffle hot sauce/syrup is worth a tasting, but Lola's is probably better. Definitely will go back.     Stray away from:  3 eggs w/ sirloin and caramelized onions   Only reason I am giving them 4 stars is that the meals are kind of heavy."}
{"text":"The food is great, the service was quick and Sam the manager was a sweetheart! We will go back...oh, and if there's a wait you can order a bloody mary or mimosa and sit outside to wait."}
{"text":"We were visiting from California and went to the Over Easy in Mesa, Az  it was the best breakfast ever!!!! The Waffle Dog was to die for!!! They were super friendly also! I just wish we had one in California!"}
{"text":"So great! I had a breakfast sandwich with bacon, and sweet potato tater tots (THE TOTS ARE PERFECTION). Friend got hash browns and said they were delicious. This place is fast, and easily customizable. Would go for a quick bite, or to catch up with a friend!"}
{"text":"I had the steak and eggs with just egg whites. It was great, tons of flavor and not super heavy which was perfect. I've been here a few times and the great thing about the menu is it has something for everyone. You can get something a little lighter or something super filling like the burrito.   Don't miss  the fresh squeezed OJ.   I'll be back for sure"}
{"text":"So, I notice EVERYTHING about a restaurant when I dine there.   My daughter and I arrived first thing in the morning when they opened. We were immediately seated by very nice hostesses. We were greeted by a friendly waitress shortly after. The menu is faded, and a little difficult to read. It looks like it needs to be reprinted. It was very clear to me that there had not been a cleaning crew there the prior night, which is expected of all restaurants.   All of the glass windows and the door were dirty. There was food smeared on the floor under my feet under the booth. The booth itself with sticky. We placed our order and while sitting there chatting and waiting and looking around, I noticed more how there was food on the chairs and thought to myself that this is a very dirty restaurant. One of my biggest pet peeves when going out to eat (and this is restaurant ownership 101 ), is to see employees eating while they work (that means they're not washing their hands after eating and before handling my food.  Coming out of the kitchen chewing food is very unprofessional and distasteful, and I would think that the owner of the restaurant would be upset to find that there were about two or three employees who were eating while working. A couple of employees had very unkempt looking hair. In my opinion if you're a guy with long hair, you should have it pulled back, especially if you're waiting tables. I would never take a picture of an employee at work as I would expect the same respect, but I wish I had taken pictures of the very dirty restaurant and bathroom. When I went in to use the bathroom I was disgusted. I just won't say what I saw. The bathroom is falling apart and filthy and I don't think any employees took the time to care about cleaning it. I did tell the manager that there was a filthy bathroom when I left. But I didn't tell her or complain about any other issues because sometimes those things fall on deaf ears. Perhaps the owner of Over Easy might read this review and take it to heart. If I was a restaurant owner, I would make sure to leave my restaurant in the hands of somebody that I would hope to trust to take care of it as if it was their own. But such is not the case. So when the food arrived it was good and hot. The pecan banana French toast were very good.  I came in to have the ricotta lemon pancakes. They were paper thin and not what you would expect (they were crepes). I was expecting nice big fluffy ricotta pancakes. This was very disappointing. The bacon was delicious and I wanted more than two strips. Just really disappointed that we're the first customers in the morning and this restaurant looked so filthy, and the employees were eating as they worked. I would recommend power cleaning this restaurant professionally, require employees to pull their hair back, tuck their shirts in and look like they take pride in their job - scrub the heck out of that restaurant in the evening before leaving. I probably will hold off eating there again and think that the health inspector should probably pay this restaurant a visit."}
{"text":"Sadly, I think it is time to take Overeasy off my list of breakfast spots. This morning I had a craving for Chiliquilies. Their version of it has been hit or miss before, but when it was good, it was very good. I went in this morning, around 8:15am. First sign of things not so good, the place was practically empty.. I ordered the chiliquilies with the eggs sunnyside up.. Dish arrived a few minutes later. It was lukewarm. The sauce was very minimal. The plate was almost like some cheese nachos with a few pieces of chicken and two eggs on top.. What little sauce that was on it had no OOMPH.. It used to be that this dish was very flavorful and could almost cause you to get a little sweat on the forehead..Not any more..  I will give the cook credit for knowing how to cook sunnyside up eggs. They were cooked perfectly. My server never came by to check on things. To make matters worse, the manager lady (I think she may be the daughter of owner Brad May) was sitting at the counter on her cell phone and eating breakfast my entire visit. Not once did she get up to check on any customer in the place.   So, we have hit and miss (mostly miss in my last few visits) food. We have uncaring and unattentive service (starting with the manager).. the only remaining \"good\" in my book is location-it is fairly close to home. But so is Snooze, and Daily Dose, and Essence Bakery.. The competition wins out on this contest.   I think it is time to stick a fork in Overeasy.. It's done."}
{"text":"It took a little bit longer than I expected, but worth the wait. The sausage tasted like real beef/steak/sausage. Not like fasted food restaurant places at all. Loved the variety of drinks they had to choose from, interesting. They need to change their coffee for sure though. Great service and nice vibe."}
{"text":"I've eaten breakfast here about 5 times now. Service is always great, everyone is very friendly. When there's a wait on a busy Sunday, it's always really short. Sweet potato Tator tots are very good!!!! I also like the steak and eggs. Also this place is kid friendly."}
{"text":"People there were all unfriendly Food was undercooked and served cold Waitress was rude Pancakes tasted like bleach Water tasted like sewer water We never got any drink refills Table was dirty when we sat down and we asked if it could be wiped off. It never was Do not waste your money on this place"}
{"text":"Just ate there and the experience was lacking Eggs over medium still has runny whites. Pancakes tasted like bleach Water tasted like the sewer Table was dirty ...we asked waitress to clean it but she never did Waitress was unfriendly and not helpful Never got any drink refills Sorry, but I would not recommend this place"}
{"text":"Sweet potato tots, salmon eggs Benedict & kids pancakes were really good. Service was quick and kept the coffee cups full."}
{"text":"Over priced food. Not that great. Went on a Monday morning and it took over a hour for our food to come. Waitress was kind though."}
{"text":"we came because they received a review in the Airtran Airline magazine. So after we arrived in AZ... We went to check it out and was a little disappointed with the food and the slow service, but to be fair...we did like the atmosphere of the place. (outdoor seating) which is the only reason we gave it a 2star instead of a single star.  We ordered:  \"Wolf Pack\" 2eggs, bacon & cheese between layers of hash browns...$9  (small amount of food didn't even include toast for nine bucks)   \"The Over Easy\" Toasted brioche with spinach, fried egg, natural jus with bacon & scallions...$9 (really bad...soggy bread...lots of spinach, hardly any bacon =(  The entrees where small and if you wanted to add a side to make it a reasonably sized breakfast it will cost you more...which made it expensive...like adding toast = extra $1.5....Yikes! It's breakfast food...seriously over priced."}
{"text":"After reading the Yelp reviews and growing a bit tired of our usual breakfast place selections, Over Easy seemed like a sure thing.  We arrived and found both the place and a parking spot with no problem.  Plus, we were early enough that we got seated right away.  That's about all of the good stuff that happened.  We were seated in the back, behind a large wall section (possible expansion of the kitchen area?  I'm not too sure) with dim lighting and one table next to us.  The servers kept forgetting that we were there, and getting refills on water was a bit of a pain.  Can't say much else for the service or ambiance, as they weren't really there much, and we were HIDDEN BEHIND A GIANT WALL (respectively).  The food can best be described as \"edible.\"  I tried the Wolfpack, which came with the most artificial-tasting bacon that I've ever eaten, and so much grease on the hash browns that it should have had its own mention on the menu.  My breakfast buddies got the pancakes (not fully cooked) and the banana pecan French toast (soggy and minuscule).  We all left feeling hungry, and proceeded to a nearby fast food place for added sustenance.  Also, the coffee was lousy.  Sometimes, it's a better idea to stay in and make your own breakfast.  When it came to the experience at Over Easy, that's definitely what we should have done."}
{"text":"Quick, affordable, and super tasty. Have tried a few things on the menu and they've all been good. Staff is friendly, too. I'd highly recommend the eggs benedict and \"The Wolf pack\".   Great place to start the day."}
{"text":"Wow, incredible banana and pecan French toast, so light and fluffy. Only order the half order though, it's too sweet to eat the whole thing!"}
{"text":"We bought the LivingSocial deal to try this place out a few months ago but haven't had a chance to try it until this morning. We came right around 7:45am and were the 3rd table in the restaurant - a blessing because we wanted to make it to work on time after our fancy breakfast (anything compared to a homemade shake is fancy).  We seated ourselves and were assisted within a few minutes.  I would say both our orders came out within 15 mins - not too bad for what appeared to be very fresh, hot food.    I read the previous reviews and figured I would try something that was a \"typical\" breakfast choice for me: the Mediterranean omelet. I considered creating my own (I'm one of those slightly picky people about what I have in my omelets) but felt the short but mighty ingredients in this omelet would hit the spot - spinach, garlic, tomatoes, and feta. What's not to love? I skipped the variety of potato options in favor of an English muffin. Although I love me some potatoes, I'm really glad I did!    I love love love cold pressed coffee and was very interested in how they prepared their Over Easy Iced [coffee]; with cinnamon and cardamom, followed by sweetened condensed milk (the best thing ever to add to coffee) and a hint of mint. I could envision how the first three flavors would work together but didn't know how the mint would come in (and I'm not normally a mint person).    My husband, a complete sucker for almost any configuration of eggs Benedict, settled on the Deli Eggs Benedict (I called it - the salami was calling his name).  He chose a half/half order of regular and sweet potato tots and eventually caved, at my insistence, for the iced coffee too.    I loved the homemade strawberry jam that came with my English muffin - not too sweet and a strong strawberry taste. Our server told us the jam they were using before were not up to par for them so they switched to making their own - works for me!  I polished off half my English muffin before I turned to my omelet.  Personally, I thought my omelet was fantastic and exactly what I was looking for. I was worried that it would be one of those three egg behemoths that is more appropriate for lazy Sunday mornings but thankfully it was normal-sized (they have three egg omelets though, if you are interested in a behemoth meal). I loved the combination of flavors, it wasn't runny inside (not something I mind but I know there are people out there that need their eggs cooked through), and I felt there was a good balance of all the ingredients, not too much or too little of anything.  I complemented my omelet with a few (okay, a puddle to the side) of Chohula hot sauce - you can never have enough of that stuff!    I ended up really liking the iced coffee - since it was cold pressed there isn't the normal bitter after taste that you can some times get with coffee. Instead the after taste was a marriage of cream and mint with just a hint of coffee. I thought the mint could potentially muck it up but I found myself really liking the after taste. I was worried about having major garlic and feta breath but the coffee (emotionally, I can't speak for real life) put my fears to rest because I was able to wash the tastes away and leave only the cream and mint.  It was less sweet than I expected, but then I didn't feel like I needed to either - and I normally put an obscene amount of sweetened condensed milk into my coffee or black tea. Overall, I was very satisfied with my meal.   I'm not always a fan of eggs Benedict - the hollandaise sauce is usually too much for me in the morning. However my husband was quite happy with his meal - the eggs were perfectly poached and the man loves himself some extra sauce and it was plenty saucy for him.  He can't turn down anything with salami in it so it was just icing on the Benedict for him (har har). The amount of taters he received was epic - it took up at least half his plate!  I only sampled the sweet potato taters (How can you walk away from fried sweet potatoes?) and they were quite yummy. He assures me, however, that the regular tots were just as good if not better (he assures me he is okay but I'm not sure what's wrong with him - sweet potatoes are awesome).    We had no issues with service through out our meal - we were checked on once or twice, which fine with us.  Check out was quick and we were done and out of there by 8:45 am, a miracle for us (I am a SLOW eater).   By the time we were finishing up quite a few tables had filled up, so if you want more of a quiet breakfast, we definitely recommend this to early risers.  Our experience was good and we'll be visiting again to try other things as their menu is large and promising (loco moko, French toast, and the breakfast sandwiches come to mind)."}
{"text":"What a delightful place for breakfast!  The place is very chill and the food is great! Our server, Daniella was charming and very helpful with out questions about items on the menu. I had the waffle dogs which were absolutely delicious.  Had with a side of eggs and a screwdriver.  I highly recommend Over Easy for a nice breakfast."}
{"text":"The food was good, the service was okay but the other things we saw made the experience terrible. Saw a server sneeze with out even trying to cover their mouth, dirty sticky floors, dirty coffee cup was served to me, another server dropped utensils on the floor and placed back on the table for guests to use. And saw a grade B from inspections posted! Makes complete since why. Don't ever plan on going back again, very disappointed. And everything was over priced for what we got"}
{"text":"I was suffering from a hangover and went with my girlfriend.  It was a cute dinner. I just got a single egg and toast.  The toast came with some yummy strawberry jam.  The toast was normal.  My gf got a huge mushroom sausage omelette and hash browns. I had a couple bites of both.  The hash browns were yummy and so was the gigantic egg omelette."}
{"text":"I have been to the Phoenix location and was very impressed. I tried the Over Easy in Scottsdale today because it is much closer to my house and the extended hours.   We were greeted by two employees as we walked in, asked if we were here for breakfast or lunch. We said breakfast and they instructed us to take a seat where ever we would like (there was no one else in the dining room, one two-top on the patio). We proceeded to the patio and the waiter met us out there a few minutes later with menus.   As we were giving the waiter our order, he interrupted us to get silverware for the other table who had received their food a minute or two prior. After providing our order to the waiter, and him not writing it down, I knew for sure we would receive an inaccurate order. I was correct, we ordered a single pancake in addition to our two breakfast entrees, and he forgot to put in the pancake order.   Several minutes later (not too long of a wait - we were still the only other table in the place), a food runner brought out our order. He only had our entrees, we told him we also ordered the pancake...he apologized and went inside (assuming to put in the order). At that point, I realized we had not been provided (or asked) for salt/pepper. I walked inside to our waiter and a waitress sitting at the bar and asked for salt/pepper. Several minutes later, our original waiter brought us our pancake. He brought us maple syrup a minute or two later.   The other table on the patio finished prior to us, and asked for their check. They provided this table our check instead. I can see how two separate waitstaff can confuse the two tables that had guests. (Sarcasm, Phoenix).   Overall, food is great. Same as Phoenix, but I will be hard pressed to visit this location again...just due to the horrible service that we were provided.  I have to say, this location needs to get their act together. Good luck!"}
{"text":"Was great until I found hairs in my eggs, awesome! Coffee as cold as the waitress. Overall terrible experience. Never coming back, I'll stick to making my own omelets."}
{"text":"Great hip breakfast in Gilbert. Food and waitress Kayla were excellent. Reviews didn't do it justice. We will be back."}
{"text":"Serving only breakfast and lunch, this place is super popular and there's almost always a wait. Tip: try the strawberry lemonade with fresh rosemary."}
{"text":"Went to this place this last weekend it was pretty damn good.  I will be going back as soon as possible. It was a 45 min drive and well worth it."}
{"text":"First of all the restaurant itself is cold, not comfortable. Menu is interesting - but fairly limited for a breakfast joint, and when you get down to it the food is fairly bland. Also Pricey - 2 Eggs, bacon, hashbrowns $8.  No idea how this made it on Diners Drive-ins & Dives - it is none of these. To new, to pretty, and to boring."}
{"text":"Best Eggs Benedict in the valley.  Recently changed menu and added several new items.  Service is great and friendly."}
{"text":"Welcomed as soon as I came in and sat at the counter. Served right away and order came out quickly.  Had the Wolfpack but I made the mistake of getting the eggs medium. Of course the only time I have ever had eggs cooked exactly right is when I should not have. Made it a little dry. Over easy or sunny up would have made it perfect. It is a lot of food and a lot of hash browns.  Great service the entire time and reasonable price for the location.  Atmosphere is diner but didn't seem loud at all. Patio during cooler weather might be nice."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast sitting at the counter. This was my first visit to Over Easy and I LOVED the corned-beef hash and eggs. My daughter had the chiliquiles with scrambled eggs and ate every bite."}
{"text":"Service was good. Speed the food came out was a little slower for only having 4-6 tables of people. We each had something different. Country fried steak was tough but other than that everything was great."}
{"text":"Best breakfast ever! The servers are great and their mimosas and bloody Mary's look so good! The wolf pack was what I had and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"3 of us were able to slide right in to sit at the counter on a busy Sunday morning which was a blessing not only because we didn't have to wait, but because they overcrowd the place with too many tables in the way that only breakfast places seem to. Our service was passable for a busy day, but could have been better considering every single server had to go past our empty coffee mugs every time they went to the kitchen, yet the empty cups sat until \"our server\" came by again. Like I said, it was busy, but coffee with breakfast is pretty much the main priority that any server could take care of (and does in most breakfast places). Everything else about the service was good though, and I liked our server.   I strongly recommend the jalapeno biscuits. They exceeded my expectations and I will definitely have them every time I go. The rest of the food was good too, but the biscuits are what stuck in my mind. I will definitely be back here because it is close to home, but I'll keep looking for a favorite breakfast place too because this one just didn't have the homey vibe that I like."}
{"text":"My best friend raves about this place and had finally talked me into going. I was so displeased with everything, the atmosphere, the service and most importantly, the food. I'm warning you, the restaurant used to be a Del Taco, so it is super small. The tables are crammed together in the middle of the space and there's one long booth that you share with the people on both sides of you, offering zero privacy. From the moment the server greeted us, to the time we left, she not once cracked a smile, she wasn't rude, just was clearly unhappy about being at work that day! I ordered banana and blueberry pancakes, scrambled eggs and toast. I assumed the fruit would cooked inside the pancake because I wasn't told otherwise and it was not. The cook literally threw the fruit on top of the pancake and called it good! The toast was so hard and stale, that holding it made it crumble. I took one bite of it and that was all I could stomach. The eggs were over done, scrambled eggs should be light and fluffy and instead were dry and tasteless. To sum it all up, I will not go back there and would never have this place as a recommendation of mine."}
{"text":"The food here is awesome don't get me wrong...  But today my girlfriend and I came in and sat down, a man asked us if we wanted drinks, he brought me my Arnold Palmer, then we sat waiting to have our order taken for over 20 minutes. a group of people came in 5 minutes after us as ordered and got their food before we even placed an order. We ended up catching another servers attention, she then took out order and was very apologetic and got our order to us as fast as possible.  We love it here. But talk about bad service."}
{"text":"Really liked this place! The only downside was the wait which they really cannot help because it is a bit small but you have to take that into consideration that stopping in is a risk if you do not want to wait. The staff is very friendly and I too loved the waffle and chicken with the hot sauce and maple syrup. Sounded bad but tasted awesome. They were really quick to warm up our coffee and the service remained top notch. many different items on the menu so I will be back to try more."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday for the first time and loved it!  Food was yummy, staff was up beat and fun, service was fast and the place just has a lot of energy.  Just a breakfast place, so so much to choose from on the menu.  In a strip mall kind of hidden in plain sight.  I've heard that they are very busy on the weekends and I can see that.  We were there on a Thursday mid-morning and there was a steady stream of people.  We will be going again!"}
{"text":"My mom and I went there for breakfast and loved it! I had the pecan & banana brioche french toast and it was DELICIOUS! Our server Gino was super friendly and professional and went out of his way to make sure we had a great experience. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The Brioche French Toast looked better but can't complain about the pancakes!  I liked the vibe and design of the place.  Great low key breakfast spot."}
{"text":"This place was great, decent variety. I got the blue berry pancakes. Appeared to be typical pancakes, but I dug into thick, yet fluffy cakes filled with delicious blueberries! Yum! The owner even came around to check on us. Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"This place is unreal!! It is so good and its in the rink which makes it even better. I always get the wolf pack. Its a layer of hash browns then a layer of eggs and bacon then another layer of hash browns. It is so good!"}
{"text":"Great service everytime! The food is decent and comes out very fast, but I'd say the wait staff is what makes coming to this place so easy."}
{"text":"Service was Ok but didn't notice I had a child in my party and didn't bring kids menu for awhile. Didn't try and explain menu in any way and we're from out of town. Also didn't try to accommodate my child's want of a grilled cheese, must be too hard to make. Haven't even gotten food yet and regret coming here and ordering such pricey breakfast food.I WILL NEVER COME BACK HERE AGAIN. Not kid friendly and saw another party with a wheelchair in it and nobody assisted them either."}
{"text":"French pressed coffee was amazing. HasH Browns were very over cooked, scrambled eggs had no taste, jalapeño cheddar biscuit was like a salt lick. The pumpkin bread French toast was more like big block of pumpkin seeds. Our waiter couldn't remember our order and forgot to put the French toast on the bill. How could the Arcadia location be so much better??? It should be the same food right? At least the waiter only charges us for the 2egg breakfast, which i'm sure he didn't realize."}
{"text":"I wouldn't know about this place if it weren't for Diners, Drive-In's and Dives episode.  I really wanted to try the Caramel Banana French Toast that was featured in the show!!!     The very next day at 8:40am hubby and I drove 30 minutes to get to this place thinking it must be good to be featured in the Food Network show, as if!!  Super busy when we got there, we waited and waited some more...finally got a table, I was so happy, like I won the Jackpot of 1 million dollars or something.    We ordered our food and of coarse I had to try the caramel banana french toast that was highly recommended in DDD show,  again we waited...Waited...WAITED...and 30 minutes later....here's our food!!! YAY, again I was happy, but wait a freakin' second here, our portions were small, I'm like WHAT!!!  I'm telling myself to let it go, I waited this long for this food might as well enjoy it.  I have to say my Banana French Toast was going on, I wish I had more though.  I probably wouldn't come back to this place, just because of the wait and the small portions.  I'm glad I tried it...that's all..."}

{"text":"Decided to go here one Friday morning after hearing the hype. The restaurant was mildly busy, about 5 other families. The hostess was pleasant as was our waitress. The restaurant décor was cute with its vintage feel. I also enjoyed the fun 50's music playing!   I rated this so poorly due to a few things... First off, we wanted orange juice but quickly noticed it was... $6.00 a glass!!! Now, if this were Phoenix or Scottsdale, I could understand the price! I could also understand the price if it were AMAZING and made from exotic oranges. Sadly, it was neither. My husband ordered the ham combo and it tasted great. I ordered the waffles with strawberries and cream. Sounded delicious, tasted mediocre and was $8.00!!!!!!! The waffle was the size of a small 6inch plate and had maybe 4 strawberry slices and 2 small scoops of whipped topping. The quality was far from $8.00 worthy! I've had better waffles at IHOP! In also want to mention, the waitress really pushed the large Wolfpack combo. Now there is one for $8.50, but that was not the one she was pushing, it was the $16.00 one!! She recommend it like, 4-5 times. We thought that was odd and maybe just our waitress, but when watching the other's, they all pushed it. Which made not only us, but several other customers uncomfortable. We actually had a conversation with the people at the table next to us about it. They too were shocked at the inconsistency of the pricing and the quality of the food.   Needless to say, we will not be back. We would rather visit IHOP, Crackers & Co, or Wildberries."}
{"text":"Don't do this DDD - Detour! Went because of Food Network, very sorry.  Both restrooms atrocious, clogged and flithy.  Seating crowded, they put too many tables and chairs in the place - waitstaff and customers have hard time moving about.  Tables so close together could not hear own conversation.  Waiting area in direct morning sun, extrememly limited shade - it was 97 degrees at 10am and blistering to wait the 15 minutes on a Sunday morning, and then so very uncomfortable inside.  Had to flag down waitstaff for order and for a coffee refill.  Lemon pancakes tasted like undercooked, oversoaked French Toast.  My coffee cup was dirty and cracked.  Maybe they got too busy and couldn't handle the uptick due to the TV shot.  Won't return.  (Oh, couple at the table next to us got waffles and were disappointed with their food as well.)"}
{"text":"Written a couple weeks ago...Had to grub the chicken fried steak which was lovely and the yummy hash browns made up for the tasting size of gravy, also eggs on top is an interesting plating idea. Hubby's brioche toast is indeed the signature dish I agree with Guy!  Headed there again today for brunchie!"}
{"text":"Waiting for about 20min in a scorching AZ day but well worth the wait and love having an Over Easy in my hood!!"}
{"text":"I went here with my hubby on a Saturday morning and there were a lot of people outside that were waiting for a table.  I walked up to the waitress stand and we were seated right away.  I guess everyone else had a party greater than 2 people.  Hubby ordered the Wolfpack, I ordered the corned beef hash, and we shared an order of the Waffle dogs.  The waffle dogs came out first - it was the best thing I have ever had for breakfast.  It was like a hot dog on a stick but they were breakfast sausage on a stick, dipped in waffle batter and fried.  I could only eat one because it was so rich and dense, but delicious.  Then came our food.  I like butter on my food, but there was an overwhelming amount of butter on the hashed browns and on the corned beef, that it was way too icky.  I could only eat about 5 bites and I was done.  Hubby said the same with his wolf pack breakfast that it was drenched sigh too much butter.  Overall, it was pricey for the food that I thought was so-so.  I would maybe come back for the waffle dogs, but I'm not sure if my stomach can handle that much better again."}
{"text":"Arrived at 10:30 on a Sunday morning for a late breakfast and were informed of a 30 minute wait. There were empty tables inside and in the patio, so not sure if they were understaffed or what. Once we were seated all was fine. Interesting menu items, food was served hot and the drink menu was a pleasant surprise. Mama liked her Bloody Mary, and my coffee was good.   Our waiter was attentive and checked on us just the right amount.   We'd like to see them add regular tabasco sauce to their available hot sauces. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great food and atmosphere. Their iced coffee and biscuits and gravy are to die for. Yum!"}
{"text":"I seriously love this place! Best Pancakes! I have been waiting to come back from Wisconsin just to eat here again! I love their Mimosas, and the staff is always super nice! I haven't had a bad experience yet! Give it a try! They give you a ton of food!"}
{"text":"The food at any Over Easy location is on point, but the service at this one was poor. I say at the counter and the man who was taking care of it was constantly disappearing . He took the guys card to pay and ten minutes later he was still MIA. The waitresses seemed like chicken with their heads cut off and no one wanted to help unless it was their table. A female waited an extremely long time for her to go order. I'll be going out of my way to the Mesa location next time."}
{"text":"This place was good, but thats about it.  I wouldn't say amazing, but it was a fun little experience and i'd like to go back when it's not so crowded.  I thought the decorations were sort of sloppy, a bunch of random baby animals stenciled on the wall-in spare, and random spots.  I didn't like how I was practically sitting on the people next to me because of how many tables they are trying to cram in that place.  I had a traditional eggs, sausage, and hash browns with toast-and for $7.50 I was highly disappointed in the portion. It was weeeeeak, nothing like a real diner would serve.  My man had the chicken fried steak he said was okay, he liked that it wasn't fried batter and a little chicken like most places you order from.   Our waitress was fast and friendly, so was service."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great value. Staff was friendly and place has a very open and clean feel. For you ice coffee people be sure to try the \"Cold Brew\" on tap! I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I have not been to Over Easy for some time. I couldn't believe the changes with the new look. They added Cold Brew and Nitro on tap by Press Coffee!  The staff was very friendly and let me know abt the new menu coming soon. This might be my new favorite breakfast spot."}
{"text":"What a dissapointment when you see such an exciting menu, unable to make a choice then you are served frozen hashbrowns and low quality ingrediants.  The chicken fried steak was consumed by a porky/ smoke flavor. The service was friendly and charming but I can't get over the dissapointment in food quality."}
{"text":"Great service...great food!  The manager is always checking on folks - helping the servers, busing tables...hard working leadership.  The meal I prefer when I go is called the Dolly - really good egg sandwich with bacon, cheddar cheese and tomatoes.  I've tried the Loco Moko (very good), pancakes and omelettes...all very good!  They also make jam (in-house) that is VERY good!  Ask the manager (Chris) for the grape...it'll definitely make him laugh!"}
{"text":"The last time I visited my thought was  \"really no need to return, nothing special.\" But I wanted breakfast and was driving by, so...  I was by myself so I sat at the counter. It took 5 minutes to get coffee even though the waiter walked back and forth by me several times. When you are at the counter, you should have coffee in 5 seconds, not 5 minutes.   40 minutes after I placed my order my waiter came out of the kitchen and apologized, but they had lost my ticket and could I remind him what I ordered. I didn't punch him in the throat, but I did leave and will not be back. The space they moved into is too small. Everybody is bumping into each other and it's chaos. The customers are the ones who suffer. Never again."}
{"text":"I've been to other Over Easy locations in the valley and usually like my experiences. I wasnt impressed with the Warner location.  The retro feel is fun but the staff was unfriendly and slow. I thought the portions were small and the home fries were nothing special. Just butter and sliced potatoes. -  I left hungry."}
{"text":"How charming...an old Taco Bell! :) I had big expectations for this place, being located in the vicinity of fan favorites such as The Vig, LGO, Chelsea's...well you get what I'm saying.  The interior is bright, sunny and welcoming. You can see the kitchen make you your delicious breakfast....or what should have been a delicious breakfast... We had a blueberry muffin with lemon curd to start. I love that flavor combo, but our muffin tasted packaged and the lemon curd was poorly made.  For my main course, I had some combination of eggs and bacon and hashbrowns (No, toast is NOT included!). I always order my eggs over medium because runny whites make me gag and my bacon well done, because who likes soggy cured pork fat?! I was thoroughly disappointed that not only were my eggs oozing clear jiggly white liquid, but my bacon was soft and slighlty soggy. Oh and I do not know if they prepare the hashbrowns there themselves, but if they do, the cooks should make them appear a little bit less than the frozen bagged stuff you get at Fry's.  On the plus side, the service was great, and the manager even nicer than the servers."}
{"text":"I went here after buying the Amazon Local Deal ($10 for $20). The location is clean, bright and modern...but the first thing that put me off was the coffee...NASTY. They have the 'hole in the wall cafe, drip coffee thing' going on which is all you can order. So no specialty drinks are available (as in an Americano or anything having to do with espresso).  I personally think that the industrial sized drip coffee machines tend to taste burnt and watered down...which was exactly what this coffee tasted like. If you ask me, A BREAKFAST PLACE SHOULD SERVE REALLY GOOD COFFEE. Period. Otherwise what's the point?  The food was just ok...nothing special and certainly nothing to be remembered by. The pancakes tasted a little bland and my breakfast burrito (Selena) was just ok. I only ended up eating half of it and took the other half to go, which I'm going to take a wild guess that it's just going to end up in the trash anyway later today.  I went with a friend for this visit but my husband has been wanting to try this place too. Once I tell him about the coffee situation, it will be over though. We won't be coming back."}
{"text":"We had the chicken and waffles and a lemon ricotta pancake. Unfortunately, the pictures I had seen on yelp were from the Over Easy location on Indian School. The chicken here had an odd taste to the seasoning and was tough and stringy. It also looked nothing like the pictures from the Indian School site. (I wonder if they have different recipes? Different owners?) The waffles were okay. I really enjoyed the lemon ricotta pancake - it reminded me of german pancakes. It was very crepe like. THE SERVICE WAS GREAT."}
{"text":"Was sat and once our waitress was reminded about us she admitted she forgot about us. Food quality poor. Hash browns were crunchy not crispy. Will not return"}
{"text":"My husband loved the chicken and waffles and I got the country fried steak with eggs and hash browns. The food was delicious but the steak was a bit tough. Overall we would go back!!"}
{"text":"i did not like this place.  Went to try it out because of all the talk. Got pancakes they were served with raw batter in the middle, not fully cooked.  Waitress sort of rolled her eyes, was not too apologetic.  Normally for any upscale place the manager would come over and apologize.  Nothing from this place.  Brought out more pancakes later after we had already eaten everything else.  Nothing taken off the bill for this whole fiasco.  SKIP this place, they are busy and don't care so maybe the shoudl be LESS busy..."}
{"text":"We have eaten here twice and have had great experiences both times.  LOVE that a breakfast spot in Gilbert has a bar and not just a mimosa.  Food is quick, delicious and meals are very large, we each had our own meal the first time and shared the second, not a Bloody Mary fan but their fresh squeezed OJ makes for a great mixer!  Staff is extremely friendly, even though they like the Seahawks....J/K.  Great breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"The low ratings blow my mind for over easy. I thought I was a huge, picky, food snob. I have to admit, if I rated this place about 8 months ago when I first went, it would have been 3 stars due to let down. First time, I tried the over easy and had the waffle dogs for a breakfast dessert. Both of them were just meh...nothing to write home to Mom about.   I decided to stop back in about 2 months later because I was driving by. Glad I did! The wolf pack with goat cheese blew my mind. Went back a few days later, country fried chicken blew my mind. Same story again for the eggs and sirloin, and jalapeno biscuits. I have yet to have something bad on the menu with the exception of the over easy and the waffle dogs. Especially considering the price and I can sit at the bar there and stare at McDowell Mountain while I eat breakfast for the same price I'd pay at a Denny's without the creepy Denny's patrons there-hard to find much to complain about here!"}
{"text":"Food: Very yummy. I've tried a few different things and they've all been great. It's breakfast so they can't mess it up too much. Food came out hot & well prepared. My favorite is the Crying Pig Omelette with Hash Browns.  Location: N. Scottsdale area, next to Ice Den, not too many breakfast places up here so can get busy. There is indoor & outdoor seating. Kind of a small place.  Overall: Great breakfast place!"}
{"text":"NEVER ORDER UBER EATS FROM HERE. First of all, I ordered three items to be delivered. Uber Eats only delivered two of the items. This in no way is the drivers fault, but of course they make you call support and have your money refunded and then have the order placed again. I replaced the order to have that item delivered, one sandwich. It was over an hour when I called Over Easy, the women who answered the phone said she had requested a driver 20 minutes ago. So my sandwich took 40 minutes to make and it was sitting there for 20 minutes?!? Unacceptable!!!! Big Fail on both parties if that is the case. NEVER AGAIN!!"}
{"text":"I admit that breakfast is not my favorite meal, but I do appreciate a good one. And this place offers a pretty good one. I had Blue Cakes and wished for more blueberries. I had sausage as a side and at two for $4.00 I expected something pretty special--but they were not. Someone else had French Toast and it was good but again nothing special. But given the good service, pleasant dining area and convenient location I would go back for breakfast. It was more than adequate and far better than any of the chains."}
{"text":"Food good  BAD SERVICE Waitress was rushing Us because we didn't decide what we want when we asked for drinks she forgot what we want (juts 2 people ordered drinks) ...the food came and she keep asking are you guys done are you guys done..... and when we didn't tip her \"enough\" she came outside to the parking lot and she screamed at us Not to comeback to the restaurant  because our tip wasn't enough REAL BAD THING TO SAID TO A CUSTOMER!!!!!  good food  not good service"}
{"text":"The food was okay.  The atmosphere is 50's diner.  Not actually very pleasant.  I used a Deal Chicken which was very deceiving, which I suppose was the fault of Deal Chicken and not the restaurant. Be careful if you purchase one of these \"deals.\" It leads you to believe you are getting $15 off of a $30 purchase, and that you have to spend $30. When I presented the voucher, I was informed it was only $7.50 off of two separate dining visits. In retrospect, I don't know that we would've had to spend $30 to use the voucher.  All-in-all very confusing, so be careful."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh there is a reason why I love breakfast and this place is one of them!! The Wolf Pack is just Amazing!!!"}
{"text":"The good was great and prices are affordable.  We were surprised that the food arrived just five minutes after ordering.   Quick and pleasant service was a big plus at this venue."}
{"text":"The iced tea is very good. Toast is an up charge with an egg breakfast.     Seated immediately on a Sunday morning even though the place was packed!  Very attentive at bussing tables. The slightest bit of 'trash' was removed quickly and unabtousively."}
{"text":"We just returned from this \"recommended\" breakfast spot and could not have been more unimpressed. First of all, red-eyed gravy is a savory gravy, not a brown sugar sweet sauce. If the restaurant wants to do a sweet sauce on ham, call it what it is: a brown sugar sauce with a hint of coffee flavor. There are people who would like a sweet sauce, but if you order true red-eyed gravy, you will be very disappointed. My husband's blue berry pancakes were plain pancakes with a few blueberries sprinkled along the sides of the pancakes. Skip this place and head to Chompies on Shea Rd. near Scottsdale hospital for a very good breakfast."}
{"text":"WOW!  I love this place!  All the food is made from fresh ingredients (except the tater tots) which means they can make adjustments to about anything you order. My favorite is the chiquiles, but I also get scrambled eggs with spinach, garlic and tomatoes. Sometimes we just say \"surprise me\" and something terrific shows up at the table. The new locations is a lot easier since there is plenty of parking and no long wait!"}
{"text":"Seriously one of the BEST breakfast places near me! They are always pretty busy so do expect a wait but it is well worth it! Plus you're able to get a morning cocktail while waiting :) haven't had a bad meal yet and the service was great! Super friendly staff all around! Definitely recommend this place to anyone and everyone!!"}
{"text":"I get the chicken fried steak but made with chicken. Its soooo good. I probably eat here once a week but I also only do take out. The wait time to eat there is too long on the weekends."}
{"text":"Quick to get a table, server was nice.  Portions are horribly small- french toast my boyfriend could have at twice as much and he's not a big guy- and they weren't even good. My potatoes tasted like straight butter and the sausage was pink and tasted like turkey so I didn't enjoy that at all. Oh and they are over-priced especially with the little food they gave you.  If your ok with paying a lot for a little then go, but we won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Very mixed reviews here.  I found Over Easy a great place for breakfast and enjoyed my visit with some friends.    They have a very good menu selection and will cook just about anything you could possibly want for breakfast if it's not on their menu.    Their veggie omelet and a side of fruit was excellent!  My friend had their Wolf Pack omelet and it was good but a bit heavy especially with their fried potatoes. The portions are huge and their prices are fair.   This is a great place for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Went there on Friday and was impressed. Beautiful morning to sit out on their patio.   Interesting menu for a breakfast spot, but we just stuck with the basics.  Son got M&M pancakes (can't mess those up if you tried!).  I caught myself eating his when he wasn't looking.  Wifey got the mushroom, cheese, and egg scramble and it was really good.  That is usually outside of her comfort zone (she's a minimalist) but she housed it.  I had the bacon, egg, cheese, and tomato english muffin.  Really good, crisp bacon, and crisp english muffin (sometimes tend to be too soft).  Bigger than you'd think it be.    It was a little pricey for a breakfast spot, but a good meal and a little more creative than your typical breakfast joint. We'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"We came on a Sunday and there was a long wait but that's expected on a Sunday. Our food was great and they made sure they had a booster seat and crayons for my niece. They even played with her and entertained her. Food was plentiful and the coffee was good as well."}
{"text":"I really, really wanted to like Over Easy.   The space looked cool. It was recommended to me by a friend.  I decided to take my girlfriend there one Sunday morning.  I was surprised.  My food seemed slopped together, but I ate it.  The worst part was my girlfriend's experience.   She ordered lox and cream cheese.  Of course, we both thought that they would include a bagel or bread of some kind...NO.  They gave her two pieces of lox, a glop of cream cheese and three pieces of cold asparagus. She looked at me and said, \"What am I supposed to do with this?\"  She ate it, but was repelled by asparagus for the next month.  Just say no....."}
{"text":"Went there to have breakfast. Beautiful place, open with a lot of natural light. Our server was wonderful, poor thing feel bad out order was messed up, not once but twice. My husband ordered corn need hash. How put onions and pepper on corn-beef hash? Well they do.. We asked if they could make it without... NO. I'm thinking the cook was too lazy to do it. Anyway, he re-ordered country fried sta"}
{"text":"After seeing their Phoenix location on Diners Drive ins and Dives I was really excited to check out Over Easy. We ordered the chicken and waffles and the Florentine and the mint lemonade the chicken had no flavor, it really needed seasoning, the potatoes that came with the Florentine had no taste seems like all they did was just fry them and sprinkle some paprika for color. Actually the best thing that we had was the mint lemonade they were absolutely delicious. SOOOOOOO disappointed."}
{"text":"Went here Tuesday for brunch and as always it was great. Amazingly great food and always very attentive staff. The homemade jam is a highlight from every visit and it changes constantly. On Tuesday, there was a peach and strawberry and the peach was simply marvelous!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious. But customer service was awful. The hostess at the front seemed annoyed and she was short with her words and rude. The wait was over 45 min, the host said we were next on the waiting list and she sat people before us. Finally once we got sat, it still took us another 45 minutes to get our food. We arrived at the restaurant at 10, didn't get out til 1230."}
{"text":"I really really wanted to like this place because of its potential in terms of location. I did finish my plate since I was starving plus I was raised to always finish my food. The \"Loko Moko\" had no taste to it... at all. The gravy on top was very bland. The patty was unevenly cooked, even the gravy was not able to cover that. Didn't care for the crispy onions on top. The person with me ordered the breakfast burrito and the verdict was the same. Truly Over Easy including the seasoning and the cooking. I might try a different item next time... if I don't get sick from the undercook meat that I just ingested."}
{"text":"Will never come here again.  While service was okay, food and presentation were horrible and totally overpriced!"}
{"text":"Food is always yum at this place and I love their Over Easy Iced.  I appreciate the value pricing as well for what I consider gourmet/artisan food. And the service is always great.  Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Food is decent. Service is slow and unresponsive. They brought half our food and then we had to sit and stare at our food over 8 minutes before the other half came. It took three asks to get syrup. The server wrote our order wrong. They have a tight waiting area which feels right on top of people eating."}
{"text":"Breakfast should not take an hour to serve, it can really kill the flow of your day.  Unfortunately, something happened to our order, and the server had to take it again about a half-hour after we first placed it, but then we continued to wait another 30 minutes for it to finally arrive.  I would have given Over Easy a second chance, but we were sitting right next to the host table, where two people were helping seating people all morning.  I have to believe one was a manager.  Either that or there was no manager on duty.  No manager ever approached our table and apologized for the delay.  Nothing.  I was in a party of two and the party of four next to us was almost done eating by the time we got our good.  And they came in maybe 10 or 15 minutes after us!    Things happen, but the food wasn't good enough to bring me back and I was really disappointed at the lack of urgency or awareness by the staff."}
{"text":"whoa!!  this was a great treat.  i hear some buzz, i read some reviews....i tried it, and i loved it.  sunny on the inside.  over easy all around!  extra friendly staff, my waitress did a rhyme and dance when i ordered the wolfpack breakfast !  awesome.  i like to look for the \"best bite\" when i'm really enjoying a meal.  i thought one bite midway was unbeatable...  i was wrong cuz i said to my friend the last bite gave me slight chills and a pang along my jaw line.  all the best bites i could handle.  if you want extra crisp hash browns, this would be the place to get em.  whew!  i won't eat till tomorrow.  starch overload and satisfied till i get to go again!"}
{"text":"Over Easy doesn't have enough good vegetarian or vegan options.  Would it kill you restauranteurs to put ONE really good vegan thing on? That being said, they make some tasty food at reasonable (but not specifically cheap) prices.  My personal favorite: the Selena burrito.  This is a gigantic burrito that comes with whatever you want, but the base item is shredded hash browns.  I omit the meat and usually get tomatoes and onions added and I love it.  It is two meals.  The burritos come with a small cup of fruit, and wouldn't you know it, it's GOOD fruit!  Not the standard stingy fruit cup of watery, old melon slices with a few sad red grapes.  No way.  This fruit cup includes lots of fresh blueberries, blackberries, and strawberries alongside the typical sad fruit items (I hate melons and grapes).  Dang!  It's in the details and this one really impressed me.  We ordered for work once and they were friendly and fast (if not slightly strained) with our 25-meal order.  There wasn't a single mistake in the food items or the bill.  A record?  Probably."}
{"text":"I went there this morning with a friend who has managed upscale restaurants and has owned her own restaurant.  We were greeted right away, and asa soon as we sat down a waitress came by for our coffee order which she promptly brought to us.  The waitress gave us just enough time to peruse the menu before asking for our requests. I ordered the Pig omelet with hash browns, my friend ordered the Mediterranean omelet with home fries.  It seemed like we could barely start talking when the orders arrived.  The meals were huge and presented nicely.  My friend commented that it was the hottest omelet she had ever been served and it was perfect.  Same thing with my omelet, it was very hot as were the hash browns and everything was excellent.  So for the fast, friendly, efficient service and the great food we give this place 5 stars because it well deserved."}
{"text":"I love breakfast. It's my favorite meal of the day, so I am always excited when a new AM spot opens up.  Well.  After reading all of the wonderful reviews of this place, I had high expectations. I suppose that was my mistake.   I love the fact that this place is in an old Taco Bell. The transformation from cheesy fast food joint to civilized restaurant was well executed and turned out really cute. I love the outdoor seating with the patio heaters.   But....when I end up paying almost $15 for breakfast, I expect a little more than what I got at Over Easy. I ordered the Over Easy, a side of hash browns (because breakfast just isn't complete without potatoes!) and coffee. The Over Easy was very tasty. The spinach, egg and bacon sauce were perfect toppings for the toasted Brioche.  I wasn't disappointed with the taste of the Over Easy, but I don't think that it alone was worth $9. It needs something- like potatoes- on the side.   About that side of hash browns- they were dry and required liberal salt and pepper. Pretty disappointing, especially since the saucer sized side dish was $3. (not even kidding about the saucer.)   The coffee was good. If I lived nearby, I might drop in only for the coffee.  This place doesn't live up to the hype. I won't be back, especially since there are much tastier options closer to home."}
{"text":"What happened to this place. They changed the menu and took off some of the few good things they had and added fluff. Place is dead now. No brewed ice tea for a restaurant in Az REALLY?"}
{"text":"Not worth the drive. Chicken fried steak was really tough, not enough gravy and the other meals were just ok."}
{"text":"We had chicken and waffles and the Mediterranean omelette, both were outstanding!  Service was good too.  Will definitely go back often."}
{"text":"Nothing but good things to say about this place. Excellent food, service was great, and reasonably priced. I highly recommend trying a glass of their fresh squeezed OJ. I will definitely be back to Over Easy in the mear future!"}
{"text":"Fell into the \"it was on Food Network so let's visit\" trap. It was an okay breakfast, but the service was pretty lackluster. Not worth driving from Phoenix for the food, however; the drive itself is very nice and they have a lovely patio on which you can eat your eggs."}
{"text":"Stopped in this morning for breakfast and out group of three was sorely disappointed.  The service was awful.  The waitress had a terrible attitude and made is feel like we were a bother and wasting her time.  The hostesses weren't much better.  For as crowded as it was we expected halfway decent food.  My toast was burnt black to a crisp, the hashbrowns undercooked and very greasy.  The \"small\" orange juice for $3 came in what looked like a shot glass with no refills.  I will definitely not be returning, ill stick to Denny's if I want a mediocre breakfast for half the price of this place."}
{"text":"Went on a Monday morning about 9ish. Not busy and it was our first visit. met with a big smile by a very friendly girl who sat us where we wanted to sit. Laura (mini) was our waitress, great service from her. The place has the feel of a high school cafeteria...nothing warm or very comfy. Stark is the word! The food, I really expected more froma restaurant concept that has had the noteriety of the original. The home fries were sparce and very average. The malt waffle was $7.00 and I coudn't taste any malt! My eggs benedict was average at best.....the sauasge inside was howver very tasty! And $6.00 for a glass of O.J. (fresh squeezed) but still a lot in my book! Overall, it seems this pace is living off the reputation the original USED to have. There seemed to be no passion, just folks going thru paces and no effort to WOW the customer with something worthy of a return trip! I will give them a 2nd chance, every place deserves a 2nd chance, but they better step up the presentation and WOW factor!"}
{"text":"We just suffered through breakfast at the new \"Over Easy\" in Mesa NOT PHOENIX.  It was tasteless and terrible.   My wife had something \"healthy\" - steak and egg whites.  The steak was tasteless.   The plate was covered in a tasteless watery substance that looked like soup.  I had the tasteless chicken fried steak.  It was equally bad.  Even the \"gravey\" had no flavor.   Even the tater tots had a bad aftertaste.   Instead of having the \"hot sauces\" out on the table (and you will need LOTS of hot sauce for any flavor at all), they ask you which \"one\" you want and then they don't even have Red Tobasco as an option.  They have no steak knives, which is just a bit weird for a place that serves chicken fried steak.   I'm not really sure what I had because I love chicken fried steak, and this was terrible fried terrible.   We would never, ever consider going to the Over Easy for anything again.  In fact, the conversation on the way home was how awful the food was, and when we think it will close.  It was shockingly awful!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat for breakfast and lunch. It's healthy and so delicious! Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Amazing chicken fried steak.  You get a lot of food for a decent price.  Not a place where you can hang out for a while though.  All and all a great place to grab some grub!"}
{"text":"Amazing, and original, try a number of dishes family style and don't miss the waffle dogs!"}
{"text":"Ehhhh... I'm underwhelmed...  On a scale of 1-10... I give it a C...  Because that is how much sense it makes to not make an amazing scrabbled egg.....  Tried this place twice......  Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me....."}
{"text":"I heard about this place on yelp and found out that it was on the best thing I ever ate or the diner show. Any how it is far from me, but I had some time and I am always willing to have good food, so I decided to pay a visit. It took about 40 minutes but I was willing to give it a try. First it was like 6:45 am so only I and a couple of other early riser. I had what everyone was raving about, the waffle dog and the famous caramelized banana french toast and a side of sweet potato tater tots and of course coffee. First all of that was like over 20.00 with tip, so it is pretty steep for breakfast. First off, the waffle dog was not that great or even good really. I think it is a good ideal but unfortunately the battered is just too light so after the first bite and dipping, it kind of fell away from the sausage. It needs a heavier binder like cornmeal aka corn dogs to really stick to the sausage. The other problem I noticed that the sauce combination of hot sauce and maple syrup kind of canceled each other out. At first I was surprise that the sauce was bland, then I remembered that when you want to counter something spicy, you use something sweet. So no matter how I mixed the sauces together, I just could not get that sweet, spicy, salty combination to be right. If they want it to be more consistent, they need to formulate the sauce and premix it. The sausage was lost in everything so you only get a little salty taste at the end. I understand they are going for that salt,sweet, & spicy combination similar to say sweet and sour chicken but unfortunately they don't achieve it. I really can't see why people love them, they are just okay and pretty awful when you considered they are 8.00, would not order them again myself.  The second thing  I had was the french toast. First they did not caramelized it long enough because it was just runny and it made the french toast all soggy. They also used just regular sliced bread, not even Texas toast, something thicker to give it some crispiness to it. A perfect french toast is light and crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside, this was not nearly anything like that. They need to add some starch to make the sauce a real sauce and not just water. It had to be one of the worse french toast I have ever had.   The last thing was the sweet potato tater tots, now they don't look like they made these from scratch or if they did I would not know. All I know was that it was not crispy in the least. Tater tots should be crispy and firm. Had a funny taste to it that I could not identify.  Well that was my one and probably last visit to here. It is just too far to go for below average food."}
{"text":"We went in on a beautiful afternoon and sat with Annette. Our food came out quickly, first our fried green tomatoes and second, our #3 Lolo plates.   Annette was AMAZING! We never waited for a refill, she was very attentive!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat.  My favorite dish is Gary's Croatian Spinach Loaf. It may sound odd, but trust me, it is delicious!!"}
{"text":"I'm not really a big breakfast person so imagine my surprise when I first stepped foot in this place... My parents had been raving about Over Easy so I agreed to meet my mom here one day for lunch. We shared \"The Wolfpack\" and it was amazing! Yes there is plenty of food to share. It's eggs with bacon and cheese covered with an enormous amount of perfectly crisp hash browns. Service has always been great. The only thing I'm not a fan of is the tables are very small and sometimes  can feel a little crowded. There is always a line but it usually flows fairly quickly. Definetely won't be disappointed with giving this place a shot!"}
{"text":"Fantastic!  I had regular French toast and bacon, wife had an omelet, friend had the chicken fried steak, everyone was extremely pleased, service was great!  Waitress helped us with local attractions/ directions.  Price reasonable. Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"ANYONE WHO WRITES A BAD REVIEW FOR THIS PLACE IS AN IDIOT!!!!! I have been to culinary school, traveled Europe and love just great food. I am telling you that this is by far the best breakfast place I have ever eaten at. The homemade Country Fried Steak and eggs is my favorite! Brilliant!!!"}
{"text":"Recently had breakfast with family at Over Easy.  The food was really good and at an even better price.  The menu is pretty simple, I had the asparagus omelette and potatoes, which were both yummy.    The restaurant is small, so expect a wait.  The patio is cute, but in the summer I don't see myself dying to sit outside.  The building is the original Taco Bell in Phoenix, so you get the idea of size.  Also, the place closes early - 11am I think....  Cute addition to the Arcadia Neighborhood, and a deviation from the traditional breakfast joints."}
{"text":"This place is yellow!! Like neon egg yolk colored walls. Both my colleague and I commented on it like wow! That will wake ya up on a Sunday morning! If the weather is nice, I suggest the patio.  We got coffee which the lovely server was very proud to mention it's locally roasted from Press. We loved it and enjoyed several cups each.  I had the wolf pack which is a huge pile of hash browns eggs and bacon with your choice of cheese. This was awesome. When I asked for salsa, they have PICO! This freshly made pico is the main star of my dish. ASK FOR PICO!   The breakfast burrito looked awesome too."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! I bring my family here every time they come in from out of town and they look forward to it! My brothers favorite are the waffle dog's."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for a while. Finally did this morning I was not disappointed the food was amazing I had the chicken and waffles very friendly staff. I will definitely be back I was very impressed can't believe I haven't been here before. Thank you very much for a delicious breakfast!!!"}
{"text":"Environment is fun and artsy however the food fails to live up to the hype. Worth checking out but will not be a regular."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this place 4 stars, but just couldn't bring myself to do it.  Nice enough place and a friendly staff even when slammed on a Sunday morning. But the food was a mixed bag. Ordered three items: Pollo Omelette, Chicken Fried Steak, and of course we had to try the Waffle Dogs. The omelette was a disaster. It might have been the driest omelette I've ever had. No jalepeno or heat to the dish even though that it was a main ingredient. Looked unappetizing when they set the plate on the table. Now to the other side of the spectrum...the chicken fried steak certainly lived up to the hype. Delicious, tender, gravy was perfect consistency and the fried egg on top made this a dish worth going back for. And finally, the waffle dogs. I think my expectations got the better of me here. I was expecting a dish that was going to knock me off my chair, but what I ended up with was glorified, albeit quite tasty, fair food. The sausage could have had a bit more flavoring as it just wasn't savory enough to balance the waffle batter and maple syrup (syrup was delicious, BTW). Conclusion, I will certainly give this place another try. Maybe it was just a bad day for the omelette cook."}
{"text":"ok food. Service a VERY slow. The table was dirty and the window ledge was full of dead bugs. The server was very slow and didn't pay much attention. What looked like managers were standing around the front podium staring out the front door. We waited a good ten mintues to get the check. We wont be going back.   You can get a better breakfast at IHOP or maybe even Denny's."}
{"text":"50's diner setting with counter & tables for large portioned breakfasts. Food was good.  Selected 3 choices for omelet."}
{"text":"Service was okay and good scene. Food wasn't good at all and WAY to expensive. $4.50 for coffee is just stupid. It was $30 for just myself to get steak and egg whites. Just doesn't make any sense. My buddies breakfast burrito was terrible. Tasted like plan potatoes in bread.  We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Lox and eggs were delish! A little disappointed in the eggs Benedict. The chicken in the chicken and waffles combination was huge and cooked well. The kids pancakes were pretty small and overpriced."}
{"text":"This was a very disappointing visit. We have been wanting to try this breakfast spot for several months and finally did so this morning.  We know to expect a wait at a breakfast spot on Sunday morning, so that was no big deal.  The only reason we are giving over easy 2 stars is because the server was very nice and made suggestions from the menu when he learned none of the 5 in our party had been there.  My wife is eating a dairy free diet due to our breastfed son, and she made the server aware of this prior to ordering. She ordered a breakfast sandwich with no cheese and requested the egg not be fried in butter. Her sandwich came out smothered with a slice of cheese- the server looked bewildered but took it back. It was replaced in about 2 minutes with another sandwich with 2 basted eggs (clearly cooked in butter), but the sandwich she ordered was supposed to be fried hard. We didn't bother sending it back again.  I ordered the pollo loco omelet without the Swiss cheese. It came with a big glob of cheese inside it. I didn't bother sending it back but scraped the cheese out of it. Maybe they are better able to submit and make special orders on less busy days, but I don't think we will return to find out."}
{"text":"So i visit over easy on 44th st and Indian school almost every Sunday with great service  but today I was further in Scottsdale an decided to stop at the East Bell location. The location is listed to close at 1pm I arrived in the door at 12:53pm the place was still bustling and I could see and hear the kitchen calling out orders. I politely asked if they were still open it was told to go down the hall to the attached restaurant to 18 below is explained I would like to eat here and I see the kitchen is still calling out orders I was told if I hurry up and order they guess I could have a seat. At this point I should have just left . So I stay and they have changed the menu this is one of the main reasons I come my kids can get a waffle with one filling for 3.00 great price but now the waffles are 5.50 for the same thing this doesn't even come with home fries or bacon ..not worth the price and on top of that I waited 30 minutes for my food just to find a light blonde/light brown hair in my food ... very disappointed I think I will be letting over easy go and a Sunday brunch spot."}
{"text":"Solid to very good breakfast spot. Have been a couple times and everything has been quality. The signature \"Over Easy\" egg dish is outstanding.   I drive by an IHOP on the way here, and there's almost always people waiting there at good times. Waiting to pay the same (or more) to eat premix boxed eggs and pancakes vs a real made from scratch location like this? You crazy.   Skip the chains, a better breakfast awaits."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast with my daughter this morning.  I had been to the one in Gilbert several times and liked it.  The restaurant itself is cute.  We just walked in and sat down and were waited on quickly. We got the Over Easy iced coffee, which is flavored with cinnamon, cardamom and mint, and it was delicious, and you get a large glass of it, which is a definite plus.  I ordered the malted waffle, which was good, and my daughter ordered the brioche French toast, which was tasty, but the portion was quite small for the price, in my opinion.  We also got hash browns and bacon, which was good.  I prefer the caramelized banana French toast they have, but our meal was tasty, too.  I'll probably go there again.  Breakfast is my favorite meal to eat out."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Had a wait but it was well worth it. I would recommend and I would return without any doubt. Service was a bit slow but it was very very busy. Try it"}
{"text":"The restaurant was very slow at clearing tables and seating people. At one point, there were 5 different tables open and a 30-40 minute wait. Once you are seated the food was quick to come. The food was ok, but not worth a long and unorganized wait."}
{"text":"Husband and I were on our way to one of our fav breakfast places and decided to be spontaneous and try somewhere new. We found Over Easy on Yelp and didn't even realize it was part of The Yard in Tempe! I've been to The Yard in Phoenix and absolutely loved it so I had hopes for this one as well.   As someone who has worked in the food service industry as a server for numerous years I feel like I let things slide because I know how crazy things can get sometimes. This was unfortunately not the case at Over Easy.   The hostess took our name down and gave us the standard 10-15 minutes. It was not busy, and we were the only people waiting to be seated, there were a couple of tables that were open, and I figured the hostess was giving the server in that section a little time between tables. Standard stuff in the restaurant biz, and totally understandable. We perused the rest of the facility for maybe 2 minutes and then returned to the seating area. Another couple walked in and she told them she would seat them in a second. She then seated them immediately completely disregarding us, so of course I stood up right next to the host stand, she realized she had messed up and sat us at the next table she could. Oh did I mention she was smacking her gum? I know it's a lax environment but gum smacking is just unprofessional, period.   Our server was sweet and probably the only redeeming part of our experience. Food was average. And although I appreciate servers taking plates away, we weren't completely done eating one of the plates that was taken.  The last part was what sealed the deal for me. A large party was then waiting to be seated and a couple of tables around us had gotten up, it was pretty obvious that they were going to seat them and just needed our table, again, we were not done eating yet, and the hostess comes over and starts taking everything off our table, including water cups, coffee, everything. Then says \"sorry\" when I tell her I'm not finished. Still smacking her gum by the way.   I'm sad we had such a crumby experience and will definitely not be back to Over Easy. I typically love Fox Concepts restaurants, but this one has fallen short. :("}
{"text":"Fantastic place for a great breakfast!  Amy the server was outstanding!  It reminds me of a modern version my favorite breakfast place in Jackson, Mi.  Loved it... Great for family and small groups!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, service, and experience.  Will return regularly, as often as I get to town.   Chilaquiles are fantastic.  Outstanding menu with sweet, savory, healthy if u r so inclined.  Next time, it's the fried chicken and waflles or is it the corn beef hash or an omelet.  So many decisions.  I'll have to come back again (and again, and again).  Service couldn't be better, and with a smile.  Well done Over Easy, well done."}
{"text":"Sitting no here wondering why we actually still sat down after getting a begrudging and snarky greeting from \"hostess\". Been sitting for 20 minutes. Waitress delivered cold coffee. Didn't recheck. Father waiting for 20 minutes for hot coffee. When asked to bring fresh coffee we were told it was dumped because they were closing in 45 minutes. Waitress begrudgingly asked if we wanted new coffee. I said yes my father who is 85 deserves it and was rewarded with a huge eye roll. At which point I asked her to not give me attitude after we waited 20 minutes for a check back. She then clearly bitches about me complaining and delivered dirty looks from the staff.   Food came. Mediocre. Mushy.  And evil stares. No manager present.  This is what you get when you let I'll behaved children run your restaurant.   UPDATE.   My food as well as my sons was entirely inedible. Loco Moco is about a 3% approximation of a good one and the corned beef hash cakes on the Benedict surely must be dog food. Maybe Alpo. Not sure. Disgusting food. Miserable service. NO!"}
{"text":"My first experience at Over Easy was fantastic.  I had the chicken and waffle meal, and it was incredible!  I was with a big group and everyone was sampling one another's meals, and my heart broke a little each time I had to share a bite with someone else.  It was awesome.  We went back today, and I wanted something not super heavy,  so I ordered the egg white and spinach sandwich.  So much for wanting something a bit healthy.  While the sandwich was flavorful, it was super greasy.  My husband had the wolfpack, and neither of us were very impressed with it.  Kind of blah.  Service was great both visits, but the food seems to be a bit hit or miss."}
{"text":"Writing a review  Wile I am seating here  Omg.  The food is amazing. I love the breakfast here !  Service is fantastic !"}
{"text":"In a time of pretentious breakfast joints (yeah I'm talking about you Breakfast Club) I love when I find a laidback place to have a great cup of coffee and one of the best breaky sandwiches in town (the Dolly) - a huge bonus if they will still have one of their delicious homemade cinnamon rolls available! The patio gives you a great view of the McDowells.  Over Easy offers great food, fair prices, a good crowd and a friendly staff.  (and there is plenty of parking)."}
{"text":"Love this place!! I get the breakfast burrito with spinach, feta, bacon, and avocado. My fiancé gets the chicken fried steak and he really enjoys it. The atmosphere is a littttle too bright for me and \"diner-ish.\" We only come when we're super hungover without a care in the world about our appearance, otherwise we'd go somewhere else. Food is good though!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  We are there every Sunday morning for breakfast.  Everything is good.  Huge portions.  Big fan of the hopple popple and corned beef hash.  Pancakes, oatmeal and omelets are great as well.  The staff and service are outstanding, a great place to go, relax and have the best breakfasts!   Love to sit on the patio."}
{"text":"In town for a couple days and tried this place. It was delicious. We got a couple things off the menu and were pleased with all of them. Large portions and friendly staff. Service was excellent and quick. We had the banana French toast , wolf pack and avocado toast. All were great! We will definitely be back on our next trip!"}
{"text":"It was ok. Enjoyed the freshly squeezed oj. My omelet was fair, nothing special. Spent 20$ (including tax and tip) for the above items and tea. I think $3.25 for a hot cup of water and limited tea selection was a bit much.  Not impressed. The decor is cheerful."}
{"text":"Came here with several people last week. Was pretty disappointed. The menu items all sounded good but most of us agreed that the food lacked major flavor. Don't know if they lost their salt shakers or just don't season the food...  The thing that bugged me most of all is the waiter specifically asked if I wanted the bacon in my Wolf Pack to be crispy (which I appreciated) yet the bacon was not only NOT crispy, but barely cooked properly at all.  Will stick with Snooze at Town & Country, as they never disappoint."}
{"text":"Awesome experience! A step back in time with the diner feel with a 50's -70's look. Formica I likea! :). The breakfast selections are off the chart, went with the Wolfpack, hash browns, two eggs, your choice of cheese and bacon!  Fast, friendly service, come early or you may have a little wait."}
{"text":"French toast with carmelized bananas, pecans and carmel sauce is delicious!  We went on July 4th and we waited for 20-30 minutes. Not sure if that's normal, but the service was friendly and fast."}
{"text":"Rock solid food and service!   We came down from Sedona this morning before heading to the airport.  This was my second visit and first visit to the new location. I had the ham steak with red eye gravy and hashbrowns.  Almost licked the plate clean.  Gross, I know, but it is that good.  My husband had the wolfpack and loved that too.  Super attentive service.   Folks, this is what it is all about, great food, great service at a very fair price.  I have not been for lunch, but would highly recommend for breakfast."}
{"text":"I visited for the second time yesterday and had a wonderful breakfast. Chicken fried steak is one of the best I've ever had. You can never leave this place hungry that's for sure!"}
{"text":"Went to the new Gilbert store.  Asked what the speciality was for the restaurant and the staff had no clue.  Employees knew nothing about the menu or the food.  Food was about average and very pricey for small portion size.  Both my wifes and my hash browns were burnt and I showed to waitress who said \"YEP, LOOK LIKE THERE BURNT ALRIGHT\" and did not offer to replace them or make any adjustments.  When I asked her to replace them and she looked really confused and appeared really suprised that I actually had asked her to do so, so I just let it go.  We were the only people in the store with about 5-7 tableservers and we still received very poor service.  Nothing really to write home about, will not be back."}
{"text":"We had egg sandwiches and they were just so-so. I agree with an earlier review the the hash browns were mushy and lukewarm. We did do takeout but we ate the meal quickly after it was brought to us as we were staying down the street. I can make a much better sandwich at home. Also ordered coffee while I waited for takeout and never got it. I didn't make a big deal about it since it wasn't on my bill either."}
{"text":"Early breakfast before golf. We both had 2 eggs scrambled, bacon, hash browns and toast. Good service and was quiet full from the good breakfast."}
{"text":"I truly hate this place and am sorry that this building has to live with the existence of such a crap establishment.   I've been to the Over Easy in far east Mesa and love the food, and have never had a bad cup of coffee there. The service is awesome making the overall experience really great. We thought we'd give this place a spin and after talking it up to my boyfriend, we skipped our usual visit to Snooze and went to this god awful trainwreck of a restaurant.  The restaurant was a bit busy when we got there, so we waited a few minutes to be seated and once we were seated we waited. And waited. And waited. Several staff passed by our table, no one engaging, asking if we'd been helped, just minding their own business not concerned with a table that isn't theirs. I get it, you're busy, someone else is supposed to be covering this table but they're not. But. What is so hard about stopping at a table that has no drinks, no silverware, nothing to indicate that the customers have been approached and ask them HAVE YOU BEEN HELPED? One of the waitstaff had the balls to make direct eye contact with me as he was passing our table without saying a word. I mean what?? It was infuriating to be passed over so many times without once being approached with a simple \"have you been helped?\" That's all someone had to to do. The inattentive behavior of the staff showed me that either management didn't train the staff to take a team approach to customer service or that they had just hired staff who weren't interested in taking the team approach.   After 10 minutes of this, we decided to leave because obviously no one wanted to take ownership of our table. I asked the hostess to speak to the manager and she said that the manager wasn't there and instead directed me to one of the waitstaff who may or may not have been in charge. This totally disinterested staffer gave me half of her attention as I told her what happened and why we were leaving. Instead of apologizing, even though it wasn't her fault (or maybe it was if she was in charge), she gave me two coupons for a free breakfast sandwich good at that location only.  A) Why would I come back? B) How low rent are you? and C) GIRL PLEASE R U SERIOUS?  What a waste of a perfectly good retail/restaurant space."}
{"text":"I thought it would be a great Mothers Day breakfast , it was the worst breakfast I had. The waffle was do soggy & the chicken was so dried out( it was probably left over from yesterday)"}
{"text":"I have been told this place is yummy by a couple of different people.  I have attempted to eat there twice and will not return.  First time I was taking a friend to the airport, she recommended it as close by and tasty.  It was about 5:45 am and they were closed not to open until 6:30am.  How can a place only serve breakfast and not be open until 6:30 on a weekday?  Try number two, my boyfriend and I were up and about surprisingly early on a Saturday.  I work until 4 am and usually feel like breakfast at about 2pm.  Anyway it was like 12:30 and I decided to try this place again.  We walk up to the door only to be headed off by some hippy waitress who said they were closed. The sign she pointed at stated 12:30 as closing.  They were full with more people pulling into the lot.  I look at my watch and it is 12:34.  Closing time is closing time.    Please consider however that this is a bad economy and there was opportunity for quite a bit more business that day.  I didn't feel any better about the limited hours when the waitress said \"well its lunchtime now, isn't it?\"  Please tone down the perkiness of your observational skills.  Not everyone is a 9 to 5er or for that matter able to handle perkiness during daylight hours.    When these people decide to deliver or have more reasonable hours I will consider them again.  If you are breakfast only you need to be open by 5 or 5:30 on weekdays and not close until 3pm on Saturday and Sunday."}
{"text":"Back again for one of my favorites the Country Benedict. Instead of an English muffin they serve it on a cheddar Jalapeño biscuit with a sausage patty. The other dish that was ordered was Gary's Croatian Spinach Loaf. This has a similar look to a Quiche but bigger. Both dishes were delicious!! And the wait staff was very attentive. If you have not been before I highly recommend giving Over Easy a try!"}
{"text":"Avoid the national chain restaurants for breakfast, keep it local! We have gone to three of their locations and have never been disappointed.   Filling portions of breakfast items. Most entrees are a little heavy on the potatoes but they are done to perfection! Choices on potatoes include sweet potatoes tater tots.   Our favorites include the Wolfpack, Country Eggs Benidict and Caramelized banana & pecan brioche French toast.  But the others in  my group had the House made corned beef hash with two eggs* & choice of toast and the Ham steak with redeye gravy, one egg* and choice of potato...they both had clean plates!!  Without a doubt you should not miss this place!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday morning, ecpecting to wait a bit.  To our surprise we were seated right away!  Not 5 minutes later about 4 other parties arrived and had to wait, so turns out we just had perfect timing. We decided to split our meals so we would both get to try a variety of what OverEasy has to offer.  We chose The Wolfpack, Country Benedict Cheddar Jalapeno Biscuit and Pumpkin French Toast.  The Country Benedict was our favorite.  Followed by the Pumpkin French Toast.  The Wolfpack was also good but compared with the other two had to take 3rd.  Definitely would like to go back and try more items from their delicious menu!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast place. What food would I recommend? I love the chicken and waffles, sweet potato tots, and waffle dogs! Definitely would recommend this place to anyone! There food never disappoints and service is good."}
{"text":"Really good breakfast joint. Was going to go to the Phoenix location, then found out there was a closer location over by Bell & the 101 in North Scottsdale. As, I am an avid fan of the Food Network and Guy Fieri, I had to try this place as its been on both DD&D, and BTIEA. I tried the featured Waffle Dogs as an appetizer and found them to be really good. The sausage is very good quality, large and juicy. The batter was light and airy. They are served with syrup, though personally I would like to try them with ketchup instead. I then decided to satisfy my sweet craving with the half order of caramelized banana and pecan french toast. I enjoyed the dish very much, neither the bananas or the syrup was overpowering, it was a very nice balance, and the bread was soft and warm and just delicious. Next time I go I am going to try the chicken fried steak & eggs! Oh ya."}
{"text":"When receive the bill check for SERVICE CHARGE. Is is a casual breakfast restaurant. SERVICE CHARGE for what?? Our waitress did not explain for SERVICE CHARGE.  There is no sigh for SERVICE CHARGE. After charge SERVICE CHARGE on bill waitress still asking for tip."}
{"text":"Salmon Eggs Benedict is a must eat! The sauce compliments the salmon perfectly, and the saddest part of the meal was finishing it off. I will be back for this meal again. Also, the orange juice is so fresh that it paired well with the meal. Service was quick and friendly. I am now a huge fan of this restaurant!"}
{"text":"I travel to a different city every week for work and one of the benefits to this is finding places like this.  Great service and the food was incredible. I had the Loco Moco. Perfectly cooked and very tasty. Staff was nice and very attentive. Place was very clean. Had good background music. Definitely worth going to."}
{"text":"This breakfast joint is amazing!!!! I had the chicken fried steak, while my aunt had the original eggs benedict. We both REALLY enjoyed our breakfast, and couldn't complain about it. Service was a tad slow, but that's because the poor server was swamped. The Over Easy Iced Coffee was to die for good.  Do yourself a favor and go to Over Easy! I will be returning, 100%."}
{"text":"Food was decent but over-priced. I ordered the corned beef Benedict and asked for onions on side. They said onions were already in the hash so I said I'd order it, also asked for hash browns well done. My friend ordered the traditional Benedict.   My benedict came with onions in it and onions all over the top and hash browns not well done. It also had no English muffin (although my friend's had one). The server asked if I wanted a muffin on the side so I said yes. They charged me $3 for the muffin on top of $11.50 for the Benedict.   The food was ok, but not worth $14.50 for a breakfast entree, especially with the various issues above. For convenience, I may go back, but wouldn't go out of my way.   Good selection of breakfast items, but limited lunch options. Atmosphere was bright and colorful. Server was pleasant."}
{"text":"The food is delicious, I usually eat the chilaquiles and they are so yummy, I am from Mexico and these chilaquiles taste  pretty much like the ones back home. Service is always excellent! The employees greet us with a smile every time and they are very helpful. My husband and I came here about once a week. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I love how delicious and fast this place is for pick up! Literally 10 minutes after you call, the food is ready and delicious. The wolf puck is amazing and a huge portion you could easily split with someone. The buttermilk pancakes have such a unique flavor, they are amazing."}
{"text":"We went in there to see what the place was all about. Eh not so great. The coffee is pretty bland. We le a good smooth coffee that doesn't taste like tea. The food really had no flavor. The sausage was eh, meat with no flavor, eggs well you really can't screw up an egg flavor wise. For the price not worth it. We will not be back."}
{"text":"We arrived at 7 am on a Saturday morning and there was no wait. Even at 8 am there weren't a lot of people there. I had the brioche french toast with the carmelized bananas, and they were amazing. My mom had the ham steak with red eye gravy, and we enjoyed the food but I wouldn't say this dish wasn't anything special. The hashbrowns were good but no different from any other restaurant. I didn't enjoy the coffee as much and at $2.25/ cup- that seemed expensive. Waitstaff was really friendly."}
{"text":"This place is like, so good, but like, so bad.   It all tastes so good and in my head I was screaming \"Amanda stooooop! You're full! Just take it hooomme!\" But I couldn't take it home. I couldn't. I was about to get on a plane and I didn't want to be carrying a to-go box full of food on the plane, because well, that's too much work. So I ate everything.   I ate the fried chicken on top of that waffle with maple syrup and I helped my boyfriend eat his eggs benedict that clearly had some sort of crack sauce on it because it tasted so good. And then I was even more full. But it was worth it.   So, the food here is delicious and yummy and good, and the portions are big and awesome. But, just be careful young padawan, for your eyes may be bigger than your stomach. Take it home!"}
{"text":"I ordered lunch the other day and was assisted by the staff of this restaurant and they were amazing at taking my crazy order.  Yes, I like to change the menu from time to time.  Jessica Villanueva, Johnny Iverson and the whole staff at the new location situated at the corner of Camelback and 24th Street are GREAT!!!  The food is spectacular and I highly recommend them."}
{"text":"Food very good, staff at reception not so good, waiters very friendly and helpful.   Only complaint:  several  prepared empty tables but still had to wait about 10 minutes to be seated ??"}
{"text":"Guy Fieri... what up??  This is the second Diners, Drive Ins and Dives recommendations that has disappointed.  Over Easy is sandwiched in between the Ice Den (the sometimes Coyotes and Olympic hopefuls and has beens training ice) and Mountainside Fitness.  The irony was not lost on me... two temples of fitness and health rubbing up against (quite inappropriately) the church of lard.    We tried to be DD and D purists by ordering what Guy recommended:  chicken fried steak and the carmelized banana and pecan pancakes.  First, the carmelized bananas were not.  They were raw banana slices drowned in caramel (which I believe was melted caramel candies based on the sugar content).  The dish was SO sweet it made me sick. But at least I could balance the sweetness by tasting my husband's dish which was pretty much a salt shaker surrounding a piece of meat.  Our waitress was a very nice lady but seemed to forget about us after bringing the food.    I want to give Over Easy another try, but I'll have to wait a month unti lI want to eat again at all."}
{"text":"I am giving four stars, service was amazing, but the cost of the food and what you get was not that great. The hash browns not cooked enough and cold bacon didn't help the situation. Eggs and toast wee the best, I will stick with those next time."}
{"text":"My first time there last weekend and let's just say it wasn't the best first experience.  I placed my order and it took quite awhile to get it.  Then we got our food and my order was completely wrong.  By the time they made another and brought it out everyone else was done with their food and I had to get mine to go.  The waitress took the check off the table, I was assuming they were going to give some sort of discount being as I had to take my breakfast to go now, but nope, she came back and there was no offer or mention of my inconvenience.  The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because the food I did get to eat was good, but I won't be going back.  If a restaurant screws up and you miss enjoying your meal with your table, they needed to offer something for the inconvenience."}
{"text":"Wonderful spot for breakfast. Got the wolf pack. Very tasty. Service was great and friendly."}
{"text":"DO NOT order TOGO from this location! I had ordered the Avocado Benedict and the Mediterranean Benedict this morning was told it would take 20 min. When I picked up the order I was charged $3.00 for a side of Sweet Potato tots when I had asked if these were an option as a potato side. When I opened the bag my Mediterranean eggs were on the bottom of the bag. When I told the wait staff she asked for the order to be re-made. While my Mediterranean eggs were being re-made my Avocado Benedict stayed in their Togo box that I could see was sitting on the line. When the manager came over to apologize she was condescending when I told her how frustrated I was. I had to ask for her to offer a discount or take the order off my card. Not good Management skills!! When I received my new Togo bag 15 minutes later I specially asked the Manager if the Avocado eggs that were sitting on the line was in the bag. The manager said no everything has been re-made. When I got home the Avocado eggs were cold. I will never visit this establishment again!!"}
{"text":"My very pregnant wife and her friends went to this restaurant today to use 4 living social vouchers that specifically state \"1 per customer per visit\".   As there were three paying adults, any logical person would conclude that there are 3 paying customers.   Well Over Easy disagreed and made up an un-written policy that the owner refuses to split checks, and thus the vouchers now magically only apply 1 per table, despite them specifically stating, in writing, \"1 per customer per visit\".  My pregnant wife, being 8 months pregnant and generally tired, because she is pregnant , didn't feel like arguing with the staff about plainly written conditions on the voucher.    After only being able to use 1 voucher, I have since refunded the remaining vouchers from living social and will not frequent Over Easy ever again.    And i will mention to all my friends and family how they treated a pregnant lady.   Pregnant..."}
{"text":"This was a unpleasant surprise for it to be a staple on thr popular television show with Guy. Me and my coworkers went hear and one one person was pleased with their meal. I had a very poorly breaded chicken fried steak in an attempt to get something hearty. What I was served was lack of flavor and enthusiasm. My bacon was overcooked and when they brought me more that was one second less overcooked. The \"brioche \" french toast was cut like sandwich bread which took away from the delicate bread that it is. And the Reese pancakes the candy isn't even mixed with the batter. Overall this was a bad experience especially because we were so hungry. I can't recommend if you like seasoned food , or effort that matches the price you pay."}
{"text":"My husband and I went for the first time to Over Easy.  Prices are \"average\" for breakfast, although I think anytime two people are paying $37.00 with a tip for breakfast which included two entrees, one small orange juice and one coffee something is wrong! I ordered my eggs medium and they were perfect.  Hash browns were brown on both sides, which in most restaurants you don't get.  They were nicely done.  Toast was cold when we received our meal, but we realize it can be hard to keep it warm unless things are served right away. Orange juice was nice, tasted fresh, but lots of pulp.  I like pulp, but for you non-pulp fans, you may want to order a different juice. Coffee was nothing special.  Smelled/tasted like a Folger's brand - typical in these types of establishments.   We like speciality coffees in the morning, but the coffee served is \"brew\" coffee. Service was prompt and friendly. We ate inside, but there is a patio for those of you who like to enjoy the weather. My husband got one of the omelette and it was good sized with the eggs just slightly brown on the outside (a good indication the ingredients they added to the omelette actually were hot/cooked).   Tables inside (not the booths) were kind of close together.  So, if you plan on going there to discuss business over breakfast, things cannot be kept confidential.      If we had a coupon from Groupon we would probably go again.  But for $37.00 I can purchase quite a few breakfast groceries!"}
{"text":"Came in again for my last morning in Phoenix, only this time I had the foresight to ask my server what Guy Fieri was served here. I ordered the ham steak and it was excellent. The red eye gravy was perfectly sweet and savory, the eggs on top were cooked and seasoned extremely well and the hash browns were perfect. I highly recommend this dish and this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Absolutely hands down my favorite breakfast joint. Tried the thanksgiving waffle this morning and loved it !! Yum"}
{"text":"Very good food! Our server Keith was very nice and attentive. My only complaint is that we asked for medium cooked eggs and they were a little under cooked, but other than that it was very enjoyable. Clean and bright atmosphere."}
{"text":"this review is for service only the food I order was for someone else first thing they ask me when I walk up to the counter was what do you want to order a menu I guess then tried to asked questions about what they have or what is good no real answer but when it's to go I guess they think there not getting g a tip so way try for me I won't go back to even try the food"}
{"text":"AMAZING breakfast, I would eat here every morning.  Everything was delicious, and we tried 4 different breakfast dishes.  Service was superb, and the ambiance of the restaurant was nice.  Would recommend, would eat here again (every day)."}
{"text":"Clean, perky, happy and inviting decor.  Food was great with a straight forward simple menu.  I enjoyed the chicken fried steak due to the recommendations of our server and it was filling and delicious!  Their coffee is great although we had to keep asking for refills, hence the 4 stars, and they were not very busy otherwise I would cut some slack.  They were friendly enough when they came to table and didn't appear put out by us asking for the refills.  They have a small deposit of liquor and beer on hand for those who wish to have it. They have iced coffee on tap! We didn't sample but next time we must!  I will definitely be back to dig into the rest of the menu...if Guy Fieri gave it his thumbs up....it's worth a try!"}
{"text":"OVERY EASY ON 40TH ST. MOVED THIS WEEKEND 10-3-10 New location isn't listed on the site yet. It moved to the Safeway Center across from Arcadia High. Google Arcadia High & cross the street you silly bean (I'm crossing everything that they kept the kitchen open with a bar area). I like to watch them cook what can I say? It's my personal little Food Network in AZ.  I only have time 1 day a week unfortunately for breakfast that's something better then the usual cereal slop. So on Sunday I make up for it with my pilgramage to Over Easy. My mouthwatering as I'm mentally perusing the menu driving across towns... yes I said I drive towns to get to Over Easy get over it. My mind turns to my beloved buddies the blueberry pancakes. Always pefection. Not mushy & always fluffy with a dust of powdered sugar.  Simple pleasures is what lifes all about with these heavenly delights. When I'm being a good girl I love the egg whites & asparagus omlette it's delish. They don't taste healthy they taste awesome. My heart belongs to the carmelized banana & pecan brioche french toast. It is just to die for. Man I'm killing myself. How am I gonna make it to next Sunday now? On to the next one & certainly not the least. The Waffle dogs. They really do it for me. It's as decadent as it gets. It's sausage on a stick dipped in a waffle batter & fried. Oh yeah I said fried. It's the ultimate sweet & salty.  I've heard rumors that the wolfpack is the best & I don't deny it but I just can't get past my faves to delve into the pack. Someday I will mark my words just not today or Sunday because now I'm thinking waffle dogs.  I wish my review didn't sound so mushy but I can't help myself. Over Easy is just great. Go try it for yourself you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Although they are busy I am still trying to figure out why. The food was mediocre at best and the servers were forgetful. Ordered a omelet that tasted like nothing but it went well with the toast that tasted like it was toasted the day before. The hash browns didn't taste fresh either.They get two stars because at least the omelet was edible."}
{"text":"I really like the eggs benedict so I haven't ordered anything else here - but the menu has lots of variation. The hollandaise sauce is very tasty and slightly different. I also enjoy the breakfast cocktail selection and appreciate the creativity beyond the traditional (and delicious) mimosa!   I had a HORRIBLE experience at the Phoenix location where I actually walked out, but I have been to the Gilbert location several times. I will only go to this spot."}
{"text":"WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!  Let me get this straight, I LOVE the Gilbert location. The Phoenix experience was hands down the worst of my life. I never made it into the restaurant to eat because the hostess was SO rude. I actually told her \"I feel like I am inconveniencing you - should I take my business elsewhere?\" she replied \"look around, it is packed, we don't need your business\". I explained that I brought a group of friends (6 total) to the restaurant because I love the Gilbert place so much - the food is great and service spectacular. She told me that \"everyone complains about the Gilbert location and says they are snotty, so you much be lying\". We went to the Vig instead.  I called the Gilbert location to inform them an employee was bad mouthing them. I left my number as well but never heard back."}
{"text":"What was Guy Fieri smoking? This place is beyond average.  We went to Over Easy because it was the near our hotel and usually when Triple D visits a place it's more often than not good. We walked in the door and sat straight down. Good start. The waitress was friendly and refilled our coffee 3 times throughout the meal. Another plus.  When I eat out for breakfast it's got to be blueberry waffles. To my dismay it was not on the menu. I requested it from the waitress and she said it would be no problem. 15 minutes later she returns and tells me, \"the Chef says he can't do it\". I wasn't even given a reason why not and offered blueberries on the side which I agreed to. When I get my plate, I get a singular waffle about 4 inches in length with raw blueberries on the side. The waffle was bland even with the packaged butter and syrup provided.   On the side I also had some tater-tots which were about an inch in size and were pretty crispy. I would get the tots again.  Upon getting the bill, my waffle with blueberries on the side was $9.50 plus tax. Was it worth $9.50? You already know the answer.  On the flip side, my brother ordered the \"2 Egg breakfast\".  He got a full plate of food with hash browns, eggs, toast and bacon for only $7.50. He gave me some to compensate for my own lack of food and it was not bad, but not great either.  Location = B; it's far from the Phoenix metro and is really far north of Scottsdale. Service = A for the waitress; C for the cook Taste = C ; a step better than a Denny's or IHOP  Conclusion:::::   If you can't find anywhere better for breakfast in Scottsdale, make sure you don't order the waffles. I think most would be OK with the portion of the other platters."}
{"text":"Don't be in a hurry. We're at 45 minutes waiting on an egg. Not even sure how it tastes!"}
{"text":"A good weekend breakfast can make or break my day so I'm happy that we weren't disappointed when we chose Over Easy as our Brunch Day spot a few weekends ago. Like any good yelper, I did my research and read the mixed reviews as well as OE's claim to fame via Guy Fieri's Food Network visit. And, again, like any good yelper, I decided to give it a try with an open mind - not expecting too much or too little - just a new experience that we hope we would end up enjoying.  And enjoy we did. We had a late start that morning since guests were in town so we made it there about 12:30ish - kind of late for brunch, I know, but brekky food is good at any time of day so who cares, right? We did have to wait about 20 minutes because the place was busy and on the smaller side. No big deal because there is ample seating outdoors to wait and the hostess cheerfully checked on us twice to let us know how much longer it would be.   Once seated we quickly perused the easy to read menu and made our choices. Our table of four was able to test the Chilaquiles, Chicken & Waffles, an omelet plate and, of course, the Food Network famous Waffle Dogs. If our amazingly cleaned off plates weren't a giveaway that the food was good then I don't know what else to say. Our only disappointment was that our server forgot to place our order for the Waffle Dogs which our table had hoped to share as our appetizer. We were able to remind him and they immediately cooked them up for us but by then we had already finished our meals so we had them pack the waffle dogs into a container to go. We enjoyed them at home a few hours later and they were delicious - I can only imagine how great they would have been nice and fresh!  Fun food, cute decor and a nice location with ample parking makes OE a good go to choice for any future Brunch Days."}
{"text":"They have Loco Moco on the menu here so I needed to try it.  Not bad and the white rice was good, not instant.  I didn't care for the crispy onion topping because I prefer traditional Loco Moco but it was still delicious!  The staff was super friendly and attentive.  We didn't wait long for anything.  We will definitely revisit.  Just one thing, I think the table we sat at was wiped down with a moldy rag.  It had a slight odor.  Other than that, everything was good."}
{"text":"I had no idea that Over Easy was hyped up from the Food Network before I came here to meet up with a friend from Uruguay that I hadn't seen in 3 years.  He had warned me that there might not be any seating when I arrive, but for a Monday brunch, there were tons of available seating.  The service was excellent, and we were checked on 3 times!  I think once was by the chef or owner.  I ordered the Brioche French Toast for $6, which was light, fluffy and not overly sweet.  The presentation could use some work, but it all went down great.  The coffee was just okay.  The okay coffee is overpriced at $2.25, and I regret not trying the Over Easy Ice (\"cold brewed coffee with cinnamon & cardamom, mixed with sweetened condensed milk & mint\").  I wasn't reading the menu too carefully because I was too busy practicing my Spanish with my friend.  I like that the serving sizes are not disgustingly huge and the prices reflect that appropriately.  I also appreciate that a half order of the French toast is an option for mixing and matching entrees."}
{"text":"Big fan of the Over Easy. Been eating here before DDD came & they were still in the old Taco Bell location with very little parking & cramped quarters. Now no matter where in the valley you live (minus the west side, hint hint) you can have waffle dogs, the overy easy, blueberry (hub cap sized) pancakes etc etc etc. So if you haven't tried Over Easy get over there. You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"if you want a breakfast place that is delicious and great for the family, great for.a nice.morning date or a great place for a recovery after a long night out this is the place to go...it used to be at 40th st and indian school but now its at indian school and 48th...they have delicious chicken and biscuits and gravy...its filling.and truly sticks to your stomach lol...it will leave u satisfied and so happy haha...you dont have to have something.super heavy like that you can have their malted waffle or french toast and i am.sure they even have very healthy options too...i just knw when i want a good satisfying breakfast i want comfort food and i am not worried qbout calories lol...but i cant eat eat it very often...to bad...this place is fun and a great place for the neighborhood..."}
{"text":"I like the staff here.  They are always nice and accommodating.  You never have to wait long even though the place is kind of small.  However, the menu is just weird.  I can never find what I am looking for on it so I prefer to go somewhere else instead.  I think this could be an awesome place if they updated their menu and got acquainted with what customers are expecting."}
{"text":"I don't just give out stars for the fun of it. This place has earned all 5. It's not easy to find cause it's in a complex off Bell Road, and because there's a fitness center and an ice hockey rink here also it's not always easy to find a place to park, but once you get here you'll see that it's totally worth it!   All fresh and natural ingredients, gluten free is available, and there's even a healthy menu hidden among the unhealthy deliciousness.   Did I mention that it's been on Guy's Diners, Drive-ins & Dives?"}
{"text":"Nice, unexpected flavors on some breakfast favorites. Generous pour on breakfast-appropriate cocktails. Service is usually fast and good."}
{"text":"Energetic breakfast joint. Their weekend brunch boozy specials are top notch. $8 for mimosas and bloody marys. A penny for a refill. They are generous with those too. They taste great to boot! The avocado toast is perfect for a light breakfast. Nibbled on the boyfriends chicken and waffles. The batter for the chicken is seasoned well. They gave us hot sauce for the table so we could sauce crazy.   Second visit tried the chilaquiles. Huge portion. Enjoyed it as always, easy to please when it comes to chilaquiles.  My only request is the drink board be more accessible. The first time we visited we didn't know about any of the drink specials because we were tucked in the corner. Our server neglected to let us know. We'd happily spend more money on drinks if given the low down!"}
{"text":"So New Years Day and we didn't want to make our own bkfast... I saw this place a week or two ago and we're always on the lookout for bkfast places.  We are early birds.  Quick Note : They don't open till 6am.  Once we got there and ordered I was shocked at the sizes!  Well worth the price.  DH got an omelet (pictured) and ended up taking half of it, the hash and the toast home for lunch.  I got 2 eggs..I'm not really the exciting bkfast person but love some scrambled eggs.  I was thrilled with this place.  Its close and good with options for everyone and a cute ambiance."}
{"text":"A little disappointing serve slow and food just ok. Been wanting to eat here for a while since seeing it on triple D."}
{"text":"EWWWWW!!!!! Over Easy is absolutely disgusting.  Thinking about the food right now makes me want to puke.  I was in a party of 2 and the nasty food took about 30 minutes to come out.  The toast was your basic supermarket brand white bread and it was old and stale.  The omelet was a JOKE! It was burnt on the outside and under cooked in the middle.  I am not kidding that this was the worst omelet I have ever tasted.  The M&M pancakes were disgusting also.  I thought that the M&M pancakes would have mini M&Ms cooked inside the pancake but I was wrong.  The M&Ms were just doused on top of less than satisfactory pancakes.  The drinks may have been the worst part.  The strawberry lemonade with rosemary was very bitter and the flavors did not compliment one another very well.  We also got the iced coffee that was tasteless.  I cannot believe that Guy from the Food Network put this place on his show.  I have been to three other restaurants endorsed on his show and they have all been fantastic.  If you are looking for a good place to eat breakfast in Phoenix Matt's Big Breakfast is definitely the place to go."}
{"text":"So I gave this place another try: worst decision ever. There was paper on my sausage like they didn't remove all of the wrapper and all the server did was get me more sausage. This wasn't the first time this has happened either. Since I've received paper on my sausage before means you don't need to make it right the second time? That's embarrassing."}
{"text":"Saw the dinner on a TV show, went to try it myself. Great breakfast fare. Special butter squash French toast was awesome."}
{"text":"Great food and original! It has gotten a bit trendy over the last few years which makes me sad but the food is still delicious! I loved them best before they moved venues!"}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast today with some friends. I had the corned beef hash with eggs and hash browns, the portion was generous and it was very good. Service was excellent and since it was such a nice day we ate out on the patio.  They have some really cool stuff on the menu and are famous for their waffle dogs, which is a cooked sausage link dipped in waffle batter and deep fried."}
{"text":"My husband and I are visiting from San Diego. We saw over easy on our fav food show. We are both in the service industry and feel that great service is just as important as great food. You work hard for the money your bringing in to spend but some how for some reason it seems over easy does not have service standards.  We are bummed because the food is great but bad service leaves bad taste. We got our food to go I called in for to go. The girl that answered was nice. My husband went to pick up. The hostess did say hi and welcome. She directed him to the bar to pick up our food there was a woman working behind the bar as he was walking up she looked at him grabbed a pitcher of water and began to walk around the restaurant ignoring him. after a couple minutes she walks up in knowledge is that he's there to pick up all of a sudden another man came out from the back and just handed him our food No, thank you no, is there anything else just our bill we felt they didn't want us there. he paid no words came out from the person who took his check.  when we got back to our hotel about 15 minutes away we start to open up our food and realize they left out the maple syrup that they pride themselves and making it just felt like over easy didn't care we ordered the chicken fried steak the Wolfpack in the waffle sausages that were on the Food Network show we were just surprised at the lack of care that went into our to go order I think we will avoid  this location and try a new one since you like the food!!! too bad"}
{"text":"Meh....  What Over Easy has going for it is that it's breakfast options are HUGE.  This was a good place for us to try because our brunch crew has someone who doesn't eat eggs at breakfast.  We need other options (otherwise it's always bread/carbs for her).  So it was on the table.  We went at 10:30 on a Saturday morning.  For a group of 4, no wait.  First impression good.  As we continue to sit, we grow uncomfortable with the fact that it's still morning and we're listening to heavy metal.  It's just not breakfast music to us.  Order drinks.  Drinks take a bit.  When they do arrive, one of the iced coffees is dripping and the waiter drips it all down my husband's arm.  I had attempted to draw the dripping glass to his attention before the drink/sleeve interaction but alas, iced coffee on the arm.  And no apology, just a bunch of napkins tossed onto the table.  Now there's some crabbiness.  We order our food.  We do a little table rearrangements because of the tv distraction for some.  I had the wolfpack which was decent.  Nothing amazing.  My eggs were a little on the hard side, not how I prefer them.  Husband had the hopple popple and wasn't enthused.  BIL had breakfast burrito and was pleased but didn't like the single pancake (quote: tastes like bisquick).  BIL's girlfriend had carmelized banana french toast and sourdough toast.  The french toast was rich and the sourdough burnt.  Iced coffee tasted extremely watered down.  I prefer the toddy at gallo blanco or what I make at home.  Hot coffee did not impress.  We probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Very pricey for the amount of food you get. The service is decent but I would prob not go back due to the price. Glad we tried it tho"}
{"text":"Was looking for a good breakfast spot that we hadn't tried yet and made out way to Over Easy. We actually didn't have to wait at all, but the place was pretty full. The menu is full of traditional breakfast items and some unique ones like the malt waffles and waffle dogs. I went with the Wolf Pack, which was 2 eggs, bacon, cheese and covered in hash browns. It was okay, i probably wouldn't order it again. The hashbrowns were soft and definitely needed more time on the griddle. We also split a malted waffle that was one of the best waffles I've ever had, awesome! Wifey had this omelet with feta, spinach and tomatoes that was also very very good. The service was good as well. I also had an Over Easy Iced Coffee that was brewed with cinnamon, cardimom (sp) and mint that I thoroughly enjoyed. Overall good breakfast experience, but I can't excuse the soft hash browns."}
{"text":"This place is great. We love the layout and how clean and inviting it so. Staff is super friendly. Food is excellent and the coffee is the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"A diner-feel with bright decor! Good, quick service and a great breakfast selection. I got Eggs Benedict with vegetables which was tasty and reasonably priced.  Would recommend!"}
{"text":"Had to try out this breakfast place featured on triple D quite a while ago.  One of us loves breakfast, the other would prefer to starve until lunch or brunch at the very least.  Another casual trip for us and hence Yelp review.     Lets just start out saying it was mixed as far as what was expected.  Food was across the board fantastic.  Absolutely no wait to get in.  We had hoped the day after Labor Day might be uncrowded.  Surprised to find many families with babies and absolutely no foodies.     Had the Home made Hash and eggs.  Eggs done as ordered, Hash very good.  Also had Ham steak- there seems to be a slight Hawaiian influence here.  Processed ham roll but done right with a mildly sweet sauce on top.  The Carmel Banana pecan French toast is a must, though I hate nuts on/in my sweats.  They could be easily left off, just ask.  Special Pumpkin French toast was good but really screams for a big ole scoop of vanilla ice cream on top.  I took an order home.  The razzcherry scone was tasty as scones go.      For Breakfast, I've got to admit that this place was excellent.  Anytime she wants to get up early to eat, I'll agree to this destination.  Just really glad there was not a 2 hour wait. Of coarse, then it would be lunch and I'd be somewhere else.  So win win I guess.      The over all gist of this place is a new generation hippie/environmental conscious foodie destination with mild Hawaiian overtones.  Surprised I found no Spam on the menu but I did say the Hawaiian influence is subtle.  If you come here don't just order eggs, bacon, toast and coffee and then say it was nothing special.  You will be commenting more on the diner than the restaurant.   $40 for all this plus two coffees.  Not bad at all.  My breakfast loving companion says, about average."}
{"text":"Good food....HORRIBLE Service!  Stopped in on a Saturday morning and it wasn't busy at all.  We sat outside where there were only two other tables that our waitress had to serve.  We ordered coffee, and she spilled it on me.  It was accident and I wasn't upset.  What made me upset was the fact that she walked away and didn't clean it up.  After completing our meal, we asked for the check and a to-go box.  She walked by us at least 3 or 4 times before finally giving us the check.  Where's the to-go box I asked?  \"Oh, sorry....I'll be right back.\"  By now she only had to serve our table and another one that had just gotten seated.  Only 2 tables and she couldn't keep up.  I recommend the food and if you want horrible service to go along with it, please ask for Victoria!!!"}
{"text":"Head over to Scrambled on SW corner instead. The inside is too yellow - throws you off. Arrived for early breakfast 8am with cloudy skies and potential rain - GORGEOUS DAY!! Greeted by the front the young gentleman was polite when we asked for outdoor seating. He rushed to get a rag to wipe the  sprinkled chairs and tables. Soon after a very rough looking man with sleeve tattoo comes in a very abrasive way - picking up our menus (no eye contact) saying outdoors was off limits per potential rain. In AZ......... Apple says it says at 10 we all know it may rain at 11-1 - if that. Very disrespectful and rude. I was excited to try this new place.... TRULY. But after the yellow and that man, never again. SCRAMBLED or FIRST WATCH are immediate alternatives.such a sour experience."}
{"text":"North Scottsdale doesn't have a large selection of breakfast places....so i have to travel down to \"the city\".  I am glad that I did.  Over Easy is Aaron May's 2nd restaurant here in the Valley...some of you may know his first in DC Ranch...Sol y Sombra.    You know the place is good, when it is packed and folks are waiting in the pouring rain for a seat!  The restaurant is not very big with half of the tables outdoors...under a tent with heaters (nice touch)  The food is great nice size portions and inexpensive!!  Coffee and fresh squeezed OJ completed this meal.  I recommend going, even if it is a ride from north Scottsdale.  It was well worth it."}
{"text":"The food on my visits has been very good.  The Eggs Benedict Florentine is great they cooked the eggs perfectly and the hollandaise was just right.  They also have very good hash-browns so I haven't tried their other options.  The first time I went they were pretty busy, but our server was great and kept our coffee filled the whole time.  The second time we went our server spent more time chatting with some one sitting at the bar than refilling our coffee which was unfortunate.  The other complaint I have is the sun shades on the windows are very dirty and covered in dried food. So I would avoid sitting at the widow facing tables if you can.  The rest of the resturant seemed fine if they do something about the shades."}
{"text":"I tried Over Easy for the first time a few years ago at their old location and wasn't impressed. However, when I returned this week to their new spot on Indian School I was pleasantly surprised.   I had read recommendations about their waffle dogs (their breakfast take on corn dogs) and was definitely happy with the choice I made. My server cocktailed maple syrup and cholula for them and while it sounds odd, was actually a great compliment with my dish. My family also ordered the Dolly and Selena and were satisfied with their meals.  The staff was attentive (but not overbearing), and you can seat yourself."}
{"text":"Came here for wedding hangover breakfast. We got there around 11am and only had to wait a few minutes for a table. The restaurant is really cute and bright inside, there is also patio seating. The server was very attentive and food came out quick. A few menu items were featured on diners, drive ins and dives but I just got a simple 2 egg breakfast. My toast was burned but everything else was good!"}
{"text":"Over priced blah food, terrible service. Son took us there for our anniversary breakfast. Server was not \"present\", never refilled waters or coffee. Breakfast choice had been cooked then microwaved for some reason, making it dry and unappetizing. Won't return."}
{"text":"Tried to Visit this establishment. Was a 5 to ten minute wait. No problem. Grabbed a iced coffee, it is 100 degrees outside. Grabbed a paper - sitting outside waiting. First impression. Greater tells me to drink up or throw away the iced coffee. Seriously. I bought this to survive waiting on your Resturant. The server says owner policy.   It's two sips off a iced coffee, but what a crazy rule. So I ask to speak to the owner, literally seated yards away - \"he's in a meeting\", so they go get the manager. Still have not stepped foot in the Resturant. Still outside. Lovely Arizona hospitality!!! No manager arrives. Eventually I give up.   Go down to the right and visit The Black Cat Coffee house. What a difference. I have my food in front of me, the staff are great. I got in first try. Avoid the over easy. Stick to black cat"}
{"text":"I do NOT get it!!!!  Breakfast is \"our thing\". We go out to breakfast pretty much EVERY weekend since we have a toddler, don't have access to a babysitter and don't get to go out to night-time, kid-unfriendly places. So again... I don't get it! We've tried to like this place. Went back a couple times thinking maybe it was a fluke, that we were just there on an off-day or something. And each time we go back, we're mad that we wasted our time waiting in their long line and that we spent our money on this sub-par food. I think if you're a breakfast place, you should at least do homemade potatoes... I'm pretty sure they use Ore-Ida's. One good thing I can say is that whoever wrote their menu did a good job of making things sound good and building them up, unfortunately though the food just doesn't cut it. I'd say skip it to anybody thinking of coming here! (BTW... BLEW MY MIND that Food Network Mag. called this the best breakfast in AZ!!! OK... who's paying off who at Food Network Mag?!?!)"}
{"text":"After reading some of the reviews on Yelp we decided to try Over Easy this morning. It had a wonderful casual and friendly vibe and we decided to sit at the counter instead of waiting 30 minutes for the busy waiting list. The server at the counter (and I'm pretty sure he was one of the managers) was extremely friendly and offered suggestions on what to try since it was our first time. Their menu is really nice and has healthier options like egg whites for most of their items. They even threw in a complimentary cheddar jalapeno biscuits for us to try since it was our first time there. It was so great we can't wait to be back with our kids because I know that they would love the waffle dogs and the delicious French toast. they even have tater tots and sweet potato tater tots! The clientele is also super nice we ended up meeting a really nice couple seated next to us &exchanged phone numbers. it was just an overall wonderful experience"}
{"text":"The food was good. I didn't get quite what I ordered, but that worked out ok. The service, however, was extremely slow an inattentive. We waited quite some time to get our drink order taken and then several more minutes to get our food order in. During this entire time we we passed by several servers. One paused a moment to say she would be right with us and then never returned. We were finally waited on by a gentlemen that had an attitude like we were bothering him by being there.  We had also asked for some additional butter and that request was promptly forgotten.   As I said the food was really good but it will be a while before I go back due to the poor quality of the service."}
{"text":"Extremely cold sitting in front of door. Server was OK not real friendly. $2.75 for a cup of coffee that is served with milk poured out of a gallon jug in front of you couldn't serve a half and half creamer. Food ok at best very bland gravy hardly any flavor. You don't get toast with a $12 country fried steak breakfast or potatoes with hash and eggs. $31.00 breakfast for 2 -2 coffees and 2 entrees is definitely not worth going back to."}
{"text":"The food was good, the vibe was also good.  ** Except there was a very unfriendly older lady taking my order. She seemed a bit annoyed and was just not pleasant nor warm. *** However, I will give it a second try at their Frank Lloyd Wright Location soon!!!.  Hopefully they'll be a bit more friendly there!!! I've heard wonderful things about this restaurant from co-workers, so I wouldn't want to give up just because I had a not-so delightful first impression.  :)"}
{"text":"Saw this restaurant when I dropped my daughter off at her first Spanish class, last week.  Decided to come here for beaky during her 2nd Spanish class this week. \"Helllllo\"  If the food is as good as their cocktails....I'll be hooked!  Ordered the 'Le Triomphe' if you like grapefruit and champagne, you will love this twist on the mimosa!  Food came while I was typing (I ordered Gary's Spinach Loaf).  Looks good!   I don't remember the last time I ate eggs without ketchup or salsa or chalula... But today I did.  The condiments are sitting here, but this tastes so good on it's own.  Well almost on its own...ordered the Mary's en Fuego (subbed Clamato for the Bloody Mary mix-it's a Canadian thing. What can I say? Other than the jalapeño infused vodka is bloody brilliant!).  They are delicious together.  Get your eggs on down here, you won't be disappointed,  4 stars would have been 5 but their hash-browns were plain Jane Denny's type (no offense Denny's or Over Easy) just expected Over Easy tonRock them out somehow.  See you next week!"}
{"text":"So I'm afraid this story will constitute my first one-star review. I remember, starting out as a reviewer on Yelp, telling myself that I would never give anyone a one-star review. But unfortunately in this case, I believe the rating to be well-earned, and for a number of relatively objective reasons at that.  :-/  To be honest, I was optimistic upon entering Over Easy because I grew up in New Jersey and was immediately drawn to the old diner style layout of the place. Felt like breakfast in NJ circa early 90's. Not only that, but it is very close to where I work, so it seemed ideal.  I was greeted upon entering and told to find a seat anywhere. The restaurant was completely empty except for two other patrons, so naturally I chose a booth. The first booth I turned to had coffee spilled on it and the remnant pool of a sweaty glass of water.  Not a big deal. I turned to found a clean table instead. Once seated, I began to peruse the menu. I liked the range of options available, but what I didn't appreciate were the prices. VERY few items on the menu under $10. Even my lemonade cost just shy of $4.  The waitress who took my order was kind enough, albeit obviously uninvolved, perhaps distracted. I would describe her service as mediocre, at best. Unfortunately.  Finally, my pancakes arrived. I say \"finally\", but it wasn't THAT long of a wait. After my first bite, I thought that Over Easy had redeemed itself. It really was a very flavorful blueberry pancake. (It better have been for $8.50!)  Sadly, the story doesn't end with the first bite... I soon found out that the pancake had not been cooked through. When I got to the center of the pancake, the batter was still soupy so I couldn't eat any more. And that about id it for me. Asked for my check, then left.  As you can see, nothing \"horrible\" happened to me during my visit to Over Easy. This isn't some subjective experience whereby I am harassed by an overwhelmed employee or have coffee spilled down my shirt. The overall experience itself was just poor.  Between the low quality of service, low attention to details of cleanliness, low quality of food (really?!), and sky-high prices, I can't see myself ever returning. Sorry Over Easy - you just didn't do it for me.  :("}
{"text":"Great place! I had a  1/2 Order Caramelized banana & pecan French toast which was fabulous and my husband had the Crying Pig. Everything was served hot and tasty. This place is great."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday afternoon around 1pmish and didn't realize they close at 2p. We managed to get a table but had to wait for about 20 minutes or so.  My girlfriend and I ordered a lot of food to try different things. Everyone said to order the waffle dogs so we did. I ordered a breakfast sandwich and my friend ordered the brioche french toast.   We could tell our waiter was in a bad mood so we made it our goal to put a smile on his face. After being nice to him, we managed to get him to smile and service was much better afterwards.  The coffee was just OK nothing spectacular. The best thing I ordered was the SWEET POTATO TOTS."}
{"text":"Oh. My. Lord. This is one of the best breakfast places I've ever eaten. The diner is bright and cheery, our waitress Chelsea was dynamite, and the food was incredible! Lots of interesting choices, and all looked so good it was hard to choose.  I had chicken and waffles for the first time in my life, and it was sooooo good! The waffle was malty, the boneless chicken was fried crispy and succulent. The real maple syrup had a touch of hot sauce in it and bound the whole thing together. We got a side of the jalapeno-infused biscuits and gravy, and I almost need a moment of silence before proceeding. It was lights out good. If I lived in Phoenix, I would be here 3 times a week!"}
{"text":"Visited 8/18/13.  I ordered the Wolfpack. Took a suggestion from another reviewer and added gravy on top. The meal was perfect for what I was looking for.   We were seated immediately. Had drinks filled immediately. And waiter was good about refilling coffee.   I will admit that this place is a little pricey!! But it was a nice change from the chain restaurants for breakfast.   It will be a consideration for breakfast next time around."}
{"text":"The service is terrible.  I would give it 4 stars if the food was consistant but it varies from visit to visit.  I have been maybe 12 times and sometimes the food is great and other I order the same thing and it's just ok.  Out of 12 visits the service has only been good once.  When the hostess is there on Sundays it's even worse.  She makes you wait when you arrive even though there are tables available.  She is never at the door when you come in and there is no urgency to seat you.  They have a great outdoor patio but I don't think they ever clean the ground.  It is definatly worth trying because when the food is good it is really good!"}
{"text":"I frequent this location often and have always had a consistent experience.  The food is great and the service is awesome.  Daniela and Jeff are always quick to make me feel welcome.  They have turned me into a life long customer.  I have brought most my family and friends as well; highly recommend Over Easy on Warner for a great breakfast in a friendly environment. Personal favorite when being healthy: fit chicken! Steak and eggs is my other go to dish."}
{"text":"Forty minute wait.  Cold food for my wife. Over cooked eggs for my eggs Benedict.  Lots of choices in MMR now.  Over Easy I'm so over you."}
{"text":"I love the food here. We are now regulars and always ask for Daniela. The restaurant is always clean and their food is not like your regular breakfast diners.   I ordered the Wolf pack every time I go. I love hash browns so if you enjoys potatoes order this plate. It's hash browns with eggs, cheese, and bacon with a layer of hash browns on top.   My kids love the pancakes there. They are very cakey and taste so good.   I would recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Service was good. Food was nothing special. Prices were too much for what I got. I think Ill stick to The Farmhouse in downtown Gilbert."}
{"text":"Meh. I got the chicken fried chicken with waffle. The chicken was totally soggy from being fried. To make matters worse they put butter on top of my chicken. Dude what the heck? I should have read the reviews first, dammit! The waffle was plain, they coulda threw some cinnamon or vanilla in there. Service was cordial, but my waitress bought my check when i was half done with my food. I only ordered water because clearly their orange juice is made for the Queen of England at $6 a glass. I wasn't wowed by this place, what's all the hype? You can catch me at Denny's down the street from now on!"}
{"text":"It is hard to screw up breakfast....and they don't...but they get three stars for lack of originality.  I , a very mediocre cook, can make most of what they can in my kitchen and pay a heck of a lot less for it.  Yes, the quantities are enormous (split your plate with a friend and you both will need wheel-barrels to get out of the place).  Cholesterol watchers....keep driving.  The food is so smothered in grease, you stay full for four hours after a visit.  We sat outside, nice...a bit hot and they weren't sportin the misters.  It will be nice in the next few months.  It is busy busy busy but they get you in and out in a hurry and we didn't wait more than five minutes for a table.  Maybe it's just me...I'm too gourmet...and picky about my Saturday brunches.  I had better waffles at Lo Los and will make the drive there next time I crave one.  This place is two minutes away, but I probably won't be going back."}
{"text":"Lovely looking outdoor patio but terrible service and food. We, the only customers waiting, stood for five minutes while waiters poured coffee and finally seated us. The wild mushrooms and eggs were gelatinous and not very wild. Eggs were cold, home fries barely browned. My entire plate was left uneaten and the waiter seemed oblivious. When I asked about the mushrooms she said other people liked them and the gelatinous goo was au jus. Very expensive inedible breakfast. I'd try someplace else."}
{"text":"Place is not fancy, just a nice quaint cafe. Spectacular views on the outside patio.  Huge portions and the food is absolutely delicious. Highly recommend coming here.  The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 was the service. It was just adequate. Server had zero personality, didn't engage in any sort of conversation, didn't welcome us in...etc. she's just an order taker.  However, the food was that good that we will be back."}
{"text":"Can you say Chilaquiles? Dont worry, you dont need to. Just point to the menu and order it. Thank me later! Best god damn breakfast I've had in years. Well done, over easy. Well done!"}
{"text":"Always look forward to breakfast at the Over Easy, very good menu reasonably priced. The service is excellent, Daniela always greets us with a nice warm friendly  smile and does an excellent job with her great  service. She's definitely a plus for this restaurant. Will be back again soon as its now one of our favorites."}
{"text":"Workers were friendly but forgot to bring the coffee drink my husband ordered. Also I should have listened to the more recent reviews people had about the food. The potatoes were not crispy and overall food was disappointing. My husband got a side of sausage and they looks a bit under done in the middle. The French toast with banana was pretty good but definitely will not be returning."}
{"text":"My wife and I took a trip from the mid west to California, and decided to stop at several restaurants featured on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives.  Of the four we visited, two were ok (nothing special) one was bad and one (Over Easy) was absolutely horrible.  We ordered pancakes and a side of crispy bacon - we got overcooked, hard as a rock pancakes and undercooked bacon.  How can you screw up pancakes and bacon?  McDonalds has better food.  Heck I can cook better than that. And we haven't even talked about the unfriendly service.   All told, we have been to six restaurants featured on triple-D and the best only rate three stars and most are one or two stars.  Our new motto: If Guy Fieri recommends it - avoid it."}
{"text":"WOW  WINNING, Best chicken fried steak ever! Ditto hash browns, golden perfect brown. French brioche  toast, caramelized bananas & pecans. Delicious. Awesome view of McDowell Mountains!  Fun Chalkboard with cute/cool sketches depicting breakfast goodness."}
{"text":"I don't understand how anyone could leave a bad review. This is going to be our new breakfast hangout. Rachel our server was very friendly. We had the waffle dog , French toast, and the Wolfpack. All three were delish, we will definitely be back. If your a piece picky eater like me this is your place."}
{"text":"This is a great breakfast spot with a diverse menu. I usually get the chilaquiles but tried the Wolf Pack during my last visit and ate every bite. The only reason I'm not giving them 5 stars is because the bar stools have GOT TO GO.  There is no place to put your feet, so you are dangling your legs from a round, puffy stool, making it impossible to sit and eat comfortably. I awkwardly spilled food on my lap twice because of it. Even if they kept the stools but added spots on the bar wall to rest your feet, that would be a huge improvement."}
{"text":"The food is always top notch and they aren't afraid to make your Bloody Mary spicy when you ask for it. A must after a rowdy Friday night."}
{"text":"Love this place! My recommendation would be to get the wolf pack! Only complaint is the wait... But I guess you can expect that from a place that taste this great! Customer service was fairly neutral ."}
{"text":"My first impression is very fair, the prices are high for a micro strip mall  breakfast eatery. 5 dollars for OJ SMH just a rip off. And the wait staff was another ridiculous set of problems. The guy there with the Thick jersey accent was very nice other than him bringing me bacon and a cup of grease....I just wanted the bacon....they was another server there barely dressed for the gym just ridiculous, if I wanted that scence I would have just went to the Tilted Kilt Pub & Eatery."}
{"text":"I've been to Over Easy several times.  It's been my go-to breakfast spot when I'm in the Phoenix area (I'm not a huge fan of Matt's, even without the wait).    However, this visit was disappointing.  I keep trying different items on the menu.  This time it was their chicken and waffles.  The waffle was okay, though more dense than I like.  The chicken was the issue.  It was dry, tough, and stringy.  There could be several reasons for this, and the solution is simple.  But it says they're not paying attention."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic and horrible all at the same time! They really need some leadership at the restaurant and training in customer service. But my steak and eggs for the price were absolutely fabulous! And the server was very nice once he figured out our table was his section. The hostess also have no clue what they are doing and there were parties not seated and wait times miss quoted etc. Both my boyfriends meal and mine were really great however. We will be back with low expectations for the service and high expectations for the food! Hopefully it was just a really bad day!"}
{"text":"Finding really good breakfast spots in Phoenix is a challenge. I had high hopes for Over Easy so I started out with my favorite breakfast dish--an omelette. If you can't make a good omelette at a breakfast spot, then you probably shouldn't list your restaurant as  a breakfast place. Any hoo, my Crying Pig Omelette was burnt. Hate that. It tasted good though. Hash browns were good. Next time I will try something other than an egg dish. I believe in giving most places a second chance. One more thing; my waiter couldn't count change. I had to let him know he owed me more money back."}
{"text":"I think my girlfriend and I came here with too high of expectations.  She saw it featured on The Food Network, so we drove out to give it a try.  We were pleasantly surprised there wasn't a wait, but immediately started to regret not waiting for a table on the patio, since the inside dining room was filled with screaming kids (one of which was laying on the floor until his Mom forced him back in his seat).  I tried one of their signature dishes - The Wolfpack.  It was different and very filling, but not amazing.  My girlfriend got the Over Easy which she wasn't impressed with either.  I think we'll stick to the amazing brunch spots in Old Town."}
{"text":"I have made this my weekend go-to breakfast spot!  It is by far the best breakfast food in the Phoenix Metropolitan area.  The service is typically very friendly and the hostesses are always super sweet.  The cheery color scheme is wonderful to wake up to in the morning when enjoying a delicious breakfast.  The food:  OMG!  The eggs benedict are the best I've ever eaten from the quality of the English muffin to the perfect poached egg, nice slab of ham and over-the-moon tasty hollandaise sauce.  The pancake dogs (?) are spectacular and come with real maple syrup.  The chicken and waffles are fantastic with the juiciest piece of breast meat I've ever tasted.  Oh and the jalapeno biscuits and gravy?  Where do I begin?  I don't usually order biscuits and gravy at restaurants because they are often very disappointing and I have a very discriminating palate when it comes to my B & G.  I've never had better anywhere in my entire life and that includes diners in the Midwest and deep South.  The iced coffee with the cinnamon and cardamom seed and sweetened condensed milk is to die for...be careful though...it packs a caffeinated punch for sure.  My only criticism is that the hash browns rarely come out warm and fresh, but then again I'm not there for the hash browns.  If not for the hash browns, I would have given this place 5 stars:)"}
{"text":"Recently we came back here after not coming in for a while.. they added a few things to their menu and I had a delicious avocado eggs Benedict...gluten free! It is so yummy! I'm posting a pic...and I always add bacon because they have amazing bacon! The only thing I don't like is the price... It costs me like $14.00 for this meal with the bacon... Little more than like to spend on breakfast! My husband had the same and our son had kids Reece's pieces pancakes with a small side of hash browns (no drinks) and it was over $40..."}
{"text":"I went here on a whim with my mother and infant son. We get breakfast together every week and wanted to try something new. I thought it was delicious. The kids meal I bought my son was gigantic, so he had tons of leftover and we definitely got our money's worth. I ordered orange juice and immediately noticed that it wasn't the normal from concentrate juice I have come to expect, it was fresh squeezed juice! Super yummy. Everything was well cooked and delicious. The waitresses were very friendly, although our waitress was a tiny bit slow to for my taste. They were very good with my son and made sure that our meal was to our satisfaction."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! Favorite dishes are the eggs benedict (several kinds on the menu - all yummy!) pancakes, and the breakfast sandwiches. Do expect a long wait on weekend mornings, but that's to be expected of a good breakfast restaurant."}
{"text":"Two days in a row!! Two!! Good service, nice decor, excellent food, FREAKING AMAZING Bloody Mary's....I've found a new breakfast spot in Gilbert!!  Our first visit was a day date for the hubs and I. He had been wanting to check this place out but thought the only one that existed was in Arcadia. I mentioned I had driven by the one on Warner and since we had other plans in Tempe that day, we decided to check it out. We arrived around 9:30am on a Friday and were promptly seated. During our time there, an hour or so, it really filled up.  I ordered the chiliquilles. I asked our server what he recommended between those and the corned beef hash. The serving was large and I filed up quickly. The chips stayed crunchy through the whole meal...nothing worse than soggy chips. Blech!   Not wanting to get loaded first thing in the morning (and therefore sleepy), we chose to split a Mary's en Fuego. Jalapeno vodka, Bloody Mary mix, bacon bits, Old Bay rim. YUM! It was spicy and so, so good. Highly recommended.  On the next visit we brought the kids.  They loved their pancakes. This time I went with the corned beef hash. Meh. Small portion and not a lot of flavor. The chiliquilles is where it's at. Oh...and another Bloody Mary."}
{"text":"Tried Over Easy today and thought that for a Saturday morning I would have to wait to get in. I did have to wait but was only 15 minutes.  We we seated while the table was still being cleaned. The rag left the table wet and smelling of bleach. Oh yeah- and our nicely laminated menus were also stuck to the table as well. Nice start to Saturday morning breakfast.  While there was a nice crowd, it was not too loud. I looked over the menu and there wasn't anything that stood out to me except the Over Easy Iced Coffee with cinnamon, cardamon, mint and condensed milk. Sounds great. Too long of title to order. Tastes like watered down burnt Denny's coffee. So much for that.  We ordered: housemade corned beef hash + eggs, chicken fried steak + eggs and stack of their pancakes.  The hash tasted like dog food. The pancakes were dry and might as well be advertised as day-old bread. I was thoroughly disappointed.   Oh yeah and the one thing that kinda teed me off was that I asked the server about availability of their cinnamon rolls. She said she would check. It wasn't until I was walking out and saw a couple eating it did I realize that she never got back to me. Oh well.   Trendy and sounds cool but I had better at Denny's."}
{"text":"Seating a little tight and the staff took themselves a little too seriously, but a good breakfast for a decent price. The hubs and I stopped in to get away from hotel food. Was worth the short drive and I'd recommend it, just don't expect THE best breakfast you've ever had and you'll be happy."}
{"text":"Went here on a promo, so I was a bit skeptical.  This food is awesome.  It's a great take on breakfast but what makes it different is how goooood the food is.  I had the chicken fried steak and eggs and it was perfect and delicious.  Better than I have had anywhere else.    I went with a coffee snob and he enjoyed their regular coffee, which was also an added bonus.   Service is excellent, you will never be in need of anything.    The place is tiny, tiny, so expect a wait.  That's the major draw back."}
{"text":"Always great! Try the chicken fried steak! Yeeaahhhh!!!! Nice people, great service, consistently good food, what else do you need for a breakfast spot?"}
{"text":"Amazing food, with a great staff, makes this my favorite breakfast spot. My favorite is brioche french toast with caramelized bananas and pecans. Selena is great if you're looking for a breakfast burrito."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that our apologetic waitress but the only redeeming part of our visit.  We arrived to the restaurant and were pleasantly surprised to see that we did not have a wait seeing as it was a Sunday morning.  We waited over 45 minutes for our food to arrive and finally had to ask our waitress to have them make it to go as we had an appointment.  15 minutes later they finally brought it out.  In the end we paid $30 for and omelet and eggs Benedict that were less than mediocre.  Taking into account that it probably would have been better if we had time to eat right after it was made still would not have changed the fact that the potatoes were burnt, there was maybe a teaspoon of hollandaise between both and the omelet was tiny."}
{"text":"With the addition of Over Easy last week, 40th Street in Arcadia is becoming more and more of a hip restaurant row. Retro chairs [see photo] and space-age stools dot the interior of the cozy joint owned by Sol y Sombra chef Aaron May.  The place, which is next door to The Vig, recalls a Matt's Big Breakfast feel (and was so alluded in Java magazine) for this side of town and manages to do so in an old 1970s mission style Taco Bell.   I wouldn't have been able to tell if I didn't know. Regardless, the food here is delicious and compared to other places I did not feel like I ingested a tub of butter. I ordered the hearty Wolf Pack with a pancake on the side and I was in heaven.   Two (count them, TWO!)  layers of hash browns [see photo] with two scrambled eggs, cheddar cheese and strips of bacon in the middle. The eggs were just the right consistency and hash browns were browned just right and tasted terrific with garlic salt and pepper. A fluffy griddled pancake with syrup on the side, fresh squeezed orange juice and a complimentary New York Times at the counter also greeted my morning grumpiness and I was quickly satiated.  Altogether the meal came out to $12 + tax.  A bit pricey, but worth it knowing you get what you pay for.  I briefly talked with the chef's managing partner who went into detail about the tater tots with tomato jam (that I missed on the menu) and the bacon reduction sauce that comes with the brioche.  My only complaints would be minor.  Small quarters: With about half of the seats outside on the patio, it's probably a few seats more than MBB.  There was brisk business yesterday on a weekday morning, but on the weekend I can see how the crowds would grow.  A la carte-like menu: This is a trend I'm not particularly fond of, especially for breakfast. Several of the entrees don't come with either eggs or potatoes. The Loretta breakfast sandwich are examples of entrees that don't come with eggs. The Over Easy brioche and omelettes don't come with potatoes. The wait staff just shrugged it off as, \"Oh you can just order [blank] on the side.\"  I disagree, especially when you're paying nearly $10 for an entre or omelette.  Semi-scattered staff:  Everyone was friendly and engaged in small talk with people at the counter.  But after asking twice for my check, I figured it was a small blip in the overall experience.  Delicious breakfast food with a cool hip feel? This neighborhood will be all over it.  I'm looking forward to the next visit.  EDIT: 1/19/08 -- OK, I'm upping this to 4.5 stars.  Service was excellent today.  And the country fries (and tater tots with tomato jam)  were outstanding.  They were deep fried with seasoned salt, parsley...yum!"}
{"text":"We were out in Phoenix over the weekend for my Graduation and I thought coming to OverEasy was a must since I saw it on Diners Drives & Dives. And I have to say, I'm happy we went before reading the reviews.  Honestly, this place was great. We were there on a Saturday morning, around 930am. We had about a 30 minute wait and it was worth it. My boyfriend and I had the chicken fried steak and it was great. The slices of sausage in the gravy was really different but gave it a great taste.   Unlike some of the reviews, our service was right on and they were all really helpful. I do agree that they need a little more shelter from the summer sun, but we stood by the misters waiting for our table and it was totally worth the wait... I would definitely go back"}
{"text":"NOT. GOING. BACK. EVER. Food was quite good, wait staff pleasant. Manager was awful: The menu is creative and well executed, a skosh on the \"pricey\" side if you're used to diners and such, but well worth the extra. But, for food so well executed, I was surprised at how lousy the coffee was - mine tasted burnt.   And waiter had the right cadence for a Sunday. The bus staff was prompt as well.  When it came time to pay the bill, however, it was a lousy experience. The restaurant \"reads\" like a \"pay at cashier\" and so all trooped up to the front. Uh-oh, should have paid the waiter. Manager immediately stepped in - she was snippy, curt, etc. You have to realize, we were a party of 5 and had no intent other than to pay our bill - we were informed that (after being led to believe otherwise) \"they don't do separate checks, but can separate the bill.\" (into equal parts). While part of the party reacted, rather than wait the 30 seconds it would have taken, she walked immediately away with whatever payment was in her hand...which then proceeded to utterly confuse everything when she came back. My advice? Eat and get the hell out, apparently waitstaff and management can't agree on restaurant policy."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum!! No complaints! Food was fabulous and served hot and fresh! Service was very awesome!"}
{"text":"I'm quite sad that I have write this review! I looked forward to eating here especially after all of my friends have been checking in lately {even bookmarked it on yelp}. I do want to say I had high hopes and heard good things about this place so we just might have went on an \"off day\".   This is my first time at any Over Easy - they have four locations however this is the first one I have been to. I went with the hubby this morning - a rainy Saturday. The place was in a little strip mall right on the corner. The ambiance of the restaurant was nice. It is an open floor plan and  I felt like I was in a diner. The place wasn't crowded at all... We were there with maybe three other peeps.   First I noticed that they left their doors open. I could see if it was a beautiful day outside but it was cold and rainy. So I had to leave my sweater on inside. Ok-no big deal. Then they opened the only other door that was closed. So now I was scratchin' my head as to why they wanted to freeze us to death... {kidding..}  Menu was cool. They have some cool items and some odd ball stuff. I ordered a pink lemonade that was garnished with rosemary which was a little odd but I still sucked it down. Hubby ordered coffee and his words \"ehhh its gross\" but he still slammed it down.  Next, I ordered \"The Crying Pig\" {an omelette} and the hubs ordered the corned beef & hash.   My \"home fries\" that came with my omelette were cold {not good}. The omelette was huge but the meat was sure greasy. I also ordered some apple butter with my toast. I would not recommend ordering this if you are accustom to eating normal apple butter as this was pretty much like slathering applesauce on your bread. So I was disappointed. In addition, our waitress never got me a refill or offered water which would have been nice. She was busy cleaning the dinning area which also is nice but we still would have like to have a little bit more attendance.   My hubs corned beef and hash was more corned beef than hash {waitress said it was 90/10 on the corned beef} so he was prepared but what he wasn't prepared for is the onion that was in the mix. And a lot of it. He said that was weird and didn't taste right.   Who knows maybe they got a new cook or still trying to train the ones they have now. We weren't thrilled by any means and figure out \"Crackers\" or \"The Farmhouse\" or even \"TC Eggingtons\" will be much rather eaten than here.   Hope this was just a \"one off\" for all you that love this place!"}
{"text":"Went to the Indian School location for Chicken Fried Steak and Eggs this morning!  I can certainly give them some lessons on their heavily touted CFS and gravy.  Bottom line it's good, but not great, as it should be.  Season the flour and steak better and use less chicken stock in the gravy.  Eggs over medium mean slightly runny not moderately hard.  Iced Tea is phenomenal and service adequate.  I notice they're not near as busy as they used to be , hmmm...."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and each time I leave happy and full. However, the place is TINY. Expect to wait. For as popular and well known, you'd think they would consider an expansion, but it is what it is.   That being said, the food is delicious. The service is good for being a breakfast place, I'm not sure what everyone else is complaining about- you're not at a 5 star steak place.   Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Imagine driving by the shopping center for weeks, seeing the \"opening soon\" sign for yet another Triple D featured restaurant.....waiting.....waiting.....waiting.....until one Sunday morning, we think it is open.  We pull in only to see the dumpster still out front.  But wait - there are people inside.....could it be......maybe.......yes! It was the soft opening for Over Easy, a new shining star in the East Valley skies!  We happened to fall into the restaurant on the day BEFORE the official grand opening - which meant that we were one of the first to taste their menu on this side of town while overlooking the little oops that come with opening a new business.  The decor is bright and cheerful - and comfortable.  Nothing fancy, very functional - so   I won't review the service that day b/c it still had some kinks to work out - and that was to be expected  - but i will say that what those servers lacked in experience, they made up for in enthusiasm in trying to get it right - and I am sure by now they have!  We decided to start with the very basics and just ordered omelets and coffee.  I like that the omelet menu lets you choose a meat, a cheese, and a veggie so you can really make it your way.  The omelets come with potatoes and toast.  Lots of potato selections including old-fashioned slice potato home fries, just like my mom made in her restaurant.  No onions or peppers, just good fried potatoes.  Nice toast selection as well - including marble rye which was a treat for me (I never see marble here - reminded me of back home).  THe omelet was nicely stuffed - I ordered ham, mushroom and swiss.  There was some time taken with the omelet to ensure a good even mix of fillings and I the 'shrooms were freshly sauted, not canned and - I could be wrong - but I swear there were baby bellas in there.  Either way, it was a hearty breakfast.  Coffee was hot, fresh, and a nice blend - strong enough for DH but not so strong that I couldn't enjoy an extra cup.    As we looked around to see what the other patrons were enjoying, we saw lots of omelets and egg dishes, with a few diners enjoying the Brioche French toast.  Lots of clean plates and happy faces.  I think that OE Gilbert is off to a good start - and a welcome addition to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Came here on a beautiful, rainy Saturday, morning. I ordered the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes and they were delish. They tasted so sweet yet light and had the crispy edges. They came with some berries and a fluffy butter side. Their orange juice truly tastes freshly squeezed! Will be coming again!"}
{"text":"A group of friends and I used to come here often after it opened but quit coming as the service was terrible and food prep awful, we thought because if was new. I've given it several tries since then and it has not gotten any better. Sat at counter this time and was all but ignored...perhaps because she is the bartender too...ordered florentine Benedict, eggs way undercooked. I think I'm done with this place."}
{"text":"Luckily we had one of the deals/coupons for Over Easy.    We ordered the Brioche French Toast & Chicken and Waffles.  Both were good, but they could've been great.  The french toast was soaked in a sweet carmelized syrup.  Had I known it would make everything soggy, I would have asked for it on the side.  Also, the bananas were sliced into thin (sorta sad) slivers.  I feel like they could've garnished the thing with at least a whole banana - it would make the taste less one note.  B-a-n-a-n-a-s are like 19 cents at Trader Joes, right?!  Chicken and waffles were good, but you need to eat them together in every bite.  Otherwise, it's just an okay waffle and an okay piece of fried chicken.  Orange juice seemed pretty fresh and tasty, but the iced coffee seemed a little weak.  They also didn't fill the cup all the way so it looked stingy.  Poached eggs had a slightly weird tangy taste (it might have been the poaching water they used).  I would probably order fried eggs next time.  Overall, if they want repeat customers they should step up their game in plentiful garnishes and cooking technique.  I thought it was a-ok, only because it was half price.  Ouch."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Over Easy.....some thoughts....  - Its cheap, like really cheap. - I love the furniture- the table tops, the chairs the counter....it gives it a very 50s diner feel. - The a la carte menu....you can almost make it like tapas.  This works great for someone like myself who loves and breakfast and can never decide what to get.  Waffle, home fries and an egg? Sure.  Pancakes, tater tots and a ham steak? Done.  - There was a short wait when we got there but they served our party coffee while we waited. - The waitresses are really cute. - The outside seating is sort of a bummer with the sun depending on the hour and where you sit BUT I did enjoy that it was enclosed with wood slats so you aren't looking at the strip mall parking lot - The food itself wasn't amazing but it was good and filling.   - They let us linger at our table when we were finished even though there was a wait. - The menu isn't overwhelmingly huge....the food is simple, the selection is simple but its well done and enjoyable.   - The parking lot is small but you can park next door at The Vig.  I would definitely return, it was a good place for a group to have a nice casual breakfast."}
{"text":"AWFUL  - food sucks, hospitality sucks, saw bugs inside on the floor EWE!  I went with my mom that just had surgery on her foot to have brunch somewhere \"easy and close\" also keep in mind I am 6 months pregnant its hot out - my sister wanted to join us last minute so when we got there, they did not sit us inside and the hostess wasn't even nice about just looked at us and said \"RESTAURANT POLICY,YOUR WHOLE PARTY HAS TO BE HERE\" very rude - first of all youre a breakfast place - you're nothing fancy and you weren't even busy!- GET OVER YOURSELF WITH YOUR LAME POLICY So since I can't sit down and order a tea that helps me function in the morning - i walk over to BlackCat and order there (LOVE THAT PLACE, super nice and clean) Finally sister shows up I put my tea in my purse we get sat down - i take a sip from my tea and the stupid waiter says you need to throw that out \"cause of our liquor license policy\" yeah sure - FIRST OF ALL i'm not stupid - Second IF YOU WOULD HAVE SAT US DOWN I WOULD HAVE ORDERED YOUR CRAPPY TEA BUT YOU DIDNT SO I HAD TO GO TO THE OTHER PLACE SO MY MOM COULD REST HER FOOT AND WE COULD ENJOY SOME A/C and now you wont serve us food till I dump my little tea out !? Manager that looks like something out of Game of thrones - no hairnet over long hair, dirty beard and tshirt comes over and tells me the same crap - WE LEAVE HAPPILY AND ENJOY A GREAT A GREAT BREAKFAST AT ARCADIA Cafe down the street...I had eaten there before and the chicken and waffles was the blandest most boring breakfast plate I had ever had and I decided to give them another try and all I can say is I totally regret it...."}
{"text":"This an amazing place to eat if you're hungry for a big breakfast! My fiance, my parents and I ate here this morning and we loved it. Food was fantastic, liked the look of the place, and our server Jeff was super helpful and got everything right. We will be back! You have to try the orange juice, it was the best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Hear me now and believe me later!  The dining room looks exactly like a children's preschool room repurposed as a restaurant. However, what brings me to writing a review is the very bad service. I only wish I knew her name to include it.  She also made the biggest deal out of my wife's Starbucks, demanding we throw it out. Bizarre. I even offered to poor it into a different glass, but that was not good enough. We ended up leaving...    FYI: Due to the ICE Den, the parking is also a nightmare."}
{"text":"The first time we went to Over Easy, the food was wonderful and we couldn't wait to go back... However, the last two times have been very lacking. I think a small step would be for the water not to taste like a tap (very metal tasting). This, unfortunately, was the only consistency from our thee visits. This last time I had their waffle-sausage dogs, but this was so overly sweet I was only able to eat one. This item should be on the kids menu or perhaps pairing it with something a little more bland to offset the sweetness (for adults, remember) it wouldn't have been so nauseatingly sweet. The lat time we went I had their \"over easy\" entree. The bread was soggy with spinach water and I couldn't eat it. I made the best out of it by scrapping off the egg and spinach and ate just that.   And, in case you were curious, the first time we went was before this place appeared on TV. I had the Chilaquiles and he had the Cheddar-Jalapeno biscuits & sausage gravy. And both were very good (5-star good, which is why this review is a 3 star instead of a 2).  Also, this place has been a lot busier since they were on TV. Maybe after some of the hype goes down, I'll try it again and hopefully can give a better rating. I really want to like this place again."}
{"text":"It's sad when you can say that Denny's has a better chicken fried steak, but it is the truth! The gravy was bland and the steak was like cardboard.  Maybe if they had Tabasco to add some flavor it wouldn't have been so bad, but they don't have Tabasco!?  I did enjoy the Mimosa."}
{"text":"My dining companions and I were visiting relatives in Arizona and found Over Easy on Yelp.   I had been loading up on eggs and beef for the last few days so decided to have something lighter and healthier for breakfast. I ordered house-made granola and yogurt, with a side of fresh fruit.    One of my dining companions ordered the same and another ordered brioche French toast.   The granola was nothing special--sweet and bland without fruit or nuts. Frankly, it has all the character of granola bought at a grocery store. The yogurt was vanilla flavored. The fresh fruit was lovely--strawberries and blackberries that were ripe and sweet.   The brioche French toast was good but not great.   Maybe we just ordered the wrong things, because at tables all around us, the big plates of yummy-looking traditional breakfast dishes kept coming.  I kept wishing that I had ordered the full-fat, full-calorie breakfast burrito or chicken-fried steak, because they looked delicious and the people who ordered them looked very happy.   Coffee: Mediocre. Just like every place else we tried in Arizona, the coffee tasted like Folgers. I think it's simply how Arizonians prefer to drink their morning Joe. Go to Starbucks if you're craving a cup of delicious dark roast.   Ambiance: Noisy, hipster with a youngish family crowd. Not too much screaming, though.   Service: Mediocre. I had to go to the counter to ask for more coffee after our cups sat empty for at least 20 minutes. The manager was apologetic and said one of her wait staff had walked out that morning. But the service seems to be a consistent problem here based on other reviews. It was mobbed and there was not nearly enough staff to handle it.   Bottom line: I'd try it again during non-rush hours, and would stick to the fully-loaded traditional breakfasts."}
{"text":"Food was on point!!! The only issue is that they're super busy waitress seems to forget about you & simple thing like empty ketchup bottle & sugar packets for my coffee"}
{"text":"One word to describe Over Easy: disappointing.   It would've been an OK breakfast place if it wasn't for all the hype. I've been trying to visit this place since I found out it was on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives, so when I saw the deal on Doozy of a Deal, I purchased it right away. I made my own omelette with chicken, garlic, and spinach. The chicken was overcooked and the omelette and my hash browns were terribly greasy. My cousin ordered The Wolfpack and was also disappointed with her meal. It just didn't seem up to par with a place that was on Food Network.  The icing on the cake was the Over Easy Ice, their iced coffee. They could've given me a cup of water and cardamom and it wouldn't have tasted any different. We couldn't wait to get to the car to get some gum, to get the taste out of our mouths and even that didn't help. After reading other people's reviews, it looks like they hardly had any caradmom; so looks like Over Easy needs to figure out a way to uniformly make their coffee.  Sorry Over Easy, you were quite disappointing."}
{"text":"Saw this place on Triple D. The food was great but the service is horrible. Server forgot to bring out  some of our orders. Needed extra plates for the kids asked about five times. Finally the hostess brought them to us. Asked another server for napkins said he was too busy to ask my server. Had to ask for my bill four times and it still took over 15 minutes. We will never go back and do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"I went to the original Over Easy once about 6 years ago, and I remember it being good so I was happy to hear they opened another one in Gilbert. Even better, there was a Living Social voucher available.  I really like the decor of this place. The yellow and gray paint isa nice modern touch which is a very welcome change compared to all the country kitsch you see at other breakfast places in town.  The coffee was acceptable but not good. I wish they would use fresh cream instead of the prepackaged cups. My breakfast burrito was decent. I liked the crispy hashbrowns inside a lot, but the tortilla was absolute crap. How can an Arizona chain be ok with using tasteless Taco Bell-esque tortillas? At least they served cholula and green tabasco along with the very mild salsa.  My husband got the jalapeno cheese biscuits and gravy, and he was very pleased when they asked if they should serve the eggs on top or on the side (on top, of course!). However, the \"sausage\" gravy was white gravy with a quartered sausage on top of each biscuit. Weird and unsatisfying."}
{"text":"This is a classic breakfast place. I'm a bit of a plain jane and usually don't try anything out of my comfort zone, but every time i come here it is perfection.  i usually get the two egg breakfast and I like how you can customize your eggs and toast and can make some substitutions.  The buttermilk pancakes and malted waffles are amazing as well.  Whenever I am in town this is my number one breakfast joint!"}
{"text":"OMG egg white omelet with spinach, tomato and feta is the bomb!!!  Tater tots are very good as well!!  Husband had the malted waffle and cherry bacon is a must!!"}
{"text":"Wouldn't even give it one star, if I could submit it that way.  This place just very recently opened and I'd rename it \"The Dirty Diner.  The carpeting just inside the front door  was filthy.  There is no atmosphere whatsoever - like being in a bright schoolroom.  No aisle-ways between tables, they'e just kind of plopped there and no booths.   The menu is confusing - shouldn't have to ask (in a breakfast place) if they have bacon and eggs!  Advertised as full bar - there is no alcohol!"}
{"text":"Not worthy of five stars, but for sure four.  Food was good, hot and served pretty quick.  They were quick with coffee refills and also with the \"to go cup\" at the end of our meal.  The only thing that knocked it from 5 to 4 stars is I thought that the portions were a bit small.  I had the corned beef hash and eggs, and the two other orders were waffles & chicken, and the ham steak with red-eye gravy.  Overall - 4 stars and we will be back."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to stop.  Service was good, people were friendly.  I ordered some blubbery pancakes, blueberries were of the frozen variety, but then again I'm not sure if they are in season.  The cakes were cooked perfectly, light and fluffy and the real maple syrup was great!"}
{"text":"Went to Over Easy on Bell Road for breakfast this morning.  We had been there before on numerous occassions and found the food good and service excellent!  Today, service and food was okay but the coffee was the bitterest, most awful liquid I have ever tasted.  It came from PRESS a local coffee vendor.  I was afraid to dump the coffee out the truck window after I left for fear it would have eaten the paint off!  Don't have to worry about us coming back, even when hockey season begins again to see the players on home game days!"}
{"text":"I work downtown Phoenix and the delivery and their food was great. They do have a tendency to forget items like the gravy (breakfast) but over all they are worth giving them a try"}
{"text":"Another trip here for an early breakfast in Aug 2016. The inside was clean as always, except for a few pesky flies it was a good meal.   I had the grilled chicken breast, sliced tomatoes, and two egg whites with coffee. Their coffee is marginally okay, the meal was fine. I would suggest putting the tomato slices on the grill briefly or a bit longer if they did on my visit, but otherwise it was about perfect.  Every time I've eaten here I get buzzed by flies, perhaps they could address that a little better? Other than that I highly recommend dining here. With tip you can expect to pay around $20 per person but you could lower that cost.  Be sure to read the menu online before going."}
{"text":"I still visit once in a while, but have really lost my love of this place. The last time we visited we were seated around back towards the bathroom.. and then forgotten about. I had to go find someone to take our order, and they were surprised to see us.  The time before that (and the time before that) I've had to wave to get someones attention while 4 or 5 employees hung out and chatted near the counter.   The food isn't bad, but we've had over easy eggs show up cooked solid, a request for crispy bacon show up as soft and greasy. It's as if they aren't paying attention to details back in the kitchen either. We've narrowed down what we order to a few menu items that show up reliably.  Go if you aren't in a rush and aren't too picky about having things cooked to order."}
{"text":"Folks!! This is almost breakfast fine dining. Unless your other option is the Scottsdale Princess or the Phonecian this is the place for breakfast. Nobody in Mesa is getting close to a breakfast like this. Ok, breakfast is not complicated to pull off but the Over Easy goes over the top with a line up of great breakfast entrees. All house made even the bread in the over easy!! And the breakfast sausage is a great little smokey jewel! The management staff has done a great job training the wait staff, you'll be treated right. Just go, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"My fiancée and I walked right in on a Saturday morning. There were two seats available at the bar. Service and food were great! I got the yogurt with fruit and granola, and he got the two eggs, hash browns, and bacon with toast. Yum, yum! :)"}
{"text":"Did not have a positive experience.  Took food 45 minutes (3 cups of coffee) to get food and then biscuits and gravy not good at all.  Other food average.  Seemed to be sitting under hear lamp for awhile.  Few hard workers with other staff seemed to be just standing around.  1st time here and place seems to be all 'fluff' with no real intentions to provide a great breakfast."}
{"text":"Good service terrible food! Food presentation was dismal to say the least. Will not return.."}
{"text":"Used to be a fast food place, they still have the blocked off drive thru lane.  It is just one big room with no sound proofing.  You can hear every screaming child.  Bad coffee and they don't give you pot of it.  You have to constantly track someone down to get a refill.  I had the omelet and it was ok.  For $9 it was kind of thin.  I expected a lot more for that kind of money.  Service was good considering how busy they were.  The Good Egg is a far superior breakfast place."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, and had one experience that was better than the other. The orange juice is fantastic and fresh squeezed. Eggs Benedict is good, the hollandaise sauce is a bit more lemony and sour than I'm used to though. Caramelized banana French toast is amazing, as are the sweet potato tots. We didn't like the strawberry lemonade with rosemary at all- it was overly sugary and had no sour lemonade taste. The waffle dogs were good, but ours came out undercooked in the center with raw batter. Wait staff was very friendly though and got us a new order to go to make up for it. Overall not a bad breakfast joint, but not really my first choice."}
{"text":"Nicely decorated and reasonably priced. Our waitress was attentive and the staff was quick to clean tables and get folks in and out.   The waffle dogs that are raves about on tv are pretty good. The sausage isn't greasy and the waffle batter coating is light and thin. Surely a local favorite for a reason. We also enjoyed the 2 egg breakfast with sourdough and a peach mimosa.   I'll be returning to Over Easy sometime soon ."}
{"text":"Recently ate at the new Gilbert location with a group of friends.  I enjoyed a 2 egg, bacon, hash brown, and toast entrée for $7.50 and was very delicious.  Both the eggs and the has browns were cooked perfectly.  The wait staff were patient and friendly.  I would have given a 4 start review except that this location faces the East and their windows don't have any shades or tint.\  Some other men in my group had the Granola on the health menu and really enjoyed it.  It appeared to be made in house.  Definitely worth a try if you enjoy breakfast.  If they could get some window coverings, especially with summer on the way, it would really make this place a solid destination."}
{"text":"What a great dining experience with our family from Texas, millennial foodies! We also had a pre-teen and picky eater five year old to please and they ate most all of their fabulous breakfast!  Whew!  Thank You!  Four Adults had a variety of breakfast entrées plus a kid menu item that were all hot, generous portion sized and seasoned with fresh herbs and produce. Anna was our wait person and was very much above average. She forgot my ranchero salsa but was so quick and kind to bring it upon request that it didn't matter at all, plus this Texan-Arizona transplant loved the salsa! Yum! We arrived at 9:00am on a Saturday and got the last table sitting six, so no wait but by 10:00pm on departure there was a waiting line of probably 10 minutes. The waiting people had something to drink if desired by the counter area (non-alcoholic or morning coctail if preferred), no one looked unhappy to wait for good food and service. I even saw a couple moved to their preferred seating area, smoothly and efficiently. Their are mixed reviews and we were thinking we taking a risk trying this new place as we are avid fans of small town and big city time tested \"Texas Cafes/Diners\" with fresh produce and farm fresh ingredients with the charm of wait staff that have the gift of fast, superb friendliness. While \"not quite Texas\" this Arizona location of Easy Over Restaurant deserved our 5 star review and have given us a new \"home away from home\" breakfast favorite restaurant!"}
{"text":"How does this place only have 3 stars?! Staff is amazing!! And food is great! One of my favorite places to go when we visit AZ. THE SWEET POTATO TOTS ARE INCREDIBLE."}
{"text":"Traveling from California I excepted great things, however I was let down. We had the chili verde grits, they were just okay. Everything tastes like it came from a bag. The grits weren't very creamy and the chili verde tasted average. The ricotta lemon pancakes were awful. I've been fortunate enough to taste good ricotta lemon pancakes, these weren't it. I wish I would've had the buttermilk pancakes instead. Just average."}
{"text":"Unbelievable service, food is absolutely delicious a must try!! Will def be coming back."}
{"text":"Was here a few months ago and liked it. Today, a different story. Remembered they only brought 1 piece of toast with the 2 eggs any style, so I asked our server about it and her only response was, you only get 1. I said everywhere else gave 2. She had no response. Btw, last time when I asked,  my server brought out 2 more. The eggs were burnt and rubbery. The hash browns burnt and greasy. The link sausage was very good. The service was good. To pricey for what you get. Drive up the street to the Breakfast joynt. You'll be happy. This place truly sucks"}
{"text":"Stopped in today and had a great breakfast, but the cost was ridiculous. My husband ordered the Mediterranean omelet and it was this really small omelet with toast that was dried out for $10. I ordered the eggs with the wild mushrooms and it was amazing. My mom's dish was really good as well. Our bill was over $45. I would probably score the place higher if my husband received a more satisfying meal. One last issue is the flies. Very frustrating to have to swat flies during a meal."}
{"text":"LOOOOOVE this place - best breakfast around.  Have been here many times, and have brought every single guest who's visited -- and they all rave and talk about going back.  Everything's from scratch and flavorful, and there are some creative takes on the old classics.  PLUS - It's right at the hockey rink, so I can lace 'em up to work off the huge portions."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place after passing it weekly for the last year or so. Atmosphere is pretty cool, but food lacked any special quality. Large glass of orange juice was nearly $6.00...WITHOUT the vodka (lol)! Hash browns were kind of burned, and small portion to boot. Probably won't go back, as there are so many other breakfast places nearby that are much better."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place baced on \"Diners, Drive-ins and Dives\" fame.  Overall, pretty good but not sure why it has received attention.  Food quality was good.  My wife had an omelette -  eggs were light and fluffy, the cheese plentiful and perfectly blended in, and the veggies were fresh.  I had a breakfast burrito that was similarly flavorful and fresh.  It came with a side of fresh salsa  with jalapeños (which brought the \"burn\") and some fruit (put out the fire and refreshed).  The food quantity was very good.  Portions were big without being absurd.  You won't go home hungry.  Price of the food was reasonable - in-line with the quality and quantity.  It was about $9-$10 per entree.  What I found lacking:  the jalapeño biscuit.  We ordered one as a side to share.  My wife is from the South, so she knows and loves her biscuits.  This one fell way short of being respectable.  What's the opposite of light and airy?  Dense?  Heavy?  Whatever unflattering descriptor you'd select - that's a fitting description for what we were served.    All-in-all, a decent breakfast place if you're in the neighborhood, but don't go out of your way to go here.  And here's the thing about \"Over Easy\" - if you like a solid cup of Joe, they do a nice job here.  Nothing fancy, just a good ol' fashion cup of strong coffee that gets refilled often."}
{"text":"Sunday morning breakfast with two good friends.  Got in the door around 8:30, and was seated right away- the benches outside, lead me to believe there can be a bit of a wait. Croatian breakfast loaf- delicious, frittata-like goodness (the winning recipe of a breakfast competition held by the restaurant).  I hope it stays on the menu!  Strawberries and creme waffle- also tasty- could have used a bit more strawberries and whipped cream Service was friendly and quick, with a bustling/buzzing atmosphere.  Delicious breakfast option!"}
{"text":"Terribly small establishment with pretentious and rude wait staff."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place (I know, I'm soooo out of the loop) and I was very impressed. It's hard to find a great quaint little breakfast place that is actually accessible at all times (sorry, Matt's). The décor is great. This old Taco Bell has barely been converted at all, save for a few walls knocked down to make a patio -- a very cool wood-encased little shell of a space. The open-air roof keeps it breathable, but you're cool as a cucumber. The inside is diner supreme: bright colors comfy bar stools in a rub-your-elbows-sized room. I think the prices are very decent and you get bigass portions. I had the sirloin and eggs. I was craving something hearty, and I got it. This is like half a cow chopped up into little bites, three eggs however you like them, carmelized onions cooked to perfect tenderness and diced jalapenos for some added kick. It rocked my life. And have you tried the Over Easy iced coffee? Cold-brewed coffee (read: strong) over ice with sweetened condensed milk, cardamom and cinnamon with mint leaves. It's f'ing ecstasy. Try it, you'll love it."}
{"text":"The food is premium quality with a phenomenal flavor! Great price for great food. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Was here on 11/18/17 visiting from NYC with my wife for her birthday. I looked up places for brunch on my trusted Yelp site and this place was close to the hotel we stayed at. Service was great and the food was as well. Good portion sizes. Price is just right and I see why some people say get here early since they close by 3pm. If visiting the Phoenix area this place is a must you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We live in Tucson and try to visit this place whenever we are in town.  The caramel/pecan/banana brioche French toast is incredibly yummy.  Tried a spinach egg loaf today (forget the name) and it was also very tasty.  We have not been disappointed in this place yet.  We last arrived on a Sunday before the crowds started filling it up.  Heard they might be opening up a location in Tucson sometime.  Only thing is I am not used to spending $28 w/tip for breakfast...."}
{"text":"Tried to have breakfast at Over Easy but after a 40 minute wait and cold food we left. Much better at the Breakfast Joynt. Fast service and great food. My tummy is happy"}
{"text":"This is now me and my boyfriends place for breakfast. I'm a little confused with some of the negative posts on here as we thought it was seriously the best breakfast we have ever had! We walked in and the place was so cute! Our waiter was super nice.  There was such a good variety of food and had things that were different than all the other breakfast places so we couldn't decide what to get so we ordered a ton of stuff and shared it all lol. The caramelized banana pecan French toast was delish!"}
{"text":"BEST BREAKFAST PLACE AROUND!! What else can I say? The food is always fantastic (breakfast and lunch) and it keeps me coming back from more. I've never had a bad meal here. Always impressed at the quality of ingredients they use. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable. Ask for John...he is awesome and always gives service above and beyond. Plus I love the atmosphere. If you are considering trying Over Easy...stop considering it and DO IT. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Took my toddler to meet up with a few of my girlfriends and this was the second time I ate here. The first time, the service was awful and the server clearly hated life. The food was okay. I had the small version of the wolf pack and it didn't have any unique flavors and required much salt/pepper.   This last time, I got the biscuits/gravy and a scrambled egg, one friend and my son got a typical breakfast (egg, hash, toast, bacon), and other friend had a florentine Benedict. I was the only one impressed with my dish but none of us finished our meals. Good thing, because who knows how sick we would have been! We all FOUR ended up with food poisoning that evening/the next day. Misery. Either they didn't wash their hands or something was wrong with the eggs(the only common item in our dishes). Either way, I will never go back."}
{"text":"Ate at the original location in Phoenix and loved it. This location was just as good. We have been there three times. I agree $6 for a glass of OJ is pricey. Waffle dogs:)."}
{"text":"Terrible eggs. They literally only know how to make them over easy. Didn't even cook the egg whites. Most likely sunny side up. Sent them back and they still came back uncooked. They didn't comp the eggs or anything. Never going back."}
{"text":"Over-Rated.    I've been told Over Easy is the second best breakfast place in the valley.  It has been on my list to try for a very long time.  The spotty reviews and long wait at the Indian School location has always managed to stop me from checking it off.  That and that number one spot always does me right.  I finally went to Over Easy this past weekend with an open mind and great expectations.  Went with a small group and was able to try a variety of their breakfast items.  We had a short 20 minute wait.  I ordered the signature iced coffee, the infamous chicken fried steak, home style fries.  I also sampled the jalapeno sausage biscuits and gravy, and hash browns.  The 3.50 iced coffee tasted just like iced down coffee.  Just order a coffee and a side of ice cubes and add the two together.  The over easy egg I ordered was over cooked and had already been drained of the remaining yoke all over my chicken fried steak.  It's kind of crazy to think about it, now that I am putting my thoughts into words, a place ironically names itself over easy but couldn't cook my egg that way.  Wishful thinking?    The chicken fried steak was average at best.  It was super thin and the breading was soggy and not crisp.  I was severely disappointed all around.  I have had better chicken fried steaks at Cracker Barrel.  The gravy was good.  The bacon tasted awesome and was probably my favorite item.  The home fries were also very tasty and would have been superb if they weren't luke warm.  Hash browns were what you would expect.  The sausage gravy and jalapeno biscuits were huge.  Unfortunately, the biscuits were thick, dry, hard to force down and also on the cold side.  The gravy and sausage was enjoyable.  The waiter would disappear for great lengths at a time.  I thought I was going to choke and die from the thick dry biscuits before anyone would notice and give me a drink.  I can only think our food was sitting on the counter getting cold while he was off checking his fantasy football team in the back room.  For all the hype this place fails to deliver on all fronts.  I would go back again to try a few more items but I could not recommend it to others nor could I compare it to that #1 spot in AZ.   I would give it 2.5 stars if I could but no way does it get a 3 from me after this first impression.  Over-Easy...or something like it."}
{"text":"Hands down the best breakfast place in the area. The staff is friendly, food is yummy and the coffee is good. This location has nice mountain views if you eat outside. That's a plus! It does get very busy on weekends so I recommend going early."}
{"text":"Amazing. Came on a busy Saturday morning during Phoenix Comic Con, got an immediate seat at the counter, and had a great waiter. The Selena burrito is delicious. We didn't want to order a full plate of waffle dogs, so our waiter got us just one to try on the house. It was one of the most unique, tasty breakfast items I have ever consumed and I am sad to have only consumed it once."}
{"text":"Basically when you walk in no one says hello and a sign tells you to seat yourself. I think the whole seating yourself is a bad idea. So we seat our selves wondering for 5 minutes wether the waitress had seen us sitting there. Finally she comes and we ask for waters and tell her we will be ready to order in a couple minutes. Ten minutes later she finally comes to take our order. I ordered the chicken and waffles. We got our food in a decent amount of time. So we wait 8 minutes hoping someone will get us some lemonade and milk. I see one of the workers walk by and ask him for a lemonade and milk he didn't seem to speak english. I asked him because he works there and he had been bringing out drinks. So I watch as he doesn't go to get our drinks but wanders around wiping off tables and such. Finally I wave down the waitress and order their lemonade and milk. The lemonade has mint in it making it taste like crap. I watch an elderly couple come in and seat themselves next to us. They saw me complain that the mexican guy never got our drinks. They wait to be helped for 8 minutes and say why the heck are we here if no one is going to help us. The chicken waffles was hit or miss. The chicken had a crust that didn't taste like fried chicken. The waffles tasted good but the chicken didn't. The waitress gave us our check and gave the obvious thank you so much please tip me. I tipped her too well for such a crappy sitting. I recommend never visiting this restaurant. I drove 45 minutes hoping that this would be better than the usual Ihop but it wasn't."}
{"text":"Breakfast joint in a strip mall in Phoenix about 30mins north of the airport. Funky vibe. Friendly staff.  Lots of regulars. Great food. For us: Polo Loco omelette and banana pecan brioche french toast. Visited by \"Diners, Drive-ins and Dives\". That's why we went. Eat here! You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast and totally lived up to the Yelp hype! Ordered an asparagus egg white omelette and it was GREAT. Service was friendly and prompt which matched the terrific food. Walked out without feeling weighted down from the typical pancake/potato lead in the belly breakfast feeling and was ready to take on the day!"}
{"text":"From beginning service (Amy) was amazing.  Great food and atmosphere.   Friend had mimosa was delicious, I had a bloody mary was good.   Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Favorite breakfast. Love this place. Eggs are so fresh and the grits yummy. Service is consistently great."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time and I hate giving it 1 star but I have too. Over priced bland food. We much prefer Crackers and Co but there is not one really close to us so we thought we would try this place out.   The only really good things we had was the coffee and the fresh squeezed OJ.   My ex ordered the chicken fried steak and actually sent it back. the texture was tough, bland, and tasted greasy. He NEVER sends food back. Instead he ordered something they cant mess up-pancakes.   My daughter had the kids meal with an over easy egg,a piece of bacon and hashbrowns. Still a small portion for $5 which is what all the kids meals are priced at. My son ordered the french toast and for $5 he got 2 pieces of french toast, nothing else.   i ordered an omelette and again, bland and the cheese I expected to be smothered over the top but it was inside it and not much of it. I had to order salsa on the side to spice it up.   We complained to the manager and he obviously took off the chicken fried steak but nothing else and they also knew it was a birthday breakfast and our first time there. I actually left a little embarassed at my choice of dining place.   HUGE disappointment and we will not be back. Honestly we have had better food at IHOP and Village Inn and even Denny's. If you are coming for lunch and hungry, just go to Zipps next door they have the best wings and margs in town."}
{"text":"Serving only breakfast and lunch, this place is super popular and there's almost always a wait. Tip: try the strawberry lemonade with fresh rosemary."}
{"text":"There's a cute little spot that is in the middle of the parking lot for the Vig. Because of the exterior facade it actually looks like it could be part of the the Vig's property, low and behold, its a remodeled Taco Bell with cool wood paneling, a small dedicated parking lot to the south side and some of the best offerings for a full service breakfast place this side of...1st Street and Scottsdale Road, south of Camelback...I am doing my best to keep my loyalties and boundaries!...  And, I think its important for me to note, I am an Aaron May fan. I think what he has done is awesome. I appreciate the commitment to quality he consistently provides his Guests, be it at Sol y Sombra or Over Easy. He might charge a higher price than most expect, but it is worth it!  On my last visit (I've been several times), we came in the middle of the week and had blueberry pancakes (10-star-worthy), toast with a side of apple butter (that was out of this world) and I had an egg-white/asparagus omelet (that was delicious, but much too healthy). Let it be noted: Aaron's menu doesn't provide for many 'low carb' options as sides. No fruit, tomatoes or cottage cheese. Only toast, potatoes, hash browns. Me and my waistline had to get over it quickly, I did, and I still come back again and again.  Our server was attentive, patient and aware that we were talking disproportionately to our eating, but gave us plenty of room to drink 15-cups of the freshly brewed coffee, time to try each other's meals and, again, lament that I was being way too healthy for what the menu offers. All of it is delicious.  The food, service and ambiance are great and the space heaters on the patio actually work. I would  easily conduct anything from a business day breakfast meeting to anything similar to a hang-your-head-low-because-we-drank-too-much and need some good bacon grease to absorb the bourbon meeting here too, for an \"over easy\" (not that I've ever done anything like it).  Seriously though, Aaron and his team have surrounded themselves with good people that provide friendly, hospitable service. When you return, you'll find Aaron's friends are his most regular Guests and his parents and/or his sister and his wife are usually stopping by on the weekends - it says a lot when your friends and family come around all the time, because no matter what, they're going to love you - if they're going to pay a tab, and love you, the food must be damn good."}
{"text":"Just noticed they removed my comments from FB so here is what you should know:  I live close to the Ice Den location so go here and 18 degrees frequently.  Was impressed and very fond of this breakfast joint at first but the quality has taken a SERIOUS nose dive over the past few months.  Was there about 2 weeks ago and ordered the Diners, Drive In and Dives recommended chicken fried steak and eggs and it was the most grizzled piece of mystery meat i have ever had.  I ate a quarter of it and told the manager and he could have given a s**t!  I still paid for the whole thing and gave a good tip because the servers here are really great but the food is now worse than I use to get in basic training at Ft. Leonard Wood 15 years ago.    Do yourself a favor and drive a little farther down to Butterfields on Shea and skip this Diner, Drive In and Dump!"}
{"text":"I rarely will go to a restaurant with a rating below 4 as I trust my fellow yelpers but given they were on Triple D, I thought it must be good.  They relocated from by the Vig to a shopping center on Indian School Road.  I had the sausage benedict over a jalapeno cheese biscuit.  The biscuit was dry, the eggs were overcooked (not runny when you break into it, but the sauce was pretty good.  The hash browns on other diners' plates looked soggy so I asked for mine to be made very crispy, and they were.  We also tried the banana pecan french toast.  it was okay, I have had better.    Coffee sucked - it tasted smoky or burnt and they don't have lattes, what the heck?  Service was outstanding and it was obvious they were concerned about satisfying diners as they asked how everything was and if you would come back (I overhead them asking the latter question to other diners but didn't ask us).  Too many other good restaurants to try then to go back.  Sorry!"}
{"text":"Without a dought the worst breakfast in Scottsdale, not the same as Indian School.  Waffles swere cold, sausage was charred, wifes potatoes cold, and the eggs were not cooked at all.  This was the second and last time I will ever go to this dump"}
{"text":"I had been waiting forever to try this place.  OK, I will  admit it.  I couldn't get my late night butt out of bed early enough to get there!  That's what happens when you work nights in the restaurant biz!  After dropping family off at the airport at the crack of dawn we decided to make our way to Over Easy.  We realized by the clever billboard stating we had basically made a wrong turn and the restaurant was in the opposite direction.  Side note:  I work at Roka Akor and Chef-Owner, Aaron May was in the restaurant last night. I told him that we made it over to his place and loved the \"strategically placed\" billboard and that we loved the food and atmosphere too.   My boyfriend Ben, best friend Sabrina and I made our way into the restaurant.  I immediately loved the cozy feel and cheerful color and design of the interior.  The snazzy bar stools were tempting to bounce up and down like a little kid.  We took our place to a table by the door.  I love the diner feel and the buzz of guests conversation.  Our waitress was cheerful and busy but her back up girl looked like she was missing her warm bed she had to get out of on this morning.  I guess that's why I am the Night Girl.  It was also nice to be able to see the kitchen crew working well together preparing dishes left and right to the hungry diners.    Great selections on the menu with classic breakfast comfort food.  Ben chose the 3 eggs with steak, caramelized onions and chilies.  Sabrina chose the Wolf Pack: 2 eggs, bacon and cheese between layers of hash browns. Yeah, OMG!  I decided on the Lox, Eggs and Onions with choice of potatoes and toast.  I chose the sourdough.   I need to wrap this up because now I am STARVING!  I decided on the lox because it is one of my all time favorite things.  Everyone enjoyed their dishes to the point it was a little embarrassing because we did everything to the plate but pick it up and lick the death out of it!     All I can say is I can't wait to get my tired, lazy butt out of bed early enough to work my way through the menu.  I think I will definitely indulge in the pancakes or french toast.  OMG, there I go again!  I need to EAT!!!!  Thanks Aaron!!!!!  LVUMNIT!"}
{"text":"A big thank you to Brad, who invited me to try Over-Easy out again after my lackluster experience a few weeks back.  I love to see Yelp reuniting restaurants and patrons, creating harmony in the food world, once again.   Our service was about 1000x better on this visit.  Our server was thoughtful, attentive, and made sure that we were well taken care of.  Our meals were delicious.  None of the average food that we found last time... perhaps due to an increased sense about their strengths.  Just stick to what they are best at, and you'll be a happy camper.  I ordered the chicken and waffle.  The waffle could have been a little crisper, but the flavor was perfect.  The chicken was expertly seasoned, and the combination was only elevated by a large splash of hot sauce and lots of maple syrup.  Of course, you must be a fan of the sweet/spicy/savory combination to appreciate this dish.  My friend had a breakfast burrito that looked delicious, but I was actually more impressed with the side dish of fruit.  No silly bowl of melon here - just bright, fresh berries.  Mmm!  Definitely an upgrade from typical fruit garnishes.   I am still sad that there are so many tables, and a lack of defined space... but the improved food and service from my last visit definitely warrants a +2 star improvement.    Over Easy, we can still be friends :)"}
{"text":"Saw this place on food network's Diners Drive-ins and Dives so I had to come here on my random road trip to Phoenix. It was worth it. Got there and seated without any wait. Menu prices were very reasonable and breakfast for two costed only $21.24. The waffle dogs are cute and yummy. You must dip them in the sauce to truly enjoy them. Light breakfast and not overly filling. The wolf pack my friend got looked like a big heap of morning goodness. I had a bite and if was what I expected. Very good and she was very full afterwards. I would suggest trying the chicken and waffles. They looked great but I didn't try them. Overall cute little place to try out. Go there if you have the chance."}
{"text":"I had a fantastic breakfast here: French toast w/ bananas and pecans, and a delicious minty chocolate coffee creation.  The charm is that you feel as though you've been transported into 1975, with yellow formica and vintage barstools - very unique.  I would 100% go back  here again, despite the fact that it's small and often has a wait. But any foodie knows a wait is a good sign :-)"}
{"text":"Good breakfast...no doubt about it.  I had a make your own omelette and it was really well done, I'm very picky with how breakfast is made, and here they did it right. I was happy.  You know how most eggs at hole in the wall restaurants or chains like IHOP are always dry, scabbed over, and just tough? NOT HERE. This place cooks their eggs fluffy, moist, and in perfect texture, they are seriously good. The omelettes are a good portion, come with plenty of side options, and add-ons are only $1, throw on some extras, why not!?  Nice place, hip atmosphere, retro-vintage style, the servers are nice enough and the place is clean. I had a good first breakfast here, and I plan on more. If you're out by gilbert, try this one out, it's good and you'll be happy you did."}
{"text":"The complete breakfast was cold: butter,  un-buttered toast, eggs, the bacon - everything was cold. 1st time I ate here and probably the last"}
{"text":"I wanted to try one of the adult coffees I had heard about on the radio. When I asked the server for the drink list she said we don't have that and all the Over Easy restaurants are individually owned. I asked what \"brioche bread\" was like and she was like \"what?\" I said \"is it fluffy?\" ...basically she was no help and we felt rushed to order, and rushed to leave. Not even did the hostesses welcome us even after I said we had never been there before, and even when we left...hostesses were silent! Except for the lady bussing our table, everyone else seemed unhappy. I even witnessed our waitress push another employee out of her way as they crossed paths...RUDE! The food was so so, but the experience left us feeling cheated. We definitely won't be back to this Over Easy!"}
{"text":"Crazy Syrup Alert. Trying to decide between the various french toast choices, the waitress threw me a new bone. Pumpkin french toast was available (seasonal) and this was a dense breakfast treat, containing actual pumpkin seeds and nuts. It was almost like it already was pumpkin bread and then the french toast process started with the addition of bourbon. Either way, you only need a 1/2 order of this to satisfy. The best part perhaps was the bourbon/pumpkin syrup on the side - it really added an over-the-top flavor to the dish.     Also tried was the blueberry pancakes, which are not legendary, but do contain a bunch of blueberries. Better hotcakes are out there somewhere and hash browns were crispy, but too salty. Oh, I also enjoyed their Over Easy iced coffee drink - the touch of mint was interesting. We arrived at about 11:45 am on a Tuesday and the place was virtually empty. I guess this is the time to avoid those crowds."}
{"text":"Our first time here and service was horrible. Only two servers for the entire restaurant and it was very busy. When we finally received it, the food was good, but my friend's eggs were lukewarm at best. Coffee was never refilled, cream was never brought, and had to ask for water twice before it was refilled. Probably won't come here again. Waiting to see how long it will take to get our check."}
{"text":"I have never been huge on breakfast but for some reason lately I'm just on this breakfast kick. Anyway, I have lived in the area for about 6 months and finally made it over to Over Easy. Considering the short hours there is always a wait for a table but both times I have gone the bar has been available straight away.  My first visit I was surprised at the not-so-trendy atmosphere. It is instead very whimsical and diner-y with a bright and childish twist. I ordered the banana pecan brioche french toast after reading about it in Phoenix Magazine (I think) and it was delicious! For the price I was expecting Texas toast or french bread as the base but it was regular ol' bread and it did just fine. I forget how filling breakfast foods are. I also got the iced coffee which was TASTY. It's cold brewed with cinnamon and mint and it is unique and refreshing. Plus, for the large glass you get at the right price you can't beat it.  Second time around I got an omelette with jalapeno, cheese, and onion (you can build your own) and it was the best omelette I've ever had. I typically do not eat eggs out places because I'm paranoid about undercooked eggs but I saw someone else's omelette whilst deciding what to order and it was browned to perfection just the way I like it. PERFECT. My boyfriend ordered their strawberry & rosemary lemonade and that was also really good.  I see a lot of comments saying the food is nothing special but I wouldn't quite put it that way. They serve typical breakfast foods but they tweak 'em with their own touch. Definitely worth a try for those who are teetering."}
{"text":"Excellent food, the atmosphere was very inviting. Very family friendly, my daughter loved the chocolate chip pancakes. Service was a bit slow but we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We just came back from breakfast/brunch today.  We were expecting great things, but were totally disappointed.  We both had different forms of eggs Benedict.  The eggs were relatively small, the english muffin they use was very thin but large in diameter, so the egg was like a quarter in the middle of this thin large muffin, and they used ham vs canadian bacon.  My husband had the lox (with bone in it!).  We both thought the hollandaise sauce was tasteless, watered down and must have been from a diluted mix because it totally lacked any discernible taste.  We would not return."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch with a colleague this afternoon. We ordered an omelette and a sandwich. Service was good- our waitress checked on us throughout the meal and made sure we were good. Everyone was very nice, food was ok- what you would expect in a diner type of place...Not really good but not bad, just blah. I thought the ham was weird in terms of texture and size. Jalapeños were not spicy and tasted like nothing.   Like if you are hungry, you will eat it. We work right there, so I'm sure we will be back. Next time I'll try something else and hope for better. 4th star is for service. Food is 3 stars."}
{"text":"I love this place. I order the eggs Benedict every time-it has never disappointed. Whenever I have guests in town and friends over I bring them to Over Easy. The atmosphere is welcoming and bright. The staff are always kind and helpful. The prices are phenomenal. Go there!"}
{"text":"I felt like a little pig when I went to over Easy. I wanted to try everything. I ofdered the jalapeno cheddar biscuits with sausage gravy, the caramel pecan brioche french toast and a side of corned beef hash.  The owner saw my confusion over the array of breakfast options and he helped me along. I told him I wanted to try the above items and he suggested I get half orders of everything.  What a great idea. That way I got to try all the favorites.  Clearly the winner was the brioche french toast. Loved the caramel and pecans.  Just this entree alone is worth the re-visit. The brioche was toasted on the outside but still had a \"fluffy\" center. The caramel sauce was terrific and the pecans were crunchy. LOVED this.  Next I had the jalapeno cheddar biscuits with sausage gravy. I did not care for the biscuits, they were kind of bland. I appreciated the huge chunks of sausage in the sausage gravy. I just wish it had more pepper, which was easy to remedy.  The corned beef hash was homemade. I am used to a chunkier hash, the corned beef in this hash was ground. It still had a good taste.  I will have to go back and try the waffle dogs and the cherry scones."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ate here this past weekend. We went around lunchtime, so we were able to sit immediately and got helped right away. Service was fast and super polite.  I ordered the chicken fried steak and he ordered the steak and eggs. We were a little curious why he hadn't been asked how he wanted the steak cooked. When the plates arrived, we saw why. Unfortunately they had chopped the steak up into pieces and cooked it in some sort of gravy. It almost looked like dog food on his plate. That was super disappointing. My food turned out great, although the hash browns could've been cooked a little longer to be allowed time to crisp up.  The bathroom was also absolutely disgusting. I had to use the one across the hall because there was no saving it.  Clean the bathrooms and don't chop up a perfectly good steak and we might be back."}
{"text":"Yet again this was a great experience. It's was a packed house but the group managed to get all the customers in and out as quickly as possible, not to mention they had great food and service. Which in this day and age is very hard to find that combo."}
{"text":"Just average to below average. Space is too small. Undersized plates. Cheap silverware. Servers are nice. People overall friendly.  Undercooked bacon.  Undercooked french toast.  Hard to screw up breakfast.  When we go out to eat breakfast you just have to get it right.  Breakfast food is not hard to cook.  You have to get it right every time."}
{"text":"This is kind of a tucked away cafe surrounded by a busy ice rink and health club. It's an odd location for sure, but closer to my house than the one in Arcadia. We came here just before 1pm on a Saturday afternoon. We mistakenly thought it closed at 2pm but it turned out to be the Arcadia location. Another mistake was assuming their menus would be the same. Unfortunately, the eggs benedict weren't on the menu at this location.   Slightly dissappointed, we made the most of brunch by ordering a side order of french toast on brioche bread along with a Selena burrito, Dolly egg sandwich, and Patsy egg sandwich. I ordered the tater tots with my sandwich but upon further inspection of the menu, wished I tried the sweet potato tots! My friend tried the home style potatoes with her sandwich.   Both the egg sandwiches were stuffed. The Dolly sandwich with bacon was excellent--very filling, not too greasy. The Selena burrito was huge and my friend could barely finish hers. The brioche french toast was good as well, with a nice thick piece of bread. My two galpals also ordered some mimosas and bloodymarys. They said both were good--I liked the bloodymary more myself. I'll have to try their cold coffee next time--anything with condensed milk has to taste delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is disgusting. I think I may have had the worse restaurant food in my life today."}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised with the food & drinks here. The chicken fried steak was delish! But the biscuits and gravy were not good enough to order again but were good enough to eat once. We were intrigued by the rest of menu & will definitely be back. The En Fuego Bloody Mary was great & spicy, just the way my husband likes it & who doesn't like bacon?! We would suggest to them though to keep the bacon as one piece instead of crumbling it on top of the drink- as soon as you tried to eat it, it sank - booooo! They have many nice hangover drinks to choose from so we will definitely be back for those too!"}
{"text":"I think this is a good place. The service was really good and we got lucky and got a super good waitress. The food here is really good. I would recommend the chicken and waffles and the biscuits and gravy. The bloody mary and the mimosa are good. The orange juice is fresh and not bottled and there bloody Mary mix isn't pre mixed which is always a plus.  Me and my wife will be coming back to try other things on the menu. The eggs Benedict are awesome as well."}
{"text":"This restaurant will satisfy your earthly food desires!!! The atmosphere is fun and retro in style. The servers are excellent and prompt. The food was fabulous and plentiful. Trust me on this - you will love this restaurant!  A solid 5 star rating!!!"}
{"text":"I liked it..The patio was very pleasant and the food was good..I got the norm..2 eggs a piece of ham and toast..Im easy when it comes to breakfast ;)"}
{"text":"I had the worst breakfast of my life and it was the \"healthy steak and egg whites.\"  The steak was unseasoned except for jalapeño bits and uncooked green onions.  It is supposed to have caramelized onions but they were simply cooked onions.  The whole plate was oily and unappetizing.  I never plan to come here again."}
{"text":"Had breakfast this morning. Prices are a little high for what you get.  Very disappointed that food was only Luke warm but it took quite awhile to get our food that we did't send it back.  Waitress was great.   This was the 2nd time we've been there and both times food was not hot. Not a cozy place as it is open high ceilings when tend to be noisy."}
{"text":"First timer and food was amazing! Not to mention they serve their mimosas in pint glasses!"}
{"text":"So sorry ! my husband and I were so excited to try this restaurant, we drove a bit of a distance only to be throughly disappointed. The wait was about 35 minutes which we didn't mind we 15 minutes after we were seated for water and a server.  It was total confusion! Servers and bus people every where.  We had no silverware, we had to beg for coffee. I ordered the eggs florentine and my husband ordered eggs with corn beef hash.  While we were waiting for our food I noticed how  dirty the bus boys clothes were and one of them kept wiping his nose on his fore arm. Also there was a big guy in a black T Shirt that wiped his nose with the back of his hand. I was sick!  My husbands corn beef hash was very good but cold as was his dry toast. Mine was the worst florentine I have ever had, the hollandaise Sauce was so full of lemon that it made you pucker. I was not about to send it back. They asked if everything was ok and I told them that I could not eat it because of the lemon, they took it off our bill. I think Arizona is so desperate for non corporate, neighborhood restaurants that we sometimes over look the quality, I cannot over look dirty. CLEAN IT UP AND GET A REAL CHEF and try again. ,"}
{"text":"I am pregnant and was craving a good breakfast. I heard good things about this place. My husband grabbed take out. I ordered blueberry pancakes halfway done with first one there's a short black curly hair in it. I gagged and threw the rest away!!! Sooooooooooo disappointed"}
{"text":"Ths food here is pretty good, prices are not bad. However they REALLY need to have fans on the ourdoor patio. We had no choice but to sit outside this past trip and while it was cool in the shade of the tree in the parking lot where we waited, the outdoor patio covering is metal with no slots for heat to escape. It was like an oven. Outdoor temp was probably 95 degrees, but under this \"shade\" patio it was more like 125! Even the host commented on how hot it was under there! For the prices and service you're better off at La Grande Orange."}
{"text":"Great brunch spot for a different take on the classics.  If there is one thing you must get its the waffle dogs. Breakfast sausage, hand dipped in waffle batter, topped with powder sugar and served with syrup. This by itself is worth stopping in."}
{"text":"Nice place to come for breakfast. I like the variety the menu offers and the service is pretty good. I would not consider this a place to go if you want to relax and take your time eating or if you have a big group. Although a more hip and fun restaurant, the feel doesn't allow for \"campers\" as the servers call it."}
{"text":"Excellent! I shared the waffle dogs with a friend ... a m a z I n g ! Also, I had The Mediterranean Avocado toast, YUM! Def recommend... great service as well :)"}
{"text":"Very disappointing morning.  Wanted a great breakfast, but instead received NO service.  Waited 10 minutes to get waited on - and nobody came over to even say hello.  The place was not busy - 5 tables of people with over 5 staff available.  Had to leave after nobody could even say hello.  Sorry to say....won't be back."}
{"text":"This location is absolutely awesome! I have been to a couple of other locations and this one totally supersedes them.   The environment is open and spacious with ample seating inside and out.   I ordered the two egg breakfast substituting avocado for hash browns and it was delightful. My friend raved about the chiliqilues and her daughter loved the pancake, light on the reeces.  Mimosas were good and relatively inexpensive at $6.00 per glass. I always love when they use fresh squeezed juice!!  The only reason for a 4 star review instead of 5 is due to it being a little pricey for a simple plate of two eggs, 2 pieces of bacon, toast and choice of hash browns, cottage cheese or avocados. Overall, though I highly recommend this place! Great service, good food and nice atmosphere"}
{"text":"I thought this place was pretty good. I split three different meals with a friend: Chilaquiles, French toast, and chicken fried steak and eggs with tater tots.   The eggs were cooked perfectly and the tater tots were delicious haha. The country fried steak was a bit tougher than I like.   The French toast was pretty dang good, and I'm not a big French toast fan. We also got the caramelized bananas and pecans on the side so we could try with and without. Wouldn't add them on next time.  The Chilaquiles were tasty, but the overall flavor was kinda close to Nacho Doritos.  I will definitely be back to try more and see if I can find that perfect meal here."}
{"text":"02/11/2018: My husband and I have been to this restaurant twice now and I don't think we will be going back. The food was mediocre and the service was okay.   Last time we were there, I ordered the traditional eggs Benedict but unfortunately my egg was poached hard and the hollandaise sauce just tasted like thick butter. My husband ordered a burger with egg, which he liked and he especially liked the tater tots.   The service was fine. The gal noticed that my egg was grossly over cooked and didn't say anything about it. I should have said something, but just felt the experience was lackluster overall."}
{"text":"I went back to their new location and love it! The decor is fun and bright and the space is much better than their previous location. There's more space and yet the atmosphere is still warm.  The food is delectable and comforting, which is exactly what I love about a good hearty breakfast.  Each dish of theirs has a unexpected touch that makes it unique to Over Easy and I can't help but feel as though they don't miss a beat.  All ingredients are fresh and the options for healthier meals are present as well if you're feeling as though you want something a little on the lighter side.  The pricing is reasonable and the portions are solid.  I am so grateful for the new location in that it's a little less crowded and the service is always friendly, prompt, and warm.  I can't wait to go back for another weekend breakfast!"}
{"text":"01/01/16 Called at 9:00am and made a reservation for 10:45am. Girl on the phone said it wasn't busy and took my name.  Arrived on time and there was no table available. When I asked her why not she said because they got busy and she wasn't watching the time to save us a table. Uhhhh, thanks hostess. Honestly, her attitude to accompany her F@&k-up didn't help either.   ORDERED: - Benedict florentine with cottage cheese - 1 waffle dog (gave me a stomach ache) - chicken with tomato - omelette with mushrooms and cheese - 3 coffees & 3 waters  PROS: - after the F&$k up the server was very nice. He came by frequently to ensure we had what we needed  - food came out fairly quickly.   CONS: - set a reservation and the hostess didn't follow through with it - had a snooty explanation. After my husband asked about it and the table wasn't ready I had to engage the hostess to see what was going to happen next. She was ready to take the next person instead of addressing our need for a table. So weird.  - the waffle dog wasn't that great. Don't have high expectations  - Coffee: goodness it sucked. Such bad coffee. Yuck! - Benedict: English muffin was pure mush. They forgot to toast it. Poached eggs were over cooked and yolk was solid"}
{"text":"Love this breakfast place! Food is excellent and service by our favorite waiter Jeff is superior!! He goes above & beyond to make sure we have a good experience.  We come @ least once a month and enjoy each time"}
{"text":"Good food, good experience.  Always is.  I love this place and Tempe is as good as Arcadia :)"}
{"text":"Loved the fried chicken and waffle dish.  The spice and the maple syrup really worked well together.  My wife's chilaquiles dish was excellent, also, and she also enjoyed their signature iced coffee drink.  Nice vibe in this place, too."}
{"text":"Went here because it was a Food Network reviewed restaurant in Diners, Drive Ins and Dives. It was tasty but a few things were bummers. 1, it was busy. Food took a while to come out. I ordered Corn Beef and Hash Cakes with a hollandaise sauce. So, since our food took a while to come out, I fear that my food sat for a while and the texture I was expecting was a let down. It was more mush because the sauce overtook what I presumed the texture to be more of a hash cake. It was mushy and my food was almost colder than room temperature. It was weird. As if they don't have food warmers. It was tasty I'll give them that. But even my caramelized onions were mush which normally happens when caramelized onions have sat a while. So over all. 3 I think is satisfactory. Maybe if we would've came here on a less busy day the food woulda been great. My wife ordered a breakfast burrito. No mush there but there were no wet ingredients."}
{"text":"Well my first review of Over Easy; have gone here a few times; only reason I don't go more often probably because of the wait. The food is definately makes me want to return.  The Hopple Popple, the Wolf  Pack, and what I had today, the Loco Moko (only criticism is the rice); great lemonade (when I used to drink lemonade) and the hash browns & they have tater tots!!! I'll be back; when I can get up early..."}
{"text":"The coffee was perfect. The service, commendable. I ordered the caramelized banana and pecan brioche French toast. The rubbery texture of the bananas was off-putting, the pecans were chopped way too small, and the caramel sauce was runny. The brioche was, however, delicious. I would visit again, but I would not order what I had this time round."}
{"text":"Dang, does this place know how to make a good breakfast. The Wolf Pack is aaaaaamazing! It gets busy on the weekends, so expect a wait... but it's definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"We have always had the best breakfast food and the best service at this location.  Fast delivery with a smile, delicious eats, comfortable seating...This is our favorite weekend breakfast spot in Mesa!"}
{"text":"Sign is upside down  . A little  difficult  to fund . I had their  corn beef hash . It was put in a small  plate  and kept  falling  of the plate . The hash was salty  and dry . I like the menu but the food  was average"}
{"text":"New Location at the Altell Ice Den in North Scottsdale is now open, bigger space the the 40th spot... Food still great. Also 18 degress the lunch and dinner joint they own is open next to it as well. I have not eaten their yet! Menu looks good."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place !! Fast service and friendly. Be prepared for food coma. I had chicken fried steak with over easy eggs and sweet tots it was greatttt !! $10   Caramelized banana pecan french toast $5 Orange juice pricey $5 PER GLASS    I had wait about 5-10min to be served not bad!  We will be back to try more good food !!  :-)"}
{"text":"Best food in Western US.  Best breakfast ever.  Best service.   I will not eat anywhere else when we are home. Eggs perfect. Pancakes perfect.  The best ever. Unusual but great dishes also available.  The best!!! I travel extensively  and know good food. This exceeds expectations."}
{"text":"I had high expectations walking in since we had seen this place on DDD/Food Network. It was average. We ordered the famous Waffle Dogs which was by far the best of what we ordered. My boyfriend ordered the Hash & Eggs with tater tots which he said was good. I ordered the Country Fried Steak & hash browns which was disappointing. The CFS was soggy/not crispy at all like you would expect and the hash browns were also soggy and oily so I didn't finish even half my breakfast. Too bad."}
{"text":"We LOVE Over Easy!!! Every Friday morning, our Date Day begins with Julian and his AMAZING staff!!! Food is always fresh and so Yummy!! They make their OWN English muffins and jelly!!!! The staff is extremely friendly, courteous and very helpful!   Looking for a good breakfast place? Over Easy is your place!!!"}
{"text":"This place is the perfect brunch spot. I am a sucker for a great brunch. We got the chicken and waffles and the classic eggs Benedict! I loved  their signature iced coffee and the OJ was perfection I could've have a gallon of it. My only thing is that I wish the Benedict had more of that delicious hollandaise sauce it was a little stingy with the sauce."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised to find out that they serve gluten free pancakes and sugar free syrup!  Overall the food is on par with most breakfast places. Ambiance very nice . Modern diner style booths and really cool decorations surround you. Best of all the service was quite good and the price for breakfast for two $28. I highly recommend this pretty cool place."}
{"text":"Love the new menu. Avocado benedict is awesome!!!! Peach bellini goes well with everything ;)"}
{"text":"Not bad,  but not amazing either.  The Eggs Benedict Florentine had nicely blanched fresh spinach,  but something about the houlindese sauce is off.  Maybe the lemon or the lack of zing in the flavor."}
{"text":"Breakfast is easy. As far as restaurants are concerned, it's something that's very hard to screw up. Menu creation can't be all that difficult because of the classic meat + egg + potato + bread formula we've all come to expect. I'm not here to write to say Over Easy screwed up, but they were on the verge of coming close.  I had been wanting to try Over Easy for about a  year now, partly because of all the media attention is has received locally as well as nationally. I'm always up for an alternative to the national chain pancake houses I grew up eating at. For this reason and the classic breakfast formula being so hackneyed and often trite, I am often inclined to avoid that part of the men, unless [the restaurateurs] try something a little different with it.  Over Easy showed promise with a little dish they call \"The Wolfpack\".   Upon more objective observation, the dish is just a mild variation on an old classic with more starch, luring you into a false sense of hedonistic pleasure, but really just filling your belly with potato.  Being my first time here, and looking to enjoy a good hearty breakfast, I decided to play it relatively safe and ordered The Hopple Popple. Chunks of salami, potato, cheese and egg scrambled together with bell peppers for color and for texture and served with a side of toast. It's another variation on an old classic and probably not unlike something I'd make at home, so I decided to try it.  It's description reminded me of something I had ordered at Matt's Big Breakfast not too long ago, so why not.  My first thought as my server placed my plate in front of me was \"That's it?\" Presentation left something to be desired and even though the atmosphere had a somewhat kitschy greasy spoon vibe to it, I wasn't all that impressed. The amount of salami was substantial, but the chunks were so big, they appeared sparse in the monochromatic assembly of ingredients that lay before me. It may sound silly, but a small bit of parsley or a sprig of rosemary as garnish would have probably classed up the plate a little.  My wife tried the Chicken Fried Steak, an old classic I am always drawn to, especially at independents because it really gives them a chance to shine. Any old restaurant can take a flash frozen fritter and drop it in the deep fryer, but it really takes something to bread your own steak. For that I give Over Easy kudos.   For my daughter, the economic egg + potato + bread dish (add meat for $2 more) satisfied all nutritional requisites but was very basic in it's execution. The most interesting part of the whole meal was when the matriarch of the crew behind the counter shared with us their Tomato Jam, a salty sweet concoction that was equally good as a spread on toast as it was a dip for tater tots.    In all, I wasn't all that impressed, but the menu showed promise and perhaps next time I'll be a little more adventurous in my selection as long is isn't just thrown on the plate because going out isn't all about the food, it's the experience as well."}
{"text":"I love Over Easy Arcadia and was thrilled when they expanded to Gilbert and Mesa. This location definitely doesn't have the vibe the Phx and Gilbert locations have- totally different clientele- think Denny's. But there was no wait, the food came out fast, and was just as good as the others. My omelet was good and my toddler loved the french toast. For a quick and yummy breakfast we will definitely be coming here again."}
{"text":"We had such a great experience here this morning! The wait moved quickly, the hash browns and lemon ricotta pancakes were amazing, and the coffee was just what I needed after a night out. There was a slight mishap where my pancakes got sent to the wrong table and the staff and manager went above and beyond and even comped our breakfast! We will definitely be back for some yummy food and great service."}
{"text":"This is not the store that Guy likes so much on DDD but a companion. Parking is often an issue. Staff is nice, helpful, etc, and they are attentive to the customers. I suppose part of that is to keep us moving. There is usually a wait.  The food is plentiful. I had the chicken fried steak first time and it was good, not great. Second time was bacon and eggs and hash browns.  Good, not great. Friends had other breakfast choices and were happy. None of us tried the wolf pack which is large and enormous portions. The other day we tried another place for breakfast and decided we need to go back here."}
{"text":"I usually like this place but was a little disappointed this last time. I tried the eggs Benedict and did not like their own made hollandaise sauce. Next time I'm sticking with my usual blueberry pancakes. Boyfriend liked his meal (he had the wolf pack). Service was good. We got in quickly for a busy Memorial Day Monday morning. Unfortunately we both got sick later in the day and it was the only meal we had eaten so I'm going to be a little hesitant next time I think about going to over easy."}
{"text":"Great breakfast joint!  I've eaten there twice and have recommended it to a few friends, and all have loved it.  The Hopple Popple is my favorite, and the portions are huge!  Not the greasy spoon that you often see when dining out for breakfast."}
{"text":"The breakfast burrito was okay and for this reason I felt it was overpriced. The location next to Ice Den and the operating hours are really great. The staff are friendly and the service was fast."}
{"text":"I had a Dr. appointment early in the morning and I had to travel to downtown Phoenix. Afterwards, it was still pretty early, so I decided to try Over Easy. I saw this place on Diner's, Drive-In's and Dive's, but I didn't realize I was close by, until I saw it on my Yelp app (for Android-which isn't as good as the iPhone app-BOOO!). I popped in and had the (I don't remember what it's called), it was the Mexican one. It had strips of tortilla's and a sauce with an egg on top. The sauce was really good, but the entire dish was, overall, just average. It was the dish the server recommended, too.   I'll probably stop by again if I'm in the area. This time, I'm having the Eggs Benedict. Person next to me had it, and it looked AMAZING!"}
{"text":"My girls from work and I had a rough night so we decided to visit a breakfast place that serves alcohol and at the same time, close to our workplace. Over easy was the best option so we went and had a good time. The service was really good and we were seated rather quickly. The guy that served us was kind, suggested a few things. I got the avocado toast and Bellini. It was a great combo however, I found the toast to be slightly overpriced. Overall, we had a good time. I want to come back and try something different!"}
{"text":"Completely disappointed and feeling ripped off.  I'm not a hog but when I buy breakfast I expect to be full when I leave.   I ordered the corned beef hash breakfast that was comprised of about 3/4 of a cup of CBH, two eggs, and 2 pieces of toast.  The CBH was borderline gross so I guess  they did me a favor with the bird like portion.  Just shy of 14$ before tipping the pleasant Hispanic waitress 5$.  NEVER AGAIN, hate getting ripped off...."}
{"text":"I had a perfect breakfast here.   First, I sat out on the patio, and al fresco is always a bonus. My mushroom omelette was outstanding, with just the right quantity of flavorful brown mushrooms. So many mushroom omelettes are made with small bits of bland white mushroom that the whole thing seems sort of beside the point. I also had goat cheese in the thing and, damn, that tasted mighty fine.  Another bonus: Espresso tasted like it should, with complex flavor and zero bitterness. This is not easy to do, at least as judged by the dozens of places around the western U.S. I've tried the stuff, of which very few get it right.  Service and serving was prompt. The place is clean and comfortable and, for the high quality of the food and espresso, better prices than I expected. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Still a good to great breakfast joint for us.  We've been back a couple of times in the last few months to try some different menu items.  In September I had the bacon, egg, & cheese English muffin sandwich with home fries ($8) and my husband had the chicken fried steak & hash browns ($11).   I was asked how I'd like my egg, and I ordered it over easy.  When the sandwich came out, the yolk was cooked hard.  Now for me, breakfast is no fun unless there's delicious yolk running everywhere.  So I mentioned it to our server and she took the plate back to the kitchen.  It came back with half as many home fries and an over easy egg, but the English muffin wasn't toasted and the cheese was kinda cold.  Lesson learned.  I'll follow my mom's advice and just shut up and eat what I was given the first time.  I love the home fries.  They get them golden crispy and grill them up with onions.  Perfection.  My husband enjoyed his chicken fried steak and we planned to come back again soon.    This month we had the breakfast burger ($11) and the wolfpack ($9), and just went halvsies on everything.  The breakfast burger tasted like a pressed, previously frozen patty, but with an over easy egg on it, some onion straws, and cheese, it held up reasonably well on flavor.   The wolfpack is always delicious.  We sit at the bar and the service has always been friendly and efficient.  Solid 4/5 for us."}
{"text":"This place is excellent for a weekend brunch. I suggest going early to beat the crowd AND the heat. I would suggest the waffles and I don't normally even like waffles. There is some sort of secret recipe in these puppies, they are light and melt in your mouth. The best thing you can do is custom order the bananas foster (on menu with pancakes) but have it with your waffle instead. Unbeatable. You'll get service with a smile, great quality food and low prices. If you can sit inside and watch the proceedings in the kitchen, you'll see the place running like a well-oiled machine."}
{"text":"Went here today with my coworkers on a work trip and had one of the worst and most mediocre chicken omelets I've had. The fruit consisted of a piece of pineapple, piece of melon and unripe grapes. Our waitress was nice, but the food was bad."}
{"text":"Little breakfast spot along the outter part of superstition springs mall. My family said they had a creative menu and being a person who loves to check out places that were different, this was a must.  We were greeted by hostess who was welcoming and very smiley. Seated fairly quickly and greeted by our server within a minute of sitting down. Service overall was pretty good, only complaint was we noticed 2 tables that were sat after us got their food before us. Granted we did have a larger party but one of the parties was also a bigger party so kinda made a few people at our table urked when they noticed that.   As for food, I agree the menu was creative. I got the avocado benedict. Healthy option for eggs Benedict, instead of an English muffin they use avocado. The pico serves inside definitely adds flavor. I would get it again. Wolfpack is confusing, they have eggs and bacon topped with a mass amount of hash browns. You gotta search underneath for the eggs and meat."}
{"text":"I was a little disappointed with both the service and the food.  The food was not even warm when it was served.  It was greasy on top of that.  Coffee was good though."}
{"text":"I came back a 2nd time and brought a different friend with us.  We still came on a Saturday at around 11 am and while it was busy, we got seated right away.  I went big and got the Wolfpack Club which is the original Wolfpack but more bacon, an extra layer of hash browns and 2 more eggs.  The price of this bad boy was $16.50.  The original Wolfpack sells for $8.99 (I believe).  I was full but was it worth the money?  Kind of.  Instead of cheese it was topped it with I'd rather have the country sausage gravy on it instead.  So for $16.50, I'm going to get the Wolfpack (PlanetCabo style).  I will get the Wolfpack minus the cheese and get an order of biscuits and gravy and marry the 2 together. BAM!  A star is born.  One of these days I will try their brioche french toast but my new concoction is calling me first."}
{"text":"I like scrambled eggs.  This means not making an omelette and at the last minute mucking it up to make it look like scrambled eggs.  This makes it taste like a fried egg to me.  Took forever as well."}
{"text":"My wife and I wanted to have a nice Sunday breakfast and head to Over Easy in North Scottsdale.   There was a 20 minute wait which we expected, but the waitress sat us down inside about ten minutes in.   The waitress we had was very nice. I know we've had her before, but I'm blanking on her name. Anyway, I got the Wolfpack, which is a favorite of mine. My wife got an omelete. I felt like being a pig so I ordered one Waffle Dog.   When the food came, I got a whole plate of them. This was a mistake, but this was taken care of by the restaurant. They only charged me for the one and were very apologetic about the mistake.   I offered the waitress one but she declined. I only wanted one! They're good!   My wife got their ice coffee which I took a sip of and did not like. I don't think the cardamom inside it agreed with me.  I like this location much better than the 40th street and Indian School one. The people here are more friendly and the food taste better here for some reason."}
{"text":"When I saw they were putting another Over Easy in Phoenix, I was ecstatic. The other location on Indian School is usually pretty packed, so I hadn't had a chance to try this place out. Imagine my surprise when, late on a Sunday morning, the restaurant was relatively empty. Odd...  I was in the mood for chicken and waffles, so I didn't have to spend too much time agonizing over the menu. It was a decent meal, but it failed to live up to the \"Best Food Ever\" hype (which is stated in the menu, btw). They don't really garnish it any special way, and it's a little pricey considering you get just one breast and one waffle.You can easily get two or three more pieces of chicken at other breakfast joints of similar caliber.  I think my biggest complaint though was the service. They specifically highlight their \"Midwestern hospitality\" on their website, but I didn't get that vibe at all. My waitress was cold and only said as much as she needed to in order to do her job. She brought the check halfway through the meal without even asking how the food was, which made me feel a bit rushed and unwelcome. Not enough to ruin my day, but still a bummer coming from a place featured on the Food Network.  I'll probably come back here again and give it another go, but before then, I'll definitely continue to broaden my brunch horizons."}
{"text":"Nice portions and friendly service. Good experience but I enjoy other places in the valley for a good breakfast."}
{"text":"I agree, this place doesn't have anything special to offer and seating is crammed. Service wasn't too bad but their is room for improvement."}
{"text":"We had just arrived in the Phoenix area after a long drive and what an unexpected treat! The servers are so kind and go out of their way to make sure you are enjoying your meal and experience. We both ordered the chicken fried steak breakfasts and it was the best we've ever ordered. So flavorful and crispy, we will definitely be stopping by again before we leave Arizona. Thanks for the wonderful meal!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, prompt, friendly service and a cool atmosphere.  The staff was very friendly and our or orders came out so fast I couldn't believe it!  I ordered the crying pig omelet  with hash browns and a bloody mary, absolutely fantastic.  The covered patio looks inviting when the weather cools off.  They also had a carry out option, which we may take advantage of at some point.  I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I used to visit the old location, before they moved. It was fun, had character and, of course, delicious food.  I hadn't visited this new location yet and was looking forward to our visit.  Unfortunately, it was nothing special.    The food was good, but not great.  A little overpriced and dishes were on the small side.  The ambiance was so-so.  About what you'd expect for a restaurant in a strip mall.  Service was fine.  Nothing really went wrong, but it just wasn't that special.  It wasn't the same restaurant as the one I visited at its previous home, and that's too bad."}
{"text":"Food was not good!  I wish I had read some of the reviews before taking my friends there.  We went in for breakfast with 2 other couples based on Guy Fieri's review.  Each of us ordered something different and were very disappointed. The eggs were extra small and over cooked, hash browns were mushy, omelets were burnt on the edges, ham steak was tough and the red eye gravy was about one teaspoonful on the plate. The corned beef hash wasn't any better than Libby's out of the can.  We don't plan to eat here again.  I guess when you know Guy Fieri is coming in you make the food look better and probably taste better. Too bad!"}
{"text":"I love finding good breakfast places. Places that are not your ordinary breakfast place. Good and different breakfasts at a good price. I had the Avocado Benedict, which was absolutely perfect especially if you are not a carb lover, you don't even know if you are missing them. I also had the Lemon Ricotta pancakes and they were light and fluffy and very lemony, so if you like lemons you will love these. The place is casual and has a retro diner feel. Slightly cramped but the food makes it worth it. It was very good."}
{"text":"The food was great.  The service was fantastic. Lonnie, our server, was quick, and personable. He geeked out with us over various things throughout our meal. I had the country fried steak. My wife had the cheddar jalapeño biscuits and gravy.  We're definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Wow, such a letdown. We tried to come here on a weekend morning and the place was packed with a line out door - usually a sign of something good. I stopped in on a week day afternoon and the girl with blue hair looked puzzled or annoyed that I was there. Luckily she turned out to be my waiter - oh so lucky... I wasn't in the mood for just two eggs and bacon as 90% of the menu was comprised of just that so I ordered the chiquiles. It was described to have tortillas but they meant tortilla chips which I guess is another way to prepare this dish. It was a bland sauce poured over soggy tortilla chips with chicken bits hidden underneath and two eggs on top. Horrible but I guess that's my mistake for ordering something I'm not familiar with but I would've appreciated a kick to it. Luckily the blue haired girl noticed my drink was empty but that was all I saw of her other than to drop my check off which is bad because I was her only table. I won't be back."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite breakfast place, and my twins not only behaved but they ate very well.  It was awesome to see them eat almost all their food.  I shared 1/2 a portion of the caramelized bananas and pecans brioche french toast with the hubby and had the egg whites asparagus omelet with home fries.  My hubby like my home fries better than his hash browns.  I am sure we will be back soon, there is so much we want to try."}
{"text":"This place is one of the worst places I've been to we sat at the bar for over 30 minuets and when we told the server we were ready she said I'm not ready I have to serve this other customer.....and then she continued to ignore us. This place should get new servers or just shut the doors if their not in it for customer service...."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast this morning. The fresh squeezed orange juice was amazing. Food was ok and the service was average. Waited at least 15 minutes to get our check when we were done as the waitress was too busy chatting up a man dining alone at the bar."}
{"text":"New to town and was thrilled with the menu selections. Bright casual atmosphere. A bit noisy. Great coffee and very friendly staff initially. Today was apparently an anomaly as a shortage in the kitchen meant over an hour wait for food and our server disappeared after taking our order- leaving us to fend for ourselves.Many upset customers  Wouldve been nice for them to inform us of kitchen issue. Not sure if we will try again."}
{"text":"I will no longer visit this location, as I am so spoiled by the phoenix staff, food, and overall experience that I cannot subject myself to this location ever again. I have given it three chances to win me over, but on all occasions there have been issues with the visit. I am unsure if it is due to being in Gilbert, which does not scream standards, unless of course your measuring stick is being married with three kids, but something is consistently wrong, so I must bid this location adieu.   Food quality & Consistency is sub par.  Staff is unfriendly, and twice has tried to hustle our party out by bringing the check prior to it being asked for and without our food being finished from our plates.   No refills offered, which is weird given that I believed it customary to at least ask once the level of liquid in a cup reaches a certain level.     Check came out with the wrong charges even after I corrected the server (not a big deal, but come on)  Hostess seated us behind a swinging door to the patio even with multiple other tables being an option; Although, Some were dirty (clean them! It's pretty standard to do so when customers leave)  I hate to rip an establishment I love, but this place has missed the mark entirely. I feel the expansion and popularity of Over Easy has killed what I once loved about the business."}
{"text":"The go to spot for a great breakfast served by even better people!  Even after the move the plate I order is delish and made to order per usual. Try the chicken fried steak and Hash-browns (ask for crispy) also order an extra side of gravy! Its packed with meaty goodness. For those who are not pleased with the food, people or atmosphere I'd like to know where else they can go and be greeted by the owners, have your order remembered and leave with a large to go coffee for free?   PS. Sweet Potato Tator Tots!!!! Heck yes they got em"}
{"text":"I haven't had anything here that I didn't like, staff is very friendly, and I love the atmosphere. By far my favorite local breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Probably the best, no drama breakfast you'll get nesr Paradise Valley.  Great little patio area that's dog friendly and there's nothing like a brand new modern take on breafast and lunch bistro.  Best menu item for me is the Wolf Pack Over Easy, but definitely try the Eggs Benedict or a great omelette!"}
{"text":"Nice build-out.  The eggs benedict was rather bland.    There are a lot of new breakfast places in the area.   Over Easy is one of them. Overall, it reminds me of North TX...it's just a little bit south of OK."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here one morning because of the recommendation of the place on Fieri's show.  My friend had the french toast and I ordered the chicken fried steak.  The chicken fried steak was good but nothing out of the ordinary.  It was a bit salty for my taste though.  The food item to brag about is the sausage.  We split the sausages that were coated with waffle batter.  Now those were interesting.  However, I felt that the sausages all by itself was the best.  Portions were generous and I would definitely like to try this place again just for the sausages."}
{"text":"Decided to give this one a second chance at their new location. Much better then the last time.  There were three of us this trip our order consisted of:  Traditional Eggs Benedict English muffin topped with ham  Loco Moko - a Hamburger patty on top of white rice, covered with brown mushroom gravy, topped with 2 eggs any style and crispy fried onions. - a Hawaiian favorite!   Chicken fried steak with country gravy, egg* & choice of potato  The food was hot, fresh and tasted good."}
{"text":"So I really wanted to like this place.. it's cute, super-packed, and had some good looking and original menu items.   It was just too busy and service was not as good as I hoped. I didn't get a coffee refill until I asked for the check.   I ordered the Wolf Pack, which is two eggs sandwhiched between hashbrowns with bacon and cheese.  My hashbrowns were a little undercooked, and I really don't like soggy hashbrowns. Other than that, it was delicious though.   My friend ordered the brioched french toast. When she asked our waitress what 'brioched' meant, the waitress told us it was just normal french toast... that really did not impress me. My friend said it was absolutely delicious though, some of the best french toast she's ever had.   I'll try this place again, since it's so close to home,  and its possible I just visited on an off day.  It's a tad dissapointing after visiting valley greats like Matt's Big Breakfast. Over-easy could be Arcadia's version of Matt's, with some work.   Plan on waiting for at least 15-20 minutes, as this place is PACKED. I went there at 8:30 on a Saturday morning and it was totally full and there was already a wait!"}
{"text":"This really is as good as it gets for Bkfst outside your home here in Phx. LOVE their blueberry pancakes and of course the wolfpack (hash browns, eggs, bacon, cheese) so filling! Great service this morning.   Looks like the menu has expanded since my last visit which was ages ago. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"First time at Over Easy. Arrived at 7 on a Thursday morning and was the only customer. In this area, the retirees (there's a lot around here) sleep in. It was bright egg-yolk yellow inside and out, with a big Diner formica Counter.   I ordered the Corned Beef Benedict with Hash Browns and water. It came to $12.43 plus tip. As I ate, 2 more folks arrived.   My breakfast arrived in 12 mins, a bit slow for the only customer. My Benedict was ample in size and laced with grilled white onions. I love onions but the dish was 50% onion, so I could barely taste the beef. Good idea, poor execution. The hash browns were a course grate and crunchy, just right. The hollandaise was spot on.   The service was fine, with a good amount of attention whilst he set up the front of the restaurant. The kitchen crew was pretty loud tho, and due to the silent tv's, was distracting.   I'll try Over Easy again but opt for a different menu item."}
{"text":"We love the service and food. The staff is always friendly. Daniela always takes care of us and remembers us by name!!! It's our favorite breakfast place."}
{"text":"So here's a rundown.  Little Niece LOVED her M&M's pancakes.  Big Niece ordered the basic 2 egg, bacon, hash browns and toast and was a happy little camper with it.  One brother loved his Wolfpack and who wouldn't?  2 eggs, bacon & cheese sandwiched within two crispy layers of hash browns.  Yum!  The other brother thought the chicken fried steak was just okay.  The girls' mother liked her country benedict with a sausage patty, eggs and hollandaise sauce but didn't realize it was on a cheddar jalapeno biscuit.  That part wasn't her favorite.  As for me, I didn't care for the corned beef hash especially the texture.  Luckily I had also ordered a half order of the caramelized banana and pecan French toast.  Heavenly.  Plus I always love restaurants that allow half orders of French toast because then I can have a savory entree with a \"dessert\" without feeling like a pig for ordering two entrees.   And we all had to have the waffle dogs.  Its all the Food Network's fault.  And we are thankful to them for it.  It was delicious especially with the \"waffle dog\" sauce the servers set up - pancake syrup with hot sauce."}
{"text":"This place was packed and very loud. The food was good and ample. Everyone had leftovers. The chillaquilles had diced chicken and packed a little spicy kick, it easily was enough for 3 meals. The omelets were fluffy and fresh. My mom said the cheddar jalapeño biscuits were good although when I tasted hers it seemed dry. Loved their jelly options of mango or raspberry. Service was decent. We might come back but will  probably choose other breakfast restaurants that aren't so loud that it makes conversation impossible rather than this location."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast while in the area.  Excellent food, service and clean. I had the Chicken Fried Steak with hash browns and two eggs. Everything on the plate was excellent. My only complaint was with me. I spilled gravy on my shirt and my shirt did not appreciate it as much as my taste buds."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Such a funky, cool place. My food was amazing I got chicken and waffles and sweet potato tots!!! Mimosas were great and large potions of food. Taste like home!!! I will be going back for sure!!! Come early fills up quick!!! And they sure can cook a damn good egg!!!"}
{"text":"2 words, Moko Loko. I found myself driving around and waiting in Gilbert (its a work thing). I saw Over Easy, pulled in, called co-workers and told them to meet me there. I have been to several other Over Easys and as of yet, no bad meals or experiences. This time was no different, I ordered the Moko Loko for the first time, it was really good. I even took a picture of it to send to a Samoan friend, to gloat. I'm paying for it now, my body wants to take a nap very badly. I also cannot forget to mention the OJ, so, so good. Anyway, if you are near any of the OE looking for breakfast, do not hesitate."}
{"text":"The restaurant is bright and clean, the food is good and the staff is very friendly. What a great way to start your day!  We started with the iced coffee, a strawberry rosemary lemonade and a Sprite. My sons sprite had a bug in it but they were great about replacing it without making a fuss. My husband loved his copy and I found the lemonade to decent but not overwhelming flavorful. The food on the other hand was great, I had the waffle dogs which were fabulous little sausages covered in pancake batter. Savory and sweet deliciousness! My husband had the banana nut French toast which he he loved and my son ordered the Cubano breakfast sandwich which was HUGE! The flavors in it were all great but it is beyond messy to try and eat with your hands so he finally gave up and went at it with his fork and knife.  We can't wait to go back and try some other items on the menu."}
{"text":"honestly i wasnt that impressed. The  chicken fried steak was featured on diners driveins and dives? ive had much better back in Mn at the windmill cafe my local greasy spoon. Honestly i wouldn't go back"}
{"text":"Actually, pretty good! I ordered the \"Hopple Popple\" which is a mix of ham, onions, peppers and eggs mixed up with eggs scrambled and all is put on the grill. The only thing I would have loved to put it over the top is some good ol' Cheddar Cheese because it needed seasoning and that salty cheddar would have been great. I would have also added in Jalapeños for some spice instead of dripping on Cholula.  Lots of other \"different\" menu items to choose from so be prepared to read.  As a suggestion to moment who might read the review involved in Over  Easy operations a cole suggestions are turn the music down a little. With the hard floors and open area it's difficult to carry on a conversation. The menu would be much better served with photos of e menu items so people can decide easier what they want or may want to add to a dish. Visuals go a long ways."}
{"text":"Thought this would alot better than it was.  Was pretty much a lackluster breakfast with an over $30 price tag and a long wait.  We did order a Papago Orange Blossom beer to be fair but that was the best part of the whole meal.  Our waitress was a doll though, very sweet girl.  Overall:  Doesn't live up to the hype."}
{"text":"wolfpack! salted caramelized brioche french toast with toasted walnuts! awesome! great staff extremely helpful! we will be back!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing!  Service was poor, at best. Server did not come to take order for 10 minutes!  Food quality was poor! Example: Avocado toast, stale bread, watery heavily salted avocado!"}
{"text":"Walked into the restaurant at 8 am on a Sunday.  No one at the hostess stand; not even any greeting from the servers.  Finally a server came up and gave us menus and told us to seat ourselves.  If that is the usual, at least have a sign stating such.  When seated, Jamie asked if we wanted anything to drink.  We ordered two coffees and a bloody mary.  The coffee came, and there were flecks of something in the coffee...coating the side of the cup.  Not knowing what they were, we asked Jamie to bring us new cups of coffee.  No apology or explanation, she eventually brought two more cups of coffee.  One of them still had flecks of something in them.  At that point my partner just told her to take the coffee away and not to bring another.  The coffee that I received was ok, but there was never a refill.   For a breakfast place, I would think that coffee would be the first priority.  During the entire time that we ate breakfast and when Jamie took away the dishes, there was not ever the any coffee refills.  The breakfast was ok, but they should get the basics down first!"}
{"text":"Went here while we were staying in Arizona. Food was awesome and our waiter Corey was boss as hell. Would definitely go here again."}
{"text":"If you are not here by 9 am or so, expect a wait. Even the call ahead for a large group was futile. We still had to wait 30 minutes. Definitely try the Wolfpack if you are watching your figure, Your figure expand!! This thing is awesome! The brioche french toast is delish as is the Hopple Popple and the Over Easy...i think that is what it is called with brioche, spinach and poached egg. Sometimes things come out in pieces like sides first, then entrees or vice versa. Patio seating nice too."}
{"text":"Came here hoping to support local business which I did by dining. The food is mediocre I would like in it to the taste of International House of Pancakes the service is subpar and definitely need some better training I was not completely disappointed with my visit as it was not the worst food that I've ever had. I do recommend many other restaurants in the Gilbert area for breakfast with better flavor and better service not a complete fail but certainly close to it"}
{"text":"OK but not great.  Chicken and waffles dish had a tough piece of chicken deep fried in what must have been several days old grease.  It was terrible.  The maple syrup was so watery - a give away that suggested it was some cheap liquid soap-like stand in from Cisco or worse, Costco.  Go someplace else - go anywhere else."}
{"text":"As many others, I came seeking the famed Caramelized banana and pecan brioche French toast. When I saw it on the Food Network show, it looked amazingly delicious!!   When I saw it on my plate, it resembled something that came out of a sick babys diaper.  The caramel sauce both smelled and tasted burned, it seemed that the bananas were cooked in with the sauce, but the pecans did seem to be in bite size pieces.  My mother opted for the Chilaquiles- a mixture of tortillas, ranchero sauce chicken, sour cream &cheese served with 1 egg..any style***** Pure Deliciousness!!!!!!!!!! I sent back my mess of a plate for a half plate of plain ol' french toast and proceeded to take over her food!  If you go, get the Chilaquiles!!!!  You will not be disappointed!! Steer clear of the banana pecan french toast!!"}
{"text":"VERY good service here even if you come during the busiest hours! I forgot the name of the gal that was helping us but she made sure to constantly check in on us, refill our water, ask us how our food was, and even made the best recommendation!  FOOD: Chicken and waffles - the waffles are a bit on the softer side and not so much crisp. But the chicken really made up for it. I really enjoyed the breading and even though it was white meat, I still enjoyed it! Don't forget to ask for a side of hash browns!  Banana nut french toast - this dish was OK. I felt like the french toast did not have the best consistentcy - it was not thick and did not hold shape very well. It sort of tasted like it may have been sitting out for a bit. The nuts on it were cracked and sprinkled over, unlike what i saw on the show \"Diners, Drive-in's and Dives!  DRINK: Strawberry lemonade - it was just OK. A little watery and not enough lemonade in it - wish it was a little more tart!  SERVICE: This makes up for everything! Service here is the best - doesn't matter what time you come! Staff is friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"You can tell the ingredients are fresh. I ordered the Chicken and waffles and while the chicken was definitely not process or frozen, it was pretty bland. Even with the syrup, I felt like chicken could have used a little bit more pizazz. I did appreciate the freshness. I'm from Georgia so I take my fried chicken seriously.   The GM is great and very friendly. You can tell he is very involved in the operation of this place. Also, his beard is probably the most majestic thing I've ever seen. Seriously. It's beautiful.   The bus boy(man?) was a little too eager to take our plates. I had barely set my utensils down and he snatched it up. While we were waiting for our food, he kept coming around and picking up our straw wrappers and whatever little bits of trash on the table. Thanks for keep my area clean but please wait or ask if you can take any trash or plates. I felt a little rushed out considering it took 30mins for our food.   Overall, I'd come back. Mostly to get another glance at that beard."}
{"text":"I stare at the menu of so many great options and just can't get past the Thanksgiving Waffle!  It's a perfect, one-stop shop of a breakfast.   They cook the stuffing herbs into the waffle, load up layers of turkey slices, gravy and cranberry sauce for a savory sweet experience.  Cute diner atmosphere.  Friendly service.  Lots of regulars..."}
{"text":"The banana pecan french toast was great - order a 1/2 order and split it with someone else for \"breakfast desert\"!  Rest of the food was definitely better than ok, but dropped my review to 3 stars because restrooms weren't clean and had no hand soap -- where are employees washing their hands???"}
{"text":"The first time I went here the place was crowded, the wait was long, and it was hot as balls outside where we had to wait.  But boy was it worth it.  Chicken fried steak for breakfast? Yes please. Great coffee too. We'll be back."}
{"text":"I was very underwhelmed by this place, especially in light of all the breakfast competition in the immediate surrounding area. The food was ok, the service subpar. The decor was intended to mimic a 50s diner, but in place of the warmness you might expect from such an effort, it felt rather cold, inauthentic, plastic, industrial. Not the worst restaurant experience, but not quite satisfactory enough to warrant a second visit."}
{"text":"We were so excited to have breakfast at Over Easy. Unfortunately, our anticipation quickly waned. I ordered the Chicken and Waffles. (Which was featured on tv Best Things Ever Ate\" per their menu. The waffle was \"meh\" but after cutting into the boneless breaded chicken...the meat was a greenish-gray and looked \"old\" ... Took another cut to see the same inside. See attached photo! The polite server returned at the end of our meal. He saw I had not eaten it, he asked if it was okay. I reported to him the off color meat. He apologized but did zero to inform the manager. We will not be back. The service was a four star the overall food a 1. Two stars was generous."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in the valley. The one downside is long long wait times, but the food is worth it! Friendly servers as well."}
{"text":"The thing with breakfast places is that most of them are offering many of the same menu items (and let's face it, eggs and toast are not that difficult to make well), so the way for them to stand out is with interesting combinations, lower prices, exceptional atmosphere, and great service.  As far as I can tell, Over Easy has none of these.  The first room kind of has a cool unfinished look with a nice counter.  Unfortunately, I was seated in the other room, which is carpeted (eww) and has a tv.  I felt like I was in the kids room or something.    The menu is nothing special and also not a bargain.  Most of the combos came with meat so I asked if I could substitute something else instead.  The waitress said I could get fruit, and I took her up on that.  When the bill came I saw that sure enough, she charged me extra for the fruit.    In summary:  Meh.  I've experienced better."}
{"text":"Waffle Dogs are out of this world. Will dine here as often as we are in Phoenix"}
{"text":"Came here & was seated at the counter which was actually really nice, the counter was plenty spacious vs some others where you feel like you're rubbing elbows with the people next to you. I had the chicken & waffles which were some of the best I've had. The batter was light & crispy, it didn't fall off which is a total score in my book. The waffle had the perfect amount of sweetness to go with the salty crispy chicken. Delish! My husband tried their chamomile tea which was actual tea leaves vs bagged tea. We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"After a long search for a great brunch location that also serves breakfast alcohol and is delicious, I finally found Over Easy!  My first encounter here gave me a delicious mimosa, and the Wild Pack (eggs over a heaping plate of hash browns and cheese, with bacon) and it was amazing.  Not to mention the few bites I was allowed to have from my husband's chicken and waffles (I almost asked to change my order, because of those bites).  Oh, and the service was on point!   Since then, I've been back several times, with my mom, cousin, brother, friends, and it's just as good every time!  I highly recommend the chicken and waffles, and the breakfast sandwich.   And did I mention that they squeeze their orange juice in house?  It's amazing!"}
{"text":"Not very good.  Service wasn't very good. Waitress wasn't that friendly.  Pancakes were terrible, hashbrowns had no taste to them and a large OJ was $6!! WHAT THE?! My husband got the chiliqilas (sp?) and they were really good! I wouldn't go here again."}
{"text":"Been here before and thought it was ok-good. Saw the piece on Diners drive ins and dives and wanted to try it again. The place was packed, and I had to wait for a table, but after 10 min or so got a nice one inside with a view of the kitchen. I order ed the chicken fried steak, my friend had the wolf pack. The food took about 15 minutes, but came out hot and looked great. My chicken fried steak was one of the best Ive ever had. the hash browns were great too. Not to salty, but perfectly crisp. Speaking of hash browns, the wolf pack was loaded down with them. very good, but I was glad I stuck with the chicken. Staff was friendly and the place is cool. ill be back for sure."}
{"text":"okay, so it took me a while to get to this place. it's normally always closed when im in the area, but finally my seester & i made it! the place is located in an old Taco Bell bulding (the retro type) so you can totally enjoy the outside patio without much outside interference. we arrived just before the last hour was up, so we got seated right away. unfortunately the momentum of the servers was already exhausted, because it took about 45 minutes for our breakfast, and it took about half that time to place our order. there wasn't ever anyone around, except for the bussers (who didn't speak a lick'o english-or so they pretended) we even overheard two other tables complaining about not being approached for drinks or the initial order for 20 minutes, and we couldn't help but laugh at how long they would be there after placing their order!  the food was deo, but my sister had to go hunt down syrup for her stack. i noticed the bar a little too late, next time we will sit there. it looked as though those servers inside knew what they were doing.   i asked for coffee with a lot of cream, got the coffee with room for only 1 creamer, no cream and i had to get into a spanish convo with the busser because she didn't understand CREAM, totally forgot to ad the \"A\" and say \"CREAMA\" my bad.   i must say that the prices are good, the food looked and tasted good (after it finally arrived) just don't expect to have a server, you'll have to bring in your own condiments and fetch your own coffee. dang they must have had a \"phat breakfast\" (received lotso' tips) that day....because by the time we arrived, they had all quit for the day. it was a totall out of body experience for them, I'm sure, because i seen people wearing the uniforms. if you go visit this place make sure you arrive just as the crowd is winding down, not much later, or you'll have to don your apron.  UPDATE- just found out Aaron May owns this restaurant; funny thing is at his other place they are outstanding when it comes to customer service."}
{"text":"Look.  I don't know about Brad or the Taco Bell spot or whatever...  this place has about 20 tables, does really great breakfast and had decent (if they sometimes need reminding) service.  Honestly, for $30 for 2... it's awesome.  Had a sausage / bacon / cheddar omelet which was amazing and just what I wanted.  They have these lemon ricotta pancakes which were awesome and they generally do a great job of basics plus some really cool breakfasty enhancements.   Cool place for families where they turn the tables fast, keep the coffee filled and basically do whatever they can to be somewhere between diner and pretentious brunch (can you hear me Matt's Big Breakfast?).  Love this place and will come back over and over and over and over."}
{"text":"I have never experienced such a rude staff! First, the wait was pretty long on the Sunday morning we visited this restaurant, as to be expected, so my sister decided to grab some coffee as we waited. When she asked a server if the restaurant could make caffe latte's, she was told she should go to Starbucks for those things. Interesting response. I then asked if we could add an additional chair to our table of five, and they looked at me as if I should leave because that might be too much work. I ended up finding my own chair when nobody was willing to help me. Last, to top things off, we actually watched the manager of the restaurant ask two women sitting at a table next to us to leave because he had people waiting outside to eat! They hadn't even finished their meals!! I will never return to such poor service and overrated food."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointing. Took forever to get a simple egg, hashbrown and toast breakfast.  Toast was cold , didnt even melt the butter , the rest of the food was semi warm. For a 25.00 breakfast it wasnt worth it."}
{"text":"I liked this place.  The ambiance is very industrial.  The location is good.  The service was very good.  The mint lemonade is over priced and just okay.  (No free refills for $3.25).  The waffle dog was just okay.  The sausage was good but it just tasted like a pancake or something wrapped around it.  The wolf pack with corned beef instead of bacon and swiss cheese was good.  My least favorite part was the hash browns.  I liked that they were crispy on the outside but they must have been a little to thick or something because they were mushy inside.  I would like to go back and try the banana brioche french toast."}
{"text":"This location is definitely a diner you must try out. We came in after the gym for a healthy breakfast, and I was able to find the Avocado Benedict to eat as I'm trying to eat little to no carbs.   I did not put the hollandaise sauce on it and it was freaking amazing. It came with toast as well. You do have the option to add potatoes or tomatoes as a side.  The only thing that I would recommend is that they clean their tables a little bit better and that someone keeps an eye out on the bathroom as it was a little dirty.  I'm not a big breakfast person but if I was to go out to breakfast I would definitely come back for the Avocado Benedict."}
{"text":"Was craving chicken and waffles and saw that they had it on the menu- being that this is so close to home thought we would try it instead of LoLo's. What a mistake! Not sure how you can make waffles that have no taste but they did and the chicken was no better. Our server took our order never came back except to give us the check. Next time I will make the drive."}
{"text":"4 stars for the food and prices.  All of their food looks good and some stuff is pretty unique.  I had their homemade corned beef hash with some eggs and rye toast that never came.  My wife had the Pollo Loco omelet which was good as well.  Good stuff and reasonable prices.  However, if you enjoy the following, Over Easy is probably the place for you.  * a crappy parking situation * a 20 minute wait (which isn't that bad if the place is worth it) * being so crammed in that you are basically sitting on top of the people next to you * being ridiculously hot because they couldn't spring for more/better fans or an outdoor A/C thing (my fault for going in September but tons of people were standing in line to be crammed and hot so I thought I could stick it out) * bad service (god forbid they ask you if everything is ok, if you need anything else, or want a refill on anything but water)  Oh and if my server is reading this, I am still waiting on my toast you said, \"would be right out\"."}
{"text":"I've had pancakes here, which are pretty good - two are more than enough for me.  But - they have the Best traditional breakfast. For few times in a row, I've ordered the bacon, eggs, hash browns and toast breakfast. So far it has been consistent - bacon crisp but not burnt. Scrambled eggs not too runny and not too dry. Hash browns actually edible, crispy but not greasy, yummy along side the eggs.  Toast with your choice of jam. Oh oh - I'm ready for breakfast!  Again."}
{"text":"I came to Over Easy feeling very excited and having very high expectations!  it was suggested by my boyfriend who saw the place being featured on the food network.. Considering that it was a Sunday morning, I didn't mind the 20-25 minute wait.  I figured that it will be all worth it!  For my drink, I was torn between the lemonade with mint and the raspberry lemonade with rosemary so I asked to try both.  I chose the second one but didn't really end up liking it that much.  After a few sips I felt like the flavors didn't really blend too well.  The rosemary was overwhelming.  I took it home and took a while to finish the whole thing.  I drank water during breakfast instead.    I picked the house made corned beef hash which came with 2 eggs and a toasted sourdough.  Corned beef was fresh!! - out of the can!.. the best part of my meal was the egg made over easy!  and the bread was good but Matt's big breakfast sourdough bread is better.  The bf ordered the chicken fried steak which came with a waffle.  He was just equally disappointed..    Service was good and the place was trendy (although tiny).  But other than the hype that was caused by Guy from food network, I don't think this place lives up to it.  Not really worth checking out, I'd rather go to Matt's."}
{"text":"Everything was awesome. Well worth the wait! I loved the chicken fried steak. Coffee was tasty as well. Great kids menu.  Will return again and again."}
{"text":"BACON SAUCE!!!!!   It's mention in the menu peaked my curiosity and honestly tasted good for a couple of bites. But by the end of the brioche I started feeling pretty queezy from the hog fat overload. And I can't help but feel a little out of sorts when I think about Over Easy since. The brioche was also pretty frickin tiny for being on their \"entree\" menu. Maybe bacon sauce is elsewhere without my knowledge, but it seems like a bizarre and gratuitous invention that should be avoided unless you're are heavily intoxicated.  So why do I still go four stars on this place? Probably the time and care put into everything they bring out to you. The menu is ambitious, so I guess they do have time to concentrate, but there is just something to a perfectly made hearty pancake from the right ingredients.  So  I guess this is where you come for no-nonsense breakfast food made perfectly, but as said before, the prices just don't make a lot of sense when you have to keep ordering things a la carte to work off that hangover. Although maybe not as stupid as their 1130 a.m. closing time, even on weekends when hoards of people are still driving up and trying to get a table at noon."}
{"text":"If I could give them less than 1 star I would. I guess you say the politeness of our server is the reason for the star. Let me start with our reaction could a result of our expectations. With that being said, the final products were almost inedible. My wife and I really thought what was offered on the menu sounded tasty and full of promise. And that MAY be the case, but the execution was as bad as I have ever had. I do not tend to be very tough on my reviews, in fact, I think I'm a little easy to please for the most part. Let's face it, food is supposed to enjoyed and taste good.   My wife ordered the Wolf Pack, a hash brown layered breakfast with the essentials sandwiched between two layers of hash browns. What came out was an over fried pile of mess. The hash browns were so fried that they were not edible. I ordered the chicken fried steak,  a \"favored\" dish, according to the menu, by Guy Fieri on Drive ins, Diners, and Dive. Well if they served him what the served me, he would have left immediately. The steak was so overly cooked that it took several minutes to simply cut it. Additionally, I received the same over cooked hash browns as my wife with the exception of the 1/3 of the correct portion. Which our server said that more was coming out. When they did come out (20 minutes later), these while being actually edible, were under cooked... How do you under cook potatoes in 20 minutes. More over NOTHING was seasoned properly or at all. The gravey was bland and had a floury taste to it.   When we got there (11am on a Friday), there was literally 3 other tables being served beside us and it took a considerable amount of time (at least 20 minutes) to get our order.  Bottom line our experience was not acceptable. After all the poor execution they over charged me for OJ... We were so disappointed with everything we didn't even ask for anything to be fixed. We simply will not be returning. Come on people, breakfast isn't that hard."}
{"text":"Service was quick and friendly. I had a mimosa, avocado protein toast, and sweet potato tots. One of the best meals I've ever had"}
{"text":"This is a great place! They have bright yellow walls with pigs and paintings hanging on them. Good air conditioning. Cow umbrellas hanging from the ceiling and all are for sale!  I had the over easy egg bennie toast, it was an egg over easy on top of fresh spinach with a toast underneath smothered in smooth gravy sauce with bacon slices around it. It was delicious and hit the spot! I even tried my boyfriends Chilequilles and they were SO good!! Just the right amount of cheese, egg, and tortillas with green tomatillo sauce. There was a guy walking around asking every customer if everything was OK and if they had a problem he would quickly resolve it, come to find out it was the owner, he even came to our table and with a big smile asked how everything was. We replied with a big \"It's Excellent\" as I stuffed food in my mouth. Great staff with excellent customer service, greeted you right away with a smile."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place. We sat outside and where overrun at points by flies. The food was decent, although the pairing of avocado and ricotta on the avocado toast takes away from the avocado. Also throwing the chocolate chips on regular pancakes and calling them chocolate chip makes it technically accurate but lazy. The server had a bit of an attitude with serving us coffee and taking orders but he was attentive. We expected just a bit more."}
{"text":"We drove from Avondale to the Arcadia location, waited over 20 minutes and were bumped when a 5 top a waitress knew came in and asked for her. We were fed some line about how they were on the list, left before their name was called and it's policy to seat people that do that ahead of those that were waiting at the restaurant.  The name she pointed to was a party of 4. Customer service is lacking. Every other restaurant i know of, and have worked for, has the policy that if you're not there when your name is called it is crossed off and you go to the end of the line. The food is good but we don't wait an hour to be treated like that.  We ended up leaving without being seated and going to Taylor's."}
{"text":"Hey good go to breakfast place in Gilbert Arizona. They have changed the menu and all looks delicious. Good space to sit down and just relax a cup of joe."}
{"text":"This place is so delicious! $5 mimosas and best French toast I've ever had  real gem!"}
{"text":"I have gone here twice and had two very different experiences.  The first time I went was when they first opened. This place allows you to sit where you want and has a very laid back atmosphere. The decor is the mix of industrial with a classic kitchen twist.   The tap water isn't the best so make sure you get a good drink while you are there. the cold brew is a little expensive for the price, the assorted juices were a better choice for us.   The food seems very hit or miss. The first time we went, we had the chicken fried steak, biscuits and reeses pieces pancakes. All of the food was absolute perfection.   The second time we went, we had the eggs Benedict and the ham steak as well as the biscuits. The biscuits this time were very dry and didn't resemble the ones we had on opening weekend. I'm not sure if they changed the recipe or if it's a new cook but I was a little disappointed. The eggs Benedict had a very different sauce than what I've had on eggs Benedict before. It was very bland and also disappointing. Lastly, my fiance had egg shells left in his eggs, which was unpleasant.  I would love to give this place a higher rating but I think the food quality has gone down. I'm hoping that it was just an off day because I did love their food. If you are going to try anything get the chicken fried steak for sure."}
{"text":"Really went in with high hopes for this place. Hadn't ever been and I love a good brunch location.  Went around 1pm this Sunday and was sat next to the hostess stand to have the displeasure of the young, unprofessional hostess nearly the entire time. She made a constant gripe about not wanting to be there, squatting down, even asking us at one point, \"Why would you want breakfast at 1pm?\" All in all, the hostess made it very clear we were inconveniencing her by coming in to eat.  In addition, our bearded server had to make two attempts to get our drinks and only really came back to give is our checks - which, in his defense there were  two cuties at the bar (that had already been served) that he'd rather give his attention to. My boyfriend's beard wasn't as impressive as his and I skipped out on the heavy makeup - how could we compete, right? All in all, service-wise the place was uncomfortably poor.  Whatever, I still had some hope for the food. Ordered the chilequiles because it's a classic breakfast favorite of mine.  I'll almost always order it if it's on a menu of a place I've never tried before. Basically,  what I got was a plate of cheesy nachos with eggs on top. What the serious F?   The side of hashbrowns I ordered would have been great if I hadn't put their ketchup on it. Why oh why did I stray from the Chollula?! It's clear after opening their ketchup bottles and smelling that they hadn't cleaned them in a long while, if not ever. It smelled rotten and made me queezy knowing I used it on my hashbrowns.   At that point, the whole experience was ruined for me and I was more full of disappointment than their food. A hostess that shouldn't be in the food and bev industry, a server with other things on his mind, breakfast nachos mislead to be called Chilequiles, and ketchup bottles not cleaned since who knows when...no way am I going back."}
{"text":"I love this place... i had something that was the greatest hangover meal ever.... it had bacon, eggs, cheese, and hash browns all mixed together.  they also have fresh squeezed OJ which i always a nice touch for breakie...  though to go with  a large group but solo at the bar is nice... you should check this place out..."}
{"text":"OKAY..Ive now been here a few times.. location good.. but, Im not nuts over this place. I have to have poached eggs if Im splurging on breakfast.. sent them back once to have them poached, NOT overdone cooked.. The second time they came back over done, I just sucked it up and dealt with it.. hashbrowns were overdone.. but the coffee was awesome..and the pancakes on my friends plate, looked huge and yummy...IM just not a huge carb girl ! The place is packed pretty much every time I go and Ive waited every time:-) so its popular. AND I just cant sit on a patio in the summer! SO I wait for a indoor table..  Staff.. IDK she didnt seem to be overly concerned with my poached egg issue:-)"}
{"text":"This the third time ive been here and they've run out of coffee.      I qould come more often if i could bring a starbucks or something with me.  The swrver was very good however the food comes out for each oerson at different times.   Im done before my granddaughter gets her food  and we all know never feed a kid first.  That way they can complain and be unhappy.  Tried this place 5 times .... never again"}
{"text":"This morning I chose the green chili with grits and an egg, it was delicious. My wife had the chicken and waffles which I stole a bite of and it was also delicious. We came around 8 on a Saturday and there weren't many patrons here, by the time We left the place had filled up but it didn't look like more than a 5-10 minute wait time."}
{"text":"At best, all I can say is that I'm not an \"Over Easy\" fan.  I've been to this location twice and will never go again.  Their service was good; we sat outside in their patio both times.  My first time there was with my wife and she ordered one of their omelets (I don't remember which one) that she thought was not very good.  I had what they called \"Chilaquiles\" which is a mixture of tortillas, ranchero sauce, chicken, sour cream and cheddar cheese topped with 2 eggs.  This sounded wonderful.  Unfortunately it was simply a couple eggs served over what seemed to be low-grade packaged 'Tortilla Chips'; although I was told they were homemade.  They had melted some cheese and put sauce and sour cream on top of it, but it was (in my opinion) awful.  I ate less than half of it.  I was so sorry I had selected this.    A month later I had a friend that wanted to go there.  I told him my previous experience, but he'd heard great things about this place and was insistent that we go.  I ordered there \"House Made Corned Beef Hash\" which was so salty I again couldn't finish but half of my order.  My friend looked over their menu (which includes a lot of fancy names for standard items) and asked \"Do you have anything like a breakfast burrito?\"  The waitress said they did but it was under sandwiches and was called their \"Selena.\"  That's what he ordered.  When our wait person left he asked me \"why didn't they simply call it a breakfast burrito rather than attempt to make it sound foo-foo?\"  I responded \"You're the one that wanted to come here.\"  I, my wife and my friend will never go back.  This place is definitely for the more sophisticated, higher-class Scottsdale folks.  Not low-lives like me."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this breakfast spot!  We sat on the patio and took in the view.  The food was really good!  I had a breakfast sandwich called the Dolly.  My friend had the Mediterranean omelet.  We both really enjoyed our food.  My friend commented that the coffee was really good.  The waitress was really attentive and nice.  Great experience all around!  We are so glad we found this spot for breakfast via Yelp!  I want to mention they're only open until noon."}
{"text":"Portion sizes are huggeee.  I left the restaurant so satisfied and jolly.    Service is a bit slow, but it is a pretty popular place. I was lucky enough to get a table for 3 without waiting.  If I had come in 10 minutes later than I did, my namy would have been on the wait list.  Food is great.  Very comforting and everything that you think breakfast should be.  There are a few healthy options that looked great, but I have to still with the hearty, traditional breakfast.    BTW, their tater tots are amazing!!"}
{"text":"Wowzers!  Good food but seriously, $5.00 for grapefruit juice and $3.00 for toast to go with your breakfast. Breakfast for two with tip. $48. This included one serving (one not one each) of eggs, bacon, hash browns, coffee, toast, juice and thin pancakes that were not filling. Nothing special. Now Off my list as it costs too much."}
{"text":"Over Easy is a cute space bursting with light and pops of color tucked away in a shopping center plaza. The design of the restaurant is inviting and their various signage playing on the logo format adds a nice cohesiveness.   The menu has a lot of standard breakfast fare mixed with some more unique choices like waffle dogs and eggs benedict with avocado halves replacing the usual English muffin. I personally enjoyed their addition of creamy, fresh ricotta on the avocado toast. I also appreciated their use of local coffee roaster, Press.  The only downside? Having to see Guy Fieri's giant picture in the restaurant and emblazoned on the back of the servers' shirts. I get that a feature on Food Network is a cool accomplishment and a nice marketing point, but seeing his frosted tips first thing in the morning is never enjoyable."}
{"text":"i just returned from Over Easy and I'm a fan.  The man (referred to by other reviewers) who runs the place was very courteous and not only did he help us get seated, he also checked on us during our meal and made a point to say goodbye when we left.  (and it's Sunday Morning)  Food I had their mushroom,cheddar, and scallions Omlette and it was delicious!  They use the 'standard' mushroom and 2 other varieties I couldn't identify *the identification issue is on my part, not theirs :)  The omlette was cooked perfectly and was big enough for 2 people to split.  The Coffee was good for breakfast shop coffee.  Not burned or weak.. I even got a cup to go.  So, to the 2 start haters out there I say: \"Lighten up, and enjoy life Over Easy\"."}
{"text":"Amy is THE best! We come here just to see her. The food is awesome and the energy is great!! And the GM John is always very helpful too."}
{"text":"Our third time here given we are new to the East Valley. Food is very good but service was ridiculously poor today. All service members we encounter didn't listen and out omelet was lukewarm - cheese was almost solid. Many choices as a consumer, will likely not be back for a good long while."}
{"text":"I loved the ice coffee and everything I've ordered here has been fantastic! Is my go to breakfast joint while in this area."}
{"text":"We were really looking forward to going here for a very late breakfast after church.  We got there at 12:45.  The place was pretty empty.  We decided to eat on the patio.  The server seated us. It took awhile for menus.  My husband was just about to get up to find menus when she brought them out after us sitting there almost 10 minutes.  We ordered coffee which she brought out fairly quickly.  Not only was mine cold, but it was weak and old tasting.   I couldn't/didn't even drink it.  My husband ordered the standard Eggs Benedict with extra hollandaise.  He asked to have the grits instead of potatoes.  I ordered the corned beef hash benedict with fruit instead of potatoes.  If another benedict comes with fruit, I find it ridiculous that I would have to pay extra to get the fruit instead of potatoes.  The food came out.  My husband's benedict had absolutely no hollandaise.  Didn't the cook see this before he sent it  out?  So now there is no hollandaise or extra.  The eggs on both benedicts were poached to the hard stage.  The grits were downright nasty.  We were paying extra for them since he didn't want potatoes.  We sent them back.  They were dry, lumpy, just nasty.  My husband is from the south. We eat grits a lot.   Needless to say, as long as we have been wanting to try this place, never, never again. The upside?  Our server was pleasant."}
{"text":"Small portions displayed on small plates to give the illusion of more food.   Not flattered."}
{"text":"I had no complaints about this place.  I thought the food was good and big selection.  Prices were average for this area.  Server was really friendly, which goes a long way with me.  I loved that it wasn't super crowded either.  Some might say that's a bad thing but I loved that about it.  I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I appreciate when a restauranter ventures to the restaurant waist land of ne mesa to give us a chance to enjoy a better selection of grub. I have been here 4 times now and have experienced a good breakfast with mediocre service to great service and medicore food yester day i had the  wolfpack hashbrowns with 2 eggs and bacon covered with more hashbrowns i requested eggs poached med. they came more to the hard side when one of the employs asked me how my eggs were i said there more to the hard side ,she said   O and walked away  I then asked for a side of holindaise my wait person brought it to me ......cold ....i said can you heat this she of course said no problem .....brought it back an over micro waved sauce that now looked like cottage cheese sent to my table by the (chef???) and delivered by the waitperson  didnt either one of them think lets redo this and not serve a coagulated mess to the customer. i must say the 4 times iv been here theres always been something not quite right from not having change for a $20 to waiting to long for my food  and yesterdays holindaise debacle."}
{"text":"Overall not a good experience on any front.    The food is overpriced.   $6 for a large orange juice is ridiculous and it didn't taste that great.   The quality of the food is not adequate.  The toast was over toasted and burnt.  The fruit looked over-ripe almost to the point of rotting.    When we pointed this out to the waitress, nothing happened.   Overall very disappointing.   There are much better choices in the area.   Stay Away"}
{"text":"I came in with my mother in law for a nice brunch on Sunday. This was my first time eating here. We both ordered the avocado eggs Benedict. While the presentation looked nice the food was not so great. The poached eggs were not even warm, the avocado too cold, and the hash browns were cold and stale.  I felt like they sat out all morning or were someone's leftovers. The hollandaise sauce was chunky like blue cheese. Every bite was nauseating. I just didn't enjoy it. Even the water was nasty. Don't think I'll be back. I could have made something better at home."}
{"text":"Came here because we had a local flavor deal.  It was not as good as the Indian School location we previously have frequented.  We ordered the same breakfast burrito as the other location, but this burrito lacked meat and also had way too many peppers and onions. The service was also lacking for a morning where it wasn't full in the restaurant."}
{"text":"I love this place for breakfast. Food is always great and service as well. Definitely a place i go to on a regular basis!"}
{"text":"Based on my wife's positive experiences at the other Over Easy locations, we decided to try the Mesa location.  The food is good, we both had omelettes that were prepared well.  The iced coffee is awesome, it's like dessert in a glass.  The reason for my lackluster rating is the state of the men's bathroom.  It was horrible.  The mirror has \"gang style\" writing scratched into it.  The paper towel dispenser was empty.  The tile floor doesn't look like it had been cleaned for several years.  Worst of all, it smelled terrible.  For a restaurant that has been open for several months, I would think that these issues would have been addressed,  I wish I hadn't used the restroom prior to eating breakfast, it really turned me off.  It makes me wonder how clean the kitchen is?"}
{"text":"Wretched. My best friend insisted this place was good for breakfast and so we went... how I regret that decision now. The inside was lovely but it was a deception. The service was bland and disorganized. I ordered chicken fried steak and my husband got the Loretta sandwhich.  The food was not nicely presented and took forever to get.  Then it was cold everywhere else besides but the middle- a sure sign that a microwave was involved.  The sandwhich had tiny peppers and barely any onions- the fries were not fries... I don't know what they were... The coffee and tea were watered down. Service continued to be detached and inattentive. The waiter was supposed to take the corned beef hash off my best friend's bill but didn't, put us all on one check, then divided it wrong! Three of four of us felt ill afterwards. And my friend confessed the more they have gone to this establishment it has gotten slightly worse each time.  My husband and I will not be returning here. Ever."}
{"text":"The food was good and I liked the place, but if you walk out from your meal feeling angry, it's hard to give any more than one star.   We had a Living Social deal. I guess they wish they hadn't sold them because when I got my check there was a \"$4.00 service charge\". When I asked about it, I was told that they impose what amounts to a 40% tax on the deal \"otherwise we don't make any money\"  That is not disclosed anywhere so I'm disclosing it here."}
{"text":"Went there today for Sunday brunch and I was excited due to all the good things I read about the place... It was disappointing. My brother got the chocolate chip pancakes which were ok and the sausage which was too hard to eat. My husband got the Wolfpack and for something that was advertised as \"layered\" you'd think it was layered evenly. The cheese was on on end an the rest on the other. It says that it's between two hash browns but they weren't cooked enough so they were falling apart. I ordered the 2 eggs, home fries and the Reece's pancake. The home fries were old and did not taste good at all. The eggs were at least cooked over easy unlike my husbands. The English muffin was cold and hard. I left the food and ate half my pancake. That was ok. I don't think I'll be going back. Sorry."}
{"text":"This place is right near my house so I finally got up early and tried it out before school today. It's a cute place, not too big. Only four tables (w/ 4 chairs each) and about 10 seats at the counter on the inside. Several tables outside. I grabbed a spot at the counter and just went simple and had the two eggs and bacon breakfast. The bacon was really good, but only got two pieces. The scrambled eggs weren't great. Just some cheap egg mix with little taste. Toast was a big serving, but lukewarm and they carry a generic and tasteless jelly brand to go with it. The big disappointment was the hash browns. They're thick (almost doughy) and very bland. And I'll be damned if I eat bland hash browns with my breakfast! That's a little dramatic, but I do love my morning hashbrowns. For $7, I don't really feel the meal was worth it. Looking at the other prices on the menu, it seems most items are about $2-$3 more than you'd see at other breakfast joints. And I had some ice tea, which is a green tea that they serve. It was standard issue stuff. It tasted just like the green iced tea Einstein's bagels serve. I'll probably go back and try a bacon and cheese omelette at some point since I can't get my perfectly-made omelettes at the old Eggery on 44th st anymore. But until I make it back to try an omelette, I'll stick with The Good Egg/Eggery locations when I want breakfast due to their portions, prices, and (from what I can compare of the two) superior food. But like I said it's a cute place, near my house, and the staff is friendly and awake without being freakishly perky that early. But don't get too wrapped up in the Yelp hype...this is a 3-star place at best."}
{"text":"So this place was ok. I had the waffle dogs and they were good, but something was missing in the batter, salt maybe? I also expected them to be crispier. My husband got the omelette and I'm glad I had an omelette at Ranch House the previous day. This one was too brown and didn't look as good. \"Home fries\" were not crispy at all. Not our favorite breakfast experience on our Phoenix trip."}
{"text":"Over Easy has become the Cheers of breakfast spots for me.  A friend and I have made it a point to eat here every Friday to have a local spot that we know and love.  In a city filled with chains, it is nice to find a cute local spot that makes you feel welcome.  I really appreciate that the building was a former Taco Bell.  Great revitalization project!!!!  We have had the same waitress every time and as soon as we walk in the door she has our drinks ready and on the table.  The one time that she was not there, the other waitress still had our drinks ready for us.   The blueberry pancakes are amazing!!!!!   No wait on Friday mornings."}
{"text":"Chef Aaron May is the force behind this restaurant, especially since it was featured on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives. There are several locations, and this particular morning, we went to the location at 47th Street & Indian School.  Weekend mornings will find patrons waiting in line for a table at this local favorite. Why? I really have no idea. I had high hopes for this place because it's had rave reviews from local food critics, fellow Yelpers, been written up in magazines and on Triple D. But I was not impressed.  The coffee was good, not outstanding. The atmosphere was, well...odd. Nice if you like upside-down children's umbrellas.   The Mediterranean omelet (w/ spinach, tomato,  garlic & Feta) sounded good this particular morning. Wow - garlic should have been listed as the 1st ingredient - I like garlic but this was way too overpowering. The omelet itself was overcooked at the edges and since my taste buds were overwhelmed by the garlic, I can't really tell you if the omelet itself was flavorful. Big disappointment.  Crying Pig omelet was selected by a meat lover in our group. He said it was flavorful and had a fair amount of bacon & sausage. He thought the omelet was a bit overcooked, especially around the edges, and was a bit dry, too.  Not too many places have corned beef hash on the menu, so our friend jumped at the chance. He ordered it w/eggs AND a side of gravy. He absolutely loved it. Now, take that with a grain of salt as he always loves everything - but he was sincere in saying it was delicious so I believe him.  For a restaurant that specializes in breakfast fare, I expected more. Would I go back? Potentially. However there are so many other choices in the Valley that it may be a long time before I circle back.The waiter was friendly and made sure our waters and coffees were filled."}
{"text":"Came here two years ago and it's the reason I now love eggs Benedict.  Glad I was able to find it again.  Don't let the location in a strip mall deter you.  It's very tasty."}
{"text":"I gotta say this location is worth driving by the one in Arcadia (which is down the street from my house) just due to the patio seating area. It's in the heart of the Biltmore in an office park but the patio is phenomenal with some nice mountain (more like hills but mountains for Arizona) views.   I hate eggs (as mentioned in a previous review for U.S. Egg) but keep finding myself at breakfast places with egg references in their names. Over easy makes a great corned beef hash though, which seriously is my go-to breakfast option. On this visit I had that with a side of home fries, bacon and a fruit bowl. My only complaint is the fruit bowl, it was like 80% pineapple.   If you're looking for a decent spot with a great patio, which is also dog friendly, and don't want to wait two hours to get into Snooze then I recommend this spot."}
{"text":"I love this place so much (: My boyfriend and I have made it our Sunday tradition to have breakfast together here! It's always packed but it's worth the wait. The staff is always cheery and accommodating, the food is consistent and fresh and the vintage retro diner feel is simply lovely! THEY ALWAYS PLAY GOOD MUSIC. GLORY HALLELUJAH AM I SICK OF HEARING TOP 40 AND OLDIES. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU OVER EASY! & I have to say the servers are my favorite- I am a picky eater and they ensure I get exactly what I want at a fair price. My boyfriend is a fan of the Crying Pig. Over Easy knocks my socks off!"}
{"text":"I liked it and I'll go again.  They provide typical breakfast foods but with several different dishes that I want to try the next time I go.   Today was my first visit and I had the Wolfpack and it was tasty and hearty. I also had a side of the corned beef hash. I liked it because it was the same way my Dad used to make it, simple and good.    The wait staff and bussers did a great job. As typical with a breakfast restaurant on 10:30am on a Sunday there was a wait. They said 15 to 20 minutes and I know we didn't wait any longer than 20 minutes.   The coffee was really good and hot. I like it when I'm nearing the bottom of my mug and the coffee is still nice and warm.   I had three issues: The eggs in my Wolfpack were supposed to be over easy but were over medium.   A manager came over to us while we were eating and asked how things were. In the process of the conversation he made it clear that they will do their best to adhere to requests such as switching out the bacon in the Wolfpack with sausage which I think would be better. The waitress didn't mention this but that is an indication of lack of training which is on the management, not the waitress.  A side of corned beef hash is $4.50. While I liked it, it was not worth $4.50.  The table next to us order some of the Benedict entree's and they looked really good. I'll order one of those next time I go."}
{"text":"We were over easy  bell rd virgins till today banana french toast was EXCELLENT wifes avacado benedict was also SUPERB will definetly be back staff super friendly very clean establishment cant wait to return could be a every week end breakfast"}
{"text":"This place COULD be really, really good... but it's basically just OK and not worth the money.  The place obviously uses high-quality ingredients and has some nice ideas on the menu, but the cooking is a bit sloppy, and the atmosphere wasn't for me.  I'll give it another try when I have a hangover - maybe that's the right fit.  Went here with the wife & toddler on a Saturday morning.    Food --------------------------- I had the Wolfpack - Eggs, Cheese, Bacon sandwiched between layers of hashbrowns - and a slice of french toast.  The wife had blueberry pancakes and bacon, and chocolate chip pancakes for the little one.  2 coffees, an OJ, and an apple juice ($35 before tax/tip - mildly high for breakfast).    My wolfpack was generally yummy, but the eggs were a total disappointment.  A place called Over Easy should be able to make eggs over easy, right?  Nope.  Fried egg (no sign of liquidity or even softness in the yolk).  The french toast was made of an obviously high-quality brioche, but hardly battered and neither soaked nor cooked through.  Bummer - woulda been really good :-(.  The blueberry pancakes were tasty, but one was uncooked - literally cut in and watch batter run out.  Bacon was thick, high-quality, cooked nicely, and generally good, but nothing special.  Service --------------------------- No real wait and seated fairly promptly, if clumsily.  Hostess was pleasant, but seemed a bit confused/frazzled.  Server was prompt.  We did not have any issues, but the staff seemed, frankly, a bit depressed.  Not a lot of smiles except from two guys apparently expediting (looked like brothers - maybe owners family?).  Atmosphere:   --------------------------- This is probably someone's lifestyle or keep-the-kids-busy business.  It's a relatively small dining room - not sure if they use the connected area (a sister place called 18 Degrees) for breakfast - with small octagonal white tile - Who uses white tile in a restaurant?  I'm sure they mop every night, but it was looking like a public restroom floor when we got there.  The decor is sort of retro/weathered, but just looked confused.  The staff was made up  of mostly young servers/bussers wearing simple company t-shirts and jeans (some of the ladies wore shorts).  The male staff was noticeably unkempt (maybe that's just fashionable these days) with long, uncombed haircuts that had you looking for hair in your plate.  Lots 3-day shadows with untucked shirts and ripped jeans - with the notable exception the aforementioned expediters - one of whom wore a red shirt (all other staff in black) and a hat.  Interesting.  Noticeably, most of the staff seemed a bit down (not bad, just low energy, not having fun) - with the exception of the two brothers who seemed to be having a good time - but not exactly working a lot.  It really doesn't seem like a for-profit business to be honest.  I suspect it's a great place to be when hungover."}
{"text":"So, waffle dog , waffle dog and waffle dogs. This place is cool as hell. The food was original and the staff was very friendly and fun. I have read reviews that says it's to busy , but in my opinion that is the place to go to, the chlaula and syrup was a genius move and taste. I'll be back soon, \" I'll be the one person wolf pack\""}
{"text":"The restaurant is cute and our service was really good.  My dad ordered the chicken fried steak and loved it.  I ordered the The Over Easy (toasted brioche with sautéed spinach, fried egg & natural jus with bacon & scallions) because it sounded different.  In reality, it was dry, relatively tasteless and boring.  However, the other items on the menu leave me with hope that I will like their other options and if given the opportunity, I would come back."}
{"text":"Fantastic breakfast place! Everything is so so delicious! If you are a coffee drinker - this is some of the best coffee! Staff are all friendly, warm, and helpful. The food arrives quickly with the best balance of seasonings."}
{"text":"Eggs Benedict and hash browns were perfect. Hubby had the mile high \"Denver\" omelet with home fries which he enjoyed. Coffee was strong for my tastes but it was good.  They offer alcoholic beverages for breakfast. They close at 1pm and only offer breakfast, but there were breakfast type sandwiches on the menu. Server was attentive. Nice place to meet with friends. Kid friendly too."}
{"text":"Ordered the chilaquiles. Had I read the meal description that said it had ranchero sauce (and not ancho chiles), I would have opted for something different. I love ranchero, but I like my chilaquiles a little more \"authentic\" and without processed yellow cheese on top (cotija would have been much better). I would have called the meal more like unflavorful migas rather than chilaquiles.   My partner in crime got the chicken and waffle. I was a bit jealous and think I would have liked that choice better. She is a regular here.    The staff was great and the facility was fairly clean, even though I was greeted by a long black hair on my menu prior to ordering.  I'll give it a second shot because it gets a lot of local hype and comes well recommended."}
{"text":"Omg. We went back last Saturday, for my birthday brunch, and had the worst service of my life. Server was SUPER grumpy, forgot spinach in an omelette, forgot silverware, forgot my side of turkey bacon, forgot someones toast, forgot syrup. Seriously? Coming from a server, find a new job!  Food was better this time..when we finally did get it."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and have always been satisfied, especially since I've discovered the eggs with wild mushrooms dish.  If you're a mushroom fan, it's definitely a must-try.  My mom came in town this weekend and I took her here Friday morning.  She had it, said it was the best breakfast she ever had, then asked if I wanted to go again Saturday morning, and she ordered the same exact thing. Also, their lemonades are really tasty mixed with iced tea.  They have mint in them.  It's yummy.  Their hash browns are good. You can also get tator tots, which taste like tator tots from anywhere else...but tator tots are always good.   It is small and does get crowded on weekends, but the wait is generally fast even if you have lots of parties in front of you, because they tend to turn over tables quickly.  There's actually a note at the bottom of their menu that essentially reads \"When you're done spending money, get the eff out.\"  Okay, it actually says something about being polite and cognizant of the people waiting for a table, but I don't think my interpretation was very far off. The meals are about $8-$10/each, which is a little pricey for breakfast, but the quality is good and the menu is more varied than you would find at a Denny's or IHOP, so I think it's worth it. Never had a problem with the service at all.  I'd definitely recommend giving it a try.  Especially the minty lemonade."}
{"text":"We've been 3 times now, wanting to love it so badly but just cant. Each of the times I have been, at least one thing has been overcooked. Today my brioche toast was burnt and my husbands omelet was brown on the bottom. Ironically my omelet was really good! Waited for a while for only one refill on the coffee which costs $2.25 a cup. Our server was pleasant, the best Ive had there. She was a petite older woman. Its okay to go in a pinch but not worth the wait if you get there during peak times. We went at 7:30 in the morning and there was hardly anyone there. Definitely liked the feel of the original location better."}
{"text":"To start off our Breakfast dining experience we were told that they ran out of coffee, so no coffee.  That should have been our first clue.  We had at least 3 servers, one took our drink order, one took our food order and another delivered our food.  It appeared that none of them were interested in being there.  I ordered the wild mushrooms, herbs with eggs.  The plate came with at least 8 oz of mushrooms spread all over my eggs.  No sign of any herbs.  It was not very appetizing to even look at it.  My husband had corn beef and eggs.  The corn beef was ok but the toast was barely toasted.  I have been to the Over Easy in Gilbert and it was good.  But we will never be back to the any of their locations.  Too bad, we are always looking for great Breakfast Places."}
{"text":"The food was good and priced fairly; a great bacon side, nice and crispy but still thick. I was very impressed with the super quick service."}
{"text":"Good little place to have breakfast, nothing fancy or spectacular. We came at 9:30 on a Wednesday and it was not crowded at all like some other reviewers had posted. We walked in and got a table right away.   I ordered the breakfast sandwich and husband got the chilaquiles. Both were good and simple."}
{"text":"This place was great for a coffee with a client. They have a nice size patio that is shaded and plenty of room indoors. The service was friendly and very prompt. It also looks like a nice place to have brunch as they do have a liquor license. There was plenty of parking. And it's easy to get to once you realize it's attached to the ice Den"}
{"text":"I stopped in for breakfast here after learning that it was on Diners, Drive-In's and Dives.  This place had great food.  I had an omelet but everything looked great.  The last time I had eggs so well flavored was when I was in Manhattan!"}
{"text":"I went twice and was twice disappointed. The food and service were at best mediocre, and on top of that it was expensive. I have no idea why this place is popular. The corned beef was gross. The breakfast burrito was small and over-priced. 2 is a generous rating."}
{"text":"Subpar overpriced breakfast place. Go here if you want minimal flavor and an overall below average breakfast."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast!! The building reminds me of a dinner setting, but the food is some of the best breakfast foods around!!  The only issue I have when I go there is that I want to order the majority of the menu! A great casual breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"One of the best spots for breakfast in Phoenix!! The only issue I have is figuring out what I want to order off their large delicious menu.  A casual breakfast spot reminiscent of a dinner, great place for groups, families, couples, or a solo meal."}
{"text":"Chicken and waffles were yummy. Jalapeno biscuits and gravy were right on as well. Came for early Sunday breakfast before the rush and was very happy. Iced Tea was good, the homemade jam was great, all around good grub!"}
{"text":"I make terrible pancakes and could have done a better job than this place. After reading about this place in Phoenix Magazine touting the Reece's pancakes, I was stoked to find another breakfast place in the Valley to try. Boy was I disappointed. The overpriced pancakes were the consistency and dryness of microwave pancakes and instead of having the candies mixed in, they were just on top of the dry mess. The tomatoes were not fresh (for my tomatoes and cottage cheese) and the rest of our guests had similar dry and uninspiring food. The service was great and the lack of wait was really nice on a Sunday. Parking is horrific since it's near the Ice Den."}
{"text":"We just left and are both still hungry. My husband and I both ordered a dish. He got corn beef hash (looked like they used a quarter of a potato)... I got the Waffle dogs and was expecting more on my plate... no sides. Just the cord dogs... We just got a lot more plate than we did food... food was ok? But I think there are more places with the same or even better quality food that give you more food.... Maybe try iHop or find a Black Bear Diner?"}
{"text":"Came back to our favorite breakfast eatery.  Boy did I miss this place!!  We shared the Mile High Omelette with scallions and the French Toast.  The omelet was cooked to perfection, the hash browns were perfect and the French Toast was spot on.  Very swift service and a must go to place if you are in the area.  We are going to try the sister restaurant next door, 18 degrees.  Hopefully they are just as good  :)"}
{"text":"Friends and I were looking for a local breakfast place late Saturday morning. I remembered seeing this place on Triple D and knew we needed to try it. I ordered the full order of Brioche French Toast with a side of bacon. Seriously thee best French toast I've ever had. Light, slightly sweet, cooked through, not soggy. I tried my friend's pumpkin bread French toast with caramel drizzle- delicious but a little heavy. I knocked down one star because we had to ask for syrup, ketchup, and my friends order was wrong. It is very inexpensive also. Great brunch place and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"After a two year break up with Over Easy we gave it a chance this Sunday morning...same tired routine!!! False holds to be seated...asked for patio where we saw an open table but was told we could not be seated there because it was a fire escape exit and we had one extra person. The patio wall is knee high!!! After waiting outside finally lead to the that tired old Back room where there was only one other table seated and lead to a long table that faces the wall when the entire room had empty tables facing windows!!! Ordered eggs Florentine  and asked for green substituted for potatoes...upcharge for that!! Dish arrived with nice hot eggs on a bed of cold soggy spinach (was that frozen spinach?) and muffin not even toasted or warm  Coffee lukewarm and for a table of 6 a 2oz creamer was served!!! Come on folks...your a neighborhood breakfast spot...at least act like you value your customers!!!"}
{"text":"So I tried Over Easy for a third and final time. It's been a few years..and it's a different location. Annnnd the fiancé wanted to try it because he had never been. We both ordered mimosas. I had a pomegranate flavored and he had a Bellini flavored. Both came in glasses filled with ice, which was strange.. and both were soooooo sweet and sugary. They weren't what we expected but they had alcohol in them.. So we drank em. He ordered chicken and waffles and I ordered the Benedict with biscuits and sausage instead of the traditional. His was OK.. The chicken was cooked well but very small portion. Not a lot to it. My dish was not good. The biscuits were stale and crumbly. The sausage was for sure a frozen sausage patty warmed up and the \"Hollandaise\" sauce had no flavor at all. Also, we were seated by one girl.. Another one took our drink and food order. She never came back to the table. Then, another waiter walked by and asked if we were good... We were but needed a check. So, he went and told our server who brought our check..and never came back. Luckily, we paid with cash and just left."}
{"text":"So, I went to Over Easy once before and it was \"ok\". Nothing great, they were super short handed, we got a free waffle because it took so long, the chicken fried steak and eggs were grissly but the gravy was good. But, I decided to give it another try. Huge mistake. We get there and the same staff problem..2 servers for the small, but very busy restaurant. My 2 friends each got the same thing, the Wolfpack. It was supposed to be eggs and chz layered between hashbrowns. I got the sirloin steak and eggs with carmalized onions. Their breakfast came out with sliced half cooked country potatoes-apparently they were out of hash browns?! How is that possible...they only serve breakfast and it was 10:30am. Mine came, it wasn't what I ordered. Fine, honest mistake, not a big deal...they went to remake it. Our server never once came over, not once, to apologize or to check to see if the food that did come was ok, which it wasn't. My breakfast came after my friends were done with what they could eat...This is the worst part. It was a plate of watery liuid gravy, grissly meat that looked like dog food, and the eggs were gooey. I took three bites of the eggs, I was starving, and couldnt eat anymore. Horrible. All three of us were still hungry when we left and frustrated as heck. They comped my breakfast... but not a chance Ill go back. I'd rather have Denny's or IHOP any day. I really think a lot of these crazy 4 and 5 star reviews are employees... no way this place was capable of 5 stars."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times since it's very close to my apartment and school. Decent breakfast place, my go to is their Wolf Pack."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I arrived on a Sunday morning, and not surprised that it was busy. Got two seats at the bar. Ordered a raspberry mimosa and a regular bloody mary. Both were very pleasant. John took our order and was very nice.  I asked for the florentine benedict and my friend ordered the corned beef hash.  When they arrived, my eggs were overcooked and had been sitting so the entire plate was lukewarm.  I stated my complaint to John, who immediately took care of the problem, however it took 10 minutes to replace the dish, leaving my friend to eat his alone. I had also ordered a spicy bloody mary, and had not been told that it was tomatillo based as compared to a typical red tomato based drink.  I did not see anything on the menu stating the difference, and found it unpleasant to drink, as it seemed thick, and the whole thing tasted more like drinking salsa instead of a bloody mary. I did not get through half of it. Overall: it was ok. If I had a choice of going back there, as compared to some of the other places I have eaten, I would go to the others. Customer service was excellent and saved what was not really a good experience into a decent but not anything special one."}
{"text":"We went to Over Easy on Indian School for this first time on a Sunday morning. We were crammed into a tiny table with tables on both sides about a foot away. We could barely get into the table. I made the mistake of ordering chilaquiles. If you have experienced good chilaquiles--crisp tortillas with ranchera sauce and a sprinkling of farmer cheese, don't bother ordering these. I received a plate of limp, fat-soaked tortillas smothered in cheddar--a gloppy mess. The sauce was there, but so mixed in that it was unrecognizable. I didn't eat it. My partner fared better. He ordered the two egg breakfast which was basic and fine. I have no idea why this place was recommended to me by a friend. Maybe we just hit a bad day."}
{"text":"My beau loves Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives, so while visiting my sister in Phoenix, we had to stop at Over Easy to check it out!    Understandably so, it was very busy around 10 am on a Sunday, but our wait was only about 20 minutes.  In Arizona in March, we had no problem waiting outside in the sun :)  We got a round of Over Easy Iced Coffees to start, which are delicious!  Cinnamon, cardamom, sweetened condensed milk and mint - unique and tasty!  I'll have to figure out how to make these myself.  The Wolfpack (great name, by the way) is really the way to go.  Simple ingredients - hashbrowns \"stuffed\" with eggs any style, your cheese of choice and bacon... but simple does the trick for this savory breakfast lover!    There are lots of great brunch/breakfast options in the area so I'll probably explore some new spots during my next visit, but this is a great standby."}
{"text":"This place is an awesome breakfast spot the Wolfpack is great for hangover and the servers are very friendly and willing to put up with you when hungover also the bloody Mary's are good."}
{"text":"Horribly bland food. No flavor what so ever. My wife ordered an omelet with home fries. I ordered the steak with eggs. Neither of our dishes tasted like they had any seasoning what so ever. The pancakes were OK at best. And the best part was the way overpriced bill for crap food.  Won't be visiting this place again."}
{"text":"So I finally tried over easy. No wait for seating at 1 pm on a Saturday which was nice. We tried a few things: Ice coffee- not as awesome as I hoped it would be Sausage - greasy but yummy Waffle - a little burned. Just ok. Tater tots - fabulous Dolly sandwich - basic but good  We were not impressed with the decor and the prices seemed a tad bit high. However, we may come back to try the waffle dogs and the wolf pack, both of which we saw while eating and looked amazing."}
{"text":"I like Over Easy. The former location had more charm but this one is bigger and you don't have to wait as much :) The food is great and the owners are wonderful and friendly.  We just ate breakfast there. I got the 3 eggs over easy with mushrooms. The eggs were way too raw. I told the server about it and I asked to just get 2 eggs over easy instead of remaking the dish as the kid in the table was getting grumpy. That's what I ate for breakfast. The server didn't take it off the bill. I wouldn't say anything about it but I didn't get to eat the dish I wanted but still got to pay for it. Not cool. The Ppllo Loco is great !  Hopefully this is a one time issue and the owners are still on top of everything like they used to be."}
{"text":"I went to this place this morning (Saturday) around 9:30am w/ a few of my friends. This place was really busy, people waiting outside (10+ people) consistently. (Always a good sign to a great food joint). So I put my name in at the door and we waited 25 or so to be seated. No problem. The people were all in good moods and atmosphere outside was really nice. (They had a few cement benches outside for those who wanted to sit--only wish they had misters!) So when they called your name, they wouldn't just say \"party of 3\" or something they would say \"Sarah...are you ready to eat!?!\" It was kind of funny. We entered this small restaurant and the tables had a nice retro feel to them and it was really bright and sunny. On the walls were decorated w/ Disney art (Snow White being my favorite), the Simpson's and other fun characters. We sat down and were greated rather quickly, but within 2 mins they came back and asked if we were ready...we were like 'whoa!' we haven't even had a chance to review all the options (omlettes, egg sandwiches, french toast, chicken fried steak ,eggs of course, granola/yogurt..the list goes on...). So we made our decisions, and I ended up getting the \"The Mile High - Ham & Bell pepper with diced onions and cheddar cheese\" (subsititute - just egg whites) with wheat toast. My friend I believe got the Wolf Pack (eggs, hashbrowns, toast etc) and then my other friend got the Chilaquiles - a mixture of tortillas, ranchero sauce, chicken, sour cream  & cheddar cheese topped with one egg. All looked mighty delish.   My omelette was so butter-delish and had all the right textures, and flavors you could want. The peppers added bold flavor without adding too many calories, the ham and cheese added just enough salt it make perfect. The toast was normal wheat toast, so not much 'wow' there. But complemented the omelette very nicely.   I would highly recommend this place, I am definitely going back. Just leave plenty of time to wait. (As stated--this happens at any good breakfast spots on a Sat./Sun morning). But they seem to move people in and out rather quickly. Speaking of which....it appears my group of friends over stayed our welcome. After about an hour of us chatting girls, the waiter got a bit upset I think because he couldn't turn the table. I guess we should of been more courteous to the others outside waiting in the heat...but we just liked the atmosphere and company so much...we faltered. Please forgive us 'Over Easy' and when we come back...we'll try to not talk to much. :o)"}
{"text":"Have no idea why this place is less than five stars!  Food is always consistent, great service and entertaining!  You have to try this place, once you do, you're addicted.  The coffee is delicious and you'll find yourself taking it home as well!  Chicken fried steak best in town; bacon is delish, chicken and waffles puts lo los to shame!  Get here and EAT!  Triple D wasn't kidding this place is the bomb for breakfast!  Tell them Dee sent you!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stumbled upon Over Easy while our in laws were in tow a few months ago. It has now become our regular Saturday/Sunday morning breakfast spot. All of the staff provides fast and friendly service. A few of them even remember our orders! I would highly recommend Over Easy! The Wolf Pack and Cherry Mimosa are my favorites. Eggs Benedict is delicious  too. :) My husband always gets the chicken fried steak.. the sweet potato tots are to die for!!!"}
{"text":"I've been living in the area for years and have never had a bite here until recently. I was jonesing for a Denver Omelet and this place delivered. They don't call it a Denver Omelet but call it a Mile High Omelet; Eggs, cheddar cheese, green peppers, onions and ham. Anyways, the Omelet was large along with a very healthy serving of hash browns. This plate of food was delicious and filled me up for $10.  This is a nice cozy Diner atmosphere next to the Ice Den. Parking can be a pain if there's hockey practice or some kind of event. Just deal with it."}
{"text":"Imagine if a traditional diner used excellent ingredients and displayed cooking chops and attention to detail."}
{"text":"4/12/18 Bacon 4 stars  Breakfast Burrito 4 stars  French Toast 4 stars  Mimosa 4 stars  One of my coworkers put me into this spot on 24th and Camelback where I've had the breakfast burrito like 4 times and each time was delicious. Today I had a side of bacon right the French toast with. Mimosa and everything was delicious. Sometimes I'm hesitant to order French toast fearing it's going to be too eggy or to \"wet\" this French toast was delicious!  Amy was our server and she was friendly and sweet!"}
{"text":"Terrible service, terrible food and if you want to pay for over priced items, so be it. I ordered food, the server never came back to check on anything, the food was terrible. You are not going to tell us that the bisucits have jalapeños in them, and the chicken and waffles were cold! The other entre had barely any meat, and the hashbrowns were cold! So, I paid, got up and left....didn't even eat the food. The server had the audacity to open the door and say \"thanks!\" Are you kidding me. So my mother-in-law went back in to complain...the owner had NOTHING to say. The server ACTUALLY had the nerve to complain that we did not leave a tip. We didn't even eat our food!! They are lucky we paid for that. The entire place is a joke. I do not even know if they really made it on TV...how could they? Coporate will definately be hearing from us. Absolutely ridiculous! Do not go here!!"}
{"text":"No wait on Tuesday at noon but you'd think the waitress was slammed judging by her bad attitude from the moment we sat down.  She rushed us and was wrong about how my food was prepared (which was really annoying since i had to remove the toppings from my sandwich), and seemed annoyed that I was even asking her a question.  She was so off-putting that we weren't even comfortable asking her for refills on our drinks (not that she ever came by to ask how we were doing). The other servers were nice and the manager (owner?) came to ask how we were, fortunately.  The food was OK.  I got a Loretta sandwich (had to remove the peppers since I don't like them raw, which is what I asked the waitress about). Tried the brioche french toast and that was good.  My fiancee wasn't too excited about the corned beef hash, which is sad because he loves it.  He said it tasted canned with some added onion.  Overall, I'd never go back.  Much better options in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"The place is pretty small! I've eaten here twice now. Good food, good service. The portions aren't huge, but they are fresh and tasty! We had a party of seven (three kids) and everyone found something they enjoyed!"}
{"text":"They don't have soymilk. Or any non-dairy options for coffee. But...isn't this a breakfast/MORNING ONLY restaurant? And aren't we in North Scottsdale? Just checking.   They do have a coffee on the menu that sounds delicious, but is of course \"already made\" and they can't serve it without the condensed milk. I would have totally ordered it and went without milk if it meant I could partake in the yummy-sounding cardamom and cinnamon infusion, but alas, they said it was already all pre-made.   Anyway, we had to wait about 15 minutes for a table in a space that seems like it could easily fit ten more tables in there (I only walked in the first room, not the second one), so it just felt oddly empty. Service was nice, everyone was friendly, food didn't take too long, and the food was pretty good.  I ordered an egg white omelet with spinach, asparagus, and mushrooms, with a side of sweet potato tots. The tots were alright, but not nearly as delicious as I'd hoped. Something about them was off. Omelet was fresh and tasty, but swimming in butter/oil (order it dry if you're watching your calories!).  My friend and I split a 1/2 order of the caramelized banana and pecan french toast. I have to give the restaurant credit for offering half orders of ANYTHING, but especially for something so heavy and delicious sounding. Don't you hate going to brunch and having to decide between being healthy or a total glutton? I only ended up eating a few bits of the cloyingly sweet french toast, which wasn't the worst I've had but I certainly wouldn't order it again (and I LOVE sweets).   Also, *they close at 1pm*, and we were still eating at 1:10 and were probably the last people in there-they clear it out by closing time! This is NOT the place for a lazy Sunday morning brunch, unless of course you are a very early riser.  I would only go back to try out their infamous waffle dog, but I need to be up super early and bring my own coffee if I plan to go for brunch one weekend!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Loretto egg sandwich and editing over easy egg The only problem is the bread is much larger than the sandwich and I would just call it a roll not a French roll is nothing French about that role"}
{"text":"This new location is just opened and working out the kinks.  I know they will get it right because their other location does it right.  My pancakes were undercooked and mushy and my husband had eggshells in his egg dish.  Lovely location!  Coffee refills were non existent. Great recipes! The lemon ricotta cakes are super lemony and delicious despite being undercooked."}
{"text":"Probably the worst breakfast place I have ever been to. Sat down, no one came for a while. Waitress came over rudely and took our orders, no friendly conversation just a blunt \"what do you want today\". When the food came out, the food runner asked who in my party got the waffle. Apparently we were too slow to respond, so about 5 seconds later she screamed, \"WAFFLE?\". Absolutely unacceptable. I also got something to go, and when a different food runner came to give it to me, he asked who's they were. I said they were mine, and he looked me in the eyes and set them next to my friend. I started to say something, and he just said \"I'm just gonna put them here\". And walked away. Just plain awful service. The food wasn't anything special either. I got the Chicken and Waffles, my friends got a waffle, bacon, hash browns and eggs. I also got chocolate chip pancakes to go, there were maybe 4 chocolate chips in the entire thing. Safe to say I will never ever be back!"}
{"text":"Had to try Over Easy out this weekend after reading about it this week on Chow Bella. I wanted to love this place but walked away with only a like. I will give it one more try as my table mates were happy with their selections, me not so much.     Mediterranean omelet-great Brioche French toast - so good Eggs with sautéed wild mushrooms and herbs-fail. Someone in the kitchen needs to learn how to sauté mushrooms.  Mine were steamed,not sautéed....ruined the taste of the mushrooms. Such a disappointment.  One last thing......yes the OJ was very good, but at $6.00 a glass,ummm maybe not that good"}
{"text":"This is a good little breakfast spot. I had the migas, which were not like any other migas I've ever had; the best way to describe them is breakfast chicken nachos. I also had a side of corned beef hash; it was exactly what I expected and very tasty. The service was fantastic."}
{"text":"First off I am not a breakfast person, I prefer to sleep in vs getting up earlier to eat and I've never been a big fan of the typical breakfast foods. But I will say after making a stop to visit some friends in Arizona I was pleasantly surprised by this place.   My friend had heard about this place so we decided to give it a try. Like others have said expect a wait, there were only two of us and we got there around 9ish and had to wait maybe 15-20min. Not too bad but it was already quite warm outside and they don't have much of a waiting area inside, especially to accommodate all of us waiting to be seated. Once seated though we glanced over the menu trying to decide what to get. At a place called over easy you'd think we would've gotten some sort of egg dish, but we didn't. I got the reese's pancakes and my friend got one of their breakfast sandwiches the Loretta I believe.   We both agreed that our food was good but nothing notable or spectacular, we like the feel even though the decor seemed a bit random and we couldn't figure out what they were trying to go with. I wouldn't mind going back to try something else but again I don't necessarily need a return visit. I think if you went here you wouldn't be completely disappointed as long as you didn't go in expecting the best breakfast you can find. The service was ok but they definitely could've done better, we were at least asked multiple times by various staff members if our meal was ok etc. but no one cleared our table, we had three people ask if we were ok before someone thought to take our finished plates or even ask if we were finished. Again overall not a horrible experience or anything but not the best either"}
{"text":"I couldn't believe I had to wait for breakfast at 10 am on a Wednesday. I decided to stay and tough it out. I'm glad I did! I ended up ordering the wolfpack and I am embarrassed to say I ate the whole thing. It was huge and I was full the whole day. I couldn't even eat dinner! They put lots of yummy cheese on my eggs and the hash browns were crispy just the way I like them. My sister ordered the OE omelet and she said it was really good too. I was a fan of the food but I wasn't a fan of the wait. Also the seating arrangement here is too close for comfort they put a whole bunch of couples tables together and seat you next to strangers. Not my cup of tea."}
{"text":"This was a little hard to find in the back of the strip mall, but it was worth looking for.   My wife and I shared the chicken and waffles and the jalapeño biscuits and gravy.  Both were fantastic.  The menu suggests putting hot sauce and maple syrup on the chicken and waffles....YOU MUST TRY THIS!   The kids enjoyed the M&M pancakes and the chocolate waffle.    We got there early on a Saturday morning. It was lucky that we did because they got busy in a hurry.    The service was fantastic and the whole experience was great.  I thought the prices were very reasonable too.  It's too bad that I'm rarely down in that area. :-("}
{"text":"It's been about a year since we have been here, boy has it and it's going to change! Service was much better, a lot more customers, and they are going to move at a new location. No more outside in the patio. Everything is going to be inside now! Hopefully this move is going to make this place even better?"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! This is my breakfast spot. I drive all the way from Tempe to eat here. The owner and the management are down to earth and hard working. This is truly a genuine family owned restaurant that pours love in to every dish. The service is great and the staff is friendly. The food is fresh, delicious and made with quality ingredients. The location is cozy and homely and located in a busy Safeway plaza. I couldn't recommend this place any higher, as I will keep coming back to my \"breakfast joint\". Give it a try."}
{"text":"The food used to be great but it's fallen off considerably. What's most aggravating is the owners honestly believe that people go there to see them rather than just have breakfast. Whatever you do, don't make eye contact with either Brad, his Wife or their daughter ( the owners) they'll dominate your entire meal with their favorite subject - themselves!"}
{"text":"Sunday breakfast at the Overeasy. They have a new decor, which looks clean & uncluttered. Much better than before. However, the food is a little downhill. I ordered the eggs with sirloin steak. Perhaps I did not read the menu in details; I thought I was getting a piece of sirloin steak with 3 eggs. In reality, it's diced sirloin steak. It's over cooked, chewy & tasteless. It's not good value for your money ($11). Won't go back there anytime soon !!"}
{"text":"Great food. And great service. Zachary always takes good care of us.  My favs are the eggs Benedict, tator tots extra crispy.  Watch for coupons, makes it an incredible value."}
{"text":"The food was good at best and nothing to write home about but it may have been an off day...I'll go back and do an update"}
{"text":"I was late to try Over Easy, but clearly there was no harm in waiting.  The service is slow and the food mediocre.  Notwithstanding the hype, nothing special going on here.  I don't plan on returning."}
{"text":"Me and my girl friend love this place. The food is always good and I love the fresh orange juice and My girl friend loves their Bloody Mary. The theme is yellow which is like eggs yolk and in my opinion yellow is a great color and makes you feel good. The staff are friendly and helpful. And the prices are pretty good for their portion. It's one out top choices every weekend for breakfast."}
{"text":"It's Sunday morning in America. No kneeling on mats giving praise. No long lines waiting for communion. None of that nonsense. Not today.  The things that count today aren't happening on a floor or shrine or temple.  Not on your life. What matters today is rehab, food, sex and a couple of train-wreck, mud-butt shits from all of last night's drinking experiments.   Well, forget the sex. Christ's sakes, I can't even bend over to tie my shoes without risking an aneurism. And rehab? That's inevitable, but I need to feed The Duke of Hangover first. Because somewhere in my primal brain there's a little voice shouting; \"All will be right again, but not until you've eaten enough to self-detonate, go home, and pass out on the floor\".  And that's exactly what I do. I visit Over Easy. Point at the menu item ('cause it hurts to speak). Devour it like the Fantastic Mr. Fox, then hustle out the door without anyone seeing me.  As I leave, I think about the twelve step program for a fleeting moment - counting the excruciatingly painful, head-throbbing steps to my parking space - twelve to be exact. Weird. Probably an omen.  I love Over Easy. Their servers are quick to recognize temporarily disabled folks and don't make chit-chat.  They serve delicious, large meals that I can simply point at. (sometimes from other tables) The female servers don't touch me or call me sweetie or hon. (Thanks) And, they have a Franke espresso machine. Which in the world of digestive rehab, the coffee this machine produces will make you poo like a sick Wooly Mammoth.  If you find yourself a passenger on the Nope train to what-the-fuckville from your Babylonianesque, Saturday night lifestyle, you WILL appreciate Over Easy."}
{"text":"Everything looks great.  I had the corned beef hash with fried eggs toast and coffee.  Coffee tended to be bitter.  The corned beef was somewhat tasteless.  The potion was filling.  The wait staff was pleasant."}
{"text":"Heard good things about it.  Food is above average.  Wait staff is not very good, but extremely polite. Bottom line; entire dining experience took 2 hours and the end result.... its ok."}
{"text":"Caramelized banana french toast gets a 10/10. The fresh OJ was over priced and not as good as the cheap stuff from the store unfortunately. We enjoyed this place, and didn't even have to wait for a seat."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot! Awesome food, drinks, fresh OJ and coffee. They even have boozy breakfast drinks."}
{"text":"Very good. Tried this for the first time today and really liked it. Like the atmosphere. The servings were big. The pumpkin bread was awesome. It was a little pricey. For three of us the bill was $50.00 but two people added bread and one bacon. For the quality it's worth it."}
{"text":"This place is right across the street from my house, so no surprise my boyfriend and I visit many weekend mornings for brunch. The staff is always friendly, and the food is delicious. My one complaint is the noise level can be super loud as the place is rather small but other than that, it's a great Saturday morning brunch spot!"}
{"text":"Had to update my review. This place went from great to average in a short amount of  time. I have been going here almost every weekend for months.   My last two experiences have not been good. On one, they were out of bacon, and instead of hash browns, they served potatoes sliced that were undercooked and tasteless. On the other, I recognized that the hash browns were not cooked properly, and the bacon (which was amazing in the past) had changed. There is also a significant drop off in the service. My pancake arrived when I was almost finished with my meal, and not once did they offer to refill my coffee.   You can watch, what appears to be the manager, working away at the counter on a laptop, and never lift one hand to help when it's busy. I feel they are understaffed, have resorted to inferior ingredients, and basically will not survive if they continue with average food and service, when there are so many options.   My weekend breakfast spot is going back  to NCounter, even though it's a bit farther walk, have never been disappointed there.   Wanted Over Easy to kill it since it's so convenient to where I live, but instead, I think it's already dead."}
{"text":"I have been to this location twice now (plan to go back this Sunday :) and they have always impressed me.  The staff is friendly and helpful, food is always delicious!  It's such an inviting atmosphere inside or outside. They have excellent cold brew.  Look forward to seeing you for my Sunday feast.  :)"}
{"text":"I love the new location!  This breakfast beaut really shows up it's saucier competition (LGO) in the price category.  The menu isn't as fancy, leaning towards hearty takes on French toast and other classics like pancakes. The prices are better, almost reasonable...but slightly high keeping it from getting MY fifth star."}
{"text":"A perfectly good neighborhood breakfast spot that deserves local support.  There is nothing exotic or truly unique to the menu- standard breakfast fare- but everything is fresh, tasty,  well presented and of high quality.  Almost as good as Matt's and its insane small size and lengthy wait."}
{"text":"Tried to order take out on a Sunday, no one answered the phone. Went in during the week. Dining was on the dirty side, steak had a sour taste, when I asked to get something else the waitress asked if it was chewy and said they get that a lot and offered to remake it.... my second choice was fine. Omlette was good but fruit wasn't as fresh as we expected. Not a fan:-/"}
{"text":"First off, we had wonderful service! It was our first time there and Ariana was our server. She was attentive and knowledgeable of the menu. I ordered the veggie omelette w/ house potatoes, a classic Bloody Mary and a peach mimosa (unsure of the name). The food and drinks came out just as quickly as we ordered it and everything was delicious! Bonus points for the patio. It's always nice being able to enjoy your meal and the beautiful fall weather. Only complaint I have is that the tables outside were a little sticky so we were sharing our meal with some pesky little gnats but other than that, we're looking forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Bad service there is clearly a table for two gray haired older laddy won't let me sit until my friend comes. Very interesting if it were just me wouldn't I just sit by myself in the table!!!!!"}
{"text":"The food and service is always a 5! If something isn't right, they take it back and make it right! Everyone is always friendly! There's a reason this place is always packed. It is definitely one of our go-to's every weekend!"}
{"text":"Today, the hubby, 2 of our friends, & I tried this location of Over Easy for the very first time and we all had a great time. We started off with an order of Waffle Dogs, which are cooked sausage links of pork, dipped in waffle batter and deep-fried to a crisp golden brown. They look like your typical corn dog, as to their appearance, but they're covered with a little bit of powdered sugar and comes with a small side serving of syrup to dip the waffle dogs in or to pour on the waffle dogs...whatever your preference is. The drawback I found with this waffle dogs was the price. 3 of them for $8.50 seems a bit steep to me. Now had there been more, I could justify it.  Our waiter was Ryan and he was great. He had our food out to us in a matter of minutes after ordering and was on the ball with refilling drinks and getting anything else we needed (ketchup, for example for the hash browns).   I had the Wolfpack and had my eggs done the way I like them best: sunny side up...and this meal was SO GOOD! I would definitely order it again! The portion size was just right for me, as I am really trying to make a more conscientious effort on controlling my portions. I topped it off with a refreshing glass of iced tea and really enjoyed my meal!   Everyone in our party enjoyed the ambience of this place. It was nice and quiet and not that full when we got there at 8:00. When we left an hour later, it had filled up, so we chose a very good time to get there.   Next time, I will have to thy the Eggs Benedict or one of their varieties of French Toast. With so many choices on the menu, it's hard to decide on which one to try, but that's what is fun about going to a new place, plus there's always opportunity for return visits and I will DEFINITELY return!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying almost didn't come here. 3 stars and some bad reviews. On the bright side they do have a full bar, what could go wrong. Ordered the something pig omelet and it was very good. My faithfull side kick and bed partner Tiff, Orderd the eggs benedict and she loved them. Ordered the berry mimosa (dont drink whiskey till after noon. Doctors orders) that was 90% Champagne and was refreshing. Don't believe some of the reviews. Service was great and wasn't rushed out of here. Will be back here again."}
{"text":"I've been there a few times now and love the food. Their menu has some interesting items on it rather than just regular breakfast items. The service is good but there can be a 20min wait to get a table. It's worth it to me."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend on a Sunday morning, thinking that it would be packed and there wouldn't be a chance of getting in. We were wrong! My friend was late and I had to sit for a while, but the gentleman taking names brought me a glass of water while I waited. So nice!  Food was decent and quick. I had the egg white omelet with asparagus, tater tots, and a side of bacon. All were delish, though the omelet's asparagus was too greasy, probably cooked on the griddle. My friend had the French toast, which wasn't anything to write home about but fine.   My coffee was way too strong (and I typically love strong coffee) but I was happy they had milk to put in it instead of cream. I had to ask for refills, though. But water glasses were filled promptly.   We sat outside and were pretty cool under the misters but eventually got uncomfortable. Overall, Over Easy is a nice place to go if you don't feel like going to a Denny's-ish kind of place. The tater tots are awesome and the prices are good. It's not the best brunch EVAR but it's certainly one I'd have again."}
{"text":"Not impressed with Over Easy and I'll tell you why:  We stopped in to try it out on Saturday morning for breakfast with our 3 and 1 yr old daughters. First there was a 20 minute wait and there were at least 6 empty tables inside and out, so maybe they were understaffed. Then, when they called us up they said they didn't have any high chairs and it would be another 10-15 min wait for one. I was annoyed, to say the least and if we hadn't been hungry after waiting, I would have left right then. Instead, I said okay, we'll take a table and wait for the high chair. First impression of the restaurant was that it was clean and well laid out. It was warm and kind of stuffy inside but it was lovely on the patio where we sat.   Having never been there, I asked for some descriptions on the size of the pancakes, which were described in hand gestures as roughly 6\" around, so we went for a stack of 3 instead of 1. When they came, they were as big as the plates - huge! Sadly, while they were pretty to look at, they were tasteless. My husband ordered 3 eggs over easy (okay but oily) with sauteed \"wild\" mushrooms (looked like they came out of a tub, not freshly prepared but they probably were and were either button or crimini, NOT wild) and a side of bacon. I had the Croatian spinach egg loaf, which the waitress said was her favorite thing on the menu and that it was big enough for two to share - meaning me and my 3 yr old - but was probably 4x4\" - definitely not as she described. It was also greasy, laden with oil and incredibly salty. I was frankly a little repulsed.  To her credit, the waitress realized how off her description was and she brought out a second slice, explaining that it was much larger at the other locations. My home fries were thin slices of greasy potatoes, some were fried crisp like chips and others were limp with grease and reminiscent of a dirty grill.  My coffee was gross - both bitter and metallic tasting, definitely brewed with unfiltered tap water they don't bother with fresh half&half but use the little packs instead.  The best things we ordered were the fresh squeezed OJ and grapefruit juices.   Overall, this place was over priced - for $10 egg dishes, I expect much better preparation and attention to detail.  For my money, I'll stick with either Liberty, Joe's, or the Farmhouse which are similar price points but much better food. Or, if I'm really in the mood for delicious diner food, then I'll head to US Egg in Tempe, which is actually worth the wait and the drive. I will never go back there and will warn my friends to stay away unless they like overpriced greasy-dive/diner type food."}
{"text":"This was my second visit. 1st was good, this time it was great. Although in a strip mall, I really liked the new location. I had the lox scramble with sweet potato tots-just great. Our table also enjoyed chicken fried steak and bacon omelette.  Now my fav choice for breakfast."}
{"text":"Good, quality food.  Love the fact that I used to eat at that Taco Bell when I was little."}
{"text":"4 Stars for this location!   I was reading the 1-2 Star reviews for this place and I am glad we did not have the same chef or waiters that day!  We sat out on the patio and all four of us had a great meal and service.   Service was prompt and the food was really good!  We'll be going back!"}
{"text":"My mother and I often go here on Sunday mornings.  I am a big fan of their Eggs Country Benedict and she says that their Huevos Rancheros are the best she has ever had."}
{"text":"Overall the food, service, and \"diner\" atmosphere was good, friendly, and clean.  We went here for the first time and enjoyed our breakfast.  Our waiter was friendly, refilled our drinks often, and was personable.  The food was quick to be delivered to our table - we had blueberry pancakes and an omlet -   We will go back!"}
{"text":"Chicken and waffles were very good. Indoor / outdoor seating with full bar and cornhole court in the back. Waffle dog sounds cooler than it was, basically just a corn dog."}
{"text":"One of the top breakfast spots in Phoenix.  Not as good as Matt's, but not as crowded either."}
{"text":"I make it a point to get corned beef hash anytime it's house made and let me say it was pretty good!!! I also got a half order of the brioche French toast which was yummy. I only give this place 4 stars because it was some of the worst service I've received. It was on a Sunday morning so it was busy, but you'd think they'd also make it a point to be properly staffed. It took our server 15 minutes to make initial contact with us. And another 15 before asking what we'd like to eat. When asked about certain things on the menu, she either hadn't tried it or had no real feedback from other customers. I would've thought she was brand new, except for the fact that she could rattle off all of the types of bread available for toast. Weird. I'll probably go to the other location on Southern because I enjoyed the food but could definitely do without the terrible service."}
{"text":"Just finished breakfast here. There are 4 customers here and our food took over 30 minutes to arrive. My order was wrong, they put the wrong veggies in my omelette. Hash browns are dry, generally uninspired breakfast. Save your money and eat at home."}
{"text":"Over Easy has gotten too big for its britches... They've jumped the shark!  Just visited the new location and came to the conclusion that this place thinks its too good for their own customers.  The food is slightly above average, don't get me wrong, but it's nothing to rave about all things considered...  The wait was over 30 minutes, which isn't a problem when you at least get a decent greeting from the restaurant owner.  Instead, he seemed more focused on churning cows in and out of the restaurant.  This theme continued,...   Our server was sweating profusely -- sweat literally dropping off his chin as he took our order. After taking our order, he never checked on us again.    I then watched the old woman at the door absolutely bitch out a customer.  Now I have no idea what was said from the customer and maybe they deserved a good yelling at, but the customer was with her 6 year old daughter when the older woman who worked the front door demonstratively punched open the front glass door, screamed at the customer, got 2 inches from her face and pointed angrily at her until she and yer young daughter scurried off.    Then we overheard the older woman telling the owner what happened and the owner basically said \"good for you\" for screaming at the customer.  Just one of many examples of why this place isn't good enough to take your money, they think they are above the customer and we are just a number.    My farmer's omelet was just OK at best, slightly above room temperature but badly burnt on the edges.  My wife's chicken and waffles were average at best and she wished they chicken was crunchier and more flavorful.  They removed their cappuccino and espressos from the menu, though the coffee was excellent.  Over Easy has gotten too damn big for their britches. This joint needs to go back to trying to offer decent customer service."}
{"text":"I want to give a 2 stars because the service staff was friendly and good as well as ambience was decent.  But we came here for food not to meet the staff.  Food was just really mediocre, not even hot.  The hashbrowns taste pre-cut and frozen.  The \"real maple syrup\" is just a maple syrup blend.  I could make a lot better food myself.  We had pancakes, bacon, and the wolf pack.  All the prices were way too high with food that's more on par with denny's.  Would rather IHOP across the street.   Unfortunately it looks like another lackluster joint resides here (before nypd pizza)."}
{"text":"Darn Good!  Fresh OJ, Chicken-fried-Chicken, Omelets and more!  Cold Brew Coffee is their specialty also, although i have not tried it yet.    The waitresses are very polite and hustle.   (-) I am not in love with the pancakes here.  Portions are nice SIZED.  Oh and the Coffee is = GOOD.   Definitely a solid Breakfast spot in Arcadia."}
{"text":"3 Stars due to lack of customer service/experience. My gf and I arrived this morning and her mother was meeting us and about 5-10 min away.  Because there was only 2 of 3 there the hostess refused to seat us. I said I get it but there are plenty of open tables, not to mention I see at least 2 people seating at 4 tops. She she they were \"about\" to get busy. We went to the bar and had a cup of coffee and few minutes later her mom arrived. I went back expecting to be seated at an open 4 top and she said no it was being held for a party of 8 outside. I got a little frustrated and said, so you wouldn't seat us, we were here, you had tables, now the third person is here and you still won't seat us? Anyways went to the bar, had breakfast. Bar staff and most staff was nice, food was good. Had chicken and waffles. Now, the reason why Sam Fox has sooo many successful restaurants, customer service. Houstons, Banderas great customer service. Mom and pops placed fail because they refuse to embrace and train their staff properly. It would have been appropriate for a manager (she was there and aware of us) to come, apologize for any inconvenience or mis communication but she didn't. She ignored us all together."}
{"text":"Price was good but food was just okay. They were featured on the food network but not sure how. They're food was the equivalent of IHOP or Denny's . Decorum was very standard. Overall lower your expectation and you'll be good."}
{"text":"I have been meaning to try Over Easy for almost a year (the one in Indian School) and I just found out there are more than one : ) We were heading to Globe and thought about stopping here for breakfast. I did not know what to expect, so when we got there I was not so sure I wanted to stay... It seemed small and kind of plain... well it is very colorful, kind of retro... but the menu seemed kind of simple, few choices and a little overpriced (menu said omelette came with potatoes or bread) I had coffee and hubby had a diet coke.  Well, upon further review I liked that the omelette ingredients included asparagus. That was a nice surprise. So I went ahead and ordered an omelette with mushroom, asparagus.. and something else that I don't remember : ( I also chose sweet potato taters, and turns out it is potato AND bread. So over all it was a good meal, the only thing I don't like is that they are none of them close to home.  Hubby had omelette with sausage and jalapenos and he liked it a lot too. Service was friendly, I think our server's name was Lauren."}
{"text":"They know what they are doing with this breakfast thing. I typically get sweet stuff, but on both trips to Over Easy I ended up ordering the Chilaquiles... I cannot resist them. Handfuls of tortilla, tons of cheddar cheese, mixed with red chile sauce and succulent chicken, topped with eggs your way.  The only thing I find odd about this place's menu is that they have no avocado... Not on the chilaquiles, not in the omelet ingredients list, nowhere. Oh well, I digress... There is a counter with seating, so you might get lucky and have the option of sitting there, otherwise be prepared to wait 20-40 minutes on a weekend. It's a fairly small joint, but they get the food out fast and keep the customers moving at a comfy pace. The service has always been good as well.  I've promised myself I will get something sweet next time I go... We'll see!  ;)"}
{"text":"Ah-mazing!  We went with one of our couple friends, which is great because it allows you to sample things off of everyone's plates!  So I had the french toast, which was delicious, pretty much standard homemade yummy french toast.  The star of the table though was the pecan banana caramel french toast that one of our friends had.  Holy SWEET Jesus.  It was amazing.  Now granted, both my friend and I love sweet sweet sweet things, the men thought that it was too sweet, but not us!  The caramel sauce is homemade and the perfect consistency and flavor.  My best suggestion would be to order the banana french toast and then order something not sweet, like an omelet, and split both dishes with another person.  My fiance had a veggie omelet which was great!  Nice amount of veggies and generous portion!  We always recommend this place!  Downside is that the wait is usually a long for a breakfast joint, and parking can be a nightmare.  Service was good, nothing to rave about, they seem to run on a small waitstaff which means that occasionally you go without, like a refill or the bill for a couple extra minutes.  But other than that GREAT!"}
{"text":"If you want to find me on any given morning, look here.  I could eat breakfast for breakfast, lunch and dinner, and THIS is the breakfast place I've been waiting for.  No, it's not artsy like my beloved Pallette, but you can't beat it for a quick, delicious and inexpensive start to your day.  Over Easy is absolutely adorable inside, and the enclosed patio with misters is nice too.  More than anything, though, I love bellying up to the counter and sitting on the bouncy stools.  While I'll be dragging poor Dave B here every weekend from now on, I also would have no problem popping in by myself on the way to work with a book.    The food was yum, just your typical breakfast cafe fare, but somehow a notch above.  The price are beyond reasonable (you can grab some eggs and bacon for less than your Egg McMuffin meal deal, seriously), and it's simple to put together exactly what you want, a la carte.   (EDITED NOTE:  after I posted this, I read other reviews, many complaining about price.  I guess I didn't really pay attention to the bigger items on the menu... I just know that I typically want some combination of pancake, toast, eggs, bacon, and potatoes, and I am able to get all that VERY cheaply a la carte)  Now that Over Easy exists, I can't imagine a good reason to ever set foot into anything generic like The Good Egg or First Watch again.  My one and only disappointment in Over Easy is that they are only open in the mornings.  Hopefully plans for some extended hours (maybe even just through lunch) are in the works.  If so, you can also look for me there every day at lunch too!"}
{"text":"The Food Network nailed this place.  Great food, cute decor, amazing service, and very clean.  Our waitress, Deet, was adorable and attentive.  Her recommendations were spot on.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This is a cool location as it is situated at the base of an office building near 24th Street and Camelback. That was my first draw as it is different. You would not know it but I like different. Shhhhhhh (that is a secret).  My second draw was the patio. It sits right on the Main Drag of 24th Street and is a great place to watch the goobers drive their cars to work. Some doing their hair and others brushing their teeth. Of course, there is Mr. Serious with his high end Mercedes that can't crack a smile until they remove the stick from his (edited for young readers). It is only a car. You drive it to make up for your personality... (your boring)  The menu offers all of your favorites prepared just the way you would like them. Inside is like a store and they crank out a ton of To-Go Business. Christian, who has been my server here twice, lays down a great vibe and the my old punk rock server, kicks butt and we swap stories of our youth and the days of the Violent Femms, JFA, the Ramones and many more. Blond with a short Bob-Cut and funny as heck.  Everything that I have tried here has been great (You have to try hard to screw up breakfast!) Also, they have one cent Mimosas after you buy the first one; as many as you want! So, come check this joint out! It is located across from the Biltmore Shopping Plaza, so there is a ton to do right here after breakfast. Kick start your day with a hike up Squaw Peak and then grab some chow here. Perfect way to start the day!  #Vino2 #Vinosquared #vino2ultimate #irishcatv2"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been fans of following Guy's recommendations on Diners Drive ins and Dives.  So of course Over Easy was on our list when we went to Phoneix.  The food was decent, but nothing special to me.  Not at all what I was expecting.  However, the servers were friendly and quick to get us in.  So all in all, it wasn't a bad experience."}
{"text":"Menu alert: when it says eggs and sirloin, don't serve me a bunch of cut up beef, about a third of which is sirloin. The rest being flank and skirt that's really not done very well. Rest of the food was great. Really. Just don't piss on my shoes and tell me it's raining. I'd give you four stars but you tried to smoke me."}
{"text":"Wow! Even the waiter was a blast! Funny as hell. Food was excellent and service was same. I would recommend this place to anyone. Prices are good."}
{"text":"OMG, I am still craving the absolutely amazing veggie benedict I got from Over Easy yesterday. This was a build-your-own benedict done right (something that hasn't quite been achieved at places such as The Breakfast Club.) I ordered a Country benedict ($9), sans eggs and sausage (I know, weird), with avocado, tomato slices and goat cheese instead. The whole thing was smothered in Hollandaise sauce and came with a massive side of hashbrowns, and it was truly one of the best breakfasts I've ever had. Thank you, Chef Aaron May, thank you. The fact you can add goat cheese to breakfast items delights me.  This was my first time at Over Easy, which has several locations throughout Arizona, and I was impressed with the friendly service and casual style coupled with the mouthwatering menu items, including a variety of pancakes and French toasts. Also, be sure to order a delicious Over Easy Ice coffee drink, made with cinnamon and mint ($3.25)."}
{"text":"I love to check out new breakfast places, I actually went there for lunch (but ate breakfast ;) The service was extremely fast and courteous. I ordered the \"wolfpack\"because I saw other reviews about it and it was FANTASTIC! The music was a  bit loud and hipster-ish but I didn't mind it. I went with my toddler and they had a children's menu and crayons. Highly reccomend!  Con: I am a HUGE tabasco fan and they only had the green tabasco. HOWEVER, the waitress offered Sriracha sauce and I loved it!"}
{"text":"Heard about this place and decided to give it a try.  It is located in a nice area albeit seemingly out of the way.  (I am new to Scottsdale and may be incorrect as I continue to learn the area.)    The service staff were all friendly and attentive to drink refills and to any needs that I may of had.  They were nice and helpful.    The food unfortunately was not all that great hence the three stars.  I ordered the banana pecan French toast.  It wasn't terrible but it wasn't memorable either.  It was actually rather bland which is quite a disappointment as I love breakfast and was hoping I found a great little place.  As always, I am willing to go  back just in case it was an off day in the kitchen.  But it probably won't be for awhile as I continue to scout and learn about this new city."}
{"text":"Let me list the things I've tried at this place: Waffle dogs, the regular AND pecan caramel french toast, the salmon omelet with cream cheese, the Selena omlet wrap, bacon and sausage sides. The Wolf Pack is one of its staples, with layered eggs, bacon cheese AND hasbrowns...so good!! Everything is amazing and you woud never guess it because of its location in its tiny nook. The service is friendly and attentive and I didn't wait long for any of the food. Great breakfast choice but get there early! They're always packed."}
{"text":"Normally I am easy to please however this was the worst meal I have had out since I can remember.  The coffee tasted strange to both me and my husband. They told us, \"It must be you,\" which seemed odd. My son's, \"Wolf Pack,\" meal was all hash browns. My husband's blueberry pancakes had no blueberries in them just some on top. His steak and eggs was not good either. There were about 6 tiny pieces of steak next to eggs that the waitress didn't ask how he wanted them cooked. His English muffin wasn't toasted, it was fried on the grill and the bottom was soggy from too much butter.  The strawberry lemonade was infused with rosemary which the eight year old wouldn't drink.  I know we won't be back and guess this place won't last a year. Breakfast was $72.00 and I would say money better spent other places."}
{"text":"loved the food! The service was excellent as well! We walked in 30 minutes to close and were treated like we were the first table of the day for the entire meal. Waffle dog was yummy! Breakfast burrito was huge and delish! We will def be back!"}
{"text":"I came here for one reason and one reason only.....for the waffle dogs.   I saw them featured on TV's,  \"the best thing I ever ate\".  The line was literally wrapped around the block and were told it was a 70 minute wait for a table. despite this the service was wonderful!  i was served three breakfast sausage corn dogs with their special sauce (syrup and hot sauce). It was delicious.   I came, I saw, I ate, I was satisfied :)"}
{"text":"They won me over. I may be the only person on planet Earth that does not like the Chilaquiles. But I ordered them, and didn't like them. The owner, Brad, came to the table, simply said, \"Different strokes for different folks. What else can I get you?\" And the new order was promptly served.   AWESOME, people!  My 1st visit, when it was at the old location, was uninspiring. I was just not all that impressed. After giving it a 2nd try, I'm glad that I did. And since then, I've made a 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th subsequent visit. All of them equally pleasant and enjoyable.  I do need to say that there is a hostess who is unable to modulate her voice, and when she calls people to their tables, renders all people within 10 feet deaf. And... When she called my name, she called the wrong name because she wasn't paying attention. After being yelled at 3 times asking me \"Are you Joe? Are you Joe?\" I waded my way through the noise, looked at the list, and politely informed her, \"That doesn't say Joe.\" and smiled. What's the deal with that, you may be asking? The 45 minute wait would have been longer had I not been paying attention.  That said, a must go. I'm a fan of Brad's and his staff, and service first, and the food second."}
{"text":"If you ever watch Foodnetwork's Diner's Drive In's and Dive's, you'll know that host Guy Fieri has been in the valley a few times showcasing local restaurants. His appearances and shows have taken successful eateries from popular to super stardom in one simple episode.  Go to Over Easy anytime during peak weekend breakfast rush hours, and you'll more than likely have a hard time finding parking as well as a table. Early bird does get the worm, I had front row parking and sat immediately around 8am though on the way out there were probably about 10 people milling around waiting for a table.  Chef owner Aaron May has built a reputation on well executed high quality eats and continues to do so, including a new second Over Easy location in the west valley. Aside from the free publicity on the triple D, Over Easy is legit with many delicious, comforting and sometimes outrageous breakfast plates.  Housed in what used to be a Taco Bell, the place has been spruced up with bright yellow paint, an open kitchen and a spacious patio. Service is good and if you happen to sit on the inside, its kind of funny listening to one of the surly chefs smart off to the line cooks, not being a much of a morning person, I welcomed this.  The morning beverage line-up is what you'd expect, though it's whats unexpected which draws my excitement. The deliciously tart Strawberry Lemonade with rosemary ($3) was a welcome surprise. If anything is going to wake you up, its going to be the drinks bright flavors with a wonderful rosemary finish. The Coffee ($2.25) for me was on the weak side, perhaps that's in part to my 2 shot a day espresso habit?  Being dinner centric I decided to make one of the \"griddles\" a breakfast appetizer. Each tender syrupy fork full of the Caramelized Banana and Pecan Brioche French Toast ($7) was like biting into sweetened maple flavored clouds. The perfectly toasted crunchy pecans were a nice counterpoint to the warm chewy bananas.  Over Easy isn't all great, the breakfast sammie, Loretta ($7) came out room temperature both times I had ordered it with the Swiss cheese being barely melted. Making up for this short coming, The Wolfpack ($8) is quite the breakfast love mound. 2 eggs anyway you like them, bacon and cheese all sandwiched between layers of crisp buttery hashbrowns. The eggs were ordered over easy as to enjoy the hot gooey yolks amongst the smokey bacon, deliciously filling.  For those of you who like a contest, try ordering Big E's Pile-up ($30). Ready for this? A dozen eggs, 12 slices of cheese, 3/4 of a pound of bacon, and hashbrowns all covered in country gravy. Sound like a challenge? If you can finish it in 30 minutes or less, it's on the house! This seems like a challenge waiting for a true professional. Who knows, maybe they are priming the way for another television appearance, Man vs. Food anybody?"}
{"text":"Fun place for breakfast.  Prices were reasonable and food was good."}
{"text":"I was incredibly satisfied. I felt like a Las Vegas mob boss, smoking a cigar and getting head from a showgirl when I was done with my breakfast. Like a fucking champion!  The night before had been Stevey's b-day dinner and since I didn't have to work Saturday morning I got to indulge in brunch (well really breakfast since O.E. closes at 11:30) with some quality PHX peeps! Kristin and her partner in bad parking crime big J had a bad time with the parking (maybe the huge truck backing out of a space smaller than my vagina had something to do with it?) and right next to the Vig shone Over Easy. There were cute benches set up outside and the wooden cosy eating venue outside was super classy. It felt very west coast-and I agree it was nice not to see parking lots or highways while eating-all patios in the SW should seriously consider building more outdoor friendly structures like O.E. The wait for our group of 5 would be about a half hour-totally reasonable. I asked if we could have mugs of coffee while we waited and our server was totally sweet and brought it out for us and we hung out outside, enjoying the sunny day that was chilly enough for all of us to wear light jackets, sweatjackets, thermals and cable-knit sweaters but not have crippled cold hands for eating.   Our server ended up sitting us down early, warning us the kitchen was backed up-the food looked huge all around me so I figured it was worth the wait. The menu was a picky eater heaven. Most meals come with meat, and there is never a substitute for non-meat eaters like a fruit cup or scone, something of an upgrade from meat except more toast or potatoes. But I digress. It took me forever to figure out what I wanted, but I made my own meal from the sides menu with the country potatoes that Stevey seriously would NOT stop staring at. Now I know how chicks with big boobs feel. Stevey, look at ME, not my country potatoes you piggy!  I also got one egg over easy, no bread, and a chocolate syrup belgian waffle from the kids menu-with the short glass of OJ and coffee, my bill came out to under ten bucks! And I got a LOT of food that was cooked just perfect with really good hot sauce on the table and extremely helpful wait staff.  Kristin was right in taking note of the slats-when waiting, take note of where you will want to NOT sit-trying to eat while the bright arizona sun is burning your retina, causing you to flinch and tear up,  is not the most desirable  morning after look, you know?  The fact they let us linger and drink more coffee was def. a huge plus-I love the time a good weekend brunch takes with friends, its a great way to catch up what happened the night before or plan outings for the future or just shoot the shit, making each other laugh while having a good simple meal.  I peeked inside and noticed how bright and cheery the counter space was-I would totally come here early on a weekday just to read the paper at the bright happy and hip counter. The tables inside were small, but very cute diner-esque.  I just hope they plan on having misters come summertime so people don't melt like butter on waffles!"}
{"text":"First time in for brunch. This place like many other breakfast spots in Phoenix is BUSY!! If it's a day off or a holiday expect to be on a waiting list for a table. We waited about 25min. I imagine that it's always a tad hectic in there, but today they were really getting their butts handed to them. They were slightly understaffed due to someone not being there so it seemed like the staff were a bit stressed out trying to keep up. Lucky for them the owner showed up and jumped into the fray to help get things back on track. Other than the food taking a bit longer than I would have liked, it wasn't that bad. I didn't get hangry or anything.  My wife had the avocado Benny which was nicely presented and she said was really good. I had originally gone in there to have their chicken and waffles but I got sidetracked by the chicken fried steak. It was a chop steak breaded and Fried smothered in white country sausage gravy and I got sunny side up eggs on top tater tots on the side. I love chicken fried steak and this was a good one however I have never really liked white country gravy. It's not that it was bad it's just that every time I've had country gravy it's always just bland paste I always have to add salt to it, and I rarely salt my food. I also added a little hot sauce to give it some help. Like I said it's not the gravy wasn't good it's just that I don't like that kind of gravy and I keep forgetting that. Otherwise it was a great meal I'm definitely gonna go back as there are about 10 things on the menu that sound amazing! They even have something called a Thanksgiving waffle which is stuffing cooked in a waffle iron and covered and turkey and gravy! Totally original! Definite food porn!  Our server was friendly and efficient despite being stressed out. It should be noted that the girl who Who brought our meals asked if there was anything else we needed I said ketchup. She nodded and was never seen again. I got the busboy's attention and asked him for ketchup. He mumbled something to the affirmative and also disappeared into the abyss never to be seen again. When our server came to do a food check on us I asked him for ketchup and he made it back from the black hole that the other two got sucked into and delivered my condiment. Like I said the place was a little bit overrun and the staff was flailing. However if breakfast food is your thing then you must try Over Easy!"}
{"text":"Over easy is great concept that is not managed well, The restaurant is cozy (small) with good ambience. Our wait for the two time we have gone has been 30-45 minutes after being told 20 minutes. The food is good and the service is fair.   Our last experience: waited one hour for a table after our initial 20 minute wait time, ordered a special not on the menu and it was given to the table next to us (literally an elbow away), they took a bite before the waitress came over and said, oh you have the wrong dish and tried to hand it over to us. Obviously, i asked for  redo since someone else had allready taken a bite of it. 20 minutes later as i hungrily watched my boyfriend eat his meal mine arrived, it was excellent. when the bill arrived we asked for a compensation since it was their error and our waitress says \"but you ate it'. seriously??? on the redeeming side: the manager took it off, no questions asked.   I will not be returning to overeasy unless i have 3 hours to spend on a sunday afternoon waiting for breakfast."}
{"text":"Food = 3 stars Service & Atmo = 5 stars  We came here because of my DD&D's app, which maps out all the places Guy Fieri has visited.  Yes, there's a wait, but not so bad.  They quoted us 25 minutes and we got in in something like 8 minutes.  The tables & chairs are 50's style retro.  Very clean with a fun look.  The place is a little crowded and you'll be sitting almost elbow to elbow with your neighbor, but it's friendly and kind of fun.  Gotta say I was pretty disappointed in the French toast with \"caramelized\" bananas.  I'm not a big French toast fan but our server encouraged me to order it saying that it was the dish that made them a star on television.  The menu says \"caramelized bananas\" but really they aren't.  They are fresh bananas with some very bland homemade caramel sauce on top.  When I mentioned to the waiter that I thought the bananas were supposed to be caramelized, he said, \"yeah, they're bananas in caramel sauce\".   Sorry, but that doesn't qualify as caramelized.... when I told him the \"caramel\" sauce wasn't really sweet and was more like a neutral gravy, he again countered the comment and said that customers had complained that they caramel was too sweet so they changed the recipe.... ok, fine, but it doesn't really qualify as \"caramel\" when it's almost neutral tasting, barely sweet.  Just figured first timers should know this about their signature dish.  The bread was so-so, the caramel sauce isn't sweet like you'd expect and the bananas are fresh sliced.  The dish in my book was pretty bland and not worth spending the calories on.  To make it up a very boisterous friendly man, probably the owner, brought me something else and really made it up with his attitude.  Another plus is real maple syrup on the table in a squeeze bottle.  Would I come here again?  For the freshly made pancakes which were awesome, yes, but I'm a little skeptical now when eyeing other things on the menu since they are a little loosey goosey with the descriptions... \"caramelized\" may not mean caramelized and caramel might mean \"non buttery gravy.\""}
{"text":"Food was excellent.  Traditional Benedict was cooked perfectly. Two egg special was also very good.  Servers very friendly and attentive.  Definitely a stop in the future."}
{"text":"Didn't think this place was quite worthy of a spot on Diner's, Drive-Ins, and Dives, but it was okay.  They did have the best hashbrowns I've ever had.  But, my cappuccino was cold and overpriced.  We all had egg dishes, and we split an order of french toast at the table.  The french toast was done really well.  But, upon leaving, I thought to myself - 'they must have an awesome kitchen back there, and they do have a skilled chef, but this really wasn't worthy of a Triple D shot.'  Guess my expectations were too high.  We didn't make it around to Matt's Big Breakfast for comparison, since we ran out of vacation before we got to all the spots."}
{"text":"Nice view of the desert, friendly staff...great egg white and aspargus omelette, good orange juice also"}
{"text":"Was just ok honestly.  They didn't have almond milk or stevia for my coffee which I have at most places.  To feed a family quickly this isn't the spot.  Service is a little slow on busy days.  Plan on the service taking a little bit of time."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp for breakfast. We pulled into the parking lot and noticed the cool modern signage and covered patio. It looked like a trendy spot. That was immediately dashed when we walked inside. The build-out of this place felt really cheap, which is a turnoff for me, personally.The decor was really poorly executed and again felt cheap..like it was trying to be a 50's dinner with a modern twist, which would be fine, if it was done well. It was clean though.  Enough about the decor, I was there to eat, right?  I ordered the Mile High omlette with homefries. It came out about 3-4 minutes after I ordered it, which was an immediate indicator that the quality might not be there. The server placed my plate before me. My omelette was slathered in what seemed like an entire stick of butter. It was shiny. It tasted okay, but it just made my skin feel greasy. Not cool. The homefries were soggy.. like they were frozen and microwaved or maybe were prepared hours ago and just sitting in a bowl waiting to be served.  Our server was really nice though.  I wanted Over Easy to be good, but it's really just a greasy spoon."}
{"text":"I really do enjoy this place. There are locations through out the valley and I have had really good experiences at all of them, but I tend to go the Indian School location and the Tatum location the most frequent. Some of their best dishes that I enjoy are the Reese's Pieces Pancakes , the Protein Pancakes, and the Wolfpack. They have many other delicious dishes but these would rank among my favorites. Their pancakes are some of the most fluffy and flavorful pancakes you will ever have. I love Snooze and their cornucopia of pancakes, but when it comes to quality of the cake, I have to rate this place ahead of them."}
{"text":"Ok.   Food was acceptably decent.   Service was painful.   Easy to blame the staff,  but this type of service issue is a management problem/lack of training,  lack of mission and busy enough to not give a sheet...."}
{"text":"I venture here often when I need a break from the office. I prefer the California omelet, which is surprisingly very tasty.  Staff is always friendly and responsive. They also have a full bar, which is dangerous during the work week."}
{"text":"My wife and I had high hopes for this restaurant. We sat down and ordered cocktails. I ordered the bacon Bloody Mary and the wife ordered a mimosa. The drinks were fantastic, fresh OJ for the mimosa and crispy bacon in the Bloody Mary. Our server seemed a little overwhelmed but she was attentive. The menu had a great variety of classic dishes as well as signature dishes for the restaurant. My wife ordered Classic eggs Benedict and I ordered steak and eggs. The wait for the food was roughly 20 minutes which seemed pretty average for a moderately busy breakfast restaurant. Pretty much at this point we had a very good 4 star experience so far. The food is where they lost it for us. First my steak and eggs was described as 3 eggs any style with chucks of sirloin, caramelized onions, jalapeño and choice of potatoes. This is not what I got. I got steak strips so over cooked and tough floating in a liquid mixture of chopped jalapeño and soggy caramelized onion and topped with eggs. I was baffled at what it was.  I asked the server and she said it was a pan jus which is added. I tried the eggs and a couple pieces of the flavorless steak and soggy onions but I just couldn't. My wife's Benedict was cold when she told the server, the sever explained the hollandaise Is room temp so it may seem cold but she would throw it in the microwave to heat it up. The microwave?!?! Really? My wife could not cut through the English muffin it was so stale and the ham was a salt lick. Overall not good. The only thing both my wife and I agreed on was the home fries were very good. The manager came over and explained the pan jus and that it's the recipe. I told him it's not on the menu and I would have asked or ordered something else. He agreed and removed it from the bill. He was very professional and apologetic. I wish I could give more than 2 stars but the one thing you go to a restaurant for is the food and it was no more than a 2."}
{"text":"Best eggs Benedict I have ever had. The service was outstanding!! Very friendly atmosphere, kid friendly all around great place to eat!!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here with a big group of riders for a breakfast before our ride. We had said 12 but ended up with 13 and the hostess acted like it was the end of the world that we had one extra. I got a basic breakfast of eggs bacon hash browns and toast. The egg (suppose to be over hard) was undercooked,  and still had some runny to it. The rest of the meal was decent nothing special. Then when we all got our checks we realized that they added $2.00 per check, with out any sort of notice. I have no problem with paying a gratuity, as long as I am informed before. I ALWAYS tip very well, so they lost out on this one. When we were leaving the ever so greatful hostess was on her phone and said a half hearted \"have a good day\" with out looking up. So all in all I would avoid this place. The only reason why I gave it 2 stars were cause the hash browns were pretty damn amazing!"}
{"text":"Delicious and great service  Came here because I saw them in DDD.  Food Eggs and wild mushrooms-if you like mushrooms this dish is for you! Its a beautiful forge of mushrooms of many kinds on top of spinach and eggs I added garlic to my dish. Would definitely get again.  Daughter-pancake breakfast she ate it all up and I had a bite it was great.  Great coffee, good juice, and awesome menu."}
{"text":"Had the biscuits and gravy...they were OK. (Bland, not as warm as they could have been).  Also couldn't help but notice the couple sitting next to us, sending both of their meals back for being cold.   I realize this location has just opened - so I may wait a while before giving Over Easy another go. 3 stars are for our friendly waitress and the yummy Bloody Mary mix."}
{"text":"Our server was great but, the chef should be fired! Coffee was bitter, chicken fried chicken was salty and the EGGS...ordered scrambled with onions andcheese, served ONIONS with scrambled with eggs and cheese! Totally REDICULOUS!!! We will not be back."}
{"text":"I would actually give this place 3.5 stars for the pure and simple reason that it is a great place to take your hung-over ass to on the morning after as long as you wear your super big bug-like dark glasses for deflecting the Arizona sun.  *The malted waffle soaks up any residuals that might still be floating around in your system. But I agree that the syrup isn't the best I've ever had. *The Wolf Pack (eggs, bacon, and cheese served between two layers of hashbrowns) is the perfect greasy solution for coating that uneasy tummy. But be forewarned this one is served on a lake of melted butter, so it might actually be a better pre-drink meal. *The omelette's are a little on the bland side, but if that's what the Dr. ordered, then it's nice to have that option. *The coffee is actually above Par as compared to most restaurants. It's strong and smooth, with absolutely no hint of bitterness or that oily film that you find in some cups. And they serve actual cream, which rounds out the flavor and doesn't require you to use an entire container to mellow things out. *And what place doesn't deserve a second or third visit that offers 'tater-tots' as one of the potato selections?!!  I've never had to wait very long, even when there is a line to get in. Service is always friendly, but not always consistent, so you may need to take a dose of patients.  All in all this is a pretty decent place to have breakfast and doubly so when the weather is nice!"}
{"text":"Well,  I just have to say that they never disappoint. I haven't been here in a while and today the homemade strawberry preserves and homemade English muffin was a total party in my mouth! Absolutely delicious!  The service is always great and the menu has been totally revamped with mouth-watering descriptions if you've never been here you have to come try this place it's outstanding!"}
{"text":"Still coming here for over 3 years! It's our favorite breakfast place. Yummy food, great service, and relaxing ambiance! Highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Awful Diner food, Quality and service at outrages gourmet prices!!!  First time here and our server did not care.  The restaurant was pretty much empty and she acted like we were bothering her with our questions.  Her fellow male server paid more attention to us and answered our questions then she did and we weren't even in his serving section.  We order the chicken and waffle, jalapeño cheddar biscuit with gravy and corn beef hash with.  The waffle is like cardboard, they were very stingy on the gravy, The biscuits were hard as rocks, the hash looks like it came out they can rather than being made from scratch, The toast was burnt and broken and smelled horrible, today supposed be over medium and we're pretty much over cooked!!!  We were so upset with the food, the presentation and service we just got up and left because they honestly did not care!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast spot! We had the Wolf Pack and Over Easy breakfast. The portions are significantly big. The bloody Mary's and mimosas' were an epicurean delight."}
{"text":"I don't like to leave negative reviews, but I'd like to be warned. So I was caught in a pinch and need some food. Carry out- 3 eggs, bacon, frozen hash browns and a juice almost $17.00!!!!!!!!!!!! Anyone who knows what a Coney Island is knows it's a 5 or 6 dollar meal. You'll go broke eating here"}
{"text":"Had been here once a few years ago and remembered liking their tots, so when I was planning a breakfast date I thought it would be good to give this place a second try. Was not my favorite breakfast ever, but it satisfied the omelette cravings. When we first got there, it was pretty empty, only a few people there, but we went on a week day. We sat ourselves and were quickly greeted by a server. We quickly decided what we wanted and ordered. I got an omelette with spinach, tomato, and mushrooms. Thought it was kind of weird that you either get a potato side or a toast side. Most places you get both, and for like the same price! However, I do like the wide selection of potato options. I went for the sweet potato tots.  Our food came out super fast. Like kinda too fast. I was surprised how quickly our food came out. At first everything looked good. When I cut the omelette open I was disappointed to see that it was a little runny. Still was pretty good, but would have preferred my eggs to be completely cooked through. The sweet potato tots were very tasty and I enjoyed them! My date enjoyed his food as well, but agreed that it wasn't really worth the price.  One thing that annoyed me a bit was that our server gave us our check like right after we started eating. Like she was nice and did a good job, but I always find it irritating when servers do that, makes me feel rushed! But other than that, no problems with the service. Over easy is alright, not the best breakfast joint in the area, but nor the worst either. I'm in no rush to get back there, but wouldn't be totally opposed to coming back."}
{"text":"It's a cute little environment to eat at. Came in at around 10:30 and had a 5 minute wait. While waiting, 8 out of 12 tables still weren't cleared off. Waiter had to clear off a table just to seat us. Waited 20 minutes for food, so not bad. Ordered the traditional egg Benedict and my eggs were overcooked. Waitress didn't ask how I wanted my eggs. Hash browns were okay. My husband ordered the steak and eggs, and his dish came in so soupy. His dish was also okay. I mean, it's not a horrible place to eat at, its just not the service we expected when we ate at the Over Easy in east Mesa."}
{"text":"This is our first time here and we will be rolling ourselves out to the car! We may have over indulged a little on brioche french toast and pancakes. Also the traditional eggs benedict was awesome! We will definitely be returning for round 2! The omelets look amazing and I can hear them calling my name already! Normally, my bf gets biscuits and gravy when we go out but they don't have plain biscuits, theirs are cheddar jalapeno. They sound good but we are hesitant. ;) I'm confident you will enjoy this place! Service is good and the art is pretty cool too!"}
{"text":"We went on a hangover Sunday and when we walked in the place was packed and super loud so we decide to eat on the patio- if that option wasn't avail we would have left it was that loud. I ordered the egg sandwich with tots and a side of the Brioche French toast both were amazing. My husband ordered the pollo loco omelette and that was also very good. Our waitress was super nice and even though the place was slammed we felt well taken care of. The menu has tons of choices and the price was right.  There was a woman eating alone crying so we decided to pick up her meal and the manager came over and gave us a 20% off coupon which I thought was super nice!  We will for sure return"}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot with delightful options for both savory and sweet breakfast lovers. We ordered the traditional brioche French toast and it was served with four generous slices of toast. It was delicious! We also ordered the green chili pork and grits, which was amazing as well. We were happily surprised to learn they serve Press coffee and we ordered a cold brew and a nitro cold brew. Both were great! I'm withholding one star from the review because it is a little overpriced for the amount of food we received. But overall a great spot, we will be back!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite breakfast places in Phoenix! Creative menu great service and ambience.  Hey 1 or 2 waffle dogs as an appetizer! Can't go wrong with anything on the menu!"}
{"text":"My fiance and I were visiting from out of town and decided to try this gem on our way out of Phoenix. Let me just say, hands down, one of the best breakfast places I have ever been to. We were seated within minutes of arriving, even though it was busy. The hostess was pleasant and courteous about providing enough space to fit out 9 month old at the table comfortably. Our server, Jenna, was absolutely fantastic. Recommended some incredible meal choices. My fiance was consider both the chicken fried steak and the lemon ricotta pancakes, but decided on just the CFS and I got the breakfast nachos plate( I don't remember how to spell the actual name of the dish... started with a C). Once we ordered our food, we waited for 15 or 20 minutes, at the most. The server interacted with us, making us laugh and smile  (a huge plus). When she brought out the food, she surprised us with a free lemon ricotta pancake, insisting that she couldnt let us leave without trying it, of course she paid for it. Hands dpwn, the best we have ever had, Jenna was definitely right and so awesome! Strawberry -rosemerry lemonade was incredibly refreshing! And the Nitro coffee was unique and delicious as well! All-in-all, if we. One back to AS, we will definitely stop in again! Thanks Jenna for your amazing-ness."}
{"text":"We must have been there at a bad time. I've had breakfast here before and it was great. Today? Not so much. I ordered the caramelized banana and pecan french toast, one of the items that Over Easy is known for, with a side order of bacon and coffee to drink. The coffee was excellent. That's the good news. The bacon was way overcooked and I did mention it to the wait staff (she took it off our bill). The bananas were more like plantains, almost crunchy and not to my liking. The sauce didn't quite hit the right amount of sweetness; it fell ever so short of delicious. The bread itself was very good and I would try regular french toast there again. My dining mate's eggs were ordered over medium and they arrived over easy. She did, though, request a substitution of sausage patties and they accommodated her without a second thought. Her English muffin was perfectly toasted and her dessert of English muffin, jelly, and sausage was amazing.   Overall, my first visit to Over Easy a couple years ago was much more satisfying than this one, so I will try them again. Our server was fine and met our requests with a smile. They were not very busy when we were there and that may be the reason for overdone bacon, but the bananas were definitely \"off.\""}
{"text":"I agree with Laura E, Over Easy is now just Meh!!! What's happened to Over Easy?  HELLO Mr Owners of OE, your service and food have changed since your move and it's not a good change...  We've watched the decline of this little \"hole in da wall\" breakfast joint that used to be one of the best places to go in the mornings ~ Pre Food Network and Triple D....  I can see where your trying to accommodate more people in your new place but COME ON, I was elbowed twice while eating next to strangers beside us!  This is not a comfortable environment for dinning unless you want to get cozy and share your food with strangers...  The service was very disappointing, blunderous, and left us wanting.  Our drinks were not maintained and when we had issue concerning our meal our server told us it would be a while before we could get another order of pancakes, without an apology.   We had the chicken and waffles, which were ok ~ the chicken was nice and crisp but was a little over done. The waffle was flat and plain. We also had pancakes with sides of bacon and sausage. The pancakes were cold for some reason so we wanted to order some fresh but our server was not helpful. The bacon was very good as was the sausage.  We also had the Wolfpack, which was very good with two eggs, bacon and cheese between layers of crisp buttery hashbrownie goodness. Very filling but not something to order if your watching your carb in take.   I hope you listen to the Yelpers and make some changes soon.  There are too many other places to dine for breakfast and lunch that are as good if not better than you now.  After all the Food Network foodies have tried your place for the first and last time ~ The Yelpers (regulars) want the old Over Easy service and quality of food back please."}
{"text":"Great option for breakfast/brunch in Scottsdale area. Ordered the avocado eggs Benedict - so good. Service was a bit slow but overall great place !"}
{"text":"With today being a rainy day in the valley we decided to dine here for breakfast; figuring that there would not be much of a wait. We both had the El Pollo Loco Omelet  which was nice and feeling. And we shared the caramelized banana and pecan brioche french toast, surprisingly the French toast was nice with great depth of flavor and not too sweet. I liked the food here but I wasn't blown away. I say if you close by and want breakfast fare then this is your place but don't drive out of your way if there are other places close by that serve great food."}
{"text":"So, the only reason I came back her was because I had a Living Social Deal I purchased prior to my first visit and I had to use it.   Out of two dishes we ordered, one was excellent and the other was terrible.  So, I will say this, the food is inconsistent.  If they can remove or fix the bad menu items, I think this place will start getting a lot better reviews.  The prices are also pretty high for breakfast.  Build your own omelette was really good. The salmon with asparagus was disgusting.  Very salty, otherwise plain and small portion. The bread was stale. Hash browns are average.  I've improved my rating from last time because the omelette was so good."}
{"text":"greasy spoon - but i was expecting a little more upscale for some reason.... but literally, greasy spoon. the menus are placemats and could use a good soak in some bleach or something. mine or something at my table had this musty rotten smell... like old sweaty socks or gym towels left in a damp locker for a few months too long. it was unpleasant.   our waitress was... curt. one of my friends had been here before and been served by her and remembered the waitress had badmouthed/talked about her and her dining group to a nearby table! sigh.   the omelets are HUGE and hearty but much too overdone. the edges were crispy brown and the chicken in mine (the pollo loco) was uber dry. the tots were the greasy saving grace of this dish.   the waffle-dog... i honestly can't taste the difference between a pancake-sausage dog. it was ok, nothing phenomenal.   another friend had the 1/2 order french toast and iced coffee. she said it was all soooo sweet that she couldn't finish, and the iced coffee was watered down.   the prices are decent for the portions, and i like that you can do 1/2 orders on the carbs... BUT. but. it just wasn't good enough to make me wanna go back."}
{"text":",My husband, daughter and I stopped in on a Saturday morning for breakfast. We loved the atmosphere, well that was probably more me but still. It was very open and had a cheerful vibe to it. Our waiter was attentive and stopped in to check on us a good amount without being pushy.   Now onto the food... I tried the Corned Beef Benedict which was very flavorful with caramelized onions and hollandaise sauce in the mix. My husband tried the Wolf Pack and had nothing but good things to say about it. Though I can't remember what my daughter had, I do know she ate it all. Plus, the orange juice is fresh-squeezed and we all adored it.  I can't say it is my absolute favorite place for breakfast but I do know we will be back!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place.  Always a wait...but it's worth it!   This time I went with the \"Do it yourself\" Omelet.  I ordered asparagus, feta, and tomato and the waitress whispered...\"Why don't you add some jalapeño in there?\" So I did and I am glad I listened to her.  The omelet was huge and the veggies were cooked perfectly! I ordered the hash browns extra crispy and I think they may have forgotten...they were still good though!   To drink I went with the strawberry lemonade with rosemary.  DELISH!    My friend had the Wolfpack Club.  It is a bit on the pricy side...but he tends to never get full and for the first time in a while I heard him say, \"Well...that was enough! Weird!\" ;-)  Not much talking at the table so I'm assuming he also enjoyed his meal!    Can't wait to go back and try some sweet pancakes.  First visit there, I had the brioche french toast with caramelized bananas and nuts and that is so decadently delicious as well!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"So my hubby n I tried this place a few months ago, being a big breakfast connoisseur, this place had a lot to live up to but it couldn't. I ordered bacon eggs hash browns the American basic because it's the one meal a restaurant has to nail time and time again.My plate was not worth the price tag any greasy spoon would have been 2-3$ less and gave an abundant amount of food. My hash browns were cooked on the same grill as onions, had I been a fan of onions it would not ave been a big deal but I think onions ruin everything so cook hash browns on a CLEAN grill non-onion infused. Coffee was so/so I'm not expecting designer coffee but at least flavor other than coffee grinds. On the plus side servers were pleasant hubby's food was hot as was mine. Just not worth the $$$ and food was less than average. I prefer Cracker's in Mesa, or T.C. Eggington's for the same price."}
{"text":"After arriving at PHX Airport from our Colorado Springs vacation we wanted to try this place out after seeing them on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives this past weekend. It was a short 10 minute drive from the airport. We arrived just after 1:00pm (July 4th) and they were closing early (1:30pm) for the holiday. Guess that was a good thing cause the restaurant was almost empty except for two tables so there was no waiting at all. I ordered Banana nut French toast and George ordered Chicken fried steak, home fries and two eggs. My French toast had thick slices of toast and the perfect amount of toppings, it was very delicious. The chicken fried steak was delicious and I really loved their home fries. Service was outstanding, they were low on tea cause they were closing early but made a batch of tea just for George. So glad we came here, what a way to end our trip."}
{"text":"Management needs complete overhaul.  Poorly trained servers w tunnel vision and improperly handling food and money.  Food sat in the service window the entire time I was there.    Only 2 servers and one cook on staff at 9:00 am? Over easy has the perfect recipe 4 a terrible dining experience.     Food is average.   Stick with farmhouse or biscuits if dining 4 breakfast in this gilbert area."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast Saturday. Pretty busy, however also super slow. It was me and two others. We ordered two omelets and an egg breakfast. Waited almost 30 minutes for our food. Our waitress never came back to see if we wanted more coffee or water or anything until we complained about not getting our food yet.  The food was sub-par. Luke warm when we got it. Not seasoned well. I probably won't come back. I can see why restaurants like snooze are taking over business.  Definitely need work on service."}
{"text":"This is a nice place, clean, fresh and good service.  Every time I come here I try a different dish, because it is all good.  I've ordered the, Wolfpack with pepper jack cheese, which  I could not stop eating it.  Mexican breakfast is pretty awesome here as well. Next time I need to try out the mimosas and other breakfast drinks."}
{"text":"The portions here are huge.  I came in for breakfast and ended up having brunch.  There's no way I could have had another meal at midday.  I like the open feel of the dining room with views of the McDowells.  I was here around 9 AM on a Thursday and it wasn't crowded at all.  I had the two egg breakfast which came with hash browns, bacon and I subbed the toast for a pancake.  Everything was cooked perfectly.  When I'm hungry, this will be my new place for a morning meal."}
{"text":"Super busy. Sit at the bar is you can so you don't have to wait. Loved the clgren chili ork and grits."}
{"text":"This location is the best in the valley I have found thus far for CONSISTENTLY good chicken and waffles at a fair price (I've tried Jewel's Bakery and Cafe, Lolo's Chicken and Waffles in Phoenix, and another Over Easy location in North Scottsdale).  Chicken is usually as big as the waffle and is good quality chicken with yummy seasoning in the breading.  The waffle is my definition of a good waffle (slightly crunchy on the outside, soft and warm on the inside).  Lastly, I love that they serve REAL maple syrup with the chicken and waffles!  Looks nice and clean in the eating area and the service is fast and solid."}
{"text":"I bought a Groupon for Over Easy not realizing they were for a specific location.  My favorite location is on Indian School Rd - their chicken and waffles never fail to impress me. We came in on Saturday around 1 and it was practically empty, which I have not really encountered with other breakfast places on a Saturday. Though the hostess/waitress quickly wrapped up their conversation/put up their phones away, it still took the hostess about what felt like a minute to acknowledge us, they looked like teenagers, so not a huge deal, but still awkward to stand around waiting to be acknowledged as customers. To add to the uncomfortable atmosphere, the place looked dirty and a little run-down.   Our waitress on the other hand was great (not the same aforementioned waitress, this one was probably in her late 20's/early 30's).  She was super friendly, attentive, and helpful. She is the reason I added a star. As for the food - we ordered Chicken and Waffles, I took two bites and was done.  The chicken was low quality (hard/dense) and the waffle was your standard waffle with no real texture or flavor to it, kinda reminded me of an Eggo.  Also, no real maple syrup like the Indian School location. Lastly, we also got the Pancake/Sausage dogs on a stick which were okay, but not worth $12."}
{"text":"This was one of the few times where I truly enjoyed every single little thing about my breakfast experience. The food was phenomenal! Benedict's were unique and delicious, omelette was amazing, the banana French toast was unreal, and lastly the pancakes were the best I have ever had. The phenomenal food, complemented by the incredible coffee and adult beverages cannot be beat. If you go to this location make sure to ask for Zach as your server, made our experience even better, was very informative, personable, and funny. Hope you enjoy your experience as much as we did."}
{"text":"Visiting from Charleston, SC and decided to stop by after hearing about this place on  food network. Banana and pecan French toast is amazing and so is the wolf pack. Service was also fantastic."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place. They use local Hickman eggs, the coffee is very flavorful, and the menu has something that should satisfy everyone. Very friendly and efficient service too."}
{"text":"we come here about once a month and we are always satisfied. The food is very tasty and the service is very good. I was not very hungry and just ordered cottage cheese which was fine. My husband got the traditional breakfast and it looked gorgeous and he loved it and my step daughter had the breakfast burrito and said it was great."}
{"text":"This review is coming from someone who does not enjoy breakfast.  The skinny  My girlfriend found a great deal in living social for 10$ you would get 40$ credit but only in 10$ increments great deal for a great place. We decided to go on a Tuesday hoping it would not be too busy it was not they had plenty of seats and people kept coming in. I ordered the chicken fries steak with 2 eggs and hash browns the dish looked picture perfect with plenty of food not bad for 10$ the eggs were perfect and the hash browns are to die for the seasoning they use is amazing, the chicken fried steak was a bit salty to me but some hot sauce helped it out :-) my gf ordered a veggie breakfast sandwich and hash browns and she was very pleased. We sat at bar an asked for separate checks and we used 2 of the coupons we had both out meals came out to under 10$ with tip which was great the waitress didn't seem to thrilled for our savings, lol.  Overall this place is great and affordable the food is good and the parking is easy. I had to dodge a few kids while walking to car so please slow down while here :-)."}
{"text":"I had the eggs benedict with spinach and other good stuff... Can't remember what the name was but they were great! I'm not a breakfast person but I would go back here for it! Jeff was a fantastic server!!! the only thing I can complain about is the faucet in the ladies room doubles as a shower but other than that, awesome!  Original visit 1/5/14"}
{"text":"The only reason im giving this place three stars is because the food was pretty delicious. However the staff could not have seemed more miserable. We went in on MLK day and yes it was busy however you still should not take that out on the customers. Afterall, more customer=more money, right?  It seemed to almost bother them at the fact that people were wanting to eat there.  We sat at the bar since there was a 15 minute wait or so and our waitress never cracked a smile, she seemed quite annoyed to be working."}
{"text":"I came in on a weekday morning to eat breakfast and get some work done before a lunch meeting. Empty tables everywhere. Looked for a place to plug in; literally zero outlets available. No wi-fi either. Asked why not, and was referred to the owner. She told me she isn't set up to serve those cheapskates who hang out all day using up her resources. She told me to go next door to the Safeway and eat breakfast there. I couldn't believe my ears. What a way to treat a patron! No wonder so many tables were empty. If that attitude is coming from the top down, there's no hope for this place to improve. I had been a regular customer, visiting on average 3x/mo and recommending the restaurant to friends and business associates. I won't be doing that anymore."}
{"text":"This place is delicious. I've been to a few locations. This one and the Indian School restaurants are great. Service is good too. We will be back tomorrow."}
{"text":"Over Easy just opened by my house so I figured we had to try it, why not.. Right?  We were greeted promptly by a very nice lady, the place is bright almost to bright yellow for my liking, the table and chairs are very retro and I LOVE THEM!! the music was a mix of stuff I've never heard of. We were offered fresh squeezed orange juice which I thought was great you don't see that often. I ordered the Wolf Pack with sausage patties, feta cheese and over medium eggs, my eggs were over cooked, no flavor , toast was burnt...and trying to get someone to check back on you was impossible!  Hubby had  the cheddar jalapeño biscuits with sausage gravy and scrambled eggs..again nothing to write home about. For us it's not a place I'd want to try again :("}
{"text":"I love the food network and glad I went to try Over Easy!!  My friend and I got the Waffle dog, Brioche french toast with bananas and walnuts, and Biscuits and gravy....and it was THE BEST Biscuits and gravy I've ever had!!!  The gravy had large chunks of meat, sausages and bacon in it!  It was very hearty and delicious!!  The Waffle dog was like a corndog, but better!  And it was served with a chili maple syrup... YUM!!  The brioche french toast w/ bananas and walnuts was another home run!!  The place was very clean with a great server who was very attentive and offered great suggestions!  Overall experience was excellent!!  I can't wait to take another trip to Arizona to eat their food!"}
{"text":"I think Over Easy is a very nice breakfast place. Yes, it is more expensive then Ihop and Denny's but the food is really good and has some unique options. I have had in my visits the Dolly breakfast sandwich (egg, tomato, bacon on a English muffin), brioche French toast (plain and Banana's Foster) and the chocolate chip pancakes. Service is also good and overall, it's a nice breakfast place."}
{"text":"We order the waffle dogs as seen on Food Network's \"the best thing I've ever ate\" and it was not as delicious as we anticipated.  It was not as crispy as we would have liked. The waffle didn't appear to have been cooked to a nice crisp.  We also had the 1/2 order of Caramelized banana & pecan brioche French toast and that was amazing!  The best was the chicken fried steak.  OMG, it was SOOO good!  Nice and crispy on the outside and the sauce complimented the chicken fried steak very nicely.  I would highly recommend this dish.  I'll definitely be back for this dish."}
{"text":"I would have rated it 4.5 if I could have, but rounded up. The only reason 4.5 and not 5 because I (just me and not my girlfriend saying this) thought the potatoes and French toast couldb have been warmer.  I got the Deli benedict and the caramelized banana & pecan brioche french toast.   This is the 3rd time at over easy (2 other times in North Scottsdale) and solid service solid food. Cool atmosphere. This place was renovated in December says one of the waitresses.   Come give em a try!   Cheers!"}
{"text":"Stopped by this place while waiting for my car to be maintenances at Earnhardt. I heard it was good but I personally had to see for myself. I was torn between two different dishes and Chris, the waiter said he could give me a smaller portion of one of the dishes so I could try them both out. That's called great customer service. I tried them both and was impressed. Thanks Chris for suggesting the customization of my order.  The food network has visited this place often and had them on their program. I am not surprised as the food was outstanding!  You can get both lunch and dinner at the same time which is a big plus. Would I come back?  Absolutely. If you have not tried this place better Git-R-Done!"}
{"text":"I have to preface my comments with the fact that the service was a bit spotty on the day I went into Over Easy. My waiter explained that he's never seen it that busy at 10:30 on a Friday morning. I had to sit at the counter with my party of 4 which is less than ideal.  As for the food, it was very good but not the best I've ever had for breakfast. My group started with the waffle dogs which is basically a corn dog with breakfast sausage inside. It was pretty good because it was very light but a little bland. The waiter mixed hot sauce and syrup together which took the whole dish up a notch.  I chose the chicken fried steak which was extremely good, the batter was light and had a lot of flavor. My friends got the mediterrian omlet, a breakfast sandwichs. They seemed to enjoy what the got as well but like I said... no one was blown away.   We've all had monents when breakfast can take it to the next level and this is a great place to get breakfast but it's not the be all end all."}
{"text":"I had high expectations for a DDD place. My wife got an omelette and tater tots that were really good! I got blueberry pancakes and half order of pumpkin French toast. It was not very good  The coffee was good and the service was fine! Would not go out of our way to return"}
{"text":"Never had a bad breakfast here.  Try the chicken and waffles,  chicken crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.  Jenn is a great server."}
{"text":"We've been going to Over Easy - Gilbert for a couple of years and I finally felt compelled to give this place a review. The staff and food is exceptional. Jeff, Chris, and Angela do an awesome job running the restaurant and all their servers, host staff and cooks are attentive and helpful. This review though is mainly about Daniella, bar server and floor server. She is without a doubt the best sever I have ever had. She is constantly checking on each customer while multitasking whether it's making drinks, squeezing OJ, preparing children's cups, running food, overall making each person feel they are the most important person in the restaurant. She is extremely attentive and puts each customer first. She is the definition of exceptional customer service. If I had a restaurant, she would be my number one draft pick. Great Job Over Easy..."}
{"text":"Is this a former Taco Bell?  Anyway, after the hype dies down I think this will be a place that I add to my mix of breakfast spots.  We waited about 30 minutes for a tiny little space at the counter, but this seemed reasonable, as the crowd waiting outside was smaller than we'd ever seen.  I had an egg white omelet w/ wild mushrooms and hashbrowns and my dining companion had a different egg dish w/, get this, a side of Recess Pieces pancakes (yes, I had a bite and yes, they were really yummy)!  If you're not going for gourmet, the food won't disappoint.  As other reviewers have said, the coffee is very good.  The mix of Scottsdale hangovers and Arcadia church goers makes the people watching fun (if you're not seated in front of a brick wall) and the staff was charming - despite the craziness!"}
{"text":"For $75 and over an hour wait (after our order was taken) this place makes the list for places I will not be returning to. The service was horrible food portions we more like kids sizes and not worth wha you pay."}
{"text":"Good place to go if you're hungry and don't want to cook breakfast.  Not great due to the fact that most of their food is straight from the freezer to the frying pan and just so-so.  Small portions of bland food.  Great people and great service.  Just altogether blah food."}
{"text":"I've had the chicken fried steak with eggs here last time and it was mediocore at best, the meat was too thin and it was overcooked and dry.  The second time I came we ordered two omelettes, one with swiss, corned beef and mushrooms and the mediterranean with corned beef.  Both omelettes were very distasteful, the eggs were dry and tasteless, he corned beef had the wrong texture and resembled sausage, and the veggies were not cooked in well with the eggs. They also mixed up our orders by putting the wrong sides in, and they forgot to add cheese to one of the orders making the omelette extremely bland.  I don't know how they could've messed up our orders to this extent when there was literally no one there except us.  Overall, both experiences make me not want to come back here and I regret not paying attention to the three-star rating on yelp."}
{"text":"I mean, I loved their freshly squeezed OJ and the pumpkin French toast, we got more food for a way smaller price at Butterfield's. We love trying new places and my omelet was really good but I wish it wasn't a dollar to add mushrooms or spinach or even tomatoes because I had to use my third and last choice on a cheese... Good food, just not enough for how much it was."}
{"text":"Waffle dogs are good and worth getting again. I am bias toward food on a stick and breakfast food though so my review is surely colored. A breakfast on stick what can be wrong with that."}
{"text":"My hubby suggested trying this place out due to his love of \"Loco Moco\" and the difficulty of finding a restaurant who served it.  Upon entering the decor is modern, music pumping, a sweet bar serving WHAT?  That's right, alcohol!  We were seated promptly without a smile (someone was having a bad day apparently) and then it took 10 + minutes to be greeted by our waitress, who did apologize and took our order promptly and was served within 5 minutes.  I had the blueberry pancakes with powdered sugar and maple syrup.  Pancakes were a huge 3 stack with plenty of blueberries...unfortunately the pancakes were as dry as cardboard.  Hubby's Loco Moco was a smaller portion than anticipated, the burger patty was paper thin, however the eggs were cooked well along with the rice.    This isn't one of those places that I wouldn't say \"hey!  I gotta go there again!\" unless I needed a nice cold Kilt Lifter at 7 am in the morning with my breakfast."}
{"text":"Was such a bad restaurant that my mom got physically sick after eating the Chicken Fried Steak. I had the Malted Waffle and it was no better (or bigger) than an Eggo waffle. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"It's goodie what it is....basic B...breakfast. Nothing fancy. It was just good ole breakfast. Not worth it for the price, but not terrible if you are in the area and its your only option."}
{"text":"Been here several times over the past year and not once have I had a bad meal or service.  I say order the \"Over Easy\" with a half order of their French Toast. You wouldn't be dissatisfied."}
{"text":"Every time I come here, I'm impressed by menu selections.  Every time I eat here, I wonder why I came back.     Should the mushrooms in a healthy choice omelet really be swimming in butter?  Next time I will order the breakfast burrito stuffed with double tots instead of hash browns.  That seemed to be the popular choice."}
{"text":"The perfect place for hangover food! I cannot believe it took me so long to make my way to Over Easy... but it was worth the wait for sure!  Today I went to brunch at Over Easy with a party of 4 (that's the way to go by the way, so that you can taste  a bit of everything!)  Needless to say, we'd all had a few too many drinks last night, and we needed a good greasy spoon, fill your tummy, type of meal.  We arrived around 10:15 on a Saturday and had about a 20 minute wait, but it went by fast and was so worth it!  Brian hooked us up with a table inside and our server brought us ice waters and coffee immediately.  There were so many menu items that sounded amazing, so we decided to start with the waffle for the table as an appetizer.  Yum!  (It's got a vanilla malt flavor that is out of this world good!)  We also ordered a side of crispy bacon for the table - such a treat!  I went with the egg white asparagus omelet and added mushrooms to it plus a side of hash browns.  The asparagus was seriously some of the best I've had and I cleaned my plate!  Jared went with steak and eggs over sleazy - it looked so good I had to taste it and that too was fantastic!  The other couple we were with enjoyed their entrees too.  Although I didn't try them, the 'tots' looked good and I would suggest hash browns or tots before the breakfast potatoes.  As you can imagine, this was a ton of food for the four of us, but since we were all hungover and hungry, we did pretty well with it... With tip, I think the total for all of us was just under $60 - it may seem expensive, but it was worth every penny!  I usually like some fruit, tomato, yogurt, or cottage cheese options.  That's the only reason for 4 stars instead of 5.  I think they keep it simple because of their limited space in this location.  With that said, Chef Aaron May and his team are on a roll with great restaurant concepts and I'm definitely a loyal fan.  I'll be back to Over Easy again soon as well as continue to frequent Sol Y Sombra and the up and coming new restaurants when they open as well!"}
{"text":"Thank you triple D. Because of you we tried this place and loved it! Fresh ingredients. Attentive staff. All around, yum! 2 of the people in my party got the Carmel banana pancakes, the half order. So delicious!!! I got the Selena which I liked that I could customize it just for me. $3 bloody Mary's. You simply cannot go wrong."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of over easy. Slightly strange ambiance, I admit! It's a renovated old school taco bell that was turned into a brunch place with outside seating.   Pros: Malted Waffle with cinnamon chocolate syrup is my favorite item and I don't even usually like waffles.  Great mint lemonade   Cons:  Service can be slow Limited Parking"}
{"text":"Pro: Good portions, quick service, TASTY Con: Stingy on the red-eye gravy  We heard about Over Easy on the food Network and Guy's Triple \"D.\"  This was my first time to Phoenix, and we had a VERY early flight out of Minneapolis, so we arrived, got our car and immediately set out in search of this restaurant.  We arrived on a Sunday morning to find a packed parking lot, a line around the side of the building and didn't know what we should think.  We were able to park next door at the Vig and went to the host; we lucked out and immediately got seated at the bar.  The stools were comfortable, though a bit unique style that nearly thrust you forward to the counter. Nearly as soon as we sat, we were provided with a tall glass of ice water and a waitress saying she'd be with us in a few moments.  The menu was simple to navigate, the food options looked fantastic and the cook staff in the kitchen were firing on all cylinders.  My ham steak with hasbrowns was great, though it lacked the flood of gravy I had sought.  Wife's breakfast was equally good.  On my way out, I got a cup of the house iced coffee.  Flavored with cinnamon, cardamom and mint, it was a bounty of spice.  Though, I wish I'd tasted it before I left.  I would've added more sugar.  A good meal, perhaps worth the wait.   Best if you can get right in."}
{"text":"Green Chile Pork over Black Pepper/Parmesan Grits...Sunnyside-up Egg on top!! Need I say more...Delicious!!"}
{"text":"Oh wolfpack, you beckon my return. Your crunchy/crisp hash browns just cannot be replicated at home. One order supplies 2-3 meals for me. Freshly squeezed OJ mimosa is possible when desired."}
{"text":"Food was comparable to Denny's or Ihop but twice as much. Plus, it took 20 minutes to get a table. The house iced coffee is GOD awful idk what they put in it but YUCK!!!"}
{"text":"I liked it. It is a guy's breakfast place but my picky wife liked it too. We were only in town for 5 days but we ate there twice. Service was great"}
{"text":"Maybe my favorite \"Breakfast Place\" in Phoenix.  My general \"rule of thumb\" is to NOT give good or great ratings until I have been several times. I have been here so often that I have had many of the menu items, from the very simple to the unique and original and have seldom been disappointed. The exception is the Corned Beef Hash. A different take on that traditional, as are many of the \"Specialties,\" but just NOT hearty enough for me and the portion, much unlike most everything else, was fairly skimpy.  Bacon to die for, eggs always as requested, toast and hash browns are excellent and the service is always fast and courteous. That being said, I am not at all certain what other Reviewers experienced when they give this little place a less than stellar review.  Never did for lunch, but Breakfast is a winner!"}
{"text":"I give this place 5 stars! We were greeted by the hostess immediately as we walked in.. our server Daniella is awsome to say the least. She answered all our questions regarding the menu and helped us choose the best plate! I ordered the Chilaquiles and my husband ordered the breakfast burger. They were both delicious and the cook made our eggs just as we specified (rearly happens). Overall, great breakfast and kind staff!!"}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for restaurants/chefs that have been featured on The Food Network or Top Chef. I'm also a sucker for a hearty breakfast. Over Easy fits the bill for both.  We arrived around 10:30a & only had to wait about 10 minutes. I ordered the Tammy (egg whites with spinach, Swiss cheese, garlic and onion on an English muffin) & Ryan ordered the Cheddar-Jalapeno biscuits & sausage gravy. Next time I'm getting those waffle dogs.  My sandwich was delish & the sweet potato tater tots were amazing. Big portion but definitely doable if you're hungry. I tried some of Ryan's plate & it was phenomenal. We were on the hunt in Minneapolis for the best biscuits & gravy and this place would have won that competition.    This is the type of place I'll bring visitors to so they think I'm in the know :)"}
{"text":"IHOP or Dennys quality food. This place fell short of my expectations. I simply do not understand the good reviews or hype. Nothing about this place is memorable outside of the fun décor. Inattentive waitress who commented that she orders the dish that I had ordered when she is hungover. Very greasy food. Did not taste fresh- especially the eggs. Overpriced. We will not return."}
{"text":"Great service, clean place, and a huge menu!  It was hard to choose but Julian helped us navigate through several choices and we landed on the chiliquiles with two over medium eggs and the wolf pack with same type of eggs.  We are in love with this great place and although it's a bit of drive for us; it will be on one of our regular places when we are wanting a bit to eat and are close to the Mesa/Gilbert area."}
{"text":"Got the berry mimosa...yummm...and the wolfpack with goat cheese, eggs ever easy and country gravy...seriously delicious. Huge portions so be prepared to share! Cute diner feel and the staff was very friendly :) Will need to come back to sample the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"This place is the perfect blend of cool atmosphere and good food.  Just what you want on a weekend morning or any morning for that matter.  Classic foods, not greasy  or nasty, totally hit's the spot.  Not gourmet either, so don't expect it.  There will be a wait, especially on the weekends, so be ready!  Another party that waited LESS than us totally whined and complained, made the server feel horrible and then got compt'd by the manager because they are complainers.  Karma will get them, jerks.  The server was super nice to us, we let management know it too.  Overall, had good experiences here.  A little cramped, but it is what it is.  Will come back when ever we're back in town."}
{"text":"Super cute breakfast place we discovered today!  I had the cheese and mushroom omlette that came with potatoes.  It's definitely not a healthy eating place, although they do offer one option with egg whites.  It's very small but in a cute way with a great patio.  Couldn't give 5 stars becuase of the lack of variety.  Only 3 omlette options and that's just not enough for this gal.  Overall a super cute place to go with great, friendly, quick service!"}
{"text":"Over Easy has a  pleasant atmosphere,and a polite and timely staff.  The food, however was lack-luster.  Bland steak (only available as well-done) with incorrectly cooked eggs, left me wanting.   To boot the mimosa was small, and mostly juice.    I am aware that these issues might be circumstantial, but at $6 for a mimosa, and $12 for some dry steak these mistakes should be avoided.   Easily done by a manager (whom I never saw) or any employee with a degree of tenure looking over the dish prior to going to its table.       Overall not a terrible experience, but when this restaurant is surrounded by other breakfast places, it makes a lousy argument for a return visit.   They also can't do separate checks."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch is BUSY!  We waited 25 mins for a table for 5.  This is the new location.  The place is packed and LOUD inside.  We were seated in the back.    The table was a little sticky and the laminated menus were wet.  Our server greeted us immediately and took our drink orders.  The menu is simple and short, love it.  But I am with indecisive people.  The server had to come back twice before everyone decided on what to order.    I ordered the The Crying Pig omelet (Bacon, Sausage & Swiss cheese) and hash browns.  The omelet was a little over done on the edges but perfect in the middle.  The hash browns were good and greasy!  I ordered a 1/2 order of the french toast to share with other person.  The 1/2 piece I got tasted kind of burnt but the part that was not tasted great.    I am with Michael F. on this place 3 for the food and 4 for the service.  Overall 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"I love the food here and the customer service is great, plus the price is hard to beat."}
{"text":"We love OE, their servers are friendly and attentive and the food is always hot and fresh. I get the build your own omelette, hubby gets breakfast burrito, both are excellent. Fair prices and a nice patio, too. We go at least 3x/month."}
{"text":"We came on a Friday morning around 10am and there was about a 20 minute wait.   Food (4 stars):   Chicken fried steak! A must order item on the menu. Ground beef formed in a hamburger patty with a crispy shell since it was battered. The steak is smothered with a white gravy that contains onions and tiny pieces of sausages. The dish also comes with a choice of eggs and potatoes. I had the hashbrown and it was cooked to perfection! I love the outer layer of my hashbrown crispy and hate it when it is not cooked to that point.   The fiancee had the loko moco and I had a couple bites. The loko moco is cooked hamburger patty smothered with dark gravy sauce under a bed of rice and topped with grilled onions and fried onions and finally a choice of eggs. The loko moco was decent but I did not prefer the flavors since the gravy tasted like red wine and parts of the rice was burnt.   We ordered the caramelized bananas and pecan french toast. The fiancee hates bananas and asked our waiter not to include the bananas. But when the ordered came there was no sauce or pecans so I think there was a misunderstanding. We sent it back and asked for the sauce and pecan and let me tell you, if you do not like bananas, just order the plain french toast because the sauce also tasted like bananas.   Another thing I tried that sounded interesting thing on the menu was the over easy iced coffee. The drink had too much cinnamon taste and did not have as much coffee or sweet flavor that I wanted.   Service (3 stars): Our waiter was busy waiting on a lot of tables, if anything it seemed like he was the only waiter there! I felt bad for the guy. We had a problem with our order and another person had to fix the problem since our waiter was too busy.   Ambiance (4 stars): Cute 50s style diner decor! The menu is also very cute.   Overall, I might come back if I am ever in town and if I am craving for some chicken fried steak!"}
{"text":"This is the BEST place I ate at during my time in AZ. I read about Over Easy in an article a while back and decided I wanted was going to try it I when I came to Phoenix.  We unknowingly showed up a few minutes after 1 and they close at 1:00. However because I was from out if town they fired the grill back up and served us anyway. Which in itself was beyond what we expected. We all placed our orders and each dish was just as amazing as the next. The bacon was literally the best I've EVER had and the coffee was great. And our server Sarah was absolutely wonderful!   This will certainly be a stop I'll make time for every time I make it to Phoenix.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for breakfast. It was pretty busy, we had to wait about 20 minutes for a table. You should definately come hungry because the portions are large. I had the malted waffle, turkey bacon and an over easy egg. The waffle was tender, light and fluffy. My husband had jalapeño cheddar biscuits and gravy. They had just the right amount of spice. I would have given them 5 stars but was disappointed and a little disgusted with the restroom. They have 2 restrooms that are unisex. Apparently I picked the one that the men mainly use because there was pee on the floor in front of the toilet. Disgusting!!! I just about lost my breakfast. I understand that the staff can't go in to check the restrooms after every customer. But why wouldn't they just make one restroom for women and one for men. Since they do have 2 available for use. I don't want to sit in someone else's pee.  My suggestion would be to check the floor before you sit."}
{"text":"Had lunch here after a hike.  The menu looked great.  Very limited (maybe 20 items) but all sounded and looked amazing.  Tried the sausage wrapped pancakes, I think that's what it was called.  AWESOME!  Had the breakfast burrito , you build your self, really good also.  Perfect for after a morning hike!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  Basic menu, AMAZING FOOD! Everything is good. Had the Biscuits and Gravy, Cheddar Jalapeno biscuits, awesome. Corn Beef hash is maybe the best I have ever had.  Take a change and try anything!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in to eat brunch while we were in town visiting. The food was fresh, delicious and hot. My husband ordered the eggs and fresh hash with sourdough toast. He had berry jam that is made in house. He really liked the jam. I ordered the breakfast sandwich that had two large eggs on an English muffin with two fresh tomato slices and thick slices of bacon topped with Swiss cheese and a mayo spread. The coffee was hot and strong. It is their own blend. The ice water was good. Our waiter was very nice and attentive.  The restaurant was clean and bright. The restroom was clean. It was busy while we were there. It is in a good location, at the edge of the Superstition Springs Mall.  It definitely gets people in and I think they have regulars too. There are other locations throughout the valley. It's a good place to visit for breakfast, brunch or even lunch. Prices are comparable to other restaurants in the valley of the sun :)"}
{"text":"I decided to try this place bcuz Guy Fieri had been here, I must say I wasn't all that thrilled w my food now that I think about it.  We had a Selena breakfast burrito $9 & the banana caramel French toast $8 and the over iced coffee wit cinnamon. Cardamom n mint. It was good but could have been better. I dont think the hype for this place is merited, but maybe we ordered the wrong items. Also I kind of felt that we did not get good service, maybe bcuz we were the only latinos :( and it was not that busy"}
{"text":"Hidden gem in the shopping mall.  Excellent choice for a great breakfast and a Bloody Mary. Alex our waitress had a bubbly and vivacious personality enhancing our foodie experience.  Priced right.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Inconsistent food quality weekday mornings versus weekend mornings .  This second visit I ordered the same as last... Chicken fried steak and eggs to celebrate my low cholesterol numbers from my doc lol.  Chicken fried steak was fried --so fried it looked like it was scraped off the bottom of the pan.  Borderline almost sent back.  Eggs were fine.  Didn't order coffee as they don't have any flavored creamers.  Behind the flavored creamer wagon train on that one... Service is nice and friendly.  I'll come back but try something new next time."}
{"text":"Father's Day Breakfast - Our waitress was adorable, but it took forever to get our food and the place wasn't even half full.  Hard toast, tasteless omelet.  Since the waitress was so nice, I'm adding a star; otherwise, it would be a one star.  Not going back again.  Darn it..... was hoping we had a new restaurant to frequent for breakfast."}
{"text":"Very loud and i mean very loud. I had eggs florentine benedict and it had absolutely no flavor the same issue with my husbands omelette.  The corned beef tasted of ham and not Beef.  The soda is very watered-down also.  First time and will be last."}
{"text":"I had gone a second time to give their caramelized banana french toast a chance to makeup for last times visit.  As you can see by my rating. The french toast was good but something that i wouldn't say is caramelized for beginners and then I can easily make this stuff at home for half the price. My friend had ordered the reeeses pancakes and said it taste like a normal pancakes with hints of reeses bites  every couple of bites.  Think this will have been my final visit."}
{"text":"So, I gave them another shot. This time, similar lackluster service. Appeared unhappy to be here. Left my eggs Benedict under the heat lamp to long. Yolks were rock hard, hah browns were cold. Had them make another batch. They were great, piping hot.   With all of the other places to get breakfast, why bother with this one?"}
{"text":"When we got there they said the wait would be 15-20 minutes. 35 minutes later we had to ask and they said it would be another 15-20 minutes. Finally they ended up sitting us about 30 minutes later. The food was not at all what I had expected. The waffle was very plain - no garnish or anything came with it. It tasted like sawdust. The pancakes were also very bland and their syrup is very watery and jus sits ont he table so it is not warm. The whites of my eggs were runny even though I had asked for over medium and the chicken fried steak was overcooked so it the crust was hard. The sweet potato tots were mushy and lacked flavor at all. Our entire party was very disappointed."}
{"text":"This was our first time at Over Easy. We visited the Warner location on a Sunday at lunchtime. It was very busy, but we only had to wait a few minutes. We were so hoping for a great breakfast place to add to our list of favorites; however, this is not one of them.   My husband ordered eggs, bacon and hash browns with toast. He specifically ordered his fried eggs with NO SLIME on the whites and the yolks runny. The grill was obviously too hot since the eggs came out quite crispy on the edges but still slimy on top of the whites. Both of these issues are a cardinal sin in my husband's book! His hash browns were barely brown and the toast was only slightly toasted...no brown in sight and cold enough that the butter didn't melt on it!   I ordered the fruit and yogurt bowl expecting a great bowl of mixed fruit with some yogurt on top. What I received was a rather large bowl of yogurt (too much for me!) topped with some fruit...a few blueberries, strawberries and cantaloupe. I think they could have done MUCH better with the variety of fruit since there is so much in the grocery store right now.   There were a LOT of waiters and waitresses, so service was pretty fast...our waitress was very friendly and efficient on only her 2nd day on the job, which was a plus.   However, we're still trying to decide if we want to give it another try since it was mediocre at best. Maybe if we order something else..."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place since my brother saw it on TV. That said, I believe it is EXTREMELY unfair to jack up your expectations just because a restaurant was on TV. Come on people!  There are so many  food shows on the air these days that soon it will be more common to NOT have been featured on Some Food Show than the other way around!  While I concur with many fellow reviewers that the place did not bowl me over and was a bit pricey, I did have great service and good food overall.  The specifics:  SERVICE: Prompt, friendly, suggestive and accomodating.   FOOD: I always appreciate a place that lets me order \"fatty\" or \"soft\" bacon. I also liked that I could order 2 slices or 4 (4 of course! Bacon is Meat Candy after all). The Brioche French Toast with carmelized bananas and pecans was just okay. The bread was light and soft so as not to be so filling that I couldn't finish it but caremelized shouldn't mean sitting in carmel sauce. There should be some crispy, pan-fried texture to it and there wasn't so I was disappointed. It tasted like a canned sauce. Not good enough, especially being that this was one of their signature dishes.   Orange Juice and coffee were both fresh and I got lucky and wasn't charged for both so my bill was about $3 less than it should've been, which means my breakfast would've been about $21 with tip for one person. That's a bit high, although it is Scottsdale so I let that go.  SETTING/DECOR: Clean, diner-like setting with great mountain views.  OVERALL: Not bad. I would return if/when I'm in the area. I look forward to trying some of the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Slow service and bland food. Not worth the money spent.  Save your money and go to the other breakfast places nearby."}
{"text":"Over Easy is a cool new breakfast spot. The location is cool being attached to the Ice Den. Our waiter was happy and helpful. We could not decide on a single meal so we split 2.  We enjoyed the Wolfpack and the three eggs w/ steak. The Wolfpack was delicious and the eggs were delicious. The steak was tough and chewy. We will overlook the steak and will be back frequently. The patio is ideal and the views of the McDowell Mountains are good."}
{"text":"RECOMMENDED: 4 words...  Sean's Croatian Spinach Loaf!  I've eaten at the North Scottsdale location before and loved it. Being a creature of habit, I usually ordered the Wolfpack. This visit changed all of that. I ordered Sean's Croatian Spinach Loaf and it is absolutely amazing!  I tasted why it's an award winning entrée. Trust me and your taste buds can thank me later!  I liked it so much, I visited the North Scottsdale location 2 days later and ordered it again!  One thing worth pointing out is consistency runs true at both locations. The service is top notch.  The restaurant is buzzing with energy and the staff rocks."}
{"text":"The Caramel Banana Pecan French Toast was just good, the best part of it was the brioche bread, it was sweet and buttery. What would I have changed? Instead of straight caramel sauce I would have made a caramel syrup. The syrup would have given it the feel of French toast and not made ne feel like I consumed a cup of caramel. Also the bananas we doused in the caramel which made them gooey, I would prefer fresh bananas on top. And lastly they just sprinkle plain pecans on top, they need to candy the pecans in butter, brown sugar and cream cheese. As for the biscuits, they were sooooo tasty, moist, unique and satisfying. The only downfall is it said jalapeño on the menu and there was not one hit of jalapeño. I was looking for a good kick in the pants spice, but nothing.  But still worth the eat for sure!! I definitely suggest going to Over Easy. They have a unique and classic menu and they taste so fresh. Next time I'll try the waffle dogs and the chicken fried steak!"}
{"text":"After eating at the location in Gilbert off Civic Center and having a great experience, we were happy to find a location closer to home, in Mesa. Well, we won't be coming back to this location. The chicken fried steak was really greasy, the steak was super thin and none of it had any flavor. The side order of jalapeño biscuits and gravy was also a huge disappointment as the biscuits were very over cooked. The server was very understanding and got us new food (waffles)."}
{"text":"Plain and simple, the best waffle in Phoenix. No, it's not a Belgian waffle, it's the thin and crispy type. Always busy on weekend mornings, so arrive early or expect to wait to be seated if you have more than two in your party. Other items are good as well, but I always order the same. Waffle & Bacon, loaded up with their ball of butter and maple syrup."}
{"text":"Service was good even tho it was packed early Sunday morning. The food was fine but the brioche French toast with \"caramelized bananas\" was not good! Caramelized means cooked in butter with sugar. This was plain old bananas sliced into a super cinnamon-y, gloppy sauce poured over French toast. I ate 2 bites & was grossed out. I ordered 1 egg & came on a saucer. I'd eat there again but would stick to basics."}
{"text":"Very happy with the service and attentiveness, however, food was mediocre.  I had florentine Benedict and the sauce was pretty tasteless.  Wife had the Over Easy, and it was pretty standard eggs over bacon.  Not memorable."}
{"text":"Food was excellent.  Danielle was our server and was helpful and quite friendly.  She made the experience that much better."}
{"text":"This is about as good as it gets for brunch food.  As self-proclaimed foodies and avid brunch eaters, my siblings and sister-in-law tried out this place when we were visiting Phoenix.  I was highly impressed with the menu options, and the spread we ordered was no disappointment.  We shared all our entrees, so I can comfortably say favorites included:  Salmon, asparagus, capers Chilaquiles (!!!) Waffles Banana french toast brioche  They were all amazing.  The decor is cute and welcoming (I especially am a fan of the bright yellow walls), and the service was excellent.  I loved the outdoor sitting area, although it was a tad too hot in July to enjoy it.  Great brunch spot!"}
{"text":"Eh, Service was good and good came out quick. Food was just okay. I had the Florentine eggs Benedict, it had too much spinach. My son had the chocolate chip pancake... I though the chips would be in the pancakes on top. He only ate a couple bits and my friend had some type of omelette. He ate all his and didn't exclaim if it was good or bad. So for his food was just eh. It's cool to eat if your close and hungry, but I wouldn't go out of my way."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, always attentive and excellent environment. We got the brioche French toast with Carmel Drizzle, it was amazing! We also got the chilequilas, biscuits and gravy, and breakfast sandwich.  Everything was great except the chilequilas. It seems like they used Doritos for the chips. Traditionally it's made with tortilla strips with the sauce and maybe eggs and a meat. I've seen places use tortilla chips to make for a faster process but never Doritos.  Sure I could be wrong but these chips were seasoned exactly like Doritos or made by the same company. The food was good, location great but the chilequilas preparation was a no go for me. I ordered another breakfast sandwich.   I would've be back because the overall food seemed pretty simple. If I was going out to eat I want something that I can't find at another restaurant. I'm looking for that unique taste. But maybe I'm picky."}
{"text":"We just tried this place yesterday and loved it.  Everything was great.  Best Mediterranean omelet ever.  Kids had french toast and waffles and loved them.  Definitely going back for more.  Plus they are next to 18 degrees so after breakfast you can watch some sports, hang out for lunch and have some drinks or get some ice skating in."}
{"text":"Order a country fried steak.. it was nasty! I could not cut into it. As I tried biting into it I felt like I was chewing on a tire. Waste of my money. If you sale something that terrible than you should just take it off your menu. I wouldn't offend dogs that piece of meat. Plus, the name of the place is called Over Easy. How do you get that part of my order wrong? I know I didn't asked for well done eggs.."}
{"text":"This place is nothing special. The portions are large, but still overpriced. I paid $12 for a breakfast burrito. As part of that price, you get to choose your protein. I'm vegetarian, so I opted for veggies and got to choose one. Seems a bit stingy for a $12. The atmosphere is a bit dingy. Indoor seating is exceptionally minimal. There is a VERY large patio for outdoor seating. Unfortunately, when I went, it was still too warm out to sit on the patio. I'm not a coffee drinker, but the friend I was with said the coffee was abysmal."}
{"text":"Was on my way to see Taliesin West and needed some nourishment.  Found this place using the Yelp app on my phone.  It was nearby and had some decent reviews.  I found the place not too crowded given the hour I was there and sat at the counter.  Everyone was really nice and friendly.  The menu had lots to choose from and healthy options as well.  Not being able to decide I asked the waitress and she recommended the breakfast burrito.  Lots of ingredients to choose from and my order was in front of me lighting fast.  Huge portion.  No way I could eat it all but it was very good and chatting with the staff behind the counter made for a great experience.  I would go again next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Epicly Awesome!  Great Food!  Awesome Staff!  I love this place!"}
{"text":"I came over to visit because I was lazy to cook myself breakfast.  I remember having breakfast at Over Easy years ago and I remember waiting a good hour and a half for a table so I wanted to come by again and see if there is still a fuss about this place.    Now, I did come a little later on a Sunday morning (around 10:30am).  I like to sleep in.  There was a 10 minute wait and the restaurant was not that crowded.  I ordered the mushroom chicken omelet (Pollo Loco). It was good and they were not at all greedy with the cheese.  Every bite was just a string of cheese after a string after a string... Makes me wonder how much cheese I actually consumed.    The chicken was a little dry and unflavorful, but I still ate til I was full. Service was mediocre.  Ambiance is eh - there are tv's displaying football games so I guess my bf can say that was a plus.    I am not sure if I would go back again, but I am glad that I came to visit."}
{"text":"I went there and thought it was perfectly fine.  Nothing out of the ordinary.  Friendly and hardworking servers, quickly made food, good eggs.  Just what I'd expect from an average diner.  I'd like to try some of their more unique dishes and might add a star depending on how those turn out."}
{"text":"Over Easy is one of my favorite restaurants, but my experience at this location today was awful.   Our Bloody Mary's were made completely bland- just a splash of vodka and some mix on top. Other servers were adding additional ingredients, but our did not. We waited one hour from the time we ordered our food until the time it reached our table. Our server checked in one time to let us know that the kitchen was busy but offered no apology. Our French toast came out completely cold.   When I discussed our concerns with our server, we were not offered an apology but just an \"Ill see what I can do.\" We were not searching for freebies, but wanted to provide honest feedback. In a situation like this, a manager should have been sent to the table.   Over Easy is a generally great place to eat, but skip this location! I'll happily make a longer drive to receive adequate service."}
{"text":"Ok breakfast....  beware they use a lot of oil and butter on what they cool. Was better when they first opened but still decent."}
{"text":"poor service, took 10 minutes to get water. Never got refilled. Food was slightly more interesting than IHOP or Denny's but about the same quality. Great place to go after a night of drinking I suppose. We won't be back, just wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"I unknowingly picked the day after the Diners and Dives episode aired to check this place out...was a little bit of a wait, but not too bad. Fortunately it wasn't 110 outside. I'm not taking points off for the wait, but I am taking points off for average to bad food...Like Bob B, I had the chicken fried steak and yes it was very stringy and I too had to spit out a piece of it into my napkin. I chewed and chewed and chewed but I couldn't get it down which was disappointing because I wanted to like this place, I really wanted to like it, but the truth is, the CFS and eggs at IHOP are more  flavorful than what I was served that day. And cartilage, isn't that a major no no...?  Wife had the chicken and waffles, she said it was just average. Iced coffee with cardimum was interesting, was it bad...no, would I order it again, probably not. Guy Fieri....you have let me down again, first it was Chino Bandido (2 hour wait), sorry Over Easy, I'll give you another chance one day, but Wildflower Bread Company will remain my current Sunday brunch spot."}
{"text":"Not as good as the original.  \"Real maple syrup\" on the pancakes,  my dad didn't notice the fake syrup until it was too late. Server was rude,  made it clear that fake syrup \"isn't her fault.\"  I ordered the famous caramelized banana pecan French toast. Bummed that it came out warm-ish. To the owners of the original... get down here and straighten this place out!"}
{"text":"Over easy? More like over rated.  I had such high hopes for this place.  Meh.  After almost an hour drive across town to try this DDD breakfast joint we arrived excited.  Following a 15 min wait (not bad) we sat at our table and surveyed the menu.  I decided on the banana pecan pancakes and a side of corned beef hash.  The pancakes were wonderful. This is why I gave 2 stars.  I got the half order which consisted of 2 medium pancakes covered in a sweet caramel like sauce, 2 pieces of banana, and a sprinkle of pecans. I added some of the maple syrup that was on the table for an even sweeter treat.  My hash on the other hand was no different than a cheap diner, out of the can, mushy hash.  It was a disappointment. Major.  The service was friendly and reasonably attentive. My coffee stayed nearly full the entire visit which I appreciate.  I ordered the blueberry muffin with lemon curd to go. In my container were 3 small mini muffins with minimal berries, the opposite of moist, and a side of lemon curd that was actually wonderfully delicious.  The atmosphere was mediocre in a small square room filled with tables and chairs reminiscent of my childhood in the later 70s/early 80s. It put a smile on my face as I recognized the boomerang pattern and plastic chairs. I noticed how cramped this place was as I weaved my way to the restroom to wash my hands. Overall it was just ok for me.  I don't think I will be taking the drive back again."}
{"text":"When the first location opened on Indian School the food was good.  Now that they have expanded to multiple locations and the owner is no longer the chef the food is not very good.  The biscuits and gravy were barely edible.  There must have dumped a cup of salt in there holy crap!  They have a lot of sugary menu items that aren't really my thing for breakfast.  I've heard the chocolate chip pancakes are good."}
{"text":"Simply amazing! I wanted to try this place after seeing it on Triple D. We went on a Sunday after church. The place was packed, but we did not have to wait too long to get a table. Once we got our meals, every bite was absolutely delicious. We had the Brioche French Toast and the Mile-High Omelet.  The French Toast was super soft and had a fantastic cinnamon/vanilla taste. Even the jelly on the table was delicious!  The Omelet was amazing too. It was quite possibly the best omelet I have ever had. Also, it came with some hash browns that had a great onion flavor.   I cannot say enough great things about this place!"}
{"text":"I love over easy. My guy and I come to this location every so often and are never disappointed. The building is tucked into a dying shopping center/mall area, but when you give it a chance, you'll be glad you did. It's a cute little establishment with retro decor. When you walk in you get an instant rush of energy, probably because the whole interior is painted bright yellow.   My favorite thing on their menu is the Wolf Pack, which is essentially just a giant pile of hash browns, eggs, cheese, and bacon all layered on top of one another. It's so amazing.  Their orange juice is  on another level.  So good. Freshly squeezed. Yum.  I will continue to come back here regularly."}
{"text":"I thought this place was very good.  One of the few places around here that serves lox, and as a native New Yorker, I appreciated that!  I got the scrambled eggs with lox and onions.  It was salty from the salmon, but still good.  I got it with the sweet potato tater tots, and I really liked them.  Mine were actually a little more oily than I like, but I'm pretty sure that is because they were the first of the batch.  My boyfriend also got the tots and his were less oily.    Admittedly, A tiny piece of bacon ended up on my dish, probably from another one it was next to before getting brought over.  I don't eat bacon, so I picked it off.  Not the end of the world though.  On the weekend, you should plan on arriving before 8:30AM unless if you want to stand in a line.  This is pretty common for any good breakfast places though.  The decor of the restaurant was hip and trendy.  Due to the screaming baby factor, my bf and I chose to sit outside.  It was very nice out there, but the seats are small.  If you have a bigger than average bum size (and considering this is an Arizona breakfast joint, you very well might), the chairs could be tight.  The chairs inside were padded and have not arms, so anyone can fit on those.  We will be sitting inside next time, in spite of the noise.  Food was good, even for someone as picky as myself.  I also liked the coffee.  Our server, Tim, was great!  He gave us great recommendations on the food and was quick to bring us everything we needed in a timely fashion.    Other local breakfast places I enjoy are the Farmhouse, and the Morning glory Cafe at the Farm in Phoenix, to give you an idea of what I like."}
{"text":"My first thought about over easy: \"What Happened?!\" i went there a few times last year and loved it. The last time I was it was awful!!! I ordered the chicken fried steak. The steak was chewy, under seasoned, and dry."}
{"text":"My wife and I purchased a deal via Living Social of $10 worth of food for $5.  She purchased two of them and according to the details printed on the voucher, it said 1 voucher per person.  We stopped for breakfast and our order came to about $26.00.  We attempted to use the vouchers and the waitress informed us that the management would only allow us to use one of the vouchers.  I pointed out the details on the voucher and was told by the management that I could \"take it up with Living Social\".  He then rudely turned away and refused to discuss it further.   My wife and I worked in the food industry for years and this persons attitude was unacceptable.  Had he had the common decency to just say, \"I am sorry but the details are incorrect and we can only accept one of these per visit\", I would have been disappointed but would have moved on.  Instead, he lost me as a future customer and has earned this review for his treatment of a paying customer.    Hard to believe that this place does not need to treat their customers better than this.  I will take my business elsewhere and advise others to do the same."}
{"text":"I've been to visit Over Easy twice for breakfast. Both visits were on weekends and the place was full with about a 20-30 minute wait. I'm okay with waiting for a meal, and living in Arizona I am okay with waiting outside in the heat for a meal (I appreciate the water station). I am also okay with eating on the patio in the summer (as long as there are either fans or misters and some shade). On my most recent visit to Over Easy my friend and I didn't have tons of time to wait for indoor seating. So, when the greeter asked if we were okay with outside seating underth awning we said okay. The little place is quaint, but the enclosed patio simply needs more ventalation. I feel bad for the servers and wonder how much sweat they've dripped into food.   Speaking of the food, I would say it is perfectly acceptable breakfast food. I had an omelet on my first visit and tried the eggs with mushrooms this visit. I LOVE mushrooms. I can't keep myself from eating them raw when I'm supposed to be cooking them, and I wind up tasting them at all phases of the cooking process. This dish had tons of mushrooms - so many I couldn't find my eggs underneath them. It was just sort of an unattracive murky mess of mushrooms. I could probably have gotten over how it looked if the flavors were impressive, but the flavor was rather uninteresting.   My friend had the standard eggs-bacon-toast breakfast and felt very very okay about it.   I've heard the restaurant is moving into a larger space so maybe I will give them another try when they're settled in to the new spot. Perhaps if I'm not so uncomfortable I will be less grumpy and the food will taste better - perhaps."}
{"text":"Very pricing for food that is ok , not great , service is good , would. It  wouldn't choose this place as my first place to eat breakfast or maybe not even my l"}
{"text":"Food was overpriced and mediocre at best.  Service was horrid.  We were greeted by one, order was taken by our main server, and food was served by yet another.  That and our actual server came back one time to ask if we needed anything, deemed our request unimportant and proceeded to never come back, but instead talked to the table behind us the whole time.  Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Guy, I love you on 'Diners, Drive-ins and Dives' and all. But you rave about every place you go to. And you go to a lot of places. That makes you not very credible in my book.  Since I already had breakfast at the hotel, I wanted something small to nibble on while the other girls ate. But then the PB&J french toast on the menu caught my eye. Mental image of thick toast with swirls of peanut butter and syrup-like jam with powdered sugar. I couldn't resist ordering!  The server later informed me that they only have half an order of the french toast and asked whether I wanted a half order of something else. Since I wasn't hungry, I told her that the half order is fine. But at the same time I was wondering how on earth do they only have half an order. Did they run out of bread??  One by one my friends' orders arrived. Big plates of hearty looking food. Then mine arrived, on a dinky plate. Sitting there in loneliness and despair.   PB&J French Toast (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8R_oemw4rNjJL6sd40O_oQ?select=FTpZP-NSq5VuEXC_S73C6w): Are you friggin kidding me?! This is like a Smuckers Uncrustable! Not french toast! (http://uncrustableforschools.com/showimage.asp?fileid=2178) Angry! Was not tasty and didn't finish it. I made sure that I did not have to pay full price for this. Luckily, they took the whole item off the bill.  Smoked Salmon & Mushroom Omelet (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8R_oemw4rNjJL6sd40O_oQ?select=7IF34zeAOIegxtukbZle-A): Huge! The tatertots were good. But unfortunately, the omelet itself was dry. The smoked salmon was overly salty.  The Over Easy (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8R_oemw4rNjJL6sd40O_oQ?select=mngAq_ySH-uFP-GVVQdS_g): Their version of eggs florentine. Didn't try it, but looked good.  Brioche French Toast (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8R_oemw4rNjJL6sd40O_oQ?select=gXPle1ZaQQgd8xSRZaFsew): If my french toast looked anything like that I would've been less pissed.  Cool place. Nice staff. Mediocre food."}
{"text":"Options. The menu has a plethora, an exciting assortment ranging from chicken and waffles to Benedict's to chilaquiles.  Kids get their own menu of $6 with six generous options of brioche French toast to malted waffles with chocolate syrup.  Drinks. Adults get an awesome breakfast drink menu of 'morning mules', $5 bloody Marys, $5 mimosas and even hot and iced Irish coffees at $8.  Speaking of the mimosa, I was pleasantly surprised when mine came out in a 16 ounce glass with a straw, not a champagne flute. I easily had a 3 in 1 for the price of $5. Needless to say, it helped me eat almost an entire order of the amazing chicken and waffles.  Chicken and waffles.  Although this menu has everything, I had to try something I had never tried before. At the recommendation of our awesome server 'Ted', I got the chicken and waffles, and it was amazing!!!!  Breading was light and added a slight crunch to the incredibly juicy chicken breast that topped the waffle. Per Ted's suggestion, I smothered that in sriracha and topped it with their saccharine maple syrup. It was pure southern heaven. Sweet, savory, hot, juicy and crunchy. Just what you want your breakfast to be.  I would come back here just for the chicken and waffle. And the generous portions of the breakfast drinks. I definitely felt Very relaxed when I stumbled out of here.  And finally, the wild yellow and baby blue color scheme of this restaurant is actually very soothing, though I think it's supposed to give you a sensory energy boost."}
{"text":"Hands down the best breakfast/brunch place I've had in awhile. Ham steak was delicious. The staff are very friendly and welcoming especially John if he's your server you'll definitely be well taken care of. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"The menu looked fantastic but we were so disappointed in the food. Chicken and waffles were terrible! It was a small piece of boneless chicken that was flattened to a pulp and breaded. It had no flavor and the waffle was skinny and chewy, I'm not sure it was fully cooked. The Waffle dogs were good.. but not good enough that we will return."}
{"text":"Empty tables. Told 15 minute wait. Ok. 5 minutes into wait (by the door, bumping elbows with counter patrons), 2 people at the counter complained they had been there 20 minutes. We left at that point"}
{"text":"Not good. Been waiting to try this place and so very disappointed. Cold under cooked bacon, just plain nasty spinach omlette, sad floppy un-browned home fries, did they open a green bag of \"Simply Potatoes\" and nuke them? And apparently we made a tragic mistake opting to eat inside, since it was hot on the patio. Employees yelling back and forth (not work, but goofing off-hey guys, it's small room with no acoustic merits-no need to yell), and one employee talking to her customer/friend at the counter so loudly about her drinking nites, that we could not hear each other, and heard way more about her personal habits than we cared to. Management must leave after the breakfast rush, or they don't care. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Over priced. Orange juice was $5 The breakfast burrito I got was good Waiter was awkward and a little rude"}
{"text":"We're new to the area and was really looking forward to trying this place after seeing it on Triple D (gotta love Guy's job). We got there about 11:30 on a Sat. morning. There was a crowd gathered under an umbrella waiting for a table. We felt lucky as the gal at the counter told us that she found us seating inside. Turns out inside there were a grand total of two tables and counter space. Our party of four ended up at the counter facing the open kitchen of a converted Taco Bell setting.   Overall, the food is pretty average. Had the french toast and my husband had the brioche with bananas. Hash browns were pretty good. Kinda hard to enjoy the food with the heat coming from the kitchen and not being able to enjoy my company.   Yeah next time I'd even rather go to IHOP. At least there I can sit indoors at a real table."}
{"text":"Food was good and allot. I sat at the bar, weird choices on the menu. Your looking at a  $ 8.00  breakfast not including a drink.  Would I go again.      Yes  Sat & Sun would go early. Small dining.  Fill up quick"}
{"text":"Not 2 stars for the food, never got to eat. The low rating is for the disorganization at the front. No host and 5-10 min wait before someone even said hello. About 10-12 people not so happy people waiting in front. maybe it was a bad day or several called in sick but it looked like a train wreck of disorganization."}
{"text":"This is by far the BEST breakfast place in Arizona. The food is not only original but it is high quality and fabulous. My husband and I try to do a  weekly breakfast date and after trying several places, Over Easy is hands down the best and the only place we go any more. Daniela is our server and I can't say enough about how wonderful she is. She always remembers what we like to drink and brings our drinks to us as soon as we sit down. She checks on us often enough to make sure everything is ok without being intrusive. She is always smiling and on point with her service. Over easy makes their own jams and they are out of this world. Our favorite dish is the Wolfpack. It consists of hashbrowns on the bottom with eggs, cheese and your choice of meat inside followed by another serving of hashbrowns on top. You will not find a more unique menu, great customer service and friendly atmosphere than what you will get here at Over Easy. I highly recommend you try it. You will become a regular for sure."}
{"text":"My favorite meal of the day is breakfast, so I am VERY picky when it comes to satisfying my palate at breakfast cafes/ restaurants. Over easy did not disappoint!  Everything is very delicious and the hosts are so kind and hospitable. If you come here, you must get the waffle dogs! Even though the waffle dogs seem like nothing, they are quite splendid!  you cannot be disappointed with any dish here.  Although the wait to get in is about 15- 20 mins, the wait is worth it.  The only reason this review is missing a star is cleanliness. Maybe its because I'm really picky when it comes to food and restaurant cleanliness, but the overall atmosphere has to be perfect to get 5 stars."}
{"text":"after disappointingly discovering that matt's big breakfast is closed on mondays (l-a-m-e), my girlfriend and i headed off to over easy to grab a hearty breakfast.  we got there at 10:40 on a monday morning, and waited 15 minutes for a table. a group of business men, whom the hostess told us were the boss's \"friends\" barged in 10 minutes after us (before we were seated) and got seated before us. the whole time we were dining, we saw no interaction between the businessmen and any sort of \"boss\" in the establishment. and the whole time they were loud and obnoxious. i'd rather have sat next to a crying baby.  onto the food! they were out of what my girlfriend wanted, the mexican egg dish, which the waitress should have notified us about before we spent 10 minutes deliberating on what we were going to order. so we went with the wolfpack dish and the eggs, bacon, hashbrowns, and sourdough bread dish, as well as a side of corned hash, and 2 iced coffees.  the way they serve their iced coffee is unlike any i've ever had, and i wasn't THRILLED by it, but it wasn't the worst. a bit of mint and hint of caramel and really creamy. our entrees arrived on the smallest plates they had in the entire place, which made it a bitch to eat and i got food all over the table like a sloppy 3 year old. annoying. the corned beef hash was phenomenal, the best part of the whole meal. i can never find a place that cooks my scrambled eggs how i like them, and although these were a *little* on the overcooked side, at least they weren't undercooked and spongy like many places serve them. the bread was good, the hashbrowns good, and my girlfriend's wolf pack dish was ok as well. the bacon...yeah, it's smoked, and it tasted like it had been smoked with a coop of hens. very gamey, not my style whatsoever. and it wasn't extra crispy like i ordered it.  the place is very small and it gets quite loud in there. i would NOT recommend this place if you're hungover. i don't think i'll be back due to the crammed-ness of the place, the strange menu (which i could only find like 3 things i actually wanted to eat here, they have some weird options), and the a-ok service."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here twice so far and both times it was great. The jam is really good. The waiters are all so nice too. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I've had chicken fried steaks all over the country. This place has got it right. Light flavorful breading, a light topping of sausage gravy and most of all, not overcooked. Put a couple of over medium eggs on top along with some home fries on the side, and this is works to start your day."}
{"text":"Good french toast but lacking in eggs"}
{"text":"My daughter and granddaughter drove into Phoenix from Maricopa; my pregnant daughter was in the mood for breakfast, and had been wanting to try Over Easy.  It was pretty busy and looked cute, so we thought we were going to really enjoy it - we didn't.   We ordered a fruit plate from the children's menu for my granddaughter (who is almost two).  It consisted of a couple pices of banana, a few grapes - okay so far - but the other items, Granny Smith apple slices and grapefruit, seemed like odd choices of fruit for a child's palate - Violet agreed.      My daughter's blueberry pancakes tasted sort of like they were made from a corn batter.  She said she wasn't expecting \"johnny-cakes\".   And the  blueberries were all in the middle of the pancakes, like they had been spooned onto the pancakes after they were already on the griddle instead of mixed into the batter.    My feta, spinach, tomato and garlic omelet was okay.  It would have been better if there had been more then a teaspoon of spinach and a teaspoon of feta, however.    I am a server myself, and my opinion of the service is that it was minimal at best.    Was it awful?  No.  Would we return? No"}
{"text":"This is the real deal! All of he bad reviews are people that do not know a good breakfast place. Andy was a great waiter, he knew his stuff and kept the drinks full all while throwing in some subtle humor.  The benedicts are awesome. Next time I am in Arcadia I am coming here again!  It was on DDD but they have not let the quality slip due to popularity. Great job guys!"}
{"text":"Slow service and sub-par food, not worth the money we paid. Will not be dining here again."}
{"text":"Add another \"meh\" to the list. We went on a Sunday morning, and despite the crowds loitering about, were able to sit immediately at the counter. The crowd was extremely see-and-be-seen, but then I guess it is next door to the (ugh) Vig in (ugh) Arcadia. The service was slow, the server pissy, the order wrong (without an apology), the coffee cup unrefilled. The food was okay, and while there were many tempting things on the menu, I can't say I'm dying to go back. I'll stick to the tried-and-true favorites (read: Harlow's)."}
{"text":"We have come to over easy many times and have always had excellent service and food.  We live pretty close and will continue to come here!"}
{"text":"Great variety of breakfast items that would appeal to a group of different people. The food was fresh and decent tasting, bloody Mary's even better! Probably one of the best bloody Mary's I have ever had. It's a great breakfast spot just for the fact that you can have an amazing Bloody Mary with a fresh breakfast. And a plus that the server was very nice and answered all questions, even corrected little mistakes immediately."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place has such a low score on Yelp. The food is always great, the service is always fast and friendly. This is one of my favorite breakfast spots in Gilbert."}
{"text":"Yummy banana nut French toast!! Wow! So glad I found this place. The coffee is pretty good, my son raved about the steak and eggs and the chicken and waffles looked amazing. They have a great selection of food too."}
{"text":"The second we walked in Chris noticed that stamped on the wall was a cartoon dude with spiky hair and shades. Any fellow Triple D fans? Oh yes, Guy had visited this joint. It was meant to be.  With a menu that made me salivate with every description, I was torn. Our server insisted that their benedicts were out of this world. This guy was right. Chris went with the Country Benedict- cheddar jalapeno infused biscuits with juicy sausage patties, flawlessly poached eggs, and a house made Hollandaise that swooned. I don't know what had gotten into me on this day, but I went with Over Easy's Traditional Benedict. I practically licked my plate clean. Perfection.   For the rest of the review, visit: http://dashofles.com/blog/west-coast-road-trip/"}
{"text":"Wow, only 3 stars? I have to drop a big fiver on this place. This place rocked my socks right off. For realzies peeps.  Initially, this place looks like a run down Taco Bell (surprise, surprise), but once inside it totally works. Unfortunately, it does maintain the same constraints of an old Run-to-the-Border place. This does make for long waits, but I tell you chillins that it is totes worth it. This is one of those places where the food is worth the wait.   For the sake of nostalgia and the added weight of a yelp review, I ordered the chicken and waffles. I was not disappointed. The chicken was juicy and well cooked throughout, with a savory seasoned breading corralling all the flavor. The waffles were light and fluffy. You could tell it was all home made. The only knock was the homemade gravy wasn't my can of beans, but I can't be a hater if you liked it. All of this was topped off with fresh squeezed OJ.   So peeps, I confirm the tastiness that is Over Easy. Enjoy. There is a reason to wake up early on Saturday....but not too early."}
{"text":"After watching Tool Fiery's review on triple d a couple of time, we finally tried it. Looked better on t.v. We left over easy with an un-easy feeling in our stomach and wallet. $3.00 for a shot of o.j. Come on man."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast today after seeing on the food network last night. The wait wasn't bad for a Sunday morning - about 10 minutes. I have to say that it was elbow to elbow seating as some have suggested. It was comfortable. We ordered three different things. 1. an omelete - which was no better or no worse than anywhere else - although the has browns were way overdone/overcooked. 1. breakfast burrito - this was actually pretty good. 3. their touted brioche carmelized french toast...This came out cold and if you're expecting anything like they present on TV, you'll be very disappointed. The carmel sauce was just a drizzle at the bottom of the dish, the bananas were just 4 of the smallest little banana circles i've ever seen and the pecans where just a spinkle of nut crumbs you'd find at the bottom of the jar of nuts. It didn't have a bad taste, just underwhelming if you expected what was advertised on TV...All in all, not a bad place for breakfast,but nothing to go out of the way for.."}
{"text":"The food here is usually worth the wait.  Not today.  My mother in law put our name in, requesting a table for 6 at 9:45.  The hostess wrote down 9:51...six minutes matter.  We were quoted a 30-40 minute wait, which was fine because they were busy.  After watching the hostesses (by the way, there were three of them who couldn't manage this situation together) seat ten people who arrived after us, I began to pay attention to what they were doing, or in this case--not doing.  They were not planning a way to seat our party of six.  They were waiting for their ONE table of six to finish and leave.  A couple walked in and were seated at a table for two within five minutes.  At this point, we were on minute 35 of waiting. Five minutes later, a part of four left from the table right next to that couple, which would have been six if they had planned appropriately.  When I got up to speak to the hostesses, they sat another party of four, who had come in after us, at that open table.  So, I asked to speak to the manager.  The manager quoted me the time that the hostess had written down, and my mother in law corrected him that that time was not when she checked in.  As he looked, he could see there was no empty table waiting to be paired up for our party of six.  He looked to the table of six to see that they were no where near being done.  We had been waiting 45 minutes at this point.    I explained how frustrating is was to watch what could have been a table for six be seated with two parties who had waited less than us.  I shared my story because I wanted him to know why we were leaving.  His response was, \"Are you sure you I can't talk you into waiting?\"  Longer?  Us? No, sir.  Not today.  I thanked him for hearing my concern, suggested he add some training for his host staff, and left.    The good news?  No wait for a table at Zin Burger where I had a breakfast burger and found a new favorite spot!"}
{"text":"I had the Country Benedict with home fries and was so impressed! The sausauge, eggs and hollandaise was over cheddar jalapeno biscuits that were amazing. I also had a side of their pumpkin bread and caramel sauce which were both delicious and the sauce wasn't too sweet. I would give the food a 5 star rating. I reduced my overall rating to a 4 because I didn't like the look and size of the restaurant since this was my 3rd attempt to try it because it's always a half hour wait to get in. However, it was worth the wait."}
{"text":"This place is still pretty solid. Came for the second time. OJ is still awesome. I had the Chilaquiles (breakfast nachos) and while I was excited for the idea of it - my chips were super soggy all around so it was kind of a let down. Ranchero sauce had some spice to it so if you can't do spicy than I would steer clear."}
{"text":"Good local place (glad they moved away from the \"meat-market\"  Vig.  Usually always get the tots but I am an addict.  Food is comfort with some health thrown in and service is dependent upon who you wind up with but it is never bad."}
{"text":"Beware......groupons and living social deals are only good mon- thurs.....read the fine print.  Decent food and service but holy cow.....breakfast was 30 bucks for me and my girl with 4 dollar tip.. 3.50 for a small glass of apple juice, 2.50 for a cup of coffee. 7-9 bucks for everything else. Interior decor needs a designer.......at once!!"}
{"text":"I was underwelmed by the food here. The waffle dogs were just ok, but the sweet potato tots were great."}
{"text":"The good was prompt seating and the chicken fried steak was really good.  Eggs where room temperature, waiter never checked in for us to tell him, and overall service was poor. Tall lanky guy with the shaved head didn't seem to care. I had to get up to find him for the check. After all the good reviews I was expecting average service. We were thinking of going back again, but no chance now. One of the few times I didn't leave a tip."}
{"text":"\"Over\" rated. Heard good things when it first opened but the service and the food are subpar. I will not be coming back to over easy."}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday morning. Service was okay, had to ask for a refill on coffee after the waitress brought our bill. I had the banana nut French toast. The pecans were not whole but rather little bits and only 4 slices of banana. The caramel sauce had a weird burnt flavor. My husband had the wild mushrooms and eggs which he said was fantastic, the home style potatoes he got were cold. Our son had the Cubano which he said was good. Overall it wasn't a bad experience, but I wouldn't recommend it to friends."}
{"text":"This is a great breakfast place...   A simple easy to follow menu with nothing but fresh made ingredients.  I had the hash and eggs and we shared a half order of the French Toast.  All was really well prepared the caramel sauce is well worth the extra buck for the French Toast.  Staff was great and knew the menu well.  Portion sizes are huge (my wife got the wolfpack and I think it had 1 1/2 pounds of hash browns.  Nice breakfast, nice service, nice environment = a great breakfast"}
{"text":"This is a cute little breakfast/lunch spot if you are looking for something low key and where you don't have to wait for extended periods of time just to get served a cup of joe.  I tried the strawberries and cream waffle, and it was great! The strawberries were fresh, the cream was not. Slight disappointment there, but I got over it pretty quickly when I tasted my over easy ice. It was an iced coffee with sweetened condensed milk. And let me tell you, sweetened condensed milk makes everything taste amazing!! They add a hint of mint, cinnamon and cardamom to it, which sounds a little crazy, but it's really quite refreshing.  The prices are really comparable and the service was really friendly. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"First off.. Guy Fieri is a f*cking liar.  Nothing was good about the place. Was going to give this place a whopping 2 stars until the owner went around and ask damn nearly every person in the restaurant how they were and how their food was.. but didnt come to our table.  Racist. My eggs were under cooked and i couldnt chew through my chicken fried steak.  No go.  Matt ' s big breakfast is the way to go."}
{"text":"Food was okay. The corn beef hash was much better at the southern/power location. This one was a little small, dry and didn't have enough onions. The English muffin side with peach jam though... That was good!"}
{"text":"We came to AZ with the hope that we could come here after seeing it on tv on triple D. The food was good, my 1 year old loved the chocolate waffle, my hubby loved his French toast with caramelized  bananas and pecans.  Our waitress was pretty good but she seemed to keep forgetting the table next to us. They sat down no long after us but only got their foods we were finishing up. That bothered me lot, so no 5 stars here."}
{"text":"I'd like to give this place zero stars.  A few months back I visited this place on a Saturday. I sat alone at the counter and was overly disappointed by the lack of customer service.  I had to ask for utensils, I had to ask for water, I had to ask for my order of toast. A customer shouldn't have to ask for these things.  I ordered the chicken fried steak and was very disappointed. The plate was too small and my potatoes were falling off the plate. The eggs were drenched in the gravy making them mushy.   I was also shocked at what happened next to me as I was eating.... 2 younger women sat at the counter next to me. They both ordered some orange alcoholic drink. The waitress gave them their drinks and after 1 women already started sipping on it, the waitress asked to see their ID.  I revisited this location this past weekend for a quick coffee. I waited 18mins for a cup of coffee when the restaurant wasn't even crowded. Poor customer service once again."}
{"text":"The experience:  Been there twice and I just moved here from San Diego last week. Went on Sunday around 10:30 it was busy we waited five minutes for a table. Went back on Tuesday and it wasn't as busy but the food was just as good. Food is good, prices are  reasonable. This location is youthful and fun with lots of bright light and a college crowd.  The food:  I ordered the blueberry pancakes and a waffle dog. ( a breakfast sausage dipped in waffle batter and deep fried ) to delicious perfection. The French toast was great, as was the coffee."}
{"text":"Quality food. Great prices. EXCELLENT service.  Four friends are breakfast here four days in a row on a recent trip to Phoenix. Loved the food but we were really wow'd by the service. Really unusual in these days to get such good service, a smile and a \"thanks for coming\"  I believe our server was named Layla. Maybe all their employees are as good as she is. If not they should clone her. She's terrific."}
{"text":"Paid a visit to this establishment just because it was featured in DD&D.  Was not disappointed.  I had the lox, onion scrambled egg and hubs had the corned beef hash and egg.  In my opinion, it was the best breakfast we had so far, for the money.  My scramble contained a LOT of salmon -- seemed like 1/3 of the scramble was salmon.  Hubs' corned beef hash was practically all corned beef with some potato to keep it together.  Overall, very pleased with our selections and it is definitely a place to go back to."}
{"text":"SAD to report that this location is going under renovation starting 4/16/18, and when they reopen it will no longer be an Over Easy :(   I've been coming here for almost 10 years, it's my favorite breakfast spot. I've tried the other locations before but for some reason none of the other ones make the wolf pack the same way, this is the only place that makes the good version. So that sucks."}
{"text":"Good eggs Benedict but their hollandaise   sauce was lacking today tastes like they left something out"}
{"text":"I'm afraid I've tried this place three times and almost everything has just been mediocre.   The pumpkin bread french toast is incredible, but you only get two slices.. for the cost, I'd rather make some at home.   This trip, I had pancakes which came out luke warm and were so gummy and thick that I left more on the plate than I'd wished! Also, my syrup was cold / room temp. (Which didn't help the temperature of my pancakes.)   I didn't bother to ask for a refill on my coffee either. I don't think one should ever have to ask their server for a refill.   With five customers and three servers behind the bar, I also expected a 'Goodbye' when leaving.. no such luck.   With the amount of options around here for breakfast, I'll hold off coming back here until the reviews and service improve.."}
{"text":"Breakfast was good. French toast average. Iced coffee and rosemary lemonade were delicious. Service...bad. Snotty, young, no smile, no personality waitress. Wouldn't recommend!!!!"}
{"text":"It seems more quantity than quality at this place. The food was average for my taste, but my husband like it here so I respect his choice.  I had vegetable omelette your choice and hash brown in the side, it was blend."}
{"text":"I would go here again in a heart beat.  The food is great, the staff is attentive and very helpful for newbies."}
{"text":"Prob best breakfast place in Phoenix. The food was great. Service was quick and awesome. Only pet peeve is not hot enough hot chocolate. It was cooler than warm."}
{"text":"Got the Florentine eggs Benedict with tater tots and a side of the 1/2 portion brioche French toast.  The tater tots had a different flavour, from whatever oil they were fried in. It wasn't bad, but it was a bit weird since it was unexpected. The Hollandaise sauce was a bit boring and the English muffin wasn't toasted so got a little soggier than I prefer. The eggs and spinach were cooked perfect, however.  The French toast was delicious - some of the best tasting I've had in restaurant - but for $4 you get a single slice. For the price of a whole loaf and a half of bread, I expected a bigger portion. It's a nice breakfast place tucked into a normal shopping centre with a lot of options but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here again."}
{"text":"Quite an interesting menu, good service and ambiance, but mediocre execution in the kitchen.  If they could get the kitchen to deliver on the promise of the menu, it would be a five-star breakfast joint for me.  I look forward to giving it another try at some point."}
{"text":"The food here is so so good. The waffle dogs are my absolute fave.  The staff is super friendly, and even though theres always a wait, its so worth it.  Sit at the counter if you can."}
{"text":"Where to start? Waitress seems like she is counting the minutes to get out. Nice because she has to be, but not very engaged. I ordered the eggs, lox and onion from the healthy choices section but I found it to be both disappointing and upsetting actually because lox is short for gravlax which is RAW, cured salmon. This is what I was expecting but instead I got an egg white scramble with cooked salmon and onion. I wasn't going to send it back because I'm not that person. I ordered it after all, but should I have asked if the restaurant served traditional lox salmon? Or should the server have had the experience to know that their lox is not traditional and explain it to her guest? It tasted okay but kind of greasy. I had to stop eating it because my stomach started to hurt.   My dad got the chilaquiles, he liked them the last time he came but was quite disappointed this time.   Our server seemed like she was having a blah day, why be that guest that complains, in fact I don't think she even asked if everything tasted ok. Our water was kept full and my mom & brother's beverages were refilled so it wasn't bad service just not engaging service. The breakfast did come out quick and my husband loved the Selena burrito, but I might think twice about coming back here"}
{"text":"We ordered 4 meals...two came accompanied with two different kinds of hair...and not just a hair, but multiple hairs...a mimosa was served to us with lipstick on the glass...the waitress was nice though...guy fieri was wrong"}
{"text":"I don't really get the hype over this place. I went to the Arcadia location once and the sound of people yelling across the table to the people they were eating with was so distracting that was all I could remember. So when this Tempe location opened up I thought I'd give Over Easy another chance. But I dunno, you guys. It just wasn't anything special.  I do like the location, although it's very small - only a handful of tables - it's nice and bright and clean.   I ordered eggs and bacon with sweet potato tots. My boyfriend got pancakes with eggs and bacon. Are we just ordering the wrong thing? Is there something really great that we are missing out on? Our food wasn't bad per se, it just wasn't anything special. My eggs were fine, the bacon was average and the tots were, well, warmed up out of bag...and my boyfriend said his pancakes were a little dry...so...yeah. We both walked out feeling sort of 'meh' about the whole experience.  With all the new breakfast places now available in Tempe I don't think Over Easy is going to make it into our regular rotation. I hate to say it Over Easy, but I'm over you."}
{"text":"The one thing this place has going for it is the food. Which is lucky from them because they have a few strikes against them IMO.  The boyfriend and I went there at around 11am on Sunday. I thought the crowd would have died down by then. Wrong! 25 min or so wait. Oh well. at least there are benches to wait on.   Walking in I was struck by the lack of atmosphere. I had gone to their old location once and while this place is bigger, it lacks the character the other location had so that was a bummer.  We got a table near the wall. This place is packed! The tables are very close together so if you want to have a private conversation you came to the wrong place. Also, they don't have any sound dampeners so it's very loud in there. The woman at the table next to us was practically yelling her conversation.  But the saving grace was the food. It was really good. I had the brioche french toast with bananas and pecans and boyfriend had a breakfast burrito. My french toast was done perfectly and had a nice caramel syrup on it that wasn't too sweet. The burrito was big and had a good flavor as well. The eggs were nice and creamy.  If only they could dampen the noise, this place would be awesome.Going there with a hangover would suck!  But I would totally go back for the food. Maybe I'll just have to bring earplugs."}
{"text":"Over Easy ... Over rated. Coffee was bad. Hash browns were bland and not at all crispy. Kids chocolate chip pancake was a reg pancake with 10 chips sprinkled on top. Nothing special. Waiter was super, though."}
{"text":"I came here during the week around 11am so the place wasn't too busy. My friend and I each ordered the 2 egg breakfast and decided to get an order of French toast to split since we were both starving. Our service was pretty good and our server was very friendly. I thought the food was great. My hashbrowns were cooked perfectly. They were crispy and delicious. The French toast was also good- nothing too exciting but it was good. The only things I didn't like was that it seemed a little cramped in there and they use the menus as placemats which I think is kind of gross. Obviously they wipe them off after each guest but it just seemed a little gross to me for some reason. I would definitely return and try something new."}
{"text":"To tell you the truth, I'm never disappointed here or the one in Phoenix.  Always a special treat to eat here."}
{"text":"The Jalapeño Biscuits w/Sausage Gravy is a new favorite!"}
{"text":"After seeing this place on DDD I really wanted to try it. I walked in and sat at the bar. The staff was super friendly. I was torn between the corn beef and massive fried chicken meal that was on ddd. The waitress recommended the corn beef hash. Here's the thing, it was probably homemade but had all the qualities of corn beef hash out of a can. The meat was a little fatty and it was lacking potatoes. It had the consistency of canned cbh. The flavor was good but not great. Also, my food came out as she put the order in, faster than fast food. The portion size is large so the value was there, I'm suspect though when your food arrives that fast. I don't know that I'd go back."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try Over Easy during the week when we arrived we were the only customers. I odered a coffee which was so strong I used the entire pitcher of cream and ir barely lightened the cup. We let the server know so he emptied out half the coffee and added water it tasted like a cup of bad instant coffee. I ordered the eggs over medium with mushrooms my husband odered 2 eggs over easy. After 30 minutes our food arrived my eggs were over hard and tasted like everything had been cooked in vegatable oil. I ended up leaving most of it my husbands was not much better. This experience could have been redeemed had the service been good but this was not the case the waiter never came back to check on us and his remedy for the coffee was not expected. I will not return even though I live less then a mile away for a great breakfast I can count on I will drive the distance to the Phoenix Market Cafe."}
{"text":"Always an amazing breakfast and coffee! Amy is the best waitress and always has the biggest smile. Definitely a must! Highly recommend the fit chicken or for a splurge the jalapeño biscuits and gravy."}
{"text":"Was visiting Phoenix from California and saw Over Easy on the good network. So we had to try it. It was so good that we went back the next day. We will be returning!!"}
{"text":"Here we are at another DDD visited restaurant...  Melissa, our server, offered a bubbly good morning and   After the customary 10 minute wait. (No wait usually means not great)  Coffee full bodied and rich, diet coke properly carbonated.  Our eggs were delivered so fast I only got three sentences of this review completed before arrival.  Our glasses were always kept full!  Nice breakfast place."}
{"text":"Service at this location also leaves something to be desired!  And, the food, 'oh bf, please don't make me ever go there again!'"}
{"text":"MY EXPERIENCE: We take a seat at a table in the corner.  It wasn't set so a busser brings our water & utensils, she is carrying the end of the utensils we're about to put in our mouth.  There is hair in my water.  Dude takes the water away saying yeah, that's gross (he didn't apologise).  My hash brown layer concoction was awful.  Felt like I was eating plastic, tasted like it too, eggs were rubbery & only two small strips of bacon.  My companions chicken fried steak wasn't bad, though they forgot to bring his side of corn beef hash, proceed to bring him hash browns and then the corn beef hash...  He was done with his food before they brought either of them out!  The gentleman in the back putting butter in the pans wasn't wearing gloves (the other cooks were) and picks up a piece of butter he dropped, yip, with his hands.  Our server sits at the bar near us & inhales his food, quite a sight!  No one asked how our meal was.  He brings us our check, my full plate of food is sitting right there, still doesn't ask us about our meal.  We ask for a to go box, my companion looks inside and it's got an oil puddle and oops, some MORE hair!!!  We pay and run out of there!  I personally am too afraid of going back there in the fear of I might 'catch' something but then again maybe it was a combination of my bad luck and a bad day for them...?"}
{"text":"I come here about 2x weekly. Serving staff is great but I get the same thing every time and they still get it wrong at least 50% of the time. Today in particular the order took extra long without tons of other people eating at the time, so I think I'm about done eating here, unfortunately."}
{"text":"Tried this after seeing on Triple D.  My son and I had the chicken fried steak, nothing to write home about.  The steak was like compressed hamburger and the gravy was blah and watery.  Definitely not homemade sausage gravy.  The coffee was very strong and was cold.  IHOP and Denny's has better chicken fried steak.  Bad choice on our part."}
{"text":"Disappointed. I had hopeful expectations from this place.  Strawberries and cream waffle - with this type of description you'd think you'd see strawberries and cream all over the waffle no? That's what I was hoping for when I ordered it. Instead I got a skirt of some whipped cream in the middle and a few sliced strawberries. They treated the strawberries and cream as if they were garnishes to the waffle I ordered instead of those two things being the highlight along with the waffle. The waffle was really thin, I was hoping to have a nice big Belgian style waffle. All in all, very underwhelming.   Gary's Croatian spinach loaf - it's actually what it sounds like - spinach in a loaf form. it came with a tiny side of a fruit bowl. Meh...  Tammy - egg whites with spinach, Swiss cheese, garlic and onion on an English muffin. This was good, nothing super special or original so it was hard to mess up. The hash browns they came with as a side were pretty decent."}
{"text":"Walked in on a Thursday at 10 AM.  Half-empty, so we sat down, checked the menu, ordered, and received our drinks in 5 minutes.  MAYBE 5 minutes later the food arrived.  Coffee cake was phenomenal--even though it appears it is \"outsourced\" from another bakery.  Chilaquiles were pretty good--VERY spicy.  Chicken Fried Steak was OK--gravy was loaded with bacon rather than the normal sausage I'm used to.  Ham steak very tasty.  Overall a pretty good dining experience.  Very eclectic interior--warm, lots of light, very clean.  Friendly staff and lightning-fast service."}
{"text":"We went here on a Sunday with a groupon. Unfortunately the fine print says only M-F and they would not honor it.  The items we ordered we not good and the coffee was terrible.  They also charge for kid's drinks which is not mentioned on the menu - it was $50 for two adults and two kids to eat here (the kids milks were more expensive than our coffee).  I would not return...there are so many other great breakfast places nearby that are great."}
{"text":"Over Easy is just not very good.   I was excited to add a new breakfast spot to my rotation, sadly this will not be one of them.   Let me start by saying, I gave this place 2 chances. I always go back if I had bad service/food the first time, in case it was a fluke.   1st visit, we wait for 30 or so minutes (there were only 2 of us). We get seated at the counter, where we were promptly ignored. They were jamming busy, We finally flagged down someone after a good 10 minutes of watching people go past us. We order drinks and our food.   I see a 4 top get seated well after us. Well after we ordered our food. Not only do they get their food wayyy before us, BUT THEY FINISHED EATING before our food ever came to us!!! Not cool, at all.   2nd time we go back, we get seated on the covered outside patio. I was worried it would be to hot, but they have fans and it does a good job of keeping it cooled down in the hot summers. This time, same freaken situation. People being served way after we had ordered/been seated.   The hubs and I are always easy people to wait on. We are very easy going and understand how things go in restaurants as we have both worked in them before. I don't know who does the hiring or running of things over there, but WOW.   Wont be going back here again.   p.s. I guess i never spoke about the food. The 1st visit I ordered a waffle. since we sat at the bar, we could watch things being made. After the 3rd attempt of making my waffle, it was placed on a plate and sat under the warmer for a good 20 minutes or so. Which Had I known that was my waffle, I would have just walked back in the kitchen and grabbed it myself. The Husband ordered an omelet which should have been easy to make and have come up at the same time or near when my waffle did. No such luck.    The second time I ordered their signature Over Easy dish...I thought I was going to black out, it was soooo soggy and so just flat out disgusting that I went home hungry :("}
{"text":"The food was amazing, as the other reviews suggested, but the service was what won me and my sister over. Amy was magical! Attentive, cheerful...we loved her. Definitely a place to check out, and ask for Amy if you can"}
{"text":"Great brunch! Traditional favorites with a twist. #bestbloody is really best! It is especially nice not to have a wait for Sunday brunch, but I'm sure that will change once other people discover this eatery."}
{"text":"Like the thrid time being here and they are awesome! Ive always tried some thing different and it's been superb. The serving staff is great and fast and anticipate the customers needs. Nice group."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast. I had the banana pecan and Carmel French toast. A little sweet and bread could have used another minute on the griddle. Hash brown and bacon are to die for. Great staff and decor. It doesn't hurt that the place was on triple D."}
{"text":"OMG this was good. I had 1/2 order of pumpkin french toast and a waffle dog. Which is a pancake on a stick like we used to get at summer camp only really good.   My server Cassie was super nice and friendly even got me a cup of coffee to go. The manager Seemed very nice as well.   I wish it was closer to me because I would come here often."}
{"text":"Tucked into a strip mall, the parking lot near the grocery store still has plenty of parking.  We came on a Monday morning so it wasn't really busy and we sat promptly.    Looking at the menu, I'm looking for unique specials and being a fan of hash browns, I went with the Wolfpack.  The food itself was nothing special.  Each individual element stands on its own - 2 eggs (I chose egg whites), bacon, cheese, and plenty of hash browns, but it was a filling meal.  I had the over easy ice so it was a nice cold coffee drink for the warm weather.  My friend had the crying pig omelette which seemed pretty good.  The decor was nice and staff was pretty nice.  Although our table was right next to another, I didn't feel like either of us were intruding upon each other.  Overall, a decent place and worth visiting again to try some of their other specialties."}
{"text":"What a great place!  It definitely has a dive feel, but it is so cool too!  We waited 30 min on a sunday, but it was well worth the wait.  There were so many things on the menu I wanted to try so I went with basic: eggs, bacon and hash browns.  So good!  The bacon was really crispy, the hashbrowns just right.  I will definitely go back and try other stuff."}
{"text":"Really delicious breakfasts!  And they have mimosas!  The tables are often sticky however.  The service could improve, but the quality of food is amazing and the quantity is huge.  Go with a big appetite!"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to eating at the establishment, based on verbal reviews from friends. Usually I never review a restaurant after the \"first look\", my standard is 3 visits, but I felt since my two guests have both been here and were very positive I would give it a go.   We chose to go on a Friday at noon, hoping for fewer customers and perhaps better service. Our decision was correct as far as fewer customers, only 4 other tables, hopes were high and quickly dashed. Our less than enthusiastic server Mariela acted as if we were bothering her by our mere presence. When my dining companions ordered ice water only, you could see  the annoyance in the server's face, however when I ordered an over priced coffee drink she seemed to perk up.  Thus began our dining experience.  My friends and I ordered Eggs Benedict-Florentine with home fries, The Tammy breakfast sandwich with sweet potato tots and the Ham Steak with red eye gravy, two over hard hard hard eggs and hash browns, I duly emphasized \"hard on the over hard.  The wait for the food was adequate.  The food arrived; the presentation on the Florentine and the Tammy was nicely done and my friend was very happy with the flavor of the hollandaise, many times hollandaise is not lemony enough, however I noticed the sauce did not stick to the eggs and dripped to the bottom of the plate leaving the english muffin bathed in a sea of sauce...ewww, obviously not properly prepared, probably did not cook eggs and reduction long enough before adding butter. The home fries did not look very appetizing and my friend did not touch them.  No comments on the Tammy sandwich, positive or negative, the sweet potato tots were fine.  Now we come to the disaster. If you are familiar with Ham steak and red eye gravy  you know that it is generally a 3/4 inch slice of pan seared ham (preferably seared in a cast iron pan) with a sauce which consists of hot coffee added to the pan juices and emulsified with  cold butter. What I received was an 1/8\" slice of processed deli ham, which had been quickly thrown onto a flat top, barely any caramelization on the ham and no sauce on top. I received the sauce a few minutes later in a plastic portion cup. This was not a properly made red eye gravy, I am going to assume it was a bottled imitation. The hash browns were undercooked and cold in the middle and the worst part of the meal, yes it gets worse, the eggs were still gooey in the middle, not over hard. When I spoke to our utterly unenthusiastic server Mariela, her only response was \"Um.. oh...well, do you want more eggs?\" I replied no because I had lost my taste for them at that point.   So to summarize, the meal was disappointing and when the eggs were sent back the server should have at least offered to take a couple of bucks off the check as a good measure. The service was lack luster and the server was more interested in flirting with the manager than attending to her tables. I left starving and frustrated.  I recommend if you choose to try this restaurant do so with low expectations. I will try two more visits and see if they can redeem themselves. I am a three strikes out kind of person, so until my next review.  Chow Chow"}
{"text":"I actually use to drive pass Ove Easy in their Phoenix location but it was right next to the grocery store and I wasn't sure about it but I did like the sign.  A few nights ago I was bored and looked up DDD on YouTube for places in Arizona since I'm new here.  We went to the Gilbert location looked huge on the outside.  It was a 45 minute wait for 2. Love the yellow and Turquoise colors, comfy seats, lots of waiters, bus boys everywhere.  Did see lots of empty seats.  Our waitress was so cute and friendly but only took our order gave us our bill, someone else gave us our food and someone else took our plates.  It took forever to get our waitress because I wanted a to go box.  I ordered what I saw on DDD the Banana Nut French Toast, in that episode a young man said it was very sweet so that is what I was expecting NOT.  In the that episode it came with whole pecans NOT. I didn't even get enough caramel sauce it only covered half of my order.   The hubby had ham steak it was pretty good but you can't mess up ham it always has flavor.  The English Muffins where huge but soft under cook, he's eggs look pretty.  Our coffee is that unique flavor lots of Arizona Coffee Shops have but I'm not a fan of.  I hate water and they serve HUGE glasses of water with pretty yellow straws.  The coffee mugs where cool matched the décor.  I also order a side of hash browns not crispy enough, kind of mushy. I made the mistake of putting Cholula on them and it was to thick for Cholula and had a after taste it ruined my hash browns.   I cook and so does my hubby and I went here because they said most things are fresh not frozen but if I can make and cook better than where I'm eating without the 45 minutes than I rather cook myself.    I figured the Gilbert location might not be the one try, so I think I will give it one more try but at a different location and try something else on the menu before I fully rule it out."}
{"text":"Went here because of seeing it on food network. I find it highly overrated. If I had a kid who was always playing at ice den, I would probably go here often for convenience.  It's basic, super greasy, not healthy at all breakfast but definitely would not go out of my way to get here. It was fine, Denny's is better. I tried to be healthy and ordered something with spinach and eggs but my dish and toast was actually watery from the spinach I think."}
{"text":"We've been here twice now.  Both times was a Sunday around 11:am.  Both times we were told there would be about a 35-45 minute wait so we decided to wander around and run a quick errand.  When we returned 30 minutes later, our names had been called.  Since we weren't there they had given our table to the next party, but they put us on the top of the list and were seated within 2 minutes.  Lesson learned- the wait isn't nearly as long as they say it will be!  I will say, maybe because we've been there during a busy time, but the girls at the hostess stand didn't seem very happy. Both times I had the chicken fried chichen with waffle.  The waffle was average to good, but the chicken was awesome.  This is why I've yet to try something else- a decent waffle and a great piece of chicken is hard to beat.  Add saracha hot sauce to the chicken- a little is all you need!  YUM!  The servers, unlike the hostess, have been great.  Checked on us regularly, kept us updated on the status of our order, and best of all, they smiled.  My partner has had one of their breakfast sandwiches and a scramble with egg whites and steak.  The scramble looked (and according to him tasted) delicious.  Lots of meat!  Their prices are pretty average for the area.  The decor is nice and bright, it is very open and clean- a great place to start your day.  We've been there twice in a month and hope to keep going!"}
{"text":"Always warm and friendly great unique breakfast choices along with the standard breakfast fair great freshly squeezed orange juice and wonderful locally roasted coffee's. Family friendly wonderful outdoor patio for cooler weather."}
{"text":"great service, unique menu choices, home/scrach cooking!!!! Great Coffee."}
{"text":"Looks, smells and feels like new ownership.  Loving the makeover, both menu and interior.  Not to mention, the fresh squeezed OJ machine makes mimosas that are TO DIE!  Will definitely be making this my new breakfast spot.  A MUST, in my opinion."}
{"text":"Went in on Saturday morning and no one in there should of been a clue.  Ordered the Cornered Beef hash and eggs, took 3 times for the waitress to get it right.  Got the meal after 20 minutes of waiting and such a small of hash and lots of hash browns to make you think your are getting a good amount of food.  Ice tea had to be made at 7:20.  And the bill came and had the wrong order on it for $3 more than it should been, fixed that and the $10 for the food was high for the potatoes and eggs and little bit of hash.  Also the staff was amazed that I did not want to order a cocktail."}
{"text":"Great place. Clean, great food. The menue has a healthier meal plan on there as well."}
{"text":"On the rare occasion I eat out, I order something I wouldn't normally make for myself at home that also represents the restaurant's culinary expertise. At Over Easy, this usually means french toast, eggs benedict, or pancakes all of which are delicious.   Today, I ordered a simple two-egg breakfast; scrambled with an english muffin, two strips of bacon, and side of pico de gallo. Perhaps I was hungry from the bike ride over, though it was my favorite meal there yet.   The lightly toasted english muffin was served with butter and a well-balanced strawberry jam, the pico de gallo was crisp and refreshing, and the eggs the right fluffy texture.   As a single diner, I prefer not to sit at the bar with my back to the entryway. Sitting at a four-top table seems wasteful, especially when families arrive needing more space. Next time I'll let the wait staff know I'm willing to share.  The wait staff is friendly, prompt, and helpful, offering to warm up coffee often and accommodate diners. The owners are cognizant of the music volume, which I appreciate. I preferred the more quaint stand-alone location off 40th St to the strip mall."}
{"text":"The food leaves a little to be desired, but it's not terrible. The assortment of iced coffees look very appetizing, but come to the table very watered down and muddy tasting. While slightly disappointing, it's ok in a pinch."}
{"text":"Danielle is such a great server. Made the perfect recommendations. She was so friendly and helpful. I would come back just for her. Chicken and waffles and waffle dogs are so good. I highly recommend. Mary's en fuego Bloody Mary is just the right amount of spiceness"}
{"text":"I stopped here after seeing on their online menu the \"Over Easy Ice\" - Cold brewed coffee with cinnamon & cardamom, mixed with sweetened condensed milk & mint. I was on a Thai Coffee kick and thought this would be similar (having condensed milk). I decided to order to go, since I was on my way to work and lucky I did because the entire place was packed for breakfast.   Unfortunately, the iced coffee was a huge disappointment. I'm not sure if it was because I ordered it to go or if the waiter was new and didn't know how to make it. I watched him get iced coffee, put half and half in it and then call it complete. There was no condensed milk used at all and I couldn't taste the cardamom or mint.   The sourdough toast I ordered was good, nice thick slices and tasted homemade. I also liked that they gave me some jam. It's close to work, so I'll have to come back and do a sit down meal to get the whole experience."}
{"text":"The wife and I eat breakfast out every weekend, and we're always looking for someplace new in the Chandler/Gilbert area, so we were excited to try Over Easy. We're early risers and arrived before 8 on a Saturday; we were seated immediately at a table on the patio, as requested.  The menu looked good, and I ordered the spinach loaf--the closest thing I could find to a signature dish. Imagine my surprise when the server came back a few minutes later to apologize and say they didn't have any--it would be ready in 25 minutes or so. Now, they open at 6, and the place was nearly empty, so how would you not have the signature dish ready to go an hour later?  Plan B was the Crying Pig. The omelet was good overall. It was seasoned well, tender, and cooked just right. My only complaints are that instead of using grated cheese, they just threw a slice of Swiss in before folding it over. This resulted in the cheese being inconsistently distributed; it was a rubbery glob at the center of the omelet. The onions needed a few more minutes in the skillet, too--they were still a bit crunchy and had no color to them at all. The hash browns were perfectly griddled but bland; a little salt fixed that just fine.  Coffee is always a gamble for me. I love good black coffee, but the first time I go to a restaurant I always ask for cream and sugar in case it doesn't cut it. This morning's brew was cream-and-sugar stuff.  The Boss ordered the eggs with sauteed mushrooms. The mushrooms were porcinis, hardly the wild 'shrooms on the menu, but we both knew \"wild\" would mean dried, so it was no big deal. But call a duck a duck for goodness sake. The mushrooms were really good, with fresh thyme, but there were way too many for the two eggs. Her sweet potato tots were nothing special. Probably poured from a bag into the fryer and artificially sweet. They were fried nicely, but fell flat; we should've known better...  When the server brought our check, she let me know she had comped my omelet because they didn't have the spinach loaf. Nice gesture, but I ordered something I wanted and it was fine. This kind of knee-jerk reaction always seems to me like a restaurant expects a complaint and is just acting defensively. Honestly, it almost cost them a star, because it just felt like a desperate move.  So, in the end, the food was fine, but not good enough to make our regular rotation--and certainly not what I'd consider a destination for breakfast."}
{"text":"Service was terrible, omelet was undercooked- but the server never bothered to ask how the food was, just took my plate away that was for the most part untouched. I let her know my eggs were undercooked- and she responded that she'd take it off my bill, which was not the point- not offering to fix the issue or get me something else. Definitely will not be returning. Disappointed as this place was recommended to me."}
{"text":"There are breakfast places in the valley, then there is Over Easy. It is a cozy atmosphere, and the service is always very good. I really love most everything they have on their menu, however their corn beef and hash is so good! I have taken many with me to enjoy breakfast, and looking forward to future visits!"}
{"text":"Ahhh, breakfast my favorite meal!  Over Easy is way cool, and by all accounts it's Matt's Big Breakfast's latest challenger for best breakfast in town.  And the winner ... Over Easy by a nose.  I've been twice now, and both times I've had the waffle and hash browns.  Unfortunately the maple syrup is nowhere near as good as Matt's or Palette (the best syrup in town) but still pretty good.  But what really makes this place better than Matt's is that they really do CARE about you while you wait (what a concept).  So yes, there are outside seats for people waiting and that's a big deal to me."}
{"text":"I was honestly disgusted by my meal. my over easy eggs were over cooked and tasted like rubber. my toasted bread was soggy and the corn beef hash had absolutely no flavor. the only good part of my breakfast was my glass of orange juice. I couldn't even eat the food I had bought. not worth the trip or price. this place is beyond gross."}
{"text":"Nice place! We made the made a mistake of going to the old location ( thanks to my boyfriends phone. He didn't believe mine.. Thank you Steve Jobs for my IPhone) Once we got to the restaurant it was nice and brright inside which I like in the morning. They have Cow umbrellas hanging from the ceiling. The place has an awesome vibe. I would and did spread the word of this nice find to another party in from LA that this place was here as an FYI. They night be slow on refills as stated but I would rather ask for my refill, which was pleasantly poured with a simple \"yes and a smile\" and have excellent CS! Great menu, had a hard time choosing. Both meals were delicious. My BF had this egg bennie over french toast under Spinach which he loved. I was traditional with eggs and bacon. An older gentleman went to each guest and asked how everything was assuming he was the owner! It was five star for me!! Great staff!!!!"}
{"text":"Whenever we're in Scottsdale, Over Easy is a must-stop. The location is great and the service and food never seem to disappoint either.  They have a fabulous selection of eggs benedict and breakfast sandwiches. I also love their banana pecan french toast!   Since I currently can't partake in drinking one of their delicious bloody marys (baby on board) I discovered last time that they have strawberry lemonade with rosemary, so unique and refreshing! Can't wait for our next visit to Over Easy!"}
{"text":"This is an absolute MUST at least once for breakfast in Phoenix.  My fiance and I went after seeing Over Easy on a rerun of Diners, Drive-ins and Dives yesterday.   We arrived about 12:20 so most of the rush was over although it was still busy and our wait to be seated was less than the 20 minutes predicted.  The service was expeditious and friendly.  The food came out in good time and  I can't say enough about the chicken fried steak and egg.  It was delicious and obviously made to order fresh. The batter had a nice spice on the end, it was crispy but moist and the gravy is a perfect compliment.  We will definitely go back for the chicken fried steak as well as to try some of the other yummy sounding meals on the menu.  I also enjoyed the fact that the owner/manager was walking around the tables on a regular basis and inquiring as to whether each person was satisfied with their meal.  We eat out at many different establishments and rarely see that kind of attention to the patrons.  The only thing I could complain about is the annoying whining of the woman sitting next to me who was obviously one of those people who is never happy.  She complained that there was not enough vegitarian \"non fatty\" selections, that she needed  2% milk for her coffee not half-n-half, that her english muffin wasn't toasted enough and when they brought her another one that was clearly toasted more she didn't even eat it.  Coming to a place like Over Easy and expecting a large selection of vegitarian/diet foods is simply ridiculous as this place serves exactly what the name suggests, traditional breakfast foods that are comforting and homey.  The way Mom used to make it with plenty of meat and potatos and loads of flavor."}
{"text":"In a location that boasts no shortage of breakfast options, Over Easy continues to be one of my top choices. I hesitated to even share my review as I think the reason you can almost always get a table without more than a 20 minute wait is because it's attached to an office building and semi-hidden. But, alas the secret is out.  The menu is filled with typical breakfast items as well as more unique options too. Being as I am gluten free, I love any place that labels their menu and employees knowledgeable staff!   My personal fave is the Cali Omelette, which is egg white, tomato, garlic, spinach and feta topped with avocado. Yum.  The best part is Over Easy is extremely reasonably priced and the portions are pretty hearty. The only issue I have had is sometimes the waitstaff seems over-worked or confused about their assigned tables."}
{"text":"Coffee was the worst ever. Food was way overpriced and did not taste good. We left, could not finish either."}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday and it was packed. The service was pretty slow which I would normally understand since it was a Saturday morning but there was like ten employees there. Lots of them were just standing around chatting, and it looked like there was only two people waiting tables. The a/c was on full blast and it was freezing. The food was ok but not great in my opinion. My husband really enjoyed his chicken fried steak. It was a little pricey for what we got too, it cost us $43 plus tip for three people. Overall, even though the food was decent I doubt this place will ever occur to me when looking for a breakfast place."}
{"text":"Chicken fried steak is huge...they don't mess around.  The waffle dogs were worthy of the best food title...the French toast on brioche bread is amazing...service was excellent.  I'll go back absolutely."}
{"text":"On vacation for a golf tourney and this was near the course.  I got the waffle dogs and they didn't bring me the syrup. I took a bite and was very dry so I asked if I was suppose to get syrup, yup!  The syrup is what makes it so good, their was something in the waffle dog that I didn't care for (sage?) not sure exactly what it was but still very good.  and the strawberry lemon aid you have to get."}
{"text":"Went here today Sunday about 8:50 and it was crowded but not to bad, about 1/2 hour wait. Im warning you now, dont ask how much longer after you put your name in if they told you how long when you checked in.   About 10am is when it really got packed, just about when we got done. I ordered the chicken and waffles and i really liked it. I asked for some butter for my waffle because it didnt come with any and it made the dish perfect for me. The chicken had great flavor and when you take a bite with the waffle and butter and the syrup, heaven. I tried some bites without the butter and it wasnt even close to be the same for me.  My grandma got some omellete and she gave me some because she knew she wouldnt finish it and i would order that also. The omelletes are pretty good size but my wifes dish, my sons and mine where not that much food especially for $9. We are use to getting enough food for 2 when you eat at breakfast places and slighty cheaper. Not complaining because it was good but be ready.  There was 2 guys sitting next to use and trying to eat there 30 minute food challange. big ass egg plate with bacon and hash browns, they both only made thru about halfway.  I would definilty go back and get the same stuff. I also got a lemonade with mint and it was just right. My son really didnt like his reese's pancakes. Id like to go back and try some of this stuff ham steak w/ gravy, chicken fried steak w/ hashbrowns, bannana pecan caramel french toast"}
{"text":"The Loco Moko is my absolute fave here...such a comfort food! Caramelized banana French toast is just as yummy and the 1/2 order makes it not as guilty to order and split. And of course the strawberry lemonade to wash it all down....ahhhh!"}
{"text":"This place deserves the 5/5. My wife and I eat here often and have never had a bad experience. Service and food are exceptional. It's a losing battle when trying to decide a better place to go. Get the sea wench with the wolf pack breakfast and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is my FAVORITE French Toast in Arizona!!!  Pumpkin Bread French toast, or Caramelized Banana & Pecan French toast with the syrup   Soooooo Goooood!!!"}
{"text":"I was excited to see Over Easy come to the East Valley especially since I experienced the original restaurant on 40th & Indian School in the old Taco Bell building.  I was hooked and remember recommending Over Easy to LOTS of people.  Even though I lived in Gilbert, I still took a trek to Central Phoenix because I loved the food, the wait staff, the ambiance.  When the restaurant closed and moved down the street on Indian School, I wasn't sure what happened, but the quality of food and the service started to wane and each visit become increasingly disappointing.  I had a former boss from Orange County visit earlier this year and he heard me talk so much about this place.  He stayed in Scottsdale but found his way (with his family) to Over Easy.  They weren't very impressed.   Well, when I saw that Over Easy opened on Warner Rd., I immediately told the family....Over Easy is here!  I hadn't visited in awhile, so I thought maybe they worked out their kinks and have restored the quality that I had come to love back in the day.   I visited the restaurant TWICE this week, and I am officially over OVER EASY.  The hostess (there both days) was atrocious and extremely unprofessional and unfriendly.  I ordered the chiliquilies which I absolutely raved about and it seemed like a completely different dish.  On my second visit, I brought my wife and kids and she saw another customer with the chiliquilies, and asked the owner (or manager) about it.  He said,  \"it's basically Nachos\".  I couldn't believed he was dogging his own food.  It was obvious they were not committed to high quality of anything.  My kids (ages 8 and 12) even noticed the poor service.  The has browns were lukewarm (both days) and the portions were definitely different from my original experience back in Phoenix.   Needless to say, I need to cancel my text I sent to several of my friends that Over Easy was open in Gilbert.  I'll tell them not to bother; especially if the mean hostess is still there!  What a shame....."}
{"text":"If you go, you HAVE to get the lemon ricotta pancakes. They are seriously the best thing I've ever eaten!  Our waitress was super helpful and the food came out quick and was delicious!"}
{"text":"This has become a regular Sunday breakfast spot. I like pretty much everything on the menu I have tried so far, but I've found that I don't universally love every component of a meal. For example, I'm not a big fan of their hollandaise sauce, which seems overpowering (sad because I love eggs benedict), or the sourdough toast (oddly spongey). I love their OJ and other drink options, and I've never left hungry."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! Every time I am in AZ, I always make it a point to stop here for breakfast. Their chicken & waffles is my absolute favorite - hands down! The mixture of maple syrup and Cholula hot sauce is a perfect combination. The chicken is also really good on top of a Belgian waffle topped with the hot sauce + maple syrup is absolutely heavenly. Their OJ is like no other I have ever had in my life. It's freshly squeezed to perfection. I would recommend this place to all my friends & family."}
{"text":"This is just average. I had their signature breakfast and I thought it was blah. My husband had an omelet which you have to build. None are on the menu as pre-built with ingredients. The atmosphere is one of a cafeteria."}
{"text":"So we HAD to try this place after it was on Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives and Best Thing I Ever Ate. Of course we ordered the waffle dogs and the country fried steak. The waffle dogs were yummy... but after a feature on BTIEA... I guess I expected more. They tasted like something I would find at the state fair. Certainly tasty, but nothing that blows me away. The country fried steak, however, is fantastic! My mouth is watering just thinking about it. We had ours cooked with eggs over easy (of course) on top. WOW. Try this and it will be impossible to leave this place anything but satisfied. Tip: Don't eat it before you head out for the day. Give yourself at least a good two-hour buffer because this feast will leave you in a food coma for sure! We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"In the beginning everything was pretty quick. Once we got our food though, I only saw our waitress once and then with the check. But over all, the other staff was pretty good.  Has the patty/papa T's which is the egg scramble with macaroni, bacon, onions and a whole lot of buttery. Good flavor but it gets to be too much after the first 5-10 bites. They serve it with a side of fruit but I think adding spinach or another veggie would make it a whole lot better and not as rich."}
{"text":"We tried Over Easy today, frankly, because they offered 25% off this weekend.  Honestly we wish we had paid more and gone somewhere else.  The first turnoff was their prices because they do not include toast and potatoes with an overpriced omelette.  Then we looked at the price of either an order of toast or potatoes - $3.00- so we expected at least two slices of some special artisan bread (toast) and what we got for $3.00 was one slice of grocery-store quality bread.  They say that what they have is \"homemade strawberry jelly/jam\".  What they actually serve is some watery thawed frozen strawberries.  We regularly eat at the Breakfast Club in Scottsdale; the bill is about the same as b.c. without a discount - and - their food is wonderful, high quality food.  I would have done one star, but the server was very friendly and nice.  We definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"I think there must have been some little kid hockey practice next door at the Ice Den when we decided to have Sunday morning breakfast, because the whole parking lot was PACKED! It was a little bit of a wait for a table, but not bad because then we got to see little kids trek out into their parents' cars in full uniform. Tiny future teeth smashers of America = adorable.   After we were seated, Husband and I both ordered Wolfpacks with eggs over medium with ultra-crispy bacon and hashbrowns (we like a good crunch). I also got their fresh squeezed orange juice, which was refreshing. Wolfpacks came around and mine was cooked perfectly. Crispy bacon, crispy hashbrowns, egg yolks still runny, melted cheddar cheese.... just hand me that Chalula and that's all she wrote! Husband's had great bacon, melted pepperjack cheese, hashbrowns.... wait, what happened to the egg? The yolks weren't just hard, but the bottom was also brown, plasticky and overcooked. The server apologized and said she'd get a new one right out. In no time at all, he had a new one set in front of him. Impressive! We peeked at the plate... I take that back- not so impressive. The bacon wasn't fully cooked, the hashbrowns weren't crispy like before, and he now had swiss cheese instead of pepperjack. But at least his eggs were cooked properly, right? I was about to grab the waitress again, but Husband was just starved at that point and insisted he was fine. Lamesauce. Nothing's worse than having a disappointed breakfast date."}
{"text":"Hey gluten free crowd.... I'm here again to he you make informed decisions.   The 'protein bar' $4.00 - some sort of mixed nut flour bar with a thin layer of chocolate on top. Gluten free and really delicious. The nut bar part wasn't overly sweet- actually had a perfect amount of saltiness to rub up on the chocolate section :) The nuts were ground up finely enough to not have to crunch crunch into chunks of nuts. So if you aren't a fan of nut crunching, you have found your bar.  Yum.  That is all the wisdom today from this Gluten free lady"}
{"text":"A great breakfast place in the valley. They have a variety of options to choose from and the service is great. We always get out food quickly after we order and everything is very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"How can you not like a place that serves tater tots as a side? and gives u a free coffee to go if u ask. I had the smoked salmon benedict and it was good, eggs were poached perfectly. The English muffin could have been toasted more so it wasn't mushy right away, but overall I really liked it. And of course the side of tots rocked! crispy, salty, delicious."}
{"text":"Have visited this place many times and it always delivers food-wise - I really enjoy it here.. We met with some work colleagues who were in town briefly and decided to meet here for a breakfast meeting. While the food is always great here, and the service quick and very friendly, the cleanliness of the floors were definately not up to scratch. There was lots of old food and dropped eating utensils underneath our table that had obviously not been removed or cleaned after each party of guests who had sat at the table prior. This was rather off-putting to us and our colleagues. While I will be back again for their famous \"Wolf Pack\" and other menu choices, I would like to see a little more attention to keeping the place clean and fresh, just like their menu!"}
{"text":"Cute place. The best thing about it was the staff- they were really cool and accommodating, especially given the annoying pseudo-yuppie Scottsdale crowd slumming it (yes there IS a wait, even for you!).  The food was edible, but honestly I can think of a dozen better places for breakfast. Its inexpensive, so it wasn't that upsetting that my chicken fried steak was of the frozen variety,and the gravy had this very strange gratuitous smoky porky flavor. Yes they do have good coffee, and fresh juice. All in all it was.....o.k.   The most perplexing thing though- they serve everything in these tiny side dishes, which is not to say the portions are small, but the dishes are. You can't even see the plate for the food. I just wound up eating my steak off the counter-- thank god it was clean.  45 minute wait? Perhaps not."}
{"text":"Not sure what the hype is.  I've been here several times and its a decent breakfast place.  One item I do like are their waffles.  These waffles have the smaller squares like the ones you make at home. They're pretty solid."}
{"text":"I'm tremendously disappointed with Over Easy. This is the type of breakfast dive (even featured on Diners, Drive-ins & Dives) that I'm usually in love with. I've heard such good things, but thanks to less than stellar food and underwhelming service, Over Easy feels like it's quality is under medium.   With a free Tuesday morning and a $20 for $10 gift certificate from Local Dines (http://www.localdines.com/?ref=19485), my girlfriend and I decided to skip the usual eggs and/or cereal breakfast, and give Over Easy a try.   My girlfriend ordered an omelet with chicken, peppers, mushrooms, and caramelized onions. First problem with the omelet; it wasn't an omelet. Omelets are supposed to be light, fluffy, and folded. This came out as just a big scramble. The next problem; they used raw onions instead of caramelized. She sent it back, and explained that she hates raw onions. When it came back, it was clearly obvious that the cook simply caramelized some onions and threw it in with the original omelet. So the raw onions she doesn't like were still in the alleged omelet. It also comes with potatoes on the side. The potatoes were pretty mushy, when they should have been crispy. She could've sent it back again, but what's the point? After just a couple bites, she gave up on it.  She also had an Over Easy Ice coffee. There was nothing special about this specialty coffee. Tasted like Folgers with cream and cinnamon. No taste from the cardamom and mint that was supposed to be in there.   I had the Selina. It's a breakfast burrito. Not bad, but not anything special. Again, the potatoes (which are inside the burrito) are mushy, so there is no texture to it. And none of the ingredients taste fresh, so it seemed like something I could've microwaved up from Fresh and Easy.   We also had the 1/2 order of Caramelized banana & pecan brioche French toast. I was truly expecting something mind blowing, and it was anything but. While it kind of tasted like a bananas foster, it also tasted like it could've used another minute on the griddle.   They had no problem taking the omelet off the check, but it took forever to get that check. We were also kind of surprised that a manager never came by to see how everything was after we sent food back. I left stuffed, but disappointed; my girlfriend left unhappy and hungry.  The tables being right on top of each other don't really help. We could easily see and hear that the other couple sitting behind us was also having issues with the food and service. It also probably isn't a good thing that the people next to us could hear us talk about how disappointed we were. An open kitchen probably isn't the brightest idea, either. We could see quite a few obvious healthcode violations.   With the Local Dines certificate, our total came to about $5 dollars with tip. That's pretty much the only way I'd recommend going to Over Easy."}
{"text":"I ate here a few months ago and the eggs benedict was fabulous.  Hard to find a place that makes really good hollandaise sauce and this place does.  If it wasn't so far from me I'd be a regular."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! We didn't realize they stopped seating at 11:30 & got there 5 minutes before they were supposed to stop. Oooops! They were very nice about letting us eat & everything though! There was also no wait at all when I went (with a group of 7), but that's probably because of the time we went.  Everything on the menu looked delicious! I got the half order of caramelized banana french toast (what they're known for!) & the wolfpack. Now, let me say that I don't even LIKE caramel OR pecans, but their french toast was AMAZING! I also like how they do half orders, since I wanted to try the french toast, but also wanted the wolfpack too. The wolfpack also looks a little on the small side when it comes out, but it's very misleading since everything is piled on top of each other. It more than filled me up!  Service was THE best! Our server was so sweet and never rushed us out, despite that we had gotten there so late! Another woman (the owner??) also came by to check on the food and even asked my friend to make sure there were potatoes in her breakfast burrito since sometimes the cook forgot about them. I thought that was nice, since most places won't go out of their way to check if something was left out of the meal.   Also, the server (or the other woman, I can't remember), started telling us about their food challenge called, The Pile Up. It's $30 & includes 12 eggs, bacon, cheese, and hashbrowns. It's $30, or if you finish it, FREE! We asked if anyone's beaten it yet, but so far the answer is no.   When we were leaving, we asked our server to take a picture of our group & she led us over to the side of the restaurant where they have a big OverEasy sign. She was great with the photo taking & very funny.  The inside of the restaurant was smaller than we expected, but they do have outdoor, shaded seating. They also had a tv that cycled through programs, one of which, was part of their episode from Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives on the Food Network.   Overall, this place was great & if they had one in California (where I'm from), I would definitely make it a regular place! As it stands, I'll have to go back here the next time I'm in AZ."}
{"text":"I've been to Over Easy three times now, twice pre-DDD (and Yelp membership) and one post.  We had a family member in town and we met up for breakfast one Sunday morning with a medium sized group.  We weren't the first to arrive, and the first people arriving already had staked out a table for us, so no wait for us.    The first thing that I noticed was that the menu seemed a lot heartier than my first two visits (including something on the menu that appeared as if it was trying to be a challenge for Man V. Food).  While it doesn't bother me particularly that they expanded the menu, I didn't really see why they needed to change from the simple menu they had.  And no JPO coffee???  (Ok, so the coffee was probably still the same, but I still liked the whole 'JPO' part).    Anyways, I had the basic brioche french toast with a side of tater tots (big plus for having tots).  It was good, not spectacular.  The tots were ample, so I appreciated that.  Service was good.  It did seem to get a bit warm, but we were in the 'outdoor' section, so that was to be expected.    Probably closer to 3.5 stars, but this was my 3rd time there, and I would go back, so I'm rounding up to 4 stars...I think it was the tots that put them over the top."}
{"text":"Meh.  I was very disappointed with this place.  I was looking forward to a good chicken fried steak and eggs, but the CFS was just awful. It was way too dry and overcooked.  The gravy was lacking seasoning, and the consistency was more of a sauce than a gravy.  Oh and throwing breakfast sausage 'meatballs' into the gravy does not make it real sausage gravy.... The redeeming items from our breakfast were the tater tots (cooked to a delightful crispy perfection) and the iced coffee (great balance of sweetness and the cardamom is a nice twist).  Seriously for the price, you're likely to find a better brekkie at Cracker Barrel."}
{"text":"4 Stars only because the service was super slow. We got their and were one of the only tables that needed their order taken, and once we gave our order it took a good 10 minutes to get our food. For a short order diner, that's a long time. Not only that, my food sat in their expo area under the lights for a few minutes as well. The coffee by Press is amazing as is the Nitro brew by the same company. I was underwhelmed by my omelette (mile high) bc it's ham and onions and peppers... I meant to order a different one but told the server the wrong one. Not a fan of peppers. Parking was confusing bc the visitor parking for them was closed on Sunday. Not being used to the area, we had to park next door at a bank and hope to not be towed. Figured I won't since it's Sunday but still."}
{"text":"The first couple of times I visited this place it was amazing and I was all about it.  The last couple of times it has been mediocre and frankly McDonald's tastes better.  Yesterday decided to give it one last chance and now I'm done.  Walked in and was told by hostess to pick a table, none were clean so when I picked one she said, oh let me clean it for you.  There were only a few people there, not at all busy so why weren't the tables already cleaned.  Sat for 10 mins before a server arrived and he asked if we had drinks yet. I politely replied, no we've been waiting for about 10 mins but no one has helped us yet to take a drink order.  He got an attitude and said, well I'm here now so what can I bring you.  He had one other table he was serving so why did it take you 10 mins to approach us?  We ordered coffee and juice, which $5 for an orange juice is insane.  I asked for a little thing of soy milk to use as coffee creamer but he said, we don't carry soy and walked off.  Really? A place like this \"trying\" to make these new age, great breakfasts and they don't carry soy for us with milk allergies??  I ordered the chilaquiles, which I've had at a couple of different places and loved them so gave them a try here.  It was disgusting.  Literally cut up rotisserie chicken drown in salsa, cheese with two eggs on top all over tortilla chips.  It was so soggy that all the chips were just mush and was inedible.  2 coffees, 1 juice and 2 orders of mushy tortilla chips, $43 dollars.  Most over priced crappy food with shitty service one could imagine.  Won't be back and won't bring/encourage others either.  Below are two pics.  One of my chilaquiles here (mush) and one at the place I had them a month ago how it should be.  Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"this place served the first pancake that my toddler are with such exuberance that she pulled the plate closer to her and dove in face first. as a parent, finding a place where my kid will eat the food is remarkable.  also I got to have beer for breakfast."}
{"text":"Mold. In one word, mold. I ordered a breakfast burrito and a side of fruit - the raspberries had mold on them, which I pointed out to the server, actually showing him the mold. Rather than even apologizing for it, or having the manager come by the table, the server seemed dismissive and unembarrassed. He only offered to make the side of fruit gratis. Aside from hygiene, and preparedness, the wait for our food was horrendous - a party of six, which I called ahead for, after having placed our order, waited about a half hour before our breakfast was served. Eggs, bacon, tortilla, sautéed mushrooms all served at best lukewarm - nothing takes more than 10 min to make very well. Extremely disappointed. If I could give less than a star, I would."}
{"text":"Just wasted an hour of my time We sat outside for 30 minutes for a table.  My choice, no big deal.  We get inside, sit down,  wait, wait, wait, try to get a servers attention, no luck, wait, wait, and wait. After 20 minutes we get up and leave.  We tell the hostess that it would have been nice to have service.  She did respond with an apology, but immediately looked at a patron waiting for a table and said \"looks like you got yourself a table.\"  That totally just negated her apology and shows that they just don't care if they burn through people, they have more customers."}
{"text":"It's a shame this place still operates on the original owners. I've tried this place twice. The food is just not good. Benedicts ordered- english muffin was not toasted -- eggs were overcooked-hollandaise was tasteless. Home fries -- a platter of under-cooked amidst over cooked with no real seasoning. Server was nice but food came out cold and later than normal.  We really wanted to like this place as it's on out bike route. Oh well- back to the drawing board."}
{"text":"Over Easy's Tempe location is okay, but maybe not the best.  Service was just okay.  The food was pretty good (one of us got corned beef hash and the other an omelet) and freshly made and delivered to the table hot.  Coffee was good.  The building sports big windows so the sun was beating in a little too hard (it was a little warm and quite bright).  It's definitely not a bad place for breakfast, but also does not stand out.  Reasonable food for a reasonable price.  I would neither stay away nor would I go far out of my way to rush back...."}
{"text":"9/8 First thing I noticed, as I walked through the vestibule and headed to a counter seat is that it is LOUD indoors, and it wasn't even half-full in there!  I hesitated to move outdoors as it was already past 10a and very hot, but I just couldn't relax at the counter.  Thank goodness I'd already checked out the menu online and pretty much decided what I wanted to try- the chicken-fried steak on a waffle. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8R_oemw4rNjJL6sd40O_oQ?select=MhktxOxPp_sKrzK6tJoR_Q#MhktxOxPp_sKrzK6tJoR_Q  I'd misread that the actual dishes were a $9 plate of fried chicken on a waffle and an $8 plate of chicken-fried steak, country gravy, egg, and choice of potato, but no worries as my server allowed the substitution and charged me $9 for a fried steak on a waffle.  I decided to brave the hellish heat over the hurtful deafening noise indoors and moved outside.  I must've looked pityful wilting out there that a kind young man asked if I'd like him to turn the misters on.  Patio-area is actually quite homely and invting, and I was pleasantly surprised that there were misters installed- for some reason I didn't think many people would welcome cooling condensation on their eggs.... My OE experience was starting to improve... While I enjoyed the flavors and textures of the steak and delicious waffle, I didn't think that the small amount warranted a high price tag. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8R_oemw4rNjJL6sd40O_oQ?select=L4kyavImBPIfIAdVmi1D_g#L4kyavImBPIfIAdVmi1D_g  I had to ask the server if the waffle was indeed that small.  I could see paying that price for two waffles and a steak...  After eating all the crumbs of my dish, I went ahead and ordered a chocolate waffle w/out the powdered sugar from the kids' menu.  I expected to see a chocolate-colored waffle, as I assumed that the homemade sauce was mixed into the batter, but no, it was the same malted waffle w/ homemade sauce drizzled with a heavy hand.  If you're like me who prefers the crunch, you might want to ask for the sauce on the side.  (A nice addition to the menu would be a chocolate waffle topped w/ vanilla bean ice cream and homemade sauce on top!)  Can't for the life of me think why I didn't take a photo of the chocolate waffle, so forgive me for its exclusion in the photo set.  Oh yes, the sauce is OK."}
{"text":"Get here early! I'm so glad we arrived at 9:30am on a Sunday, we were seated at the counter immediately because there were two seats open for us. The place was already at max capacity. The restaurant itself is so neat and cozy chic. I love the art and design goin' on in here!!! It has a New York touch, very homey and personal. Love the chalkboard art!!!  We ordered two items featured on Diners Drive Ins and Dives. Wow! Get the caramelized banana French toast, it's divine! I also got the Wolfpack which is just so intense and heavy. It's basically bacon and cheese sandwiched between hashed potatoes!   Love this place it's definitely a hot spot, a must see and do! Our server was lovely and the whole staff is very hard working and kind. My only discontent would be that the food came out slow, we waited nearly 20 minutes for our food... But it was worth the wait every second of it!! By the time we left the wait looked pretty rough.   Tips: if you're in a big group for sure arrive early (ideally 9:00am definitely by 9:30am), let someone out and put your name down while you look for a parking spot."}
{"text":"Happy to have had some great brekkie at Over Easy.  My friends and I hopped on our bikes and rode to Over Easy.  We had a 20-25 minute wait when we arrived so we grabbed a coffee at the coffee shop, a couple of stores over.  The hostess was accurate with how long the wait would be.  The service was good.  Our server seemed quite serious but she caught our joy after a few minutes at our table.  Service was good and our food was great.  D had his eggs, over easy of course!  He also had the blueberry pancakes, which we all sampled and found to be dense.  I like my pancakes light and fluffy... these were not.  L had an omelette, that she described as \"delicious\".  You're able to create your own omelette, with 3 ingredients of your liking.  I was very tempted to create my own too but instead decided on The Mediterranean.  I loved my omelette, which had lots of flavor!  If you are not a fan of garlic, you will not be a fan of this particular omelette!  The hashbrowns were also very good.  I would absolutely order this meal again. Over Easy has a fun vibe and lots of great choices on their menu.  They also have a nice selection of healthy choices too.  I look forward to my next trip to Over Easy... I might get their fancy iced coffee with cinnamon & cardamom, sweetened condensed milk & mint. YUM!"}
{"text":"And once again, finding myself in the morning world, I am here.  What's with all the low blow reviews?  This place is pretty nice.  All three times I've been here, I've been graced by the same charming server and he's remembered me each time.  I don't know his name, and if I had a little less social anxiety, I'd probably ask.  Or not.  The mystery gives it a certain appeal.  Anyway, breakfast is breakfast no matter what you say about it.  That being said, this is probably one of my favorite places to go to for dishes with vegetables wrapped in egg.  It's one of the few places that has goat cheese as an option at a decent price, so 5 stars for going above the average for something like that.  Same for having a Lox dish (though it could use some capers).  It's a small thing, but it's the small things that count.  I also read/heard they're looking to get an alcohol license, probably to start serving mimosas.  If you're into that sort of thing, well, there you go.  I'm not even mad that he forgot my orange juice the last time I was here.  The place was busier than I've ever seen it, and servers are just as human as I am.  Maybe I'm too mellow to give bad reviews.  I also had a dentist appointment I had to get to shortly after, so... eh!  Whatever!    tl;dr: Go eat here, the food is excellent."}
{"text":"The iced coffee is one of my favorites I've ever had; otherwise most of the rest of the menu items are good but not spectacular. I do love the sweet potato tots but not sure there's anything special about them. The portions are small and the prices seem a little high for what you get.   So far, my favorite thing I've tried has been the traditional eggs benedict (which is saying something, since i'm not typically a fan), but my friend I went with (who has a rather discerning (read: picky) palate and a culinary degree to back it up) said it wasn't that impressive. Today I had the chicken and waffles, and while good, I ended up with some stomach problems later that marred the experience.  The service at the counter was phenomenal the first time I went; the service in the dining room at a table not so much. I had to wait a while for coffee refills (and by the time we went today, the restaurant was not very busy - we went after 1pm) and the server just seemed sort of unprofessional as he walked around, interacting with patrons.  All-in-all, a good neighborhood breakfast spot, but not necessarily the best thing you'll ever have, either."}
{"text":"I thought this place was great, the eggs were cooked perfectly and hash browns were AWESOME since they were so crispy.  I am not the only one that must think so since the place was packed!  I enjoyed the coffee and service was great, it is a nice little cafe in the strip mall and I would go again.  I love a great breakfast."}
{"text":"Loved this place, great service, great food! OJ fresh squeezed, pancakes had great flavor, bacon, eggs everything tasted like they used the freshest of ingredients. The jellies were homemade and fantastic, sweet and light fruit flavor."}
{"text":"This really amounts to 3.5, but I'm being overly generous with my review. 3 stars for the food and 4 stars for the service. I ordered coffee and the spinach, tomato, garlic and feta. However you have to chose which carbohydrate you want (hash browns or toast) You can't have both. The food was alright, but my waitress was good.   It wasn't very busy yesterday, so I got a seat right away."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here (at 1:30pm) after working out today.  The food was very good and super fresh.....I had the egg white and asparagus omelette ..... yum.....with a side of fresh fruit....sweet and juicy. My husband had the smoked Scottish salmon which he enjoyed. The coffee was good and the service was quick and friendly.  It is also nice to be able to sit outside after working up a sweat."}
{"text":"Good solid breakfast spot.  The best part is that this is not a chain, which is rare in Mesa.  Had the Mediterranean omelet, which was very good.  Whole leaves of baby spinach throughout.  I got sweet potato tots (great, but I was so full after the eggs that I didn't eat many) and English muffin on the side, which looked like they made in house (not sure if they do, but it was legit.)  My husband loved his Mile High omelet, and everybody else got pancakes.  The restaurant was packed, which is a good sign for this area.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Some minor remodeling... and the place is great!   The echoing sound problem is gone... and the place feels so open and homey.  Service was stellar and friendly.... the coffee and food was delicious.  We split a burrito and yummy blueberry pancakes.  Fantastic!"}
{"text":"My mom and I shared the waffle dogs they were a little cold but tasted really good especially with the syrup and hot sauce. We also go the loco moco, they spell it differently, it was amazing! Very very close to being as good as the loco moco's I've had in Hawaii. There was a 15-20 min wait so my mom and I sat at the bar which wasn't to bad and service was very good."}
{"text":"I'm hesitant to leave such an amazing review, because the more people know how amazing this place is the longer the wait times will be from people frequenting this place.  I love coming here and having Layla as my waitress.  She's very laid back and never gets our order wrong no matter what the modification is.  The restaurant has a great healthy menu to choose from and the prices are ridiculously low especially for the location.  Out of the four times I've been here I am seated immediately and have a great experience and enjoy the atmosphere.  If you want a great, cheap, and amazing breakfast with no wait (compared to over two hours at an establishment close by) please give this place a try and request Layla for your server!!!"}
{"text":"We came in on a Sunday morning. Food was good & quick. Server was pleasant. Who ever thought of tots for breakfast is low key genius. That said I REALLY can't stand it when restaurants include the tip. Especially when it's not clearly stated. I don't mind tipping & the waitress really was great but it just comes off as dishonest pricing & presumptuous. Left a really bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"Im not sure what all the hype is about.  I had food that im pretty sure I can make better at my house.  Food is okay. Would rather go to Butterfields.  Note there is no patio and I'm pretty sure my server was hungover.  The corned beef hash was from a can not house made."}
{"text":"I really never post any reviews but this place deserves it. I come here often and the food tastes great like always. The brioche banana toast are to die for as well as the pancakes, I've really never tasted anything like it before. The place is cozy and clean and the staff is amazing, not really much more to ask for except I wish they add crepes that would the cherry on top."}
{"text":"I came here because like most of the people here, saw it on Diners Drives & Dives.   The place is a pretty little restaurant and while I didn't get what I wanted, I ended up ordering some french toast and iced tea.   Honestly, the place was OK at best.  For being on a TV show, I guess I expected more.  Maybe I didn't get the right thing? I don't know.  Id try it again but for the price, I might think again and go to 5 & Diner."}
{"text":"This was a terrible experience.  It literally took over 30 minutes from placing our orders to actually receiving our orders.  We have been there before and had a good experience so the delay without anyone updating us was frustrating. When the food finally came,  only four of the five orders came out. My simple order of scrambled eggs and hash browns was still being cooked.  The chicken omelet was made with ham so that got sent back, the chicken with waffles was fair, the steak and eggs were inexplicably made with egg whites and was a pool of some clear sauce.  The omelet came out again this time no ham but also no chicken.  When we asked about the delay we were told that the cooks had all been fired earlier in the week and they were training a new staff.  Never offered to adjust the bill and never heard from a manager. We had to get folks to the airport otherwise we would have raised the issue. We may or may not go back but not for a while, there are too many good breakfast places to suffer through this."}
{"text":"Delish food...love the banana pecan brioche french toast!   Yummy and inexpensive kids menu...my kids had the choc chip pancakes and they were incredible.  Nothing on the kids menu over $3. Not the best ambiance but true foodies go for the food!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good, but not the service. They took forever to bring us the food and then the waitress was rude. Forgot her name. Has short dark hair up to the shoulders and had a tattoo on her arm. If you can't work with people don't work in a place that serves food! Not sure if it was because we are from a different ethnic group or if she is just rude to everyone.   Will not be going back. Even if the food was good, if the service if horribe the place is bad."}
{"text":"Expected more when visiting this place.  I told the girl I was diabetic and asked for a recommendation and she recommended a Mexican breakfast I can't pronounce (Chilaquiles). I ordered it and it was basically breakfast nachos. Not dietetic for a diabetic...not sure why she recommended that. I tried it anyhow and couldn't eat it as the chips were a soggy mess. Sent it back for corned beef hash with \"over easy\" eggs...and it was nothing to write home about at all.  What's worse is the grumpy service. When we walked in we stood at the front for 2 minutes before a server walked up and blurted \"TWO?\" Geez, how about a \"Welcome to Over Easy, will there be two of you joining us this morning?\"  Female manager did visit the table and was nice. When we were leaving, there were 2 employees at the front and neither batted an eye at us as we left. So...crappy greeting and non-existent parting. This was the first/last impression of this place sandwiched between mediocre food. Too many other great breakfast places that are much friendlier to guests with better food."}
{"text":"Have been here several times and always have great service and food. I went last week on a Wednesday, and had a drastically different experience. They did not bring any ketchup/hot sauce as always, and our server did not check on us once. She was too busy working the bar. We had to flag her down for water refills. No \"thanks for coming\" or \"have a nice day\"...nothing.   I had been excited to try the cheddar jalapeño biscuits and gravy for awhile...they were awful. So incredibly bland and the biscuits were so generic. Will come back but what a disappointing visit!!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Server was not accommodating and felt that a dirty coffee cup is acceptable. Not very friendly and not open to subbing 1 item for another. With all the great places in the area, I will not be back!"}
{"text":"I absolutely adore this place. Mesa has so few really good breakfast places, especially East Mesa. The eggs Benedict hollandaise is the best. The Wolfpack with bacon and Goat cheese is pure heaven. It makes me sad this place isn't busier because it's awesome!!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars  Considering we walked in 15 minutes to close, the workers were very nice about letting us in. Simple looking restaurant with good food. The caramelized banana & pecan brioche French toast was really good and the portion was huge! It's pretty sweet so you have to be in the mood for it. I ordered the mediterranean omelet which was good. We also ordered a side of sausages which were decent. Overall a decent breakfast spot with decent service."}
{"text":"Went with the waffle dogs..suggest you maybe split it with someone( eat two fast!) and order a breakfast entree"}
{"text":"Saw it on the food network and when I went to phx I had to try it! The food was really good and the service was awesome. Prices were pretty decent. My only gripe... the french toast was not hot. I can tell it would have tasted a LOT better (not that it was bad by any means) if it were hot vs. warm.   I would and will try it again and hope its hot! If it were hot I would go 5 stars.... sorry guys!"}
{"text":"The owners are wonderful and know their regulars and semi-regulars. They have more than just your average breakfast fare, but they have that too! They use a wonderful brioche, and I love that they offer a half order of french toast. They serve REAL maple syrup and serve decent coffee. My friend really digs the Wolfpack - come hungry!    What to try? the Waffle Dogs - they're big fat yummy sausages dipped in waffle batter served with real maple syrup and Cholulo hot sauce. Sounds weird, but tastes wonderful!    I also love their healthy choices - egg white omelets with your choice of ingredients. My only wish? That they offered a chorizo and egg burrito.   Have kids? They have some GREAT kid-friendly choices with decent prices - chocolate chip pancakes anyone?  Come early - there is always a wait on the weekends!"}
{"text":"We ate here -- it was average. I thought it was over priced. Won't be a place we will frequent! Definitely not worth a long wait."}
{"text":"After reading all the rave reviews and seeing Over Easy on Food Network's DDD, I was eager to check this place out.  I decided that Mother's Day with my grandparents and mother would be a perfect day to do so.  I made sure we got there early enough to avoid the crowd.  There were about 6 empty tables (not busy at all) and we got sat immediately.  Unfortunately, we sat there for about 20 minutes while all the waitstaff completely ignored us. Had to finally ask a busboy to find out who our server is. He said he wasn't sure. The lady who sat us said to the busboy she didn't know who was our server either (not sure if she was the co-owner or manager or whatnot). She had to practically beg for someone to take the table. Its a SMALL place, so I heard the lady loud and clear. I got up and left after that, taking my family with me. Over Easy = Over FAIL!"}
{"text":"Don't know what changed here, but the food has gone from great to mediocre, and the service was really poor.  Usually this place is packed and today only about 1/2 full.  Never got the coffee I ordered and the waitress never checked on us after she dropped off our meals.  Probably tired of hearing how much this place has gone down hill."}
{"text":"DDD place!!! Great service, had chicken fired steak that was good but a little greasy. Also had Carmel French toast super sweet but good if you love sweet."}
{"text":"Very Nice, My wife and I stopped for the first time there for an early breakfast Sunday morning, the service was fantastic and friendly, I had a chicken fried steak and eggs and my wife had the home made hash and eggs and a pancake. The steak was perfect, crisply and tender and the hash was wonderful and you could tell everything was like home made, fresh and full of flavor. the menu is pretty and full of everything you could ask want,  even the coffee was good it was not the usuals Framers brand hi acid stuff. and the home made fresh cherry jam for the taost was very good.   So, great fresh foods, friendly and fast service, very clean and great coffee... so 5 Stars from us."}
{"text":"Wolfpack is definitely something to howl about.  Big, hot, and delicious.  A little disappointed at the lack of hollandaise sauce optioned meals at this location, but there was still a ton to choose from.  Service was quick and efficient which was nice because the place was packed."}
{"text":"Wonderful menu very clean and inviting!! Had to return before leaving AZ  Truly a delightful breakfasts."}
{"text":"The menu has something for everyone. I had the hash Benedict and it was money. Not huge portions for the price though."}
{"text":"Highly recommended by family...Sunday morning breakfast place was backed up...food slow coming from kitchen but wait staff made sure we had plenty of coffee and juice.  Food was hot when it arrived...NO red tabasco sauce...mortal sin...but all was great food wise.  Sit outside if weather permits."}
{"text":"Everything here is delicious! We haven't tried the whole menu yet, but we've never been disappointed. And yes I would love to try everything on the menu lol Their coffee is amazing.. I drink it black with sweet n low ...I'm in love with their coffee!  The service is awesome as well and they now serve a large offering of adult beverages mmm we had all 4 different bloody Mary's this morning! They were nice and spicy.... Best Bloody Mary's I've found in this area (other than the ones I make :)"}
{"text":"This is good quality food period. Really doesnt matter what you order. I especially recommend the waffle dog, as others have mentioned. The light batter puts it over the top."}
{"text":"Service was ok, good scene but horrible food!! If I was paying for the service I would go back, considering I went for food this place should burn to the ground."}
{"text":"First, I was sick all day after eating breakfast here.  The coffee was worse than AZ dirt. My chicken fried steak was a joke, more like fried Oscar Mayer thin cut mystery meat......YUCK!! The hostess girl was more interested in her drink and cell phone than a smile.  So forget about this joint."}
{"text":"I came here after seeing Over Easy on the Food Network in hopes of some delicious breakfast food (the location on TV was actually the Scottsdale location, which might be a little different). Instead I got very bland food and sub-par service. I had the blueberry pancakes, which tasted like blueberries in a very plain bread, with a side of lemon curd, which was more like a butter with a hint of lemon, and hash browns, which were the most bland hash browns I've had at a restaurant, and they seemed like they had been sitting out a while. I was not impressed."}
{"text":"House special Coffee w/ their home blend creamer (cinnamon, cardamom, sweet condensed milk and mint.)   I come here for the Banana Fosters Brioche French toast.   Chicken Fried Steak.   Moko Loco with extra gravy.   Great place to just come and have a cup of coffee and a piece of toast.    Atmosphere and service are impeccable."}
{"text":"The food is good, the new location is not. There are too many tables packed into the space, and the wood bench seats on the wall are not comfy, and parking is still a pain. I understand trying to expand, I think you need more servers and fewer tables though, maybe get a hostess so some semblance of order can accommodate all of the new customers. I do hope it gets better soon."}
{"text":"March 2017 - stopped here for breakfast on our road trip from Houston to Las Vegas. I ordered the banana nut caramel french toast. It was just okay. The bananas were definitely too ripe and ended up being hard to chew. The caramel was very maple-y flavored and wasn't my favorite. I had originally planned on ordering savory but talked myself out of it and I regret that.   For the good, they had fresh squeezed orange juice that was delicious. The others in my party ordered steak & eggs and the Wolfpack. Steak was very flavorful but possibly too much gravy on the plate. My brother ate the Wolfpack so fast there was no chance for a picture.   If I ever found myself in Phoenix again during breakfast time, I'd probably give it another try and order something different."}
{"text":"Went with some neighbors the 2nd day it is open - they are still doing some set up (they were building chairs while we were there). On the plus side, we got to meet the owners (a couple) who are also opening up the Lodge on a cross corner from this place (which is in the Tempe Culinary Dropout/Yard complex, which is set to open July 1st and the wife is a hoot, it was so fun talking with here!  As for the space, wonderfully open with high ceilings and just a nice clean look. The wife told us that all the wait staff and cooks had already worked for several months at the Arcadia location so you can expect a smooth opening. For us, the coffee was great and they refilled it on a regular basis and the food came out quickly, which is always nice (but that may slow down a bit as this place packs up, but maybe not). I had the waffle and fried chicken (which is a flattened breast cutlet), which I thought was good, though I tend to like a thicker waffle (this one is pretty thin, though good). I would also say the price point is pretty good - my dish, with an additional egg and coffee was a bit over $13 with tax (not including tip).   Overall, good food, service is also good and nice location (full disclosure, I can walk to it, which I love), I'll definitely be back again."}
{"text":"For some reason, Phoenix and Scottsdale are grossly lacking on breakfast joints. Can someone please explain this to me?  They did a great job with Over Easy. The food is always good, as is the service.  I like the Pollo Loco."}
{"text":"Breakfast here is good.  Also consistent.  It is a nice place to meet friends for breakfast and catch up.  The wait for a table can be either no wait or 30 minutes.  The signature breakfast is the wolfpack - eggs, hashbrowns, bacon and cheese - all in one stack.  It is really good - but I usually let the boyfriend order this and I order something smaller (like a half order of french toast).  Bacon is good - but can at times be a little greasy and not as crispy as I usually like.  The juices are always good.  Over a good breakfast place."}
{"text":"Found this place on accident, but it has become one of my favorite breakfast spots.  It's decor is cheery and bright yellow.  The only thing I didnt care for was the mint lemonade.  I had a dish (the name escapes me) that was a beef patty on rice, topped with mushroom gravy, topped with 2 eggs.  I don't know why I haven't thought of this earlier!  It was super.  The gravy tasted homemade, wasn't thick or plastery.  The eggs were done perfectly to my order.  My hisband had the chicken fried steak.  It vanished from his plate.  I didnt even get a taste!  We shared a waffle.  Note: this is not a belgian waffle.  It's the old fashioned small hole waffle!  Not crazy about their syrup, but I think it was pure maple syrup, not the Log Cabin I'm used to.  Our waitress sprung for a waffle dog.  That was good!"}
{"text":"We love Over Easy, but unfortunately had a poor experience at this location. The food was on par for the restaurant brand, but the service was seriously lacking. We arrived at 9 AM on a Wednesday, and they were woefully understaffed. Two servers were running around like chickens with their heads cut off. I honestly felt kind of bad for them. This is a mistake on management's part for not scheduling more staff. We waited around at the hostess booth with no hostess to greet us. The male server finally got us a seat and took our drink orders. We waited about 10 minutes for him to come back with our drinks and take our food orders. We subsequently waited about an hour for our food to arrive. In the meantime, we saw two parties who had arrived after us receive their food before us. We will not be returning to this location. The Over Easy at Gilbert and Warner has much better service. They are always fully staffed, and we never wait more than 15 to 20 minutes for our food."}
{"text":"Looking for a place to meet an out of town relative for breakfast and we found this place. We loved it!  We loved the menu, we loved the service and we loved the food. We both ordered their old-fashioned waffles with hot syrup. They were delicious.   This was a great find."}
{"text":"I feel like on a normal day, this place would be pretty good.   But however, when every piece of your bacon, eggs, toast and hash-browns are either cold or luke warm, and you cannot get a waitresses attention after putting in your order, it leaves a bad taste in the mouth   DDD People - the chicken fried steak LOOKED good, but we had been on vacation too long to try something so heavy. However, the bananas foster french toast, which we assume was the last thing cooked because it was still warm, was VERY good."}
{"text":"It's 5:30pm in Wednesday. We ate there at 9:30am and I'm still feeling the meal...not in a good way. The place wasn't full and it took forever to get seated. My Dad said he always wanted to try the place but on the weekends the crowds are crazy. The food took a long time but I figured if it was delicious it would be worth it. The 2 egg breakfast was not worth the wait. The eggs were overdone so they were like brown scrambled and dry. The hash browns tasted fresh. The bacon was done correctly. The pancake tasted bland. It was dense not fluffy. Most pancake batters have some kind of flavor like sweet or I don't know. This one tasted like flour and water. Not great at all. The best part was being at breakfast with my Dad. That's always 5 Stars."}
{"text":"Sooo I tried this for the first time today and I ordered the Wolf Pack- with American cheese, crispy hash-browns, regular bacon and over medium cooked eggs.... and OH-EM-GEE was it amazing!!  Hash-browns are my favorite breakfast side so it was nice to find a place that implemented that as a main breakfast course, and they did it quite well if I may say so myself!  I mean a hash-brown sandwich..... that is ingenious!!!!!  I also got the standard 2 egg breakfast- cooked over easy, with crispy hash-browns, regular bacon and wheat toast for a friend of mine and he absolutely enjoyed it and he's a picky fella when it comes to breakfast! Ohhhh.... btw did I mention I ordered this delivery??? Yeah! Through UberEATS and it was great because my food got here relatively quick compared to other food delivery places and on top of that the food STILL tasted flipping amazing!! No wet slimy hash-brows, no limp or over cooked bacon, no rubbery or over runny eggs, and best of all NO SOGGY TOAST!!!  I am never one to usually write reviews which is how I know this was more then a splendid experience for me! Over Easy, you guys definitely have my vote all day everyday and I most definitely can't wait to explore all the other savory foods you guys have cooking up in that kitchen!"}
{"text":"We fell \"over easy\" for Over Easy!  The draw to Over Easy was the media publicity. It was one of the \"Top 50\" restaurants featured in the Arizona Foothills Magazine and made the spot light, not once - but twice on Food Network.  First on the \"Best Thing I Ever Ate\" for their famous waffle dog and second on \"Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives\".  My fiancé and I arrived around noon and saw a few people waiting outside.  We were in no rush, so the wait was not a problem.  I would say we waited about 20-25 minutes before a table finally opened up.  While walking to our table, I couldn't take my eyes off of the cute animal umbrellas hanging overhead (which they advertise available for purchase).   Ready to Order, we decided on the \"Over Easy\", which is a toasted brioche with sautéed spinach, fried egg, bacon, scallions covered in a natural sauce and the \"Fried Chicken & Waffle\".  The \"Over Easy\" was Ok.  I feel it would have met my standards if maybe a different bread was used? Though the The Chicken & Waffle...AMAZING! The chicken was crunchy and slightly over salted to compliment the sweet and savory waffle...but it did not end there! Luckily one of our servers noticed that we failed to read over the menu and neglected to make their \"secret sauce\" for the waffles! He politely came over, grabbed a side plate and prepared it for us! He poured the maple syrup on the plate and drizzled it with hot sauce then explained how this is their signature concoction made special for this dish.  It was delightful!   Several reviews lowered their scores due to poor service but I am happy to say that we had an attentive and entertaining experience! I agree that they could pep it up a notch but overall, they delivered!  We both left with satisfied tummies and a souvenir tee!        TIP:  Arrive early or expect a wait. Order the Chicken & Waffles and don't forget the sauce!"}
{"text":"Nice staff clean place a bit expensive. $10 for a BIT  (turkey & avocado on it) didn't need turkey avocado but it wad not cheaper without.  Order was Togo,  sandwich was on its side in the box, needless to sway when i opened the box I had to remake my sandwich."}
{"text":"Ok, been there twice more. Each time was better than the last. The \"Tammy\" breakfast sandwich was full of flavor but not very hearty (makes a great light breakfast), the hash-browns super crispy that the entire thing could be picked up with a fork and none of them fall off. I like the hash that way, my friend didn't. They didn't put all the ingredients in her omelet that she asked for, but she claimed it \"not bad\". Also, still had a hard time getting a refill for my coffee.  The next time I ordered the eggs with mushrooms and herbs. Definitely were not stingy with the shrooms, they were piled on. Probably wouldn't have hurt to use some more herbs, but it was still  delicious! Skipped the coffee, so didn't have to worry about refills, and glad I did because I saw the time it took for other tables to get there's. Also, this time they made my friends omelet correct."}
{"text":"As good as the reviews say it is.  Chicken and waffle was absolutely perfect topped w/ their maple syrup.  Staff was quick, friendly and organized.  Even during the busy Sunday rush."}
{"text":"Ate there early Saturday morning. The coffee was at least a day old, the food was served cold. I can cook most of this food at home and it was not anything deserving of a good rating. The only thing that was good was the Recees peanut butter pancakes. The waiter also tried to help us out and did not make us pay for the items that were terrible."}
{"text":"Looking to try a new breakfast place I found Over Easy here on Yelp. The first thing to know is that this place is small, I think they had 5 or 6 smallish booths and then two 4-person tables and two 2 person tables between the booths and the bar area, you can sit at the bar and enjoy breakfast though if you don't require back support. Onto the food, the menu has a pretty decent selection. Lots of different kinds of eggs, pretty much any way you want them. They also had food from the griddle available. I played it pretty safe with their 2 egg breakfast as I was a bit overwhelmed from all the choices. I ordered it with poached eggs, toast, bacon and hashbrowns. The eggs and toast were great, so where the hashbrowns but the bacon was way too crispy for my liking.  All in all the food is pretty good, especially if you like really crisp bacon or a nice portion of hashbrowns."}
{"text":"Holy breakfast batman!  This place had the best breakfast food ever!  Delicious chicken and waffles, red eye gravy ham steak, biscuits and gravy... the whole enchilada of yummy morning food!  Service was fast and excellent.  I'd go back over and over if I lived close.  Triple D was right, this is a great place to grab some yummy breakfast food and not break the bank."}
{"text":"Get the Country Benedict w/sausage gravy.  Perfectly cooked poached eggs ( medium runny) n the cheddar jalapeño biscuit provided the heat ( Bam !!!). Get the Hash Browns nice n crispy.  Waffle dog was perfect way to finish off breakfast. Add hot sauce to maple syrup for unique taste hot n sweet. Highly recommend for great breakfast"}
{"text":"Deliciousness - 2.5/5 Happiness - 1/5  I was so disappointed with this place given the great-looking options on the menu. But just about everything here disappointed.  I had the loco moko (a Hawaiian style dish) and was very disappointed. The entire dish seemed to be unspiced and the mushroom gravy had about 4 mushrooms in it. I ordered a side of corned beef hash and the salt overwhelmed (the opposite problem of the loco moko). My wife ordered the avocado eggs benedict and, while she liked the avocados, agreed the rest of her dish was largely tasteless. The waffle we got for our son was comparable in quality to a frozen food waffle.   The service wasn't much better. Our waters were only re-filled once and it took quite a long time to place our order.  What really came through was the Bloody Mary, bursting with taste and just the right amounts of spice and alcohol. I would definitely return just for another drink. But as for breakfast, you can do far better."}
{"text":"Service was very indifferent. I was able to see other waiters and waitresses that were more exuberant, but not ours. Then the manager asked the loaded question, \"is everything wonderful???\" strategic. Very. But everything was okay at best. I didn't feel like explaining how the bacon was overcooked in my dish, and my eggs were indeed NOT Over Easy. I should have said something.  I imagine the original location is better. I'd give it a shot."}
{"text":"This was not a place I was impressed with on more than one level. First the hostess was horrible, she skipped names, forgot to right names down, I mean the worst. Next the waiter was average but the food was not. When I pay $10 for French toast I expect a full plate of beautiful food not two slices of wonderbread slapped in egg and thrown on a plate. I will not even give this place another chance. It only got a two because the busboy filled my water and smiled."}
{"text":"I like this place for the most part but don't make the mistake of offering the eggs benidict it is sourer.  The poor lemon in it"}
{"text":"Usually when I walk past this place its packed. I stopped in toward end of closing and it was dead. Very fortunate for me because I was in a rush. The server I think I overheard her say her name is Amy was very sweet. I got the basic 2 eggs. Its hard to mess that up so it was good. I felt like the menu was very basic, nothing stood out to me as a must try."}
{"text":"Good breakfast and coffee ! The corn beef hash Benedict is delicious ! The service is always nice and good variety for food and drinks!"}
{"text":"Good place to go after playing hockey in the morning to get some food. Wait staff is good and food is served quick. Awesome Breakfast.....GET THE WOLFPACK!"}
{"text":"I ordered the corned beef hash and eggs with a side of white toast, the toast was awesome!  They serve it with jelly and butter on the side,  I did not care for the hash but the eggs were perfect and the toast was to die for.  Good service and the restaurant is very cute.  I would go again."}
{"text":"This is a great breakfast place, but....  I've gone to Over Easy a couple of times and had a very good breakfast. They have a hungry-man breakfast called the Wolfpack, and if you are a real beast they have a XL Wolfpack. It is a tasty combo of eggs and bacon sandwiched between two healthy portions of crispy hash browns. My guests had the pancakes that were large and fluffy.  My only complaint with Overeasy is the butt screwing price they charge for a cup of tea, $3.25. That is a reaming worse than Starbucks. Too bad OverEasy, your food is very good but when you sneak up from the rear and stick it too customers with something like $3.25 for tea you will see a loss of regular and returning customers."}
{"text":"Over Easy has exactly what you want in a breakfast spot-great food, fast service and plenty of hot coffee. They are famous for the banana and pecan french toast, but my favorites are the corned beef hash and the Wolfpack."}
{"text":"Over Easy was just ok. The hostess that greeted us was really cool and got us seated fast, he even turned up the heat lamp without me asking. I liked the patio vibe a great deal and there were a few couples there with pets which is always nice to see.  The service was pretty slow, our waitress was quick to take our order but seemed to disappear after dropping off our food. We actually had to ask the hostess to go find her so we could get our bill.. I wasn't really impressed with the food. I ordered the wild mushrooms eggs with tots, the tots were gross, they tasted like freezer burnt fried potatoes. The eggs also were not very good, I got scrambled eggs with about 2 pounds of mushrooms on top. You could tell the mushrooms they used had been dehydrated, they were rubbery and had no flavor. If I do go back again I would get the french toast, it looked pretty good with bananas and walnuts.."}
{"text":"This was incredibly disappointing.  I drive by this place almost every day on my way home from physical therapy, so when it was featured on Doozy of a Deal, I jumped at the chance to buy a coupon.   My husband and I came here after hiking in the McDowell Mountain preserve. I had the Mediterranean omelet with a pancake and he had the malted waffle with a side of home fries. My omelet was good, but the cooks foiled my attempt to make it healthy by cooking it in oil. I literally picked up the omelet and put it on a napkin, and the napkin soaked up its oil. Gross. My pancake was very dense and kind of dry. Not light and fluffy like pancakes should be.   My husband's waffle was pretty pathetic. Also dense and flavorless. Here's the scary part: the server dropped off the syrup and it was all frothy...we tasted it and we think it was fermenting. If they use real maple syrup and don't refrigerate it, then it will ferment. We had our server bring us another bottle and that one was better.   Overall we will not be returning. We would both rather go to iHop than Over Easy."}
{"text":"This is the place to eat breakfast food if you're looking for a hip, trendy restaurant in the Arcadia area.  It can get a little busy so I suggest coming during the transition time.  Your best bet is mid morning when the white hairs leave and the sun glass wearing twenty-somethings start arriving.  The food is very good and definitely not fancy.  You're here to get your morning fill and feel cool at the same time.  Prices aren't bad and would be worth it for a little wait, but not worth it waiting for an extended amount of time.  All in all if you're into cool breakfast joints this whould be on your list."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast.  No parking at this location which is located right next to Wells Fargo bank.  Great service - prices a bit high $9.00 for a short stack of pancakes.  Lalia was our server and she was amazing.  Pretty big place with two outside patios and lots of place for your furry friends.  The pancakes were just ok but they do have 100% pure maple syrup so they get an extra star.  Great quick place to get a bite to eat with great service."}
{"text":"The food was very good and tv shows are right in showing this restaurant as a not-to-be-missed place"}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere here and the food is always tasty. I love the Country Benedict. It has cheddar jalapeno biscuits with sausage, a poached egg and house made hollandaise sauce. Breakfast is my absolute favorite food and I love that they are open til 3 on the weekends so I can do brunch later in the day. This place is always really busy on the weekends though so be prepared to wait if you have more than two people. The wait usually isn't that long though, I've never waited more than 15 minutes."}
{"text":"I eat here every Sunday. I love the people along with the unique, healthy menu. I highly recommend the Wolf Pack with American cheese and an extra egg. The coffee is fresh and wonderful."}
{"text":"Tried this for the first time today.  While my hubbies french toast was wonderful and the kiddos enjoyed their meal, my biscuits and gravy tasted much like bacon grease and flour.  Sending it back and trying something else is what I would have liked to do, but the server never returned to check on us until my family was finished with their meal.  The owner did apologize and asked us to give them a try again.  Maybe I will, if the staff gets some training.  Everyone seemed completely overwhelmed.  It's too bad~as I love going out for breakfast."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot.  Very good coffee, food is exceptional, and service is good and friendly.  Try to steak and eggs or the wolfpack.  Always a wait and closes fairly early on the weekends.  Get there before 11 and expect  a wait."}
{"text":"The place has a great location and signage that makes it easy to know what they do And that where it stops Menu is a bit confusing a bit mixed up so I wasn't sure where to look for what  so I just ordered the  special advertised on the table tent only to find out that had expired Had warm poor quality coffee at  $2.50 per cup Wife ordered eggs bacon and hash browns with toast I ordered pancakes My looked burnt but actually weren't but extremely dry  not enough butter in the place to help these guys out. Toast was dry and cool. Eggs were OK  No baby highchair so we has a upset kid for a bit Atmosphere was that of an old cafeteria equipped with broken booths an all Two people has to move out of booths to sit at tables Not my choice for a good BKFST place If you like poor atmosphere,  great location, mediocre food and high priced This place is for you"}
{"text":"I tried them again.  Hash towns were better but I specifically asked for fresh.  Unfortunately there was a long hair that came out of my mouth after the second bite.  Just prior yo that my links were cold.  I'm done."}
{"text":"This little dive breakfast joint is amazing. The prices are decent ranging from $7-12 per meal. They don't serve alcohol so don't go looking for a bloody mary or mimosa. The wait was only 10 minutes since I went at 9:30am. They close around noon or 1pm so go early. They had a shaded area and water for people who were waiting. The host was very nice and didn't need to call my name to be seated. The waitress was very attentive and the order prepared perfectly by the kitchen. My boyfriend ordered strawberry and cream waffles and I got the corned beef hash with a side a homemade hash browns. The food was amazing!!!! I highly recommend checking this place out if you're in the area. It's definitely worth the wait!!"}
{"text":"Killer and humongous omelette. They do not cheat you on the toppings. I built my own and it was fantastic. Didn't get too creative with some of their other fun choices but it looks to be the spot if you'd like to fill up and even get loaded up on the sweet stuff."}
{"text":"First off....OVER PRICED. For 2 people one just ordering oatmeal and the cost was over 24.00. Rediculous priced food. Loud noisy place with screaming kids. I'm not ready to hear in the mornings.  I will not be back."}
{"text":"The first thing that put us off was watching the waiter walk around with his order note pad shoved down the back of his pants.  Watching him take it in and out of his pants and then touching customers plates was nauseating.  Very unsanitary.   The table next to us had several children which were all playing loud games on iPads with the game music full blast.  It was obvious that all of the surrounding guests were getting very annoyed.  The staff should have asked them to turn the music off.  We were going to asked to be moved, however after finding a big black hair in my breakfast, I was no interested in finishing my meal at another table.  This place is absolutely disgusting and we will not be back."}
{"text":"Awesome food, efficient service. One of the best Breakfast places in Maricopa County!"}
{"text":"We are in Gilbert visiting from PA and we stopped in for breakfast. Excellent food, we had the French toast that was featured on TV along with the steak and eggs. Both were delicious and service was excellent! I want to go back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food here. Its a real outside-the-box kind of place with very different breakfast menu. Different is delicious here. Seriously...try the waffle dogs. Why haven't you tried them yet......I'll wait. Only knocks against this place (which at this point are what I call first world problems, as they are not real issues): Seating is cramped both inside and out, and being right next to the ice den, this place has lots of people around. Inside, outside. Not a cozy little nook, if that is what you're after, but the food will win you over."}
{"text":"Saw this place on 3D (Diner, Drive-ins, Dives) and took the long way home from Vegas (to San Diego) just to try it.  Well worth it.  The French Toast was really really really good.  The best thing any of us ordered were the Waffle Dogs.  Also one of the best Bloody Marias I've had.  Worth the extra drive."}
{"text":"Really good food & service. They have a cute patio. Very clean. Not a large selection of a \"healthy\" menu options"}
{"text":"Over Easy was in my bookmark list And I always like to try new breakfast/brunch joints because... Well... I'm never up this early, and on a weekend... Over easy is a small cute joint located in a shopping center plaza. I really like the teal/yellow color scheme. Very friendly and warm. It was busy this morning but we got seated upon walk in...  I ordered Water and Earl Grey tea and the tea came in a cute mini kettle :) It is good for this brisk morning If you know me, I love Corn Beef Hash So of course I see it on the menu and that is what I ordered... My meal was very satisfying :) It was nice and hot and the eggs were cooked perfectly over easy haha and the wheat toast was good  Omg but the Loko Moko really caught my eye...  It is a hamburger patty on top of white rice, covered with brown mushroom gravy, topped with two eggs and style and crispy fried onions. Totally sounds like something my grandmother makes for me I will have to get that on my next visit!"}
{"text":"Breakfast, party of 3. I ordered the smothered burrito with mushrooms, onions, & spinach. My friends ordered the country fried steak and the corn beef hash. We also got a malted waffle to share. Everything was delicious. The server was attentive and did everything right. We had the best time and will be back. (I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because my burrito was just slightly bland.)"}
{"text":"Horrible service. We went for breakfast today and the teenage hostesses told us it would be a ten minute wait. There were a few other parties ahead of us that, after waiting 15 min, told us they were also told 10 min and they had been there a half hour. A teenage hockey team walked in from next door at the Ice Den and were immediately seated in front of 5 parties of people that had been waiting for over a half hour. The food was ok, we've had better, but we won't be going back."}
{"text":"If you're a breakfast person then you'll love this place.  Everything on the menu looks pleasing, but I normally get the dessert pancakes or any of the breakfast sandwiches.  We arrived here right after a great morning workout so we were hungry and ready to eat.  It was about 10:15 and the place was a bit full.  We waited about 10 minutes to be seated first available which ended up being outside on the patio.  The weather is nice this time of year so I didn't mind at all.  Except the glare of the sun was reflecting off the stainless steel tables right in my eyes.  Not pleasant at all, but not the restaurants fault.  Service was good and I only had to ask the server for a refill of water once.  She did forget my Cholula sauce when I asked for some though.  Food was amazing and just the right serving to feel satisfied.  I selected the Patsy breakfast sandwich with some added jalapenos-duh!"}
{"text":"I've heard about this place from numerous people and decided I have to try it. I was impressed from the start. The staff was very friendly and welcoming as soon as we walked in. We were sat immediately on the patio and served promptly. I ordered the wolf pack and it was delicious! Really filling, you won't leave hungry. Chelsea was our server and did an excellent job! I definitely recommend this place for anyone in the mood for a great breakfast."}
{"text":"Easter Brunch was on our schedule for today we had several local restaurants to choose from with food specials for the Holiday. I called around 11:30 am to check wait times for Easter Brunch receptionist said no waiting that surprised me, I gathered the family and off to Over Easy we went. My past experience was great at the Phoenix location, I could not wait till this new location opened. I arrived around noon to Over Easy and the dining room had only 8 tables full and 85% of the location was vacant and this is Easter Sunday. !!!!!  We were seated with menus and our first contact with the server it was 8 minutes from the time we were seated, remember Easter Sunday. The staff in Over Easy out numbered the customers. The server took our food and drink order, The food arrived quicker then the wait to order, The jalapeno cheddar biscuits were cold with a the gravy was bland that tasted like sweet cold flour gravy. The hash browns were hash blacks and two of the three orders were burnt black, we sent one order back.The Mile High Omelet was 50 percent cheese with small amount of ham, peppers and onions. The chocolate chip pancakes ordered special for the kid had little or no chocolate chips. We ordered two cups of coffee and one water, the coffee cups were dirty with a brown-coffee film in both cups, I had to rub the inside of the cups to remove the old dirty coffee stain. the water glass was cracked and served that way, The server stated the cups were older and stained. This location has been open only 3 months how can the cups be old they were filthy not washed properly. Last issue was the staff  loading the orange juice machine with oranges in a box that was on the floor and put on the breakfast bar were customers eat that was not expected.  The Over Easy experience fell way short of our previous experience , The server expressed our concerns to the manager who discounted or bill. The manager never came to the table to voice her actions with the customer. I thought that any contact with the manager showing concern would help address our issues, I guess the being a customer at the Mesa Over Easy is not a priority. I had to apologize to my family of my poor choice for our family Easter Brunch"}
{"text":"I was excited to see a new brunch place in Mesa, but unfortunately, our experience did not live up to the hype.  The restaurant looks clean and spacious, and the wait staff was helpful and friendly.  But the food left much to be desired.  Perhaps we should have gone earlier in the day, but we were unimpressed with our orders.  My husband ordered the country fried steak, and it was pretty bland.  The gravy was really runny, and the steak was mostly fried batter.  I had the scrambled egg white with mushrooms, and that was decent.  It could have used a little bit more seasoning.  Overall, the food was fine, just not anything to get excited about.  We might be back if we're in the area, but I don't think I would ever go out of my way to come here again."}
{"text":"The staff was friendly and attentive.  I had egg whites and they where fluffy and done right.  Also crispy bacon, toast and well cooked hash browns.  It was a nice big portion all tasted really good.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Came with my aunt on a Tuesday morning and we enjoyed it! My aunt ordered the waffle dog and they were delicious. I ordered eggs Benedict and loved it. Definitely want to come back soon!"}
{"text":"I've been lead astray by Mr. Guy Fieti ALA Dinners Drive- In's and Dives , but not this time.  Friendly service, clean restaurant, and fresh dericious food that made me gorge myself to the point of not being able to eat till dinner time.  Fan-fucking-tastic."}
{"text":"To all of you Over- Easy haters. Get bent.  Honestly, if this place was so bad, why give it two stars instead of one? If you going to get all Office Space on somthin' , put your big-boy pants on and drop the friggen' hammer! Also don't write a review just because they were closed when you had a snack attack and it fizzed you.   This is A M E R I C A, not communist china  (YOU EAT EGG NOW!) the proprietors of this fine establishment can open and close as they see fit.  And to finish, this place is the king, better than Matt's.  I like Matt's but it is Over Easy's bitch.  Squirell style."}
{"text":"I was watching an episode of Diners, Drive-In's and Dives and had to drive down and see what this little place was all about. We came on July 4th-we had a small wait, no more than at any breakfast place on a weekend. We waited about 10-15 min for a table for 2. We sat on the outdoor patio-it was hot, but they had fans going and it's shaded.. I had the ham and cheese omlette and my husband had the chicken fried steak. Both dishes were great. My omlette was well done, just like I love it (and I didn't even have to request it that way).  My only complaint was the iced coffee I ordered was incredibly weak. It tasted like regular coffee sitting in a puddle of water. Aside from that...friendly service-nice sized portions, and charming atmosphere. We'll be back."}
{"text":"We really enjoy breakfast at Over Easy. The food is always consistent and unique. The jalapeño blood Mary and orange is a must. We also enjoy the breakfast sandwich, pancakes, and Wolfpack."}
{"text":"Small place inside but nice porch. The food was good and quick service. All in all a good place. Nothing wowed me too much except.. The tater tots.. Best tots I've ever had. I'd come back but so many other places to try it wouldn't be the first place I'd go back to."}
{"text":"Disorganized. Disgusting. But friendly, and the price is right.    Several open tables, yet still a 20 minute wait.  Almost as many staff as customers, yet you have to physically grab one of them to get some attention.  My bananas foster french toast had maybe 10 paper thin slivers of bananas and was swimming in caramel sauce to the point it filled my plate.  It was disgusting.  I kid you not - I literally washed the caramel sauce off my french toast with maple syrup to lighten things up.  Their coffee is just nasty; reminiscent of my grandma's and bad even loaded with cream and sugar.  Staff are some of the nicest people you'd want to be around, unless you're relying on them to serve you breakfast.  Prices are probably the best in North Scotts. for breakfast.  Yes, I'd go back.  It's possible they're still settling into the new location, and they seem to have the right attitude to eventually get things running smoothly."}
{"text":"Tried this out for the first time, it was good, though I was not super impressed, partially my fault.  I ordered the Over Easy which I loved, the brioche was great and the eggs were amazing and melded well into the bread. She had the corned beef hash, which we did not like at all, then again I have never had corned beef hash that wasn't from a Filipino restaurant, or that I made on my own. We also tried the biscuits and gravy, I enjoyed it, but it wasn't as flavorful as I thought, but then again I was drinking a cup of black coffee and she had the amazing iced coffee.  The service was exemplary and I would come again to try some French toast and waffles."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. The wait was reasonable and the staff was friendly. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Not bad. Great service, wonderful staff. I had the Chicken Fried Stake which was good with an egg on top. The wife had breakfast burger which she liked. Only issue was the pancakes which were dry and needed a lot of syrup a lot. So I would pass up on those. But everything else was great. Will comeback to try other menue items."}
{"text":"I went here last Sunday after a race (with a very hungry stomach) and I was completely satisfied.  First, let me say why the four stars instead of five stars.  The place was packed and the tables are close together.  This isn't super typical for the Gilbert area, so I'd like to see a little more space.  BUT, that being said, I'll still come back again because that's only a minor issue.  The server was fantastic and polite, but I think they were a little understaffed for the weekend.  For those two reasons I'm giving a four instead of five star rating.  But, when it comes to the food and menu...FANTASTIC.  I had a chicken friend steak with country gravy, two eggs and hashbrowns.  The meal was delicious.  My friend had pecan waffles, and they were also quite good.  The place is kid-friendly.  And they are happy to give to-go cups for drinks, which I always appreciate.  I like the upbeat vibe of the facility, and it was clean.    If you haven't tried this place yet, I do recommend it.  I know I'll be going back for more.  The only bummer is the possible wait, because it's good."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast.  Good coffee.  Lattes.  Cool outside seating area with mountain views.  French toast thick brioche and good.  Well done over easy eggs (hardest breakfast thing to pull off consistently- so they lived up to their name).  Would definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"The hash was disgusting, it looked like it came out of the can.  They did not even bother to grill the hash enough to give it a crust, it was more watery than anything.  My cousins got the \"waffle dog\" that had raw batter on the inside.  Will not go back, I do not recomend this place to anyone! Service was not rude, but not attentive either."}
{"text":"So my wife and I came here after a fun weekend of letting loose in Scottsdale. We decided on this rest because of the  exposure it got from Guy the host of tripleD. Well, we arrive and it's packed, 15 minute wait. Good sign right? Well no. It was a bad exp.  it took them 15 minutes to get us water and coffee. It took 30 minutes to get our food and 20 minutes to get toast which I ordered in my first order. My wife said her fork and food smelled like a sneeze and the guy sitting next to us sent his food back. He had the hash. I had the country fried steak and it was bland. No salt or nothing. My wife had the omelette and she said it tasted like fake fluffy school cafeteria egg. And it had an M&m in it. A blue one! Wtf. Yea we won't be going back. Oh yea and they charge for refills.   Eater beware!!!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today, and had a really good experience.  Staff was friendly, normal, helpful and nice to be around.  The restaurant itself is moderately spacious, with bar and table seating.  Food here was awesome!  Combined with the service, I will be back.  I could tell that this place has a ton of regulars.  I liked that.  What a great gem.  The food was tasty, fresh and reliable.  Menu had a great selection of items, with a variety of choices and combinations.  Entirely breakfast, probably one of the more overlooked places in town.  Just finding this place now and love it.  Amazing service, great menu.   Parking here is tight, but a staff member guided me in the lot to show me where to go and park."}
{"text":"We originally planned on going to snooze this past Sunday but I passed it so we saw this place by Biltmore and decided to try it out. First thing that caught me was the bright yellow booths, chairs, and decor. Very clean and bright, that shiny happy kind of kitchen vibe. We got there just before the rush so were seating right away and order taken pretty quickly. The only reason this isn't getting 5 starts is because the waiter was mediocre compared to the restaurant itself and once the rush hit the waiters started frantically running around like chickens with no heads. Otherwise, food was soooo good and the fresh squeezed orange juice was amazing. I'll most likely go again."}
{"text":"I think this place has lost their edge.  The new location lacks character and both plates we had were blah/mediocre.  However, someone did ask how the food was, I gave them an honest answer and they did take a dish off of the check.  I give them a star for that."}
{"text":"It's always a good sign when the parking lot is full and this was case at this place. I had the Selena which was a breakfast burrito which included egg, hash browns and a choice of three items from the omelette menu. I opted for my hash browns to be on the outside and not inside of the burrito and the burrito was still huge.  This place is a must if you're looking for a great breakfast, a lot to choose from."}
{"text":"Over Easy is a can't miss. The service was attentive and friendly but not in a fake, overbearing way. I ordered the Wolf Pack:  2 eggs* any style, bacon & choice of cheese between two layers of hashbrowns. I ended up taking about half of it home. It's a good amount of food. If you like the typical breakfast foods this plate bundles them all together nicely! Wife had the blueberry pancakes. It is hard to get perspective of their size in the picture but she was able to eat about a quarter of that and ended up with 2 more meals from the left overs. Prices were very reasonable, especially considering the amount of food they serve up. I will choose this place over IHOP or Denny's any day."}
{"text":"Excellent spot for breakfast near Mill st. Not as rowdies, but excellent choices and services. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I have been to over easy many times, it's a cute little place that has some good untraditional options. I think the low carb steak and eggs is delicious; chicken fried steak was pretty good, but not the best; and I was surprised that I really enjoyed the loco moco!! It also made me happy that they have espresso, mmmm! The cappuccino is ok but their lattes are pretty good."}
{"text":"As many of the reviewers, I heard about Over Easy on Food Network's \"Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives\" and decided I needed to check this place out. I unfortunately was not greeted by the jolly chef I saw on TV, but I was greeted by what I presume to be the same breakfast dishes he inspired. It was an interestingly unique atmosphere with good service and great food! It was very busy and did take us a little while to be seated but my girlfriend and I eventually found our way inside and had a good experience.  Keep singing,  -Jerron"}
{"text":"This is a tiny spot, tucked into a Scottsdale strip mall. I guess it was made famous with a Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives episode, but it deserves fame in it's own right. Things are made from scratch like the cheddar-jalapeno biscuits (spicy!) and the corned beef hash (some of the best ever). We also tried the Wolfpack, layers of cheese, bacon, and hashbrowns. The hashbrowns could have been a little more brown, but that is the only complaint. Drinks were quickly refilled and service was friendly. The layout is really tight quarters and lingering is not invited, so keep that in mind depending on what type of breakfast/brunch atmosphere you are looking for. But, certainly the food is first rate."}
{"text":"I live so close to this place, and I want to love it so bad. Unfortunately, after 3 times being here, I will not go back. Here's why. Pros: Food was edible  Awesome mimosa selections Cons: Slow service Don't know how to poach an egg Coffee is HORRIBLE Hollandaise sauce is pickly  We will not be returning. Go to village inn or black bear diner."}
{"text":"Went there with high expectations. Got the Mediterranean omelette. Big portion but the omelette itself ... meh. Not fluffy, a bit greasy and overdone.  Ordered a side of bacon - not crispy, greasy.  Needed more cooking time.  Press coffee is decent."}
{"text":"Today was our second visit to Over Easy.  The place has been busy every weekend since it opened, so we were hoping the rain would keep people home today.  However, it was still packed but we were able to sit immediately because the patio was open (the north-facing patio is going to be great for breakfast this summer.)  Both times we have been here, the service has been great, and the staff all very friendly. Our server did a great job keeping our coffees and waters filled. The manager came out to our table a couple of times to make sure everything was good.  One of the nice thing about Over Easy is are the unique items on the menu ... particularly, Gary's Spinach Loaf ... it's simply amazing!  My husband loved the corned beef hash and my children loved their strawberries and cream waffles and cheddar jalapeno biscuits and gravy.  The portion sizes are normal sized and the ingredients are fresh.  If you are looking for huge \"lumberjack special\" 1200 calorie breakfasts,go to Denny's ... if you're looking for a GREAT breakfast, this place is hard to beat. Oh ... forgot to mention, they also serve local beers and specialty drinks."}
{"text":"Hmmmm... I'm not sure which box to check... 3 or 4... 3 or 4... I'm going to go with a 3, but I am certain that a second go-around would leave me with a 4 impression.  The service was definitely 5 stars, except for the reco by my server to add Swiss cheese to my egg white omelet. Egg whites = bland. Swiss Cheese = pungent. Some may say a good dichotomy, but I disagree. I will say that my dining partner delighted in the wild mushroom and herb eggs and strawberry lemonade.   I had to use the bathroom, which happens to be located out around the back. Think any one of the \"____bertos\" Mexican places, and you will pick up what I am laying down. However, I was surprised at the cleanliness despite the fact that I had to use the men's restroom because the W's was occupied.   Overall, the place is cute. Quite cute. However, because cute generally infers small, I was left smelling like sizzling bacon all day. Now, to some that would be a good thing, but being a vegetarian, I am not overly partial to the smell of fried pork flesh. But I digress."}
{"text":"I had the pecan/banana french toast (half order) and the hash browns. I liked the former more than the latter. Nice light breakfast for only 7 bucks, plus tip. The latter was OK, perhaps I was expecting more based on some of the reviews. I did like that they had Cholula on the table for a quick spice-up of the hashbrowns. The french toast was, however, the star of the show. I found myself eating it slowly, trying to dissect the ingredients, 'cause I know the missus would have loved this, and I'll need to try and recreate it one weekend for breakfast."}
{"text":"Went to Over Easy and restaurant was clean.  The menu listed items that have been featured on TV.  My husband asked if it was their take or their original recipes- the waitress replied their recipes. My husband ordered the waffle dogs and I ordered the waffle.  My husband waffle dogs were 3 1/2 size corn dogs on a plate with syrup for $10, they were very bland.  I had the waffle which was cold and looked more like a kid waffle.   My husband then ordered some corned beef hash as the $10 waffle dogs was not enough.  A side of corned beef hash is $5.00.  They were bland, potatoes not cooked, and corned beef was bland.  I was not impressed and will not be back.  If you are looking to get a small breakfast with no flavor for a high price this is your place."}
{"text":"I've been going to Over Easy for about 3 years now and it had always been my favorite breakfast spot.  The Waffle Dogs are amazing and what got them \"famous\" I believe. And the Wolf Pack was absolute perfection. Syrup and Cholula?! Who knew!   I introduced many friends to this place and everyone fell in love. Unfortunately the last two times I've been within the past 2 months has been terrible! Each time something was subpar.   Portions are smaller, eggs are way overcooked, bacon is dry, burnt and old looking, ingredients are skimpy and do not taste fresh.  To top it off, service is MEH and I don't think our server said more than 5 words to us the entire meal.   Today I finally had to confess to my boyfriend that it is off our radar. But I'll still dream about the Waffle Dogs in my sleep!"}
{"text":"The over easy iced coffee is one of my favorites! Loveeee the cardamom! Corned beef hash is also really excellent."}
{"text":"Staff is real friendly and laid back and the food is real good. Also had a side of sweet potato tots with my meal and I'm glad the waitress suggested it !"}
{"text":"Perhaps I've ordered the wrong things or just have shown up on off-days during my 4-5 visits to OE, but I've left wholly unimpressed on every occasion:   The cheddar jalapeño biscuits and gravy weren't worth finishing; punctuated by the taste of raw flour in the dry, particle board-like consistency of the biscuits and the thin and relatively bland gravy topping them. This was a let down, since biscuits & gravy are one of my favorite dishes of all.   The country benedict was another dish I'd ordered during a subsequent visit and also was let down by. This comes with a cheddar jalapeño biscuit as well, so I purposely ordered it to see if the same taste described above was present. It was. Dry, raw flour particle board-like biscuit again. To add to the frustration, this country benedict was topped with two nearly solid-yolked poached eggs. I think anyone ordering eggs benedict expects yolks to spill out & drizzle & meld with the hollandaise sauce upon cutting into them. These just sat there like soft boiled eggs cut in half. Covering the eggs was a hollandaise sauce that tasted highly acidic- more like a mustard or lemon bite to it than the smooth, rich and decadent hollandaise I was accustomed to. Perhaps the hollandaise was 'right' according to OE standards, but I didn't enjoy it in any way. Rounding this out was sausage patties, which tasted fine and tater tots as my potato side. I can deal with one miscue in an eggs benedict dish, but three full-on miscues? Eggs done wrong, highly acidic hollandaise, dry/raw flour tasting bread? Nope. The pork and potato side should not be the highlight of a benedict. Ever. I ate slightly more than half before I pushed my plate away and decided to speak to the manager about my meal and to express my disappointment. He kindly removed the entree from my bill, and I paid for my OE iced coffee and left about a 30% tip. That OE Ice coffee is the one redeeming factor; I do love that drink.   Add consistently grungy, dirty table tops and slow(but competent) service to the disappointing dishes I've had on every visit, and I simply have zero interest in returning. I gave 'em 4 or 5 college tries to get it right, but it's obvious that OE simply isn't the place for me."}
{"text":"I used to be a real fan of Over Easy, I used to eat at their first location. Boy how things have changed.   I ate here in July 2015. First, they removed some of the best items from their menu, like the Loco Moco. The manager told me \"we don't want to carry inventory\" probably due to their 'we will rule the world' expansion plans. The breakfast sausage links were awful. Must have been from the supermarket    Coffee was bland. They sold my spouse on the iced coffee but we both agreed it was nothing special.   Sorry Over Easy, I would rather eat at Harlow's or Matt's or Snooze."}
{"text":"Excellent.    I love having breakfast out and this place is exactly what a breakfast place should be as far as I'm concerned.  Quick, friendly and no-nonsense service.  We both had omelets and they were big, hot and delicious.  Toast was perfect, as were the hash browns.  Coffee was hot and frequently refilled.  Breakfast for 2 is about 20 bucks.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"The place always has good food however my breakfast the other day wasn't consistent.  Of my poached eggs, one was hard and the other medium, which is how I like them.  I consider myself lucky because I forgot to specify how I wanted them cooked and the server never asked.  I did ask for my hashbrowns crispy and that was not the case.  They were fresh and tasty but not crispy at all.  Lastly the grilled ham in my benedict was lukewarm.  Over Easy always used great ingredients and their dishes have great flavor but this is the first of my dozen visits that it was inconsistent.  I'll be back and hope they've sorted it out otherwise i'll have to let them know."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times but this time was the best. Our server Carlie was amazing. Very attentive with a great attitude. I'm not sure when you all hired her but she is a huge asset to your team. The food was the best I've had here as well. Cheers to a great job!"}
{"text":"Been here three times at this point. Twice at least somewhat hung over and once sober. The first time everything was waaay too salty. The second time everything was great. the latest - and most sober trip - was underwhelming. There were so many snowbirds that we barely got a seat. The food was okay but nothing special. Did I just miss this in my earlier quests for greasy breakfast food? Possibly.   The highlight was the brioche french toast. Something called the wolfpack always catches my eye but then scares me off -bacon, eggs, and sausage sandwiched between two orders of hash browns. Chicken fried steak has been everything from amazing to mediocre. The waffle looked like it came out of an EGO box from the frozen section.   In the end is it worth it? Maybe. It depends how close it is and your tolerance level for jovial Canadians. My personal tolerance fluctuates wildly as the spring goes on so keep it in mind."}
{"text":"I just went here with some friends and found they had a very wide selection of breakfast.  I had the Chicken Fried Chicken with a Waffle.  It was pretty good but they had a fairly limited selection of hot sauce to go on it.  Not nearly as good as Lo Lo's.    My kids had chocolate waffles and m&m pancakes... both looked pretty gross to me.  (Too sweet).   It was a nice morning to enjoy an out door breakfast.   They were crowded but I guess that was because they were on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives on a repeat last night.  They have a fairly small dining area in a building that was an older Taco Bell.   It was good but not worth dealing with the crowds from the resulting hype good."}
{"text":"I'm going to have to agree with Mb. F.  Although I've only given it two chances.  I mean really I shouldn't have to give a place chances.  If I'm not in love with it the first time, then it's not looking so hot.  First time I tried one of their signature dishes the caramelized banana and pecan french toast.  Sorry it was completely toasted on the outside and soggy and eggy on the inside.  I'm not a picky person either, but that's kind of a turn off when your toast is not done... yet too done on the outside.  My husband had the Hopple Popple, which was fine.. it's just didn't stand out.  Then for my second chance, I had a hankering for chicken fried steak, which many have recommended.  The only thing it had going for it was the gravy.  I will give them that.  Otherwise, it was fine.. For me I would describe it as, middle of the road.. not great.. not terrible.. just not so hot that I'll be back.  Sorry."}
{"text":"Let me clarify one thing. Breakfast is my favorite meal but I never real make it out for breakfast cause I like to sleep in on the weekends. Saying this. I was watching Triple D on the Food Network and saw this place. Home made everything. So the next day I had to go out of my way for brunch to try this place out. OE was hard to find but it's between the Ice Den and Mountainside Fitness.   There was so many good dishes on Triple D I couldn't decide. So I went with Chicken Fried Steak, scrambled eggs, and hash browns. All I have to say is oh my gosh Yum Yum. CFS was so good but the gravy made it great. Gravy was home made with chunks of sausage. The hash browns are home made too and outstanding. My wife had the home made corn beef hash with poached eggs, and sweet potato tots. Great dish too. CFH was really good and the tots was really delish. My daughter had the Wolfpack with hash browns, eggs and bacon. She gobbled it down and the bacon was thick and really good.   Service was really good. We only had to wait a few minutes to get our table. Once seated, we were served right away. Drinks were refilled on a regular basis. Brunch was so good. I can't wait to go again and try more dishes. All I can say is great breakfast joint so enjoy."}
{"text":"Greatest steak and eggs of my life. Also, customer service is phenomenal. Can't say enough good things about this place. 10/10. Would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"What a great and easy restaurant. It's got such a simple layout and a solid menu. The staff was really friendly and the food was delicious. The dishes were fresh and hot and they tasted authentic and made from scratch. Great spot!"}
{"text":"02.06.10  First Guy Fieri stop of the trip.  I was uber excited.  The sign that says \"immediate seating available\" was lit.  I got more excited.  Then we got to the front and there's a 20 minute wait.  Fail.  We finally sat down and ordered rather quickly.  I was very impressed by the waitress' memorization abilities.  Four girls, four different orders, no screw ups!  Skip the over easy iced coffee [http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8R_oemw4rNjJL6sd40O_oQ?select=DRcQS3U0pmtHcqY6Zc89sA] unless you want to throw money down the drain.  I was pretty sold on the condensed milk, which I tasted none of.  The over easy [http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8R_oemw4rNjJL6sd40O_oQ?select=0MzUIc2RG7fhoSWUZWsQsg] was pretty amazing.  Toasted brioche with sauteed spinach, fried egg, natural jus with bacon and scallions.  I love it when the egg yolk runs all over the plate and flavors the rest.  Brioche french toast with powdered sugar [http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8R_oemw4rNjJL6sd40O_oQ?select=pTqJm4xH8-P3jMHjSs0YTQ].  Nothing out of the park spectacular, but a decent piece of bread.  Skip the peanut butter and jelly french toast [http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8R_oemw4rNjJL6sd40O_oQ?select=B9ZFxdlGAxglX8F_bisMEw].  They actually ran out when we were there, and this was their last one.  It counts as a half order, but Marti L. got it for free.  Cholla!  The omelets [http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8R_oemw4rNjJL6sd40O_oQ?select=3tlYcgH0q81PXep-GPUpvg] are not for the faint of heart.  These are huge, and comes with a heaping side of tater tots [insert Napoleon Dynomite joke here].  Decent prices, good service, but food is hit or miss."}
{"text":"There are so many delicious options for brunch at this place. No matter what you order, it will come out fast, right, and always taste good. They are consistent every time, come in once a weekly, once a month, or once a year, and the food will always taste good. The staff is always friendly,  service top notch. The cocktails are strong and the espresso is very good. There is always a crowd, but the wait is minimal, and so worth it. The counter is truly the best spot."}
{"text":"One of the top breakfast joints in the city. My only knock from 5 stars to 4 is the wait and lack of adequete seating while you wait. The food itself is awesome and the wait staff are always friendly and efficent. Love the iced coffee."}
{"text":"The same great food as their Phoenix location but it is just missing the same old school charm of the owner yelling at the cooks to get the food out fast.  It has a nice patio next to the ice rink. The main advantage of the Scottsdale location is the extended hours and larger seating capacity than their Phoenix place."}
{"text":"I went here with a friend because I saw it on a show on the food network. I didn't get what was featured but i got the salmon lox with fruit which was delicious. The egg looked really nice and the salmon tasted soft and tender. I was expecting lox but it was cooked but tasted fine. Also got the cheddar jalapeno biscuits with gravy. the gravy had bacon and thick pieces of sausage. The biscuits were ok. They could ahve had more taste to it. I couldn't really taste the jalapeno. Overall, it was a good experience."}
{"text":"After nearing about Over Easy on Drive inns Diners & Dives. We tried the Over Easy on Indian School Rd in Phx Az.  We were not disappointed.  The atmosphere was similar to the Diners I remember back in the day. The food was cooked just the way we love it, no crusties  on the eggs, the bacon crisp, just the way it was ordered.  I ordered a breakfast burrito with items that I wanted in the Burrito.  Very, very tasty.  We will definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"Just had breakfast here with the hubby and I must say I like this location better than the one on Power. They are more friendly here and it's cleaner.   I had an omelette and hashbrowns and both were yummy. I actually really like their hashbrowns. Hubby had chicken fried steak and loved it.   Not gourmet food by any means but good enough to have breakfast! Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I've been to Over Easy twice now.   The first time I really didn't like it but it was so long ago I figured why not try it again?   I ordered egg breakfast, eggs over medium, hash browns, bacon and substituted pancakes for the toast. Found a hair on my eggs. YUCK!! the hash browns were good and the pancake was decent. I really really don't like their bacon. Coffee is weak.   Husband had chicken fried steak and tater tots. He enjoyed it. I liked it better than I likes mine.   I have to say I think I would like this place more but the service is just not very good. They're just not THAT helpful or friendly and kind of feels like doing their job bugs them. Could be just the attitude you have as a 17 year old girl though."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place since it's very close to my office, but it was below average. I ordered two eggs scrambled, a side of bacon, and a side of corned beef hash. I saw food come up while my server was busy checking out customers at the front. Meanwhile the manager and another server walked by my food several times. They even took other food to tables while mine sat. When the manager started bagging a to-go order that came up 5 minutes after my food I approached her and asked for my food. None of it was good, all very mediocre and not very warm. The eggs were dry and bland. The corned beef hash had a slimy consistency. The bacon was obviously very cheap, extremely thin and lacking in flavor.   The server was very nice and friendly though. It's just too bad the manager isn't picking up the slack when the server is busy checking out customers."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I am giving an extra star just for the cups made from plant material. Not sure they're more eco-friendly than washing glass or plastic, but at least they're not using more Solo crap.  The outdoor-ish seating (there was an exterior of wood planks that let light in without being \"outdoor\") was nice, albeit a bit crowded.  The food was ok. I had something called a wolf pack. It was \"ok\". Nothing to write home about.  My coffee cup sat empty for most of my meal. The orange juices we ordered for my daughters were pathetic; about an inch in the bottom of aforementioned cups.  Service left much to be desired, but it certainly wasn't the worst service I've experienced in my life.  I wouldn't tell someone to NOT go there, but I would certainly tell them to not expect greatness.  I would rather go to IHOP or Denny's."}
{"text":"Homemade preserves and Bloody Mary mix are great. Eggs Benedict are amazing, tried my friends order and I was jealous that I ordered the sausage, tomato, cheddar omelette because it was so dry. Besides that great surroundings and wait staff."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a late breakfast last Saturday with a friend. This is one of her favorite breakfast spots. The place was pretty packed for 11 o'clock on a Saturday morning but we were seated immediately. My girlfriend informed me that she loves their omelets and suggested that I try one but I was curious about the redeye gravy and instead ordered the ham steak with redeye gravy, egg, home fries and a small cranberry juice.   I was not a fan of the brand of cranberry juice they sell but diluted it with water and managed to get it down. The food. Can you really go wrong with breakfast? The hamsteak, eggs and home fries were uneventful, average at best nothing spectacular here. I did not enjoy the redeye gravy. It was bitter. Thank goodness they did not give me a lot or it would have ruined my meal. In a nutshell, the service was quick and efficient, the food average for a breakfast spot and our server was attentive and polite."}
{"text":"I'm going to have to join the ranks of \"meh\" on this one. I have previously steered clear of Over Easy because of all the negative reviews here, but today being Memorial Day Weekend, it was the only place that was open (we later saw that The Big Orange was open, but sorely lacking in parking spots), so we gave it a try.   We were told 10-15 minutes from the host, and I was skeptical when I saw the packed dining area, but truly we only waited about 7. So a big thumbs up for hustling us in. The patio area, which appears to hold the majority of the tables, was the best part of the experience. Shady, cool, and comfortable, and effectively shielded from the ugliness of Indian School.   Then we proceeded to wait...and wait...and wait for our food. Took forever! The waitress did mention that they were down one cook. Fortunately we weren't in a hurry and hubby and I got to spend some quality together. No biggie. Our waitress forgot my mint-lemonade for about 15 minutes, and when I got it, it was simultaneously too sweet and too watery. The coffee was fair, no complaints. The water was typical Phoenix...obviously not filtered.  The food: I got the corned beef hash with two eggs sunny-side up and toast. Whoa baby, those eggs had barely touched the pan before they were spooned on to my plate! There was still a gelatinous coating of RAW floating on top of my liquid yolks, and I considered sending it back, but by then I was starving, Salmonella be damned. My corned beef hash was tasty but had several chunks of chewy gristle mixed in. Mmmmm...connective tissue....  So this place gets points for ambience, but loses stars for food quality and price. I am willing to give it another try on a non-holiday weekend, because it's close to our house and we need a good brunch place."}
{"text":"Had the absolute worst service here today.  Straight from the Amy's Baking Co handbook.  As a former regular we will never go back.  Our entire table was flabbergasted at the treatment we received, it was embarrassing.  There are plenty of decent breakfast places with great service in the area that will gladly get our business in the future.  Not this place!"}
{"text":"I saw this on DDD and had to try it when visiting my sister in Scottsdale.  Had the chicken fried steak, which was featured on the show and man, what a disappointment.  The steak was tough and over cooked and the gravy barely had any flavor.   The potatoes were just OK.  Not worth the visit at all.  I had a much, much better omelet at the Perk Eatery on E. Greenway, and I have no affiliation whatsoever.  I'm from Ohio."}
{"text":"So my family was in town for the weekend and of course there are only a few things to do in Phoenix shop, drink, and eat. In addition to that the family had done their Food Network research looking for recommendations Over Easy being one of them.   Now I have to admit two things: 1. I am not a huge breakfast person....well not really a breakfast person at all.  2. Despite that I had been eager to try Over Easy due to the FN hype and its crowd every weekend.   Now to the food. I ordered the corn beef hash...I love my hash...with toast and coffee. It was a good portion with flavor and I was pretty happy with it. The rest of the group got the banana French toast and waffle. Both were pleased but not blown away.   In the end Over Easy gets 3 stars due to something that's probably not their fault, over hype. The food was decent but nothing crazy. The atmosphere is what killed it in my book. There was no AC. We sat outside in 110 degree heat...not pleasant. The service was slow and just overall not impressed.   Even though I am not a breakfast guy if I am in that part of the town again looking for something to eat I am heading to LGO..."}
{"text":"This was my first time. I am here in Phoenix on business. Heard about this place and wanted to try. Ordered Chicken Fried Steak and eggs. First my eggs were perfect. Everywhere I go I order eggs over medium and very few restaurants get it right. The chicken fried steak was very tender. I felt like the steak could have been fried a bit longer. Not too crunchy. Hash brown were a bit dry but still good. The gravy was fantastic. The service was excellent. I watched the two guys who worked today and they were on it. If I go back (I may since I am here to the end of the week) I will try either the LocoMoco or their Wolf order or eggs benedict. Coffee was hot and nice. If I lived here I would be a regular. There are just a few things that they could do to get a four star from me. All in all, I still recommend it. The restaurant itself is nice and clean. I liked the openness and the airy feel to it."}
{"text":"Decent place. I'm guessing it's better to go during the week vs. the weekend as with most breakfast places, the service and quality go downhill during peak volumes. The menu is what pulled us in, as it really looked great. The  food on the visit was good but the service was not. What really did it in for me was when the bus staff removed my plate before I was done, as well has very aggressively cleared the table next to us that we couldn't hear ourselves think. Again, the food was good but not excellent and the service makes it less than desirable to want to return."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place.  Been here a couple times.  Great service, great food...and really, really good coffee. Every employee in the place seemed to be excited to be there.  Great  homemade jelly.  Breakfast burritos were tasty. My wife and daughter enjoyed the eggs benedict and my son has tried the pancakes and this time had the waffle.   All good food and can't beat the service"}
{"text":"The food at Over Easy is awesome.  We arrived about a minute after they were supposed to stop seating and they were very pleasant in letting us stay.  The hostess was super engaging and very open to letting us eat, all while advising us that they really were supposed to stop seating.   The server was very pleasant and warm, offering suggestions and never pushing us to leave.  (We did, however, leave when we became the last table in the restaurant.)  The chicken and waffles is amazing and the orange juice is delicious...brought in from local groves.  The atmosphere is charming and relaxed.  Expect a wait but the food is super worth it!"}
{"text":"This place is so quaint with a really modern vibe. I love the bright colors and all the breakfast essentials. My boyfriend got the chicken and waffles and it was so melt-in-your-mouth delicious. But I was almost jealous but I ordered the eggs Florentine I've never had a more perfectly poached egg. And on top of that the coffee was really tasty."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with some friends and we ordered bloody Mary's and there were lemons in them. The drinks were very lemon really and awful. I ordered Thanksgiving waffle and got zero turkey! We will not be back!"}
{"text":"had breakfast march 4 -20-11 it was fantastic. had a great waitress .       fantastic food   I had chicken fried steak it was fantastic. great waffles. and omlets"}
{"text":"The wolf  bacon egg was mostly soggy hash browns.. Very unappetizing. Not much taste.  Waitress indifferent to us being there at all. When it was time for our check, she could not get our charge card to go through yet when we used it at our next stop it was just fine.  Will never go back.  The pros: it is clean and new."}
{"text":"Of course I saw this place on DDD. I had high hopes. I had the Over Easy Iced coffee which was good. Then my eggs Benedict came. They weren't that great. The hollandaise was flavorless, and the English muffins were way bigger than the eggs. I was craving eggs Benedict and was very disappointed. My friends seemed to enjoy all the food they got. The only thing that I like besides the coffee were the waffle dogs. I'm only giving a 3 star since my friends had a better experience than I did. If I come back, I will definitely try something else."}
{"text":"My sister and I wanted to try a new place...walked in was not greeted at all the girl just stood there twirling her hair...we asked to sit inside and she just pointed to the small table at the front...we sat down...about three minutes later we get our water and 5 minutes go by our server comes up named Zachary giving us the menu and asked what we wanted to drink...sister orders an iced coffee and I asked for Apple juice, I asked for the large and it's this tiny cup for kids...he doesn't come back for about 15 minutes then asks us what we wanted I got the lemon ricotta pancakes and before I could finish ordering he turns to my sister and says what do you want...I my sister looked at him like seriously? So she ordered her food which was Multigrain pancakes with Reese and finished ordering mine since he completely ignored me after that...it took a good 25 minutes to get our food...the woman that brought it out was nice...but my sister was like you just put candy on top of the pancakes don't mix them in? And I've had lemon ricotta pancakes before this was yucky over lemon cardboard...the fruit was good which was the only edible thing on my plate. Our waiter comes back with our check and my sister asks nicely if he could split the check...he doesn't come back for almost 30 minutes helping everyone else...finally I said can we have our checks please and he turns around takes our cards with out even letting us see the bills in the first place and walks away comes back 10 minutes later hands us our stuff my sister was being nice and says hope you have a good day, he just ignored her...I saw this place on triple d and it's NOT what they say it is...wish it was a better experience but nothing won't ever make me come back to this place. :("}
{"text":"Very good place for breakfast. Lots of choices and some interesting options like chilaquiles.   Service is always friendly & fast.  It's a pretty small place, though,  so the wait can get a little bit long on the weekends."}
{"text":"Second time I have visited an Over Easy--first time was 6 years ago when the only location was a converted Taco Bell several miles north of the airport. Had the best and most perfect scrambled eggs in my life at that visit and told my server. It's easy to see why there are several locations now. I had a somewhat traditional breakfast with scrambled Eggs, potatoes, waffle and an English muffin. Again, everything was cooked perfectly and just super. The manager or owner stopped by and talked to us a bit, since it wasn't too busy--turned out he was a server in that original location. It's nice to know that their standards haven't slipped--if I lived out here, I'd be eating breakfast here at least once a week."}
{"text":"Grand opening today. Waited in line for the 6:30am opening and it was worth it. I got the breakfast sandwich with scrambled eggs, ham, and goat cheese which was delicious. Will definitely be returning to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite spots for breakfast in Gilbert. The service is always fast and friendly and its great for the kiddos. Our favorite is the Caramelized banana & pecan brioche French toast. IT IS BEYOND Delicious. They make they own jelly/jam and it is quite tasty. The Benedicts are yummy too! The music that they play is top notch and is a generally fun environment for all ages"}
{"text":"We received very poor service here.  We also used a Group-On type certificate (which, they only allowed people to use Monday through Thursday, which we think shows very poorly on their management ), and the waitress gave us attitude about using it.   Food was decent but nothing to write home about.  However, the attitude and quality of the service will not have us coming back."}
{"text":"The coffee was good. I had the two egg breakfast and asked for toast instead of bacon. I got bacon (and no toast) and reminded the server I asked for toast instead. I was almost done by the time I got my toast. The portions were small. Really small. The plates are smaller than average. (I am not one for huge portions, but c'mon, I have seen child's portions bigger than this!) The hashbrowns were unremarkable. The bacon had a smokey flavor that tasted like your clothes smell after being around a campfire. The eggs were ok. The meal barely filled me up. Maybe I got the wrong thing. Or maybe I am crazy to expect an $8 breakfast to be spectacular (or filling). When it is almost $40 for breakfast for three people it better be damn good. And this wasn't."}
{"text":"It's all because of Carlie that I am giving 5 stars.  Came here today to have breakfast with my family.  We are here from California to see my sister who is in the hospital recovering from being in a diabetic coma.  It's been very stressful over the last few days so to have a little break and spend time laughing was what our souls needed.  I must say that we had such a great time and our server Carlie was awesome.  So friendly and personable.  Kept the coffee and the smiles coming."}
{"text":"While visiting a friend in Phoenix during Thanksgiving week, my dining companion and I sought out Over Easy.  I love me my breakfasts and I've heard they are exceptionally good.  Note:  This was on a Tuesday.  I had the Chicken Fried Steak.  The breading was crispy and flavorful ... it tasted just like the well-seasoned breading on a piece of fried chicken.  On top of it was a dollop of white gravy.  I liked that it was not smothered in gravy as you see on so many chicken fried steaks you might get elsewhere.  And on top of that were my over-easy eggs, accompanied by the home fries on the side.  My dining companion had the Brioche French Toast with caramelized bananas.  It was good, but when he tasted my Chicken Fried steak, he ordered one for himself and we shared the remaining French Toast between us.  Now, this is where things get weird.  I was so enamored with the Chicken Fried Steak, we went back the next day (a Wednesday) and brought our host, a Phoenix resident, with us.  I ordered the Chicken Fried Steak again as did our host.  My companion tried the Fried Chicken & Waffles.  To my surprise and disappointment, this time the breading was not crisp at all.  It was kind of mushy.  And the flavor?  There was none.  It was bland and lacked seasoning.  It was like day and night.  However, in both instances, the service was friendly and prompt.    I'm still giving this place 4 stars based on my first experience.  I'm hoping that they just had a bad day on Wednesday."}
{"text":"Waitstaff very good and accommodating,coffee bitter had to return it.the meal was only ok for $5 but the price was $11."}
{"text":"So I was supposed to meet my mom, but ended up dining here solo. It was my first time and definitely will not be the last. Everything about this place was right. The atmosphere was inviting and relaxing, it was clean, and the service amazing! I wish I could remember my server, but I think it was Brian (having a Brain Fart) so forgive me if it was not. But he was awesome, kind, and made all the perfect recommendations! The food was also delicious, but I had a multigrain pancake topped with granola that was out of this world! It was my first time having to dine alone in a restaurant in years, so at first I was uncomfortable but as quickly as that feeling came it left. I definitely would recommend checking out this establishment!"}
{"text":"With limited, decent places for breakfast in the far East Valley, Over Easy is a keeper. I had the Mediterranean Omelet today; it was wonderful. My server, Matt, was very good...attentive without being overbearing. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"not worth the trip.  Food is average and overpriced"}
{"text":"I really, truly wanted to love this place!  I found it online for my husband's birthday breakfast.  He has been searching EVERYWHERE for a correctly cooked over easy egg - outside of MY kitchen of course ;)   It seemed charming, interesting and the menu was promising.    The food was just so-so, all of it.  Mostly because it was lukewarm and had a few no-no's.  The benedict was good except for the squishy English muffins that didn't seem toasted.  The hash browns were mushy and cold on both plates.  The strawberry waffle was also cold and had one brown strawberry.  My husband ordered over easy eggs which had raw egg white.  However the eggs were replaced at his request with a better set.  The coffee was really good and the service was as well.  I think the locals love this place, we barely beat the rush...  The food came out quickly, which may have been the problem.  It wasn't more than 5 minutes since we had ordered, and clearly wasn't enough time to cook it fresh or even keep it hot.    The worst part about all of it was that with some really easy and quick remedies this could have been an amazing breakfast, worth the price we paid.  A toasted muffin, a few more seconds on the heat, a berry tossed into the trash - voila, Saturday morning magic instead of Saturday morning tragic...  My husband is STILL searching for a restaurant that can cook an egg.... over easy."}
{"text":"When here today after Pat's Run for a hearty breakfast. There was about a 10 min wait so we decided to sit at the bar. Usually when you sit at the bar at a restaurant you get waited on pretty quickly. Not here! We waited about 10 minutes before somebody asked us if we wanted coffee or anything?? By that time we were already ready to order and we did and the food was really, really good! So the wait was worth it as far as the taste of the food goes - I will give you that. My son had the chicken and waffles and they were delicious. Then, we finished our meal and waited another 15 minutes or so while our waiter at the bar walked past us a few times to deal with other customers. Finally, I flagged down another waitress and asked her if we could just pay our bill so we can get going and she said she would take care of it. She gave us our bill we paid and she apologized and we took off. I guess the moral of the story is - great food, not so great service. If you've got a lot of time, go there! If not, maybe opt for some place with quicker service."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the food and atmosphere at Over Easy. I had a cup of coffee and the spinach benedict with hash browns. My hash browns were done perfectly, but one of my eggs was hard poached. I really look forward to breaking into a perfect runny poached egg yolk with my benedicts, and when I told Laura the problem, she was quick to ask the kitchen to poach me a new egg. The menu has a great variety of high-quality food."}
{"text":"Had the \"house made\" corned beef hash n eggs. Tastes like canned with some grilled onions. Our waitress was not nice at all. She didnt seem to want to be bothered with our order or grabbing us refills or anything. Not much of a wait, but you would think they were slammed.  Plenty of better places to go around here. Will not go back."}
{"text":"We went here because we saw the place on Diners Drive Ins and Dives and figured that if Guy liked it then we had to at least try it.  Good food and service. I had the chicken fried steak, which was great and a side of the Jalapeno Bisquit and Gravy, very tasty..The wife enjoyed her 2 egg/bacon breakfast except she was not impressed by the side of chocolate chip pancakes. Our son enjoyed his Wolf Pack meal.   We also went to their other location for breakfast on our 3rd monring and I dont know why but the food is much better here than it is at the other location. The hash browns tasted different and the gravy at the other location was terrible. I would have thought they would have some standards they would follow seeing how its the same establishment.  While the place is a little spendy, it was worth it, at least at this location. Will I go back when in Phoenix? You betcha!"}
{"text":"Very good daughter had the banana French toast and she said it was the best she ever had. Friendly staff would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Brunch after Easter Sunday! I really enjoyed the place here! Even the menu is designed very artistically! I ordered the Gary's Croatian Spinach Loaf with sweet potato tater tots on the side. I really enjoyed my entree! At first I thought the portions were small, however, it definitely filled me up! The loaf is dense with cheese, egg, spinach and more. It's tasty and one meal I would definitely order again! Lemonade is alright and the Over Easy Iced Coffee isn't as good as Starbucks. However, I really enjoyed the loaf and would order that again! =]"}
{"text":"A cute breakfast place to grab a quick bite. The menu was extensive. Including everything from chicken and waffles to your traditional breakfast. I personally enjoyed that they had condiments like apple butter. I would definitely try this place out if you are in need of a quick breakfast before your day's events."}
{"text":"Not a bad breakfast joint. Seats are REALLY close together so don't expect any privacy. I had the Wolf Pack which is two layers of hash browns with bacon and eggs in between. It was good and easily big enough for 2 or 3.  But my companion had biscuits and gravy, and it just looked and tasted blah. The sausage had no color--it was like it was boiled instead of cooked on a griddle. Cold brew coffee was WEAK."}
{"text":"I know this place had been featured on Diner's, Drive-Ins and Dives. I was more interested in it because I had heard vague rumors they may be opening up one in my neck of the woods and wanted to see if I could start building a relationship with another breakfast place.  Noon on a Monday found the place mostly empty, which caught me a little by surprise. With the whole Food Network exposure thing, I figured there would be a wait. I am sure there is at peak breakfast hours on weekends.  Breakfast is the only option here. It's our first meal of the day, so even though it's noon, breakfast is fine. They are only open until 1:00 so, breakfast only makes sense.  I probably should have listened to the server and ordered the DDD featured item, chicken fried steak. I, instead, opt for the Loco Moko, a Hawaiian staple, with two eggs on top of a hamburger patty on white rice, all covered with mushroom gravy and topped with \"crispy\" fried onions, which were kind of limp. My wife had the traditional eggs Benedict. Prices for our dishes were, I believe, $9.50 and $10 but I don't recall which was how much. When you consider I got eggs with plain white rice and a burger patty, two poor mans staples, the price tag seems a little steep,   Although the gravy on mine was tasty, neither dish really blew our socks off or stood out from any breakfast dish I've ever had. We actually had gone about half an hour out of our way to try this place. The breakup may not be complete yet. If the rumors are true and it's not clear across town I may give the chicken fried steak and/or waffle dogs a try. I might still find something to make me swoon."}
{"text":"This is an excellent place for amazing food in a fun atmosphere. If you go on a weekend before noon, expect to wait a bit, but once your seated you'll get you food fast. If your a penny counter you'll be turned off by price, but its fair and you will leave extremely full and satisfied and not bale to finish it all. The sweet stuff is sweet and the spices stuff is spicy, but that is what any logical person would think. The food is why you come so choose on of the items on the menu and enjoy. Excellent place to EAT.  My wife and i go her about every 2 weeks and we love it. Reading the other reviews i think some of these people don't understand what the place is. This is a diner style breakfast place. The tables are packed in and its a cozy place where you can easily see what your neighbor ordered. You come her for the food. Its a creative twist  and stepped up form traditional breakfast. the wolf pack is wonderful as is the waffle dogs. The omelets are huge and the french toast is amazing (although a bit sweet for my taste, have them leave the camel sauce on the side if you don't want desert for breakfast) . The prices appear to be a bit steep at first but the plates are huge so the price is fair. As for service, I've always had good service there but I'm expecting a diner. its not a white table cloth place so speed is on their mind and you appropriate that as breakfast food is never good cold.   Over all it a wonderful place with amazing food. well forth the hype."}
{"text":"My husband and I are new to the area and were super excited to try this place for breakfast since it is close to home. Upon arriving, we were escorted to a back room and seated at a table that faced a gray, beat-up wall. I assume this room is an overflow for when they are busy, but it is absolutely atrocious. It smelled like a sweaty locker room and the wall (our main view for the entire meal) had huge black scuffs all over it. The ambience and decor is nothing like the main eating area. Our service was awful and the meal was just okay. We also had a weird view into some of the service areas that typically are not seen by patrons. Not a good look!"}
{"text":"So glad this is close by! I have been here 3 times since it opened and have thoroughly enjoyed it each time. The food is delicious and the staff are so friendly. Dog friendly patio is a plus. Lemon ricotta pancakes are the best!!"}
{"text":"First off, let me say fantastic space, great patio, and I like the counter. They made great use of an old Taco Bell and parking is much better than Vig next door.  The owner was sitting next to us at the counter, or maybe the manager, but either way it made for a somewhat interesting meal. I was making observations to my mom, knowing the owner could hear me, with hopes that he might take note. First of all, the orange juice was not squeezed orange juice, but rather out of a bottle... thought you guys were trying to be an \"up market\" style place. The server then recommended the bacon saying it was the best in town and had an amazing flavor. Reall dude? really? I bought into your sales pitch, and thought nothing more of it than Denny's. My pancakes were great, and had no complaints there, but made the observation to mom, rather loudly, \"the fucking butter is hard, like a rock, I can't even use it!\" Owner didn't even look my way.   The kid who was the server behind the counter was also kind of a goon. I honestly believe they were on to something here, and ruined it with their management. The food is ok, the atmosphere is cool, but the service and attitude from everyone was lame.   I'll go back, if I'm starving and I'm in the neighborhood with no other options, but this is not a winner. I'll take Matt's, Pallatte, or even First Watch for that matter."}
{"text":"Pitiful, slow and they really need a name change. Shitty over cooked eggs. See pic. When letting waitress know that the second set of over medium were over cooked as well, she advised me that \"from restaurant to restaurant have different definitions of over medium\" WHAT??? To boot all this on a Monday morning with fewer than 10 people in there when our order was taken. Food took almost 30 minutes."}
{"text":"Had the country fried steak again.  Of course it was good.  Meat was tender and flavorful.  The only thing I didn't like the the coffee....It tasted really burnt.  I guess they're really going to that diner taste!"}
{"text":"Delicious and well-priced. Its easy to get very big portions for under $10/person. They aren't afraid of new things (like waffle dogs) and everything I've had is very good. Customers are serviced pretty frequently but left alone for most of the time. Great spot for a simple morning or brunch meal."}
{"text":"Cute restaurant and friendly staff, but...Cold coffee. $5.00 for a glass of orange juice. Eggs Benedict--skimpy on the hollandaise sauce but overly generous with the paprika. Asked for extra sauce on the side and it arrived covered in more paprika. Cut open the poached eggs to find solid yolks. Returned the entire breakfast. Ate a slice of my husband's cold toast and walked out hungry."}
{"text":"I approached this place with pessimism . Because how can we possibly have another breakfast joint in Downtown Tempe? Well, it is really good. I have a made to order sausage, peppers and cheese omelet with a side of bacon...frickin' awesome. My guest had Steak and Eggs....it was huge and also very good. I will be going back soon!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my first visit here - I'm guessing they listened to previous reviewers? \"The Wolfpack\" is a breakfast experience in itself - eggs, bacon, cheese in the middle of a mountain of perfectly crispy hash browns! The atmosphere is kind of retro-upscale and beats the HELL out of any chain joint. Hard to understand how people have rated this one star - even a Denny's would get better than that..."}
{"text":"The food was good but overpriced. We had the sirloin steak, corned beef, and pecan french toast. I felt like you could get the same quality of food for a lower price at most other breakfast places. I am not plannig on returning."}
{"text":"Terrible save your money. We order ala carte and I couldn't believe the food or the bill. We simply wanted 1 egg each over medium, ham for my friend, sausage for me, nicely browned hash brown, rye toast for me, english muffin for her. Tea for her, black decafe coffee for me.  The sausage and hash brown were not fit to eat so we didn't after the first bite; I mean both these were unbelievable terrible. The rye toast was over toasted and the English muffin was raw on one side. The coffee was stale.  The stupidity of how all this was served was insane.  We received everything on separate little plates, 1 little plate for the egg, 1 for the suasage, 1 for the ham...you get the picture.  There wasn't enough butter to butter the toast lightly.  And to top it off the restaurant has no atmosphere and the seating is uncomfortable.  You can imagine my surprise when I received the bill for almost $28.00 for this crap.  I did leave a $5.00 tip because none of this was the waitress's fault. The tea for a Earl Grey Tea bag, that my friend had to put in her cup of hot water, was $3.25 alone and she was not given a caddy or saucer for the bag after its use.  No we won't be going back.  The only thing good I can say about this restaurant is cute name for a breakfast restaurant.  If they can make such a simple breakfast terrible I would not want to try anything else. TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE..."}
{"text":"Meh. We had a Groupon and it sounded like a good idea. The chicken and waffles my partner had was less than stellar. My Chilaquiles wasn't that great, kind of bland tasting.   The service was great as was the Iced Tea. If we go back I would try something different, but as lackluster as the chicken and waffles looked I doubt we will."}
{"text":"I guess Over Easy is one of those places people either love or hate. Fortunately I love it. We decided to make the trek to Phoenix for breakfast recently and chose Over Easy because it is close to my office and I thought it looked cool when I'd driven by.  Located in remodeled Taco Bell it's a funky space with a diverse crowd. So un-Scottsdale. That's one of the things I love about Over Easy. The food is pretty darn good too.  Yes, I agree the food it a little on the high side, but for me it's worth it. I loved the French Toast with carmelized bananas.  Give Over Easy a try and let us know what YOU think!"}
{"text":"I've been here many times and I've truly never been disappointed in the food or service. This is my all time favorite breakfast spot. Casual and a fun place to meet friends."}
{"text":"Disappointed over lack of vegan options.. Oatmeal and tofu substitute for eggs would be nice. Many employees who were very busy not looking after restaurant clients. In other word, poor Memorial day service.  Maybe it's just the newness, but they need to get them act together."}
{"text":"I don't want to be mean, but this place should be called \"Over-rated.\" We waited an hour for what was a breakfast I could have done 100 times better at home. The food was SO BLAND and there was absolutely nothing special about it."}
{"text":"Had to try this spot after a recommendation from a close friend.  While the decor is alittle sparse, probably because it just opened, it had a very bright and cheerry feeling.  Just what you want first thing in the morning to get yourself moving.  Order the fresh squeezed orange juice, the Cheddar Jalapeno Biscuits and Sausage Gravy, and a side of Home Fries.  The orange juice was pretty good for bing fresh squeezed, the Home fries were cut a little thin for me, but the Cheddar Jalapeno Biscuits and Sausage Gravy was wonderful.  I usually , like my gravy thicker, but since this was made fresh, I understand why is wasn't as thick as I like.  But the flavors all worked wonderfully.  The wait staff was very attententive, even as the restaurant began to fill up.  I was told that the later in the morning it does get busy, so if I were you, I would try to get here early, even if the food is worth the wait."}
{"text":"Good and unique breakfast choices on menu ..Its usually crowded but its because its a popular place. Its very busy always but the food is great. Its worth the wait...I will return.."}
{"text":"I went here and got the chicken fried chicken and waffle wanting some good ole southern comfort food for breakfast. Boy was I shocked when a tiny, thin, breaded piece of chicken came on a over cooked flat waffle. I swear this was a large frozen chicken mcnugget on a plate.   The service was good and the decor was nice but this was easily the worst breakfast I have ever had at a restaurant. I will never go here again."}
{"text":"With a whole day of eating including a 26-course masterpiece at Binkley's behind me the second day of my trip to the Valley would be a clinic day...starting at 8:00...which of course meant a 10 mile run at 5:00am was not out of the question, nor was breakfast beforehand, in this case a place recently brought to national attention by (insert synonym for annoying) food personality Guy Fieri - Over Easy Café.  Not particularly a fan of Fieri but having found some of his recommendations to at least be interesting (and in the case of Rino's Place occasionally outstanding) the restaurant fit my time frame as well as location and as such I decided to give it a go.  Arriving shortly after the doors opened at 6:30 Over Easy Café was easily located via GPS and attached to the Phoenix Coyotes Ice Den practice facility I allocated parking quickly and after a quick browse of the rink I made my way into the café - a starkly decorated seemingly converted office space with a breakfast bar and Formica all around and with a few tables of patrons already seated I was greeted at the door with the suggestion to sit anywhere I like.  In this case electing for a two-top near the doors I took my seat where silverware wrapped in napkins along with the menu were already in place and grabbing a copy of the local paper I started to peruse the menu moments before service would arrive, a pleasant young lady named Samantha who appeared to be the only server working the room.  Clearly a place for regulars as nearly ever patron to enter after me was greeted by name Samantha welcomed me and filling my water asked if I'd like coffee while I perused the menu; an offer I gladly agreed to when I noted that they were serving the same locally roasted Café Cortez as the day prior at Morning Glory.    With my coffee being readied and having already perused the online menu I would be ready to order by the time Samantha returned and with the time just before 7:00 I opted for two dishes, both garnering a \"good choice,\" and sat back to read the paper and listen to the overhead radio while I waited perhaps fifteen minutes for my plates to arrive.  With service efficient and friendly throughout my stay and coffee maintained near full along with my water my two plates would arrive simultaneously and having heard some (Food Network) call Over Easy the best breakfast in the state while the posters on the walls hailed Fieri's commentary I started first with their signature item of Waffle Dogs, three chorizo spiced pork breakfast sausages on sticks dipped in the house waffle batter and fried to a golden brown and dusted with powdered sugar.  Warned that these were hot in temperature but mild in flavor Samantha suggested a combination of maple syrup (not authentic maple, mind you) and hot sauce as a condiment for this and first tasting the Dogs themselves and then with syrup and sauce I had to admit they were better dressed but not terribly impressive either way.  A bit spicy and a nice blend of sweet and savory the overall impression was that yes, this was kind of like a corndog, but without the cornbread and thus inferior.  Light and without oiliness the crispness was appreciated, but overall rather lacking for a \"signature\" dish.  Moving next to my second selection, the better of the two by some degree, a half order of Caramelized banana & pecan French toast was delivered - a dish that would clearly be tasty based simply on ingredients, but actually a nice preparation with the single slice of buttery brioche crisp on the exterior and custard like on the inside topped with fresh bananas, crunchy pecans, and a thick caramel sauce that tasted good on the toast and equally delicious spooned into my coffee.  Certainly not a breakfast for those lacking a sweet tooth one slice was definitely enough, especially after the waffle dogs.  With a coffee offered for the road and the clock just shy of 7:45 I accepted the to-go cup and after paying the admittedly modest tab plus tip made my way from the restaurant en route to clinic along with the newspaper housing and sports sections that I was encouraged to take along with me.   Overall a nice place with good service I cannot say I'd go out of my way for Over Easy, but considering its location I could certainly see it making a great breakfast spot after a morning skate - goodness knows it would have trumped the Denny's or Bob Evans I frequented after hockey as a lad."}
{"text":"Decided to try this since it wasn't too far away for us.  The service was a disappointment and the food was worst. Not planning on ever returning. Sticking with The Good Egg."}
{"text":"We frequent here for Saturday breakfast, and are rarely disappointed! On occasion the staff can be slow, but the manager is fantastic! He knows us now, and can practically put our order in when we walk in the door. :D My kids love their m&m pancakes. Husband loves the lox. I like my eggs over easy, and they do 'em right.   If you like crispy bacon, make sure you order it crispy!"}
{"text":"Prices at little high for what you get. We went for valentines brunch and the head waitress came off rude. And service wise like after you get your food is very rushed. They leave b4 your done speaking. Prolly won't come again. Only came cause it was a diners drive ins and dives show place. Food was from 1-10 like a 6 for us."}
{"text":"The original advacado toast is a must try.. a layer of ricotta, creamy advacado topped with perfectly ripened  tomatoes and a sprinkling of chili flakes."}
{"text":"Easily the best breakfast food ive ever eaten.  And i eat alot of breakfast. I ordered and sampled 5 items with a buddy. The \"waffle dogs\" are by far the best thing ive eaten ever. They were featured on food network like 10 times!! I now know why. Awesome place and friendly( if that matters) unreal food!  Nuff said would travel 2 hrs for there food."}
{"text":"Ate at the Ice Den location.  Ordered the signature \"Over Easy\" dish.   It really was flavorful and excellently prepared with toasted brioche, spinach, bacon, scallions and au jus topped with a fried egg.  The chef should have left the egg on the griddle a bit longer, per my order for no runny eggs, but otherwise, yummy!   Server started out a bit rough but got better as he warmed up.   Quiet Wednesday mid-morning, no wait and quick delivery of my entree.  Coffee only OK, a bit weak (typical for decaf but it doesn't have to be that way)."}
{"text":"So my layover in Phoenix was three hours long (turned into six but that's a whole 'nother story...) Anyways, my cousin goes to ASU, so I called her up and had her get me for breakfast since I had a ton of time to kill.  She takes me to this little tiny place called Over Easy. Yay, it looks cute. It also looks like (by looking at the building) it used to be a Taco Bell back in the day. Ah oh!  WHO KNEW THERE WAS GOOD FOOD IN ARIZONA!? I actually liked the 'Over Easy' entree that I got. Filled me up and while it wasn't gourmet or anything, it was the next best thing. Also, it's helpful to mention that there is nothing on the menu over 10.00 - nothing. All you ASU kids should eat here.  Finally, the crappy thing about running a business in the middle of an Arizona desert is that you're sometimes gonna get some Arizona desert clientele. Let me just say that the service is amazing. EVEN THOUGH there were some genuine straight from the trailer park douchebags in there. Had to say it. I love you Over Easy."}
{"text":"I really like the concept of this breakfast/brunch restuarant so I've been going back. I love their food and the attention that they give to their customers. My only complaint is they are, to me anyway, a little pricey but great for that occasional Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"I've come to this place enough to say I like most of their food. My boyfriend always get the Wolf Pack Club. Let me tell you, be prepared to eat A LOT! It could easily feed two people.  This time I tried their new Avocado Benedict. At first I thought it was going to be an avocado over kill but honestly, it wasn't too much. Second time around I got the chicken fried steak. It was just as good. I've almost tried everything on their menu. I haven't complained once."}
{"text":"We were looking for a new place for breakfast. Thought we would try over easy. My wife ordered the eggs benedict and I had the chicken fried steak. Her eggs we're almost Raw and mine had no taste whatsoever except for the salt and pepper I put on them. the steak was even worse! Within an hour I was violently ill and throwing up. My wife was also sick but not as violently as I was. The waitress was excellent and very attentive but we will never trust their food again !"}
{"text":"Casual little spot to eat breakfast while catching college football. We sat outside on the patio and enjoyed big mugs of coffee and some oj. I had 2 eggs over easy with biscuit and potatoes and bacon and he had an omelet. We were definitely stuffed and couldn't even finish our food."}
{"text":"Totally a safe place to take your Midwestern parents who think ketchup is too spicy. It Is cute clean and not weird or have any pretentious brunch-slinging waiters with arm sleeve tattoos. Go here if that is what you want.   Don't come here for breakfast burritos. Such a shame they use gringo tortillas when we live in Arizona. Also they put hash browns in them which gives a strange mouth-feel. Salsa is good though"}
{"text":"OverEasy Restaurant. I enjoyed the Bacon and Cheddar Burger, very tasty! Tater tots were fantastic! The decor of the restaurant was a little odd to me, very colorful. The banana french toast was delicious, but was served kind of mushy. The Roasted Mushroom Fricassee was amazing. If you like eggs for breakfast, this is definitely the place to go."}
{"text":"This place is ok. It's pretty small and they really crowd as many people in there as they possibly can which makes it a bit of a tight squeeze. It's pretty much diner food, but I had the blueberry pancakes and they were pretty good."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here to try a new place. We were very disappointed. The waitress done a good job but the food was atrocious.  I got the biscuits and gravy, it tasted like nothing but paste, water and flour. My wife got a omelet and the eggs were over cooked and the cheese was like rubber. I'm guessing it was imitation cheese. I cooked and managed restaurants for over 20 years and this one will never last unless they get knowledgeable on food preparation and presentation. Also the menu is not user friendly at all. Stay away from here unless you like throwing your money away."}
{"text":"First timer here but the staff was friendly and answered all of our question even though they were closing in 30 min they didnt make us feel rushed and we were able to take our time and enjoy our food."}
{"text":"What a great place to catch up with good friends.  Loved the atmosphere, and the food was good too.  Better if you have friends who will show up earlier than you do to get a table.  Best if you have friends who will pick up the whole tab.  I recommend the Chilaquiles and the 3 Eggs Steak/Chilli.  My wife doesn't recommend the Corned Beef Hash Plate.  Yeowch!  Merry Christmas everyone!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times enjoyed my food and service.  It seems the people most disappointed were the ones who saw the place on TV or had a coupon.  Maybe that's why I liked it so much.  Neither one of those applied to me so I wasn't expecting to be served golden eggs on a silver platter for half price.  I just expected a good breakfast and they delivered with great service both times.   I've had an omelet and the jalapeno cheddar biscuits and gravy.  Both very yummy.  The biscuits and gravy is a very large serving and I prefer mine with eggs.  It was waaaaaay too much food.  Both times I had the iced coffee and I thought it was great iced coffee.  To those comments about just asking for coffee and putting ice in it.... wouldn't that make an iced coffee?  If you want an iced latte or frappucino, you should go to Starbucks.  If you want an iced coffee, rather than hot, with your delicious breakfast, order the iced coffee at Over Easy.  I can't wait to try so many other things on the menu.  Like chicken and waffles, waffle dogs, brioche stack, or the chilaquiles.  I'm pretty certain I won't be disappointed by any of them."}
{"text":"Well. Poop.  I've gone to this location for years but haven't been in several months. This experience was not what I expected. The wait to get in was fine. We had to, but that's expected and we had no problem. Our order was taken quickly and drinks came out. My over easy iced was not as flavorful as in the past. Then our meal took almost an hour to come out. We were told sorry. I ordered the Florentine Benedict and it, too, was not nearly as flavorful as the past. Sloppy on the plate and thrown together. The sweet tots were good. We also ordered carmalized banana brioche French toast. From what I remember the portion looked much smaller, it looked like a half portion. We even asked. I am so sad, the food, experience and service was nothing like I remembered."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday morning for brunch. Pretty packed inside but only about a 10-minute wait.  I went with with the 2 egg bfast with hash browns, toast, and turkey bacon. Portions were pretty sizeable..I only finished about half of what was on my plate. It seemed like they used more than two eggs (maybe 4 or 5?) and the cheese that I requested to be added on was a solid amount of ooey-gooey goodness. Food arrived fresh and warm. Hash browns were just a bit dry but otherwise everything tasted fantastic.  My one drawback that dropped this spot down to 3 stars is the super slow service we experienced. Everything from getting the first cup of coffee, to the forgotten coffee creamer, to the 45-minute wait for eggs and subsequent delay for the check ended up turning a good meal to an overall lackluster experience."}
{"text":"Came here after looking up on yelp and was very disappointed. Very bland service that never asked how our food was etc (Meredith). And the coffee was absolutely disgusting and burnt tasting with a few different taste tests to confirm it wasn't just me. Everyone got the Selena breakfast burrito and there was not much flavor. My boyfriend got bacon as his meat and you couldn't find any bacon in the entire thing. Pick de gallo was dried out and the cup of fruit was wilted and not fresh either. Not impressed."}
{"text":"Nice little breakfast spot. You really need to have the signature dishes to make it something special (I didn't given they are just too indulgent thus the 3 stars). I did try the waffle sausages which are a must have."}
{"text":"Food is ok but they keep selling groupons and then have 1000 restrictions so you can never use them. Not very honorable"}
{"text":"We have been going to Over Easy for several years, first at the North Scottsdale location and now that we live in Gilbert, this location. I was initially concerned about the B health rating that they received but i knew that we had been before and the food was OK. This time just left me feeling ripped off, I usually order the Loko Moko which I did again and for a whopping $10 i got a teeny tiny bit of rice a hamburger patty that was in no way fresh (It was one of those pre-formed frozen types) two eggs (which were good) and cold mushy fried onions. The wife ordered the wolfpack which can piled high with mushy hash browns that were more steamed than anything and yet they weren't even hot enough to melt the cheese underneath. Nothing about this place is fresh, in the past it was they actually made fresh but now it seems that they are trying to pass off low quality ingredients as fresh.  Needless to say I will be taking my money elsewhere, Over Easy has lost a long time customer because the only thing they are consistent with is getting it wrong."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast on Saturday at 9am. No wait. Food was delicious and the service was fast and friendly. Had the \"Wolfpack\" which was great. They have your regular breakfast type items, and some unique choices that you just don't find everywhere. I highly recommend this place as well as their location in Phoenix. YUM!!!"}
{"text":"I really hate to update a review and have it be not as good as a previous one, but unfortunately the last couple of visits here just haven't mirrored my original experience.   The service has still always been friendly, but the food just hasn't been as great. I'm not sure if maybe it was the items ordered that stuck out so great the first time or if we just came on a really good day.   Since the first visit, I've returned to try other menu items. The chilaquiles, sweet potato tots, and second round of chicken and waffles didn't go as well. The chilaquiles have decent flavor but even just by the time they were delivered to me, they were pretty soggy.   The sweet potato tots were okay, but still nothing special. They weren't as crispy as I would have liked.  The chicken with the chicken and waffles is still excellent, but the waffle was a bit soggy this time around.   Overall it's still a decent breakfast spot, it just hasn't replicated the great experience we received the first time we came in. I wish them well though, lots of potential!"}
{"text":"I got the chicken and waffles and it was so bland. I would say I just ate the color brown. My sister got eggs benedict and the eggs were overcooked...basically a weird hard boiled egg.   The service was not very good either. Everyone seemed like they didn't want to be there at all. Our food took almost a half hour and no one seemed to care. The place was really dark inside as well, which is weird since its a breakfast place."}
{"text":"Was grabbin a bite to eat with a buddy of mine and he recommended this place. I didnt have high hopes cause he kinda sucks when it comes to food. We were able to get a seat right when we arrived. They dont really clean up well since there was maple syrup all over my side of the table. They were busy and i was hungry. I looked around to see what everyone else was eating, and everything looked damn good. While i was trying to make a choice of what i wanted, one of the people at the table next to me got a mexican dish with chips and sauce all over it with eggs on top. It looked awesome and I had to get it. I also tried their Over easy coffee i think its called. It wasnt that great at all, nothing special in my mind. I got my mexican breakfast and it exceeded my expectations.  Service was good, food was great, i cant wait to go back and try everything else on their menu."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and large portions too, it was great besides the way they were made. The jalapeño cheddar biscuits and gravy tasted like cheddar cheese, no spicy taste in there at all. It's almost like they forgot the jalapeños or something. My over hard eggs were also not cooked all the way through, but that's okay, the wild mushrooms were amazing.  Unfortunately, it was really cramped in there, I couldn't carry on a conversation over the noise and the very loud lady next to me. Server was nice and consistently checked to make sure we were enjoying the meal. The only thing that ran up the bill was our freshly squeezed 6$ orange juice."}
{"text":"Was very disappointed with this place! I had to send both meals I ordered back. The over easy entree was a soggy mess, brioche was totally soaked and no flavor. Hash brown were served raw with not even a hint of brown. 2nd meal I ordered was the chicken fried steak with eggs cooked medium. The eggs were prepared over easy and had to add lots of hot sauce for flavor. My boyfriend ordered the country Benedict. The biscuits were undercooked and eggs were over easy not medium. We had to ask for sliver ware. The coffee was the only good part of the experience. So either the cooks were having a bad day or they only serve their eggs over easy."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best breakfast I have had in awhile!! Everything is homemade the even serve real maple syrup!! My husband said itis the best corned beef hash homemade too!!"}
{"text":"My friends and I went to Over Easy for breakfast on Sunday. We had a friendly greeting and a brief wait. The majority of their restaurant is an enclosed outdoor patio. They had fans blasting, but we were in the mood for A/C so we sat inside. The waitress told us they are moving down the street in September so they'll have added space and a lunch menu.   Our table got the half order of the caramel banana french toast as an appetizer - appetizers at breakfast? Why not? The dish was delicious! I couldn't have eaten a whole plate, but sharing it was perfect. The nuts, banana and caramel toppings were a great combo to top nice, thick slices of french toast.   I ordered The Dolly sandwich - It was pretty basic (English muffin sandwich with scrambled egg, cheddar cheese, bacon, and tomato). I was in a simple mood, but I was a worried I'd pretty much just ordered an Egg McMuffin. It was definitely not a McMuffin. The english muffin was crispy, the eggs were fluffy, real melted cheddar cheese, and the bacon was crispy just as I requested. I got a side of sweet potato tater tots - why haven't I ever seen these before? What a great concept!     When in the area, I'd definitely have breakfast here again."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious breakfast. Not fussy, just well prepared and interesting breakfast dishes. Super nice staff!"}
{"text":"Let's face it, breakfast is pretty simple. Eggs, pancakes, bacon and all of the usual fare. It takes a little something special to make a breakfast place stand out. Let's start with the Banana Nut French Toast. Superb buttery brioche, cooked to perfection then topped with caramel, pecans and bananas. Surprisingly it was not too sweet. Then there's the Ham steak with the red eye gravy. Now, my wife is a ham freak! The only complaint she had was that the ham steak was too Costco-ish. A nice piece of real smoked ham would have made the dish a lot better. The red-eye gravy makes an average slice of ham into a meal worth coming back for."}
{"text":"The Brioche French Toast was one of the nastiest things I've ever eaten.  I was not going to wait in line at the CenPho location so we made a trip to the lesser known newer one for our first Over Easy experience.  I'm quite a fan of French Toast and I'm always on the lookout for the perfect french toast.  This was not it.  Not only did the filling turn the center of the toast into a giant tapioca-looking mushfest but the batter that coats the french toast does NOTHING to give it flavor.  It's called vanilla people, a big bottle at costco is only $4.  Use it.  What a disgusting mess.  I tried putting the syrup on it.  Of course, it didn't come with \"REAL MAPLE SYRUP\" but I was welcome to use the catsup bottle at the table that had been filled with the thinnest, corn-syrup based syrup known to man.  At least my meal had some flavor after that.  This will be my one and only trip to any Over Easy (or other Aaron May restaurant).  What a joke."}
{"text":"I'm surprised at some of the bad reviews I've seen for Over Easy.  The food here was fantastic!  We're only visiting Phoenix for a week and we've already eaten there twice and plan to one more time.  What really makes them stand out is the attention and care they put into the food.  Every dish seems to have just a hint of extra spice or subtle flavor that elevates it above standard breakfast fare.  This is not just grub thrown together.  We've found it to be not just one of the best breakfasts we've ver had, but a great meal, period. Freshly made corned beef hash that has the look and texture of canned, but with a phenomenally fresh taste and a smokey sweetness that is amazing.  Malt waffles that are delicately crisp but have a nutty subtext that will astound.  The best, and I mean BEST chicken-fried steak I've ever had, and I love CFS.  Again, it's the care.  Crisp and fresh batter that has the texture and flavor of great fried chicken.  A wonderful sauce that has a spice you can't quite place but makes it unique.   Only beef:  The pastries (we tried the blueberry muffins and the cinnamon roll) are obviously brought in and were waaaaaay overpriced and nowhere near up to the standards of the rest of the food.  Avoid the baked stuff. Next trip it's the biscuits and gravy...can't WAIT!"}
{"text":"I'm from out of state and my daughter recommended this. I got the order to go and it didn't take long to receive my order at all. The food is delicious! I ordered chicken fried steak with scrambled eggs, the Over easy, waffles on a stick and waffle dogs. I recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Great service, great food! I had the Wolfpack, while everyone else had the malted waffle. Advantage is to get there early, I think. We arrived at 7:15 after picking up the folks on a layover flight this morning. There were two others in the restaurant before us. Don't know if this made the difference, but it's something to consider. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I've really been wanting to try this place and it did not disappoint! Had the chicken fried steak with home fries and it was delicious!  Also had to try the mimosas since that's my breakfast drink of choice, I had the cherry mimosa and the pomegranate and both were quite possibly the best mimosas I've ever had! Will definitely be a staple any time we're in Arizona!"}
{"text":"Amazing food!! Jeff took great care of us. The food portions are more than enough and great taste.  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"0 , did i say zero, for stars, we sat down and got menues, that's it,  4 tables taken, 3 servers. And we waited and waited to be served.  Hostess never asked if we wanted any thing to drink, she was more concerned to clean tables ,  after 10 minutes we left!"}
{"text":"Very, very expensive for what you get.  Music is loud.  It is nothing that is suitable for families.  Mixed drinks are served for breakfast.  Went here once before and did not like it-- went back today and realized I did not make a mistake the first time."}
{"text":"You know you're not at the 40th Street Cafe when the menu includes an \"as seen on tv\" section. You'll see the waffle dog and all the other Over Easy favorites. This location is conveniently located at Tatum & Shea and has a bar and a small dog friendly patio.   The restaurant is a victim of expectations, due to the aforementioned television section on the menu. We've visited twice, however, and have enjoyed everything we ordered. That said, basic customer service was uneven on both occasions, with issues even getting coffee and water refilled, a major sin for a breakfast joint. Servers were not particularly friendly, another sin. Pricing is not unreasonable, but is on the expensive side for breakfast.  The kids menu is a major plus. It contains a variety of $6 items ranging from malted waffles to grilled cheese, drink included. The Wikki Stix activity is guaranteed to be a hit with your kids.   All said, I would rather drive down Shea and visit the \"Chopped\" winning Joy Bus Diner or up 40th Street to the classic 40th Street Cafe, but Over Easy is good for a change of pace."}
{"text":"Went back to Over Easy yesterday for breakfast and it was just as good as I remembered.  The line wasn't very long as it was almost noon on a Saturday which I guess was more brunch but whatever I just woke up lol.  So I got my favorite which is waffle dogs and they were just as great as always.  There is a reason these were on best I ever ate.  The mix of waffle, breakfast sausage, syrup, and cholula just go so well together.  You would never look at those items and mix them but when you try it you will be hooked just like I am."}
{"text":"Went to the Phoenix location YEARS ago and decided to finally try the only close to our house. Place was probably half, less than half full. Which seemed nice since it was Sunday morning and every where you go has a wait.  Husband ordered the banana but French toast. We were surprised how bland and not sweet it was. I ordered the Chilaquiles. They were just okay. The chicken had that precooked leftover chicken flavor. I know most restaurants prep cook some things in advance. Like maybe if the chicken was precooked in the ranchero sauce, that would have been good. But it had its own individual blandness to it. They prob use the same chicken in other dishes. But I don't know. Scrambled eggs were way over cooked. They were super rubbery  We had the waffle dogs. They were too porky. But ok.  Service was good. But yeah maybe I'm just picky. But it was just overall okay."}
{"text":"Over Easy gets a 3 for the food and a 4 for the overall experience. This place is just a couple blocks from my house so we walked there on Saturday morning. The interior is pretty cute and I love the setup. We didn't even have to wait for a table. I got the standard Pancakes, Bacon, Eggs and OJ. The OJ and Bacon were good, but the eggs were a little off and the pancakes were pretty bad actually. Very dry and the syrup was not all that great. I definitely liked being here though, so next time I'll try the french toast. My husband had the waffle dogs (breakfast sausage wrapped in a waffle) and he LOVED them. We'll definitely be back and hopefully the french toast will be better than the pancakes."}
{"text":"Came to over easy to try something different, sat down on the porch with my two 10lb dogs and was reviewing the menu. A large waitress came up to me and snarled \"we don't have a dog friendly patio, are they service dogs?\" Which I politely replied \"No\" and left lol. Every other breakfast place in North Scottsdale is pet friendly, I guess it is their choice to refuse service to anyone, but to be rude about the dogs and not even politely explain to me their policy is rediculous. They should at least have a sign near the trail that leads up to the patio that says we are the only restaurant in town that hates your tiny dogs lol. I have eaten here before on occasion and the food has been going down hill for a while anyways. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. You can go to Kierland commons and eat at snooze which is way better food and they love dogs, shit I would rather eat at good egg."}
{"text":"This place impressed me. Even though I just ordered bacon, eggs, hash browns and toast.  Bacon was really good This is perhaps the first breakfast place I've ever been to where they don't pre-butter your toast. And they don't have one of those pre- packaged jelly organizers on the table.  A slight reduction for cold toast, so the butter didn't melt. But the blueberry jam was very good"}
{"text":"I ate here a couple of days ago. I should have written down what i had - but I didn't. It was called something spinach loaf . . . or maybe something something spinach loaf. I love spinach and wanted something at least somewhat healthy (and delicious) that wasn't easily 1,000 calories. Eh - not so successful. It was a sort of quiche - with a lot in it - had a crust. The flavors were good, BUT it was incredibly salty. Not inedible, but, for me, if the primary taste is salt, that isn't good.   Service was indifferent. She took my order, delivered my order (did ask me if I wanted hot sauce), dropped off the check and picked up my cash and that was IT. I wasn't ignored, but certainly I didn't feel very welcome. It wasn't busy there - it wouldn't have killed her to ask me how my breakfast was.   The small fruit salad side was excellent - more than just melon and grapes - included pineapple plus. All of the fruit was an extremely acceptable state of ripeness. (I'm sick of not at all ripe melon and grapes that most restaurants seem to think is acceptable.)  The price was $10 plus tax. If it was salted properly - I think I would have been pretty happy - the flavors would have come through properly. As it was, between too much salt, no wifi and indifferent service - I may go back, but probably not."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place and very disappointed! It is a breakfast place so to overcook eggs is terrible! I ordered the chicken fried steak it was not seasoned and chewy. Service was slow and disorganized and it was not busy at all."}
{"text":"I take my grandmother here after church from time to time. The food is good I get the wolf pack and the eggs were a perfect over medium. However she gets the the standard 2 eggs and sausage toast is...well burnt.  The real problem when it is busy, is the service. It's frustrating to watch a waitress helps 3 other tables that arrived after we did before we can even get a drink order, then the look of annoyance on their face when you ask for something like pepper because it was split to another table is"}
{"text":"Small diner type place but good quality food. I've had a breakfast burrito and biscuits and gravy. Both had good flavor and you can tell are made with quality product. They do serve Mimosas and bloody Mary's. This place has been on a few shows on food network and for good reason. Service wasn't the best I've ever had but it was decent. It was pretty quite when we were there so I don't think there was any reason not to have superb service."}
{"text":"Disappointed....nice cozy place, super friendly service..i got Eggs Benedict..sauce had a nice bite, but the not so toasted muffin made for a mushy experience..home fries were not cooked as much as i'd like...c'mon...brown those babies ! my bud said the monster mound of blueberry pancakes were an adequate vague memory. Not inexpensive..local ma & pa places are a lot cheaper, with better specials..  oh yeah,,,first cup of coffee was good..the refill had an odd berry taste \"peaberry\" possibly.. bleech  most likely wont be back soon  i'll try Mikes on Main"}
{"text":"The place is terrible. I don't understand why it is so crowded. The pancakes tasted like they came out of a box. My son's tatter tots were reheated frozen ones you can buy in a store. The granola tasted and looked like it came from Safeway next door. Save your money. You can make a better breakfast at home."}
{"text":"It's been 4 days since my visit to Over Easy and I'm still trying to figure out why only half of this restaurant is indoors (w/ A/C). Are people here really that accustomed to eating breakfast outdoors in a patio at 9am in 90+ degree heat? Interesting.  So I thought maybe the food was just so good that the heat didn't even phase you. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case.    I ordered the Caramelized banana and pecan brioche French toast (since that's what I saw on Triple D), and I thought it was just okay - no WOW-factor. My friend ordered the chicken fried steak (again, shown on DDD), and it definitely didn't taste as good as it looked. The gravy was good, but the steak itself was tough. My other friend had the best dish, The Over Easy - toasted brioche w/ spinach, egg, bacon (good bacon), and scallions. It was flavorful and fresh-tasting.  Though the food wasn't bad, it wasn't great either. I had intended on going to Matt's Big Breakfast but chose Over Easy at the last second. I later found out the wait at Matt's can be hours long. That has to say something.  The lesson here? Always trust your gut instinct!"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant because I saw it on Triple D!! The place is small. Really small. Most of the seating is outside. I had the over easy and it was ok. There was just too much spinach. It overpowered the taste of the rest of it. I tried the house made protein bar and that was a little soft but good. My son had the wolfpack and loved it except that he had asked for extra crispy hash browns and they weren't.  Our biggest complaint was that the food was cold. In a place so small there really is no excuse unless it was just sitting there....."}
{"text":"When we got here it wasn't too busy, weren't visited for a solid 5 minutes. Our waitress, Julia wasn't the most friendliest (not rude just not very cheery like everyone else there).  We were ready to order as soon as she came back with drinks. Ordered waffles and chiliqulies-wait time wasn't long and the food was really good. Julia didn't even bring us the food, which I get is the norm if the server is busy but we weren't given any time to ask for condiments. Luckily Julia caught on to my aimlessly looking around and brought stuff. But after that, she was nowhere to be seen. I annoyed my neighbors by swishing my empty cup of ice around in hopes somebody would stop and ask if we needed more beverages. The prices were high, the food was alright, my service experience will probably be what deters me from visiting again."}
{"text":"Big letdown. My husband and I came here with friends a few years back, and the food was mediocre at best. I didn't write my review then but it would've probably been a 3 star review, maximum.  Last month, we originally planned on going over to Central Bistro for brunch but it was Labor Day and they were closed. We called Over Easy and they were open, with little to no wait! We drove over and they had a \"Please Seat Yourselves\" sign at the front. There was another group of two waiting ahead of us. It took about ten minutes before we got seated, which was fine. We had a chance to figure out what we wanted to eat so when our server came by, we were ready to order. I ordered a breakfast burrito (potato, egg, cheese and some veggies) and my husband ordered a malted waffle. During the 45 minutes we waited for our food, we saw someone send back their food twice, another group waiting for their food (when it did end up coming, only half of their food came) for as long as us, and little to no food coming out of the kitchen. The busser was working his tail off and you could tell the servers were super busy, but we still waited almost an entire hour for a burrito and a waffle. Our server popped by twice to tell us our food was almost out but we still waited 10-15 minutes after it. She did thank us for our patience, which I appreciated, but if I hadn't been so hungry I would not have waited that long.  When our food finally came, my husband's waffle was ice cold. My burrito was obviously microwaved (the tortilla was hot and the eggs were steamy and almost watery) and was missing the potatoes. Our server asked us how everything was and we did let her know the waffle was cold - she offered to reheat it for us but again, we were starving and just wanted to eat.  I know this place has been on Diners, Drive Ins & Dives and usually those places are pretty delicious. I don't know if it's just gone downhill in the past few years, but with all the awesome brunch options out in our neighborhood (with more opening up) like Postino, Central Bistro, and Snooze, we won't be back to Over Easy."}
{"text":"First time here. Really like the open and fresh feel of the place!!! Yummy Bellini to be had!!!! Had eggs Benedict with jalapeño English muffin and hubby had chicken fried steak. Super tasty!!!   Server was really knowledgeable about all the items on the me u and was able to give great recommendations base in my vague explanation if wants. I would totally recommend this place."}
{"text":"Perfect spot for a hangover... as long as you don't need food ASAP. A tiny restaurant (it used to be a Taco Bell), there is usually a hefty wait. The food is your typical greasy breakfast fare... pancakes, eggs and omlets but it's always good. Nothing great or 5-star worthy, but good. Big portions and some man-friendly creations such as the Wolf Pack which my husband loves. Not gonna lie, the Steak & Eggs looks pretty tasty."}
{"text":"We had breakfast here this morning. First time to this location.  The menu is a little limited for my taste.  Keri waited on us. I asked for her suggestions.  We took them both.  My friend loved the breakfast burrito and I had the eggs Benedict.  The coffee was very strong but good.  Keri was charming, food was great.  We will be back.  Dawn  Scottsdale"}
{"text":"We love the other Over Easy location and were expecting the same great food and excellent service here. Unfortunately we were very disappointed.  After we walked in, it took more than 10 minutes for the server to even notice us, and the speed of service didn't improve from there. Margie seemed distracted with her phone and with gossiping with other employees and customers the entire time we were there. Since we had plans after breakfast, we had a schedule to keep, and the slow service forced us to rush through our meal when it finally came.  The food was fine, although I got strange looks when I requested butter for my dry waffles. Not great like we had come to expect from our experiences at the other Over Easy, but it was acceptable. We won't be going back to this place."}
{"text":"This is an excellent breakfast place!  The portions are large and the price is very reasonable.  Eggs and other choices are cooked just as you order them (no hard yolks in an over-medium egg).  Service was not only excellent, but friendly!  I highly recommend this spot for both business and family breakfast!"}
{"text":"Food was great.   Super super fast service.   Small location but we didn't have to wait long.  Egg white and asparagus omelet wonderful.    Watch out they charge 1.50 for salsa.  We got the catsup for free."}
{"text":"Great food and decent prices, but small portions so it's a little pricier. Gave it a three because I like good breakfast places that give you a good amount of food for decent price... Not this place. However, the food is very good!"}
{"text":"I really do just love this place...from the very first time I set foot. Unfortunately, the first time I came here, my friend and I waited for about 2 hours, but it was well worth it. I came here after watching Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives and knew I was going to order the caramelized banana and pecan brioche French toast. How was it? Ummm...absolutely divine!!! The second time I came here, (LoL) I decided I didn't want to wait and I arrived at 6:40am. Yup, I learned my lesson the first time. FYI: These days were during the weekend...so they have a tendency to be more crowded. I recently went back here to bring some friends for breakfast and as always the food was great. We got everything that was featured from Food Network. =o) I wasn't too sure about the waffle dogs after watching it from Best Thing I Ever Ate because it's just a sausage in waffle batter...that you can really compare to a corn dog. I was completely wrong! The waffle dogs were so perfect! The ratio of sausage to batter was great! It was just so tasty! To be perfectly honest, we ended up having to get another order after devouring our other plates. It's a definite MUST-TRY! The dipping sauce totally caught me off guard...I think I was just expecting something sweet, but boy was I in for a little shock! It's actually a mix of Cholula Hot Sauce and maple syrup. The after shock of something spicy was a little weird, but dip the waffle dog into the sauce and it's a perfect combination! I find myself just thinking about these waffle dogs and how easy it would be to just eat them as I drive to work. *drool* The next time I come, I might just have to order 2 or 3 orders just for me (I don't want to share). LoL!"}
{"text":"I love it here. Everything I've ever gotten was delish. The food comes out fast and the people are super friendly. Only reason I gave 4 stars is because the parking is horrendous because it's near ice den."}
{"text":"Met a friend for breakfast. Amy was our server. She was awesome. The food could have been better. Starting with the blueberry muffin. Well, muffins, because you get 3 mini's plus a small container of lemon curd (the best lemon curd around BY FAR). The muffins we guessed were a day old because of how dry they were. We sent one order back. My friend had the Wolfpack which he said was made with bagged hashbrowns, not fresh. Disappointed. I ordered the Chilaquiles, eggs over-easy. The menu says one egg but mine was served with 2. The eggs were cooked correctly but the cheddar cheese was only partially melted. The dish could be improved on in many ways. Serve the ranchero sauce on the side so the tortillas stay crispy (personal preference). Add raw onions and Avacado slices. Use chopped or shredded roasted chicken instead of the little pieces of dry, cubed chicken. Finally, liven up the sour cream with some lime. Just some thoughts. Either make this dish the Over Easy version of really good roasted chicken breakfast nachos OR a dry tortilla soup. Regardless, it needs to be something better than it is now. In fact, our whole meal needed to be better. (Except the lemon curd)"}
{"text":"Convenient location to my office in NoSco. I've been meaning to try this place based on DDD, Best Thing, and I believe a \"Best Of\" nod in the Republic. I'm a huge fan of breakfast - even on my lunch break!  The location was quite small - much smaller than I envisioned. It was clean, bright, welcoming and there was a nice patio that I wouldn't mind trying out in the fall.  The waitress was at my table within a couple of minutes so +1 there.  The music was a little loud and people seemed to be striving to talk over it; the bartender (?) sang along with a song or two which made it even louder. At least she had a good voice. But for those of us who cherish a good book, it was not conducive to that type of relaxation.  I ordered the traditional (\"Trad\") benedict. I asked for the eggs to be poached medium well; not a huge fan of the runny egg, but still a huge fan of the benedict. Over Easy nailed it on cooking the egg, so another +1.  There was a scant smattering of Hollandaise on the plate - barely enough to cover each benedict. Mind you, I don't like my bene's drowned in Hollandaise - I know what the stuff is made out of - but there was really not enough there to judge how good it was. As we all know - the sauce makes or breaks a benedict. Since there was so little there, it broke it - regardless of how well the egg was cooked to my specifications.  The hash browns were disappointing. Nothing inherently \"wrong\" with them, but nothing right either. They were barely browned and only my own addition of a touch of salt and a lot of pepper gave them any flavor.   In and out of there in a great amount of time so you know they understand and appreciate the business luncher. Thanks OE for that."}
{"text":"This use to be one of my favorite breakfast/brunch spots....but no longer!  Each visit started going downhill. The new location lacks the neighborhood feel.  My last visit, on Father's Day 2011, was less than impressive. It was busy, but no busier than any other weekend morning.  Hostess - seemed new and unfamiliar: told us our wait was 20 mins max; we ended up waiting over 45 mins Not to mention you wait outside with no misters, water or coffee. Uncomfortable!  Server - unattentive: she did not write down our order, which could be quite impressive...if she remembered the order correctly. I ordered the waffle dogs with a side of bacon. What came out was a waffle with bacon. Ummm...no thanks, not what I ordered. No apology or any course of making it better while I waited. Instead my guest ate his Wolfpack since it would have gotten cold otherwise.  Our coffee and water went empty without refills. In fact, I flagged down another server and asked for refills.  Manager - lip service but never asked how our meal was, if everything was ok...just talked in baby talk to my 10 mo old son.  Overall...NOT IMPRESSED and not going back. This, is OFF MY BREAKFAST LIST FOREVER."}
{"text":"went here with the bf after he heard it was on diners drive ins and dives. The food was blah and the place was super crowded. I was almost touching the people next to me it was awkward. I won't go back there. I can't get over how flavorless the food was it was like eating a bowl of tissues."}
{"text":"I love this place. I go a few times a month. English muffins are home made by a local bakery and their pancakes with walnuts and bananas are so yummy"}
{"text":"love this place, but please, turn down the music."}
{"text":"OverEasy has a fresh menu.  You can tell the food is freshly made, no hash browns stored overnight, etc.  Portion size tends to be on the large size.  Price is reasonable for the food and service.  My only complaint is that the outdoor seating is not inviting at all.  It is sitting in a parking lot.  The only barrier is a wrought iron gate.  A few strategically placed plants and umbrellas might go a long way here."}
{"text":"Great service, clean and tasty food options.  This is my second time eating here. I tend to come for lunch on a weekday. They are always willing to accomodate my dietary requests. For instance, today I ordered the avocado benedict, and requested scrambled eggs rather than the menu suggestion. It was effortless to get what I want...best part. Reasonable pricing also."}
{"text":"Oh man...where do I start? This had to be the worst dining experience of my life. We show up and it's a 25-minute wait for two. Okay, that's normal. But wait, you have to stand outside, and it was 109 degrees today. They had a canopy set up, gee thanks! But how about a glass of water while I wait? Not here! I'm so glad I had a little bit of iced tea left in my cup from AJ's this morning.  So we get seated; get this, outside under an enclosed wooden canopy! Who does that to their patrons in Phoenix in the summer? They had misters, but they were nowhere near us. They had a fan mounted on the patio roof, but it blew right over the top of us and did no good. I think they sell portable evaporative coolers at Home Depot. That would have been nice!  So I'm looking at the menu and trying to decide what I want to eat when I see the waitress bring out an order to a table near us. I'm a bacon freak and I love it extra crispy. The order she brought out had bacon and it was cooked to perfection! Things were starting to look up. When she set the small plate down in front of the little girl, I didn't think anything of it. It was an adequate portion...for a nine year old.  We'll return to this in a moment.   So the waitress takes our order and I excuse myself to use the washroom and wash my hands. So I ask where the washroom is, thinking it's inside. I was politely told it was located in the back...As in, go outside, around the back, and there you'll see them. As I walk around the corner, I suddenly feel as if I'm entering a washroom at a grungy service station. The washrooms weren't clean, weren't air conditioned, and the urinal didn't flush. Can you see where this is going?  So back to my seat, our order arrives, and guess what, it's the same size as what I had earlier thought was a kid's portion.  I'm so glad it was hot and I wasn't super hungry.  So how was the food? Well, the eggs were runny, the hash browns were completely overdone on the outside, but still raw on the inside, and the bacon...well, let's just say that a couple of Band-Aids and that pig would be out wallerin' around in the mud again.  I'll admit. I should have done a little research on my part before eating here, but I seriously doubt I'll go back. At least Denny's is consistent and has clean bathrooms.  I'll give the place one star because at least they had two cool photos of Marilyn Monroe in the Men's Room."}
{"text":"Cute little breakfast joint in the strip mall off of Indian School road. Pretty typical breakfast options as well as some heartier options to get you going for the day! Very friendly staff, clean and well done."}
{"text":"Didn't even make it to ordering food! Horribly dirty inside and incredibly rude! I walked up the from door pushing a stroller and thought.... Hmm maybe one of the employees not helping anyone just standing there will open the door.... Yea Nope! They stood there watching while I completely struggled. They continued to ignore me when I fully entered the restaurant! I had to ask... Hey where can I sit? The pointed! Yep! You read that correctly, pointed over to the wall area?!? What ever. I walked over to the table that I assumed she was pointing to and sat. Eww and gross tons of food crumbs all over! So I moved to another table and it was even worst. Normally, I would think, ok whatever they were probably pretty busy but then I realized they only opened 15 min ago... The water that was brought out had something green floating around. So I left and didn't order."}
{"text":"I've come here several times for breakfast on either Saturdays or Sundays.  The restaurant is pretty small, but I've never had to wait, and the wait staff is always excellent.  (I have had the same waitress every time, and I wish I could remember her name-she knows the menu inside and out, makes great recommendations, is super sweet and attentive.  Next time I go, I'll be sure to remember her name and update my review.) Their mimosas are pretty strong and come in pint-size glasses! All of the portion sizes of the dishes I have had are pretty large, I always have enough for a second meal.  I usually order the chicken and waffles.  My boyfriend has gotten the chicken fried steak, egg breakfast, and waffle dogs (breakfast sausages on a stick, fried in waffle batter -delicious!).   My only suggestion would be to have more of a selection of coffee drinks - lattes, macchiatos, etc. But overall, great breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"Perfect breakfast place to chill out on the patio. Nice and quiet with a great menu. Definitely try the sweet potato tater tots :)"}
{"text":"So, so, so good.  I love this place. My only complaint is that Shane Doan was eating next to us and my wife was talking about how much she loves him the whole time. I got over it though, and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Man. This place was so disappointing. I was trying to think of a place to eat breakfast this morning, and this place popped into my head. I don't know why, I think I had heard of it from someone, but anyway, we were in the neighborhood so we went.   That was the mistake.   We waited outside for about 20 minutes, which wasn't so bad, considering this place was on tv and whatnot. We got seated over by the wall... really close to the people next to us. The place was loud and the person sitting next to me was yelling the whole time... did not stop. We were basically sitting at the same table as this person so that was annoying. Not the restaurant's fault though.   So I ordered the chicken and waffles at the waiter's recommendation and the BF ordered pancakes and bacon. We both ordered coffee (2.25 for a cup of drip coffee?!?!?! how do they charge so much?). The coffee wasn't terrible, not great, but not bad, kind of metallic, also we didn't get a second refill on the coffee... cups stood empty. The waiter brought out a tiny thing of half and half but never refilled it (the coffee was much worse without cream). Our food came quickly. The chicken was a fried breast on top of a thin waffle. The chicken actually had decent flavor, but the waffle was completely tasteless, soggy, and detracted from the overall flavor of the food... useless calories.  So my food was not terrible... but not good by any means, and for 9$, it should have been good. The real reason for the one star was the BF's pancakes. WTF. These pancakes were terrible. They had no flavor and they were dry as could be. These pancakes were not as good as bisquick at home. They were not as good as the pancakes at mcdonalds. They were not as good as those frozen pancakes that you microwave. How did they make pancakes so bad? At a popular breakfast place no less. In addition, the syrup was in a squeeze bottle on the table... not heated up or anything. The syrup was flavorless as well... mrs. butterworth's is better. So gross. And the bacon (4$), was so small. 3 wimpy soggy slices that were not at all crispy. Then I got the bill. 25$. Wow. This place has some nerve charging that much for this poor excuse of a breakfast.   Never again, I would go get a frozen breakfast from the grocery store before I would come get food here again."}
{"text":"Very cute little brunch/breakfast place. Bonus? It's down the street from my house. lol.   We were so hungry so we literally wanted everything on the menu. lol. I ordered the Chilaquiles. It has chicken, sour cream, cheese, and topped with eggs any style. This was quite yummy but it was spicy! Omg, I'm a wuss so I was dying. Someone should've warned me because it didn't say it on the menu. I think it would've been better if it wasn't so dam spicy for me. My friend ordered the Wolfpack. This comes with hashbrowns, cheese, bacon, and eggs. We topped it with gravy which made it delicious.   We washed everything down with Mimosas. I like the mimosas here. For $5 you get a pretty good size glass, not one of those skinny champagne glasses that it comes in. I'll definitely come back to try some more items on there! =)"}
{"text":"Nice chill little spot,  easy menu to choose from with good food.  They have 5 different bloody Mary's I grabbed the one with bacon it's really good."}
{"text":"Love this place! Really friendly servers and relaxed atmosphere. Had the simple two egg breakfast and it's always good. They have the basic hashbrowns which are my favorite... I also like that the servers don't sound scripted when you talk to them. By far my favorite breakfast place."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here after reading some of the previous reviews. This restaurant was clean and the service good. The food was ok, the portions generous. As was pointed out in another review, we felt the food and ambiance didn't reflect the price that was charged."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my first visit. Bright cheery decor and quick service. I had the wolf pack and it was excellent. Surprisingly not greasy and didn't leave me with that heavy feeling despite being a very large portion. Side of toast would've been nice.... But that's nitpicking."}
{"text":"Highly recommend the fried chicken waffle - it looks dry when it comes out but once you put some maple syrup and hot sauce on that baby, it totally comes alive and all the flavors blend together so well. Yummy!  Also highly recommend the Over Easy cold coffee with cinnimon and mint, sweetened with condensed milk - very addicting, not too sweet and refreshing!"}
{"text":"Visited Over Easy based on feature on DDD. Went on a weekend during Spring Training. Place was crazy busy, had tons of help, but the kitchen was not able to keep up with the crowd. We waited for about 40 minutes for our food. Servings were generous, food was great."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of breakfast places.  But Over Easy has opened my eyes.  My first trip was on a rainy day and got the chance to sit inside thankfully.  I had the Chilequiles.  If you've never had them before, I'd highly recommend trying them.  If you ask any of the staff, they'll tell you the same thing!  The staff was very attentive and we had a great time. I really enjoyed the open kitchen.  When you're sitting inside, you can see the kitchen right there.  As far as the place itself, it was small, not obnoxious, and felt very comfortable.  Probably would be best to avoid when it's raining, as the patio isn't completely covered.  Overall, Over Easy over achieves."}
{"text":"Food was wonderful! Ordered the banana pecan french toast, no pecans, I can't stand cooked nuts.  With a side order of super extra crispy hash browns.  Now when I order super extra crispy hash browns from other places, they're either burnt and still slimy on the inside or just cooked normal.  These hash browns were cooked perfect! Nice and crispy all over, so yummy!     Got there just before the brunch rush, was seating right away, the waitresses was very nice, and was served quite fast!    Wonderful place for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Not bad.  Basic breakfast.  Hash browns are sometimes greasy and undercooked but sometimes pretty good.  Corn beaf hash is good but sometimes not tender.  Eggs are usually quite good.  Their claim to fame is would be their excellent french toast.  Not a bad place if you live near it but I would never travel to eat there."}
{"text":"First time coming here. Drive by all the time and thought I would try something different. Super cute when I came in and nice vibe. Waitress was friendly. However, when I sat down the table rocked and my coffee kept spilling. So I moved to the next table over and that one rocked too. Waitress tried to put sugar packets under the legs to keep it from rocking. Still rocked every time you put your elbows down. I ordered the chicken fried steak. It was awful. Terribly seasoned. Literally had no taste and was so tough it was difficult to cut through. I didn't bother complaining as I had an appointment right after and didn't have time to order something else. Would not eat here again. I was there 5/13/16."}
{"text":"2nd time here and great great food!  Nice menu selection with some unique products which is why we came back. All the food had been amazing. The reason they lost a star is some of the staff has not been up to par.  We tried coming Christmas Eve and they closed early which is a little understandable but kinda pointless to close an hour early but the hostess was rude about it.  So we weren't even going to try the place after that but came back. Loved the food but the server so so.  This last time had a wonderful server. A very polite guy server who obviously been there awhile or just really enjoys his job. Said hi to the regulars and was just a pleasure to be there. So we will be back for the great food and hopefully we get another great server like him"}
{"text":"First time back since they first opened and now wish we would've gone back sooner!  I had the Salmon Benedict, my husband had the Chicken & Waffles, and our toddler had the Waffle Dog with fruit... we chowed down on the deliciousness so fast we barely had enough to offer each other to share.  We live just around the corner and were a bit disappointed with our first experience during their first weeks open.  Their overall service is 100x better than the last time we visited, and our server was very attentive, friendly, and timely.  Will definitely be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Great service, but I've had better food at Denny's.  At least it was expensive, so that was nice.  The omelet was both overcooked and uncooked (the eggs were overcooked, the ingredients to the Mile High Omelet were not cooked, the cheese was not even fully melted).  Additionally, there was condensation dripping on the customers from the exposed air ducts overhead.    I must say, though, that the service was outstanding.  My coffee never got cold, and we were constantly checked on.  However, for the money charged, the quality of the food was not worth the cost."}
{"text":"Jenna was really nice! Nice conversation, good food and she might, just might, deserve a raise. Perfect Sunday place to eat. Breakfast then groceries the perfect combination. I will be back! Glad I found a new spot."}
{"text":"The blandest food I've ever had. Adding salt, pepper and ketchup couldn't even save it."}
{"text":"Can someone please tell me why people go here???  Went to breakfast with Deb L, and she had a Living Social deal or one of those deal thingies. The place was packed, probably because it's a holiday week.  That doesn't excuse the EXTREMELY poor service. We sat down and waited. And waited. Servers walked by every few moments, nobody stopped to fill our water glasses or take our order. Finally, we both said something to a girl who walked by. She seems mystified that there was a job to do. With that many people working, getting a cup of coffee shouldn't take 15 minutes. Yes. 15 freaking minutes.  Food? Mediocre at best. I got the traditional eggs benedict with home fries. The only saving grace with the amount of ham on it. The English muffin didn't seem to be toasted. The eggs were *ok* but nothing great. The home fries? My 9-year old niece could do a better job. My burps right now aren't even good enough to brag about.  I'm sure if the service had been better, I wouldn't be so miserable right now. My food coma isn't satisfying. I will *never* go here again. Ever. I felt stupid leaving a tip, it was THAT bad.   Total. Fail. Blech."}
{"text":"Hubby and I went b/c of Triple D and we happened to be close by after a doctor's appt.   Our waiter and the rest of the staff were terrific!  While my husband had a \"meat\" omelet and hash browns that looked really great and he enjoyed every bit of-I went w/ the Mediterranean omelet w/ egg whites and toast.  I simply couldn't finish all of mine-but it was stuffed w/ spinach, tomatoes and garlic and was really great-menu said it had feta cheese, but there really was just a \"smattering\"  almost didn't taste it.  very much a neighborhood feel even though it was in a business park."}
{"text":"I really like this restaurant and previously had just gone to their Arcadia location. The Scottsdale location is close to work so I gave it a try with an deal I bought (which reminds me that I have one more left!). I got the same thing that I order at the other location: Mediterranean omelet with egg whites (no extra charge), spinach and feta. I was happy to see that the preperation was consistent. I also ordered the 1/2 Brioche French Toast. God, it was delicious. Thank goodness for the healthier omelet.  Service was great (I went at lunchtime during the week) and very attentive. I would definitely go back. My bill was just under $14 so I was pleased."}
{"text":"We are regulars on Sunday mornings and have been for years. It's a great place for tasty food. Several years ago I gave the place a 4 star review but I think it's ready for an upgrade.   What to eat there?  The chiliquiles are my favorite. Really good flavor and the salsa is out of this world. The Loko Moko is also great if you like the traditional Hawaiian treat. They substitute the traditional hamburger with a brat burger. If you like rice, brats, mushroom gravy, and eggs then go for it. The omelets are great as well. Big and tasty. Normally I get the standard 2 egg breakfast. Make sure to the the Tater Tots. I'm not talking a out the sweet potato ones. They are good but the traditional potato ones are out of this world."}
{"text":"The food is average; service is below average. I work in the office next door. I only go to this restaurant when I'm running late and have no other options. Food is overpriced, especially for the small portions. Hard to get out of there for under $12, even for just a salad or a small breakfast plate--maybe because they figure they have the business lunch crowd captive, but if I've got the time and the weather cooperates I prefer to walk across the street to the west to several other sit-down options for the same price, or walk a little farther to the east for lots of other fast-casual options for under $10. There's good news and bad news on the service: The bad news is even if there's not a crowd, it seems to take a long time to get your food.  The good news is that in the 5 times I've been there, my food has been comp'd 2 times because of how slow they are--and I didn't even ask.  So...I guess at least on some level they are aware of their shortcoming in this category. The bottom line is if you want an AWESOME breakfast at the same price, go wait in line at Snooze down the street--totally worth it.  Workers there are super friendly, and the only reason you need extra time there is because there's always a line to get in!"}
{"text":"This is one of the new stable of eateries on the 40th that is getting a lot of buzz. It's right next door to The Vig, and is always busy on weekends, which is the only time I can make it in. I really enjoyed the atmosphere of the joint, with Formica tables and a retro, midwestern feeling to it. The only drawback for me was that the tables may be a little too close to each other, and if you are not totally thrilled with being a part of everyone's conversation, it may not be the spot on a *hungover* weekend AM. I had the Wolfpack, which is a layering of hash browns and scrambled eggs, with bacon throughout. Pretty good, but I was thinking at the time I could use a bit of salsa, or at least a stripe of Sriracha. Price-wise, it was a bit more than a Waffle House, but less than a Rita's Kitchen. So, that would be - two dollar signs... I also tried the Over Easy location at the Ice Den up on Bell Rd. Much more quiet when I was in there, but that might not have been a good thing. This is the better of the two, IMO."}
{"text":"After watching Triple D we decided to stop here to give it a shot.  We got right in and were seated in several tables because our group was so large.  We had a horrible waiter who seemed to hate his job.  It was a very very long wait for our food.  The other table ordered, ate, and left by the time we finally got out food.  The chicken fried steak was average but nothing spectacular.  But the pecan French toast was TO DIE for.  After being there for over an hour and a half we finally talked to the new owner and he apologized.  Trying to explain that the easier foods get bumped to the front of the line for the cook.  And so ours was way in the back of the line of orders, even tho we were there before many other people.  He compinsated us our check and we didn't have to pay for it.  That was very kind of him, considering we didn't even ask for that.  Would try again and see if we get a better experience next time."}
{"text":"Despite some of the negative reviews, my husband and I and another couple tried this place out for breakfast. Yes, we are married, and according to another reviewer, that means our standards MUST be lower than single people who live in phoenix, but you have been warned that my review might be swayed because I'm a sub-par married woman.  I had the pancake breakfast, my husband had the wolfpack, my friend had a breakfast sandwich with ice coffee, and her husband had the loco moo (a fav from Kauai). All plates had more than enough, delicious breakfast food. The service was great, food was speedy and came out hot. We will definitely be coming back! Keep up the good work Gilbert Over Easy! All of married folks thank you!"}
{"text":"Outstanding chicken and waffles! The restaurant even stayed open late to accommodate my large group and I can't thank them enough. Great food, great service. Will come back again and again. Favorite brunch spot in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Had to wait almost 30 minutes on a Sunday morning and got only a counter seat at Over Easy. That's okay, it was worth it. A friend and I split a omelet with smoked salmon, asparagus and spinach and chose home fries. The omelet was tasty but a tad too salty. I'm not sure if it was the salmon or too much salt in the egg. The home fries were tasty but next time, I want to try the tater tots. We also split Reeses Pieces pancakes. At first, all I saw was a smattering of Reeses candies on top of three pancakes. I was like \"That's it?\" But I turned one pancake over and was relieved to see there were candies in the batter. I know that was the least healthiest thing I could have ordered, but no other restaurant offers M&Ms or chocolate chips in pancakes. The pancakes were just right, the thickness of each cake with a soft inside.   Love how they turned what was once a same-ol-same-ol fast food joint into a popular spot of home cooking. The staff seem friendly. While I was there, someone ordered the Big Easy of 12 eggs, 3/4 pound of bacon, home fries, etc. smothered in country gravy. That was one huge muthaf******. The whole staff came out to present it to the customer with the manager taking a picture, LOL. If one person finishes it in 30 min or less, it's free. I have no idea if they put a timer out there or what.  Anyway, looks like there's a wait no matter when you go on the weekend. At least they have a canopy with some benches near by. I'd go here again as long as the wait is under half an hour."}
{"text":"Yummy everything!  Eggs were cooked as asked for and the Banana-Pecan brioche French toast, eggs Benedict on cheddar jalapeño biscuits were great!"}
{"text":"someone told me this restaurant was closed. Obviously wrong. I like to eat here because it is a decent breakfast at a good price. Close to home. The Brioche French Toast is very good. I also like the chicken fried chicken with waffles."}
{"text":"Messed up chicken and waffles. This crap was on the chicken. GROSS.  Stay away. It sucks.  This dish is great if you ate 300 pounds and want to stay that way."}
{"text":"Went to breakfast a couple of weeks ago with friends. It wasn't anything to write an awesome review about. I had the egg/mushroom omelet. I was a little runny, but I think it was because they got my order wrong the first time and rushed to make me another. I might go back and try other things, but it's also a bit over-priced so maybe not. When there are endless choices of breakfast places, I would go back if others were going there. I probably wouldn't suggest it."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place.  The people are friendly and I'm not just talking about the employees, we always sit at the bar and end up meeting and chatting with someone.  I try and eat from the healthy menu but then end up getting something not so healthy....  I've never had corned beef hash before I came here and it's great!  Also, the eggs Benedict on the cheddar jalapeño biscuits...  Another guilty pleasure.."}
{"text":"Over Easy is a great place to eat breakfast or brunch. It has great service (very nice people). Their food is eggcellent!! We are having fun listening to cool music on the patio."}
{"text":"First one her, my wife and I came because The other restaurant we went to was packed. And frankly after eating here, I don't know why this place wasn't as packed.  I had the Cheddar Jalapeño Biscuits and gravy.  It actually wasn't as spicy as I thought it would be, but in a good way.  It was the right balance of spice and flavor. The biscuits were perfectly fluffy and the gravy was flavorful and not greasy.  My wife had the corned beef Benedict and she said the caramelized onions made the dish amazing.  She also said the eggs were poached perfectly.  Their coffee was mild and smooth, although we were disheartened to realize they had good choices for breakfast cocktails AFTER we ate.  Oh well. Maybe next time. I'm sure we will be back here to try some of the other appetizing selections from the menu.  But so far with the great service, fun ambiance and modern music this place is the bomb."}
{"text":"Not impressed.  The food was run of the mill, nothing to write home about.  Both my wife's and my food came out stone cold.  Not very impressed.  Will not go back"}
{"text":"We were in Scottsdale to visit family.  Our hotel suggested Over Easy for breakfast.  It was close to us and had been on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives.  It's a small restaurant with indoor and outdoor seating.  The indoor seating area is divided into two rooms.  The main room was bright, with lots of yellow.  The secondary room was gray.  No life, no color.  With one big wall separating the two rooms it felt a bit like we were in the over flow room; a secondary thought. Anyway, upon suggestion from our sever we both tried the Wolf Pack.  It is basically a hash brown sandwich with eggs, cheese and bacon, with the hash browns being the \"bread.\"  While it was good it was way too much hash browns.  While we understood what we ordered we didn't expect that quantity of hash browns.  It was overwhelming to the point you couldn't see any other items in the plate.  Eventually we had to scrape off, and cast aside, lots of hash browns just to get a good mix of food on the fork.  It was just okay. I would not have this again.  I wish I had tried the caramel French toast instead.  If we are there again, I just might. And, we will wait for a table in the main, colorful dining room."}
{"text":"I recently moved near this Over Easy location and decided to give it a try. The difference in food and service quality is ridiculous. My good here was barely warm, and the service sucked! My waiters wife and mother-in-law stopped in for breakfast and he sat down and talked with them for a while, leaving all his tables unattended! Horrible experience here, I much prefer the Gilbert location."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick bite to eat on our way to get our hair did. Fast and really friendly service. Got the waffle dogs as an \"appetizer\" and it was weird when our waiter mixed hot sauce and maple syrup as a dipping sauce, but it worked! The waffle dogs by themselves were really good but the sauce made them that much better. I got the selena breakfast burrito and it was amazing, I liked that you got to choose what was in the burrito. I liked the funky atmosphere here, would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Came in at 930-10 am on Wednesday and it was pretty full. We found a table and the busser immediately got us water. It took a bit for a server to get to us but we were fine and in no hurry. Mom had the eggs benedict florentine and I tasted the hollandaise which was awesome. Our other friend had the pumpkin brulee french toast (brioche, I believe ) and it came with a caramel bourbon sauce which she loved! She also had the over eady iced coffee and raved about that as well. I had the chicken and waffles. It was a nice crispy breast (boneless) and a decent sized waffle. Not anything fancy but delicious. Server was very sweet and on top of things. Overall, we enjoyed it and I'd like to try more things on that menu!"}
{"text":"As others, we wanted to check this out after the hype it got on the food network. Fun-looking place and good service but it is about the food after all.  I had the chicken fried steak and subbed a cheddar jalapeño bisquit for the potato. The CFS was tough and stringy; so bad a cut if meat that I had to spit out in a napkin the last bite I could stand to eat. The meat flavor was non-existent. The breading just as bad. It lacked any approximation of seasoning and tasted like fried corn starch. The gravy was just as bland and the sausage buttons they added to it were pink and undercooked. The bisquit was undercooked and pasty inside. Sorry, it was just that awful.  The other entre we tried was the chicken fried chicken with a waffle. Sad waffle. The sort of waffle that has so little rise to it that it didn't fill the iron and looked more like a waffle puddle. Flavorless as well. Ive had tastier toaster waffles. The CFC was dry and had the same starchy breading. We had to ask for butter and the waiter brough some and a small plate. He explained that the chicken was best eaten with sauce and proceeded to squirt syrup and hot sauce in the plate. It was better that way but nothing special.   A bad day for the chef? Or just a bad chef. Hard to tell but we'll never be back."}
{"text":"Over Easy just makes me happy. It's basic breakfast food done quick and very well with some delicious seasonal offerings. I like that you could regularly go in and see people that represent all different parts of the PHX valley. You might have some hungover college kids on one side and a Suns player with his family on the other.   The coffee is good and strong, the food is always prepared as described and to your order. Plus its always nice to eat in a local place and see the owners walking around saying good morning, filling coffee cups and  calling patrons by name.   I also heard that they provided a free holiday meal for homeless folks. I am happy to support small local businesses, but I am even happier to support those that actively try to help others and better their communities."}
{"text":"Not what is used to be when Brad ran it...was really never the same when they moved from the old Taco Bell in the vig pkg lot..."}
{"text":"We are back in AZ & of course the entire family couldn't wait for a visit to \"Over Easy!\" Again it was soooo delicious!   We ordered the waffle dog, chicken & waffles, thanksgiving waffle & banana French toast. They were all AMAZING! 2 were repeats but so tasty we had to!   If you haven't tried Over Easy & you live by one of their locations, you are missing out!   I even tried their homemade Bloody Mary...Mary Bacon, it was scrumptious!"}
{"text":"I'm downgrading from a 4 to 3, mostly due to service & undeserved high prices.   Good chilaquiles - nice and crispy. But the chicken served on top is bland and unappetizing.   Warning: a minuscule side of pico de gallo is $1.50 & 1/4 of a small avocado is $3.  Lovely outdoor patio and sunny retro decor. They have a liquor license for those who dig bloody marys & screwdrivers.   The waitstaff tends to be inattentive & can be outright rude, depending on your server. They're not going to go out of their way to make sure you have a good experience.   We'll be back, but mostly because it's close to home."}
{"text":"Pro-tip...if this place is on your \"to do list\" for the summer, put it on the backburner til about October.  Came here with my boyfriend last weekend for Sunday brunch and wowwwww it is tiny, cramped, and there is nowhere to wait inside for a table. That is, unless you want to stand in front of the door and hostess stand and have to shuffle constantly to let people in and out.  Also, it was 112 degrees outside and we literally felt NO AIR CONDITIONING inside! Whoa! Is that even legal in Arizona? What in sweltering sweat shop hell is going on here?  Our wait was advertised as 15-20 minutes but took more like 30 unfortunately. Had we known that, we likely would have just gone elsewhere.  It's a bummer because it's a cute place and the food is good.   I had the lemon ricotta pancakes and they were delectable. Moist and soft in texture with just the right amount of lemony flavor. I loved them.  Boyfriend had the malted waffle which he enjoyed thoroughly!  We will definitely return to OverEasy...but only when winter comes and we don't mind waiting outside or feeling no AC when dining inside!"}
{"text":"It's breakfast food. If you can't get breakfast food right, then you should not be in the culinary world. Granted, making a French omelette, or poaching the perfect egg can be challenging, but it's literally one of the first things you learn in culinary school. But, being a short-order cook sucks. And I've been to OverEasy enough to say that the service is always on par with a good breakfast joint and their food always comes out on time and accurate. Even at their busiest times (which seems to be around 9-10 on a Saturday/Sunday), they are pleasant and the food is reliable. I will say this - their coffee is outstanding. And they don't complain when you ask for a cup to go.  It's not HEART coffee, but it's damn good."}
{"text":"Horrible!!!  Potatoes are extremely greasy, burnt eggs, slow customer service, bland taste. I go to breakfast on a regular basis and this is by far the worst I have ever experienced."}
{"text":"Be aware for negative reviews, these are not regulars and have had one bad experience and then gripe about it. How sad! I've been here a handful of times and every time it's great. The service is good, the food tastes great, and they are accommodating. The chicken and waffles is delicious :). My fav!"}
{"text":"Awesome French Toast with caramelized bananas.  Eggs with wild mushrooms outstanding.  My husband had Selena burrito (plus more than half of my French Toast.).   4 stars only because it took awhile for server to take order and it was not that busy."}
{"text":"Coming from Vancouver and after seeing it on triple D we were eager to try it but sadly they were closed :(. I don't mean closed for the day but closed for good. Everything was vacant. Weird that the website still lists them. Maybe a good time to change that."}
{"text":"We went a few weeks ago and it was just okay. Nothing really special. I don't think I'll be back.   Ryan F. of Over Easy  Business Owner  Thank you for your response. We'll be sure to try your new menu. Thanks!"}
{"text":"This place is laughable and pretentious.  We went in for breakfast on a Saturday morning, the 20 minute wait was expected and the least of our worries.  The server was by far the worst experience i have ever seen, after the second failed attempt at taking our drink order the yahoo finally decided to write it down (there were only 4 people in our party - 3 coffee's, 2 waters, an iced tea and a large OJ - even i remember that). . It took about 5 minutes for the drinks to stagger to our table. After sitting for about 10-15 minutes we finally placed our order, again (i should have known based on our drink order experience that this was going to be a long/bad experience). Again our order was written down (not that i fault a server for taking the time to do it right, its just a shock to see these days outside of a 5&Diner). 5 minutes later the server approached our table to notify me that the kitchen didn't have a component to the order i placed, not the end of the world but the time in which it took to become aware of it was the alarming part, how long did that guy really take to place our order? (just a little glimpse into our experience with this nameless server, when ordering sausage instead of ham on my mother in-laws eggs Benedict the server asked if she wanted links or patty's..... uhhhhh??? Really?).  The food came SUPER FAST, almost annoyingly fast. My husband ordered the chicken and waffles, not what we expected.. A small SMALL waffle and a fried chicken breast - the whole plate looked half a**ed. My eggs Benedict's were acceptable, one of the eggs was completely cooked which means the rest of my plate missed half of the necessary yummy juices from that poor little overcooked egg. not the crime of the century just disappointing.  mind you the eggs Benedict's do come with your choice of potatoes, so much to our surprise when her order arrived ala carte it was a shock - flagging someone down to advise of the partial order was a challenge. Thank goodness the manager was the one who was able to help.  Lastly i think we watched our busy server buzz around the restaurant for at least 10 minutes after our meal was complete.   All in all i was NOT impressed, the meal was overpriced, the plates were small (weird i know, but it made our food look awkward), the service was TERRIBLE so 1+1= Not planning on returning. ."}
{"text":"Starving after a long workout sess. w my bestie, we Google search breakfast places in the area. Low and behold, there is one I hadn't known of right down the road from me. Looking for something other than a classic chain breakfast place, we decided to hit up Over Easy. This North Scottsdale location is beautiful; there is a pathway out front with lush desert landscape, with a few well-groomed trees and flowers. Inside, was another story:   Our hostess was darling; I almost felt sorry she had to work there by the end of my visit. Our waitress seemed to be in la -la land the entire time. My friend had to raise her hand like a school child after multiple failed attempts to catch this woman's attention. She also did not smile or offer suggestions. They seemed to have a cool, expensive-looking coffee contraption behind the bar, but nobody seemed to be using it-- prob because the waiters don't suggest it!? Had I known they served bloody Marys I may have ordered that too. I ordered the wolfpack and got a hot, greasy mess of hash browns and bacon w cheese . The cheese was really unnecessary and I wish the hash browns could have at LEAST been crispy. My  friend ordered the chilaquiles and was deceived by the wording on the menu. The menu said \"tortillas\".... Instead she got a fist sized, greasy-looking egg blend and the entire rest of the plate covered in near-burnt homemade tortilla chips. The whole meal was way over priced for how sucky it was.   I will prob never go back."}
{"text":"Love the ambience, love the kid-friendly service, and love the menu. Very good service, good pancakes, good French-toast, but something weird is going on with the bananas. Were they coated in something or frozen/de-thawed? Or just off? I'm not sure but it was different. I'd get that delicious French toast again because the rest was so darn good. I'll be back, truly I will."}
{"text":"First time at this location and it was just as good as all the rest. Great selection of yummy breakfast treats. The Yard has a parking situation, so be forewarned - it's crowded!! Ride your bike over or walk and you'll be happy enough. The food is so so good. Think light and fluffy pancakes, sweet pumpkin bread French toast, and flavorful loco moco. Service is stellar and the selection of morning beverages is perfect. Loved it."}
{"text":"Over Easy has a new menu and it is damn delicious. Creamy grits, delicate french toast, healthy and flavorful avacado toast with eggs - oh my goodness. This place never disappoints and I'm glad to see a few new items on the menu. Keep up the good work guys!!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few times now and it was worth going back to, although nothing worth writing home about. One thing did really bother me though. Read below.   Likes: great atmosphere, basic breakfast items, reasonable prices.   Dislikes: pumpkin French toast is too sweet and mushy, normal problems with service that will come with any new restaurant but I wouldn't hold that against them until they are a few months into it.   Here is what really bothered me though. They advertise their pancakes and French toast as coming with real maple syrup. Anyone who knows real maple syrup knows how big of a difference that makes and how rare it is to get that. I grew up with real maple syrup know how much better it makes pancakes or French toast.  I ordered French toast and confirmed with my waitress that it came with \"real maple syrup\". As soon as I got my French toast and \"real maple syrup\" I knew the consistency was wrong.  It had a little bit of the right taste but not the real thing. I was extremely disappointed. Then my suspicions were confirmed when I saw another waiter pouring syrup into the containers that they serve at the table. He was mixing two different syrups. 30% real maple syrup and the rest cheap crappy corn syrup.  They are lying on their menus and it's not okay."}
{"text":"I have to jump off the Over Easy bandwagon unfortunately. I have eaten there a few times now and it just occurred to me today that I never (and I mean never) have good service. I can make a good breakfast myself if need be and save some scratch.  I go out to eat for fresh hot food and great service. Today my friend and I received neither.   Upon arrival we sat immediately since we arrived before 8. We were \"greeted\" by a server In about 1 min and asked if we were ready to order.  I stated we were not but drinks would be great.  We got our coffee within a few mins (which tasted fine). After that no sign of our server for 10 mins or so.  The table next to us was also looking to order from our MIA waitress.  She finally came over and took our order in a fast and courteous manner. The food arrived in about 15 mins but there was a problem......my friend's biscuits n gravy were barely room temperature.  After attempting to flag down the waitress for a few mins she walked by holding up her finger to let me know to wait min.  I don't know if she was being rude but it came across that way. After telling her the problem there was no apology and she walked away with his plate returning about 10 mins later with a hot plate of food. The food itself was good, but not great in any way. Our coffee cups went empty for long stretches of time and our waffle dogs had no crunch to them whatsoever.  After all that they give me the wrong bill which was about 5 bucks short of what we spent. After running my card they came back and asked for my card again and took about 15 mins to redo the bill and charge us 5 buck more. After the poor quality service I would figure they just let it slide since they made the mistake anyway and it was 5 bucks and not 20.   I feel that there are many places that match the quality of the food at Over Easy and have much better service.  I will no longer eat there."}
{"text":"Not good at all. The young staff basically ignores you if you have any grey hair. The food was just OK, but I won't be back. The Good Egg is much better."}
{"text":"WORST SERVICE IN HISTORY at the Scottsdale location. I love their food, but it is NOT WORTH the disrespect. Unprofessional, incompetent servers get my order wrong EVERY TIME I go there. I wasn't aware it was so hard to remember sausage over bacon. Ridiculous. When ANY customers walks in the door, they ignore them, and eventually get round to seating them or letting them KNOW THEY ARE CLOSED. Do NOT eat at Over Easy."}
{"text":"I had the Chicken and Waffles. It was just \"OK\". Nothing to rave about. The chicken was a real piece of breast breaded and fried. The oil needed to be changed, I could taste that the chicken was fried in dirty oil. This place has a lot of potential, unique menu items.   PS- I also suggest serving warm syrup with the pancakes and waffles, I do not prefer cold syrup. :)"}
{"text":"Today we ordered food to cater a work Holiday breakfast. When we came to pick up our food the staff was very friendly and kind. The staff helped load up our car with all our food and provided plates and condiments even. The food was very warm and well cooked. We continued through out our departments holiday party receive compliments on the food. I would like to thank Over Easy for making it easy for me and my co worker host an amazing holiday party with our department. We will come back next year for our annual party. I also plan on telling everyone about this hidden gem here in Scottsdale. Ps the eggs were amazing and the bacon was great quality."}
{"text":"Good service, good food. I had the waffle sausages which were a little pricey but super tasty and I thought worth it. I will definitely be back to try other things on their menu."}
{"text":"Breakfast is one of my favorite meals of the day and OVER EASY hits that spot!  I had the signature dish OVER EASY, which is toasted brioche topped with spinach and fried egg.  Oh so yummy!  I also shared a cranberry scone.  The place is small but if you go on  a Sunday before 9am your sure to get a seat in no more than 5 mins.  LIke Kristin says its cheap and oh yeah coffee was good too....anyway try it bc it is seriously tasty!  I had some of my bf's french toast topped with caramelized banana and pecans. TO DIE FOR!!"}
{"text":"My husband, 1-year old son and I headed to this restaurant because a friend had recommended it.  I had no idea that the original was featured on Food Channel's Diner's, Drive-ins and Dives until after the fact.  The place is attached to the Alltel Ice Den on 93rd Street and Bell Road.  When we 1st walked in, there were 4 employee's working who glanced at us but didn't acknowledge it.  It was until we were fully standing in the middle of the restaurant and made eye-contact with our later-to-be server that she asked us where we wanted to sit.  We decided to sit outside since the weather was perfect.   I ordered the eggs with corn beef hash and toast. My husband ordered the Wolfpack (2 eggs any style, bacon, choice of cheese layered between hash browns).  Our son ate off our plates and had his own bowl of kids tater tots (only $1 and very good!).  I'd have to say I enjoyed my husbands dish more than mine.  The corn beef hash was different than what I was normally used to.  It was basically ground up pieces of corned beef with a few cubes of potatoes and chopped onions mixed in.  The eggs I chose were sunny-side up - and they put a lot of salt on it.  So on top of my salty eggs and corned beef hash that is generally already salty,  I drank 3 glasses of water during my meal.    The service was ok.  Our server didn't refill my water or my husband's ice tea for quite some time.  Other than that, she was friendly to my son (always a bonus)!  Our bill came out to $21 (including a 20% tip).  We'll come back and try this place again."}
{"text":"Appears that lately all of my friends have been on a breakfast kick. Had breakfast for lunch today.  Short walk from the office, so convenient, being noon and in the parking lot of several large office complexes we figured it would be packed but it wasn't. Place is fairly small with an open kitchen concept with a small town diner feel.  Menu is fairly small some classic and unique breakfast dishes with some burgers thrown in the mix.  I opted for the traditional Benedict. Ice tea to drink. Tea tastes herbal, was a refreshing change of pace. Food was prepared quickly.   My Benedict was plated nicely, the only complaint I had was the hollandaise was fairly thin, so thin I could see the perfectly poached eggs beneath.  Almost looked like straight up yolk.  But, everything tasted good. Service was good. Price is on point for the area and portion size was large. My dish easily could be shared with two people with small to normal appetites.  I will go back to Over Easy if I am in the area and have a hankering for breakfast."}
{"text":"I've been a big fan of over easy before the expansion when it was just a small hole in the wall and you waited over 2 hours just for a table. Since then I've visited several locations and have been somewhat satisfied with the food. It's definitely changed over the years and not necessarily for the better. However, this location has now become the absolute slowest of them all. I type this review as I'm going on over an hour wait after ordering my food and am staring at an expediting window with an overflowing printer full of tickets while a man who appears to be a manager rolls silverware and has no regard for the kitchen being so overwhelmed. Plates have been sitting in the window and our server has disappeared for the last 30min .... Probably because of her embarrassment for the longest wait time in breakfast history."}
{"text":"We waited over 45 minutes for our food, and in the duration of the wait we were not checked on for anything. People who walked in way after us got their food at the same time we did. On top of that we were not impressed with the mimosa or the food."}
{"text":"We've driven by the PHX Over Easy many times but I refuse to wait for it.  I knew in my heart that it wasn't the same type of food worth waiting for like Matt's.  We decided to head way out to the apparently non-popular Over Easy to see what all the fuss was about.  To sum it up, just don't bother!  We walked inside and the place was only about 1/2 full so we grabbed a seat in the middle where there were three terribly placed tables.  My first impression was not a good one, as this restaurant is horribly under utilized and very poorly planned.  The color scheme was nice and cheerful though.  I really really hated the vinyl chairs that clung to my legs.  It was really uncomfortable.  After perusing the menu for a few moments I decided that the Wolf Pack was the way to go for me.  I like big manly breakfasts and this sounded perfect!  Two layers of hash browns with bacon and eggs cooked to order in the middle with cheese on top.  Yum!  That really sounded delicious to me, unfortunately it was a big heaping pile of FAIL slopped on a plate.  The bacon was about the only good part of my meal.  The cheese tasted like plastic, the eggs were rubbery, and the hash browns were so greasy that they slicked my lips with oil after every bite.  In the end, despite the fact that I only ate about 1/3 of my food, I got sick.  I was not a happy camper and I will never come back."}
{"text":"Good place for breakfast, order the wolf pack like triple D did. Good service and a nice upgrade move from the old Taco Bell location to the newer current location. We also went to the other location at the ice den which is very modern. One of the better places for breakfast in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Went here because we were in the area and they were open. I love eggs benedict so I ordered the florentine but asked for tomato on it. They offer it with just spinach, the egg, and hollandaise but had no problem adding the tomato. Hubby ordered \"The Over Easy - toasted brioche with sautéed spinach, fried egg & natural jus with bacon & scallions.\" The food was cooked ok but there was no flavor whatsoever to my benedict. I loaded it up with salt and pepper and that made it edible. Served with potatoes so plenty to eat but didn't excite me. Hubby's dish had a lot more flavor but he said it was kinda dry unless you got the egg on each bite. Coupled with the fact that the restaurant was super dirty, including the seats and the floor, I don't think I'd go back. There's plenty of far more exciting places for amazing breakfasts where the food has better flavor and the place is sparkling clean. Certainly not the worst but just mediocre, in my opinion."}
{"text":"I went here with a friend on a Sunday at around 9:00 or 10:00 am since there was only 2 of us we only waited about 10 minutes. I ordered the wolf pack.... It was really good! The service was fast & friendly. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't serve coke products :( but other than that I really enjoyed the experience!"}
{"text":"Long line. Short wait (for a table).  Big crack at the bar. The build up the to the featured chicken fried steak was preempted with this lovely site.  We had a laugh.  The food was excellent! All of us really enjoyed our food. Eggs were perfect.  Hash browns were excellent.  Gravy. Awesome.  The CFS was as I expected.    The folks said they'd return. And when I come back to this city, I will return for the green chile pork and grits!!"}
{"text":"I've been back a few times, so thought it was time for an update.  Unfortunately, it was worse than I remembered!  I really don't think the food is very good.  I got the mushroom scramble last time. It was disgusting.  I know those are strong words, but that is the way I feel.  The food is way overpriced for what you get.  I would rather put up with the hoards of annoying people at LGO than eat here."}
{"text":"First time at Over Easy even though we only live about a mile away!  Our new go-to breakfast stop.  Great corned beef hash (which I haven't had in years).  Great service.  A little pricey but worth the cost.  Patio was packed.  We'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Very good food, service, and diner - like atmosphere and friendly staff. The eggs Benedict was very good, particularly the hollandaise sauce. The Wolfpack breakfast appealed to my husband for its name and taste. The place is clean. It's a bustling place for a sunny breakfast or brunch. Has bar offerings."}
{"text":"I have already been here 2 times.  I like the service, all the employees here are fantastic, very personable and on top of things.  Unfortunately, it's so packed that even if they are on top of things, the service ends up losing quality.   And why is it packed?  Are there no other breakfast places in Gilbert?  Really?!!!  The food sounds great in the menu, but it's just alright.  Nothing to moan about.   So if I go back it'll be on an off-peak time, so at least I can get good service.  And I'll try something else next time, in hopes I can find out what it is that these hoards of people are eating and coming back for more."}
{"text":"One of the few places in town to get a NORMAL breakfast on a weekday!  I used to frequent the place but my office location moved too far away, but when I did, I loved it.  The coffee is great, and the meals are definitely above par.  The current location is a bit noisy for meetings, etc. which is my only gripe."}
