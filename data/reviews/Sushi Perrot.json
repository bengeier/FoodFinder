{"text":"Dispendieux les sushis !!!! Mais beaucoup de choix, très bon et le personnel est très aimable. Sushi pour 2 environ 50$-60$ . Petit endroit ne peux acceuillir plus de 15 personnes. Plus un endroit pour faire des take out. Appeler avant car sinon attente de 30 minutes et plus."}
{"text":"Still tastes good.  Consistent.  Tempura wasn't tempura though.  Just panko shrimp with Yakisoba sauce.  :)"}
{"text":"I love the sushi here, probably not the best in Montreal, but great deal and all made fresh and quick in front of you. Owner is a great friendly guy."}
{"text":"Small sushi place with basic menu and good service. Had the sashimi-moriawase combo, which came with salmon, tuna, shrimp, scallops and octopus. Very well done, but a tad pricy and did not come with rice."}
