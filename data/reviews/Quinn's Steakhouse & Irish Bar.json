{"text":"My boyfriend and I came for the Winterlicious dinner during the past week. We were so excited for dinner after reading the menu online. And to get an app, main course and dessert all for $35 at a steakhouse - seemed like a steal!   Upon arrival, we were seated at the bar until our reservations opened up. After being guided to our booth, we were presented with bread; no big deal. My boyfriend ordered the soup which he really enjoyed, and I ordered the caesar salad. There were literally about 5 pieces of lettuce on my plate. I was hoping that this app didn't set the stage for my dinner..  For the main course, my boyfriend ordered the Bacon-wrapped Beef Tenderloin, well-done; I ordered the Steak Frites, medium-well. When we got our order, we were extremely underwhelmed. My steak was overdone and very dry, while my boyfriend's was still a little pink (he hates blood!). Still, without a fuss, we ate it. The waitress barely ever came to check up on us, and was not very friendly to say the least. We still had our hopes high for dessert...  We both ordered the double-chocolate pecan fudge brownie. THIS was the biggest joke. It was literally two bite-sized brownies, two tiny pecans and a little chocolate fudge. I could've made this at home for $2.   I understand that this (should) mostly function like a pub, but the prices are WAY overpriced. The food should at least be suffice for the price. I could've eaten better food at the keg for WAY less.   Needless to say, never coming back here again!"}
{"text":"Quinn's is a little random - unsure if it wants to be full steakhouse or a pub and as a result isn't really either but I loved the dark wood booths and the quaintness. The service is great, friendly waitstaff who were very personable and the food came out quickly. We had the lobster mac and cheese as an app and it was quite good, very rich though. The steaks were good - I had filet mignon, medium rare. BF had the prime rib, rare. Both cooked well and delish mashed potatoes on the side. The \"grilled\" vegetables were more...tossed in olive oil and then put on the plate.  We finished with creme brûlée but it was a bit of a let down."}
{"text":"I went here last January... by accident.  I thought I'd finally yelp it since I found a matchbook from them in one of my many suitcases.  Have you ever met a stranger and spontaneously decided to share a meal? That's how I ended up at Quinn's.  We were both staying at the Sheraton for business.  This joint came highly recommended (not from yelpers but from locals actually) . 3 hours later: a fine non-rushed meal, tasty local wine (excellent selection), pleasant conversation, a split check and email exchange.   I do recall the service was exceptional, my fish was buttery and done perfect, the vegetable and starch sides were sufficient, the wine pairing was smart and the ambiance was peaceful after a long work week.  If you are looking for a scene, go to Keg down the block.  I wasn't a fan of keg, lest you like hanging around 20 year olds that have really piercing \"hi's\" and \"oH my GoD's!\" to their friends who obviously couldn't hold their liquor.  I'd recommend it if you're staying at the Sheraton or close by and want a sophisticated option.  Worth the price."}
{"text":"Great place...  So far I've only eaten at the bar. The Charcuterie was lacking (dry?!?). The pâté brûlée was odd. BUT the salads are WONDERFUL!!! The wild mushrooms and arugula salad is BEAUTIFULLY done!!    I also tried the goat cheese and beet appetizer - yummy!!    Irish Cocktail Sausages are sooo good!!! (Ask for grain mustard)."}
{"text":"Went there with the family for a birthday celebration. The reservation was for 6:30, we arrived early and were happy to wait at the bar until our table was ready. We were seated promptly at 6:30. Our wait staff did not appear to take any drink orders until 7:00. We were seated right next to an extremely loud group of people who had been there since 2:00. When we finally met the wait person, who was very friendly and working hard, she assured us that the party would be leaving shortly. At 7:15 we finally asked to be moved to another table as we couldn't hear each other over the noise of the party. The staff were very good about accommodating us and did move us to the front where we could have a nice conversation together. It was close to 7:30 by this time and we were hungry. The food when it arrived was excellent. The service was very slow but perhaps this was due to the high maintenance of the unruly party at the back. All in all, the food was excellent but the service was lacking considering the very high prices that we paid. We paid over $500.00 for dinner and drinks for the six of us. At those prices you would expect very prompt service and professionalism when handling a large unruly party. At the very least we should have been offered some sort of compensation for our experience. We will not be back. A shame really, as the food was excellent and the staff meant well but were not equipped to deal with a situation that should have been covered in basic hospitality training."}
{"text":"Went here for summerlicious with a bunch of people.  Got the steak and also tried the bacon wrapped sirloin.  Cooked nicely.  Portions are decent size could be an oz. bigger."}
{"text":"Quinn's is separated into two parts: one is an Irish Bar and another one has more of a steakhouse setting with proper tables and booths.  If one stays in the bar part then it is possible to order food from the bar menu, the steakhouse menu, as well as Shopsy's deli, which is a nice feature.  The bar itself is somewhat similar to other Irish bars in the downtown area such as PJ OBrien's and Irish Embassy. However this bar is not as large as the two that I just mentioned.  I've been to the bar and the steakhouse at least 4 or 5 times over the last few years. The bar has a decent enough selection of beers and harder stuff.   As far as the restaurant goes, I find that in the past their steak menu was better than it is now. The steak right now is of comparable quality to the Keg - which is by no means up there.  Last time I had a chance to try their desserts. It tasted as if it was simply pulled out of the fridge and has been sitting there a long time. I would've expected something a little fresher.  Ultimately this steakhouse fails to deliver the meal of a quality that would be comparable to those of a proper steakhouse such as Harbor Sixty, Morton's, etc. My advice would be to come here for a drink and perhaps some lighter food."}
{"text":"Service was poor. Surly waitress who also took her time putting my order in. She clearly downgraded me as a customer as I was dining solo. Food was fine but nothing special. Ordered steak medium rare, was adequately done, but sides were meager and my plate was taken early without my express direction."}
{"text":"It is okay.  Not jaw dropping!  Fairly standard. Came here with a girlfriend for Winterlicious.  Had a Prime Rib.  Dessert is tasty.  Our server was very good.    Nice red wine but $11.00 a glass.  Would I come back?  Maybe.    But Sheraton Hotel is a great hotel!  I love it!"}
{"text":"Food was good. Service was a little slow but the waiter was kind and explained the menu well. The restaurant has a strange lay out. It shares the space with another restaurant with a wall down the middle. You go through the same entrance and walk through a different restaurant to get to Quinn's if you enter off the street. We paid $150 with tip for 2 people(appetizer, prime rib, filet, extra side and 4 drinks).  Overall it was a good place for dinner but there are alot of other resturants too choose from at that price."}
{"text":"Been here twice, left unhappy both times.  On the last visit, I ordered mussels $12 and peppercorn steak $39.   Mussels was fine, 2 pieces were not fresh and taste sort of rancid. But for $12 and the location. I let it go.  Peppercorn new york steak came with a totally burn crust. The medium rare steak was juicy and tender but the crust was so burned that it gave a very strong aftertaste. I have had peppercorn steak elsewhere before and none of them offer BURNT crust, felt like tasting a tender charcoal.   Waiter was nice and offered me a regular new york strip after sending the peppercorn back. Not sure if it was the peppercorn crust that burnt my palate or what.  The regular steak doesn't taste like a piece of steak, instead it tasted like the stir fried beef u get in a Chinese restaurant.   I asked for the bill after my 2nd bite. Left the restaurant still hungry....  With Ruth Chris just right next to the restaurant. I would rather pay more for much better quality. Or go to the keg that's in the similar price point."}
{"text":"Good steak. Decent (if at times aloof) service. Good beer list. No wait. No judgement for dining alone. One happy customer."}
{"text":"I have been on the hunt for good places for steaks in Toronto for a while, and this place is no doubt the best so far!  All the nice things have been said already, and I agree with others!  I am definitely going back in a month!"}
{"text":"Came here to winterlicious with my boyfriend. Food was good & staff was nice :)"}
{"text":"Amazing food and great service. Wonderful way to celebrate the New Year even to the extent of being under priced for what was offered."}
{"text":"This is my second time coming here for Summerlicious and I have to say that this time was even better than the first! They were great when I called to make the reservation and we were able to ask for separate bills right off the bat since we were a large group.  There were many great choices on their lunch menu which made it so hard to narrow it down to one. I had the warm mushroom and arugula salad, the 8 oz sirloin burger (which was massive) and the berry crumble for dessert. All of them were excellent! My co-workers got the steak frites, the salmon, and the vegetarian pasta dish and everyone was very impressed. The service was very quick and friendly. I would definitely eat here again and I think it's one of the better bang for your buck summerlicious menus."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came here at almost 8pm on Sunday. The restaurant was not busy but we still had to wait 25 minutes for our food. Filet Mignon is tough and dry. Prime rib is ok. Overall, not impressed. Will not return."}
{"text":"The food here is just excellent.  The first time I ate here I had an amazing turkey dinner, with double the cranberry sauce.  (Okay part of my high praise has to do with the fact that they even had that one on the menu.  Turkey!  In July!)  The second time - today as a matter of fact - I had the steak and eggs breakfast.  The meat was done to perfection, and everything else was cooked and presented just right.  The server was friendly and attentive, and I was able to sit, eat and read my novel without feeling rushed to get out.  I'll definitely be returning again."}
{"text":"Come here and expect downtown prices. We made a quick stop inside after a day of sightseeing and had two beers and a soda water. Total bill was $20 Canadian. Seems the norm for downtown and hotel beer prices. Good ambiance, service was great and they showed curling on tv! In the US, you'd never find curling - we loved the change!"}
{"text":"Prime rib was very good. Seafood pasta was above average.  High-end price range."}
{"text":"came here for winterlicious and i gotta say, it's pretty darn good!!"}
{"text":"Went to Quinn's Steakhouse last week as I had purchased a Groupon months ago which I totally forgot about until a few days before expiry. It is definitely worth trying!   We stayed in the bar area which had its own menu. My partner, who is Irish, was excited to see some familiar Irish fare on the menu and had to try them. The curry chips were tasty - the fries could have been hotter and more well done, but the sauce was great. He also insisted we had the cocktail sausages with brown sauce as he fondly recalled how these would be served after weddings and get togethers. Loved them! He is very picky about how his Guinness is poured and he thought it tasted great!   Our server was probably the best server we have had in a long time. She was so very friendly and attentive - wish all servers could be like her.   If you find yourself in the city centre and want a place to relax and have some finger foods, try this place out!"}
{"text":"Food: I came here for winterlicious and the food here was plain.  The leek and potatoe soup you can't really complain and you can't say whats special about it. I ordered steak frites and the steak was flavourless. You get exactly just fries and steak with one slice of horseradish paste. I always thought that frites were the really slim looking fries though. But its those normal looking fries. Don't expect much for presentation. The brownies were just like the brownies i made at home from betty crocker's recipe. Nothing special.    Service was really not that great. The waiter we had was nice and friendly however, he just wasn't good at what he does.  1. He forgot to give me a spoon for my soup. 2. He forgot to give me my knife for my steak. 3. I request to change my dessert and it was not changed. He wasn't even aware of it. 4. He left a tray on one of our empty chairs!  5. He forgot ketchup and i had to tell him twice! *very forgetful  I saw that some entree that people ordered that was not on the winterlicios menu looked a lot better. To be honest, it might be more worth it at the end! I rather not have the appetizer and dessert and order surf and turf."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times now, every time I have had the Lobster Mac and Cheese. The first time I had it, I felt like I had died and gone to heaven! I love lobster and I love Mac and cheese so this was my dream meal. The second time I dined here the lobster Mac and cheese was not what I had remembered it had been. It was bland and cold, not appetizing at all. i went back a third time because I had a groupon and I thought I would give the lobster Mac and cheese one last try because I really did love it the first time. I was so happy that it tasted so good! It was melt in your mouth good. If they are consistent with the tastiness of the lobster Mac and cheese I will definitely go back over and over again."}
{"text":"Quinn's is two separate places, first an Irish pub and second a quiet quaint steakhouse. I've walked past the Sherarton many times and never knew it was there. The ambiance inside is very nice. Staff are attentive. They have a lovely wine list and terrific food. We had the lamb and the ribs both were good. The price is quite reasonable for what you get. I definitely would go back!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing ! To be honest, I came here with not super high expectations but the food and service blew me away. Our server was very kind and the food was absolutely delicious.  Their cheesecake is the best tasting cheesecake I have ever had, and that's saying a lot! I definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"I was invited to Quinn's for my birthday dinner because my friend had a coupon. I was apprehensive not only because of the coupon but because it was part of Shopsy's Deli. While not the greatest steakhouse it was surprisingly good. The food was flavorful and the service good (although the servers we a little too friendly; I like my servers a little detached). The wine list was limited but good.  Great value, even without a coupon."}
{"text":"Went for Summerlicious 2015. What a great place! Amazing food and service. Huge portions considering it was Summerlicious. I'm in the restaurant industry so I can be a bit critical but I was very pleasantly surprised. The manager even came over to check on us (which I know hardly ever happens as often as it should anymore) and he was very genuine and nice. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Bar: This is across the street from work, so it is the watering-hole for people at work. It is pretty laid back and isn't the worst guiness pour I've had. It gets really crazy packed right after work, I usually opt for the bar side. The servers are nice but could be more attentive. Getting their attention is hard I did everything short of flailing my arms.   Dining: The dining room experience is only ok. The pub fair is preferred over some of the other mains. I was with a party of three and my food was cold. I get that the food should be served at the same time but there is some poor planing on the kitchen's part since there was variation in temperature for food. The way seating is done the waiters/waitresses won't see you need service until they circulate the room and even if there are a few diners they don't seem to circulate quite enough. The meals aren't terrible if you are using a groupon, otherwise there are a few better options in the area for the price."}
{"text":"Having worked so close to Quinn's for the last 5+ years I had actually never given it half a thought to visit. Came here for lunch with a few coworkers as a last minute nearby option and was surprised at how much business they had. Not packed around 1PM, but still more than probably 60% full for a larger than expected space. Caesars were nice and spicy and the open faced STEAK SANDWICH came topped with arugula, mushrooms, and thinly sliced deep fried onions. steak was delicious -- excellently seasoned and super juicy, mushrooms flavourful, but onions limp and unnecessary, and bread difficult to cut thru. Had it with a side of mixed greens which came topped with dried cranberries, chickpeas, and dressed with a thyme-heavy vinaigrette which was a surprising flair. The two other steaks at the table were ordered medium but one definitely came out as a rare. Decent amount of lunch options, priced as per sit-down options in the area."}
{"text":"My mom and her friends go here for the prime rib sandwich and I had a chance to come try it with my mom.  The sandwich was delicious.  Fresh actual roast beef, medium rare with crispy fried onions on top that remained crispy and weren't soggy.  The bread was fresh too and it came with a nice bowl of salad and a bowl of au jus to dip.  Service was friendly.  Comfortable seating.  Would never have thought of coming in here for a good lunch!"}
{"text":"The Good: The service was great.  They were very attentive and one of the servers was also training another server at the same time, but she was very patient in showing her the ropes and at no time did I feel that either of them did not focus on the task at hand.  I ordered the Caesar Salad, Surf and Turf, and a side of buttered Button Mushrooms. The bread was warm and very delish. The salad was a standard salad. Nothing special, but everything was fresh. The steak was done to my liking and well-flavoured. The mushrooms had a bit too much butter, but the flavour and seasoning gave it a nice balance.   The Bad: The lobster was overpowered by seasoning salt. I think the lobster, dipped in butter (didn't include a lemon wedge, that might have been better) would've tasted just fine, but the seasoning made the meat taste like msg. Had me drinking water through the whole meal.   The Overall: Pretty impressed with the service considering I came in with a coupon. It's very iffy about service nowadays when they see you coming in armed with a discount in hand, bu this was not the case.  Revisit: Probably not. It's a great place to try out since I had a Dealfinder coupon for $50 and for what I got, it was a great deal. But for a regular priced meal, there are a number of other steak houses in town that I'd try out instead."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch was disappointing with over cooked eggs benny and slow service. The egg-white omelet was flat and heavy."}
{"text":"This is a decent steakhouse and pub, but it's located in the bottom of a hotel (the Sheraton), so expect to pay hotel restaurant prices.  I had the steak frites with the chipotle butter, and it was pretty decent. The steak was tender and juicy and the fries were quite tasty. Nothing mind blowing here, but I enjoyed the meal.  In terms of atmosphere, I would say it's pretty casual and mid-range. Since it's a pub and steakhouse, it really just feels like a pub.   In terms of drinks, there is a pretty decent beer list and what looks like a good selection of cocktails and whiskey."}
{"text":"We only stopped here for drinks, but I loved the ambiance and the service. We had a great visit! We had a run-in with the owner's brother-in-law from the UK and had a fun conversation with him, too.   I would not think twice about returning!"}
{"text":"Came here on my birthday, The publican was very nice and friendly and the whiskey selection is one of the best in Toronto (Along with the Caledonian)"}
{"text":"For a steakhouse the steak was not too good. Ordered the 14 oz New York steak medium rare. Presentation was not great and the steak was a little too cooked. But the worst part was the steak was kind of cold and was not juicy. We also had the Fried Seafood as appetizer which was tasty.  The ambiance was nice, server was nice but wasn't around as frequent as I would like."}
{"text":"I like this bar because of it's staff. Anyone who ever watched 'Cheers' on TV, knows that the staff make the place. You feel like you can always chat to whomever is working or they'll share a little personal stuff that helps you to get to know them. I've only ever had drinks or eaten at the bar, so I can't comment on table service other than the high tops.  Prices are a little steep, being that it's a hotel lobby bar and the atmosphere is definitely dark. They recently opened a patio, but it's a little more than a smokehole since it doesn't get a lot of sun and when it does, there always seem to be buses or trucks parked for deliveries. Richmond St. isn't really prime patio real estate due to all of this as well as the traffic.  Having said all of that, I still prefer the pubby quaintness of Quinn's to it's sister bar, the Irish Embassy.  Food is definitely good. Great calamari, crab cakes and bar nibblies. Great bar crowd. It's difficult to show up at this place and not wind up in someone else's conversation."}
{"text":"Officially I would give this a 3 1/2 stars - better than a 3, but not quite a four.  The décor is an interesting blend of fine dining and pub experience, but what the heck, it works. Service is friendly, knowledgeable and fast. The wine list is reasonable with some decent choices. The food is good, and we both enjoyed our meals. My friend had the prime rib, which was very well prepared and quite tasty. I had the wagyu bavette, which was a gamble that didn't really pay off. Sure it's wagyu, but it's bavette, which is flank, and as a grilled steak, is just too tough to thoroughly enjoy. The real problem with this place is that The Keg is just a long block away, and they basically have this pricepoint steakhouse down pat. If Quinn's is going to survive, they need to do something to differentiate themselves from the Keg, because right now, the Keg is better."}
{"text":"We had a great meal....the server was friendly  and knowledgeable. The prime rib was medium rare just like I like. My better half enough enjoyed the peppercorn cooked yo perfection. The suggested wine complimented out meal  and creme brule was awesome as a final tada.  All was glutten fee which is awesome."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the most below average dining experiences I have ever had at a restaurant, even with the 50% off group buy it wasn't worth it.  The interior COULD be chic  (if you like that old congac and cigar feel) but it was dragged down by: -disgusting soiled carpets that are reminiscent of the cheap hotels in Vegas -Old cheap \"leather\" chairs that don't wear like fine leather -Children.. many of them... kind of spewing food everywhere and no servers to clean up tables that have LONG left -A kind of musty gross..children-leaving things sticky smell.  I don't know how they got the worst of BOTH the you and the old man smell (if either were to remain unbathed)- but yeah..they did it.  The food: we ordered th lamb, and duck entrees. The lamb was sooooo fatty and the risotto was more of a rice than a real risotto. The duck- there was NO meat on the duck.  it was dry   The grilled veggies it came with were waaay oily and roasted in the oven..but not even well.  Service: the servers were nice but just didn't care about their jobs. They brought plates but no cutlery.   Just a terrible experience.\"}
{"text":"Although this place has mixed reviews, I decided to try it out because I had stacked up a pretty good Groupon deal.  My boyfriend and I ended up sharing the Baby Back Pork Ribs and added-on a Broiled Nova Scotia Lobster Tail and Buttermilk Shoestring Onions. Overall, the food just barely made the cut for \"satisfactory\" but it was definitely not worth its high-end price point.   The complimentary starter bread was room-temperature and tough.  The ribs were just okay. Not very flavourful or tender, but edible.  The lobster tail was pretty good, but a bit too salty. The shoestring fries had a great taste, but the texture was too crunchy.   Service was fine, but a bit slow. So to summarize, I basically walked away from this meal thinking, \"Yeah, that was okay considering I used a Groupon but I'm never coming back\"."}
{"text":"Went for winterlicious. Had the steak frites. The steak was cooked to perfection (medium rare). The Caesar salad is like most that you could make at home. The spice cake was moist but had a bitter after taste."}
{"text":"I came in to the bar section of Quinn's and a friend and I sat at their bar doing drinks and food. We left feeling satisfied but I'm unlikely to make this a frequent drinking spot, I had a gift card of some sort to use up and if that wasn't the case I would feel pretty ripped off since their prices are very steep for a simple beer and food item. It is definitely priced to be a hotel bar than a standalone pub.   There was a drunk or just a very strange guy hanging around a certain corner of the bar who was muttering to himself and just breaking stuff like lamps and things hanging from the wall. It was completely random I felt bad for the staff that had to deal with him but no lasting harm was done. It did add a certain unforgettable memory to the experience.   But the staff were very friendly, the food was good and there were certainly a very well stocked bar. If you get the chance to splurge a little for a better than average pub I would definitely recommend Quinn's but for the casual diner/drinker there are certainly similar experiences to be had in the city for better prices."}
{"text":"Been to a lot of steak house. This is not one of the best. If people think Keg is 5 stars then this will be like 2 stars.  Most of the Kegs around downtown have good atmostphere. This one have none. The lay out is pretty lame. A new paint job will be nice :-)  The price is your typical steak house. Steak will be around 20 - 40 bucks.   The food is so so. I had lunch twice there just because I bought the group coupon certificate. $60.00 for $25.00. Since I am a NICE GUY I took couple of friend there for lunch.  Two of us had Steak Sandwich and the other choose fish and chip (Lunch Special). Order another side and the bill came up to 80 bucks with tips and taxes. LOL   If you are looking for cheap lunch this is not a place to go. I prefer street meat since I eat out every lunch and I can't afford 80 bucks lunch everyday. :-)  Bottom line. The place is good if you can get discount. For the price they are charging I am sure there are alot of places where you can stretch your dollar further.   'Yes, Stop the gravy train\" :-)  Cheers"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for the Winterlicious menu and I was super excited to eat here after seeing the menu. However, I was greatly disappointed with the food and even the service here.  First, our waitress seemed completely out of it! When we asked for something she would walk away before we even finished asking for it! Rudeness! She also gave some attitude when it came to the temperatures of the meat.   Now let's talk about the food! For the apps we both ordered the Caesar Salad. It was nothing spectacular but again not much you can do with caesar salad. For our main course, my boyfriend ordered the bacon wrapped beef tenderloin and requested the temp of his beef to be medium. His beef was not medium and in fact well done! Which annoyed the heck out of me since he got so much slack from the waitress. Now for my dish, I ordered the grilled spice rubbed Chicken supreme. The plating was nice but the flavour was lacking! The spice rub was inconsistent throughout the chicken and the cilantro was overpowering!   So all in all, not a great experience when it came to the food, service and just overall experience. With that being said, we won't be returning again in the future."}
{"text":"Yesterday, my half-sister, her father and I enjoyed an impeccable meal here. To start our visit, we could not find parking in the Sheraton Centre lot, but I will not let that affect my rating of the overall dining experience.  Our waitress definitely deserved her $25 tip; kind, on top of refills and clearing of our plates, menu knowledge and was very courteous.  There was no wait or line up, although we had a reservation we were half an hour late for (oops!). We were seated in a lovely, quiet, dimly lit (to perfection, if possible) octagon booth, where I started with a crisp Sauvignon Blanc while drooling over the menu. I ended up ordering the 8oz Ontario 'AAA' top sirloin steak, which I asked to add more grilled vegetables in place of mashed potatoes (personally, not a fan of high glycemic foods), while my sister and her father both ordered the prime rib with mashed potato and grilled vegetables. I chose to have my steak prepared rare. It was so juicy on the inside and and tender on the out (as I like it), I was salivating just looking at it!  My sister's prime rib was so succulent. I think I actually closed my eyes in content and fell into a taste-bud bliss. The grilled vegetables were like any other side to an appetizing steak, but were also very satisfying.  The portion of my \"extra vegetables\" (as expected at a pricey restaurant) was quite small I'm comparison of what \"extra\" meant on every other menu I've viewed in my past of dining.  Nonetheless, this place receives a 5 out of 5. The food was THAT good. The service was THAT good. If you have never been here before, make a reservation for your next date night! The ambiance makes for a great celebratory or romantic evening. :)"}
{"text":"Went there tonight for their winterlicious 2018 menu.  We had warm mushroom salad and Caesar salad for starters and they were both good.  We got bacon wrapped beef tenderloin neptune which was steak with shrimp and crab and asparagus with hollandaise on top of roasted garlic mash potatoes which was delicious.. we also got steak frites which was cooked to perfection.  It had this cafe de Paris on top of the steal which was like flavored butter that tasted too \"curry like\" for me but  I dislike curry in general so we traded steaks and everyone was happy.  Creme brulee for dessert was delicious but the brownie was so so. The service was excellent! Will come back to this place."}
{"text":"I was here last week.  The service was very good.  The food was also very good.  I went with 2 kids.  After ordering I heard the lady next to me tell the waiter that her filet was the best she ever had.  Good sign.  We had the braised lamb which I wished I had ordered - 7 year old loved it and nearly at it all.  13 year old had a steak which was good and I had the wagyu which was also good.  The side / veggies and dessert were excellent.  I would go back here again as I like the atmoshpere and the location.  The pub looked like a good time also."}
{"text":"I went on a date here once a while back and the date did not go that well so I don't remember the details all that great. What I do remember, however, is how bad the drinks were! I ordered the house special is was a drink with Vodka in it and it was terrible!   The food was actually decent, I had the steak with vegetables and for kicks I ordered some fries on the side. Who doesn't like to over pay for fries?!   Over the place was nice and the food good, the drinks were really bad!   #30daysofyelp"}
{"text":"Came here for Summerlicious with a big group of 15. The service was the first, but not the last thing to amaze me about Quinn's. The staff were very friendly and attentive - with each course, the waiter, without hesitation, delivered each of our dishes to all 15 of us. The courses were all timed perfectly too. That was impressive.   On to the food, I had the Corn and Sweet Pepper Chowder. It was very creamy and the corn and pepper flavours were prominent. For the main course, I had the Gaelic Rib Steak. The presentation for this dish was amazing, and the taste was equally as impressive. The steak was a perfect medium rare, and was accompanied by some of the best potato chips I've ever tasted (yes, potato chips). Lastly, I had the Blackberry and Ontario Rhubarb Crisp for dessert. Nothing to say about this dish, but it was a great way to top off a great meal.  Quinn's was well worth the price, and I will be sure to return."}
{"text":"Amazing Prime Rib.  Good atmosphere and great service.  I am looking forward to going back and trying a different steak.  I would like to have a couple of more visits to be able to rate this place a 5 star."}
{"text":"Tourist trap with ridiculous prices for subpar food. The cheapest steak on the menu was worse than what you would find at a corner diner. The lobster mac was kraft mac and cheese with tiny lobster claw meat. I dont know if it was because we used a groupon or because we made a late reservation but this place was a scam. They even have 2 menus, one for the tourist and groupon suckers and one for the bar folk. AVOID."}
{"text":"Forgot to finish this review!  Came here last week Thursday with coworkers to take advantage of their Winterlicious menu.  I must say for a first timer to Quinn's, the ambience is really cozy pub-restaurant you can take a date to.  The staff are actually from IRELAND! and they're always accomadating to any requests.  I ordered the set menu, Beef Barley, Steak Frites with Cafe du Paris sauce and Chocolate brownie cake for dessert.   Overall, the dishes were cooked to perfection, and complimented my glass of rioja! I will definitely be back again Quinn."}
{"text":"Was actually really pleasantly surprised by this place. Went there because they looked like they had an interesting Summerlicious menu 2011. The three of us decided to take one of each of the three Summerlicious dishes and make pseudo tapas. We told the waitress as much and she must have told the kitchen because they actually were served that way to us. The food was good, the service was excellent--they provided anything we asked for (eg., vinegar and oil for the bread) even after my companions waffled painfully over the wine list. the food was good. The steak was actually our least-favorite dish. The wasabi-crusted fish and spiced chicken were much better, the chicken being our table's favorite. Though, and this is a small thing, the mashed potatoes that came with the steak were to die for. Rabbit rillet was fine, cheese selection was interesting, but the dark cake--some kind of booze in it, can't remember which--was amazing!"}
{"text":"Came here shortly before a $50 groupon expired. Nearly forgot I had the darn thing. The burger is a mite pricey. A great thing to order if you're here with an aunt and uncle visiting from out of town and they're picking up the tab. Hardcore whiskey drinkers will be, I think, impressed with the extensive list. Service is great. Dark and intimate.  It's fun to pop over to the Shopsy's side and check out all the old photos, back when I guess Shopsy's was something other than a crap place to get a crap sandwich. Henny Youngman? *tears*"}
{"text":"Had the Winterlicious 2016 dinner menu.  For appy, I had the Warm Wild Mushroom Salad, it was delicious and probably the best part of my meal.  My friend had the Goat Cheese-Stuffed Portobello for entree.  The name of the dish was misleading as it was just a tiny piece of portobello sitting on top of a bed of pasta.  We would expect the goat cheese-stuffed portobello to be the star of the dish, but she only got PART of the portobello mushroom.  I ordered Steak Frites, which came out to be a good medium rare.  The frites on the other hand were on the burnt side and the plating was a bit sloppy.  For dessert, we had the Berry Almond  Crumble.  It was decent, nothing exciting.    The service was alright. Our server was not particularly friendly; seemed like he wanted us to order and get on with it.  Overall my experience was just okay."}
{"text":"This steakhouse is at the bottom of the Sheraton Centre hotel in downtown Toronto, across from the City Hall.  Somehow, another deli (Shopseys) is connected to it, although how are the two different or separate I am not sure.   Quinn's looks like a typical pub inside, but they have private rooms for events, one of which we used.  They add automatic 17.5% tip on parties larger than 6, which is OK I guess.  We had different steaks, myself had surf and turf, which was pretty good, but not the best I've had.  The steak was a bit overcooked and the size seemed smaller than advertised, but it was quite tasty.  My party had different steaks, like Japanese Kobe-beef style, file mignon and others, and they were all very good, though still not at the level of Morton's for example.  The service was excellent and all staff was very attentive."}
{"text":"Went here for winterlicious with a large group (16+ people). Waiter was extremely rude and looked pissed the whole time (we were very civilized the whole time, no one was drinking heavily). She also told us not to get out of our seats (we did this so we could talk to other people also in the room instead of shouting across the table)   What makes Quinn really a 1 star restaurant is the fact that they DO NOT SERVE WHAT THEY PROMISE ON THE MENU. AVOID THIS RESTAURANT AND ESP THE LOBSTER MAC N CHEESE.  We ordered the lobster mac and cheese and instead of lobster we got imitation crab meat. Yes the frozen churned-up fish chum that you buy at grocery stores for cheap that literally unravel into a thin sheet of meat. I get that some restaurants advertise \"crab\" and give you crab meat, which is still unethical but whatever. But to advertise LOBSTER  and give imitation crab meat is a totally different story. Mans aint paying $20+ for an entree and trying to get imitation crab meat that i can just buy and prepare myself at home."}
{"text":"I have to compliment the manager Scott and his staff for taking care of us planning an event for $40. Scott was thorough, responsive, helpful and invited us for lunch to taste the fare before booking. Of the six restaurants in the FinDist that I called no one else offered this. Easy today with Scott. We wrapped up the details super quick then he served us two entrees split plus salads. Awesome Scott and crew. Our waitress was attentive and friendly and the food was outstanding. I'd like a little less fatty prime rib but the friZled onion rings, mouth watering mashed taters and veg - Brussel sprouts, green beams and baby carrots. Yum. Great location. Perfect rooms for smalll groups."}
{"text":"Great steakhouse!! Service was fantastic, and steak itself was great as well.  The con is that the inside is too dim and I think the competitors around the area has better price and interior."}
{"text":"We did a re-visit to Quinn's this past week.  It's still a very solid location for a steak, although there are some others in the city that probably rank higher for me.  Having said that, very reasonable and worth the visit --aka equals great value for the money!  The server was knowledgeable about wine and recommended the McManis Cab Sauv --- a solid choice --- we loved it with our food.  Also, I had the warm mushroom salad (arugula).  This was outstanding!  Very flavorful with lots of great, meaty pieces of all different kinds of mushrooms -- the seasoning was fantastic.  We had the rib eyes and were both cooked perfectly accompanied by mashed potatoes and a nice vegetable medley.  Even though the place was hopping (aka very busy), service was attentive! If you want a solid steak dinner at a great price downtown - check it out!"}
{"text":"Called to make a lunch reservation for winterlicious on the 15th, but when I called today to confirm the reservation, they told me that the reservation didn't even go through.  They then continued to tell me that they do not even HAVE a lunch menu for winterlicious like excuse me...check the winterlicious site, you have a lunch menu do you think I would be reserving for something nonexistent? What a waste of time, I could have reserved at another place.    Would give no stars if possible."}
{"text":"Summerlicious menu on the site has 'desserts' misspelled, and service when you're actually there is awkward, with completely fine food, but unfortunately sound carries both from the bar and other tables, making it cacophonous despite being nearly empty."}
{"text":"Waiter was friendly but slow, only serving 3 tables but still slow.  Steak was delicious and perfectly prepared but bleu cheese added on top was incredibly salty and ruined steak.  Bread tasted like day old store bought whole wheat loaf.  Might try again but would not recommend to anyone I liked."}
{"text":"Great food with awesome service, just before the St. Paddy's rush.  Nice bit of quiet time with my wife thanks to Louise and her family.  I had a prime rib burger which was cooked perfectly on a buttered bun, delicious fries on the side and a couple of Guinesses to wash it all down."}
{"text":"The place is deserted. The steak is average. The wine is mediocre. The prices are huge."}
{"text":"This little gem is hidden away at the Sheraton City Centre! We arrived to cheer on our favourite hockey team beat the bruins in a playoff hockey game 6! Our waiter Brennan went above and beyond to make sure that we were comfortable and happy; even when he was off for the night he stopped by before leaving to make sure that we were still enjoying ourselves. We stayed for lunch and dinner. We shared a plate of nachos and enjoyed the combination that was prepared. My colleague had the steak and baked potato from the steakhouse menu and I had the portobello mushroom pasta. The steak was a little more pink than expected but a non-issue. The \"wheel house\" was the choice of beer for the day/evening with a glass of wine each for dinner. I would definitely come back here again it is affordable and very handy if you are staying at the Sheraton."}
{"text":"The service was fine but the steak was dry. With office ceilings I don't know how the prices here are justified. This place has no character. Not going to come here again."}
{"text":"Came for summerlicious, was very impressed by the food, 3.5 for me. My fellow companions thought it was just okay. Last time I came was way back in 2011/2012 for Winterlicious and I remember feeling not the best (2/5?), so really glad they stepped it up.  We came as a party of 8, some of us were late so we didn't have a chance to order until really late since the server was generally absent.  I got the mushroom salad which was delicious. The mushroom and cheese were rich and balanced the faint bitterness of the rocket and freshness of the tart vinaigrette really well. I generally hate any bitterness in my salads, but the abundance of \"meaty\" mushrooms and mellow cheese took it all away. I just wished there was more of it.  The bacon wrapped tenderloin was perfect for me. Portions run small for a guy. Perfect medium rare and well seasoned. Bacon itself don't taste of much but gave good character to the steak. Veggies were cut too big and a lil hard to eat. But the MASH OMG, smooth as a puree and was tasty by itself or with the sauce. The sauce was a thick with the consistency and taste of a light beef gravy but looked like a thick demi glaze...couldn't put my finger on it, but was beautiful. My boyfriend got a prime rib on the regular menu and it was a perfect cook as well. Other diners weren't too impressed by the salmon dish and steak frites, mostly cause the cooks were off or the garnishes didn't taste good.  Dessert was okay, nothing too special. Server wasn't too attentive but nothing that would ruin your night. She also didn't add the 18% as advertised for larger groups.  One of our friends found a piece of gum on the chair that got stuck to his pants. She swapped the chair, provided napkins and took his beer off the tab. So I think some brownie points on the service."}
{"text":"After finding most restaurants telling us there would be a half hour wait for dinner on Friday night, my fiance and I wandered down to Queen Street and found this hidden gem for some serious eating and calm (romantic, even!) atmosphere.   I wasn't planning on eating a steak, but Nick sure was. He said his was one of the best he's ever had. I got the chicken supreme which was doused in fresh tomato sauce and olives, served with surprisingly tasty couscous and veggies. I was also impressed by the waitress' reaction when I ordered a caesar with tequila instead of vodka - instead of a confused \"yeah... I guess you can do that\" she exclaimed \"you can do whatever you want!\" That's what I want to hear every time I order a drink!"}
{"text":"The steak itself was flavoursome, New York Striploin is that way.  It was also fatty, I suppose it's that way too, but not normaly quite that much.  It  wouldn't have been so bad except it was covered in crispy floured onions which were hugely fatty, the fries were some of the worst examples of Canadian home fries which are noirmally bad being  soggy, limp, blackened, potato shards with bits of skin on, but here especially so.  They can be good, not great but good, here they were awful.     I left some $60 lighter, feeling slightly sick because of the grease intake and wishing I had gone to Ruth's Chris or waited until The Keg had a table open.  Despite the service, whcih was quite good, I won't be coming here again."}
{"text":"We went to Quinn's steakhouse for their winterlicious special. Quinn's is a large restaurant with a pub in front and a dining room in the back. The restaurant is tastefully decorated. It was full for Friday's night.  I started with the warm mushroom salad. It was tasty. For the entree, I had to the teriyaki salmon dish. It was well cooked and delicious. I had the creme brulee for dessert. It was delicious.  Service was friendly and efficient. For a chain restaurant, the food was good."}
{"text":"I'm changing my rating because the first time I was here, I was a little disappointed by the steak and said the only way I'd come back was for appetizers and their extensive drinks menu.   Well, I did!   I still the steak that I had was a bit disappointing, but their drinks menu more than makes up for it. I came here tonight with my boyfriend. We were in the area, had eaten and drank a bit earlier, but still wanted a little more food and drinks.   \"Hey, remember that two-page cocktail menu at Quinn's? And it's right down the street!\"   Sold.  We tried four new cocktails this time, and they were all amazing. Well, I didn't quite enjoy the Creamsicle but that's a taste preference. We sat at the bar, and ordered sweet potato fries as well. The chipotle mayo here is still to die for. The bartender was super friendly as was the hostess, and the atmosphere is really relaxed.   I'm glad I came back. Would I order the steak again? Probably not, but there's still...oh, I don't know...at least 25 cocktails I haven't tried? ;)"}
{"text":"Great place for a weekday lunch customer meeting as it has the right atmosphere where you can clearly hear each other.  I had an endive salad which was pretty bland.  The salmon dish was quite good as there was quite alot of flavours from both the salmon and the veggies."}
{"text":"We just came here for St. Pat's and had a good time.  We didn't eat, but the beers were good and this was a fun crowd...but I don't know how it would be if it wasn't an Irish party in an Irish pub."}
{"text":"Service is 2/5 Food is 3.5 Ambiance is 3  Despite the average ratings on yelp, we still came here for winterlicious.  Food isn't too bad. For starters, I got the duck liver pate. It was delicious and velvety. For main I got the steak frites. The steak was definitely the highlight of the meal. I always loved my steak to be medium rare and they just cooked it to perfection. Steak was juicy and tender. Even though I'm not a fries person, I was a bit disappointed as the fries were a bit too dry and bland. (Mcd fries taste better imo..)  For dessert, I got creme brûlée. It was very custardy and sweetened to perfection - not too sweet and not too light. Delicious!   Not sure what's up with our waitress but she wasn't giving us a friendly vibe. She never smiled nor refilled our water. When I used my card to pay, she literally threw the receipt on the table. At that moment I regret tipping her."}
{"text":"Went for winterlicious here and it wasn't a great experience.   2/5 stars for the food  Lets talk about food. I chose the soup of the day (corn chowder), with the bacon wrapped tenderloin and Irish whiskey spice cake for dessert.  The corn chowder was ok. Nothing too great but not too bad. No complaints about it. The bacon wrapped tenderloin was a disappointment mostly coz I saw a picture of the same dish in 2013 and it had 2 pieces of the tenderloin and here I had only one. Had a couple of beans along with a scarce portion of mash potato. I ordered medium rare and tasted more like medium.  Irish whiskey spice cake wasn't too grand as well. Decided to choose it over the cheesecake (coz i feel eat that a lot) and...my friend kept raving about his cheesecake while i was disappointed with my choice. It did not taste that flavorful.   2.5/5 stars for the service  Our waiter wasn't that great to ask questions to. Not sure if he didnt know the answer but saying a straight forward answer or an I don't know is always better than giving a sarcastic one. Also I understand that it gets busy but acting in a rush to get our payments done quickly and not hiding that fact is...ridiculous. Plus he asked a friend to finish off our payments.  In the end it feels as though i should've skipped the winterlicious menu and just stuck with the regular menu. Maybe I might've enjoyed the surf and turf but that again is debatable. a friend ordered the stuffed mushroom from the regular menu and all he got was 1 small mushroom surrounded by whatever it came with. For it being called a \"steakhouse\" it doesn't feel any better than montanas or kelseys."}
{"text":"Meh.  To be fair, we had a corporate event here and it was a set menu to choose from so I didn't get to choose from the entire dining experience.  The staff were ok - the drink selection (wine specifically) were limited but I don't think the establishment was meant to be super fancy in that respect.     Food was ok and the ambience was more akin to bar and grill - which was a little of a surprise for me given its a hotel restaurant.   I'd recommend trying it once but understand that walking out to the streets there are likely a ton of other restaurants to choose from."}
{"text":"To be honest, I normally would never choose this kind restaurant for a night out; steakhouse, meh unless we are talking Jacob's. But I had a gift certificate for $50 so I figured why the heck not?  We made six o'clock reservations and the place was busy.  We had to wait a bit to be shown to our table, but eventually someone acknowledged that we were standing there and seated us.  Our booth was fine but in a busy corridor.  Our server took a very long time to come take our drink order, but she was very personable so I didn't hold it against her.  I was also impressed with the selection and price point of the wine.  A decent Chianti was $13 for a 9 oz glass.  We both ordered the steak frites.  A basket of bread arrived to tide us over; it was nothing special but it served. When the food arrived, the steak was decently prepared, very rare as requested.  It had a good flavour, but I had a number of very chewy bits.  The cafe de Paris butter and the lemon aioli were decent.  I wasn't a big fan of the fries.  They were a thicker cut and were served with the steak resting on top of them.  I found them under cooked and the steak made them a bit soggy.  I did not feel compelled to finish my meal."}
{"text":"Came here for 2017 winterlicious with a group of 9. I didn't have too high of an expectation due to the dated decor and uninteresting menu on the website.   Food was surprisingly good though. I ordered the 7oz steak with fries and the meat was cooked perfectly. Juicy, moist and thick! The app and dessert were not ok, the green salad tasted something I can put together at home in 15 seconds.  The berry crumble I got was way too sweet and hard.  Service was horrible, they were severely understaffed and our waters were not refilled once. Coffee or tea were not asked at the end of our meal (I don't know... I feel like this should be asked when you're asking for 18% gratuity from a corporate group?). We literally had to wait 20 minutes for the server to come with his machine after we asked for the bill.  I would not recommend this place at all if you are looking for something different and interesting. Their steak was done really well though, my party generally enjoyed their food a lot. Overall, I'd say Quinn's is your average neighborhood bar.   Overall Experience: 3/5 Service: 2/5 Food: 3.5/5 Ambiance: 2/5 Value: 3.5/5"}
{"text":"We went to Quinn's using a 50$ Groupon. Had reservations at 6:30. Our waitress was very attentive--at first. Tuna Tataki (an appetizer we ordered) was fantastic! But we never saw our waitress again until the bill came. We had to ask the guy clearing our table for the bill, and that was after waiting 15 minutes. It was my birthday so this was to be a special occasion. In fact, we came here from Minnesota USA to celebrate. I had the lobster, and my husband had the prime rib. It was good but not fantastic. The wait staff were really catering to a certain table. My husband asked who it was. Turned out it was their marketing guy. Hmm, cater to an employee over a tourist? (By the way, my husband is the President of a downtown Minneapolis bank.) Doesn't seem very logical."}
{"text":"This place is unexpectedly \"off the hook\".  First off, this place is a tad hard to find. It is in the Sheraton hotel, on the south east side of the building on the main level. If you see Traders in there just keep on walking east and you'll see it.  This place is really unique because it is advertised as a Steakhouse and an Irish pub, and to top it all off, it serves Shopsy's menu food.  When you walk into the place, on the left is the bar area, if you walk straight there is the dining room for Quinn's, and if you walk to the right there is a dining room for Shopsy's. I could be wrong about all this as I didn't soak the whole atmosphere in (as I was in the bar). They have about 10 taps of beer or so, regular stuff for an Irish pub, but they have Guiness that needs to be pumped from the keg (1st time I've seen this).  On to the food....amazing! My wife had the steak sandwich she said was the best she's ever had, and I went with the more old school smoked turkey Shopsy's sandwich with fries. I asked if I could have some of their curry sauce on the fries. That curry sauce was good and the sandwich was exactly like I remember from Shopsy's.  Although I'm not a whiskey drinker, for those that are they have a 2 sided menu full of different whiskey choices. The bar staff is great and I will definitely be returning to this place."}
{"text":"Came here  with my friends for Winterlicious and   my experience  was very  good. However for  the rest of my  group the results were hit and miss .   I got the  Mushroom Salad,  Lamb Shank & the Irish Whiskey Spice Cake .  Rating for my food is 4/5. I recommend you  get them . Deducting two points for my concerns below  Bread Basket  needed improvement. The breads were long and oblong  and we had to use our hands to break it apart. Take a page from the baskets provided by Sassafraz, Auberge, for example . Mushroom Salad: Very flavorful salad with a mild flavoured toscano cheese that did not overpower the salad like a parmesan or cheddar  would. My only  concern was the salad portion could have been  larger by a third .  Lamb Shank : The Lamb Shank was better than expected. The shank was  large atop a mountain of  barley risotto. I loved the uniqueness of the dish. The  lamb was  very soft and  literally fell of the bone when I cut  it . I  had seen pictures of the dish on yelp and  this dish lived up to the hype.  Irish Whiskey Spice Cake: The cake  tasted pleasant although it could have been  a bit softer   with  more amount of whiskey added into it .   Service:  It began on a good note and went bad. For me it was a 7/10, for my other friends a 2/10. Our server answered  our questions. I was happy with  his answers , however  he was a bit  rushed with his service towards my friends , and was not giving a straight forward answer.  It took  15 minutes for our desserts to arrive  and the bills  could have arrived faster.   Ambience: The lighting was very poor and we had a hard time seeing each other and taking pictures of the food. We had to resort to using flash which was very annoying for us.  Please increase the lighting  so that it is lit well .    Vegetarian friendly (0/10):  One of my friends,  had to switch out of ordering from the winterlicious menu due to a lack of vegetarian main options. He ended up ordering the Goat Cheese-Stuffed Portobello    which  is on the winterlicious menu as an a la carte item . It was an extreme disappointment.  This dish  amounted to false advertising . It was labelled as \"Goat Cheese-Stuffed Portobello with Woolwich Ontario goat cheese, penne pasta, sun-dried tomato, pesto sauce, broccolini\". What my friend received was nothing like the dishes name  He got   a tiny morsel of goat cheese stuffed portobello  on top of a  mound of penne pasta. My friend paid for the portobello and not penne pasta. He did not deserve such a horrible dining experience.  and I am urging everyone not to order this dish unless changes are made for it. It is very unfair to neglect the vegetarian customers .They have potential to spend on lots of  money if more options are made available to them .  Overall good place   to dine out with friends  looking for  some good food, BUT  please   increase the lighting , show  lots of appreciation to your vegetarian customers. They must get a three course menu of pub style  food using vegetarian items . and get the servers  to work faster to reduce  on waiting times  for food items. Hire more staff if needed.  In fact I will even suggest to you a three course alternate  vegetarian menu  as an idea to work from so that vegetarians will never suffer like my friend did  Starters: 1 Salad of the day with  a third more of salad   on the plate. ( choice of 3 salads)                2 Choice of garlic, sweet potato , or polenta fries with a choice of sauce/aioli                3 Soup of the day with generous amounts of vegetables added in   Mains  In fact the mains can be the same as what you have  on winterlicious but  substitute any meat with a vegetable that would compliment the recipe . For example use seitan or tofu instead of chicken /beef/seafood.   Instead of bacon, use vegetarian bacon  . The quantity of  seitan and tofu will remain the same as what it would have been were it meat. The portobello dish will  have much more  portobellos in it.  Using the Guinness  braised lamb shank as a reference how about using the same amount of meat  (not including bone)  as portobellos for the portobello dish.  Vegetarian customers will greatly appreciate it    Desserts: Keep the same desserts as those are very good and appeal to everyone. Consider increasing the portions for that .   My group and I  will definitely return  if such improvements are made ."}
{"text":"Went to this steakhouse because I've never done steak.. The meat tasted fine, but I was not amused by the small \"restaurant portion\". So I ordered a second meal to go, and the pasta with goat cheese and mushrooms wasn't bad..still a lil too small and crazy greasy. Also, I'd say the service was a tad bit on the slow side.."}
{"text":"I just went here last weekend while I stayed at the Sheraton Centre for a dance congress... I found this bar to be pretty hip and had a great selection of pub style food. I ordered a drink called \"The Black Velvet\" It was half Guinness and half Cider. I enjoyed it very much and was shocked at how the two went together. The cider made the guinness feel light. I decided on the prime rib burger as my main. When the waitress asked how I wanted it cooked I must have given her a puzzled look because she then gave me her suggestion to have it cooked to medium well which I took her up on that offer. It was seasoned quite well and seemed to be a little more on the well done side but i didn't mind. I found the portion to be a great size, didn't leave me wanting more or made me too full to move. The display of the food was also presented in a well way.   I found the bar to be your typical bar... low lit, high tables and a great selection of beverages on tap as well as in bottles. The layout was well situated and the waitresses were on top of their game as soon as I sat down the lady came to clean my table and wipe it down before even thinking about taking my order. I liked that.   If i'm staying at this hotel again I wouldn't mind going back but I wouldn't make a special trip downtown for this place."}
{"text":"I don't know why the rate for Quinn's is just 3 star! All my guests are love their food! We are lucky to have their winterlicious, but the food is so good! Love the steak, pasta, and New york Cheesecake ( Berry topping is the best!)   Winterlicious is $38 per person, with a starter, entre, and dessert. We are so full after the dinner, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This was the perfect place for an afternoon snack and drinks after a lot of walking around town.  We had a seat at the bar and began to look over the beer selections.  I was in the mood to try something new.  Our awesome bartender suggested Creemore Springs Premium Lager.  It was the perfect selection - great beer and definitely new to me.    We ordered the Charcuterie to snack on while we sipped on our beer.  There were several TVs playing sports which was the World Cup playoffs at this time.  We had a fantastic afternoon break with great beer, great snacks, and watching soccer.  I would highly recommend this place any time you want to chill and hang out."}
{"text":"Fantastic dinner highly recommended To Us by several people and it did not disappoint the special and the appetizers were out of this world our server Breanna was very attentive and answered all our questions and took great care of us highly recommended"}
{"text":"Made reservation for this place for 8:15.   8:15 - checked in, told hostess I reserved a spot for 8:15. Hostess tells me it'll be a 15 min wait because they're still clearing tables. 8:30 - went back to the hostess, she tells me it'll be a 15 min wait. I pointed out to her she said that already when I checked in earlier. She then talks to another worker and decided to seat us. When they brought us in to the dinning area. They had a bunch of empty tables so I don't know why she couldn't have seated us earlier. And what's the point of taking reservations if your going to make us wait. No apologies what so ever!   The food was good. Love the atmosphere and decor but I would not come back here again."}
