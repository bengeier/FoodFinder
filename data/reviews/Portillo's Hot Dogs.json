{"text":"We haven't been to one in years, we were sadly disappointed. Our burgers were still pretty pink in the middle, and with 4 children, that was not a good thing. Fries were cold, our food sat in the window for the longest time because they couldn't figure out if our order was ready or not. Not impressed with the place at all."}
{"text":"I like the basic burger and onion rings, which they do very well. Price wise, its also a deal. The ordeal is with the double line they always form to order is awful and likewise with the pickup area, always crowded and not functional."}
{"text":"Our finicky kids love the hotdogs, fries and onion rings.   Outdoor patio is busy but nice and clean.   Salads (Mediterranean and apple/walnut) were a good size and we all left with full bellies. Maybe it was the chocolate and strawberry milkshakes that put us over the top.   Thick and creamy!  Salads are prepared and served at a different area of the restaurant so it can be hard to grab everything when it's crowded and you have little kids in tow.    Will visit again!"}
{"text":"Ladies and Gentlemen,  I've tried Portillo's a couple of times, was drawn to it by the hype. If you're looking for some REAL CHICAGO STYLE EATS....Then you have to go to Dazzo's Dog House on west Glendale. I really think that there is no other place in the valley that honestly can say that they are authentic Chicago Style. My family and I have been going  to Dazzo's for over 30 years. A true gem in the Valley, well worth the drive from anywhere in the Valley. Just the Italian Ice alone is worth the drive. I promise you that you won't regret it one bit."}
{"text":"If I lived closer to this place, I would be morbidly obese. 
The italian beef here is the best I've ever had, and the dogs are top notch too. The wife and kid thought the chicken was amazing as well."}
{"text":"Well hello portillos.....it's been a long time coming....
This place is the best when it comes to Italian beefs.   Don't forget to tell them to dipp it bring on the peppers.  Oh and chocolate cake shake on the side....
Now lets just wait for Harold's chicken :)"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The Chicago dogs are amazing, as is Italian beef. Nice, fast service, delicious food, and get this, it's cheaper than the takeout place next to my house! Bottled water is 69Â¢! Can you believe it! It's cheaper than most fast food places (and the food is a million times better too). Everybody should get to eat here. Oh, and just a quick tip, if you like strawberries, the strawberry shortcake is absolutely to die for."}
{"text":"I've come here multiple times with my family and we all love it! They're beef is really good. I get their Italian sausage every time I come because it is soooo good! Their French fries are pretty good too. The atmosphere in the restaurant is friendly and fun and it's pretty big too so come with as many people as you want. I definitely recommend this place to all of my friends"}
{"text":"Of the last 4 visits to this Portillo's, 3 of my orders have been incorrect. That's right a 75% error rate in topping or counting hot dogs! It's actually worse, as sometimes they'll make multiple mistakes, just to keep things interesting. 

If you're eating at the restaurant, they'll fix the problem but certainly don't count on a good attitude about it, and don't expect an apology silly customer! If you're ordering at the drive through, you'd better unwrap and inspect your food before leaving to ensure you got what you ordered. Topping hot dogs is complicated stuff after all, apparently so is counting.

Food is OK, apparently brings back memories for Chicago transplants. But the unengaged, unhappy staff screams poor management that can't be overcome by any amount of nostalgic signs and photos and makes for a poor dining experience. Do yourself a favor and look at other Chicago style hot dog restaurants on Yelp, you'll find some that serve great food, with a great attitude, served by happy people who can both top hot dogs AND count !"}
{"text":"I always come here when I need something to eat last minute. The service is great! Everyone is unbelievably nice! (5 star service) The food is good too. I wouldn't say it's amazing, but it's good for a quick bite. I order a chili dog and chili. So my rating is for those two items."}
{"text":"The food was pretty excellent.  A bit of pinch to get an soda refills though.  Otherwise, was a nice experience.  Love the 50's decor!"}
{"text":"The best hot dogs in the world hands down. The restaurant is clean and very family friendly"}
{"text":"i know that portillos is known for their hot dogs and italian beef but i must say that their salads are great! a little disorganized in the drive through but that was during their opening week, i have been back since and am happy to say that the food and service are A1.  reminds me of back home."}
{"text":"This place has the best hot dogs and Beefs in the Phoenix area. I also really like how fast there service is and will never go to another place to get a hot dog. Really brings me back to my days in Chicago."}
{"text":"Without a doubt, the best burgers, hotdogs, and sandwiches in AZ - if not all of the USA. GO!"}
{"text":"I think this place opened this spring and every time I drive by it's packed, so I had to find out what all the hoopla was about! I chose to go to the drive thru it's always busy too , The place was jammin on a Saturday afternoon. 
The young girl at the drive thru greeted me, I mentioned that I had never been here before what did she recommend? She said they were famous for their Chicago Beef sandwiches and of course the Hot Dogs. I wasn't feeling too risky so I chose a hot dog and french fries with a coke. I waited till I got home to dig in. 
Well now I know what all the HOOPLA'S about! Best darn hot dog and fries I've ever had!! The french fries are amazing. It's been a week and I'm still thinking about them. (I may have to join a 12 step program because of those fries, so GOOD) Hot Dog was delish. Juicy , hot , and perfect condiments. I shared the fries with a friend, she too enjoyed them as much as I had, in fact she couldn't stop thinking about them either so she stopped in a few days later to get her Portillo's Fix!  Oh and one more thing, they serve the soft drinks in Styrofoam which I love, it keeps your drink super cold and prevents the ice from melting. Love this Place next time, I'm having the onion rings !"}
{"text":"I am not quite sure what the hype is on this place....food was good but nothing worth ranting and raving over. I had the Italian beef which was good. My daughter got a cheeseburger that was literally soaked in oil(seriously there was a pool of grease in the container it came in). All in all it was ok."}
{"text":"Ate there about a month ago and have been meaning to write a review, but couldn't remember the name of the place. Good food, good service, but definitely not AS AMAZING as everyone says, but we are in AZ and everything is relative, so maybe I should be giving them 5 stars. Is 4.5 an option? And who is the pea brained moron who gave them a 1 star?"}
{"text":"This is the cheapest Portillo's ever I am from Chicago and there serving here in Az is cheap this is there combo wow and the manger started arguing with me saying that how it's served"}
{"text":"First visit here.  For a busy Saturday, it didn't take long to order and be served.  Nice, casual atmosphere.

We had the jumbo chili dog and fries.

And, of course I couldn't get out without a little ice cream.  So I had the chocolate malt, which was delicious.

Great visit.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"My boss surprised our office with portillos and it was the most amazing hotdog place, took me back to the times i was a kid playing in chicago. this place blows all the other hotdog places out the water. Please avoid hometown dogs worse experience ever just drive the extra miles for an amazing dog from this fine establishment awesome customer service as well."}
{"text":"Two words: Italian Beef. Get it dipped with hot peppers, and your life will never be the same. I live for Italian Beef sandwiches, and this place knows how to make them. Add their tasty fries and you have yourself a very, very good meal. The wait is not too bad even when they are packed because the staff are fast-paced and high-energy. Seating is pretty ample, too, and of the three times I've been since they opened, it's always been a great experience. Next time, I'll have to give the hot dogs a try, but it's so hard to skip on the beef..."}
{"text":"A little slice of Chicago heaven.  We were so happy when Portillo's came to Arizona.
Delicious Italian beef sandwiches,  hot dogs, burgers and salads.  It's a regular stop for us!"}
{"text":"Italian beef so good you'll cry. This place was packed! And for good reason. Yep it's just that good."}
{"text":"I love this place. When I first came to Arizona, this is one of the first places I came too, so it has a nice feeling for me. the food is good, I very much like the hot dogs. It within Tempe Marketplace, so you can come here after shopping or a movie. 

The people are really nice here too."}
{"text":"The food is authentic but the service is awful. If you go through the drive through always check your bag first because nine times out of 10 your order will be wrong. I don't think that I have ever had an incorrect order at Portillo's until this location opened up. They are not as fast as the Illinois locations. Pretty disappointing."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to splurge.  I get the big beef (Italian beef sandwich but bigger than the regular) with hot peppers and \"dunked\" in the beef drippings.  It comes out so moist and flavorful that my mouth is watering just thinking about it.  Their French fries are also great, crispy and hot with just the right amount of salt.  I have tried their burgers and salads as well and they are okay, but I think I will just stick with the beef sandwiches from now on."}
{"text":"I was in Chicago recently and went to the downtown location for a quick meal. I had the Italian beef and a friend had a hot dog.  I regretted not coming back to try a hot dog but, after learning there was a Portillo's in Scottsdale, I figured I'd get one back home.

And I did.  I went here with the same friend. The restaurant's interior looks a lot like the Portillo's in Chicago except it's smaller and newer. This is one of those, walk up to a counter and place your order and then wait until your number is called along with something clever that rhymes with your number, \"43 come and see me\" (the woman in Chicago was much better, the guy in Scottsdale just didn't have his heart in it). You then sit in their large seating area. 

My friend got the Italian beef and I got a jumbo hotdog with everything.  Some comparisons - the Italian beef I got in Chicago was tasty but it was was very wet. I mean, running down your arm when you picked it up wet. The Italian beef here was moist but wasn't dripping.  The hotdog was OK. This was my first Chicago-style dog so maybe I just didn't know what to expect. It's a fat beef hotdog with mustard and there are sliced onions, pickles, peppers, etc just laying in the bun along with the hotdog. It was good, just not what I was used to.  My friend said she preferred the Italian beef over the hotdog she got in Chicago. I concur.

On the plus side - $20 for an Italian beef, a jumbo hotdog, a shared side of onion rings and two soft drinks! Nice deal."}
{"text":"What a fun restaurant! Atmosphere is casual. Staff is friendly. Food is fresh and delicious"}
{"text":"The only thing good there was their salads. The burgers and the chicken sandwich stunk. The cashier was to busy talking to his friends and keep asking us what we said. I will never go back to this one, was not worth my money and or time."}
{"text":"I work next door and often send my associates to pick me up food here with my card. It's always delicous. Today I work a ten hour shift with one 30 minute break and went over myself.i wasted my break in line only to be denied at the end because my card wasn't signed and my purse was at my store in our safe room. This is the same card people have used to pick me up food and not once were they denied. So this was ridiculous. I'm never going back to this location. Though I can appreciate the security of it, they need to be consistent as I had no idea I'd need my id."}
{"text":"just like portillos at home. i actually didnt know the portillios opened in az until a friend from work said hey your from chicago every eat at portillios? the next day we ran out to the scottsdale location and its just like home! they now have 2 locations here and i wish they had one in downtown phx. but we still make the drive to eat there about once a month. both locations are true to their chicago roots. last time i went thru the drive through there was a long wait and they gave me 2 free deserts. i did not expect that as i was going through at dinner time and there was a long line. i knew there would be a long wait. which really wasnt that long. i think from the time i ordered to the time i picked up my food was maybe 10 or 15 min.  this isnt mcdonalds so i would expect to wait. ive been to both the tempe and scottsdale location many times and i have to say the staff there are so nice and respectful."}
{"text":"i grew up outside of chicago and used to go the villa park one a with my parents all the time.  I was skeptical when they opened out here. i thought ahh it wont be as good.  I would have to say its better!  if you have moved out here from chicago both locations (scottsdale and tempe) will not disappoint.  big beef with hot peppers, dipped of course is the only way to go.  cheese fries....just like i remember. the thing i really like...both locations are super clean and even when there are lines it moves very fast."}
{"text":"Overall liked the food but was disappointed that one of the few restaurants with a patio does not allow pets. They even use a dog in their logo. Will take the pup and my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Oh Portillos. So bad but so good. When I need a bag of grease I splurge at Portillos, and their new location makes that easier to accomplish than the first in Scottsdale. 

Believe it or not, their salads are also huge and awesome, and they even come with a great little muffin. If you are a food snob then you might want to stick with them instead of the hot dogs!"}
{"text":"It's Portillos! What can I say? Super reliable, very good food! Always been a fan of their burgers and fries. 
For the locals here, give it a try. This is probably as close to Chicago Food as you can find here."}
{"text":"My husband and I were here for the first time yesterday. We tried the polish sausage and the italian beef sub. Not a fan, our onion rings were the highlight of our meal.

Not sure if we are coming back. Not my favorite spot, there's a lot going on in there."}
{"text":"Italian beef sandwiches had no flavor what so ever, hot dogs were very good but if I was going on a pilgrimage for great hot dogs I would drive the extra few miles and go to Ted's in Tempe."}
{"text":"Food is ok, like higher end fast food. Loud obnoxious zoo-like atmosphere. It's not hard to find better food, portions, prices and especially atmosphere throughout Tempe. Maybe I'll try the drive-thru, but I doubt I'll walk through the doors again. 

The serving dining experience was repulsive. I couldn't wait to get my food and leave. That might be intentional. You walk in the door and a guy tells you to walk along 'that direction' among the people lined up like cattle, then turn left and form two lines to order. Push push push, give us your order, then a girl on a microphone is yelling at the dozens of waiting hordes hoping their number gets called... \"Number 190, Number 190. Please people, all of you people waiting, please cram more closely together, but don't sit down if you don't have your food. Number 214, Number 217.\" It's loud, obnoxious, and stressful. And you don't escape that when you finally get your food. Reminds me of a mall food court or a state fair. It's cafeteria style with loud annoying amplified barkers, fast food environment, and a-little-better-than fast food food.  I couldn't wait to scarf down my food and get out of there! And I can't imagine drudging through the suffocating inconvenience (of parking alone) for that again.

The food itself was fine. I might even have thought it above average if it was from a drive-thru (they do have one). But the chicken sandwich croissant and fries I tried wasn't anything you can't beat throughout Tempe without the cattle barn atmosphere.

There was a huge staff, all doing their jobs diligently. If you call that service, it was fine. But If service has anything to do with customer comfort, convenience, providing a good experience and a reason to return, I would rate it very poor. 

It's not fair to trash everything and everyone that is Chicago. It's a great city with a rich culture, great people, and a lot of great food. This particular place just doesn't seem to have much that Arizona needs."}
{"text":"Hate the place. Walked in and left. The food looked totally processed and the ambiance, crowd and everything about this place is revolting.  Confirming I don't like Chicago style food which is why I've taken up cooking my own food.  Sorry guys who love this place but just givin my opinion."}
{"text":"Love this place! Fell in love while vacationing in Chicago and couldn't wait for it to come to the valley. Our family fav!!!"}
{"text":"I would give Portillo's 3.5 stars if I could, but I'm ultimately rounding up because both times that I've visited, the Italian Beef sandwich (Dipped) with sweet and spicy peppers was very good and I'd happily come back for the exact same item! 

With that being said, the fries are generic and boring (in that they are the exact same frozen, crinkle-cut fries you can buy in the grocery store and make yourself). My bf ordered a grilled chicken sandwich which was nothing special and \"very greasy\". Had he not tried 2 bites of my Italian Beef sandwich, he wouldn't have any desire to come back to Portillo's. However, he loved the beef and gravy with hot peppers and would definitely come back to get his own!"}
{"text":"Normally Portillo's is busy no matter the time of day. This particular day was bad! Huge line of cars as well as a packed restaurant. They had employees taking orders in the line for the drive thru but they didn't have menus handy for us to look at and the actual menu was still a ways up. We finally get to see a menu and we place our order. I ordered the chicken crossiant sandwich with cheese. Normally its a breast, but when I placed my order, they failed to tell me they were out of chicken breast and had put in a fried piece of chicken in its place. If they had just informed me they were out of chicken breast as the time of ordering, I would have ordered something else, but they didnt tell me until it was too late to change the order. They also forgot to add the cheese to my sandwich and the bun was not a crossiant, but a regular bun. Someone royally screwed my order up. We also ordered sides of ranch when we placed our order. When we got our food and checked for the ranch, there wasnt any, so we had to hold up the long line to ask for ranch. When handed the ranch, we were rudely informed normally they charger extra for ranch. I went on to inform her we were well aware of the extra charges and were more than happy to pay them, which is why we included it in our order, which they failed to add to our bill. I was not happy with the customer service nor their lack of communication and lack of getting the correct order. I will never go there when it is really busy again."}
{"text":"Good food I just don't get the hype, we go here as we have friends that love the place. I have had Chili dog (My favorite), Burger (ok) and chicken sandwich ( I should have gotten a chili dog). Off the menu we got chili cheese fries and this is what keeps us coming back, so good. Staff is very nice and quick service."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! Sorry Teds Hot Dogs, this place is the new and approved! We where very impressed! I had the Chicago hot dog and bacon cheese burger. Nothing but smiles and happiness!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place, but I just don't get the hype.  Hot dogs were good, fries good, Italian beef was nothing special.  Service was good, fast, staff very friendly.  Not close to where we live in Phoenix and not worth the special trip, but would eat there again if we were in the area."}
{"text":"Hooray for Portillos for finally making its way out to Arizona, home of the Chicago Cubs! I can't believe it's taken this long to get you guys out here!! For you 1,2,3 star people I encourage you to give it another shot, maybe when crowds die down. Their Italian beef \"wet\" with hot peppers, fries and chocolate cake is the way to go! Not sure what these people are saying about the hot dogs?? I haven't had a bad Chicago dog since 19** . If you want huge go to Costco (if that's what your use too). Cheddar croissant with hot peppers is actually my favorite along with the cheeseburgers with grilled onions!! ;).  It's a great place to take your family, kids softball leagues and after bowling parties :).  Oh and don't forget to make it healthy by adding a wonderful chopped salad!! Yum yum!!"}
{"text":"This is a place we will return to again and again. We came for the hot dogs, and realized their menu is chock full of other temptations, so I'll need time to try them all. 

I had the chili cheese dog with onions, which was very tasty. The chili was flavorful without overpowering the beef dog. We tried the fries and onion rings - both were good but I preferred the fries. They were crinkle cut fries with the perfect crispy outside and soft inside. We also shared the \"famous chocolate cake\", and it was worth it. The cake was moist and delicious, with a perfectly smooth and luscious frosting. 

Their menu also has fresh great-looking salads, char-broiled burgers, chicken sandwiches, beef sandwiches (looked like a great Philly-type), shakes, tamales(!), and wonderful smoothies (my son had the strawberry one and loved it). 

Nicely done and we will be back!"}
{"text":"Dipped combo is to die for!  Never been a fan of subs, beef, sausage, or anything Chicago style . . . but I will gladly drive 20 minutes for this place!  Oh, and the fries?  Crispy and hot every time.  Tried the chocolate cake shake, not a fan.  Taste was good but I couldn't get past the texture.  Be prepared for a crowd.  Looks like their salads are awesome, but I gotta be honest.  I just can't order one instead of the combo."}
{"text":"So like most places I've discovered here in the vally, it was either by found by accident or recomended. I've been told about Portillos but never went, even  though its down the street from my place and on the way home from class. Anyhow, so I decided to stop in and check the place out.

First of all, its in a high traffic area, so you can't miss it. The parking lot is a bit strange,  if you have a large truck or even a lifted Jeep it may be tight getting into some of the spots. It was busy inside, and the staff was friendly.  My order was taken quickly, just a simple chilli chesse dog, fries and a Coke. It took a little longer than I expected for my order to come up, but as I said, the place was busy. 

As for for the hotdog it self, it wasn't bad. Could have made the same thing at home for three quarters less, but what ever. It would be a good spot to stop for lunch with a group."}
{"text":"It's great having excellent Chicago nosh here in AZ.  The quality is just as good as back home...actually better since it's in Scottsdale!  Can't go wrong with the Italian beef with hot peppers and don't forget to get it dipped."}
{"text":"World famous beef sandwich??? HAHAHAHA!!! It was AWFUL!!! It's just beef on a bun. I asked for a refund and asked what makes it \"world famous\"? The manager said \"it's our seasonings\". I literally laughed. What is the seasoning? A little salt and pepper? This is all branding and hype. 

To their credit, they were friendly and refunded my meal with no hesitation. Maybe their other food options are awesome but that beef sandwich? What a scam."}
{"text":"Good stuff.  Its pretty no frills food - cheap prices, quick service, but tasty, tasty eats.  We have gone twice and the hot dog, chili dog, cheeseburger, beef sandwich dipped and french fries are all great - only thing that was pretty lousy was the tamale, and what business that has in a Chicago style restaurant confuses me, anyhow.  
The only \"negative\" is the place is set up a bit haphazardly and the seating leaves a bit to be desired.  Really noisy and a lot going on.  Perfect for a quick \"pop in\" sort of place to eat - just don't try for a conversation.  Worth the visit, though!"}
{"text":"I grew up in Chicago, but I didn't grow up with Portillo's. They weren't on the south side when I was a kid. There was a family owned hot dog stand in the neighborhood that sold hot dogs, fries, beefs, sausage, etc. that was our place of choice. Absent the place I grew up with, Portillo's is an excellent replacement. Can't go wrong with the Italian Beef. Tastes like Chicago."}
{"text":"I love this place! They have the best Italian beefs in the valley. The only con is how long the wait can get in drive thru. Also do not order the chicken sandwiches. They take forever and don't taste good."}
{"text":"My favorite Chicago style restaurant to go to! It never disappoints! They have a selection of food to choose from that are all very delicious! The workers are very friendly and when they call your order, they do a little rhyme with your number. These people are very kind and they always serve the best for their customers!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and service when there. The staff was very polite, and despite the place being packed on a Sat afternoon, they kept lines moving, and allowed people to get their food quickly.

The Italian Beef def fit the Chicago mold, and was well crafted and flavored. The employees cannot be praised enough for their care of the product and the food.

If you actually care about food, and appreciate quality, and especially if you are from Chicago, Portillo's is a must"}
{"text":"Chicago! ! I never had hotdogs that tasted bland and overpriced,.i believe they buy cheap hotdogs at food city, overprice them, call.it Chicago hot dogs and sell it to the fools who will pay the price!
Nothing special!! Buy your dogs at costco and save your money!"}
{"text":"Very good food and authentic Chicago style. I are the Chicago style dog and the hot Italian beef sandwich and both hit the spot. Line gets a little long at lunch time and it's a little pricey but good food and a stylistic diner environment"}
{"text":"I would rate this fair at best. Its very loud and busy. They wanted our order before we saw the menu. You have to order at the counter then pick up your order and try to find a place to sit. The hot dogs are small and average at best. The Italian beef was tasteless and on a soggy bun. I paid extra for sweet peppers that one would need a microscope to find and once found they had no taste, a waste of money. The onion rings were on par with most fast food places, average at best.

Our dinner for two was $20.00 at a walk up to order place, that wasn't bad enough until you realize you have to try to find a clean table. They have a sign that you have to clean your own table! There were a lot of dirty tables and nobody cleans them. Now you get a walk up to order and pick up yourself, eat at a filthy table and get average food for $20.00.

On the up side the decor was kind of cool but that isnt enough to get us back. My 2 stars is a gift."}
{"text":"Had a hot dog and a beef and tasted exactly as I remember from back in Chicago."}
{"text":"Screwed up my order again. For the number of employees there you would think they will get a simple order right. They even miss
 the drink!"}
{"text":"The food was really good. I loved my chocolate milkshake too! My husband enjoyed the Italian sausage and his strawberry shortcake. The music and the staff added a fun touch. Wish they sold t- shirts in store"}
{"text":"Amazing hot dogs and I was also surprised by how  fresh the garden salad was , fast service , cheap, and good!"}
{"text":"A taste of Chicago right here in Scottsdale! There's another location at Tempe Marketplace, too. It's fun to come here with my little nephew. The chicken sandwich is nice. I also love a polish with sauerkraut!"}
{"text":"its hard to find good Italian roast beef out here in Arizona ,but portillos brings me back to Chicago. If the owners were smart they would come out to West gate as well."}
{"text":"My date and I thoroughly enjoyed our experience here at portillos.. She got the Italian beef and I got the big beef. Very nice flavor in the beef and the bread was excellent. Highly recommended from the two of us for sure."}
{"text":"Atmosphere - 5 Stars. The decorations and employees are dressed like Chicago and makes it a cool place to hangout and enjoy a meal.

I went here a few times, first time I had the beef with sweet peppers and thought this was okay no big deal.... 

I was taught the missing ingredient that makes all the difference in the world, it is unhealthy but if your going to do it, do it right.

When ordering the big beef ask them to make it DIPPED. Yep, it is a soggy mess and requires 5 napkins but makes all the difference in the world."}
{"text":"This is the second time I have been here, and I seriously doubt there will be a third time. The first time was for the hot dogs. I found them to be very average. There are many other choices to find a good hot dog. Today I tried the beef sandwich. I will start with the ordering part of the meal. Behind the register I encountered a person who either hated her job or just didn't care about customer service. A smile might have helped, but apparently that is not a job requirement. I ordered two large beef sandwiches. In a very disinterested voice I was asked if I wanted peppers on the sandwich. I ventured to ask what came on the sandwich and was told in a very bored voice, \"beef, there are charges for anything you want to add\". She then just stood there looking at me. I added the peppers and was given a number and a receipt. Thank you probably would have been an additional charge. The sandwiches were OK. They had a decent amount of meat, although one had a large chunk of gristle in the first bite. With the lack of customer service and the very average food, there is no reason to return."}
{"text":"This place is overhyped.  The food is ok, the portions a bit small for the price.  It's not the Oregano's of hot dogs like most of the reviews would lead you to believe."}
{"text":"This place is legit.  Had a chili dog.  Amazing.  Had an Italian beef.  Amazing.  Best restaurant of its kind in the Valley.  Al's just down the road is good, but this place is great."}
{"text":"Absolute garbage. The rolls were soaking wet, the beef sandwich was painfully bland, and their hotdog was what I would expect at an elementary school cafeteria. Horrible."}
{"text":"Best Italian beef in the Valley, hands down! The Chopped Salad and Beef Cheddar Croissant are delicious. Of course the hot dogs are noteworthy as well. All in all, the customer service and quality of food are unsurpassed!"}
{"text":"FIRST TIMER OVER HERE!
I'm impressed! it was a little confused with the ordering system when I got there but got the hang of it.
We all got what we wanted and the flavor was good too.
Good variety of foods lots of seating indoor and out door. Lots of desert options too."}
{"text":"This place is beyond garbage. To start it looks nice when you walk in and that's where it ends. As soon as we got up to order I ordered a sandwich. I was asked if I wanted regular or hot peppers. I said hot and watched close to a dolllar up charge added to the screen without a word from the guy taking my order. I figured oh well let's wait until the food comes. We ordered our food to go and then drove literally less than 10 minutes home. I reached in the bag to grab my sandwich and my hand was covered in grease. the paper the sandwich was wrapped in was coming apart from so much grease. Not surprisingly one bite of the sandwich and I was done. A bite of my fiance's burger tasted the same. Like a week's worth of sludge from the grease trap. Save your money and eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"They gave me onions in my chop salad, but I said no onions. They also took out the chicken, I mean, the chicken is the best part of the chop salad."}
{"text":"Love the burgers very good food. Drive thru fast. Love portillos. Great service. I would recommend"}
{"text":"This place rocks! It's like being back home in the Chicago burbs. Ole Dick Portillo's knows how to put out great product even in the AZ! Keep it up the great work and perhaps we can meet up again in Cali?"}
{"text":"Had an \"IS / with\" which is menu slang for Italian Sausage with peppers. Took two bites and new something was wrong. A few hours later I was vomiting violently. A few hours more and still vomiting. Longest night of my life. I've eaten there before with no issue so not sure what happened yesterday but that'll be my last visit."}
{"text":"Takes longer than most drive-thrus but I think it is worth it, great burgers & onion rings! Love that they are open later also & that they will do a well done burger for my picky self."}
{"text":"I love a place where I can get a tasty, filling salad and my husband can get a gut bomb hot dog. We're both happy. The milkshakes are also amazing! I love the pumpkin pie shake."}
{"text":"Italian beef is a Chicago staple, and there is a reason for that. Delicious beef sandwiches and the salads are surprisingly great. Get the Chop or the Poppyseed. Goes well with your beef sandwich and hot cheese fries : )
The FREE muffin is actually pretty delish too!"}
{"text":"DO NOT ORDER THE BRATWURST!  It is the WURST!
I was there at 11 am 30 minutes after they opened. The BRATWURST was burnt, cold and dry. Tasted like it was cooked yesterday and reused the next day. The mustard they used on it looked like and almost tasted like mayonnaise."}
{"text":"I'm officially  obsessed with this place. The food is great, and they have the best Arnold Palmer around! You can tell the place is amazing right when you walk inand see how packed the place gets! :) Love love love this place!"}
{"text":"Hot dog left lots to be desired.  I had the grilled dog vs the steamed . The outer skin was tough.  The dog was okay  I would not order it again"}
{"text":"Being from Chicago I absolutely love being able to get a taste of home every once in awhile since phoenix isn't exactly known for its food."}
{"text":"Portillos...What took you so long??? Great food, great prices! My experience in the valley has been- if a restaurant says it is Chicago style- it never comes close to what you can actually get in Chicago. We FINALLY have a REAL Chicago place- an original. And nothing has been lost in translation! I was lucky enough to be there for the test runs, and couldn't resist battling the crowds when they opened yesterday. Their employees are awesome, the food was wonderful! They bake their own bread and cakes on site. Tip- In a hurry???? Check out their drive thru if you can't wait long- my chopped salad only took 10 minutes to pick up. Favorites- Italian beef with hot giardinaire, burgers, chicken sandwiches, amazing salads and ...best chocolate cake EVER!"}
{"text":"So let me just say the very first time I ate here I was not satisfied! My husband and I have been wanting to try this place for a very long time.  We decided to stop in Friday September 8, well the little boy at the register seemed ready to go home ! The manager was rude and stated she closed in 5 mins lol, then we go to eat outside and they turn the lights out on us not even asking us if we needed anything or advising us they were turning lights off and we would be sitting in the dark!! Another customer had just phoned in an order and they locked him out and wouldn't open the door!! The evening lady manager is rude and shouldn't be managing AT ALL! The food and prices were very good though .."}
{"text":"First time to Portillos and it's not worth the cost to go. You pay separate for everything you want and a burger alone was $7.50.  It felt more like a school cafeteria than it did a diner.  Food was just OK. Not anything that makes me \"have\" to go back because what they have and the taste can be found all over the Valley."}
{"text":"I will never come here again. The food was good but there were flies all over it. The music was way too loud and people had to yell which made it even worse. The bathrooms were absolutely disgusting and the floors were sticky through the entire restaurant. They call the numbers AND ORDERS out over a loudspeaker and it's so loud you can't even understand what they're saying, and they say it four or five times so it's super annoying! I will not be going back."}
{"text":"On every business trip to Chicago, I would always make a point to stop at Portillo's.  So of course I was elated when they opened one in Scottsdale. I was there on opening day and have been a loyal customer ever since.

Love their Italian Beef sandwiches.  I usually do mine dry (very little gravy) with cheese, hot peppers and onions. I also order a side a gravy to dip my sandwich in. Wish they included these extras in the price of the sandwich but they all are an extra cost. You can't go wrong with their cheese fries. They are a crinkle cut and one of my faves.  Their cheeseburgers are actually really good and my kids love their Chocolate Cake Shake.

If I'm feeling like I need to cut back on the meat and bread, I order a salad instead. My two favorites are the Poppyseed Fruit w/ Chicken Salad and the Chopped Salad. The salads come with a lemon poppyseed muffin and are very tasty.  

Overall, their price points are reasonable and the service is good. They are very efficient with handling crowds during their busy times. This is kind of minor, but it is always freezing inside their restaurant.  So much so that we sometimes eat outside even in the summer.  Bring a jacket if you are always cold."}
{"text":"UNREAL!  Just perfect, just like back in chicago.  Just like home.  The workers killed it today!  250+ people in front of me in line (out the door) at 130.  drive thru wrapped around building.  I was eating within 30min.  People who dont know Portillos....dont take that the wrong way.  Portillos is usually a 5-10min wait at the busiest.  Today, opening day was an exception.  Worth the wait.  The many years AZ has been without Portillos have been very sad years.  You absolutely have to go check it out if youve never experienced it.  Get a \"Beef Hot\", \"Chicago Dog\" and \"Cheese Fries\" and then hit the treadmill.  And again, serious props to the workers!

FYI.  Gonnella bread.  Vienna beef.  giardiniera."}
{"text":"We have been here twice recently and it was great!! The Italian beef is straight out of (feels like) Chicago. The only reason I did not give 5 stars was that when I asked for extra peppers, they tried to charge! For a few peppers! And this happened both times we were there."}
{"text":"Good hot dogs. Nice staff , we heard some shrieks from kitchen....no big deal....anyway they were handicapped friendly for my friend, so that's a plus I guess. Seemed pretty huge and empty to me
..maybe it was because we went on a Tuesday night?"}
{"text":"Portillo's in Tempe is close to home and my son and I enjoyed watching it built..  Though we spent a couple of years in Chicago, we had never been to Portillo's, so we didn't know what to expect.  We loved it.

 I'm surprised at the number of critical reviews since the place has been full of very happy people the two times we've visited.  We've had the beef sandwich with hot peppers, the Maxwell St. Polish, a burger, a hot dog, fries, onion rings, and a cake shake.  I thought the beef sandwich was outstanding and its grilled onions thick and succulent.  The Maxwell St. Polish was huge and perfectly grilled. Son loved the burger and the dog and refused to share the cake shake.  I'm determined to try much of the rest of the menu but it will be hard on future visits to pass up the beef or the Maxwell St. Polish. The beef sandwich comes with just the amount of gravy you prefer, from \"dry\" through \"dipped\".  The gravy is delicious and the bread soaks it up nicely.  It's similar to the old standby menu item \"roast beef sandwich au jus\",  or \"French dip\"  except the beef is more generous and flavorful.  If you are put off by a sandwich roll moist with gravy, order it \"dry\", but you'll be missing out on some of the goodness.  Peppers and mozzarella add even more joy.  

It's well organized, well-staffed and efficient, with very friendly employees, and it's amazing to be able to say that during its opening days since the crowds have been impressive.  On both our visits, the officers who directed us to parking spaces were very helpful.  If someone had described Portillo's to me initially as \" large, crowded and loud\" , I might have hesitated as I'm long past college age and also appreciate fine dining, but I found the atmosphere to be a lot of fun.  I enjoyed the woman at the pick-up counter who rhymed the orders she called.  A room full of happy people enjoying good food creates an infectious atmosphere. As we made our way outside and walked past the outside tables, we saw a lot of contented smiles.

If I could change anything, I'd wish for hand-cut, home-made fries.  My son and I decided we will return regularly and check out the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Don't understand the hype or why so many people are eating there. It is so crowded one would expect high level quality food. It is fast food and average at best. 

If I want something when I am at the hospital, the hospital cafeteria is almost as good."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick bite. Get the Maxwell Street Polish, it's my favorite. If you're looking for something a little healthier side, they've got great salads too!"}
{"text":"Beef sandwich, dipped, with sweet peppers is so good. Makes me think back to growing up in Chicago. Fun place to share with the kids."}
{"text":"I moved to the Phoenix area from the Chicago area almost a year ago.  It is near impossible to find good food here in Arizona.  Portillo's is always the right decision.  You cannot go wrong with an Italian Beef sandwich, or a Chicago Style Hot Dog.  And you should try the Chocolate Cake Shake, if that sounds like something you might be into."}
{"text":"Try the beef and cheddar croissant with sweet peppers! It's my favorite along with the cheese fries.

I have tried many items from their menu and have been satisfied with every single one."}
{"text":"We love coming here! Everything is fresh and tastes great! Best beef! And let's not forget the fries! Even if I get a salad I have to get a side of fries!"}
{"text":"Visiting the Phoenix area, I was pleasantly surprised to see a Portillo's restaurant, one of my favorite stops when I'm in Chicago. This location doesn't disappoint - food and service are excellent. A great value, I had two jumbo hotdogs, fries and a large Coke for just over $10. Waited maybe 3 minutes for my order, and as usual the hot dogs were nothing short of amazing. I recommend the jumbo dog, if you aren't familiar with Chicago style hot dogs...they come with onions, relish, tomato, mustard and very hot sport peppers. If you don't like any if those ask to have them left off. Also, try the Italian Beef, there is none better.

My only complaint...and a tip...avoid the small parking lot by the entrance. It is a tight squeeze getting in and out if there. Plenty of parking in the general shopping center lot with less hassle."}
{"text":"To whom it may concern,
Our order was good except for the Italian beef sandwich and double cheeseburger. We live right down the street and when I got home the Italian beef and the double cheeseburger both had slimy soaked buns, fell apart and were inedible, along with both meats being flavorless and patties being burnt. I contacted the restaurant and spoke with Peter(The manager), expressing my unhappiness with the customer service I'd received, unfortunately Peter was unprofessional, insincere, while rudely questioning my integrity by saying \"I was the first person to complain tonight\" then questioned how I ordered the meal Insinuating it was my fault the food was soggy, and that the dry burnt patty was of no concern. Peter didn't appreciate my  business, or really care about my concerns, he then asked for my address so he could forward it to corporate instead of using an in store solution.Due to this Extremely Bad Experience, I will never visit or contact that Portillo's again!!!!"}
{"text":"Workers are a bunch of assholes, the food was fine but some guy named Dave was yelling at me and my friends for no reason and was being very condescending. I'm not coming back to eat here and neither are any of my friends."}
{"text":"Great place. Has the chicago restaurant feel.  Great hot dogs and beef sandwiches. friendly staff and great location.  This is our go to place for hot dogs."}
{"text":"The first time we went to Portillo's I was enchanted. I loved the decor and memorabilia. The hot dog and the fries with cheese sauce were good. My kids enjoyed the chocolate cake shake too. The second time I was not so enchanted. I ordered a salad and it tasted fair and was pricey. If you are going to go to Portillo's order the hot dog or beef sandwich. Don't bother with their salads."}
{"text":"Ok, so I waited to go twice to write my review.  I went on a Sunday around noon to dine in and then a weekday around 5:30 through drive-thru.  Both times the food did not disappoint! I am not a huge fan of hot dogs so I opted for the Italian beef.  I suggest ordering it with hot peppers and mozzarella.  It's soo good.  I literally crave it.  The drive-thru is very efficient and probably quicker than inside during peak hours.  My only suggestion is that if you get it to go the cheese may make the bread soggy so keep that in mind! The fries are good and so are the onion rings but you will not need them, the sandwich is huge!  If you are planning to dine in during meal times, I suggest you either are not in a hurry or go a little before or after the traditional times for lunch or dinner.  The lines move quickly though so do not let them scare you off."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. It has a drive thru which is a huge plus with kids. But the food was bad. And expensive for what I got. I paid 4 +bucks for my small side order of chicken strips. I also tried the BBQ chicken salad which was just bad. The chicken was stained an unappealing pink from the BBQ sauce. But it didn't even taste like bbq. And the dressing managed to be spicy yet flavorless, a conflicting combo. I was really disappointed. I would have enjoyed McDonald's more ."}
{"text":"Very yum, fun & loud!! Husband & I shared the Portillos hot dog & a bacon cheeseburger. Both were very good! Atmosphere of the place is pretty fun but the place is very loud which I didn't mind at all. Will be going back!"}
{"text":"This is such a great Chicago place.  Love each their hot dogs and onion rings!! Yum!

Service is fast and efficient.  Thanks Scottsdale for welcoming our Chicago favorite."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Had the beef sandwich with sweet peppers & classic Caesar salad. Definitely going back when in the area"}
{"text":"Portillos is a great experience for the whole family. We went a few days ago and loved the food. The Italian beef on top of a hot dog really takes hot dogs to the next level. The chocolate cake shake is to die for! It's fairly priced but the menu is hard to read. When you walk in the door it's a bit overwhelming with where you order and the line system is a bit unorganized.  Overall the place is awesome and has a great patio too."}
{"text":"Good hot dogs for the price iam fanatic of the sonoran hot dogs this is total different and i like good place and nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place has the best Italian beef sandwich I have ever had hands down! Beats out Al's beef without a doubt. I ordered a beef with extra gravy and sweet peppers . Wow they have the gravy down awesome sandwich . 

Everything holds together perfect, the bread does not fall apart even with the extra gravy .the sweet peppers were a perfect combination with the beef . You can even add mozzarella , which I didn't honestly it does not need cheese .

I hope the food stays consistent , which I know some  places have this issue.
When I went to Al's i thought wow this sandwich was awesome , no wonder why they are so popular in Chicago . Then I read about Portillo's  a lot of Chicagoans saying Portillo's  had the best Italian beef on Chicago.

I thought to myself no way I don't see how they can beat out Al's  , boy was I wrong , do yourself a favor and get one with the  extra gravy and sweet peppers if you like peppers ."}
{"text":"Had a birthday lunch with a friend. Guy who took the order was pleasant & patient as we checked out the options. Had the grilled tuna sandwich & the beef & cheddar croissant, an order of onion rings and an order of fries. Food was hot , everything seemed fresh, but the bread and croissant were yuk! Both were soft and \"slimy\" in the mouth Come on guys, your fillings are great, splurge on some decent bread!"}
{"text":"Order your Italian beef sandwich dry with gravy on the side if you don't like soggy bread. Very tasty sandwich! The hamburgers are restaurant size and delicious. Chocolate cake is a must!"}
{"text":"They don't deserve a one-star review, but they sure tried to earn one.

We showed up on a Friday night.  The place was relatively busy.  My first inclination of a poo-show was that they asked for two lines to form, then they funneled us to three open registers.  The result is that the people in the other line, who'd arrived after us, with about 7 people in their party, decided to walk up to the register when it was our turn.  No big deal, but it's a crappy way to introduce the guests to the place.

It was SUPER loud and the cashier, who seemed as though she felt she was too good to be there, made no attempt to speak loud enough so we had to ask her to repeat herself constantly.

We got ready to receive our food and here's where a poor experience turned worse...they completely messed up our order.  They gave me a bag with some kind of wrapped item, and french fries and a small coke.  Which is odd, because we ordered a double-bacon burger and the grilled tuna sandwich with onion rings and a lemonade.  I pointed out the error and they started over.

We finally got our order - the onion rings were way over cooked, and the fish sandwich tasted like cat food (don't ask me how I know; just...college).  The burger was dry and surprisingly devoid of flavor.  Oh, and no bacon.  When I pointed it out they just gave me a few pieces of bacon...cold.  It must have been from a Kevlar pig because it was virtually impossible to bite through it.

I love food and one of my favorite things to eat is hamburgers.  I didn't finish it.  I figured that the taste wasn't worth the calories.

The only reason they didn't get one-star is because they played some decent music.  Plus, I want to save my one-star reviews for places that suck like black-holes.

To the people that say their food is good: please get out more."}
{"text":"Food is ok if you like bread soaked soggy sandwiches. Employees and manager (John) are sharp as a bag of marbles! You know, the kids these days that are only as smart as the register in front of them. We ordered enough food for a family of five and when we asked for a side roll (like the one that comes with the salad) they said they can't do it. They have to charge for a loaf! So, I called the manager over, and he confirmed that since it's not on the register he has no way to give us a roll with the soup!! Common sense has officially left the building!"}
{"text":"I have been to Portillo's in Chicago, and love that they are now here in Scottsdale.

The entire staff is fast, friendly, and efficient.  The atmosphere is great and somewhat retro.

The food - I ordered the Italian Beef sandwich and it was great.  My friend ordered the burger, which she enjoyed.  Next time I plan to try the croissant beef sandwich.

Great family place, and packed for lunch!  Plan ahead, but still quick.

A must visit place."}
{"text":"I enjoy the food here and it's generally always good. The last two times I've been in my food has been cold. This last visit I ordered a regular cheese burger and fries. The fries were fresh and hot as always and the meat was cooked but cold to the point where the cheese wouldn't even melt. I took it back up to the counter but got the same thing back. Every place can be hit or miss but lately this location had been slacking."}
{"text":"Really good Italian beef. Definitely a must with the cheese fries. Delicious!!!
Not a big fan of the chocolate cake shake, a little too sweet for me."}
{"text":"I heard a lot about this place from my Chi-Town friends so I thought I'd take my wife out for lunch. I had the chicken walnut salad and my wife had a burger and fries. To get to the point, it was Paradise Bakery prices with school cafeteria quality. There is a ton of hype around this place so I was pretty let down when I realized I walked into a carnival-like setting and spent state-fair money. After further discussion with friends I came to learn that the only items worth ordering are their beef sandwiches. After seeing the quality of meat they use for their salads (dice-sized cubes of what appeared to be the chicken version of SPAM) and burgers (McDonalds beef looked more appetizing)...I think we'll pass and spend our money on a local restaurant that serves higher quality food at equal prices. 2 stars because the service was good and it was kid friendly...that was about as good as it got."}
{"text":"After going here for a quick lunch before leaving to the airport, I was amazed at this place. I have never gone here before and I already like it. The way they order makes it quick and easy for everyone. Then, the food. I ordered two beef hot dogs and fries. Absolute heaven. The buns were great and the hot dog overall was delicious. I devoured the fries as well. If you are ever near any Portillo's, go there for your own good!"}
{"text":"This place is great.  Real italian Beef Sandwiches, Chicago style hotdogs, great salads, very affordable."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I have always had great food at Portillo's but tonight took the cake. It downright sucked and I do not say that often. I picked up my usual when I go there as it is 2 Maxwell's, 2 Italian beef and cheeseburger. And before you say it no it was not all for me. The beef was overcooked, the burger was dry even with condiments and the Maxwells where to start. They were burnt beyond recognition thought it was a piece of charcoal on the roll. I could not even eat it as it was so bad. I know that you could have a bad night but the people putting these together could have seen that these were not edible. I was really disappointed as I live about 35 miles away and did not check them until I was home as I did not think I would need too as many times as I have had great service there. I was just about ready to drive back there when I decided to post this. One bad service can almost make someone never return again and I may not unless I receive my money back on this poor excuse of a meal. loaded pic check it out..lol"}
{"text":"Fast and friendly. Got the dipped Italian Beef. Great flavor, like I remember from Chicagoland Portillo's. Worth the the visit.

Unf, bun was much more soggy than I remember, almost dissolved. Maybe they're using different bread supplier here in AZ?

Food came out quickly, great job, but got the wrong drink. New location, new employees. Understandable.

Will return and look fwd to seeing how this does here in AZ."}
{"text":"Great food! Exceeded my expectations when I found out I was meeting a friend at a \"hot dog\" restaurant. I will be going back and I will be spreading the word about this place!"}

{"text":"The name says \"Hot Dogs\" but that is like calling Squaw Valley  \"a place with snow\". Best Italian Beef sandwich this side of Chicago and the ladies in my office vouch for the good salads. The Milk Shake is a sold B, but the Onion Rings are top notch and not to be missed. Clean and a good staff."}
{"text":"Great Chicago experience. Just like the ones back home, no loss of service or quality. Great dogs, great sausage, and awesome atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great food, clean interior, clean restrooms and helpful staff.  True Chicago food from a true Chicago company.  It is always busy here, but the staff helped my elderly Grandfather find a seat among the sea of hungry folks.  The Italian beefs and hot dogs are fantastic!"}
{"text":"Yelp led me here while vacationing in Arizona...what a find! As a Jersey girl, I am used to hot dogs \"all the way\" meaning onions, chili, etc. At Portillo's they were way different but OH SO GOOD! The onion rings were amazing as well. Very clean, efficiently run place...def check it out!"}
{"text":"They can't follow simple directions. I asked for a burger with bacon cheese and mayo. They forgot the cheese, there was one drop of mayo & the bacon was overcooked."}
{"text":"Thanks Portillo's for a fantastic experience! Delicious food! Wonderful employees! :)

I will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"CAKE SHAKE. Yep, a slice of cake in a shake. All mashed up and branded. Oh my. I think I died and went to heaven. The cheese fries, Italian beef and hot peppers were awesome as well. Yum!"}
{"text":"I've never been to Chicago,  but if this is representative of their cuisine I will continue to fly over it on my way to New York.  Please someone tell me it gets better than this."}
{"text":"So excited Portillo's is finally in AZ!! Great hot dogs, Italian Beef sandwiches and salads. Can't wait to go back again and again to try everything on the menu!!!"}
{"text":"Italian Sausage sandwich is yummy. They are very efficient. It was busy as can be and they were able to prepare my good quickly and efficiently. I highly recommend Portillos to my friends & family!"}
{"text":"I know this place rocks in Chicago, but hopefully back there, it taste a lot better. I recently went and waited forever for a big beef and fries. My stomach was messed up for 2 days after that. In all reality this is just nasty fast food that people think is somewhat amazing."}
{"text":"Miss Chicago street cuisine. Portillos brings back sweet memories. The combo made my mouth water."}
{"text":"I'm from Illinois so was very familiar with Portillos.  Their problem here are the mentally impaired people they have to hire from AZ to work in the stores.  The food is good, if you CAN GET IT FROM THEM.

What a hosed up operation where you pick up the food.  Takes forever.  I am not going here anymore at lunch because I don't have the time it takes to get you food.  It is not from the preparation time, it is from the goofy and incompetent staff at the assembly area.  Food sitting in sacks forever behind the counter while they try to match up drinks.  They get a ton of things messed up.  Drove me nuts just watching that circus back there.

Maybe someone will read this and try to fix and manage that area as the food is good WHEN you get it.

I don't need the frustration and won't be going to this one again.

Oh - i hate the parking lot at this one, totally screwed up design."}
{"text":"To my knowledge they have the best chili cheese dog in town; although a little pricey."}
{"text":"Food itself is OK, not the greatest, not the worst Italian beef I've had. Bad thing is they always forget something , when you order cheese fries they forget the cheese. When you order big beef with hot peppers they forget the hot peppers. Might seem like a small detail but these are the things that add flavor and taste to otherwise bland food. Its like going to a restaurant and they forget to season your food. Not impressed at all."}
{"text":"Come here for the Italian beef. But the Asian lady who cleans the tables is just too much. She comes over to my booth and starts cleaning up. I had to get something to clean the table myself before and now she tries cleaning up around me while I am eating. She takes my tray and bag so now I am supposed to clear off my table when I leave? With what?"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch and had a beef and Italian sausage combo while my wife had the beef and cheddar croissant.  The service was fast and friendly and the dining area is clean and bright.  The sausage and peppers made up for the bland beef in my soggy sandwich, while my wife's croissant was nothing special. The fries were just OK.  I may try a dog if I am nearby during lunch again, but will pass on the beef."}
{"text":"Came in on New Years eve hoping for a quick and easy dinner. We ordered two salad meals two small drinks and a bowl of chili. The salads were prepared well and fairly quickly, but we waited over 10 minutes for a small bowl of chili. I would be more inclined to understand if they were busy.. But it wasnt super busy when we were there. Overall it was disappointing."}
{"text":"Best Chicago food I've had in AZ.  Maxwell Polish is great, onions are perfect and the sausage has really good flavor.  Dogs are ok.  I prefer Redhots over Vienna beef any day.  Burgers are legit.  I generally don't like Chicago burgers and I didn't care for them here.  Italian Beef is sooo jucie and flavorfull with the right bread.  Italian sausage is perfect, with the right amount of spice.  Service is great. Everyone is Friendly and helpful.  They flew out Chicago people to get this place going right!  They don't charge a ridiculous amount for the food like most Chicago places."}
{"text":"Great food and the atmosphere is awesome.  Never had any issues until tonight,  Look at yelp and it said they close at 10 pm.  We drive 25 miles and pull into the parking lot at 9:45 to a locked door.  I take part of the blame for not calling to verify but when Yelp states they close at 10 pm you're on the money.  Visiting from out of town and Portillo's is a treat.  Very disappointed"}
{"text":"Good fries. Good shake. Fast. Friendly. Undercooked chicken sandwich (not edible) substituted for hot dog (for free with apology) Not a fan of the hotdog"}
{"text":"I expected more out of this place but my kids loved it... I was SUPER disappointed in the soggy bread my big beef came in. Almost unedible but I took it down anyways."}
{"text":"We couldn't wait for our favorite Chicago restaurant to come to Arizona.  The best Italian beef sandwiches ever.  The only thing that would make it better, is if they would open up a Portillos in SanTan Mall in Gilbert, AZ."}
{"text":"So I used to live in Chicago where every week we would have portillos. Well we moved to Arizona where portillos did not exist and my dreams shattered. When they opened this up, i was so happy you wouldn't even know. I had roast beef and a hot dog, and they tasted just like in Chicago! It was amazing! So go here to taste a good roast beef or a hot dog"}
{"text":"Not a bad meal we had tonight. I had a tasty burger some crispy fries and a small chocolate cake shake. Oh my goodness do they make one heck of a shake. They take their famous chocolate cake and put it in a chocolate shake. Absolutely fantastic, and I totally recommend this place."}
{"text":"We actually come here all the time. Very weak performance though for them today. Three out of the four orders that were placed were given to us completely wrong. Not only did the order taker in the line seem as though she couldn't get it straight, the complete frustration at the cashier by how she wrote it out was worse.  They need some more training here."}
{"text":"Been totally addicted to this place since living in Chicago.  Used to have to take \"day trips\" just to go to their Moreno Valley location in the middle of the California desert or order online to get my fix.  Nice to have this location and Scottsdale both right off the 101 to get my jumbo dog and italian beef on demand.  No matter how insanely busy they can get, service is always fast and with a  smile.  This place is a well oiled machine.  Best Chicago dogs and beef in the valley!"}
{"text":"If you haven't tried Portillo's and like the items they offer on their menu, you should probably drop whatever you're doing and head on over.  I've had the burgers, hot dogs, and Italian beef and all are four-star or better...but I'm here to tell you about the Italian beef, which is the best I've ever had.  

I'm not inclined towards Italian beef and while I always try the Italian beef (I'm from Chicago and in a never-ending search for the best Italian beef), I typically opt for a meatball or chicken parm sub when eating at Rosati's or other restaurants that offer Italian beef because few live up to Portillo's.  With that said - WOW!  An Italian beef, dipped with sweet peppers and hot giardiniera on the side is HEAVENLY.  Don't forget dipped - it's a must as many of these reviews agree!  The meat gravy/juice boasts oregano and black pepper and isn't over-salted.  It turns a four-star sandwich into a ten star sandwich!  Many in my family opt for the beef and cheddar croissant and ask for a side of the meat juice, which I'll go for occasionally too.  They won't dip these because the croissant falls apart but you can juice it up on your own and deal with the messy deliciousness.  My dad opts for the Italian combo, dipped, which is Italian beef and Italian sausage.  I've never had it but his refusal to share even a bite tells me something!

The fries are crinkle cut food service fries but of the high-end variety and cooked to crispy perfection.  When served with their sharp cheese sauce, they compliment the main dish nicely.

I also need to mention the cake shake.  It is what it says it is - an entire piece of chocolate cake blended into a chocolate shake.  Unique and delicious.

There is a reason why there always a line of cars around this place.  4.5 stars is the correct rating based on food service fries and onion rings instead of making them fresh but the overall quality of the main dishes has me rounding up."}
{"text":"I grew up in Chicago eating here and have to visit a portillos whenever and where ever I can. My family & I love their food so much that we spend $100+ to get their food delivered to our home in Georgia for Christmas. This location is just as great as any of the Chicago locations. 

Just to add I will not eat roast beef or hot dogs any where else but portillos because it is just that good! 

Roast beef, hot dogs, cheese fries, that Italian sausage in the roast beef sandwich thing...omg everything is so good. (We need one in Georgia)

Not to mention their drinks are always very carbonated, which I love because they don't go flat by the time you get to your table. 

Don't forget about desert because they have THE BEST chocolate cake...and chocolate cakes shakes!"}
{"text":"What is not to like! Best Chicago beef and Chicago hot dogs in Arizona. It is almost always crowded but the service is great- - whether going through the drive through or eating inside.....prices are fair and the food is plentiful. I've had a couple of the salads too and they are delicious also."}
{"text":"A throw back dining establishment great food and atmosphere. Casual and fun it is so much more than dogs. I ordered chili dogs and fries."}
{"text":"Always busy but incredibly efficient. If you haven't been to Portillo's yet....GO! I always get the Italian beef (add hot pep, moz, grilled onions and gravy on the side), fries and a root beer. People love the chocolate cake (it's fine...but it's boxed cake and canned frosting so let's not get too excited), but I would say get a shake or malt as a treat instead. I could eat here multiples times per week if I didn't think it would kill me. 

Also, if you're into salads - the Portillo's chopped is awesome! But let's be real, if you're choosing between a salad and Italian beef, beef will always win!"}
{"text":"It gets very busy at lunch, but they have lots of tables inside and out. Lines move quickly and the wait for your food is typically short.  Highly recommend to try."}
{"text":"I've come here often and always had good food and service. Except for today. My order was wrong. No big deal I walk up they offer to fix it I say ok. 15 minutes later no food. I walk up again and the guy asked if I had received my food. I said no so he went and had them make it again. They did. I get back to my table and the food is wrong again. Then when I walk back up the girl tells me I asked for different hotdogs. I asked for what I ordered and what was on my receipt. No one apologized. I got frustrated and walked to the cashier and asked for my money back. I said I'd pay for the burger and fries my girlfriend ate but not the hotdogs. 

What made me mad was no manager took responsibility or tried to make it right. All I got was grief from the employees for their mistakes. Sad to say but I'll never go back."}
{"text":"Not thrilled at all with the customer service I received. We placed an order for carry out for our office.  I arrived on time to pick up the food, it however was not all ready in time.  When it came time to pay... It was a nightmare to say the least.... 30 minutes later my food has been sitting on the counter NOT in the warmer, The attitude of the manager was UGLY and I was just wanting to walk away from it all. DO NOT TRY TO USE A COMPANY CARD..... Because they will treat you as if you're a thief...They didn't even apologize after they got the faxed authorization form.... So fast forward, I'm back at the office, food is 45 minutes late, and NOT hot, and we are not happy.... I call and get hung up on. OVER IT. Wont be going here again....."}
{"text":"I don't like hot dogs. BUT I had a random craving for a good delicious Chicago dog. Portillo's did not disappoint. The Portillo's beef hot dog with everything is very delicious and the French fries with the cheese.... yes please!!!!!! This place is delicious!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good.  The hot dogs are probably the best item I've tried, had the chili cheese dog - cheese is a little pasty so I would have it without next time but I enjoyed it otherwise. The regular hot dog is good, they put a ton of toppings on it and it has good flavor.  The burgers are just ok, I like the char broiled flavor but the meat was a little rubbery.  Italian beef was soggy and had a flavor I didn't care for, I think the was the gravy, it had an off/almost artificial beef flavor.  Their onion rings are very good and I love the crinkle cut fries.

I would like to try the tamale in a bowl and their sausage sandwich so I'll be heading back but you can get better burgers/dogs at other places (AJ's supermarket is actually better).  It always seems to be mobbed so they clearly have their fans, to me it's just ok."}
{"text":"The absolute Worst chili cheese burger I ever had! I called and complained and they didn't care. He said \"we put an once of chili on every burger\". LOL that's a shot glass of chili, and the cheese under the patty? UGH.."}
{"text":"The hot dogs were good, nice outside dining and fast entertaining service. All the food I had there was good, nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"We had the big beef sandwich.  The bread was soggy and the beef had no flavor.  Arbys has much better roast beef sandwiches.  On top of bad food, we had bad service. Veronica took our order.  She was unfriendly and tried to run up our bill by adding items we did not want.  We had to wait to get our food and we had clean our own table in order to sit down and eat.
We will NEVER return to this place again."}
{"text":"First and last time I order from them. When I picked up my order I went to the pickup line, and not the online pickup line. Nobody redirected me to the right spot in the store. I ordered a hotdog with cheese and chicken parmesan. The cheese was a little slice and the only melted part was stuck to the wrapping, the bun was sticky and the taste was nothing to write home about. The chicken parmesan was just ok, I didn't like the taste of the marinara that much. The pasta was overcooked."}
{"text":"Food was just ok.  Burgers and hot dogs are nothing to rave about.   Price ok.  Very clean and very friendly."}
{"text":"Two and a half stars. Very overrated IMO. The food would best be described as bland and greasy.  I was really excited when this place opened up but I've been twice now and it has been disappointing both times. Too bad."}
{"text":"Love the beef and hot dogs. Loved them in Chicago and very happy a part of home is in thr valley.  Patio view is much better than Chicago snow."}
{"text":"I 've eaten here the last 3 yrs, the beef and dogs are great, unfortunately the sausage in the combo sandwich has declined the flavor is not the same as years past. I won't order it anymore. It taste of low quality grocery store brand. Not for me.."}
{"text":"Showed up on a Thursday night a little after 7, and it was pretty busy. Plenty of parking available, though. We walked in, and it's a bit confusing if it's your first time and no one is there to direct you. You order at towards the far left end of the joint, and then wait on the near left (if that makes any sense) to pick up. We were approached by a employee with a menu just before placing our order: italian beef dry w/sauce on the side, chicago dog, and onion rings. 

Took at seat (there was plenty of seating, but lots of signs saying not to take a seat until your order was placed?), and about 5 mins later, our order was ready. everything was hot, but it was all in a take out bag. I looked around, and everyone's food is in a takeout bag. A bit strange. Chicago dog - good, love all the toppings. Dog could have had a bit more snap, but good flavor. Onion rings were awesome! Italian beef - we like it with the sauce so we can dip it ourselves and the bread doesn't get soggy. I know, that's not the \"proper\" way, but it's the way we like it. It's like a french dip with some italian seasonings on it.

Food:price was reasonable.  Quick, casual place to get a bite to eat."}
{"text":"Just eat here and You'll know why us people from Chicago are a little heavier than most. Yuuuuuuum"}
{"text":"Great food but a little pricey for basically fast food. Everything is a la cart and food can add up when your eyes are bigger than your stomach."}
{"text":"I left Chicago 20 years ago, it is nice to know some things endure - like their Italian beef and sausage sandwich.  Loved it! It is the best, of course the onion rings were great also"}
{"text":"We went the grand opening day afternoon.

I tried the hotdog with everything. (around $3)  Pretty decent price and good portion of food. I am impressed by the fresh ingredients. Every bite is very flavorful. 

Saw Mr Dick Portillo walk by in a purple shirt. May God bless him and open more awesome restaurants."}
{"text":"Being born and raised in Chicago, I grew up on Portillos. When I heard they were building one here in AZ I went nuts! This place is amazing. The decor is beautiful and classic, exactly how I remember it. The food is awesome. If they opened one up closer to where I live then I'd probably eat here at least once a day. Every menu item is fantastic, I've had the hot dog, burger, chicken sandwich, and Italian beef and they are all delicious. People complaining about the soggy bread on the Italian beef don't understand, that's how it's meant to be! They dip the sandwich in au jus so it can be more tasty and moist. You can ask for no dip but it will be dry."}
{"text":"If I could rate this zero I would.. terrible costumer service forgot our order and made us go back not once not twice but THREE times at the end when we talked to the manager he didn't even care told us he'll talk to one of the workers but that's it no apology or anything. Leah was the only good worker there that helped us out she should be the manager or leave because she was also treated like shit by the manager. Worst costumer service I've ever received and was disrespected by almost every worker especially Arianna. This company should be embarrassed...."}
{"text":"It's interesting since this place is famous for its hot dogs, that the best thing I had on the menu was the combo beef and sausage sandwich with sweet peppers.  I also had a chili cheese dog that was fine but nothing amazing.  The sandwich was 5 stars and the hot dog was 3. It is a very peculiar layout, and parking here is a pain.  Once you get in though, there are a ton of tables to sit at (there is plenty of seating inside and outside).  As you walk in, where you actually order is all the way across several thousand square feet of space.  You might be thinking to yourself, \"well you must have gone through the side entrance\".  That may be the case, but since that is where all the parking is that is where all the customers come through.  The service was ok, I mentioned it was my first time and that didn't elicit a reaction.  After you order you have to walk by the production line to where you pick up your food, and it's encased in glass so you can watch the production magic happening.  BUT you are being yelled at by the crew at the pick up area not to congregate there.  Ok I get it you don't want to clog up the lane, but once again just a really awkward design.  I enjoyed all the photos with celebrities and the founder of Portillo's.  I enjoy the nostalgia.  Solid food, but a really funky layout."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good.  Italian beef is super slamming along with the shakes. The only reason I gave 4 stars is because I saw the manager wearing a Green Bay Packers lanyard... it's a Chicago place man!"}
{"text":"We like the food- that's why 2 stars. 
BUT! Tonight it made my husband almost instantly sick  his GI system is playing jungle gym after eating it! 
Plus, the service is always horrible! We always forget and go back! Tonight they forgot part of the paid for order and didn't give me time to order extra sauce. 
On TOP of all that- sitting at the drive through window, I watched an employee take a bite of cake with her bare hands- rinse them off with no soap and then go bag my food! GROSS!!! 
It's not that good of food! I'll find a different place for hot dogs and Italian beef sandwiches. 

Sad waste of money, time, and now my husband is sick too (we are different things so I'm hoping I don't get sick!)"}
{"text":"Heard tons about this place. Went for lunch today, food was good, service was good, the atmosphere was god awful. So it was lunchtime,  I'll take that into consideration,  but there's a whole lot goin on in there. Microphones calling out numbers, 5 maybe 7 different lines, signs, people everywhere, cleaning, taking trays etc... drive through had their own traffic director..
I felt so rushed to eat because of the overall noise volume in there..sounds weird, I'm sure. But I was shoveling my salad down all stressed out..ha-ha. . 
I recommend some noise cancelling panels or something. I'm sure chicagoians  could take a nap and feel right at peace, but I left with a headache and a tummy ache.. 
My salad WAS amazing..and the hotdog is legendary, so we will be back, I'll pack my ear plugs on the next visit!"}
{"text":"This place is grubin'. The beef and Italian sausage sandwich will change and shorten your life for all the right reasons. Their pasta is also great. 
Very casual dining and great for all ages."}
{"text":"Loved my loaded dog! Service was amazing, I got a one on one tutorial of the menu by a woman who greeted me as she was cleaning tables because it was my first time there. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"People who know what customer service is all about. Patience because it's so hard to select what to eat because it's ALL good. Fast service, the order is always right. The are very good about cleaning tables immediately. Nice outside patio to eat at. Good job keep it up."}
{"text":"Love Portillo's! I used to go to the Buena Park, CA location all of the time before moving to Arizona. So glad they opened one in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"The burgers and salads are also great in case you're not in the mood for hotdogs. Everyone enjoyed their food except for one that had average ribs, nothing special. Our friend from Chicago loved his beef sandwich. I would definitely come here again in a heart beat and I don't think I'm alone on this. 

If you like Chicago style hotdogs you must eat here if you're in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Bad drive through service, the cashier repeated my order wrong and then dropped my debit card out of the drive through window. My French onion soup was awful, salty and flavorless. I dumped it out of my car window after a few spoonfuls. No idea what was floating in it, rubbery cheese and tasteless bread. The hot dog was edible, at least. I will never go to Portillo's again."}
{"text":"I always feel guilty when I write a review for a place that specializes in a particular food, e.g. hot dogs, sausage, etc. and I go and order something completely out of the norm.  Please take that as a disclaimer.  In this case, I visited the renowned Portillo's Hot Dogs and ordered what?  A vegetable sandwich.  Guilty as charged.

Once I read the description on the menu, I knew I had to try it.  It promised me freshly grilled veggies,  mushrooms and Havarti cheese on grilled foccacia.  The promise of yum.  Unfortunately, the sandwich didn't really deliver.  The positives:  it was large (enough for two meals) and served piping hot.  Unfortunately, I couldn't distinguish the flavor of any of the vegetables.  Everything just combined and it wasn't very tasty.  I think the mushrooms were overpowering.  Again, I get it.  This is not their specialty and I won't hold it against them, too much.  On a positive note, I like their fries.  They were served fresh with just the right amount of salt.

Service was fairly friendly.  The drive-thru is efficient although I got a very confused server who kept trying to deliver the wrong order to my car. Bottom line:  I am game to try it again, when I'm in the mood for a hot dog."}
{"text":"Anyone that has spent any amount of time in Chicago or its surrounding suburbs knows about Portillo's.  These folks will not look to Yelp for a recommendation.  The Portillo's beef is legendary.  

For those not accustomed to Portillo's this is the place to go for a true Italian beef.  I've had a few out here.  With the exception of Dazzo's Dog House I have not been impressed.  Portillo's delivers the goods.  You can also get Chicago dogs, Italian sausage, burgers, chicken sandwiches, catering, shakes, malts and killer fries.  

The restaurant is large and will accommodate a lot of people even with the hoards flocking to a new restaurant. 

For my money you cannot beat the beef sandwich dipped with mozzarella.  It's my standard order."}
{"text":"Food was good, service was a little slow, but they try.  Decent selection and quality hot dogs."}
{"text":"Consistently awesome. I would rather come here than go to any fast food joint anywhere. (Except Tommy's)."}
{"text":"Have ate there twice in the last 2 weeks. Love the burgers and onion rings. They are fast and the very clean. Would recommend to friends and family."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS! order the Italian beef, extra gravy with Mozz. Cheese! Crinkle cut fries! They also have awesome a STELLAR chopped salad, hot dogs, and chocolate cake shake! Yum!! Always hot good Chicago style food :)"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the food, a tad pricey but it's good wholesome food and nowadays you pay for what you get."}
{"text":"I've waited 13 years for this place to open up here in the Phoenix Valley - and I wasn't disappointed... Coming from Chicago area we went a couple times a month.. The Hot Dogs, Beef sandwiches and Burgers are without match here in the valley... Others may claim they make a Chicago-style hot-dog, but if you want the real thing go to Portillo's !!!"}
{"text":"I know, 3 stars for Portillo's...what's wrong with you?  Let me start of by saying that I'm a huge fan of Portillo's.  I was there on opening day and I'm back today with my family introducing them to all that is great about Chicago except.........it wasn't a good experience.  Here is what was wrong:

- Cheese sauce was burnt.  You couldn't see it looking at it but you could certainly taste it.  Very disappointing.

- My wife ordered a sprite and they attempted to give her a Coke and eventually gave her a cup of Soda Water.  I would have gone back but given the line, why bother?

I love you Portillo's and I will certainly give you another shot but please make sure the standards are being met!"}
{"text":"The most impressive thing of this place is the size of the restaurant and how packed it was.

My experience though was far away from great.

I ordered a hot dog (the lady who helped me said it was their flagship dish) an also ordered a cheese burger for my companion. I also got cheesy fries.

After a long wait because they wrote the wrong number in my order (no apologize, effort to make up, anything) I told the people over there two times that I thought my order was the one that has been sitting there forever. They called the number again and finally gave it to me.

The styrofoam cup for my drink make me start thinking that that place wasn't as great as I've heard but I continued to my table. I mean, I'm not a tree hugger but styrofoam is a little too much. When we arrived to the table I opened the bag and I saw that the burger was also in a styrofoam box. I mean, even one of the public enemies, the one with the golden arches, quit using this s!@#t like back in the 80's, AYFKM, Portillo's?

Now the food. The hot dog was totally uneventful and super small (super cheap as well, but I didn't want to make the line again).

The burger also forgettable as well as the fries.

After posting on FB that I wasn't impressed, some people told me to try the beef sandwich.

I might do it and might update this post.

Not impressed at all."}
{"text":"Drove through on the way back from picking up my son in law whom is very familiar with Portilllo's in Chicago. Sadly his take on this was: Italian beef was tough like leather! NO flavor! This is what happens when one sells out goes chain!"}
{"text":"It was good.  The burger tasted charbroiled and delicious.  The onion rings were crispy and great.  The drive thru was awkward  and a little uncomfortable...forced conversation as three young men stand by your car as you wait for your order..... But they were very nice and professional.... Get the poor guys a car port so they aren't melting on the az heat!"}
{"text":"Oh.....My.....Goodness!!! Cheap and greasy and love in a bag. 

We ordered ahead to-go (which was recommended by a coworker). When we got there - it was the busiest restuarant I've seen for lunch probably ever. And they were flipping tables quick. The line was fast and efficient."}
{"text":"I FINALLY stopped in to Portillo's on Friday for lunch with a Chicago native that moved to our Phoenix office. I had no idea what to expect other than knowing they took over the old spot that Uncle Sam's used to fill on 91st and Shea. 

First off, I COULD NOT BELIEVE how busy it was, especially for a weekday lunch in an area without a large concentration of businesses (I work downtown). Drive through line was a mile long (but seemed to be moving quickly). When we got inside I was shocked at the amount of people cramed into this large space. Not a table to be found and long lines again, but we had made the drive so there was no turning back... Glad we didn't because that line moved quickly also.

My buddy and I both got the \"combo\" sandwich, which is an Italian Beef with a sausage stuck in there also. Strangly enough my Chicago friend got a chicken sandwich, which apparently he loves there.

Cool thing about the \"combo\", or just regular beef sandwiches, is you can choose how much \"gravy\" you want on them. Hardly any, some poured on top, or, and of course the one that I picked, DIPPED. They dip the who damn sandwich in the \"gravy\" (beef drippings). NOW THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKIN BOUT.

We got cheese fries too. Fries were good but they put the cheese on the side...kind of a bummer, BUT the sandwiches were excellent... Best Italian Beef I've had other than Luke's of Chicago on Indian School, which is quite a compliment.

We did end up finding seats by the way. Very crowded place, but a lot of turnover, so if you just wait a second something will pop up.

Prices were excellent also. Most sandwiches were right around $5 bucks, even the Halibut fish sandwich, which I gotta try next...I'll be back. Gotta try the dogs too!!

Enjoy"}
{"text":"Better than Portillo's original place in Chicago.  The Chicago beef was outstanding, as were the beans and slaw.  Service was so fast, we almost missed our tray!!!  The gravy is the best, along with the fries."}
{"text":"I had the Portillo's all beef hotdog, it was filling and delicious. I can't wait to come back and try the Italian sausage next time."}
{"text":"Man, this place is run like a well oiled machine for sure, almost military style! I had been dreading coming here as I am not a fan of crowds or lines. There are always crowds and long lines here, but don't let that discourage you, they really do go fast. From the items I've had I would recommend the Italian beef sandwich, the cheese fries and the chocolate cake shake. Not so much the chili cheese fries, or the croissant beef sandwich- they were OK, but I think the portions are on the smaller side, and the meat lacks some flavor. But don't get me wrong, its good grub and all. Its just all the crazy hype holds it up too high, and its hard to meet those expectations. 

Tip - they ship their food all over the US- how cool is that?"}
{"text":"Love the Italian beef sandwiches, but the preparation seems inconsistent. Sometimes it arrives moist, but last time I went it was downright soggy and dripping au jus (or whatever you'd call it). 

Fries are always great and a piece of their chocolate cake pretty decent. 

Great decor and large seating areas, both inside and out. The place looks great. 

It's not cheap. Two Italian beefs, a large fries, soft drink, and plain hot dog and you're north of $20. Oh yeah, and they charge for hot/sweet peppers. And the staff isn't always \"there\" - e.g. wishing you a good day at 7 pm. :-/"}
{"text":"We were great fans of Portillo's when it first opened, even though there were long lines.

I am from Chicago and appreciated that they brought hometown favorites here to Scottsdale.

Tonight, we ordered one of the Chicago basics to go:  a big, Italian beef sandwich, wet, on a crispy roll with sweet peppers and extra a jus on the side

It came back on a burnt roll, dry, with 3 overcooked pepper slivers that looked like they were from yesterday's leftovers and  
a 1/2 full, tiny cup of a jus.

When I called the manager, Peter about the problem, he could not be any more rude, unhelpful and condescending and 
finally said we could expect a refund in 7-10 days, 
 
When, after 10 minutes waiting for and talking to him, I asked to talk with his boss, he said Jim had left for the day. 
No I'm sorry.  No how can we make this right.
No nothing.

My advice:  
Stay away from this used to be a good place and go to Spinato's or Vermont Sandwich Company for a great beef sandwich,
They understand being gracious to their customers; consistently serve real, quality food; and stand behind what they sell."}
{"text":"The chili cheese dog was to die for...it still had that awesome snap when I bit into it. The taste was amazing. Service was good and cheese fries I got to dip myself. I will be back!"}
{"text":"A taste of home - without the snow and wind. They do it right. The quality is consistently high, servings plentiful and reasonably priced. Don't be afraid of a long line they move it through with amazing efficiency.

The Italian Beef, sweet with extra gravy is my go to. I've heard that the salads are great but that just seems wrong to this Chicago girl.

Oh and the chocolate cake - not too sweet, creamy frosting - yummmmmm"}
{"text":"I'm giving this a 2 star, not because of the food, which was good and ok, but the people working there are so unfriendly and rude inside the restaurant.   When they first opened a couple years ago, the staff was super friendly, now...Nope!  It really makes your experience there unpleasant.  I think they need to have a change of staff or have a talk with them.  I know I won't be back, and if I do, it will be thru the drive-thru window."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. My friends wanted me to try this so I did. I got 2 hot dogs with fries and their chocolate cake shake. The hot dogs were one of the best I've had and I loved the crinkle cut fries. I added ketchup, mustard, tomatoes and onions and honestly it was all on point. I was not disappointed. The price is fair too. Not too expensive. Next time I will try their burgers."}
{"text":"The General Manager (female Caucasian) has the worst customer service of anything I've ever seen! I want to start out by saying the food is great! My dad took my boys here and they loved the hot dogs! But today was our first visit and our order was messed up somehow we ordered a hot dog and instead we were charged and given another item. Since I had never been there before today I went to explain at the window where food is picked up. An employee (female) saw the issue and showed me on the bag (where order was written) and compared receipt and the two were different. She tried explaining this to the general manager and before we could explain the General Manager says \"nope all your order was there I put it on there myself\" then the employee tries to explain to the GM and she had a very no care attitude and said \"everything you paid for was on the tray and if we are missing something the register is down there if you wanna buy something else\". She didn't even care what me or the employee were saying. I explained this is my first time there would she like to come and check out our order and see what exactly is missing cause I don't know what everyone ordered I just know what is missing which is one hot dog. I said if it was missed we can pay for it but I need help figuring out what exactly was missing. She refused. Then another manager very nice manager (female with light red hair) overheard our convo...she offered to help and come to my table. Then when we came back the same rude GM was speaking to my father and husband and she was basically making it seem like we were lying. The red headed manager lady that was nice said ok this is what's going on and the rude GM was still pushing back although the issue had now been figured out. They wrote our order down but didn't charge us. I offered to pay again and again the GM was rude and said \"like I said the register is down there\" and I said ok I would also like to get your higher ups info, she rudely tells me \"oh he is here I'll go get him\" all the while the employee and red headed manager we're both  apologetic. They said \"sorry we can't do anything she is the GM so she is our boss\"! To the Caucasian female general manager, You need to really learn some customer service skills FROM YOUR EMPLOYEES!!! When we left my husband had gotten a refill and one of your employees apologized again and said they hoped we tried to at least enjoy our meal after that! She said most of the people there strive to provide a great experience and she hoped we give another chance! And my husband thanked her and we left! Shame on you for not listening to your customers and furthermore not listening to your employees!"}
{"text":"I'm hard pressed to give 5 stars because really is there ever a perfect business!?

I've been here a few times and have always had good food.  I normally get the hot dog but today I got the Polish dog. I'm not a fan of grilled onions so I should have ordered it with raw onions. It had a very good taste but a bit too grilled on the ends.

The bun was soft and delicious while the fries were crispy and well cooked.

Ordering is easy and if it's really busy you might want to stand at the counter because of the noise you can't hear your order number called out.

I would also recommend getting a slice of cake, especially the chocolate cake!  Fun music, good food and lots of seating make for a comfortable dining experience."}

{"text":"Love this Place! My wife and I grew up in Des Plaines just outside of Chicago. The Italian Beefs are the same as back home. Make sure you ask them to Dip it! I also like sweet and hot peppers and an occasional Italian sausage thrown in there.My wife loves the Beef and Cheddar Croissants. Don't forget some Cheese Fries and their Chocolate Cake Shake. Thanks for opening so close to our house. Now we don't have to fly back to Chi-town for great food!"}
{"text":"LOVE IT! Being Italian and from the Northeast, a roast beef sandwich is like a weekly must have!! My dad kept raving about this place so i finally went with him to see what he has been talking about for the past 5 months. I ordered the Roast beef sandwich with mozzarella cheese and hot peppers with a coke. IT WAS SO GOOD! The roast beef was cut perfectly and tasted amazing! The bread was crispy on the outside but the inside had absorbed all that roast beef juice and flavor! This was like heaven to my lips! It brought back those heavenly flavors and memories of when I was a fat kid visiting my grandparents and eating roast beef sandwiches for dinner! I now see what my dad was telling me about!  I found my new favorite place in Scottsdale! The place itself reminded me of New York, New Jersey, or Chicago and they were very quick to make the order. This place is great for when I am craving those foods I usually get back east."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Chicago style beef and this place does it right. This is a must if you're in the Tempe area and looking for a great sandwich or or great atmosphere. The service is fast without sacrificing quality. You can dine in and take in all the Chicago nostalgia or be through the drive-thru in minutes if you are in a rush and need a quick bite. Great food, great experience."}
{"text":"Some of the worst customer service I've ever received (if you could even call it service). This was my first time ever at Portillo's and from the moment I ordered to the moment I left the experience was terrible.

My order was put in wrong, I was charged too much, and I had to talk to the manager (who argued with me and was incredibly rude, demanding he was right) into giving me a refund for something they:
a) charged me for without me ordering it
b) never gave to me regardless

To top it all off, when I went to get a refill I was yelled at by another employee saying I wasn't standing close enough to the counter ?"}
{"text":"Still my favorite Italian beef place I always get the big beef dry hot gravy on the side love the crunchy bread the hot peppers and their beef is just different than anyone else in Phoenix and it's pretty consistent from the one on Shea and the one in Tempe had the hot dogs they're okay their hamburger suck milkshakes not any better than QT gas station and I think QT so I suggest just get the Italian beef the best around Phoenix that I have found definitely will be back"}
{"text":"I think is the best beef in town it's all about that bread nice a crunchy hold up nice to the gravy hot and dry that how I like mine maybe some gravy on the side today I over did it I ate two big beef and cheese fries and a shake everyone is welcoming"}
{"text":"It's Portillos, what's not to love. Well, the line, but worth the wait. Great food and friendly employees."}
{"text":"I know that this place is a cult favorite for many of the midwest people. Hotdogs, sausage, chili, burgers, and sliced beef compose their menu. This certainly is not a go-to place for me, but I will go when one of my friends wants home food. I typically go for the salads, and have learned to always ask for dressing on the side.

My biggest wish is for them to have a kid sized menu, as for my 6 year old, I order the regular item, and it is never eaten. This is something that for the most part she will note eat left over."}
{"text":"Was too lazy to make my salad this evening so decided to come here for a chop salad not bad it was Tasty"}
{"text":"Portillos my love. Any Chicagoan knows and loves Portillos! That being said I've tried many a replica restaurants of places I used to eat back home and usually they arnt the same something is always a little off, but not at portillos. Fresh strawberry shakes or a cake shake if you dare. Beef and cheddar extra gravy please! Portillos makes being away from home just a bit more bare able."}
{"text":"So I'm just going to be honest overall I just wasn't a fan of the food overall. The atmosphere was nice and had that old school diner feel. So for a place you can sit down and feel comfortable. We ordered two hog dogs and a charbroiled chicken sandwich. The hot dogs were unremarkable. The chicken sandwich was good but the toppings and bread did nothing to aide in the flavor. I ended up pulling the chicken out and eating it by itself. Overall I'm not bashing the place, after leaving here I was already looking forward to my next meal."}
{"text":"Came with a large group and had an excellent meal. Everyone agreed that this was awesome.  Great food. Great vibrant ambiance. Service was excellent! Not much more to say than that. Wish we had one back home!!! Probably a good idea that there isn't though lol we will be back next time we are in AZ!"}
{"text":"I m from Chicago and I love Portillos but tonight they got my order totally wrong and they put me on hold for a long time. So disappointed. Careless staff that don't know the difference between chocolate shake and vanilla shake and sometimes they forget to put all the food in the to go bag. Shitty service sorry"}
{"text":"Im from IL, Portillo's fan for many years but rarely get to stop in. Went today as a treat and order my standard cheesy italian beef, small fry and drink. $12. Come on, thats getting way too greedy for me."}
{"text":"Does not matter if you're in the Windy, out in Shakey Town or in the Sticker Patch PORTEIIOS IS THE SAME !!!!! High Quality Food, Friendly Staff, and the Store makes you feel at home"}
{"text":"What can I say, I love Portillo's. My favorite dinner here is an Italian beef (prime roast beef, soaked in au jus type sauce) sandwiched between pillows of the softest bread imaginable and then dunked again into sauce. It's amazing, and messy, but mostly amazing.

Also, the cheese fries are de-lish. I normally am anti-fake-liquid-cheese, but this cheese is like a creamy bowl of macaroni and cheese sent from heaven to dip your perfect french-fries in; a dangerous combination!

The chocolate cake is delicious. I also love the chocolate cake shake -- chocolate shake with chocolate cake crumbles. Yum, yum, yum! Naomi Garnice gives it two thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"Deliciousness!! That's what I say after each visit to Portillo's!  This is a legendary Chicago restaurant...entering this restaurant brings me right back home.

Hands down the best beef sandwich in the valley!  Make sure to get it dipped for an extra soggy bun.   The fries are crispy with the perfect amount of salt.   Top it off with a Chocolate Shake and you have yourself a meal!  The hot dogs are authentic And actually have a poppy seed bun....a rare find in AZ!  

I love this place and will continue to come back again and again.  You can take the girl out of Chicago, but you can't take Chicago out of the girl.  Thanks for Portillo's for giving me a little piece of home right here in AZ!"}
{"text":"I love Portillo's. I try not to go too often because what I enjoy is 1/2 my calorie intake for the day but once in awhile shouldn't kill me. I love the Italian beef dipped, the Chicago dog, burger & salads well just everything I've eaten. This location has a good mix of peeps from old timers to little ones running amuck. Very loud. Definitely not a first date place unless you wanna patio it. So go forth & eat their fine Chicago fair. You will love it."}
{"text":"Very good! Service is fast casual in that you order at the counter and pick a seat inside or outside. I was impressed with the cleanliness of the restaurant, and the service was friendly. Food was good- freshly prepared and quickly. Large menu to choose from (salads, pasta, hot dogs, burgers, fries, etc). 4/5!"}
{"text":"Cheesy fries are awesome, so was the Strawberry Shortcake. The fruit and chicken salad was really refreshing."}
{"text":"My sister and I ate here on Friday and now have food poisoning. We shared a meal and haven't seen each other since, but we both have food poisoning.

My sister got it worse than me and she ordered a second sandwich to go and ate it later.

The food was good but now I'm not so sure about the quality."}
{"text":"When it comes to Chicago hot dogs or Italian beefs, you cant get better than Portillos!   Sure there are places around the valley to go get a Chicago dog or beef, but Portillos has them all beat hands down.  I got the Italian beef dipped with hot and sweet peppers on top, my wife had their hot dog, and we both had their crinkle fries.  This food was so freakin good, it's like we were back in the windy city.

We went on opening day, and the line was out the door, and wrapped though the parking lot.  This didn't phase us, as the food is well worth the wait.  I cant estimate how many people were standing in line, but it took us about 1.5 hours to get our food.  The staff at Portillos were on top of it though! Tables were being cleaned as fast as they were being filled, cooks were sending out food as fast as possible, and all employees had very positive attitudes.

Bottom line: Awesome food & great service! I cant wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Who would've known amongst the raging heat of a Phoenix summer there'd be a Portillos!?! It couldn't be further from Chicago...but the two Chicago dogs and friendly staff lived up to the standard...right down to rhyming order numbers \" 188 don't be late your food is ready\"...this place rocks"}
{"text":"I love this place!  I've had the Chicago dog and the beef sandwich with extra gravy.  Both were very good and service was quick.  Their chocolate cake is also very delicious.  It's quite an experience here.  More of an old school flare where you order your meal at one window and pickup at the next before seating yourself.  Fun if you like that type of eatery!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. When ever you ask something extra added. Yes. They actually do it. So many choices. 
It was A tough decision. Chicago hot dog plus just what ever you want. So awesome. 
Restaurant. And restrooms are very clean. 
Yes. I highly recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"Portillo's in Chicago is a MUST. Portillo's in Arizona, meh. Scottsdale location better than Tempe location, and I only say this because you can taste that lovely Tempe waste/tap water taste in the food."}
{"text":"Went to lunch here for the first time to try it and was very disappointed. The hot dog was small and the bun was soggy and smashed. Toppings were sparse and poor quality (the relish is dyed green). The side salad was fair. The place was busy, I don't understand the hype. Decent service and clean place but I won't be back."}
{"text":"Being from Chicago, it's pretty obvious how I feel about Portillos.... their food is delicious!! It hits the spot every time! Their hotdogs are amazing and pair perfectly with fries and the onion rings. The service is also very good. I've never encountered an issue. But they're always very friendly. The only thing I noticed today, was that by the time I went to eat my hot dog, the bun was a little soggy, like it had been sitting for a bit. But still very tasty! I love coming here. Don't forget to add a shake or malt!! You'll thank me :)"}
{"text":"Great food but terrible service. The drive-thru lane was packed as to be expected but they have three people outside, one taking your order, the other confirming it, & the last one taking your money. When you get near the window, they pass out the food to one of the outside workers and you just see this food being taken out to the cars lined behind you. Saw this happen 7 times to the cars behind us. And then their cars move into the passing lane to leave. Completely frustrating to see the cars that have ordered after you and as such have not been waiting as long get served. Ridiculous!!!! Especially having to wait longer with our two year old in the car."}
{"text":"Very disappointing experience. My family visited the Tempe location on Wednesday June, 10 2105. We arrived about 7:00 pm. The place wasn't busy and there was no line. After spending $52.00 on a dinner for 5,  the wait to get the food was long. On top of it, the order was wrong. Why write what we order on the bag if the people making the food don't read it. It wasn't a complicated order. 

The food was subpar at best.  Seriously, for the money we spent it sucked.   My predictions is you will out price your customer base with the service and quality of food you serve. You have numerous people working, yet nobody managing how the production is completed. From the lack of attention to detail (Wrong order) to the lack of sense of urgency (length of time to get the food) your company is not worth my time or money. I expect this from McDonald's or another fast food restaurant but not when I drop some serious coin on food. 

I'm taking my business elsewhere Portillo's."}
{"text":"I will not waste much of your time or mine in this review....if you like McDonalds quality burgers then come here, otherwise stay as far away as possible. Went with my wife and two kids, ordered three burgers and one beef sandwich. The burgers were total garbage. The beef sandwich was edible but not much better. Stay away and do not waste your money. If Yelp would permit zero stars that is what I would give this place....lucky for them I suppose."}
{"text":"Had the Italian Beef today and it reminded me of the good ole days in Chicago. Moving to Phoenix made me miss all my favorites from Chicago. The Italian Beef was sheer heaven! Went through drive thru and and our order was perfect. Employees were friendly and knowledge. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Have come here multiple times. Food is fine but nothing outstanding. The place is ALWAYS busy and ALWAYS crowded. The die-hard snowbirds are serious about their hot dogs. The chili fries are good. I would rather go to Teds and skip the crowd."}
{"text":"This place is really good. We got the cheese fries, Italian beefand a chocolate cake shake and they were the business. We made the trip from Peoria and it was worth it."}
{"text":"Omg such an awesome place,  I went with a co worker and we got the hot dogs with everything on in garbage salad and then a mint chocolate chip shake. We also had fries and onion rings and omg everything was me good and this was my first time here"}
{"text":"Came here with coworkers and it was really delicious. Italian beef and sausage combo was bomb. Will definitely order again. Crinkle cut fries were alright, nothing special. I didn't really care for the cake shake, it was just a weird texture. I liked the restaurant itself with a lot to look at on the walls. Good vibes and a really great staff. Everyone who interacted with us was wonderful."}
{"text":"I usually don't drink the Kool-Aid when it comes to the \"new place in town\" but I had  two frinds of mine from Chicago SWEAR by this place, and there were DEAD on. The place is huge with a super large menu but do not pass go, and get you the beef sandwich. YOu can add peppers or onions, I only added cheese to get the full taste of the beef. The bread is baked in  house and AMAZING. the beef was super tender and just done perfect. I've had Italian beef sandwiches before and they were just okay, but this one will make  you a believer! I also had the tamale ina  bowl, that was a midwestern style tamale covered in chili. Anotehr cool dish. I have been DYING to go back since I went for the first time. Go now. Eat Beef Sandwich. Then Go again."}
{"text":"Portillo's is great Chicago food and they are in Phoenix! Double Italian beef with a chocolate cake shake is the way to go. Now they just need to open in Atlanta. Please come to the Atl, we'll pack the place I promise."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for a hot dog, noticed the sign while driving on Shea and pulled in around 1:15 pm. People were starting to clear out, but the lobby and seating area was still packed. 

The decor was interesting and comfortable. This operation is very fast paced as Nydia mentioned in her review. What I like about the layout is you can see them preparing your food and it appears extremely well maintained, clean and organized. 

Update 1/2/14: Jumbo chili dog with grilled onions is messy and not much to brag about. The itailan beef was good, but not sure I agree with the masses on this one."}
{"text":"Being a kid and taking small road trips to Chicago we would stop in and have hot dogs... I never knew there was a Portillos in Arizona until I passed by today... I was so disappointed. The food was terrible compared to the origami Chicago locations. Onion rings had basically no onions in them. It was fried breading. The hotdogs tasted as if they were reheated frozen beef franks. The chili wasn't very warm and there was way too much cheese on the hotdog. Was not impressed at all. And I have never felt so sick in my entire life after eating lunch. Not worth your money. And not worth the sickness."}
{"text":"So grateful that there's a local Portillo's now! I've been with people who aren't from Chicago and they thought the ordering process was weird, but to me it was normal since I grew up with it. Portillo's has it down to a science on how to get orders out as efficiently as possible regardless of how many customers are there. The only thing I order is the Italian beef with hot peppers on the side and it is exactly like the sandwich you would get at a Portillo's around Chicago. 

The only con to my review has to do with the physical location of the restaurant itself. It's in a really weird corner of Tempe Marketplace which is hard (or maybe not possible) to get to from the main parts of Tempe Marketplace without going on McClintock or Rio Salado."}
{"text":"This place already has a plethora of reviews so mine really isn't needed but since I'm a hot dog fan I had to say something. The Chicago dog was amazing as expected, all the fixings on a steamed bun! The fries were underwhelming and needed more seasoning. The Chili Cheese Tamale was surprisingly good but you feel guilty with each bite ( I swear that thing has to be a million calories alone and only God knows what they are using as the filler!). The stand out thing here for me is the service. This place has excellent customer service, from the time you walk in till the time you walk out their employees make you feel at home and that's something I really cherish. In this day in age when most establishments are only concerned about your money, Portillo's goes the extra mile to make your overall experience great."}
{"text":"I love a good Italian beef sandwich, and they have a great one.  It's so good that it's the only thing I ever get.  I like it dipped, with sweet green peppers.  It's messy and if you're a slow eater, your bread will be completely dissolved before you get to the end.  I definitely wouldn't get this to go.  Be sure to grab a stack of napkins and get ready to bulldog it."}
{"text":"Just wanted to give MAJOR PROPS to the Portillo's Staff on their Grand Opening!  They did an amazing job to make sure things ran efficient and people got their food.  It was a bright move for the Management to not let people reserve seats until they got their food.  By doing so, it allowed everyone to have a chance to find an open seat and enjoy their meal.  

The turnout for this Grand Opening was unreal.  The line was long and continued to grow throughout the night.  I got in line at around 5pm with maybe 100+ people in front of me.  My wife joined me in line 15 minutes later and I only moved maybe 20 ft.  It took about 1 hour 30 min to get our food but we had no complaints.  The line moved fairly quickly for the amount of people that were there.  There was a good control of the line, didn't notice anyone cutting or anything.  

Now onto the reason why we went there.  Since it was our first time at Portillo's, the wife and I decided to try out a few things.  We got the Hot Dog with everything on it, the Jumbo Chili Cheese Dog, Italian Beef with sweet peppers and mozarella cheese, large fries, and a Large Chocolate Cake Shake.  Everything was delicious!!  Between the two hot dogs, I enjoyed the regular hot dog with everything on it instead.  The Italian beef was amazing. I will ask for gravy on the side the next time I go so I can dip my sandwich in it.  The chocolate cake shake was like heaven in your mouth.  It was that good.  I think getting a large of that is just too much sweets for even two people.  I would get a smaller size the next time.

It was a great experience to be there on the Grand Opening day.  We will definitely be going back on our cheat days!"}
{"text":"$0.60 for peppers on my Italian Beef! 
Soggy bread and meat with no flavor. Did not live up to all the hype. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Portillos about 30 times since they've opened at this location.  The service us nothing short of outstanding. The food is amazing. I haven't tried the salads, but I highly recommend the chili cheese dog, the Italian beef, the Halibut Sandwich, spaghetti with meat sauce, and the grilled chicken sandwich. This is a reliable favorite.  The chocolate cake is the best. The service matches the food."}
{"text":"Just try it! Move over Teds. Hot dogs, italian beef, chicken sandwiches and burgers...all good. Oh and the cheese fries are a must add to any order. The only thing on the menu I didn't care for is the tamales...not worth the $3."}
{"text":"Portillos wtf with the gross cheese! I hope it's not company wide! Grosss!!! Low quality . No shock AZ sucks!"}
{"text":"I wanted to write this review and just repeatedly say \"get the Italian beef dipped with hot and sweet peppers\". 

With that being said don't forget the cheese fry and chocolate cake shake. 

I've had the ribs delicious, tamale delicious, hotdogs delicious and a lot of other stuff which all was delicious. 

With that being said get the Italian beef dipped with hot and sweet peppers. It will change your life for the better. 

Lastly, this is exactly the same as in Chicago. I thought for sure there had to be a difference but I was wrong."}
{"text":"I am not from the Midwest but my wife is and she insisted that I must try it.  I was not impressed by the food. I am not sure what it was with all this big hype?!  COSTCO has better hotdogs and the Italian sandwiches are good but not great. If you are in the neighbourhood go give it a try but to go out of your way to get here I think it's not worth the trouble."}
{"text":"This place is too hectic, too unorganized, and worst of all, customer service is awful. I think it's inherent in their setup and restaurant design to be a failure. Yelling at customers to \"move out of the hallway\", the careless attitude amongst every employee, and the general crazy atmosphere. Normally I'd dismiss that kind of stuff if the quality of the food was amazing, but the food is just meh. Certainly doesn't live up to the hype I always hear about it. Customer service can make or break an experience, and it mostly just shattered this one."}
{"text":"I love Portillos!

I try to go everytime I'm around one.  And the one in Tempe maintains the same quality as those shops in Chicago that they emulate.  I'm a big fan of the Italian beef sandwiches, especially, but also the Chicago dogs, sausage sandwiches, and even their salads.

If you grew up in Chicago, you will not be disappointed.  If you didn't, you'll soon want to visit the Windy City."}
{"text":"What can I say?  I love Chicago foods and Portillo's delivers with their hot dogs, sausage and Italian beef sandwiches.  It is the best Chicago food (minus the pizza) outside of the Windy City.  I'm glad there are enough patrons of this culinary treat to keep the chain profitable."}
{"text":"Really confused about this particular location.  I've been three times in the past two months; each time I ordered the hot ceasar salad.  Each time I was told \"we dont have broiled chicken\".  At what point do you take the item off your menu?!  If not, order the broiled chicken!!  This is ridiculous."}
{"text":"What an experience - that's all I can say after a recent trip to the new Portillo's in Scottsdale!  We decided to brave the crowds on a Saturday afternoon before a spring training game.  Thanks to an early game we got a good start at Portillo's around 11AM, which I think SOMEWHAT helped with the crowds.  Thankfully we found a parking spot quickly and hurried into the line that was already outside the door.  Inside was PACKED and a bit overwhelming for a person who isn't too keen on crowds.  After placing our order one person in our party stayed in line to pay and two of us looked for a seat.  It took a good 10 minutes walking back and forth to finally get a seat.  People were pushing and shoving the whole time - not fun.

Once we finally were sitting and our food was received, we all calmed down and scarfed our food.  I had a hot dog, which was fab.  I really enjoyed it!  The fries were great as well... only wish we would have gotten more!  The Hubs had an italian beef sandwich and we really liked it.  He got it plain and said next time he wants peppers for sure.

We all really enjoyed the food here, though the crowds were CRAZY!  Not sure it will get any better anytime soon, but perhaps in the future when I am brave again we will give this place a second go around.  For now, I will wait to see if the masses die down.... I doubt they will!"}
{"text":"I was really surprised at how much the family enjoyed this place. It is far from fine dining, but it really hits the spot. The hot dogs are the only thing we have ordered besides the desserts ...also awesome!
Their chili cheese dogs are amazing, as are all the others. I love the actual hot dog itself. I don't know where I could buy them, or we would be having them all the time. Everyone ordered a different hot dog, and french fries as well as a dessert, there were no complaints from anyone. If anything, we thought about going back to get another hot dog as one wasn't enough! I would recommend this to anyone who likes an occasional hot dog."}
{"text":"You come here for the beef and that is all.  Have it dipped and served with peppers.

Do not consider anything else on the menu.  I reluctantly tried a hot dog today, full well knowing I would regret the decision later, but just had to try something else out of curiosity.  

The hot dog was good.  My friend said his tamale was good.

We both lost to our other friend who had the dipped beef with peppers.

It's a damn good sandwich, and you'll be happy you got it."}
{"text":"Ah, Portillo's. Thank you for finally opening a restaurant in AZ! Every Chicagoan grows up on this food, and we adore it. Best french fries around, great charbroiled burgers, and you can never go wrong with a chocolate cake shake. Delicious chocolate shake + piece of delicious chocolate cake INSIDE the shake = heaven. Love me some Portillo's!"}
{"text":"By far the BEST hot dog joint in town! A must try is the Italian beef sausage with sweet and hot peppers dipped (in gravy) sounds weird but it creates an orgasmic combination of flavors! Melts in your mouth. Don't be deceived by my poor photography skills as the photo does no justice. Also the chili cheese dog and regular hot dog was tasty! The bun is top notch, it is soft, fluffy and fresh tasting -you can tell it's a quality bun!!! Seriously best choice for affordable gourmet food and the service is phenomenal, FAST and friendly!! This is foodie paradise."}
{"text":"I honestly don't understand the appeal of this place. I've been here three times now and all three have been utterly mediocre. From the soggy, fairly bland and tasteless food to the disinterested, disconnected customer service. Not even the soda is good as the syrup mixture is so low that it tastes mostly like club soda."}
{"text":"Have eaten here several times.  Ordered the burger bun was so soggy from the grease.  I spoke with manger completely unapologetic.  He said he would have another one made.  He brought one out there was grease down the side of the bag.  Upon opening the burger container grease dropped out.  I picked up the burger and it was literally dripping grease into the container.  A pool of grease in the bottom.  The manager didn't even check it prior to giving to me.  He didn't follow up until he saw me taking pictures of it.  Then came and ask if it was better.  See pictures and the pool of grease."}
{"text":"Great food.  Good service.  Fun atmosphere to eat in.  With all the other good reviews on this place not much more to say.  Give it a try if you are in the area.  If you are a fan of Italian beef dipped sandwiches you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"You cannot go wrong with Portillo's, my boyfriend and I live in Vegas.  No Portillo's here ( I wish )!  So on our way back from road tripping from Atlanta I picked Scottsdale to stay a night specifically to visit this place!  I had it in Chicago a few times and loved it!  I always get the dipped Italian beef and a Chicago dog.  
My boyfriend had a salad and chicken parm they were both delicious too!  Hope to make it back again some day!"}
{"text":"The dogs were celery flavored??? The audacity...
I am truly shook; I was so excited to visit this place & I was left thoroughly disappointed. The best thing was the water. Somehow, the dogs tasted of celery!! How?? I just can't even honestly..."}
{"text":"Why is there an option for delivery time if you are not actually delivering it then? I appreciate the promptness but I choose a specific time because that is when my lunch break starts. I can't come down and get my food from the delivery driver too early without getting in trouble. No issues with the food itself but PLEASE pay attention to delivery time and do t bring it too early or too late. This happened the last time I ordered delivery, too, and the previous delivery person was not as patient as this one."}
{"text":"Amazing place truly felt like a visitor on my 1st time there but overall great place, the italian beef sandwich was great i recommend this place to anybody and of course the Chicago families; )"}
{"text":"I heard about this place for a while now. This is my kind of food! I had to slow down when ordering because I  was thinking with my stomach and not my head. You gotta try the big beef with the hot peppers and mozzarella, you won't regret it. While eating my sandwich I realized I came to a hot dog joint and didn't eat a hot dog,  So I did. The hot dogs are great with everything on them. Great setting for a family! It's definitely the place to go to break your diet."}
{"text":"Ads work!  I happened to glance at the Portillo's logo on a local radio station (1480KPHX) smart phone app the other day and thought, hmmm, I used to like that place in suburban Chicago (Wheaton'ish:  Bloomingdale Rd. at North Ave.) 

Not too long afterward, Saturday afternoon, my ad-brain talked to my tummy-brain and I reacted by punching Portillo's up online to realize they've been in Tempe for three years!  I feel like a loser for not getting out more - especially considering I've been looking for a decent Italian beef forever (Spinato's, Zeeke's, Rosati's for some reason can't soak sliced beef in juice and locate, purchase, bake, borrow or steal an eff'ing decent bread roll to put it on)!  But my immediate need was for a hot dog.  I left Ahwatukee via the 202, took the 101 to Tempe and in 15 mins I was back in Wheaton, IL.

My 'to go' order:  A couple (plain) dogs, a couple Italian Beefs (dry, gravy on the side mentioned specifically for the one-star reviewer below who got a wet sandwich because it hadn't occurred to him that bread splashed with au jus and wrapped in paper would be wet and/or hadn't read the menu's ordering options specifically addressing this matter), and a vanilla shake.

Assessment of the three items, respectively:  Perfect, perfect and, um, well, perfect.

Dog- snappy casing, perfectly steamed but not wet bun

I.B.- just like I craved; plenty of beef slices but not ridiculous copiosity (a phrase I've just penned to describe some novelty joints that compensate quality with quantity); the French roll was perfectly \"toothy\" and fresh; biteable in size; not soggy (note order preference above) and perfectly dippable into the little tub of au jus carefully packed into a plastic bag to catch enroute leakage.

Staff:  Very nice and efficient.  Even the young man who, while straightening his  ordering/cashier station, accidentally knocked about twelve pounds of steel ad signage down on my right hand that I was resting on the counter in front of his till.  Once the pain subsided enough for me to exercise all of my finger joints to verify some modicum of reasonable movement sans protruding bone fragments, I accepted his animated apology (I'm sure his whole career flashed before his eyes) and I proceeded to the pick-up area to await my \"another lame Arizona attempt at Chicago food in a paper bag to deepen my midwest displacement anxiety\".

Order was announced in just a few minutes- enough time so that I knew it was being prepared for me and not a warming tray and fast enough that I didn't become agitated or violently vengeful about the hand injury.

I was wrong.  Portillo's quality and efficiency has not the desert warped.  And, really, my right hand is gaining more mobility by the moment and I plan on using it to enjoy the 1/2 order I saved from yesterday's visit, later today.

Sorry Detroit Coney, I'll be bach here for my next weenie."}
{"text":"As the Chicago area hot dog critic one thing I've noticed is that when traveling to other metropolitan areas hot dogs aren't nearly as popular other places as they are in Chicagoland. I did a search for hot dog stands near where I'm staying during my trip to the Phoenix Arizona area and found a place called \"Ted's Hot Dogs\" and the next closest place was immediately familiar. It was Portillo's, a very popular and abundant chain started in suburban Chicago that has apparently made its way to Arizona.

I finally had a chance to stop by and the first thing that I noticed is that it's every bit as busy as the Chicagoland locations. The parking lot was completely packed and there was very little available seating inside. There were also tables outside, but people had birds coming up to their tables,sometimes managing to get away with a french fry before fluttering off.  

Now, I've been to the Chicago area Portillo's many times and have reviewed a few locations. As a child I met Dick Portillo on a number of occasions and used to be a very big fan of Portillo's as a chain. Over the years, the quality control at Portillo's has diminished. The same quality ingredients are being used, but it seems like the training on how to properly assemble hot dogs, burgers, and everything else has suffered. Or management has simply stopped paying as vigorous attention to quality control. With a location over a thousand miles from Chicagoland I wondered if the menu would be different, if the way things were made would be different, and if being so far away the same degradation in food preparation that has infected the Chicagoland locations was present here.

Upon walking in and looking around it sure looked and felt like a Portillo's. I didn't thoroughly inspect the menu as my order was taken while in line by a lady who wrote it down on the back of a bag, it appeared to be the same as the Chicago locations. I placed my order, and then got into the pick-up line to wait for my food. One trend I've noticed at the Chicago locations is repeated rhymes based on your order number. So they would call out things like \"Number two, your order is due\", \"Number three come see me\". I noticed with certain numbers they were doing the rhyming as well (this must be something they train on), but it wasn't the constant irritation of hearing it at the Chicagoland locatons to the point where you're trapped in a Dr. Seuss book.

Finally my food was ready and I struggled to find an open seat without subjecting myself to eating outside where birds interrupting my meal was nearly a certainty. I finally sat down took my food out and snapped a picture. This was a regular Portillo's hot dog. The problem is we had the same inconsistent preparation we see at the Chicago area locations.

For any of those reading this review that are unfamiliar with what a Chicago style hot dog should be, I'll go over the basics. A Chicago style hot dog has a few different variations. The version served by Portillo's is the most traditional style which is an all-beef natural casing sausage. The natural casing is skin that when properly heated will give the frankfurter a nice bit of resistance and a snap when you bite into it. The classic Chicago style hot dog comes on a poppy seed bun which has been steamed to become soft and easy to bite into. It has a pickle spear or slice, tomato slice, sport peppers, bright green relish mustard, onion and celery salt on it. Ketchup is considered to be the worst possible addition to a Chicago-style hot dog as the sweetness overpowers the flavor of the other ingredients.

So how did the Portillo's of Tempe hot dog fare? The sausage itself was fine, but the relish application was a bit excessive. This added to the biggest problem,  the bun was steamed  too much along with being causing it to become a tad soggy. As a result the back half of the hot dog dissolved as I picked it up forcing me to struggle to finish the rest without getting my hands wet and sticky. The taste of the hot dog was roughly on par with other Portillo's, the big problem being a bit too thick of a pickle spear. 

I also got fries with cheese sauce. These fries were a litle over cooked, I'd say they were crispy but a few were so crisp there was no potato paste to be extracted from the inside. 

My overall impression is that this isn't any worse than the Chicago area Portillo's on any given day. But Portillo's food quality isn't what it used to be either. I did notice quite a few people at this Portillo's with Chicago themed shirts, Bears and Bulls jerseys. While I'm sure Chicago transplants and visitors only make up a small fraction of their clientele, it struck me as interesting. This is especially true since there doesn't seem to be a lot of other Chicago themed eateries around the area. Overall, I'm going to give my Portillo's experience here two stars. But for the Phoenix area readers your mileage may vary as its unique to the area."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today withUrsula D. Marvin A.Georgie M. and Rand H. Well I had the Italian beef sandwich (wet) and a jumbo dog Charred and a piece of chocolate cake. Everything I ate was very good. I would have given this place 5 stars if they managed the busy place a little better. They call your number over a P A system when your food is ready and it is very hard to hear to say the least.They need boards like the D.M.V. that say now serving 143 at window 5. If they had that you would at least be able to see when your order was ready.I take away one star for that ,but the food here is as good as it gets (5 stars) yummm."}
{"text":"Not bad but didn't live up to all the hype. Hot dog was good. Got my unusual toppings request perfect. Don't waste your $2 on the fries. They were of the crinkle cut variety fresh from the freezer and had that \"been frozen a while\" taste. The staff was genuinely nice though not real helpful. I told the cashier it was my first time and had no idea what to order and she said ok and offered no suggestions. Their very large menu includes hamburgers and chicken, not just hot dogs. 
I would have given them a 4 if either the fries had been a little something more OR if the cashier would have made a couple of recommendations. 
All in all - just another fast food joint I may or may not return to. Won't make a special trip there."}
{"text":"Came here because we've heard so much about it. I kind of had my expectations higher than I should have. The food was good. Not fantastic but pretty good. The staff seemed friendly and happy too. The wait time was minimal and we found a place to sit right away. It just seemed like your average fast food place. Maybe a little better."}
{"text":"The decor was awesome! The burger, hot dog and fries Mediocre at best. The steak and cheddar croissant was out of this world as well as the chocolate cake. I would go for those two items next time."}
{"text":"Good chopped salad and the Italian beef is always tasty. The service could not be friendlier and this is similar to the Original Chicago restaurants."}
{"text":"Although I am a midwesterner by birth, my first experience of Portillos was here in the Valley of the Sun. 

I've been super interested to try it, but wanted to wait until the initial craziness was past. 

We finally checked it out this past weekend and wow! So yummy. 

Parking was crowded, but we found a spot easily enough. There is a nice patio at the front with plenty of seating and tables overshadowed by umbrellas. The restaurant is kitschy, with memorabilia covering the walls and hanging from the ceiling - Flash Gordon poster, bicycle, airplane pedal car... 

The dining room is very clean and teeming with staff - we were greeted at arrival, handed paper menus, and ushered into one of two lines stretching up to the counter. We reviewed the menus and when we reached the front of the line, were directed to one of the windows to order. This whole process was a bit frenzied - we didn't really have an ample amount of time to decide on our orders before we hit the front of the line, and when we did, getting up to a window while not cutting off someone from the other line was somewhat stressful. One of our only snags during the dining experience came when we got to the counter and learned that the printed menus that we had been looking over to make our choices were NOT actually current menus. So we had to make some rapid re-selections on-the-fly. 

Your order is assigned a number and you have to listen for it to be announced, then go pick it up from the window. The girls announcing that the orders are ready have funny catch phrases for each number: \"Fifty Four, wait no more!\" etc, which is entertaining the first 5 times you hear them (but I'll come back to this) 

You pick up your orders on large trays with drink holders in each corner and reminderd me of the trays that used to clip to your car window at A&W Rootbeer stands (if anyone remembers those) They're handy for transporting your food to the table, but are very bulky and get in the way if your table is crowded, like ours was.

We ordered The Italian Beef with spicy peppers and mozzarella, a Grilled Chicken Sandwich, a Hamburger, and a few orders of crinkle french fries. 

The Grilled Chicken Sandwich was pretty okay - more \"meh\" than amazing. 

The Hamburger was good - flattened thinner, similar to other midwestern imports (Freddie's, for example) which meant that the flavor was more concentrated and it was crispier than your standard burger. The bread got very soggy and the toppings were in disarray, so it was a mess to eat. 

The crinkle fries were okay - we got three orders for the 3.5 of us and I'd probably tailor that down to 2 orders (or maybe even 1) the next time. They came out CRAZY hot, too hot to eat, so we had to wait a bit before digging in. They tasted alright and had good texture, but weren't anything to write home about.

The Italian Beef was, as others say, incredibly good. The beef was sliced very thinly and then piled on thick.  It was savory, juicy, and very flavorful. The bread was pretty thin and did get terribly soggy from the juices of the sandwich. I ordered it with spicy peppers and mozzarella; the mozzarella was barely there, but I was so glad that I ordered the peppers! The juice from the peppers permeated the whole sandwich, giving an extra dimension to the flavors - the peppers themselves were not overwhelmingly spicy, which was nice. There were some little crinkly pickled carrots in the mix as well, which was weird at first but tasted fine. Eating the sandwich is tricky: it comes in two wrappers, a larger outer wrapper that is more \"dry\" and a more tightly wrapped inner wrapper. I took my sandwich out of the outer wrapper but kept the inner wrapper on so that it would blockade the sogginess and keep the sandwich together. This was a good move; my friend who also got the Italian Beef did NOT do this, and it was a huge mess. 

The dining room is very hectic. The seating is bordered by the line of guests, the order counter, the pickup window, and the catering counter. The cacophony of the many guests plus the announcer calling out the orders is definitely less than relaxing.  Hearing \"54 wait no more\" 100 times while you dine is not so great. However, the decor, very friendly and attentive employees, cleanliness of the restaurant, and overall casual level of the place all make for a very fun experience that was ultimately quite enjoyable. 

Pricing was okay - just over $30 for three adults and one baby, so not too bad. 

The staff were phenomenal. My expectations are generally pretty low in a place that has really young employees, but you can tell that the training at Portillos is top-notch and that they ask a lot of their team. We were greeted, treated politely and professionally, attended to (they have employees bussing the tables, collecting trash as you finish) and thanked as we left. 

I can definitely recommend Portillos for a delicious and lovely casual lunch or dinner. Be sure to check it out!"}
{"text":"I was very happy when the first two Portilo's store locations opened up in Phoenix. I am a Chicagoland native who loves to share a great causal meal with friends at these restaurants.

The following will be borrowed from a previous location that I have reviewed. It will be several of my favorite foods from the menu. Enjoy! 

Roast Beef Sandwich. One of the best roast beefs in town. I would recommend getting it with mozzarella cheese, hot peppers, double dipped in gravy. It's a fantastic meal! For those with a serious appetite, try ordering the Big Beef. It's twice the sandwich for only a little more. 

Jumbo Hotdog with everything on it. A Jumbo all beef hotdog with onion, relish, tomato, hot peppers, mustard, and a speared pickle. This is the epitome of the Chicago Hotdog! A must try! I recommend ordering two.

Fresh Chopped Salad. Ditalini pasta, crumbled bacon, romaine and iceberg lettuce, red cabbage, tomatoes, onion, gorgonzola cheese, chopped chicken, with a great blend of spices.

Now a few things that I would stay clear of... The Cake Shake and the Malts. The Cake Shake take a piece of their famous chocolate cake and blends it with a chocolate shake. It is WAY too much chocolate for a desert. I would only order this if you have a serious sweet tooth. As for the Malts, they are seriously lacking with the malt power and you can get a better Malt elsewhere in town."}
{"text":"I have been here many times. The atmosphere inside is fun and very unique. The chili and broiled chicken sandwich are definitely my favorite items on the menu. I also really enjoy the onion rings. Be careful during \"normal\" dinner hours, this place gets packed fast."}
{"text":"Chicago Dog + Italian Beef (w/hot peppers) = amazing. I don't understand the negative reviews. This place is a chicago food lover's machine. Turning through an insane amount of hungry patrons per hour. 

ORDER NUMBER 94 OUT THE DOOR!"}
{"text":"I have been here about 3 times now and have not been disappointed on any occasion. I Love, Love, Love the Chilli Cheese dog and the salads are great as well. Honestly I was a bit weirded out the first time I had the chop Salad because it had pasta in it however it was super yummy.  the fries are always tasty and well salted. I love the inside of the place it is fun and funky."}
{"text":"Always awesome Chicago dogs , please open on the West side of the valley , there are so many horrible restaurants compared to the very good ones like This !"}
{"text":"We all enjoyed it...my nieces and me! I wish they had kids meals as the kids did not eat burgers that larger so then I finished them off."}
{"text":"My review is based on the food and take out experience. 

1st the food - had Italian beef, chili dogs, cheese fries and onion rings,  Food was good, portions a bit on the small side.  The large fries were not that large (ok maybe I am getting spoiled by Five Guys).  Thought the Italian beef could have used something else, I did get the peppers added, but they should also include grilled onions.

BUT, they FORGOT the gravy on the side  for the Italian beef.  And this after I ordered it, and even read back the order when we picked it up, and confirmed that they included with the order.  And when we got home, NO gravy (I think they got confused, as we ordered cheesy fries, and probably thought that was the gravy).  How can you have an Italian beef without the gravy.  Very disappointed that they forgot it.

Take out is easy, very friendly staff.  Next time, will double check the gravy."}
{"text":"I found this place by googling Italian Beef while I was in town for a visit.  Even though I was only here a week, I came here 2 times to indulge in this delicious sandwich!  Since I got it to go, I got the dip sauce on the side.  I can't wait to visit town again cuz this time I'll eat in and get it fully dipped right there.  The onion rings and fries are delicious.  The crew, in both visits, were extremely friendly and efficient!   Very happy with my experience here!"}
{"text":"Wanted to grab a sandwich late night. Hours posted say open till 10:00 pm. Got there at 9:46pm and the drive thru was blocked. Walked inside and there's an older gentlemen at the register, I ask if I can order and he just shakes his head and says \"naa were closed\". Thanks for nothing."}
{"text":"I am a hot dog snob... do not eat them, but my husband was craving one, so I gave in~!! The Maxwell and Italian Sausage are Delicious... will be back for the Ribs and Hamburgers~!!"}
{"text":"If they can manage to not screw up your order it's decent food. Last time they gave me a single burger instead of a double and the girl was unprofessional about it and also took the burger back into the kitchen ( pretty sure you can't do that) and this time they had someone who hardly spoke English yelling orders into the kitchen so I'm sure you can guess that something was messed up again."}
{"text":"Stopped in last night on the way home.  I have eaten most of their menu items except the tamales.  I am not sure about a hot dog place that serves tamales. LOL I noticed they had pasta and decided to try it.  It was pretty good and the small piece of bread was the perfect size too.  I even tried there strawberry shortcake too.  It was pretty good.  Maybe a tad to sweet for me.  I like this place and recommend it to anyone.  I do like there beef and Italian sausage sandwiches, but the doctor said no mas for a while."}
{"text":"I have been away for a while.  I am pretty much back now and have the time to continue my reviews.  I have always loved Italian beef.  I am glad to see Portillo's plant a flag here.  The food has always been good and the service has been good to.  I tend to get a Italian Beef or the Italian Sausage too.  I think this trip was the Italian sausage plain.  Great place to eat and it is close to the new Cubs spring training facility too."}
{"text":"Stop here for lunch because I was inn the area. I had the double burger. It was to much food, which is a good problem I guess. 

As we waited in line a last came buy and explained the entire menu to us. She was very helpful. The food was good and even though the line was long the food came out fast. 

There were a lot of Chicago Cub fans there because of spring training. So it definitely had a ball park atmosphere. Overall it was a positive experience."}
{"text":"Food is good here and the employees pleasant.  But they can't get an order right which is the reason for the 3 star review.  I have given it several tries and have now given up on this place.  Weird thing is they confirm the order multiple times but still when you get it home it is not what you ordered. Very irritating."}
{"text":"Great food taste like home cause I'm from Illinois like this company always fast service and great people working and there drive thru can be kinda slow but when there busy you have to wait for great food"}
{"text":"Whoever runs this place is incredibly good at his or her job.  I've never seen anything like it.  You walk in and there's A TON of people.  You give your order within 2 minutes, pay, and your food is ready 5 minutes later.  And it's delicious.  The only minor issue is it's pretty tough to find a place to sit."}
{"text":"CHOCOLATE CAKE SHAKE - Wowza! 

I really dig this place. I am amazed every time that I go in this restaurant, it runs like a well oiled machine. The employee's at the registers are very knowledgeable about the menu, the staff when you go to pick up your food all seemed like they really enjoyed and wanted to be at work. It's just an over all happy environment (even when they are extremely busy.) 

Recommendations: 

First off - you must, and I mean MUST get the Chocolate Cake Shake! If you can't tell I am a BiG fan!

- Chopped Salad is delightful, consists of chopped lettuce and small pasta noodles with chicken, bacon, cabbage, tomatoes and house dressing. (It also comes with onion and gorgonzola cheese which I had taken off.) The salad also comes with one of their (spectacular) warm lemon poppy seed muffins.  

- Grilled Tuna Sandwich, tuna w/lettuce, tomato and tartar sauce. (You must love tuna to enjoy this sandwich.) 

-Big Beef, be prepared as this is a very large sandwich. It's Italian beef on french bread. The beef is well flavored and if you add cheddar cheese or mozzarella to the sandwich it is out of this world. 

- Onion rings: They are not to thick or thin and they are not over-battered like most onion rings are. They are light, crispy and awesome!

I have yet to try the hot dogs, I plan to on my next Portillo's adventure. Hope you stop in and enjoy this place as much as I do. 

--One last time.....get the cake shake!--"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great atmosphere and yummy hot dogs. My dad loved the old fashioned feel."}
{"text":"I hate to admit it, but this place is bomb-hot-dog-diggity!  I was tempted to wimp out and get a salad, but boy am I glad I didn't... the Italian beef sammie and hot dog do not disappoint."}
{"text":"The BIG BEEF is life!!!!!!!!!!! Their bread is heavenly. The meat is juicy and the peppers are Katy Perry Hot! All for under $8.  I eat here all the time and consistency is their game. Its the best damn sandwich in the valley. I love this place and will fight anyone that says otherwise. BIG BEEF for president!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The food here is by far the closest you will get to eating in Chicago!  Their salads are phenomenal as well as the hot dogs (of course).  The only problem seems to be getting the orders right...  Third time using the drive threw, and the third time the order was not correct after waiting over 20 minutes for the food.
All in all, it's a great place to eat, but checking your order for accuracy is certainly a must when visiting this particular location.  Maybe a little review with the friendly staff and management may help fix this little issue."}
{"text":"Note: They know how to make a Chocolate Malt. You would be amazed to find how rare that is around here 

But the awesomeness does not stop there. Great dogs, burgers, fries and chocolate cake. Service is friendly and EXTREMELY fast. I can get lunch on and still have time to run an errand."}
{"text":"Note: They know how to make a Chocolate Malt. You would be amazed to find how rare that is around here

I came to this location first after taking my wife to Mayo down the street. We where looking for something to lift our spirits and this place did!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday night before closing to get a salad and waited nearly 15 minutes. If I hadn't said anything, they would have closed the restaurant and probably wouldn't have even asked if I was waiting for something. Granted, it was near closing time but it didn't make me feel any better that there were 10+ people behind the counter looking at their phones and shuffling around until quitting time. After I complained, all the manager could say is that he couldn't provide an explanation as to why my order was not acknowledged until I said something. Really? Maybe because you're not managing your people. He did offer me a piece of cake on the house to which I declined, but I'm sorry to say they lost me as a customer."}
{"text":"Had the Italian beef and cheese fries and was excellent. Actually didn't see anyone eating a hot dog. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Super yummy and reasonably priced. My husband got a chili cheese dog and some fries - the fries are small, but really cheap, so we can't complain! I got a Maxwell St Polish and side salad. The polish was really good, and the salad was generously sized. Their pickles are AMAZING. I'm a pickle lover, and these were the best dill pickles I've ever had. They'll give you extra if you ask! We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"So I was a little bored one evening and decided to finally try this place months after the hype of grand opening. I figured by now the hour long lines will be long gone and everybody in Maricopa County had tried it at least once by now. So I get to the northeast corner of McClintock and E Rio Salado Parkway and enter a real clusterfork of a parking lot. Since the drive through lane is pretty big and surrounds Portillo's you have to park off to the east where there are signs telling you that you can only go in one direction. There is more parking beyond what you initially see when you first enter the area though. Pretty much all the parking right in front near the entrance are handicapped parking stalls. Fortunately, Portillo's was a late afterthought/addition to this mall so it has its own corner and is pretty much completely separate from the rest of the mall. An island of Chicago in a Tempe mall. If I remember correctly it's more or less the same corner that Nita's Hideaway used to be on many eons ago. So you come in and see multiple areas - one for phone order pickup, and all the way in back a place that you place your order. You then walk halfway across the restaurant after ordering and listen for your number. Everything comes in a thick brown plastic tray with four drink holders. So I ordered a standard fountain drink as well as a Maxwell Street Polish dog, a bowl of chili, and a tamale. Hadn't eaten all day more or less so I was hungry. Luckily it was not very crowded and I found some seating right away. I would hate to have to eat a hotdog in a hallway. So anyway, the hot dog was delicious - especially with the grilled onions sprinkled on top and with a bit of mustard as well. But no ketchup. Which is good because as Dirty Harry once said \"Nobody, I mean NOBODY puts ketchup on a hot dog!\" So that was the best part of the meal. Then I had the chili. Came with cheese and onions. It was alright. I like the chili at Lobby's better though. Truth. Finally - the tamale. It was wrapped in foil and then again in several layers of the kind of paper you wrap food to go in. It was one long greasy gut bomb. Pretty much plain masa and what tasted like the sauce in the chili inside it. Perhaps it's that toddling town's version of a tamale and if I was an ex-pat homesick for the Windy City I might have enjoyed it much more as the nostalgia kicked in. But since I'm NOT from Chitown and have only been once in my life for a couple of days when I was grade school age I was just curious as to what their tamales tasted like. Fortunately curiosity didn't kill the cat but instead gave him about 3 or 4 swift kicks to the stomach and a stern warning. NEVER EAT THOSE AGAIN. All night I felt my stomach churn and I'm sure the tamale was the the cause of it. If you ate 5 or 6 of those you'd be a walking tear gas/pepper spray cannister. So after I was more or less satisfied I walked back out into the night and noticed that the closest store in the rest of the mall to Portillo's just happens to be Lane Bryant. I guess if you become a REALLY big fan of Portillo's that is rather conveniently located. I'm sure I'll be back again one day."}
{"text":"For 30 years, every time I went to Chicago I stopped at Portillo's at least once if not twice, and now I don't have to anymore because they're finally in Tempe!!!

What you want is the Italian Beef, with sweet and hot peppers, and dipped.  Order it like you're from Chicago (which I am):   Beef, sweet, hot, and wet

Don't forget to get a Chicago style tamale"}
{"text":"It's bigger than it looks which is good because apparently every transplanted Chicago resident in the Valley has made this their lunch spot now.

The food was good and served very quickly, but not having been there before its a bit disconcerting to have them ask for your order before you even reach the point where you can read the signs. 

Of course, not being from Chicago, I had never heard of Portillo's before this opened and while it was good, it's basically a hot dog and Italian beef sandwich shop. Are they good hot dogs? Sure. Are they worth a long wait in line? If you're not from Chicago, probably not. Will I go back? Probably, but I wouldn't make a special trip."}
{"text":"What can you say about a \"hot dog joint\". Always great service, great food including amazing salads! Consistent what  more can you ask for?  The drive thru has it down to a science   Quick, friendly and the orders are always right.  Great job!"}
{"text":"I was a bit sad since I used to frequent the Uncle Sam's that was here, but all my regrets are definitely gone. Portillo's is a sick joint and I hope it's here to stay.

Taking down the restaurant decor for a very open counter service restaurant. Akin to something like Five Guys, you can view the entire line of cooks from grill to tray service along half the perimeter. They even have a separate counter for serving desserts. 

The title suggests hot dogs is the main attraction, but from what everyone's been ordering and what the staff tells me, the Italian beef attracts the most customers. The gravy is excellent, and the beef while succelent embodied all the classic flavors every Italian beef fan loves. The bread does the sandwich justice, but it's good but not great. I personally like the combo, which comes with an entire sausage in addition to the beef.

The sides are not something to shirk at either. The onion rings are super crispy and the crinkle fries work well with dat cheese whiz. 

To top everything off, this entire restaurant even has a drive thru, which totally works!

The menu is huge, so I'm far from exhausting my limit here. I hear the salads are pretty good, and I've got to try the namesake dish eventually. However, it's really hard to stay away from the Italian beef every time I come back."}
{"text":"Awesome Italian Beef with hot and spicy peppers-wet. A taste of of my hometown Chicago food in Scottsdale. Excellent."}
{"text":"Today I tried Portillos for the first time in Tempe, Arizona and I have exactly three thoughts on this place. One, if I had a dollar for the number of Portillos locations, I would have just enough money for a full tank of gas. Portillos is practically non-existent in the West coast and its kind of a shame. Me coming here was a combination of luck, timing, and persistence. By comparison, my favorite place to eat of all time, In-N-Out, has three times the number of locations. And to the burger gods - I thank you so very much. Two, Portillos looks and feels like a causal restaurant, but operates like a fast-food place. The dinning room is large and spacious. The interior decor is totally immersive, retro, and entertaining. And there are tons of workers there. But unlike a casual restaurant, you have to stand in line to order your food and pick it up. And amazingly the food is not that expensive at all and the service is fast. Third and finally, I tried their italian beef and sausage combo and that was one of the meatiest and juiciest sandwich I had in awhile. If you are looking for protein, tons of flavor, and lots of chew thats your sandwich. So check out Portillos. Don't be bored, explore!"}
{"text":"Frustration. Head-shaking. Sadness. Annoyance. 

I am talking about what you'll see on the faces of Portillo's employees. What you'll never see is a smile. The food is very good, but apparently the people who work here are miserable. Wake up, management and find out why your people hate working here. Bad attitudes are contagious."}
{"text":"I was heading home from big surf the other day and I thought why not try Portillos Hot Dogs? Very cute on the outside and convenient being so close to my house. I'm not from Arizona but I thought why not try it? Once I got inside I was in for a surprise. I stood in line for about 25 minutes before my order was taken to come to a realization on why it took so long: the two kids running the register would not stop flirting! By the time I got my food the onion rings were cold and bland. I could have got a better, juicier burger elsewhere and my bun wouldn't have gotten soggy. 2/5 stars because my kids loved the cheese fries."}
{"text":"I never went to Portillo's when I visited Chicago, but I had to jump on the band wagon when I saw practically all of Phoenix metro teem with anticipation for its grand opening on 90th and Shea. The line was out the door when we arrived last Sunday afternoon, but it moved quite swiftly, which gave me just enough time to study the menu. My friend and I shared the CHAR-GRILLED MAXWELL STREET STYLE POLISH, ITALIAN BEEF, CHOPPED SALAD, and CHEESE FRIES. The polish was good - it had all the \"Chicagoan fixings,\" and it popped (with an audible sound) when I bit into it, which is a huge plus in my book. Probably my favorite item from the meal. I found the Italian beef a little dry. I'm no connoisseur, but I personally like Luke's Italian beef better. It has more flavor, more kick, and probably more calories too. Maybe I should have gotten it with \"extra gravy\"? That could have been an error on my part, so I won't hold it against the restaurant. Cheese fries were delicious, but I'm very easy to please when it comes to fried potatoes, especially when it's crinkled and served with Cheez Whiz. Finally, the salad was a little \"wet\" for my liking, but very flavorful nonetheless. Not sure if it's worth the price (seemed a little high against the rest of the fare) but  a little green after all that felt right and warranted. When the buzz dies down a bit, I think this would be the perfect place for \"Ã¡ la carte\" snacking, or grabbing a quick lunch salad. Great for light-hearted family outings, too, I suppose. My friends have raved about their ribs, so I'm hoping they will be available on the Arizona menu one day. Withholding the fifth star for the \"could be improved\" soda refill system - I personally don't care, but I saw many people waiting a long time to get one."}
{"text":"Went for dinner tonight with the wife and kids. This place just opened three or four days ago and was absolutely packed! It also didn't help that it was about an hour before ASU - Wisconsin kicked of at Sun Devil Stadium about a mile down the road in Tempe. 

Service was amazing. But with the approximately 70 employees I saw, anything less would have been unacceptable. Shit, I counted about 15 management and corporate types alone all gathered around patting themselves on the back. 

Unfortunately, the service is where the amazing ended. Food was...average. One of our daughters wanted chicken tenders, and they were among the worst I'd ever had. Onion rings sucked too. My wife and I each had a jumbo and they were ok - but certainly nothing even remotely close to special. If you're looking for better, it shouldn't be too hard to find. Ted's in Tempe has far better dogs and onion rings. And if it's Chicago dogs you're looking for, Jimmy's at 40th and B-way is vastly superior."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. Been there 6 times in the last 10 days. Had everything on menu from a chili cheese dog to chocolate  cake shake(just amazing) you can not go wrong here no matter what you order. If you are like me and from back east where the good food lives you will get a smile with every bite thinking you are back home til you realize it's 120 outside and reality sets in but good thing is you'll be full... Lol"}
{"text":"Reminds me of Chicago. Love the authentic Chicago style hot dog. The Beef sandwich reminds me of Mr. Beef. If I'm homesick for the read deal Chicago hot dog, this is the place."}
{"text":"If your closed for Thanksgiving would you mind having an answering machine or service letting customers know?  We called all locations today and nothing!"}
{"text":"Wow, what to say! I have been all around this country but nothing beats a Portillo's Hot Dog! A regular with everything, a chili cheese dog, and cheese fries...very healthy indeed! :) This place is always packed because it's amazing.  If you truly like hot dogs, it's worth the chaos and wait.  They are very expedient in their service.  Oh, did I mention they have amazing shakes too?! Plan on gaining some lbs by coming here but it's so worth it."}
{"text":"I'm so biased being from Chicago and snarfing on Portillo's since I was a lil chubber as a kid.  I still get same thing I've always gotten.  Hot dog with everything (love jalenpenos on my dog!) and chili cheese dog...I'm salivating just typing right now.

I've been to the one on Shea/90th and this one wasn't as packed but maybe the word hasn't spread yet.  Service was fast, courteous and prompt, (I did Drive Thru).  

If you are by Tempe Market Place it's right off McClintock and Rio Saldado.  Give it a shot, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"If you truly love the taste of Chicago this should NOT be your first choice.  The problem is that there are so many new people to Phoenix (by Phx I mean the entire metropolis...Phx, Scottsdale, Mesa, Glendale...get the pic?) that they're just completely ignorant about choice.  Here's the deal...if it's Monday thru Saturday, DON'T GO TO PORTILLO'S!  Why?  Because there's BETTER!  It's called, Chicago Hamburger Company!  They're on 38th St. and Indian School, but most people who aren't from here or haven't been here long are oblivious to the existence of this far better Chicago choice.  Now, if it's Sunday, Chicago Hamburger Company unfortunately isn't open, but Portillos is.  So if you need a Chitown 'fix' on Sunday, Portillos will do.
What I find annoying as hell about this place is that it employs a bunch of numb brain millennials who don't seem to care about quality of deliverable product or procedures.  
So here's my point....ONLY go to Portillos on a Sunday...any other day Chicago Hamburger Company is open, which is FAR better!"}
{"text":"I love Portillo's! I had it at the downtown location in Chicago on a recent trip then went to this location a week after the grand opening and the Chili Dogs tasted just as good."}
{"text":"Food: I thought it was definitely worth the trip across town. Just imagine a Costco dog with all the fixings, including a slice of pickle and some yellow peppers. Simple and delicious. I also tried their dipped beef sandwich, which is actually my preference. Just know that the dipped beef is a little messy to eat and the bread gets real mushy...mmmmm. Can't beat the portions either.

Value: I thought the price was very reasonable for what you get. 

Service: Outstanding.

All in all, if you've never been to a Portillo's, I highly recommend. It's like Chi-town's In-N-Out. Even if you end up not liking it, I think you'll appreciate the experience."}
{"text":"We're from Chicago and have lived in the valley for over 41 years. During that time we've tried many places to get a good Chicago Italian Beef sandwich. None of them had the right texture, seasoning, moisture to be called a Chicago style sandwich. Today we visited Portillo's and are so happy we did.  We had their Italian Beef sandwich and it was like being back in Chicago. We LOVED it. My husband liked it so much he ordered the Big Beef sandwich to go and had it later this evening at home.  One of their salads made my mouth water so next time I'm going to try that. It's an apple walnut chicken salad. The place is large, airy, a little on the noisy side, quick service, plenty of space and an outside patio. We will be back and I'm sure it'll be multiple times."}
{"text":"Beef sandwiches, hot dogs and fries are very good.  Burgers and salads are fair, not bad, but very average.  My only knock on the place is that service is fair to poor with exception of the greeters at the start of the line and the kids who run around and clean up the tables (they are good)."}
{"text":"I love this place, I eat here twice a month I order the big beef sandwich every time sometimes dipped or gravy on the side. My mate brought me here when it first opened and I can't stop eating here!!!"}
{"text":"I went to Portillo's on a quick stop to Tempe. The ambiance and interior design of the restaurant was very unique and enjoyable. They have a massive kitchen with tons of employees working and you can watch them cook. It was pretty fascinating. I had the beef and cheddar crouisant. It was pretty good. Portions are a bit small, but at least the prices aren't too high. It seems like a fun family restaurant. Overall, good food."}
{"text":"Pretty sure I just had my last visit to Potillo's
Order food to eat in . Couldn't find a clean table. Plenty of tables available, but they were all disgusting with left over food and spills from the previous  guests. We had to clean our own table. The height chairs were Even more disgusting. The floor was so sticky just about everywhere.  The condiment station was a mess and all the dispensers were empty. There were plenty of workers taking orders and cooking food and NOT One employee cleaning up the place. It looked like it hadn't been cleaned in weeks. 
I'm sure the place would be shut down if the health inspector visited today 12/31/17
So done with this place!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is nothing like the originals in chicago! The food sucks so greasy and bad. The Italian beef has a lot of trans fat! Come on America we can't be eating these things! Food is just terrible! I don't get how people like this stuff. Waste of money. Go to whole foods! Healthy and amazing!"}
{"text":"I'm in love!

Finally a real piece of where I grew-up, Cook County, Illinois.

Portillo's is the  quintessential hot dog restaurant, Chicago Style if you like. A huge menu and a large facility in retro 50's-60's style with a Chicago theme.

Hours as of opening day are: Mon-Thurs 10:00am -10:30pm, Fri-Sat 10:00am-11pm. Sunday 10:30am -10pm. Closed: Easter, Thanksgiving, Christmas. See store photos for the image these hours came from.

For dine-in or carry-out the process is the same. Get in line, order (probably should research online ahead of time so you know what you want before you get to the register, because the lines may be long). Then slide down to your left and wait for the number from your receipt to be called to pick up your order. While waiting stock-up on condiments and napkins or save a table inside or out.

There's several restaurants in one at this place, one for salads, one for sandwiches, and another for desserts. One order gets all three.

Their Italian beef in a roll is legendary, the preferred style is 'dipped' with hot peppers added (no, they're not too hot) There are two choices of sizes. I cannot do the larger one.

I tried ordering beef for carry out or dine-in to compare how the roll stood up compared to the 15 minute drive home and re-nuking vs eating there. The difference was minor, so it is okay to eat a beef at home. Same with their dogs.

Oddly enough for a guy who grew up in the suburbs of Chicago this is the first Portillo's I actually went inside. I've always been to the drive thru's before. The inside is designed to handle a large crowd and long lines.

This may turn out to be the anchor store in the mall where this place is located. 

Traffic is a bit of a problem. Getting in is easy, getting out is not easy. I think most people try to exit the mall by driving south past the stores to near the Fry's then head east towards 90th St, then turn left onto 90th St and back to Shea if you live west of Portillo's. Be careful, the intersections of Shea at 90th and 92nd are among the highest crash rate locations in the phoenix metro area.

It may be safest to exit onto Shea heading east then make a left after several blocks and turn around back west when it's safe. Better to go the wrong way for a while than to risk fast turns in heavy traffic near the restaurant. Please be patient and allow lots of extra time for the drive back home.

The volume of business and the traffic around Portillo's now is probably not suited to those rude people from New York City.

The location for the marker on the map on Yelp is the wrong spot. If approaching from the west on Shea or from the Loop 101, exit to Shea Blvd heading east, stay in the far right lane and take the first driveway east of the highway to exit to the right heading south. This new restaurant does not show up on google maps or street-view. Yet.

I am speculating that Dick Portillo must be buying a place to winter here in Scottsdale which will keep this location on it's toes!

Update: During week #2, still has lines out the front door. There is a reason why."}
{"text":"Of course I love Portillo's and their menu and thank Dick Portillo endlessly for making the phoenix metro area an official suburb of Chicago.  That said I did some experimenting with making Chicago dogs at home and wanted to offer the results of my yummy research.
I ordered a hot dog kit from Vienna Beef online which comes with buns, dogs, and toppings.
These are the ingredients you need to nearly duplicate at home what you can get at Portillo's:
Vienna Beef Natural Casing Weiners (not the skinless ones or the ones in the grocery store), Vienna Beef hot dog buns, and their sport peppers in the jar. Everything else you can get at the grocery store and your dogs will taste pretty darn close to Portillo's at home.
Any yellow mustard is fine, any celery salt, any onion chunks, any tomato slice, almost any non sweet relish is fine - a yellow relish may even be better. And for a pickle slice, you really should use Clausen Kosher dill pickles, the ones that are refrigerated at the store - always rotate the jar and look for brown spots caused by lack of refrigeration when shipped to the store.
I got a cheap steamer for dogs and buns on Amazon but you can make one with alumunim foil or a food strainer over a pot of simmering water. Steam the buns for maybe 2 minutes and the dogs until they're hot.
Since catsup is 99% tomato I think the anti-catsup thing is total hype as long as you dont grab one of the sweeter catsups. Heinz sells one at many stores marked Reduced Sugar which lowers the carbs and doesn't taste like catsup flavored candy.
There are some Vienna Beef hot dog places here in the phoenix metro where you can order bulk items directly from Vienna Beef in Chicago instead of ordering from them and waiting on the fedex truck.

The two most important ingredients are: vienna beef natural casing weiners and vienna beef hot dog buns. ( the poppy seeds add no flavor or texture and are only for appearance)

Happy eating - God Bless Portillo's!"}
{"text":"I lived in Chicago until I came to Arizona for college, lived here since 1979.  Worked at hot dog restaurant  in high school.  At first I was delighted to be able to go to Portillos but I'm tired of over cooked hot dogs, wet buns, small portions of Italian beef and mistakes on my order.  It's still ok, but they screw up often and don't pay attention to details.  Check your order twice before you leave."}
{"text":"The ONLY place to go for a Chicago hot dog and beef sandwich. There are a ton of place who claim to be \"Chicago food\", but this is the real deal. Although the AZ staff doesn't quite stand up to the real Portillo's back home, they do pretty well. They did screw up the Maxwell Polish, suppose to be sauteed onion & Mustard on a hard roll, but they use a hotdog bun and burned both the onion and polish. They've screwed up a couple of orders (when it wasn't busy) and also have people in the drive through when it was dead. Back home they only do that when it's busy, which works great. When I'm the only one in the drive through, just let me order at the menu, I don't need 3 different people serving me. 

Inside, the area where you collect your food is too small, they need to clear out a couple of tables, people are standing on top of each other when it's busy. Oh and when you're in the drive through they wont let you have two separate orders when you have someone with you paying for themselves. Never heard of that in my life."}
{"text":"Every time I come here my food is cold. I went last night and got a burger, fries, and a shake and AS USUAL my burger was so cold and gross the cheese wasn't even melted. The fries are pretty good which is why I come back but I think they forgot there are other options out there! Not sure if I'll be back."}
{"text":"I've only been here once so far, but I really liked the dog I got... I don't remember which one it was, but it was good!"}
{"text":"It was okay. The environment was awesome but the food well... Meh. It is definitely a hot dog place because their chili dog was on point. Good place to bring your family to."}
{"text":"So I had never heard of this place before a couple of colleagues talked highly about it so we had lunch there that day. Now the food was actually really good, I had a burger wrapped in lettuce, messy (as expected) but good! the problem was that the next day, of the 6 of us that went to lunch, 4 of us got food poisoning. now I assume this isn't too common otherwise there'd be pretty big problems. I didn't give a terrible star rating because the food really was pretty delicious... good luck"}
{"text":"Interesting service method, the waiter comes by and takes your order while you're in line.  I had the regular chili dog, the food is not bad, I wouldn't call it amazing, the chili is not very flavorful and the hot dog is nothing special. Still, not bad."}
{"text":"Anxiously awaited the big opening and finally went. Not impressed.
While sitting and picking through the food that we got, we overheard a female manager picking apart and employee! Right on the dining room floor at a few tables away from us. She wrote him up, suspended him and we overheard her disappointment in him. 
Poor form lady. Wouldn't an office or even the outside patio be more appropriate? 
It was embarrassing for the employee, her and the restaurant."}
{"text":"3 stars at best, very average boiled hot dog on a sesame seed bun.  Fries were average, nothing special or out of the ordinary.  I think the ratings on here are all from Chicago fans who like the place just because it's full of Chicago people and history.  The food is \"OK\"."}
{"text":"Gross and flavorless. I've had good Italian beef sandwiches before in Chicago and New York. This greasy mess isn't anything I would come back for."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant several times and thought it was ok. My mother is in town for the holidays and thought we would bring her with other friend's.  The food was ok and the usual the problem was it was freezing in the restaurant FYI it's a cold 50 degrees in Az. And we didn't take off out jackets, to top it off my mother went to the rest room and quite said it was disgusting paper all over the floor and then some that's my last trip to potillos..."}
{"text":"My second visit,  first for my wife. She had the burger and fries which I recommended from my previous visit.  She said the burger was great.   She doesn't eat a lot so took most of the fries and strawberry shortcake home.   Finished the shortcake later and said it was good too. 

Trying to behave on my diet,  I had the grilled salmon Caesar salad.   Asked them to go light on the dressing,  perfect.   Very crisp, fresh lettuce.   Salmon was pretty good,  I was more impressed with the quantity than the quality.   Is a big step above a McDonald's or Wendy's salad.   Wish there was one closer to me."}
{"text":"A Chicago classic and always busy lines.  Lots of interesting decor and the best in Italian beef (best is double dipped) with hot and sweet giardinara.  Great hot dogs like the ones in QT- poppy seed bun, weiner, mustard and ketchup, sport peppers, quartered pickle, onions, tomato slices, and celery salt. Great salads, fries and shakes too."}
{"text":"Portillo's is relatively new to the Valley and was slammed for the first two weeks it was open, making getting in a challenge, but well worth it.  These have to be the best hot dogs I have ever eaten in my life!  And the Italian beef sandwiches are amazing.  I had never had one before Portillo's and I wanted to see if they were as good as the pictures.  I was not disappointed in the least.  Add the sweet peppers folks, for a real treat.  The chicken sandwiches are excellent, but a chicken sandwich you can get anywhere.  Stay with the Italian beef and the great hot dogs and you cannot go wrong.  Then after, take a look at dessert.  Not an array of choices, but what they have cannot be beat:  strawberry shortcake or luscious chocolate layer cake.  It's hard to walk out without getting that strawberry shortcake!  Listen for you number and be entertained by the playful way they announce it.  \"Number 8, no more wait!\"  or \"Number 11, come get your piece of heaven!\""}
{"text":"You cannot come here and leave unsatisfied. I usually get the Italian Beef sandwich with sweet peppers and mozzarella cheese dipped in gravy , fries and a Coke. If you want a great treat afterwards try the chocolate cake."}
{"text":"OK, so after 2 tries, I'm giving this a 2 star review, which is a bit negative. Place is colorful as all get-out, and fun, loud, and kind of exciting first time you visit. After the 2nd time though, I think it's a tad overpriced for all the fanfare. And, yet we have another fast food joint, made to be a restaurant, where you have to pick up your own food. 

Note to all restauarnt owners... If I want to pay high prices for food, bring it to me! I don't want to stand in line, I don't want to wait for my name to be called, just bring the damn thing to my table. Hell... Even Carl's Jr. brings your order to where I am sitting.
I'm not lazy. It's just stupid to pay restaurant prices for fast food, in a sense. It's not that often I crave a chili dog. But I can grab a can of Hormel's chili for a buck, and package of hot dogs for 2 bucks, and with cheese and inions, I can feed myself and 4 friends for about a buck each. What's the difference between my deal and this place? About Ten Frickin' Dollars I tell ya'. I can get a better hot dog at Costco, thank you very much. Won't be returning.

And all you people from Chicago... Always talking about your town... Selling out the Diamondback games when your beloved Cubs are in town... Welcome Chicago to the Desert, etc. etc. Why did ya'all leave, and why are you here, if it's such a gosh-darn great town?????????"}
{"text":"Great Chicago hot dog, burger and hot beef sandwich place. The food is really good and reminds me of home. It has a ton of seating, but during lunch and dinner it's busy. Although I don't think of them as a burger joint, I had one today and it was awesome. It's actually a fire grilled burger and tastes like a burger should taste. 

Thir dogs are great with soft steamed buns. If you are in the area it's worth stopping in."}
{"text":"I wish I could own a franchise of Portillos! Seriously. My Dad went to the original location growing up, and it's my boyfriend's favorite restaurant (he is also from Chicago). Their food is perfect, the customer service is second to none, and their training is what makes it all happen. I love you so much, Portillos!"}
{"text":"Ahh yes, a second location closer to home. I wish I could give it 6 stars. This place is bomb! One tip for everyone to use, is when you pick up your bag, look at the number on it as on only one occasion was I given the wrong bag. This locations seems a bit larger and seating hasn't ever been a problem for me. The food is the same and it is awesome. It is very consistent and exactly the same that you would get at any of their Chicagoland restaurants. 

I highly recommend this place! Also, they have separate food prep lines so the line goes fast. One line for the drive-thru and one for dine in. Very smart set up."}
{"text":"Went here and got a hot dog and cheeseburger. Also fries and a sprite. Bun was very moist for the hotdog, so you must like it that way. Unlike some reviews on here refills are free, it just seems they are not advertised. All you have to do is go up to the counter where you got your food, take off your lid and straw and request a refill and its done!

Downfall: it always seems to be busy and is hard to find a table. Get there when they open to avoid chaos! I'm also a Chicago native and can atest to the food being no different compared to the locations back home.

Enjoy! I highly recommend their cheeseburgers!"}
{"text":"I'm sitting at one in Arlington Heights, Il now enjoying a chopped salad and I was wondering if the AZ location had opened. As the other reviews point out, you won't be disappointed. The other people with me had a beef sandwich and a double burger. I should be out there later in the year and I'll go there. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Ate at one in Chicago a few weeks ago and was glad to see there are two in the Phoenix area. The standard Chicago dog with everything tasted just as good. Tried the Italian beef and was juicy and tasty. A welcome addition to the area!"}
{"text":"I mean who wouldn't want hot dogs smothered in cheese and chili.  I was really hoping for a chili cheese dog that was over filled with the above.  I feel like I could have had more food from a stadium hot dog.  The food was warm and I appreciate their cheese fries were not drowning in cheese but on the side (helps not be soggy.)  For the price we paid, I was hoping for a bit more food but otherwise the taste was great!"}
{"text":"Went through the drive through with my family. We wanted to grab some quick desert as we went to another restaurant for dinner across the street. My brother works here so we have been here many times. I got the cake shake which was good but not fantastic. Service was good too."}
{"text":"This sit down restaurant has a drive through. You go in wait in line order what you want and then you go to pick it up, sit and then you enjoy!  

The atmosphere of the restaurant like country, diner kind of place, an American restaurant.  Now I would not come here if I was a vegetarian or vegan. There no options for anyone Who is gluten free.  But if you don't care what goes into you body then pig out.  However there are meatless sandwiches, but there only 4 items.

It's wound't put a hole in your wallet and will pay under $20"}
{"text":"Excellent \"fast food \".  I have had their Chicago style hot dog, haddock sandwich, salad and hamburger. All were very good!  A friend was recently visiting  from NY. Because he frequently worked in Chicago we took him to Portillo's for the spiced beef sandwich (his personal favorite). He said it tastes exactly as he remembers it from 15 years ago. Service was friendly and restaurant was clean. A very good place to go for a quick meal with family and friends!"}
{"text":"We've been twice and have NO reason to return.  Have had a variety of items in menu, none of which are worth ordering again.  I have no idea what the allure is."}
{"text":"In A Nutshell:

-I thought Portillo's Hot Dogs is just an average place to grab some comfort food.
-When you walk inside everything from the seating arrangement to the decor and menu looks inviting, but...
-The food was a total letdown.
-The most famous item, which is their Chicago-style hot dog is a skinny weiner topped w/ the traditional Chicago toppings, but you're gonna need to go visit the Windy City for the real deal.
-The onion rings were good, but you barely get much.
-The beer selection (only 3) was lacking.

Overall, I heard that the line goes out the door every year during Spring Training, but I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"Not sure what all the low ratings are about.  If you are not from Chicago you won't understand.  Tasted great just like their Chicago locations.  Very consistent product and service.  I was visiting family in Peoria Az and they had a taste for Portillo's so we took the 1 hire ride.  Prices are fair, ultimate comfort food.   I ordered a beef sandwich and a charbroiled burger.  Don't forget to try the chocolate fudge cake."}
{"text":"Fun environment, good food, fast service, though not a strong effort to be friendly.
We ordered the Portillo dogs, beef & cheddar croissant, and French fries.
The dogs were delicious, though small. I would order again!
The Beef & cheddar left something to be desired. Flavor was bland and the croissant was fast soggy with the grease & moisture from the meat. Came with very flavorful sweet peppers.
French fries were average. Slightly dry but good. 

I would eat here again and stick with the hot dogs."}
{"text":"As an Illinoisan, I wanted to love it. I really did! True to my tag line, I gave this joint two tries. The first time was awful. Waited in line 1/2 hour to order, 20 min to get food and then both of our orders were wrong. The Italian beef sandwiches were very dry, forgot our cheese and gave us the wrong drinks. I ordered iced tea, stirred sweetener in it and it exploded all over the table. They have given me root beer by mistake. Tables were left unclean and littered with gooey trash even thought it was so busy that they needed tables turned fast. Clearly overwhelmed (it was a weekend around 2 PM). 

Went back today at a less busy time(11 am weekday) and got there just before the noon rush. No line and got food very quickly. A kind staff member even asked a worker to help with a highchair for little dude. I ordered beef and cheddar with extra gravy this time and cheese fries. The sandwich was still dry but cheese fries awesome. By the time I was ready for a drink refill, the line was enormous and you have to ask staff for a refill. My friend really enjoyed her Chicago dog but did not care for her onion rings. She said they were oily and flavorless.

Trip two was a bit better but still not overly impressed with this location. Thumbs up on cheese fries and Chicago dog but not worth the trip here from East Mesa."}
{"text":"Flashback, after living in the Valley for awhile I was so exited to hear Portillo's was coming here. Now that they are here it's fantastic, just like every other Portillo's they kept up the quality they are known for.  Excellent place"}
{"text":"Great if you like Chicago style dogs. Busy place due to the popularity, but the service is pretty fast. Pretty good shakes too."}
{"text":"I was surprised at how much I enjoyed the Italian Beef. I didn't get to try a hotdog, but next time I definitely will. My only complaint: no hot sauce or tabasco! I love to put tabasco on my Cheesesteaks, and I actually happened to have a packet in my purse, and it added the perfect kick to the already delicious sandwich. Very inexpensive, too!"}
{"text":"First time diner here at Portillos and overall I have to say I'm not as impressed as I thought I would be. I had the beef and cheddar croissant which was good but too soggy for my liking. ( I've heard that's a Chicago thing?! ) I also tried some of the southwest BBQ chicken salad. Portillos is definitely not the place to order a salad. The lettuce wasn't fresh and the dressing was more like water. Stick to the hot dogs which were really tasty! The most amazing thing I've had so far? Chocolate cake shake. Which is a MUST try. You will not disappointed, that's a promise! The staff was also very friendly and helpful definitely a plus!"}
{"text":"I honestly think garbage cans can provide better service than this utter dump. We're from Chicago and always so excited to get some Portillo's but we have nothing but issues, always, with the kids who work here.

Disrespectful, slow, order is ALWAYS wrong and for the price we're paying, we'd expect more.

We're done giving this dump a chance. Last time we come here."}
{"text":"The greek salad had some major flaws with the chicken - some pieces were slimy and not edible. This salad has lost its charm and won't be ordered again. In a better decision, I tried the $1.99 tamale and that was surprisingly very tasty in a non mexican kind of way.  They were also touting some famous lemon cake that is limited time only and I would say it is worth a try. Probably needed some more lemon action, but a good piece of cake not on a cake -making place kind of way. It is the next level cake down, but solid for a fast food chain."}
{"text":"Meh. Way too pricey for a generic hot dog and generic fries. Too many better places to spend your money. Not going back."}
{"text":"I came here tonight after hearing all of the hype over this place. I ordered the maxwell polish dog and my boyfriend got the beef sandwich. 

The food was extremely greasy. There was literally a pool of grease surrounding my hotdog. I wouldn't say that the food was bad, but it definitely was not as good as everyone had been raving about. 

Overall the service was really friendly. Store was run smoothly and was clean. But based on the food, I don't think I will be returning."}
{"text":"Excellent beef and sausage sandwiches. Can get crowded during lunch, but not too bad."}
{"text":"This Portillos is very bad their food is awful they always mess up our order and they are prejudice of dark-skinned people I'll never ever eat here again their service is very slow and every time I ordered a big beef they would mess it up and make it look like slop and when I would confront the manager about it they would bring me a small beef sandwich back which I did not order I ordered a big beef I have found out that 2 years ago they recently sold that's why their food sucks if I could give minus five stars I would that's how bad this place is"}
{"text":"Never seen one of these outside of Chicago. Great decor, nice customer service, and speedy delivery. Food was good and tasty. 3 dogs a large Coke, small strawberry shake, and a small fry for under $20.00. Not bad at all. 
Enjoy"}
{"text":"Had been meaning to try this place and so glad I did.  They have a great sausage and pepper sandwich that I get each time!  The onion rings are so tasty, crispy and not greasy.  They have chicken sandwiches, Halibut sandwich which is also good.  They also have extensive salads and the best thing is that when you get one to go, they package the toppings separately so the salad doesn't get wilted.  Reasonably priced with a drive through, so what are you waiting for!"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE Portillo's Hot Dogs!!! Growing up in Illinois (the land of Portillo's) I have a soft spot in my heart for their food and decor, so my review might be slightly biased..

That said, my experience at this location was just as great as those back home. The decor is lively and inviting and the old school feel of the cashiers shouting back your order/watching it come together on the line is pretty neat. Im a sucker for the Chicago Dog and their cheese fries, both of which are perfectly put together. They use juicy all beef hot dogs with that perfect snappy skin and they do a good job balancing the toppings (onion, mustard, relish, pickle, tomato, pepper, celery salt) inside the soft poppy seed bun (the only way to serve a hot dog). The fries are always very fresh and the cheese sauce is pure liquid gold. They do a good job with their pastas too. Ive ordered the lasagna a couple times and I always enjoy it. 

But if you really want to have the experience of a lifetime, go for a slice of their chocolate cake. Absolutely the best you'll find anywhere. Its light, fluffy and decadent and the icing is balanced/ perfectly sweetened. You wont regret it. If you're feeling really adventurous, you could also try their chocolate cake shake, which is just as good. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Worst food and worst costumer service I've had in Arizona 

We decided to try it out instead of in and out. It was outrageously overpriced, food was low quality"}
{"text":"I finally got a chance to check this fine place out with the wife. Wow it is still pretty busy with lots of families everywhere enjoying themselves and having a tasty treat at the same time. I even saw several groups giving each other hugs with excitement as they gathered up together.

Both inside and out are very clean and well decorated with style. It is fun just going around and looking at all the cool items hanging on the wall. This place is oiled like a well tuned machine. Simply walk up and order, pay, then step to the side and pick up your food. You can watch them diligently working in the kitchen to get the orders to perfection. Cool!

Had to get a Jumbo Dog Chicago Style which is basically what they call everything. Also tried out the Beef and Cheddar on a Croissant with Sweet Peppers. The wife ordered an Italian Beef with Sweet Peppers and a large side of Cheese Fries to share.

The food was really tasty and fresh. I particularly liked the Dog which was created perfectly and had a great flavor profile. The Beef and Cheddar was also very tasty but seemed to be a little skimpy on the beef. The basic Fries and Cheese was hypnotically good. Maybe I'm just a sucker for that kinda cheesy goodness. They also have Burgers, Chicken Sandwiches, Salads, plus a whole lot more.

Nice place and I would definitely go back again. Would like to see the foot traffic for the order line go around the outside of the dinning area instead of cutting right through the middle and creating a criss cross of confusion for those eating, trying to get a napkin, or a refill. Maybe hiring a Feng shui Master to give it an adjustment. Reversing the kitchen would be too expensive at this point. LOL!

Grab a menu or study it before hand. A lot of people have a list of what they want already. Just remember - Go Cubbies & Da Bears!"}
{"text":"Great place to check out when you are in the mood for some tasty Chi-town favorites. The Tempe location has the same inside layout as their other Scottsdale location. The bonus here is Tempe Marketplace is within walking distance. Perfect when you need to work off some of those delicious calories.

Normally order the Italian Beef with both Sweet and Hot Peppers and get it DIPPED. Sometimes like to add Cheese or even go BIG BEEF when I'm feeling unusually hungry. On other visits it is hard not to resist a few Chi Dogs with some Cheese Fries on the side. They even have a jumbo version of the DOG. Other selections include Burgers, Chicken, Fish, Veggie Sandwiches and a nice selection of healthy Salads.

Service is quick and friendly and your order shows up almost instantly at the next window. My only pet peeve is that the food is always wrapped up and put in a paper bag. Lets just say the chili dogs and other items can get a little messy as they tackle each other in order to get a good home field advantage for the team. Da BEARS!

Don't forget a piece of Chocolate Cake or one of their famous Shakes before you leave. This place is fun and is definitely on my work time lunch rotation.

New CUBS spring training facility to open up right down the street. It is going to be packed with tons of people who enjoy great baseball and know how to eat. Come in and give them a visit and tell them ... DIP ME BABY and GO CUBBIES!

4.5 STARS"}
{"text":"Always perfect, every time we go. Just like Chicago! My boyfriend and I were die-hard fans of Portillo's in Illinois. It's amazing how easily you can forget how good, simple food and classic ingredients can be.

Italian Beef, extra dipped is my go-to. Matthew adds Mozzarella to step it up. He sometimes dips it in ketchup... I don't know why, but he loves it! And I love him!

Thanks, Portillo's, 
Love Matthew and Bree"}
{"text":"Tremendous Italian beefs and hot dogs, great French fries as well. Get the shortcake you won't regret it! Also the chocolate cake shake is dank."}
{"text":"Where is my little muffin? I got the salad, but it came with a piece of decent wedge bread. There was no sign of the Lemon Poppyseed muffin that is usually present. The Mediterrean salad was good, but only had one container of dressing, not the normal two. I haven't been here in months, but bring back that muffin. Otherwise, still a good salad for the money. ($8)."}
{"text":"Awesome spot! Same as the ones in Chicago! Love love love their beefs and cheese fries! Always fresh with fast service! So happy to have a piece of my hometown in az!"}
{"text":"AWFUL!!!!   Would give -5 stars if I could. Got a hot dog with mustard and onions and the hotdog was boiled not grilled and of course there's nothing that tells you it's going to be boiled. It didn't even taste completely cooked. 
Got a chopped salad that was 98% lettuce.  There were about four little pieces of chicken and add some green onion and cabbage and the tiniest bit of pasta.  All the other stuff that was supposed to be in it wasn't In it and there were supposed to be several other ingredients.

Go ANYWHERE else but this place."}
{"text":"Really good quality food for what it costs , their lemon cake shake is top notch , pretty good atmosphere. Props to Angelin for being a great drive thru employee"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a great Midwest hot dog or Italian Beef sandwich, look no further. Crinkle cut fries are also a must. Was so excited when they made their way to Arizona and I stop by there quite frequently. Never a let down."}
{"text":"My husband really likes this place me on the other hand not so much. I always get a salad which obviously is the wrong thing. The salads are not good and the dressings are not good either. So if you go there don't bother getting a salad!"}
{"text":"I do not have good things to say about this overpriced drive thru.  I dont get the obsession with it.  The food is not good.  I have had 3 salads they all sucked.  How you order through the drive thru is weird.  There is no speaker they use their employees to stand there in the drive thru to take your order.  They hand you a menu and wait for you to decide.  its so uncomfortable I would just drive away but my husband was driving and he is so much nicer than me."}
{"text":"The drive-thru line may look intimidating but don't be fooled, it moves quickly! The prices are decent and the food is delicious. Always a winner with the kids."}
{"text":"This place is on point!! They have tons of awards, recognitions, and celebrity guests who enjoy their food. They have hot dogs, hamburgers, pastas, and salads. The food was delicious and the atmosphere was pleasant. We went at lunch time on a Saturday, so that's probably why, but the noise level was intense. Tons of people talking. Ordering the food was a bit confusing. You order food in one place (know what you want ahead of time) and pay in another location."}
{"text":"Well pull my pants down and take me to a Chicago Bath House because I found a Portillos in Arizona.Â  It was like finding gold in the desert.Â  In Chi-town there is a few legendary staples that make it what it is. The Mob, bad sports fans & Portillos. I decided to get a couple of the signature items. First the Itallian Beef, not the extra beefy Itallian beef because I'm not big and fat like a Bears fan.Â  It was juicy on a delicious bun. The sweet and hot peppers made it perfect.Â  I also got the Chicago style hotdog.Â  First of all why do they put all that stuff on it?Â  Oh wait, look at the size of Bears fans.Â  Reguardless it's delicious. I only had one.Â  I would recommed more than one to any Cubs fan so they can shut the F up about winning the World Series for 5 minutes. I normally get burgers there and I highly recommend them along with the fries.Â  I give this Portillos 5 hotdogs in the bun at the Bath House."}
{"text":"We've been to Portillo's on three occasions, we won't be back. 
- Nothing we've had was beyond mediocre quality. Dry Italian Beef, average Hot Dogs, Chicken Parmesan a`la Microwave, and yesterday's BBQ ribs; a sample of some of the inspiring cuisine we've experienced
-It's friggin' loud in this place, and you're going to wait in line for awhile before you can order. I guess it wouldn't be a big deal, but since the food is garbage, it compounds the bad experience. 
-It's not a good value for the money considering the many excellent Chicago-style places in town. 
-Service is pretty good, and the place was clean."}
{"text":"Welcome to the desert Portillo's! Everyone from Chi-Town is in hot dog heaven!"}
{"text":"Went to lunch here for the first time. This place is super cute. Loads of character!  I had the everything hot dog with fries and a coke for about 7 bucks. The food came out quickly and tasted great. Im not a big hot dog fan generally ..but I really liked it!"}
{"text":"So lucky to have two Portillo's in the area.  The beef sandwich and beef and sausage sandwich are wonderful.  The salads are really good too.  The secret is the chocolate cake.  Its fantastic, super moist.  The chocolate frosting is just right."}
{"text":"I final made it to this place. I had the Italian sandwich, double dipped. Yummy!  It was busy, but the service was fast. You just walk up and order."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant for the first time a few days ago. Wow!!! It's a retro 1950's Chicago-themed fast food restaurant specializing in hot dogs, sausages and burgers. They also have an extensive salad menu. They play 1950's music and the decor matches. This is a fun place to take children to or a fun family outing.

I thought the food was spectacular! I also tried the, \"Pumpkin shake\" which was out-of-this-world!

I hereby confer a solid 5 star rating!"}
{"text":"Not my kind of place. I'm not particularly one to wait to order food, wait in a line to receive it and basically wait on myself. Disappointingly,  food wasn't all the great. Nothing to write home about. I'm not really sure as to why the place is so popular. I am not anxious to return."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of a modern take on an old fashioned diner.  Huge menu with options for everyone.  The vibe is fun and we ordered a ton of food and the bill was only $30, which is so rare these days.  My hubby said the beef sandwich was one of the best he's ever had and I tried the tamale in a bowl which was like tex mex comfort food.  We all fought over the lemon cake that we brought home.  My only suggestion is to open a location closer to us in San Diego!"}
{"text":"We were visiting AZ and we always try to hit restaurants we don't know. This was our last \"try out\" before heading back to TX. The hot dog are average, can do those at home any day.
I had their chicken Tuscan salad which was delicious. My husband got their chicken Parmesan and enjoyed it very much. I would go back and recommend it, to be honest I don't think their hot dog is their best option on the menu, but I'll leave that entirely to you. We enjoyed our food a lot."}
{"text":"Growing up in and around the Chicago area, I am ashamed to admit that it took this landmark eatery's expansion to Arizona for me to walk in the door.  The wife and I decided that our Sunday Fun-day wouldn't be complete without a Chicago Dog, Italian Beef and Rings...I should probably mention that we split a Chocolate Cake Shake too.

The employees are very \"Chicago\", filled with personality and attitude, all working for a seemingly competent and well managed organization to boot.  The interior was very clean, it appeared that they have numerous employees who's function it  is to quickly clean up tables as guests pick up their trays to depart.  Many other restaurants come to mind that should take note.

On to the food:  the Hot Dog was, well a Hot Dog.  Delicious in it's own right, but a Hot Dog nonetheless.  One discerning characteristic comes to mind, the poppy seed bun.  Fresh, almost spongy, not soggy.

Italian Beef was the best of recent memory, possibly knocking Mr.Beef (666 N Orleans St, Chicago IL) off of my #1 spot.  Ordered it wet with hot peppers.  Serving was proper, plenty of meat, bread that was moist and retained much of the Au Jus.  Purely Fantastic!  Onion Rings were delicious, not too thick,  the batter is unique in its texture, much crispier than I remember rings typically being.   

Chocolate Cake Shake: two things I am not 1) A fan of chocolate 2) A fan of shakes.
How can two things that I like so little, taste so good?  A must for all visitors."}
{"text":"Awesome place with quality food!  I loved the Italian Beef sandwich (dipped for me) and it had such good flavor.  Can't wait to try other items from the menu.  The wife got one of the hotdogs and really enjoyed that too!"}
{"text":"Husband and I went there last night......AWESOME EXPERIENCE!
Food was amazing.....i got the hamburger and he go the chili cheese hot dog and a sausage. We also got the fries! Even though it was SUPER crowded, our food was out quick! I can't believe how clean the place was with the amount of people that were there. Every employee was busy and positive. We had a great experience with an employee. Her name was Stephanie. After we finished, my husband and I were just talking. SHe approached us and asked how our meal was, gave us some suggestions for next time and was just chatting with us. We were sitting over by the shake/cake counter and I told her how I was debating getting a piece of chocolate cake. She told us how she helped make it from scratch that morning and that we had to try it. Convincing me to eat any type of sweet is not hard, so needless to say I ordered a piece. IT WAS UN-REAL! super moist and the frosting was the best I've ever had! Between the service, the food and the employees....we had a great experience. We will for sure be back!"}
{"text":"Just as good as the IL-born stores. So glad they finally came out here. If you never have checked out portillos and like the old time 50s style diner motif-with truly the best hot dogs, you need to check this place out!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and customer service! However, I ordered the beef and cheese croissant and the bread was really soggy, too much beef and very little cheese. I would come back but order something different."}
{"text":"Pretty good hot dogs, I got the polish with onions and large chile cheese .. all really good."}
{"text":"It's Portillos! It's Chicago! It's excellent! How could you go wrong with the Italian beef or a Chicago hot dog. This is the quintessential Chicago joint to get the best of Chicago. Arizona is lucky to have a couple of these around!"}
{"text":"Always good! A great Chicago institution. The best Italian beef anywhere! The hot dogs, Italian sausage and charcoal grilled burgers are good too. Oh, and if you have room, try the chocolate cake. It's awesome!"}
{"text":"Looove a good Chicago dog so decided to try it out. Just as others have said, the food here is fine, good, average. The jumbo dog was good, but nothing special. I can truthfully get a better hot dog right down the street or at any Costco.

I also got the Italian beef. That was better, but again, nothing to write home about. chocolate malt was good. I ordered the large which is enough for 3 people. 

I will probably go back, but don't see it being a regular stop. Worth a try to figure out yourself."}
{"text":"Love this place for the Italian Beef sandwiches and fries, they are both amazing.  Same quality as the locations in Chicago.  Big thumb up!"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of hot dogs, enough my husband teases me about it.
So naturally, when I heard Portillo's was coming to Scottsdale I was excited. 

It was strange to me, to see a Resturant MONTHS after opening, with drive through lines across the parking lot, and a VERY VERY full dining room. 

We got in line, and I had no idea what I wanted, and didn't have much time to pick because someone with a bag and a pencil pressures you into ordering before you even get to a register. I understand they are trying to speed things up, but when I'm a first timer --- let me look at the menu. 

I ended up ordering a Chili Dog. 

It was great to have glass between us, and the kitchen. It was exciting to watch everything going on and MAN do they have a LOT of employees. Everything seemed to work like clock work. 

I have also decieded my new dream job is to be the girl who calls out the order number! 
Number Eight Seven, you're about to be in HEAVEN!  Very clever! 

The food was delightful. 
I really enjoyed my chili dog, and the french friends were hot and tasty. 


I will be returning - but don't rush me!"}
{"text":"Been going here since they opened. Decided to try the drive thru because I was in a hurry. I would have given a 5 star but was seriously irritated when I got home. How are you going to skimp me so bad on a large fry. I've ordered a small fry before and got more. The fact that the guy at the window double looked in the bag to make sure I had everything and saw this abomination of a large fry and still served it to me is even more irritating. Had a chance to redeem yourself and totally blew it. Some may say I'm going overboard a lil. But to pay $25 for a fry, 3 plain hot dogs, Italian sausage and two drinks. I better get my money's worth."}
{"text":"Yum yum good stuff. Best in town. I used to love Luke's but will be going here for my beef sandwich from now on. Just got back from Chicago and saw they had 2 locations in AZ. Sorry for Luke's I went to Chicago and tried Portillos."}
{"text":"Awesome to find this place in Tempe! Go and you'll think you're back in Chicago. Fantastic Italian beef sandwich and the sweet peppers are so yummy. Kind of messy to eat but a wonderful experience eating here!"}
{"text":"Looking for a quiet, not too busy place for lunch or dinner? This place isn't for you. Portillo's is always packed, hectic, and loud, but worth it! I've never been to Chicago and haven't frequented the Midwest much but this place reminds me of classic Americana. 

I always order an Italian Beef sandwich with extra gravy, which just means that add gravy on the sandwich. You can also get the sandwich dry with gravy on the side, or if you're feeling saucy they'll dunk the whole thing in gravy (a little too soggy for my taste) If you like French Dip with au jus gravy then you'll love this sandwich. Their crinkle fries are great too! A large fry will easily feed 2 people. 

Ever wanted to try a blended chocolate cake? Try their chocolate cake shake. It is chocloately-goodness with chunks of cake! But pace yourself or pay with a stomach ache. 

During spring training this place is packed with Chicago Cubs fans as the Cubs' stadium is just down the road. 

The service is average. Behind the counter, they're very much about speed, which is great! But the employees out in the dining area are friendly and willing to wipe down your table, help you refill your drink, or take your trash."}
{"text":"Revised review....This is now the fifth time we've had dinner here. The first visit was the best, since then....meh.  The food is good, but not outstanding. The cashier really \"doesn't want to do this.\" May be a long time before we return."}
{"text":"I picked up a hotdog for my husband and a chopped salad for me. My salad was really good! Chicken, bacon, bits of blue cheese I was really surprised it was so good. A hotdog place that has delicious salads! The salad also came with a small poppy seed lemon  muffin that was good!"}
{"text":"This was our first time here and I must say that I am a fan! fast, friendly service and GREAT food make this place a great spot to eat a wiener or a fantastic Italian beef sandwich."}
{"text":"I got the giant chili dog, pasta salad and roll. As you can see, \"giant\" is actually just bun-sized. Idk how little the \"regular\" sized hot dog is but I'm willing to sacrifice my hunger to find out! Everything We had was delicious!!! It was incredibly busy and it always is so be prepared to wait. The customer service was good, everyone was friendly. A complaint I have is that you have to wait for your food to get your drinks and the layout. It was hot af the day we went and it would have been great to get our drinks beforehand while our food is being made. Everything is laid out really confusing and I had to go to 2 different counters to get my food since I ordered a side of pasta salad. There's no traditional table service so you go up to the counter and order than go and pick up your food. They do have a drive through if you are apprehensive about going inside. All in all, it was really good and we will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food but lately there have been numerous discrepancies with the orders, and the customer service has slipped!  I've opened up my options lately."}
{"text":"To be honest, Portillos is one of the best fast food restaurants in town. It's cheaper then McDonald's and definitely tastes better. The Italian beef was filled with delicious beef and tasted especially good. The French fries are cheap and delicious. They were rightly seasoned and filled with flavor. The bathroom was clean and they had nice outdoor seating with a misting system. I will be coming back."}
{"text":"I would give almost any Portillo's 5 stars by default, but this one had a couple of screw ups with the order and the staff did not seem to happy about making things right. In fact, they seemed downright offended that we returned a very burnt chicken sandwich, making me wait 10 minutes for a new one, not even offering to bring it to my table, where my family was waiting. They also forgot a couple of items from our order.

That said, the fries, onion rings, hot dogs, and beef were excellent, and the location is much nicer than the one at McClintock. However, when you pay a premium for fast food you expect decent service.

By the way I am originally from Chicago, & I understand the attitude, but this staff needs more people skills training. 

They earn 4 stars and not 3 cuz the other few visits were not as bad as this one."}
{"text":"This place is staffed like crazy.  I've never seen a restaurant have so many people working drive-thru, and somehow keep things very well managed.  The Italian Beef here is top-notch.  Absolutely excellent.  I have eaten here a few times now, and do have one bit of advise.  I personally like my Italian Beef sandwich dipped.  If you do as well, make sure you are eating there.  I made the mistake of not getting the ah jus on the side, instead of dipped, and had a rather soupy mess when i got home.  The meat and peppers was still amazing, but the bread had lost all molecular integrity.  Make the trip to try this place.  Well worth it!"}
{"text":"Quick service, low prices, good food, and a nice setting. Prices are close to a fast food place, but the food is so much better and the seating area is nicer too. I had the grilled vegetarian sandwich and it was good. The vegetables were fresh and the flavors were good."}
{"text":"I did not know what to expect going to a hot dog resturant but this place was a nice surprise. The dogs were great and the hamburger was moist and flavorful. Hope the make it to Austin, Tx soon."}
{"text":"Good stuff.  Real deal Chicago food.  Vienna beef hot dogs, Italian beef and who doesn't love crinkle cut fries!"}
{"text":"Are you Arizona lovin'? Are you a Chicago Cubs fan? If you answered yes to one or both of those questions, then you probably LOVE Portillo's Hot Dogs!

We stopped by before seeing a cubbies spring training game. I'm bummed we didn't have enough time to go inside and check out the magically fun atmosphere, but it's on my Arizona bucket list fersure!

Drive thru took awhile but it's so worth it!! I can't even tell you what all we ordered but our two bags were stuffed with delicious food. The full menu is monstrous. You can order spaghetti! Who knew?? Their beef sandwich is outstanding! The hot dogs are the real deal. Yet the true MVP are those cheese fries. OMG! So bomb. Like I even loved them cold. I'll be coming back for more next time I'm in Tempe."}
{"text":"I've been hooked on this place since I lived in California, when I heard Phx was getting one I said about time.
Everyone I take to Portillo's loves it.
The decor is awesome.
Lines move fast.
You can see your food being made.
Chilli cheese fries are a bit small in portion but scrumptious.
Sweet and spicy peppers along with the combo (sausage and beef) is delicious . 
HUGE milk shakes."}
{"text":"Great, Great, Great ... One of the best places to eat in Scottsdale and that's coming from someone who has lived here 13 years and isn't a big fan of most of the food here.  Hot dogs, fries, Beef sandwich ... all a ten ... and the wife was happy ... the kids were happy ... Give it a try ... 5 stars in every way."}
{"text":"I went with my husband today - my second time, his first.   I ordered the chili cheese dog and it was amazing!  I really like that it was less than $4 and if I was any more hungrier I couldn't gotten two for a pretty good price.  My husband ordered a steak and cheese on croissant roll which looked pretty good.  He did say he wished they had chopped up the peppers, but I'm sure they'd gladly cut them if he asked.  We'll definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"How can you go wrong with this place? One of the last few good chain restaurants. Go with the combo and the cheese fries. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Portillo's is here!!!  I am from Naperville IL originally and it's great to have Portillos here in AZ. I stayed away the first day, but heard they served 10,000 people in 12 hours, wow.  I also heard it was the biggest grand opening of any Portillo's ever!  I am not surprised.  Did you know Phoenix Metro has more Chi-town transplants than any other city? It's estimated there are over 700,000. Shocking!  Actually, not really. Chi-town is a great city, but the weather is horrendous. Now Portillos is here and we can all rejoice and occasionally sneak over for a Beef n Cheddar, Hot Dog or maybe even a Chocolate Cake Shake (watch the calories on that one). Anyway, their salads are really great too, so everything in moderation right?  Portillo's prices are very reasonable. The beef sandwiches and hot dogs are all family priced and the food is always made up fresh while you wait. The drive thru system isn't the best, but it's fast.  I just would prefer to be able to see the menu before you reach the mobile order takers, but your best bet is to ask for a takeout menu and go home and do your research so you know what you want before you drive thru because you will never have time to see the menu board. lol.  

Here's more great news, Portillo's is opening another location at Tempe Marketplace this summer (under construction now) and almost ready to announce a Chandler location as well. I also hear there will be at LEAST 3 more stores, one in North Phoenix (Desert Ridge anybody?), one by I-17, another over by Arrowhead Mall and the new Estrella Falls Mall in Goodyear. I am sure they will all do great.  As Dick Portillos says, \"we call Phoenix the west suburbs\" because there are so many Chicagoans out here.  Not  too mention for vacations, spring training and snowbirds.  So Portillos, welcome to Phoenix, we are happy you are here and can't wait to see more of you!

By the way, I agree with the poster down below, we need a few more tastes of home, specifically Chicago Style Pizza and Lou Malnati's would fit the bill perfectly. Come on Lou, come to beautiful AZ with your tasty Chi-Town Buttery Crusted Pizza."}
{"text":"You can certainly read the reviews around here to get a general idea of the interior and the wait times. But that's fine, I'm patient and if the food is good, then I'll wait for it. It's not like it's a McDonalds or something...

...I kind of wish it was though. The sandwich I got was completely inedible and the bread was SOAKED. I'm not being melodramatic here. It was as if they actually dropped the bread in water and served it that way. The taste was extremely bland and didn't taste like any sort of identifiable meat which is shame considering it seems to be totally packed. I don't know, maybe they have good fries or something."}
{"text":"First time visit, I enjoyed the food. I had a chili cheese dog and a Jumbo Hot dog, made to order. My friend had a tuna croissant, and fries. I also had a tamale to go, I wasn't expecting much from the tamale, but it was pretty good. Customer service was nice and friendly. I will return in the future. By the way the lemonade was delish."}
{"text":"If people in the 50s had to eat stuff like this I feel sorry for them. 1. The layout of this place is confusing and makes no sense. 2. The food is artificial and tasteless. The relish on the hot dog was practically neon green. 3. Slow service. I'm totally confused by the great reviews for this place... I'd go for the $1.50 Costco hot dog over this any day"}
{"text":"So I heard about Portillo's from other people and would always pass by this restaurant as it's right near Tempe Marketplace. The atmosphere inside is very loud and busy which usually wouldn't bother me that much however the food was nothing special to compensate for that. I was thinking about getting the Chicago Dog before I came here however I decided to pass on that as I would rather try the Chili Cheese Dog instead. I also got the cheese fries as well which was a disappointment. As for the dog it was fine but I probably wouldn't get it again.

On another visit I did order the chocolate cake shake that a lot of people mentioned on here. Once again not really that impressed and the shake was more of a dessert instead of a drink. The shake was too thick for me to use a regular straw and I had to use a spoon in order to finish it. There are much better places in the area to get shakes."}
{"text":"This place has gone down hill the past 6 months.  The food is never portioned the same, and is not consistent.  Today I received my food and drink, waited by the window to get a straw, which was not given to me with my drink.  Literally at least 8 people walked past the window saw me trying to flag them over for a simple straw and was completely ignored by everyone of the staff.  I definitely will not be returning to this location... ever!  Finally after 6 minutes of sitting at the window, I got attitude from an employee, and finally got a straw."}
{"text":"I would give them five stars, except I really shouldn't eat there. It is way too good! Love the roast beef sandwich (reminds me of my old days living in Chicago). And then there are the cheese fries. Enough said!"}
{"text":"Stay away from this location. Clearly a Management problem. With 10 employees at the window and give customers a 20 minute wait they are rude after that. Clear this franchise owner has not been shooting for success."}
{"text":"Loveee this place!! The wait was not to bad since there is so many transplants here. The food or at least the dips and the chicken tenders are on point. Staff very friendly. 
The downfall would be when you eat inside, waiting for oDer is very chaotic borderline anxiety attack causing. The problem with the drive through? They expect you know what you want way before you get to the order screen. They expect you to keep a menu in the car... 
But other than that, I cam tolerate it because I absolutely love their dips!!"}
{"text":"Got three tenders instead of four and didn't get the ranch I ordered, they put mayo on my mom's sandwich when she asked for none, my brother's sub sandwich was an absolute mess (but hey it was a meatball sub), a little surprised they didn't mess up my dad's salad with chicken. Thank god it tasted okay.

Ps. Your employees might care more if they didn't have to wear those uniforms"}
{"text":"Only adequate.  

There are several better hot dogs in the valley.  See Ted's for a similar priced dog that will blow your mind, or The Main Ingredient Ale House for a top notch \"fancy\" dog.

The beef sandwich is fine, but it's not something to bring me back.  It's kind of fun having a sogged sandwich disintegrate in your mouth like bread thrown to ducks.  But it's also kind of like eating duck-grade bread.  The gravy/jus is flavorful but the meat isn't anything special.  Tender and well prepared but not much to it.  Compared to a good cheesesteak, the beef sandwich lacks character. 

Poor onion rings.  Crunchy, yes, but they were all coating, no onion.

Good price to value ratio.  Neat restaurant interior, but it's a zoo.  Friendly staff, fast service at 8PM on a weeknight."}
{"text":"Since we were out and about in Tempe Market Place,  Meg and I decided to try Portillo's. we'd heard quite a bit about the place and figured we'd give it a try. In hindsight, we probably should have just kept driving home.

To start, I tried one of the chili hot dogs and fries. The dog was definitely as advertised; Tasted exactly like a Vienna sausages you get out of the canned foods aisle. And the chili tasted like they took a few steps down the same aisle to grab a can of Hormel. And to complete the shopping experience they took a stroll over to the freezer aisle for some good ol' Ore-Ida Crinkle Fries.

However, in the spirit of giving them a solid try, we decided to try the dipped Italian beef  based off multiple recommendations here. I'll give Portillo's on thing, they are consistent! Nothing like discount brand deli sliced roast beef drowned in with some poorly mixed Lawry's gravy then stuff in a bun and drowned again before flopping it on a plate. Was a greasy, salty mess of yuck!

Seriously it all tasted like I could have taken the exact same grocery trip and made the dogs, chili, fries, roast beef and gravy at home. It's possible that it was a really off day for Portillo's but I sincerely doubt I will be back to give them another chance."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this Portillo's more recently because I feel it's better quality food when it comes to fast food. Staff is always accommodating and friendly, and the food usually comes out in a reasonable time. The inside is decorated like a 1950's diner with great seating and the music to go with it. 
As far as the food goes, I love it. After you order, you get a ticket and have to wait for your number to get called which can be difficult when it's noisy in the place (mainly during spring training). I usually order a cheeseburger plain, french fries, and a soda, which will cost you around $11. The burger has a really nice flavor to it, and the french fries are one of my favorites. I have also tried the halibut fish sandwich which I also really enjoy. They even have a menu for Lent season which is pretty unique for the area. I have also had their salads which are very tasty, just not necessarily my go-to item. I know they are known for their hotdogs which I have yet to try, but I'm sure they are very good as well. Although the pricing here is a few dollars more than your average fast food place, it's definitely made up for in the quality of the food."}
{"text":"8-10 years ago I was working in Chicago quite a bit, driving up from St. Louis for a week at a time and that's when I discovered Portillo's and that beef and cheddar croissant.  That thing is magical.  Totally unhealthy and I love it.  I think back then I tried a couple of other things on the menu, but when I think of Portillo's I think of that sandwich.

Now that Portillo's is in AZ we thought we'd give them a try and see if it's still how I remember.  And get this.....Mr. M lived in Chicago for a few years and had NEVER been to a Portillo's.  Can you believe that?  So we had to go.

He ordered the Italian sausage with bacon and I ordered the polish sausage.  We also ordered the Chicken Pecan salad thinking sharing a salad would soothe our guilty consciences for eating those tasty sausages.  

My polish was about a 3/5.  The sausage itself was great, 5/5, but the bun was soggy and fell apart after one bite and had way too many thick onions on top.  I love onions, but this was overkill.  I had to pick half of them off and it was still smothered with onions.  

Mr. M's Italian sausage with bacon was probably our favorite thing that we tried.  4/5.  The sausage had a very nice flavor and came on a more sturdy, Italian bread type bun.  Next time I'll have to get the polish on that bun.  It held up very well.  As you can see in the pic, the bacon isn't high quality bacon, kinda tasted like the precooked stuff, but it worked.  

The salad was kind of a letdown.  2.5 or 3/5.  I thought it was kind of funny how 6 pieces of spinach ringed the bowl, but then 98% of the salad was just bland iceberg lettuce.  The description on the menu says a blend of lettuces.  It was mainly iceberg.  The chicken was ok, but tasted a little like the precooked stuff too.  It also had a gazillion diced, tasteless tomatoes in it.  With tax those salads are close to 8 bucks apiece and I'm not sure they are worth it.  Didn't hate it, but probably wouldn't get it again.  

I like that their bottles of water are only 99 cents.  A lot of places try to bend you over there and charge 2 bucks or more for a cheap bottle of water.  Overall an okay meal with the sausages being the star of the show.

I can't believe I didn't get the beef and cheddar croissant, but that's just a reason to go back.  They have enough good stuff on the menu to justify the 4 stars for me, and generally the staff are very friendly and helpful.  They are used to being busy and have a good system down.  The only complaint I had was there was an employee cleaning tables who had a spray bottle of chemical that he spritzed a little too close to our food.  Be aware dude.  I don't want my food glazed with Windex or whatever the heck."}
{"text":"The Italian beef sandwiches are the best in Phoenix I found. Also I'm not really a big fan of bell peppers but the sweet peppers they put on the sandwich here are really very good. I get my sandwiches dipped with an extra side of gravy on the side."}
{"text":"I know this place gets a ton of hype from midwesterners but not sure i get it. My food was good and we got it fast, but it's not a destination restaurant for me. I ordered the cheeseburger, it was good. My husband got the Italian Beef and Cheddar, he didn't like it. It is a great place for kids. We took two toddlers and were able to get in and out quickly plus it's loud so their screaming didn't seem to disturb anyone. Next time we're in the area we'll probably try it again just for that fact alone."}
{"text":"Great fast food. Cheese fries and chocolate malt shakes are terrific. Parking is not plentiful, be prepared to park over in Tempe Marketplace and walk over if it's a busy night."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 2 stars instead of giving it 1 star twice . This place used to be my favorite thing about Scottsdale . I'm an HVAC tech and rarely get sent out here to Scottsdale but when I do I used to always stop by for an Italian Beef with Mozz and sweet peppers . But my last 2 visits have been terrible first time I came it was busy lunch hour place was packed and I dined in I ordered an Italian beef w/ mozz and sweet peppers and a traditional hot dog . The Italian beef was like warm the cheese wasn't even close to melted and and I got an entire green bell pepper half just slapped on top . I was kind of in a hurry and thought ok they're busy I'll let it slide . Next I get to the hotdog and the bun was hard and stale and there was enough celery salt on it to choke a horse . Ok now I was angry so I throw down the dog I get up ready to complain and request a refund and my office calls with and emergency call . Ok I gotta go I'll let this visit slide I'll give em another shot next time . So today I waited till they were open for 5 minutes and I hit the drive thru I order an Italian beef same way as always . I'm really excited to stuff down my long anticipated Italian beef so I pull over in the parking lot to feast and bam there it is another jacked up Italian beef this time the meat was cold the cheese wasn't melted at all and again just a hunk of pepper . I'm furious , but instead of going back wasting more time and causing a scene I decided to leave this review . I'm not even so much mad as I am disappointed. I'm really upset that I now don't have a go to place for my Chicago fix . You guys really dropped the ball not once but twice and I can't go back for a round 3 . I'm sorry but you lost a customer, loyal customer I might add . Get your act together guys you used to be the best around"}
{"text":"Really cool atmosphere!  But their hotdogs were just so-so.  They didn't have much flavor.  I'd rather go to their competition down the street, pay the same thing, but miss the cool atmosphere.  Might go again with a friend that has never been."}
{"text":"Being a Chicago native. Nothing can beat Chicago food. This and Al's beef in North Scottsdale will give you best Italian beef sandwiches in AZ. This is a must visit for good chitown food"}
{"text":"This place has great food! Weather you get a hot dog or burger or anything on the menu, you will not be disappointed.

We got the chicken sandwich with fries and also tried the chocolate cake shake and it is life changing! 
This place is located on the corner of Tempe Market Place."}
{"text":"The food was passable, but for the gas plus the cost of the meal, I probably won't be back any time soon. Tom's is closer to home with better Italian beef. The Italian beef was bland, and as for the tamale, well it's not a Mexican food restaurant. The servings are a good size for what you pay. I think I'm just used to more seasoning on my food than they use."}
{"text":"Finally a Portillo's I can get to without going to Chicago! Was down in the Phoenix area a couple weeks ago and drove all the way to Scottsdale just to visit this location. The food is awesome and just as good as the Portillo's that I remember in Chicago. Although the parking lot was packed when I got there, there was pretty much no line to order and the food here is cranked out very quickly. You can even watch them make your food in the window to the left of the cashiers. Their combo italian beef/sausage sandwiches are to die for. I can't wait to come back here next time I'm in the area. Who knows, if I have a craving I might even drive down from Vegas just to eat here!"}
{"text":"My husband drove 22 miles one way to pay $21 for 3 beef sandwiches and $4 for extra peppers. After waiting 20 mins in the drive thru he drove another 22 miles home to realize they did not give us the extra peppers we paid for or the juice on the side for the beef. When I called and spoke with the manager about the situation his response was \"I don't know what you'd like me to do about it, I can't give them to you for free.\" The sandwiches are dry and tasteless without the juice. A waste of money. As a customer if my food isn't made the way I ordered it I expect it to be replaced. I don't drive 40 miles out of my way to find something to complain about so that I can get a free meal, I expect my food to be what I paid for. Which it wasn't. The manager did offer me a $10 gift card which would barely cover the cost of one sandwhich with extra peppers, not even the cost of gas to get me out there and back. What a joke. Very disappointed in how this well known company handles their mistakes."}
{"text":"Portillo's hails from Chicago. They're doing a land office business in Scottsdale and Tempe.

My Italian Beef was SUPERB. Portillo's is clean and well organized, featuring efficient service to handle the BIG crowds.

Stop-in prior to, or after a Cubs game...you won't be disappoiinted."}
{"text":"Everyone should try Portillo's at least once I guarantee you will fall in love with their hotdogs the food is absolutely fabulous and very tasty go and try the Chicago dog"}
{"text":"Starting to slip. Went in for dinner at 5:00 on a Thursday. Not crowded but took 15 mins for food to arrive. The two parties before us had to return to the counter for missing items which backed up things further.  Wonder what things will be like when the snowbirds return."}
{"text":"I'm from Chicago and while in Chicago I actually prefer a less expensive a simpler dog & fries from Gene and Judes.  However, Portillo's has always had great hot dogs, beef sandwiches and chocolate cake.  Needless to say, in Phoenix, when I need a hot dog fix, the next best thing to making my own is to head over to Portillo's. Today's visit didn't disappoint with hot dog, fries and chocolate cake shake.  This was my first chocolate cake shake and while I'm not a chocolate ice cream fan, I've read great reviews about this shake so I decided to give it a try.  It's delicious!  I just needed a vanilla shake afterward to wash down all that chocolate!  Just kidding, I drank a ton of water afterward though."}
{"text":"Chopped salad is on point. And that strawberry shortcake! Bonus points for the lemon poppy seed muffins."}
{"text":"We've eaten in Chicago and had great food, but this place is the worst. Maybe we just ordered the wrong things, but would never go here again.

I got the bbq chicken salad and my husband got the chicken sand. My chicken tasted like a byproduct of hot dog, spam and chicken - absolutely disgusting. I almost hurled. I was so hungry and took the rest of it off the salad just to eat something. The chicken sand felt like a box of air when we took it out of the bag. It was mushy and came with nothing on it. Plus, they wanted $.31 for ranch dressing. You must be kidding me?! The onion rings tasted like frozen rings and the ketchup cups were so small, we couldn't even dip it in anything.

We saw a lot of people got the beef sandwich, and looked good, but will never go here again to even try it. I'll take a bag of Skittles and a Snickers for dinner before I'll visit this place."}
{"text":"Even the channel 3 news guy loves Portillo's, as I found out while enjoying my meal on a warm AZ morning a few weeks back. 

It was Saturday morning, which in my house screams errands, yard work, etc. I headed out the door to get the tires on the Landy Balanced & Rotated at the Goodyear service center on McClintock & Rio Salado. Upon my arrival at the service center I was faced with two options, nether of which sounded fantastical. Sit in the waiting room or walk across the street to tempe marketplace that had not yet opened, and browse the closed stores through the windows. I opted to get my walk on, and as I headed across the street I noticed that there were people at portillo's lining up, and it only being 10am (a few being the channel 3 news guys parked in the news truck) it was then that I decided to give this place a try,after hearing a ton of good & bad about the establishment that was  Chicago favorites. 

When you walk in you are greeted by many friendly faces, hellos, and a really cool looking interior that reminded me of a 50's diner in some way, yet mixed with some modern touches. 

Now to the food:

I had the Italian beef sandwich, that consisted of warm fresh italian bread with slow cooked italian beef piled on high with a ladle of Au Jus over the top. I added hot peppers and mozzarella cheese to my sammy. For my side I chose french fries and ordered a side of the nacho cheese to dip them in.  The fries were fresh, hot and ready for some cheese, which came in a small cup that was more than I could ever imagine to finish, but that did not stop me from trying. 

Bottom line: The food was awesome, and the hot peppers had just enough bite as to not take away from the bread, meat, and cheese that had been piled on. The fries complimented the sandwich perfectly, and had I not ordered them I may have still been a little hungry, as the sandwich I ordered was on the small size. Given the fact the entire meal was around $8.00, I cannot complain. 

I will certainly be back to try more of the Chicago favorites Portillo's is serving up."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise.  From reading alot of the reviews, it seems people are expecting something from this restaurant that, quite simply, this restaurant is not.  This is a pretty cheap restaurant that even offers drive-thru.  I had the ceaser salad and grilled tuna burger and ordered through the drive-thru.  I also made some custimizations (sub cheese for tartar sauce on the tuna; salad dressing on side), and they were all perfected.  The Tuna burger was the best drive-thru, non-meat, item I have ever had.  And the salad was very good with an entire egg and tomatoes, items which I really like in a ceasar, even if not traditional.  Overall, if you are looking for drive-thru and want some new, unique options, then this is the best place in Phoenix area as far as I am concerned."}
{"text":"The valley has always acted as a sort of refuge for long lost Chicago expats looking to escape the harsh Lake Michigan winters.  And increasingly, much of Chicago's food culture has come to the valley with them.  Of late, the Chicago deep dish pizza craze has migrated to the valley with Chicago staples like Lou Malnati's, Gino's East, and Giordano's adding new locations in the Phoenix area.  But just before that recent wave of food migration, it was a Chicago hot dog staple that made its way to the Phoenix area.   Portillo's has been a Chicago institution for more than half a century.  Founder Dick Portillo opened his first hot dog stand in 1963 and there are now more than 40 Portillo's locations in 7 states.  On a Sunday evening after watching football, I ventured to Portillo's Tempe location for my first taste of this midwestern icon.

You can find Portillo's Tempe on the northeast corner of McClintock & Rio Salado.  Truth be told I really had no idea what I'd expected to see.  I had in my head a vision of a small hot dog stand or at most a standard 50 seat fast food joint setup dishing out food at lighting speed.  In reality, Portillo's is far more complex, as evidenced by the sheer monstrosity of their Tempe location.  Brightly lit from the outside, this is anything but a humble hot dog stand.  We're talking a restaurant with seating for upwards of 300 and a drive thru to match.  I'd heard from other Portillo's fans about long lines and a cult like following not dissimilar to the experience of California based In-N-Out Burger restaurants.  That's a fairly apt description, though I would probably more accurately describe my experience at Portillo's Tempe as something more closely resembling a mix of In-N-Out Burger nostalgia and enthusiasm with the casual family friendly atmosphere of a Fuddruckers.  Anyways, enough symbolism and imagery.  Let's get to dinner.

While Portillo's menu has expanded over the years to include a number of offerings including burgers and chicken dishes, I (mostly) stuck with the Portillo's standards during my first go around.  The first dish of choice of course would have to be the Portillo's rendition of the traditional Chicago hot dog.  And in Chicago they're serious when they say their hot dogs get \"dragged through the garden\".  We're talking an all beef hot dog with mustard, neon green relish, chopped onions, tomato slices, half a kosher dill pickle, peppers and celery salt piled high on a steamed poppy seed hot dog bun.  I also got a side of Portillo's favorite cheese fries.  And lastly, I combined a beverage with dessert by ordering their chocolate cake shake.  Portillo's is famous for their homemade chocolate cake and apparently people love their shakes, so voila.  Coming here at dinner you wait in line to place your order (which on Sunday at 6pm was about a 15 minute wait) and then you walk over to the pick up area and wait for your number to get called (which took another 15 minutes).  Total cost for the food, drink and tax came to just under $10.  Was it all worth the wait?

I grabbed a table in the corner inside to enjoy my meal and people watch.  I've actually never had a true Chicago-style hot dog (though I've had many other hot dog renditions in my time).  The hot dog was good, though all the toppings are a little overwhelming.  The mesh of textures from all the veggies and fixins creates a decent variety of flavors, but I finished it feeling like I kind of missed out on the hot dog flavor itself.  Perhaps next time I should get the Jumbo dog to strike that perfect balance.  The cheese fries were, well, underwhelming.  Its just crinkle fries and nacho cheese sauce basically.  It was fine, but honestly the sales pitch for this side dish sounded far more glamorous in my mind.  Lastly, the shake.  I'm mostly a fan of this shake.  Its quite literally liquid cake, but the cake is quite tasty and on the sweet side even for chocolate cake.

So thusfar I'm not really bought into the hype about this place, but I suppose our Chicago expat population is at least partly what is driving Portillo's success in the valley.  I'll admit the prices here are more than fair and the atmosphere of their restaurant is super family friendly so I can understand the suburban appeal of this hot dog stand.  But with all the hot dog establishments big and small throughout the valley, I can't say Portillo's ranks amongst my top favorites (at least not yet).  I'm not opposed to popular establishments from far flung regions trying their hand at the valley culinary scene, provided they deliver a great product at a great value.  Portillo's is good, but for now far from great."}
{"text":"Excellent Chicago food.  You don't need to be a Chicago Cubs' fan to enjoy this great food.  Big Beef and Beef and Sausage are crazy good."}
{"text":"So came in ordered a jumbo hot dog, hailey at the counter said they were out \"didn't offer the regular chili dog\" okay ordered a hot dog no smile from her. When we sat down, my sister came in 5 mins later and ordered a jumbo chili cheese dog after hailey said they \"were out\" my boyfriend went up there and all they said was \"oh sorry we were out 5 mins people don't like to wait\". Never mentioned anything that to us. Some customer service here. Never coming back"}
{"text":"I ate at the portillo's at Chase field and I was sick. Verry disappointed. The restaurant in Scottsdale never disappoints."}
{"text":"First of I'm from Chicago and been here for a few years and disappointed with the food quality and ever since Dick Portillo sold to Warren Buffet it's gone down hill. The dog's are smaller at times and the buns are soaked and soggy and aren't steamed properly.
The Italian beef is tasteless and a bit on the lower end of quality. Heard from management that they know about how it's gone down hill because the products form vendor's are cheaper. Dick you are an idiot!"}
{"text":"Wow, is this place loud.  Met a friend I hadn't talked to in a while.  Hard to get a sentence out without them calling \"Number 47 - come get some heaven - Number 47\" so loud you can't hear each other.

The hot dogs are pretty good, but I really don't get it."}
{"text":"My vote is ok.  I've spent lot's of time in Chicago and despite coworkers rating it at \"you must try it\", I didn't care to spend the time in line but when they opened up shop near work I gave it a try.  Quality, freshness, pricing were good and service was entertaining.  Glad I arrived for a slightly early lunch as it got crowded quickly near noon (Shea location)."}
{"text":"The people reviewing here must all be from Chicago.. I've only been there once and had the chicken parm and it was a petrified turd.. I tossed it in the trash.. it was hard as if it were frozen but it was warm.. very strange"}
{"text":"Portillos is the bomb dot com! So glad you guys made it here to AZ. Always good food, friendly people."}
{"text":"Super bad service. Interacted with tom and leah.  We went through the drive through leah was super rude and dropped my husband's debit card onto the concrete. After having to back up, back other cars up and go around we didn't even get a sorry. Then we asked why she did that she shrugged and said my husband slapped it out of her hand. I told her i was right there and saw her talking to her friend instead of paying attention. She rolled her eyes, closed the window and started talking about us to her coworkers. Awesome. We probably got 2 spit sandwiches after that. We asked to speak to a manager and got Tom. Got a half assed apology basically saying sorry if u got ur feelings hurt. We tossed the sandwiches and went somewhere else. Didn't trust they weren't messed with given their complete lack of professionalism. We will never be back."}
{"text":"This place is a ZOO!!!!!!!!!! I'm kind of happy I waited so long after it opened because although it's calmed down greatly, it's still very hectic! Two lines for customers, six registers, everyone yelling, orders being called over a microphone .... it's an interesting experience your first time but those employees have this down pact!  Everything came out tasting fantastic and I was extremely satisfied :)

I had their regular hotdog with everything on it, tried a jumbo chili dog, and shared their cheese fries :)"}
{"text":"I normally get drive thru everytime because it is always soooo crowded! Yes even drive thru but atleast the guys taking your order along the line know what their doing and have the right device to take your order so you don't wait forever.
Their fries.. Just.. Those are enough lol but their hotdogs are awesome and taste so fresh. 
I don't remember what I ordered but there was a bunch of stuff on it like Carmelized onions and diced tomatoes(I don't remember what else) and the hot dog was definitely big enough to hold all those ingredients. 
Good portions, and everything is always so flavorful and hot when you get it!"}
{"text":"Save yourself the aggravation of finding out your order is wrong only after you leave the drive through.  Pass on the cold greasy food. This place is disappointing on every level.  Im a native Chicagoan and a true foodie. I practically grew up on Portillos. I used to RAVE about all their food. I visit the Tempe location about once a week and have done so for a long time hoping it gets better.  It doesn't.  Every single order I get is wrong. Its not occasionally wrong. Its wrong every time.  I pay for double sweet peppers on my beef. I get no peppers.  I ask for no hot peppers on my dog. I get nothing at all on my dog except hot peppers. I pay for cheese sauce and no cup of cheese is in the bag. The receipt verifies they know what I've asked for as I've paid for it.  My French fries are cold and overcooked.  My beef sandwich is greasy and leaks through the bag onto my car seat.  My Italian sausage is bone dry in the bread.  I don't know who is asleep at the wheel but somebody has dropped the ball at this location. It's fast food for crying out loud not rocket science. How hard is it to follow the plan and get it in the bag? Sooo disappointing!"}
{"text":"If I could eat Portillo's cheese fries everyday, I would. They're honestly the best I've ever had. You really can't go wrong with them. They also have awesome chili cheese fries and chili cheese dogs... Can you tell I love cheese? I also love their salads and of course the famous cake shake! The employees are also always very friendly and enthusiastic. Drive thru is super quick! I also love how the restaurant is decorated. I've heard that each one has a different theme to it!"}
{"text":"Fries were cold and the sausage in my sandwich was still pink in the middle. Food was definitely not on par. Won't be coming back"}
{"text":"Always nice to get a taste of the Midwest!

Visited this location on a recent work trip to Phoenix. We enjoyed some Chicago dogs, shakes, and fries. Service was friendly, the space was clean & fun (as they always are), and our food came out hot and tasty. For \"fast\" food, you could do a whole lot worse. This location is near a lot of shopping, as well, so would be a great stop for a day out and about.

Thanks for giving us a taste of home here in AZ, Portillo's!"}
{"text":"Not sure what all the fuss is here - it was good, but I don't understand why they're always so busy.

Got the Chilli Cheese dog (jumbo) this time, and it was good."}
{"text":"If I'm being honest, I'm only here for the wieners! The all beef Chicago style hot dogs are some of the best I've ever had and I keep going back for more! The only other thing I've had off the menu are fries and the chocolate cake and both were great! Service is always friendly and I get my food in a time manner! No complaints here."}
{"text":"Update! 

I changed my review to 5 stars after receiving the best customer service ever. I wrote the complaint department and received wonderful feedback and help. They even sent me a gift card. I went back and tried stuffed cheese ravioli. I am eating it while typing this and man is it good. Thank you for the friendly service. 
________________
Previous review: I am very sadden to write this review. My dad was so excited to take me for lunch here but I was so disappointed in my meal. I ordered to go and had no choice but to eat it. I don't think its an issue with the company but more of how the cooks are trained. I know this is more of a meat eater place and as a vegetarian I was thrilled to read about your grilled veggie, man it sounded SOOOO good. 

When I got to open the sandwich I was so heartbroken at what I saw. The veggies were really over cooked, I honestly couldn't identify two of them. They were soggy, brown, and just not very tasty. The buns were soaked from the overcooked wet veggies it was almost inedible for me. I got through one half and just felt sick. 

A positive was the employees were very friendly and welcoming and the fries were so yummy and crispy. 

I will try this place again but maybe stick with a salad :c"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for the first time tonight and love it.  Very fun atmosphere and great food.  He got the big beef and I had the hot dog (it was loaded with everything,  mustard relish onions tomatoes dill pickles and peppers Oh so good) and the small chili cheese dog also delicious.  We decided we wanted to try the cheese fries and I have to say I've never been to a place that serves you more cheese sauce then you need before and it was hot and not barely warm like most places serve it.  So good.  We can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I solely base the 2 rating on their waste procedures. 

Today I pulled through the Portillo's drive through on my way home from class for a lunch break. I ordered my classic favorites, a Caesar salad and a baked potato. I drove home, ready for lunch! I pulled out my baked potato, and Caesar salad to see a plethora of plastics and paper before me.  Let me first note, the service was incredible, and the food is amazing!!!! they never fail to bring the tasty!!

however, they appear to be extremely wasteful in their to-go wrappings. For my 2 items, I had over 11 pieces of plastic and paper. Maybe there is a way to better wrap these items so their is less of an impact on the environment??? **Most of the products do say they are recycled, but now they might end up in the regular trash! Nice move, but it does create a similar amount of waste....
Save the world Portillo's!! GOOD FOOD & GREEN LIVING! We won't have Portillo's if we don't have Earth!! #conservewastefortaste"}
{"text":"I'm from Chicago and loved portillos! Can't believe I found one here in Phoenix! Absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"Very good Italian Beef sandwiches! Great bread, beef and you must get the hot peppers.  Onion rings are off the hook.  The beef and cheddar croissant is also good. For how busy it gets at times they do a pretty decent job of service.  The price is also great.  The inside of the Tempe location has plenty to look at and it is just a great place to meet up for lunch."}
{"text":"OH EM GEE!!! Who the heck actually goes to a place for a hot dog?  I'm not really a hot dog person, but wow! Their hot dogs are delicious!  I have never tasted bread like that in AZ! It wasn't dry like most bread in AZ. My daughter is addicted and always wants to eat there now. I wouldn't go for the burgers, but I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"It was so loud in the restaurant the cashier had a hard time hearing my order. I had a hard time hearing what she said and had to repeat my self. The cashier was rude. Place was may be 1/3 full. The guy calling out numbers had a hard time location my order and it was hard to hear what numbers he was calling out. Had the beef hot dog. Ive been to Chicago and it vaguely resembled the dog I had IN Chicago. The best part of my meal was the onion rings, diet coke and leaving!"}
{"text":"Reminds me of home! Honestly I was supper excited to see that we were getting a portillos and This is still one of my favorite places to grab a bite"}
{"text":"Every time I go to Chicago, I try to hit Portillos at least once. I was so happy they opened some here. Our first visit to the N. Scottsdale store was so-so. The staff was good and the food as expected, but not impressive. The Tempe store just opened a few weeks ago so my son and I decided to go. We should have gone to Smash burger around the corner. First, the place is on the NE corner of McClintock and Rio Salado. It is NOT really attached to Tempe Marketplace unless you park by the Imports store and walk through the breezeway to the restaurant. if you go, do this, because the parking lot is a total disaster. The lanes are too narrow for two cars to pass each other, so when (not if) somebody ignores the arrows and goes the wrong way, everything gridlocks. If you drive a pickup, don't park there, as it takes a 50 point turn to back out of the narrow spaces. After parking my truck in a spot more sized for for a smart, we walked all the way around the drive thru (which should have been on the other side of the store) and through the patio with too many tables to the line at the cash register. They have two lines, and a nice big easy to read menu on the wall. the problem is, there is a lady standing there that hands you a menu in size 4 font and expects you to figure out what you want before going to the register and while she is suggesting stuff to eat. I was told \" Please step aside while you make your selection, as the lines grow pretty fast. I don't want you to feel rushed.\" Really. At that point I felt rushed, told her so, and after looking behind me to see NOBODY in line but us, I walked up to the register, ordered something quickly without looking at the whole menu, and then stood in the throng of people at the pickup counter waiting for their numbers to be called, because you CAN NOT hear them in the dining room area. I guess they don't want you to get a table until your hands are full of trays of food. I can understand not taking a table while your family waits in line, but once you order, it's fair game. The Chicago Dog was bang-on perfect, the burger, was sort of bland. I'll go back, but only for lunch, and not for a dog or a burger, Teds Hotdogs beats Portillos, and Smashburger and Burger Rehab are the only place to go for a burger in this town. If you're gonna enter a new market, be sure you bring what makes you good at home."}
{"text":"I grabbed the grilled tuna sandwich. The tuna, isn't your typical tuna. More of a grilled slab of spam it seems. Bottom of my bun was really soggy. Overall it was okay, nothing special. My kids burger was pretty good, thick charbroiled burger. Fries don't come with any of the burgers unfortunately. Pretty pricey to feed a few people. Plenty of stuff on the menu and will be back to try again though."}
{"text":"Soooooo good. This Chicago girl was so excited when they opened a Portillo's out in Arizona. I always get the Big Beef dipped with sweet peppers and mozzarella cut in half and large cheese fries! Chocolate cake shake with no syrup! YUM!!!! I haven't had a bad experience yet and I have been here like 10 times already.  Mmmm Chicago food. They really have the best beef sandwiches and hotdogs!"}
{"text":"LOVE their hotdogs!!! I am new to Scottsdale and was staying in a hotel nearby.  A big hotdog fan, I thought I would try it.  I have been back 4 times now.  Their hotdogs are wonderful, WAY better than Costco!!!.

The decor is really cute, food is good, TONS of staff so you never have to wait long for anything.  Their milkshakes are also very good.

You can either sit inside, go through the drive through, or sit on a outside patio. Unfortunately they don't allow dogs on the patio though :(

Highly recommend if you are hotdog fan!!"}
{"text":"Average Bill for 2:  $15-$25

Have been a couple of times now and we are becoming quite the fans.  Here's the run down:

The polish is delish!  We have ordered the Maxwell street polish twice now but have learned that the grilled onions are just a little to much (too large) but otherwise it's grilled perfection.  Next time we're going to try the hot dogs.

Also fries are CRINKLE CUT and crispy.  Highly recommended.

The onion rings are panko breaded and worth a try as well.

We'll definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Ok Hot dog.....not like I remember....brands that move out here should make sure they can do it right.

If you want a nice sausage sandwich (ITALIAN)...do Galileo Bakery about a mile away"}
{"text":"A little piece of heaven in Tempe. Fast service, plenty of seating, and kept clean like Disneyland. Their Italian beef, fries, and chocolate cake shake are all to die for."}
{"text":"I was told by a Chicago native to try this place before they even opened. It has been on my to-try list for over a year and I made it this weekend.
Best hot dog I have had in Phoenix.
Tried a hamburger, fries and onion rings too.
The Jumbo dog was excellent. Juicy without being greasy and I like the Chicago style fixins too. 
The hamburger was great. Not a toasted bun, but everything else was perfect. 
The Fries are awesome. Soft on the inside, crispy on the outside. 
Onion rings were a disappointment in my opinion. Batter to Onion ratio is to high for \"my\" liking.
I will be back."}
{"text":"Great concepts and the foid is delish.  I can see why so many people come here!  I've had a few things from the menu so far and it's great!!"}
{"text":"Interesting spot. The hot beef and cheddar was 4/5. The burger only 2.5/5. Service was rather poor. My husbands food came out late. By the time they fixed it, mine was cold. Tea tasted like it was made a week early (gag). Lastly - the yelp note about cake on your bday is only valid if you log in on their site, then wait a couple days for the coupon to arrive. (Eye roll)

Overall, we probably won't come back."}
{"text":"When Portillos opened in Scottsdale I was beyond thrilled- having grown up in Illinois and frequenting Chicago- this spot is one of my favs. From their Beef and cheddar to their butter soaked cheeseburgers this place takes the cake. Perfect place if you're looking for a quick bite to eat but not wanting to compromise quality. They have salads as well, but from what I'm told these are flown in frozen then thawed- whereas the burgers are fresh. If you're craving something sweet- the chocolate cake is delish too! Perfect for the kiddos as well."}
{"text":"Seriously. If you're not giving this five stars you're doing something wrong here. First off, anyone from Chicago knows this place and the quality of food served. It's cooked to order including the salads which are made in front of you. You don't come here to get diet food either. Everything is great on the menu but my favorites are the hot dog, beef and chopped salad. Of course who can't forget the chocolate cake. Hot dogs have that snap you are looking for and for the love of god, do NOT put ketchup on it. Beef is always enjoyable dipped. Dipped means a nice au jus soaked bun. Soaked enough to enjoy it but not so it's falling apart. Love the cheese fries. Did I mention the chocolate cake? Tons of parking. Super friendly service."}
{"text":"First time here. Was actually headed somewhere else for dinner, but saw this place and did a U-turn. Chili dog was good. Bread was nice and soft. Fries were crispy and salty (YUM). Asked what kind of shakes they had and was not disappointed when I tried their chocolate cake shake. Double YUM! Ordered a tamale, too, but didn't get a chance to eat it since I was stuffed. Will definitely come back here every time I'm in town. Customer service was not bad. Staff seem to be friendly. Thanks for an awesome first time experience!"}
{"text":"Over the last few days, I've eaten here four times.

First, I took my daughter for a late dinner on Tuesday night; then I sprung a friend over at Westminster Retirement for his first Chicago Italian Beef yesterday; then my son on his last night in Scottsdale wanted some comfort food before journeying to California for his new job; and lastly, today we had a UYE with Phoenix Buffet King Rand H, Robyn N, Mike C and his fiancee Jackie R.

Over the last few days I've gotten to know Mike Portillo pretty well.  He's a great guy who is in charge of Training at his family's restaurants and is here working the kitchen with the rest of his employees. Given the crazy opening three months ago, he's done an incredible job! A textbook management case study if you ask me!

The food is still great!  And now, that some our out of town guests have returned to points north, it's easier to get in and out of here. The place today was packed, but with three/four cashiers working, the wait-time was less than ten minutes to get your food. Nice!

Sooooo, if you feel like an Italian Beef, Combo with sausage, or a Chicago \"Red Hot\" stop on by.

Now a shout-out to Nancy P, who is next door at Scottsdale Health waiting to deliver her son and tells me: \"Think my hubby will be spending a lot of time in line here while I'm recovering after our son is born!\"  You hear that Mike!"}
{"text":"Officially a stalker of Portillo's.  Officially.  My friend, who is a Chicagoan, brought me here a couple weeks ago to pop my Chicago Dog cherry.  It was completely and utterly worth the drive!  

I am a fairly plain hot dog type of person...ketchup, mustard, relish, that's it.   But I am one of those when in Rome type folks.  So, I went balls to the wall and got the full on Chicago dog with all the toppings.  Tomatoes. Pickle.  Green relish. Sport peppers. Onions. Steamed poppy seed bun.  BEST HOT DOG EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE!  These aren't anything like stadium hot dogs, Wienerschnitzel dogs, or those hot dogs that have buns that fall apart at family barbeques.  No siree bob.  I only wish I would have ordered two.  They make a mean Arnold Palmer.  Having to wipe the drool off my keyboard here.

I shared an order of their cheese fries with my friend as well.  Their fries are of the crinkle variety and are in no way soggy or lacking in flavor.  Perfectly salty.  Perfectly crispy.   Mmmmm mmmmm goooooood.  I could lick that cup of cheese sauce clean well after the fries are gone too. 

I've already been back for a second trip (only 2 weeks later) and had myself their Italian Beef dipped with hot peppers.  While it was also tasty, I am most definitely a Chicago Dog kind of gal.  This time, I also had their famous chocolate cake.  At first glance, this slice of cake looks like something like that would make the roof of your mouth stick to your tongue.  But it is moist, not too overly sweet, it's perfectly chocolatey, and I didn't even need a glass of milk to go with it.  Apparently, they use mayonnaise in their batter.  

I WILL be back for more and I am completely in trouble if a Portillo's makes its way out to the west valley...but I wouldn't be torn up if it did either."}
{"text":"Really good salads for a fast food restaurant!! Awesome burgers too!! The chili cheese fries are the BEST!!"}
{"text":"I don't quite get the hype here, it's a hot dog. Sure it's not a bad weiner ( I personally prefer TED's ) and it's an interesting experience. But I think it's a bit overrated and the wait was excessively lengthy. Not a bad place for some interesting people watching though. I'll be back, but next time I'm going to try something different."}
{"text":"Went to the Grand Opening last night and that hour/20 minute wait was well worth it! Hands down the best Chicago style Italian Beef Sandwich I have ever had! My husband lived in Chicago for 12 years and was very happy and impressed with the food and service. It is exactly what he remembered. We had a Hot Dog and Chili Cheese dog too! Both excellent, but the Italian Beef Sandwich is what I will be coming back for!!"}
{"text":"Again trying to get a good Italian Beef sandwich. Portillos comes with Chicago creds. Unfortunately their Italian Beef lacked the tasty juice with limited peppers asked for. Though better prices than Luke's restaurant, it was a clear 2nd place when it came to quality of beef, flavor, peppers and wet. Also disappointed that hot dogs were boiled, instead of grilled. Thanks for reading. The Bike Chaplain"}
{"text":"I don't miss the accent but I do miss the hot dogs. It was great to finally get to this Chicago favorite right here in Phoenix. I remember from back in the college days that the proud Chicagoans regularly boasted about their hot dog prowess but most stadiums disappointed me...not so when I would go to Portillo's. More often than not It served as hangover relief and the lifesaving hotdogs still taste great. I had the Polish sausage and those ruffled fries. Salty with plenty of mustard and onions and the ability to take me right back to the ridiculous winters and entertaining summers, Portillo's has great food and a good amount of nostalgia!"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!  Its just about as good as Chicago!!  I'm so glad!

Even the workflow is the same, they take orders before you get to the register and your food is ready in no time.  Its awesome!

PLUS because we're not in Chicago they even have a nice patio area so you can enjoy your food outside!  Pricing's the same too!

SO HAPPY!"}
{"text":"Met up with a friend here yesterday and had a nice Char-dog. 

This Portillo's is located just outside the Tempe Marketplace Mall, on the corner of McClintock and Rio Salado. 

I will warn you now, that parking is a bear and the lot itself was terribly laid out. If you want to park near the entrance, good luck. It's a narrow, dead end that makes it hard for you to turn around and exit. Thankfully the food is typical Portillo's - Great Chicago comfort food! Also lots of Chicago Cubs, Blackhawks and Bulls gear being worn by patrons. Nice!

Four and a half Stars for the food, negative whatever for the parking lot."}
{"text":"Been here several times and will be back many more, I'm sure. We both LOVE Chicago style Vienna Beef Hot dogs (who doesn't?!) and Portillo's is as good as they come. I also crave the Italian sausage & beef sandwich x-tra wet with gravy and hot peppers - mmmm,mmmmm!"}
{"text":"Chicagoland in PHX. Always delicious, always affordable and always a good time. Try the other dishes on the menu for a new experience. I recommend the Halibut Sandwich, Chopped Salad and Grilled Chicken for healthy and flavorful options!"}
{"text":"The worst Italian beef sandwich I have ever had. Tasteless and dry. Not sure about the rest of the food. If you go to an Italian place for Italian beef, it better be good. This was awful. Not going back. For the money they demand for this sandwich I expected something really good. Better take plenty of cash too, it's not cheap."}
{"text":"Horrible, I had the apple walnut chicken salad.  The chicken was rubbery, full of fat, and tasteless.   I had to actually throw it away.  

$7.79, no thanks.   

I wasn't impressed at all, it was lunch hour, only one person in the dining area, dirty tables & full trash cans."}
{"text":"I tried Portillos in California and felt it was somehow better quality. At this location my Chicago dog just tasted kind of \"off.\" I ordered a small chocolate shake and was surprised to get a large chocolate cake shake. Nice surprise with the size but the shake also tasted funky too me and artificial...maybe it was the chocolate cake part? I wouldn't order this one again."}
{"text":"Very good food and pretty darn fast for it being lunch rush. I hope they open more in az it's not very close so not a place we will travel to often to try new things."}
{"text":"Go out of your way to eat here no matter what the wait is. If your going at lunch or dinner time expect a line. They will get you your food quick and it will be worth the wait. Everything, and I mean everything here is good. I've been through their entire menus and you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"I had the beef dog with Italian beef all on one bun as I understand this is a trademark dish. I wasn't terribly impressed and will likely return to try some different things on the menu. Had good flavorS, I just may have ordered the wrong thing for my taste buds that day."}
{"text":"Love the Chicago jumbo dog and garbage salad. Will go back often. Employees are really nice and efficient."}
{"text":"Our last few drive thru orders have been disappointing. Missing food (each time our orders of cake were omitted, even after asking to be sure they were there), cold chicken sandwiches and missing cheese for our cheese fries."}
{"text":"I honestly didn't care for this place in Chicago but I figured I would try it out. Not only did their food suck like usual..they got my order COMPLETELY wrong. Needless to say.. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"We had to run some errands at the Tempe Marketplace, so we decided to stop in for a quick dinner at Portillo's. I have only visited a few Portillo's in IL, so wanted to check out our AZ locations.  This place was packed and I guess because it was during Spring Training...lots of Chicago fans in the house.  We brought our small dog, so my husband and the pup stayed on the patio while I went in and ordered.  I enjoyed a chili cheese hotdog and a side of cheese fries...reasonably priced, efficient service and super tasty food.  I can see why this place is so busy!"}
{"text":"Vegetarians read here!!!!!

It's difficult to give Portillo's a rating because I'm biased.  Like many in AZ, I'm a Chicago transplant.  Portillo's was a staple for me growing up so coming into the restaurant here in AZ feels like going home to a family reunion.
The nostalgia is 5 stars
Food is 3 stars
I'm vegetarian and have been for 20+ years.  I've been eating at Portillo's for that long because they have a delicious grilled veggie sandwich and their fries are my all time favorite.
I was told by an employee this weekend that Portillo's fries are fried in beef fat.  What???!!!  I'm devastated...truly devastated.  After eating at Portillo's most of my 43yrs I don't know if I can go back which makes me sad.  I ate my veggie sandwich without fries this weekend but it was a sad experience.
I will go back on my birthday for the free chocolate cake which is the best in the entire world but no more crinkle cut French fries :("}
{"text":"Well, I've been a few times and it's been pretty good. I love their hot dogs, aside from the fact that their mustard is bland and the only reason you know it's mustard is because it's yellow... But the reason I'm writing is that one of my coworkers and my boss just went and got salads. My boss got the wonton chicken salad without the wontons; not that bad I know, but this was 1/2 an hour after my coworker got a grilled chicken salad with no chicken and no side muffin. Adding this to my own experiences where the Italian Beef was really bland (and yes, I got the peppers and gravy so it was soggy, slimy and bland) and when I ordered cheese fries the cheese was all over the inside of the bag and not in the container, well, I think I'll stick with driving a ways to Uncle Sam's."}
{"text":"First time at Portillo's and I'm a fan. I had an Italian sausage with cheese fries. Reminded me of my childhood. The bread is awesome. Good quality for the price. I look forward to visiting again."}
{"text":"Of course they're getting 5 stars... They're PORTILLO'S!!

I checked out the grand opening, and after a solid wait in line (I'll post pics), I enjoyed some of the best food in Chicago right here in Arizona! I'm completely stoked that Dick decided to open a couple of locations here. 

On the menu for me during their first day was an Italian beef, with hot and sweet peppers, and cheese fries. Their beef is now the leader of the pack in AZ. You'll be hard-pressed to find a better one out here. It's juicy, it's savory, and it's a bit messy (I had that beautiful staff dip mine to really exemplify that latter description). As for the fries, they're perfecto...just like home, and they're even better with a cup of ooey gooey cheese sauce.

If you know me, you know I'm from Chicago. That said, I have to implore that you eat here if you're curious about real Chicago food. Portillo's nailed it in Chi, and they brought their best to the West for your enjoyment! Now all we need is a solid Chicago-style pizza joint to come this way... I'm looking at you, Lou."}
{"text":"Unbelievably horrendous management...waited in line for over 45 minutes to be asked if we knew what our order was at the window after paying... I said yes... do you?!!!

We have loved Portillos for decades, but this visit had us scratching our heads. Is the new ownership going to put this place under?!! I sure hope not. Get your act together please!"}
{"text":"My little piece of home :) I'm originally from Chicago, so ofcourse Portillos is a household name. I've tried several things from the menu, with little faith in mind, but after trying my favorite menu items, I can honestly say, Portillos has done very well bringing this location to Scottsdale. From the food to the customer service, it's all comparable to the locations in Chicago."}
{"text":"Fell in love with the chocolate cake shake, the $2.50 hot dog (with amazing buns!!) And just about everything else you can get on the menu (except the way overpriced salads, but who goes to a hot dog place to get salads anyway, right?!)"}
{"text":"I was so so so excited to try this place.  I was even more excited after it opened and I drove over.  The ambiance is adorable and they have outdoor eating.  Ordered a hot dog, cheese fries and a chocolate cake shake.  The hot dog was fine, I think Costco sells a way better one.  The fries were just okay also, Del Taco blows them away.... the cheese is served in a little cup on the side and that wasn't to great either.  The chocolate cake shake was actually kinda icky.  There was so much cake it was dry and you couldn't drink it through the straw provided.  I actually took it back and asked to try the strawberry instead.  Also not impressed.  I WILL NOT be back."}
{"text":"First of all, anyone posting about salads at Portillo's should stop posting.  Who rates a restaurant on their salads??

And yes there are a lot of Chicagoans who are homesick for foods/establishments from our city.  Because we actually have iconic foods and establishments as opposed to Phoenix.  If you want a good burger avoid  In N Out burgers which are dull and overrated, go to Fat Burger, Greasewood Flats, or San Tan Flats instead.  

Portillo's offers an amazing Chicago style beef sandwiches (although in Chicago Mr. Beef's and Al's are better).  We miss good beef sandwiches, great pizza, great hot dogs.  We're tired of Mexican restaurants which are a dime a dozen.  The only REALLY great Mexican restaurant in the area is The Barrios on 16th and Thomas."}
{"text":"Just the word Portillos makes my mouth water! Oh my gosh their Italian beef French dip is truly the worlds best sandwich I've ever had! I travel a lot and have tried tons of sandwiches but Portillos brings a whole new level to their sandwich game! They have the juiciest thinly sliced beef dip in the best beef sauce then topped with sweet peppers spicy peppers and the best freaking cheese sauce you'll ever have!!! I always order an extra side of cheese for my fries! This place has my heart! I live in California and travel here once a year just for their food!!! Their Chicago dog is the best! This is truly a must have and fall in love with type of place!"}
{"text":"I understand now why they have 3 stars for rating...The drive thru service is AWFUL ,
 I don't know if a \"friend\" of someone was lining on their car behind me the fact is that they got their order before me, and leave before I did or even I get an explanation. And then the person doing line behind me got upset because he didn't have enough space, and honk the clacxson to get out from the line...hello!? Who told you you need to be too close to my car? So we are on a Friday with 100 degrees doing a looong line already and waiting for a while, then hey I don't remember when this place stop being a fast food drive thru? 

I had on my car my 2 little kids, the reason why I choose a fast food drive thru service, one of them sleeping and the other one decided it was time to ask mom to use the \"toilet\" while waiting, and how do I explain to my daughter when she asked why others are leaving and not us if we were first...of course she was right and of course she also had her own priorities at that moment...So Portillos you are very lucky that she hadn't an \"accident\" inside of my car while waiting.

When I complained they told me most likely that order (behind me on the drive thru) was a salad...really? So that give you the right to skip me in line to receive my order? Hey I started to line first, they took my order first.
This a fast food spot I didn't ordered a Pizza! Gosh the hot dogs and hamburger I got must be so special  and unique uh?
Let me tell you they wasn't.

So since when the order of doing line and waiting for your turn disappeared? Sorry I didn't get the memo, 
Noooo an offer for a chocolate cake slice after I complained for the poor costumer service, it's not enough... keep your desserts, I will write my reviews wherever I can."}
{"text":"Try the chocolate cake. It's not what they're known for and you'll hate me after because you'll want it every day but omg is it good. Everything else is great too!"}
{"text":"Yum!!!!!!!!  After a year of living in Phoenix I finally got a taste of Portillo's. 

Looks so much smaller from the outside. I didn't expect this place to be so big inside!  Also around lunch time it is PACKED. The line had about 40-50 people in front of us. Be prepared to stand in line for at least 10-15 minutes and then an additional 10-15 for your food to be prepared. Definitely worth the wait!  Also, the drive thru wait seemed to be just as long since the line was wrapped around to the front of the drive thru entrance. 

I got the beef sandwich. Basically a cheese steak once you put cheese on it. Soooo good!  Will definitely get it again. The steak was juicy and not tough. The sandwich was also filling and well worth it.

For dessert I had the strawberry shortcake. YUM!  Couldn't eat it all after my sandwich so it came home with me for an enjoyable dessert at night. Very yummy. It will not disappoint."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore this place.  It's a block from my work so I frequent this place at least 1-2 times a week.  The atmosphere is fun and makes you feel transported to old time Chicago.  

While this place can get busy at lunch time they know how to handle the crowds and it normally goes pretty quick even if the line is super long.   I recommend ordering ahead on the app as well which makes things go by pretty quick.  

Some of my favorite items are the Combo sandwich(sliced beef with a sausage link), the bacon cheeseburger, their hot dogs and chicken sandwiches are fantastic as well.  I'm not sure I've had something from Portillo's that wasn't good so give just about anything a try!"}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant. Fun environment. GREAT food. Love the Chicago dog with the chocolate cake for dessert. We've been many times and we'll be back many more!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, clean building, and great food. This location can get a bit congested at times, their prices are a tad  high and the Arizona locations do not serve beer like the Illinois locations, This makes me pass when I feel like a beer with my meal.
Four Stars."}
{"text":"Good so far, need to work out the pick up your order section."}
{"text":"Didn't know what all the fuss was about until I went here for a later dinner with my family. It's delish! I shared a hotdog as well as the Italian Beef with peppers on the side. OH MY WORD. It hit the spot. You have to try the Strawberry Shortcake too!!  It's amazing and probably the best I've had (outside of our home.) It's worth the wait. Cook to serve. Relaxed but a tad, o.k., super LOUD!"}
{"text":"Not as good as advertised. I had the Italian Beef sandwich, extra gravy, sweet peppers, mozzarella, and a small order of cheese fries. I expect the quality and flavor of the beef to make or break the sandwich, and unfortunately, it broke the sandwich here. It was bland. Even with the cheese and extra sauce (and peppers), it tasted completely bland. I've had better roast beef from Boar's Head at my local grocer. 

As others have noted, the fries were very salty, but the cheese helped diminish that. I was truly hoping for better, but I'm afraid I was completely let down. I'm staying at a hotel right across the street for the week, so I might give them another shot, but if I do, it will be a hot-dog, and not their Italian Beef, for sure."}
{"text":"Love seeing and tasting Chicago in Phoenix.. I was so upset when I thought I couldn't get Portillos in AZ but my dreams actually came true. Here we are :)"}
{"text":"Just like the ones you've been to in the Chicago area! Great service, atmosphere and outdoor seating is perfect. Both Italian beef and beef and cheddar croissant are perfectly made. Chocolate cake shake makes you wish you weren't diabetic lol"}
{"text":"Ever since they opened this location, we've been coming here regularly. We usually order same things but sometimes we try different things here and there. And so far everything has been really tasty. Italian beef is delicious, onion rings are crunch, and crinkle fries are just perfectly seasoned. Tried a strawberry malt it's really really delicious. Their chocolate cake is the bomb too."}
{"text":"Best lunch you'll ever have. Great atmosphere, music and service. A delightful joint to enjoy TGIF."}
{"text":"So good! Chili Cheese dog and chess fries I always order. They get you in and out of there. Run just like the ones in Chicago I have gone to. Kinda far for me so worth the drive!"}
{"text":"My uncle is from Chicago and has told me about Portillo's for years and I finally had the pleasure in trying them while in Scottsdale AZ. Of Course I had to try the Italian Beef this tender morsel was amazing full of flavor and incredibly juicy. That it was served on a soft croissant was a bonus. I also had to try a Portillo's Hotdog the flavor was very flavorful for a hotdog. Cant wait to come back. The decor was very vibrant and fun. Outside seating was great."}
{"text":"Best Italian beef ever!!! Order dipped with hot and sweet peppers to die for!!!!!  Chicago Classic in Arizona!!!"}
{"text":"If you want a good Italian beef you need to go to portillos!!!  By far best beef we've ever had and my kids loved them too!!  Customer service at the counter was awesome, but the girl handing out the food needs some manners!  Would never give this place less then a five for food but customer services lacks!"}
{"text":"Always consistent and always tasty.  The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars was the wait for the food."}
{"text":"The food is good,  very good. The service is awkward and slow. A must try. Hot dogs are good so is the beef"}
{"text":"Being from Chicago I was waiting for this place to open!  Still love it!  Gotta get the italian beef with lots and lots of hot peppers!  They have yummy crinkle fries if I remember correctly.  I also order some gravy on the side. (basically its au jus the beef is cooked in).  So delicious!  Now that they have been open a while its not as packed as when it first opened."}
{"text":"Portillo's Hot Dogs looks like the love child between a 50's Diner and the Las Vegas Strip.

I don't even like hot dogs but the throngs of people flowing through the doors at noon piqued our curiosity. After some initial disorientation due to the over abundance of signage, we located a paper menu and were pleasantly surprised that most of the menu items were not hotdogs. 

I ordered a broiled chicken sandwich and my husband  chose the Italian roast beef sandwich.  My sandwich was fabulous! The bun was super fresh and there was a moist real chicken breast with some lettuce and tomato on it. The Italian sandwich was loaded with meat which had been soaked in a flavourful au jus. The $5 prices seemed like a bargain for them. 

The sides of fries and onion rings  were nothing special but the apple walnut chicken salad and the chocolate malt are on my list for our next visit. 

Interestingly many of the employees seem to be a couple of generations older than your typical fast food kind of place and they are super friendly and efficient ."}
{"text":"They do One thing right and that's the Italian Beef Sweet peppers. Don't care for anything else on the menu"}
{"text":"A Chicago staple closer to the west coast. We visited from CA and needed to stop in to have a bite to eat. Italian beef sandwich was great and i had the meatball salad and that was very good."}
{"text":"I had the chili dog and it was the best dog ever! Chili was phenomenal. Its huge and clean inside people that work there really nice willing to assist."}
{"text":"2 runs thru the drive thru and 3 times the wrong food. They kept adding cheese to my burger when i kept asking for no cheese. Maybe the cook has cheese instead of brain matter. But i was honestly expecting a lot better than McDlds."}
{"text":"We have been to Portillos in the Chicago area many times & are never disappointed, so when we saw they had one in Scottsdale, we jumped at the chance to go not once, but twice, while we were in the Valley.  
We were not disappointed at all.  We felt like we were back in Chi-town!  The Italian beef was as great as ever, then I saw that they have a \"combo\" sandwich with Italian sausage & beef together!  So I asked my brother who lived in Chicago about this & he said that's all he ever gets!  So we came back a second time & I had that & OMG - it's heavenly!  
I also had their chocolate cake shake!  Maybe it's the \"kid in me\", but it reminded me of when you were having cake & ice cream & you mix them together!
One tip - when you order, hang close to the pick up counter, they DO NOT call order numbers in exact order & it's quite boisterous in there, so you can miss your number (which on the first visit, we did & I'm pretty sure someone took our order).  They quickly made it for us again, but lesson learned, the 2nd time, I stayed close & made sure to grab our order as soon as it came up!"}
{"text":"Stopped by ate a hotdog and picked up some Italian beef. It's good but not as good as Chicago Portillos. Service was great and the place was clean! Aping was a sweetie, sorry for ringing the bell so many times!  Aping joined in and made me laugh even more. Recommend stopping by and having lunch or dinner. Catering is great!"}
{"text":"Always love Portillo's beef and Chicago style hotdogs but while in the area stopped by this location and wanted something different. Tried the lasagne. Not doing that again! Close to 10 bucks with tax I got a bowl with a lump of pasta literally swimming in sauce, I mean it floated! I told the guy I didn't order chili and he just shrugged and pointed to some parmesian sprinkle cheese, as if that would make it authentic. I almost spilled the sauce as I walked to my table asit slopped from side to side. Topping it off; a 2x2 piece of bread with a hardened butter packet. You'd think with all those lovely Italian rolls for the beef, they could spare a little more than the butt. It then dawned on me, this is what they cut off before making their signature Italian beef. Pity! I'd suggest sticking with the signature instead of scribbling something and calling it lasagne. Don't waste your $$$. Get a BIG BEEF and let it dribble down your arms as you delight in its grandeur."}
{"text":"There food is pretty good but their service is absolutely terrible 80% of the time. Recently we went through the drive through while they had workers out there. The guy just comes and stands there staring. No smile, no hello. Just a \"what can I get you\". He did not offer a menu and he stopped us well before we could see the menu. I always feel awkward looking at the menu with them standing there staring at me but its worse when they have zero customer service. I placed my order and he never read it back to me just mumbled something and walked away. The next stop thw girl outside took our payment she was nice. Then we get to the window and qe get handed a drink we did not order. When I told the girl we dis not order a large drink but two small drinks of different flavors. She sighed at me and then said but I already made this drink. And he didn't charge you for that.   I honestly felt like I was interrupting their day by being a customer. Maybe they should send your employees over to Chik fil a for training."}
{"text":"When you arrive you stand in a double-line (assuming that your fellow customers realize this is a double-line) and while standing in line are asked for your order by an employee who writes it on the back of a paper bag and hands it to you.  If you don't finish giving your order to him by the time you reach the end of the line, he'll hand the bag with the half-finished order over to you and you can hand that to the cashier and give her the rest of your order.  Otherwise when you get to the end of the line, you simply hand the paper bag over to the cashier who enters it all in the system and takes your money.  Then you are given a 3 digit order number.

Next you go over to a pick up window (located 25 feet to your left) and wait for your order number to be called.

HOWEVER, if you ordered JUST a salad you need to go to a different pick up window (located 20 feet to your right and behind you) to wait for your order number to be called.

HOWEVER, if you ordered hot food AND a salad in the same order, then you need to wait somewhere between these two pick up windows because the salad will come out of one and the hot food out of the other.

HOWEVER, if you ordered a drink with your salad AND hot food, the drink will appear at the hot food pick up window, while only your salad will appear at the salad pick up window.

HOWEVER, if you ordered only a salad and a drink (no hot food), then both of those items will come out of the salad pick up window.

Got it?  Good.  Because the management assumes that you already know this after you place your order."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Came here with a true Chicagoan which made the experience even better. I now want to go to Chicago for St. Patty's Day next year!

Italian beef, sweet peppers and extra gravy is all I have to say. Fries were okay. Beef is shredded so thinly with the perfect amount of seasoning results in a delicious sandwich.  Would highly recommend or the Italian beef and sausage sandwich. I think I will be craving this from this point on......

Was a little disappointed with the vanilla milkshake we ordered. Not the best."}
{"text":"Portillos is a great place to grab lunch. They offer a variety of food at a good price. I recommend the burgers, but also enjoy the salads and Italian beef."}
{"text":"As a born & raised Chicagoan, I can definitely give it my seal of approval! The italalian beefs are juicy and quite full. The hotdogs have a traditional Chicago taste. I went to the pre-grande opening, so the burgers weren't available. But if they continue being as authentic as the Chicago based locations, they'll be giving Ted's Hotdogs a run for their money! Technically it's considered cheap for a single item, but your average meal is about $13."}
{"text":"Chicago born and raised, and even begin to say how much I love this place!! It even smells like home :-) I'm not a fan of chocolate, but every time I go, I have to order the chocolate-cake-shake!!"}
{"text":"Portillo's is a long time favorite of my dating back to living in Chicago.  I was in Arizona on business and jumped at the opportunity for a great Italian beef sandwich.  The sandwich was excellent, but I was doubly impressed by the shift lead working behind the counter. 

It took a little time for my food to come out but I was okay with it, but Dom apologized for the wait and treated me to a piece of their strawberry cake.  Not only was the cake terrific, but I was truly impressed by Dom's gesture.  I wasn't complaining or upset, yet he did the right thing from a customer service perspective.  

Excellent job Dom, I look forward to seeing again next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I'd go back if I was in a junk food mood but wouldn't go out of my way.  Isn't all junk food about the same? Finding it difficult to discern varying degrees of junk and nuances of grease. It's as good as other Chicago shops I've been too. But they are the original and from Chicago so I guess they get extra points."}
{"text":"I'm not gonna lie, I mean, this place wasn't half bad but there's definitely some room needed for improvement. I'll give it a few months and it'll be an amazing restaurant. But anywho, I went to the new Tempe location, it's super nice (at least from the outside), and I love that there is a drive-thru! The waitresses were really nice and quick and our food came fast so that was awesome. I had the Halibut fish sandwich. I mean, it tasted pretty average. Very similar to a Wendy's fish sandwich. On the downside, it was really messy. Way to much mayo and tartar sauce, I literally couldn't wipe it off with a napkin. But the fries and onion rings were awesome and my boyfriend loved the Italian Beef sandwich with sweet peppers and the breaded chicken on croissant. This place is really cool, I will just give it some time to get itself established :)"}
{"text":"Mmm hot Italian beef, need I say anything else! Hot dogs here are bomb, have not tried anything else. Oh chocolate cake shake is amaze-balls"}
{"text":"To be honest, the place isn't all it's cracked up to be, and for a few reasons. 

1. Everyone here (and by everyone I mean the customers) are SO bitter! Probably because they have to wait in a 30 minute crowd standing shoulder to shoulder with strangers, but seriously. Everyone is so grumpy and has such an attitude! Normal people turn into vultures hunting and pecking for tables, a spot at the ketchup dispensers, or at the registers and do whatever it takes to get what they want, even at the expense of other diners. It makes the experience a little less pleasant. 

2. The whole place seems to lack organization. Not that the restaurant is dirty or disheveled, but the way it is set up doesn't make sense, considering the high volume of people it gets. The line literally wraps around the dining area, and makes it virtually impossible for people to get inside the area where the tables are to find seating. Also, the restaurant is divided into sections. A salad area, a place to order your sandwiches, hot dogs, etc, and then a dessert area. Why can't you just order all at once without having to navigate through crowds of people?

3. The food is just okay. In our party, we ordered the Italian beef sandwich with roasted peppers and mozzarella, a hamburger, side of chicken tenders, cheese fries and regular fries. The sandwich was apparently decent. Not the best my boyfriend has had, but definitely not the worst. The hamburger was also good, but then again, they're not a hamburger joint, and how hard is it to mess up a hamburger. The chicken tenders were something like what you'd find at a Safeway deli. This doesn't mean that they were bad-- they were just average. Not to mention, one of the chicken tenders in the box (each box is a 4-piece) was about the size of a McDonald's chicken nugget, if not smaller. The one thing that caught me was the two orders of fries.. With the cheese fries, you get a normal order of fries with a cup of fake nacho cheese-esque sauce, that you're supposed to dip your fries in or whatever. I would have definitely preferred a cheese that was either melted on top or that had a bit more flavor. And the fries themselves, by looks and taste, were somewhat like the crinkle-cut fries that you'd find in the frozen food section of your local grocer. 

Regardless, they still have a really cute atmosphere/decor: that of a 50's/60's Chicago-style diner, and their staff seems to know most of what they're doing. I would go back because their prices are great ($3.65 for a decent-sized burger), but it would be under the conditions that 1. the weather is nice because it's a 50/50 chance that you'll be sitting outside, and 2. that I have a solid hour, hour and a half to blow considering the line to order and the wait to get your food and then find a table. 

Anyhow, to sum it up: not great, not terrible. Just average."}
{"text":"\"Hi welcome to Portillos!\" Try the salt its great! \"we can even give you a beef sandwich or fries to go with that yummy salt\" while we prepare your tasty salt bombs you can wait ............................over............there, yes by all those other people, listen careful for your number, and please don't sit till we give you your food, no matter how long that's going to take\". 

I couldn't wait for Portillos to open and after lunch today I feel I was duped!!! It wasn't the plentiful and polite staff, or the Disney esque big top meets roadhouse interior, it wasn't what seemed like reasonable prices, or even the hoards of crowds most restaurants only dream of.

Alas it all came down to element number 1, The food. I had a hot dog with everything. This shy dog wasn't too shy with the celery salt, it completely over powered all other flavors. As for the texture of that barker it was so soggy the bun seemed to drip off, and the peppers so tough I had to take them out of my mouth. The pickle on it was far bigger then the frank that just seems like reckless pickling!

My beef sandwich was amongst the worst I have ever had, The meat was dry and mealy, The bread was lame, crunchy on the outside and almost as wet as the dripping hot dog paste bun on the inside. What struck me hardest was the massive dose of SALT!!!! Yikes I even like salt. I couldn't get back in line and wait twenty minutes to try over, so my lunch today hit the trash can!!!!

I may have caught them on a bad day, it was certainly a busy one, but my first try will be my only try. There are better options around town and with less circus!!!"}
{"text":"When I was stationed in Germany I had a buddy from Chicago that would always rave about Portillo's in Chicago. Needless to say this place warrants such praise.

I've had everything from the Italian beef, the burgers, the hot dogs, the cheese fries and shakes. Everything is great, the staff is efficient and work their tails off. 

Walking into this place is like walking back in time, it reminds me of a ballpark blended in with a soda fountain (minus the fountain). There's tons of seating and even though the line will probably be long, it moves quickly. You're also able to watch as your food is prepared, a point they definitely emphasize as a differentiator.

Portillo's, at least this Tempe location, is a top notch fast food restaurant. If the Chicago locations are better then I'll definitely have to try them, because this Tempe location has always been solid for me."}
{"text":"Not like I remember it to be in Chicago, but the char broiled chicken sandwich was still excellent.  I still haven't tried their hotdogs, but their chicken is phenom."}
{"text":"I love this place and I go here all the time. But, the dark haired lady that works the drink fountain is probably the rudest person I've ever met in my life. Any time you ask her for anything she has an attitude about it and rolls her eyes. Don't know why they would keep someone like this employed?"}
{"text":"For the last month or so I've been trying to go to Portillos to see what all the craze is about. However they're always closed earlier than their listed hours.  If you're gonna post you're open until 10pm don't close the drive thru at 9:45. This is not once but FIVE times that I have got off work and tried to swing in at 9:45 and it's already closed down with the drive thru blocked by orange cones. I'm done trying. Being from the Midwest I'm disappointed be caused I was really looking forward to it."}
{"text":"OMG what is this place? And why-oh-why did I discover just as summer in Phoenix is gearing up?

This place is soooo good with amazing customer service. Everything on the menu looks delicious even their salads, but um, so far I haven't \"had a chance\" to try one -- to preoccupied with these delicious hot dogs and ITALIAN BEEF sandwiches. 

Food is super fresh and taste really high quality (for fast food). This is actually the only fast food I will eat. So YUMMMY. 

Seriously. This place even has a drive-thru. 

Most delicious casual lunch/dinner place in the entire North Scottsdale area. A true favorite."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I moved to AZ from Chicago 15 years ago and I missed this place. Try the Beef Sandwich dipped. The Chicago dog is amazing. French fries are perfect. If you care about healthy food, go somewhere else. This is about comfort."}
{"text":"Best and probably the only Italian beef in town. I'm from Chicago and most people around here look at me funny when I mention Italian beef. This is a little drive from my house but well worth the trip. Chocolate cake is also pretty awesome. It gets busy at times but after tasting you can see why."}
{"text":"I have to say that I'm thoroughly impressed with the service and quality of the food here.  Having just opened up here in Tempe, I assumed that when my co-workers and I decided to go here for lunch that we would encounter issues:

- No Parking
- Massive Lines
- Waiting forever for food that would be cold by the time we got it

I was rewarded for my pessimism with parking attendants who directed us right to a parking spot.  The line was long but we all had our food in less than 10 minutes.  The staff was smiling and very helpful.

The food....It was awesome.  I got the Italian Beef with hot peppers and it was phenomenal!  I'm pretty sure I inhaled it without chewing enough it was that good.  Contemplated getting another sandwich but then thought the better of it. 

I will definitely be coming back, but it will be difficult to try the other menu items since the Italian Beef was so good"}
{"text":"Took out of town family to this place, and it was our first time eating there.  The prices were reasonable, and the food was great.  Had everything from salads, to burgers to dessert, and everything we tried was good.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is my first time at Portillo's and having heard wonderful things about it from friends, Chicagoans and non-Chicagoans, I was excited to try it out. I'm going to talk about the experience and then the reason for the 3stars. I arrived at about 7pm so I expected it to be busy. The line was about 40 feet out the door but that didn't bother me since it just recently opened. I ordered a Jumbo Hot Dog, Cheese Fries, and a Vanilla Shake. All in all it took about 40 minutes to wait in line, order, and get my food. Their hot dogs are the talk of the town so when I started eating mine I thought there was something wrong with me. However, the hot dog bun was extremely wet, not with juicy flavor but from water. The water wouldn't have been a problem if it didn't smell and taste like it was just used to wash some dishes. The same went for the hot dog because when I bit into it I got a squirt of that same water and then I gagged and set it down. Other than that, the pickles, peppers, tomato, mustard, and onions were great but I was really disappointed in the hot dog and bun. The fries are AMAZING and the vanilla shake was pretty darn tasty. I'm going to attribute the dishwasher water flavor to the speed with which they made the food because it was really really busy in there so I will be returning in a few weeks when the hype has died down and hopefully it will be better."}
{"text":"Good burger, expected Italian beef to be better. No gardinera, would probably made it better. Good prices for portion size. Plenty of seating inside and out."}
{"text":"Had the Chicago style hotdog, it was good, with all stuff on it, the bun very soft & chewy. Also had the French fries and the mint chocolate chip malt YUM. (I need to try the strawberry shortcake.)
Actually this is my 3rd visit & my 3rd hotdog. I keep bring different friends to this place. It's new to Arizonians."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in our first visit to this establishment. The food was sub par, the roast beef and cheddar croissant had no flavor. 
Secondly every single person who was working there looked like they had just lost their dog. 

I asked for some sauce to put some flavor in the food and the young man Danny who was asked to help made it clear that he did not want to help. When I thanked he was disrespectful so I answered \"your welcome\" for him he just laughed. 

When I asked to speak to the manager the manager Jamie, responded but when I explained what happened I was told \"well I didn't see what happened.\"

{"text":"simply put, this place is just gross.  tasteless food and soggy fries."}
{"text":"Amazing Italian beef sandwich..get the hot peppers.....they do  good job. The Chicago dogs arre real Chicago dogs."}
{"text":"I've now been twice.  I've had the Italian Beef and the Chili Dog both of which I was under the assumption were specialties of the place.  I was....underwhelmed.  The Italian Beef was pretty plan and they charge extra to add anything to it like cheese.  The hot dog was somewhat small and left me wanting more.  

On the positive side the fries are pretty good.  

Overall, I was underwhelmed, especially after all the hype.  Having experienced Portillo's I can say I'm glad I tried it but I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"As a kid, I would often travel to Chicago to visit my grandparents. One of my big treats every time I went was a visit to Portillo's for one of their famous Chicago dogs or Italian beef sandwiches. As I got older, I no longer had a reason to travel to Chicago and was missing my Portillo's. Lo and behold, this Portillo's opened up in Phoenix, not too far from where I now frequently vacation in the spring. I was so excited! So, my last trip down I stopped in. Everything was just how I remembered it. The decor and menu hadn't changed one bit. I ordered one of my old standbys--the Italian beef. That, too, had not changed: tender, shaved beef, dipped in flavorful gravy, on a soft roll, and of course topped with the ever-important giardiniera. Sheer perfection. They even offer a package to-go of their beef and gravy, enough for several Italian beef sandwiches. I love this stuff so much I figured out a way to get it all on the plane so I could have more of my beloved Portillo's at home in Seattle. 

If you're a Chicago transplant, or otherwise just LOVE Chicago-style food like me, this is your place. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Hooray! I don't have to go all the way to Chicago to get Portillo's anymore! 

Fantastic Italian Beef sandwiches, and onion rings for which it's worth driving all the way to Arizona. Go get some!"}
{"text":"I'm not from Chicago so when my friend from Chicago introduced me to this place while having his son's b-day catered, I had to have more!  The hamburgers are great and the fries delicious, simply can't get enough of the fries. The Italian beef well it's awesome!  Since moving away from being close to a Portillo's, I really miss it and need to plan my trip to az around getting some portillo's."}
{"text":"I'm not from Chicago, so I never heard of this place, but was glad to have a good friend from Chicago introduce me.  The hamburgers are great and the fries delicious. I can't get enough of this place. I've started venturing out the hamburger and fries and tried the Italian beef - it's awesome     Can't wait to try more things on the menu.  I need some portillo's!"}

{"text":"Everything here is excellent! If you have never tried an Italian Beef sandwich, this is definitely the place to be!! The best hot dogs too! Salads are freshly prepared in front of you and they have a nice variety. Don't forget your cheese fries, shakes, malt, and burger selection. 
If you do go the takeout route, their drive-thru has two lanes and is always well managed. Staff is always friendly and polite. 
Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Sorry, but I don't agree with the hype here. The food was johnny rocket quality...what's with the crowds? Portillos got our order wrong, asked me to turn off my camera when I was filming (I take 1 second every day for my year video scrapbook), charged for ranch (dumb!), and all for mediocre food. We had the chicken club and italian beef. Add in some fries, some drinks, and a piece of cake = $40. Uh...no? 

They have a sign that basically puts down other restaurants that don't have glass panes peering into their kitchen/prep areas.

Two stars because in general, the staff was very friendly and helpful. I really enjoyed the chocolate cake. The cheese sauce with french fries was good too- same stuff I used to get from the high school cafeteria.

Overall: I like Johnny Rockets better. Same type of food without the crowds."}
{"text":"Food was really average but the vibe of the place makes it worth coming at least once. 

This place is huge! When we walked in it was almost overwhelming on how to order considering  the multiple counters. The restaurant is decorated neon signs and old fashioned coca cola signs for that classic diner look, and it definitely gives it an enjoyable but unique feel. 

I ordered the italian beef and before I even took a bite I had to grab extra napkins because the whole sandwich including the wrapper was drenched in oil. Not the biggest issue for me but I know that can be off putting for some people. The sandwich itself was average, the sliced beef was somewhat bland but thankfully I got the hot peppers which went really well with it. 

I also tried the polish dog and again it was excessively greasy... The sauteed onions were drenched in oil but the sausage itself was pretty good. It had a good snap on the outside and mustard complimented it well. 

If greasy food isn't a problem then Portillo's is worth going to especially for the diner decor and polish dogs."}
{"text":"awesome food. Awesome service. Chocolate cake is the best aywhere"}
{"text":"you call this a hot dog.. yuck    what is Italian beef ??  no such thing in Italy .  they should also treat there employees better too.."}
{"text":"I come from Chicago,wanted to know if it was like the ones in Chicago . Sure was impressed. Taste of food was great . The only difference the wait was to long."}
{"text":"\"Consumer Reports\" rated Portillo's as having the best sub sandwich nationally so I had to try it.  They are a Chicago eatery serving hot dogs and Italian Beef sandwiches.  I have tried both the hot dogs and Italian Beef and both were excellent.  I added a slice of Mozzarella cheese and asked for my sub to be \"dunked\" so it would be extra juicy.  Took my grandson on my second visit and he loved the atmosphere and the tasty Italian Beef sandwich.  I will be back many times."}
{"text":"I'm originally from Chicago and am very familiar with Portillo's. However I'd take Luke's over Portillo's over any day. Luke's has a smaller menu, yet they have better quality food and service. The drive-thru at Portillo's is always a hassle."}
{"text":"So I haven't had the hotdogs but the burger was a hit! Very delicious flavor and I asked for a side of their gravy (sauce) to dip my burger.....gosh I can just drink that stuff it's so good!"}
{"text":"Just say no. This place is awful. They gave me a hard cold croissant and a very chewy hot dog that tasted awful. Do yourself a favor and go anywhere but here."}
{"text":"Busy, busy, busy. 

Go all the way to the back of the restaurant to order along the left side. I'd recommend trying to grab a menu before getting in line, since it's hard to see the one of the board behind the registers while you're waiting. Plus, you don't want to be the old guy holding up the line while you're making your decision at the register. 

After ordering, head to the left to wait for your order number to be called (probably in the form of a rhyme). THEN, you can get a seat. Otherwise, you're the old guy hogging up a table for 6 while people with their food are standing to eat.

The hotdogs are delicious. My boyfriend got the sausage sandwich and loved it. Very tasty place if you can navigate it!"}
{"text":"Food was very good had a dipped beef sandwich and my wife had a polish dog. Everyone was very friendly and you can watch them make your own food. I would come back again they have a big menu and a good selection."}

{"text":"Just horrible, which is really saddening. We are from the Chicago area, and it's not the Portillo's you remember. When they sold out, they went cheap on quality. Lousy Italian sausage, Greek salad was horrible, tonight COLD HOT DOGS. Instead of complaining, we just left and won't be back. We'll tell everyone to do the same. Really sad. Men's bathroom was really dirty, no soap, no paper towels."}
{"text":"I was expecting more out of the food, really bland. The service was like a fast food restraint. long lines for such marginal product"}
{"text":"Love this place! Have never had the same thing twice. Would suggest the Chicago dog of course! But the poppyseed children salad is delicious! Had the breaded chicken sandwich today.!"}
{"text":"Im from the midwest and i was so happy Portillo's are in Phoenix. You cant go wrong with a Chicago Dog or Roast Beef! When we grill out i always stop by if i have time for buns"}
{"text":"Went to Portillos in Chicago and found one nearby. Super beef sandwiches, salads and fabulous hot dogs. Great atmosphere for kids and families. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I remember learning that Portillo's had built their first location in Arizona. I was at the new Cubs Spring Training facility a couple years ago. Logically, it was right down the street.

Prior to Portillo's opening, there were a couple of places that an authentic Chicago Dog could be found. Most everyone else, from the stadium fare to a few festival food vendors, were poor impersonators. I won't bore you with what belongs on a proper Chicago Dog. But I will warn you to keep the ketchup the hell away!

There are many reasons I recommend Portillo's and have enjoyed several meals here with friends and co-workers. The atmosphere is a big plus. It's what I call \"Chicago Eclectic\". You feel as if you're among friends because it's next to impossible to NOT spot someone wearing a Cubs, SOX, Bulls or Blackhawks shirt. Plus, no matter what mood I am in, they have a sandwich or other option that suits me.

On this visit, it was time to revisit an old friend, seen in the photo below. It was delicious! And I believe the onion rings here are among the best anywhere. They are worth the wait!

I've sampled most of the menu and can vouch for the burger (excellent), the beef sandwich (most excellent!), and even the salads (great portions and varieties!). And who would doubt that my sons enjoyed the chili dogs? Portillo's is a great place for the mid-west transplants to feel at home. And in my case, fills the gap in my diet dedicated to some good Chi-Town food!"}
{"text":"Portillo's is now my \"GoTo\" Italian Beef place. There's nothing like hitting this place on a Saturday afternoon with a dipped juicy Italian Beef along with some yummy roasted sweet green peppers nestled along with the beef on a hoagie like roll. Wash that down with a large strawberry shake and consider your day complete. 

Now that the insane crowds from the opening couple of months have subsided, you can have a relaxing meal and actually talk to your companions. My wife is always begging me to go here as well. She loves the grilled chicken and wait for it.....................The Italian Beef dipped with either hot giardiniera or sweet green peppers. That my friends is an intelligent woman. 

So stop checking the menu online and get over to Portillo's for some tasty comfort food."}
{"text":"Very good cheeseburger and hot dog for lunch. Highly recommend! I would suggest to get here for lunch before 1130 to avoid the crowd. It gets crazy busy after 12 pm."}
{"text":"I always see at least one person touching ready to eat food with bare hands. Always the fry cook, and this time the drink guy was manipulating ice spillage back into the bin..bare hands..boo"}
{"text":"The food is great every time. I have gotten the maxwell and beef dog, all good. My wife usually gets the chili cheese dog. Fries are always piping hot and perfectly crispy. They have their soda mixture down pat. The food is flavorful, the fries are hot and the soda sugary! What more could you want? Portillo's is always a sure place to get top notch yummy food if your near by. The only reason I give it 4 stars is because the cashiers can be pretty awkward and make you feel uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Great chopped salad!!  Great beef sandwich and hamburgers and I love the staff and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"This is a fun place to go. My family and I have been to Portillos a few times and have always enjoyed our visit. This time I had the hot beef sandwich. It was so delicious! I chose sweet peppers and added carmilized onions and provolone cheese. It's served on a fresh baked roll. I thoroughly enjoyed this sandwich.  The fries are good. We always get the chocolate cake shake and share it between all 4 of us. It's so yummy! The atmosphere is fun and the employees are nice.  There is a lot to choose from on the menu. I don't remember what sandwich I had the previous time we were there, but it was only ok. Next time we end up there I will be getting the hot beef sandwich again!"}
{"text":"Went here today for the first time. My wife had been here before and did nothing but talk it up. So, I gave in and tried it.
The food was too greasy and when we ordered the fries, I opened the bag and went to grab them out, but instead, I grabbed a line of staples. I brought it up to the manager's attention. I didn't care too much about it, but that could've been dangerous if a child had gotten that bag of fries. But, I've had better food than here. I don't think I'll ever go back."}
{"text":"Food is delicious & you get the feeling you're back home in Chicago. Will fit right in w the Cubs new ball park opening down the street in 2014. Plenty of menu choices for everyone, the portions are generous just not sure how healthy alot of the choices are. But they do have salads and other menu items if your concerned. There is also a drive throu for faster service the inside ordering process is easy and quick, they have multiple lines setup and plenty of people working behind the counter so your food comes out quick."}
{"text":"The Polish dog was very good.  Others in my group thought the hot dogs were better than average, but not the best ever.  They do seem to skimp on the sides a bit.  I'd like to go back to try some of their other offerings."}
{"text":"So good.  We just moved here from Iowa and have eaten at Portillos in Naperville.  This was just as good if not better.  I am usually not a hot dog person, but this place will make you one.  Husband had the Italian Beef.  Loved it.  

The even better part was our family of four was able to eat for $31! It's about a half hour drive for us but well worth it!  We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at this location twice and have never been too impressed, certainly not enough to write a review. However this time around, I can't not voice my concern. I bought a double cheeseburger for lunch and bit into expecting a delicious meal but I was instead greeted by uncooked meat. How do you mess up a burger? I just can't fathom it."}
{"text":"The Chicago dog, onion rings and chicken tenders are amazing!! I would recommend any of those to everyone! The only thing I don't like from there is the chili dog but other than that love Portillos! Oh and the shakes are great too!"}
{"text":"The WIFE and I had dinner with our daughter and boyfriend. Daughter been telling me for a few months on how we need to try this place. Since her boyfriend is from the Chicago area, of course she is going to be bias with this place. Now I had their Beef n Cheddar on a croissant. It's their Italian beef sandwich with cheese on a croissant. Sounded really great, ask for it to be dry!  Sandwich was alright, glad I tried it. Next time I'll have the regular Italian beef sandwich. This sandwich was pretty wet for it to be dry? Wife really enjoyed it, had her favorite. Hot dog w/mustard, shared that with the daughter. She also had their cheeseburger, tasted like a whopper! We all shared a chili cheese fries, daughter did not like it, it was OK with me, but next time need to tell them to hold off the salt! For me, this place is OK. I have had better, but really nothing to complain about. Has a lot of options, and a neat place to visit."}
{"text":"The Italian Beef is great, the Italian Sausage is amazing! Great place to eat and a fun Chicago atmosphere."}
{"text":"I mean is there much better things in life than a Dipped Combo from Portillo's? if there is, it can't be much better. 

I'm actually happy I don't live closer to one of these places, because I would most likely be 500 lbs. 

There service is good, it's always quick, and they do a pretty good job of keeping the place clean."}
{"text":"This is one of the dirtiest restaurants I've ever been to. its nice that they employ ppl who may otherwise not be able to find work, but they still need to actually know how to clean. They wipe tables with dirty rags they dip from time to time into dirty \"sanitized\" water buckets, smearing filth from one place to the next, but the seats are gross, the woodwork is FILTHY the wall tile is gross the condiment station is a toilet. I can't even imagine what under the tables or the chair bottoms must look like if they can't even see past their robotic table wiping. GROSS! If this is the dining room what does the kitchen look like??!"}
{"text":"The reason everyone is flocking to this joint is because it's delicious! You barely wait in line because it's so organized and seemless. Had two dipped beef sandwiches, Chicago dogs, fries, onion rings and a couple of cokes. Service is equal to the food, AMAZING! Always pleased eating here. I try to take pictures of the food but chomp into it to fast!"}
{"text":"Best fast food in the Desert. Feels like being back in Chicago.  Italian beefs and the peppers and a cake shake please."}
{"text":"Really great food! Never takes too long either, I've had my order messed up a few times but the staff was always very polite and assisting. Great place to go for a quick bite with some homies ."}
{"text":"Ive always heard people from Chicago mention this place. They seem to swoon with joy as they reminisce over Italian Beef and Hot dogs from here. I didn't visit this establishment in Chicago because I didn't feel it was going to be worth my time. Jump forward from time and into the present and Im eating Portillo's in Phoenix. I was quite shocked to find they branched out of Illinois, but then again, fast food can go wherever it pleases.   

Let me say that I have seen the amount of widly different reviews for this place. Some bed-wetters were complaining about things that dont even involve the food (such as parking and how the food is wrapped). Some people, based on their pictures, were served some god awful food (the sloppy dogs and burnt ribs were cringe worthy). Im not going to defend an establishment that may not do everything right, but my review only stands for what I had on the day I had it. Otherwise, look closely at what people order or dont order. 

Walking in, I felt like I was this hybrid of modern times meets 1950's Chicago. I almost thought it was realized that was just a setup. It was quite busy and they had a ton of workers buzzing around with all the orders written on the back of the bags. I figured I would go for the Italian Beef and Sausage combo, since several people mentioned it. I got hot peppers and onions with mine, as well as extra gravy (the dipped sandwich idea sounds like soggy bread to me). In some hope of not completely destroying my body, I also ordered a fruit cup that I picked up from a completely different location of the building. I may not understand their system, but it appears to work for them.  

The sandwich was much better than I thought it was gonna be. I knew this place was upscale fast food, but I see now how Chicago natives could get excited over a place like this. The sausage was huge, packed with a meaty, juicy punch in every bite. The italian beef was also moist, although I thought the sausage stood out a little more in flavor. The \"gravy\" only kept the meat taste continuous in the high notes. The veggies had a good burn without feeling overwhelming. The bread is something Im still trying to decipher. Its firm when served without any gravy, but because of the gravy and juices, it gets soft, but not unbearably soggy. I have a feeling this is the style that this bread was made for, but Im so use to having firm bread. This is more of a note on my personal preference, but its worth mentioning. Their fruit cups are a solid choice (they at least appear and feel fresh).  

I was quite pleased with my sandwich here. Its definitely simple in its approach, but satisfies the craving for a meat sandwich. I hope that whoever visits here visits on a good day."}
{"text":"I've eaten here 3 times and it never gets any better. The first time was just to try it out, the 2nd time I had a gift card and the third (and last) time I was with friends that decided to eat here. The place is confusing, noisy with mediocre \"fast food\". My hamburger bun was soggy, the meat had the texture of shoe leather and the fries were cold. I can't understand why it gets so much hype. NEVER AGAIN for me."}
{"text":"I'm going to give this review another try.
My first review of Portillo's got removed by Yelp HQ...something I said about their Italian sausage resembling a d^#k they didn't care for, I guess.

Phallic shaped foods in my book are simply the best.
They're fun to eat.
They're also fun to dangle, pretend suck, angrily bite, and wave around when no-one is looking except your wife. 

Their Italian sausage sandwich is delicious with its hint of fennel and anise flavoring, a must in any good Italian sausage. 
Their all beef hot dog is good too. Nice and flimsy, and long too, good for waving around, signaling your naughty intentions for later. 

The fries, onion rings and shakes are all pretty decent. 
The bill was twenty bucks and I didn't get laid afterward.

She might want to apply for a job at Yelp HQ."}
{"text":"I stopped into this 1950ish themed fast food restaurant on the recommendation on a friend.  Although my meal was basic, a hamburger, fries and coke it was good.  The burger was 1/3 lb., grilled and tasted fresh.  It's my understanding the restaurant is also known for their all beef hot dogs.  The wait staff was pleasant.  It was fun to read the various vintage signs hung around the room."}
{"text":"The food quality is so consistent at Portillo's and the Tempe location is no exception. Went with coworkers and they all really enjoyed it and said they'd be back. I had the Italian sausage sandwich with sweet and hot peppers dipped and it was outstanding. I recommended the combo sandwich to one of the first timers and he loved it. Other great reviews at the table for the beef sandwich, fries, onion rings and chocolate cake shake. \"I don't remember ever having to chew a shake before, but this is awesome!\""}
{"text":"My favorite to go place.... the beef sandwich are my favorite followed by the Chicago style hotdogs.  I've had the bbq ribs and those were tender."}
{"text":"Me and my family of 5 went here for dinner because of the location near the Tempe Marketplace.  I was intrigued by the extensive menu and the reputation of a midwest restaurant chain.  So I ordered the combo beef/char grilled italian dog with peppers.  It tasted nothing special, like something you'd buy at the store and make at home.  I was disappointed there wasn't much more dressing/condiments to choose from.  Peppers or none. Mustard had to be requested and it came from packets so no pump at the napkin/straw station. I did love the soft bread buns they came in though.. My husband ordered the italian sausage and also agreed, nothing special.  My son had the bacon burger and it was greasy but the bun covered the entire patty.  They have crinkle fries and cheese on the side for extra. Ore-Ida probably.  we'd go here again if we were hankering for hot dogs next time.  We think the same of Ted's Hot Dogs down the street, nothing special.  But it could be more special if it were the spices/flavorings. The prices were appropriate and affordable and the ambience is great though. Memorabilia and neon signs and pics of famous people who love the chain. I couldn't believe how busy they were on a Saturday night.  Clean bathrooms for when you're done eating those messy dogs, though!"}
{"text":"OMG this has to be the best fast food ever! I don't really get excited about hot dogs but this was the best hot dog ever. OMG sooooo yummy. Got it with everything and highly recommend. The people who work there are really nice and it has a fun feel to it. Lots and lots of choices. I have to go back again soon to try some of their other things c"}
{"text":"Damn fine for a drive-thru.  I expected the hot dog to be robust, but it was thinner than a typical bar-s hot dog.  They do not skimp on the toppings though, very fine!  The italian beef was better than average, but short of remarkable.  All in all, Damn fine for a drive-thru."}
{"text":"So.. I've now been here twice. My boyfriend is from Chicago and sometimes he craves a little bit of home. Today was his birthday so I picked up Portillo's for him. 

My boyfriend had the beef sandwich with gravy on the side as well as cheese fries with cheese on the side. He said everything was great (as he always does with this place). I had the tamale and jumbo hot dog. The tamales are actually REALLY REALLY good! Oddly enough, they were the tastiest thing by far imo. The hot dog was pretty OK because it was REALLY soggy. Our fries were cold by the time we got to them but at least the cheese was hot. 

This place is getting three stars from me because they messed up my order both times I've been here. This time I drove all the way home, sat down, opened the bag, and searched for my tamale. No tamale to be found. Normally, I'd just count my losses and say forget it but I REALLY wanted my tamale - I really wanted to try it. So I drove back to the location and they gave me an apology and a tamale. Now, it's not that I expect something for \"free\" when mistakes like this happen and maybe I should've checked it before I drove away but I was a touch irritated they didn't offer anything. A soda, perhaps? I know when I worked at Chipotle it was policy to give a free chips and salsa for mistakes and mishaps. 

Overall - I don't love this spot. However, my boyfriend seems to think it's pretty awesome so I'm sure I'll be back. Just make sure you're checking your order before you leave!"}
{"text":"As good as it gets for Italian Beefs in the Valley of the Sun! It's a must try for anyone craving authentic Chicago style food. What to get: Italian Beef add sweet and hot peppers and most importantly their cheese fries. They give you the side of cheese so you can dip or drench your fries at your own pace. Although this is fast food, don't expect to be in and out quick on your lunch break. It's ALWAYS busy!"}
{"text":"It's kind of like In-N-Out for mid-westerners.  Good meal that regional nostalgia sort of inflates.  Does serious  business.  Very good Italian beef."}
{"text":"Bizarre! This place is layed out horribly. It's confusing when you walk in because you don't know where to order. Now they've got neon signs but they are lost amid all the vintage signage. They should have a separate door for catering. They don't. If you order a salad, you must pick up your fries and drink separately! Makes zero sense. 

Plus the place is freezing. There's food on the floor. There's co-workers walking around, cleaning very sloooowly. They don't look thrilled to be there and neither was I. Oh, and it's noisy. I recommend eating outside where you can hear yourself. 

The Mediterranean salad is decent but I'm not dying to return just for that. I can get my Greek fix anywhere."}
{"text":"The Chicago dogs are great, but the onion rings. Oh, the onion rings! I'd go back just for those. Line is always long but it moves fast. Service is quick. Last time I was here, I had the Italian beef...dipped. it was ok. Did I mention the onion rings?"}
{"text":"Such an amazing place 
I will be back to try the hot dogs.
The Italian beef with hot peppers was the best I have had. Thin and tender, it was so juicy and the bread was pleasantly coated and wet but not soggy. They have it down! You can get it dipped in gravy, but for me that equals a few hours extra in the gym. Thanks Mike Weirzbicki for introducing me to your authentic Chicago style restaurant."}
{"text":"Do you need to be from Chicago to understand what makes Portillo's a cult favorite?  Perhaps.  Even so, Portillo's is good.

Portillo's is really big and as crowded as it gets, and it does get crowded, there is always a place to sit.  Lines can be long at times but move swiftly.  The staff is courteous and efficient.  Portillo's is set up with an order counter, a pick up counter and general seating.  The menu is large.  I had the Italian beef sandwich with a generous dunk of gravy.  I was surprised to find the spices I did on the meat; I did get red pepper flakes and wish I would have known as I am allergic.  It was still tasty though.  

Do I crave Portillos'?  No.  Would I make the drive just to go get Portillo's?  No.  Would I eat here again.  Sure, when in the area."}
{"text":"I'm from Chicago and Portillo's is always a pit stop when I head home. I was surprised to see one pop up in Scottsdale while I was visiting. I had the Italian Beef with sweet peppers, onion rings and famous chocolate cake....all of which were exactly like back home. I wish they would open one in Columbus and I would be set.

I asked if they were going to add a Barnelli's and the gal behind the counter said they were waiting to see how well Portillo's did first. Here's to hoping..."}
{"text":"Great Mediterranean salad, awesome hotdog and Italian beef sandwich, but the signature chocolate cake shake was through to roof!"}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant!
Moved here from ILL in 2015, was glad to find a Portillos here in AZ.
Need one opened in the Arrowhead Mall area, could also use a Jamb & Jelly in the same area."}
{"text":"Since moving away from Chicago 15 years ago, I get excited whenever I see a Portillo's outside of Illinois. The restaurant looks exactly the same as those in Chicago? There's lots options on the menu but my go to is the Italian beef with hot peppers (giardinieria) that's been dipped in the gravy. It's wet, messy but oh so delicious. If you add fries and a milk shake you'll probably be downing 3000 to 4000 calories. But you'll be oh so happy! The Chicago style got dogs are great, cheddar beef is a buttery taste sensation."}
{"text":"First time here. My son had the Burger he liked it. I had the Vienna Dog it's was great!! Milk shakes are great! The Fry's ehh nothing special just frozen crinkle cut fry's. Fun place to eat! Will go back and try again."}
{"text":"I noticed that the Polish sausage is grilled and the Vienna dog is steamed or boiled resulting in no snap with the bite.  Toppings were great, sauted onions on the Polish (wow, great flavor due to carmelization) and good chili and melted cheeze on the dog.  Noon on a Monday, place packed but a few tables were available.  Staff gave us a menu and brief lecture about the place and the various foods, nice first time touch.  Prices were reasonable and the portions large.  The place was quite large but clean and friendly.  I will be back to try their halibut and fresh tuna sandwiches!!"}
{"text":"A really fun place to go to reminisce about Chicago.  I get the Italian beef and a hot dog almost every time because the are so ridiculously tasty.   
Try to go at off times because the lines can get really long at times."}
{"text":"The food was 3.5 stars. Presentation needs work. Chocolate cake shake was good, but leftover chocolate cake that builds at the bottom was gross. Used napkins were on the floor. There were a lot of people, but the line moved fast. Employees were very friendly and gave good suggestions. Will update review next time we eat here."}
{"text":"An incredibly impressive establishment. The staff goes above and beyond, the food is simple and well made, and the place is clean and classically cute. 

As pescetarians, we were a little worried about the quality of fish and veggie items at such a popular carnivore joint - so glad we risked it!! 

We ordered the Grilled Tuna sandwich and the Grilled Vegetable sandwich - both great!! These aren't just token non-meat items - they're really tasty!!

The tuna was the perfect drive-thru fish sandwich - tender and yummy, served on a small, fresh bun  (not fried, not gross!!). The veggie was a generous portion on fancy bread - lovely fresh grilled vegetables, Havarti cheese and nothing else! So healthy and tasty! 

The people who work here obviously take pride in providing excellent, friendly service. Door greeting, directions, order taking, etc were great, plus an employee held the garbage can open for us! I kept turning to my husband and saying, \"wow, how can they all be this nice?\"

We're so excited to find such a tasty, healthy bargain right near our gym!! Feeling like we won the lotto :-)"}
{"text":"The food here is great. The drive thru is a mess. On
Many occasions they fail to
Give you a portion of your order. Today it was salad dressing for my salad. How hard is it to check an order to affirm everything is in the bag????? Obviously too much to ask for! Other times it has been a hot dog, chocolate cake extra... This is unacceptable. I have even asked them
To double check only to find out when I get home it's incomplete.,,"}
{"text":"Heard all about the hype from my Chicago friends!

Went in and waited in line behind 1 group for 10 min. 

Ordered with the awkward worker who looked like they didn't know what they were doing.

Finally got their \"world famous\" hot dog and jumbo hot dog. Tasted like a Oscar Mayer hot dog from Safeway that I microwaved for 1 min. Not to mention that my jumbo hot dog was a whopping 1 centimeter longer than the regular hot dog! Cheese fries? Well that's just frozen Safeway fries that were tossed in the oven; served with cheese in a cup...  

Don't waste your time. There's a Whataburger down the street :)"}
{"text":"Maybe it was all of the build up that I had heard prior to going that makes this review 4 stars instead of 5, but all in all it was pretty good... But just that, pretty good.

I had heard so many amazing things about Portillos from all of my Chicago friends that I just expected this place to \"wow me\". Like I said before, it was good... but I was expecting great.

With all the hype on the Italian beefs, which ARE very tasty, the hidden gem for me was their burgers. very flavorful, well cooked and taste like they're cooked over an open flame. I don't know for sure whether they are or not but either way they're a solid order.

It's great when Ted's hotdogs is closed and I feel like a link and fries..."}

I got a hot dog and cheese fries and they tasted really good, but not as flavorful as Chicago Portillos. 

The staff was very friendly and my food was made in a timely fashion.

Overall it was a really great effort to bring Chicago-style food to AZ!"}
{"text":"Always good except once in awhile frys sit too long.  Always packed.  Tastes the same as back home !  Glad they are here now !  I usually get the breaded chicken sandwich, but recently enjoy the burgers.  Taste is great and I try to rotate. Haven't had the beef crossaint in quite sometime but hate that they charge you so much for a tiny cup of extra juice !  60 cents just for 1 slice of American cheese on my chicken sandwich.  Chocolate cake is fantastic .  make sure you sign up to get a free one for your birthday !"}
{"text":"If you would have asked me a year ago, I would have given Portillo's a hands down 5 stars. Their service is quirky, fun, and fast; their menu selection is great and has flare; they seem to always be busy; and their food is always amazing. However, in February, I took my boyfriend here after all of my raving about their Italian sausage, cheese fries, and shakes. When we arrived, we were basically rushed into ordering and he being a first-timer was extremely overwhelmed. I felt bad and the service people did not seem to care as they had people waiting and we did not particularly want to go to the back of the line. He quickly found something and we went on our way. As always, it came out quick, but when we sat down my sandwich was so soggy that I could barely stand to eat it. The bread was not as good as it normally was and I was really disappointed. My boyfriend didn't enjoy it much which I think played into why I wasn't as happy as I normally was. The cheese fries were still amazing (my mom and I agree we could drink the cheese sauce) but the rest was just average. We split a chocolate cake shake, which tasted great but was nearly impossible to drink because of how large the chunks were. 
Basically, I would say, if you haven't been, go! If you have and you continue to have great experiences, keep going. Do not let my review tarnish your opinion. I just want newcomers or people deciding to go or not know that the consistency is lacking. If your first visit is not great, definitely give it another shot! I know I will be back and I will probably inform them if my sandwich is soggy again!!"}
{"text":"I had the maxwell with grilled onions and it was outstanding. And the onion rings are the best. Love this place. I'm so glad you came to scottsdale. What took so long?"}
{"text":"My wife, daughter and I braved the lines and the cold to be here on opening night. We met up with a great group of Yelpers for Georgie's UYE. Thankfully, those aforementioned Yelpers had saved us a spot in the INCREDIBLY long line. I mean, seriously...I think I overhead people speaking of their wait time in hours...plural. That's ridiculous. I don't know that I've ever seen people that excited for a hot dog.

While we waited, we witnessed the amazing employees making their way through the crowds (both in the parking lot waiting to get in, as well as the seemingly endless lines of cars making their way through the drive-thru). Portillo's DEFINITELY has their stuff together when it comes to managing the masses. 

After our sojourn through the crowds, we finally made it inside. By this time, we had already chosen our food, and were just waiting to make it to the register. That gave us quite a bit of time to take in the sights. Now, being that I'm not from Chicago, I had to lean heavily on my great company for authenticity. According to the two greatest kings this city has known, Portillo's definitely gets an A+ in that department. Apparently, each Portillo's has it's own special theme. This one has a 50's retro vibe. After all...retro is cool again. Go figure.

As I've mentioned before, I'm not a HUGE fan of hot dogs. They're alright, they're just not my favorite. My wife and I each got the Supreme dog...which we thought would be...I don't know, supreme, I guess. Ultimately, it was sizable, but for something to be called \"supreme\",  I guess I just expected a lot more. It wasn't much bigger than the Ballpark Franks you can buy at the grocery store. It probably didn't help that my hot dog was on a table next to a GARGANTUAN beef sandwich. Talk about buyer's remorse...but, I digress.

For me, the best part of this place was the dessert. We ordered the Chocolate Cake Shake. I thought it would just be a chocolate shake that magically tasted like chocolate cake. Little did I know, they actually take a piece of some of the richest chocolate cake I've ever tasted, mix it with ice cream, and stir it all up. If ever there was a dessert that made me want to immediately get tested for diabetes, this was it. It was SO thick! I ended up having to eat the last bits of it with a spoon. This shake is definitely a game changer!

If you're a Chicago native (which there seem to be a lot of out here), then you'll undoubtedly love this place. If you're a hot dog enthusiast, you'll probably like it, too. If you don't really like hot dogs, then what are you doing here in the first place?  And if you love an AMAZING chocolate cake shake, then you'll DEFINITELY love it!"}
{"text":"Place is garbadge!!! They required me to show ID to use a signed Master Card. Fortunately, I left my ID at home rather than give this place any money. Manger refused to accept my credit card after I explained to her it is a violation of her credit card terms with Master Card."}
{"text":"Not a fan. Very average burger. Big and greasy. There are a lot of better options for burgers. Nice cold dietcoke. Fries average also. What is good is that the food is fresh.  But maybe I ordered the wrong thing. Next time I will go and have a salad. If I go back."}
{"text":"Honestly you just cannot go wrong with anything on their menu!  Let's just say I love their double cheese burger with onion rings and cheese sauce"}
{"text":"Man, this place is the real deal.  I am not from Chicago, and have never been there (other than time spent at O'Hare, which I'd rather forget) so I wasn't up on what the deal was with Portillo's.  Great hot dogs, and holy cow, chocolate cake shakes?!  This place is packed all the time, and I see why."}
{"text":"Thought I'd give this overly hyped place a try and it FAILED.  Immediately when served the bun was drenched in wetness and it was cold."}
{"text":"The food is always great.  However service this time was horrible.  The young kid taking my order wasnt able to figure change out and was rolling his eyes after i decided on a drink after i placed my order...  very rude

Well you know i will have to charge you for that...  really.    Just rude"}
{"text":"So filthy. The condiment bar was disgusting. The women's bathroom was dirty. The garbage receptacles were dirty. The tables and chairs were covered in crumbs and smeared with ketchup."}
{"text":"I need to explain a few things about this review. You see, I recently lost my mom, and a lot of the memories I have of her in the past few years involve this restaurant. What does that have to do with this place getting 5 stars? Everything.

Mom never liked going into Portillo's. It's busy, a little loud, and kind of hectic. It's a place where families take their kids, and she was in her 80's and getting around with a walker. So this became the place for the rest of us to go when Mom wasn't around. 

Turns out she liked the food just fine, it was just the part about going there she didn't like. Fine, drive-thru it is. It's a very efficient drive-thru. If you come in during the rush they have a brigade to get the order in and cooking so you don't have to wait very long. It's also open late, which comes in handy.

So besides the delicious combo sandwich (Italian sausage & Italian beef), the salads, and everything else I've had there, my lasting memory will be my mother in the ICU across the street grabbing a Portillo's hot dog out of my sister's hand before my sister could unwrap it for her and began chowing down. She hated hospital food, and when we all decided to send her home to hospice the doctor said we could bring her whatever food she wanted. Portillo's was her pick.

Food is love and food brought her joy that day. We lost her several days later. But the look of joy when she bit into that hot dog after 4 days of being in the hospital? That's going to stick with me for awhile."}
{"text":"This is a great place for lunch or dinner that can be casual or you can also have a business chat though it gets pretty noisy inside.

They serve hot dogs, Italian beef and sausage, hamburgers, chicken sandwiches, and even salads here but I always stick to the Italian Beef and Sausage combo. It comes with hot or sweet peppers and gravy (au jus) but you can choose to get it dry or on the side if you prefer. There is a mixture of shredded Italian beef and an Italian sausage all tucked into one roll that is delicious. I meant to get a picture of the sandwich but we dug into our food so quick!

French fries are served hot and are tasty. Sodas come with free refills but you have to go up to the counter and have an employee refill for you. 

The Cake Shake is popular though I've never had it. Think milkshake mixed with a blended piece of chocolate cake. 

Located in Tempe Marketplace so there are many other restaurants around but I choose Portillo's every time I'm here."}
{"text":"This is the place to take people who claim to dislike hot dogs.

It is impossible to dislike a Portillo's hot dog. Every time I am in Scottsdale, I get Portillo's multiple times, usually first thing after I arrive and as a last meal before leaving. I have never had a bad experience there--staff are friendly, service is fast, and food is exceptional. I would highly recommend to any meat eaters."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere. If you are trying to get an Italian Beef to go, order it dry so it's not so soggy by the time you arrive where you're going. Don't pass on the giardiniera!"}
{"text":"Amazing beef on amazing rolls, served with amazing fries and done so by amazing staff. This Portillo's rocks! Never had one bad outing there, and we've been there at least a dozen times."}
{"text":"I had been told these guys are like the In-n-Out of hot dogs. And the hot dogs are good. Everything else sucks, especially the service. The burgers are mediocre at best, the chicken is terrible. And if they make a mistake on your order, they will NOT rectify it. They'll promise you they'll mail you a gift card, but it will never show up. When you check on the status, they'll tell you they'll look into it, but again, thy won't. Save yourself some money and get better food and service at In-n-Out."}
{"text":"I had the new big beef, loaded with all kinds of peppers and dunked in gravy. Salad it's a very good wife had the pecan salad delicious. Definitely more expensive than your average fast food but worth it once in a while. 
Cake Shake will take you down, yummy but heavy."}
{"text":"The combo Is delicious! The char grilled Italian sausage and the Italian beef together is so mouth watering. Prices aren't too bad either. Definitely coming back here!"}
{"text":"Best hot dogs and beef sandwiches..A real taste of Chicago"}
{"text":"I always enjoy going to Portillo's, I can never make up my mind on which delicious food I want to order,

Friday Italian beef combo, with a side of cheese fries, and a delicious root beer,

Our firm always does take out from this location keep up the good work guys"}
{"text":"Yo dawg, this place has hot dogs on hot dogs on hot dogs. It started in Chicago and since I've been to Chicago three times in my life I'm pretty much an expert on all things Chicago like da Bears and da Bulls and da Blackhawks. If you come here you can get a hot dog and a bunch of other stuff but don't be that guy, just get a hot dog. That's what they're famous for, and you don't wanna be that guy."}
{"text":"I tried the polish dog and it was pretty decent. It is a bit expensive when you got to order everything seperate. Maybe I didnt see a combo meal price, but for a hot dog, fries and drink came out to over 8 dollars.  I also was a bit annoyed in the drive thru a employee stands out side to give you your order, which makes it akward when he is talking to you, when all you want is your food and go. It was nice gesture but a bit annoying. I will go back to try other menu items."}
{"text":"They have the best chocolate malt I've ever had.  Wasn't impressed with the italian sausage or the tamale bowl.  But, the malt was amazing!"}
{"text":"Whenever we pick someone up from the airport this is the first place we bring them. Love the burgers and Italian sausage. The French fries are awesome.  Never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"I love getting their large spaghetti with meat sauce to go.  I add in my custom hand ground 4 peppercorn mix at home and toss in the parmesan cheese that comes with it.  So hearty!! Way better than anything at Spaghetti Factory/Warehouse.  It takes me 2-4 times to finish all the spaghetti because I usually like to eat carbs in little snacks.

I also like the Beef Beef sandwich here with hot peppers.  The beef isn't seasoned very well and relies on the french dip (they call it gravy here and pre-soak the bread in it).  It's good but personally would prefer it not pre-soaked which makes it soggy.  

The daily fresh bread that the sandwich is made from is very good.

The hamburgers here are a bit of a let down."}
{"text":"Virtual applause to you Portillo's for handling the masses so efficiently and smoothly! Word spread like wildfire when Portillo's announced that they were coming to Scottsdale. For months, Valley residents from all around waited anxiously for the doors to open. Just recently, Portillo's doors finally opened. Were they ready for the crowds? Yes they most definitely were! 

I've been to Portillo's in Illinois so I knew what I was in for. This Portillo's lives up to its roots. The exterior is bright and welcoming with tables all around. The drive-thru resembles that of an In & Out (in the ordering sense) and the interior reminds me of a 1950's booming diner. Everything is friendly and welcoming about Portillo's, including the staff. I heard that they brought in around 80 Chicago staffers to manage the launch of the Scottsdale opening which was very smart on their part. We visited tonight and although the line was wrapped around the restaurant, we ordered our food and got it within 15 minutes. What's their secret? Complete organization. While we were waiting in line, someone came up and took our order so that by the time we got to the register, all we had to do was hand them our ticket and pay. After that, we got a number and waited for them to call it. Within 5-7 minutes, they called our number and we were ready to feast! 

The food here is really as tasty as people say it is. It's all about the beef, the Italian beef that is. The beef is juicy, tender and flavorful and sits within a soft roll. The fries are delicious and the Chicago dogs are as good as any. I have yet to try the Chopped Salad or the milkshakes but I hear both are extraordinary so I will be ordering them next time. 

All I can say is, believe the hype and pay a visit to Portillo's. It doesn't matter if you've been to one in Illinois or not. Now we have one in Scottsdale and Shea an the 101 is a better place because of it! Welcome to the Valley, Portillo's."}
{"text":"Yeah, 4 stars is about right for Portillos, mostly because I'm just glad to have a local place serving Chicago-style fast food.

The place is run like a machine, with quick ordering, and fast delivery of your food. The prices are on par with other restaurants with similar fare.

I almost always get the same thing, a jumbo dog and fries, but it's consistently good. My only complaint. I grew up eating this kind of food, and miss the famous hand-cut style french fries from Chicago. Their's taste like they are right out of the giant frozen bag.

The place is jumpin, but there's plenty of places to sit, and lots of room for big parties. They also sell their food in bulk so you can have a \"hot-dog\" party at your own house ( :"}
{"text":"Drive past this place and decided to stop by because of all the reviews. We ordered onion rings, chili dog and some kind of polish dog with mustard and grilled onions. Here is our thought on the items:

Onion rings was crispy and delicious with just the right amount of batter 

Chili dog: beans in the chili which is okay but just unexpected 

Polish dog: way too much mustard and grilled onions. I thought it would be diced smaller and cooked. It was mostly raw and had to throw it away. Bun is soggy because of too much mustard.  I took 3 bites and dumped it"}
{"text":"Visited Portillos recently and will say that the Italian beef and sausage sandwich is my favorite sandwich in the world. Bursting with flavor from the sweet and hot peppers.
The service was fantastic and they now have new location in Tempe."}
{"text":"I'm finding it hard to write a review about this Portillo's right now.  I come here a lot and I enjoy their food.  But they are making it hard to enjoy the experience lately.  I work at a local office and it is now impossible to send one person to place orders for all of us because Portillo's will not let you do more than one transaction or put your office mate's order on their credit/debit card.  You can't even do more than one order if you're paying for a 2nd order in cash anymore. I don't understand this at all.  So if everyone in our office wanted Portillo's for lunch, every single one of us would have to leave work and go there to place an order or else one person would have to pay for everyone's order.  In addition to this, today I was going to place an order for a salad so I asked where they are sourcing their romaine from given the current romaine situation.  My answer was an exasperated sigh followed by \"I don't know but it's not from Yuma.\"  Clearly they are getting the question frequently, which is completely understandable, but I don't understand why their staff is not equipped to answer this question.  Where I work there is a cafe and romaine is served and every member of my staff can tell you where our romaine is coming from right now.  And they don't get upset when a customer asks.

I don't know why this particular Portillo's has become less customer friendly over the last few months but I do hope this doesn't continue to be a trend as I do genuinely enjoy their food.  I also hope they find a new supplier for romaine soon because the lettuce on today's salad was in really bad shape."}
{"text":"It is delicious and the salad's are the bomb when it's dipped it taste like they melt in your mouth"}
{"text":"I have not found a hot dog place I have enjoyed this much. The buns were fresh steamed, the dog plump and juicy.  The onion rings crisp and the tea was fresh.  The Arnold Palmer tea was a perfect  mix.  The price was soo affordable.  We 3 ate for under 20 dollars.   We wanted 2nds!! Can't wait to try the whole  menu!!!"}
{"text":"Ever want to know what people from Chicago look like when vacationing in Scottsdale? Well then head on over to Portillo's Hot Dogs and check'em out in all their glory. 

Best hot dog you'll ever have, and it's only $3 for a jumbo. it's only the best if you get everything on it. If you're a plain hot dog eater, go to Costco. Their cheese fries are great, but only get them if you like the fake nacho cheese, cause that's what they put on them. I get my beef sandwich \"dipped\" in gravy, with mozzarella and sweet peppers. You might need a fork and knife, but it's worth it. Skip the chocolate cake shake. IMO, I don't know what the big fuss is over that thing.

Originally they had people from Chicago training the Scottsdale team on how to act like they are from Chicago. Unfortunately, they are (or at least, seem to be) all gone now, so you're left with teenagers trying to pretend like their from Chicago. It's both endearing and awkward. 

The location is great and the play great music. A little nostalgia never hurt anyone. I wish they would allow dogs on the patio like Culver's across the street."}
{"text":"Portillo's- WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ALL MY LIFE?! Oh that's right, Chicago! I am so glad this amazing chain migrated its way to PHX. They have so many different hotdogs, hamburgers, Italian sandwiches to choose from. I got the Jumbo hotdog (minus the peppers-ew) and ate every bite of it. I also got the cheese fries which I liked that they put the cheese on the side- that way the ooey gooey delicious cheese could be evenly distributed on each individual fry. We actually had to get more fries so we could finish the cheese in it's entirety. I warn you people, if you go to Portillo's, prepare to become an addict and wanting it all the time. I plan on going back tonight."}
{"text":"I like Portillo's. My hubby likes Portillo's. Anybody we take to Portillo's likes Portillo's. 

A trip to Portillo's is a 45 minute drive for us. We always order the same thing: for me it is the Italian beef with gravy on the side and for hubby it is two of whatever hot dogs strike his fancy, two drinks, a piece of chocolate cake to share and two forks.

I had my choice of places to celebrate my ## birthday last year and I chose Portillo's because you just can't beat their chocolate cake.

The only thing that could make Portillo's better is if they would open up a store in the West Valley."}
{"text":"First things first:  you go to Portillo's for the Italian beef, hot dog or chocolate cake shake.  If you are not from Chicago, this is something you need to know.  I've read some reviews by people who claim they don't understand the hype - don't order a salad! (Their chop salad is, however, delicious)

You gotta get the beef dipped with sweet peppers.  Some go for cheese, but honestly I think that just takes away from the amazingness of the beef itself.  I guess I'm pretty simple. 

A helpful tip to avoid the crazy crowd:  go right when they open!  That's what we did and it was easy breezy and quiet.  Late \"breakfast\" or an early lunch - if you don't want to wait it out in the long lines, get there as early as possible.  We got there at 11am and it was getting pretty crowded by 11:30. It's worth it.

Having a Portillo's here means one less thing on my To-Do list when I go home to visit!
Love it!"}
{"text":"WOW! The best beef sandwich these lips have ever tasted. I ordered a beef sandwhich w/ hot peppers, a hotdog w/ everything, & a chocolate cake shake. The prices are very reasonable & like others have said the employees busted *ss today. I will definatly be back w/ a bunch of friends. YUM."}
{"text":"Delicious Italian beef sandwiches! Had mine \"wet\" with peppers. Very delicious so would definitely be going there again the next time in the area."}
{"text":"Love the poppy seed salad and my daughter eat all her chicken parmesean.  First time here, trying to get the most of our lunch but Mary Ellen at the register was a bit impatient with us, sad because there wasnt anybody behind us to rushed. The pick up guy is great."}
{"text":"Italian beef was the worst ever...so fatty I threw it out in disgust. I'd never go back. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"The food was great. I played it safe with a chicken sandwich and onion rings but next time I'm all in on the Italian beef!"}
{"text":"Love Love Love! I love hot dogs, so ideally I like their hotdog with all the trimmings! B likes the hotdog and the Italian beef. We've also had the chicken sandwich which is pretty good. For fast food and a taste for Chicago in AZ, this place is great."}
{"text":"Why is America getting fatter?  Why is Portillo's busy? Answer one question and you probably answer the other. 

I stood in a long line, placed my order, endured endless number-calling (\"54, your order is ready ...\"), sat on an uncomfortable chair, ate food straight from the wrapper, listened to more relentless number calling, suffered without a cold beer to make everything seem better (no alcohol license!), then dumped a massive amount of waste into the garbage (this place is as green as a polystyrene factory - if the order is not 'to go', could they not place the food on a plate?!).  

My Italian sausage was edible, the fries were OK. My partner's sandwich was disgusting - wet, disintegrating bread. I got home and for several hours my stomach was in shock ... I probably had more salt that night than in the week preceding! 

Why, oh why, is this place so popular?  I mean, sure, the competition in the 'hood is Red Robin, Applebees, and Mimi's Cafe - three establishments fighting for the bottom of the barrel spot - but still ... long lines ... for this?!  

I am glad to see a good source of employment for the local retirees who work there, but other than that - not for me!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner last night with the wife, daughter and sister.  Been wanting to come here since they opened but wanted to wait til they slowed down.  What better time in Scottsdale but a muggy August night. Now this place started literally 3 miles where I grew up (Elmhurst, Il) so I new what to expect.  Really impressed by the wide open restaurant.  Food was as I remembered. The only complaint I have is if you order a salad it comes out in a totally different location then the rest of the deliciousness.  Where is the soda machine for refills?  Didn't want to go up and ask for a refill for 2 reasons: would have been disappointed if they said they charged and I was going home to drink Sierra Nevada. Also,they need to be more attentive to the restroom, no paper towels but they had an environmentally caring jet driven hand blower that got the job done."}
{"text":"Well let me start by saying the location is more than a notion being located right of the Expressway and at the Corner of 90th and Shea. Traffic is going to a nightmare and getting out of there is going to be an even bigger nightmare especially on weekends...you can count on it. However with all of that being said it is definitely worth the trouble. This was the second opening day event I went to today (First being Krispy Kreme which I will review later) and I have to say the owners of this establishment  \"NAILED IT\"....wohoooo. I don't miss many things about Chicago during the 10 years I stayed there....but Portillo's was definitely one of them. The chopped salad was in a word DELICIOUS and I was hoping it would be the same way here in AZ. After waiting for a year for this place to open I was not disappointed. The staff was awesome....the drive-thru was fully staffed and not a single person was waiting out there. The outdoor seating is a bit close to the entrance and right next to the drive thru lane so they might want to look into other options with that.

Back to the Chopped Salad.....as I said before just like in Chicago.....they NAILED IT. However the lady that was making them today seem to have trouble with special orders. I ordered 2 chopped salads one with no bacon.....and one with no cheese....she managed to mess that up REALLY. I didn't hold that against her or the establishment because it was opening day...but if it happens in the future they will lose a star on this review. The prices were also dead on and the establishment itself made me feel like I was in Chicago for at least a few minutes anyway. I think the people that moved here from Chicago like myself will be very pleased and for the newbies.....well I think their dining options will change once they visit Portillo's.

Warning....Warning....Warning....to Chili's......Applebee's .....Mimi's Cafe....Quiznos and Culver's......there is a new kid on the Block and it's name is PORTILLO'S....WATCH OUT....WOHOOOO. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!!"}
{"text":"Used to love going to this place until I ordered a beef dipped with hot.. Got home .. Took a bite and had a long piece of hair... At this point I was already at home and called a manager there. They agreed to give me a new sandwich but at this point I lost my appetite. Please focus on the quality , not quantity !!!!!"}
{"text":"This is nothing like the Portillo's in Chicago. They try to be the same but something is missing, everything is just a little off. It's not terrible, but there are plenty of smaller mom and pop places around town that you can get better Chicago style food from. If you are in a hurry and there is no line, then go for it but you won't be impressed, especially if you've been to a Portillo's in Chicago."}
{"text":"Burgers are suprisingly good for a hot dog place. Chocolate cake shake is amazing but I wish it was smaller but great for sharing. Lots of tables and nice outdoor dining area. Parking is not difficult. Staff is friendly and competent. Boyfriend and kids live this place. Lots of choices so good for a family who all want something different. Also has good salad choices. Onion rings are killer."}
{"text":"Being from Chicago, Portillos has been a family favorite for years and years. Thankfully, this location doesn't disappoint! Obviously not quite the same as Portillos in Chicago, but still pretty awesome. 
I love the old-timey feel of Portillos, totally makes the experience of dining here better. The staff is always friendly too, I have only had fantastic service here, they have never disappointed. Being a vegetarian, I can't really comment on all of the things they are known for..but my family loves the different meat dishes they have to offer. I usually go for the veggie sandwich or a salad. When I went the other week I got a Mediterranean salad with no chicken and it was delicious! A little too much dressing, but otherwise really good. Came with soft tasty bread too, yum! Of course we always get the French fries too every time we come, that crinkle cut is soo good! Not too crispy, not too mushy, just right. The fact that this place is usually quite busy says a lot, it is awesome!"}
{"text":"Since my last name is Portillo, I have always been asked by friends if my family owns this restaurant. Unfortunately,  I can't say yes! So, while visiting Scottsdale for the weekend, we had the pleasure of finally trying this famous restaurant.  It was an amazing experience to say the least! The restaurant was clean, full of timeless memorabilia, friendly employees, and phenomenal food! The hotdogs,  burgers, and fries definitely lived up to all the hype! They should expand this restaurant to San Diego!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food at excellent prices, service that is amazing. Restaurant experience without having to deal with and tip a waiter. Almost everything on the menu is above average, and the quality is easy to taste and appreciate. Hotdogs are great, and the best strawberry milkshake I've ever had!"}
{"text":"I had bought into the hype about the hot dog's from this place, so expectations were high. I had the chili cheese dog and it may be the best one I have ever had. I had a rare craving for one and it lived up to the hype. It is work the stop if you are looking for a great Dog!"}
{"text":"I love this place. great food and the best cake shake! the service is great and I love going there!"}
{"text":"Brings back memories of eating at Portillo's and other beef/hotdog places in Chicago and Phoenix as a kid. Love it! Can't go wrong with a char dog. It will take a little longer, but worth it. The beef, double dipped, is fantastic, as is their chocolate cake."}
{"text":"I've heard a lot of really good things about this place but every time I come by, it's always too packed to try.  My co-worker and I noticed the drive-thru line only had 2 cars during lunch rush so we jumped at the chance to check it out.  To my amazement they had someone outside taking orders, at noon, in the hottest state in the country during the hottest month of the year with no shade.  After we turned the corner we saw a second person standing next to the menu and speaker box collecting money, again no shade or water in sight.  I was completely appalled by Portillo's inhumane treatment of their staff.  I wouldn't treat a dog like this and especially not an employee providing a service for me.  I understand that there are jobs which require individuals to work outside under the extreme conditions of an Arizona summer but the drive-thru line of a fast food restaurant isn't one of them.  So what if your customers have to sit and wait in their air conditioned car a few minutes longer for their fast food, it's no excuse to make two human beings stand outside in 110 degree heat when you have a functioning speaker box and two windows to pass money and food.

As for the food, my co-worker enjoyed his dog but my burger was in styrofoam which is well known to trap moisture so my bun was soggy and my burger fell apart."}
{"text":"Did not disappoint my memories of what Portillo's tasted like as a child. I love the hot tamales. Very busy but they have a good system to keep the lines moving. Restaurant is very clean and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"It's not nearly as good as before. I'm only referring to their most popular sandwich. The Italian Beef. It seems since the new ownership took over the quality went down. You know. The bottom line really matters."}
{"text":"Meh.  I'm not a big shake guy - but had heard rave reviews of their hot dogs.  I won't elaborate, but will say I was just underwhelmed in almost every way.  I did not feel the snap of the real casing on the dog itself, the toppings were sparse, the bun was soggy (probably from the dog that came out of the steamer) and it was just not impressive.  So I suppose if you are crazy about chocolate cake, you might want to ignore this review.  But if you're going for the dawgs, just don't bother - you can do better."}
{"text":"Normally I have enjoyed coming to Portillo's but an old problem I had before surfaced.  I ordered a hotdog with no orders in front of me.  It took more than 5 minutes to make one hotdog.  Again no orders in front of me.  Oh by the way they do not have blue cheese dressing for their salads.  Who does not have blue cheese dressing with 12 salads on the menu?  Pretty poor.  Guess I will have to reconsider coming here in the future."}
{"text":"Love the food here!! Best Chicago dogs I've ever had and will continue to come back for their food. One thing I don't like though is when I order 4 jumbo hotdogs, they always have to announce to the whole restaurant on the speaker or by yelling it to the staff to see if they have any, every time. Other than that this place is great!"}
{"text":"I love this place!! Burgers dogs fresh salads and my favorite the Italian beef with peppers on the side!! Crinkle cut fries!! Don't forget to get a side of melted cheese for the fries. Yumm Yumm Yumm"}
{"text":"Very good as expected.  Just like the ones in Chicago.  Great beef sandeiches."}

(Lyrics - Lady Gaga - Alejandro)

Portillos is now a chain around the nation, but its origin is very simple back in Chicago.  Seems like all my Chi-town peeps love this place and can't get enough of it.  I always joke why this place has all the hype is because Chi-town folks have big mouths!  LOL -- gotta love my Chicago peeps!  

Needless to say, this place is slamming with patrons salivating to get a taste of a Chicago style hotdog!  The place itself has nostalgic signs hanging from the ceiling and walls.  I gather these are all old school Chicago neighborhoods or Chicago based signage; along with some vintage photography.  Not too easy on the eyes, but whatever!

I ordered the Chicago Style dog of course along with some cheese fries and onion rings.  I also had a taste of their Polish dog too.  I thought the Polish dog was okay at best.  It was just grilled onions on a polish dog and bread -- um okay.  The Chicago style is always my favorite.  Pickles, tomatoes, onions, jalapenos and a hot dog.  You thought I was gonna sing the Big Mac song didn't you!?  Truthfully, I thought the hot dog was okay at best.  I think it was over hyped and you can get this \"Chicago Style\" hot dog anywhere in the valley that sells \"Chicago Style\" hot dogs.  I think it's say that this place was the talk of the town when it first opened and sadly it didn't deliver!  It's like watch Transformer 2 and 3 -- what the heck happened!? 

At the end of the day, I think if you haven't experienced it yet, then I would recommend this place.  However, you're if you're expecting miracles in your palates and the site of a food deity, then please pass on by cause it's not your religion. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Woe! Woe, wait just a minute!  Hold onto your hats cowboys/girls, this Portillo's is the real deal!  It's worthiness is much greater than some of the 3 star reviews I'm reading on the Yelp iPad-acus.  I've been here now 3 times (Yes, I missed a checkin for you fact seeking yelp nerds) and this is the Portillo's I've grown to love when traveling to Chicago many time over the years.  

This Portillo's reminds me of the one in Dekalb IL.  The decor, shape and  size are very similar.  The food taste just as good as well!  The only thing different are the droves of people trying to go here for a bite to eat all at the same time!!  But don't let that stop you from giving this Portillo's a try!  It's a fantastic place to go for a delicious hot Italian roast beef sandwich dry, dipped or wet!  Their hotdogs are great and so are their salads (believe it or not :-) 

 If your feeling adventurous and hungry, I must warn you this can NOT be good for your health but it is really tasty good, try their Italian roast beef and grilled sausage with peppers!  OH MY!  It is an extremely dangerous and yet delicious mouth full of goodness!  You'll be tempted to order one of their DELISH shakes and a side of fries with this, but don't unless you are eating with someone that can call the paramedics in case you get a carb overload... 

The only downer about Portillo's is how they want you to wait at the counter to get your food before sitting down.  This is not how the AZ peeps like to do things.  So they should adjust to their new environment and come up with a better way to get people their food. 

In looking forward to going back again real soon.  I hope to see you their!"}
{"text":"I came in with a buddy (who has a service dog) & was harassed by multiple of the employee's even though he has proper documentation. Not to mention the dog was not bothering anybody & was very calm & well bahaved. It was an ordeal!! Waaay less likely to go to this Portillo's ever again."}
{"text":"This is one restaurant I feel doesn't live up to the hype. I've been there twice now. The first time I ordered a cheeseburger and it was okay. I did enjoy how they call out orders in rhyme and the look of the place. 

On my second visit, I tried out their big beef sandwich I saw advertised all over the building and my wife ordered one of their famous dogs. First of all, the lady taking our order had poor customer service skills. I simply asked if it came with or if I could order sweet onion sauce or any kind of sauce that would go well with my beef sandwich. She looked at me as if I was crazy for asking before telling me no such thing exists there. The sandwich itself was large but lacked any sort of real flavor, and the bun was soggy and dripping all over. My wife was equally disappointed in her hot dog, saying that it was smaller and not even as tastey as the $1 hot dogs at the local QT. 

Needless to say, neither of us are in any hurry to return."}
{"text":"The KING ! A true Chicago style fast food place with Italian beef ,Italian sausage sandwiches , Polish sausage and Chicago style hot dogs and tamales,great shakes. My favorite the BIG Beef dipped with hot peppers to die for. Avoid the cake shake too thick to drink, odd mixture. French fries are marginal at best.Salads are good.When you ask for water they give you a tiny cup.Prices are a wee bit high..Fun 1960's atmosphere.Large place often packed.Weird parking lot.Family friendly.Patio dining is okay.Long lines in drive up.The wrong place to go if you are on a serious diet.
I go about twice a month.Sandwiches are ten times better than those awful Jersey Mikes or Subways.The best fast food restaurant in the Phoenix area !!! 
Another location on Shea ave in N Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I don't get it. It's a lame hotdog in a soggy bun with annoying seeds. It also had neon green relish that had next to no flavor. I ate it because I was hungry and on the way to the bar. But otherwise I would never come back. We also ordered fries which look like the frozen Oreida kind you get in the super market and make at home. They even have the nerve to charge you for ranch dressing for the french fries! Nuts! 

Not returning."}
{"text":"Good beef samich... And hawt dogs are very good. Prices are not in our favor...."}
{"text":"Went there saturday night at 10p. A complete disaster. My son took a burger, the name seems to be burger. Meat probably cooked around last christmas, no taste. I took the jumbo cheese chili hot dog. It is served in cartboard, melted with paper. The size is around 3 inches. So i can t imagine the size of a regular hotdog...need probably a microscope to see it. No condiments available. Everything ws already shut down 30 minutes before the closure. Wanted 2 beers, the blond one. No more, of course. Everything is served in paper, no plates, just jumbo trays with 4 big holes, gokd if you have a swimming pool and 3 other friends, so you can share the tray. Oh, i forgot, my daughter took fries with cheese. Surprise, it comes with fries in a paper bag....and a container witb \"cheese melted\", doesnt taste cheese, more car oil. Disgusting. Any fast food put the cheese on the top of the fries and under the grill. It was probably 55f inside the place. So you better hurry to eat your \"food\" and go back home....if your survive to that experience. Don t go there, never, even with your best ennemy"}
{"text":"A happy taste of Chicago in my mouth!  As far as I'm concerned it's the best Italian Beef sandwich in AZ.  I always get it dipped with hot peppers and I'm a happy girl.  Their combo with beef and sausage is also great.  They serve Chicago hot dogs the way I remember back home.  Even their cheese sauce for the fries tastes like cheese and not the regular canned toxic cheese.

Yes, the place is loud, yes the place gets crowded.  But I don't care - it's a happy reminder of home for me.

Can't wait until they open their Tempe Marketplace location closer to where I live!"}
{"text":"First time eating here and I am not impressed. My son order a hamburger and the bread was soggy the meat had no taste, my husband order one too and he said the same. I order the croissant chicken no taste. I liked the fries and the tamales. The staff was confused and un friendly it was a Sunday night and there was slot if people but they should be use to a big crowd."}
{"text":"LOVED the Chicago Dog! LOVED it!  I mean the neon green relish, peppers, pickles, tomatoes, etc...perfect! And then the cake...the chocolate cake.  SUPER moist and should be shared!"}
{"text":"The hotdogs are delicious! Comes with all the fixings like relish, tomatoes, pickles, pepper, etc. You can also get the polish sausage Chicago style too! Basically, it replaces the hotdog with a sausage. I just eat everything altogether... even the long pickle. Trust me, it's more delicious that way.

I can see why this place is packed. There are lines and it may seem crowded at times, but it's pretty quick to place an order and get your food.

The tamale was also piping hot and very delicious. Loved it. Didn't expect this place to serve it but it does. And it's pretty cheap.

The burger was ok. Just your normal burger. I mean, this is a hotdog place, in my opinion. So order hotdogs. I haven't tried the salads yet but very soon, I will!"}
{"text":"Ate a few hotdogs from this location. Same as the one in Tempe. So that's good!

Amazing menu with Chicago style food. The service is decently fast but I think it's the taste that matters at Portillos. Still haven't tried the entire menu. I have tried hotdogs, tamales, and sausages. Still debating if I want to try their salads and fancy burgers. Somehow, I associate this place with hotdogs.

Anyway, it's not healthy. At least the hotdogs and sausages but extremely delicious! If you are looking for fast food, this is the place. Skip the other chains."}
{"text":"As I left Cubs spring training, there in the distance, a vision of beautiful splendor appeared like a mirage in the desert heat. The restaurant I'd loved in Chicago had followed my team to Arizona. 

Like Joliet Jake seeing the light, I proclaimed \"The Italian beef!\" and subsequently sent my rental car into a Blues Mobile like Mission From God.

Extra gravy, hot peppers, & a hot dog  (the only way they serve it is Chicago Style) made my day. 

It's no 4 fried chickens and a Coke. It's better. It's heaven on a bun. It's what world peace would taste like. 

A chocolate cake shake completed my feast of all things right in the world & restored my faith in humanity."}
{"text":"Chili dog and chocolate cake shake is what you should get your first time here amazing"}
{"text":"Chili dog and chocolate cake shake is the way to go here. Super fast service and it has a drive thru as well. Big restaurant including outdoor seating. I will be returning to this place."}
{"text":"Had the Italian beef and maxwell polish sausage, plus fries and a malt.  Nothing to complain about - both were decent and exactly what I was expecting when we rolled into this place.  Will probably be back to try the beef with cheddar - the plain one is good but felt like something was missing."}
{"text":"Wow!!!! What a great place. It made me feel like I was in Chicago. The way they call you up to get your food is just so original. The best hotdogs in Scottsdale. Come here!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I had a hotdog it was over the top. My Italian beef was cold and the beef must have been the last. Service was fast and friendly. I was just a little disappointed this time. I wasn't in the mood to get it corrected but I'm sure they would have."}
{"text":"It was a great first experience! Me and my fiancÃ© loved the food. It was kinda loud but we loved it too. It was different than most places we've been too, which is a good thing. We will definitely recommend this place and go again!"}
{"text":"Very good.  My Italian beef, chili cheese fries and soda were perfect.  It's amazing how they can serve so many people so quickly.  Kurt Warner was waiting in line like everyone else when I was there tonight."}
{"text":"Food was great as usual. The real high note happened when we discovered our car had a flat. The manager came out to assist with changing the tire, got us directions to a tire repair shop, and gave us a round of desserts for our kids. Oh and the chocolate cake shake was worth the drive from Goodyear!!"}
{"text":"Great Italian Beef.  NOT as good as Al's Beef, but still great nonetheless. I like this Tempe location; great vibe and spacious. Great music too. Next time I'll try the Chicago Dog and chocolate cake shake."}
{"text":"04/2016 still got flies in all the windows. I emailed their corporate and they replied that flies are allowed in the reastruant and they can not kill them... WHAT? It's ok they are still alive and flying. It will be 1 note year until I photo the flies again."}
{"text":"I love Portillo's. Great Italian Beef. Dogs etc. Have to check your order carefully as they do make mistakes. Sometimes their quality control/portion control is a bit off...Beef sandiwiches are usually stuffed and flowing over...on occasion..they can be skimpy..staff is usually helpful and polite and responsive."}
{"text":"The place is packed. Disorganization is rampant. The hot dogs were tasteless and cold.I honestly think they forgot to cook the hot dog as it was COLD~ not room temperature! ( I was nauseous later that day.)  They had another order mixed with ours so we had extra which we threw out. .Total chaos inside. There are several lines for ordering food, paying the cashier and then everyone waits for the order to be called. It is like a cattle call. There is no orderly flow from one to another. People have to push there way through in order to pick up their order which bottle necks at one point   I can not understand the hype.Positively there is not much to say except they have interesting   menus and atmosphere (signage etc). . In summary, this place has built up an image from its past. Can people be so desperate to wait for mediocre food, crowded conditions and total chaos?  Perhaps not all Portillos are run the same? I would skip this joint. I give it an \"F!\" Unless they clean up their act, I honestly don't see how this place can make it in the long run. I don't think Scottsdale people will in the long run tolerate this substandard establishment. I tried it out of curiosity and hype. Once was plenty. Thank goodness for alka seltzer! Argh!"}
{"text":"Everyone whining and complaining about people from Chicago, just stop. Sounds like you're bitter and strays away from the point of reviewing a restaurant. I have been waiting 8 years for a decent italian beef to reach the Valley and now I have it conveniently located down the street from my house! Get a burger, hot dog, beef, sausage, chicken sandwich, chopped salad, whatever. You will not be disappointed! I have been there 3 times since they opened last week and each time the service was fast and friendly. I also visited with friends who were not Chicago natives and I'm pretty sure there were no words spoken during our meal other than \"This is so bomb\" and \"Mmmmm!\" Now all I have to do is try to restrain myself from eating here every day!"}
{"text":"Coming from the mid-west I have to say the heavens have opened up and dropped my home town food here in AZ after years of us trying to find anything close to the Chicago-style food!! Pretty much the same taste and quality of the Portillos back home. Best Italian beef and hotdog you will ever find in the desert guaranteed."}
{"text":"Portillo's isn't just hot dogs!  It is so much more!  I had the halibut fish sandwich and onion rings. Hot and crispy (both) very flavorful. They even have soup and I love soup almost any time of year!  Staff pleasant and when they call your number this server put a little poetic twist based on the last number of your order. Clever. We chose to go outside. It was a beautiful day. Besides, while the music was great (loved the genre) it was terribly loud inside. You can hear the music outside but at a lower tone so you could hear each other talk. Not a true complaint because now I know I won't be a stranger just some constructive criticism. Maybe others are okay and I  am just an old fuddy duddy. Oh well. I can always get it to go if I want. They also cater so now another place to consider for an office lunch. I also noticed special Lenten sandwiches."}
{"text":"This place sucks now that Don doesn't own it. The food simply isn't the same. Portillo's has the best beef in town before the change in owners. Went and had dinner their last night. I ordered the cheeseburger and fries. The cheese burger was Luke warm, cheese just thrown on there. Fries were awful, not fresh felt like they fried them, took them out when they got old and refried them... I ordered an Italian beef as well for lunch tomorrow and tried that and it was just as awful. Not the beef ths"}
{"text":"Just like back home in Chicago.   Perhaps some of the locals that give lower reviews just don't get the Italian Beef Sandwich...it is a Chicago delicacy!

Cheese Fries are addictive.  Been a patron of Portillos since the original Dog Shack.  Thank you Dick Portillo for opening in Scottsdale.  Please don't sell the franchise!"}
{"text":"Love the Italian Beef but to make it the best you need to get the t dipped. Omg. So good. 
Gone to the drive thru twice. Pretty quick service. 
I've also been inside. The people are very friendly and they work to move the people thru the line quickly. 
Great place to eat"}
{"text":"Locals took me to this place and I thought they were kidding. Hadn't had a hotdog in memory. I ordered one with everything and it was delicious. My vegetarian daughter had a huge grilled vegetable sandwich on homemade bread and said it was great. 

Warning: Really loud. So busy that the restaurant is really hard to keep clean. Tables and seats have food on them. Check the receipt upon pickup to make sure order is complete."}
{"text":"The place is legit. I had the double burger with onion rings and a side of ranch. The burger and onion rings we great. I just didn't care for the ranch."}
{"text":"I've experienced portillos both in Chicago and here in tempe,  and both times I've been underwhelmed.  The taste of the dipped sandwich is nice due to the spicy peppers but everything is just so greasy. I don't get the hype."}
{"text":"I love classic Chicago food at Portillo's! 
I went to the one in Tempe for the first time. I was very happy that it was such a great place to take kids, as there were three under that were 8 and under in our party. It's casual and it is very comfortable to take a large group (we had a large group, too). 
It is a little overwhelming and busy going in there - just so much stuff and seeming chaos going on when it's so busy. But, the menu is simple and it was great eats. I love the hotdog with poppy seed bun with everything on it. Nothing like it! The onion rings were crisp and delicious, too.
Everyone in my dining party was very, very happy. Even the kids were happy with their food. I highly recommend Portillo's. Just remember that it is classic food from Chicago and not necessarily what you'd expect at a hotdog stand in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Love the charbroiled chicken sandwich.  I get it every time I come to portillos. Great service and friendly staff. Plus the chocolate cake is to die for. A little bit of Chicago heaven."}
{"text":"I gave into the hype and met some girlfriends at Portillo's the other night for dinner...

Perhaps I had high expectations from both the Yelp reviews I'd read prior and all of my Chicago friends raving about this institution that they grew up frequenting.  

Unfortunately, I didn't realize that a few weeks after the grand opening, Portillo's would still be a zoo!  It's huge and lines weren't long, so I can't complain about that, there were just tons of people (both patrons and employees) everywhere you turned.  I didn't love the layout either...

I'm usually all about fast casual concepts and ordering at a window, but I hated that there are three different areas to pick up your food.  It varies depending on if you order salads, hot food, and/or dessert.  And you have to wait for your number to be called and then go pick it up from the appropriate window.  It's hard enough to hear your number being called and then it's tough because you have to leave your group to go get your food; hence, not a relaxing start to a meal...

Amongst my group of three, we had a hotdog, a chicken sandwich (the breaded one on the croissant), a bowl of chilli, a barbecue chicken salad, and two large fries (one with cheese and one without).  We also had a lemonade and several bottles of water.  

I will say that prices are very reasonable, and the food was fine -- not amazing though.  I felt like it was a glorified fast food restaurant; nothing to make me rush back, although I am sure I'll eventually make my way back to try some of the other things on the menu.  (The other salads looked good and I hear great things about their desserts).

Again, I wasn't a fan of all of the chaos -- perhaps that will die down eventually?  There were a ton of staff, but none of them were super friendly or helpful.  Guests are supposed to clear their own tables - we learned that when we asked.  

Portillo's doesn't offer a kids' menu (although considering the prices, that's fine), and no refills on drinks either.  I think if you go in with expectations for a higher end McDonald's, you'll be pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Totally worth it.  Sunday afternoon, no line worth mentioning.  Found a booth inside.  Great fries, great Italian beef.  Cake to go!"}
{"text":"This place was the talk around town when it first opened. So, I was looking forward to seeing what the fuss was all about. I was quite disappointed! I, of course, had to get the Chicago dog and it was nothing different than any other Chicago Dog places I have tried around. Maybe, I didn't do the hotdog justice!

I will say that the function of Portillo's is quite unique. It was a tad confusing and overwhelming but once you get the hang of the flow its pretty cool. Definitely a great atmosphere and had awesome customer service."}
{"text":"I waited 6 long years for Portillos to come to the Phoenix area! I am so happy that it is just as delicious as it is in Chicago! We went opening week and was quite impressed with the organization of such a large crowd. The line has been out the door every time we've gone but they are really efficient and never really waited long! My faves are the Italian beef (with mozzarella, extra gravy or dipped), burgers, cheese fries, and chocolate cake shake, so I usually spend a good chunk of time trying to decide what to get (as everything is so good!). My only complaint is that there aren't more locations yet! If there was one closer I would definitely eat their salads too. They are really good, but I don't make it up there enough to waste it on a salad ;)"}
{"text":"This could be the best beef/sausage combo sandwich I've had in my life.  The food is consistently great, and service is efficient and friendly.

The hot pepper topping is a must, unless you're not into spicy obviously.  Ask for a little extra, it's that good."}
{"text":"While I was in AZ I was told that I need to come here and get a Chicago style dog-yup, in AZ! Boy am I lad that I did.  It's a little chaotic when you walk in, and once you find the line to order in, the rest is easy!

The crinkle fries are a must, and I was told the milkshakes were delicious.  This was my first Chicago style dogs, and the pickles made it!

If you're in the area, definitely check them out!"}
{"text":"I go for lunch on occasion and I love it!! The burgers I assume are charbroiled cause they come out so perfect. I'm a french fry stickler and these guys nail it with the simple crinkle cut. Nice and crispy.

The Polish Dogs are fantastic! Great flavor, doesn't taste cheap. 

It does get pretty busy between 11 to 1pm but what do you expect? Prime location. 

Overall this place hasn't let me down in my 6-8 visits!!"}
{"text":"Famous for the Italian beef- go ahead and get it with the extra gravy and sweet peppers.  Now try to eat that without dripping on yourself.  They even have some vegetarian items that are pretty good if you're being carbon-conscious.  But if you have to have some beef, this is a good place to splurge!"}
{"text":"First things first, so you don't get it twisted:

I'm kinda a Luke's girl...or Al's girl...Joey's girl...DeFalco's girl...Chicago Burger Company's girl...ok, I guess it's time to face it. I'm an Italian beef sandwich whore.  I don't think I've met one that I didn't like. And now that this place is really close to work, I'm adding Portillo's to my dance card...

Yesterday a couple of folks from the office ordered takeout from there...I've been trying to be a good girl and avoid eating out everyday for lunch, but I finally broke down and said \"Yes\" to the mess. 

I ordered an Italian beef sandwich with EVERYTHING (how do you know if you REALLY LOOOOVE your new beau if you don't get to know every nook and cranny?) with \"gravy\" on the side...bless their hearts, they put my grilled onions and mozzarella (all melty and seductive-like) on the sandwich to go and put my \"gravy\", giardiniera, and peppers on the side...BRILLIANT! 

When I got my sandwich, it was P-E-R-F-E-C-T-oh, no sloppy, soppy mess that had been sitting or congealing for the 10 minute commute to tummy-town. I was able to decorate my vittles as I saw fit. The cheese fries were deliciously crispy crinkle cut fries that I was able to dip in the decadent, hot cheesy/jalapeno sauce. And to wash it all down? Sure I could've continued my quest for good-girl status and had water or a V8 but NO! I washed it down with a frosty, cold, bubbly root beer...and I was in heaven."}
{"text":"I think that this place is nostalgic for Chicago people. Not being from there, it was ok. Fries were fair and the dip was ok. I got it dunked, but it was too wet. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't the greatest either. I will give it another shot just in case it was a bad day."}
{"text":"Thank you. Finally, a real Chicago restaurant. It tastes just like home. I was there opening day just before the door opened. They are as yummy and fast. I used to drive to the California location every now and then just to get my fix.  The italian beef sandwich is so good."}
{"text":"\"Hot Dog\" is in the name and I am only going to Review the Hot Dogs.

Here I am going to \"go against the grain\" with a mediocre Review of a New Restaurant receiving mostly good Reviews.

Okay, so maybe I am a \"Hot Dog Snob\" from the East Coast, where everyone knows there is only one brand of Hot Dog that can stand up to being boiled instead of grilled. (The \"Dirty Water Dog\" is the Sabrett brand, in Natural Casing).

In fairness to this new location and because I love Hot Dogs I tried three varieties:

                        With everything! (The Chicago way)

                        With Mustard and Relish only (My favorite)
 
                        Chile Cheese Dog

Let me say, the \"Toppings\" are terrific. The problem is with the Hot Dog itself. Far too mild, no beefy taste (Bordering on no taste), overwhelmed by the toppings and with very little \"snap\" when biting into it.

Probably in the minority, but just NOT as good as the size of the Restaurant and the reputation would indicate.

Ted's is still the \"Hot Dog Of Choice\" in Phoenix and they are from Buffalo, New York. 

Willing to venture to Maricopa for the BEST BOILED HOT DOGS EVER (Sabrett)? If so, go to Al's Dogs located next to O'Reilly Auto Parts on John Wayne in Maricopa. Better call first to be certain they are open: (520) 357-3647"}
{"text":"Chicago style food!!! Love the hamburgers they are the best  . Strawberry cake is the bomb. Great atmosphere. Bring back memory's from Chicago."}
{"text":"I'm from Chicago and this is the REAL DEAL. Exactly like it is back home. Literally everything here is amazing from the italian beef the hot dogs salads, burger, chicken sandwich, cake, cheese fries ETC! Seriously you should try something new everytime you come!"}
{"text":"I was SOOOO excited when I heard Portillo's was opening in Scottsdale...I almost had to wipe away tears of joy!  This was always one of my \"go to\" spots when returning to the Chicagoland area.  Best Italian Beef here or there!  I also really like their chopped salad and of course Chicago Style Hot Dog and onion rings.  Really you can't go wrong with their menu and what I like best is that it tastes EXACTLY like it does in Chicago.  Dick Portillo has quality control down to an art unlike other Chicago chains who have tried to make the transition to Phoenix (which everyone knows is the largest suburb of Chicago..lol)."}
{"text":"Great food just like all the locations in Chicagoland area...Very Busy when I was there for MLB Spring training.I wish the would build a location in Las Vegas. You can never go wrong w/ a Beef from Portillos"}
{"text":"Food is great Chicago fast food. Service is a mess! The food is so good that I keep banging my head against the wall! They have gotten exactly ZERO orders correct in 6 attempts! The manager wants to please us and it must be working we keep trying!  We have gotten lasagna free, a dinner free and a salad free all due to massive errors and excessive wait times. Again the food they advertise is exactly what you get and tastes perfect. You likely will not get what you order or it can be a 20 minute wait in drive thru. They also lost a call in order, never \"got\" order via yelp, didn't get an internet order via their web site, and forgot half my order. So the lesson... eat inside so you can give them back the wrong food and get the correct food. Don't leave the drive thru window until you see everything you requested. It may be someone else's meatball sub! If you like my reviews follow me! Thanks"}
{"text":"Couldn't wait to visit, very familiar with the chain as we frequented it often downtown Chicago.
Food is still good but just seems like something has changed that is why I didn't give it 5 stars."}
{"text":"Lets start off with the cons of this place

Cons: No combo meals

No kid meals

Its literally right up the street from me (this is bad , very bad LOL )

If you can get over that, then I guess you will be ok

I have been a few times now and I have to say they are slowing winning me over. The 1st time I went I swore I would never go back the 2nd time I went I thought damn this is a good hot dog the 3rd time I went I had to admit I am a fan.

I love the Chicago style dog, I always order the Portillos all beef dog, it comes with mustard (big win for me since I'm not a fan of catsup) relish, freshly chopped onions, nice slices of tomato, a quartered dilled pickle and hot peppers all saflely bounded together by a perfectly steamed poppy seed bun and all this for just $2.65!! LOVE IT! 

When you check out there menu you will see they have a lot going on, from hot dogs, to sandwiches to burgers, to salads even soup & deserts and for you veggin love fools they even have a meatless menu too, so Im sure there is something for every picky eater out there.

If you haven't given Portillos a try, I think you should, if they didn't win you over the 1st, like me, go back and try it again, believe me it wasn't love at 1st bite for me either but now I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"It's Portillo's...you get the Italian Beef or the Chopped Salad.  Both are amazing!  It's what you crave when you are from Chicagoland."}
{"text":"Would have gotten a five star but the French fries were just ok.  I got a hamburger and fries the hamburger was five star.  The meat was perfectly cooked and the bun was very tasty and stayed to there throughout the meal.  Very fresh and not greasy.  The french fries were just OK I expect crinkle fries to be crisp and hot and perfectly salted which these were not.  Also you have to walk back up to the counter to get a drink refill while there are 20 people waiting to pick up their orders very inconvenient.  All these people are waiting for the good food though, which is a good sign for a restaurant.  The location for being so busy was also very clean and the employees were very friendly."}
{"text":"Chocolate Cake Milkshake for the win!!!! Also a big fan of there beefies, used to always go to Al's until this place opened up and won me over!"}
{"text":"After all the hype about Portillo's coming to Tempe Marketplace and the photos friends had posted on Yelp, I was looking forward to trying this place. 

I've never been to Chicago, but I've had a delicious Chicago style hot dog before. I figured Portillo's had to serve up a hot dog better than the one I had from a food truck in Phoenix. Honestly, the one I tried tonight from Portillo's was not any better. On a positive note, the Beef Hot Dog \"with everything\" ($2.65) had good flavor with all the fixings: mustard, relish, freshly chopped onions, sliced red tomatoes, kosher pickle spear, and sport peppers. My primary complaint was that the \"perfectly steamed\" poppy seed bun was pretty soggy from all the fixings by the time I got home. It seems that the hot dog might best be enjoyed in the restaurant as the bun doesn't stand up very well - or maybe they should serve the fixings on the side for customers taking the hot dog to-go. 

The onion rings ($2.19) were pipping HOT and crispy, but lacked much in the way of flavor - definitely nothing noteworthy. 

The customer service was excellent! The drive though service seemed like a souped-up version of the In & Out experience: a person takes your order outside (instead of an intercom at the menu), another person confirms your order and collects your payment (also outside by walking up to your vehicle), finally a third person grabbed my order from the window and brought it to my car. This doesn't seem like the most efficient system (and unlikely sustainable during the summer months) but it's a nice attempt to make the experience more welcoming and customer-focused. 

Overall: good, not great experience tonight. I will return to try other offerings and re-evaluate. Thanks to a fellow Yelper (shout-out to Irina), I was surprised to learn that they actually have vegetarian and pescatarian sandwiches which have received positive reviews. Next time, maybe I'll have to try the Grilled Tuna Sandwich or the Halibut Sandwich!"}
{"text":"Portillos is my go to spot for chili dogs and Italian beef sandwiches. It's hard to find a spot that beats it and it always hits the spot."}
{"text":"I've tried their rib dinner for the 1st time...DO NOT BOTHER!! stick with the dogs, beef and burgers. 
Being from Chicago, I expected a different or chicago style rib.. instead a got a cold, mushy, too sweet, fall off the bone rib that I couldn't stomach.. plus a small order of fries and a tiny paper cup of coldslaw on a paper plate and plastic fork and knife...management was  kind or smart enough to comp my dinner.
My observation is that for the price they are charging for their \"full slab\" dinner.. for a few bucks more at Don and Charlies, you can get a real Chicago style full slab, a bowl of coldslaw, unlimited fries, a big  bread basket, white tablecloth, real silverware and plates and the ambience of a great sports hall of fame restaurant. 
I love Portillo's, been eating there for 25+ years.  I was so disappointed in their ribs.  Never again.  Stayin with the dogs, beefs and their salads are great too."}
{"text":"Amazing food !! Great service, Very fast and accurate! 
Clean inside and out! 
Try the beef sandwich, dipped with hot peppers! Yum!!"}
{"text":"Having grew up on Portillo's, it hurts my heart to post anything negative but feel its necessary in hopes of improvement. The food quality has definitely gone down since the corporate takeover but that's to be expected when you go from an individual owner that grew the business from a humble hot dog stand. That's not my gripe, service is. The general manager Jaime is an unprofessional, unfriendly person that should not be in customer service or a managerial role. Seeing his poor attitude towards customers, it's clear that employees think it's acceptable to be unfriendly as well. This place needs a management change and new friendly faces that appreciate their job and the customers they serve. Save Portillo's!"}
{"text":"Our first time and unfortunately will probably be our last unless we are right next to it.

Chilli dog was smashed. Ribs tasted like pickles instead of ribs. 

Why, if it is to dine in, do they put it into a bag and smash it all? 

Grilled chicken sammie and the bacon burger were just ok.  Neither were anything to write home about and for a place that's supposed to be famous this one does not live up to the reputation.  

Young man behind the cash register seemed bored.
If im near by ill give them a second try because once is not enough to make a real judgment on anything but i won't go out of my way.  We have had better hot dogs at Costco."}
{"text":"Food was good.  I'm not normally a big hotdog fan, but I can't pass-up a polish sausage! With Onion Rings.  Everything tasted great.  The in-store soda was pretty weird to refill.  I had to go to ask where to refill it & the already-busy- staff had to take their time to refill my soda behind the counter."}
{"text":"Man they used to be great...nowadays it is so hit or miss it's hardly worth the drive over to Tempe for the food.  

We used to spend $300 - $500 a month here, now you're lucky if we spend $50 - $75 and even that's dropping fast!  Get your shit together Portillo's!!!"}
{"text":"This is as good as it gets folks!  Chicago outside Chicago!  Best beef anywhere!

Great and efficient service, this is a great place to come for THE BEST Chicago food around!"}
{"text":"Who says you can't have a beef band a dog for a late breakfast! They open at 10 and there is no line. This place is different consistent that I eat it every time I'm in Tempe. And sunsets a few times a year every time I go back to Chicago I don't have to go to Portillo's anymore. Sweet!"}
{"text":"I love hot dogs and now I happen to love Chicago dogs(haven't tried them until portillos opened). I also got to try a few bites of my boyfriends italian beef sandwich but he didn't get the peppers at all so now I have to make a separate trip to try it with the peppers soon.  I'm obsessed with the jumbo dogs and also have to try it charred just to see how that is (even though I'm not a crazy fan about burnt food.). The french fries were decent nothing that made me want to run for the hills and scream about it.  Between the jumbo Chicago hot dog and the italian beef I think that has me hooked enough. Still need to try more on the menu since it's pretty lengthy.  Last night I got the chocolate cake shake and good god that's the first time I haven't been able to finish a small shake. Way too sweet for me. Definitely something that's a one and done type of thing for sure. It's definitely got all the frosting and such in the shake and the texture threw me off a bit since it's not smooth. :( not my kind of thing. Weird for me to say just too much going on in that shake for me."}
{"text":"This was my first time here, but I'd heard how good the food was by numerous people. I'm not sure what is normal for this place, so I'm just going to go with my experience was normal. I'd give 5 stars, but the tables we had to choose from were dirty, so I am not sure if we were supposed to clean our own area prior to sitting or not. Anyway, I got the fully loaded dog which was really good and filling, fries and a coke. The food was really good and I really enjoyed my company. 
My friend and I went to the restroom prior to eating but it was so busy in there! I really expected the restroom to be quieter than the dinning area. 
The dinning area was loud and busy. There was a ton of stuff to look at on the walls, so I was completely occupied during my entire visit. 
I'll definitely go back, but next time I'll only order one hot dog rather than the 2 I ordered this time."}
{"text":"Chicago transplants... Go for the dog.

After leaving Chicago over thirty years ago, and with just a couple of visits back since then, I missed a true \"Chicago Hotdog\", and Portillo's filled the bill with a perfect dog, including the poppy seed bun, sport peppers, kelly green relish, and a taste of celery salt.  The service was quick, the restaurant clean, and prices were appropriate.  

The Italian beef however left a little to be desired.  We requested the beef dipped, and even with it dipped the beef was dry tasting and over salted.  The roll was great, and the amount of meat in the sandwich was alright, but not \"piled on\".  The sweet peppers on top were very tasty.

5 star dog, and 3 star beef.  

After a day, I'm already craving another one."}
{"text":"I've heard of this place several times because of the Kinda Funny Podcast and how it's main guy always hypes the place up. Driving through this area my friend and I decided to try it out. I was blown away by how large the inside was since it didn't look to big from the outside. The staff was very friendly and the place was clean. I ordered a Portillo Hot Dog with everything, onion rings and a strawberry shake. We waited maybe 8 minutes tops (it was very busy) and got out food. It was absolutely delicious! The hot dogs were Chicago Style and had the works in it: hot peppers, pickles, sweet relish, tomatoes...so damn good! The onion rings were solid and were especially good with ranch dipping sauce. The shake was also great. It just worked together so well creating a great overall experience. I wanted to eat another hot dog as soon as I left the place that's how good it was! Overall, definitely would come back again!"}
{"text":"Fucking bomb. Chili is on point. Hot dogs are freaking delicious and the Sprite is even better than most spots. Cant wait to enjoy once again. And again. And again."}
{"text":"First time trying Portillos on the 28th of may (yesterday) it was really good! I got a jumbo hotdog with grilled onions, relish, celery salt, cheddar cheese and a baked potato. Really nice servers and good quality food! If your craving a hot dog this is the place to be!"}
{"text":"A co-worker turned me on to this place and it was ridiculously good!! I got the Italian beef and sausage sandwich with peppers. Thought that would be good enough as is right!? Oh no!!! You gotta get it smothered with the dipping sauce!
One of the best sandwiches EVER!!
I would have given it 5 stars but, the person that took our order rolled her eyes when we asked to get two separate bills"}
{"text":"The best drive-thru in town, but it will cost you as much as if you went in! Quality over-all above standard. The price hasn't stopped me yet, try the maxwell if you haven't already."}
{"text":"Italian beef sandwich, chili cheese fries and a cake shake!
Best lunch ever (when I'm feeling naughty and I've gone a week eating rabbit food)!"}
{"text":"I got a Chicago dog and a chili cheese dog. Both were yummy and had a good soft bun. I'll be back to scratch my Chicago dog itch."}
{"text":"NOT RECOMMENDED: Portillo's is the \"famous Chicago\" hot dog place and sorry to say but it sucked! Awful is putting it nicely. To say we are disappointed is a gross understatement. CHECK YOUR ORDER BEFORE YOU LEAVE THE DRIVE THRU!!!

I've heard so many great things about this place, especially from Chicagoans...  I don't get it?  How a hotdog establishment  messes up a hot dog is beyond me.  The hotdog was drenched in ranch and ketchup. It had so much liquid on it our kid refused to hold it until we poured Â¾ off. 

My wife order a grilled tuna sandwich and what she got was a DRY chicken sandwich?!??  Reminds me of Joe Pesci's character in the \"Lethal Weapon\" movies saying, \"they'll f@ÂÂ£ you in the drive through!\"  They did. 

My hotdog was a sad shriveled up sight. The bun was wet and chewy?  Must be a Chicago thing, as I tend to enjoy my bread not wet?!?!

I want my $20 and wasted time back from this place.  I'll avoid this place moving forward."}
{"text":"I went to this place for the first time with my boyfriend it was amazing! All the food is so good and the prices are so inexpensive. The food comes out hot and quickly as well. We got the chili hotdogs and onion rings so good!"}
{"text":"I'm a Chicagoland native and couldn't wait for the arrival of Portillos to the desert. This place does a lot really well - Italian beef, sausage, burgers, chicken sandwich, salads, desserts and, of course, hot dogs. Great prices. Bottled water for 69 cents! Great atmosphere and outstanding service for a fast good joint. My only disappointment is that they didn't bring to Arizona the Barnelli's side of the restaurant. Two requests for Mr. Portillo - please bring Barnelli's and please, please build in the Northwest valley - Peoria, Arizona would be great in honor of its sister city in Illinois."}
{"text":"Pretty good food, not dog friendly but shows up on dog friendly restaurants on yelp. Only service dogs which all places have to allow by law"}
{"text":"Great restaurant. Great management.  Love the food, everything is good but maybe not so healthy?  I can't stay away more than a month.  Very addictive. The prices are crazy low, it is so close to everything. Give it a try, the Italian beef will make you cry tears of joy."}
{"text":"I'm a total fan of the Italian Beef Sandwich and their crinkle cut fries.......I wish they'd open one in Old Town Pasadena..."}
{"text":"Growing up in Chicago and then moving to Scottsdale, I was a huge Portillo's fan when Dick Portillo owned it, but since selling the chain, it has become a major disappointment. The portions of food have greatly diminished - Both the roast beef sandwich and jumbo dog were minuscule, and I can only infer that so too are the other menu items. I won't be coming back - it's on to Al Malnati's for me in the future!"}
{"text":"Good Ol' Portillos. Chicago based restaurant came out west to bring us some back east chow. It's a decent restaurant and the food is pretty good. You can't go wrong with the anything on the menu. Ask questions and make sure you get to try all the different ways to enjoy some grub."}
{"text":"THE BEST BEEFS, EVER!!! Their service is a little slow if it's not the busy time of day, but the food more than makes up for it!

If you've never been here, don't order a hot dog. Order a beef, with peppers, dipped. That's the real treat, and you won't be disappointed. The hot dogs are good, don't get me wrong, but the real heaven is in the beef!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Portillo's! Epic Hot Dogs and Burgers and the best krinkle-cut fries ever. Getting hungry just thinking about it. Chi-Town flavor, well-managed, runs like clockwork. Don't lolly-gag in line, LOOK ALIVE! .....they got a business to run! LOL 5 stars."}
{"text":"Seriously let down by this place...

I ordered two Chicago dogs and they were pretty lackluster. The buns themselves were soggy, the peppers were HUGE and awkward to eat. The fries were decent and the shake was ok (strawberry). 

Sadly this place is supposed to be known for their hotdogs, and they fell pretty flat here. 

I won't be coming back to this place anytime soon..."}
{"text":"Genuine Chicago style hot dog. Good place to eat for a quick bite and they have a drive through"}
{"text":"This place is all about the food, plus the atmosphere is great too.  I've had the hotdogs, hamburger and big Italian beef.  The dogs are good, hamburger excellent and Italian beef is THE best sandwich period that I've had in any restaurant!!!  Make sure to take their advise and get it \"dipped\", although it'll get messy.  Add mozzarella, and peppers if you like a little spice.  It's huge, slow cooked beauty, with the most amazing fresh sandwich roll !!  Fries are decent, too."}
{"text":"These aren't just hot dogs! Great Chicago fare, family friendly, relaxed atmosphere. Try the pumpkin shake, it's Amazing!"}
{"text":"This was my first time to eat at portillos. I got the beef sandwich with hot peppers and cheese fries as a side. The staff there is really nice and help direct you ever step of the ordering process. The food came out quickly and was correct. 

The first thing I noticed when opening up my sandwich is how greasy it was! That usually doesn't bother me but dang this sandwich was drenched! The paper it was wrapped in was even drenched. The sandwich tasted good and the peppers added some flavor. I won't be rushing back and don't understand what the hype was about, but in the future if I do return I'll try out another item from the menu."}
{"text":"We went to Portillo's for the first time this weekend -- it was a long time coming, as we had both driven by and heard so much about this place for awhile. Walking in, we were overwhelmed with the large size of the restaurant, and the amazing amount of decor and memorabilia items covering the walls and ceiling. 

You order at the registers and wow - their menu is WAY more than dogs and fries. Pasta, salads, burgers....but really, who orders anything but a hot dog at this place? We both got regular sized dogs and I got a side of onion rings with mine. 
The dogs were good! Nothing out of this world, but definitely fresh tasting and yummy for sure. Pretty sure I will order the \"jumbo\" size next time, though.
I wasn't overly thrilled with the onion rings...they didn't seem super fresh to me - I like my onion rings golden brown and piping hot.

I will definitely be back - great bang for your buck! We left with full tummies, but didn't feel overly stuffed, which is always a plus :)"}
{"text":"I fail to understand the criticisms on here.  It's great to finally have a place that has great Italian beefs in the Valley. Honestly....I've never had better Italian beef than in Chicago.  The 2 best are one place I don't even remember the name of....and Portillo's.  They've brought the greatness to Arizona.  The beef is tender and the beef and gravy super flavorful.  Get it dipped or not....but always get an extra side of gravy for dipping.  You have to sop up every last bit with whatever remaining bread you have.  The shakes.  Delicious also.  Fries....standard but tasty.  It's amazing to have a great Italian beef shop out here.  ...and everything else....including the salads....can't go wrong."}
{"text":"This has 3 stars for the exact reason because It's decent food, terrible customer service. First of all, lady at the window was not helpful At ALL, was very short with us.. Actually cut us off before we were even done ordering. my apologies for no other places being open and this is the last stop. Won't come here again."}
{"text":"In town visiting and happened to pass by on my way back to my hotel.  Looked like it had some character so decoided to try it out.  Ordered the gumbo chili dog, dries and s chocolate shake.  I thought everything was very good, especially the shake.  Will definitely go back when I am in the area."}
{"text":"I usually get dogs here but last night I tried the Italian Beef sandwich with the cheese fries and I must say it was incredible! Filled with so much flavor! That was hands down one of the best Italian Beef sandwiches I've had in a long time! Portillo's never disappoints!"}
{"text":"First heard about this place from my husband because he had it in Chicago, so as soon As the scottsdale one opened we went...not a big fan of the hot dogs(gasp) but they're burgers were pretty good..I loved the shake, and most of all the cheese fries!!!"}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and stop by!! The salads look and taste good. It's rush hour lunch time and everyone is friendly and moving quickly to get your order out. The portion size is generous. Impressive! It's a little loud here but when in Rome!!!"}
{"text":"I will never ever patron this location ever again!!!! My husband ordered my daughter a hotdog with ketchup and a pickle. The pickle had a huge bite in it. Unacceptable!!!!! The fries were not fresh at all. So I am not one to complain but my husband called the manager (Amy) and told her what happened. He brought the food into the location. She replaced the food and he tasted the fries and he said they still didn't taste fresh. Amy then preceded to state she will give him fresh fries....isn't that what she was supposed to do the first time...she replaced them again and threw the bags in his hands as if he were a dog. Now my husband is a big teddy bear.... patient as pie but me...I'm 0 to 100 real quick. I'm glad I didn't deal with her today. Providing bad customer service is my pet peeve. My husband and I both work for really amazing customer service companies and we will make sure everyone knows of our experience so that others will not patron this location. We are originally from Illinois where their corporate office is located and once I contact corporate about Amy's nasty and totally unprofessional treatment. You never know who you know. Amy shouldn't be in management or she needs to be trained all over again."}
{"text":"Went to Portillo's last night for dinner. Order was taken excellent as usual. Salads took for ever. Mind you they were two side garden salads. I waited 15 minutes and my food order sat their waiting and getting cold. Love the food but they need a lot of work with their staff."}
{"text":"If you are looking for the type of mayhem fast food restaurant where you feel like you are at an amusement park - limited parking, tons of people, a long line, waiting for your number to be called, tons of kids running around, trying to find a table, and being accidentally pushed by kids and adults, and eating food similar to that you would get at an amusement park, then you found the right place. Sorry kids - the only thing that's missing are the rides. I prefer a sit down, relaxing, \"waiter comes to you\" type of restaurant where you can hear the person sitting across from you talk without them shouting."}
{"text":"Let's get this outta the way....this place is magical! I love the Americana slap in the face you get as soon as you see the place. I felt as if I were stepping back to a simpler time of good food and good people. 

Let's talk about the food. I ordered the Big Beef sandwich, large (crinkle cut) fries, and a large lemonade. This Italian Beef sandwich is one of the top 10 things I have eaten in my life.....seriously. The beef is cooked to perfection, the peppers (I ordered both hot and sweet) were the perfect accent, and the bread, which soaks up the gravy that is poured on the sandwich provides a great texture to wrap everything together. The fries are absolute perfection as well. They were the perfect temp and crunchiness. 

This has instantly become one of my go to spots. If you have one near you, or even if it is a bit of a drive (it's 45 minutes for me), it is worth it! 

This is not a meal I will soon forget."}
{"text":"I ordered a jumbo chili cheese hot dog. Not bad at all. Exactly as it appears on the menu. I also had cheese fries. Not bad. I will be going back to try more items off the menu. I loved the atmosphere at this restaurant.  I really enjoyed my meal. Take note that as I sat down a very polite woman/ employee named Nicky cleaned off the table for me."}
{"text":"LOVE Portillos but getting sick of them messing up my order. Would be a 5 based off of food, but a 2 since they lately can't seem to get it right. 3rd time going thru and coming home w messed up order. Not worth driving back to get it corrected or wasting my time to sit on hold for 10 minutes and never getting a manager."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, and really don't understand its popularity. It's not like it's bad food, it's just average at best. Basically a glorified fast-food place with a more extensive menu. That said it's clean, and the employees are efficient and polite. But as far as the food goes the best I can say is adequate."}
{"text":"Being a fellow Chicagoan visiting this place is near and dear to my heart. Sometimes if your new you may not know what to order (hint hint: ask questions). This place is legit though."}
{"text":"we knew about Portillos from our many travels to Chicago so we were excited to here they were opening one here and not too far from where we live. been here twice now and every time its crazy busy!! the location is perfect right off the 101 and Shea so its easy to get to. The people are friendly and the wait wasn't too long considering how packed it was. 

We had a plain hot dog for my 2 year old, chili cheese dog with onions (sooo good), a bacon burger which was great just be careful not to leave it in the container it comes it mine got super soggy. Italian beef sandwich was also good pretty much anything we tried was great! 

for dessert we got the chocolate cake and strawberry milk shake both were yummy!! 

will definitely be coming back wish it was just 5 minutes away but worth the extra drive"}
{"text":"Portillo's is a Chicago staple and being new to the area, I was happy to see some of Chicago in Phoenix.  Good food and I love the shakes."}
{"text":"SO good! I was visiting my boyfriend that was living in Arizona, and he insisted on bringing me to Portillo's, he knew I was going to love it! I had never heard of it before because I from Montreal. I had hands down one of the best beef sandwiches in my life. It had these tasty hot peppers too. I enjoyed the crinkle cut fries as well, very yummy (but very fattening!). Definitely a must have if you are around!"}
{"text":"Great food, especially the Italian Beef! Make sure you get it with the sweet peppers. Love the onion rings. Atmosphere is very friendly. Service is great and entertaining."}
{"text":"Might as well just do fast food it will have a lot less 50s replica junk on the walls cost less and wreck you just the same on the insides."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, the burgers are absolutely delicious and so juicy and satisfying. The fries are amazing and omg... The chocolate cake shake is the best way to finish off. The prices are pretty average but so so worth it"}
{"text":"Been to this location many times the food and service is excellent.My go to is the big beef dipped with sweet peppers and provolone cheese best sandwich ever.The Maxwell street polish is great also the French fries are salty and crispy tough to beat. This place brings Back a little bit of chi town. Update bad night this trip forgot to dip big beef forgot the hot peppers still hood would have been better."}
{"text":"A taste of chicago. This location feels less crowded the the Tempe spot. Onion ring are a must along with the chocolate cake."}
{"text":"Prices aren't too bad. Too cluttered and obnoxious for me. Jumbo chili cheese dog was pretty good taste, barely bigger than a regular hot dog. Was on a sesame bun. Ordered a chocolate cake shake, way too sweet it burnt the back of your throat and didn't even taste like ice cream, nor did the regular chocolate shake. Just taste like sugar. Gross. I returned it for a regular fountain drink. Wouldn't recommend it"}
{"text":"I wish I didn't have to drive to Buena Park for this and they'd open one close to DTLA, but the food is the same"}
{"text":"This place makes really good hotdogs, and equally as good hamburgers.    I've had the pleasure of dinning here with my co-workers and family.  It can be a bit noisy, but when I'm out for a hotdog, hamburger or killer sausage I not going to dine with pinky's out.   This is good, roll up your sleeves and grab a stack of napkins food."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch. We've been here twice now and have been happy with the food. Hamburgers are good also. Try the chili covered tamale. It's a great snack. And of course the hot dogs are top notch."}
{"text":"So disappointing! We had the all beef hot dog, chili dog, double burger, onion rings, Italian sandwich, spaghetti, meatball and 1/2 bread. The only decent thing to eat from this large order was the hot dog. The chili was edible @best. The burger was bland. A dollar menu burger from McDonald has more flavor. The best part of the burger was the crispy lettuce. The onion rings were greasy. The Italian sandwich was actually seasoned only way too seasoned that it was too salty to eat. The spaghetti tasted like canned tomato sauce warmed then poured over pasta noodles. The noodles were bland no seasoning @all my 10 year old took 2 bites and refused to eat anything after that. The meatball tasted like something out of the pre-packaged frozen aisle. We won't be coming back. With all the food ordered but not eaten we tossed the barely touched food and left hungry."}
{"text":"Went today for Chicago Style Dogs and had great tasting Vienna Dogs. Buns were perfectly steamed and the toppings were on point. 

I think the new owners did something to the Italian Beef because the last time I was there it just didn't have the flavor of the past and the amount of beef given is so random I don't even bother ordering it any more. 

They still have the best dogs around so I will be back for those."}
{"text":"Great service, fun atmosphere, average food BUT the cake shake is quite tasty. A review of the shake alone would garner 5 stars. There are better burgers, dogs, and fries at their competitors. Pop in for a shake!"}
{"text":"Portillo's was close to the level of hype my Chicago friends rave about. 

We entered it on the way to the airport. Upon entry we were nervous it would take too long because there was a very big line. However they were very quick with filing people through and getting their orders fulfilled. 

The Chicago dogs were the the best I've had to date. My only complaint is the Italian beef sandwich was really soggy when we opened it out of the wrapper.

I look forward to next time, as I will try either the chocolate shake or cake. I hear these are excellent choices."}
{"text":"From the outside it looks like a cute retro restaurant but you're in for fast food quality food. The Italian beef sandwich is SOOOO oily!! It was dripping all the way through the paper and made the French bread very soggy. The meat does taste good but it was still too plain for me, despite how it was drenched in oil. French fries were too salty. I do like the poppyseed salad though. And the poppyseed muffin that came with the salad was good. I guess if you're like me and you don't like fast food, you probably wouldn't like this place. It's way too unhealthy. It's cheap, but I could think of many fast good chains that are cheap AND good."}
{"text":"I ordered a big beef today and it was noticeably smaller. A smaller roll and less beef. Really? One of my favorite places has now lowered itself to the obvious pursuit of increasing its profit margin and making more money. You know what? I would rather pay more for the original unaltered sandwich!

Should have known this would happen after the change in ownership and sale to a private equity firm."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, have to update my review. 

Got food poisoning on 4/16. Spent the last 2 days deathly ill. My mom, who is visiting me from out-of-town, was hit harder with the food poisoning and has been in bed for two days. It was the last meal we had that day and a couple hours later it hit us both. Won't be back. :-/"}
{"text":"This is truly an amazing find. I am not a burger person at least not often. So my husband's need to come here for burgers all the time frustrated me. Lol I finally decided to order pasta here when he got his burger and OH MY GOSH! I have not had pasta this authentic and delicious since New York at an Italian family kitchen! I loved every bite and stuffed myself because it was so savory... The salad and bread were great too! The best pasta in AZ thus far and its affordable. This level of greatness should be in a fancy restaurant lol"}
{"text":"Man oh man, do I love Portillo's. Before they moved into the Tempe Marketplace location, their other restaurant was located in Scottsdale - a bit too far for me (even if I'm at the halfway point)!

There are also a couple of other hot dog eateries around Tempe, but for Portillo's it's located right outside of Tempe Marketplace, so I can get my shop on after eating a hot dog (and lose all those calories I just consumed haha)! I come here with my family and we usually just order their hot dogs, my sister has tried their burgers and salads, but she wasn't a big fan of them.

The decor is a throwback to the poodle skirt era (hello 1950's!). It's large inside, and can sit large groups of people within your party. They have booths as well as open seated tables, I like grabbing a booth because it just seems more fun and retro for some reason, but I also like grabbing a seat by the windows because it feels like you're in a cafe. The best way I can put it is if you've eaten at one of Disneyland's restaurants, you have that soft comfort murmur of people outside and around you which I really like. If you can brave the 110 heat, you can also sit outside in their patio which is equally as large. There are fans overhead and the area is covered by a ramada to add to ambiance of eating hot dogs and burgers in your patio (or your neighbors). Eating outside of Portillo's is really nice during our cool months though, it's very enjoyable!

When you go to order your food, staff will be there to ask if you've eaten there before, if you haven't they'll explain the menu to you. When you order they write everything on paper bags - this way they know what you ordered and you won't get mixed up orders when you receive your food in the bags! You have to be attentive when they call your order out, they will not deliver your food to your table, so we usually wait around the window for our food or sit in the booth waiting for our number to be called. Numbers are not called in order, it's whenever the food gets out, so if you're one of those people who gets angry that number 85 got called before your 55, take a chill pill, because your food is coming out, just gotta have some patience!

The staff also makes up rhymes when your number is called, it's awesome! So far I usually order the polish hot dog with American cheese - but I can eat their crinkle cut fries and cheese sauce all. Day."}
{"text":"Awesome! If you like real Chicago style dogs and Italian beef sandwiches, this is THE place."}
{"text":"Went through the drive through on the way from Phoenix to Tucson and picked up the apple walnut salad - a seasonal menu option with chicken, walnuts, cranberries, blue cheese and leafy greens. My friend ordered a pretty large order of other menu items which I'm pretty sure was made fresh, as we waited for some time at the window for our food to be ready - fine by me as the food was extremely fresh. Will be back!"}
{"text":"My problem with the location is that if your shtick  is going to be how fast you are then get the orders correct. The last 2 times I have been in the order has not been correct."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was cool and the portillos hot dog was fantastic, but...it took forever to get 2 hot dogs and it was pretty empty in there, onion rings were burnt, and no refills on drinks brought the rating down, but the hot dogs make up for it."}
{"text":"What a cute place with great sandwiches. I can see why this place is popular for a fast food type experience without the typical fast food. 
I had the Italian beef sandwich which is a specialty of theirs and really delicious.
Hubby went with the same only his was a combo with sausage added. Fries were great and it's a cool place to take the family, out of Towners or drive thru (they take your order in advance of getting to the window)
Indoor and outdoor seating with checkerboard pattern. We will be going back again soon."}
{"text":"This was average at best. I frequented the Chicagoland locations years ago and always had an amazing experience. This one, not so much. The Portillos Dog was not impressive. A small dog with a cheap bun and a failed attempt with the weak fixings. That's just mine.
My wife's Apple Walnut Chicken salad was bland, no taste whatsoever and overpriced. That is all to say about that.
My son said his burger was good, but his chocolate shake was not. I tried it and it did taste like it was made with generic Hershey's syrup.
Not planning a return visit anytime soon.
If your visit was a better experience, congratulations."}
{"text":"Dogs were good and priced well. I visited on a Monday around 1:30."}
{"text":"We do Portillo's often. We go through the drive through,  and always have a positive experience.  The staff reads back your order two or three times between stations, to ensure that they have everything correctly. 

A creature of Portillo's habit, I always go for the Italian beef with sweet peppers and mozzarella. The shakes are superb. The fries are just ok, and the onion rings pretty good. They'll make you an Arnold Palmer too, which is great.

Service, at least in the drive-through, is fast and friendly. We come often, and will continue to patronize Portillo's."}
{"text":"Really not seeing the draw to this place. Visited yesterday on a recommendation from one of their staff members I met who seemed to have nothing but wonderful things to say about his employer's restaurant. Needless to say his opinion failed to meet my expectations. 

First impressions are not everything. Make no mistake, the building itself is impeccably decorated. Inside and out are both done up really well. The place was absolutely jam packed with people too. At least 150 people were crammed into the premises, all seemingly enjoying the rush of the fast paced ordering service. And it's here that I have to hand it to them. With lines nearly out the door (and it's a long way from the registers to the exit), employees handled the crowd with ease. No hiccups. No rudeness. Perfect service. At this point it's safe to say I was impressed and excited to eat!
 
Unfortunately you just cannot rely on first impressions. The decor is a facade for what really is going on here. Only one word comes to mind when I now think of Portillo's: GIMMICK. The food here is nothing to write home about at all, or maybe it is, just not in the way you might think. The hot dogs I ordered were served in your typical Chicago style. Sesame seed bun, pickle, hot peppers, tomatoes, onions, and mustard. How could you go wrong? Right? Well they managed to... The bun was straight out of a cheap grocery brand bag. The hotdog tasted like an undercooked Bar S hotdog glazed with the dirty dollar bills Dick Portillo managed to swindle out of me. I could have easily made this at home for a fraction of the price and effort. Even the onion rings were from a low grade frozen grocery store brand. I know this because I often buy the exact same ones to eat at home, they are indistinguishable in both looks and taste. Terribly mediocre and good only for a quick frozen home meal. 

Some people will gawk at my review and say \"Try the Italian beef. You'll change your mind.\" And to that I say \"My friend ordered the 'Italian' beef and cheese croissant with gravy. I took one bite and found myself only pushed further to disgust by this rip off of an establishment.\" 

What a waste of time and money. I think it's safe to say Portillo's failed to gain a regular customer yesterday. I also think it's safe to say I won't be recommending this pace to anyone any time soon. 

The only thing saving it from receiving a one star review is it's visual appeal and perfectly managed staff. So... kudos to you Dick Portillo for creating one of the largest privately owned food brands around! What a business plan you've crafted here too! Incredibly cheap ingredients and components sold at a premium... Wow... Can you say profits?! I'd love to own the place for a week. A privately owned chain with an owner who's story defines the \"American Dream\" and basing out of a city famous for this style of food... Sounds good on paper but ,take heed, only one word can describe Portillo's: gimmick."}
{"text":"The impression I got was high school hang out. Like a place you and your buddies go on a Friday or Saturday night before you hit the movies at Tempe Marketplace before your parents pick you up behind the restaurant so no one can see you don't have a car.  I've never been to Chicago so I have to take their word that it is just like what they serve there.  I've also never really been into hot dogs, much less hot dogs on steroids.  My brother-in-law and I went there because he said it was good eats for cheap.  He was right.  The quantity of food you get is good.  They give you these little muffins with your salad that are tasty.  You can also get some pretty mean looking chili cheese dogs if you're brave enough.  I went a little more boring and got a chicken sandwich.  Not the place you want to visit if you're looking to relax.  It's extremely loud in there!  The patio is nice if you decide to sit outside."}
{"text":"The Phoenix metro area is just another huge suburb of Chicago.  I recommend this location on a sunny day in January during a Midwestern polar vortex (halo); now back to my chocolate cake shake ..."}
{"text":"Highly overrated! Portions are too small for the price and the food is mediocre. If it weren't for the discount card, there'd be no incentive to go out of your way for this place."}
{"text":"Same situation as my first review. It took the staff three times to get my one chili dog correct. On the second time I even brought the bag and receipt so they can see it."}
{"text":"Actually still sitting in the drive through, which I don't mind.  Just placed a pretty large order, and was handed a menu after the order was placed and asked to call ahead next time in a very rude tone.  Very simply could've asked us to pull forward and wait.  Horrible customer service."}
{"text":"Simply RUDE customer service sucks here. A blonde surfer looking kid didn't great me just said what do you want and looked angry the entire time his name was Ryan. Also, the girl calling our number wasn't so kind either. I definitely will not return here again."}
{"text":"Being from Chicago and living in El Paso now, you get these cravings for Italian Beef and Chicago style hot dogs.  It's a Chicago thing.  Visited Phoenix and had to make the drive to eat here.  Ate here two nights in a row for dinner. :-)

Had the combo, dipped with hot peppers both nights.  Had fries and a jumbo hot dog as well.  Have to give them credit for consistency.  I've eaten at a few of the Chicagoland Portillo's locations and they all taste the same, they're all good!  I asked for my sandwich wet instead of dipped at first but the manager didn't know what I meant so I just said dip it.

Service was typical Portillo's with their unique number calling system.  This place reminds me of home."}
{"text":"Way overrated and overpriced. For as many people working here it takes forever to get the food. Not worth the wait and all the crowds."}
{"text":"I can't be in the vicinity of Portillo's without stopping in for a double dipped beef dip with hot peppers and extra crispy French fries. Consistently delicious! Service is always good and food delivered hot as it should be. Mmmmmm great"}
{"text":"I'd give zero stars if I could. The manager Jamie is so disrespectful. He accused me of giving a scam. He refused to let me do two separate orders. One order was in cash for my friend, so I could give him his change. The other was with my debit card. He said corporate doesn't allow two separate payments cause I could be doing a scam. I didn't know ordering food with real money and a debit card was against the law. I am disabled and came here to pick up food because they're open late. I will be calling corporate first thing on Monday. To treat a disabled customer or any paying customer with such disrespect is absolutely appalling. What kind of business are you running where you treat customers like a piece of garbage? I will never be back here. I will let all my friends and family to go elsewhere. You want a hot dog go to Weinerschitznel or Sonic. I hope Jamie is fired for this. I've been in customer service for over 10 years and have never been treated so badly and by a manager! Disgusting customer service."}
{"text":"Went today. Amazing Chicago style Italian beef. Tamale. Like my childhood in my hometown of Chicago. Packed yet still quality service and food highly recommended to all but anyone missing Chicago."}
{"text":"I am originally from Chicago, and I have discovered that a good Italian Beef sandwich is very hard to come by outside of the Chicago area. Enter Portillo's a Chicago-based restaurant. I love the Beef and Cheddar Croissant. It is what I order from Portillo's almost every time I am in one of their restaurants when I am back home, and it wAs a very pleasant surprise to find a Portillo's in the desert!

The food is great and the service is pretty good. I was thrown off a tad when i ordered my sandwich sweet and wet, a term that most Chicagoans would easily understand, and the young lady behind the cash register looked at me like I was crazy. Fortunately, I was able to translate the lingo into layman's terms pretty easily, and it got me one of the best Beef and Cheddar Croissants that I have had."}
{"text":"we ate here no 11-06-14 around 1:00 pm.  the line to order moved very fast.  the menu has a lot of items to select from.  no combo meals.  the cashier people were friendly and helpful.  we had no trouble finding a table to sit.

we ordered a big beef, onion rings, hot dog, jumbo hot dog, and fries.  the food was great.  i don't think i ever had a hot dog that knocked me off my feet.  but the food was very enjoyable.

our bill before tip was $26.  we plan on going back again in the future."}
{"text":"Loved the strawberry shortcake. The cheese sauce is delicious. Chocolate cake shake was too heavy and sweet. The Italian beef sandwich could use some sauce. The hotdog is so salty and I wouldn't order that again. Though I'm not in a hurry to come back, I'd get the strawberry shortcake and the cheese sauce (with onion rings) next time.  Ambiance was loud, busy, and straight-up Midwestern, ie, white."}
{"text":"I ordered the Italian beef sandwich with hot peppers. I took one bite of the sandwich and could have thrown up. It tasted like a chitterling sandwich. The meat was \"stinky\" (for lack of a better word). It tasted like someone gathered cow anuses and put them in a sandwich. My husband got a burger of some sort. It was lackluster. Staff is okay. Not particularly friendly or unfriendly. It's crowded and loud... plus there is a board with letters of admiration to a guy named \"Dick\"....I assume he's the owner or something.....  I did enjoy reading all those letters while I waited for my food."}
{"text":"I was hungry for a burger and onion rings and that was my mistake - the Portillo's burger was more than well done, it was hard as a brick and tasteless, and the onion rings were no better than I can get in the grocery store freezer.
Next time, if there is one, I'll try something different.  There has to be a reason this place is so popular - but you can't prove it by my experience"}
{"text":"Such a fun place with simple, amazing food! This was our first time here and I can see it being a regular spot for us. My husband had The hot dog and the chili cheese dog and they were delicious. I got the Mediterranean salad and it was fresh and so yummy. I love that they have healthy options. I can't wait to come back and try more!"}
{"text":"After hearing every Chicago-ite I know praise this place I knew I had to try it.  I went there on opening day in North Scottsdale.  Had their italian beef sandwich.  Was meh.  Went a second time a couple weeks later.  Had the Italian beef & cheese crossaint. Meh again.  Figured I would give it one more shot at the tempe location.  Had the Chicken croissant sandwich.  Meh yet again.
I know what y'all are thinking.  Why didnt you have the hot dog?  THAT'S WHAT THEY DO BEST!  A Chicago style hot dog has 2 main things which I cant stand.  Mustard and pickles.  You wont get a fair review from me when it comes to hot dogs.  I prefer the majesty of Short leash hot dogs."}
{"text":"I grew up in Tucson, Az, and I grew up with Luke's Italian Beef on Ft. Lowell, literally the best Italian beef and hot dogs and grinders I've ever had, without having ever been to Chicago. 

So my dad tells me he had been to Portillo's in Chicago and that Luke's copied Portillo's. Says we should totally go, and so I'm expecting this AMAZING food. 

We eat out a lot, and usually when we aren't impressed then we just shrug it off, but I was pretty disappointed here. We all were. The \"big beef\" was decent sized, but as bland as bland could be. Bland and dry. I also got a \"southwest bbq chicken salad\" and it looked like something from QuikTrip. And you know, I honestly think the salads at QT are better than that. It was supposed to come with BBQ ranch, but.... It just tasted like sweet watery mayonnaise in there. Oh man.... So disappointed. My daughter got the fried chicken croissant sandwich, which tasted OK, but was nothing to write home about. Standard fried chicken item, standard fried chicken taste. I sure hope the original Portillo's is better than this."}
{"text":"Sitting in Portillos right now, and for the second time we are so very disappointed. My cheeseburger is cold and tasteless as though it's been sitting in the kitchen for a while. What's happened to this place? It used to be a favorite of mine. Is it time to find a new hamburger place?"}
{"text":"First time going here was today. I have to say it was amazing. The food was delicious and the atmosphere was fun. 

The only thing I didn't like was the girl that took our order, she was rude."}
{"text":"We are from out of town and always make sure to stop in here. Make sure you get jumbo hot dogs as the regular are fairly small. Their beef sandwiches are also excellent. Service has been friendly and timely every trip."}
{"text":"Ew! Don't get the beef and cheddar croissant, or maybe just don't ever get it to-go! It was super soggy and wet, made me want to throw up. The sweet peppers I added gave it a little flavor, but the beef just wasn't that good. I only could stomach to eat half. I would go for an Arby's sandwich over this any day. The onion rings were good, but how can you really mess up onion rings? Am I right? 

Service was good! They were friendly and fast, pretty efficient little routine they had going. Just disappointed in the product. 

I'll still go back... Need to try out their dogs. It's possible I just ordered the wrong thing."}
{"text":"We got the Italian Meats, Hot dog with everything on it, and Burger. 
My husband loves the Italian meats sandwich and gets this every time with no disappointments. 
My 2 toddlers shared the burger and it had a really good taste and was a good size. 
I had the hot dog with everything and it was good but the bun was a little soggy. 
The bathrooms were clean and the staff was really friendly!"}
{"text":"Just took my son for lunch here. Placed our order and tried to use a coupon code for  $5 off $15 or more. Manager gave me some BS about being an online coupon. Meanwhile, they mail these same coupons to area residents, I just didn't have it with me.  Is it all that difficult to make the transaction?  Whatever happened to the customer is always right? Now, instead of a happy returning customer, you have an upset one who won't be returning any time soon. On top of all of that, they had a fly problem buzzing around the pickup window. That's two strikes for management. 

I would be remiss if I did not point out the shinning stars of the restaurant. Obviously the cooks, as the food was tasty as always. Payson, our cashier, not only helpful but extremely polite. My favorite of all, would be the young lady running the pickup window. Smiling,  hard working and thorough. Advance her to manager and move the manager back down to toilets."}
{"text":"First visit after seeing it there for awhile. I tried a hot dog, beef sandwich with mozzarella, and a piece of the limited time lemon cake. The hot dog was killer, nice snap to the dog and generous on the toppings (sans relish for me just can't hang with the weird chopped sweet pickles in a little goo). So it's a Chicago place so you don't order a hot dog Chicago style. There it's just a hot dog. Like in China it's not Chinese food, it's food! Anyway, the dill spear was big and maybe sogged the bun a bit but I liked it that way. Definitely would recommend it and at like $3 a good deal. I'd probably get 2 or try the jumbo one if you're not getting sides, etc. The Italian beef was really good. Got it dry with the gravy on the side at the suggestion of my order taker. Gravy is like beef jus, not like thick and flour-y. Not too salty so good on that. Bread was still crispy upon arrival at home. Delicious iced tea. Dessert. Lemon cake with lemon butter cream frosting. Good ratio without over frosting the cake. Love that there's a drive through. They were hopping today so they did the thing where they take your order with folks outside. Great service and quick. Eat it. You like beef. If you don't, well we may no longer be friends. They have salad and it's probably good. But why would you?"}
{"text":"Very upsetting  experience! We were at the drive thru,  they have an extensive menu and it hasn't even been 2 minutes when the lady started rushing is to go complete the order at the window. I mean I didn't know it was required to already know what you want when you just pulled up to the menu st a drive thru.  The woman at the drive thru kept interrupting my husband saying \" I can't understand what you're saying, go to the window to order\" in a not so friendly manner.  My husband asked if he could have a second to look at the menu, she said go to the window. Needless to say we got to the window,  my husband asked for a menu since we were rushed through,  they don't have printed ones,  the guy said to go to portillos.com to see the menu. My husband said well I couldn't order because I was trying to look at the menu at the drive thru, but was rushed to the window. So the guy told us \"well you had seven cars behind you! \". Seriously? What type of lame excuse, if they don't want to have a line, don't  have a drive thru. Then the irony is they said Pull up and park and we'll take the food out to you. So I am expected to wait but they can't?! Ten minutes later we got our food, no napkins or anything. One star for food tasting good. Work on your drive thru manners."}
{"text":"I had the Italian beef, it was good, not great about the same quality as a bar. Their drive thru is fast and they have a good variety."}
{"text":"This place is h-u-g-e. That being said, the line moves quickly so don't let long lines get you down.

I had the italian beef sandwich. The only reason I didn't give this place 4 stars is because they didn't have provolone cheese. Coming from the east coast, this is a real disappointment. 

I'll come back and try the dogs next time. But maybe i'll order the beef sandwich again but bring my own cheese"}
{"text":"Order the Italian beef sandwich with sweet and hot peppers and extra gravy. If you are still hungry go get a chicago dog and a shake. This isn't fine dining."}
{"text":"Not sure what else to say. The hotdogs are the best in the world.

I also like their Italian beef sandwiches with sweet pepper."}
{"text":"Best hot dogs in the world. Their Italian Beef sandwiches are very good as well. So happy that these restaurants have followed midwesterners out to Phoenix."}
{"text":"I had dinner at this place with a group of people tonight and I guess this was not my kind of food. 
I ordered apple walnut salad and request NO romaine & iceberg lettuce and the guy said NO we can't do that. 
I was like, why and he kept saying no we can't do that (I saw bowl of spinach in the salad bar area as we were talking) and they kept saying NO we can't do that, what ever!

I ended up ordered grill vegetable sandwich and it was ok."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Saturday evening with a party of 8. We were lucky enough to hit it between the waves of people. Between everyone in our group, we had italian beef, hot dogs, cheeseburger, a salad, and chicken fingers for the kids. The general consensus- its good. Is it worth the drive from Gilbert? probably not. The prices are good, they move people through at a fast pace so even if the line seems long it moves pretty quickly. I think that there are other places out there who do hot dogs and italian beef just as well, its more the experience that makes Portillo's special."}
{"text":"Went here with a group of 9 before an ASU vball game. It's a good place to grab a bite for such occasions. They have plenty of seating, enough selection for families and relatively fast service even when super busy on a Saturday night. The food is ok, but take this as a fast food joint, not 5 star food. Italian beef, cake shake and fries are top of the list, but they offer salads, smoothies and chicken sandwiches that are decent. I lived in Chicago, so for me it's about nostalgia, but I'm staying in the 3's none the less."}
{"text":"OMG, OMG from my very own Chicago! A size of Chicago with real Chicago dogs & the wonderful chopped salad. 

Every town needs a Portillos! Their Chicago dogs are authentic including the bright green relish!

The chopped salad is exactly as we get it in Chicago. 

And the sweet people who clean up after you. Surely makes me miss Chicago."}
{"text":"My first time coming here and it was amazing. Awesome service. Super fast. Clean! One of the friendliest genuinely happy staffs. 

Not to mention the food was delicious. Fresh and very filling. Fries were hot crispy and nicely salted. Burger was charbroiled to perfection and super juicy. 

Thanks for the awesome experience! Highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Sitting here having lunch and the food is outstanding. Very good customer service, they actually verify you credit card which nowadays is needed and anyone that gets annoyed by that is silly. Food was prompt and seating was plenty outside and in. First went to one of these outside of Chi-Town a few years back and this one doesn't miss a trick. Spot on food in the way you expect and want."}
{"text":"Great food and good atmosphere. Really enjoy eating here on occasion."}
{"text":"I'm 100% biased on this one as I'm from Illinois. I could eat here everyday if cholesterol, blood sugar and morbid obesity were not a factor.  Their hotdogs are can't lose.  They serve Chicago dogs on a poppy seed bun.  I like mine with onion, pickle, celery salt and mustard; they almost always come out spot on. They have a million different options but that's how I've been eating them since I was a kid.  I will ocasionally switch it up and get a chili cheese dog with onions. The chili dogs are good but often hard to eat due to the massive amount of chili.  Anyway, they take you back to being in the city.  The big difference is the people in Arizona are much more friendly than in Chicago.  As previous posters have mentioned, their cheese fries are killer.  They are crinkle cut fries with what has to be an imitation cheese sauce but it is delicious. I would drink the sauce if my wife wouldn't judge me.   I can't recommend portillo's enough. The service is always great and it's hard to not leave full. Portillo's Italian beef is also very tasty, I recommend trying it with extra gravy, not dipped, and with hot peppers."}
{"text":"My husband tried a double cheese burger and it was huge. The meat was tasty and cooked perfectly but the bun couldn't hold up with everything going on inside. If you don't mind a mess and soggy bun you will find the burger to be juicy and flavorful. 

I ordered the Chicken Pecan Salad. The dressing was a honey dijon. It was very sticky and hard to evenly distribute onto the salad. I might go there again but try a different item. 

We also ordered onion rings and a vanilla shake. Both were good but not any better than the Habit onion rings or In and Out Shakes."}
{"text":"Hmmm... This review is probably one of the most difficult to write. 

I live within 3 miles of this restaurant. I have driven past many times and always wondered what it was about.  when I saw the reviews on yelp I thought it was worth a try.

However I really don't understand why people would give this four stars. It's a cheap and not very good burger joint... With some hot dogs and want to be sausages.

I ordered it Thai and meet and sausage sandwich... And it was just a big soggy nasty mess. Not very appetizing and not very good at all.

The french fries are like you buy from the store frozen Oreda. They're not well cooked or well seasoned or unique at all.  

The salad bar is a joke... It looks like a mess and not very good options or tasty offerings.

The hamburgers are plain and disgusting. Not much thought no uniqueness. It's not even as good as cooking at home.

The chocolate cake was disgusting.

 People will review saying it's cheap and good... But it's not even cheap. You and up paying nearly 5 bucks for a hamburger and fries. Smash burger is far better for the same money.

I really have a hard time understanding what people see in this place."}
{"text":"Portillos has always been a great place and a family favorite. However, this time it wasnt so great. We just left having lunch there and while we were waiting for our food the power goes out. Needless to say what we got was far from standard. 

My burger was completely burnt and hard with a hard slab of cold cheese. The fries were ok but instead of the coke i ordered i got a rootbeer and was told thats all we've got. I hate rootbeer. My father in laws and fiances food was decent but they didnt get their correct drinks either. 

I understand these things happen and sometimes it's out of your control but what is in control is how you handle the situation. You dont tell your customers sorry it's all we've got take it or leave it and you certainly don't have your employees laughing about the situation and commenting about how they can't believe this is the 3rd time this has happened. 

If this has happened before i would hope that you would prepare and get some back up generators or something for emergencies like this and it would have been nice if the management gave us a coupon or some sort of discount for next time since we didn't even get what we ordered. Again i love this place and love the food normally. This was an unfortunate situation that was handled extremely poorly."}
{"text":"Hands down the only place in town to get an actual Chicago style beef sandwich. I usually get mine with extra Giardiniera, which is an Italian relish of pickled veggies in a nice oil/vinegar mix which has a nice little spicy kick to it, extra gravy( basically very flavorful au-jus) on the side as well as a little bit put on my sandwich. I don't prefer the wet style, which is where they dunk your sandwich practically, as I'm not a fan of soggy bread. The place is pretty damn big, as I can imagine it needs to be in order to seat all the Cubs fans who come out here for spring training and want a little piece of home when they go out for lunch or dinner. Seems kid friendly and they also serve beer as well. The hotdogs look amazing as well. If you have the appetite for it, try a combo. You'll get your beef sandwich with a sausage on top! If you haven't tried a Chicago beef sandwich, I'd suggest you head over here as I'm sure you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Food quality is still on-point, but pleaseeeeee - rethink the \"Food Pickup\" step of your restaurant's model. 

Granted, I've visited during peak lunch-rush hours during weekdays, but the system fails (in my opinion) during this time, and I'm still worked up about it, almost 3 hrs later.

Picture a lot of bodies crammed together (shoulder-to-shoulder) akin to sardines in a tin can, but still being lightly nudged by staff to \"Clear the path\". I can understand the need of the request and fire hazard risk, but there's nowhere else to stand! Would you like us to make friends with the folks dining at the long table behind this waiting area? 

Lastly, consider a better (louder/clearer) PA system if you \"announce\" all food orders. Why? Unless I'm going completely deaf at the ripe age of 40, I couldn't hear a damn thing, Portillo's. For real. Or, turn down the retro/boogie-woogie tunes in the background because it certainly interferes with the call-outs. Lastly, why don't you do call-outs for ppl waiting (since there's no room inside) on the patio? 

Ok, I'll jump off soapbox now and avoid you from 11a-2p (to be safe), M-F. Deuces."}
{"text":"The Scottsdale store is just as good as the Chicago store. Italian beef, sweet, hot peppers and dipped.....boom!"}
{"text":"Portillo's has to be the best place for lunch ever! I love the Italian beef w/ sweet peppers, cheeseburger, hot dog and onion rings. I even tried the tamale at the same time.
If I lived closer, then I would come here every week. The food is exactly the same as it was in Chicago. Excellent!"}
{"text":"Coming to one of my favorite place from Chicago, Portillo's I love it!!!  I'm so glad it's here in Arizona!  Awesome service and great food!"}
{"text":"Been here before. I always seem to forget why I hate coming here, since their food is good.  Oh, yes it's their service.  

Every time I've come, the service is lousy. The cashiers are really rude, they rush your order,  and treat you like you're inconveniencing them by ordering.

Today, we had this wonderful cashier named Brianna. She kept barking our order into the mic as we were still trying to order, and missed half our order. I kept having to repeat myself and the more I had to correct because she wasn't paying attention, the worse her attitude got. 

Our order came out without my daughter's burger. She didn't add that to the order. So, we had to stand in line again.  Thanks. 

Maybe we'll stick to the drive-thru here."}
{"text":"Many options other than just hot dogs. Try the chopped salad or the chocolate cake shake. All amazing!"}
{"text":"I've been going to portillo's for over 20 years. It's so sad to see the service and quality of the food go down the drain in the last 2 years. Not only is the customer service horrible at this location but the food is not the same quality I grew up on back in Chicago. As a long time portillos fan I always look forward going back home to
Chicago to get excellent service. Hopefully they fix their ways here but who knows since the manager doesn't seem to care.

It's official they have changed their cheese. It's awful!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Sometimes I just have to splurge!  Chocolate malt and Jumbo hot dog - that's my go to at this spot. Hubby likes their polish best. Great spot before the ASU basketball game!"}
{"text":"Loved the food! Hot dogs was good, thinking I'll get two next time! I'm a fries type of person as well, so the fries were on point as well! I'd go again, nice place for a great lunch."}
{"text":"Absolutely AMAZING customer service. The service I received today on a messed up order that I wasn't even mad about was impeccable. The staff went out of their way to correct things before they were even an issue and it was very appreciated!"}
{"text":"I am writing this as a born-and-bred Chicagoan who used to go to a Portillo's location at least once a week before I relocated to Tempe--it is EXACTLY the same as \"back home\" with 2 exceptions (which I will get to later).  Construction and ambiance--exactly the same.  Burgers and fries--exactly the same.  Milkshakes--exactly the same.  Maxwell Street Polish--EXACTLY THE SAME--thank you God and Dick Portillo for FINALLY bringing a real, bona-fide Maxwell Street Polish (read:  Chicago classic) out here to the desert!  

The two exceptions that may put Chicagoans off:  1.) staff is very well-trained, but they are not Chicagoans, don't understand the \"passion\" of the food, and although they show great potential don't seem to have the same \"write on the bag, move on, pay, and pickup\" expertise as they do back home.  2.) space-case, self-absorbed Scottsdale patrons who don't know how to order or to KEEP THE PICKUP AREA OPEN AND CLEAR whilst waiting for their food.

For those \"meh\" reviews by AZ natives--you have NO CONCEPT of a hot dog, Polish sausage, or Italian Beef, and you REALLY need to keep your purportedly-\"expert\" opinions to yourselves.  Ted's is NY style--so there is no comparison.  Other locations here in Phoenix--not the same.

PS to the dipstick who said this is a \"chain\" restaurant--it is NOT.  Dick Portillo and family are the sole owners (and will always keep it this way) and visit each location multiple times per year to ensure that every \"branch\" is just as good as the original.  As for them being \"sure to fail unless the food quality improves;\" the food is the SAME as it is in Chicago, and to the best of my knowledge no Portillo's location has ever failed since Dick first opened shop in the 1960's.  So you might want to do a little research (and actually be from Chicago) before you run off at the yap with your idiotic opinions.

Bottom line:  Chicagoans--go and shed a tear of joy as you have a taste of home.  Smug Non-Chicagoans who have never been to Chi-town and have no clue as to what you are talking about--shut the F up."}
{"text":"Expanding out west into \"double L\" territory maybe confusing but let me clarify...\"Portillo's\" is pronounced, \"Por-till-lows\". Being a Chicago native I am familiar with the Portillo's name and the quality food and customer service they provide. I have since moved to Phoenix, Arizona and while I'm thrilled they opened \"The Chicago Staple\" out west, I have some concerns. 

The employees seemed indifferent. No one seemed enthusiastic about their jobs or provided exceptional customer service. Because I'm watching my waist line I asked for nutritional information, but none could be produced or provided. 

Although the service is subpar the food is excellent. They have a wide variety of fresh salads (my personal favorite is the Chopped Salad). However, if you're willing to splurge you can't go wrong with an Italian Beef and piece of chocolate cake!"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints.
I don't go here often but it always puts a smile on my face when I get sloppy with the Big Beef Sandwich with both hot and sweet peppers and side of Gravy.  If the Beef and Cheddar Croissant could hold more beef and not fall apart when it gets dipped then I would definitely say its the perfect sandwich.  Being a man who respects Chicago Style beef and sandwiches, this place is probably the best Phoenix has to offer.  
I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a hearty meal with great Chicago style food."}
{"text":"Really Good Italian Beef and for a reasonable price. No need for cheese but add the Hot Giardinara. Not sure about the Dogs never had one and curious to know why it's called a Hot Dog spot everyone I know,talked too, and the two customers ahead of me ordered the beef.  Might try their Dogs one day."}
{"text":"This place absolutely rocks. Even with all the volume that they do they always seem to give good service and the food is just kick ass. When I come here I normally get the Italian sausage on a hot dog bun but some hot peppers it is the only real Italian sausage in the city. I also recently gotten the hot beef sandwich because that too is just killer with The hot peppers. Can't forget to get some french fries with it as well. I'm glad it is a bunch of locations everywhere and it's also good that they're open till 11 o'clock at night. the end"}

{"text":"Portillo's italian beef is amazing! I only get to stop by once a year when visiting AZ for spring training but I've never had a bad meal or bad service here!

On my most recent trip we went through the drive-thru and I saved my dry italian beef sandwich for a day or longer before eating it; the sandwich was still great and the bread had plenty of integrity despite being in the fridge for that long!"}
{"text":"Pretty great food. It's really just popular for being the chain it is. It's a little chaotic and always full, but it's a great experience. I've tried quite a few of the items and been here multiple times, so here are my reviews for them.
Chili cheese hotdog: Great! Chock full of cheese, chili, and onions. The hotdogs are great quality and the buns are soft, and delicious. Make sure to get the jumbo size! Definitley a lot bigger, but not too much more expensive.

Regular Hotdog: Just okay. I guess I'm not fans of any chicago dogs, but on the bright side, the thing was very full!

Italian Beef: MMMM!! What can I even say? The first bite was a little weird, but as I kept eating, it got more and more amazing!! The beef is perfectly cooked, and almost buttery tasting, and has a little kick of heat. THe flavor is seriously amazing, and bread compliments it perfectly. And for those who complain it's soggy, it's dipped in the juices! If you don't like it, ask for it \"Dry\" 

Cheese Fries: The fries are quite generic, but they're cooked perfectly crispy, and the inside is very soft. The cheese, as always, is great.

Burgers: They're pretty great. But why would you order a burger at Portillos? Good, but not recommended unless you're not a fan of anything else here.

Chopped Salad: Pretty good. But still, not worth it.  It has a very unique flavor and a nice sweet tang. Probably not worth getting again.

Chocolate cake shake: Just okay, great for chocolate lovers, but too sweet in my taste.

Overall, if you're a hotdog fan and looking for a great hotdog in the valley, this is defintley recommended. I also recommend the italian beef. One thing about this place is that it can add up to be a bit pricey if you order a few things."}
{"text":"I hated traveling to Phoenix.  I have to for business but I hated traveling to a town like the one I live in, where they have no food identity.  That has changed since Portillos came to town, I loved going to them in Chicago, excellent Italian beef and great dogs., and now I can get it in in Tempe/Scottsdale, makes traveling here a little more bearble."}
{"text":"Food is great for 3 people 23.00 the best hot dogs place ever. Been to this location twice. The staff is nice... Nice location lots place shop then sat they need to turn music up loud"}
{"text":"From 1977 2 1998 I lived in Bolingbrook Illinois, few years later in the 80's Portillos open a restaurant there. they served Vienna products and were the top dog and polish sausage anywhere. In 2003 I moved to Arizona, at Portillos moved in a year or so ago . I was thrilled at first because as I said they were the top dog in Chicago area. Well obviously here in Arizona that all came to a stop. the products they serve now are garbage no longer Vienna here in Arizona at least not sure about Illinois obviously to save a buck , and the dogs polish beef are no longer the same. I can get a better be hot dog a Polish sausage at Chicago land hot dogs in Mesa, they use high end Vienna products like Portillos used to. Don't let the conglomerate that is now Portillos take your money for an inferior product."}

{"text":"I have been going to Portillos for over forty years, the original one in Illinois.  I couldn't wait for the one to open in Scottsdale.  At first it was great. Now it has gone down hill.  I heard that they changed owners and I believe it now.  The quality of the whole business is down.  The food now is hit or miss.  I went on Monday, the 28th. The person who took my order was rude, seems like we were annoying her.  Ordered a beef, had to bring it back because the bun was extremely hard and wasn't even seasoned right. The hotdog wasn't even good and they are not Vienna, like another person wrote on a review. The worst of all were the restrooms. They were filthy. I had to tell someone about it.  Looks like I'll have to try another place serving food from Chicago."}
{"text":"Having lived in Illinois, I'm so so so happy that they have Portillo's in Scottsdale. Best things to get when you're there: Italian beef with sweet peppers, Italian sausage, (if both the Italian beef and sausage sound good to you, don't pick between them, just get the Combo!), the Chicago Style dog. However, you absolutely cannot leave Portillo's without trying their famous chocolate cake. If you're on the go, definitely get the chocolate cake shake."}
{"text":"I could write a huge review about how much I love Portillo's, but I'm going to write a short review, which doesn't mean I love it any less, just that it's simple...I love this place!

I admit I'm addicted to their burgers and fries. I could easily come here all the time and be content with my life. I don't even think about other fast food joints anymore. Love it!! I have yet to try their desserts and shakes, but they look tasty! The food is so fresh. Burgers are delicious. Crinkle fries are crispy with the right amount of salt, topped off with a coke and I'm in burger heaven! Lucky I don't live too far from this location!"}
{"text":"Literally the best cheeseburger I've ever had....Too bad I can't eat cheeseburgers very often...But, Portillo's burgers and dogs is awesome."}
{"text":"Ever since visiting Chicago, I've had dreams of a delicious Chicago style dog with sport peppers (which is the most important component). I randomly stumbled upon this place and was pleasantly surprised to find the key to satisfying my inner Chicago needs. 

At the end of the day, it was a pretty basic and generic dog. Sometimes people just don't understand how much further along a grilled dog would get a guy versus just a boiled one. But what bumped this up from a 3 to 4 star for me was the environment. It's a really cool place and I'm excited to try something different next time."}
{"text":"First time going to Portillo's at the recommendation of friends. Loved it and went back the next day. The Italian beef, chili dogs, fries, onion rings, and malt - all delicious. The kids were not big fans of the hot dogs, but no big deal. Overall really good place for the grown ups!"}
{"text":"It was just good. I had a chili dog and a tamale... the tamale was weird by South West standards... but, pretty good."}
{"text":"Three stars was pushing it. You wait in a long line and some dude gives you an order form. Then you wait again for your food. Now I have lots of friends from the Chicago area and this is their comfort food. We tried a dog and a Italian Beef. The Italian Beef was what we in Jersey call a French Dip. But the bun was soggy and the a jous was really oily and watery, really without much flavor. The dog was just average. But I can have average for 50 cents in my yard, so why go out? SO I give it three because my middle USA friends get their hometown thing and I get mine. Its all about sharing, caring and inner peace, right?"}
{"text":"Tried this place one time a few weeks ago for dinner around 8pm and it was good.  Its nothing super special but its good.  Ordered the cheese fries, strawberry malt shake, chili cheese dog and the italian beef and sausage sandwich extra wet.  The fries were good with the cheese dip, it was kind of like nacho cheese.  The sandwich had sweet peppers and onions and she added cheese for us,  mozzarella I believe and that was hearty but the flavor was very mild, really thought it would have a heavy flavor impact.  The chili dog according to the BF was good since he ate it all. That hotdog we ordered with grilled onions. Now the malt shake... that was really good.  Could really taste the malt in it!! Didnt have room to try the desserts but looked really good!
Cute atmosphere and love the decor.  The staff was very friendly and really enjoyed dinning in!"}
{"text":"This place is great!  I get the Italian Beef sandwich and cheese fries every time.  Everyone I have taken here has loved it.  A Chicago staple that I am so glad came to the valley."}
{"text":"After shopping at Fry's, my husband and I decided to grab dinner at Portillo's. We had never been to a Portillo's previously and wanted to try it.  We contemplated parking and going in or using the drive-thru. We saw several employees standing outside with headsets and such; we were concerned something was wrong with the telecom system that most drive-thru places use. We decided to chance it and use the drive-thru. 

When we pulled up, a friendly employee greeted us and asked to take our order. We explained that this was our first time, so she handed us two menus. I decided to get the chili cheese dog and my husband decided on the Maxwell Street Style Polish dog. We both decided on onion rings. The employee told us to drive around and pay at the second window. Again, there were several employees outside waiting to take our money and hand us our food. They were all very friendly so I asked why they were standing outside. Apparently this is what they do! All day, every day - unless it's really busy and not efficient to do so. Call me crazy, but this was totally bizarre to me. It was a very hot day, but AZ can get scorching during the summer. Let's hope they are inside on those days! 

Our food was prepared quickly and we took it home to enjoy. My chili cheese dog was really good - everything was flavorful and the bun was soft. I had a bite of my husband's and it was really good too! I couldn't decide which I liked better. The onion rings were good but I probably wouldn't order them again. (They had more bread than onion - the ratio was off.) 

Looking through the menu more closely, they have a lot of items to choose from. I'll definately be back to try more!"}
{"text":"The hot dogs here, as expected, are very good, but the beef sandwiches are better. My favorite here is the Italian Beef Combo with extra gravy, throw in some fries and a cold drink and lunch is served. Or dinner, I'm not terribly picky about what/when I eat."}
{"text":"Best food ever.  Everything tastes good and the chocolate cake is top notch.  You cannot go wrong.  Eat and enjoy."}
{"text":"We had a large tennis team. Very quick service, polite and friendly staff.The best hotdog I have ever had! I got the regular hotdog and a fruit salad with poppyseed dressing.  Would defiantly recommend going here."}
{"text":"I can't give it a 5 star because it does not have a kids meal. This place needs kids meals! The food was really delicious. I had their hot beef and was not disappointed. I think it is a bit ridiculous to pay extra for the peppers and not be told about it but the sandwich was great. My daughter enjoyed the plain hot dog as well."}
{"text":"I'm so thrilled Portillo's opened a location here in Phoenix.  I'm from Chicago and there is nothing like a great Italian Beef.  We travel here (30 miles each way) frequently.  It's that good."}
{"text":"my family is from Villa Park where it all started. Family couldnt believe when these opened up in cali or Arizona. They remember eating from the trailer. 
There is nothing bad here, beef sandwiches, hot dogs, salads, crossiants,  love the french fries,, nothing is bad.. I also get the cake shake but without the chocolate syrup."}
{"text":"One of those places that just hits the spot. I would give it 5 stars, but sometimes the portions and quality are not consistent."}
{"text":"Fast service but food is over rated. Their beef sandwich is ok, I've had better. Surprisingly, their fish sandwich is delish....crispy yet moist."}
{"text":"I wish the food was a little more spicy but I'll have to give 5 stars cause I know Tempe is full of p;$;@s."}
{"text":"I went there when you first opened and the  Italian beef was good, but the portion was very small, barely filled the bun.  I am from Illinois and I love Portillos , but they have to increase the portions size. I will check out the one in Tempe when they open. I live in Phoenix and wish there was one closer to me. 

Marsha in Phoenix"}
{"text":"I had the Italian beef and sausage combo.  As always it was delicious!  Always a good time and great food at this place.  Friendly staff and quick service are one of their staples."}
{"text":"I have not been to Portillos for maybe a year. Thought I would give it another chance. The beef sandwich was so uninteresting. I don't understand why their beef sandwiches have a fine reputation. Without paying for our condiments, it is just an average bun with standard beef on it. I bought extra gravy. That was a good addition. It must be other items which pull in the crowds."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to stop off for lunch. The drive thru had a lot of cars so we decided to dine in. Our cashier was Merry, but her face said a different thing, She was through and precise.

I had two Chicago dogs and better half had the Italian Beef Sandwich which she said was very good. It must have been, because she devoured the whole sandwich. We ordered french fries and onion rings, but after tasting the onion rings, I should have ordered a large. The coating and texture was beautiful and the crunch was amazing, not too hard and not too soft. Betcha' can't eat just one.

We were both satisfied and looking forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"First things first. I am saddened by the fact they refuse to offer sauerkraut ! Apparently that's not an Illinois thing! But I do love their menu overall: I try to be sodium friendly and though this is not, I would recommend the salads they have.
I wish that they had a few more  locations throughout the Valley but Tempe is a good location. It is busy here still after the grand opening and it may be a good thing to consider a late lunch to avoid some of the crowd."}
{"text":"Good quick spot for lunch. The service is fast and efficient while the food is on the top scale of fast made to order food."}
{"text":"Perhaps because I'm usually hungover when I go, I always forget to check in and thus, I 've not yelped about this yet.  Unacceptable.

I lived in Chicago.  I love me some Portillo's. I was one of the baffoons there on Opening Day.  And let me tell you, I'm glad Portillo's is here now.  

This is a well known and revered Chicago establishment.  They are primarily known for their hot dogs (chili cheese!!) and Italian Beef sandwiches.  NO, the beef is not a cheesesteak. This isn't Philly.  

The fries are old school and the cheese is REAL, not 'orange'.

I'm a huge fan of the Chocolate Cake Shake.. think chocolate shake with cake in it. Sounds gross.. tastes great.  

I mix it up time to time and I recently got a burger there.  My hangover craved it.  Hand made and hand pressed, and grilled to perfection.

POrtillo's is delicious and unhealthy food. I know they have salads, but what's the point?!  Go for the dogs and beef and be sure to get an order of cheese fries and a shake."}
{"text":"Was asked by this location to hold a fundraiser for our girls softball team. had all the families communicate to family and friends to come out and support. The girls spent time getting their friends to come out. All of the families came that night. Did not find out until after that we only get proceeds if they mentioned the fundraiser at check out. Was never told this until the night was over. Portillo's has told us their is nothing they can do!  Zero dollars for the fundraiser because they did not tell us the details. DO NOT SUPPORT THEM!"}
{"text":"I don't eat beef so I was thinking I was going to miss out.  But lo and behold, boy was I wrong.  This place has got one huge menu of choices which usually I'd frown upon but this place seems to be doing pretty good.  I had their char-grilled italian sausage and it was darn yummy.  GOt it with gianderia which are pickled hot veggies.  They weren't as spicy as I like but it was still good.  But there was something about the sausage that was yummy.  Their bread was perfectly crusty and homemade.  I think they lightly dip the bread in the drippings just enough to really flavor it.  It tasted buttery good.  My bf got the same thing and a chicago hot dog.  He said the sausage was so much better.  Made me glad I wasn't missing out on the hot dog :). For you vegetarians, they had options for you too.  THere is a veggie sandwich which looked really good.  They've got salads here too.  Overall, pretty good first experience.  But darn crowded and we came on a Monday out of all days!"}
{"text":"Reminds me of back where I grew up in South Chicago! I love Portillos and was happy to see they had an operation in Phoenix area ! Tasted exactly the same as the Chicagoland locations!"}
{"text":"I had a Bacon Cheese Burger w/ Fries and it was great!!!! The wait to get my food was a bit longer than I expected but it was worth the wait. The burger was more than enough and the fries were tasty. The atmosphere was like an amusement park. Everyone (customer/employee) were very pleasant. Give it a try, I think you will enjoy it."}
{"text":"Midwest inspired, enjoy hot dogs on a poppyseed bun, burgers, sausages, and other sandwiches. Portillo's offers a drive-thru service as well as a very large indoor/outdoor seating area to enjoy the food. The crinkle cut fries are a must, and expect your hot dog to be served Chicago style (sport peppers, onions, celery salt, etc.) but they can make it the way you like. We visited Portillo's on a Saturday around 1:30p and the place was packed. It's extremely noisy so the ordering process was a little annoying. Be prepared to shout what you want during busy hours. It's also hard to hear your order number called out. It's all counter service, but the folks behind the counters seemed friendly enough. There are \"stewards\" near the ordering line to help first timers figure out the menu. I saw a pretty decent salad station that seemed to make some pretty nice looking salads if you want to watch the calories. We'd come back- the price was right... $21 for a family of 3. They also serve malts and shakes, those looked to be a popular item. The patio is decent sized and had space heaters for the cooler weather. I'd bet this place is really popular during MLB spring training season with all the snowbirds. Have fun!"}
{"text":"I went through the drive thru to order some food for myself and a co-worker.  Pulled in and before the guy could take my order I told him I wanted to make two orders and pay for them separately, both with a CC. Guy told me I couldn't do that.  I was like why.  He said that they don't do that.  By this time, I was stuck with 5 cars behind and in front of me. I was was pretty pissed off.  Every other fast food joint will allow this, why not portillos???  HEY PORTILLOS, IF YOU WON'T ALLOW SPLIT TRANSACTIONS, PUT SOME KIND OF FUCKING SIGN BEFORE THE DRIVE THRU LANE.  THIS WAY I DON'T SIT THERE WASTING MY FUCKING TIME.  It is 2018 dipshitz, get with the program."}
{"text":"Great location. Large, clean, restaurant. Crinkle fries were solid but the hot dog didn't live up to what I know is available in Chicago. The ingredients are correct. But the balance and execution of the hot dog isn't as good as it should be. I'm hoping the other traditional menu items are better."}
{"text":"Decent food, but the hotdogs/polish dogs were a huge disappointment!  Small polish with a few grilled onions and mustard for $4?!  Onion rings and fries are good.  Hubby ordered the Italian beef, the meat itself really did not have any flavor (even needed salt), I told him next time he needs to get it dipped in the sauce.  My son had a burger and it was pretty tasty.
Had to order the famous chocolate cake.  It was good, but I've definitely had better.
Super fun atmosphere, the kids loved it.  I'd come back if I was in the area again."}
{"text":"Love the Italian Beef and Onion Rings.  I don't ever order anything else.  My family has gotten hotdogs, hamburgers, & fries and no complaints from them on the taste of the food.   
Only complaint is I've been thru the drive thru 3 times now and twice they have forgotten something in my order.  Seems they are trying to rush the order out the window.  So the only thing I would suggest is someone to double check the contents of the bags before passing them out the window.  I try to remember to check mine but with big orders it's easy to overlook a missing item."}
{"text":"Loved Portillos since the first time I've had one of their beef sandwiches in Chicago over 20 years ago. I was really happy to see they had opened a couple in the Valley of the Sun.  My old standbys are the Italian beef sandwich with green peppers, the hamburger, and their hotdogs.  The beef sandwiches can be hit or miss depending on when you go in.  When they're good, they can't be beat, when they're not so good they're still better than most any place in Phoenix.
Warning about the chocolate cake shake!  I love the chocolate cake and I like the shakes.  But putting them together.... Well, imagine Portillos chocolate cake in a cup with a little milkshake mixed in.  Saying it's rich doesn't even come close to describing it.  If you're into a super sweet super rich milkshake, Go for it.... But be warned, it's really sweet... I could only drink a third of it."}
{"text":"Walked in anxious to finally try this place! It's so much more than hotdogs. We ordered the big beef with motz/ peppers and the beef cheddar croissant, cheese fries, onion rings with a strawberry malt. Let me start by saying it was everything I expected. The food was amazing! The strawberry malt was made with real strawberries! It was so good my son wanted a 2nd big beef. Ono food Portillo's! Thanks for the new addiction!!!"}
{"text":"Never had Portillos before. Heard a great recommendation from a big fan who was visiting AZ from OH. Talked them up big time.. surprise!!!

We got a Chicago Hot Dog and the Jumbo Chilli Cheese Hot Dog with a side of onion rings.

Just slop on a bun with a frank basically! Was awful. Served in a paper wrapper that basically had all the chilli squeezed from the bun. Was everywhere! I was almost not going to eat it as it looked terrible.

The buns were either microwaved or steamed, but they were extremely soggy! The onions rings however were nice - cooked perfectly! Crunchy and tasty! Can't get these wrong I guess when you deep fry right?

Disappointing that the staff take no pride in how they present their food (hot dogs) to the paying customer! 
If I hadn't been through the drive through, I would have asked for my money back!

Won't be back unfortunately!"}
{"text":"Like many other misplaced Chicagoland natives who somehow settled in the valley, the little things are what I miss the most.  One of those little things are the amazing hot dog and italian beef restaurants all over the city and its sprawling suburbs.  Portillo's not only was one of my favorite of those places, but it was the one that my brother and I would ride our bikes over to so we could get a cheap and delicious lunch before hitting up a movie on a random summer afternoon.  With that kind of nostalgic expectations, Portillo's in Scottsdale had a lot to live up to, and guess what?  They hit the mark with a perfect bullseye.

A jumbo hot dog with everything on it (like a good Chicago place even an Arizona Portillo's knows that means no ketchup unless specifically requested), fries, and a piece of chocolate cake!  The 10 year old me, who ate this meal more times than I can even try to remember, couldn't have been any happier.  The dog is pretty much what I remember loving as a kid.  The bun was a lot soggier than it should be, which resulted in the very fresh condiments falling out, but I can forgive that.  The fries were the perfectly crispy \"crinkly\" fries that the best places always served.  The cake was perfectly moist and scrumptious with the very sweet [and unnecessarily too much] frosting that I couldn't get enough of as a child.  My fiancÃ© had the italian beef.  Awesome.  Make sure to order it dipped.  Messy but flavorful.  She also ordered cheese fries (they just give you a container of some cheese sauce that I couldn't stop dipping my fries into).  By the way; the food is cheap!  All that and two soft drinks was only a little more than $20.00.

The line out the door was expected, and even a little daunting, at 6:30 on the Friday night following the grand opening.  The good news; It moved fast.  We got our food and found a table in a little over a half hour.  If that can be done in the first week, then the pace will certainly speed up when the excitement starts to ware down.  If you're not already a Portillo's fan, you may want to wait a few weeks for the hype to die down before you give the place a try.

It's not like there was a shortage of Chicago hot dog and italian beef places around the valley.  But Portillo's is certainly a top notch addition."}
{"text":"My husband and I always go for the best Chicago beef sandwiches!!!yum"}
{"text":"My husband's a picky eater and it's hard to find a place we both enjoy. This place hits the spot for both of us. The burgers are yum, fries are perfection, salads are awesome, and don't get me started on the shakes and chocolate cake. I just wish there was a Portillo's in the east valley. 
The atmosphere is very family friendly and employees are very upbeat. The prices are kinda high for for a fast food joint, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"I loved this place. Great hot dogs. Their signature dog sounded so strange to me, since I'm a mustard and ketchup kind of person, but it was amazing! I don't recommend the onion rings but the French fries and milk shakes are bomb!"}
{"text":"Wow this place was great !!! The food the cashier this is the second time I've been here same location . My Brother in law took me here for supper he's from  Chicago and loves the place back home . I had the cheesesteak with hot peppers and dipped I'm not used to it dipped ( they are dipping it in the juice that the meat came out of ) the fries were great and the desserts Amazing !! I'm only giving it a 4 star because the lady at the desserts always  ignores me  she is to busy with her co workers talking to wait on me so therefore I have to wait and wait and wait"}
{"text":"The Jumbo Hot Dog hit the spot.  I'm not much of a hot dog fan, but the combination of the crunchy pickles, fresh onions and tomatoes, and peppers engulfing the hot dog on warm, soft bun was satisfying. +4/5 for the dog.

I had high expectations for the Italian Beef Sandwich, as previous tasters made me want to be a believer.  Perhaps my tastes were spoiled by other types of dipped sandwiches, like at Philippe's or The Hat, but I was not impressed with Portillo's offering.  I had mine topped with sweet peppers, and fully dipped.  The meat was moist and tender, and the bun had the salivating texture of a dipped sandwich, but overall the taste was lacking and almost bland.  I'm not a regular Italian Beef Sandwich consumer, so maybe this is the standard. +2/5 for the disappointment, from an amateur Italian Beef eater.

The chili cheese fries were filling.  I'm biased against crinkle cut fries. The chili was the thinner chili; no bean-sized chunks in this chili.  Still satisfied the craving for chili cheese fries.  +3/5."}
{"text":"I would give this place 3.5 stars if I could as I have no real complaints. This was my first time and I tried the full pallet of what they are known for; dipped Italian beef sandwich, Chicago dog, onion rings and chocolate cake. The beef sandwich was good, hot dog was good, onion rings were crispy and good and chocolate cake was great for a fast food joint. But nothing was spectacular. Good place not incredible."}
{"text":"Get the large beef sandwich dipped with peppers and all is good in the hood!! The manager chatted us up while waiting in line as first timers, the atmosphere is fun and the food callers keep you entertained. Was my 1st time but won't be my last, we got beefs, dogs, fries, and rings and it was tasty!"}
{"text":"So happy to have one of these right near my house. On second thought, maybe not so happy as it's hard to pass by and not stop! Portillos was always a popular stop when we were visiting Chicago making the menu quite familiar to me. 

I have eaten here a few times and done both the drive-thru and the restaurant. The service has been wonderful every time. I always get the same thing: Italian beef, dipped, with sweet peppers and a fry. While they are called Portillo's hot dogs, the Italian beef is really the star of their menu. Having it dipped is the true Chicago experience and adds that extra something to the already flavorful beef. The fries are also traditional Chicago hot dog stand-style, and I like them, but they aren't spectacular (and who would expect them to be for a fast food joint?)."}
{"text":"One of the irritating inevitabilities about living in The Valley is eventually being unable to escape some douchebag who migrated here from ANY OTHER METROPOLITAN AREA, and drones on incessantly about how much better things are \"BACK HOME.\"

Chicagoans might very well be the worst.

Enter Portillo's.

Know somebody from Chicago? (Who doesn't? They're everywhere. Like cockroaches.) Ask them about Portillo's, and you'll never get them to shut up. \"Dis is da gratess hot dug effer.\" \"you kain't git hot dugs like dis in Feenix.\" \"I'd keel yoo for a Portillo's\"

On and on.

It's a hot dog guys, nothing more, nothing less. You'd do just as well from a CART GUY ON A DOWNTOWN STREET CORNER.

We arrived at the new Tempe location and parking situation was a clusterf**k-zoo, which I can't see getting any better any time soon. Portillo's DID have staff poised in the lot to assist, but they seemed just as confused as most of the drivers.

Inside? Holy Crap. Cavernous and full. Very busy, very loud and very colorful. Portillo's has a standard walk up counter for ordering, but today we were greeted by order takers who would then hand back our written orders to give to the people behind the counter. After paying, you are given a number and guided to the other end of the restaurant to wait at an \"order up\" counter. BTW, the lady working the mike and calling order numbers was extremely irritating, sounding like a carnival barker and, for some reason, feeling it was necessary to add a rhyming quip to every number called.

I think this Portillo's was purposely over-staffed because it was grand-opening week, and they were still working out the kinks.

ONE KINK IN SERIOUS NEED OF A WORK OUT was delivery and presentation. we ordered 2 JUMBO CHILI DOGS, 1 LARGE CHEESE FRY AND A LARGE ROOT BEER. We waited 20 minutes and what we got was a soggy lukewarm mess. We were confused as to why were asked \"for here, or to go\" when we ordered, as, even though we clearly stated we were dining in, we were handed a paper sack of food and a drink TO GO.

Chili dogs don't wrap in paper very well. So what we unwrapped was a couple of smashed, room temperature messes with half the chili sticking to the paper wrapping. The dog was only ok, the chili generic, and they were a little too generous with the onions, but like I said before, \"HEY IT'S JUST A HOT DOG.\" In this instance, a hot dog with absolutely nothing special going on. 

The cheese fries were hot and tasty with the cheese served on the side (again, in a to go cup). Not nearly enough cheese to satisfy the large order of spuds though, and I later noticed it was the same sized cup of cheese that came with the small order of fries too.

I would discount this place as just another not worth it FRANCHISE OF THE \"BACK-HOMERS,\" and the parking situation really does need a fix. But just as we were finishing up, I spied a rather frail elderly lady hoisting a ITALIAN BEEF, and man, did she look happy. Happy enough, in fact, to make me want to go back to Portillo's and give it another shot, this time with the ITALIAN BEEF.

However, if you're just looking for a hot dog to throw down for lunch, see the guy on the street corner and avoid the Portillo's hassle.

After all, IT'S JUST A HOT DOG.

Ok....went back and tried that Italian Beef I referred to earlier. Nope. Nothing special. Not bad, not great. There are a lot of \"CHICAGO JOINTS\" in The Valley. So far, none can hold a candle to LUKE'S Italian Beef.

Just as many employees as the first time, but, even though Portillo's was much less crowded than the first time I went (is the luster really wearing off that fast?), the employees seemed even less organized

Once again, our food took a little too long to come, and was, once again packed TO GO even though we specifically, ONCE AGAIN, said we were dining in.

Overall, after 2 trips to Portillo's, nothing special or worth the crowd, wait time, or parking hassle."}
{"text":"The \"Combo\" Italian beef/sausage was no joke! 

Italian beef was absolutely AMAZING...

My only gripe, French Fries were ice cold. :("}
{"text":"Overwhelming!  This is a fast food joint and the food is just that, fast food.  I was not at all impressed.  Bottom line \"Eat Local\"!  There are way too many other options that are WAY better. Luke's, Hot Dog Stop, Chicago, Pat's....all local, all tastier."}
{"text":"What's the big friggin' deal about Portillos? 

Stopped by for lunch after picking up my sister's birthday gift at Tempe Marketplace hoping to find out, especially with many of my friends singing its praises.

Blech, that's what.

Soggy bun, tasteless relish, meh hot dog.

Also split a dipped Italian beef with Dude, and it was like chewing on grease. No, and not just because it was ordered dipped. 

I've had better at another local eatery ran by a native Chicagoan.

Freezer-aisle esque crinkle cut fries. Charging for *pre-packaged ranch* as Andrea S. already mentioned.
 
This type of food by its nature isn't the most wholesome, but it left me nauseous as all get out for the rest of the day. 

Not a big hot dog fan to begin with, so maybe I'm not the most reliable reviewer ... But there's definitely better dogs to be found in the Phoenix area. 

Perhaps this was an off day for Portillos; however, not sure if I'll be back for a round two."}
{"text":"Burgers galore!
The strawberry shortcake is a must! 
The atmosphere is super fun and it is a great family place!"}
{"text":"I love Portillos, but every time I come to this location the hotdogs taste rubbery.  I dont know what they're doing wrong,  but to me it seems like they're cooking them too long...."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is very casual, and if you aren't familiar with the menu, your first time will require you to take a few minutes to process the myriad choices available to you (Italian beef, Italian sausage, hot dog, chili dog, chicken tenders, fried halibut, fries, with cheese, and/or without chili, hot peppers, sweet peppers, chocolate cake, or strawberry milkshake, you name it, and this Midwest restaurant favorite may make you miss home...  Takes me back to my days working at Barney 's Ribs (another Portillo brand).  Oh, and everything is a la carte!

Mom enjoyed her chili cheese dog, ate it all, and even though she suffered tremendous pain from the onions and beans, she wanted to have another one the next day!  (I told her maybe once-a-week is a better option- too much sodium, you know.)  The beef was good, but I didn't really care for it in a croissant, as I prefer eating crispy, flaky layers, and not the soggy mess I had for lunch.  There also wasn't much cheese, except in the corners of the roll.  Will never order it again!  

$0.60 for two strips of roasted hot peppers is a bit much..."}
{"text":"Best polish sausage I've ever had. Great prices. I will be going back soon. Everything on the menu looks good. My husband had the Italian beef. It was wonderful."}
{"text":"What a mixed bag. I'll start with the Pros

The grilled Italian sandwich had a great taste and If I ever went back. That's what I'd get.

The greek side salad was ok. But way to many onions. That's just a personal preference. 

They had a wide variety of foods on the menu for a drive thru restaurant  - ribs, pasta, Burgers, hot dogs etc.

I'm not sure if they make their own bread but it is really good.



The cons

Parking Lot- Complete total nightmare. How many accidents happen here?

Went for Lunch on a Saturday. It was so packed. Like getting in/out of a concert. If we weren't meeting family there we would have skipped it completely.
The line to get to the counter to order had no less than 50 people. Out the Door.  I decided to to try and get a table for 7 in the madness. I lucked out and pushed two tables together. IMMEDIATELY  a staff was there asking me \"How many people are in your party???\" I was confused by that for a second because you seat yourself here and it is such a circus I could hardly hear her. \"Seven\" I said. She just walked off. I guess she cared that we were using to 4 seat tables.

Turns out it was faster for me to add the Portillos app on my Phone and place an order for pick up then it was to stand in line. I know this because my husband stood with his family and our food was done first. By at least 10 mins. FYI there is a separate counter for pick ups.

When I brought the food back to the table and passed it out they had forgot some of my order. I went back up and they got the forgotten food and asked it I would like a piece of cake. I thought that was really nice .

My husband did not like his hamburger. Didn't like the taste of the meat.

I did like the portobello sandwich. But on the app when it asks if you want to customize it, taking off onions or lettuce is not an option.

FYI- You have to take your drink to the counter to get refills.

We felt it was pricey for what you get. We won't go back, seriously not worth the hassle. There wasn't one thing we tried that stood out so much that we would fight the crowds to go get again.

Plus we don't live near it. But if we did, would I try the drive thru one time? Maybe for a sandwich, no sides.

I think this is a place you go if you ate here when you lived in Chicago otherwise....We wouldn't recommend it on a weekend anyways."}
{"text":"There are few chains I will review normally but this place was great so I felt I owed it to the staff to give them a good review.

I have never heard of this place before, but my bosses have and they wanted a catered lunch from here. They had an idea of the menu before hand so I trusted their judgement.

They were great over the phone answering questions and being patient...I had a lot. They sent email confirmation and were all around awesome. The day to pick up arrived and they had everything ready to go...no waiting around.

That's when I realized I locked my keys in the car with my cell phone...awesome. Not only were the people behind the togo counter awesome, they were just plain out patient and willing to help...and able to laugh along with me that I had an idiot moment. The manager called a cab for me after letting me make countless calls on their phone.

Finally we got me a cab and I got the food back to the office. It was great. We had the beef and some Italian sausages with their bread, which was great too. We got some toppings for both like hot peppers and such.

Everyone was so pleased with the food and apparently they have a ton of other great stuff to try as well.

I will definitely go back here because of the food but how can you not after having such awesome service when you're such an idiot?"}
{"text":"Portillos is yummy yummy in the tummy. I ate a whopping 4 sandwiches from here in one sitting.  Didn't even effect my stomach after i have been battling crohn's the last 30 years.  Would definitely eat here again. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Not happy with this selection. Nice atmosphere but food was not very good. Not worth the cash that I dropped on all of us to eat. Probably will not try it again."}
{"text":"First things first: Why do all the other cities have one except mine? Whack!!

Ok, the review: On my first trip out in AZ saw there was a Portillo's by our hotel and decided to finally try it (the closest Portillo's to me is in OC, but why we haven't been yet - I dunno). I had the Italian Beef - Dipped - with sweet peppers. So much deliciousness in such messy sandwich - but I didn't care about the mess, my hunger and tastebuds were satisfied. My hubby had the chili dog but he ate it so fast I didn't get to try it, he must have enjoyed it. Extra points for having delicious crinklecut fries. But minus one star, because I decided to try the Tamale and it was disappointing - it had a gummy texture and the filling was pasty, sorry!! A must is the Strawberry Shortcake for dessert! 

Well organized lines, and food pickup. Love that their trays have cup holders! Hoping all the other locations give me the same experience. The hype is real, now open one in San Diego please. I don't want to have to drive all the way to Orange County just to try the Portillo Chicago Dog that I didn't have room in my tummy for this time around."}
{"text":"I was actually nervous that this Portillo's would be a disappointment. Nothing beats the original, but this location is still fantazmic. And I don't even have to catch a flight to Chicago! 

My heart started beating faster as soon as I walked in. The anticipation for the Portillo's Dog had me smiling giddily, like a little school girl on Puppy Day. Is Puppy Day a thing? If not, it should be.

The hot dog was great, just like it was in Chi-Town. I'm no hot dog expert, but these are still the best I've ever had. 

If you don't like hot dogs, there are plenty of other offerings. The Italian beef sandwich is Great, tender beef, and dipped in gravy to your liking (Dry-light gravy, Extra gravy or totally Dipped in gravy). I like the beef sandwich with sweet peppers added, and I don't really even like peppers. 

They also have chicken sandwiches, fish sandwiches, a veggie sandwich, burgers and even..... salads. 

Most importantly, if you do like hot dogs... you have to get here as soon as possible to do work... Joey Chestnut style."}
{"text":"Ive been eating here since they first opened up. I always got the Chopped Salad, it's pricey costs more than my husbands Italian Beef Sandwich. 

The salad is huge, and was filled with fresh lettuce, tomato, and chicken breast, comes with a Lemony dressing and a wonderful warm lemon muffin. 

Imagine my surprise when I got my salad yesterday, chicken was not edible kind of disgusting had to eat around it, I was saving my Muffin for last, when I opened the little package I was surprised to find a crusty piece of dried out bread !! Hey I felt cheated.. 

My husband loves the beef sandwiches, I guess he will be dining alone from now on. How much did that little muffin cost you? $8.00 bucks for a huge bowl of chopped lettuce. I can stay home and eat a whole lot of lettuce for $8.00

Cost $25  Reg. Hot Beef Sand. / Onion Rings / Chopped Salad / Choc. Cake served in paper wrapper with flimsy plastic forks."}
{"text":"Decided to go here for lunch, craving a hot dog which is weird.   When I approached the order counter I asked for paper menu, the cashier gave me one and as he gave it to me he said the menus are on every counter and pointed.  How rude.  He could have said that before he grabbed one from behind the counter.   
The hot dog was good, I ordered the jumbo and it's the size of a regular one.  Overpriced!"}
{"text":"Great beef sandwich. I always get the dipped with peppers. Great atmosphere and friendly service. I always enjoy coming here. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Being from the Midwest I've been to a couple Portillo's in Illinois and I must say this one looked exactly identical. Unfortunately being on a low carb diet I wasn't able to indulge in a delicious hot dog or cheese fries, but I did appreciate their salad selection. 

I had the seasonal summer salad, caprese chicken salad, and it was very tasty. It had fresh tomatoes, mozzarella, and a balsamic dressing. The portion size was pretty generous too. It also came with a dinner roll which was a nice little bonus.

I definitely need to come back here again for their more well known eats, but I'm glad I found it!"}
{"text":"My coworkers come here often during lunch- which typically I am satisfied with the cheese fries. But they do have very delicous burgers and salads as well. And staff is very friendly - plus I give them all props for being on top of everything, a very fast pace to work at."}
{"text":"Like McDonald's on steroids. It's fast food but with a wider menu selection and more of a restaurant atmosphere (old-fashioned signs, vintage bicycles, neon signs, oldies soundtrack.) Order and pay at the counter, walk down to another counter and wait for them to call your number.

My husband ordered a loaded Chicago hot dog; I had a basic burger. The burger had a nice char flavor and lots of condiments. Crinkle fries were crispy and potato-y. We shared a \"small\" chocolate malt, which was more than enough for the two of us. They also offer sandwiches, ribs, salads, and desserts.

It's not a destination restaurant, but if you're in the neighborhood and hungry, it's a solid bet for American classics at a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"My family and I were so excited that portillos opened up in Arizona. Wish there was one on the west side of town. Love Chicago food."}
{"text":"Combo sandwich with Mozzarella and hot peppers, with cheese fries and great iced tea!  As good as Chicago!"}
{"text":"I don't know what to think of this place. I mean, I really do like it (I'm giving it 4 stars), but it's not what I was expecting. I had heard SO MUCH about Portillo's before going, but despite that I didn't realize it's basically glorified fast food (and I don't mean that in a bad way at all). For some reason I thought it was more like casual dining.

Anyway, I've been here a few times since I recently started going to a new doctor in this area & I've really liked what I've had. I will say, I got things that probably aren't the most popular items, which actually probably speaks to how good this place is (my dad always gets the chili cheese dogs w/grilled onions & LOVES them). I've had the chicken tenders, grilled chicken sandwich, and beef on a croissant, all of which were yummy. I also LOVE the cheese fries. The fries are crinkly & I like that cheese is on the side. I also tried the chocolate cake & brought home the strawberry shortcake on my last visit. The chocolate cake was VERY rich, but it was a huge slice. I really LOVED the Italian style shortcake, though.  

This place is a really weird place to dine in at. I do like that they are kind of old school when you place your orders. They write it down as you order and call it out to the back over a microphone before ringing it up. I think this makes for less mistakes, especially on orders that aren't as exactly as the item(s) are on the menu. However, I do wish they had a soda fountain where you could serve yourself. It's nice to grab your drink immediately while waiting for your order (it also makes it easier for refills). They also serve you your food here as if everything is takeout (bagged up) whether your dining in or not. It's not a big deal, but it seems like kind of a waste to bag up food, rather than just place it on a tray if your gonna dine-in.

The few times I've been here have always been late afternoons (right after the lunch crowd), and although things have been pretty busy the wait to order & for food isn't bad. From what I understand though this place gets PACKED at peak hours. 

All in all I really like Portillo's, and think it's a good, \"different\" fast food place to stop by and grab a bite to eat at when in this area."}
{"text":"The Italian Beef, dipped with extra hot peppers is the best sandwich that you will ever eat."}
{"text":"Although I'm no Chicago native, I've been there and can say that this place doesn't do Chicago dogs justice. We ordered the jumbo chili cheese dog, Italian beef, fries, and a burger. Everything just tasted okay. The Italian beef was the one item that was pretty decent."}
{"text":"Look out calorie counters! For some tasty Chicago style fast food, you've come to the right place. The set up seems exactly the same as the Scottsdale location, which made navigating around the restaurant easy.

Options here include shakes, burgers, Italian beef sandwiches, sausages and hot dogs. We split a big beef sandwich, onion rings, and a chocolate cake shake. The big beef had a heaping layer of beef on it, with extra gravy/broth (Standard order, although you can modify it as you like). I usually like my Italian beef full dip, but it was easier to eat it with less broth, and as you ate the sandwich, you would get different bites of broth soaked bread and unsoaked bread, making it kind of like you are eating 2 different sandwiches in one. I got it with hot and sweet peppers, and mozzarella, all blending well flavor-wise with the sandwich.

The onion rings had a very crunchy breading, and one order was a decent size. The chocolate cake shake was everything you'd imagine it to be: Thick, chocolatey, rich, with blended bits of chocolate cake in each sip. Definitely a good way to ruin a diet!

There is a spacious looking patio, and I saw people bringing their dogs here. Since the weather's getting cooler, this might be a good option for dining on a patio with man's best friend."}
{"text":"It's like having a little piece of Chicago in the desert. Portillo's serves up all your Windy City favorites like Italian beef and Chicago style hot dogs. They also have fries and burgers. For sweet treats, they have various shakes, malts, and desserts.

We shared a big beef, dipped, cheese fries, and a large vanilla shake. The big beef was excellent. The beef and broth had a really nice, rich flavor, and the bread held up well to being dipped in broth. We added sweet peppers and mozzarella, which were both good additions to the sandwich ($.50 extra per topping). As for the fries, rather than putting the cheese on top of the fries, the fries and cheese are supplied separately so that you dip the fries into the cheese. The fries themselves were crisp and crinkle-cut. The shake was huge, and very thick.

While the parking lot is a bit small, the restaurant itself is quite spacious, and we had no problem finding a seat despite it being busy on a Saturday afternoon. 

Our total for a Big Beef with 2 toppings, cheese fries, a large shake, and a small soda was about $17, which isn't too bad considering the amount of food we got. We were both definitely stuffed after eating!

I'm looking forward to the opening of the Tempe Marketplace Portillo's, so I can enjoy tasty Chicago style eats closer to where I live!"}
{"text":"I'm a midwestern girl - been to Chi-town many a times over the years.  But somehow I never made it to the infamous Portillo's.

Fast forward to my life in the desert and a Portillo's happens to pop up right in my neighborhood!  Could not have been more excited to try this place, especially after my Chicago friends talked it up more than Lou Malnati's.  If you're a fan of the chi-style hot dog with everything under the sun, this will really hit the spot.  Their chopped salad was surprisingly excellent as well.  I'm told the desserts are really delish so I hope to make a trip back soon for some milkshake goodness.

A++ Portillo's - now open your next location in SF so I can get some more of you whenever the mood strikes!"}
{"text":"I had this place bookmarked for months before I finally made it. The place was packed and lines were long, which means it must be worth the wait! I felt a little rushed through the ordering process, but they made it work and it was definitely fast service, which was great because I was on a break from a class across the street. Oh yeah, the seating arrangement was a pain though! The place is huge but not big enough for everyone to sit down, causing people to turn to seat vultures, eyeballing you to hurry it up with your meal they don't have to stand there anymore.

Now the food... It was delicious! I had an Italian beef (dipped plus hot peppers) and a bottle of water. My co-worker was kind enough to share her fries with cheese sauce and I only had a few, but let me be honest in saying I could make a meal out of those! Yum. So, I would be back for the fries alone.

Let me tell you why the two stars and why only the cheese fries would get my business. I was soooo sick to my stomach the rest of the day. I could feel the grease from the \"gravy\" sitting in my stomach and was belching the taste through the next day. This is not normal for me and so disgusting! Like I said earlier, it was delicious, however, after that bout I am too scared to give the sandwich another shot."}
{"text":"One star for not pets on outside patio.  We will not return, with or without our pup."}
{"text":"Secret menu item, chili cheese fries soup. Syke. Disgusting. Soggy fries, soupy cheese, tasteless chili. Had i had time to go in to the restaurant i would have make it to YouTube with the scene I would have made!!!!! Ok maybe not but still this is strike 3 for this particular Portillo's. First time had a extra tough chicken sandwich and the second the my hotdog had like 3 pounds of onions on it. See ya!"}
{"text":"Decided to give it another go today and see if my first impression was right.  I ordered the Italian beef and onion rings.  The beef was soaked in olive oil and not that good.  The onion rings are frozen but still good.  I have absolutely no desire to go back ever.  If i want a hot dog, I'll go to Ted's in Tempe and if I want a beef I'll go to Rosati's at Warner and McClintock since it's not a franchise.  I had a friend from Chicago with me and he even said that the beef's were different from the ones back home.  Way too much olive oil put on the beef if you ask for hot peppers."}
{"text":"Long waits for over priced bland food I really found nothing interesting about this place, I have visited a few times and each time I was unimpressed. The chocolate cake shake and strawberry shortcake are pretty good, that's probably the only reason I would return but then again the 20 min wait to get it really isn't worth it."}
{"text":"The plan the other Saturday night was to go get burgers from In & Out and bring them back to the house.  However, due to events taking place around ASU that night and the next day (ASU Homecoming and some race the next day), I was unable to get off on Scottsdale road.  And all of the surrounding streets were closed too.  BIG Cluster F.  

After sitting in traffic for almost an hour trying to get back to the 202, I get back to Hayden/McClintock road.  I see the new Portillo's and give J a quick call to see if that was an okay substitute for him, to which it was. 

They have a drive-thru which is nice and if it is during a peak time, they have people standing outside waiting to take your order instead of ordering at the squakbox (like In&Out).  If you've never been though, you feel pressed to make a quick meal decision - Which I was for mine and  C's meals as J had checked out their menu online and texted me his order.  

I ordered 2 chili cheese dogs, a regular hot dog, the poppyseed fruit with chicken salad, and an order of fries.  I found it odd that they do not have kids meals at Portillo's.  I will say that C liked the hot dog.  But to be honest, I could just buy a package of Nathan's Famous and make these dogs at home (chili and chicago).  J felt the same way about his chili dogs (which ended up falling apart).  And the fries, I could order the same fries at Del Taco for the same price.  Or better yet, make them at home.  

The salad I ordered sounded similar to the Strawberry poppyseed seasonal (summer only) salad I fell in love with at Paradise.  BOY was I wrong.  The chicken resembled flash frozen chicken.  You know the kind you can get in the freezer section, you just reheat it and use as you like.  Terrible.  The only positive thing about the salad was the cheese (which there was only a sprinkle of) and fruit, which I ended up sharing with C.   The glazed walnuts, there were maybe 4 or 5 pieces in my salad.  OH..they gave you a lemon poppy muffin with the salad.  Big Whoop.  

For the price we paid ($20+), we were all in all disappointed in our dinner and probably wont be returning."}
{"text":"The best Chicago sandwich you'll ever eat in Az! Plus it's in a great location & super fun upbeat atmosphere!! Great place for big families or big groups! The sausage/beef combo with sweet peppers is my favorite go to! The strawberry lemonade is awesome too! The chocolate cake shake is pretty incredible too!!!"}
{"text":"This location has better service and if you can believe it. Better food than the southern California ones. 
I am very happy and full."}
{"text":"My buddies and I went to Portillo's of Scottsdale today to try their food.  Two of us had their hamburger, which was advertised as juicy and good.  We had a burnt hamburger, it was paper thin and not so good.  I also order their chicken noodle soup and I had only two noodles and a couple pieces of chicken and all broth.  I can tell you folks I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Delicious! I got the Italian Beef Sandwich dipped with sweet peppers. The flavor was wonderful. I ate right in the diner, which was nice since getting the sandwich dipped had the potential to make the bread soggy -- it was perfect dining in. Fries were crisp and fresh. Finished off the meal with a vanilla milkshake. Everything tastes great and was a very reasonable price for the value of food."}
{"text":"Ok, here's the thing about Portillo's - the place is a freakin' zoo.

It was a Sunday afternoon...

A hot, muggy, and generally miserable afternoon - to be outside that is.  We had plans to go out for dinner, so we wanted something light for lunch.

Hmmmm, fast food? No. Salad bar? Not today. Oh I know, how about we grab a quick bite at Portillo's  - I hear they have great hot dogs!

And so we went....

First thing I noticed as we approached were the workers standing outside along the drive-thru lane - looking like car salesmen waiting to grab you.  Apparently tho, they are there to assist the massive amounts of cars that come thru - like In N Out.  Next thing I noticed was the large dining area consisting of tables, booths, high tops, and bars.  The 3rd thing I noticed was the massive amount of people and long line to order. 

To make a long story short, we had problems finding a place to sit - it was like trying to park and when someone leaves everyone rushes to the vacancy like musical chairs.  We found an uncomfortable bar seat.  As far as the food, it was just OK.  I got the polish and my girl got a regular hot dog.  Both were tasty, yes, but boy were they train wrecks.

Maybe it was a bad day to go, but dining in an overly crowded restaurant, sitting in an uncomfortable bar stool facing the wall while trying to negotiate an OK hot dog falling apart at the seams is only worthy of 2 stars in my book.  I will probably only go back if someone else is treating me."}
{"text":"Friends ordered burgers and sausages they loved it  I ordered Chicken bad choice on my part very rubbery."}
{"text":"We stopped in here one time for dinner and had a great experience.  The food was very good and everyone in my family enjoyed their meal.  There was a lot of options on the menu and even though the place was busy it didn't take long for us to get our food."}
{"text":"What is there not to love.The service is decently fast but I think it's the taste that matters at Portillos.If you are looking for fast food, this is the place."}
{"text":"What's not to love about portillos? Their beefs are always hot and delicious. No matter how obscenely long the lines seem they move really quickly. The chocolate cake is perfect and moist and you can't go wrong with a hot dog. Gotta love cheese fries too."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time this weekend. I will say they do a wonderfully authentic Chicago hot dog, which is the signature hot dog at Portillo's. I don't go to the mall too often but when I do, Portillo's would certainly be a reasonable option. For what it is, this is a good food experience and if you like hot dogs, you definitely should give this place a try. Only thing, it would be nice if they had their menu online so one could say, pre-select some healthier options and I am not sure they offer a veggie dog option. My parents are cutting meat out of their diet so a vegi dog would be a nice alternative."}
{"text":"Not as good as  Chicago Portillos. Fries tasted like the oil was rancid 2 out of the 3 times we've tried it. Beef is good but didn't put on extra gravy as requested. Mixed up our order too"}
{"text":"We went for the first time after looking up their menu online and seeing they have a variety of pastas. Upon arrival I found out two of the items I wanted to try on their restaurant menu were not available at this location, which was a little irritating, you would think they would have a menu for their location specifically. I ended up trying the Italian beef with hot peppers. Overall it was good, the meat didn't seem to have much flavor though. We split an order of fries with cheese sauce. We assumed cheese would be poured over the fries, but we got cheese in a dipping plastic container. The fries were decent but the cheese had almost no flavor either. Everything is \"a la carte\"."}
{"text":"Leaving Chicago was heartbreaking, but a Portillo's opened in Tempe just weeks after I arrived in Arizona! There aren't very many outside Illinois, so consider yourselves lucky.

When I ate meat, the Italian beef and sausage combo was my go-to.

Now, restricting myself to fish only, I'm super happy with the grilled tuna sandwich.

Seriously, everything on the menu is dynamite."}
{"text":"This place is really good! First time coming here and I've only heard good things and I see why! Food is delicious, fast and affordable! Came at around 8 and there wasn't much of a line but the drive through seemed to be getting some good action! Definitely going to come back for sure, get the Chicago!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Portillos, but lately they seem to be slipping, perhaps the heat is doing it.  I went through the drive thru.  So I order a garbage salad.  I get home.  The Salad is a little bit wilted. The leaves have a high number of thick stocks.  I order an extra poppy seed muffin because I love them and they charged me for it, but they gave me only one.  I look for a straw for my drink and there wasn't any. So you folks at Portillos need to get your ordering and delivery system back in shape."}
{"text":"Can I get a sweet jesus or even a hell ya!!! Best hot dog I have EVER had!!!

This place is super cute! I love the way it's set up, very open, fits a ton of people, cute little patio out front, they have a convenient drive through and have a great mix of old school/Chicago decor, set up in a modern way (if that makes any sense)

The menu is larger then I thought it would be there are salads, hamburgers, chicken sandwiches and of course hot dogs!! I decided to go with the Jumbo Chili Dog, Cheese fries and a drink! Wish I had room for dessert, or a chocolate shake! Definitely going to order that next time! A lot of places over cook hot dogs, or have awful tasting chili they pile on top. It's nice to actually get a perfectly cooked/juicy hot dog, on a delicious seasoned bun, with flavorful chili! Ohhh and the fries! I LOVE crinkle fries.... a lot of places stopped serving them! Portillos hit home with me with the crinkle fires! Nice and crispy, crunchy, the way crinkle fries should taste!

Overall great experience! This place is very laid back, casual, family and date friendly! The staff is very courteous and welcoming! Worth the lines and the kayos! I recommend going later at night around 9pm is when we went (I know that is late to eat) but there were no lines, received our food in about 5 minutes, sat and enjoyed each others company while people watching and took the long drive home!

This specific location is about and hour away from my house, but certainly worth the drive! I can't wait for them to open up their new location this summer at Tempe Market Place!

Great night! Thanks for finally making it to AZ Portillos!"}
{"text":"I HATE having to leave this review because the Portillos in Scottsdale blew me away when I first heard of this chain. My 1st visit to this Portillos in Tempe, was this past weekend. I was super excited for I was traveling from QC to Scottsdale and new this location had just opened and I had to pass it to get to my friends house! Why not try it out since the other location is out of the way and FAR from me! I was soooo super excited I think I may have exceeded the speed limit to get there! LOL! The drive through was pretty thorough and awesome when I arrived. You had very nice (but crazy people, because they are standing outside all day in this heat) taking your order. I ordered my norm, chili cheese hot dog and chili chesses fries. My ordered was confirmed by at least 3 different people walking down the drive through taking orders and by the person who collects payment; they were all very nice and quick. I pulled up to the last person who brought me my order (even repeated my exact order back to me), super happy my order came out before the 2 cars ahead of me (how nice and fast) left the drive through and rushed to my friends to devour my delicious food. When I got home and opened up my bad of deliciousness I was completely disappointed!!! Immediate sad face! I received the wrong order! You know the feeling you get when your parents tell you you're going to Disneyland and they end up taking you to the doctor instead? It felt like that, the build up of awesomeness, then the tremendous sadness in the end! I was so sad and frustrated, for you are looking forward in enjoying a delicious meal and you receive an order you don't even want. I received a regular hot dog with mustard.... it would have been fine and I wouldn't be upset if I liked mustard, if I liked mustard a tiny bit, but I completely cant stand the taste of mustard, I hate it. I tried scraping the mustard off the hot dog and throwing the bun away, but it still had its mustard taste, so I tossed it! My chili cheese fries ended up being normal fries, so I ate those and pouted! I know things happen in the drive through ever now and then, it was just frustrating for my order was repeated to me so many times, there was no way I felt I even needed to check it before I left the drive through. Then getting all the way home to eat it and it not being the right order is just frustrating. It's a waste of money and then a waste of gas to drive back to get my correct order. I will try to give Tempe another chance if I am in the area and checking my order every time will be a must now! You wont find me driving out of my way to try it again though :("}
{"text":"Love love love this place.... The all time question is what's better a Chicago dog with everything on it. Or the beef sandwich dipped with hot peppers. Order both lol and top it of with a cake milkshake if you can.  Oh gluttony I never knew you till I met you at portillos."}
{"text":"Just a fun place, food is a little better than most and a fun 50s Chicago vibe. There was something for all to have even a vegetarian in our group and the kids had a blast"}
{"text":"Growing up just south of Chicago and spending many weeks/weekends with family there, Portillo's has been a staple of my life for decades. I visited this location twice, once inside and once through the drive thru. 

The inside dining experience was standard and met expectations, no major hiccups. My only comment here is that when the hot dog prep employee drops ingredients on the counter, maybe they should get fresh ingredients instead of trying to pick up the dropped ones with tongs while everyone can watch. 

The drive thru was great until I got my food back to the hotel. My order was repeated at the order spot, the payment window, and the pickup window, and it was STILL missing items when I got back to the hotel. Due to a time crunch for work/travel, I could not go back the 10+ minutes to get my order corrected, nor should I have to. 

Overall, it's a good experience and very accurate to the Chicagoland Portillo's locations. I would suggest checking your order before leaving, however, since three verifications of the order weren't enough to make sure I had everything I requested."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving a 2 is because there were tables dirty, with 9 employees on the floor, 3 were on break and the others well I'll leave it at that. around. I personally don't mind cleaning my table if it's extremely busy but it wasn't busy at all"}
{"text":"My experience at this Portillo's was 10x better than at the N. Scottsdale location. Maybe they learned from that opening? But I found the quality to be much better. 

We must have missed the dinner rush because I quickly found a parking spot and there wasn't a wait to order. We walked in and they had some workers out in the ordering area taking pre-orders. I decided to try the italian beef sandwich and the boy got the italian sausage sandwich and a chili dog. We shared an order of fries. You order and then walk down the ways to wait for your order to be called. It took about 5 minutes to get our food (fast - too fast?) We got our condiments and dug in. I really liked my sandwich, get it with the hot peppers if you're into it. The fries were crisp and perfectly salted. My one complaint is that the sandwich was probably sitting so some of the bread was soggy. My bf thought the hot dog was okay. In my opinion all hot dogs are \"okay\" unless we're talking about Short Leash so take that with a grain of salt. We ended with a chocolate cake shake that my boyfriend hadn't yet experienced the delights of - he tried to drink it all so that's that. I'll be back"}
{"text":"A friend and I ran a 5k last night so we decided to indulge in Portillo's for dinner. We made out way over and while it looked busy, there wasn't a long wait to order or pick up our food. I decided to try the beef n cheddar and fries and my friend had a chili dog. Our food was ready after not too long and we grabbed a table and dug in. Unfortunately, the fries and lemonade far outshone the sandwich. It looked and tasted as though it had been preprepared and was sitting in a warmer. It was warm, not hot, and there was little cheddar to be found. My friend was equally unimpressed with his hot dog. For the price though, it wasn't a total rip off. On our way out, I grabbed a chocolate cake shake and he got a strawberry shortcake. Those definitely redeemed our experience and I loved the shake. 

Maybe they are experiencing a lack of quality control in the kitchen since opening up? I'll probably try the Tempe location once it opens up but I was less than impressed with my first time here."}
{"text":"Just got done eating here about 30 min ago! My beef and my cheese fries were delicious! I have nothing bad to say about the food. However, my customer service was terrible!! I had ordered an Italian beef, large cheese fries, and a chocolate milk shake. When digging for my money to pay I sadly noticed I only had enough money for an Italian beef and a small cheese fry. I politely ask the cashier to downgrade the fries and take off the milkshake. He was JUST SO UNBELIEVABLY frustrated he was in no way cautions to hide it!! He sighed very loud right in front of me and then fallowed with an eye roll. Then asked \"k. That it?\" With the biggest attitude. Could not believe the way I was treated."}
{"text":"What is there not to love.  A staple when your ever in Chicago and now here in AZ.  I love this place with an unhealthy, but necessary obsession.  Every Time I go no matter how hard I fight it I must get an Italian beef extra wet with melted mozzarella and a Chicago dog.   I just have to cause even though that is so much food I'll regret it if I don't.   Even if you only come once it's still amazing.  

It does get pretty busy, but has always been worth the wait for me."}
{"text":"Wow. Just wow. Not only amazing Chicago style hot dogs and crispy fries but the entire atmosphere is fantastic. The decor, the space and table layouts are fantastic and comfortable. Staff is on the ball, and there's no shortage of employees, courteous and efficient. Went during the lunch rush and took only minutes to get our food. I have to mention the man calling out the orders who had a fun rhyme for every number that got called giving the restaurant a different feel than any other restaurant. I guess it's fast food, because it's fast and there's a drive through, but you can't tell with the quality of the product. Watching them work was amazing too, you know they have a great management team. In fact, I'm not sure what I loved more, the food or the employees! Definitely will be a regular here and can't wait to try out their other locations. Seriously one of the best experiences I've had in a while. Oh and two people ate and got full with drinks for under 15 bucks, what a deal. Chicago dog is legit too."}
{"text":"One of my friends brought me here during my recent mini vacay to Arizona and sadly I must say that I was not impressed. I ordered the beef sandwich, bbq chicken salad,onion rings, and chocolate cake.

The Italian beef was oddly textured and bland- no matter how much I tried to add flavor (tried to dip in vinegar, tried to dip in their dip sauce, tried mustard) nothing helped so I eventually just threw it out and bought a salad. 

The BBQ chicken salad was super underwhelming too. Dressing wasn't that great and their was only a very small amount of bbq sauce that sat only on top the chicken. The lady also put a super whole bunch of hard ass torilla chips in my salad which slightly pissed me off. I wanted to return it But wasn't in the mood to go back through the line.

Chocolate cake had potential but tasted like it had been frozen- had that weird freezer taste in the middle.

Onion rings- tasted like typical onion rings you get from the market and fry up at home.

Overall I didn't care for the food I ate here. I left feeling irritated, slightly hungry, and like I'd basically just threw away my money. My recommendation would be to eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"Hot dogs with an unbeatable snap and fries covered in midwestern style chili are the main draws, and what I get nearly every time. But recently I ordered a burger, trying to explore the menu a little bit. It was one of the best I've had in memory. Classic American style, with fresh toppings and good seasoning. Generous size, tasty bun - and an outstanding value at just over 5 bucks. There are other restaurants out there, but this price cannot be best for the quality."}
{"text":"This place was just...okay.  Not terrible but nothing spectacular either. The decore and atmosphere was really great! You can tell they put alot of money and work into the place. The staff was very helpful and friendly. The food, however, was kind of blah. We did get our meals to go and ate it back in the office, so maybe it was because it wasn't piping hot that it didn't taste so good...? But I doubt it. My two other co-workers messaged me that they also didn't care for it. My onion rings were over cooked and were mostly breading, and my char-grilled chicken sandwich was breaded which I wasn't expecting. All in all this place was decent enough but I'd rather go elsewhere."}
{"text":"This was great.  If you want healthy this is not the place although they do have salads.  I ordered the double combo which has the Italian beef and sausage along with sweet and hot peppers and got the dipped version.  Probably would only do gravy next time.  Dipped is messy and you will need a fork to eat it.  Also got the cheese fries.  Great meal before heading to the airport."}
{"text":"My favorite hotdog in Arizona . I love the sweet peppers on the Portillo Chicago Dogs"}
{"text":"My daughter and I arrived Saturday about 1 p.m. so it was crowded inside but the patio wasn't. The line to give our order moved along pretty quickly and our order came out about 10 minutes later. The Italian beef with hot peppers was very tasty on a nice Italian roll.  daughter had beef & cheddar on a croissant which was tasty as well. We got the gravy on the side...nice to dip as you go instead of dripping all over. Two sandwiches, side of fries, side of slaw, and one drink was about $17. Would like to go again and try some other choices!"}
{"text":"This place is slowly going downhill. Today it hit Rock bottom for me. Ordered a hotdog and a ice tea. 15 mins after order, and I saw 3 other orders go out in that 15 mins. I went and asked for the manager, he was dealing with a complete wrong order. Manager said st the time of Oder I should have been told there was a 10 delay on hotdogs. I was not. Wait I have already waited for 13 mins??? WTF ok go back and wait. 7 more mins, now 20 mins after I ordered my 1 hotdog, I go back to the cashier and ask for a refund. Cashier asks why? I tell him because I haven't gotten my food. He calls for the manager Tom for a refund. Tom says he will be right there. 5 mins later I left. No food. No refund. I did left the cashier know I will NEVER be back."}
{"text":"I ate at Portillo's all the time when I was a child in Chicago. The Italian beef, wet, is to die for. Great French fries, great food, great service, great atmosphere (loud which is great for young families). 

If you haven't eaten at this Chicago staple, you're missing out! I'm so glad they came to Arizona!"}
{"text":"First time in here! I tried the famous hot dog, tuna burger, and chicken salad.
I used don't like hot dog because of salty but this one was not salty even when you eat it all together with the pickles and bun, I still can taste the flavor each of it, it wasn't overwhelmed flavors. 
The interior was fun like going back to the 90's. 
The services quite fast.
I would like to go back to try their famous BBQ beef and I definitely recommend this place to try!"}
{"text":"Supposedly it's National Cheeseburger Day! Not sure how true that is but it's a good enough reason to partake in a cheat meal. I decided to try Portillo's for the first time and good lord that burger was the effin bomb!! Best burger I've had at a restaurant! Now the onion rings that I got were a no, but back to the burger. A Hey Boo and seductive wave to the person who was responsible for that burger. I, as well as my stomach thank the hell out of you. I even ate the pickle and I never eat the pickles on a burger. I usually ask restaurants to take the pickles off but I forgot. 

There were about 5 cars ahead of me but the line still moved rather quickly considering there was a guy outside taking orders. My food was nice and hot. I like the fact that the burger is in a container instead of plain ole paper b/c it kept my burger warm as I drove back to work. All in all, I give Portillo's a 4/5 instead of a 5/5 because those onion rings get a \"Naw bruh\" from me lol.

My top 3 burger places would now have to be:
1. Portillo's
2. The Habit
3. In N Out"}
{"text":"OMG REAL CHICAGO FOOD FINALLY IN ARIZONA.. Got the chance to met the owner and she was the funniest person ever. Amazing Hot Dogs and THE BEEF ugh what can I say so so yummy. The salads are pretty good too. Can't wait til the one at Tempe Market Place opens closer but I will have to wait til the lines go down before I head off to that one. BUT THIS IS MUST VISIT PLACE..."}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool!  I liked it so much we went twice in one weekend.  I can't think of another restaurant that is as unique as Portillo's.  

The building looks like a diner out of the 50's.  Inside, the place is decorated in a super cute way with lots of interesting signs.  They play oldies music and have ample seating.  Outdoor seating is available too and they have umbrellas to keep you cool and heaters outside to keep you warm.  Ordering is quick and the pricing is very fair!

What I really loved about Portillo's was the Italian Beef sandwich with mozzarella.  OMG, THE BEST BEEF SANDWICH IN TOWN.  They put what they call gravy (I call au jus) on the bread and it makes the bread it so soft.  I ordered cheese fries and the fries are crinkle fries with a cup of cheese on the side.  Very tasty!  We had the onion rings too and they were a little hard but still good.  They have great hot dogs, so says my husband.  Will have to try them at some point.

The have the best Italian Strawberry Shortcake I have ever had....okay technically it is my first \"Italian\" strawberry shortcake.  I have had lots of strawberry shortcake in my day and this was the best.  They sell a portion big enough for 2 for a little over $4.00.

Definitely a new favorite spot of mine!"}
{"text":"In Chicago, where Italian Beef sandwiches were born, Portillo's is an icon. My experience at this location in Scottsdale did not disapoint. The experience starts when you walk in the door and are welcomed by a very inviting interior decor.  The walls are covered in memorabilia and celebrity pictures. The staff is very friendly. The food is served quickly.  And of course, the food is delicious. My son and I had the Italian Beef. My son had it regular while I had mine dipped. Mine was a little more sloppy than I remembered, but delicious all the same. The fries were the same crinkle cut fries that I remembered. I wish we had a Portillo's in the Dallas area where I am from, but finding this one in Scottsdale helped bring back the memories of living in Chicago's suburbs and going to the original Portillo's Hot Dog stand in Villa Park, Illinois. Scottsdale, you are lucky!"}
{"text":"Every time I try to go here the item I want is \"not up to portillos standards\" so they're not serving it.

So, I want to like this place, but it's just so poorly run and they can't keep their menu up to standard.  

I *might* try to come here again, but waiting in line to find out what you want cannot be served because they can't get chicken or beef or whatever it is that day, and because they can't make it up to their standards is frustrating.

Sad."}
{"text":"Portillos! I first had the Portillo experience in Chicago and was ecstatic there was other locations on the west coast. 

It was my husbands first time here so we ordered the Italian beef, Portillo dog, chili, fries and onion rings.

I love love love the Italian beef with extra gravy and hot peppers. I'm not the biggest Portillo dog fan though... The chili was good. The fries were good. And oh man oh man. The onion rings are wonderful! They are fried to crispy perfection. My mouth just watered a bit just now :)

At the end of the meal, my husband and I were stuffed and so satisfied!

Beware. If you choose to sit outside, those birds are very aggressive and hungry. So watch out!"}
{"text":"It was SO busy when I went, but I was impressed with how quickly our food came out. I got the Chili Cheese Dog and my boyfriend is a fan of the Italian Beef Sandwich. I like the food, but for the price point I don't think we will be going too frequently. It was almost $20 for a sandwich, hot dog, small fry, small onion ring and two small drinks."}
{"text":"Not true Chicago not since the original owner passed away now it's just a fast food chain where they get their food from food service trucks"}
{"text":"I'm not from Chicago, so please forgive me for not being very impressed, Por-tee-yos (hey, if \"you people\" from the Midwest get to butcher our words, expect equal treatment). My vegetarian friends would probably like me to start with a clarification that fish = meat and is not, in fact, a \"meatless choice\". Sorry if this brings you down to only one veggie option instead of three, but it is what it is. Speaking of clarifications, let's be clear that NO ONE outside Chicago expects radioactive looking relish, so some disclosure would have been appreciated. Also, you could have warned me about the pickle and peppers that landed on the table when I tried taking my hotdog out of the bag - I wanted those things on the hotdog. Other than that, this place is what it says it is. They sell hotdogs and other stuff, and it appears that they do a lot of this. It may be the biggest (and busiest) fast food restaurant I've ever visited. I'll maybe be back if killing time in the neighborhood again, but wouldn't make a special trip."}
{"text":"Portillo's! What took you so long to meet me here??? Authentic Chicago-style hot dogs and Italian beef sangwiches served up with tasty crinkle cut French fries in a 50's looking fast food restaurant. And that's not all! Their tuna sandwich is delicious and ya gotta try the Chicago street tamales too!"}
{"text":"I'm from Chicago & haven't had a chance to visit Portillo's since they've moved into the valley.  I have not been back home for at least 8 years, so it's been a while.  I got a hot dog for my daughter and a Tuna sandwich for myself, as well as cheese fries.  Fries were as I remembered, Hot Dog & sandwich were nothing to write home about.  I guess all things change!  It was Ok, just wouldn't make it a point to go there.  Unless I was in the area.  The service was good, and as crazy at it was, they were still very quick with the order taking and delivery of food!"}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere, friendly staff, and the chili cheese anything is amazing!!!! I wish we had one where I live."}
{"text":"I am not a Hot Dog lover. But this place has the best Red Hots!! Super fast service, very efficient and affordable...it is so good!!"}
{"text":"There was so much hype about this place that the bar was set super high, but my first visit was terrible. Had never been here before so my girlfriend and I were standing beyond where the line was looking at the menu. An 'usher', or whatever they are, jettisoned us (rather rudely also I must say) into the line saying we have to get in line, despite our remarks that we had never been here and didnt know what to order. He insisted so we got in line and within 30 seconds were pushed to the counter. We still had almost no time to look at the menu and we let the employee know that we were pushed through and we weren't ready and then he got frustrated with us. Felt like I was in the twilight zone. Hot dogs are sub-par and disappointing. Luke's of chicago was way better in my opinion. Not allowed to sit at a table and wait unless you have food, must clean up your own plates and throw everything away your self. Not really much a restaurant format. Wonder exactly what I am paying for here; average food and attitude it seems. Gave them 2 more tries and results were similar. Not coming back here."}
{"text":"Really amazing food. Always incredibly fresh. I am a little too obsessed with their chili cheese fries and chocolate cake shake! I also really enjoy their chili cheese dogs and the meatball sandwich. I appreciate that when they take your order they make you aware of condiment options, and automatically include a water to drink when you only order a milkshake. Good service."}
{"text":"I will probably not be returning to eat here because they removed the halibut sandwich from the menu. That sandwich was so good but everything else I've had here is mediocre."}
{"text":"Spending half my life in Chicago I am used to Great Italian Beef Sandwiches, Chicago Dogs and fries and this hometown Chicago chain NEVER disappoints! My husband and I love to hit it after a day of playing paintball.  My husband gets the Combo sandwich with Italian Beef and Sausage but I stick with the Dipped Italian Beef. Their Maxwell street Polish is great as is their fish sandwich.  And if you are a chocolate lover get a piece of the cake to take home (you'll be too stuffed to eat it there). Glad to have some real Chicago food out here in Arizona!"}
{"text":"I am such a fan of Portillos after having it at the first location in Sdale and this location is just as great. The employees are all so welcoming and jolly :)
I think I love everything on the menu 
But if you want something sweet, get the cake shake, it is heaven in a cup
I am having a salad tonight, the grilled chicken Caesar... :)
As much as I wanted the drenched Italian beef, I ate so much this weekend that a salad is much needed 

Oh Portillos, you shall see me all the time"}
{"text":"I have not been to Chicago therefore have not had authentic Chicago food
but I had a great experience at Portillo's today
I had seen on Facebook a ton of my friends posting about it and such
so I thought I'd give it a go 
IT WAS SUPER PACKED
It made me a little more excited because since its packed then they must be doing something right :)
The line was long but Im very patient so that didnt bother me at all
I didnt know what to get but a friend recommended the Italian Beef so 
I ordered the Italian Beef with hot peppers, fries, and a strawberry milkshake
Oh, I got the sandwich dipped as well

All of it was delicious and I will for sure go back

I will try the cheese fries and a hot dog next time :)"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I was introduced to Yelp, August of this year while vacationing in Seattle. It made a great vacation better by giving me directions and ratings of restaurants in an unknown territory. Thank you Yelp.

Unfortunately, for my first post, I must comment on a most unpleasant experience I had today at Portillo's hot dog. I've only heard rave reviews about this \"Chicago iconic hot dog palace\", so I had to try it for myself. I decided today would be the perfect day since I was having company over for the game. I drove to the Tempe Market Place location from South Phoenix, ordered, paid and picked up my order then headed home.
To my disappointment, items I ordered were not included in my take home package. I called Portillo's and explained my situation to the lady that answered the phone and she said \" Let me get my manager\" and placed me on hold. When the manager got on the phone , I explained my situation to him stating \"I ordered items that are not in my bag.\" The manager asked me for my receipt number so I told him. He then asked me to hold while he checked on it. He returned on the line and quickly apologized. He then asked \"Do you want to come back so we can make it right?\" I said \"no, I live too far to come back!\" Did I mention there was a charity run going on in Tempe. This is important because the normal three lanes were shut down to one lane for traffic making it a nightmare. The manager then said, not very kindly, \"Then what do you want me to do, I can contact our corporate office and they can send you a coupon.\" At this point I felt the conversation was not going in a good direction, so I said \"Thats ok, I don't think I'll be returning.\" The manager then responded \"Then there is no reason to continue this conversation.\" So I said \" You're right\" and hung up my phone.

Maybe next time they are fronted with this situation, they might offer to refund the money for services not rendered. Just a thought. I wasn't asking for anything I didn't pay for just what I did pay for. In my opinion, this is poor customer service."}
{"text":"Incredible food at a great price!  I wish we lived in the area so we were able to eat here more often!! Friendly staff, clean restaurant, decent prices, and AMAZING food!  I had the chicken Caesar salad, my bf had the buffalo burger.  Both were perfect.  We will be visiting again before we make our way home!!"}
{"text":"Chicago dogs in Scottsdale? Dude! Where do I sign up? Oh, wait! No sign up needed! Grab a few bones and chow down! You guys are in for a treat... terrific!!"}
{"text":"The \"gravy\" they have is just oil... and their sausages are just brats from frys. OIL ISNT GRAVY"}
{"text":"Last time I had this was in Chicago, and remember how good it was.  However we didn't eat dinner here because I wanted healthier options, but my son remembered the chocolate cake shake from hearing about it on Gabriel Iglesias comedy show. So we went to get some shakes! We got a couple of chocolate cake shakes to go. We did have our dog with us and this place has a huge patio, you would like it would be appropriate for pet owners to bring their pups, but no. There was a sign on the door that clearly stated no dogs on patio. How disappointing!

The shake on the other had wasn't disappointing. It was really good and you get a decent amount for the price. Try the shake, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Food was just OK, nothing special. Place looks nice,  but can get loud and crowded. 

Let me sum up the experience: every worker CLEARLY hates their job. It showed in every instance  and I'll leave it at that."}
{"text":"The only difference between this so-called restaurant and a pig sty is the addition of MSG to the restaurant's low-end ingredients. DO NOT EAT HERE if you have taste buds. To top it off, you have to stand in lines to get your food like you're some kind of animal. The management of this place is rude and could care less. Only people of no breeding or taste would be caught dead here."}
{"text":"There was ample seating and quite large inside. They have counter Service ordering. The food came up quickly. I really enjoyed my Italian Beef and Sausage with Giardiniera. The fries were crispy and the cheese sauce was good. I am not a Chicago native but from all accounts it is the real deal."}
{"text":"The atmosphere has an old Chicago style feel and the food tastes great. And the prices are low"}
{"text":"One of my favorite stops in Chicago has always been Portillo's for their Italian Beef Sandwich and a great dog. I was so excited to see they have outlets in Arizona till I tried it. Yes, it is a beautiful place but something happened to the quality of the beef and lack of flavor. I ordered a beef sandwich with sweet and hot peppers, wet. I was set back being charged $1.00 extra for giardinara but I like it. Sadly 1 tablespoon combined of hot and sweet peppers is not worth a buck, this should be part of the sandwich as"}
{"text":"This is my must-go stop every time I visit the Phoenix area, and it never disappoints. Enjoyed a wonderful dine-in experience (they also have pickup and drive-thru) between games of a spring training doubleheader. Love the inside atmosphere and they also have outside seating. Precision in the ordering process makes for a better experience. Cooked to order, great menu, and this Chicago native loves their Italian Beef! Fun Chicago-oreinted photos throughout, lot of patrons due to the quality and overall experience."}
{"text":"Surprisingly my favorite thing on the menu is the poppy seed fruit chicken salad! Delicious"}
{"text":"I love Portillo's, and I'm a big fan of their Beef sandwich and salads, I stop by during the first week they opened and the line was not bad. It was nice to see all the folks from the Naperville, IL location that I had not seen in about 3 years. The food was great! It was everything I remembered from the good and the bad! 

The Good: 

Food taste was the same, the Beef has great flavor that I have yet to taste when eating other Beef sandwiches from around the US. 

The Bad:

My order was incorrect, funny thing is I'm use to it from the Naperville location so it was funny that this location made the same error. But overall the food is great and the experience for me is the same which is great and I'm glad they are in town!"}
{"text":"Portillos is famous for its hotdogs but I'm hooked on their beef sandwich with extra gravy and the hot peppers .. this is a nice size sandwich, plenty of thin sliced beef, the roll is soft and the peppers have the right amount of heat.

Plenty of indoor and outdoor seating.. they also have an amazing salad bar/counter (they make the salad for you)  if you're trying to eat healthy or someone in your group is.. 

The chocolate cake is delish but has 700 calories (gulp) .. maybe you can share it (lol) and right now they have a lemon cake for a limited time (yum).. maybe I'll get it to go .. 

The drive thru is like a maze including cones.. best to park and go inside and check out all the signs and the funny way they call the order numbers .."}
{"text":"I've eaten at the Scottsdale Portillo's, but since I've been away, they opened this second location in the Tempe area in the mall area.  Since I'm a fan of a good hot dog, I came here to eat with a friend for lunch and to hang out. I'm glad I did!

The menu has a bunch of stuff to choose from, but I went with my usual, of two Vienna beef hot dogs with mustard and onions with a drink. My friend went with the same order as well.  Fortunately, there wasn't to much of a line, but as we sat and chatted for a while, we noticed that crowds came and went in spurts.

I love how the place is decorated. Lots to look at with cool lights and the such.  Our food only took about 10 minutes or so to come out and it was delicious.  It was hard to hear the girl call our order but we got it the second time she called our order number out.  

Staff here is pretty friendly and cool and things seem to move along quickly. Plenty of places to sit with all the fixings at the condiment counter you can think of.  The only downside is that the fountain drinks are located behind the order pick up counter. I don't know why they do this.  It would be nice to have one located for self service, since refills are free anyways.  I had to get more Sprite and I felt like I was bothering the girl since the counter was slamming busy when I went back up to get more pop.  It would make it easier on the staff if patrons could refill their own drinks.

Overall the food was good here, and I do like eating here when I'm in town. The buns are tasty and make the dogs good.  If was I was still in town I would probably try more menu items, but I wanted to keep it simple since I was starving and was craving their beef dogs.

Overall not half bad.  Cool place and I love eating here.  They also have a HUGE Patio to eat outside at with shade overhead so you don't get hit by the sun."}
{"text":"I finally made it out here today and I absolutely loved it.  The place was packed!!  O my goodness loads of people!!  The place is huge, with an enormous amount of signage and colorful dÃ©cor.  Ton's of tables, and lots of people helping.  The lines here were long, but I didn't spend more then 15 minutes between the time I stood in line and got my food.

they have two lines here. One for ordering, one for food pickup.  They had all 4 registers open, with girls throughout the line taking your order and writing it down for you to make things go quicker.  Once I got to the register, things went fine.  They sent me over to the pickup line where you grab your drinks and food.  That was the longer line of the two, and you kind of stand around in this clustered area waiting for your number to be called.  Being that this place was packed, there was an enormous amount of people waiting, but it seemed to go by quickly.

I found a seat near the door, and the food was awesome!  I got the jumbo hot dog with relish, mustard and onions with a pickle on the side. Bun was tasty, and I loved it. Price point was right on, and I will gladly drive the few extra miles to go here in the future.  If you haven't gone to Portillo's, you must do so!! Tasty!!

They also have a drive thru here, so if you want to avoid the crowds, or are in a hurry, this is the way to go.  Outdoor seating is available, along with ample parking in a very busy shopping center. Place is visible from the road, but come early because the place is non stop busy!!"}
{"text":"The beef and cheddar croissant is calling my name, but I decided to go with the Chicago dog and a chili dog chaser and of corse cheese fries. Probably should have gotten the salad, but I don't get here very often and I treated myself."}
{"text":"Food was okay. They made the entire order correctly, which is always a plus. The chocolate cake shake was thick and tasted just like its name."}
{"text":"The one thing I regretted about my Chicago trip was not going to Portillos, so I was super happy when I heard they were opening one here! 
I guess it's not so bad after all that our state is infested with people from Illinois, they bring good food to make up for their awful driving...

We got their Italian beef drenched in their sauce, it was AMAZING!! So juicy and messy! We also got their all beef hot dog with no mustard or relish and it was delicious!! I despise hot dogs and I loved their hot dog. I liked it better than the Italian beef. Their fries were perfectly salted and yummy! We meant to get their charbroiled chicken sandwich but got the fried one and it was ok. 

They don't have a fountain drink station in their sit down area which sucks but oh well, don't fill yourself up with soda anyway so you can enjoy the food! 

I had super high expectations for this place and they were met! I can't wait to go back there ASAP! They are so worth the cardiac arrest!"}
{"text":"Service fair.  No management to correct errors.  If a drink is incorrect, the Illinois main office has to rectify it.  \"A ship without a rudder\".  They don't take care of errors, complaints, or mistakes on premises.  No manager with any authority for corrections on premises.  Very poorly run.  Be cautious.  They sure need the Illinois tourists for this \"machine\"."}
{"text":"I'm not from Chicago, never been to Chicago (although it's near the top of the list) and never heard of Portillo's before it opened up in Scottsdale, so I'd say I'm pretty unbiased. Tried the italian with sweet and hot peppers and gotta say: it was damn good. I might get it with extra gravy next time because it might have been a little dry, but other than that the meat was great, the peppers were great, the bread was great. My gf had the chili cheese dog and she was impressed. The place is packed, but things move along rather quickly. I have a feeling this is the kind of place I'll be craving."}
{"text":"Great hot dogs, the beef sandwiches are amazing. Those are the only two things I have had here. Will try a burger next time. They look good. The crinkle cut fries are fantastic as well. Big eating area and very family friendly casual. Parking can be tough. Don't like asking for refills."}
{"text":"Have you ever been to a small food-shop owned by an immigrant of any nationality where they seem to be skimping on everything to make ends meet? Common, we have all been to those places. You ask for an extra side of their delicious ethnic sauce and they want those two quarters in your pocket. They charge for the three day old iced tea. I understand for they are a small establishment. Portillo's is a big Corporate operation. 

Well, cheap owner of Portillo's, can you put in a self-serve beverage refill counter? I do not want to have to go awkwardly across the pick up line to get another beverage. This is Arizona. We expect free refills with 105 degree weather.  

At least you replaced uncle Sam's. That clown didn't even have blue cheese for his wings.  

Oh yes, this is what happens when you skimp on beverage service in Arizona. In my dehydrated state I am not getting to the food until the middle of the review. The Italian Beef was excellent but small. I would like a 8 - 10 inch option for a couple extra bucks. The gardinere * lasted a few bites into the sandwich. Again, is there a guy fresh off the 747 skimping on food cost involved with  the operation? 

Yes. I will return to Portillo's because it is good and well priced. I will pay extra for a couple of extra inches on a sandwich. In fact, I am back at the office now and still hungry. Maybe I will return for that delicious Italian Beef. 

Oh yes, the employees were excellent at executing efficient counter service during a peak hour."}
{"text":"I actually go to Portillo's a couple of times a month but not because the food is so great, or the atmosphere, or even the price.  It's simply convenient -- close to home and you get your food quickly since you order at a register and then pick it up at the counter.

Ambiance is zero inside, and the outside patio features car fumes.

The roast beef sandwich and meatball sandwich are probably their best items.  The rest - average.  The fries, sweet potato fries, and onion rings are all just ok or maybe a bit less.  The hot dogs are fine, but try making them Sonora style and you might have something.

If you are passing by and are hungry and are willing to spend about $10 for a sandwich and fries, Portillo's will do."}
{"text":"UPSET ALERT. 

If you're looking for a great hotdog, QuikTrip is your best bet. No kidding. QuikTrip had additional toppings at no additional price, but here... it's not available or way extra.

I ordered a \"Jumbo\" hotdog for $3.51. When I received my order, they forgot to put the JUMBO part in. 

What is the difference between Jumbo and All beef hotdog (besides 40Â¢ difference). 

Yes, I've had Chicago, New York, Philadelphia hotdogs and you cannot compare. It's all hype or placebo effect if you will with all these bogus Yelp reviews giving this restaurant 5 stars. 

EXACT comparison to Quiktrip hotdogs (which are delicious), and 2 for same price here or cheaper at QuikTrip GAS STATION. 

If you want to waste money, definitely the place to go to. Crowd is similar to retirement home."}
{"text":"I really don't understand what all the hooplaa (a teynical term) is about. We stopped in for a quick lunch with the parents last week and we were less than impressed. We enjoyed what we ordered, but I wouldn't drive more than 5 minutes to eat there. 

I had a chopped salad, it was alright, the dressing was good, but too much of it. My hotdog bun was pretty much wet. Everyone said the was because it had been in a steamer or something... if this is what people in Chicago call a good hot dog, they must not get good food often. I guess the Italian Beef is what all the rage was about, but none of us partook in any of the beef sandwiches, maybe we will give it a whirl next time. 

I also don't get the drive through right next to the patio like that..... yeah that's just what I want with my sandwich a lung full of exhaust fumes. Awesome!

All in all it was alright foo.... but I wouldn't go out of my way."}
{"text":"Did a simple pickup order for 8 meatballs and 8 sausages with bread, had to wait over 40 minutes to get my order!  We were told they make everything to order.  I don't believe this because when I order a beef sandwich in the drive thru it takes under 10 min! Also, for whatever reason unlike Chicago locations they don't have the bread on hand but have to bake the bread! Another 20 minute wait! I'll be contacting HQ in Chicago to understand why orders are taking so long."}
{"text":"This place is the BEST! All the food is great! We always get the big beef and split it because its huge! The chocolate cake shake is sooo good! We love the service and environment here! Totally worth the drive! Friendly staff and clean eating areas! We love portillos!!!"}
{"text":"What a blast!

It was packed, but they are ready for it! Great selection of items.

I had a hot beef sandwich ... awesome!

Customer service is great! 

Missed Jimmy Buffet by 2 days!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place since moving to town.  Chocolate cake! Need I say more?  If you remember double fudge cake from Jack in the Box, you need this cake in your life.  So good.  I need to forget it exists, or work out 5 hours a day. I also like the hotdogs and fries, and broiled chicken croissant.  Even the lemonade is refreshing. There are still a ton of things on the menu I want to try.  There's always tomorrow, right?"}
{"text":"Can't say anything that hasn't already been said, if you're from Chicago or the Midwest in general you know all about the hot dogs and Italian beefs sandwiches the area is associated with. Portillos is the best you're going to get in the valley. Luke's greasy barely flavored sandwiches have always been a sad imitation.

If you're in the area...hell if you're not in the area give this place a try, it's loud and busy but worth it..if the inside noise is too much for you, sit outside it's a lot quieter. And the sandwiches are SUPPOSE to be sloppy...please beware of that before going, us Chicagoans don't eat dry ass sandwiches, I think those are called Philly Steaks."}
{"text":"This restaurant is the best! If you love hotdogs and authentic Chicago Italian Beef sandwiches, this is the place! To all these complainers, get a life! It's about the food, and serving lots of it quickly and hot that impresses me. And, they read back your order before they ring it up. So mistakes are on you, not the cashier. Give them another chance and chill."}
{"text":"Hot dog paradise.

Seriously--what could be better than a delicious chili dog on a fluffy poppy seed bun?  When you're at Portillo's, there's nothing else that compares.  At this point, I think that this is my favorite hot dog joint in town.  This is also my wife's favorite spot for her Chicago dogs.

Lots of seating here--great service in early '60s diner surroundings.  You have to come here and have a bite.  Inside and outside seating available."}
{"text":"As you can see I've only done one review prior to this. It's not that I don't like things I eat its just none have been this amazing. I feel it is a must to list a review!! I'm not from Chicago, from good ol' Arizona. I had the sausage w/ Italian beef and hot peppers (pics posted) along with onions rings. Line was a bit hectic about fifty people in front of me but it goes by fast. The food was so amazing after I ate my sausage Italian beef sandwich inside, I then walked to my truck and waited in the drive through for more. Don't judge me its THAT GOOD!! Thank you baby Jesus for Portillos!!"}
{"text":"Big Italian Beef was good it would have been excellent if there was more sweet peppers. The taste of beef is tasty."}
{"text":"I got my taste of Chicago. Had the Italian Beef with sweet peppers, mozzarella and extra gravy. They pile the beef on. Sandwich was so big my wife couldn't even finish her sandwich. The bread is so fresh. Also got the fries and a chocolate cake shake. Oh my goodness. The shake so so good. You got to try it. 

The staff was nice and friendly. Some of the staff had that Chicago attitude. I loved this place. I will be back very soon."}
{"text":"I am from Chicago, and was SOO EXCITED when we FINALLY got one here!! I love it!!"}
{"text":"Service, service, service. It is the star here. Of course I expect that to change over time, no business is going to survive with 4 people working outside the drive thru or 2 people handing out menus to people as they walk in. Food wise for Chicago style dogs, italian beef, etc I would rather have locally owned Luke's or Taylor Street with one exception, the chocolate cake shake is awesome but as I said the other food is just average, nothing outstanding."}
{"text":"Great food, I always ask mom to pick up Portillo's on her way back from any of her doctor appointments"}
{"text":"I love their food!!!, they got killer cheese fries and all beef chili dogs!!!!!!, this is the 2nd Portillo's I've been to (I went to the one in Chicago 2 years ago), the service was good here, it gets packed during lunch time here and it's noisy which are cons but their great food makes up for that!!. Bring Portillo's to San Jose please!!!!"}
{"text":"I visited Portillo's after several of my co-workers raved about the place. I probably won't bother going back; like its gaudy decor, it's all shine and little substance.

SERVICE: I'm not a huge fan of the cattle-call style of food service. The organization was pretty lax when I first arrived and we got 'cut' in line several times as groups came in. Eventually an employee came out and started sifting people into appropriate lines.

When it came time to get food, we were back to 'cattle-call' again. The woman calling out the orders was humorous at first; eventually her rhyming and overly-loud microphone just gave me a headache.

FOOD: I had an Italian beef sandwich. The beef was mostly flavorless and somewhat dry, even though I had ordered extra gravy; the cheese was rubbery, but at least it had some flavor from the grease on it. 

I tried a bite of a co-worker's hot dog; it wasn't anything special.

AMBIANCE: Can you hear me now? No? Then you might be at Portillo's. The only thing louder than the mishmash of decor is the actual noise level in the building. Don't bother trying to talk here. Including a pair of noise-canceling headphones with each order would be nice.

OVERALL: If you couldn't tell, I didn't really see any positives to the place. The food was mediocre, the style of service is annoying, and the noise level might just be tinnitus-inducing. From now on if I want an Italian beef I'll go to Guido's, and I'll make the trek down to Ted's Hot Dogs in Tempe when I want a good frank."}
{"text":"Portillo's is a hit or miss type of place   some times good some time not so good.  but I can tell you they are expensive.    I usually come her when my wife wants to, but it definitely would not be my first choice for a hot dog.
the steak sandwich is flavorless, and they pepper and onions taste like they are from a can.  the food pick up area people keep there back to you and ignore you for the most part.   you can tell the people working there don't like the place.   may be I can have a better experience the next time i am force to go."}
{"text":"Late on this review but hey better late than never, right? I have frequented Portillo's on several occassions. They do not disappoint. The Italian Beef is AWESOME. I have had this sandwhich original,no dip, dipped, sweet, hot and on occassion all of the above. I have never had a bad experience here. Sure, the lines get long and sometimes there is a little confusion in the drive thru but the deliciousness of the Big Beef is so worth the short lived chaos."}
{"text":"Portillo's is a solid 3.5 - 4 star joint. Although the beef and the sausage aren't to die for, they are tasty. Despite the mess, I prefer to have my entire sandwich dipped. Fries and salads are also very good."}
{"text":"They take a hunk of their chocolate cake and grind it up into a regular milkshake, thereby creating a chocolate cake shake. Nothing else I could write could really be more of a ringing endorsement than that statement of fact.

If, however, ringing endorsements are your thing, let the following chime out: This place is the perfect remedy for the ravenously hungry. Do it the right way and get your italian beef soaked in the gravy for a few seconds. I like it with the hot peppers and the mozz along with a spicy italian sausage. I'm not fat yet, but I aspire to be."}
{"text":"Today was my first time there. Their food was excellent. The environment was pleasant and bustling. The wait staff and Personnel were very pleasant and helpful. I would go back in a heartbeat. Love the sausage and Italian beef sandwich. One of my all-time favorite sandwiches. And if you haven't been here yet you should really try this place out."}
{"text":"Mmmmmm!!! I am a portillo's fan from growing up in Chicago. In fact, their cheese fries were a major contributing factor to my childhood obesity... Lol. I love the cheese fries. So, it really brought me back to the good old days. I got a bacon cheeseburger and it just tasted so fresh and great. The bacon was not as crisp as I would like it, but the burger was fantastic. I would just get a cheeseburger next time. I've also tried the grilled fish sandwich before which was really good too."}
{"text":"It's difficult to say anything bad about this place. Even when it's busy, which is always, there service is always efficient and I'm not waiting any longer than most other \"fast food\" restaurants. I remember this restaurant when being in Chicago, very happy it's the same great quality out in Arizona now!"}
{"text":"If you are a Chicago-style hot dog fan . . .  or just about any kind of hot dog, Portillo's probably has it.  Sandwiches of all kinds - the Italian beef was super good with a little gravy, a lot of gravy or literally dipped in gravy and oozing from every pore of the wonderful Italian bread.  

It's just a diner, like many we've all been to for years, but Portillo's has that little extra oomph . . . not sure what makes it different, or even better, but it is. Maybe it is because it's here and it's new and I don't have to visit Chicago to get a really good diner lunch. Whatever . . . if diners are your personal choice of eateries . . . Portillo's is the place to be!"}
{"text":"The food is good. No doubt. The service is painfully slow. As I write this it's 2:30 on a Sat afternoon and the place is mostly empty. We've been waiting for 20 minutes for two sandwiches and two hot dogs."}
{"text":"Really wanted to like it but the food was simply sub par, not worth the premium price, and very rude and pushy employees that clearly didn't want to be working. This was my second visit as I wanted to give it a second chance but don't think I will be returning."}
{"text":"I grew up with a Portillo's down the street. So, you can imagine how thrilled I was when I heard a couple locations were opening up in Phoenix. As always, the Italian beef is a must. Their shakes, cheese fries, hotdogs, and burgers are all to die for as well."}
{"text":"This place is always buzzing and I love the setup of ordering your food and the pickup window is just fun.  I have tried a couple of dishes from here: the polish sausage meal that was pretty good but I was looking for more of a burst of flavor from the sausage..and the cheeseburger oh my goodness it was big and very tasty."}
{"text":"Local Midwest favorite brought to Phoenix has many Midwest natives living in PHX happy! The roast beef sandwich is always good and the chocolate cake shake is the best part!!"}
{"text":"Went to support Arizona Helping Hands and the foster kids and the meal was very good. Reasonably priced and high-quality food! Thanks for supporting the community Portillo's."}
{"text":"Such a fun experience, with good food! Love that they have a drive thru! Service was great."}
{"text":"I've never had an Italian beef before my visit to Portillo's. I lived by one in California but I never tried it because I thought it was just hot dogs, but when I saw some of the pictures of the beef sandwiches and read the reviews, I was eager to give it a try. Since this location is right by my work, I finally had a convenient opportunity to give it a shot. We went through the drive-thru and service was crazy on point! It wasn't incredibly busy like I had seen passing by other times, so maybe the 7 staff members standing outside to take orders usually have more to do, but it seemed way overstaffed at that point. The food came out reasonably fast and you could feel the heat of the sandwich intensely through the bag. We decided to share a big beef sandwich, dipped (we love gravy) and with hot peppers, with a side of fries. The sandwich was so juicy it leaked through the bag, so next time ill probably ask them to double bag/wrap it! When we got home we devoured the entire meal with great satisfaction. The sandwich was huge, easily satisfying our hunger. Can't wait to have another, and maybe try a Chicago Style dog, I'm interested in what all the hype is about!"}
{"text":"Soggy buns and bland food. 

I just don't get this place... u ask anyone from out of town, especially the Midwest, where do they want to go and Portillo's always comes up. For what ? soggy buns and bland food? Service was friendly but I'm sorry, buns were soggy and food was pretty bland and not impressed. Don't really need to go back. If your craving a hot dog, You can't beat Costco."}
{"text":"Everything about Portillos is good. Food is delicious and fast if time is important. It's nice to get this Chicago fare in Arizona."}
{"text":"Very excited to try, what a disappointment.  Went on Saturday night and the place was wall-to-wall (expected), great atmosphere - one of the stars.  The staff did a great job of getting everyone to the right place and keep the flow or ordering moving forward - second star.  We ordered two chili cheese dogs, one fry, one onion ring, and drinks.  The hot dogs themselves were decent - more of a half star.  Then no more stars.  The chili was runny and had no flavor and we struggled to find the cheese.  The o-rings and fries were also not remarkable at all.  The availability of condiments is null.  When we picked up the order from the counter we asked for mustard and three packets of yellow mustard where thrown on our tray.  I asked if they had any other types of mustard and the lady looked me as if I was crazy and said \" No.\"  \"Ok\", I replied,  taken back by her manner.  She then said \"What were you expecting?\"  My reply \"Oh, maybe something other than we can get at Sonic.\"  If you have kids and want something fast and hot, it's the place to go. I'm sure they will have a lot of lunch business from the hospital.  We will not be back."}
{"text":"Portillo's is, in a word, phenomenal. It's very family friendly, has a casual atmosphere, is clean, and most importantly has delicious food. Their burgers and fries tasted fresh and one of a kind, and their chocolate shakes were like heaven in a cup. Only problem I can think of is the crowds, but that's worth it to get some good food and seeing that they have a drive thru it's not too big of a deal."}
{"text":"This was my second visit. Hated it the first  time but wanted to try again because I had a coupon and people reviewing place love it. Wanted to see if I just had an off-meal...I didn't...I still hate it. 
I ordered one of the popular beef sandwiches called the \"combo\" and ordered it \"dipped\" - which makes it WAY too soggy. I took a few bites and couldn't even bother finishing it. 
Also had the apple walnut chicken salad for $7.79. It was alright at best but reminds me of a salad you eat on the airplane. And worth maybe $4. Cheap ingredients that aren't satisfying. 
I know it's a part of the \"Chicago appeal\" but everything is too rush in there - even on a Sunday. There was no one in line but the cashiers are waving their arms to come to them to order when I'm still trying to look at my menu options. 4x in maybe 20 seconds someone was  waving me down even though I was right in front of them. It's overkill. Even sitting down I think the customers are worked up from the rushing because everyone is acting anxious. So not relaxing. I'm just trying to eat lunch - it's not that serious. 
I won't be returning."}
{"text":"I had heard about Portillos and even though I lived in Chicago for a year or two, I had never tried it. I love Italian beef sandwiches though, so I was pumped to try this place. That said, I wouldn't order the Italian beef without the sausage. Adding the sausage knocked the flavor several notches. I also tossed some cheese on there. It was great!

I thought the fires were disappointing. I did however enjoy the set up and overall feel of the restaurant. I'd definitely go back. I'd like to try some of their other menu items. The options were quite extensive."}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink):
1 star:  Never again.
2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back.
3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad.
4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return.
5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.

I used to live 4 blocks away from the Portillo's in the River North neighborhood of Chicago, and this place feels newer (as it should) but does the food the same way.  And that makes me happy.

I'll start by saying that Portillo's doesn't have the best Chicago-style dog (in Chicago) or the best Italian beef (in Chicago), so if I'm sticking to my guns and the process, I'm comparing this location to the best in the world, and it's not.

BUT, it is the best Chicago-style dog and Italian beef in the Valley.  Hands down.  

I feel bad for the first timers who don't know, don't research, or don't ask about what they're getting in to when they get an Italian beef, and feel bad for the restaurant when they give poor reviews because of their ignorance.  

Like when you order an Italian beef, not even dipped.  They will still make it \"wet\" by pouring in some au jus from the drippings so it is not just \"grease\" that's seeping into the paper, it's water, beef juices, etc. that keep the meat moist and flavorful.  But really, you should get it dipped.  With hot peppers.  Yes, the bread starts to fall apart, and the giardinera is a little spicy, but that's the point.  You get the spicy vinegaryness of the giardinera to cut the fat and richness of the meat and au jus dripping from the sandwich.  It's meant to be a mess.  It's meant to be a two-handed, slightly bent-over, elbows-out affair.  And it's delicious.

The hot dogs with everything are Chicago-style done right.  Everything in it is cut like it should and in the right proportion.  It's a solid, solid Chicago-style dog, unlike some of the impostors our there.  (I'm looking at you, Shake Shack, and your Shack-ago dog.)

So you know, it's counter service.  You gotta wait a little.  Food comes out relatively quickly unless you monkey with your order with a special request.  It's messy food.  But it's delicious and the best Chicago food the Valley has to offer."}
{"text":"Mission - - - POSSIBLE!

Being a native Chicagoan, Portillo's has been a family favorite for years in my home.  Since I have moved to Vegas, the quest for this food has been a bit more challenging.

I placed an order for over 10 pounds of beef, a few dozen rolls and a large chopped salad to be picked up when I flew into Phoenix.  It was critical that the meat and sauce be completely frozen and ready for transport back on a plane immediately.

The order was packed to perfection!  Every thing that needed to be frozen was.  All the sides for the salad were packed in individual containers and all the peppers were ready to go.  Tom and his crew did an excellent job preparing this!

I also took the opportunity to have lunch while I was there and it did not disappoint.  The beef was fresh and tasty as always and I cannot get enough of those fries!

Thank you to the whole team who ensured my surprise office lunch the next day in Vegas was a smashing success!  I will definitely make this my preferred location to stock up!"}
{"text":"Get the Pumpkin pie shake while you can!!! It's the best! Loving it tonight!
Tried the beef and cheddar croissant... not my favorite.  Will stick with the classic Italian beef on hoagie. 
Brought my parents (from Chicago) because the can't find Italian beef in Atlanta!"}
{"text":"I mean... I was raised in Chicagoland, so, this quite literally tastes like home to me. My colleague and I ate here when we were in Phoenix for travel. Portillo's has such a fun vibe and has never let me down in terms of getting my order correctly and delivering good service. This particular Portillo's also has a Barnelli's, which not all of them do, so they have excellent pasta & salads, too. I always get a jumbo dog w ketchup, mustard, onions. I know, I don't like relish, and it's not a true chicago dog, I know. BUT, I couldn't resist getting a chocolate shake as well. It's fun to eat here again, it's comfort food! Love this spot."}
{"text":"What's the fuss about? Oh, nothing.

I was so excited when I heard a Portillo's was opening in the Phoenix area! Oh my gosh, I loved the Portillo's in Chicago, but... this is just, no. I don't even know if I should really be reviewing it under the same umbrella because this new trend of taking quality sit down Midwestern food (Steak n Shake, etc.) and turning it into... well, whatever on the west coast is disturbing. 

Where to start, well for one every time I've been there they've gotten mine or someone else's order wrong. The burgers are not what I remember, some flavorless non-juicy knock off. The shakes taste worse than fast food syrup concoctions sitting out overnight and the hot dog is sub-par at best. I am all for people enjoying whatever they want but I respectfully think you're wrong. In addition, there's something about the onion rings in that every time I order them they don't agree with me in a way I don't experience else where. 

Although, on the bright side, usually the cashiers are very pleasant, patient and suggestive. The deco is alright as well. However the wait is fairly long, I remember this from before but I figured I'd get the same quality. The outside area is very nice but on several attempts some staff has attempted to take my food... I don't know why, hyper eager preemptive cleaning?"}
{"text":"I hope someone shapes up this place before Cubs' Spring Training, because my friends and family are going to be really disappointed. The staff are highly unorganized. The food is cold. The staff make mistakes. The parking lot is not put together well, and I'm accustomed to the crowds that accompany any Portillo's parking lot. I have nothing good to say about this location and we won't go back until they experience a full season of waiting on Chicagoans and what it takes to be a successful restaurant."}
{"text":"Portillo's in Scottsdale from Chicago is a blessing. The food is good, but sometimes the hot dogs are soggy. It's not that hard to let the water drip off of a hot dog before you put it on the bun. That's really starting to annoy me, so 4 stars. The staff is always wonderful. We have eaten a few of the sandwiches, which are good. The chicken chopped salad is our favorite, but I don't think the chicken is cooked in-house. Lately the chicken in the salad has been mushy and covered in fat, so we ask for the chicken on the side so we can pick through it. We love It here, but it needs some attention to detail. P.S. A Chicago dog comes with celery salt. All employees should be reminded of this."}
{"text":"Chicago memories from a hot dog and Big Beef

Okay, that lead line sounds horrible, but it's accurate. My wife and I loved Portillo's when we lived in Chicago. Cheap, good eats and an authentic Chicago Dog.  My father-in-law spent decades loving the Italian Beef sandwiches.  Prices are very good for the amount of food.

Truth is there is a lot of hype associated with Portillo's coming to the Phoenix area from folks with Chicago roots.  It's a classic and old-time fave.  Food is yummy and authentic, but nothing remarkable compared to your places with innovative chefs.  Um, it's also not considered health food.  (Just FYI. :o))

The drive thru process may also throw people the first time.  I had forgotten how unusual it is-- order with a person who walks your car to the cashier person who then send you up to the food deliverers.  

Regardless, I love that Portillos and Chicago Hamburger Co are here to fill the need for authentic Chi-town fare."}
{"text":"OMG!!! The Italian beef w spicy peppers really hit the spot! A must try! We also tried the cheeseburger. Hubby got the big beef so good! 
Parking is kinds tight but the fast service makes up for it."}
{"text":"So... I had quite the experience here today and I thought I would share it with yelpers of the world. Today on the way home from work I stopped by this location to grab a quick dinner. I don't happen by this restaurant very often as I live about 25 min away. I was last at the restaurant about three weeks ago picking up a large order for my son and some of his friends. On that occasion when I returned home they had accidentally left a hot dog out and one kid had to have pbj. I called the store and let them know what happen and was told they were very sorry  and when I came back to please ask for a replacement. So when I passed by today I placed my order and then asked for the replacement hot dog. ( the cost would have been $3.50) I was told by the very friendly girl taking orders she would let her manager know and I would be helped at the window. The manager was waiting for me at the window and told me very quickly they do not replace missing food. I was a little shocked as it was not what I had been told before but not really bothered to much. She then drone on and on about how I should have held on to a 3 week old receipt for a hot dog if I had really expected to be given a free hot dog ( at this point I had paid $10 for my meal and was ready to go) she said I should have come back that very night if the hot dog was really missing and that she had no power to replace the hot dog she continued on for several more min as to why this was really my fault and there was nothing she could do- she then wrote down my details on a white paper bag and said she would send it to the head office as they have all the power lol. I could not help but laugh the 3.50 had not really been worth the waisted time . I have invested a little more time into this however, to write this review and to look at all the options in the area I have get a hot dog."}
{"text":"Hello all you Arizona foodies!

Being from Chicago (as many of us are), i was at the Scottsdale opening of Portillos and was blown away at how organized they were.


The orders came out right and the lines moved swiftly so when Tempe location opened I just assumed it would be just as organized...NOT!

The food is the same as Scottsdale and Chicago but this place was one HOT MESS!

Therefore Portillos has lost 2 stars from my Scottsdale review.

The parking is not great but the worst part is when you wait for your order.

You are standing in a small and very crowded area waiting for your number to be called and it was not pleasant experience.

So the next 2 times I went I chose drive thru... this was the WRONG choice....but you dont find that out until you get home and find you have the wrong order......

So, what do I do?  I call the manager and told him how unhappy I was that I just drove 25 minutes to get Portillos and get home to find the wrong order.

Here comes the truly ridicioulous part.... they dont say, \"come back and we will give you the correct order\"...No.... that is too easy, they take your name and information and send it to the corportate office and in a couple weeks you will get a gift card to replace the dinner you never got due to their incompetence!

So, I call the corportate office myself and ask why they inconvenience the customer by not replacing the order without having to go thru this riga a maro.. her response was that the store managers were not taking proper notes of people they owed replacements to and that caused problems....so of course it makes perfect sense to put the customer out of the way instead of just properly training their management on how to take correct notes!

I love Portillos and have for many years but is it worth spending money on food you are not getting?

No doubt I will continue to go back but... I WILL hold up the line to make sure my order is correct....instead of trusting the employees are doing their jobs correctly.

Also... be careful when you order little side items such as \"au jus\".. Between both locations I have paid for their sides many times but never received them in my order.

The food is Chicago good but the management is Not!

Try it... you will come back for the authentic Chicago food.

And so I end by saying....live each day as though it were your last and Enjoy!

Bon Appetite'"}
{"text":"Hello to all my fellow Chicagoians and to one and all!

FINALLY ...... Portillios is here........ I warned AL'S ITALIAN BEEF  that once Portillos arrives people will see what a real CHICAGO ITALIAN BEEF tastes like....and hey AL'S....notice the price on the beef?   REASONABLE AND YUMMY!  


So, PORTILLO'S has been open since TUESDAY (4 days ago) and it is MOBBED!  And for good reason.

Like everyone elses reviews.... it was the BOMB!

The beef was totally and competely DELISHHHHHHH!

Perfectly \"wet\" and and ample amount of beef and the sweet and hot peppers gave it that extra burst of flavor.

The hubby had a chili cheese dog which he enjoyed, but come on now....why do we really go to Portillo's?

It's for the beef and DEBRA'S wonderful, creamy, rich Chocolate Cake!

OMG.... The hubby thought I was crazy for talking so much about how great this cake was and after taking one bite of mine.... he quickly took possession and all that was left for me was the last bite....which was just as good as the first bite and even better than I remember it to be.

The lines were massive and I commend the entire staff for moving everything along quickly and efficently.

It was well worth the wait and I cant wait for the Tempe location to open.

GO.....TRY......It's a MUST!  Now you can try a REAL taste of Chicago!

Bon Appetite' and welcome Cubbies...to spring training"}

{"text":"Drove all the way to portillos.  You know how that intersection is a pia.  Ordered a dry beef sandwich which sauce in the side. Got home and no sauce.  Called and best they could do was a refund.  Basically they said, sorry, your sol.  Too many other options in the valley for this level of service."}
{"text":"1st time dining in w/ my husband & two girls (3 & 11 months)

Yum, the Italian Beef Sandwich is great! I ordered mine how most on here recommended; With Sweet & Spicy Peppers. I didn't get mine w/ extra gravy but still yummy..

Not really a kid friendly place (no kid menu, or child specific anything) which was a bit of a disappointment since most things on menu are large portioned.

Only negative experience of my trip was when I attempted to purchase a dessert. I return to the counter to order a Strawberry Short Cake (to bring home) but the cashier insisted, pursued, bribed and continued on selling me a chocolate Cake Shake...which was annoying after I explained 2-3 times that I didn't want to order that. Which he then said he had a competition going with another staff? I don't know, but I ended up leaving without buying any dessert just so I could get away from the cashier!  I wish he would've just let me breathe & purchased what I wanted :( 


Otherwise, everything else was super yummy. I'll just use the drive thru next visit, lol."}
{"text":"Bad service. I ordered my food to go and a simple hotdog and medium Coke Classic. 30 minutes passed and still no food. Asked the lady calling out the numbers and she just stated \"I don't know\". Waited anoter 10 minutes and nothing. Finally got tired of waiting and asked for a refund.( Simple hotdog and a medium coke) .  I spent 40 minutes waitingand nothing. Let me remind you again this was a hot dog and a  coke, not  a steak or lobster!!! Very disappointed, will not return."}
{"text":"Was excited about the hot dog experience considering the reviews however the hot dogs were below average. We ordered the signature original hot dog and it was not good, I much prefer the Costco hot dog hands down. The only reason I would even consider going back is because their onion rings were phenomenal. One of the best I've ever had. Chili fries were also decent. However considering they specialize in hot dogs, I think they are in no comparison to what I'm used to back home (Seattle)."}
{"text":"Everything from here has been good. It has attempted to change my opinion about crinkle cut french fries. Still on the fence about those.

If you go to get the hotdog, spend the little extra to get the Premium/Jumbo dog. Its the same bun and fixings, but the meat quality is like the difference between Nathan's and a highschool cafetera. In my opinion they should stop offering the standard quality hot dog and just go all out on the jumbos. They aren't doing themselves any justice by trying to pass off that crappy tube of animal product as food. For some reason the two dogs are just that different!"}
{"text":"Great food and vintage atmosphere that has the look like its separate places to dine within the establishment for all occasions. Lots of menu choices and Wonderful patio seating as well if u choose to sit outside"}
{"text":"I've driven by the Portillo's in Tempe many times and have wanted to try it.  Today I noticed a Portillo's has very recently opened near my house in Scottsdale.  As I was already at Barnes & Noble, I walked over to give it a try.  And like the March Madness games currently on television, Portillo's Hot Dogs is \"one and done.\"  I will not be returning due to many reasons.

(1) The place is called \"Portillo's Hot Dogs.\"  Therefore, I ordered their signature menu item, their beef hot dog with everything on it.  When I got my paper bag of food, there at the bottom under my fries was the smallest hot dog I've seen in a soggy bun that was squished from being wrapped up tightly.  It brought back memories of the 1970s commercial \"Where's the beef?\"  Really, the hot dogs at the Diamondbacks' baseball games are a higher quality and that's a very low standard.  The circumference of the hot dog was smaller than a dime.  It's that small.  And for being their signature menu item, my expectation was for a quality hot dog that was plump and juicy.  Maybe their signature item is actually a kids' hot dog???  They should provide a bigger hot dog in a more appealing manner.

(2) The place is loud.  It just gave me a headache to have to listen to a constant barrage of \"Order Number 240.  Order Number 236.  Order ...\" constantly blaring over the speakers.  Seriously, come up with a better, less obnoxious way to match people with their food.

(3) The whole eating experience has the feeling of disorganized hurry mode.  The whole process of ordering to picking up the food is disorganized.  Perhaps they should slow down a bit and actually listen to the customer.  My order was to eat there, but they give it to me in a bag.  I told them my order was to eat there and had to request a tray.  I really don't think they're focused on listening in the rush to push people through the assembly line of ordering.

I will not be returning to give them another shot at my business.  I chalk this up as a learning experience."}
{"text":"Crowded and overpriced imho. First time trying the place and always see it crowded so thought I'd try too. Crowded but they were efficient. Moved through line quickly. I don't know if it was because of the noise, but my order was wrong. Chili cheese dog with onions sounds like nothing else on the menu. Chili. Cheese. Dog. Anyway, they write your order on a bag in their own shorthand so it was not possible to know if she wrote it wrong or not. Either way, sucked to get a whatever dog with all kinds of stuff to pick off. Dog was just ok and I would have said 3 stars if my order had been correct. I should have looked at the receipt I suppose, before assuming. Average at best. Might be back to try the Italian Beef.

Also the fries tasted like high school food."}
{"text":"Everything here is lack luster poor flavor for a simple fish sandwich and the poopy seed fruit salad came completely drenched in so much dressing that tasted more like mayonnaise that I didn't even want to finish it  basically it's an average burger joint that try's to have flare but the flare doesn't make up for bad flavor , I normally don't like to give bad reviews but this was a big disappointment."}
{"text":"Meh - what is the big deal here folks? Honestly?

Lord knows that Phoenix is packed (PACKED!) with homesick Chicagoans  who miss the comfort foods of their childhood.

I will say that I was impressed with the building and structure - this is a huge palatial restaurant, and I love the little retro detailing inside. It is eye candy at it's finest, and the place seems to anticipate a massive following based on the cavernous size. Neon everywhere, cool old photos (I'm from L.A. so the Chicago memorabilia was fun to look at). 

But in a way it all seemed kind of fake - surreal really - like a Disneyland Main Street USA - or a movie set. It feels like they are trying too hard... to make a new place that intends to expand to multiple locations feel like some kind of old style place you grew up in as a kid. 

So in the end, this place is a chain... and the food tastes that way.

With all the talk about the amazing PORTILLO'S - well gushes really (mostly from ex-Chicago pals who raved about this sacred shrine), I had high expectations.

The (mostly young) staff seemed very well trained, clean-cut and knowledgeable in the In 'N Out Burger kinda way.

Admittedly I have only eaten at Portillo's once - about 10:30 PM last night (Sat). I ordered their (supposedly) famous chopped salad and let me cut to the chase by saying that this was basically a salad you could get at any TGI Fridays or other non-cult fast food joint. 

I watched it being made before being hand tossed - tasteless & cheap cubed while meat chicken (like from a can), little bits of macaroni, cheap (mostly) iceberg lettuce (menu says Romaine too but I count not detect any) -blue cheese (didn't taste any) -  Bac-Os bacon bits - and a VERY (overly) strong creamy horseradish dressing. Horseradish? Yup. 

This is NOT a great salad folks - give me a break  What a joke. 

They should have more appropriately named this stinker a \"horseradish chopped salad\" as that is exactly what it tasted like.All horseradish!

I know, I know...shoulda ordered their world famous hotdog or Italian Beef huh? I wasn't in the mood for meat last night, but I will give Portillo's another shot some day. 

But so far my initial impression is this place is based on the fantasies and exaggerated memories of the many lonely heart Chicago natives who miss their basic staples. 

Apparently the Portillo's genius/mogul owners have big plans to open another location soon at Tempe Marketplace. Woo-hoo! Go get 'em guys. Best of luck - over expansion too quickly literally killed the once high flying Krispy Kreme Doughnut operation in Phoenix - why not take your time and improve the food a little? Best way to kill a cult is to over expand - there are only so many Chicago people drinking the Kool Aid, right?

There is nothing wrong mind you with simple food like dogs and burgers made exceedingly well -  but so far TED'S Hot Dog's in Tempe is the real deal for quality and authenticity. 

The authenticity of a TED's looks and tastes REAL. 

Portillo's may kick ass here in Phoenix, but so far I am not at all impressed with the food. Hot dogs and burgers are a dime a dozen."}
{"text":"Totally awesome place just like how it is in Chicago.  Great beef sandwich hot dogs and more. Make surre you dip the beef sandwiches"}
{"text":"I'm from Chicago & this is my go to spot when I need home food. The last 2x this month I've been there I noticed the service was poor, but tonight sucked. The girl standing outside in the drive thru didn't great me, but stood several feet away yelling what I wanted (what if I had never been there before?).I sat in line for at least 20 mins w/ a mere 3 cars in front of me. Arriving at the window I asked what my total was & she looked at me like I was stupid. Next window got my food w/out an apology for the wait. Got home, my food is cold & not a single napkin for a dipped beef! I will not be going here again & this location is giving Chicago a bad name."}
{"text":"I just don't get the hate from the one and two star reviews. Portillo's is THE BEST.

Yep, I'm from Chicago and have loved going to Portillo's for years. When they opened in Scottsdale I was more than willing to wait one hour in the drive thru line to get my fix.

Tonight on the way home from Chandler I was advised that we would be going to Portillo's as my partner had a craving for their food. Don't have to twist my arm, any day with Portillo's for lunch or dinner is a GREAT DAY!

Tonight we both opted for hot dogs and fries. The order came out quick and it was right. I've rarely had an order come out wrong and if it was they fixed it right away.

If you're coming here the things to try include:
Hot Dogs (with everything)
Fries
Italian Beef with Sweet Peppers - Dipped!
Chopped Salad - if it's To Go ask them to \"Toss It\" otherwise the dressing is on the side
Chocolate Cake Shake - only once in a while...they are addicting!
These are my favorites"}
{"text":"I was so happy to see that another Chicago favorite was coming to Phoenix. Whenever I was back in Chicago I always made it a point to stop at Portillo's and get my fix. Chopped Salad, Hot Dogs, Italian Beef, everything on the menu is great.

We first tried this location on the Sunday after they opened. I figured the craziness and long lines would have died down by then. Boy was I wrong. The line was out the door and the drive-thru was packed. We opted for the drive-thru and it took about 45 minutes. It was so good I would have waited longer!

Since then we've been back several times and will continue to go back. It's just that good. No, Portillo's is GREAT!

If you're ordering the hot dog, get with everything including the hot peppers. Want to try an Italian Beef? Order it dipped with Sweet Peppers you won't be sorry. The Chopped Salad is another one of my favorites, but if you're ordering it to go ask them to toss it. Otherwise the dressing is on the side and it's not as good. If you have a meeting or a hot date ask them to leave the onions out of the Chopped Salad. It takes away a little of the flavor, but your date, partner, spouse or significant other will thank you.

Oh, and if you feel like indulging give the Chocolate Cake Shake a try. It's wonderful, but just don't have too many or you'll have to hit the gym for twice as long every day.

Gotta go now. Writing this review made me hungry for a Chopped Salad."}
{"text":"Fresh, hot, cooked to order Chicago-style food. They do it right here. Will definitely repeat. Get the beef dipped, thank me later."}
{"text":"Short of Wrigley field, I have not found a better hot dog than Portillo's.

BTW cake shakes are probably the most underappreciated invention ever.

Go to Portillo's, you'll love it!"}
{"text":"Great place if you like Chicago style food, i lived just south of chicago for over 30 years and now live in phoenix.  i love going to this place. the chicago style hot dogs are amazing. everything there is great."}
{"text":"I recommend catering your next party with Portillo's.  We usually get  a few pounds of Italian beef, chop salad, and tamales.  Their chocolate cake is excellent too."}
{"text":"I'd never have imagined finding a Midwestern/Chicago staple so far away from the Midwest! This AZ location is set up exactly as the other ones I'd been to in the Chicagoland area - you can see everything done behind the counter, the lines and tables are the same, etc. 
Thankfully when I met up with one my friends here the lines were nonexistent and it wasn't terribly busy. First things first - gotta order a Cake Shake! She wasn't aware of their existence, so at my insistence she ordered one - hallelujah! I also got a plain hotdog with peppers to liven things up, and I knew a #CakeShake wouldn't hold me over until dinner. The employees were nice, the place was clean, all wonderful. Cannot wait to return for a more proper Chicago meal."}
{"text":"Nothing satisfies my taste for Chicago like a large beef from Portillo it will make your tounge beat your brains in!"}
{"text":"Visited for the first time this weekend. The food is great, but unless you go in knowing what you want and where to go, it can be a little overwhelming. The dining room is huge, packed and loud. It took us a couple seconds to get our bearings and see where the line formed, then another couple minutes to read over the gigantic menu. We got Hot dogs and a Polish sausage, and everything was really delicious!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place but the service has steadily declined to complete dog #%^#.  The past three times i have been to this location I paid a minimum of $30 for food.    I have been handed the wrong orders twice before my order and handed them back bags of food meant for other customers.  This might explain why on my most recent visit we waited over 20 minutes for our to go order.  Meanwhile bags of food were handed out to three different vehicles behind us.  I am sure one of those our order.  When we got our food it was hot and we made the 20 min drive home. We got home and the Hamburger with bacon and no mayo was a cheeseburger with mayo.  The cheeseburger with no mayo or tomatoes had plenty of both.  The Italian sausage with sweet peppers, hot peppers and grilled onions had only hot peppers.  Here is a tip.  If you pull up to the window and there is a plump rotund employee standing between your car and the window maybe the rotund guy should get outta the way or stick around to hand me my damn food.  Instead I had to get out of my car to grab my food when he needed to walk back to the first window to chat.  This place is probably way too overstaffed and just a mess.  Also why don't you you let me pull all the way up to the menu incase i want to order something different.  No i don't have the whole damn menu committed to memory.  Clearly your employees do not either.  I will not be going back here anymore.  It is just not worth the hassle."}
{"text":"Havent had everything on their menu which is very extensive.  First item up.  Chicago dog which I rate very highly.  The Italian Beef...ehh...not so much.  Thought it lacked depth of flavor.  The cheese fries are unstoppable...although I dislike the fact that they serve the cheese up in a plastic cup on the side.  I've also had the Halibut Filet sandwich.  Good not great.  The decor in this place is something to see.  Heard so many good things about this place...been twice...and I am still on the fence on if I would go back."}
{"text":"This place actually has really good salads. I tried the Southwest BBQ salad this past Sunday and it was spot on- hot bbq chicken topped with tortilla crisps, black beans, corn and pico de gallo. I will be back! ****4 Stars."}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE

I went to this place a couple of times when they were another restaurant and wasn't prepared for the huge change in look inside.  I'm not impressed by theme restaurants and in fact, would rather avoid them but Portillo's \"theme\" is more like a neighborhood.  I like it.  It makes me feel like I'm part of eating with a lot of other people but not like they're sitting right on top of me.  I'm sure they didn't have a lot of choice when they remodeled the building but the drive through is plain weird ... you have to cross the drive through lane to get to the restaurant's front door from the parking lot and I'm surprised as many people make it alive as they do.  It's not customer friendly. Neither is the small outdoor dining area which happens to be right next to said drive through lane ... \"excuse me, would you like fries with your carbon monoxide fumes\"?

CUSTOMER SERVICE

Sad to say the only person who cracked a smile and said a word was the young lady whose job is to clean the tables, and it's not her job to talk to customers.  The worst was the ONE person who should be the friendliest and most helpful, the girl who took our order. She was bored silly and showed it. I know she meets a thousand people a day, but that's her job. If it's your first time in a restaurant you will have questions and don't immediately know what you should order ... you don't need a sigh and a bad attitude to make it more unpleasant.

FOOD

I cheated before I took this test (I used to live in Chicago in my college days and used to eat at The Dog House).  I know Portillo's well and I also know that no matter what the history of a place is, once they franchise and expand they become a chain with a name.  Don't expect this to be the same as your distant memories or the original Portillo's locations in Chicago but that being said, the Italian Beef sandwich I had (just beef and extra wet) was better than average, but maybe just a little bland.  Caution - some people get weirded out if their sandwich bread is soaking wet, it's an acquired taste.  Just trust me, it's supposed to be that way.

PRICE

Here's where Portillo's wins big time.  I'm still stinging from a few weeks ago when I paid over $8 bucks for a burger and \"value\" drink at Burger King.  They're not alone either, all of the big chain fast food places have suddenly gone off the deep end on price, even a basic Big Mac with value drink is over $5 bucks.  PS: I rarely go to those places anyway and they now have done an EXCELLENT job telling me they never want me as their customer again, hence finding places like Portillo's where I can eat real food in a nice sit-down restaurant and walk out paying less that at the kiddie places is a singular thrill.

I would rate them 4 stars but it's getting so hard to find places with decent food at reasonable prices anymore so (unless they do something stupid like raise their prices) I'll give them that extra star based on being an excellent value."}
{"text":"Be prepared to be whisked (rushed) into line with barely a moment to review the menu, although this is how they manage to serve so many people so quickly (which they do well).  We were standing off to the side, trying to decide what to order and were \"told\" to move into line to order long before we were ready.  There didn't appear to be anywhere you could stand in order to take your time deciding what you want.  Being new to this restaurant, we found that a stressful way to begin a dining experience.  

The food is tasty and price is good.  The Chocolate Cake Shake is WOW!!!  A rich, creamy shaky with bits of chocolate cake mixed in.  SUPER YUMMY!! 

For a fast food place, they have a good selection of items to choose from:  nice looking salads, burgers, sausage sandwiches and, of course, the hotdogs.

I would prefer a more relaxing atmosphere (it gets pretty noisy - reminded me of Nathan's Hotdogs in NY), but wouldn't mind eating here again in  the future."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal Chicago style. I was born and raised in Chicago so I know what the food is supposed to taste like. I love the Italian Beef and Maxwell Street Polish!"}
{"text":"Wow so organized! So fast and so good!! Will be back soon!!! That beef and cheddar was everything!!"}
{"text":"Terrific for a \"let's get a quick bite place\". Everything from Chicago beef, sausage and peppers to hot dogs (Polish) too. System excellent, good place to visit.  
Prices are reasonable and quality of food is good."}
{"text":"This place is good for those who like this kind of thing.  Well, duh, you say!  

I've been here several times with my family. They typically get chili-cheese dogs, Italian sausages, fries, and sodas. So far, no complaints from any of them, and the kids want to go back any time we're in the area. 

I've had everything from salads to burgers, hotdogs (Chicago-style and chili-cheese), tamales, even the Italian beef (regular and large... and dry, wet, dipped, etc.) and whatever they call the combination Italian sausage + Italian beef thing. Everything I have had has been fine. I think the chili is good, and the Italian beef with cheese and spicy peppers is probably my favorite. Get the gravy on the side so you can control how much goes on there. Without the gravy, the sandwich can be a little dry, and when they \"dip\" it, the bread tends to fall apart before I'm finished with the sandwich -- and I eat pretty fast.

My only complaints are that the poppyseed muffins they serve with the salads tend to be dry and very bland, and the \"famous\" chocolate cake is not anything I find terribly special. For that matter, the salads have a nice variety, but I think they might be a little bland overall, too. But, I tend to like things with a little spice or vinegar tang to them, so take that critique for what it is worth. Keep in mind that you need to pick up your salads near the ordering line, not at the place where you pickup all of your other food and drinks.

The lines move fast and the people taking the orders are friendly and efficient. The team that makes the food and calls out the numbers are likewise nice, and usually seem happy to grab a drink refill if you hang out by the order pickup area with your cup."}
{"text":"Recently relocated from northwest suburban Chicago to north Phoenix. The one thing I learned early on is that there are many people from Chicago that live here. When I learned that there was a Portillo's here I immediately made the trip to have dinner. This has become one of my favorite restaurants. I'm pleased to report that everything from the food and the style of restaurant is as I expected and I love this place! I come here as often when I can and I always feel like a piece of Chicago came here when I moved."}
{"text":"Great location. Great menu.  Great price. We definitely recommend visiting here. The service was fast, and the hot dogs and beef sandwiches are just like in Chicago '"}
{"text":"I saw a line out the door when I was on my way home from work the other day, so I figured it must be a great place.  I checked out the menu online and decided I wanted to take my parents over there to try it.  
Now my dad loves Italian beef sandwiches, so i usually take him to Luke's across the freeway.  So sorry to Luke's for trying something new.  We got there about 11:30 am, just right before the lunch rush but looks like that started pretty early.  The outdoor patio was full with customers and the line inside was pretty long.  Now let me tell you that I've never seen so many people working in a restaurant before but it was definitely needed!  
The first thing you have to do is get in line to order your food.  Keep in mind that if you want salads, you would need to go to two different areas to pick up your food.  But like I said, there are lots or people working that its pretty quick for the order coming out.  Finding a table was no that big of a problem, so I had the Asian chicken salad and my dad had the Italian beef.  My mom and nephew had the Chicago style hot dogs.  The salad was very good and a good portion and i took a bite of the Italian beef and it was awesome.  You have a choice of having your Italian beef sandwich dipped in Au jous to make the meal more juicy which is what i recommend.  
The place is very good but is you want to avoid the lunch crowd, come after 12:30pm, that's when the crowds kinda lighten up."}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few times and I ordered an Italian beef each time and was a little underwhelmed. The other day I decided to go inside instead of running through the drive through and I paid a little more attention to the menu and realized I was ordering the sandwich wrong. After realizing my mistake I ordered it the proper way (dipped) and it was leaps and bounds better than getting it dry. Totally my fault and now I'm writing a review to help direct people here. Also tried the onion rings for the first time and they were excellent. The cake shakes are a bit heavy so I suggest getting a small unless you're sharing it, but they're pretty damn good as well. Definitely will be hitting them up more frequently."}
{"text":"Ended up here thanks to a fellow Yelper who told me to check it out. Went in today and ordered a jumbo hot dog and a cheeseburger. You'd think hot dogs would be mostly idiot proof, but it's honestly hard to find a good one when eating out. The burger was pretty good as well. I ordered a small cake shake and only got through about a third of it, but it tastes exactly like you would imagine. Also, Chynna, who took our order was very nice and helpful in answering our questions. She's also great at making you want to try everything on the menu. Hit this place up if you want a good hot dog, I plan on going back."}
{"text":"First time and it looked incredible. I usually like to reserve reviews for when I've gone a few times but we were really hot and cold on this one. You order your food on a line, and someone is taking your order before you even get to the register, and writing it on a paper bag. They give you an order number and call it when your items are ready. I didn't like that the salads and sandwiches were picked up in different places. They were using a speaker to call the numbers for sandwiches, but for salads they were just calling out, and we couldn't hear a thing since we were clear across the restaurant. 

The food itself was a mixed bag for us. My husband liked his Italian Steak sandwich. The crinkle cut fries were simple and good. I absolutely despised my apple walnut chicken salad. The chicken was chewy, and COLD. 

I should go back and try a burger or a dog, and maybe I will on a future visit, but I don't want to spend anymore time here this weekend since the salad was so disappointing."}
{"text":"So glad we decided to try this place!  The hamburger was good but the big winner was the Italian Strawberry Shortcake and iced tea. Perfect for a hot summer day!!!"}
{"text":"First time eating at Portillos. Service was great and they were very friendly.  Food was awesome."}
{"text":"First time here... this place is apparently a pretty popular hot dog joint. I was disappointed to say the least. The hot dog link had a very thick film around its exterior which made it very chewy. Oh.... and then there is the tamale I ordered. Why do they even offer this on their menu?? I'll let the picture of it speak for itself. The picture looks a lot better than it tastes."}
{"text":"I'm from Chicago. This is a Chicago staple. You have to know what to order, not everything is great. After reading some reviews there seems to be a misconception about the Italian beef and oil. The beef is cooked in beef stock with seasonings, so what you see on the wrapper and the liquid that comes with the sandwich is not oil. The right way to actually order this sandwich is dipped, so that the entire sandwich gets dipped in the stock before its wrapped. I order mine with sweet and hot peppers on top. It's the best Italian beef recipe you can ask for. Their cheese fires are amazing. I would say salads are the #2 best item as well as hot dogs obviously, followed by the chocolate shake.  Nice to see this chain make it out to the west coast."}
{"text":"First experience at Portillo's was at the one in Chicago. When I found out there was one in Scottsdales, I was excited! Went out there for GIANTS spring training and had to make a stop at this place. It was just as delicious as I remember!

My go to milkshake flavor is chocolate but bf ordered the strawberry and it was YUM-MAY!"}
{"text":"First of all if you don't give 4 or 5 stars for Portillo's you are just a hater that's wants to complain about everything.  Every thing on the menu is great.   Service is good.   Only thing you could complain about is the line but that's what happens when a place is good.  It takes a minute.  If I ever have had a problem at Portillo's they take care of it immediately but if you don't bring it to their attention they don't know.  So give this place the rating they deserve for their great food service and atmosphere and quit complaining about everything"}
{"text":"After reading Joyce W's review, I starved myself all day so I could relive her experience in person.  Upon walking in, I noticed the place was huge.  So many places to sit.  I liked the yesteryear vibe.  Thankfully, I followed a young couple in, as I had no idea what to do.  I found out, you need to walk to the back of the restaurant to place your order.

As I waited for my order to come up, I enjoyed the young lady calling out the tickets as they came up.

One-nine-zero, you're my hero.  One-nine-one, your order is done.  One-nine-two, we've got an order right here for you. One-nine-three, come see me. One-nine-four, wait no more.   One-nine-five, look alive.  One-nine-six, come get your Portillos fix.  One-nine-seven, (I didn't hang long enough to hear this rhyme).  One-nine-eight, no more wait.  One-nine-nine, it's your time to dine.  Two-oh-oh, you're good to go.

When I sat down with my order, I bit into the signature hot dog, and it has a good snap.  However, my beef and cheddar croissant was so greasy it literally turned its paper wrapping translucent.  I texted Joyce a photo, and she remarked that they must hate me.  Yes, of course, it all made sense now.  The bread was too thick for me, and I tossed most of it.  The crinkle cut fries were okay.  I'll try the pasta, ribs or salad next time, with my dog."}
{"text":"Went there the 2nd week it was open and it was beyond bad.

I figured I would give it a 2nd shot but sadly they need to close this hole down.

Food is over-priced and poor quality, staff has a \"we don't care\" attitude and the management seems to think they are all gods who are there for you to worship and not help the customer.

Why do people post good reviews about this place and rave how great it is when it is pathetic..

Wake up people you are getting ripped off by this waste of space..."}
{"text":"Love, love, love! I had yummy Italian beef...the hot peppers are a must!  The atmosphere is great and I cannot wait to come back for a Chicago dog ASAP. I finished my meal with the Chocolate Cake shake and I'm sure no other shakes compare! Delish!!!!"}
{"text":"This place has the best Italian beef sandwich I've ever had!!! Will be back on Saturday!!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty darn good. My dad brought me here saying that his wife was a fan and got him hooked on it. It's very Chicago Italian style with lots of cool memorabilia around the walls. You can also order at different stations depending on what kind of food you are looking for. I had the pork sandwich with peppers and jalapenos. Very good! My dad had a salad what she said was pretty good but I don't really feel like this is a place to come for salad. We both had root beer floats that were pretty good except the ice cream tasted a bit like air. I plan to bring a friend here who is really into Italian food and we will see what he thinks. I would definitely try again as it was pretty good Chicago-style Italian food!"}
{"text":"I love going to Portillo's! I used to come here twice a week when I lived close by. I usually don't like when places have a large menu, but I think it works great here. I can always find something to eat when I am dieting or indulging in a cheat meal. I hope they decide to open a location in central Phoenix."}
{"text":"super over rated.  tried three separate times, and each visit was pretty disappointing. italian beef just ok, and on one occasion the beef was a little gamey.  the rolls are average at best.  and the sweet peppers are soggy junk (but the hot peppers are good).  hotdogs were just ok, plenty of other good options out there.  fries similar to crappy frozen ore-ida fries.  amazed people like this place.

portillos.  oy vey.
an equal dog can be had
at a circle K."}
{"text":"Great throw back decor - its fun inside!  Its like a In-n-out for hot dogs outside - but cooler inside for sure.  They have a great system implemented for speed.    The popularity of this place - its constant lines - I just don't get it... I definitely like the dogs and the sausage - nothing super in my opinion.  They have a decent strawberry shortcake and strawberry shake.  I think its definitely worth a visit if your considering it.  I get a giggle how they call out your order when its ready when its busy.  Its one of my Dad's favorites for lunch... If the decor wasn't so cool I'd personally be giving this place a A-OK 3 star."}
{"text":"It's not quite the same as Chicago, but it's still awesome. The beefs just don't get wet enough here when you order it dipped or wet.I don't understand why they charge for hot peppers... 60 cents. The chocolate cake shake is diabetes in a glass, way too sweet and mushy for me. The salads are great, but who goes here for salad!!!!! Eat the big beef! Dipped with mozzarella... I better not seeing anyone eating a salad! The service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"I'm going to teach everyone a secret. Get plain hotdogs nothing on them. Preferably 3-4. Then get yourself a large order of cheese fries. Now put the fries to the side. Take your hot dogs and dip them in the cheese sauce they give you. I promise you that you'll never taste a better hot dog combo in your life. It's 1:30 in the morning and I wish I could go right now. Please open one more north in the valley. Preferably cave creek and Tatum road so I could eat every meal there without having to go far! Haha waited 10 minutes in the drive thru once and they gave me free cake for waiting. That's customer service! Love this place."}
{"text":"Went back again to try Hot Dog and fries and ice tea ! Hot dog was warmer and bun not soggy like first time! Ask for fries less salty but again were very salty but glad they were because a guy came around and asked how food was and gave me a piece of Chocalate Cake for the salty fries!:)) yummy ! Cake a must! Lots of fun people to chat with while waiting and eating!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty decent. It's nothing exceptional but it's reliable. I come for lunch semi regularly and the food is solid. Service can be slow though, it's hit or miss here. I will say the chocolate cake is amazing though."}
{"text":"Nothing to brag about. Not really sure what the hype is all about. The restaurant is loud and chaotic. The elders seem to have a hard time hearing in there. I had the chili cheese dog. I've not had one in years and it seems even coney dogs at Sonic are much better. At least I can say I've tried it."}
{"text":"Love it!  The dipped Italian Beef with peppers is so good!  The onion rings have a nice light batter...get cheese sauce to dunk.   Get the strawberry shortcake to take home for later.   Busy place but very efficient and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Delicious. Well run except the bathroom was closed for cleaning the whole time I was there. I had onion rings, nice and crispy, not over breaded or slimy. The everything hot dog was fantastic. Nice, chewy bun, held together for every bite. Stuffed full of all the good stuff. Hubby had the cheese burger and fries. He said the burger was actually juicy, like a restaurant burger not like fast food. Yummy curly fries too."}
{"text":"Hot dog. Good. Cheese fries. Could be better. Was given regular fries with a small cup of cheese which tasted of nothing. Literally was just, I can't even describe it. It was not cheese... I would come back for the hotdog though. Very soft buns."}
{"text":"I came here and got ribs , was horrible & fake !! I rather have a McRib sandwich!  I get better service and McDonald's. That's is the true ! I been here many times and I can't believe this service and the food ! It's like nobody wants to work today geeesh!"}
{"text":"Delicious food... Had the Italian beef sandwich combo with sausage. Very friendly and efficient staff along with reasonable prices...definitely will be back as Portillo's may very well become my fast food to go place!

In fact, I ate there twice today! I went back later on in the day and had their cheddar and beef croissant which was to die for...Also had a chocolate shake but it wasn't rich enough for my taste.

The staff is very well organized and despite going back at night, we waited a very short amount of time for our food.

Well...Maybe I'm not such a devoted fan after all...Last time I went thru the drive thru, they screwed up my order. I called them to let them know - and the manager said he would send me a certificate...well, I never got anything...so they're full of it...but I still like them no matter what...I don't feel like crying because the sausage was missing in action..."}
{"text":"Eh, I guess I just don't get the hype but then again I'm not from Chicagoland so Portillo's doesn't tug at my heartstrings with some great wave of childhood nostalgia. FWIW, I'm also no fan of Chicago style pizza either...

Today I had Portillo's for lunch, a chili cheese hot dog & cheese fries.  They do not offer Dr. Pepper so I had bottled water. I liked that they sell spring water and for only 99 cents. Usually with bottled water you pay twice that for only 'purified drinking water' so definitely nice they had the real deal.

My food was delivered hot and fresh but simply lacked flavor. I found no condiment other than ketchup and even that wasn't available in to go form. The hot dog was all beef and had the snap of natural casing, but the chili was bland and featured beans (an abomination to any old-fashioned traditionalist-minded Texan).  It just needed SOMETHING, even salt & black pepper would have helped.  The fries were hot and a little salty but the cheese sauce was like what you get on bad ballpark nachos.

Overall just unimpressed..."}
{"text":"It's por' till ohs. Like pillows.
Food good. Made fresh to order...not fast food out of the freezer.  It takes a while. It's worth the wait. Don't eat too much..you need dessert. I mean it. ..you NEED A DESSERT.  Don't leave without one. You won't regret it. Thanks for reading. Go eat...why are you just sitting there."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place!!! I always get a beef and cheddar croissant with extra sweet peppers and I highly recommend it. The ordering process is a little overdone and confusing at times. The place always seems overstaffed yet it takes longer than expected to receive your food. Still the food is good so I keep going back."}
{"text":"This place hits the spot when I want something extra yummy. I love the Italian beef sandwich with some hot crispy fries. I have to be careful to not visit to often only when I'm craving. I would recommend."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed with this place - maybe it's because there was so much hype about it before I went. The drive thru is strange - someone in a hat walks next to your car taking your order, but there is no menu board so you have to ask for a menu while a \"supervisor\" yells at them to walk more. Then there is the food. The sausage and peppers was so dry and totally overwhelmed by the bread. Maybe I will give it another try when they have been opened longer."}
{"text":"Great Italian sausage and beef! Get it with or without sweet or hot peppers and you will be happy! I recommend getting a combo dipped"}
{"text":"I am a teacher and was wearing my #redfored shirt. I had spent all day at the capitol in meetings to get more funding for education. I stopped at Portillos for my very first time with some fellow teachers to eat some food before we went to our 2nd jobs. The woman calling out order numbers to pick up your order gave us dirty looks. Then before I got my order, she asked me if I was a teacher and I responded that I was. She then stated that \"what I was doing to children was wrong\" and basically wanted to argue politics with me and tell me how terrible teachers are. I took my food and I went outside to eat with my friends as I had no desire to engage with someone when I was simply trying to get something to eat during a long day. I cannot believe that Portillos allows their employees to voice their political views and berate their customers. I called on my way to my 2nd job to talk to the manager. He said he would talk to her about her behavior. This was my first and LAST visit to Portillos."}
{"text":"Hugely overrated. I get it though, there's few good Chicago joints in town so Chicagoan's have to come here for this kind of food.  It's good for what it is and the service really is fantastic but the hype has caused crazy long lines which don't justify the wait in my book."}
{"text":"Update on my review! So wanted to give Portillos another chance considering it was pretty good when I first tried it in the past when it first came out. Now it's really going down the drain and I see them going out of business in the near future. It's the staff working there that make it so DISGUSTING! We went there tonight and tell me why there are literally 3 guys walking around with rags with no clean tables?! We ended up sitting at a dirty table and wiped it down ourselves. While we were eating there was this really rude, ignorant worker/employee just opening and closing the trash while we were eating!! He was making it smell like hot garbage while we were eating! That's so effin gross! My fiancÃ© even told this nasty employee hey could you stop opening the trash a million times while we are eating here??!\" Then this guy just ignores the fact he said that and continues to do that! Like excuse me we just paid to go out to eat on a Friday night and he just made us have the worst experience! Also while we were first getting our food I seen this other employee mess with her nose and then gave me my bottled water! I'll honestly say I'll never come back to this establishment!"}
{"text":"Stay away!  The food here is worse than pig slop.  We had a chili dog and an italian beef sandwich.  The presentation (both sloppy goopy messes) was absolutely awful and the taste of the food was even worse.  This was probably the most disgusting meal I've ever had ANYWHERE.  You can get a better chili dog 1/2 mile down the road at Weinerschnitzel (and for 1/3 the price).  The fries were just like the Ore Ida's you buy frozen at the grocery store and bake in an oven.  Limp and tasteless.  You Chicagoans must be easily impressed (or have no taste) if you think this place is good.  One more interesting fact....this is one of the few places that doesn't have a link on your receipt for a review/feedback to the home office about your experience....gee, I wonder why!!"}
{"text":"We are from Chicago and Portillo's is the real deal. Love the I-Beef sandwich. They run a classy and tight operation. Always stop in when in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Awesome service, great food. Don't have to wait long unless They are really busy. Lots of options to choice from."}
{"text":"I have been to Portillos twice now, and the service and food are incredible.  The prices are pretty good too.  I can't wait for the Tempe location to open."}
{"text":"We stopped by Thursday for dinner and it was very busy.  We ordered pasta and tried the Chicken Parmesan and  the Ravioli.  The food was excellent and very generous.  The order and pick up procedure is a little confusing but we figured it out.  The pasta is ordered in the same location but the pick up location is different from the sandwiches and the drinks come from a different window. They offer free refills on drinks if you ask at the window.  The service is fast and friendly serving a lot of folks.
I would recommend this for anyone and great for groups."}
{"text":"I'm not the typical customer, eating mostly vegetarian and vegan these days. But, I went with some friends, and was pleasantly surprised. They have 3 sandwiches listed as \"meatless\", although 2 of them have fish. I ordered the roasted veggie, which was crazy good. They also have salads and a few other non meat items. Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"4.5 stars

I have passed this Portillo's many times.  If I am headed down this way, it is usually down the street a few more miles to go to Ted's.  My intent was to get some dogs at Ted's again today but when I pulled off the 202 and McClintock, I had a strong craving for Portillo's cheese fries.  Something about that magical cup of hot, melted cheese sauce reeled me in.

I finally figured out the perfect order at Portillo's.  2 Jumbo Dogs and a Large Cheese Fries.  This comes in at just under $10.00 and it is well worth it.  I have had other things at Portillo's (sausages, Italian beef, salads, etc) but nothing is as good as their Jumbo Hot Dogs.  I get mine topped with mustard, onion and that neon green relish.  They are a hefty sized dog with a little bit of a snap to them.  These dogs are laid in a nicely steamed poppy seed bun. They are flat out delicious and filling!  For their fries, they use a crinkle cut fry.  They aren't the best fries in the world but because of the crinkle cut design, they are the perfect fry to dip in that molten lava cheese sauce.  It coats all the nooks and crannies of the fry and makes it one hell of a dip!

I'm sure I will be back soon enough!  Service was very attentive and friendly and this place is pretty easy to get to.  The parking lot is a little confusing if you aren't paying attention, but if you can navigate that and get inside the door, great hot dogs and cheese fries are waiting for you!"}
{"text":"My buddy Dave G. recently wrote an updated review on Portillos.  There are like a gazillion transplants from Chicago out here in AZ, so they have 2 of them.  After reading his review, it made me realize that the last time I was there (Buena Park), I left a bit disappointed.  I wanted to go see a movie that was close by, so I decided to stop and get some lunch.  Redemption?  Yes!

I got there early at like 10:40am.  There were maybe 5 other people in the joint.  I walked up and placed my order for a Jumbo Dog with mustard, onions and relish, a Maxwell Street Polish, a Large Cheese Fries, and a Large Diet Coke.  My total was just under $12.00.  Not the cheapest lunch, but it was substantial and kept me full most of the day.  I paid the lady my money and then took a seat.  A few minutes later, they called my number and I picked up my order.  Here is how everything tasted...............

Jumbo Hot Dog-  Delicious!  I didn't go full Chicago style on this one.  I'm not the biggest fan of tons of toppings.  Mustard, onion and sometimes relish and I am a happy man.  This dog was great!  It was large, plump and beefy!  It was encased in a soft, steamed poppyseed bun and then topped with mustard, onions and plenty of neon green relish.  I really liked the dog and for the .34 cents more than a regular dog, it is well worth going with the jumbo.  Pretty much a must order every time here.

Maxwell Street Polish-  The last time I had this I was extremely disappointed.  The onions were too watery, the bun was soggy and the sausage didn't taste that great.  This time around it was better than last time, but not as good as it could have been. The caramelized onions they use are plentiful, but they destroy the bun.  They soften it up too fast.  The Polish sausage itself was a bit lacking too.  It wasn't that flavorful and had a weird texture.  They skimped on the mustard too.  I ate the whole thing and it wasn't \"bad\" per say, but give me a Teds Polish any day of the week over this thing.  I doubt I will order it again.  I would get 2 Jumbo Dogs instead.

Large Cheese Fries-  These are probably my favorite thing here!  Whatever it is, their cheese sauce is just fantastic.  Its piping hot, creamy and it sticks to the fries perfectly.  They use a crinkle cut fry here and they are fried and salted nicely.  A quick dunk in the molten cheese and you have yourself a winner.  Their fries are in the same pricing scheme as their dogs.  A small fry is only like .20 cents less than a large.  Why even get a small?  For .20, you get way more fries.

The cashier was friendly and the guy that gave me my food was cheery.  They still aren't my favorite hot dog in AZ (Teds holds a special place in my heart), but a jumbo dog and some cheese fries are a guaranteed winner!  This visit redeemed my faith in Portillos and I'm sure I will be back soon enough!   Thanks for planting the seed, Dave G ;-)"}
{"text":"Been coming here since I was a little kid back in Illinois and since moving to Arizona in 2006 we missed it a lot and looked very forward to having it out here with us however since they were sold it's not the same unfortunately the quality of the workers, the efficiency of expediting and the temperature and correct orders have definitely gone down.  Hopefully they will start to provide what the previous owners of 50+ years provided!!"}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time last week and it was a well organized experience. I got a salad and my husband got a hot dog and fries. Asked for them well done and sure enough...they were! Everything was tasty. Didn't have to wait long in line at all. The overall atmosphere reminds me of the Ed Debevics we used to have here. Worth a try."}
{"text":"I just went through the drive thru for a hot dog and onion rings.  Really loved the onion rings!  The hot dog was good,  but I prefer Five Guys.  I like the convenience of the drive thru. Seemed like a good place that I would try again."}
{"text":"I was craving a hot dog and onion rings, and Portillo's are very good.  
Their onion rings were very crispy with the kind of batter that I prefer.  Not sure what one would call it, but I know it when I have it.

I ate inside, and it was pretty loud.  I receommend the drive thru if you like things quiet.  Customer service was good.  I tried the chocolate cake, but it was not something that I would get again.  It was ok, nothing amazing in my opinion."}
{"text":"My husband and I are from the suburbs of Chicago and recently moved here from Washington. The food was on point. The beef tastes just like it is from home. The atmosphere is wonderful and it really hit the spot.  The cheese fries are the best...I highly suggest trying it! (and loving it)"}
{"text":"please open in pittsburgh. on a 4 day trip we stopped twice the hot dogs and chicago beef are the best and it is amazing how fast the food comes out being that busy. a must stop if you are near any of their locations"}
{"text":"Please invest in stronger paper bags,  or put 4 large hot dogs and a cheese fry in separate bags so that the weight doesn't rip the bag and the fries fall out in the parking lot."}
{"text":"Portillos is one of those amazing places with a huge menu with enough variety so that everyone in your party leaves full and happy. Went here this past weekend and was not disappointed. Staff was friendly, seating was open and ample, service was quick, and the food was spot on delicious. I ordered a couple Chicago dogs with some of the crispiest and best fries I've ever had. The flavor profile of the Chicago dog with the pickle, relish, pepper, mustard, tomato, can't be beat. I'm still thinking about it a couple days later. Next time I'm trying one of their famous Italian beef sandwiches. Although there are ample meal options for my vegetarian wife (pasta anyone?) she went with a salad. A SALAD? Yes, a salad. But this was not your average dinner salad--she ordered the chopped salad with romaine, iceberg, Ditalini pasta, Gorgonzola, green onion, red cabbage and house dressing. (Chicken and crispy bacon on the side). It came in a huge bowl and a side of bread and butter. She loved it. 

Full menu is also available through their quick and convenient drive through if you don't have time to stop in. Also, don't forget to sign up online for their birthday club for your free slice of chocolate cake."}
{"text":"Had their tuna burger which was a decent sized burger with thick slice of tuna. Some friends chose the place and it was good to try but I don't think I want to come back. It was..... Ok."}
{"text":"Portillo's has been on my list of places to go since it opened and glad I finally went last weekend. I never bothered to read reviews or visit the website and thought it was just a big hot dog joint. How excited can anyone ever get about a hot dog?

After reading some great reviews here, my wife and I made an early lunch run Sunday to try the Italian Beef sandwiches and were both very glad we did. She got hers with the spicy peppers and I went with the sweet peppers ($0.50 extra) and neither option disappointed! The peppers came with just the right amount of juice to soak the meat and roll.

The fries were crinkle cut, crispy and just the right amount of salt. The big plus was for an extra $0.50, you get a side of liquid cheese to dip them in if you're into that.  Onion rings were great too! 

There were a lot of other things on the menu I wanted to try but didn't have the room for, so we will definitely add Portillo's to our list of favorite places to eat at since its right down the street.

The only negative is that it's crowded and there is no self service soft drinks :("}
{"text":"As a Chicago native, I'm reviewing with that standard in mind. While not bad, this place does fall short a bit. My usual order (for years) has been a hotdog with no tomato and no pepper, a bowl of chili, and fries. 
Moving out to AZ, I was sad that I'd only get my Portillo's fix when I flew back to visit family. So when one opened in Scottsdale, I was all over it. 
I've been quite a few times at this point. 

Hot dog - pretty much as expected. Hasn't let me down. 
Chili - gross. I seriously don't know what happened, but it's thicker somehow and lacking something. I tested on my last trip to IL, and it hadn't changed there. It's just bad here. 
Fries - hard to mess up. My go-to side. 
Onion rings - gross. Super hard, oddly sweet, nothing special. 

I use to love the strawberry smoothie, but that's not served here. I did try the chocolate cake shake for the very first time a few days ago and was mightily impressed. I'd never had it before, so I can't compare to IL. While it falls short in a few things, my kids and I have made this our after-zoo spot. 

Question though...when on earth did the relish turn neon green? I'm certain it wasn't that color before...?"}
{"text":"I've been traveling to Chicago off and on for the last couple of years for work and while there I always try to hit Portillo's.  So imagine my surprise while I was in Phoenix this past weekend to discover a brand new Portillo's right there in Scottsdale.

It's pretty much the same experience I have when in Chicago.  The staff was friendly and efficient which on my visit was definitely nice since the place was so busy.  Seriously, I realize it's new but I was surprised at the draw this place had.  In any case, the staff made the crowd much less of an ordeal than it could have been due to their organization.  So kudos to the management for good planning.

As to the food...well I of course had a hot dog and ordered it through the garden which is basically what we'd call a Chicago dog outside of Chicago.  Hot dog and veggies!  It's healthier that way right?  My friend and I also split an Italian beef sandwich which we ordered hot and dipped.  If you've never had this culinary delight, it's like a roast beef sandwich with some hot peppers and then the whole thing is soaked in the juice from the meat.  You may have to use a fork to eat it but your taste buds won't care!  It was all very tasty. 

My friend who lives in Phoenix was sold and planned to go back again.  If i lived there, I'm certain I would be darkening Portillo's doors often too.  It's good food.   Really.  Go and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Yummy!! Trying the polish sausage today-- I usually get the chicken sandwich but today it's time for something new! Coworkers always get the Italian sausage and yummy French Fries and onion rings. I have to say that next time I come, I am committing to getting a milkshake!"}
{"text":"Go-to local place (as of now) when I'm craving a good hot dog. The staff is attentive, quick, and social while the place is kept clean. They get very busy around lunch, but not the worst wait time I've experience."}
{"text":"When Dick Portillo opened his first \"Dog House\" restaurant, I'm sure even he did not realize that his restaurants would become a Chicagoland institution.  

The Beef and Cheddar Croissant is the best item on the menu, hands down.  If ya ain't had it, then have it.  If ya don't like italian beef sandwiches, then go see a doctor and then have it!

And their Chicago dog is one of the best in Chi-town, so try it... you'll like it.

With multiple locations opening here in Phoenix, it sure helps me to get over my longing for food from my ol' home!  Sweet home, Chicago... er, Phoenix!  Yeah, babyyy!"}
{"text":"Best Chicago-style hot dog. Ever.  Period.  

I'm so glad they opened here in AZ.  You can't see it, but I have a huge smile on my face!

Worth noting, the beef and cheddar croissant is absolutely to die for.   Get it with sweet peppers if you really want to experience heavenly bliss!"}
{"text":"EVERYTHING is good at Portillos! The Chicago style dogs - GREAT! Burgers - GREAT! Italian Beef Sandwiches - GREAT! They also have a whole lot more to choose from. Prices are reasonable. 

UPDATE: went to portillos last night and went through the drive through. Although they were not that busy (it was 8pm) it took 20 minutes to get my food - REALLY PORTILLOS????? Minus 1 star!!!"}
{"text":"I really like Portillo's dogs and beef and tamales and even fries, but they must find a better way to package take out Chicago hot dogs.
By the time you get them home, they are soggy and squished and disappointing. 

Wrapping them in paper and throwing them in a bag with everything else just does not do them justice.  It works ok for Beef sandwiches which are juicy any way, but even they would be better if packaged to go better."}
{"text":"Every time my boyfriend and I swing by Tempe Marketplace, we always see Portillos around and we would often wonder how this place would taste. We had never heard of Portillos as we're not from the Chicago (nor have we even visited there).

However, it very much was how we both expected. It's a very casual place where friends and family can settle down and have some fast food after a day of shopping. It's a nice idea but it's sort of out of the way for us since my boyfriend and I always go towards the main marketplace to shop or browse around.

I ordered a hamburger while my boyfriend ordered a combo (a hot dog with an Italian sausage and some roast beef). We had initially thought the combo was going to come with some fries and a drink but only I got the fries, as it came with my meal apparently, and I had to order us a drink. It's not a big deal or anything! I guess he and I misunderstood this kind of lingo, haha.

The burger was okay; it's a step up from McDonalds but that's all I can really say about it. The fries were average, but both the burger and fries were at least fresh. The hot dog my boyfriend was surprisingly good - only because we've been burnt before with restaurants who try to mimic others only in looks and not taste.

If we're not really feeling the other restaurants in Tempe Marketplace, I believe we'd come here just to get more of those infamous hot dogs."}
{"text":"Went in after long day of traveling and was tired. I received my food and when I sat down I accidentally tipped my bag over and all my fries which are my favorite landed on the floor.  Bill the manager seen that I spilled my bag and immediately brought me new fries and swept up my mess. He was so kind and awesome!!  I love Portillos!!  Great Manager and great food."}
{"text":"Stopping in for a little lunch between soccer games. Great food, great people.  Then Hank walked in.  He started screaming about not changing his shorts for four days.  I recommend Portillo's.  I do not recommend Hank."}
{"text":"Going down hill. Not a good family place unless, you want to teach them what RUDE IS. What a terrble way to celibrate our countries fallen Memorial Day.  Service at the order counter and pickup counter was just terrible.  The young lady taking our orders was totally unhelpful. This was only the 2nd time my 12 year old and i have been here and were going to try something different, but did not because she was just too unknowledgeable or too lazy to help my son and nephew.  At least pretend to smile.  Then while waiting for our food i decided to get a cup of water while our milk shakes were being made. The older lady looked at me and said just grab that one on that tray. No big deal. Then my twelve Year old wanted one too.  So i go back to same older lady and ask and she looks at me sternly and then with an eye roll says \"ANOTHER ONE!?!?\"  My 12 year old didn't even want to ask for a refill \"i dont want to ask the mean lady.\" 
Ok, Now our order is ready and guess what, son's chocolate chocolate cake shake isn't even mixed enough to see the chocolate, and obviously doesnt want to talk to mean-lady.  So i take it over and  talk to different lady (surely she cant be mean too.wrong!). This lady claims that's how it looks and i yank out my receipt, since I'm obviously a lying customer and grabs it and just says \"I'll blend it somemore\" she hands it back and hurriedly walks off!  No sorry or anything.  By now all food from this place is gonna just taste awful no matter what.  EVERYONE I interacted with was RUDE. Except the gentlemen wiping the trays by the trash cans. 
I Can't go back to a place where my 12 year old felt BULLIED and UNWELCOMED.
Go anywhere else or, if you must, go to the Tempe location where the service manager knows what they are doing."}
{"text":"So with all the hype in Scottsdale -another Portillo's has opened in Tempe for us East Valley peeps!

All I can say is what a fun and sassy place it is! While we drove into the parking lot we saw some officers directing traffic which made it nice. Once we were parked, we were impressed with all the outside seating with misters.... Everyone knows it's HOT here!

When we walked in we were overwhelmed with all the people and quickly realized that we needed to get in line to order. While we stood there a man came up and asked us if we were ready to order, and I said no since I hadn't even had a chance to look at the menu :? So he quickly got us a menu and we decided and got in line to be greeted by a wonderful young lady who tool our order on a bag! Than we were handed our bag and headed to the line to check out. Less than 5 second wait and we stepped into the Pick up line.... Daughter went to the Salad line to get her Salad :)

Within approximately 4 minutes they called our random number for our food and off to the table we went!

We all dug into our food!  I had the Italian Beef (DIPPED!), with mozzarella and onions and a side of onion rings. Hubby had the Hot dog with mustard, yellow onion, and pickle, along with a Combo Beef and Char-Grilled Sausage and a side of fries. DD got the Garden salad, and DS got Chicken Tenders and Fries....

I enjoyed mine a lot! Very flavorful. I do think the onion rings might need a different type of batter, just not the way I like them.
 Hubby loved his completely! I think the fries could have been cooked or browned a little more - Personal preference....
DD loved her salad, very fresh!
DS did not care for his chicken fingers :(  Next time I asked him to try something else :)

Over all I think this is a great addition to the area. I had the opportunity to talk to Sharon (owner) and saw Dick Portillo walking and mingling with guests. You can see they are taking a lot of pride int heir new establishment and I can't wait to come back to Portillo's!"}
{"text":"Love this place!so happy they have one close to home. Burgers,chicken sandwich, hot dog or beef you u Can't go wrong. Everything is delicious, the cake shake is amazing if you like chocolate"}
{"text":"Worth the trip! We had the burger, hot dogs, polish dogs, Italian sub, fries, onion rings and fruit bowl. The only thing is the Italian sub didn't have a lot of flavor and wish we would have just got another polish dog instead. Friendly staff too."}
{"text":"Been coming to portillos for awhile but the one in scottsdale. Was in tempe and was craving a chocolate cake shake and some good food  

What happened to this place? Hot dog was tasteless even with every topping possible on it. I always get a chocolate cake shake - lightly mixed at the scottsdale location and in chicago. I asked for that and got the blank stare. Had to explain what it was to the worker (fml).  Got it and of course, was completely blended like normal. Went up to the front and asked them to redo it, very nicely. Got a rude manager basically looking down on me about it and got a terrible replacement. Didnt eat anything and threw it away and walked.

Never coming back here"}
{"text":"I think this is the best hot dog I've ever had.  Deliciously grilled with onions, it was just very juicy and tasty.  Fries are good too.  Krinkle cut.  This place gets BUSY so be prepared to deal with crowds.  I came on a Monday and it was PACKED."}
{"text":"After leaving an event that didn't fill me up tonight, the BF and I went to Portillo's since we hadn't tried it yet and were right there! Well.....the food was better than the place we left, but it was nothing special. I had a hot dog and was disappointed that they didn't use Vienna beef and that they did not have neon green relish....those two things are what make a Chicago style hotdog in my book. The BF enjoyed his cheeseburger, I thought it was pretty par as far as cheap cheeseburgers go. I definitely would not drive all the way out here to eat again, but I wouldn't refuse to eat here either, so I suppose it is ok."}
{"text":"One of my favorite salads can be found at this unexpected fast food haven.  I LOVE the Chopped Salad.  They have lots of great salad choices!  An unexpected find at a hot dog joint.  There is tons of crunch factor- and a yummy Italian dressing that is addictive.  I found the recipe online and enjoy it at home."}
{"text":"Never been here before today, I have to say it was a bit confusing at first and really really loud. I could t hardly hear the cashier.  The food was delicious!! The wait for our food  was about 15 minutes because we came here at noon on a Saturday (I'm sure that has something to do with it)."}
{"text":"This is the best place to get a Chicago style hot dog!! The facility is always busy but the employees are always friendly. The food quality is fresh and delicious.  The establishment is clean and they at always busy cleaning up after people. 
They have a variety of great items on the menu, so there is something for everyone."}
{"text":"We live in Surprise and it's a poke to get there so we called roughly around 10:25 p.m. on our way there and were told that online/phone ordering stops at 10:30. Order had a full rack of ribs in it so the point of calling was to have them started since they take a while to cook. Person that answered said no, she wouldn't take order, asked for mgr. and he said o.k. Great! Got there and completed/ordered the rest of our order. Arrived home and the ribs were BURNT. I have pictures. What's ridiculous is the cost of said ribs and the fact that we called ahead so as to not be the people that come in 10 minutes to close and order something that takes a while to cook.
Ribs were burnt and black, no extra bbq sauce given when it always is, and the cole slaw was half full. 
Doubt we will ever be back which is unfortunate since were life long fans of Portillos being from the Chicago area."}
{"text":"Italian beef dipped with hot peppers....amazing! I could almost eat it everyday. Got to have my fix at least once a week. Hot dogs are awesome too."}
{"text":"I have to laugh out loud that the first 3 bad reviews I read were all in regard to a salad. A SALAD. Who goes to Portillos Hotdogs for a stinkin salad? I don't know about their rabbit food, but if you're craving a greasy tasty burger, awesome chili dogs, perfectly cooked cheesy fries or loaded up big beef sandwiches, this is your place.
Super busy, loud, ample seating and a pretty efficient ordering system are all expected on each visit. The one time I had my order screwed up multiple times, they apologized profusely and gave me cake.  Chocolate cake. On the house. Really? How can you beat that. 
I can't judge their salads, then again, I'm not heading to Pita Jungle to try out their burgers, either."}
{"text":"All I can say is YUMMMMMYYY!!! A young lady, I think her name was Erica, came into my office and talked up this place to the point that I thought...\"Wow, they really must be paying this girl well to talk so highly of a fast food joint.\" But, I took her word for it and I came in on Thursday afternoon. 
I LOVE the Chicago 50's style decor! It reminds me of the places I went to as a kid in the Midwest. Everything was clean. And I even had employees picking up my tray and trash from my table for me!
The line was long, but moved surprisingly fast. There was a young man up front who I asked for advice on what to order. Even though the line was long, he was so sincere and sweet and suggest the Italian beef. He mentioned that it comes dipped in gravy, which didn't sound to my taste and he suggested having it on the side like a French Dip and adding sweet peppers. I took his suggestion... And I am SO GLAD I did. Seriously, why don't more people make Italian Beef sandwiches.
Needless to say, Erica was right. This place is special and I will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"My parents wedding cake was portillos chocolate cake!!! I'm from Chicago and nearly passed out with excitement when I found out a Portillos was being built in Arizona! When eating my
Chicago dog, dipped Italian beef or drinking my chocolate cake shake, it's like I'm back in Chicago. I went 4 days in a row and sometimes go twice in one day! I cannot get enough!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner before catching a movie. Would definitely recommend parking in front of Pier One or Cost Plus World Market if you go during peak times. Despite the place being packed, it was very efficient and we got our order taken and our food very quickly. The hot dogs here are great and the price is good for what you get. My husband ordered an Italian beef sandwich (I had to sample it too) which was very tender but the condensation from the meat causes the bread to get a little soft and mushy. It's for that and the occasional dirty table we spotted that I'm giving Portillo's a four."}
{"text":"I expected to pay a ton because I was thinking it was \"gourmet\" hot dogs, but their prices are reasonable.  Try the strawberry shortcake. It's a generous portion and tastes better than it looks.  The drive though is really convenient and the people working are pretty nice.  Food is better than average.  I didn't mark them down for anything because the experience was good."}
{"text":"Outstanding! As good as the Portillo's I visited in Chicago a couple of years ago. HUGE HUGE joint, lots of parking, tons of seating (inside and out), fast service, awesome food. Super-impressed with the speed of service at the height of the lunch rush. Many lines open and all moving quickly, and food came up quickly. I had a bacon cheeseburger & o-rings and they were both excellent. Next time I need to have a Chicago dog - one of the finest foods on the planet."}
{"text":"Nothing about this place appealed to me. There is a large crowd for sure but I cannot figure out why. Food lacks taste and character as does this location."}
{"text":"- Good hot dogs, but not substantially tastier than a Costco hot dog.  Substantially smaller though.
- We were asked whether we wanted our food \"to go\", to which we replied \"no thank you\", but then were served our food in a paper bag.  So what is the point of the question, Portillos?
- We ordered 3 little hot dogs and a small fries, which took almost 15 minutes, partially because Portillos dropped the ball and forgot our bag on the back counter.  They had even started calling the numbers of orders which came after ours,  even though those orders were far larger!  
- Ask for water, and you are given water in a tiny plastic cup, which you can only refill by waiting in their hectic to-go line.
- Stand aside and WAIT, eat-in customers!  You are second-class, served only after any and all customers entering Portillos' busy drive-through are served FIRST."}
{"text":"Excellent!! Download the Portillos app and enter HOT DOG to save $5.00 off of your order of $20.00 or more. Highly recommended...love the app so easy to order! 

PORTILLOS NOW DELIVERS!!!! Ordered food yesterday and it was delivered earlier than expected. Great Uber Eats driver delivered it....appreciate the fact that Portillo's has delivery...even if the UberEATS app does not show Portillo's as an option. Food was HOT, and perfectly packed!! Everything we needed was included. My only suggestion? Please offer a way to tip the delivery person in the Portillo's app. Will DEFINITELY be ordering delivery again!! Thanks"}
{"text":"Here now for my first visit. Pretty busy for a Saturday @2pm. Cashier was not friendly, actually didnt say a word except for my total. Atmosphere is fun, employees did not look happy. Tables were too close together. I had the Italian beef w/extra gravy. It was what I expected, nothing outstanding.  I also got a Maxwell street polish which was not very good. It was super salty and didn't have much flavor aside from the char broil. It was loaded with well sauteed onions and some mustard.
I'd go back if some out of towners want to try but I won't go out of my way."}
{"text":"Went to Portillo's today for lunch in Tempe AZ.  It was busy.  The food was good.  Typical Chicago.  It reminded me of the Portillo's in Elk Grove Village, not far from where I used to work.  I ate a beef and cheese croissant.  My wife had the roasted vegetable foccacia."}
{"text":"Most of the food is good. Don't get the burgers. I understand the negative one star reviews. The service is confusing & slow. Will still go back."}
{"text":"Stoped by with my sister and had a great lunch! The burger  was delicious . The onion rings were so good and crispy. Can't wait to stop by win be family"}
{"text":"Portillos really knows how to keep customers happy by offering delicious hot dogs and fries, never cold or soggy, and served in record time. I love the chopped salad. Try it. Chocolate cake. Yummy! Why cook?"}
{"text":"Love this place!!

Best Italian Beefs on the planet!  Great place to bring your family.  It has a really fun feel, oldies, a little bit of Chicago in valley."}
{"text":"In my personal opinion, this place is horrible. Especially the value. There is not much on the menu that I have tried and liked. Onion rings are good, fries are usually soggy unless fresh. Italian Beef sandwiches are tasteless soggy and gross, chicken sandwiches are decent but I'd rather go to chick file across the street. Hot dogs are nothing special and a mess. Everything is way over priced, they nickel and dime you for just about everything. No meal deals, every item is separate. They throw your food around in a bag until it gets to the end and finally give you a crumpled up tattered bag for orders to go and dine in. You cannot get your own refill so you need to wait in a drink refill line until someone will finally notice \"oh! Do you need a refill?\"....cheapskates. Costumer service is usually a bunch of rude older people that don't give a crap... unfortunately I try I to stop by here every 2-3 months or so to see if it gets any better, but this is the last time. I'm done with this place."}
{"text":"THE BEST Italian beef! Gotta have it dipped, no other place comes close to being A real Chicago beef sandwich, and their drive thru system is so efficient and quick, even with a line of cars, you're in and out in no time - and I have never had my order mixed up - love this place!"}
{"text":"our friends suggested we all go there and we were amazed at the good food, the choices and the prices!  perfect for get-togethers, families w/ young kids or a variety of ages because of the good food and even the ability to share the large portions!
I love the grilled fish sandwich, our friends always get the beef and the cake shake."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and they serve the greatest fast foods.  I love their Italian beef, sausage and chili dogs. Their fries and onion rings are also great, not too greasy or dried out!   I just wish they offered more items for dessert! The atmosphere is really cool, and I found myself looking around at all the posters, and other decorations. 

No problems with finding a nice parking space either.  It's also got great outdoor tables (with misting)."}
{"text":"I never been to a hot dog joint like this before!!!  And it's so cheap too!!  I love what they include on these all-beef hotdogs.  I'm salivating just thinking about this."}
{"text":"They have the best Italian beef in town, and the combo sandwich (beef and sausage) is decadent but delicious.  This is a great place for catering, too."}
{"text":"Really fun atmosphere for a fast food counter service kind of place w/ a drive through.  Jumbo hot dogs are super yummy, service is always great, employees are courteous, etc.

The only thing I think sucks is that these super nice employees are forced to stand out in the AZ heat to take the drive through orders.  What happened to the old fashioned speaker systems.  I feel so sorry for them.  I think that is really stupid and sad.  They say it gets orders processed and out quicker, but I don't see how it could really make that much of a difference.  I wish they would change their policy on this.  They are out there even when it's not super busy for no apparent reason."}
{"text":"Food was okay, tasted like something from the store I could warm up in my microwave at home. What ruined the experience was the poor customer service. The girl that took our order seemed like she absolutely hated her job and when we asked her questions she would interrupt with a comment and an attitude of \"why are you asking me this\"."}
{"text":"Who cares if you overhear conversations from visiting Chicagoans or transplants?  Portillo's has a good concept and great bread to serve their beef on.  That's the focus, not the people you happen to meet eating in the business.
It's never a disappointment to order the original beef with hot giardiniera and a side of gravy.  This to be said about the Tempe location:  DELICIOUS.  
The beef, tasted like beef.  The bread chewed like good Italian bread.  The 'gravy' was a great foil to cut the hot giardiniera.  
Spent 3 days in the Phoenix area and had lot's of choices to eat a quick meal.  Glad I ate here than some pretentious dining establishment on this day."}
{"text":"The best Italian beef period.  It's a taste of home away from home."}
{"text":"love it, love it, love it.  Been going to Portillos for years in Chicago and now in Scottsdale.  The hot dogs are the best!!!  My husband really likes their burgers and fries.  My new menu favorite in the chicken and fruit poppyseed salad.  It's YUMMY!!!"}
{"text":"Love This place sooooo much!!!!! Best Italian Beefs!!! Me and my husband use this as a go to whenever we need a quick dinner! I could eat it every day!"}
{"text":"Good spot right in the neighborhood for hamburgers hot dogs cheesesteaks  and Italian beef  Plus other fast food. This is an efficiently run restaurant. Lots of employees to help you food comes out like you ordered fast and fresh."}
{"text":"All I can say is... If I die from clogged arteries tonight, I want my family to go after Portillos. Ordered some hotdogs (got them char grilled... Took 20 minutes longer, after we were told it would be 10 extra minutes, than a Normal cook would have been) but I think it make them better, raising them to an \"ehh\" level. Also got the Italian beef, regular gravy. Now my idea of gravy is, well, something brown and maybe beefy tasting or like an Au jus type sauce. This sandwich was pure grease. My husband and I tried to eat it, really wanted to like it, but couldn't do it... It was dripping in tasteless grease and made me feel nauseous. I don't get the rave reviews this place gets. Yuck."}
{"text":"First time eating here and it was okay. I ordered double burger with onion ring. Onion ring was tasteless and not worthy of ordering. I went and order French fries and it was delicious. 
burger was just average.

I like that it is big and has patio with heaters. Plus they have salad and dessert bars."}
{"text":"\"The noblest of all dogs is the hot-dog; it feeds the hand that bites it.\"  ? Lawrence J. Pete

Always a great place to grab a quick bite.  Located on the outer region of Tempe Marketplace, this place is great.  Lots of parking, ample seating, and fast!  Pay attention for your order number if you decide to grab a seat instead of waiting at the counter.

I like grabbing a Portillo's all-beef hot dog.  What's not to love about a Chicago-style dog?  It's no Superdawg but it's a super dog!  Mustard, Play-Doh green sweet relish, freshly-chopped onions, two slices of tomatoes, a kosher pickle, and sport peppers nestle up against a hot dog in a steamed poppy seed bun.  Mmm!  Don't even touch this beast with ketchup or I'll throw my shoe at you.  For $2.85, I usually have to refrain myself from getting two.  It's cheap but I like to get other items besides hot dogs.  The Beef-n-cheddar croissant with both hot and sweet peppers... oh man.  Need I say more?  The Char-grilled Maxwell Street Style Polish is pretty darn great as well.  It's an explosion of grilled onions, mustard, and a meaty sausage [That's what she said].  

All in all, it's a great place to grab a bite without breaking the wallet.  All that grease for such a low price.  ;)"}
{"text":"Having grown up in Chicago, I have very fond memories of Portillo's. Perhaps Portillo's changed since branching out or perhaps my memory distorts the truth. Going to Portillo's in Scottsdale was like watching the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles as an adult--I don't know what I ever saw in this.

To begin, I visited twice: once during peak hours and once in between the lunch and dinner rush. During peak hours, the wait was long, I was scolded for taking a picture inside, the order was incorrect, and the burgers were similar in quality to Wendy's. The second visit wasn't much better. I entered the drive through to see more attendants than cars and waited 15 minutes for a cheeseburger with only one car ahead of me. Upon arriving home, the fries were only half full, the soda was mostly ice, and the burger was a soggy mess of mayo and ketchup. I took three bites of the burger and tossed it in the trash.

The food doesn't live up to the hype or the price. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"The stars say it all!  Try it. You won't be disappointed. Get you italian beef dipped completely. You'll love it!  I did!"}
{"text":"People from Chicago love this place! I am not from Chicago. I've tried a few things here since the restaurant opened. The Italian beef, imo, wasn't worth all the hype or wait. Hot dog was tasty, but how can you screw up a hot dog other than putting ketchup on it! This restaurant should be ashamed of itself for allowing their canned disgusting tamales to be served here, especially in AZ. Too crowded. Too pricey. Plenty of better restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"I'm so incredibly irritated right now. I just had a long ass day at work and stopped by to grab a salad to take home. I ordered from the drive thru and asked for no tomatoes. I pulled up to pay and confirmed no tomatoes. Yep! I get to the pick up window and seriously confirm again because I really hate tomatoes. Guess what? You can imagine my disappointment. So I call and tell Rebecca, who answered the phone, that not only did my salad not come with a muffin as it said on the drive thru menu, but there were tomatoes on my damn salad. This is her response...\"well, we don't serve muffins anymore and I'll get someone on the phone about your salad\" all condescending and rude. I just hung up because I've already had a bad day and this chick is not gonna even make it worse. Mistakes happen, I get it but if you're going to have someone answer your phones, you should probably not have someone as snotty as Rebecca doing it."}
{"text":"This place is worth the drive wherever you are. I was blown away about how tasty it is. The place is really clean, you can tell it's ran like a fine tune machine your not home airing forever for your order. I'm going to be making frequent trips to try everything on the menu. Very highly recommended super good"}
{"text":"Definitely don't live up to the hype. I rate it average at best! Really nice establishment and the employee's are nice. There is always to many people and food is ok but don't blow your socks off. I really don't understand why people act like this is so great. I was disappointed all three times!"}
{"text":"We were on vacation and decided to stop in for a late night bite to eat......WOW! This place is super cool! And the food is incredible. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Interesting concept brought to the Scottsdale area.  Long outside line but moving fast w/order takers coming directly to your car.  I tried a variety of foods including the regular hot dog (good but the bun was cold). The french fries were lacking in temperature and salty - this is surprising considering the number of people in line. You might think that the fries would be fresh with so many people in line; perhaps they were not ordering the fries   The Italian Beef sandwich was also good but lacked in presentation w/a chunky pepper and a tough roll. The Chocolate Cake Shake was out of this world; reason for the 4 stars."}
{"text":"Gotta love Portillo's. I feel like the best time to go is when you're with a big group, you're looking to save money, and you want something tasty.

Hot dogs have lots of nice toppings, including little spicy peppers. The burger and Italian beef sandwiches are also really good. If you want something healthier, grab a salad. They're all pretty good and come with a yummy poppyseed muffin."}
{"text":"Portillo's brings the taste of Chicago to Phoenix. The restaurant itself is a bit chaotic - there's several lines, and no matter what time of day you go, it's busy. People huddle around the pick up counter, which can be irritating. On the upside, the food is cheap and tasty. I love the Portillo hot dog - the toppings are awesome and the chilis are hot! The burgers and salads are pretty good, too. The poppyseed muffin is delicious - so soft, sweet, and tasty.

Give Portillo's a try when you're on a budget and have some patience. Cheap + delicious = awesome."}
{"text":"I tried something new and I am SO glad I did. The Beef & Cheddar Croissant is the most delicious thing EVAR! I can't even. Nommmmm."}
{"text":"Phoenix, if you haven't tried Portillo's, you have no idea what you're missing.  This Chicago gem has the BEST Italian beef, sausage, burgers, top notch hot dogs, salads, pasta and ribs.   VERY REASONABLE price, fast service, no waitress service (so no 20% tip) and awesome food.  Did I say awesome food?   Priced almost too cheap, but top notch flavor and service."}
{"text":"If I was ever on Death Row and had to chose my final meal, it would be Portillo's Italian beef, dipped, with mozzarella and sweet peppers and a side order of cheese fries. Ah-may-zing. The taste of back home that my soul craves."}
{"text":"Having been to a Portillo's in Chicago a decade ago, I was looking forward to trying them out. The dÃ©cor inside instantly makes you feel like you're back in [insert worn out Chicago nickname here].  We got some classic Chicago dogs, an Italian beef with hot peppers & cheese (dipped), some fries, some rings and a piece of cake. The dogs were exactly like I remember and I want more right now just writing about them. I don't know, something about the soft poppy seed bun, beefy dog and that neon green relish along with the crunchy sport peppers just makes me instantly crave them. In hindsight, I should have skipped everything else and left more room for dogs. Maybe the Italian beef was awesome for people who have all the memories/nostalgia that goes with a dish like that, but as I've never had the real thing, it was wasted on me; it was just some soggy bread and bland beef. Again, I feel as though I may be dissing someone's religion here, so forgive my blasphemy - I know not what I ate."}
{"text":"Very disappointing...we were looking forward to an Italian Beef sandwich and got a poor facsimile.  While there was adequate amount of beef, there was no 'jus' and no Giardiniera (pickled vegetables) whatsoever, and only two small slices of pepper.  
The owners of this specific operation should visit a Portillo's in Chicago to learn how to make this properly.  Better yet, while in Chicago they should get one at Al's on Taylor street.
Even the version sold at Gold Coast in Midway airport are better than those offered at Portillo's in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Yikes. Seriously. I'm about to be really mean and honest, so if you are scared, stop now.
This was truly the worst hot dog we have ever had. They are supposedly good quality, but they were so undercooked and nasty, we could not tell. We had to send the french fries back because they were cold and soggy. The college blank stare brigade standing around at the pickup counter acted like they needed to find a teacher to figure out how to replace the fries. My husband said the relish was scary and he is not picky about hot dogs...he eats them at gas stations and said they are 100 times better than Portillos. Go to Micky's and get a Sonoran Dog! We did."}
{"text":"Ordered the Italian Beef with Sweet peppers & Mozzarella dipped w\ fries. Awesome sandwich. I've been in Tucson for 20 years eating Italian Beef amongst other things at the several Luke's restaurants located there & Portillo's is every bit their equal. I will definitely visit them again when in the area!!! My daughter had the Mediterranean salad & also said it was awesome:)"}
{"text":"Not sure what's wrong with this place and why it's so difficult to get an order correct. Ordered  a burger and waited almost 20 minutes to get it whilst other people after me received their orders promptly. I actually had to approach the counter, ask for my order and was told they weren't sure what happened to it.  They eventually gave me my order and were to busy to apologize for the mix-up.  Last time I was there, they forgot the cheese on the cheese  burger!  Pathetic service and won't be returning."}
{"text":"Eh, pretty cool decor. Food was not very good. 
Kind of a cafeteria feel and taste. Mediocre at best. 
This place was close to our hotel and it had pretty good reviews. We all thought it was worth a try. We would not be back."}
{"text":"Never knew what a italian beef was until I married a Chicago girl! Now I absolutely love them. From what I know portillos is a Chicago icon, known for their italian beefs... Every time I go there I get the same thing big beef extra gaurdina with mozzarella cheese, large fry with dipping cheese! Something Chicagoans like is there italian beefs dipped in the juice, to me that's gross so I get the juice in the side. It's bomb chow and there is no place in the valley that makes them so good except for my wife at home... She can blow those out of the water. I know they sell tamales, let's be honest if your going to trust and try a tamale from a Chicago based restaurant be ready to be disappointed. They are squeezed out of a tube and look like something that should be thrown directly in the toilet."}
{"text":"Their beef sandwiches are wonderful, as anyone who has had them will know. 5 stars for those.Their hamburgers, however, are horrible. Probably the worst I've ever had, at least the one I ate, and the same end result as the one my daughter had. It tasted old, as in sitting for a long while. Also not fresh, as in tasting like a frozen burger, before cooking. Just not worth it. Stick with the beef sandwiches."}
{"text":"Very loud, and overwhelming environment.  Personally I found it rather stressful, I guess it depends on your tastes.  The food was reasonably priced and tasty.  A good place to take kids, since the noise would easily drown out any tantrums they might throw.  I guess that is a positive, right?"}
{"text":"Food is descent. Surprised by the salad options for a dog and sandwich establishment. The ordering process is a disaster. 5 points of sale with enough room for 3. This start your experience out very poorly and with mediocre food, the place is  worth the trouble."}
{"text":"I am not from Chicago, and I have never been or heard of Portillo's until my boyfriend told me about them.  We made the ride out to Scottsdale because he was craving some crinkle cut cheese fries (which are fantastic!)  He had a beef sandwich which looked phenomenal, and I totally messed up and ordered a grilled chicken sandwich.  My sandwich was good, but a place called Portillo's Hot Dogs, and I get a chicken sandwich?? I can't wait to go back so I can try a hot dog, and do it right.  However, I did get the cheese fries, only regret is that I didn't get a bigger size ;) Service is good, atmosphere is fun, and I love the 50's music they play! The restaurant is absolutely HUGE, and I can't wait to visit the new Tempe location."}
{"text":"Well the digs are spiffier and shinier than in Chicago but new duds don't make you the bell of the beef. I was really hoping for some hometown Chicago style beef and I got a tamer version. The bun was was like that soft crusty goodness I was looking for but the beef? Cmon guys, the beef! I'm not disappointed, I'm just not the happiest."}
{"text":"I mean what can I really say about Portillo's that hasn't already been said a million times over?!?! If you are looking for greasy, cheesy, grilled, salty GOODNESS...then Portillo's is the place for you! This is my ultimate cheat meal destination!!! I always get the Bacon Burger, Chili Cheese Fries, and the Chocolate Cake Shake...I can never finish it all...but I am NEVER disappointed!"}
{"text":"If you have a craving for  a Chicago dog this is your place! Fast and delicious. Almost reminds me of the Portillo's in Chicago just way cleaner and new haha!"}
{"text":"The hot dog was good but, really? What's all the hub-bub? I was still hungry when I finished it so that's not a good sign right there. I ordered a chili dog with mustard, ketchup and cheese and onion rings. The onion rings were too breaded and too crispy (yes, there is such a thing as too crispy). 

The place is a bit confusing to figure out when you walk in -- need more signage. I'm sure I'll come back here to give them another shot, but I don't see what the big deal is...yet."}
{"text":"We're here at Portillo's now. The food is good quality. My family is enjoying their food - double cheeseburger, chicken sandwich, hot dog, French fries. I ordered the beef and cheddar croissant. It is disgusting. The menu description says it is served on a toasted croissant, but what I got was a sandwich so wet and slimy I couldn't pick it up. It was so wet it resembled uncooked dough. It was inedible. The beef was good, but under seasoned. My husband went to the counter to ask for a new roll. They charged him $.75 for it. I scraped all the pasty, slimy bread off the beef and transferred it to the new roll. That was much better, but now cold. I would never order that again. The first pic is of the wet slimy bread, and the second is with the new roll."}
{"text":"Ok so maybe I dont get why they had 4 attendants ( people) threw the drive threw area one asking order, even when they had a drive up menu / with speaker box  and there where 2 of those, one handling money -- even this freaks me out a bit espic hoping the right change is handled properly, and 4 was at drive threw window. TO me that seems like a wasted staff amount probably could be used inside rather then outside. Took about 7 mins for order big meat - Italian Beef sand. The meat and auju was great bread was lacking it. The onion rings could tell they where fresh however a little bland we where in drive threw and not presented our drink while waiting for our food. I dont mind waiting espic if I have a drink to chill out too but to me that was interesting. I do not understand concept of having to stop and talk to people I would rather pull too the menu board and order that way. If there triing to be like sonic ? It was a friday however I still do not understand why so many steps and still left a little confused. I rather run into chompies."}
{"text":"Stopped here on the way back from the lake. We were pleasantly surprised! Service was fast and the food was great!"}
{"text":"This is a great hot dog place. Excellent quality dogs grilled, not boiled. Sesame seed buns and all the Chicago fixings if you want. Chili cheese dogs very good too. Very unusual these days are malts and they have them, shakes too, but MALTS! This is a great casual place with very reasonable prices. Will definately be going back."}
{"text":"This is a happenin' place! I often feel rushed when I get in line to order because they have a person carrying a notepad or something taking our order as we stand in line, so I don't really get to peruse the menu to see what I want - an option is to get out of line to read the menu, but considering how busy it is, you need to stand in line, get your order and hope to get a table to sit at.  I'm not a HUGE hot dog fan, so I usually just order the \"hot dog\". It comes with everything including: mustard, relish, freshly chopped onions, sliced red ripe tomatoes, kosher pickle and sport peppers piled onto a perfectly steamed poppy seed bun.  The best part is the poppy seed bun. So soft and warm!  They also have crinkle fries that are also really good.  I'd definitely keep coming back to this place as there are many other things on the menu that I want to try."}
{"text":"Starting with the food, it tastes great and I'll go back for it.  

That said, I usually order take-out from my car, and way too often they don't get the order right. Today, I ordered a large iced tea with the pink equal, I got neither equal nor a straw. I ordered mustard on my Maxwell Street Polish, missing!

On other occasions, I've ordered the burger with mustard, ketchup, pickle, onion only and gotten lettuce, tomato and mayo, or no onion, or no pickle.

If this kind of sloppy service didn't happen about every other time I go there, I would give them 4 stars.

Come on Portillo's, get your act together!"}
{"text":"Everyone (from Chicago at least) tells me I need to go here.  So I went here.  It was alright.  I'd go back to try it again as when I went, the line was nearly out the door and it was very crowded.  The atmosphere seemed cool enough, but perhaps I am missing something given the hype.  I may be back but I hope I can be impressed the next time!"}
{"text":"Been there for lunch a bunch of times , food is always good , at lunch time they get busy but never had to wait to long for food ."}
{"text":"Portillo's at Tempe Marketplace has all the nostalgia of visiting Portillo's in Chicagoland.  It looks the same, the employees are trained the same, the food is the same.

If you are a fan of Portillo's, this Portillo's is no different.

The things that I don't like about this Portillo's mostly stem from its location.  

The parking situation is really bad.  You have to enter from a side street or make a quick right after the intersection at McClintock and Rio Salado.  I have seen so many near-miss accidents in this parking lot.  I have also almost been hit when walking from my car into the restaurant when walking past the drive thru, even while on the path.  

If you happen to miss the entrance into Portillo's, you would have to brave the Tempe Marketplace parking lot and then walk between buildings to get back into Portillo's lot.  

I recommend the italian beef with hot giardiniera, the beef and cheddar croissant and the onion rings.  My mom recommends the chopped salad.  

I do not recommend the chicken anything here.  The chicken tenders are always dry and the chicken sandwich is boring.

The fries are decent, but the cheese fries have a cup of \"nacho cheese\" to dip them in.  I would prefer melted cheese on my fries to that disgusting stuff.  

I have been to this Portillo's several times.  I will return."}
{"text":"Having lived in Chicagoland for 6 1/2 years, I know Portillo's very well.  Portillo's was never my favorite place to eat Italian Beef living there, but my family really liked it so we went quite a bit.

Now that Portillo's is in Scottsdale (and is coming to Tempe), it might be just about the best Italian Beef in town.  I like their hot giardiniera on a full sized sandwich made dry.  If you know italian beef, you know that even your dry sandwich is going to be soggy.  Ask for it wet and the thing practically falls apart.

I do miss my local italian beef spot that had better choices for bread.  I also miss being able to buy italian beef frozen at Costco in Naperville, IL.  However, living in AZ and not having to withstand the Chicago Winter... I will take Portillo's! 

This location is great when there is no rush (think midday).  I have eaten here 4 times and my order has always been correct... even when we placed two to go orders and had a party of six.  

If you're ordering chicken... you're doing it wrong.  If you want a \"lighter choice,\" get the chopped salad.  Everyone I know thinks it is AMAZING.  Of course, I don't eat pork but... get it!"}
{"text":"Okay, I'm from Chicago I love Portillo's. Had it here in Scottsdale only so-so. The strawberry shortcake dessert was pretty bad all mushy. Chocolate cake was ok. They did not have the eclair cake they have in Chicago, which is my favorite.
The rest of food only okay.
Stick with the original fly back to Chicago."}
{"text":"Food came out quickly. 

Italian Beef was very good, the Sausage Sandwich was very generous and had to get a Hot Dog to split and try a piece of each. Tried the Chocolate Cake Shake and fries which were all tasty. Will be back to try other items. One thing is when ordering, have all the items with everything the way it is suppose to be."}
{"text":"Opening week Friday probably not the best time to go, but had to go to Portillo's.  The line from the door outside must have been 50 ft which did not include from the door to the counter. So we went to the drive thru which took about 12 minutes thanks to the staff. Food came out quickly and lived up to the hype. Italian Beef was very good, the Sausage Sandwich was very generous and had to get a Hot Dog to split and try a piece of each. Tried the Chocolate Cake Shake and fries which were all tasty. Will be back to try other items. One thing is when ordering, have all the items with everything the way it is suppose to be."}
{"text":"This place ROCKED. Everything was absolutely delicious. The loaded hot dogs were so good and the homemade relish was really good too.  We also tried the chili dog and the chili was just meh. Awesome cake shakes too!"}
{"text":"Polish dog was delicious. So many onions and the mustard was great. I don't usually like mustard. The chocolate cake shake was so big! Even for the small size! We got the cheese fries and it was literally easy cheese in a cup with fries on the side. Not what I would typically call cheese fries. The relish was an unnatural green but the regular hot dog was also delicious."}
{"text":"We came by here to get a quick bite. I ordered a chili dog with a soda and a strawberry short cake for dessert. The chili dog tasted ok, but the strawberry short cake was very disappointing. Service, however, was awesome. They came over checking up on us several times during our meal. Unfortunately, I probably will not come back here again."}
{"text":"I read some slightly negative reviews by people and they are mostly along the lines of....\"My friends from Chicago said this was the best place in the history of restaurants, I tried it and it wasn't THAT great\" If that's your mindset you might be disappointed. I loved going here in Chicago and love it here. 
Do you want a really good shake? They got it. How about a great beef sandwich or sausage or even better, a combo. They got it. A nice GRILLED burger on a good bun ( what I usually get ) They got it. Fries a really good. Nothing worse then a place that can't do good fries. That means you In & Out. Chicken sandwich got it. Hot dog, got it. Their Salads are all really good. If that's what your looking for, and your not expecting a fine dining experience that will blow you away from a burger place, you'll be glad you went."}
{"text":"I FINALLY made it in to the ever popular Portillo's.  I wanted to go for the opening night UYE, but it was just too cold for my thin blood.  So, I waited to go here for a Yelper luncheon.  I met up with  Mike C., Georgie M, Rand H and Marvin A.  Only girl in the group and that was fine by me!  

What an amazingly delicious place.  I left there thinking, I understand the excitement.  What's baffling to me is how a place so big can do, at least, one thing so well.  This was my first time taking a \"dip\" in the Portillo's family of restaurants.  I've been to Chicago plenty, lived in the burbs for a short while, but never heard of Portillo's.  No matter, what I lacked in hearing, I made up for in tasting yesterday.  

Oh yeah... this place has been open about 3 or 4 weeks now and the crowd has yet to die down.  I highly doubt that the crowd will.  At any rate, I get there just before 11am and you can tell by noon the place would be packed.  There was a very short line that I hop in to place my order.  I checked out the menu before I arrive and then I wrote down my order so when it was time to order, I just read off my little piece of paper.  But, to be honest, I don't know where their menu is displayed.  I did try to take a last minute peek to see if I wanted to change my order, but I remember thinking, \" I don't see the menu, just stick to the script.\"  I pay and then I wait for my number to be called.  The place is REALLY REALLY LOUD, so you definitely need to pay attention for you number to be called.  

I ordered the half sausage/half beef sandwich - Dipped baby Dipped and with hot and sweet pepper and mozzarella cheese!  What a simply delicious sandwich.  I RARELY eat bread, but I wanted to devour the bread.  the bread was firm, yet soft.  It has a subtle hint of Italian spices that you can definitely taste.  I highly recommend adding the mozzarella cheese for that reason.  I wish I had my sandwich DOUBLE DIPPED!  or more gravy on the side!   I didn't enjoy the sausage, and I would never order that again.

I also ordered the fries.  This is where I kinda got irritated.  YOu can't order a salad for less than 5 dollars there.  I wanted a simple side salad with my sandwich.  I need a reasonable option to make up for the calorie bomb!  But they don't offer a small salad, so I ordered the fries.  Definitely some of the best tasting fries I've had in quite sometime.  The perfect amount of salt with a crisp exterior while hiding the soft warm middle.  

I will definitely go back.  I hope sooner than later."}
{"text":"A few years ago I visited the Portillo's in Chicago.  We stayed at the hotel next door and I can't say that I was excited about trying Italian Beef for the first time.  I left that experience blown away.  I went back one more time before I left Chicago and prayed I would get a chance to partake in the Italian Beef again.  

When Portillo's landed in Tempe, I didn't expect the food to compare to the Chicago locale.  I was wrong again.  It's as if Chicago came to Tempe.  The Italian Beef is unbelievable.  I recommend upping the ante and getting the Big Beef.  The crinkle fries are good, but the breaded onion rings are phenomenal.   I also really like the hot dog and polish sausage.  And don't forget the chili with onions.  It's damn good chili.

It's rare to see Portillo's empty, but even when there's a line inside or out, they manage to miraculously get your order to you in about 5 minutes.  

**Tip 1**
If you don't like your Big Beef soggy, ask for the gravy on the side.  And there's no harm in adding hot peppers to your sandwich either!

**Tip 2**
Portillo's doesn't serve beer, so flask it or stop by BevMo during one of their weekend tasting sessions for a little pre-party action."}
{"text":"Really good concept. You know what you are getting. Greasy, tasty, fast and decent price. Like the layout and ambiance.

This is not high end gourmet food but for tasty and filling beef, dipped sandwiches, its hard to beat."}
{"text":"Had lunch there today with The Man. We tried the Italian beef- it was ok, a little dry at some parts and not enough peppers, hot dog -it was good but nothing really stood out about it , and the chili dog - chili was cold.  We don't live close to this location so we won't go out of our way to come back but would give them another shot if we were in the area."}
{"text":"So I was spending some time at a local watering hole on a Monday Night with Gorilla Joe, and after being harassed by a drunken buffoon, we ran into a strapping young lad by the name of James (Jimmy) Darmody. 

Jimmy was/is a Marine, and after his service he is now going to school and working part time at Portillo's. He invited me by the shop, and I since I worked in North Scottsdale, I was more than willing to oblige.

It took him a moment to remember seeing me from the night before, but  after a moment It clicked. He recommended that I order the Italian Beef sandwich with peppers and mozzarella. Dipped in \"the gravy\". That shit was good.

I also got the crinkle fries. Standard salty french fries. Them shits was good. 

The place was a madhouse. infinity people everywhere. Food came out fast though. 

It was good. Was it great? No. Will I have to go back and try the famous Hot dogs? Maybe."}
{"text":"Way over rated.  I had the Beef N Cheddar croissant and a chocolate cake shake. My croissant was a gooey soggy mess and the meat didn't have much flavor. My Beef N Cheddar seemed to be lacking Cheddar as well!! Like nonexistent. The chocolate cake shake was not really anything I'd brag about. It was edible but after half,  I tossed it. Won't be back."}
