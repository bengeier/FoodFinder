{"text":"This is the go-to place for lunch for a few folks in the office and I. 
The lunch offerings are typically Korean (bibimbap, various jjigae, and some bulgogee sets) and the prices are right. 
While my fellow diners, all go for the Bibimbap, I prefer either the Pork Bone Soup or the Yuk Gae Jjang for my lunch. 

It isn't the prettiest place on the street, but it delivers where it counts most (the food). 

The one factor that they could improve upon is the ban chan refills. Typically, we reach hungry and banchan are served fast. By the time food comes (not a very long wait at all) the ban chan has usually been devoured, but refills are never given unless yo flag them down and ask for it. 

But I would still go here than anyother of the die cut franchises on Yonge."}
{"text":"I really don't understand why Toronto businesses just don't have adequate parking available or free parking.  Well, this one has a few free parking spots out back after 6 PM, but it is still difficult to find a spot.  Either way, I have come to expect this for Toronto.

This little restaurant has really friendly staff.  They are always smiling and willing to serve.  The restaurant itself looks like a little old, hole in the wall type of mom and pop restaurant, but it was definitely good enough for all my needs.

We ordered the all you can eat bbq buffet.  They also had Udon and other noodle dishes as well as a la carte meat dishes for grilling.  On to the BBQ, we had bulgogi (marinated beef), kalbi (beef ribs), marinated chicken, and pork stomach (bacon).  The servings included a bowl of rice plus all the usual condiments you would expect from a Korean restaurant, including the fried Korean pancakes.

Overall, I would say the food is quite satisfying.  The bulgogi was quite tasteful, and the kalbi is the usual fare.  The bacon... well... it's bacon, so not much more to say about it.  The chicken was a little mediocre.

This restaurant was not the best I ever had, but not the worse either.  It was satisfying, and I would return someday."}
{"text":"My Wife and my son and I were looking for a place uptown (north york) to have Korean BBQ. We saw on Yelp that this restaurant was close by so we decided to give it a shot. 

Disappointing is all I can say.

The kalbi ribs were very chewy and the chicken had a funky after taste.

I`ve made better ribs at home on the BBQ buying them at Costco and the marinate from Korean grocery stores. 

The part that is shocks me the most is that genuine Koreans run this place. 

The Korean Grill House run by Chinese has better food.

To add insult to injury, Children age 4-10 are charged around $15.

My Son is 4 so anyone with a 4 year old knows they don`t eat that much and there is a huge disparity between how much a 4 year old can eat and a 10 year old.

Needless to say we won`t be returning.

The only good thing was the people were nice."}
{"text":"This is the first Korean restaurant around this area where they smiled at my brother and I when we walked in.  A lot of Korean restaurants around Yonge and Finch are very good in terms of food but a bit snobby in terms of service.  It's almost as if they sense that we are not Korean.  This place was different!  Service was friendly and quick.  The food was very good.  Price is reasonable.  However, their miso soup was a bit too salty.  Definitely a place I would come back to."}
{"text":"The food is not bad..but two major issues here.
I have never seen a dirtier washroom in a Toronto establishment in my life. Run down ..dirty.
Stinginess..the owners give you one napkin..if you ask for more they act as though your asking for the moon."}
{"text":"Nothing wrong with this place really.  Went here for a quick dinner before a party.  The price was pretty high considering I ordered a basic meal however. There were a few TVs with some swimming koi which was nice. The trim on my particular table was coming off and kinda stabbed me in the hand, so perhaps some remodeling is in order.  The service was not exceptional, but better than I was expecting for a Korean joint.  They actually smiled when taking my order and as I was leaving.  The portion was a bit small for the amount of money I paid, and easily had what would be considered a second dinner at the party I attended afterwards.  Overall it was good, and maybe other items on the menu would have been a better value.  As I said before, what I ordered was very basic and ended up costing me +$10.  In fact the description was \"beef something or other\" and I could not tell if there was any beef in the dish.  That, and the rice was extremely greasy."}
{"text":"really bad service and the food wasn't that great. The owner also asked for her tip without us leaving her a tip on our own. Horrible experience. 

  ..."}
{"text":"I have a love and hate for AYCE . Mostly since I become a glutton and eat till my clothes don't fit. However once in a while you need an excuse to buy fat pants. After going to the generic Chako and Korean grill houses. I was in the mood for something new.

 BULGOGI house may not have as large of selection of meats (only 6) however they are all distinct and have lots of flavor and marinated well. It was a pleasant change!. 

The first server had some serious language barriers. There was a previous comment about the quality of the sticky rice; yes it was a little dry and chewy. However the quality of meat was really high and that was the reason we go to these in the first place."}
{"text":"The uptown K-town has no shortage of Korean restaurants, and plenty of them in this area are good. 

If you're in the mood for the meat sweats, the all you can eat menu here is a good choice (and the only thing I've tried the two times I've been). They have a regular menu as well, but I've only tried the all you can eat menu here (twice) so that's all I'm going to review.

For about $28 after tip and taxes on a Friday, you get mounds and mounds of Kalbi ribs, bulgogi beef, pork, and other variations of Korean meats. The quality of the meats is good, and I would say better compared to other Korean BBQ's that I have tried in Toronto.  

The Kalbi Beef is well marinated and you can't wait to dig in as you wait for it to grill up in front of you.  But all the meat is good, and if you and your friends are hungry, this will do the job.

For the weekend dinner, the meal also comes with some \"extras\" which are not all you can eat, last time I got a skewer of shrimp and scallops, and fried shrimp (torpedo style).

As typical for Korean restaurants, they serve a number of side dishes along with your meal, which you can ask to be refilled at any time. These are your typical kimchi, pickled radishes, etc. that you come to expect from any Korean establishment.  

The BBQs here are the typical gas burners, not the coal type which are so rare and hard to find in Toronto.

My biggest criticism with the all you can eat menu here is that you cannot order lettuce or other sides which are typically used to \"wrap\" the meat as part of the menu. Orders of lettuce will cost you extra.  This is a bit confusing to me, as the cost for lettuce is really, really cheap compared to the meat they're providing.

All in all though, I don't think there's anything distinctively special about this place, though if you want a large, unhealthy serving of meat (we all crave this once in a while) then it's a good choice."}
{"text":"It's Koreatown between Finch and Sheppard but there actually aren't very many AYCE BBQ places. The few places that do have AYCE BBQ only have it for pork belly or bulgogi. Bulgogee House is the only AYCE place in the area where you can order something other than pork belly or bulgogi. Of course, if you don't want AYCE, you can order many regular a la carte dishes like pork bone soup or bibimbap. 

We tried all the meats. We had 6 choices: pork belly, beef short ribs (kalbi), chicken, spicy pork, pork and bulgogi. 

Chingu on Hwy 7 is my benchmark for AYCE KBBQ and Bulgogee House comes up a little short. First of all, Chingu beats them on selection. Chingu lets you upgrade to their seafood selections. This place doesn't have that option. Secondly, I'm surprised there are no ssam (veggie wrap, usually lettuce). Lettuce is very low cost. They side dish selection was ok but not as extensive as Chingu's. Lastly, Chingu offers kimchi and tofu stews with AYCE. This place doesn't. 

Taste wise, they are both similar. I like the chicken here better than Chingu. But I like the beef ribs at Chingu more than here. The pork belly here has noticeably less fat than every other place I've tried. 

If you want KBBQ with more than just pork belly, this is the place to go, as you don't really have another choice in the area. I would come here again, simply because Chingu is a little far for me. At $22.99, the price is reasonable, but more expensive than Chingu. If I want just pork belly AYCE, I can go to Shin Chon or Pyung Won House."}
{"text":"Went to this place on a weekday night. 

Overall This place has a quality in the meat in comparison to places like Chako or Korean Grill house. the quality of meat is higher and closer to al la cart Korean BBQ places. However there is a big difference when it comes to this place and Chako. This restaurant since it is Korean owned and run unlike the other two, its style is much closer to that of Korean restaurants, and for those who've had it, will know the difference in korean bbq styles. the one thing bad at this place is although it is all you can eat, it does not provide lettuce with it, and you have to pay $2 extra for each plate of lettuce you want. which makes Chako more attractive to a lot of people. because Chako at a similar price points offer more variety. 

for this reason i think it depends what you want. this palce the meat is decent, but the variety is very litle it only has 6 different type of meats to order. however if you want an authentic korean experience for korean bbq. This is a place to go for those who want it and also want All you can eat.  the RIbs were good and a high point, as well as the spicy pork. The pork belly was so so, and the chicken although tender and good quality, does not mix well with the spicy sauce

The service was good considering that this place only has 1 server running around for all tables. although language is a bit of a barrier the server was nice and accommodating and you can tell she cares when suggesting you how to properly bbq the meat. 

This is definitely a place i would recommend to people who want authentic korean bbq but All you can eat."}
{"text":"This is going to be a short one because I think the other Yelp'ers have already written good reviews. I've been going to this place for a couple of years so I'm surprised that I haven't written a review yet.

This place is very reasonable for delicious Korean food. Service is excellent. There's free parking in the back, which is always a perk.

I recommend:
- kalbi
- dolsot bibimbap"}
{"text":"Decided to hit up a near by spot for lunch with co-workers. Saw the sign outside for their Gamjatang lunch special which was the deciding factor. Came in around 12:15 during the lunch rush with a full house. The immediate vibe from the waitresses was that they were busy as a mofo. Order the Gamjatang which is suppose to be \"soft potato soup\" ..... was not the case. The one potato was under cooked, hard as F and the rice was dry. I understand that it is the lunch rush but you would assume they would be prepared for it.. guess not. I'm not a picky eater so I still ate the whole thing :p. Thanks for the meal but won't be coming back though! Cheers."}
{"text":"A few friends and I had some tasty grub from this Korean eatery tonight. This was my first experience with this restaurant and this review is based on this take-out experience only. 

The special dish we ordered, which was also the most expensive for the night, was gampoongi which is fried pieces of breaded chicken in a sweet and sour sauce; kinda like Chinese sweet and sour pork in presentation. A good balance of sweet and sour and chicken was achieved, though the breading was just a tad on the hard side.

We also had soon tofu, pork bone soup and bulgogi. Soon tofu was flavourful and spicy just the way I like it. The pork bone soup had a gingery flavour to it, which was new to me, but not unpleasant. I love gnawing on the pork bone, and there was plenty of marrow and meat to enjoy. The bulgogi was nothing special, but decent.

With side dishes and rice rounding out the meal, we were very satisfied; the portions were generous but not overly so.

Some nice after-dinner wine and a few rounds of Dominion ended a very nice Friday night hanging out with friends."}
{"text":"Dropped in on a cold day (-30 C with windchill!) for a quick lunch date with mom and sis who works up the street.  I had been to this restaurant before but I guess it was just as ho hum back then and I must have felt that the visit didn't warrant a review.  This being my second ho hum experience at the same place, I believe this time BH deserve one.

Seeing as BH is located in the \"Koreatown North\", I'm surprised that they can survive serving the kind of food they do.  There seem to be tons of choices for Korean food around the area that I know for sure I won't be back here again.  After reading other reviews, I guess it's their AYCE that brings in lot of non-Korean patrons that fuels BH's survival.  Even when we were there for the weekday lunch, most of the patron's in the pretty packed restaurant were non-Koreans.  No matter.  

We ordered 2 seafood soontufus and 1 kimchi jjigae.  The standard 4 set banchan arrived with the meal and I liked that they served their barley tea warm and not scolding hot.  

The purple rice that each of our stews came with were cooked with not enough water and came off too chewy for my liking.  The banchans (spicy fish cake, kimchi, bean sprouts and seaweed salad) were unevenly seasoned, with the fish cake being too salty, kimchi (unfermented) on the bland side and both bean sprouts and the seaweed salad bordering tasteless.  

My kimchi stew was probably the most edible thing with chunks of pork belly swimming in a msg-laden broth.  My sister and my mom's soontufu didn't fare very well as you could smell the Ajinomoto before the server even placed them on the table.  

Indifferent service, below average food and paid parking....I'm pretty sure I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I come to here sometimes because it is across from my condo. The owner is okay. The meal is okay. The lunch special is very okay. Monday to Wednesday: LA Galbi box is 7.95! Sometimes you get Pork neck bone soup with 4 side dish and purple rice for $4.95 + tax. The deal is too good to be beat. The overal meal is not impressive but a cheap place to eat for lunch."}
{"text":"Good food. They gave nice fresh fruit in my lunch special. Some other specials they have are very cheap and good as well. Only reason why I didn't give it 5 star is because they had us sitting in a corner for a long time because they could not see us. Didn't know they had a button we could push to get service. Wish they told me ahead of time. 

Overall a very good Korean restaurant."}
