{"text":"To whom it may concern, 
     I ordered from here a few times when it was \"Big Guys\" .... \"get this, and get that\" people told me. First delivery was a little long, food was good! Second delivery was even longer and food was good!!! Third delivery was so long that I called three times and still cooked my own food and was sleeping by the time they showed up. I chalked that up as \"hey they are new and busy\". Last two times I ordered a hoagie, burnt! Pizza burnt(same order)!!! Last order I said \"wings crispy with ranch for both of my orders of wings!!!\" Also ordered curly fries with nacho cheese! Wings where cooked enough to eat but not crispy, fries where burnt though! Nacho cheese was the best warmed item, however received no ranch but was charged for it! Delivery driver was as nice as can be and one of the best guest related people I have seen! So other than the tea that came with our meal and the driver being friendly this place is garbage. They did say when I called them up about the ranch they would give me extra next time with no charge!!!! What does that mean I get double the ranch when I don't need it but when I do just rough it out ?"}
{"text":"I was craving pizza and thought I would give this place a try since it's right down the street. The pics people had posted caught my eye bc it looked like a lot of cheese, which I am a huge fan of. However, I was highly disappointed by the taste of this pizza. The crust was bland and I actually discarded it. There was just nothing special about it at all."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery one evening, as the sin of consuming most of a pizza seemed minor compared to other available crimes. Received the food in decent time (about a half hour, give or take a few minutes). It was hot and well-made. The crust was a little tough, but it was late and that happens. The sauce was good; not too tomato-y or overly sweet. The cheese wasn't the greatest, but was acceptable. The only complaint I had was that the overall pie was salty AF. I mean grab a beta blocker appetizer salty.

Consequentially, I would recommend this pizza for parties and beer drinking, but not for any type of high expectations. It simply is what is."}
{"text":"This place is delicious!  Generous portions, great prices, fast delivery!  Everything I have ordered is delicious!"}
{"text":"Yinz Guys Pizza is a pizza shop in Carrick locally owned and managed. After being treated unfairly by Bishops continued spiraling prices or Pizza Hut and Dominos cookie cutter offerings a family atmosphere where they know you by name not by your credit card numbers is a welcomed feeling. I have enjoyed everything from Yinz Guys especially the Italian calzone. The staff is courteous, clean cut, and the best of all local, they know you and your family and make your food with care. Good luck and continued success to Chuck and his staff"}
{"text":"They have amazing hoagies, calzones,  and huge pasta dinners. Salads are generous and huge with fresh ingredients. The staff and deliver drivers all know me and my husband from the neighborhood and stopping in for a slice or their great wedding soup. Glad to see there is nice pizza shop there after all these years. Good luck guys see you soon!"}
{"text":"My wife's bank card was charged twice.  She's tried for three days to get the charges reversed, only to be told \"the owner\" would have to do it.  The owner never calls back OR reverses the charges.  I've had to have charges debited back to my card before. The cashier just has to run it back through the machine.  It shouldn't be this complicated.  And the owner shouldn't care so little about his customers"}
{"text":"I  ordered wings and a slice of plain pizza for the first trial. There were pretty good. If you like lots of cheese on pizza go there. Cheese is hunging over the crust and undeneath just right amount of pizza sauce is hiding . They are not stingy with wing sauce either. 6 ps of wings and 1 slice of pizza make my perfect lunch. I did go back 2 days later."}
{"text":"This isn't a rating for the actual business as i didn't order or visit the establishment, but i did have the chance to try their chicken salad and it was pretty amazing! It isn't listed on the menu for some reason, but It came in a normal styrofoam container. Super full it had to be stapled shut and only $9! The salad had chicken tenders, croutons, tomatoes, shredded mozzarella (or provolone) and a few other things i could do without, green peppers, onion, olives, mushrooms. Oh!! And i can't forget the fries they were the best! Thick cut steak fries perfectly fried not soggy and not too hard. The ranch dressing was really good too, tasted a bit like eat n' park. I'll get a picture the next time we ate it a little too fast. Thats how you know you enjoyed your food! 


A little long for a review on a salad right? Trust me i've had many a bad chicken salad lol"}
{"text":"This place has the BEST Hawaiian pizza in the city!plus great dessert! I ordered a medium pizza and was the size of most places LARGE! Give them a try!"}
{"text":"I patronized Yinz Guys today, June 21. I have ordered food from here many times.  Today, I ordered food, got the total and asked about using coupons.  They told me the coupons are in the pennysaver,  and they did not know which ones were in there. I told them I would stop at the unimart and see if they had one. When I arrived,  I was told that they did not make my food because I did not communicate that I would actually want the order. I said, \"I called, ordered and got a total, said I would stop by unimart on the way, I'm not sure where the communication broke down. The manager came out and stated that I should have called back to let them know I wanted the order. I stated,\" if there was a question if I wanted the order why wasn't I asked or they call me on the phone number I provided at the beginning of the call\"? I was told that was my responsibility. The manager then acknowledged that I am the customer but the customer isn't always right. So very unprofessional,  very rude with no regard to keeping a patron."}
{"text":"Best delivery salad ever.  I ordered their Grilled Cajun Chicken Salad, no tomatoes or olives per request.  I asked them to keep the fries and chicken on the side so it wouldn't wilt the salad during delivery.  They nailed it.  

I also ordered a large plain pizza with extra sauce.  Their pie is a little doughy and chewy, but the crust is still crisp and light.  I think they use a coarse corn meal as opposed to flour on the bottom of the pie, which isn't bad.  Decent sauce and solid cheese coverage.  Would order again."}
{"text":"I have ordered from here twice.  The first time I got a chicken gyro and chicken nachos.  The gyro had no flavor and the nachos weren't that great either.  The chicken in the nachos reminded me of those Tyson chicken strips. They put the sour cream in a little cup but put the cheese sauce on top of the chips.  The whole top of it was lettuce I had to dig to find chips.  The pico de gallo was just huge chunks of tomatoes and onions.  I'd never order those again.

The second time I ordered I got the chicken sandwich combo and a slice of cheese pizza.  I said no mayo on the sandwich and there was mayo on it.  Luckily I saw it before I took a bite.  The sandwich was delicious.  They give you a nice portion of fries and cheese.  I will have to try their whole pizza sometime because the slice was delicious."}
{"text":"This place had excellent hot sausage hoagies. The staff is friendly and there's a nice sitting area outside while you wait. I would recommend stopping in to get your food even though they deliver. Not because the delivery is bad, it's because their phone line is always busy because the food is so good. I'm definitely going to try other items on the menu."}
