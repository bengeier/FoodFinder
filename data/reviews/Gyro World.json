{"text":"Best fries in westpark.the gyros are right on.fresh hot and sloppy goodness.two can feast for less than $20.and they are nice"}
{"text":"No frill gyro place. However, its hard to cough up 6 bucks for a gyro considering Franks Falafel House offers a gyro platter for nearly the same price that includes hummus, salad and rice. Decent quality but its just a gyro."}
{"text":"Love their gyro.  Not really somewhere to go sit down to eat, but on my list of regular take out food.  The gyros are substantial and priced well.   The staff is friendly as well!"}
{"text":"This place is great for after work or after the bar. The owner is extremely friendly and so is the rest of the staff. The portion size is ridiculous."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Great food, great prices, friendly staff.  Wish they offered a gyro omelet with home fries for late night eating, with all of the bars around, they would clean up.  Try the pyro gyro or the Rueben gyro, delicious!"}
{"text":"Stopped in again tonight and it was just as good as I remembered.  I was surprised to be the only one in the place.  The food and staff are really terrific.  I highly recommend this place.  Thanks again guys!  See you next time."}
{"text":"A friend told me about this place. I drove by twice a day to & from work & never stopped. Figured it was one of those come and go gyro places. I've eaten here a dozen times so far & it's a worth while gyro shop. The biggest gyro was HUGE,.I couldn't eat all the meat they put on it. Don't know how they were making money on it. Well it's not that large any more so I can eat it all. It's still a bargain for your money. This is the goto gyro shop around here now! I have not tried the fries,but my friend spoke well of them."}
{"text":"Friendly workers and generous portions. We haven't had a gyro yet that's disappointed us. Fries are good too!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and have gotten chicken gyros every time. The first I thought that it was the best thing I've ever eaten. A couple of times after that, they were just okay. Tonight, it was really good. So it's been hit and miss for me. I wish the food was hotter, but the staff has always been super nice, and I'll continue to frequent this place."}
{"text":"Everything was perfect! The one young man behind the counter was so nice and welcoming. The gyros were amazing! I was just so happy with the experience. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great food, sick video game lineup. Multicast has 60 games including all your favorites, I mean all of them! I'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"My friends went and loved it, so they brought me a gyro take-out. I got lipstick everywhere and tzatziki in my hair, but it was worth it! So good. I'll be back."}
{"text":"It's never open when I go!!  It's Saturday at 2:51 pm and doors locked.  Came on a Wed night around 6pm closed.   Kinda frustrating."}
{"text":"Okay, it's been almost a year since my first review and we've been pretty faithful to this place when we're back in this neighborhood.  We've noticed that their originally \"huge\" gyros, well....aren't, anymore.  At first I thought it was me, but my wife mentioned it the last time we were there.  They've definitely cut back on serving size.  Which is disappointing.  The prices weren't stellar to begin with but it was hard to complain, with the huge serving size.  Now that they're the same size as everyone else, the price starts to look a little less inviting."}
{"text":"Great food and extremely friendly staff!   Not to mention the portions were huge!  We will definitely be back for some more."}
{"text":"This has got to be one of the best gyros for the price in Cleveland.  Definitely quality and quantity go hand in hand here.  I've eaten here too many times to count, open late, and always friendly, even on slow nights.  They also have pretty darn good fries too.   A must try place if you like gyros."}
{"text":"I needed a quick meal when I was in this neighborhood and found the perfect spot, Gyro World.  I was in and out in just a few minutes; perfect timing for not fast-food, but also not sit-down dining.  Dennis and his son, Justin, made sure my first time was enjoyable, they recommended the Fajita Specialty Gyro with grilled onions, grilled peppers,  and cheese. There was no need for me to order fries, because it was abundantly filling.  I even used the $1 off coupon I found on their website!  Next time I'll order the lunch special, Traditional Gyro, home cut fries, and a fountain drink for $8.  Thanks, kpk"}
{"text":"These Gyros are so good they make me wanna Gyr-ate my hips and yell \"Gyro-nimo.\" Although I'm not sure why I would because that would be both weird and sexual. Then again, things that are both weird and sexual are usually right up my proverbial (and literal, if I'm lucky) alley.  What to get: Mini Gyro What else: Minime was a really crap character, to be honest, in retrospect But: Hindsight is always 20 20  How to improve: Hard to say, really. Not too much improving to be done. Maybe slightly fresher veggies, such as at Best Gyros out in East Cleveland. Maybe try out different Gyro meats and some authentic Athens Pork style Gyros? Also, because these are so cheap, they sometimes taste slightly more cheaply made. Best Gyros proves you can have perfect tasting Gyros at basement prices. Gyro World take note! The decor here is also rather dreary. But I don't care about such things. However, for other people who do, they might spruce it up a bit at some point. Really cool arcade machines though - throwback style - for the kids. Love that.  So I went looking for some salt and pepper in a big bucket. I was just fishing for condiments.  Now on with the compliments.  The service here is really lovely. They were a little tired the night of the World Series but who wasn't. A bad night for Cleveland. The Gyro they made for me was hot and delicious and I loved every bite. Easily one of the 20 best in the country.  How can you be one of the 20 best Gyros in North America, but not even the best Gyro in Cleveland? Gyro World - that's how. Their products are delicious, and easily the most satisfying Gyro in the West Burbs of the great city known as The Land. However, the East Burbs rival (Best Gyros) is probably even better.  Both are extraordinarily cheap (especially if you get a mini Gyro), and both will solve your Gyro craving forthwith henceforth hitherto, whatever that means. The young males working here (I know you like that, bro, and it's cool with me, I do too) are super friendly, and will gladly whip it out for you... I mean, whip one up for you... if you have 5 dollars or so to donate to their proverbial piggy bank.  In Cleveland it's all Chicago-style Gyros (this is, after all, like a smaller version of Chicago), which means they're the big lamb-and-beef spindles with the knives slicing the meat off them. Probably my favourite kind - not authentic to Greece but definitely authentic to Chi-town. Ironically, Cleveland has an argument to doing Chicago Gyros better than Chicago.  Other top Gyros in the country are Oakland Gyros in Milwaukee, Nick's in Atlanta, Gyro World (not related) in Queens, Yia Yia's in DC, Greek Gourmet or Gali's in Pitt, a place I haven't reviewed yet in Davenport, Ekko's and a few others in Houston, and if I'm forgetting anyone, I apologize. Here in Cleveland, Frank's in Ohio City does it well, too.  And if this was in Europe, it'd be Euro World. Whereas if you were only allowed to visit it once in your life, it'd be YOLO World. Thankfully you can keep coming here, over and over, and at these prices, you can get seriously rotund and portly off Gyros. Try it. Thank me later. Gyr welcome."}
{"text":"The gyros were pretty good. There is a good amount of meat and the sauce is good. I tried the spicy sauce and will probably stick with the standard. My wife and I did not care for the breaded mushrooms (they were missing flavor or some type of sauce). The sit in restaurant needs some TLC but based on the nature of the restaurant I did not penalize the rating (expect a dive). I do have to say that I prefer Steve's gyros in the Westside market but this is a good alternative when I don't feel like driving that far or is outside the strict hours of the Westside market. I will likely come back."}
{"text":"Great Gyro for the price. The Pyro Gyro is real good so is the regular. Just getting up the nerve to try the others. But it's a great place to just pick up something quick and go home. It's definitely on my list of places to grab something and go. Great addition to the area."}
{"text":"Best gyros ! Great portions and their fries are wonderful ! Employees very friendly and polite. We will be going back every chance we get. I've only had one gyro better and that was at the stand at Westside Market, but these are  close to a tie. Love them !"}
{"text":"Okay, but not that great. I'd rather drive a extra mile and get better quality and flavor elsewhere. Price point is average. Staff is friendly. The over all restaurant seems unfinished, almost like they were 10K short of completing the over all set up."}
{"text":"Gyros are filled to the brim so be prepared.     It's more of a fast food place with very reasonable pricing.  Service is excellent and very friendly.  One item that needs to be improved is the Tzatziki sauce.  It is a too thick with lack of flavor (garlic, dill or mint, cucumber) so it's unable to blend the spices of the entire gyro.  It would help to cut the salt content of the meat as well, making it a taste pleasing treat.  Have eaten gyros worldwide with many comparisons so business would triple with this one improvement.  It can make or break a great Gyro.  I'd give 3 stars for flavor.   5 stars for everything else."}
{"text":"Was waiting for this place to open. Found out I was slacking! They have been opened for about a month. I must admit I was skeptical about the inside at first but I found out after I ate...that doesn't mean anything.  I LOVE gyros so I ordered a traditional one to go. It was huge for the price ($5.95). Now for the most important part...it was fresh..huge and it taste delicious!  Will be returning and my favorite part they are opened late. I think 4am. You guys must go and try it out."}
{"text":"They have the best gyros, nice and big! Also awesome customer service very cool atmosphere"}
{"text":"Good fast food gyros, nice selection of fried sides (mozz sticks, onion rings, mushrooms, fries), great friendly service. Supersize your gyro if you're pretending you're on an episode of Man vs Food, very drunk or haven't eaten in awhile. It is monumental. I tried the chicken gyro, good, but the lamb on my boyfriend's gyro was better. Even w my help, food still won this round.  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I was so busy eating forgot to take an actual picture but snapchat has one.   I must say I usually don't crave gyros because of my last experience, but I was hungry and stop ok by!  The price was reasonable and the staff is so friendly!! The gyro was made perfectly! Portion size is amazing for my tummy!! I loved it. It was mouth watery to eat.  If your looking for something to eat in the area, I recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Great place for a gyro.  Priced right, open late night and very tasty!"}
{"text":"These guys are doing gyros right! Good value for the money and just awesome food. They are much better than Greek Village in Lakewood in my opinion. You can tell they haven't been here long and the inside is a bit bare but there is plenty of seating. They are open very late so this would be the perfect place to go after hitting the bars at Kamms Corner. I hope everyone tries this place so they stay for a long time!"}
{"text":"Inside needs work. Service is awfully slow but I can't knock them there's only one cook always working there! But the actual gyro is excellent and definitely worth the price."}
{"text":"Don't pay attention to what the place looks like inside...the gyro's are delicious! It was huge and very well cooked! The tomatoes were fresh and juicy and so was the meat! Definitely one of the best Gyro's I've had. You also can't beat the price."}
{"text":"Well since my last review I've ate here a couple more times and that Ziti sauce is much thicker then it was the first couple times I've eaten here . I went for a 245 am snack last night and it was excellent I had a regular gyro it seems the seasoning was better then previous visits . It was very tasty , I sat inside and ate staff go out of their way to help you with your order such as condiments and topping on gyros . Thanks gyro world you saved me from a hangover! Awesome Gyro!"}
{"text":"There's not much you need to impress me- delicious food will usually do it. Gyro World doesn't disappoint.   The menu is simple, but satisfying. I opted for a traditional gyro, because, well, when in Athens....  The gyro was large and delicious. Meat was tender and flavorful, but the sandwich wasn't too drippy. Ample toppings. I was disappointed to see that they don't make their own tzatziki sauce, but maybe that's normal.  Almost as impressive as the food, was the service. The gal working the counter was so friendly as was the young man preparing food. No, seriously nice.  At only $6 I was pleased with the value. Plenty of seating. I overheard another patron say 'this place is addicting'  I think she's right."}
{"text":"Great gyros that are really big. They even have spicy Tzashiki sauce if that's your thing. Good fries and started serving burgers. Plus open late on weekends. Great place to eat!"}
{"text":"Salt salt salt.  My gyro was very salty and dry. There is no reason for the gyro maker to keep dousing it with salt and other additives. Gyro meat should be in strips but this was chopped up like a chopped steak sandwich.    Not enough sauce.  Buy extra. Tomatoes were not very fresh.   A gyro is to be greasy and sloppy.  It's been hard to find a decent gyro shop in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I liked this place until the last visit. There was a group of teenagers that were so obnoxious they were driving away business-- including mine. The owner was there, and either didn't have the insight or the cajones to tell them to calm it down or leave. I couldn't tell if they were with family or not, but what happened to expecting reasonably decent behavior in public? I took my food and left, forever. No gyro is worth that. Not when there's Cafe Falafel and Aladdin's everywhere."}
{"text":"I really love coming here this is the place to come if your looking for a good gyro!!! And they have now started serving other things on the menu!"}
{"text":"Gyro World is great. I can't believe we've only been there twice since it opened last summer, as the food is excellent and very reasonably priced and the owner is an incredibly nice person. I've had the classic gyro twice and it's been fantastic. I do want to try the other types of gyros, though, as they sound delicious. The fresh cut fries are awesome as well. The portion sizes are very generous and I've never left hungry (and I eat a lot too!) Since my first visit, they added an arcade machine that has a wide variety of games from the 80s for a quarter per game, and the wait time flew by while I enjoyed some Dig Dug, Donkey Kong, Burgertime, and Frogger action. If you're in Kamm's Corners and looking for a great meal, head on over to Gyro World!"}
