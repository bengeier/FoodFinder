{"text":"Great Fish-n-Chips, steak sandwhich as good as well.  We went early evening on a Tuesday, first waitress we had was great, second one pretty much ignored us.

Worth the food, though."}
{"text":"The service was great especially for it being so packed. I was told they had the best happy hour, but was less than impressed. I also got the poutine, which was okay...not the best but not terrible. I didn't stay for long, but it seemed like a fun place to go with a bunch of people for expensive drinks."}
{"text":"Awful service, got order wrong and didn't offer to remake it or comp it on the bill. Food is less than mediocre at best. Do NOT come here if you want decent or even good service. Felt sick after leaving here. This place is a waste of money"}
{"text":"L'endroit est extrêmement bruyant (musique très forte). On a apprécié la musique Live en soirée cependant.

Le \"famous\" fish & chips était trop cuit ce qui le rendait un peu sec. Au niveau des desserts, l'apple pie a la mode était extra, mais la crème brûlée beaucoup, beaucoup, beaucoup trop sucrée."}
{"text":"Good restaurant.  Excellent wait staff.  Great selection of microbrews and the fish and chips is fantastic.

I really liked the relaxed vibe here.  It felt like you were hanging out in a well stocked living room watching the hockey game.  It is very easy to make friends with the table next to you here."}
{"text":"Nice service and decor but they can't make cocktails to save their lives. Order a beer instead..."}
{"text":"I didn't go to the other venues in this building but I did visit the Winnie's section. Winnie's is the upstairs bar portion.

It's quite nice. I was impressed with the interior because from the outside it doesn't look like much. However when you step inside you'll find not one, but five, elaborately closed-loop wooden bars (ie: think Cheers style) and you'll also find lots of table seating. There's even several slot machines in the back room.

Maybe I lucked out on a good night because the place was fairly empty and the atmosphere was very chill, with a mixture of young and old patrons. The bar staff was terrific and I had zero complaints with my drinks. 

I would return again but I would probably return on a weeknight again, because I can imagine this place getting really crowded on the weekends. After all, they don't have five bars for nothing."}
{"text":"I had a great time at this place.

The bartenders were awesome.  I was there for quite a while and had 2 different tenders.  Both were really cool, they knew how to keep yoyr drinks filled and were great conversationalists.

The happy hour was really good.  2 for 1 bottles and $2 off tap.  The food was amazing.  We got a cheese plate to start, it was huge.  It actually took us a few hours and many drinks to really want dinner.  I had the steak sandwich.  It was spectacular!  A large piece of steak with brie, lettice and tomato.

If you get into this area go!  It was a great spot.  It is the cozier upstairs of Winston Churchhill bar."}
{"text":"We stopped in here on Saturday night for a few drinks and a bite to eat. Unfortunately we only received one drink and never did see the waitress again so we were unable to order any food or more drinks.

When we attempted to pay, the hostess had to track down our server and then she (the server) actually had the nerve to chastise us for not trying harder to get her attention to place an order. I'm pretty sure that's not the definition of providing \"service\".

It's really too bad because the atmosphere was very fun, the drinks were tasty and the view was killer!

The lack of service and attitude really put a damper on our visit to this establishment."}
{"text":"We loved sitting on the terrace drinking martini's with the great views of classic Montreal architecture. Fun loving crowd, bar food is decent, atmosphere outside is top notch."}
{"text":"on se sent  trop entassées quand danse la - bas . je n'y retourne plus  pour cette raison . la musique  est vraiment brouillante . Seul point possitif  l'entré est  gratuite."}
{"text":"We were here on Sarurday night, live music coverband no entrance fee. Recommend it for a laid back sing along to Eric Clapton leyla kind of night. We had a nice time and everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were bored on a sunday afternoon so we decided to go terrasse hopping. We came to this place and I can't really complain. We were served instantly, the waitress was SUPER sweet, the food looked good (we didn't eat), the drinks were 2 for 1 and the sun was out. What more can I ask for?? Oh! Yea.. vodka! And they had it! And Sabrina was happy. The end."}
{"text":"Let me start this review by saying that I am a die hard Montreal Canadiens fan.  I was born and partially raised in Montreal, the greatest city in the world.

Winnie's is a place where I always go when I am visiting my birth city.  The space is large, which is perfect for the raving Habs fans who couldn't get tickets to the game.  Despite the space it feels cozy and warm.

I can't say I have gone through their menu extensively.  I stick to the Winnie burger and a few pints of Alexander Keiths.

Service is always excellent.  If you happen to be in Montreal stop in on a night when the habs are playing and join in the fun!"}
{"text":"Nice fun tradational bar with great service and plentiful space.  There are three bars and a big area to sit and have a meal.  Plenty of TV's to watch the game. About 7+ beers on tap and the prices are really good. 

Great place to hang out and I will be back next time I am in Montreal."}
