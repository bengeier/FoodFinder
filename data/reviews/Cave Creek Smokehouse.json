{"text":"Great low key joint! We tried it during Cave Creek Wicked on Halloween. Family friendly. Good service. Had potato skins and they were good but ask for condiments though. We played their Songo game (Bingo like) which is a lot of fun because it's \"name that tune\" and who doesn't love that!"}
{"text":"I sit on the Pour House side - so I can smoke.  Not a dive bar but not too classy either.  Friendly bar staff and clientele. Several tvs usually showing sports.  Live music is often available. The food is well portioned, nothing too fancy - try the pulled pork sandwich.  Decent beer selection - not a beer snob level but not just bud."}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant - went with a big group of family (10).  My dad had the house specialty lasagna and thought it was fantastic.  I had the pulled pork platter and thought it was really good.  Everybody in our group seemed happy with their meal.  But dessert really stole the show - a warm cookie/brownie with vanilla ice cream -AMAZING!  Our waiter was a little snarky and odd but overall a good experience."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of dining her for my mom's Christmas party. The atmosphere is casual and comforting,  everything you want in a smokehouse. I had the prime rib. It was cooked to perfection and seasoned perfectly. It also came with this creamy horseradish sauce that was delicious!  I also had a baked potato which came with the standard butter but also sour cream that was topped with chives. I also hit the salad bar which was just your normal iceberg. They also had romaine and big selection of potato salad, pudding and all kinds of random yummys. The dressings were homemade which always makes a big difference for me in the ranch department.  The service was excellent,  never had to hunt down a bartender or server for an extra napkin or drink. I will definitely be back. A gal in our party had the brisket lasagna and I had some major food envy. I'll be back to give it a try."}
{"text":"Always great food and fun environment. Awesome  cheeseburgers and fries!! Also excellent pulled pork. One of my favorite stops in cavecreek!"}
{"text":"I hate giving a review one star. I love to support local businesses, especially in Cave Creek where there are many great eateries to choose from.  We went on the 4th of July, so yes it was very busy. We made 7pm reservations and we only had to wait a little bit. No biggie, it's to be expected during a busy holiday. The hostess was nice, so was the waitress but you can tell they were a bit overwhelmed. I would not knock off stars for that. I think I would be as well. The entertainment was great. The DJ kept the crowd in a great mood even in spite of the triple digits.  We ordered the BBQ platter which came with a tiny portion of cole slaw, I mean it was brought out in a plastic container that one would use for salad dressing. The beans came out in a little bowl. They were a bit firm and bland. I like my beans cooked slow for a long time. 3 beef ribs, 1/4 rack of pork ribs, pulled pork,2 stale supermarket dinner rolls and brisket. We split the meal between 2 of us. The pulled pork was a soggy greasy mess. The pork ribs were greasy, but the meat was tender. The beef ribs were just OK. I did like the brisket, although it was nothing special compared to other places. What saved everything was the BBQ sauce. That was tasty. My daughter ordered a rueben on sourdough with onion rings. The rings were good, but sadly the meat on the sandwich was very dry and the saurkraut tasted a bit funky. She only took 2 bites of it. I ended up taking it home in case my husband may want to eat it tomorrow. We ended up leaving some of the ribs and sides behind. I may decide to try this place again. I don't think the quality of the food should have suffered because it was a holiday. We did not get served until an hour after sitting down. If the food was good I would not have minded so much. But it was a waste of money. We did have to wait awhile for drink refills, even silverware. My husband had to sit there with a salad in front of him for 10-15 min before he could get a fork. They should have hired someone to strictly just go around and refill drinks. There were a lot of empty glasses around us. The salad bar, was just ok. I have a better salad bar at the hospital I work at. The clam chowder my husband said was decent. I would love to review this place again, maybe not on a busy day. But I think I will probably go elsewhere when I head to Cave Creek. The management should have taken special steps because it was going to be so busy, this would have been a chance to turn around the negative reviews on yelp. They also should have upped the staff. They worked their ass off, but service and the food suffered. Sadly I am in agreement with the majority on yelp."}
{"text":"This is our go to place to eat when my husband and I go out for lunch on a Monday.  We have had lunch and dinner there numerous times.  The food is always good.  We have never had a problem with any of the food we have had there.  Service is always friendly.  Brisket is always wonderful.  Our most recent visit (8-24-15) took awhile to get our food.  1st time out of a few dozen times; isn't bad at all."}
{"text":"Not even as good as its predecessor Silver Spur which paled in comparison to the original Satisfied Frog.      The oil used to fry the food needed changing desperately, so it ruined our broasted chicken, fries, and onion rings.  In a restaurant where probably a third of the dishes go into the fryer, why would you do this?       No complaints about the service, and the veggies in the limited salad bar were fresh enough.       Over all, this rated a big blah."}
{"text":"Food mediocre. Trying too hard to be a roadhouse. Our server lindsey was a bright spot, she deserves better support.  Too many other better choices in the area. We prefer Harolds Cave Creek, we should have stuck with that, but wanted to try something new. Oh well."}
{"text":"My wife and I had lunch here and enjoyed the setting and the food.  Our waitress was busy looking after two rooms with hungry diners.  We both enjoyed our lunch sandwiches.  I had the Reuben Sandwich with cole slaw side.  The sandwich was piled high with meat which was tender. The cole slaw had a bit of a bite too int--an interesting flavor.  The decor is something to observe while waiting for food.  The men's bathroom was small making it necessary to step outside the room to change one's mind and dispose of the paper towel."}
{"text":"Not bad, but will not be returning.  The food wasn't particularly bad, but it wasn't particularly good either.  We ordered the platter.  The pulled pork had an off taste, the ribs were good, brisket slightly dry.  Sauce served on the side tasted like any bottled barbecue sauce.  Flies were annoying.  Waitress was nice.  Took a while for food to be served though..."}
{"text":"This was the first time I had been to the Smokehouse. I came in it was happy hour and had a drink at the outside bar area.  It was nice there, though be warned they do allow smoking. I went inside to get some dinner. This was a Friday night and they were not busy. I sat at the bar and order food. The bartender was barely around and there was about 7 other people sitting at the bar.   The food was ok. I had the fried fish dinner. The fish was cooked and  seasoned good. The tarter sauce was not bad, but I am not a tarter sauce fan. The slaw was sub-par and the sad thing is you can tell it was cut fresh, just need to be seasoned better. The fries were ok and the hush puppies would have been good if they would have been good all the way through.    The inside bar smelled bad. You can tell from the smell it has not been cleaned. It has that stale/mold alcohol smell to it. Also there is nats that fly around that shows it has not been cleaned. The low point is the flies inside.  I had to kill one that was by my food. I took a picture of it because it was a huge fly.   I am not sold on this place and would give it another try to see if service is any better and to see if there is anything on the menu that is good."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a lovely Valentine's Day dinner here. Everything was wonderful. Service was great, and the food was delicious. You have to try the fried mushrooms. :)"}
{"text":"We've been ready to try a new place in Cave Creek and gave this a try on Saturday night. We ordered the ribeye steak and a filet mignon, and were both disappointed. Both our steaks were average at best, and the meat was tough and flavorless. Not bad, but definitely not great.  We sat on the patio and our server was a nice, very young girl, but the service was hit and miss. She never came back after our food was delivered, and we had to ask someone else to please get our check and run our credit card.  We won't be back. Bummer...we had higher hopes for this place."}
{"text":"YIKES!! My sister and I were shopping around the cute little western town that this place is housed. We decided to stop in for a drink and a bite to eat. Well we walked into madness. We opened the doors (which are so hard to open it's amazing anyone managed to get in) and there were drunk people everywhere. Mind you, it's 2 o'clock in the afternoon! The place stinks if stale cigarette smoke. As we are sitting there, we come to realize THE OWNERS are part if this drunken crowd.  We were appalled! How do you run a business when you're drunk? People are yelling and screaming and cursing. How embarrassing!! Is this a restaurant or a frat house?? The music is blaring so loud, we could barely talk to each other. We watched the owner do shot after shot And his wife is behind the bar drinking wine!! Very unprofessional!! As two women sitting in there for a cocktail, we were VERY uncomfortable and lost our appetite. We had our one drink and left. So disgusted, we will NOT go back"}
{"text":"Quite literally  the worst meal I have had in years. The steak was freezer burned and had a foul taste. The cowboy beans had the texture of partially dried concrete. The muffins were overcooked. And, I spent the rest of the evening looking for a bathroom.  On a positive note the salad bar was good and the manager took all the meals off the check. I do not recommend and will not return unless dragged by wild horses.  Also the company I was with was terrible but that is not the fault of the restaurant!"}
{"text":"I'm really big on giving credit where credit is due, but this place f@#!king sucked! This is my first visit after moving to the Cave creek area five years ago, and after sitting for more than 10 minutes with no one acknowledging our presence it was time to get up and leave. Had my wife and I stayed, there's no way that we could have enjoyed our meal after our anxiety levels rose just wondering whether or when we would be noticed by a server, its not as if we seated ourselves. The time was just past 4:00 pm and there were only a few customers at the time, I did notice that a family seated just after we arrived had no trouble receiving their beverages, but after that they too seemed to have been forgotten. I'll never know for sure because it was shortly thereafter that we decided to leave. If this were my business this crap would never fly, the owner or owners should maybe spend less time on the golf course or in the spa, and more time tending to their business before its too late. Just my two cents worth."}
{"text":"Had dinner at the Smokehouse Saturday night.  My wife had heard that they had great BBQ Brisket.  I asked the waiter if he would recommend the \"Special\" Prime Rib, and he said it was spectacular.  When my Prime Rib arrived, it was cold and had no flavor.  I complained, and the waiter said he would have the kitchen heat it up.  I protested, and he went to the manager and offered m=to get me a warm cut.  I said OK.  He returned with another cold piece of meat.  The BBQ beef was just ok, and nothing special. When we paid our bill, the waiter said that he had no control over the quality of the food that came out of the kitchen, and I replied that he could have warned us about the poor quality of the food that we ordered.  Most of the restaurants in Cave Creek suck anyway, and this one just joined the list of restaurants that I will never go to again."}
{"text":"Cold food. terrible service. Restaurant doesn't know the difference between shaved and sliced brisket. Food was  below average. Service people were clueless to their own menu. Had to ask for something to be taken off because if came our cold and not as described. Should have known it would be like this as there was only one other person in the place. would not go back. To many other places to choose from.  Sad to see to bad satisfied frog is gone from there."}
{"text":"The Smokehouse and Pourhouse are great establishments, I frequent the Pourhouse more seeing I can walk here from my house and throw back a few before dinner/lunch and have never had a bad time. The food is always good for the price, granted, but the local feel is what you are going for. Reading all the poor reviews bothers me because I think people have set their expectations high and most of the poor reviews were from the begining of the Smokehouse/Pourhouse when they first transitioned from the Satisfied Frog, then Silver Spur and now the Smokehouse. working out the bugs is necessary in this industry, and I know its a laid-back bar/eatery, but it is in Cave Creek for peet's sake! Perfectly Uncivilized....."}
{"text":"We were looking to try a new/different place in Cave Creek, so we gave this place a try.  Fairly empty on a Saturday night (and many of the surrounding places were jam packed).    Our waitress was attentive and friendly - she only had maybe one other table besides us.  Food was decent, nothing special.  I enjoy food cooked on a smoker - I have one myself - and was a bit disappointed at the lack of flavor on my rib combo platter.  Serving size was decent, food wasn't terribly unique or distinctive though.  My wife seemed to enjoy her smoked chicken and the chili she ordered as an appetizer.  The owner stopped by while we were eating and seemed friendly enough.    A bit dark and dreary inside, didn't seem to be the happ'nin' place in Cave Creek on a Saturday night..."}
{"text":"Wish there was an option for no stars.  Food was bad!  Salad bar dressing had a film on top for sitting so long.  Should not be called a smoke house, I would bet they use an electric smoker and use particle board since that's what the food tasted like.  Bad sause, poor tasting meat!  The McRib is a better option."}
{"text":"Pulled pork sandwich was melt in your mouth.  ONLY Bar-B-Que place in Cave Creek that I go to when I'm craving some great Bar-B-Que!"}
{"text":"We showed up about 430pm for a steak dinner. We were interested in this place as a possible venue for our wedding. The wedding was just getting started and was only about 60 people. Venue was really nice and charming. I'm here to review the restaurant. We were given the lunch menus at dinner time. I had to get up To ask for a dinner menu. After at least 10 minutes I got up again to ask the female manager who our waitress was as we hadn't even given a drink order yet. After 20mins we met our waitress and got drinks. Our waitress could care less about us. My fiancée ordered the fillet medium. It came out way bleeding rare. I ordered the prime rib which came out too well done. After I got up again to show the manager how raw her steak was they did bring her an extra corn muffin. So I ate a huge prime rib by the time she got her fillet the second time. Prices were reasonable. Place was clean and charming. When food got cooked to order, it was really good. Those are the only reason I gave it 2 stars. Other guests a table away complained about the way their steaks were not cooked to order either. Funny, I bet they never thought in a million years that lousy service cost them me handing them $9000 for a wedding at their venue. I loved everything else.  I only tipped 10%. I never do that.  Service was that bad."}
{"text":"This place had the best fried chicken I've ever eaten. Solid beer selection including some local AZ breweries and great bbq. Friendly folks tending bar and serving food. Price was pretty decent for all the food you got. Definitely will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I have only visited the Cave Creek Smokehouse for their Friday Night Fish Fry and it's epic! The fish tastes fresh and is always cooked after you order it. Nice and crispy, another big plus is that they also hook you up with unlimited french fries, coleslaw and hush puppies. Most fish fry's that I have been to only will give you additional fish but no sides. Service has always been on par they make you feel right at home."}
{"text":"Cheap drinks for happy hour for sure. Tiny bar with real \"creekers\".. very smokey and loud with serious drinkers. This is where you find the locals. Hit or miss with the entertainment but the crowd itself is entertaining enough. I have had a few dishes there that were tasty. Free popcorn inside if you go into the indoor bar. P.S. The dartboard sucks, bring your own plastic darts if you want them to stick. The staff is friendly, never had a problem here."}
{"text":"Third time to the restaurant.  The first time was Excellent. The second time was okay. Tonight was so disappointing it just earned the won't be back award. When you bring out of town guests to a restaurant that serves Prime Rib, which is what you had 3 weeks ago and earned the excellent,  you probably should have not run out at 7:10 p.m. on a Saturday night. The salad bar that earned an excellent the first time now is empty and not stocked. The sautéed vegetables,  we're heated warm, never hit a Sautee pan."}
{"text":"My sister called and spoke to the owners wife the day after this happened and told her I wanted some sort of compensation. The owners wife said she wanted all of us to come back. My sister explained she was from Rhode Island so that wouldn't be possible. Anyway we never heard from anyone... Just thought everyone should know."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever! Horrible service, surly waitress and a manager that does not care. Avoid this place like like plaque!!!"}
{"text":"Bartender was a complete bitch and dressed like a slut.  Food was terrible.  All the local cave creek \"drunks\" hang out there.  If you are not one of the \"locals\" then expect to be treated like crap.  Bitch hostess says I can't have my dog there when their website says they allow dogs?!  Save your money and don't give this place your business.  I am a local in cave creek myself and I will be telling everyone NOT to eat there!  I hope the owner reads this too."}
{"text":"A two because the staff was nice. The food was cheap and made me question their food handling procedures. It was awesome when I was a kid and it was the Satisfied Frog :("}
{"text":"My sister's family loves this place for the burgers, but I have yet to try one of these.  They do look quite good.    On my first visit I had chili in a bread bowl, and it was excellent. Rich and flavorful, but not too acidic and just spicy enough.  The taco salad was my pick for the second visit.  It was the worst ever -- shredded iceberg with banal meat (I had grilled chicken) and a very small amount (2 teaspoons?) of shredded cheddar and ... wait a minute, was that really it? Oh yeah, one other thing - a greasy, dark-colored, fried white flour tortilla.  The promised green chili was not there.  I hunted down the waitress, who was stocking glasses behind the bar.  (She had not paid us the privilege of returning to ask us how everything was so I had to seek her out).  I asked her for some guacamole in an effort to liven the dish up a bit.  It didn't work.  The guacamole was not from fresh avocados but that frozen concentrate cheaper restaurants seem to admire.  Have you ever seen this stuff in packaged form?  It arrives at the restaurant in the same packaging as frozen concentrated orange juice.  I'll go back to be with my dear family but not proactively."}
{"text":"Best fried chicken ever! The smoked sausage appetizer and wings were delicious the cornbread was hot and the butter melted immediately and the service was amazing and totally made our experience at the smokehouse awesome! Can't wait to go back!!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! We are originally from MN and this is the Vikings bar for us! We brought Minnesota visitors here and they really loved the western atmosphere and the awesome food! We really had a great time here and plan to make this regular stop, even when we don't have out of town visitors!"}
{"text":"Very attentive staff....delicious food! Ordered pulled pork & brisket, fries, onion rings, fantastic cole slaw!  Interesting decor....fun place."}
{"text":"I came in for the prime rib Saturday they had sold out by 630 poor service food maybe average at best I recommend any other place I have to say this is a disappointment actually when you come to cave creek eat first"}
{"text":"Slowest service I have ever experienced. Took almost 30 minutes after arriving to get our drinks. Keep in mind this was a Wednesday night with only two other people seated at another table. Good was ok, not great. We had to hunt down our waitress to get our check so we could hurry up and leave."}
{"text":"In Arizona, if you want a really good steak but don't want to take out a second mortgage to pay for it, I suggest you come here. Cave Creek Smokehouse.  A New York Strip is seventeen dollars and it puts most other places to shame at a full inch and a half thick. Seasoned perfectly, caramelized and cooked to perfection, this was one of the best steaks I've had in a very long while. The sides were good too.   Save room for the strawberry shortcake...it's superb.  After dinner, mosey on over to the pour house. Lots of locals, (mostly transplants) who look like they just stepped out of pages of Bridle and Bit. Some real characters.  The men look tough, but they scare real easy.  Pussies."}
{"text":"Somehow the waiter didn't submit our order. As we watched people that came in 15 minutes after us getting their food,  it was obvious something was wrong.  Stuff happens.  Had the waiter been honest and brought out something to nibble on, it would have been fine.  Instead,  we got the standard \"they\" made a mistake and zero effort to deal with the screw up. Might be a great place when things go well.  Certainly don't know how to respond when things go south."}
{"text":"Cave Creek Smokehouse and Pourhouse Patio.  Hard to keep up with this place - it was the Silver Spur a few months ago.  And it could be something else tomorrow.  The food's pretty standard - burgers, BBQ, steaks, chicken, blah blah, blah. Cowboy atmosphere, train yourself waitstaff (who easily get flustered), screaming children who want more popcorn..........  Good place for kids - it's in Frontiertown - so the sheriff rides thru on weekends.  Lady next door at the Visitor Center is very helpful about Cave Creek."}
{"text":"It is nice to have a BBQ spot close to me. That being said, we make better BBQ in our back yard. I will say the smoked meats were tasty though. All and all I felt it was pretty generic and not very flavorful. They do a lot of unique things with the menu that spice things up. The employees however were very nice and made it a better experience as well as fair pricing. If your dying to get some ribs check this place out but don't expect anything to write home about."}
{"text":"Good food but very slow service.  We arrived just before noon and it took 30 minutes to get anything after we ordered.  They seemed to be distracted or short on service staff which is odd for a noon meal.  We had the barbecue brisket sandwich that was quite good.  The meat was tender and lean and the taste was good.  If you are hungry or hope to get in and out, I wouldn't count on this place."}
{"text":"I'm visiting my parents from out of town and was told I just 'HAD TO' have the prime rib. Apparently it is amazing, though I never experienced it. Or the beef ribs. Or a ribeye. I did experience a salad bar with half of the stuff missing. The added bonus hair from whomever was a treat though! Delicious even. :/ Apparently they are under new management, which would be an excuse except that it is not. Having been in the service industry, were I running the shift I would have been apologetic or offered to reduce the bill, toss in a dessert or even just been extra friendly and helpful in selecting an alternative to what has been 86'd. That was not my experience. Will not be back. (The waitress did express that she felt bad).  Edit: After getting the ribs, the 'sautéed' vegetables were still almost raw. Yeah, so not coming back. Not often a place lets you so down so immediately that you will go out of your way to warn people. This place would have taken the cake, but they're probably out of that too..."}
{"text":"Ugh.  I really hate to write this review...  I love to support local businesses and especially BBQ.  But this one is worth driving past.  On the upside, the staff works really hard and I hope they can turn this place around, but it seems as though their business model is based on copious amounts of really bad food served by chesty 19 year-olds wearing tight, thin black tank tops and low rise jeans.  Not that I have anything against chesty young ladies bringing me food, but you have to have more than that to stay in business.  Imagine if Hooters opened a 3rd rate BBQ shack.  Skip this place and check out the Buffalo Chip - You'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"We had really bad service & just okay BBQ our first time here. Decided to give it another chance.  It was a nice night for the patio, but the hostess/waitress warned us we would be forgotten if we sat on the patio. It took 15 min just to get iced tea. After 40 minutes we were told they over cooked our sirloin and the ticket was lost initially. When the $20 steak finally arrived it was grey. There was no seasoning at all. It did not taste fresh. The catfish fry did not taste like catfish. The breading was bland and the fish chewy. The hush puppies were raw on the inside. We weren't offered a drink refill until after she brought our ticket to leave. The Mexican place across the street (El Encanto) has way better steak than this place!"}
{"text":"I would recommend that the staff not sit at the bar smoking cigarettes on their breaks as it is extremely unprofessional and disgusting."}
{"text":"Best coleslaw of my life.  The pork sandwich was a little dry but they give you a cup of their homemade BBQ sauce which was really good."}
{"text":"Arizona is Great and I hung out here with a friend, had some drinks and played some darts. Good wholesome fun and warm. Thank You Cave Creek Smokehouse!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a cold beer in the Beer Garden last Friday after work.  Loved the crowd and the service was friendly and the beer cold! We weren't going to eat, but the BBQ and the fried chicken smelled so good we couldn't resist.   Look forward to going back when they have live music outside.  This is a do again as my hubby says!"}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere, great prices! What else can you ask for?   Make sure to try the Brisket Lasagna!"}
{"text":"I've been wondering how long it would be until I had the chance to write a review in this sort of situation; namely, where the reviewers have averaged 2.5 stars but where I personally found the experience to be something completely and utterly different from their experiences and worthy of a very significant deviation.  I've written 26 restaurant reviews and only given out 5 stars on two occasions.  Time to give out #3!  My \"party\" included myself, my wife, and our 9 year old girl.  We came up from North Phoenix and arrived at \"Frontiertown\" on Saturday night at about 745pm.  After briefly walking around the \"town\", we entered the smokehouse and were politely told to seat ourselves wherever we'd like.  I would say the restaurant was only at 35% capacity at the time, the \"Pourhouse\" side seemed much busier (and rowdier).  Clearly, this is a place usually filled with Cave Creek locals.  Our waitress - I failed to get her name - was a friendly young lady with shorter dark hair and a tattoo on her right shoulder.  I suspect that if you get her as a waitress you are going to be very pleased...she is friendly, attentive, and quite knowledgeable about the restaurant and its offerings and she has an excellent tableside manner.   We ordered:  -the smokehouse platter (essentially, a four meat platter with two sides for two people) -Pulled Pork sandwich with onion rings for the 9 y/o. -One salad bar trip for two adults -Cave Creek Smoked Porter beer in a mason jar for me. -A couple of glasses of house wine for the wife.    The platter meats surpassed my expectations given previous reviews.  I had set my expectations pretty low, but was very pleasantly surprised by the brisket, pulled pork, and beef ribs.  The only thing that seemed ordinary on the platter was the pork ribs, and even they weren't bad at all.  Portions are generous, I'd say this would satisfy two fairly hungry large men.  If I were to pick a standout, it would probably be the brisket.  For me (and the wife agreed) it was perfect...light-to-moderate smoky taste, lovely char on the tips, and NOT served swimming in sauce (sauce was served on the side).  All four meats were especially tender and quite juicy...very well done, folks-in-the-kitchen!   My 9 year old really had no hope of finishing her sandwich due to the excellent portion size. Her onion rings seemed freshly cut and breaded, we agreed they were actually quite fantastic.   The salad bar does seem to be a fairly consistent hit with other reviewers, and I'd agree.  It isn't particularly fancy, but has a very pleasing array of protein and vegetable components, and I found them ALL to be fresh and tasty.  The dressing bins were messy due to use over the recent hours, but they weren't unsanitary and dressings were accordingly easily managed.  The soup of the day was actually extraordinary, and clearly made from scratch.  Indeed, as I was pulling a fresh bay leaf or two from my bowl of Chicken Fadelle, I took the time to closely inspect the soup ingredients and structure, and I was truly taken with the craft and care that went into the simple but superbly seasoned soup.  Again, well done!  The beer list, for a craft brew fan like me, was somewhat limited but I found it sufficient.  I came for the food, and if I REALLY need some craft brew, I can walk a bit west to Big Earls.  :)  Service consistently excellent throughout the night.  As we were finishing our meal, a lady emerged from the kitchen apparently to give a complimentary sundae to another patron for a birthday....yeah, I could definitely believe that folks would find this place to be worthy of a birthday meal, or any other special occasion for that matter.  Anyhow, in conclusion, I have tried just about every BBQ joint in North Phoenix, from Lovejoys (when it existed), Satisfied Frog on Bell, Toms in Tempe, Hammered Hog/Notorious P.I.G., Thee Pitts Again, Stacys, and so forth.  For me, the Smokehouse routed 'em all, from decor to service to food to location.  We'll be back for sure.  I'm pleased to \"go against the grain\" on this review and vote with significant deviation from the crowd."}
{"text":"Placed a large carry out order for friends in for Thanksgiving. The food was decent but they forgot the 3 deserts ordered. I called and got no apology and was put on hold and then hung up on. This happened two more times so I gave up and will now have to drive back there to get a refund."}
{"text":"My husband and I really wanted some good old fashioned barbeque after living overseas for awhile, but this place just didn't do it for us.   Sure the ribs were OK, but just OK, and the beans and coleslaw were just that as well.....OK. The service was friendly and at least and the place was clean, oh, and don't forget the free popcorn while you wait.....but this still doesn't make up for a not so good rib/barbeque experience. We won't be back and won't be recommending this place to family or friends."}
{"text":"We stopped in yesterday (Memorial Weekend Sunday) for drinks. We had family in town and decided to show them around Cave Creek. We'd eaten a huge breakfast at Harold's a couple of hours before...so, we weren't looking for food, just drinks and an order of chicken tenders for the kids.  Business was slow. When we got there, two tables were seated and there was one guy at the bar. Our waitress arrived about 5 minutes later to take our drink order (1 iced tea, 2 waters, 1 lemonade, 1 milk, 1 corona and 1 prickly pear margarita...boring, I know...but there were 3 kids, a baby, and a pregnant woman in the party). After 15-20 minutes of waiting, we flagged down another waiter. While, he was taking our order, our original waitress arrived with drinks. So, we placed the chicken tenders order and waited AGAIN. More waiting for the bill to arrive. Once my husband gave her the credit card, I brought the kids outside.  After another 20 minutes, the other adults met me. My husbad was still in there waiting to get his credit card returned. The manager (who was also waiting tables) stopped by to ask if he needed anything. He told her what was happening and said she'd get the owner.  As it turns out, our waitress was also the bar tender. We were the unlucky ones to get the one table that the bar tender is assigned to serve (it was not even in the same room as the bar!). So, they'll be changing that policy.  Did they comp anything? NO   Not that we were looking for free stuff. But, a confused manager, apologetic owner, and waitress with 100 excuses after an hour and a half ordeal doesn't sit well with me. The manager did say,  \"I hope you didn't tip her!\"    With all of the touristy, cowboy restaurants in Cave Creek, I'll pass on the Smokehouse. As newer residents to Cave Creek, we've eaten there once before and the food was not memorable. The main attraction is the location. Oh, and the kids like the piano & dummy in the front room."}
{"text":"Good bar food snacks, meals were average.   Fun crowd."}
{"text":"Awesome Place To Be At With Family, A Date, or yourself talking to JD all night about your Blues.   #Happy4thArizona!! #RedWhite&Blue!! #MexicanAmericanLove!!"}
{"text":"Service was great! I ordered the Smokehouse Sampler Platter and it was more than enough for two. The corn bread muffins was the bomb! I was with a party of 20 peoples and they had no problem on service."}
{"text":"Good: Burger Ribs Pulled Pork Cold beers Friendly service  Not as good: Onion rings Cole slaw Sticky tables and chairs Tiny bathrooms No changing table due to tiny bathroom  If you don't come here with high expectations, you'll leave happy, full, and relaxed.   We recently went to a wedding out at the fountain and it was lovely and the style of rustic that's very chic right now. That white chapel, which was used as the bride's room, is great for photos too. However, the food was not ideal. Appetizers were make your own nachos, messy wings with ranch, taquitos with no flavor, some veggies with dip. The main course was beef brisket and/or grilled chicken with bread, salad, and baked beans. I had actually ordered the vegetarian meal, which was a very disappointing bowl of bland steamed veggies and noodles. Blah. The tables and chairs looked nice, the bartender and servers were cool, and if you want to walk away from the crazy wedding happenings, then you can carefully wander the tiny dusty cowboy 'town' in your four inch wedge heels."}
{"text":"Good food.  Great Sauce.  Friendly staff.  The amazing aroma of smoking meat hits your senses going before you even have a chance to walk inside.  Cave Creek Smokehouse & Pour House Patio has a wonderful small town barbecue feel to it.  My girlfriend and I decided to split an entree and starter for our meal.  We wanted to try the buffalo wings, but they were out.  The manager suggested that we try the chicken tenders and they'd use one of their chicken wing sauces with them.  She said it would be just like having boneless wings.  This was a good and suitable substitution.  The chicken itself wasn't anything special, but the honey chipotle sauce was fantastic.  We also asked for a suggestion from the waitress for the entree.  We couldn't decide between the brisket or the beef ribs.  Turns out they were also out of beef ribs.  Guess that decision was easy.  Good thing the brisket was awesome.  It had that perfect charred from the smoke outside, but still just a little pink on the inside.  The barbecue sauce was wonderful.  We also had an order of corn bread which was disappointing.  Very dry.  It was a Monday afternoon, which may explain why the restaurant was out of so many items.  However it's a holiday (president's day), so the place should have been more prepared.  Cave Creek Smokehouse & Pour Patio is a good barbecue joint.  It definitely beats any barbecue chain out there.  If You're up that way, check it out, but I wouldn't make a special trip."}
{"text":"My husband and I had an early dinner so it wasn't very busy.  We were seated right away and our waiter, Anthony, was great! We asked for recommendations and he recommended the Smokehouse platter and a great new beer which we loved. The beef and pork ribs were cooked to perfection. It was shown as a meal for two and we had leftovers. And the price was very reasonable. We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Great ribs!! Good selection of cheap beers. This is one of my favorite places to take friends for a true Cave Creek experience- of course it is important to set their expectations appropriately."}
{"text":"Seriously one of the best pulled pork and beef brisket sandwiches. The cornbread was to die for. I would absolutely come here again. Try this place, you will LOVE it!!!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time or money here.  The first red flag......I pulled up and saw it was part of a tourist trap in Frontier Town. Second red flag.....I didn't smell any smoker operating.  While our server (Jen) was excellent, the food was comically bad. The place is called Cave Creek Smokehouse, and based on that, I expected the meat on the  Smokehouse Platter to maybe have a smokey flavor. It had none. Not the beef ribs, babybacks, brisket or pulled pork. It pretty much smelled like unseasoned meat that sat in an oven until it was mummified, and the flavor was non-existent.  The beef ribs and brisket were extremely dry as well. The beans were completely flavorless and undercooked, the cole slaw fair at best. I was starved when I got there. I hadn't eaten since breakfast, so I asked for something to nibble on right away. Jen brought out four tiny corn bread muffins in a basket. Little did I know they would cost me three bucks. But at least they had some flavor. Nothing else did.  The funny thing about this is that when I pulled in the parking lot and saw what this place was, I jokingly said to my wife that we should walk across the street now, and eat at El Encanto instead. I now wish I had.  At least my dogs get to eat the leftovers."}
{"text":"This place has great ambiance, if you are looking for a good ole western type place. The burgers are amazing and it is surrounded by quaint shops that will allow you to walk off the delicious meal you just had.  There is plenty of room and there is a nice patio area. Bring friends, and lots of them...there is definitely room!"}
{"text":"Best fried chicken and service in the State! We've been coming here for years. The bbq is great as well, but on Sunday's we always go for the all you can eat fried chicken."}
{"text":"The food was decent but there were so many flies and knats that came inside and it really made it hard for me to enjoy the place.   I think I spent more time trying to swat them away than actually eating lol.  Although I had no issues with the food or service, I don't think I'll be returning."}
{"text":"Got to say this place has become a loser. the food has been bad every time we've tried it - Hey... a Ruben with no 1,000 island? fake onions rings made of mushy onion paste? A bartender that can't get more than one drink at a a time? bbq that's dried out and re-fried beans with NO taste? Sorry but other places deserve my money more. Not trying to be overly critical - just real. Too many options when dining out these days."}
{"text":"We are Cave Creek Residents and think this is a bit of a tourist trap......   We got the dinner Sampler Platter. Beef Ribs (meh), Pork Ribs (OK), Beef Brisket (Meh) and Pulled Pork (pretty good!). The corn bread muffins were OK, but the Cole slaw was terrible and the beans were about as bland as could be.   The beers are inexpensive, but the food is just OK, except for the pulled pork and BBQ sauce.   So if you stick with a beer and pulled pork you'll be OK, otherwise I would skip it!"}
{"text":"I decided to go for the 1/4 rack smoked baby back ribs! With their house BBQ sauce, they were amazing!! Tender, great flavor & with the tangy sauce....well, it was hard to stop eating them! Getting a trip to the salad bar was a delicious addition to the meal. Our server was very helpful on menu choices & friendly, too. Good eats, Great service, excellent value for the money...yes!, they get my 5 Stars!!"}
{"text":"I live here. Wanted to take our houseguest for dinner and chose the Smokehouse.  Can't deny the price is ok, and food good, but the service was extraordinarily horrible!!  probably because we ordered water instead of a bar drink, she took our order, we waited and waited until we hailed a busboy and asked for our waitress. Food finally came, then our son asked for more fish (all you can eat fish fry) again we waited and waited, maybe 15 minutes and again asked the bus boy. He brought  the fish. Then we waited another 15-20 minutes, no check, I asked the hostess to get our waitress who was behind the bar laughing with another waitress. Took us 30 minutes to pay the bill.  We were so disgusted my son left money and check on the table, and we later learned we paid -About $10. More than the food we ordered.  bad bad service, will never go there again. left our guests with a very bad impression of our town."}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever seen at a bar.  I was standing at the bar for at least 5 minutes while the bartender completely ignored me, washing glasses.  Finally I walked out and got a beer somewhere else.  My friends had similar problems.  They need to fire that female bartender she is absolutely awful.  It wasn't busy, she was just being lazy.  Jon Taffer would have a field day with her."}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday night.  The restaurant side was closed for a private party but the patio was open - no problem, they had swamp coolers and fans running so the temperature was managable.  Ambiance was somewhere between dive bar, pole shed and street vendor.  OK, there was this smell, an unpleasant combination of bar mat and beer fart that we just couldn't get away from.  Our server was friendly enough, making conversation and joking, but I get the feeling he wasn't usually a waiter - perhaps a bartender pressed into waiting tables since the restaurant had a party?  Anyway we ordered two different beers and both tasted of dirty taps.  My husband's so much he actually started to feel ill halfway in.  The food, I had the cuban sandwich with fries which wasn't half bad - not great but OK.  My husband ordered the pulled pork platter.  The pork definately tasted \"off\", like perhaps it had sat in the fridge for a week or so.  Beans just meh, same for the slaw.  Also, even though we would not have ordered another of the dirty tap beer, our waiter never checked in on us once we received our meals, in fact we had to track him down so we could pay our tab.  All in all we will not be back for drinks or for food."}
{"text":"This is our first time at the Smokehouse. Came here to follow Songo. Saturday night is Prime Rib special. Cuts are generous for 10 and 14 ounce. I'm not a Au jus person but OMG, tons of flavor. Meat was cooked to order perfectly. Tender as can be. The Pour House is where Songo is on Saturday night. Great bar hang out. Full restaurant menu available in the bar."}
{"text":"Had Tri Tip Lasagna and the salad bar. Kept me full the whole day. Next visit had the wild wings and green chile soup, both where excellent"}
{"text":"A Saturday at lunch - so a good time around there judging by the crowd, the place was about 1/3 to 1/2 busy. Nice waitress, as a person that is, but a bad dining experience.  Ordered Chicken Fried Steak and got a Chicken Fried Chicken. She was pushing chicken in the Nachos my partner got so it got stuck in her head I guess. She offered to swap it out but, hey, the nachos had been there for 15 minutes already and I wanted to eat. I wasn't going to wait for something else.  So the waitress was sorry and she did take 15% off the bill but still, with both items I ordered I didn't get what I ordered.   You see I also ordered a full-rack of beef ribs to go. (You don't find many places that serve beef ribs and I miss them. (See County Line in Texas for the BEST beef ribs on the planet.)  So they are wrapped up and when I get home there is a HALF-rack of beef ribs. And these things are WAY over cooked and most of the meat is like beef jerky.   $60 for this experience and never again."}
{"text":"So I went here today with the family. I must say I am thoroughly unimpressed. I got a taco salad and it came out already cold, even the meat.  My husband got a burger and was like meh. My daughter got the green chili soup, took a couple of bites then decided she was full. The uncle liked the pulled pork sandwich ok and the in-laws shared some ribs, they too said not so good. The appetizer was okish but the experience wasn't great. All in all I won't suggest this place."}
