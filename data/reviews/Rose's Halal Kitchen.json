{"text":"Im here at Rose's kitchen right now waiting for our order of 6 jerk chicken take out platters smelling the delicious spices that go into each and every piece of jerk chicken, curry and more. I found out about this place last week and have been here 3 times during Ramadan (dont judge). We've only had the jerk chicken with rice and peas and it has been great every single time. Spices and sauce were so goood. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Generous portion and staff members are super nice. I arrived from Ottawa and was looking for Carribean restaurant and came across this little joint and it worth the try. We ordered a large Jerk chicken and curry goat. As someone very familiar with the Jamican food, the Jerk chicken was super authentic and well marinated. I Haven't tried the curry goat. Will recommend this place and will go back again."}
{"text":"Best halal Jerk chicken in town. The only draw back is they don't accept credit cards."}
{"text":"I heard good things about this place. So when I finally made it out here, I ordered the jerk chicken. And i was not disappointed. Both the chicken and rice tasted great!

Look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"NOTE***** THE ONLY REASON I REMOVED ONE STAR IS BECAUSE IT IS NOT A COMFORTABLE PLACE TO SIT AND EAT... 

I am so glad that this place exists...
I have been trying to find an
AMAZING
HALAL*********
LET ME REPEAT...
HALAL!!!!!!
JERK CHICKEN PLACED 
made by an authentic Jamaican.

The portions are appropriate.
The location is in a busy area (Scarborough)
The venue isn't so great to sit at...which doesn't really matter because you can have the amazing food in the comfort of your home
Their house made pepper sauce is really good 
The owner is really nice and welcoming
You can tell the food is made FRESH!!!! 
and the taste of the food is ASTONISHING!!!!! 

I don't know how many times I have bought food from here but it was worth it everytime.

I always get the jerk chicken which includes chicken (Of course) rice and peas... and coleslaw....

There are two sizes (Small and large) 

The food is also fresh to eat the next day as well... 

I have no complaints about this place but I am pretty sure the owner is going need to start hiring more people to help him out because IT IS GROWING!!!!

I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!! If i could, I would work at this place just to eat the food everyday :)"}
{"text":"I've become a weekly regular. Authentic home made jerk chicken by the owner's mother. It's got a nice spicy kick and saucy. Rice and slaw are too good. It's more of a takeout pizza place now but the owner just added lots of seating. The only thing is sometimes it takes a little long to get the food but all good food does. It's 100% Halal."}
{"text":"Went twice, on a sat and weekday. Food on the weekend is fresher. The rice is served warm and soft. Second time I went there, the food was little cold and the rice taste like over night rice.... picture was taken on the Saturday and was served by a man."}
{"text":"I've pretty much had everything on their short menu. I've also done catering with them. Not much of a fan of their coleslaw but rice and peas are on point as well as their Jerk chicken. It's very good esp for my Muslim brothers and sisters who eat halal and never got to try Jerk. They were all pleasantly surprised. I've even had my Jamaican friends say \"yeah that's real jerk.\" So it's as authentic as it gets and it's HALAL. Triple star bonus for that!!"}
{"text":"I never had authentic Jamaican food before so I did not know what to expect. Once the order was placed, the food came soon enough and it smelled amazing. The jerk chicken was seasoned very well and there was some sort of thick gravy/curry on top of it that added so much flavour. The rice with beans and coleslaw combined with the chicken went so well together. I was very impressed. The food does take some time to prepare but thats because it is super fresh. I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Really flavourful and tasty. I mainly take take out all the times. They do have tiny seating place but it's not desirable environment to sit and eat. But the owner is very honest which I really liked about his business. Once their chicken wasn't fresh and they didn't take order. Make sure you call 20mins before you go."}
{"text":"Service 4.5*
Food 4.5*
Ambiance 3*
Best jerk chicken in town so far! It's been hard to find a good jerk place but not anymore. 
The rice and peas with Jerk Chicken was amazing
If you like creamy coleslaw then this is the place. 
Also had the sandwich special it's $5 with drink well worth it. Being halal this place is worth it. 
They have a few tables and it's not known for the Ambiance but take out is lit. The place is clean and friendly staff."}
{"text":"I brought my parents here last night.  My dad had the king fish and mom and I had the jerk chicken plates.  We were all so satisfied with our meals in terms of the quality and portions.  The business is run by a Jamaican family so you're getting authentic Jamaican food.  They're very nice people.  The store itself is very plain looking so that's something they could improve on in the future.  I'll definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Perfect place to take out. Really enjoyed the jerk chicken and the plantains. Nice friendly staff would definitely go again."}
