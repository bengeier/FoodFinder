{"text":"I found the burger to be good, but nothing remarkable. It's definitely above average but for all the hype I had been hearing about B Spot I guess I expected more. It's pretty pricey for being counter service as well. Burger, fries and soda were $19. Not bad but nothing I feel I absolutely need to ever try again."}
{"text":"Sorry, but not at all impressed. I wish I had read the reviews prior to paying $17 for this burger and fries (w/ tax, no drink). Last time I was in Cleveland, I had lunch at Lola's...it was DELICIOUS and less expensive (yep, that's right). 

So why the 2 stars...ok, to start, I ordered the Yo burger medium...it came out well done (in hindsight, I should have sent it back). The flavor was slightly above average but not $10.99 good...not even close. As for the fries, ok, but not $4 ok. 

Overpriced, underwhelmed. If you're going for lunch, try Symon's Lola's instead. It's just around the corner. If you're going for dinner...well, don't come here.

It's unfortunate because I hear his other B Spot stores are very good. This one needs work."}
{"text":"Ordered their house salad and added chicken. total was 17 dollars for the salad. 

lets just say the salad was by far terrible. chicken wasnt cut, lettuce was wet and old, and the tomatoes were not fresh. for this price i expected to get sonething good, but was extremely disapointed.

i will never purchase anything from there again, and dont recommend this restraunt to anyone"}
{"text":"Thought I would give this a try. I ordered the Fat Doug burger, a little into my wait the manager called a meeting which lasted 10 min. Still waiting on my food i thought that was rude. So after 15 min I got my burger, I thought it looked small for 9$. When I took it to my table my sister asked \"is that a slider? Where r the fries?\" yea no fries for 9$ they are extra. 
The burger was ok, I couldn't taste the coleslaw on it because the burger was over powering the taste of the weak slaw. The corn beef was also overpowered.  I was not impressed with the food nor the prices."}
{"text":"The worst meal I have ever had.  The service was poor, we went because I wanted to try a burger of Michael Symon.  I have enjoyed his show and his philosophy on local good food.  We start with a 45 minute wait,usually a good sign.  We get called and are seated in the mall.  Do not see a waitress for 10 minutes.  She takes our order, and is gone for 10 minutes, returns to our table without the drinks.  She apologies and all is fine we order som appetizers and our meals.  Still no drinks, then the aps come and the are cold, ask about drinks ?  Then they bring the drinks and provide regular coke when we asked for diet cokes and a water.  The aps we tried were cold, but we were starving.  We had been flying all day and were starving by 6 pm when we got to the restaurant.  We get our meals, i had ordered the burger with an egg on it. Got the burger no egg, and then waited ten more minutes for an egg that was over done.  No refills on the drinks.  Iwent up to the bar for a soda and no one asked why I had walked in from the mall table to get our drinks refilled.  No manager, the waitress flirted with one of the tables and forgot we were there or at all.  Food might be local but expect it to be cold and inaccurate, I would say not an Iron chef 
Moment more of an iron burger."}
{"text":"For people that are familiar with other B Spot locations, I consider this location in the Horseshoe Casino to be a B Spot \"Lite\".  It has a smaller menu selection, there is no happy hour (to the best of my knowledge), and this location doesn't serve alcohol (though you can get alcohol at one of the two bars in the casino....just don't expect the same type of beer selection that a \"real\" B Spot would have).

Because this is a \"fast food\" restaurant in the casino's (super tiny and loud!) food court, they only give you the option between medium or well-done burgers.  All the burgers are constantly being made so they can crank orders out quickly.  I ordered a medium burger on two separate occasions.  My order was fulfilled quickly.  Both times, there wasn't any pink in the middle, and I would consider it medium-well.  They were still juicy and delicious, though a bit on the small side for my preference.

Burgers at all B Spot locations (including this one) do not include fries or a side item.  You must order and pay for fries or another side separately.

If you have kids, you won't be able to bring them to this B Spot - all casino customers must be 21 to enter.

Prices are typical of B Spot locations: $6 for a plain burger with no toppings, $7 for a cheeseburger, and $8-$9 or so for a \"premium\" burger.  Lola Fries are $4 extra.  They also offer tomato soup, chicken wings, onion rings, brats, salads, and other items.  Soda pop or iced tea is $2.50.

I was caught off guard when I ordered a cup of tap water with my meal, and saw the cashier ring up a charge of $0.50 for the water.  The menu doesn't mention any fee for water, and I didn't recall other B Spot locations charging for water.  I questioned the charge, and was told that the fee is to cover the cost of a cup.  When I asked the manager if I could bring my own cup next time, I was told \"no\", as they wouldn't have time to fill it for me.  (How's that for customer service?)  The casino also doesn't allow any outside beverages to be brought in, so that doesn't help either.

Bottom line: food was very good, orders are filled fast, prices are a bit high, there is no happy hour (or the excellent beer selection typical of suburban B Spot locations), the food court area is too small and too loud, and the water fee is absurd.  Without the tap water fee, I would have given this B Spot location 4 stars.  And I would have given 5 stars if burgers included fries (even for a $2 fee instead of $4) and if this location carried beer and had the same happy hour special that is available at other locations.

Keep up the great work, Mr. Symon!"}
{"text":"Ordered a Fat Doug medium well and some fries. Burger came out and two bites in I realized there was no pastrami on it. Also, the burger was medium rare and had made a soggy pink mess of the bottom bun. I took the burger up and instead of it being remade, they just plopped some pastrami on it and stuck another stake in it.

Compared to the Woodmere location this place is crap. Yeah, it's in a casino food court but I'm still paying $10 for a Michael Simon burger. Do yourself a favor and avoid this location."}
{"text":"Lamb feta burger had good flavor. The burger was small.

The siracha wings were not that spicy and not worth getting."}
{"text":"Simply put. This location sucks compared the rest. Dirty tables.dirty floors,  Rude slow staff that spend more time talking about personal issues. Yes. It is a casino, so bring your expectations down. Its ok because of that."}
{"text":"Meh. Not a very good burger. Pales in comparison to other B Spot burgers I've had at the Westlake location and most other burgers in CLE. Lola fries just ok. My vanilla milkshake brought all the boys to my slot machine. 

If you have the time, walk over to Johnny's Little Bar for a burger instead of this place."}
{"text":"Soaking up the casino excitement, we decided to maximize our experience by dining at the casino.  And lo and behold, the line for B Spot was the longest of all the eatery options.  I opted for the pork sandwich.  It was delicious.  I had the option of adding Coffee BBQ sauce which of course I generously slathered on!  It was delicious!!  But wait...the best part?  The Lola Fries.  Rosemary and sea salt french fries.  Yep, read it and weep.  Hands down the BEST french fries you will ever put in your mouth.  I still think about them...and you can eat them with regular ketchup or B Spot's own ketchup.  I didn't order a burger but to me, they looked kinda small.  But those fries...I may have to walk the 3 blocks and get those damn fries they're that good."}
{"text":"We were not in the mood for Lola's, but really wanted to try a Michael Symon restaurant. We read and had heard mixed reviews but wanted to experience it. Well I wish we would have eaten the free hotel meal. I got my burger well done but the edges were burnt and tasted burnt. Not what I expect from well done. The bacon was 1 slice cut in 2 and the finished burger was smaller than a 1/4 pounder. No visible seasoning, nor could you taste amy salt, pepper, or anything else.  I had to rip off aboit 1/3 of thr bun otherwise several bites would have been bread only. The onion rings had a thick batter and were crisp, but I couldn't detect any seasoning on them.  They tasted ok.  I didn't finish the burger or onion rings.
 The milkshake was the star, which is how this review got it's stars. It was thick, creamy, and delicious. You could actually taste the chocolate in it. Very thick.  A dessert really and a great one. You could have served it upside down, it was that thick.  If I was reviewing dessert instead of the whole dinner it would get 4.5 stars. 
The bill was $38 and change for 2 burgers, 1 shake, and 1 order of onion rings. I would still have given it maybe only 2 stars had the price been less than $10.  Just not tasty."}
{"text":"Beeeeeeeee SPOT BAAAAAAbeeeeee

Chocolate Shake
Onion Rings
and the OLD SCHOOL

few of the burgers I have had as well, but forgot the name of em!!! good stuf

good stuff nuff said !!!!!"}
{"text":"I pretty much echo what most people have said before--this place is mediocre and overpriced.  If you get roped into going (like I did) stick with something simple like the Plain Jane or the cheeseburger--the fancy stuff just didn't work."}
{"text":"I got the porky fries and chocolate shake. The fries were ok. The shake was very tasty. Neither one was worth the price. The cashier was very nice. The other people who handed the food out didn't have great customer service."}
{"text":"I was in town to do the A Christmas Story 5k and originally planned on heading down to Lolita for a burger. When I got into town, I was just exhausted and despite the terrible reviews, I still wanted to try a \"michael symon burger\" even if it was the least desirable location. Well, everyone here was right. First and foremost, it should be a freaking crime to charge $19 for a single burger, fries and drink.....but I suppose when you are one of few outlets in a casino, you can charge whateverthehell you see fit. 

The burger was good, but not great. The fries were terrible and way overpriced. It just wasn't worth half of what they charged."}
{"text":"For a quick burger. For downtown.  It's not bad.  Yet, we all have experienced better.

That's about where the thrills for this place end.  I ordered a $9 cheeseburger and was delivered a dish that at first glance looked like the size of a slider.  Very small.  The burgers taste decent, but the portions are very small.  Avoid the \"Lola Ketchup,\" as it's absolutely the most hideous burger condiment I've ever tasted.

I keep forgetting that this place has some crazy obsession with rosemary fries, and you have to ask for normal french fries.

Burgers take about 10-minutes, their $3 soft drink cups hold a measly 12oz and they use a system of SHOUTING out your name to pick up the order.  So if you have a generic, boring, single syllable name like \"Bob,\" suggest you come up with something more creative when there's a crowd.

Crowd's aren't bad on weekdays, but on weekends I've seen a wait, and a severe drought of table availability."}
{"text":"I should actually give them a zero because..I COULDN'T GET IN!!!! It's in a casino, and unlike every other casino in the world-they won't even let you in the door of the property if you're under 21. It's a fucking burger joint, so they should let under 21's in at least! Or at least put a little disclaimer on their website that says \"if you're under 21, they won't let you in the door\" so as to avoid disappointment from 19-year old burger lovers like me. I even bought a special shirt and everything, but it all turned out to be a huge waste!!"}
{"text":"This is the only B Spot location I have been to.

I ordered the cheeseburger with lettuce, tomato, onion & cheddar cheese. You have to order fries and onion rings separately so it can get kind of pricey.  A meal for four (four burgers, including the Lola and Yo!) and one order of fries + two sodas ended up being more than $50.  That's pretty damn expensive.

Anyway, back to the Cheezburger.  The burgers are smaller than other burgers I have had but they pile on the ingredients.  Ingredients are fresh.  The burger itself was amazing and cooked perfectly.  The bun is buttered and also grilled so there is a slight crispy crunch as you bite into your burger which I love.  Everybody else loved their burgers, too.

The fries are also delicious.  I guess the owner Michael Symon is known for them.  They're matchstick style fries with rosemary.  The fries weren't overly seasoned which was good (nothing like ridiculously salty fries!) but you could definitely taste the rosemary.  They weren't too greasy, either.

Finally, we ordered the vanilla bean apple pie bacon milkshake.  OMG.  That itself is a must try!

Overall, we were very satisfied with our experience at B Spot.  Their menu is limited to compared to other B Spot locations but they still have a nice selection.  Definitely not for the health-conscious."}
{"text":"So I read that there's a Michael Symon restaurant a few blocks from my hotel. Cool. It's at a casino. Okay. So I try to make a trip over there. Nothing is going on downtown, but Horseshoe wants $35 Special Event parking? So I wait for one of the infrequent free parking nights.

You walk through the casino and it turns out that this is just another stall in their food court. Glad I didn't pay to park... 

The brat and onion rings themselves weren't bad, but I couldn't get over the fact that I dropped nearly $30 to eat off of plastic plates at a casino food court.

I went back to the hotel feeling like a sucker."}
{"text":"The burger and fries were fine, but as I fully expected it just isn't the same as heading to an actual B Spot restaurant.  Obviously there is no atmosphere in the Casino foodcourt but the food itself is certainly no comparison and you will pay the premium for location.  The pickle situation is certainly lacking here.

With that said, it is still a fine option for Casino dining and if you are in the mood for a burger as opposed to a piece of pizza or deli sandwich, it will fill you up and taste good in the process."}
{"text":"it takes at least 10 minutes to get your food.  when it does come however it is good.  i just wish they would let you know how long you will be waiting."}
{"text":"Two Michael Symon restaurants in a weekend.  And still.... just ok!!! :-(

The best part about it is that they have the Cleveland ballpark mustard.  If they bottled and sold that mustard I would be all over it.  Also the Vanilla Bacon Apple Pie milkshake.  I did not get that but wanted to!

Anyway.  I tried the Kojak burger which was kind of like a gyro burger.  It was good.  I would have liked less gyro meat.  They are on the small side comparatively to other \"gourmet burger\" places I've been.  Not that its a bad thing... it really is a good size.  (Refrain from the obvious joke here.)

This location IS inside the casino and doesn't feature the full menu that the other locations have.  I may have been inclined to rate it higher had I gone to one of his full B-Spot restaurants and had more options."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place since it's owned by an Iron Chef but I left completely underwhelmed by the food. I got the Stadium brat with rosemary fries and it really wasn't that great. The sauce put over the brat wasn't as tasty as I thought it would be and the brat tasted like something I could get at the local supermarket. I tried each of the side sauces and they were also boring. The fries were just ok. The friends I went with each had a burger and thought it was just as good as anywhere else - nothing special. Husband got a brat with chili and said it was just ok. The ambiance of the place was pretty annoying. The booth was uncomfortable and too close to the \"pickle bar\" so we had people standing next to our table the whole time. My drink was pretty strong though, so 1 star for being heavy handed on the booze. However, I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Yeah, wasn't all impressed with this place. The people behind the counter seemed to be in their own little world. Didn't seem like the customer was all that important when we walked up to the counter. The lady taking our order was ok and she talked loud. Occasionally she would somehow wipe her nose on the sleeve of her shirt. Ew. We had asked for our drinks while we waited for our food. The lady had to ask several times for the others to get our drinks for us. Our food came out within 10 minutes and it was good. But I really wasn't impressed with it either. I noticed that my burger was juicy that it made the bottom bun very soggy. The fries were ok and never had the coffee BBQ, but it was good.

Not very impressed with this location. Maybe it had to do with the feeling of the casino when we first walked in. Not sure. Not too impressed Michael Symon."}
{"text":"Delicious. Expensive for burgers and there are NO substitutions. Mr. Symon believes his way is the best. At least with the one I had, he was right! I didn't add anything and it was delicious. The fries and onion rings are also very good. Large portions on the onion rings. One order to share is plenty for two. Located in the food court!"}
{"text":"The food is great, the service was very friendly. But a casino atmosphere isn't my thing. Ordered the Plain Jane and fries and Charlie ordered the Porky. Both were great. Fries are awesome but got cold fast, I recommend splitting an order."}
{"text":"I ordered a turkey cheeseburger, fries and a soda for a total of about 15$. The order took 20 min to fill. The manager was nice and apologized for the wait and offer me a free milkshake. The food was ok. I put some of Lola's ketchup on the burger which i didn't realize was not regular ketchup and discover I wasn't crazy about the taste. The fries were shoe string. This was my first time here and sadly I don't think I'll come back."}
{"text":"I've said it before regarding \"celebrity\" restaurants, but this is a victim of unreasonable expectations. I don't see many people complain that Wolfgang Puck's airport kiosk isn't as good as Spago, but they seem to expect the world out of anything Symon slaps his name on. B Spot has good burgers and very good fries. That's it. It's overpriced because you're paying for the convenience of scarfing it down without losing your place at the \"Wheel of Fortune\" slot."}
{"text":"They did not have the menu item from the web site I was really looking forward to. There was no indication it would not be available."}
{"text":"Love Michael Symon... but the burgers here are not worth the $$$.

Two cheeseburgers, one order of Lola fries, and two soft drinks in a very casual (loud) dining room were just under $40.

Our burgers were good, not great; both were ordered medium and both were served overdone.  

One would think as well when you pay this much for burgers and fries, you would get your beverage in a glass... with a refill or two.  We got plastic cups of ice with a little soda drizzled over the cubes.  

Dine here if you're at the casino and there are no other options.  If there are other options, go elsewhere.  Life's too short to be disappointed by your burgers and fries."}
{"text":"I am surprised by the low review it got. I think the burger is pretty good as well as the atmosphere of the resuturant. It reminds me a lot of shake shack. I ordered a cheeseburger with root beer and I am happy that the pickles are free:-)"}
{"text":"It's all true kids. It's an unfortunate risk of letting another company run your business. The employees have zero personality and seem like they would rather be somewhere else. If you need to go to a B Spot your best bet is the actual restaurants."}
{"text":"After all the hype of his burger restaurants I finally made it to one and must say the burger (Lola) was good but nothing extraordinary. It was a bit pricey as others have pointed out. Two burgers and a fry ended up being over $25.

Thankfully they opened up one locally but will not I out of way for other burger places make just as good a burger and will not have to travel far to get."}
