{"text":"Excellent service. Accommodated MSG allergy. Fast, hot and fresh food. Very enjoyable."}
{"text":"Really, I'd like to give this place a 2.5, but my utter disappointment in the Szechuan tofu dish means I'm rounding down today. 

It was the promise of Ma Po Tofu (94a - Szechuan style bean curd with mined pork) that brought me here, and this ended up being the worst dish of the bunch. Bland, completely lacking in heat (not even a hint of the numbing Szechuan peppercorn) and texturally meh with chunks of flavorless diced pork rather than fatty ground meat.

They seem to do heat alright, because our Thai style mixed vegetables had a nice kick, albeit with a somewhat overpowering sauce. The aforementioned vegetables were nicely spicy and elevated with a handful of fried cashews, though sauced a little to much for my liking.

Curry beef fried noodles where unremarkable, with a handful of sliced green peppers and thinly sliced beef. Nothing I'd run out for again.

The free (with $35 purchase) chicken chop suey could have spent a little bit longer in the wok, though I may like my cabbage on the over-cooked side.

And that old western style Chinese classic pineapple sweet and sour chicken was above average, with a nice mix of veggies and sweet meat, and not-to-thickly battered chicken.

Takeout service was quick, prices are average. Really should be a 2.5...."}
{"text":"The best Chinese food in Calgary. The crispy Cantonese chow mein is incredible. I live in the far NW and have no problem driving across the city to enjoy their food."}
{"text":"Good quiet place and good for family . The service was pretty fast and the sees are friendly.Affordable price and the food is satisfactory."}
{"text":"Had the hot and sour soup and house special chow mien with tea

Soup was not hot (as in spicy), nor was it sour? Tasted like egg drop soup with too much thickener and with added tofu and a mystery meat

Noodles had baby shrimp, BBQ pork and chicken and a no flavor sauce as well???

Wonder if the dumbing down of schezuan for the non-Asian clientele has gone overboard, pass on this one unless you like breaded chicken balls in neon lemon sauce and deep fried egg rolls"}
{"text":"Have been getting delivery from here for about 4 years. 
Always delicious and excellent customer service. 

Recommend the salt & pepper squid. = yum!"}
{"text":"Not sure if this location is affliated with the one off Spiller Road. Was really looking forward to trying this place since the one on Spiller Road is good. Service was good. The staff is friendly but may not be as knowledgable of their food as I had hoped. I had asked the waitress a couple times to confirm a type of noodle that my daughter was hoping for and she had confirmed it was. When the dish came out, it was on shanghai-type noodles. Not what was pictured.. which I kept pointing out to confirm. The dish itself was good but again, not what we ordered. The second dish we ordered was the Deep Fried Wontons... what a joke. They should just call it Deep fried Wonton Wrappers. There was a thin sliver of meat in there.. if I had to guess, they perhaps used a 1/4 teaspoon to scoop meat into each as each wonton had the same amount. I may give this one more go in the future."}
{"text":"I've become so disappointed with Kam Han over the past year that it's driven me here. 

Kam Han used to be my absolute favourite place for Chinese in the city. For years, in fact. Lately, their concern for customer satisfaction has gone straight down the chute. The past several times we've gone, the food has been soggy, flabby, chewy, and overall really unappetizing. Our last encounter, when we weren't in the mood to go out, it took them two hours to deliver to our house 5 minutes away. No apologies, no responsibility, not even the offer of a discount on the food. They simply didn't care, even after two phone calls inquiring about where the order was. Said they'd call us back with the status, and of course never did. When we eventually did get the food, it was lukewarm at best, the squid was about the same as chewing on a tire covered in salt. The driver claimed to not even work for Kam Han and was using a manual credit card form, so you bet we're going to be keeping an eye on our account over the next while. 

Avoid this place if you want a decent meal while being treated like your business is appreciated."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Kam Han for years, and if there's one thing it is is consistent. It's not the best Chinese restaurant in the city, but it's far from the worst. The taste is always decent, albeit not spectacular, but it hits the spot. If I do have one complaint it would be the quantity of food you get. It seems to be less than I remember over the years. With prices slightly higher than they've been, that really does affect the value. They need to get back their mojo as there are better priced and higher quality Chinese restaurants located near by."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been visiting Kam Ham for several years now.
We were there last night again and as always enjoyed the food and the friendly service. We always get the feeling that the staff really are glad to see you. We will continue to go back."}
