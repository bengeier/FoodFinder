{"text":"We had the Basel Duck and it was not bad, it was awful.  I complained but the response was it wasn't their fault.  They refused to make any concessions.  We were charged almost $40 and we didn't eat the duck because it sucked.  Be aware.  There people take no responsibility for serving a bad meal  I will never go back to this place."}
{"text":"Wow! This is the best Thai food I've had since Thailand! The atmosphere is delightful, the servers smile and promptly greet you, and the food is absolutely incredible. Try the panang, yum yum."}
{"text":"My new favorite from this place is their Tom Kra Gai soup... The flavors are amazing! It is just SOOOO good and nothing I could ever replicate at home! Place is a tad pricey so I don't eat there as much as I would like to, but I still get take out about once a month and I have never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"First Thai place I've been to in Arizona.  The place is decently sized compared to other Thai places I've been to.   Looks like a family owned business with the whole family working together.   Ordered their beef salad, pad thai, and thai fried rice.  Figured if those are decent, then we can try other food here next time.  The beef in the beef salad tasted like beef jerky, but the seasoning was good.  I've never had beef jerky salad before. The pad thai was good, but I've had a lot better elsewhere. The thai fried rice was probably the best thing that we had there.    The service was mediocre.  Another family came in after us and ordered after us, but somehow got all their food before us."}
{"text":"This place was awesome. the service was amazing and the food was fantastic. Highly recommend this. We had bbq chicken, spicey fried rice, won ton soup and spring rolls. My wife, 3 kids and I will be coming back next week."}
{"text":"I have been looking for great Thai food, my daughter brought me here.  The drunken noodles are the best I've had!  The vegetables are fresh and firmly cooked, the noodles are perfectly spiced and not too oily, and the chicken is tender.  I can't wait to try the coconut soup, pineapple fried rice and the spicy green beans....excellent menu!"}
{"text":"By far the best Thai I've had in the valley. Sala Thai is a hidden gem. We go often and plan to continue to do so for as long as they are open."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner, ordered Pad Thai, Drunken Noodles and Penang Curry. Worst Pad Thai ever, even the vegetables were raw in the curry. Never again."}
{"text":"I understand the other yelp reviews were based on Westside standards, but lets be honest here: this food is just not good.  I understand that the 623 doesn't have many Thai options, but I would rather drive an extra 15 minutes to an establishment where the food is decent than bear the less than par excuse for Thai food I received here.    Aside from the poor food, the place was dirty.  The menu I received was sticky with food - make the effort to wash down your plastic sheathed menus for sanitation please? With only one other party in the entire place, my food took 25 minutes to come up.  5 people total in an entire restaurant should not have caused such a backup in the kitchen - and I'm used to typical Asian restaurant service.  Don't settle, Westsiders, trust me when I say this place is not legit - once you taste GOOD Thai, you'll know what I'm talking about."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Sala Thai since they added a whole new room of dining, which is saying something! The added seating means there is usually no wait. I'm back to say that I still love it! The basil friend rice wins awards for a reason, people, but the pineapple fried rice is good, too! However, it is very very spicy. Take the 1-5 scale seriously, I air on the wimpy side. My friend had the spicy pumpkin basil, which was pretty good, too. The menu is extensive, and I'm still perusing!  Everything on the menu can be made vegetarian, just request tofu or no meat. I wish they listed this somewhere on the menu instead of shunning you to the tiny vegetarian corner, which doesn't feature anything spectacular. I got the pad thai and found it a little lackluster.   The boba is wonderful, and wonderfully huge. I enjoyed the taro last time!"}
{"text":"Disappointed to find out that today, Mother's Day, is their last business day.  My kids enjoyed the orange chicken.  We enjoyed our entire meal and recommend their customer service.  See you somewhere soon Sala Thai!"}
{"text":"Extensive menu, good service, wonderful flavors... Great place for Thai food in the West Valley."}
{"text":"Got mine to go, quick service.  Spicy basil fried rice: tasty but it had these star shaped carrots that I could've done without. Got number 3 medium spicy, and it was spicier than I expected but I loved it.  Drunken noodle: also had these random star shaped carrots again. Otherwise it was great. Good portions.  Tip: Make sure they give you utensils and chili sauce if you order to go!"}
{"text":"SO GOOD! The pumpkin curry is the bomb. Everything was yummy and so affordable. The portions are great. The atmosphere is quirky but fun. The tank full of fake fish is fun to gaze at."}
{"text":"Are kidding me? TERRIBLE service! I waited for 15 mins. W/O anyone coming to my table! I had to go up and get  my own menu and remind the staff I was waiting. Go to Wild Thaiger or Thai Rama...better food and WAY better service!"}
{"text":"They have just expanded the place.  I have eaten here for years through several owners.  The food is fresh and very flavorful.  The people are delightful.  Having spent some time in Thialand, the food is somewhat Americanized.  Service is fine.  Definatly a hole in the wall type of place, with good food, nice people and very casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went in on a Sunday afternoon for the first time.  I ordered the Drunken Noodles with chicken, and my friend ordered the Pad Thai. We both enjoyed our dishes. I wasn't crazy about the pad thai but loved the Drunken Noodles and would definitely order again. We both also got the coffee frozen drink. (They offer many different flavored \"Mocktails\" and it was very good).   The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the service. It was friendly, but I had to ask for things a couple times before I got them. Not a big deal but the reason why I withheld a star. I would recommend the food and will be back."}
{"text":"Had a horrible experience my very first time eating at this restaurant. To start off, we weren't offered drinks the first time the waitress visited us. I noticed there were no condiments at the table such as salt and pepper shakers, and in order to receive them we had to flag down the waitress and actually get out of the booth just to get soy sauce. I admit the food that I ordered (chicken fried rice) was good but after eating it, I found a light hair in my food. It was actually in my mouth and I had to grossly pull it out. None of us at the table had light hair (we all had black hair or dark hair).   I notified the waitress about the hair and and she offered to get me a new plate of the same dish but honestly I was so disgusted that I didn't want the dish. I asked if we could get the dish taken off the bill and at first the waitress said yes, but then the manager came to our table and had the nerve to say that the hair didn't come from their employees, and insinuated that the hair came from us. I told her that I wasn't going to pay for something that had a long hair in the food. She still refused to take the meal off the tab (which by the way was only $9)  and instead offered us a promotional punch card that would've required us to dine in five times before receiving a $20 gift card of some sort. But I had no intention of coming back to dine there and told her that. She then said that there was nothing else she could do, and wouldn't be giving me back the money that I had paid for the plate with the hair in it. She then said that it was the owner who refused to comp the meal. I had asked to speak to him but apparently it was over the phone, and he wasn't actually in the restaurant.   After going back and forth she then unwillingly took 20% off the bill. I was still unsatisfied with this offer but finally decided to take it because I knew it wasn't going to go anywhere and was fed up with arguing over a silly matter that could have been handled very easily. We then asked for the check to be split as we gave them the money and it took over 10 minutes before we even received our money back. And on top of that, I was supposed to receive $11.60 back as my change and instead only got back $10.   I work in the restaurant industry as well as a server, and always try to be a pleasant customer, but I do know that when a customer is upset with something you're supposed to accommodate their needs.  Needless to say I will never come back to this restaurant. Service was horrible and the way they handle situations is very unprofessional."}
{"text":"Good in a pinch, but nothing to write home about. For very good Thai food, check out Thai-Lana on Indian School."}
{"text":"Been coming here for a couple years.  Curry doesn't disappoint.  I like pumpkin, green, and panang.  Yum"}
{"text":"Good prices! Really liked the crispy eggrolls. The Pad Thai and the pineapple fried rice were pretty good. The Pad Thai had a bit too much sauce for our taste. The Thai iced tea with boba was also pretty good. Will probably return."}
{"text":"So glad to have found great Thai in my neighborhood.  We thought when we moved away from Tempe that we had lost our access to great ethnic food.  Luckily we found this little gem.  Great ambience, friendly quick service, and fantastic food.  We ordered the green curry chicken and the drunken noodles with vegetables.  Great sized portions for reasonable price.  We got ours on a 3 out of 5 scale of heat and it was perfect for us.  I have a feeling we'll become regulars."}
{"text":"I would not even give them a 1 star, but then I wouldn't be able to write this. We saw the reviews on \"Check Please\",  and decided to hit it on the way home from my wife's job. Having a total of 75 years experience between the two of us in the restaurant and hospitality business, we were very disappointed. We contemplated leaving but decided to stay.Arrived Saturday at 6 pm. We checked in for a table, there were 4 open inside. Only waited a couple minutes because they had dirty plates and had to wipe and clean. The hostess brought us to the table and then left. We sat waiting for a server for 18 minutes before anyone acknowledged us. We put a order in for 2 sodas. We didn't receive any beverages that we ordered, including water from the time we satdown, was 38 minutes. When the server did bring soda, she only brought one. Huh? Other diners next to us were seated and brought water for each person. After we finally caught a server, I asked about my soda and she replied that they ranout of clean glasses. Kinda strange because considering the soda and water were the same glasses. When the server finally came to our table, after my my wife went up to tell someone we were ready to order, which was 53 minutes since we were seated, she didn't even mention any of the specials. We decided to order appetizer, food and desert all at once so we could get our food. Watching the front door get filled with a line of people, we noticed a large amount was to go food. The number of To Go Orders had to have come after we were seated. It seemed like the To Go Orders were more important then the customers seated inside. More food To Go was going out then inside. When the server brought food, she only brought chicken skewers. At least we had something. When we tried it, it was cold. Hey we are really trying here. Our food finally arrived. Mine first, then my wife's 5 minutes later. She ordered curry and never received the rice to go along with it. We flagged down a server and she brought the rice. So much confusion. I had the Pahd Thai shrimp with extra shrimp. When meal came, I ate the shrimp, and counted each shell on a plate totally 9 pieces total. Being a big guy and a big eater, if I buy it I will eat it.  I couldn't even eat half of my meal. Something was not right. I had my wife try my dish and she said it was off too, so it wasn't just my taste buds. Not seeing a server in a long time, my wife decided to go up and try and get a soda refill. She did say the owner was nice. We we were finished with meal and waited for our sticky rice which never came so my wife went to check on it. They said 10 minutes which turned into 20 minutes. So sad. The diners next to us who came in 35 minutes after us got check and were out before us. Since server didn't check on us, I asked her for the check. It came 15 minutes later. By the way , my meal was $10 and the 4 pieces of extra shrimp were $9. I should've bought another entree because I would've got noodles too for a $1 more. C'mon, really? All said and done, it was a total of 1 hour and 28 minutes of HELL. 2 Thumbs down. I have never been so disappointed in restaurant ever. And I go out alot. I do Consulting for restaurants for those who ask for help. My advice from sitting 2 tables from restrooms in back is; You need a designated busser. You need food runners. You need a hostess, not a server seating customers. You need a designated Phone / To Go person, not a server who should be taking care of Guest and their food. Your place should have 1 server on one side and one server on other and one for outside. You need to have Cooks make food in order it comes in, not To Go food first. Your Big Impression is for the Guests inside. First timers like Me. Then I will order food To Go next time. For being the size you are, there is to much Chaos. Time Management Problem."}
{"text":"Been here 5 times now and the food has been delicious every time. Some items can be spicy but it's worth the sweat storm.  Love the ribs! Prices are super reasonable. Fish talk needs a bit of cleaning though."}
{"text":"We had takeout tonight.   . My wife had the Pad Thai, and it was tasteless.  I had a cashew with shrimp dish with 6 hotness but it wasn't very hot at all(They have a hotness scale of 1-5, so they should have known I was looking for something very spicy.)  Krua Thai Cuisine restaurant is better."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place after reading the reviews on yelp. I had the beef with brocolli with steamed rice and the beef satay. Their food was delicious and it's probably one of the best that I have had in awhile. I'm very glad that I tried this place out and I will definitely be returning :)."}
{"text":"Good thai food. Once of the better within the area. The thai tea is extremely over sweetened though and I always water it down in half. Everything so far has been good."}
{"text":"Sala Thai is one of my favorite Thai restaurants. Highly recommended. It's a small neighborhood establishment that makes some of the best pumpkin curry around. I also appreciate their 1-5 heat scale. Let me warn you, however, never go above a \"three\" unless you like your Thai food really hot.   In addition to traditional Thai offerings, the menu also contains a few Chinese dishes in case your party is not 100% onboard with Thai. Yes, it's a small restaurant with occasional small restaurant issues, but the presentation of the food is often consistent with a much more expensive destination. And the décor! It's hard to describe. Let's just say it's fun."}
{"text":"So far, my favorite Thai restaurant in Phoenix.  I faced a lot of disappointments and mediocrity before I found Thai Lahna and crowned it my valley favorite, but while I have enjoyed consistently good Thai at Thai Lahna, I have never gotten that glorious rush from eating their food.  The first time I tried anything from Sala Thai, my girlfriend ordered me Green Curry to go after dining there with her mother.  When she requested it Thai Hot, the server politely giggled behind her hand.  That curry was the single spiciest thing I have ever eaten.  I am accustomed to spice, but the girl took one bite and promptly ate two slices of bread to cool her esophagus.  I don't know if the spice dispenser malfunctioned, or they felt like messing with us or what, but it was basically a little cardboard trapezoid of napalm.  Even then, the delicate, sweet, earthy, volcanic flavors of their green curry came through.  A week or so later I found an excuse to try a visit to Sala in person.  I am often crippled by extensive menus, I find myself agonizing over the whole concept of \"But what if one of my all-time favorite dishes is on this menu, but I choose the wrong thing and never come back, and my life is .003% less satisfying...\", and the Sala Thai menu features pictures that make everything look delicious.  Ultimately I chose to go with Spicy Eggplant, which is out of character for me, because in trying any new Thai restaurant, my two defaults to establish a barometer are Green Curry and Pad Thai.  If you get those right, I trust you to do everything else.  So my Spicy Eggplant hits the table...you know those moments when food looks so spectacular that you're almost embarassed to defile it by eating it?  That was the case here, and not because it used fancy technique or elaborate chef-driven painting with sauces, but because the produce was so fresh, and the balance of colors so gorgeous, it essentially became some sort of accidental, outsider pop art.   Or something.  The important part is that it was exquisitely delicious.  The eggplant's texture was silky as it should be, the balance of sweet, savory, earthy and spicy was perfect, the rice was the proper consistency..it was what I want Thai food to be.  I have not been to Thailand, I have no close friends or relatives of Thai descent, I haven't read an encyclopedia of Thai cooking.  I only know that my mouth and belly left pleased as they have been by no other Thai place in town, and that is good enough for me."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst service ever. My food came out a full half hour before the other three folks at the table. so my meal was room temperature by the time my wife got hers. The other two meals crawled out an age later. So stupid! Tasted pleasant but so what!!!??? If I want to eat alone or in front of everyone I will stay home. Yack!"}
{"text":"I've lived in the neighborhood for 11 years and I love Thai food. However, I was reminded why I've stayed away from here for the past three years. I ordered the special today; lettuce wraps with chicken. The lettuce was the best part. The chicken had good flavor, too. But there was barely a quarter cup of it. This dish was mostly comprised of noodles!, large chunks of onion and white button mushroom, and bland tofu. It had a side of three sauces, all loaded with sugar. For a much better Thai lettuce wrap, I highly recommend Pei Wei, believe it or not!"}
{"text":"This place is priceless,.a big rip! I ordered the thai bbq ribs, well,its a cheap steak thrown on a grill wity thai sauce to dip it, i really need a steak knife to cut this steak,all i had ws a butter knife .wht i really needed was a buzz saw,.i would not give this to my dog!!"}
{"text":"We went to Sala Thai for my sisters birthday since she is a big fan of Thai food.  As for myself, i could do without curry, but will try not to let that influence my review.    When we got there, there seemed to be plenty of seating and the waitress seemed quite accommodating.  We ordered a ton of food including Tom Yum soup,pad Thai, pad Sui,  curry chicken, BBQ beef, and pineapple fried rice.  Like I said earlier, I'm not a huge fan of curry but i did try some and I liked it more than I normally do.  I did not however try the Tom Yum soup just because I don't like it in general.  The pad Thai and pad Sui (spelling?) was OK,  but I feel like I've had better.  What I did love however was the pineapple fried rice and BBQ beef.  I could not get enough of it!  I almost finished the entire serving of fried rice by itself.    So to sum up my review, if you are a fan of Thai food, I think you will enjoy it a lot (my sister swears by it and spent a year in Thailand). However,  I'm just not a huge fan of Thai food, and although they do offer a lot of neutral plates (BBQ plates come to mind), their specialty items I find are lacking."}
{"text":"How do you judge a Thai restaurant? You judge them on the simplest dish, i.e. pad Thai! This place could not even get their pad Thai right, as it more like some chewy noodles that were insipid. I don't understand why and how people can rate this place so highly, and all I can say is that I feel sorry for people who have yet to experience good Thai food. I will avoid this place on my trips to Phoenix."}
{"text":"This particular restaurant has changed ownership a few times in the past year (2014) and with each change, there's been quite a significant swing in ambiance, authenticity and food quality.   Honestly, the new owners would have been well served to change the name to avoid confusion.  Anyway, the GOOD news is that new ownership (as of late 2014) has really raised Sala Thai back again to a much better than average Thai-food standard.   The silly idea of strictly Vegan Thai is, thankfully, long gone.    Sala Thai has some great lunch specials.   Good quantity, variety and a great price.   If you really want hot/authentic, tell the server.  Every time I've done so, they've relayed my request back to the kitchen where the Thai cooks went 'native' for me.   Yum.  Finally, I should mention that Sala Thai recently started having a live Thai band on Saturday nights.   I was shocked to see this on my last visit and I can't think of a restaurant outside of Los Angeles that offers it.    I really hope Sala Thai just keeps getting better and better.    Sala Thai is definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"I have driven by this unassuming place many times and always wondered how the food was. My daughter and I had lunch here today and shared an order of crab wontons, cashew chicken, beef ribs and beef with yellow curry.  Everything was really good and there was plenty left over to take home.  We got the spiciest option for the curry and it was delicious.  We will definitely go back and try some other things next time.  The noodle dishes looked very good."}
{"text":"Excellent spicy basil fried rice! I've gotten it twice with extra hot spiciness and it's been awesome! I also tried the chicken dumplings and they were really good. If you ask for some spicy paste they'll bring you 4 different types FOUR! awesome variety. I would recommend it for most people!"}
{"text":"New chef. New fantastic!  Fried rice is amazing, but so was everything else. Must try the peanut sauce which is made fresh from scratch everyday.  The new chef cooks authentic Thai, so be careful of the heat levels.  I normally get 5 hot because I like it spicy,  but because of the new chef I went 4 and glad I did. It was spicy hot and delicious.   My daughter and son in law joined us from Scottsdale and they have a favorite Thai restaurant there, but this was the best they ever had. The decor needs updating,  but the staff is friendly and helpful. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I've only ordered takeout so far, but I love the interior of the place, the food is good and the people there are very friendly!"}
{"text":"This is the first time trying this place and I have to say.... Great food!  This definitely a due over for the family. The Pad Thai has great flavor I would recommended this dish to everyone. Let me start out by saying Thai places are not created equally. This has set the bar to a whole new level. I am giving it 4 stars. The only reason for that is because I just had wished that the waiter would come check on us a little more often to see if we needed water or what not."}
{"text":"I love Sala Thai; the food is really great.  My only problem; the prices went way up and the size of the servings got much smaller!  We've all been in a pinch this year; your food is great but don't run customers off by under-serving.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"Tasty pumpkin shrimp curry, but I didn't like their pad thai that much.  Big fan of everything they fry, and I'm not usually so much for fried food. Their wontons and fried banana dessert with coconut ice cream were crunchy and perfectly formed. Drinks were also great. Prompt service and good prices."}
{"text":"Food was excellent.  Hot and sour soup was amazing.  Waitress was new so need to cut her a break.  Service is normally really good."}
{"text":"Okay, so I've sort of found a Thai restaurant that I like now.  I LOVE Thai food, and have had some great Thai food prior to moving to AZ.  This place has one of the only curries that I have liked here.  The place was a bit funky, totally empty on a Sunday night, and in the usual dead strip mall, but the food was good.  Here is the reason for the missing star,  They didn't have Pra Ram (you know the chicken with spinach and peanut sauce?)  Well, I really like that dish, and can't frequent a place that doesn't serve it.  So when I am craving curry, this is the place I'll go.  When I want some good Pra Ram, it's back to San Francisco....."}
{"text":"Green curry dish was very good, although consistency of the soup was too thin, but maybe is because we order the level 1 of spicy; also ordered fish cakes with sweet Thai sauce with peanuts but I was expecting to enjoy some shrimp cakes, unfortunately they do not carry in their menu."}
{"text":"Yummy!! I highly recommend the curries! Red, yellow, green, we had all 3 today (take-out, ate at home with unexpected dinner guests) and will definitely eat here as regulars. The portions are big enough to share, or not! The ingredients are fresh. The staff is very nice, over the phone and in person. The place is clean and low key, dress up or down, just go there!"}
{"text":"Amazing! So my boyfriend and I found this gem one Sunday afternoon and always crave the food all the time ever sense. We don't get to come often, seeing as though we live far, but it's worth the drive!   The beef salad is to die for, so flavorful! And I love their sticky rice which is sometimes hard to find when going to try a Thai place. Boba isn't Thai, but their variety of boba choices are endless and so yummy. The servers are very friendly and attentive. I have yet to try dessert but I will next time for sure!   Go try Sala for authentic Thai. You can trust me, because I work at a Thai restaurant myself and still go here to eat!"}
{"text":"My favorite Thai restaurant ever! I usually get take-out from here, but have eaten here more than plenty of times! Everyone is always so nice, and the food is always hot and ready in a few minutes. They have never messed up on my order, and everyone is always really sweet when we go eat there, or when I get take out. The food is very authentic, priced very reasonable, and the menu has a HUGE selection of all sorts of Thai food. I love it here!"}
{"text":"Google noted their Saturday and Sunday hours are 11:30 AM, nope they open at 12:00. The day I went (Saturday) they opened at 12:30, over 10 cars in parking lot, people peering in a restaurant with no lights on, funny! Half of them left thinking they shut down. I also left and returned 15 minutes later, staff said they had a rough night of drinking the night before, I understood !  I had the Drunken noodles, Red curry duck, Pork Satay, Pad Thai with Shrimp. Drunken noodles and Red Curry Duck (Awesome) Pad Thai, weird taste, brown sauce just had a strange taste. Visiting Thailand over 25 times, I know my pad thai but this wasn't good. Pork satay had a great taste and nice char but very tough meat.  I feel the prices are high for what you get and it would also be nice to enjoy the meal with a glass of wine or a cold Singha.  I will try this place again."}
{"text":"Strange service, but the red curry is to die for!"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful meal here! We started with two fruit mocktails - pineapple and watermelon.  They were very refreshing, and at $3 apiece, well worth the price to cool some of the spiciness of the food (which was tolerable at a 3).  We had the crab wontons, tom yum, basil duck (which was the special) and spicy basil fried rice with beef. Everything was really great, and priced very moderately. The waiter checked on us consistently and everything about our experience was perfect. From the moment we sat down to the payment of our $45 bill - which is not bad considering how much we ate! GO. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Just had dinner overall ok place solid 3 stars, flavored are not very sophisticated, just moved to the area and decided to try the place. Service was prompt and people were nice. I hope I am not too hard on them but I have had Thai @ other places, with more richer flavors. I may give it another chance and try other dishes. Btw prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"The beef salad was authentic and delicious. Everything I order at this place is amazing. Don't be fooled by the fish curtains this place is the real deal."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Freshest spring rolls ever!! Very authentic dishes & flavor, not for those who did not grow up O.J. fresh Thai!"}
{"text":"Some of the best Tom yum soup I've ever had! Sala Thai catfish is incredible! Got my Thai fix tonight! Plastic fish are fun but I don't know what they feed them...."}
{"text":"I have always gotten very fresh, flavorful food from Sala Thai. I love their green curry, tofu dishes, and various beef dishes. They have actual Thai Spring rolls which are so healthy for people and so cool and refreshing in the summer. Better than greasy fried sticks! The sauce for the rolls is also very nice with a good peanut base. The soups are very good too and while a bit expensive, they are enough for two people, even three.  I've always gotten take out and the people have always been very friendly and sweet. I enjoy fresh vegetables and the freshness of the ingredients. It's a place I will continue to frequent."}
{"text":"Tom Kra Gai = great.  Plus, the fake fish in the fish tank provide never-ending entertainment."}
{"text":"This place was horrible.  Check the food administration website for health code violations before you go.  I thought I should have made a 360 right out of there when I saw the plastic floating fish.  Disgusting food and poor excuse for Thai food."}
{"text":"Got a $60 to go order for the fam. Asked for lowest level of spicy (\"1\") so we could add heat individually at home if we wanted to. The food was fire! Like a 4. Not cool. (Literally). Food wasn't that great either, better Thai places around. Obviously won't be going back."}
{"text":"Tom Kha soup is the star here. A small (half) order is more than enough for a meal; you have to ask for half order, it's not on the menu. Super flavors. Not knowing the portion size, I ordered the green curry chicken, too. I love spicy, and ordered it the hottest they offered. I was disappointed that it was still fairly mild for five chili pepper rating. It's worth the trip - authentic place."}
{"text":"Our upper office meeting was held at Sala Thai yesterday.  Most of us eat out a lot because we are mobile and are meeting clients. So we are a particular bunch. This place is owned and run by an actual Thai family who visit Thailand and their family there.  The help are Thai and the food is authentic although as all foodies understand  versions of dishes vary by regions and by the chef/cook crafting each dish.   If every chefs/restaurants dish tasted the same life would be boring!!       The Curry is exceptional no matter what type, the usual dishes we enjoy are always freshly cooked.    The owners will not serve my favorite Mango with Sticky rice (heaven) unless just the right mangos are available.I also get carry out from here several times a month and am always pleased.   Their lemon chicken soup drives away my colds.   The ice cream they make fresh with coconut milk is wonderful.  This is usually a peaceful, low noise get away with a large clientele.  As for those that want alcohol , most of us go to have amazing food---- several bars are close if you need alcohol."}
{"text":"So I was born in Bangkok and lived there till I was seven, I may have forgotten my Thai language, but the flavors and foods are seared into me forever.  There is something that most Americans don't really understand about Thai food.  Everyone has their own take on recipes.  American food was like that at one point as well... thank goodness we still have our differences in BBQ styles...  anyway the point is what makes one Thai restaurant better than another is mostly preference, not authenticity.  That being said, Sala Thai's cuisine is the closest thing I have found to the delightful flavors of my youth.  There flavor's are all spot on and exactly the way they should be.  There ingredients are great quality (Where do they find kale that sweet!?!?) and make the food that much better.  There Prices are ridiculously low!  What is not to like about this place?  What you will get if you dine here; Friendly service (they are Thai, I don't think they know how to not be friendly), Excellent food (flavor and quality), at the best prices!  What you wont get; Anything Fancy, and you shouldn't Thai food is enough in and of itself!  Anyways check it out you wont be disappointed.  If it is to far West for you can check out Swaddee, though it is more expensive..   *edit*  The food is still great but the prices have gone up to the point where it isn't the same killer value it once was... still, great Thai food."}
{"text":"This was so great and local! The food was creative and fantastic and very authentic and the prices very very reasonable. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent!!! Yellow chicken curry and drunken noodles are amazing!!"}
{"text":"Wow, SO yummy!!  I'm here for lunch and eating the pumpkin curry with chicken at a level 4 spicy. I can taste so many lovely flavors and out has great spice too!!    My friend is having the phad see we, and he's been to Thailand many times, he's loving it too!  He thinks it's one of the best he's had anywhere!  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Consistently good although sometimes a little slow when they are busy on Friday and Saturday nights. Weeknights and lunch are better. We like the yellow curry, chicken satay and Thai Iced Tea. The noodle dishes are good too. When we go out for Thai, we prefer Sala Thai over any other Thai food we've tried in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Our go-to Thai restaurant. Love the food and the staff is always friendly. We usually get one of their curries (all are delicious) and the pineapple fried rice. The vegetable rolls are also delicious. Glad to have this place around the corner!"}
{"text":"Good food like the chicken chow mein. Go for more spicy than you are use to. Com paired to others there spicy is a little milder."}
{"text":"The 2 of us went to Sala Thai last night and expected so much better based on these reviews on yelp. We looked at the menu on line and knew the prices were high and thought they must be good at those prices.   Ok the Thai Tea will get a high rating for sure.  The place was busy. The booth seating was comfortable and the fish tank with the plastic fish was interesting. The hangings on the walls were pretty.  But the reason we were here was to try a different Thai Restaurant. Once we ordered our food it came out too fast. It must have already been cooked. The Beef Panang had no flavor and the sauce was too thin.  The beef in it was tough and had stringy bits as well. The toughness made me think microwave. But I have no fact about that. The broccoli floating in the Panang sauce tasted good. The Pad Thai seemed to be a glued tangled mess of various size noodles. It was loaded with fried egg. No flavor.  The Stuffed angel wings were huge and not sure what the stuffing was as we couldn't identify it.  A bit of a freezer taste. Hot on outside but not warm in the middle. The cover up flavor came from the sweet chili sauce we poured over it. We had to ask for more sauce.  No one ever came to see how our food was until the end when they brought the check. Yet we were still eating or trying to when they brought the check.  We left so much food on our plates and paid $37.00 and left. We have been eating Thai Food for over 25 years in the Valley and do have our favorite places. However , living  North of the main city, there are not a lot of Thai Restaurants to choose from. We have to make a 35 minute drive to get to one. We will not return to Sala.  We will not go back there."}
{"text":"We are regular visitor to sala Thai..excellent food and service...Red curry is best here...."}
{"text":"I gave this place a couple of chances, because the Chinese restaurant which used to be in this location was quite good and I felt some nostalgia in coming here  (I know:  makes no sense; but then again, I rarely do).  This is a SAD excuse for a Thai restaurant.  Here are some of my \"issues\":  1.  Dry chicken and pork dishes;  2.  Inattentive or incorrect service from both the \"family\" staff and part-time students, who come and go about as often as you change your underwear (I hope);  3. Staff spends more time taking phone-in orders and dealing with walk-in take out orders than they do with customers eating here.  Though they DO take the time out to sing old, unliked songs from the 70s and 80s up on their karaoke stage with the volume turned up extra high to distract you from the crappy food;  4.  Cleanliness at the tables is subpar;  5.  More than once, the bill has been \"inadvertently\" miscalculated (and one time, had things on it they never brought to the table).  It doesn't help to complain as management makes clear in half-hearted apologies and mumbling, that it's your fault, white Devil, for not appreciating Asian culture and unreasonably expecting good service.  Spare your taste buds, your wallet and your ears (especially) and go to the other good Thai places in the West Valley.  Buddha will thank you for it"}
{"text":"Very good food. very authentic. one of the best Thai food I've ever had.  Must try this place"}
{"text":"Drunken Noodle with Beef, 5 hot!!!!! Pad Thai at a 4 woo Hoo!!! This is the best Thai food I have found in PHX, thank you!!"}
{"text":"SALA THAI....I just moved here from L.A. where there are dozens of Thai restaurants competing for cheapest lunch and best tasting Thai food. First time I came here the food was pretty greasy. 2nd time the service was  indifferent and snooty. 3rd time was the last time....terrible greasy garlic chicken. People that come here are white people that don't have any concept of the differences in races or nationalities or the kinds of food that makes ethnic food what it is or how it is supposed to taste People that come here are not worldly or not well travelled. Too bad....you've lost a customer. The food is overpriced for what you get."}
{"text":"Sadly, I'll probably never eat here again. My wife and I used to order curry dishes from here regularly, but hadn't for a while because it was never consistent. Half the time it was great, but the rest of the time it was watered down. After deciding to give them one more chance tonight, I was grossly disappointed. My panang curry was so bland that it literally tasted like chicken in nothing but water with cayenne flakes."}
{"text":"Having dinner here with my kids this time was still a treat. The portions are a little small for the price. But every dish has been great. Tom Yum is a must. The Basil Fried Rice is then other must have when we come. The only thing keeping my 5th star is the portion size. Not the typical family size dish for sharing.   Highly recommended Thai in PHX!"}
{"text":"Great family run independent business. The food is expertly prepared and properly seasoned per your request. Delicious and served with pride. The only negative is that they don't serve beer."}
{"text":"Was very disappointed with the quality of food. It seems they changed owners or cook,  I use to come here before and the food was good, I brought people and the food was very poor. I ordered Tom Yum soup,  very little, but I mean very little shrimp,  and the flavor was not that good. I also ordered Pad Thai, noodles where very over cooked, and the servings where smaller. Need better presentation on both dishes,  the restaurant was empty,  booths where not that comfortable,  and needed more lighting. Hope this restaurant improves."}
{"text":"I have ordered take out from this place many, many (hungover) times. Never disappoints me!! I always order pad thai and they cook everything perfectly and with the right amount of specified spicy (3 on a scale of 5.)  I have recommended this place to my brother who has also tried it out and liked it, as well as other family members. Food is always ready for picking up according to the time they tell me on the phone- nothing but great things to say!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, the staff was sweet. I wish I lived closer. I loved the soup and the pad Thai, and so did my wife!"}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place.  Thankfully we live only a few blocks away. We order out  once a week, yum. It does get busy, so I try to time my order before 6pm. I like the fact that they are so calm, even when they are super busy."}
{"text":"First time going to Sala Thai. Worst experience and will not return. I've been to a lot of Thai restaurants and so figured I'd give this one a try. Definitely will not go back. We were one table of 6 with 2 other tables in the restaurant. The service was very poor. Took 30 minutes to get our drink & food order in, another 50 minutes to get our food. Boyfriend's fried fish plate, once he bit into it, had completely raw fish inside. He asked for a new dish. 20 minutes later they still had not informed us about the whereabouts of his dish. Was his birthday meal and since everyone was about done we asked where his dish was and the server told us \"Oh, they are just about to make it\". We then decided to cancel dish since the meal experience was over. They did not take the dish off of the final check and we had to ask them to remove it bc he didn't get to eat his meal at all nor would it have been with the rest of the family by the time it would have been brought out. Needless to say that the hassle that came along with the meal could have been avoided. Would not recommend if you have a table of 4 or more."}
{"text":"This place is sooooo yummy! They have an excellent menu choice with almost every Thai dish you can think of! My favorites include their Pad Thai, Fish Cakes, Shrimp Rolls, Seafood Soup and Fried Bananas with homemade Coconut Ice Cream!! Did I mention they also have BOBA?!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years but won't be any more after a bad pickup experience. I ordered #4  spicy (1-5 scale) red curry and pineapple fried rice. The curry tasted very bland, like key ingredients were missing and was not spicy at all. The fried rice was also off and was not good. I called them to let them know and they just said they don't fix orders unless items are mixed up. Customer service is definitely lacking, I won't be giving them another shot after this. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"This place is pretty solid.  The prices are reasonable and the food is really good.  Warning, they give you a spice level of 1 to 5.  I like it spicy so i chose a 4.  It was extremely spicy.  Next time I will probably scale down to a 2.  I had the veggie egg rolls and drunken noodles.  They were really good.  I ordered some Thai Ice tea to wash down the food, cause it was spicy.  Overall solid experience, the spiciness was my fault for ordering it that hot, but the taste of the food was solid.  I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"The food was excellent.  Each entrée had its own unique flavor.  Recommend the Basil Thai and the coconut pineapple ice cream was amazing!"}
{"text":"I love the food, but the service is been terrible lately especially carry out. I called in an order they said 15-20 minutes. We showed up at 30 minutes and they said ten more minutes. I sat and waited as they were really busy. Almost 30 more minutes and asking multiple times the order was ready. They didn't really seem apologetic. Not sure what is going on, but makes me think twice about coming back."}
{"text":"Ordered vegetarian pad thai to go. Serving size is good. Lots of vegetables, which I love, and you dont always find at other places. But the sauce is terrible. It's not traditional pad thai like I get pretty much everywhere else. I eat a lot of asian food, and lately, a lot of thai. Been to about 5 different places in the past week alone, and this pad thai dish was absolutely the worst. Maybe their other food is better, but steer clear of the vegetarian pad thai."}
{"text":"The food is very good.  However, both their portion sizes and their customer service sucks.  Two times our to go order is wrong.  Either my vegetarian husband gets meat in his meal or I get tofu in mine and I wanted chicken.  Sick of constantly having it wrong - or having one dish get cold while we make a second trip to get the other corrected. Also,  noodle dishes don't even full half the box.   Staff is rude...won't do anything for the mistake.  If you order,  be sure to check everything before you leave!!"}
{"text":"Ordered red curry with pork and shrimp. Ingredients were fresh and tasty, but portion was somewhat skimpy for the price and the dish itself was uninspired (only a couple slices of bell pepper accompanied the meat). Both problems could be solved by adding some Asian vegetables to the mix at negligible cost. What really disappointed was the rice. It stuck together so badly, they could have sweetened it and called it a \"Sticky Rice\" dessert! Seriously, it was like the example of bad rice that sticks together on the Minute Rice TV commercial. Also, someone should tell them using plastic fish in an aquarium is tastelessly tacky. Either get real fish or get rid of the tank."}
{"text":"I came with a group of five including 5 year old twins  We ordered a variety of things including egg rolls, spring rolls, vegetable pad thai, masala curry, pumpkin curry, and chow mein.  The pad thai was the worst I have ever had.  It was mushy and had a weird tomato base flavor.  How do you mess up pad thai?! I actually sent it back to order the chow mein to keep things simple. The waitresses on staff that evening seemed inexperienced.  I really did not like the food. The best thing we had was the masala curry.  Oh the kids loved the mocktails!  My cousins frequent this establishment often and they were also disappointed with the service. Maybe it was an \"off\" day, but I will not be back"}
{"text":"They just came out with a new vegan menu along with the regular menu and it was amazing! We tried the spicy noodles and the jungle noodles and they were both perfect! I've always loved going to this place, and with the new vegan menu and so many options, I'm excited to come back and try everything!"}
{"text":"The best THAI food in Phoenix! Price a bit on the high side  though considering this is just a small eatery. Their menu is both expansive and expensive.  Anyways, the good news is their food is GOOD! i am speechless.......nothing at all to say cuz my stomach is still FULL! kudos to their chef!"}
{"text":"Had pad ti with beef #4 spicy . Nice heat. Normal crap puffs. Very filling. Also ordered drunken chicken heat 3 ."}
{"text":"I'm not gonna claim to be the professional on thai food but this place was delicious! The price was right, the room nice, and employees friendly."}
{"text":"Curried tofu can cure any ailment. This also includes hangovers, a touch of the flu, and broken hearts.   With that said, I liked this  little place. I was in town for an event, and craved food not found in a drive-thru or the company of chains. I was not disappointed by Sala.  Generous portions, pleasant ambiance, and the food was wonderfully spiced. I'd definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"On my quest to find acceptable ethnic dishes in my new neighborhood , I came across this restaurant while searching yelp for a decent Thai place. (Please keep in mind, I'm a bit of a Thai food addict, being from NYC and all).  We ordered an assortment of dishes for takeout one night (Pad Thai, Spring Rolls, Wings, and Ginger Beef), all of which was tasty and hot.  Would definitely come back and eat in, or order take out from again."}
{"text":"Not the best Thai food I've had ( the best Thai food I've ever had was in Maui, and it was being cooked out of someone's back yard and sold on the side of the street) but it's pretty good.    I've had their coconut milk soup, pad thai, pad see ew, basil fried rice, green papaya salad, green curry, panang curry and garlic chicken.  All of these are good, although the basil fried rice is a bit too moist and garlic chicken a bit salty for my taste.  Like most other Thai places, the spice level is 1 thru 5 stars.   If you like a good kick, I would say go with 4 stars.  If you like super spicy, skip 5 stars and ask for \"thai hot.\"  I'm a very observant person and to be honest, the many times I've eaten here, I noticed the crowd and they're the type to care about \"ambiance\" and service rather than the actual food.  For me, it's about how good the food is, then I factor in the service and all that stuff.    The service here isn't exactly top notch.  If you're one of those who care about being asked about how you're doing every 10 minutes, then don't come here.    Overall, for the prices and location and quality of food, this place is really good.  I haven't had a dish where I was like, ew!"}
{"text":"Food here was good, but I prefer to have a little more sauce/oil with my noodles.  The flavors were good, but there was so little sauce in our pad se ew, that it was almost dry.  The Pad Ka (coconut lemon grass soup) was tasty, but there was no option to have a small bowl of soup, just a huge $10 serving.  It was a little thin though, not sure if that's cost cutting watering it down, or just they way they make their soup.  Service was fast though and restaurant was clean."}
{"text":"Pad Thai! Been going here for years, although not often enough in the past 5 years since we moved up north around Desert Ridge.   I will warn you, the service and food delivery is SLOW. So, don't come here if you are in a hurry."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and usually it's much better...in fact, I rave about their veggie Pad Thai and coconut soup.  But I went last night and my order wasn't what I was used to.  My Pad Thai was lacking much flavor, strangely sweet, and it didn't come w the peanuts or lemon (they usually serve w lemon).  It definitely needed the missing crunch and acidity!!  The coconut soup was as good as ever!  We also order orange chicken, but were served orange shrimp...not bad, just not what we were expecting.    Overall, I will definitely go back but a little disappointed w last night's showing"}
{"text":"I have been to Sala Thai many many times. They have always provided wonderful service with exceptional food. Keep in mind, this restaurant is a family owned business; therefore, it has the charm and friendliness of that familial feel. I love the personalities of the staff  and the décor of this restaurant. The staff here are very considerate and pays close attention to your needs as a customer.    Remember they know how Thai food is done. This isn't some corporate chain business or formulated menu that they factory out; the food here tastes AUTHENTIC. Each dish is uniquely created with the appropriate flair of the Thai culture.   I have never had issues communicating or expressing what I want or would like with the staff.   I ordered the tom yum, green curry, fried catfish, phad thai, drunken noodles and even a few of their desserts before. These dishes are all magical.  The tom yum was just the right sour flavor and the herbs really bring out the aroma of this dish. I highly suggest starting off with this savory soup.  Drunken noodles has to be one of my favorites at this restaurant. You can never go wrong with this choice as it brings a variant burst of aromatic flavors. If I order really high level spicy food, I always order a thai tea to go with it. Fun Fact: The milky flavors of this sweet and refreshing beverage actually conteracts the spice flavors. Another great way to enjoy this cuisine; why not blend the flavors?  I can honestly say I will continue to come back again and again; I will even bring friends as I have in the past. Sala Thai has won me over with their delicious authentic dishes, friendly staff and charming atmosphere.   OH and they do take out too!"}
{"text":"Sala Thai has a really good lunch menu for $8.99 which comes with your entree, salad, egg roll and tom yum soup! They have a variety of options to choose from the entree list which ranges from different noodle dishes to fried rice or even curry. The salad (very small portion) comes with a peanut sauce which is ok. If you have never had it before it has a sweet peanut taste.   For entrees my family ordered: pad thai, pad sai ew, yellow curry and panang curry. Overall we were all satisfied with our orders. The pad saw ew (thick noodles) were my favorite.The pad thai was good too and it has a strong peanut flavoring! The 2 curries were really good and they both have a strong coconut taste to it! If you like coconut flavor then I would recommend you to order the panang curry because the taste was stronger! We ordered all the dishes on a level 3 spicy which was just right for us!  The reason why I am only giving it 4 stars out of 5 is because their thai tea was not up to par. I felt that they did not have enough of the tea flavor in it! However the food was excellent! So if you guys are ever in the area, I would definitely recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Seriously good curry. Serious. I'm not joking. I'm serious, the curry is very good. Usually when a restaurant has pictures of the food on the menu I become suspicious (think of Denny's and Village Inn), but here the photographs are not indicative of anything bad. In fact, the food looks good. Did I mention the curry is really good."}
{"text":"After having take out from Sala Thai a few times, I can say that the quality of food is hit and miss. Staples such as egg rolls and pad thai are just simply disappointing. The eggs rolls are bland and their pad thai lacks the rich flavor that other thai restaurants serve. On the other hand, their curry and fried rice were quite good. Their take out service seems quite popular and as an apparent consequence, take out orders take longer compared to other restaurants. On the plus side, their prices are quite reasonable."}
{"text":"Not so good. They''ve expanded their dining area but the food is still mediocre at best for Thai food.  But then I'm spoiled I lived in Thailand for 8 months. Ok I ve been back and the food was tremendous I not sure maybe I had an off night last time. Awesome flavors, authentic spices. I highly recommend Sala Thai."}
{"text":"I really like the decor, the food is excellent, friendly staff, prices about $1 more then most places but worth it! One of the best Thai food restaurants in the west valley!"}
{"text":"They did have the best Chicken Fried Rice ever eaten, but now everytime I go back, its made differently.  Not as pleased as once before.  I wish they would just keep the old recipe.  I have never had Fried Rice with cooked tomatoes in it either...that was a first..."}
{"text":"This place is definitely quite a ways outside downtown Phoenix.  The place is pretty small and does not accommodate large parties, but they adjusted the seating for us.  Some of the dishes we ordered were the beef larb, tom yum seafood soup, curry shrimp, curry chicken, a chicken noodle dish and another seafood dish.  All were pretty average and nothing to rave about.  They did have quite a variety of blended drinks and the coconut banana was pretty good.  The banana flavor was strong taking away from the coconut."}
{"text":"The best Thai food I've had here so far!!  I tried the Pa-nang curry which was amazing!"}
{"text":"his is probably the worst dining experience I have had in years. Friend wanted to try this restraunt as was close.  Their version of Thai  food is at best described as horrible... I guess they call it modern Thai. I'd rather eat at McDonald's. &   service was nonexistent, we arrived at t:15 & finally got done at 7. Good luck on refills on your drinks.  If the want bad good & lousy service this is the restraunt for you"}
{"text":"The only dish we liked was Panang curry wich was ok and not perfect. We ordered Pad thai and Thai bbq chicken which was not at all good to taste. Thai coffee was good. Thai fish cake was another disaster better not to order again. I am not sure if i will go again to this place but if i go, i will try green curry or thai fried rice and will then update my review."}
{"text":"I usually get the Pad Thai and spring rolls. The soups are fantastic and quite authentic but are huge portions. Not the prettiest setting but definitely some of the more authentic Thai food in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"The little cute place got pretty ok food. I don't like how they served us. The waiter literally put the plate on the end of the table, instead of being in front of us. Also, I don't like their Pad Thai"}
{"text":"The worst! Food and service are pathetic. Watery curry which finally came 20 minutes after the rest of my table, so I took it to go. Probably wouldn't feed it to my dogs."}
{"text":"A very good Thai restaurant for a large selection of tasty dishes. Easily the best Thai food we've had anywhere on the West side of Phoenix. I'm glad this place is nearby and this was my 4th time over the last 6 weeks. They have the best Thai Iced Tea in AZ."}
{"text":"Considering the West side of town doesn't have a whole lot of Thai places to chooose from, this place is pretty awesome.  Comparatively speaking to all the Thai places I've been to, I would have given it 3.25 stars.  We got their pad na, pumpkin curry, and pineapple fried rice.  I would say the taste is comprable to to other decent Thai places I've been to in the past.  I'll definitely be looking forward to going again in the future!  A friend took us there and they even mentioned that there's karaoke night.  It would be awesome to check that out one evening!"}
{"text":"This place is beyond delicious. Their mock tails are actually exactly like those boba bubble tea drinks and I can not get enough! There curries are good, egg rolls, everything I've tried was amazingly authentic. The only thing is I wish they delivered. Then it would be the perfect restaurant."}
{"text":"I just had my second experience with this place- both were on to go orders. First time I got the Tom Kra Gai and was pleased with it. Today I got the wonton soup and Panang beef curry. Both were good but the wonton soup was sooo good! The broth was excellent and it was not lacking in veggies or in the number of wontons they put in there! I was very pleasantly surprised. I walked in 10 minutes prior to them re-opening for dinner and was still greeted with kindness and was able to place my order right away. The young man at the counter (the owner's nephew) was so friendly and helpful in answering my handful of questions. I received above average service for sure. My food was out in a matter of 10 minutes max. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"This is decent Thai food... I really went with the intent to get a Thai Tea.  Mission Accomplished on that front.  But the food is good, not the best or the worst.  They do serve large portions for the price.  There were only a few tables occupied when I had lunch there, and they all seemed please."}
{"text":"This place is excellent on every level! Service, environment, cleanliness and most importantly....FOOD! The portions are fair to the pricing and everything has been cooked perfectly!  Last time was yellow curry with shrimp...Delicious! This time was onions and mushrooms in oyster sauce with duck...amazing!! Hubby had the asparagus with beef...he killed it! We also tried the potstickers with pork...handmade, delicate and flavorful with sauce that put them over the top!  If you like Thai food, you must come here!!!  I don't have a single negative thing to say about it!!!"}
{"text":"Sala Thai is a solid choice for Thai food in the west valley where we don't have all that many options. I have only ever ordered take out so I can't comment on the service, but the food is basically always good. We usually get the beef satay (good, a bit dry, but awesome peanut sauce), yellow curry medium heat (which is still fairly mild, but a family favorite) and pad Thai. The pad Thai is good, though I will agree with some of the other reviewers that occasionally the noodles are overdone. For those that find it too sweet I suggest requesting a heat level, as they are typically able to accommodate. The one thing we have ordered that basically got tossed in the trash was the pineapple fried rice. It sounded so good but had a strange, kind of spoiled flavor to it. Also I would not recommend dining in if you are sensitive to smells. It seems they have a problem with their sewage and it tends to smell a bit septic in their dining room. But they have an A food grade, so we don't let it scare us from ordering takeout! If you're way out in the west valley, Sala Thai is a solid (If not your only) choice for Thai food!"}
{"text":"The food was awesome..the service, not so much. I love Pad Thai & the pad Thai here was the best I have ever had!! There is only one server here & she doesn't even check on the customers. I had to repeatedly raise my hand to get her attention & she never came so I got up to go and get the take out containers that I needed, I'll return for the food, but I would have to put up with the bad service."}
{"text":"I have struggled to find good Thai food in the valley and this place is for real! The flavor and spice is all there! I am always drawn to the pumpkin curry! Chunks of pumpkin so different and tasty. The staff is very friendly. Prices are reasonable! Great option for good Thai food in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Picked up dinner consisting of masuman curry, drunken noodles and pad thai.    The food was not the same as our other visits.  Rather than the very good experience the food was mediocre at best.  The masuman curry was not even close to previous efforts.  Frankly I could recognize it was curry but not strictly masuman curry.  The Paid Thai was also off from their usual effort.  As if the Pad Thai sauce was the one I get in a bottle from the Asian market.  Could have been an  off night."}
{"text":"I would not normally Yelp but in this case I feel that I would be doing the owner a disservice. We arrived at 11am when the restaurant is suppose to open. The security gates were still on the windows and the server did not acknowledge that we were standing outside. We waited patiently until 11:06 when she opened the door and I asked her if the restaurant was open and she mentioned that she goes to school and can't get here by 11. We walked in and she said we could sit anywhere she then proceeded to put the gates away and set up all the tables and chairs outside and inside before she greeted us finally at 11:16. It would have been nice if she would have said one moment I'm just trying to get the restaurant open I apologize for the wait. The food was great!"}
{"text":"Best thai food on the west side. The curries are awesome. Friendly service too."}
{"text":"Not being used to this type of cuisine, I couldn't tell ya if it's authentic or not.  But I did find the Thai Iced tea to be pretty good.  spring roll were rather tasty.  deep fried vegetables were interesting.  the chicken satay was rather good especially if you like peanuts.  I wasn't that into pad thai noodles, but I will definitely be back to try a curry."}
{"text":"Food was hot, salty, and tasted ok, but I am assuming they use massive amounts of msg as it made both of us sick. Service was mediocre."}
{"text":"REally really good.  I had the Ginger Tofu dish ad it was amazing.  The place has the look and feel of a specialty restaurant run by a signature chef.  It's really a hidden secret, nestled in the back of a nondescript strip mall.  Don't let the surroundings fool you, this place is well well worth it."}
{"text":"Best Thai in the Valley! I usually order the Tom kra gai! All the curries are fragrant thick and lovely. Also the spring rolls are perfection!"}
{"text":"We ordered 2 of my favorite dishes, panang curry with beef and the tom kra gai (coconut milk soup with chicken). They were both very good, I would go back again. We ordered medium and it was not as spicy as I like it so next time I might go with hot. The rice bowl was very small and we had to ask for for, but no big deal.  The restaurant itself is nice and clean and can't wait to try other menu items!"}
{"text":"Although the food was delicious the service here was absolutely terrible. Waited about 10 min to get water. Another 20 min to place our order ( mind you they were nowhere near busy) . Staff only came by once to check and see how we're doing. Again the food was great but that doesn't make up for horrible service and count me out on coming back to this place."}
{"text":"*This is a review for PAD THAI ONLY!*  I love Pad Thai, I searched for about 30 min on yelp to find a good Pad Thai place.  I had 3 in mind and they were all pretty close by including this one, but since I wanted to go, I chose this place since it was closest to the highway.  Honestly, the Pad Thai was little disappointing. I'm sure their other foods are great, but probably not the Pad Thai. I'm no expert or a Pad Thai snob, but out of all the ones I had, this might be my worst (or second worst) Pad Thai I've ever had.   The noodles were overcooked, and I was expecting more green onions, but they were only few short ones lying around. They charged 3 extra dollars for 5 fairly good size of shrimps, which wasn't too bad.  They did put a reasonable amount of bean sprouts and slides of carrots, so that was good.  Also, they put a good amount of peanuts (I think it was peanuts), but I chopped up some roasted salted almonds at home and added them for extra taste, which made it little better.  The sauce wasn't too bad, but it would've been better if it was little spicy and saucier (not salty). It was little too bland for me. It almost feels like eating a top ramen at a ramen place, and thinking that I could've just made it at home.  This would be more like a sad Pad Thai that I would probably reuse the leftover to add more stuff or even make spring rolls out of it.  I'm sure the service is good and all, and I have not tried other food since I normally just go for the Pad Thai. And please remember this is a review just for the Pad Thai.  It looked like a family owned place, and I wish and hope the best for them. If you're owner or worker who works there reading this, please .. save the Pad Thai #RIP #PadThai Thank you."}
{"text":"i am very sad to see this place closed . If any one knows where the owners went that would be great . The Tom Yum was the best I  have eaten in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I had been going here for awhile and the food is tasty. I'm not sure recently if there was a change in management, and just experienced the most horrible customer service today and will never go back again. This is why: 1) I walked in waiting by the door to be seated. The guy host was in range to see people coming in, but stood there obliviously. Then he walked off into the back, and then came back out walking to another booth to chat. Then walked back to the counter, never came up to the door to acknowledge us.  2) I was irritated and walked 10 ft across to the back counter, and he then disappeared to the back kitchen area again. I stood there waiting, and he came out. Never greeted me, and gave me a look of confusion. I asked him if I can finally get a seat for two. He just points across, \"Well, you can take that one there or the one over there.\" (Ok, thanks for seating me!) So we went over and seated ourselves and he finally came to the table to bring us menus.  3) After skimming through our menus, we closed it and put it to the side of the table ready to order. The same guy standing at the bar counter walked past us and back to chat with that same table he had been occupied with after taking the check from the booth behind us. 10 mins past, finally a woman came to take our order.  4) Nobody ever came to check on us, and that guy was still occupied with that same table, or chatting and \"cleaning\" the empty booth by that table. A family came in, seated themselves at an empty booth closest to the entrance and sat waiting for menus. We were done eating and waited another 15 mins to get a check. As we waited, I see the guy back standing at the bar area.The family who sat themselves sent their kid to the bar counter and he told the guy \"We are waiting over there\" He then walks back to that table he had bee chatting with then disappeared to the back kitchen. The woman got upset and stood up telling her mom, \"let's go, I don't know where that guy went and they are taking to long.\"  5) The guy comes out and walked up to finally asked if we would like our check.  Their service use to be good when I was last there 2 months ago and before that. Not anymore! ."}
{"text":"The best thai on the west side of town! Each and every dish is amazing (i love the noodle dishes). Be sure to check out their lunch specials!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! If you go for lunch, make sure to get one of the lunch specials! $7.99 gets you a heaping portion of one of the select main dishes, salad with peanut sauce dressing, an egg roll with sweet chili dipping sauce and a soup. The only thing I will warn about is the spice level--all 3 of us asked for medium spice level on our dishes but they were vey spicy, I recommend dropping down a level just in case. You cannot beat it here! It's very cute and well decorated as well."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant for lunch. The service was good with friendly staff but slow. The food - my kids had Pad See Ew which was a small portion, too much other stuff like veges or meat but not enough noodles. My curry was good but every bite of the pork had gristle or chewy fat and it turned me off for eating more. Captain rolls were great. Overall, it is a decent place to eat Thai food but it wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"Unassuming little restaurant from the outside, but lovely and traditional inside. Wonderful food, great service, nice atmosphere. Had the fish cakes,  cream puffs and the beef mussuman.  All were perfect.  Quick tip if you're from southeast Asia or Australia: ask for at least 4 out of 5 on the spicy scale.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This is the best thai food I have found in the valley.  We had drunken noodles, yellow curry, and the tom kra gai soup. Everything was excellent. Thai iced tea was also delicious. All the ingredients tasted fresh and everything was cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"The food here was nicely presented and yummy. Came in and got seated right away. Service wasnt bad they refilled my water and checked on me a couple times. The panang curry was nice just wish i ordered it more spicy. I love spicy foods. The thai tea was good. Pad thai is delish i always ask for extra sauce cause i like my noodles drenched in sauce. Cant wait to go back"}
{"text":"Another 3.5-er.  I'll make this quick since football's on:  ~ Basil fried rice - great ~ Spring rolls - average ~ Papaya salad - great ~ Red curry chicken - good ~ Chicken tom yum soup - good  ~ Drunken noodles with beef - great ~ Mocktails: we had one of each - mango, banana and pineapple banana.  The mango was the best.  There's no alcohol at this establishment, btw.  What good is a restaurant w/o alcohol?!"}
{"text":"Best Thai In North Phoenix Our family ate at Sala Thai this evening for the first time. We have been to a number of Thai restaurants in the Valley......this is one of the best. Food is flavorful, spice it as you like, and the service was superb. Spring rolls were great, followed a wonderful soup (Tom Kra  Gai), and Thai BBQ......everything was perfect. Finished off with Fried Bananas served with homemade Coconut ice cream. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to get tasty Thai Food in NE PHX. Normally come here on the weekends and bring the family and kids. Food is always good and the service is quick and friendly. Best of New Times.  Inside is both fun and inviting with some really comfortable booths. One is right next to a very cool looking fish tank with a lot of eye catching activity. Those crazy little critters are really flying and bouncing all over the place. The wife has to remind me that they are plastic fish and not to get too excited. Ha!  Nice selection of all your Thai restaurant favorites and more. They even have pictures on the menu of several dishes. This is always good when you are wanting to try something new and feel shy.  Like to order my dishes Thai SPICY Hot. The family members just laugh and prefer it more in the Medium range. You can always ask them to bring out more chilies if you want to start off with Mild and work your way up.  Some of our favorites are the Tom Yum (Hot and Sour), Tom Kra Gai (Chicken Coconut Milk) Soups. The Appetizers are all really good as well as any of the Noodle dishes, the different colored Curries, the Spicy Garlic versions, and the many BBQ items.  Bring the crew and ask for Thai Spicy if you dare. It is hotter than the 1-5 scale. Located in a small strip mall and easy to drive right past. SIMPLY YUMTACULAR!"}
{"text":"The food was nothing out of the ordinary, but the efficiency and organization of the restaurant that night was absurd.  I was sitting in front of the kitchen and the food counter so I saw and heard pretty much everything.  I ordered a Thai iced tea, fried tofu, drunken noodles, and pineapple fried rice.  The waitress didn't write down my order, so I had to ask for my drink three times and waited for my food for about 25 minutes. I'm fine about waiting for my order, but not when my food is sitting and cooling on the counter for over 10 minutes.  I watched the waiters bicker about who would bus tables, prepare/refill beverages, take orders, and serve the dishes. There was no structure whatsoever. I hope they get it together..."}
{"text":"The tom kra gai was tasty as was the pad thai. Service good too. My first time here & I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Wow!  VERY VERY good! A very good friend recommend meeting here for lunch during a recent visit to Phoenix, and I'm SO happy that she did.  Sala is the best Thai I've ever had.  Sala is located in a very run-of-the-mill strip mall, and is a place you could easily overlook.  Definitely look for it and indulge.  My friend ordered a thai curry, and I ordered a hot seafood dish.  Both were amazingly fresh, flavorful, and generously-sized.  I cannot wait for my next Phoenix trip so we can enjoy lunch here again."}
{"text":"Our favorite place to go for consistently great Thai food, best on the Westside.  Family owned and operated by very friendly, good people.   Strongly disagree with Jay P's poor review.   Try it for yourself and you will see.   By the way, the Catfish Soup is awesome!"}
{"text":"New owner, new cook, new name (Thai Vegan) horrible changes..  Had the pad thai with shrimp and chicken...  terrible..  the shrimp had no flavor..  the noodles were overcooked..  The BBQ spare ribs tasted boiled..  no flavor...    I wil not go back..."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite Thai places and as we walked in tonight we were happy to see they have expanded!"}
{"text":"I'm traveling cross-country with my parents from NYC and we were all really craving some yummy, authentic Thai food (Pam's Kitchen + Pongsri in NYC are both amazing and right up our alley).  Ended up going to Sala because of all the reviews. Have to say - we all loved it!  We got their basil fried rice based on the reviews - and it was awesome.  We also ordered the drunken noodles, the spicy basil leaves with soft tofu and another with chicken (minced).  Everything was delicious!  In fact, between the 3 of us, we finished almost everything.  Kind of ridiculous.  Also, 4 out of 5 (spicy level) was perfect.  We love spicy food and it was the perfect amount of heat.  I would equate it to medium spicy in NYC Thai restaurants, which is really quite spicy but perfect if you can handle heat.  Oh, and not sure about peoples' tastes but we don't love sugar in our Thai food - so if you're the same, be sure to let them know not to add extra sugar.  We forgot to do that and although some dishes were a tad sweet(er), we didn't particularly mind because of the heat.  Still, next time, I would say no sugar.  Also, we ordered the coconut ice cream for dessert and it was great.  Subtle coconut flavor (not too essence-y) topped with toasted coconut.  Alsooo, the servers were really nice.  We arrived at like 8:45pm and despite closing at 9pm (kitchen closes), our server was super sweet.  Would definitely go back to Sala Thai if we're ever in the area again!!!!"}
{"text":"This is me and my wife's favorite place. We come every week. The food is amazing and the staff is the best. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We love this place. Relaxing environment and the freshest veggies ever. The rice is beyond expectation and you can bring your own bottle of wine or beer. We actually dine here at least once a week. The curry is the best in the area."}
{"text":"The restaurant is lavishly decorated with Thai culture motif. We ordered the Tom Yum soup spice level very hot and it was a kick - a**. My son even tried it and enjoyed slurping the soup and quickly reaching out for water to drink. We would definitely go back here and eat."}
{"text":"I gave Sala Thai four stars the first time I reviewed it. I don't know what I was thinking."}
{"text":"great food. Red curry is delirious. However the Pat Thai is too wet for us. We are not a big fan."}
{"text":"I came here with family to celebrate Father's Day. I started with an order of spring rolls. The veggies were very fresh and there was quite a bit of mint. There are three to an order and they are rather large. They came sliced in two and were perfect for sharing. The sweet peanut sauce that came with the rolls was a perfect accompaniment. Next was the mussamun curry..a large bowl of various veggies (you can add meat too) in a very flavorful coconut milk and chili paste broth....awesome!! My only complaint was I ordered it as a 5 heat level-the highest-but the dish had no heat to it. A bit disappointing. The best part was dessert-the fried bananas with coconut ice cream drizzled with honey. I thought I was getting an order for one person and was quite surprised when the waitress arrived with a long plate of three large banana pieces wrapped in a fancy deep fried phyllo pastry purse. Alongside each one came a decent scoop of coconut Ice cream with honey drizzled over the top of the bananas and ice cream. Best dessert ever and it looked as good as it tasted!! Of course I shared this with two others. A honeydew smoothie to wash it down was perfect on a 110 degree day. There were no complaints from anyone in our party and I will be returning soon."}
{"text":"Not a return place-- I was disappointed in the preparation of the the food I ordered and received."}
{"text":"Annoying that their phone rang for twenty minutes and the restaurant seemed to be understaffed, but tasty milk tea and musaman curry/phad Thai! Will go again."}
{"text":"I've given this restaurant 3 stars because I have now tried both locations, and BOY is there a big difference.  I've eaten at the Phoenix location twice; once for take-out and once to dine in.  Their food is quite good.  I found the quality of the curry and soups to be consistent.  The dishes were well prepared and very tasty.  The service in Phoenix was ok.  It can be a bit difficult to communicate, but not impossible.  Phoenix earns a 4.  Goodyear is an entirely different experience.  I stopped there for lunch recently and was very surprised at the difference.  The young man serving tables was rather clueless.  He did not take orders correctly, missed items ordered, took dishes to the wrong tables, and loudly complained about the kitchen staff to customers.  It was AWFUL!  I wish I could send an email to management, but all they have on their website is phone numbers, and if I called I could end up talking to the person that gave us such a bad experience.  The food was not up to par, and Sala should be embarassed at the 'service'.  This location should get 1 star, but I will give them the benefit of the doubt that this was an isolated incident as I have only been to that location once.  Highly doubt I would try it again."}
{"text":"Do you like savory foods? Seriously this place offers some really tasty dishes. So far the yellow curry chicken and spicy egg bomb are the favorites. I prefer to pick up order as the restaurant is a little run down. But everyone is very nice and will happily offer suggestions."}
{"text":"This thai food is BOMB!!! Real great authentic food! Everything is great! Very addicting. You'll love every item in menu and you'll keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Tasty Thai food!  The Rice soup is really good and great for sharing (enough for 4).  We had a bunch of appetizers and they were all good.  Our daughter loves the fried rice.  My favorite is the sticky rice & mango dessert."}
{"text":"It was okay, not great. I had chicken pad thai, chicken fried rice and crab Rangoon. Fried rice was the best of the three. It had good flavor. The pad Thai noodles were over cooked and the dish had a sand-like texture. The crab Rangoon was greasy and we didn't didn't have a second bite. I would go back for the fried rice.....but probably try another place first."}
{"text":"Any place that closes their table service early is not running a fair establishment.  Walked in at 8:45PM tonight and they stated \"take out only.\"  I really should give only two stars as the last meal had overcooked pad Thai noodles, but the rest of their dishes are very good.  Spotty service; good food.  Oh well!"}
{"text":"Decent Thai food, a little on the pricey side for the portion sizes. I tried the pad thai and the fresh rolls. Both decent, but nothing remarkable."}
{"text":"I love Thai food. Love it. And this is the best Thai place that I've come across in Phoenix. I've tried a lot of their menu items and have never been disappointed. I also enjoy being able to select how spicy I want my food (1-5 scale). The service can be mediocre and they don't serve alcohol, but with food this good you won't even care."}
{"text":"Good neighborhood Thai place - Panang was pretty good. My daughter ordered a Thai Tea with Boba - the Boba was way underdone - on the crunchy side of chewy. The aquarium is a trip - fake fish, but water jets make them 'swim' around - very rapidly.  Make sure you sit where you can see it! The staff was very friendly as well."}
{"text":"This place has the best green curry and spicy basil dishes I have found in AZ. Prices went up from when they first opened, but still reasonable.  I still return every time I return to visit from San Diego, and I haven't even found anywhere as good as Sala Thai in my two years there! Sewatdee Kalb!"}
{"text":"Finally visited to try it out after having it bookmarked for months. It was our first time having Thai food. The staff was friendly and helpful. We ordered the Larb with chicken, Basil Rice with Beef, Yellow Curry with Chicken, and another chicken dish that I can't remember the name of. All were really good. I really enjoyed the Basil Fried rice. It had unique spices and flavors that I really enjoyed. The yellow curry was predictable- which was just what we wanted. The chicken Larb was a small portion, maybe enough for 2 as an appetizer. The flavors were great and bright and spicy. We will definitely be back to try a few more dishes and get a few of the same again."}
{"text":"i usually get take out from this place. I've only tried the pineapple fried rice and pad see ew (which is the large flat noodles with beef). i usually get it extra spicy 4 out of 5 on the spicy scale. when they do make it spicy for me then it's really good. i think I've ordered from this place a total of 10 times and maybe 3 of the times they didn't make it spicy at all. it was bland and i had to put my own spices in it. i was so disappointed.  it's gotten better though after i called and complained that when i order it spicy i mean it and not be disappointed when i get home."}
{"text":"This is a cute LITTLE place and close to home so I want to love it but I just can't. We have been numerous times over the years but it looks like this last time was our last. The service used to be spot on and this time we spent lot of of time waiting. Waiting for a table, waiting for someone to take our drink order, waiting for our food, and then waiting a ridiculous amount of time for our check. My son actually sat with his hand raised like they do in school in hopes that someone, anyone, would come over to our table. I could hear the couple next to use complaining through their meal as well due to forgotten items and waiting for their server.  The food was simply ok this past visit. The flavors used to be vibrant and when you ordered something spicy it had some kick but lately everything just seems a little off and bland. We had pad Thai, sweet and sour chicken and a chicken red curry dish. None of the items were bad but they certainly weren't memorable either. The angel wings were a bright spot in the meal and recommended if you stop by. The Thai tea was also quite good.   If you are lucky maybe you will get a seat near the fish tank which gives you something to do while you wait."}
{"text":"This place rocks, plain and simple. It seems to be run by one big Thai family and they know what they are doing. The service was better than expected but the food was even better. I ordered my usual Pad Se Lew (sp?) and was not disappointed. It is the best Thai food I have found in Phoenix. I'll keep trying new places but right now this is #1 for the area. If you have any other suggestions let me know!"}
{"text":"We have been back a few times again and the dishes have been consistently good and fresh. We are now regulars."}
{"text":"NOT VERY VEGETARIAN FRIENDLY,  My big problem is thai food revolves around Buddhist food, and Buddhist food is vegan. So when I dont see on the menu vegi options on the curries/ noodles it makes me quite upset.  That Said I found their Pad Thai overly sour (way too much tamarind), but ok. There is a saying for every thai there is a pad thai. Had the tofu and bok choi, (the only vegi option in the curry list) and it was REALLY GOOD. They call it a peanut sauce but it really is a peanut curry, think vietnamese ga sate style. The Pa Nang curry It was good but not \"red\" enough. Talking red curry not just red color. It was very nice but not wow.  The curries also needed more stuff in them (vegetables) and not more bell peppers seriously people.  What was nice was 3 of us left there after 3 entrees and 2 sodas for under $35. The staff was very nice and asked how spicy we wanted things. The menu is a bit daunting so dont be afraid to tell the waiter that you need some more time.  I know that one reviewer stated that nearly any dish can be made vegetarian, which is a duh statement, all they will do is leave something (the meat) out. In-n-out can make you a vegetarian hamburger sure it will just be the bun and the fixins with no patty. My point is that in thai cuisine meat is usually simply an add on but at this place meat is the star of the dish and that is the most wrong perspective.   Top tip for thai restaurant  eating look for a place that list its curries and noodles separate. Now there are other dishes that will always be listed with certain meats as well the dish revolves around that particular meat, but these are the exception in thai food."}
{"text":"Exceptional Thai food. My mother-in-law, husband and kids always order Pad-see-ew and I like all of the curries. The yellow is so good with beef, the red is spot-on but my perennial favorite is the green. They use just about every green vegetable they can get their hands on and the flavor of the curry itself is heaven."}
{"text":"Excellent little restaurant! The food is of great quality. The Thai tea and the mocktails are delicious. The presentation of the food itself is stunning.   We went around 3:45 in the afternoon on a Tuesday and the place was empty. The quiet atmosphere and the decor were a plus. The decorations add a nice touch of classic Thai culture. I definitely recommend this place. I know I'll be returning!"}
{"text":"I bypass the Thai Orchid which is very close to me and go to Sala Thai instead now. (I reviewed Thai Orchid previously. I won't go again. The owner has made me feel less than welcome every time he has been there altho the wait staff and the non-grouchy co-owner are great.) I always receive fast friendly service at Sala. They have more lunch options at a great price, great srvc(!), and they have re-done the interior. I have been there for dinner several times and was very pleased with the prompt arrival of everything we ordered. I think the food is very good and consistently hear praise from anyone else who joins me there about it too. I know one reviewer said the food was not good and I would strongly  disagree."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! We ordered the yellow curry with chicken (spicy level 2) and it was amazing. The egg rolls were delicious too. Great price for what you get and the service was great. I especially liked the fish tank with the rubber fish in it. 10/10 would recommend!"}
{"text":"Some of the best Thai food I've had. My husband especially liked that he could tell them how spicy he wanted his dish prepared. We'll definitely go back!"}
{"text":"OH MY GOODNESS!!!! My little sister told me about Sala Thai and I've been here 4 times in less than 10 days, YUP, it's THAT GOOD! I order the drunken noodles, YUMMY as well as the crab pulls, egg rolls with chicken, pad thai, fried rice and a taro boba. I love how sweet everyone is there. Atmosphere is darling and the restaurant, though found in a retail strip, YOU WANT TO GO HERE!!!! Perfect for kids too, especially if you sit by their super duper cool fish tank. We drive from North Scottsdale to Sala Thai to get the best Thai food we have found in the good ol' State of Arizona."}
{"text":"I LOVE Sala.. and you dont have to be a Bala to go & feast.. I will say that the medium spice.. dang.. shouldve gotten the mild.. but had the Panang & pineapple fried rice.. awesome food.. mediocre service.. but Ill take it.. just with a lot of water..:-)"}
{"text":"Food = delicious!  Service = not great We got the Tom Kra Gai soup (coconut soup) and it was really good, not the best I've had but solid. Also fried rice and the pumpkin basil dish (#80).  Overall I will try another place in the area before coming back. Service is really important to me and it is just really lacking here."}
{"text":"Favorite Thai restaurant, love love love the Pad Thai dish. Great food, great service, great price. You can choose how spicy you want your food and most dishes are large enough to split :)"}
{"text":"I am very disappointed with this place, it closes at 9pm on Friday, I arrived with a friend at 8:35 and was refused a seat.  Carry out orders only she said.  I am astonished that it closes so early and am blown away at refusal of service.  BIG FAIL"}
{"text":"This is my first time eating Thai in Phoenix so I'm only comparing to what I'm used to. The food was bland and the curry was soupy. I prefer my curry to be a little thicker. The drunken noodles had a little too much veggies and not a lot of flavor. To make things worse, I ordered brown rice and found that they gave me white rice when I got home."}
{"text":"Food was excellent!!   Tried always fav pad Thai ...wonderful n just the right ammt if spicey!  And the yellow curry chicken... Was sooooo full because tasted so amazing! Prices were affordable!!  Happy campers ;))"}
{"text":"I have gotten food to go twice from here. I ordered the same thing both times. I am vegetarian and am limited in my choices most places. The first time it was really good. The second time I didn't like it at all. Not sure what was different but it was so bland,I couldn't even eat it. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"We live by and will definitely do take-out again, although it is a bit more pricey. The chicken curry was SO good that I didn't try anything else!! Pad see-ew is good according to my husband."}
{"text":"I didn't know what to expect when I walked into Sala Thai, but I was pleasantly surprised with the traditional Thai decoration. There were definitely lots to look at - the walls and the counters were filled with decorations. I personally didn't understand the point of a \"fish tank\" with plastic fish floating around, contrary to the others that seem to love it - I guess it just depends on taste.  We were seated, and were given plenty of time to look over their extensive menu.   I ordered the Chicken Barbecue plate and my sister ordered the curry. For the chicken barbecue, the presentation of the food was great, but the taste of the food was okay at best - the chicken was a bit tough to chew on. It really wasn't my favorite. The curry was better - it had a thick coconut aftertaste which I enjoyed. I would recommend the curry rather than the barbecue.   The reason why I gave this place three stars was because of the service. The waiters were never 'rude' per say, but they just seemed non-existent! They might as well make this place a self-serve restaurant because the waiter gave us the food but never checked in once. My sister and I were tired and in need of water because we came from walking in the heat but our waters were never refilled. My sister wanted more rice for her curry but no one came by to check up on us. It seemed like the waiters didn't put any effort to attending us other than taking our order and dropping off the food. Additionally, we were ready to leave for a while before they arrived with the check."}
{"text":"Delicious. We just moved to the area and have ordered here three times.  Everything has been hot and fresh and prepared quickly. The staff is super nice and repeat our phone orders to us when we come in to pick up just to be sure they got it right. The yellow curry is so delicious. I order spice level 4 and it is completely satisfying. My boyfriend gets basil fried rice, also delicious, it's a little sticky and saucy-yum. Give this place a try. Oh the dining room is quaint and warm and inviting."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by a coworker so we tried it on a Friday night. We were seated and that was the end of it. The table seated about 10 minutes after us was served water and then their order was taken and we were still sitting there with no beverage and no food ordered. An employee peeked over the kitchen wall and saw us not being served first and did nothing. We walked out 20 minutes after entering the establishment with no food or beverage.  Was very disappointed as many people have since told us that they love this place and the food is amazing.  Not sure if they deserve a 2nd chance. Will have to take some time to get over it."}
{"text":"Very impressed with this tucked-away gem for Thai cuisine. The duck curry is phenomenal, probably the best in the valley. Clean and bright atmosphere. Cheerful and pleasant staff and service. Convenient location off SR-51. Very reasonably priced with generous portions."}
{"text":"Based on only two meals I give them an above average rating for Thai Cuisine. We had the special of the day that was spicy duck basil. The duck was prepared surprisingly good and the flavors seemed right. We also had the spicy pumpkin basil with ground chicken. The chicken wasn't that supermarket kind of ground but was more like chopped up well chicken that was moist with some developed flavor and not just cooked and tossed in. The flavors were about right. If I knit pick I can say the dish would have been better if the pumpkin was cooked more because it was slightly crunchy and the basil should have been broken down more instead of being like mini branches of basil. But over all we both were pleased and plan to return.  The decor is very tacky but in a good way. Fake fish swimming in the fish tank. and stuff glued on the walls everywhere. Novelty hugging salt and pepper shakers are for sale for $3.@."}
{"text":"Best spring rolls I've found in the greater Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Surprised. Stopped at this place on a whim since we were not in our normal neighborhood. I had just had a small surgery and was leaving the Dr. so decided to get it togo. We had crab wontons, spicy coconut soup (no protein), BBQ pork, and roasted duck. The crab wontons are my husbands favorite takeout order and these ones were even more amazing for him because they had no onions (he hates onions). We were both surprised about how this random find turned out to be the best Thai food we have had in Phx (that wasn't homemade from our friends from Thailand). And we had plenty for left overs so we could enjoy it all over again. Healthy portion of rice came with. If you are anywhere near this place, or not, make the drive... it's worth it."}
{"text":"We come here once a blue moon when I'm visiting friends in N. Phx.  Usually we do family style so I get to taste everyone's order.  On this visit, majority of our dishes were overly salty and we just assume they may have a new chef.  At the end of dinner, our waitress came around and asked we want to pack up our 1/2 eaten dishes. I told her no because it way too salty.  Since I wasn't sure if it's just a one time thing, I asked if they have a new chef.  She said no and pretty much did nothing about it.  Crap, not sure if I'm willing to risk another salty dinner again.   Lad Na, Red & Yellow Curries (2*) - super salty & cannot finish Thai BBQ Spare Ribs (1*) - dry & super tough Pineapple Rice Rice (3*) Tom Yum w/ chicken (4*)"}
{"text":"Great spot, very consistent, excellent fresh made Thai food! You can't go wrong here for sure. I've eaten there several times with no disappointments."}
{"text":"I'm a fan.  I've traveled to Thailand and the staff is generally helpful in making recipes less authentic.  I keep forgetting NOT to order vegetarian pad thai.  Broccoli doesn't belong in that dish!  Other things are great.  My favorites are larb, fish cakes, and pumpkin curry.  My mother most loved duck red curry.  Everything is accurate level of spiciness.  Dine in or take out, it's a safe bet."}
{"text":"Excellent yellow curry. Saw someone else ordered phad thai & it looked very nice. spring rolls were great, just the way they should be, good dipping sauce. Prices are very reasonable. very quiet & sufficient (though very small) restaurant, good for a casual date."}
{"text":"AMAZING  I just had lunch here and it was AMAZING. I love this place. I can't believe it took me this long to stop in! I had the Pad Thai and eggroll. This food is fresh tasting, fulfilling, and pretty inexpensive. I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Try the coconut soup it's great if you like spice. Also the mango Bolba is delicious."}
{"text":"I ordered the pad Thai, side of white rice and an order of crab puffs as a pick up order. Order came to 25 dollars. It had to be the worst Pad Thai I've ever had.... and I'm not the pickiest person. If it wasn't 8:30 (they close at 9) I would have called them and returned it. It was honestly that bad. They didn't even put the peanuts on the side. Reign of Thai, up the street, is a hundred times better. Crab puffs were fine. Service was very fast and the gentleman that checked me out was very friendly, but I won't go back."}
{"text":"Amazing Tom Ka coconut soup! The curry is also very good here. I've tried their Pad Thai a few times, however, and it has been rather slimy and overlooked each time."}
{"text":"Our favorite neighborhood stop. Great value, food is always fresh, staff is always friendly. Get the spring rolls!"}
{"text":"This is the best Thai food in Phoenix.  Everyone I know loves this place.  I eat here all the time and have NEVER had a bad meal.  If you want great Thai in Phoenix, look no father than Sala Thai."}
{"text":"Unbelievable!! Best Thai I've had in a long time, by far the best in the valley. Massuman Curry and the Phad Thai were amazing. Quiet atmosphere, courteous staff, lovely restaurant  to enjoy a meal. Would recommend!!"}
{"text":"VERY DISAPPOINTED! Servers are bad & lazy. Can't even rate the food because they screwed up the order. We went in at 8:20pm & simply ordered papaya salad, tom-yum soup, & pad Thai... NOTHING COMPLICATED! Yes, soup & salad came out quick because it wasn't busy. Wait for 30 mins close to 8:55pm, finally decide to walk up & ask about the pad thai.  They forgot to cook it and said it was crossed out! Omg that's all I wanted to come here for! The whole time they don't even come check on us for water, or if we need anything else ."}
{"text":"Yum! I have been a loyal customer here for fifteen years. The food is great! The service is somewhat lacking but its nothing to get worked up about. Just try to be ready to order when your server comes around, because you may not see the server again for a good while. Often times, I find that there is only one server working the entire restaurant. They could probably use more than one for busier times. Only four stars because the decor is a little strange here. Overall, its a great place that I will continue going to as long as they will have me!"}
{"text":"Came in with my daughter Sun evening 6:45. The girl at the front tells us no tables you can seat here at the front if u want. The \"front\" is right next to the door and the cash register where everyone walks right by.  So we asked if we can wait for a table and she says NO. I asked her if she could take a look and see if anyone is close to leaving. There will be no tables for a long time everyone just sat down she mumbles. So I'm like, ok well maybe we will just order to go. And she hands us a menu. As she hands us the menu a couple walks in and sits at the other small table in the front. After about 5 min, a table leaves and they get sat!!  Meanwhile, we are still sitting here waiting for our take out. Its now been 20 min since we placed our order.  I pointed this out to the girl in the front and she dismissively says \"sorry i made a mistake\". WOW!  Boy are we going to miss Little Peking!!!"}
{"text":"Used to love this place. Switched owners and now the service is terrible and they no longer carry duck. Really sad because I used to come here at least every other week with all my girlfriends. Very disappointed. Won't be eating here again."}
{"text":"I love this place.    I usually get the yellow curry with chicken, spicy level one.   But all the curries are great.     And the atmosphere is great.    I've been to 4 places that have curry in the city, and I'm so glad this one is right down the street from me."}
{"text":"I have been to Thailand and eaten at many Thai restaurants across the US. This Thai restaurant had the BEST peanut sauce I have ever tasted. It was served with a salad that I got there. Which the salad had the most items on it, that I have ever received on a salad from a Thai restaurant: cucumber, carrot, iceberg lettuce, and bell pepper.   I also ordered to go, their Drunken Noodle (Pad Kee Mow) as a vegetarian dish with no tofu. I asked for broccoli and vegetables only. They gave me what I asked for. This was just OK. It had no flavorful sauce dripping from it and it was basically just flavored noodles, that were still almost the same color they are, before you make the dish. I usually have them served a brown color at other Thai restaurants.  I asked for a medium spice, and it was medium spicy.   I went to this place because we were driving out of town toward California and I needed a place that was close to interstate 10 freeway, leaving phoenix. So, if I was leaving town again, I would make the effort to eat downtown at a Thai restaurant there, Thai Basil or My Mom's Thai, instead of this.  But, I am sure at the Sala Thai, something dipped in that peanut sauce would be good.  Also, I would have to try more to see if all the other dishes, so that is why I gave them a 3 star.  I can not fairly judge unless I have had at least 3 separate dishes.  I took a picture so you could see the Pad Kee Mow and the color of the noodles.  I did not finish the dish.  I left what you see in the picture.   My advice to the restaurant, is to go to Thailand and get some recipe dishes and bring them back. I think your current Pad Kee Mow (Drunken Noodle) is watered down. Most authentic thai places in the US, have deep, thick tastes in their food. The more watered down they are, the less likely they are authentic or good.  Your service was good for to-go and you have GREAT peanut sauce."}
{"text":"I love the presentation, taste, and texture of their papaya salad with seafood. The first time I got it, I think I ordered 4 out of 5 on the spicy level and my mouth was on fire even though I love spicy food. I think their level 3 is perfect for me. Their basil fried rice is delicious. My boyfriend loves the garlic chicken and I always end up stealing a piece or two off his plate. I enjoyed the panang curry as well. It's a very small restaurant and it's always busy when I come in, but they are always smiling and gracious. Next time I visit, I am determined to try their egg bomb!"}
{"text":"This is our go-to place when we're hungry and don't want to cook. We've taken guests here on several occasions and no one has been disappointed. The food is excellent, but it's always a guessing game with the level of spice. We always say medium because we don't know what we're going to get. We like spicy food so it's not a problem for us. Thai tea with boba is always a treat. We just learned you can bring your own bottle for dinner which will be helpful in the future."}
{"text":"My husband and I had looked forward to trying this place all day. When we arrived at 6pm on a Saturday night there was a note on the door stating their lights and AC had went out. We peeked our heads in and asked if they were open. The hostess explained that they could cook, but there was no AC so it was probably a little too warm to dine in (the power had went out about 15 minutes before we arrived.)  We came in and sat down in the empty restaurant and the cook and hostess were so nice! They took our order and actually cooked it by flashlight. The decor of the place is actually pretty nice and quaint for a typical \"strip mall\" type place. I was kind of disappointed that we couldn't stay and dine there.  As for the food: We ordered the chicken satay as an appetizer and ate it there while we waited. It was amazing. The peanut sauce and whatever the other sauce it comes with was excellent.  The Pad Thai was pretty good. I would definitely eat it again.   The Tom Yum Seafood soup is the most amazing soup ever! It is a little spicy (we ordered medium) so I wouldn't suggest getting it hot unless you are willing to breathe fire!  The Pa-Nang is also fantastic. My husband ordered it hot, and it definitely was, but not so hot that you couldn't taste all the flavors. It was also excellent.  TL/DR: This place is excellent, definitely worth trying if you like Thai food"}
{"text":"I just love this place. Hard to find, but worth it.  The pumpkin curry is really interesting. Not ever had it before Sala, now it is one of my favorite dishes. The Ginger is also great."}
{"text":"Every time someone invites me to have lunch Sala thai is usually the first thing that runs into my mind. I really like their BBQ Chicken, it's always cooked to perfection never too dry. You must try one of their thai teas they're definitely one of the best I've had. The customer service is also very good. I believe the last time I was there the owner must of been there he wad very attentive and friendly. He offered me to try my fried rice with some chili sauces and explained to me all the levels. For instance, he said use just the juice for the least amout of hot, the seeds will at more, and the actual chili will be the hottest.  No one had ever offered trying it that way. So I gave it a try and it added more flavor which of course I would never mind."}
{"text":"I went with my family to Sala Thai this evening.  We sat down and ordered very quickly starting with an appetizer of angel wings (stuffed chicken wings with clear noodles, onion, carrots, and ground chicken).  We then ordered dishes for the seven of us:  two orders of Pa-nang curry, Thai fried rice, drunken noodles with tofu, spicy eggplant with tofu, grilled salmon, and the special (basic leaves duck).  The angel wings were a hit!  The other dishes were for the most part very good.  The eggplant was a little oily though the sauces were great.  The drunken noodles were okay.    As a hint to any Yelp readers, be very careful with the numbers (0-5) of how spicy you would like it.  We all ordered numbers between 1 and 3, and it appeared that those of us who rounded up found our dishes a bit too spicy while those of us who rounded down found the dishes just right.  Sala Thai also allows guests to bring their own bottles of beer or wine (though I do not believe they serve their own though I could be mistaken).    While two of my family members go to Sala Thai on a regular basis, most of the rest of the family had never been there before.  This was my second time and while the restaurant is good, it really didn't stick out as a unique Thai restaurant.  It is definitely worth checking out (as I am sure it is a great restaurant for others).  There is also plenty of parking available outside."}
{"text":"We had the egg rolls, green curry and coconut tom yum soup. The rice probably makes the dishes extra delicious Both really delicious ! Really good service too !"}
{"text":"Catfish with panang is amazing. I've ordered it many times and I'm never disappointed. I've recommended this place to my friends and family. Its a great hidden gem."}
{"text":"That is some pretty tasty thai food! I went here last night, service was pretty quick and food was good. I ordered the pumpkin curry, it was tasty. I asked for mild though and there was kind of no spice at all. Usually I play it safe at Thai places and order mild, but I wish this would've had a touch more kick to it. The vegetables, tofu, and pumpkin were just right though! Also I usually kind of plow through rice at thai places, but I had quite a bit left over here which was good. The fish tank with fake fish was a little tacky but also entertaining haha. Prices seemed pretty normal for a thai place like this. I'd come back here!"}
{"text":"Came here randomly just because I was in the area. Not really impressed with the food. The interior and the overall atmosphere of the restaurant is lively. I'd even say the place is pretty close to over decorating, but at least there's a lot to see. I was definitely mesmerized by their fish tank!! It had no real fish but a bunch of little ones that constantly floated around...geniusness!  Back to the food. Ordered pad see ew with chicken. The portion was pretty small and it lacked noodles. There was plenty of broccoli though. The Thai BBQ chicken was ok. Nothing too special about it. As for the garlic chicken, I don't even know if we got the right order? Our waiter said it was, but I would have renamed it crispy/deep fried chicken with some sort of sweet chili sauce? Don't know what happened there, but at least that portion size was decent.   Service was slow too. Even asking for hot water with lemon took twenty min. Ehhh just not too impressed overall."}
{"text":"We went here last night for dinner and once again had an amazing meal! Even on Sunday night this place was packed. The service is always friendly and the food is delicious!  Now that the weather is getting chilly I don't think there is anything more satisfying then spicy thai food.  We usually get the red curry with seafood and the drunken noodles but it seemed like everyone around us was having one of the soups (either Tom Yum or Tom Kra Gai). They looked good so next time we will try one of those."}
{"text":"Smells and tastes just like the food my Burmese friends make. Delicious yellow curry, pleasant wait staff and prompt service make this a very appealing place to eat in or take home to enjoy."}
{"text":"Love this place. Location is an a small strip mall off 32nd street. Authentic decor, small cozy atmosphere. Standouts for me are the Coconut milk Soup (tom kra gai) Papaya salad, drunken noodles and the boba tea"}
{"text":"Very good Thai food.  Decor inside was questionable. Really. Why they have plastic fishes in the fish tank? A booth seat I sat had rips. I wasn't sure what to expect based on the decor here.  I was wrong. Food was in fact very good. I really liked their pineapple fried rice. Their curry spice level 2 has a nice spice to it, really loved the flavor.  Summer rolls were refreshing, great way to start a meal. Mango with sticky rice was just good to finish good lunch.  If I am in the area, I would definitely come back"}
{"text":"Food has been great for years. Business has been getting busier and busier. Fun to watch a spot like this grow.   Unfortunately the last two visits service seems to be slipping. Seems to be a new staff. Don't recognize anyone. Our last visit we had to send our pumpkin curry back. They forgot the pumpkin!   I hope they get it fixed because we love this place and have for years. Again, great food and hopefully this is just a bump in the road and it will get resolved quickly."}
{"text":"Love this place. Last time I was here, we waltzed in for dinner late one night; it was probably 8:40 and they close at 9. While at most restaurants, we would have been subject to dirty looks, we were quickly seated and served cheerfully.   The curries are all tasty - although with the duck curry, we were expecting a little more duck, but got a lot of curry instead. Now, the real winner is the Catfish with Curry Sauce. Holy moly. The Catfish is fried to perfection and topped with Panang curry. **droooooooooooooool** I love Panang. I love this dish. It is soooooooo good. And this place knows how to make a good spicy Thai dish.   Check your Entertainment book for a buy 1 get one 1/2 off coupon. But even if you don't have one, this place is worth a stop."}
{"text":"Long ago and far away I lived in San Francisco wherein lies the delicious Lemongrass on Polk Street (near Union Street).  How I have I missed that temple of Thai cuisine.   Fast forward to 2016 and I have found Lemongrass' doppelgänger, Sala Thai. These cats cook authentic Thai; i.e., peanut sauce, a staple for the American-gringo palette, was nowhere to be found on ST's extensive menu.   Everything was delicious. BBQ spareribs are bite-size and will be a new favorite. Their Thai Iced Tea is a new addiction (Waiter! IV of Thai Iced Tea!  STAT!  I'm Jonesing! was my cry of the repast.).  Pumpkin Curry was a great veggie accompaniment for the ribs. Fresh Spring Rolls were packed with fresh leafyness of lettuce, cilantro, carrot and delicate rice paper. Lettuce Wraps were terrific. Potstickers were moist, pan-crisped on the bottom.    Go hungry. Spend freely!"}
{"text":"This place rocks.  I go out of my way at least once a month to eat here.  Food is unbeleivably good."}
{"text":"Pad Thai noodles overcooked and chewy, and the duck curry was a bit too salty.  Might have been an off night - they seemed overwhelmed and we had to fight to get the waitress to bring our check.  Others around us were grumbling too..."}
{"text":"Decent noodle/rice dishes, but the real star of their menu are the curries! They have some lovely and varied curries throughout the year (pumpkin, eggplant) that really have a host of complex, lovely flavors.  I'd highly recommend them!    Plus, there's a cool fish tank with plastic fish zooming around inside."}
{"text":"I am happy to see Thai food in Goodyear. This place is good for quick, local thai food. I've definitely had better, but it's good enough for Goodyear, and I love that I don't have to go all the way into Scottsdale for decent Thai food anymore. It works in a pinch. The drunken noodles are really good. Service is always very pleasant and friendly, although I pretty much always do take-out. Hope to see more NON-CHAIN ethnic eateries in the west valley!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Thai in the valley. A bit of a hole in the wall but I think that is what makes it so charming and authentic. Love the green curry....SPICY!!!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent, veggies were super fresh and the meat cuts were beautiful.  Service is a little slow, but the food quality makes up for it. The heat range is 1-5, I ordered a 2 and man was it hot ~ just like I like it!  Sala Thai is an excellent restaurant."}
{"text":"I found a good one!  Thanks to the reviews from Josh and Megan, I remembered Sala Thai Restaurant when I was craving thai food for dinner last night.  I wanted to try something new and it worked out well because Sala is located not too far from REI where I was headed to do some holiday shopping.  Sala provided me with a pleasantly full belly and fueled me for my shopping.  When I pulled into the parking lot, Sala was easy to see thanks to the fact that their lighting inside is extremely bright.  They are located next door to a martial arts studio and I could hear the people over there doing their thing a couple of times during my dinner... not necessarily distracting, but enough to make other yelpers aware of!  A friendly thai woman welcomed me when I walked in and told me to sit down where ever I wanted... I took note of her authentic fuschia thai outfit and was pleased with the fact that she followed me over to clean the table thoroughly before I sat down.  As I waited, I took note of some of the thai artwork on the walls and some letters from children - thanking the people at Sala for a 'cultural experience.'  I assumed from this that Sala had hosted some kind of dinner for elementary students and their families; very cool.  The menu is extensive and I had a hard time deciding what to order... everything looked really good!  There were several items that I had never seen on a thai menu before such as several entrees with pumpkin and a thai omelet.  That is the problem with dining solo at a thai restaurant - you don't get to share and try different dishes.  I enjoyed looking at the menu and the pictures of select dishes as well.  Please note - Sala Thai does not serve alcohol.  They do offer fresh fruit thai mocktails and thai iced coffee and tea.    After much debate, I went with #10 to start - Thai Salad with Peanut Sauce and #84 - Spicy Eggplant with Shrimp.  I was really happy with the salad; It tasted fresh and included lettuce, tomato, cucumber, carrots, onions, and red peppers.  The peanut Sauce was served on the side and it was sweet, creamy, and the perfect sauce to compliment the salad.  I ordered the Eggplant with 'medium' spice.  This was plenty!  I tend to like spice, but next time I may even order mild-medium.  I was happy they served me plenty of white rice to balance the spice of the dish...  Serving sizes were generous and I had leftovers to take home.  I cannot wait to return and try some of the other menu items as well.  This is the perfect place to go on a weeknight if you're in the mood for a casual thai dinner.  Next time, however, I'm bringing friends!"}
{"text":"Perfect Thai food and great for take out or dine in. I love the drunken noodles and panang curry."}
{"text":"They have my favorite Phad Thai in the valley! That is all I have had here, so if you are in to something else, you should look for more reviews. But if you love a spicy Phad Thai then you will love Sala Thai! I tried it after reading about them having won best Thai in Phoenix many years in a row by the Phoenix New Times, and I have to say that it seems well earned."}
{"text":"Okay so here's my dilemma...great food BUT they were recently on the dirty dining report...NINE VIOLATIONS.  OUCH.  I can see one or two, but NINE?  I want to have their Drunken Noodles and Panang Curry again but not until they get a much better report!    http://www.kpho.com/health/22798261/detail.html"}
{"text":"Lettuce wraps are amazing.. I could eat them at least once a week.. However the staff doesn't speak great English so it's hard to ask questions about the menu.."}
{"text":"It's hard to go wrong with Thai food. We did carry out and had red curry tofu and pad se ew. They forgot to give me brown rice, but the food was otherwise good. Cute little restaurant, I'll have to try dining in sometime."}
{"text":"Service sucked, food sucked, location sucks, and they don't even serve alcohol!! It was a bad first date, only worse. First and last time at this hole."}
{"text":"I had an unexpected visit from the Lee family.  They were on the west side of town, so they called and said dinner?  YEAH, I am there.  Asian food?  OK.  Thai?  OK.  Sala Thai was choice, thanks Yelp!!!  It is tucked into a strip mall with a Fry's.  Easy to spot.  It was nice, clean, but only a few tables filled when we got there.  We sat next to the fish tank filled with plastic toy fishes.  The kids were amazed.  We ordered:  Chicken Satay - It was pretty good, love the peanut sauce. Tom Yum Soup - A and J said VERY SPICY but good Phad-See-Ew with Beef - The kids inhaled it Thai BBQ Pork -  They are actually pork chops.  Pretty good. Pineapple Fried Rice - YUM.    The service was good (even from the new employee).  3.5 stars....."}
{"text":"Thought I should do a little review on Sala Thai while enjoying my yummy leftovers from last night.  Eating the Lad Na straight from the box, cold!  The value blows my mind.  The freshest and most authentic Thai in my opinion.  And it's BYOB!  This is not a seen and be seen kind of place.  Go to Roka Akor is you are looking for that vibe.  Sala Thai is a little \"mom and pop\" gem where the focus is on delivering delicious Thai cuisine.   The highlights for me are the shrimp pumpkin curry, egg bomb, and larb.  I get an endorphin rush every time I eat those dishes.  As of late we order take out from Sala every 2 weeks and are consistently blown away by how good the food tastes.  I have only 2 issues.    Their servers need to write down the ordered dishes.  Twice now we've had one particular server who has goofed up our order.  Don't mind waiting a bit for the kitchen to expedite a forgotten dish but when you have your 6 yr old and infant in tow you should NOT have to wait 45 min for your kid's dish to arrive (everything else on the table was too spicy).  They did comp us for the dish but I was glad that wasn't my first time in the restaurant or else we would have been robbed of frequenting the best thai place in the valley.      Second issue.  There needs to be some consistency with the heat scale.  Sometimes a \"4\" yields a dish that is only slightly spicy and other times a \"4\" is off the charts too hot."}
{"text":"now a 2  the shrimp red curry and pad thai have now gone further down hill, lacking the flavors they used to have.  The Tom Yum soup?  horrible, so fishy.  We were so excite last night to go but I don't think we can go back."}
{"text":"I love their spicy basil chicken! I always end up licking my plate clean."}
{"text":"I live nearby and take out twice a month. I love it and my fe Fiends do, too. So, I keep coming back. I enjoy pad Thai red or yellow curry, and their vegetable dishes. Very reasonable price. Very authentic Thai"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner. We got   Thai iced tea: very good  Thai spring rolls: fine but nothing special  Red curry with pork (4 out of 5 on the spicy  scale): this was a very good dish  Pad Thai: very weak dish. Not authentic and not very good.   Pad see ew: excellent and best thing we had."}
{"text":"Food is terrible. Obviously not consistent. But the service is terrible. Young girls serving who are rude. No please no thank you and they slam our stuff down. I wot e back. Goodness this food is terrible!"}
{"text":"Not the best Thai food I have had, but it's the best that I have had in the west valley. I have eaten here three times and everything that I have had has been very good. I will definitely be frequenting this spot"}
{"text":"Noticed this restaurant next to O'Riley auto parts in a business strip center.  The posted menu listed hot and sour soup which I am on a quest to find a good source of.    First, I have no reference for judging Thai food.  I do enjoy Japanese and Chinese food having visited Hong Kong and Taiwan multiple times.  I lived in Japan for a couple of years south of Tokyo.    I ordered a serving of hot and sour soup to take home to the wife.  It was interesting, but not like the Americanized version I'm looking for.  It was tasty, very full of mushrooms, onion, carrot, tomato and chicken.  No tofu that is common in the American version.  It had a thin stock that was nicely spicy.  I did not notice much sour component.  Interestingly, there were lemongrass sticks and pieces of what looked like pork bone in the soup as well.  Don't know if this was authentic to Thai cooking or an oversight.    Also tried the Thai chicken fried rice.  It was also very flavorful with generous amounts of chicken, vegetables and egg.  It was not stir fried at a high temperature to create the smoky flavor I look for in fried rice.  Very good though.  I ordered an appetizer of fried tofu.  It was, well, fried tofu.  Six generous pieces needing four bites each to consume.  Served with a nice sweet brown sauce garnished with fine chopped peanuts.  I would say the tofu was a good vehicle to enjoy the sauce.    The adventuresome item I tried was some spicy ginger pork.  It had the little red pepper beside the menu title.  Properly warned, I asked the waitress how hot their food is.    We came to common understanding with the word medium.  Sorry, I don't speak Thai.  I enjoy the taste of hot peppers, but not chemical burns.  The dish was wonderful.  Spicy hot enough to clear out any congestion and hydrate the eyes, but not painful.  I expect the full strength version would have been beyond my tolerance.  It's nice they adjust for wimpy Americans.  Very gingery with lots of vegetables.  The broth was awesome.  A good ginger dish warms the tummy and soul.  Served with a large bowl of steamed rice, it is the main reason I'll return again.    Portions are large enough (intended) for two.  Like most real Asian restaurants, you should bring friends and family.  They serve platters or bowels of food to spoon onto the empty plate provided.   Glad I stopped by to try their food.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"New in the area and wanted to find a nice Thai restaurant. It was a Sunday afternoon but they seemed busy. The place is not big. The food was pretty good and no complains on the service. If I really have to be critical I would say the price is a little high for the quantity."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing selection of food. And they get the spiciness right when they ask you. I would highly recommend this place. Very hard to find good Thai food."}
{"text":"Friendly service with flavorful food. Not from the area, traveling for business. Stopped here and was not disappointed.   Fresh papaya salad and the coconut shrimp was not greasy."}
{"text":"Now this is real thai food.  Everything is fresh tasting including the shrimp.  All the dishes.ive tried have come out excellent.  We have yet to take food to go cause we eat it all."}
{"text":"This is one of those rare reviews I will write that SG does not agree. We typically feel the same way on restaurants and the food. I actually think he would give this place a 4 or 4 1/2. That being said, I am writing my review and you will get my perspective. He's on his own.  Staying in Scottsdale, we found ourselves not having to have dinner with the crew. YA, no bar food. This was our opportunity to have good food of our choice without having to deal with all those guys. So, yelp on the mission to find something not too far from our resort with good ratings. Sala Thai came up fairly highly ranked and pretty darn close (and open a bit later on a weeknight, as it was around 8pm).  This place is in a little strip mall, small and hard to find if you are not looking for a store front. Someone had made reference to it in their review, so we did not have much trouble. We pulled on in and walked in to be seated. The place has lots of greenery and Thai decorations. All the seating appeared to be in booths though there may have been a table or two toward the back. There were quite a few people here as well, but we were seated right away.   The menus have lots of pictures and some very creative drink options. We ordered a slushy thai tea to share and continued to look at the menu. There were quite a few creative Thai dishes that you do not see other places and we decided that we would stray just a little from our norm. I was dead set on papaya salad, since I felt I needed some fruit after all the bar food I had been eating. We also ordered pad see ew beef and pumpkin chicken.   The drink took forever to come. I think there may have been only one person in the back cooking, though there were two young people hostessing and taking orders. The food arrived close to the same time as the drink. The papaya salad, though we ordered medium spicy, was HOT HOT HOT. We were both dying. We usually can tolerate spicy, but this was almost too hot to eat. We did not even finish what was on the plate and typically I would eat that more than the other stuff. The Pad see ew  was ok, not as good as would have liked. Just not as flavorful. The pumpkin chicken was good. Different. I picked out and ate most of the pumpkin.   I just felt very unsatisfied by the meal. The food was just ok. I have had so much good Thai food that this one just did not live up to my standards. So much for a good non-bar food night. But at least the Thai tea was great, once it came. Maybe we just did not order the right stuff and should have ordered mild on the spice for the papaya salad. I am sure there are other Thai places in the area, so I will likely not go back (even if SG voted to go back)."}
{"text":"Food was ok, what gets me at restaurants is service. The waiter chatting with customers...which is fine, but if you have other customers waiting, you have to cut it short. Very forgetful waiter, and the worst thing about it is that he doesn't even know he lacks skills."}
{"text":"I brought my non adventurous family here and they all loved it. They took extra time to answer menu questions and explain the heat levels and variations. Note, they give you spicy when you ask for it!  Also I love that they have blended drinks and lunch specials."}
{"text":"Food was awesome, and the layout of the space is pretty cool/different with the kitchen in the middle of the restaurant. I ordered the ChickenPanang Curry (my favorite Thai dish) with a \"3\" on their spicy level, but I probably could have ordered a 4 or 5. Sometimes it's hard to gauge how hot to get when its your first time at a new Thai place. A \"3\" at other places usually has my nose running lol definitely worth a try, and I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Sala Thai always has great service and their food never disappoints. I live in the area and sometimes call in to pick up a meal and they're always prompt with their time frame. Yummy, affordable food and great service!"}
{"text":"We went to Sala last night/ We started with the chicken satay. Though, I didn't dislike it at all, I have to say that it didn't taste quite like any other satay I've ever had/ That is to say that it was bland, and didn't seem to have been marinated in the same blend that I am used to. I'm used to satay being kinda yellow, and this just looked like cooked chicken.  One thing I noticed about this place is that there are no salt or pepper shakers at the tables. They are available if you ask the server for it, but I don't like having to flag the server down to get salt if the dish needs it. I would rather have it there at my fingertips. Maybe it's just me.  The person I was with ordered Pad Thai, a standard Thai dish, good for an introduction to Thai cuisine. She told me that she found it to be quite spicy, which is unusual. Thai food can be very spicy, but pad Thai usually isn't at all.  I ordered the red curry with beef. The spice levels here are rated with number 1 to 5 (or 6 if you want Thai spicy). I asked for it to be at a 3. I can handle spice levels being much higher, but I tend to go for middle of the road when it is my first time at a restaurant. I found the dish to be a little tame on the heat side. The 3 felt more like it was on a scale of 15 or 20 than 5 or 6, but I am honestly not the best guage for that as I do like the heat a lot.  The service, I thought, wasd very good.   I may be back soon."}
{"text":"Amazing, I will return for sure. I've came in for just desert and thai coffee and they were amazing. Tons of options for food!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite Thai restaurant in the area.   We love the Tom Kra Gai (Coconut Milk Soup); I would go there just for that.   We also enjoy the various Curry dishes on their menu.   The service is fast and the best part is that you can BYOB. (Well that and the cool little fish tank...you'll have to see it to understand.)   When we're too busy to eat in, we do their carry out often as well."}
{"text":"Food average.... Bad shrimp and service... Yikes! RUN"}
{"text":"TL;DR version: - Red Curry was WAYY over-salted. I usually enjoy salty food, but it was over the top. - After explaining I deal with severe allergies (namely onions and peas) the server listed all the vegetables to ensure nothing was included that I couldn't have. She said they could leave off the onions. The dish came out FILLED with snow peas, which yes, are still peas. It also had a huge leek in it despite explaining the severity of my onion allergy. - She offered to remake the dish, but I had zero confidence in their ability to make it without allergens, so I declined. They DIDN'T remove it from the bill.  We will never be going back here again. The whole experience was super disappointing and I will have to deal with an allergic reaction for 2-3 weeks because of their carelessness. If you also have food allergies or enjoy low blood pressure (aka not having ridiculously over-salted food), go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Love all their food, it is delicious, havent gotten something that I havent enjoyed.  Love their Thai Ice Tea as well.  The only drawback is the service is TERRIBLE.  But, since the Thai is tasty and I just expect poor service, I still go."}
{"text":"Thai Orchid closes at 3 for two hours, so my son and I stopped in at Sala today. We had the Beef Salad, Chicken Satay and Shrimp Spring Rolls.  We didn't have any left overs between the two of us. The service was great as well! We will stop in again."}
{"text":"Excellent food and friendly service!  We had the fresh spring rolls with shrimp which were indeed very fresh and crisp.  The dipping sauce was delicious!  Also tried the panang curry with tofu, level 3 spicy and the orange chicken and shrimp.  Both dishes were fresh and very flavorful.  Mixed together was heavenly! We very much enjoyed our dining experience here at Sala Thai and will be back again. They have a huge menu with a variety of dishes to choose from. We are looking forward to trying some of their noodles next and experimenting more with their spice levels."}
{"text":"Reviews here are very accurate, most of the food is very average, the PadThai here is terrible and the curry dishes use way too much fish salt, rendering them salty and overpowering.  The overall spicyness is very tame, and the food lacks the mints and fresh herbs you would expect from good Thai food.  On the bright side, the service is good and the food is cooked well, leaving the vegetables firm and tasty.  They have Angel Wings here, and while not handmade they are good. Fresh rolls are very dull, lacking the herbs necessary to bring any fragrance to the food.  There are many other Thai places in the area better than this, we would not go back."}
{"text":"I was craving Thai the last few days and really wanted some for lunch. I didn't think I was going to get any because I had errands to run on my lunch break, but it just so happened that this place was right down from where I was! I checked yelp before I went in just to be sure it was good. Some places are sketchy. I saw 4+ stars and was super excited.   I normally order some type of garlic entrée, but I'm pregnant and have for some reason been craving curry all week! I ordered the yellow curry with chicken and no spice, and it was SO good. Normally with my pregnancy cravings I build something up in my head to be so amazingly delicious and then when I get it, my expectations were way too high and I end up disappointed. But this time, the curry was exactly what I wanted and I was extremely satisfied. It was creamy and had a lot of chicken.   I ordered it to go, and the service was fast and the waiter was very friendly.   My ONLY complaint is they don't have a lunch menu. I was hoping for some lunch special/combo with smaller portions, but they have the same menu all day. The meal was about $10 without a drink and I would have been much happier paying around $6 or $7 and getting smaller portion like at Thai Elephant or Thai Basil does.   Overall, I loved it and if I'm in the area again I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We had eaten there once before on a recommendation from a co worker of my wife. She is of Thai descent, therefore she should know. The food was exquisite in taste and we really loved it. We did notice that the amount of meat within the dish itself was maybe a little skimpy but didn't think much of it. Then last night we decided to go with a couple of friends to eat there. We spoke so highly of the place and even told our friends that we loved it way more than Thai House on Shea where we had been with them before.   The dishes came and we were blown away. The bowls of Red and Yellow Curry that my wife and 2 friends ordered looked like kid's portions. The amount of food in the bowls was minimal. The amount of meat was again skimpy bordering on non existant. I had the PadThai. The flavor was authentic and delicious. There was only, however, three small pieces of chicken breast and two shrimp.   The issue here is the fact that almost every dish is now around $10 and the portions are too small. For this kind of money, I expect more meat. I am not sure if we will be going back. I would say something, but not too sure if they really would care."}
{"text":"Consistently fabulous food!  This is a once a week must for us.  Love to try something different every time we go.  We love that it is BYOB!"}
{"text":"I ate here again the cashew chicken was fantastic! I will be here again in the near future."}
{"text":"Ok I'm so sorry to have to give such an update review.  I've been to Sala Thai several times since discovering it a couple of years ago.  I decided to take my really good friends for lunch a couple of weeks ago. When we walked it we sat on the newly expanded side.  They had recently doubled in dining space. The food of just okay this time.  I'm not sure if the cook of having an off day or what.  Well while we were eating and chit-chatting away my friend started to get all excited from across the booth telling me to get up and look behind me.  When I did I saw a roach crawling on my seat then scurry away to the next booth.  Okay I tried not to freak out myself and continued our lunch. Then my 7 year old starts to freak out next to me as he notices 2 roaches on the wall next to my friend across the table.  Okay that was it.  My son and friend got up and stood there until our bill came.  Our waitress came out and saw what the excitement was all about but do you think she said anything....of course not.  I assume this must be a normal thing for them now.  Well, needless to say I don't think I'll be returning to Sala Thai."}
{"text":"Was in the neighborhood and stopped by for lunch. They have one menu and don't have lunch specials, FYI. I ordered a pad thai with tofu (4/5 spice level) and a Thai iced tea with boba. Service was quick and friendly and the presentation of my dish was beautiful; I took a pic but it didn't save to Yelp. The taste of the pad thai was fine, I did like the thinner noodles but the tofu wasn't flavorful and the spice level was definitely not a 4, I like it to the point where I have trouble breathing and need a break. My drink was okay, there were a few hard boba balls and too much condensed milk/half and half or whatever it is that they use.   I may come back to try different menu items but pad thai is my deciding factor on whether I like a restaurant and they can improve this dish by adding more spice and changing the tofu."}
{"text":"Sala Thai is great for a number of reasons. They use fresh ingredients, their dishes have great flavor, and they have a large selection of entrees to choose from. I've tried several things here and have never been disappointed. They also have great drinks. We love their thai iced coffee and their frozen boba drinks. The restaurant is always clean and they have a fun, colorful decor."}
{"text":"I don't know what all the hype is about this place. I've tasted over 100 different Pad Thai dishes from various places and Sola Thai literally had the worst Pad Thai I've ever had. I'm willing to give them another chance on something else but if a Thai place can't make even decent Pad Thai thats not a good sign.."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time on my birthday, and tried it again a few days ago. I've tried the chicken satay, egg rolls, Thai iced tea, pad Thai, Thai BBQ chicken, and the fried banana dessert with coconut ice cream. None of it disappointed. The wait staff are very friendly, the restaurant is clean, and the prices are reasonable.  I'm sure I'll continue to go back - if you go, definitely do the dessert - it's DELICIOUS!  Also, if you have a big party, you might have a tough time here unless you don't mind being split up - they have a few tables, but it's mostly booths that comfortably seat 2-4 adults."}
{"text":"When I first had Thai food, I went to a small Thai restaurant in Scottsdale. It was okay. However, when I tried the Thai food here, I fell in love!!! It has become my favorite Thai restaurant. I love getting the shrimp spring rolls, coconut ice cream with fried bananas, drunken noodles, pad Thai, pad woo see, and the pineapple fried rice. Personally, I like to keep it at level 2 spicy. I feel like it jumps a lot from 2 to 3. Oh, and the art on the left-hand side of the restaurant is GORGEOUS! One of the workers told me that they purchased them from Thailand!"}
{"text":"I have been here a bunch and have not yelped this place...I think it is time i do right by them because they do right for my stomach.   The rushes here are really random so make sure you give them a call and see how busy they are. If they are busy i would say hold off on going for a little bit. They expanded their restaurant, but the kitchen is the same size and cannot efficiently handle a packed restaurant.   I really recommend getting the fried catfish curry, that literally is the best thing on the menu hands down. I love it soo much. I can't not get this when i go.  I enjoy all their spicy food to rate it a 1 is like peppercorn spice, 3-4 is a mild jalapeno  and 5 is around a spicy jalapeno and serano.   Service is always been good, everyone is polite. The only time when service is slow/bad when the place is getting packed.   This place is where i go when i crave some thai food for sure."}
{"text":"I'm not sure there's any management here at this point. The food has gotten worse. The pricing increased and the potions decreased. The smoothies I used to order went from amazing fruity shushes to milky tasting, not sure why. Also, it's rare that I can even place a to-go order anymore. Sometimes I spend 10 minutes calling just to get an answer. I give up"}
{"text":"I have been eating at Sala Thai for at least 4 years now.  I thought I had done a review, but I guess my \"Brain to Yelp\" Implant wasn't working that day.  Anyway, this one of the best Thai restaurant I have found in the Phoenix area and they have an extensive menu that should have something for everyone.  I generally get the Thai Omelet with Pork, or if I feel like getting a variety by trading portions with my wife I'll get veg/tofu dish.  The omelet is stuffed with your choice meat, clear noodles and other good things. It is not greasy at all and has a fluffy texture.  It is severed with a side of fish sauce to drizzle over the omelet.  We have tried several of the veg/tofu dishes with Spicy Green Bean, Spicy Ginger, Pad-Woon-Sen and Spicy Basil Leaves being the highlights, but all the dishes I've tried have been tasty and fresh.  Last time my dad was in town we took him here and he ordered the Chicken Satay to share, it had a fresh grilled taste and had a nice dipping sauce.  The majority of the dishes can be prepared with your choice of meat or tofu for the protein and you select the level of spiciness you would like.  They also have a vegetarian page in the menu that includes some appetizers and entrées prepared vegetarian.   They have expanded the dining area, so now you rarely run into long waiting times that was once a problem here. One of my favorite things about Sala Thai is their \"mocktail\" drink selection including several fruit flavors, Thai iced tea, Thai coffee and I believe they also recently added Boba style drinks.  They use to have a dish named \"Son-in-Law Egg\", but I think they took it off the menu.  Unfortunately, I was never brave enough to try it... Maybe if you ask they can still prepare it.  Also, they have opened a Goodyear location on Litchfield Rd south of the I-10 for those you out west.  This is great place if you like Thai food, want to introduce someone to Thai cuisine or have a party with people with several different diet/lifestyle choices."}
{"text":"Every Thai place I always get the same item(at least once). That makes comparing much easier. I always get the Spicy Basil w/Tofu and brown rice(if you don't have brown rice then you get deducted at least a star and DON'T tell me brown rice and white rice are nutritionally the same, really? Read a book! ). Sometimes I throw on a side of steam Broccoli for good measure but not always. Sala is the closest decent Thai place to where we currently live so I would say we frequent Sala more then any other Thai place in the Valley.  We get take out 50% of the time and eat in the other times. Only once can I think of that the order was jacked up at all(no brown rice). Usually service is quick and no hassle. Food is quite consistent, sometimes the vegetables on the dish change, but it's always a surprise and works so why not!  They have the typical decent veg/vegan selection and will do a fish sauce replacement(plum I think) if you ask. My only minor complaint is that sometimes the heat level is not consistent, I like it HOT but Thai Hot some places is HOTTTTT, other places its just mild. Usually if I ask for hot, it's a good level but sometimes it is off(usually weak).   I won't say it's my favorite Thai place in the valley but it is in the top 3 for sure (at least top 5...yeah top 5) and I have given them plenty of times to disappoint."}
{"text":"Best Thai food restaurant in town. We have been here several times and the food is always consistently good. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Great for vegetarians as well. The best thing is its BYOB!"}
{"text":"I went here for dinner with my parents and had a wonderful experience. We brought our own bottle of wine, which was cool, and we shared the chicken lettuce wraps, which were awesome and came with three good sauces. It was a notably large portion for an appetizer and could easily be shared by 3-4 people. For dinner, I ordered the green curry with chicken and brown rice, on a 4 (out of 5) spice level. It was very spicy, as I was hoping for, and I admire anyone with the courage to order the 5. Everything was cooked nicely, all of the right flavors were there, and it was amongst the best green curries I've ever tried. I was able to snag a bite of the duck curry (which was in an orange-colored sauce which included pineapple [yummmm]) and a seafood special, which contained shrimp, scallops, catfish and a variety of vegetables. All three entrees were delicious and exceeded my expectations! As far as service went, the waiters were very friendly and attentive. The ambiance was very nice and, overall, it was a five star experience for a reasonably priced Thai restaurant. I definitely recommend swinging by if you're craving a mean green curry!"}
{"text":"I wonder if they got new owners, because I went in on a whim for some takeout and the place looked fairly different. New booths, and it looked like several young men in their 20's. A younger guy helped me order and he was really cool. I almost wished I was there with someone so we could dine in and see if the experience was any better than the last. I definitely want to check it out again!  The food was great, as usual. I knocked off a star because I think that despite the good food, the prices are just a little high for what you get."}
{"text":"Casual and comfortable atmosphere.  I had the Pad Woon Sen,  it was delicious.  My husband had the Pad Thai, also very good. The staff was friendly and food was delivered in great time. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Love this place but recently the food has been inconsistent.  I've been here A LOT over the past 5 years. To my disappointment, the flavors and consistency have gone down a lot in the past 6 months. I want old SALA back, where I can always count on a delicious meal!  Quality and flavor has gone back to normal! Love me some SALA!"}
{"text":"This used to be one of our favorite Thai places but the last couple of times have been a disappointment. We decided to give it another try just incases (love actually reference). Not love, actually much dislike. Pad Thai shrimp extremely over cooked an minus the best part, the peanuts! Stir fry noodles tasted greasy and left lingering aftertaste. When we told the server she just looked at us blankly. We will not return."}
{"text":"Ate here today for the first time in 2 years. The food has greatly improved and the service was wonderful. The owner informed me that they will be closing the business tomorrow. I wish them luck in finding a new location with better traffic flow and business as they truly belong among the west valley good eats."}
{"text":"Recently moved from Washington State and decided to go here with my mom.  We heard good things, so what the hell.  It couldn't be too bad, right?  Well...  We kept it simple and only ordered a few appetizers: fried egg rolls and chicken satay.  The egg rolls reminded me of what I would find in a cheap Chinese restaurant and the chicken satay was dry, tough, and overcooked.  I can only assume that people around here must not know what good Thai food tastes like.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"I happened to see this restaurant while driving home from somewhere, and checked it out on here.  The reviews were somewhat mixed, but most saying it was worth a try.  We decided to check it out tonight, and so glad we did.  It wasn't too crowded for about 7ish on a Sunday night, but a few tables were full.  We were seated immediately, and found the staff very friendly.  We started with the chicken satay, which was absolutely delicious.  I loved the peanut sauce, could've just eaten it with a spoon.   We both got the pad thai, and found it very good.  I loved it as is, my husband would probably get it with a little spice added next time, but he also really enjoyed it.  And, we ordered the fried bread with coconut ice cream as a shared dessert.  It was also very good.  All the food seemed to be made as we were ordering it, things were fresh-tasting and very hot.  Someone was always around, making sure everything was good, and if we needed anything else.  I've noticed some of the past reviews mentioned service issues, and we had none of that.  The decor was casual and comfy.  There is a large fish tank in the middle of the restaurant, and it has a bunch of colorful toy fish in it.  For some reason, we found that amusing, but couldn't stop watching it...LOL!  There was also a young woman who was singing from a karaoke machine...she did a few sets...and was surprisingly quite good.  I believe she works for the restaurant, not a patron just getting up and performing.  All in all, we really enjoyed our experience, and are looking forward to going back again."}
{"text":"I want to like this place since it is close to home...but, the food was just okay. The pad Thai was alright and the crab Rangoon was actually wonderful, but overall I find the favors lacking. I will try it again with the hopes I just chose the wrong entree."}
{"text":"The spicy green bean chicken is a go-to favorite for my family! 1 order serves 2 adults very nicely and the service has always been exceptional. Please note, they are closed on Mondays now."}
{"text":"This is one of our go to's for Thai food. All of the curries are delicious. And make sure you order the Thai spring rolls! My husband loves their Thai tea. So good! The staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"Food was good, typical Thai flavors. Service was slow and uninterested in us. Mocktails are a waste of money just get the regular drink for half price. The are just pouring thai tea in the blender with ice so it's watered down and slushy then charging double for it.  Dining area was pretty small with 1 booth outside.  It looks like they are expanding into the space next door so they may have room for larger groups in the future."}
{"text":"Over the top - excellent place.  I've had a a lot of Thai food in my lifetime, including several weeks in Thailand... and in my humble opinion, this is as good as it gets.  If you want great - I mean really great - Thai food, go here.  Try the coconut soup... I was tempted to lick the bowl."}
{"text":"Returned again a couple of nights ago and the service was much better!  Had the Pad Thai, Shrimp Peanut Curry, and the Pork Ribs.  Pad Thai was good but, a little too much sugar for my taste....Shrimp Curry was delightfully good..the Pork Ribs are really good, especially with the sweat chili sauce!"}
{"text":"All around a good Thai restaurant! The food was really delicious. I had what I always get at Thai places... Yellow curry with chicken. no beer at this restaurant but yet their open close sign is sponsored by a Thai beer called Chang, which is a really great beer must try. My only gripe was the service. They were nice enough but the service was awkward. They would ask you a question and walk away before you could answer. Usually I would blame that on how busy it was but... We were the only people in the shop. Again, over all a great place to eat and I recommended it if your in the area."}
{"text":"Spring rolls, drunken noodles were delicious.  Pleasant decor, reasonable table service.  No complaints.  Recommended."}
{"text":"The place was nice for a family owned business. Servers are excellent you can really tell  they are doing a job well done for the fact the place was very busy. Food was amazing ! The amount of serving was a ver decent portion .. plus theres a bowl of rice ! .. its not a fine dinning ! So people don't expect to much .. all in all we are definitely coming back !!"}
{"text":"So I forgot to write a review the last time I came here. This place is really good food. Second time I've been here and def going to come back. Good variety, and great tasting food. Good prices. I'm getting hungry just thinking of the menu lol"}
{"text":"This is my first experience with Thai food in Phoenix and for the most part it did not disappoint.  I have never seen a Thai iced tea that was a 50/50 split of tea vs cream.  Terrible for you yes, but the extra richness suits me just fine.  It was a party of 15 so service was a little slow but like I said 15 people you kind of need to expect that but the staff was very friendly and there were no order errors which is always a plus.     Whenever I do Thai I almost always get curry.  Same here, I got the masmun curry with tofu and it was wonderful.  I wish there was a better rice to curry ratio as I had so much leftover rice, but I find there is never enough curry.  I also had a bite of my friend's drunken noodles and they were fairly good, but the curry was better. My one slight dissapointment was that spice level seemed off as I and almost all of my companions rated the spice level milder than what they were expecting.  I got a level 3 and felt like a 4 or maybe even a 5 would have been tolerable.  All in all though it was a great introduction to Phoenix Thai and I would happily eat here again."}
{"text":"Best Thai in Phoenix!  Thom Kai Gai soup is the BOMB!!  Very reasonable prices and killer Thai food.  BYOB though so plan in advance."}
{"text":"Piss poor service! AND  horrible food!  First of all when you walk in the front door- the door was sooo dirty and grimy- gummy- it was so gross. We debated as to weather we should actually go in. When we got inside- it looked clean enough yet there was a weird \"dirty\" smell wafting through the door.  The food might have been just ok- but by the time we actually got it- we were so frustrated we didn't care.   The place wasn't  busy- yet we waited 10 minutes for the server to take our order. She acted like we really screwed up her day by coming in. On top of it- she was a mumbler. Couldn't understand a damn thing she said. We finally ordered the Thai Basil Leaves, Pumpkin Curry with Brown Rice, and the Fresh Spring Rolls to start.  47 minutes later...after others who came in after us were already served and done---  All the food came out together including the starter. Minus the brown rice.  So we started with the Fresh Rolls. They were bland- no basil. By the time we got to the entrees- they were of course cold. Still no brown rice. The server still did not check to see how we were. We finally motioned to her and she said she was busy- and would get it. Busy? WTF?  5 minutes later... we were able to grab the guy who was serving other tables and asked for the rice.  The food was bland and tasteless. And it all had the same flavor- except for the Basil dish. The tofu was burned- see picture. So the whole dish tasted burned. Yuck.  The server never came back to check on us- until she brought the bill. We showed her the tofu- and she said well we have a new chef. My companion said- thats not my problem, I am the customer.\"  The server took the bill back and spoke to the manager supposedly- she came back with 10 percent off the bill. Again WTF! 10 percent is - I guess-is something- but certainly didn't make up for the dumbass server-who tried to blame everything on someone else.   I will never be back- This is one dump!"}
{"text":"Looking for some good Thai food I came across this restaurant.  I was quite impressed with this place.   Another restaurant located in a boring strip center, but what else is new for the Phoenix metro.  The decor is very appealing and the music playing in the background adds to the experience.  The service is great and helpful.  We all know we come for the food though.  Portions were just about the right size and full of the spicy flavors that I was looking for.  When I'm in the area I'll have to check this place out again and would recommend the restaurant to anyone who likes Thai food."}
{"text":"Thai restaurants are always interesting because of the varying spice levels. First time trying any place, I try to go conservative because I don't want to necessarily ruin my meal with uber spice.   Let me tell ya, this place does spice/heat right. Just the way I like it. My first time eating here, I got level 4 out of 5, and it was perfect. My daughter got 3 and I tried her noodles, which were spicy still..   Service. Well, as others have mentioned, it's not the most warm and fuzzy service you will get, but will suffice. The food makes up for it.   Portions are smaller here, so you won't feel stuffed nor will an average person have leftovers. My 8 year old was able to finish his plate with no problem.   I noticed on their credit card bill, the preprinted recommended tip only goes up to 15%, whereas usually at other restaurants I see it go at a minimum to 20%."}
{"text":"Food is good but service can be just ok..depends on wait person. I would recommend people to try it."}
{"text":"I grew attatched to this Thai place by my old work but since I moved I have been hesitant to try a new one. This place did not fail me! Great, attentive service. Never bugged the table or interupted coversations. Anything you asked for was out promptly. I had the Tom Yum level 3 spicey. Wow! Was it hot, extremely tasteful & enjoyed with with a side of rice and egg rolls. Very nice portion size and I got the small. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Ah Sala Thai.. I've seen you grow from a newly opened awkward teenager to the busy mature establishment you are today. I'm lucky enough to live a few blocks from this place. I spotted it a week or so after it first opened and dragged a few friends there. I could tell and mentioned to the group that I knew this place would do well if they could stay a float and get the word out. Only wish I yelped back then so I could have been more help in the process.  When we ate there we were the only ones in the resturaunt. The kitchen at the time was manned soley by the grandmother and one of the daughters was taking orders and busing. Saturday we got in there to a packed house.. got the last open booth within 15 minutes a line formed out the door. The phone was ringing off the hook for pickup orders. The back area of the kitchen had 3 or 4 people in a mad rush turning out food. One of which was still the grandmother :) I was a little sad to see the prices jumped up and the portions went down but there was still plenty of food. The menu had also expanded largely.  What we were lucky enough to eat:  Thai Spring Rolls: Veggies wrapped up in a soft chewy rice wrapper served with a housin/peanut that would make shoe leather taste amazing. All the veggies were very fresh and crunchy which lent a great texture. The mint!! man do I love the fact that these have the crazy contrasting flavor of mint. Thai food is such a celebration of marrying sweet and savory flavors.  Fried Tofu: Quickest way to ruin something semi health is to batter and fry it :) but it is worth it. The crispy coating against the soft warm tofu is a great combination. Also served with that great plum/peanut sauce.  Tom Kha Gai: I've had this soup all over the country, various places in the UK and in New Zealand. Sala Thai and the little place in New Zealand have the best version so far. So spicy from the peppers, sweet from the coconut, intense ginger and lemon grass flavor. Just remembering this dish is what steered me here for my Saturday cheat meal. The soup is filled with large pieces of lemon grass and dried ginger so be cautious. You don't want to chomp down on either of these but I also wouldn't want them to leave it out.  Panang Chicken Curry: My absolute favorite dish of the evening. This curry is made from coconut cream instead of coconut milk. It lends an incredibly rich creamy smooth finish. You have sweet, spicy and creamy. What else could you want from a dish? I've only recently discovered my love for panang I used to do for red, yellow or green but glad I expanded my horizon.  Spicy Pumpkin Curry: This was my buddy Chris' pick. It was a red based curry with large chunks of pumpkin in it. There was a hint of pumpkin flavor but nothing to crazy and not a lot of sweetness. Now I do realize that in America we tend to sugar the heck out of anything with pumpkin but when in season, which we are at the tail end of, have a nice natural sweetness. I would venture to guess canned pumpkin was involved. Not a bad dish but far from my favorite.  Spicy Basil Fried Rice: Reading Jim W's review I decided to give this a try. It was very tasty. The texture of the rice was a bit mushy. The batch of steamed rice they used might have been a bit on the overdone side so the double cooking messed with the texture/consistency. Another great Thai marriage of flavors. Spicy from peppers, sweet from basil and richness from some peanut puree. Chris said it reminded him of pizza a bit, i looked at him funny. I took a few more bites and specifically one with a big piece of basil. I guess I could see it. There was some tomato flavor and the mixture of basil. Maybe a Thai pizza ;)  Pad Thai: Its not that I don't like Pad Thai. I'm just not usually one to order noodle dishes. My dad who is a well seasoned traveler loves this dish and has had it in more countries then I'll likely visit. Many places all over Asia and Thailand. He said this one was very good so I'll have to take his word on it. What I can say is that the noodles were done well. They were not mushy still had a nice bite to them.   Future Solo Meal: Thai Spring Rolls Tom Kha Gai Panang Chicken Curry   This was an A+ night.. with A+ food and B service. You can tell the girls were stressed and were doing the best they could so I can't get to upset at them. I tend to be much more understanding of under staffing at family run places. I would prefer them to run a bit slower then to hire people off the street who have nothing invested in the success of the place.   Pros: Great Food Friendly Staff Interesting Atmosphere  Cons: Slower Service When Busy Very limited seating. They have three tables and all the rest of them are 4 top booths. You are going to have a heck of a time with a group any larger then 4 at this place. They might be able to move a table and expand a booth to seat 7 but at dinner at a normal time your going to be waiting a long while for a booth and table to open up. Bit pricy for the portions"}
{"text":"My wife and I were VERY excited to learn that we are getting a vegan restaurant in Goodyear.  Tonight, we made our first visit to Sala Thai, soon to be Thai Vegan.  I had the Spicy Noodles with soy \"Pepper Steak\".  My wife had the Cashews with Vegetables with soy \"Pepper Steak\".  Both dishes were excellent.  The service was very good.  It'll be great being able to walk in and order anything on the menu without worrying about ingredients.  This is definitely a place we'll be visiting regularly."}
{"text":"Cute little restaurant tucked in a small strip mall.  Went here on a friend's recommendation.    The food we had: pad thai chicken, pad thai vegetarian, asparagus something and spring rolls were all yummy.  and huge and very reasonably priced!  the iced tea was nice and fresh brewed, too.  The decor is fun and you must check out the real fake fish fish tank!  No 5 stars because the service was a bit off and there was no option for brown vs white rice.  Will definitely go back when I'm in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Favorite Thai food in the state.    Start with one of the soups and move on from there (I recommend the Pork Wonton soup at a level 4 spice)  I hear the curry dishes are fantastic but I can't speak from experience as I tend to go with either Spicy beef with green bean or Thai Basil chicken.  (I'm more of a spicy meat and vegetable guy than a coconut milk guy)  My main tip for this place is for all of you drinkers out there.  If you have a hangover, and you want to cure it -   Step 1.  Get a cab here Step 2. Order the Drunken noodles at a level 4-5 (meat of your preference) Step 3. Don't leave until you've finished it.   Every toxin in your body will steam out of your pores and you will be left feeling amazing afterwards.  (I guess that bottom part is more of a drinking tip and than a Sala Thai tip - but take it if you want it)  Sala Thai is worth the trip."}
{"text":"I have been back on a few occasions since my last review.  The dine in experience was great as they do not charge you a fee for opening your bottle of wine. The food has been consistently good. I did find out that the employees do not get to keep their tips so there is no need for tipping. Now the bad.  I did a pickup last week of what I normally eat there.  Pumpkin curry with shrimp.  The times I ate at the restaurant I was served 8 to 9 nice sized shrimp but when I got the take out I found only 4 in my order.  This combined with them now charging you a fee to open your bottle of wine I have now revised my 5 stars down to 3. I will now be on the lookout for another Thai restaurant with good food, good prices, and no fee for opening my bottle of wine.  (I usually bring my own opener and glass as I am capable of opening my own.)"}
{"text":"Overall the food is good,and I LOVE spicy Thai, but when they ask you how spicy you want your food, they are WAY OFF on their number system. I always ask for a #4 on each plate hoping its spicy enough, but tollerable to eat and when I get my food, its not even a #1! This has happend to me at least 4 times, and it really sucks when I get all the way home with the Take-Out to figure this out. Now when I pick up my Take Out, I have to taste each container of food before I leave so I'm not disappointed."}
{"text":"Ordered lunch take out. Beef Pan Ang, always a winner. I love you can choose how spicy. I went with a 4 out of 5 spicy and it was great. Will be back again and again."}
{"text":"Great food as usual, their dipping sauces are some of the best, all with unique flavors that please the palette. Service was excellent and our server Aldo was outstanding. I would highly recommend Sala Thai."}
{"text":"Best Thai Food restaurant so far in Arizona.  Price are reasonable.  Clean and friendly staff.  I highly recommend to anyone who loves Thai food."}
{"text":"Wonderful service, I always order the Spicy Bamboo with Chicken, it is superb!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome Thai food! I had the Pad Thai Anne it was incredible. We had the spring rolls for an appetizer. They were delicious the veggies were fresh and the dipping sauce was sweet and tangy. My wife had the coconut milk soup and it was very enjoyable."}
{"text":"If you're going to Sala Thai on a Sunday and meeting other people you would do well to remember that there is light traffic on Sunday and you will get here early.  If you get here early, there is a Big Lots down the street where you can spend a few minutes soaking up an almost permeable seedy feeling.  Or not.  I would opt for not.  Or you can do what our dinner partners did and visit a dive bar for a drink.  It's just as well because Sala Thai does not serve alcohol.  I'm looking forward to the review on that one, Christine.  No pressure.  I was excited to try Sala Thai after seeing numerous strong reviews.  Overall, they did not disappoint.  We started with pork satay.  We had not seen satay offered in pork.  This was the least satisfying of the selections we had.  The pork was a little chewy and the yellow curry just didn't seem to go well with the pork.  We all shared four entrees.  We had spicy basil fried rice which was delightful and probably my favorite item overall.  I am hoping to have that again soon.  It had a nice balance of spice and fresh basil that was refreshing.  The catfish with panang curry was very nice.  It was the largest catfish fillet I have seen, cooked quickly so as to sear it lightly and some crispiness on the outside while remaining moist and tender inside.  It was heavily sauced and we ordered 4 out of 5 on the spiciness scale.  I think everyone at the table fought off a reflexive sneeze with the first bite of that one.  I would like to see how hot the 5 is, but keep in mind the 4 is pretty hot.  We also had pad thai which for me is a bit of a benchmark dish.  Sala Thai's was unique and very good.  Not overly sweet and with just the faintest hint of smokiness in the pepper flavor, rather complex for pad thai.  Rounding out the tour de Sala Thai was a duck curry with coconut milk, red chili paste, pineapple, basil, tomato and onion.  I'm not a fan of duck but this was very good.  I had several pieces of the duck and plenty of the sauce ladled over my steamed rice.  I recommend Sala Thai.  The sauces were so flavorful that Myles M and I mortified Christine O and Audrey W by licking clean every serving dish on the table.  Not really, but it was close."}
{"text":"Favorite Thai restaurant. My favorite dishes are yellow or red curry, spicy basil leaves with chicken, chicken clear noodle salad, and coconut soup. The flavors are perfect."}
{"text":"Really felt like trying a new Thai place in the area. Had good reviews, so we came here one Saturday night. Give this place 3.75 to be precise. It was pretty low key for dinner, quiet, 2-3 other parties while we were there. It was a cozy space for sure, we had a nice booth to ourselves. The fish tank full of plastic fish definitely added to the ambiance....  We started with veg egg rolls. Crispy and delicious. We didn't get a chance to ask if the sauce was without fish sauce...we were too hungry to wait for the gal to come around. For the entrees, We had our Thai staples - pad see ew and yellow curry. As always, I added baby corn. The noodle dish was good, however not the best. The Chinese broccoli was a bit too bitter and the flavor was a bit mum -- old nonetheless. The yellow curry - packed with yummy veggies and tofu, was a bit underwhelming. It was also had a tinge of sourness that we didn't enjoy. Could've been our tastebuds a bit off kilter.   Staff was friendly, space was cozy, prices decent. We may or may not visit again, but had a fair experience the first time around."}
{"text":"This place has reliable great food all the time, and is very reasonably priced for what you receive. The Coconut Milk Soup (Tom Krai Guy) is not to be missed, also their Drunken Noodles with Chicken is spectacular. I am a foodie and chef and decided to be active in reviews as a lot of awful food is getting good reviews, and  I'm not sure why, but we need to stop this"}
{"text":"We love coming here! It's in our neighborhood. Usually go at least once or more a month. Fav dishes are drunken noodles & green curry chicken!"}
{"text":"Sala Thai was the latest stop on my husband's and my quest for the holy grail, a.k.a. our search to find satisfying and authentic Thai food in Phoenix. I must say that Sala Thai is among the best places we've tried since we arrived here from California.   We met Jim W and Audrey W (our fellow voyagers on our Thai food search) for dinner at Sala last Sunday night. As Jim mentioned in his review, Sala Thai isn't nearly as far away from South Phoenix or Chandler as you would think it is, especially on a weekend night when traffic is minimal. The restaurant was decently crowded when we arrived, but we got a nice booth just a minute or so after.   It took us a while to decide what to order as the menu was huge and had a lot of new, interesting dishes like the \"Thai Egg Bomb\" (think Thai omelette, not the sulphuric smell released after eating too much Pad See Ew). After a long deliberation (thank you to our waitress for being patient with us!), we selected the pork satay appetizer, Pad Thai with chicken, catfish Panang curry, spicy basil fried rice with beef, and the duck curry. Just as at Swaddee (our favorite Thai place so far), we were asked to select a spiciness level from 1 - 5. We picked a different level for each dish, so we could see what the range of spiciness was like.   Well, as Jim also mentioned in his review, the pork satay was disappointing - while the peanut sauce was great and not too sweet, the pork was overdone and chewy. The duck curry was decent, although it was a little milky for my taste. I prefer my curry to have a thicker consistency and less coconut milk. The duck was great, though, with a nice crispy skin. Similarly, the crispy catfish topped with panang curry could have been improved with a thicker and more intense curry. The fish was good-quality, however, and was definitely a nice mild compliment to the curry's spiciness.   The real stand-outs for me were the basil fried rice and the Pad Thai. The Pad Thai had an almost meaty flavor to it (must be a different regional version of the dish than the sweet/sour or peanuty versions that are served at most Thai places), and was just the right level of sauciness. I was also impressed with the quality of the chicken. The basil fried rice was outstanding as well - the beef was perfectly tender and flavorful, and the crispy bits of basil added a wonderful flavor.   Since the curries are what keep me coming back to a Thai place, I was a little disappointed that Sala's weren't as good as those I've had elsewhere in the area. However, our meal was highly flavorful and enjoyable, and I would definitely rank Sala up towards the top of the places we've tried in Phoenix (see my list at http://www.yelp.com/list_details?list_id=Pa46iQOM92L75uQoyyuRlQ).   Jim and Audrey - I look forward to the next stop on our tour!"}
{"text":"First let me tell you that I ALWAYS get Pad Thai and it is very good here.  Thai is one of my favorite foods and this is the place we always go to when I am at home."}
{"text":"We have gone here plenty of times and each time the food is great.  I personally like spicy so I order drunken noodles level 5.  We do the chicken satay for starters then order meals. The different  food variety has something for everyone so try different things to see what best fits your taste.  If you have not tried this place and you like thai I highly recommend it.    I recently had family from out of town come in and they loved the food. We were able to put tables together to seat us all. The family is really nice and very pleasant."}
{"text":"Being from the food capital of the world, San Francisco, I am a second degree food snob.  I was stranded by circumstance in Phoenix for 18 months and couldn't find decent Asian cuisine.  Practically everything in Arizona is a chain.  I was very happy when Sala opened up in our neighborhood in 2006(?)  They let you order on a 1 to 5 scale of spiciness.  Being that people in the area had such sensitive tastebuds, we took a chance on the 4 and we were so happy.  The green bean dish with beef was out of this world - a nice balance of lemongrass, basil and heat.  Their green curry with chicken is bursting with fresh vegetables picked up from the farmer's market that morning.  The service is quick and efficient.  Towards the end of our stay in Phoenix, our little hole in the wall became increasingly crowded.  Going on a weeknight is a much better idea.  It's hard to keep a great place like this a secret for too long!"}
{"text":"Great food, one of the best green curry dishes I have ever had. The pad thai could be a little better but that's just being but picky."}
{"text":"Excellent red curry and blended Thai coffee.  Been here MANY times and keep coming back for more.  Very inexpensive & good Thai food.  It's under new management and they have improved the decor, but kept the same cook.  :)   A+"}
{"text":"This place is great. I just moved to PHX and I've been looking for a good Thai restaurant that serves up the real deal. I've been a few times to make sure that it deserves the 4 stars, and it does. It's fresh, friendly and delicious. It's definitely not a \"let's go out on a Friday night\" place, but it's great for lunch and low key dinners. I don't eat meat, so I can't vouch for that, but the shrimp dishes are really good."}
{"text":"Incredible food and service!  I had their pumpkin curry,  very good... unlike many Thai restaurants this one has a heat scale from 1 to 5 and I ordered a 5.  Now I like my curry spicy but a 5 might have been too much.    Try the green tea ice cream,  its delicious.   I will return to this gem."}
{"text":"When we want Thai food this is where we go.  Never disappointed.  Generous portions, fresh and delicious.  We have tried several items on the menu and everything is excellent.  Pad Thai and sweet Thai tea are my favorites."}
{"text":"Solid choice for Thai. We live in the neighborhood and have enjoyed their food many times. #43 highly recommended if you like curry dishes."}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite little hole in the wall restaurant in town!  Sometimes the service is slow but the food is consistently fresh and delicious!  I live on the west side and this place is 100% worth the drive.  The panang or pumpkin curries are my favorite."}
{"text":"OK, I've eaten here twice and gotten the same things both times - Shrimp Pumpkin Curry. It's amazing. I never knew I liked cooked pumpkin until now! The service is OK, but really it's the food that's great. The ambiance is what you'd expect at a Thai restaurant. Tonight was especially fun sitting next to the fish tank with about a hundred fake fish swirling around in it. It held my daughter's attention at least. I'm taking off a star for the prices, which I consider to be a couple dollars higher than I'd like to pay for a strip mall restaurant like this. In all though, I'd recommend it!"}
{"text":"This used to be our favorite Thai food place in Phoenix. We always go there whenever we are in phoenix. The food we ordered this time was too salty. I am a little disappointed that we lost one more fav places to eat in phoenix."}
{"text":"Delicious Thai food! I order takeout here all the time and it never fails to disappoint. Order medium spicy unless you really like to feel the burn! Pa nang curry is delicious, spicy basil fried rice and spicy green bean beef. Love the tom yum soup as well!"}
{"text":"This was our first time here.  I finally decided to give this place a try.  I had a party of 6.  We order 3 orders of chicken satay and it was great.  The peanut sauce rocks!  We ordered the pepper steak, sweet & sour chicken, pad Thai, and lad nah.  Everything we ordered was awesome.  My mom is Thai, so I know good Thai food, which is why i was hesitant to try a different Thai restaurant.  This will now be our go to place.  We used to drive to 43rd ave & Thunderbird from LItchfield Park (40 min drive) to eat Thai food, but now we are only 10 mins away from the real deal!  Service was great.  Everyone was polite.  Food is authentic.  Give them a try."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in the valley.  The service is unbelievable.  A little tip - if you ask for more shrimp, they will give you more, a little extra cost, but well worth the price.  All of their meals are great.  Love the Spicy Basil and Drunken Noodles.  Their soups are great too!  The staff is always friendly.  Great place!!!!!!"}
{"text":"For 22 years I was convinced I hated Thai food. Until I ate here and realized I was never eating the right stuff before. Sala thai changed my mind about thai food and now I crave it constantly!   My first visit I was greeted by the server with cool hair who recommended the drunken noodle and it was unbelievable. Now I am obsessed with their yellow chicken curry and thai iced tea. So the food is most important but this is a family business and one I feel great supporting. The guy with cool hair works every time I come in and always has a huge smile on his face. It's nice to see people enjoy their jobs. I only have positive things to say about all of their food, the cleanliness of the restaurant, and the staff. If you haven't been here yet... What are you waiting for?!"}
{"text":"Fantastic little neighborhood Thai restaurant. We're all about the Pumpkin Curry, but Sala Thai has a lot more than one dish to offer.   The atmosphere. It's intimate, with pretty much every square inch of wall space filled with kitschy artwork and memorabilia.  The napkins. Neatly folded in birdlike form with a fork inserted.  The presentation. Food is served in a manner consistent with a much more expensive restaurant.  The menu. Pumpkin Curry! What more need be said?  In all seriousness. I love the food. There is plenty of variety on the menu. Those in search of heat will find it. Those not can find safe refuge. Servers routinely ask for your heat preference on a scale of one to five, with five being hottest. Keep in mind it's an Asian scale. I'd suggest you go no higher than a three, my preference, even it you like your food spicy. Go higher at your own risk.  They will ask you to pay in cash if possible. We paid with a credit card on our most recent visit, without problem or comment. It's just a small business understandably trying to avoid high credit card fees. I'm fine with that if it helps keep their prices reasonable."}
{"text":"Authentic in terms of how the restaurant looks - not great - and how the staff treats customers - OK. The fish tank filled with plastic/magnetic(?) fish is just weird.  The entrees were OK but not go out of your way worthy. Pricing was fair."}
{"text":"While my food was ready when I was told, I guess I should have checked it before I left the restaurant. Both dishes were order with a spice level of 4 out of 5 and my friend Rice without peas or onions. Apparently, you can only get one thing you don't like omitted because the rice was loaded with onions. The spice level was 0, but came with a little container of crush pepper flakes. So I guess if I have to do it myself, then why ask? All in all, the rice was good but nothing I would go out of my way to go back for."}
{"text":"Great.  It's a nice little hole in the wall Thai place.  They make really great spring rolls and only had Pad Thai and Panang, but both are awesome!"}
{"text":"Really excited to have a new place to dine near home. Went tonight and I wasn't very hungry and really wasn't in the mood for jack, but had plans to meet a friend. So I perused their expansive menu and saw about 10 things I thought might be really good! Decided to try something off-the-wall with the thai omelette; meat, peas, carrots, and glass noddles inside egg? Why not!?  It was really quite good and did a great job of bringing me out my funk without trying to bowl me over.  The place was a small strip-mall location, but it was busy when there wasn't anyone in sight at the places around it. I'm not a Thai food connousieur, so I can't vouch for the authenticity. All I know is I had a good meal for a reasonable price and I'll go to bed happy knowing that I have a new dinner option nearby."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite place for Thai food. We ate here once a week when I was pregnant, because I craved it. The last two times I've gone, I've noticed a decrease in portions and quality of my favorite dish with a $2 increase in cost. It's disappointing and I will probably go here again, but will order something different."}
{"text":"Food was good, but service fell apart. Didn't realize they were closing and things stopped without notice. No dessert, to-go containers, no nothing. Had to beg for the check. Skip this place and try one of the many other options in the area. Was excited to try it, too, and I brought my out of town family in. Too bad."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Phoenix. Consistently, good food. I love the Thai BBQ chicken and the green chicken curry. Great fast, friendly service."}
{"text":"Best Seafood Tom Yum I've had . Very fresh and tasty. I really enjoyed the food and will definitely go back ."}
{"text":"This place was amazing to dine in.   I'm not sure what part of Thailand they are from but they nailed the Laarb spot on and even had sticky rice.  The spiciness was correct. When the mother running the kitchen heard they had a Thai person in the restaurant she came out to investigate. Again with that funky language dialect thing, she thought I was from Laos and chatted me up.   I wasn't expecting a special treat she had brought out to me. A small dish of dressed up fish sauce for my laarb. My GOD it was amazing already but this sauce just made me miss my mom's cooking instantly.   Once I found this place, it became the only restaurant I would order take away from. Phone orders were a breeze.  My husband wasn't a fan of hot food so I would just order him Pad Se ew and he enjoyed it thoroughly.   Here's a hint, if the Thai food needs to be hot tell them to make it Isan hot, not Thai hot. There is a difference."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. Had the coconut soup and phad Thai. It tasted like it was one of the \"instant\" bowls. I've had Thai several times in my life, I've even purchased some of the Thai instant stuff for my home. The taste was ridiculously similar. It wasn't a good experience at all. I won't be back, unfortunately. I was really excited about this place seeing all the reviews."}
{"text":"pad thai and hot and sour soup rocks! love this place!"}
{"text":"Great food and friendly service.  Love their coconut boba drinks!!  I've only eaten to-go from here, but the portions were large and delicious.  I am definitely making this my new go-to Thai restaurant."}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place to me. The atmosphere is good. Food is delicious and I would recommend the duck curry. The service is very nice they are always looking after the customer, making sure everything is alright. Good job friend on this pick."}
{"text":"This is a really solid great neighborhood thai restaurant. I always gauge a Thai place by their panang curry and theirs is awesome.  We ordered spice level 2 out of five and it was just right in spiciness.  It had a good heat but not too much."}
{"text":"You wouldn't expect one of the best Thai restaurants in Phoenix to be located in a non-descript NoPho strip mall but it does. Sala Thai not only serves up quick, fresh, dependable and competitively priced Thai meals (which come out with a spice rating of 1 to 5 based on your heat tolerance ... 4 is plenty hot), but the servings are such that I always have enough leftovers to bring to work for lunch the next day. Great value. And I put a premium on value. One of the intangible qualities of Sala is that it's become somewhat of a community driver, a third space where you're as likely to run into a neighbor as you are to leave with a full and satisfied stomach."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp, I was looking for a new Thai place near me. All the reviews were positive so...why not?! We were able to pick our seats so we sat next to the big fish tank full of little plastic fishies. Cute. Our forks and napkin were decoratively wrapped together...also a nice touch.  We ordered some of the veggie egg rolls to start. They were pretty good, very crisper and hot. For our entrees we both ordered drunken noodles, me beef and my son chicken. I had my heat at a level 3 but my son ordered a level 4. My dish was pretty good with some heat but not enough to overtake the flavor of the food. I can tell my son's food was hot, I could see it on his face, but he enjoyed his as well.   Overall, this is a good local place to grab some Thai food. Friendly staff, and not too pricey."}
{"text":"As they say in the industry, consistency is key. This place is always that. Very good food at very reasonable prices. They should add a liquor license, at least beer and wine but you can byob which is nice too. We live in #thesheaborhood and eat here at least 2x a month. Its a regular go to and in over 10 years has never disappointed. Kudos to Sala Thai."}
{"text":"This place is a bit hit or miss.  The Tom Kra Ga (coconut milk soup) is usually pretty good, sometimes better than others.....but always good. It's neat that you can get boba here. However, they recently started using smaller cups for beverages that aren't water. They still obviously have the regular size cups they used to use (they use them for water). It may not seem like a big deal, but now I'm literally getting half of the thai iced tea I used to and if you add boba, you'll drink it in 5 seconds. It is an extremely poor value and makes it seem like the business is cheaping out on the customer. Had drunken noodles that were really bland the other day.  The service is also hit and miss."}
{"text":"Yumyumyumyumyumyum!!!! So delicious but a little bit on the slow side for lunch. Never went for dinner yet."}
{"text":"I grew up in los Angeles, there are many Thai restaurants there, living in phoenix I've been able to find a few good eats, but Sala Thai is one of the best for Thai food.Best coconut milk soup in the valley by far. Tried a few Thai restaurants in the phoenix area, this one has the best flavor. Chicken satay with peanut sauce is great here too. Beverages..you can't have a meal here without trying the Thai tea, its delicious.I would have given them five stars but I have yet to try their pad thai.."}
{"text":"Another quick, decent Thai place, located in a strip mall, Sala Thai seems like a neighborhood spot that you go to when you don't want to drive far - it wasn't bad but I wouldn't  go out of my way to eat here.  All the food we tried was pretty good except for the green curry, which had an odd flavor that I couldn't quite put my finger on. It tasted grassy or more medicinal than typical green curry and it was quite watery. We didn't eat much of that, but the veggie fried rice, pad kee mao, eggplant stir fry, Tom yum soup and papaya salad were all okay. The serving portions were very generous and prices are fair. Service was very quick and while our server was a bit forgetful he was friendly and easygoing when we had to remind him about our requests.   I liked the aquarium tank filled with plastic fish. It was a cute, homey touch and honestly more entertaining to watch than real fish.   For dessert, we tried the coconut ice cream, which was a struggle to share, because it was so good. The mango sticky rice on the other hand had rice so hard that it was unpleasant to eat - it felt like it had been left out overnight without being covered. On the other hand, the mango on the rice was perfectly ripe and went well with the ice cream.   Overall, it was a decent Thai dinner, but because of the curry and sticky rice being off, I'm leaving three stars for now."}
{"text":"My husband and I initially judge any Thai restaurant on the Tom Kra Gai (spicy chicken coconut soup).  If they don't have it, we don't return.  If they have it, but it's only average, we don't return.  If it's fabulous we become customers for life.  Sala Thai has the best Tom Kra Gai we have found in Arizona.  We purchase take-out from here regularly and have never had a bad meal.  Some of the stand out dishes include Larb Salad, Angel Wings, Thai BBQ Sausages, Spicy Basil Fried Rice, and Pumpkin Curry.    Fresh?  Check. Authentic?  Check. Thai spicy as opposed to American spicy?  Check. Freaking delicious?  Check!"}
{"text":"Hands down best Thai food in the west valley! The food is the absolute best when you dine in on the weekends.  Be sure to try the drunken noodles or spicy string beans!!"}
{"text":"My preferred Thai restaurant. Very tasty. Accommodating staff. My husband orders the sweet Thai basil fried rice and adds the Chinese sausage - and it's amazing.  I do masaman curry chicken, it's brilliant.  My only issue is their hours. I went elsewhere this weekend because the other place was open at noon and Sala was not open yet."}
{"text":"Yummy yummy! Best Thai place I have tried in Phoenix! I had the coconut milk soup and I couldn't get enough. Seriously you got to try it! The restaurant is in a weird strip mall but don't let the location fool you- because once you see the cute little place it's decorated like a charm inside. Only tried one thing so far (and I will be back soon to try more)- but if you like coconut milk soup you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"A couple of reasons for my two stars. Mind you i am from NYC and also lived in Los Angeles for 5 years, both cities with the best Thai food ever. I had the Chicken Satay (DRY AS A BONE) it was cardboard on a stick. Shrimp Pad Thai- the noodles were soggy/overcooked. Sauce was watery and too sweet for pad Thai. Roast Duck with Tamarind sauce (special when I was there): it was a duck breast sliced on top of veggies and a watery Tamarind sauce. The duck had all of 3 slices that were edible. The rest of it- too much of it- was nasty, dry, and barely any meat. It was strips of dried out skin with bone fragments. Not worth $12!! The Thai iced tea was ok.  Service: the waitress was a young girl from England who was very sweet. But after all my food was brought out at once, no one came over to my table AT ALL to ask about how everything was or ask if I wanted anything else. In fact, since my friends were busy I went alone. I ordered what I wanted to try and knew I would have tons left over. The second waitress that brought out the food said \"oh, do you need help!!???\" (Eating all of it). I found that to be very rude. After the second waitress brought me the check, I asked the name of the young girl who took my order. Apparently she thought my pronunciation of her name was funny, because she went over to the corner of the dining room where their family and friends were hanging out and I heard her repeat the girls name as I pronounced it and they all burst out laughing and looked at me. No one thanked me or said goodbye as I walked out the door and they all clearly saw me leaving as I was the only customer in there at the time. I will not be returning after such poor service and dried out, amateur Thai food."}
{"text":"I'll keep it simple. For a strip mall Asian restaurant it doesn't get any better, especially in and around this part of Phoenix. My go to favs are Pad-Thai, cashew chicken, and pot stickers. My 4yr old nephew has been known to eat 10 of their potstickers, they are that good."}
{"text":"We went to try to eat there tonite after we called.  We were told the wait time was 25 min but that was not the issue. We were not greeted at all and not even looked at!!! It us rare to encounter rude Thai folks because they are generally kind..."}
{"text":"This is one of my and my husband's favorite restaurants in town. Every time we take someone there, they love it, too! And every time we try something new, it's better than the last thing. I typically get the Pad Thai, and my husband's fave is the Phad-See-Ew. I'm also a big fan of both the red and the green curry. You really can't go wrong here.  They expanded maybe a year ago, so it's been updated a little, but the place is still small and doesn't look like much from the street (or the strip mall it's' in). Still, the service is always good and fast, and it's BYOB. Don't miss this hidden gem!  PS. I like spicy, but a 2 ther (on a scale of 1-5) is still pretty hot."}
{"text":"This is an excellent little Thai joint, great for takeout, excellent Tom Kha Gai, Pad Thai is OK, Love the fresh spring rolls.    I'm a huge fan."}
{"text":"Yum! I just tried this place for the first time today and all I can say is delish! I like the decor, it's a nice clean atmosphere. They have really big booths that makes it comfortable to eat. Food is amazing! We ordered the phad se ew (my favorite Thai dish) so far its the best I've found in Phoenix since my mom's recipe. The basil fried rice was also good, rich flavors and the perfect level of spice! I think I found my new thai spot! I totally will be returning!    Oh and Check out the fish tank full of fake fish,  its interesting. Haha"}
