{"text":"A large double cheese, sausage, mushroom, and pepperoni to go for $29. It was OK but definitely not worth the price tag. Definitely will not come back"}
{"text":"It's a nice restaurant on Chardon Square. I've only ordered take out, and only the Vegan Nirvana pizza so far--I'm not a vegan but that's about as guilt free as pizza gets--and it's superb.  The price is a little steep, but I don't recall a better tasting grouping of crust, sauce and vegetables."}
{"text":"Ordered take out from here last night. This has to be one of the best pizzas I've ever had. Our friends were blown away also. Great crust & the toppings were perfect. Get the Quattro formaggi w/ sausage!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place and was happy to see it won best of cleveland pizza!!  they do have their liquor license now so it's no longer byob (but they sell $10 bottles of wine, so hey, not that big of a deal!)  i highly recommend the quattro formaggi with sausage and mushrooms, as well as the molto carne.  if you're not from the area i'd also recommend getting there early (or staying late) and taking a stroll around the quaint town square.  such a cute village feel."}
{"text":"Great pizza !  quattro fomaggio with sausage and  mushrooms !!  Nice and crispy crust on the bottom, slightly chewy on top and the toppings were AMAZING !!!!  Also had a salad that was really fresh and the dressing was perfect !!!  The staff was GREAT.  super fun and super nice and accommodating !!!!"}
{"text":"Had their pizza for the first time. Service was good and Flavor is there.  However, pizzas needed to be taken out 5 minutes earlier, a bit over cooked. Price is a bit high.  Will try again."}
{"text":"Very delicious! Agree that it was a difficult location to find (turn right at the light by the bank and continue down that road until you see it on the right). The pizza was really good and they had a great variety of classic pizzas and unique/different ones. The person working there was also very helpful and nice. Definitely plan to go back!"}
{"text":"Really good pizza!  This place is pretty close to my house, so it is the go to for dine in pizza.  It is pretty innovative, the staff is very nice.  Can be a bit on the slow side sometimes, but it is always good pie.  Give it a shot, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I'm from NY so I always say I'm a bit of a pizza snob, but Noce was probably the best pizza I've had since I moved to Ohio!  Staff was friendly, great menu, good drink list.  The owner (or manger maybe?) was there and asked us how our meal was.  He was also very friendly and it added a nice personal touch to the meal.  Only minor complaint.  It seemed TOO quiet for a pizzeria in my opinion.  I understand not everyone wants to eat in a loud pizzeria and I don't live in Chardon but I gather it's a fairly quiet area (at least compared to Downtown Cleveland... or NYC for that matter)."}
{"text":"Yes yes yes!  Thin crust, crisp on the bottom, slight chew under a great blend of cheese, garlic, and artichokes.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place has got to be THE best, if not one of the best Pizza places in Ohio.   Fantastic service! The waiters are attentive, prompt and friendly. Also, they make sure your bread and water is always stocked. The owner will stop in once in a while, and if he is in then will check on you. Really nice, and not much more you can ask for!  As for food + beverages -   Insanely priced beverages for a restaurant. A bottle of good wine. $15. Yes. A bottle. Not a glass.  And pizza - oh my god. Perfectly crispy crust. Not over done or underdone interior on the dough. Not too doughy or too thin - perfect classic. And just dripping with goodness and the best sauce ever! :D  Also, you can draw on the paper table cover with crayons - me and my friend had an intense game of hangman and connect 4 while we got out pizza! :D"}
{"text":"Amazing. The vegan nirvana was the best vegan pizza I've had anywhere! Many places have vegetarian pizza, but it's refreshing to have a vegan pie for my wife and I."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch the other day, man this place is the jazz! I got two slices of pizza, a pepperoni and a BBQ chicken. I have to say this might be my new go to pizza spot!"}
{"text":"This is truly the best pizza in the area.  They have a gourmet toppings that are artfully combined to make some cravable pies!  Our favorites are the Spinaci Primo and the Margherita but my husband just fell in love with the Molto Carne which is loaded with meats.  They have a really flavorful crust recipe that I wish I could replicate and all the toppings are fresh.  Try the salads as well because the caesar is very good and I hear people rave about the orange salad.    The place itself is realy small so get there early on the weekends or be prepared to wait.  Owners are friendly and try to make the (long) wait go quickly by serving some homemade bread/dipping oils and having playing cards at all the tables.    We go there for date nights as well as bring kids so it's a great spot for us!"}
{"text":"Tried noce tonight for the first time. Nothing special at all, over priced for what you get. We got a spinach Primo and a pepperoni. Thought we would be getting a real Gourmet Pizza definitely far from that DiGiorno in the oven taste just as good as their pepperoni pizza. Sorry but just very disappointed."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Geauga County. Be prepared to wait a while for your order because everything is made fresh. A bit pricey but quality is not cheap. Atmosphere is great. I'm sad they don't allow byob anymore but the have a decent wine list. The people are friendly and make this place a joy to frequent."}
{"text":"Very good pizza way better than papa johns or other delivery.  We ordered ahead of time and was ready perfectly for us.  We didn't try anything crazy we were feeding little kids so cheese pizza was the order and an adult pizza of bacon and pineapple which was tasty."}
{"text":"Cheese Slice and Lg Caesar Salad. $12. Buyer beware - the salad literally was romaine poorly chopped, three crackers wrapped in plastic, cheese and spicy dressing. It just didn't seem worth the $8 being a lunch salad. The pizza was alright.   Mall pizza is better than this place."}
{"text":"Best pizza and wedding soup ever!! If you've never tried this place you have to. The best food in Chardon!"}
{"text":"This is the best pizza around.  Sits on Chardon Square.  Not far Mayfield Hts.  Nice ride.  Great choices of pizza and salad.  Waitress are very nice and knowledgeable.  Got to go!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, glacial service, staff appear to be uniformly and philosophically opposed to washing their hair."}
{"text":"This place will last 2 seconds down here. Hey, lets open a pizza place by Crust and Edisons. Been trying to call and phone is continuously busy. :) nope. Wow. What Za. We're totally crushing on them not answering their phones. No omissions or additions in our best interet. Thanks for knowing what we like or don't like. Ahahhahh. Weirdo"}
{"text":"This is an awesome pizza, crust, sauce flavor and toppings are plentiful!! I ordered delivery and put in my estimated delivery time and it showed up with a couple minutes, perfect timing for a very hungry man. Would highly recommend and will definitely order from here when I'm back up here."}
{"text":"Apparently \"Gourmet\" in this case means \"you'll take what we give you and you'll like it.\" No substitutions and you can't leave anything off your pizza. Friday at 6pm - we wanted a Vegan Nirvana pizza. They couldn't make it for an hour because they were waiting to get artichoke hearts. We said we would take it without the artichoke hearts but they said they couldn't make it without all of the ingredients. What?!? I've never heard of a pizza place where you couldn't personalize to some extent. I get no substitutions, but no deletions? Not impressed. Now, all that said our friend went over and the manager was called. It still took an hour to get our pizza, which they delivered to Hotz's bar next door which was nice. After all that drama, the pizza was just adequate. We might have liked it a bit more if we could have avoided picking off onion which we didn't want in the first place. All in all, we were left frustrated and unimpressed. No way we would travel back for a pizza we can't personalize when so many other great options exist on the west side."}
{"text":"My family has been here twice in the last two weeks and we love it. They have amazing service. My dad waited a while at the store to pick up pizza to bring home and they offered him drinks and samples while he waited. They were so friendly.  When we got the pizza home it tasted great. The dough wasn't too puffy- the crust was crispy and had a great crunch while still being chewy. It was the perfect balance. We tried a few different types of pizzas but my favorite was the pepperoni and cheese. The cheese blend was flavorful and the pepperoni had a lightly spicy taste. Just what I like!! We also picked up salads both times and they were great. They give you ample dressing with carrots, cucumbers and onions on the side so when we got home we could just dump the salad topping we wanted on.  Great place and I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Joe Crea hit a homerun. Noce is the uppercrust as well as the best toppings served in a very pleasant atmosphere."}
{"text":"Working and stopped in for a slice. It was great! If I lived near it would be my go to pizza shop. Everything seemed very fresh and the crust was amazing. Looking forward to a west side location."}
{"text":"The most rudest people I have ever dealt with.   We had a party of 12 ! We know they don't take reservations but we come in all the time and the girl on the phone stated she would save the back room. (If you can't take reservations don't offer this up.)  Part of our party shows up and checks in, she says hold on , while our party is holding on she seats a party if 6 where we are suppose to sit. The back room  clearly should be used for a bigger party .  The hostess wasn't actually the problem . When we went to confront the manager he tells us not to make a scene and get out ! How rude. We would have spent lots of money in this establishment. I will say he said why don't you order pizza and you can eat it standing up !!!!!  We had a newborn with us and some kids. It would be impossible to do that and was very rude to offer this up.   This place will never have our business again !!!!"}
{"text":"We made the trip from Parma to check this place out. We ordered the Thai Chicken pizza. This pizza was good the service was great. It's a small place and they move tables quick here. While the pizza was good I have no clue how they justify charging $25.50 for the large. Even the large pepperoni was over $20.00. I've had good $10, $12, $15 etc. pizzas and I couldn't find what made their pizza so over the top. People love it though. We were there on a Friday night around 6:30 and it was packed.   They allow you to bring your own wine or beer and don't charge a cork fee which is cool.  Would I make the trip again? Not for $25.50 but it was good so check it out if you're feeling rich."}
{"text":"While I am, in fact, a Pizza Person I am not, upon reflection, a Pizza Snob.  When we stumbled into Noce Goor May Pizzeria, I was prepared with the Standard Three Questions:  What are they trying to do? Did they accomplish that? Did I like it?  I think what Noce is attempting is a fresh-ingredient, locally-sourced, high-faluten' 'za.  They make a point of explaining that each is made, from scratch, and to underscore that , theyplace a few decks of cards on each table signaling to the diner that they're in for a wait.  With only ten tables, and what appeared to be more workers than diners, it's surprising that is would take SO long to make a couple pizzas.  But hey.  It's their dream, not mine. (To be fair, I do think a huge slice of their bidness comes from take-out and perhaps delivery, as skeevy people hovered around the entry all evening, perhaps customers, perhaps employees, perhaps both._  They succeed on the food.  They fail on everything else.  We were \"helped\" by three people during our hour-and-a-half dinner, which took nearly a half-hour just to TAKE our order.  At one point, one of our party said, \"If they bus ONE more table before taking our order, I'm leaving.\"  They do offer free corkage, as they don't sell any wine; that's only half the story.  When we asked if there were any places nearby that sell wine, we were referred to Sheetz.  That's right.  A gas station.  To buy our wine.  Now, nothing says \"gourmet\" like buying your vino where you buy your thirty-weight.  Did I like it?  Nope.  \"Hating the Yankees is as American as pizza pie, unwed mothers, and cheating on your income tax.\" Mike Royko"}
{"text":"I love coming to Chardon square, especially at Christmas time.  We decided to get noce pizza for carry out again tonight, because it's pretty solid. We've eaten in once hear back with BYOB but now they actually have a liquor license but I think its only beer and wine, no worries. Which kind of bums me out cuz I actually like the concept of bringing your own wine.  So for the third time in a row I've got the pizza Caesar which is a pizza with chicken onion and garlic and all the other stuff you would normally thrown a Caesar salad except they give you a Caesar salad to jump on top of it. Ordinarily I kind of shuns the idea of dumping a salad on top of my pizza and by the way if you eat in the restaurant at the pizza comes with the salad on top of it. Not as crazy as you might think it's actually pretty refreshing with the cool let us on top of the hot chicken its not wilted kind of crispy kind of fun in your mouth. They recently expanded and the place is always busy every time I am in there which is a good thing. The only downside is that you have to park in and around the square with some time to give me a little bit of a hike but there are worse things in life. Noche is an awesome place but my only negative is that they are a tad expensive. The pizzas Cesar is $20.50 for a 14 inch pizza which is a little pricey but its not going to stop me from going back and getting one of the more awesome he says in the area"}
{"text":"Came here for the \"amazing\" Vegan Nirvana pizza. First, we called to see if we could simply remove the onions (as we get sick from them) and got a simple \"No.\" We decide to get it anyways and pick them off, and our first bite is a raw, pure piece of pizza dough! I can actually still form shapes with the dough, it's so completely raw. Chewy to the point of spitting it out, easily the worst pizza I've ever had in my life. Burnt crust and raw middle. Incredibly disappointed! Waste of money. Will never be coming back."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in Beachwood for pizza! Their pizza is thin crust, perfectly charred on the bottom, gooey, and delicious. We've eaten in, but it's also great for take-out. Their pies are large - way more bang for your buck than Geraci's, or Pizzazz, or Dewey's. Also, they sell by the slice, and that's hard to find here on the East Side, unless you're going to Rascal House or a low-end pizza joint. Great place to pick up pizza for the family."}
{"text":"Fantastic small place with great food, we picked a couple of slices from precooked pizza's and they were great, nice toppings, nice crust, price was good, we'd go back again, either for dine in (it wasn't anything fancy, just stools and a counter top) or take out"}
{"text":"A little on the pricey side but if you're gonna invest in this place, try something that's unusual to you, not the pepperoni pizza. I'm not a vegetarian but the Baja Roma is actually mind blowing; better than the Grecian if you ask me"}
{"text":"Awesome little pizza place. We played cards and enjoyed the Italian bread with dipping oil while our food was being made. We got there right before close but the staff and owner (I think) were super friendly and got us a table.  I had some type of spinach, pepper, feta and pesto base pizza that was really good. We would definitely go back and plan on it now that we've found it."}
{"text":"Great pizza experience. A bit on the pricy side but not too bad considering the great atmosphere and good service. The kids really seemed to love the table activities The crust is thin and crisp, somewhat different from most of the pizza in Chardon. I think I like the tomato sauce better at Joey's but this is still very good. A few things to keep in mind. The eat in area is very small and set up for parties of 2-4. If you have something bigger be prepared for a long wait. In that case I would suggest Joey's since they can easily accommodate a large party. I'm sure we'll be back."}
{"text":"Very Good pizza, just a tough location to find. Great addition to the East Side. Fresh ingredients and a wonderful chewy dough."}
{"text":"The pizza is amazing! I've always gotten it takeout, so I can't tell you about the service but the pizza is top notch. The last time we went my 2 year old was crying as we were waiting and the owner was really friendly. He offered my son cookies and treats for free to help him wait."}
{"text":"Not sure what others find as authentic. Very sour sauce and odd matza like crust. The owner, a man stopped by our table and was so arrogant we were left shaking our heads as we dusted the matza crumbs from our laps. Strange encounter and even stranger tasting pizza."}
{"text":"Truly gourmet!  There is pizza and there is pizza! This is made from scratch, from the finest ingredients, and done daily! Every bit of what they offer is done in-house and by hand.   If you don't like Noce, you don't know good food."}
{"text":"F*cking amazing. I love this place. Awesome pizza. I have loved every visit here. Play cards. No corkage fee. 'Nuf said."}
{"text":"Noce! I definitely expected more.   The restaurant itself is super small and dark.  It was clean and had ample seating.   We ordered a few pizzas and a salad. When the salad came out, it was really disappointing. I just wanted a regular salad, veggies and maybe some fruit. However, they didn't offer anything \"normal\" it was a regular toss salad that lacked any type of vegetables.   The pizza! The pizza was okay, the crust was delicious. But, not quite thick enough to hold the toppings. Or maybe it was cooked long enough. It was very mushy and hard to eat.   We wanted to try something different and local. So, we did. I don't think we'll be back."}
{"text":"After having tried about every other pizza place around, I made it to Noce and it's awesome. It's so awesome that I stopped to write this review.The pizza is fresh and beautiful, yeah they don't do custom orders but they have great choices and if you like a crisp yet chewy crust this place can't be beat.  I have now tried 3 different pies and still loving it.  If you have not tried this place I highly recommend it.   Update!!!! Now has a great selection of slices available so now I mix and match."}
{"text":"This pizza was absolutely wonderful! My husband and I loved every bit of our experience here. The crust is crunchy on the outside, yet soft and chewy in the middle. Just typing this is making my mouth water. They have a ton of great flavor options available as well. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"A coworker recommended Noce to me and I can't recommend this place enough! Easy to order, easy to find, and delicious pizza. Pizza is always piping hot and the ingredients are so fresh. We absolutely love this place!"}
{"text":"I've been to the location in Chardon and it was great. I ordered a plain cheese pizza and it had decent flavor but the crust was really tough and seemed too dense. I prefer a more airy curst, tbh."}
{"text":"Heard this won NEO's Best Pizza, so I had to check it out. It's not NY style pizza (at least NY street pizza--it's too thick), but it doesn't market itself that way and that's no problem. I got a simple half cheese/half pepperoni so I could judge the pie by its base ingredients.   The crust has a lot of natural flavor (no grease or conditioners), and a nice \"crunch.\" They added a generous amount of herbs and seasoning, and the sauce was flavorful, but could use a little more \"kick,\" in my opinion. The rim was flat and lacked the spring that would have given this place a 5/5. The cheese was baked perfectly.  TLDR: definitely one of NEO's top pizzerias, if not the best. Do check them out if you're in Chardon or willing to travel a bit for great pizza."}
{"text":"Can't imagine what anyone could possibly complain about when it comes to Noce. This tiny, takeout-only place, which recently opened down the street from me, is delicious - crispy crust, not too thick or too thin, with a snappy, crunchy crust (which I happen to like better than the soft, pillowy kind). My husband & I have twice ordered their BBQ chicken pizza, which we absolutely love & now struggle not to order, you know, every day.  Yes, there are other pizza joints in the neighborhood, & yes, Crust & Edison's are both delicious - but I think Noce is a serious contender for great pizza, too, & really, can you ever have too much of a great thing? Especially when it's pizza? If I'm being honest, I'll choose Noce over the other two for takeout from here on out. Much less of a wait than Edison's perpetually ridiculous timeframes, & I like their taste combos better than Crust's.   Welcome to the neighborhood, Noce!"}
{"text":"We were very excited to try Noce since they were recently rated the number one pizza in the Cleveland area.  Sadly our visit was a disaster.  The restaurant was busy but we were seated within 5 minutes.  Our orders of 3 pizzas, salads, and soup were taken promptly and the salads arrived very quickly.  There was no sign of the cup of soup a member of our party ordered and it took almost 10 minutes to track someone down to bring it to us.  When it came they asked every table in the room who had ordered it.  This seemed a bit strange but we figured since they were busy it was a minor hiccup.  The Caesar salad was one of the best I have ever had and the bread basket was fresh and interesting.  After about 45 minutes we inquired after our pizza since the table that was seated just before us had received theirs a while ago.  We were informed that the kitchen was busy and a bit chaotic.  After an hour we asked again and were assured that they would check on it and get back to us.  Ten minutes later after no one had returned we asked yet again and were told that they were checking and would be back ASAP.  This was repeated a couple of times.  An hour and 30 minutes after we placed our order our server came back and said that she forgot to put in our pizza order.  There was no way we were going to wait a further 30-45 minutes for our pizza so we said we were leaving.  We had to pay for our salads, soup, and soft drinks and then were coldly offered a certificate for a free pizza on the next visit.  At no time was a manager present and they did not make any real effort to apologize.   What should have been a great night out was ruined.  All of us were looking forward to trying their very exciting-sounding pizzas.  I understand that service problems happen but they saw that there was no pizza at our table and were asked repeatedly about it and never responded until it was far too late.  We will not be returning."}
{"text":"I am visiting Cleveland and actually using Yelp for the first time Nice had great pizza , and I am from New York. Also enjoyed the Spinach Salad. Great dressing"}
{"text":"I am a pizza expert.  I know this place has all the ingredients to make a perfect gourmet pie.  Unfortunately - both of our pizzas were overdone, and the taste of burnt crust overwhelmed any of the obviously premium toppings.  It was 55 bucks for 2 large pizzas - which is kind of expensive.  The pizzas looked amazing from above, and the toppings were good, but the crust was overdone.  I am sure we could have called and had them replaced, but on a Friday night once you are home the last thing you want to do is to go back out.  I might try again one day, but will check the box before I leave."}
{"text":"Great pizza, nice place, good prices. They do need to add something hot to drink. Coffee, cappuccino, hot tea. It is northeast ohio and chardon at that."}
{"text":"There are no other words that I love to hear out of my boyfriend's mouth more than, \"Do you want to grab dinner with my parents?\" because this place is always our go-to spot.  While I love that I never have to foot the bill in this case, the food would be worth every penny anyway.  And as with just about anywhere else I go, I absolutely love the margherita here -- but no matter which slice you've got on your plate, you surely won't be disappointed.  I definitely recommend stopping in here sometime!"}
{"text":"Pizza is top notch and the toppings are amazing.  I recommend the bbq chicken, thai and spinachi ..."}
{"text":"Finally - a five star pizza place in Cleveland.  Just wish it were open 7 days a week."}
{"text":"Great pizza. Nice staff. Expect to wait a while, but enjoyed the time with my family. Definitely recommended if you don't need a fast meal."}
{"text":"Noce is my favorite Pizza in Ohio! It is so good. My favorite is the margarita. But I can honestly say I have really enjoyed every pizza I have found. They also will do gluten free crust which is really nice! They have by the slice at lunch, which is great. BUT I will say.. they don't give you bread if you come at lunch time. Kinda made the soup not as good as when you get it at night. That is my only complaint. But other than that, the soups, salads, and pizzas are all fantastic. PLUS it is a super trendy cute little place and they let you draw on the tables like little kids. Can't be that!"}
{"text":"So far have gotten three pizzas from here and never have been disappointed. Girlfriend says the salad was also quite delicious. I would rate the pizza here better than Crust. Hard to beat Edisons, but these guys have less of a wait for your pizza by far."}
{"text":"First time here. Ordered two slices of pizza which were delicious. The only thing that makes me mark it down a notch is that it's a very dry atmosphere and doesn't have a ton of character. I though it was closed when I drove up due to the dark lighting."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge pizza fan so when I we first stopped in I wasn't looking to be blown away....much to my surprise I was! It is by far the best pizza I've ever had. Its just perfect! The service is amazing...probably some of the nicest service I've ever had. The wait for the pizza is a little long but they are basically making it from scratch. Its great for kids...coloring on the table paper and a deck of cards available at every table. You can bring in your own wine. Its just great! Chardon has nothing else like it and needs more places like this around."}
{"text":"This is fabulous thin crust pizza! The toppings here are so good, mozzarella is gooey deliciousness and the mushrooms are out of this world. But the crust is no slouch, chewie with a golden, slightly crispy crust. Having been born and raised in New Jersey, I never thought I'd get as good a pizza here in Ohio, but I stand corrected!    The pizzeria is small and tucked away from the street. They need to add a sign on Richmond so that more people don't miss out on some of the best pizza. Thanks to those on Yelp for alerting me to great pizza just a couple miles from my house.  I dinged them a star as it's not set up for eat in, salads are meh, prices are pretty steep given the atmosphere (for example, Crostata's is very comparable in quality & price, but has a beautiful full service dining room). Also, surprisingly they have no sautéed onions or yellow onions for toppings.  But still highly recommended."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza in all of Ohio. Fresh, gourmet, good quality food made with good quality ingredients. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, the location is close to work and the reviews seemed to indicate that the pizza would be excellent.  Unfortunately it was not excellent.  I wasn't even average.  It was edible.  But that's about it. I ordered two slices, the daily special, garlic cheese (it had a longer name but that was the basics of it), and the pepperoni. The garlic cheese slice was hard and dry. The taste was okay, but there wasn't sauce and so the experience was like eating two-day old pizza left to dry.  The pepperoni was better, but only marginally so.  The crust was a little softer but nearer the crust it was very dry.  I couldn't even eat the crust as it was too dry and hard.  So I'm sorry to have to report it, but this was not good pizza."}
{"text":"We found this pizzeria thru Yelp, via the \"highest rating\" filter, and we were not disappointed! We ordered the BBQ chicken pizza and it was absolutely amazing. I think we ate that thing in less than ten minutes. The bbq sauce was sweet and the pizza had the perfect combination of chicken, onions and peppers.   Of note, we ordered this using the yelp app and the email confirmation said our order would be ready in 60-70 mins, but when we called, we were told it would only be 30 mins.    Would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"If there is one thing that Geauga County was lacking - it was a really amazing gourmet pizza place. Noce has finally filled that gap.  Nestled between a couple narrow walls on the historic Chardon Square, Noce is easy to miss if you are not looking for it.   Given the small size, I would be reluctant to recommend the place for groups much larger than 5 people - but it may be worth calling ahead to see if they could accommodate you.  Though they do not serve alcohol, it is BYOB and they did not have a corking fee. I much prefer this to being over-charged for a cheap bottle of house chianti. We had plenty of wine for a group of 4 with a $12 bottle from the convenient store.  The mandarin orange salad was superb and even the small size was a decently large portion.  We ordered two pizzas - one of which was the Pizza Spinaci. It was very well done, with high quality cheeses and vegetables. The pesto sauce was tangy yet mild - not overpowering the other ingredients. The crust was thin-crust, similar to that of Italy or New York. None of that bread-like, doughy limp crust from many chain pizzerias.  Next time I'm back in Ohio - this will be one of the first places I'll want to hit back up.  My friends say every time they go, they are full. That is a good thing - these guys should not be allowed to close.  Buon appetito!"}
{"text":"It's true, it is tough to find.  Even my GPS was a little confused.  But, my experience here was def. worth it.  I had no idea what to expect, I had never heard of Noce before I saw it pop on my Yelp feed.  I did a double take- \"a high end pizza place near me that I haven't heard of?\".  So after reviewing the menu online, I pulled the trigger.  I ordered the Tai Chicken pizza and the Spinaci salad.  I was offered a free slice upon talking to the staff while I waited for my ordered, and eventually I agreed on taking a slice of the Rustic Roma Pizza home.  I also added a Caesar Salad to my order based on the look of it.   First the salads.  The Spanaci was good- spinach, red onion, feta, tomatoes and sunflower seeds.  The house made Basalmic was great.  The Caesar was also impressive, with a flavorful house made crouton/cracker, romaine, parmesan, and a lemon to squeeze on the salad.  But again, the salad dressing was great.  It is very strong, so a little goes a long way.  Extremely flavorful.   Now the pies.  The take home piece warmed through was really impressive.  The Rustic Roma is a really well balanced slice with garlic and feta and olives mixing well together. It's a great white pizza!   The Tai Chicken was good.  I was looking for more of the the peanut flavor the menu promised, but the chicken, red peppers, toasted sesame seeds and the chopped green onion provided plenty of flavor on their own. Red pepper flake gave it a nice little kick.  The crust on both pizzas were very crispy under the cheese, and nice and chewy at the ends.   The place boasts that is a gourmet pizza shop, and it is.  But it comes at a cost.   The salads run between 6 and 7 dollars, and the pies run between $15 for a small cheese to $29 for a large specialty pizza. They also offer pizza by the slice, daily and in the evening which is a nice amenity. I will be returning as a customer when I am looking for a pizza that isn't your normal pepperoni/sausage that is my normal go to."}
{"text":"I'm not a pizza person and this is the only pizza that I have ever really craved. So far i've only gotten take out but the little (and I mean little) restaurant looks like it'd be a good place to relax and have a leisurely meal with some friends.  Their caesar salad is one of the best i've had anywhere and the pizzas are very good. I've had the meatlovers, quattro formaggi with sausage and mushroom, and the wild mushroom pizza so far...the latter two tasted a bit the same which would be my only complaint but they were both still good. The pizza crust is thin and crispy and not too doughy."}
