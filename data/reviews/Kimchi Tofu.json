{"text":"This place is great! I live in the neighbourhood and its staple for lunch and dinner when I don't feel like cooking. It's the same owners of Tofu Village down the street so if you're familiar, you'll probably recognize some of the same side dishes and recipes.

The service is always fast and friendly.  Side dishes are A+ and the servers are always attentive to asking if you want more (unlike some places in Koreatown).  

A hidden gem! A must try if you haven't yet."}

{"text":"The place has been around for a while but it seems recently it's under new management.  It also appears their signature dish is soon tofu stew so decide to try it.  The flavour of the broth is good and appetizing but I personally prefer another place nearby.  The texture is smooth and silky, very yummy.  Also I was expecting calamari in the broth but I couldn't find any.  It does have other components such as shrimp, mussel and clam.  I don't feel much for the side dishes tho, and I feel the initial portion tends to be small.  The price is average I think, not overly expensive but there are cheaper Korean options in the neighbourhood.  The service is good as the waitress would offer to refill the sides.  I'm not sure if I will visit often as there are too many other alternatives in the area, but I will probably revisit one or two times to taste other fish.  Overall 3.5/5"}
{"text":"Came on a Sunday afternoon. It wasn't busy so servicer was very attentive. Got to pick any table and ordered the pork bone soup. Started off with 2 small pieces of kimchi pancake which was okay didn't really taste the kimchi much in it but it was fine. Had 6 other banchan before my pork bone came out. The server kept coming around to check on how I was doing and the food. The soup tasted yummy just like the one from tofu village! The meat was tender and the broth was delicious.  I'd come here again but to try to soon tofu next time."}
{"text":"In search for some food after our zouk dance class, my friends and I stumbled into this restaurant after noticing a Grand Opening sign. It wasn't that busy and we were seated pretty quickly by the friendly waiter.

One interesting thing we've noticed is that both the menu and the side dishes that were served were very similar to that of House of Soon Tofu (maybe the two restaurants are related somehow?). We ordered the Pork Bone Soup, House Special Soon Tofu and a BBQ Beef Hot Stone Bowl (I might be a little off in the naming). We thought they tasted alright but nothing super stellar in relation to the price (which ranged around $9-13, with some lunch specials around $8 and combinations at $17). 

I liked how everything was served nice and warm though and I'm a fan of the sweet tasting potato side dish. However, I thought they skimped a bit in the ingredients of my tofu soup and although cute, you had to refill your metal cups many times since they were so small. It's your standard decent Korean place but I have experienced better."}
{"text":"Best Korean restaurant for soontofu (spicy tofu soup) I'll say! I used to have bukchangdong tofu soup time to time when I feel like tofu soup, but they put so much msg and other stuff, I get sick :( BUT!!!! This place is wonderful! I don't get sick and I love their sizzling chicken and beef dish! Out of all the tofu soup, I like seafood tofu. Also tried hot stone bibimbab and it was awesome! + friendly server :)"}
{"text":"I think this is honestly the best korean restaurant i've been to! Good food, good service, good price and good location :') 
I'm so happy i found this place for my spicy soup and kimchi cravings!!! 

Their soontofu is the bomb!! Their other food is pretty good tooo!! Will definitely come again : )"}
{"text":"Word of mouth has it that it's under the same ownership as tofu village. They both taste amazing in the same way but this place as this awesome side dish that has a strawberry yogurt coleslaw. I could just have that everyday!!"}
