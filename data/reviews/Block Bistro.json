{"text":"Quiet a decent place for brunching and if you're a big fan of coffee and beer then they have something for you in the menu, a coffee flavored beer. Just swing by."}
{"text":"Overall great food and great service! Had the Crabcakes Benedict and would highly recommend. Staff was friendly"}
{"text":"I really liked this place! We came in for a rainy Saturday afternoon lunch and I had the chicken and waffles and he had the burger (see pic). Both were prepared well and very tasty. This place is located in the middle of a upscale neighborhood, so if I lived there, I would probably go all the time. It wasn't crowded at all so the bartender doubled as our server. I would go back for dinner, but the menu is much pricier for evening meals."}
{"text":"Great restaurant!  It's a hidden gem in Huntersville!"}
{"text":"This place is the greatest kept secret. I found it by accident with my daughter. We went inside and were pleasantly surprised by how bright and cheery it was. The food is truly EXCELLENT!!!! The staff is fabulous! I love their shrimp and grits. I believe it to be THEE BEST in the Charlotte area. I have been to Block Bistro numerous times, they serve brunch as well as lunch and dinner. I have loved every single selection I have tried. One of the most awesome dishes is their chicken and waffles with pepper infused syrup... OMG it is to die for. I could go on and on. The food IS AMAZING!!!  The menu is creative but not crazy. I went there with my entire family for Mother's Day brunch. Needless to say, my family was as impressed as I was!  Love that place."}
{"text":"This is the best breakfast in Huntersville. 

Tucked away in the Vermillion neighborhood, Block has rustic-industrial-country-French aesthetic with tall ceilings, brick facades, and hardwood floors. It feels more like home than anything else.  This place oozes character, charm and calm - a perfect breakfast retreat. 

On to the food. I had the stuffed French Toast. It was excellent. The portion was enormous, first of all, for just $10 bucks. Compared to other places like Toast & Cafe 100, Block already destroys them in terms of value, and easily exceeds them tenfold in terms of quality of food (seriously, no contest - I had the stuffed French toast at the Toastery and it was a sad joke in comparison).  

Block is a hidden gem. Its problem is that it's tucked away in a not-so-traveled location, so it suffers from a lack of visibility. But I have no doubt that once word gets out about this place, they're going to steal a significant amount of business from the very mediocre Cafe100. Until then, I'll enjoy not having to wait 45 minutes for a table. 

My only request: Can you get some light roast coffee? Also, some real creamer would be awesome, too."}
{"text":"Really great Sunday brunch! Menu has just enough options without being overwhelming. Nice laid back atmosphere, delicious food, and friendly staff! Perfectly tucked out of the way, just outside the city.  If we were local this would be our go-to brunch place!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal food! Great location in Huntersville. Food is fresh and delicious! Have been here many times and have not been disappointed!"}
{"text":"Chicken and waffles are off the chain!!! The atmosphere is great! They have options on the menu for everyone."}
{"text":"Geat meal. Wonderful service. Our server, Scott, went out of his way to ensure we were happy with everything.  Request Scott and you will not be disappointed. We will beback"}
{"text":"Omg.  Went there for the first time today (1/1/17) to celebrate the New Year with a group of friends for brunch. Atmosphere is awesome and the coffee was great.  The service was personable, but it ceased after the food was delivered.  No more coffee -/ only the check. I ordered The Block Benedict.  When The server brought it to the table, I thought it was a joke. The two eggs looked like they came from a bird, not a chicken. The Canadian bacon (if that's what it really was) was so thin and small it was essentially nonexistent. There was barely a teaspoon of hollandaise sauce on each egg. Finally the food was only lukewarm.  The fruit was good.  This was one of the most disappointing dining experiences I've had in quite some time. I had hoped this discovery would be a place we could go regularly with out-of-town friends. Based on this experience, I probably won't go back.  As a sidenote, the restaurant was not busy."}
{"text":"Very very good food.  Service great. Great neighborhood bistro. Heard brunch was amazing here."}
{"text":"AMAZING!! We planned an anniversary dinner this weekend and it was better than what we could've imagined. When I called for the reservation, Emily was so accommodating and patient. And she took care of us that night too! She waited out entire group (19 people) and entertained the kids with her mad Rubik's cube skills!! And the food was incredible. Not one complaint at all. The shrimp and grits was the best and was filled with shrimp. The steak was prepared perfectly medium rare. Even the kids loved their food. Thank you so much Block (especially Emily!!) we'll be back very soon!"}
{"text":"A wonderful little secret located in the Vermillion neighborhood below Harvey's.  The food is first rate as is the service.  Be sure to check out their weekend brunch which is perfect!"}
{"text":"Not sure why anyone would wait for cafe 100 when block is just down the street and has way better food with no wait. This is my new favorite brunch spot in town."}
{"text":"Dinner was amazing! We went Friday evening. We read so many great reviews on their brunch, we had hoped to have the same excellent experience. We did!

First, the fresh bread was the best I've had in a long time. Great bread usually precedes a great meal and that held true. 

The calamari and muscles were both done perfectly. My crab cakes were very tasty; very meaty, seasoned just right so the crab flavored came through and a very generous portion. 

My friend order the salmon and raved about it. Next time I'll try that. The guys had the pork chop and the Ruben. Both were happy with their choices. 

The service was very good and the prices were a good value. The atmosphere was wonderful. Tables were not squeezed in tight like most places so we had plenty of room and could easily carry on a conversation. They have a nice little bar that would be great to stop by after work for a causal drink and appetizer. 

Can't wait now to try the brunch!"}
{"text":"The food was outstanding- crab cakes, capresse salad, Charleston shrimp and grits for our group. Lara was our server and guided the way to a delicious meal.  Listen to Lara on wine decisions- perfect!

Don't miss this great restaurant with a charming decor and a meal that you'll never want to end!"}
{"text":"I had the shrimp and grits. It was quite tasty but it lacked shrimp. The portion was nice but I literally had 5-6 shrimp in the bowl. The chicken and waffles were literally frozen chicken tenders. They lacked seasoning. The waffles were good and their specialty syrup used on the waffles was delish."}
{"text":"Went today with family.  We were very pleased with the food and cocktails we had for brunch.  Wait staff was friendly and professional.  Kicking myself for missing out on the good eats served at Block Bistro.  Highly recommended and this is going to be a regular spot for us!"}
{"text":"I found this place while looking for a good, family friendly lunch spot near the discovery place since we were in the area. I fell in love with the rustic, clean, and pleasant atmosphere with swing jazz on the sound stmystem. Then I fell in love again when I saw the options on the menu--unique and sophisticated, but super approachable. We went with fried green tomatoes (which were perfect), a ceasar salad, and dijon maple glazed salmon with spinach and sweet potatoes. The food was fresh, prepared to perfection, and the service was on point. I can't WAIT to come back! This is truly a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Brunch is great!

Chicken and Waffles with the chili infused syrup is amazing!
French toast on challuah bread is also a great treat!"}
{"text":"Expectations were set a little high based on the look of the place and some of the latest reviews. That being said, they get an 8 for atmosphere and ambiance. The exposed brick wall lined with multiple double glass doors leading to the patio area. The interior dining area lined with multiple
String lights all work together to set the stage. 
And then the failures begins...
Besides never getting the complimentary basket of bread which all other tables seemed to receive and enjoy, they have 5 appetizers. None of which have a description in the menu. So if you're looking for fresh classic calamari, go somewhere else as they toss theirs in a sweet Thai chili sauce. That appetizer wasn't too bad, the problem was really with the fried green tomatoes which were clearly cooked from a frozen state. Under the heavy fried breading, the tomatoes were mush and didn't hold up to the reheating process.  After that we had a chance to really sit and take a look at the place as our entrees had no intention of showing up any time soon. 
\"Sorry about the delay, but the bar is slammed.\" Was the apology received from serving staff. After that comment our worst fears were realized.  This establishment had a single kitchen serving the sports bar upstairs as well as the dining patrons downstairs. The bar food took precedence over everything and this was a bar food cook attempting to achieve upscale dining fare. 
Our entrees finally arrive (8oz filet & 10oz steak), both unevenly cooked and over-salted.  We even saw the same dish I ordered come out 3 different ways which goes to show inconsistency in plating. The food was edible, but an experience that doesn't need repeating."}
{"text":"I ordered a Shaved Prime Rib sandwich. It was just so delicious with its horseradish sauce. The best sandwich I have ever had since I moved to NC."}
{"text":"Very friendly star. Super cute & quaint place in a residential/retail neighbirhood with a farm-chic feel. Shrimp & grits were fantastic. Good portion size--not too little or too much. Western omlette, fresh fruit & toast was great also."}
{"text":"Great service and superb food. We found this place at the last minute and what a joy it was. The portions and nice size and perfectly seasoned. Shrimp and grits & crabcake with fried green tomatoes and eggs are a must try!"}
{"text":"DO read and regard other reviews! As I write this we have been here 25 minutes for brunch on Sunday morning. It took 10 minutes just to be asked for our drinks order and the person started by apologizing as he is the only person waiting on tables (and seems to be doing other things as well, just as observed on another review). I find all this interesting as another person posted a review only one hour before this and mentioned no wait. No wait for a table perhaps, since there are at least 4 tables open (and not many to start with) but the wait here is absolutely intolerable for service. There are at least 3 other tables also waiting for food who were here before we arrived. We will not be coming back. Let's see what the food is like when it does come. Well, the food arrived. Basically the essence is, served lukewarm, nothing special, decent flavor but lots to improve on. For example, the gravy on the sausage biscuits was tasty but it looks like the gravy must be in short supply because the amount served was poor to say the least (photos included). The Florentine Benedict was so-so with one half looking particularly sad in what looked like the leftovers of an english muffin. The Belgian Waffles were too dry. The Home Fries with rosemary sounded tasty but also were served lukewarm and just ok. There is potential but the crew need to really up their game.

Take this review for what it is, just an honest review of someplace we were looking forward to trying out but will not be going back to, will instead stick to breakfast at Toast Cafe in Davidson or Bad Daddy's in Birkdale or Alton's in Cornelius."}
{"text":"Excellent Shrimp and Grits which one a reward at the Queens Feast! Not too spicy. Enjoy a great meal there and then going upstairs for drinks."}
{"text":"Coming from upstate NY I had always fantasized about what I heard called CHICKEN AND WAFFLES, Block Bistro fulfilled all that I imagined and more and I am going back again this coming weekend for more"}
{"text":"We finally had a chance to check out Block bistro and we will definitely be coming back to check out the brunch. We were the only table in the restaurant, which was odd for a Friday, but the service, atmosphere, and food were all great. We had the grilled avocado and fried green tomatoes to start, both of which were delicious. While the beer selection is quite small, they have a few solid local choices, and their wine selection is more expansive. 

For dinner I had the shrimp & grits which were amazing. So many places screw that dish up around here, Block's is perfect and slightly spicy to give it that southern edge. My fiancé had the prime rib and it was delicious as well. The pomme frites were cooked perfectly and not over seasoned. Our friend got the crab cakes and it was nice to see the cakes full of crab and not filler. Prices are fair for what is presented and I would definitely recommend Block to anyone. The only \"downfall\" is a strange parking arrangement, but that's not really a big deal. Hopefully the lack of customers was just a one-off occurrence as we'd like to see Block stick around."}
{"text":"I was disappointed in the chicken and waffle. I'm still looking for the flavor of a good battered waffle. The chicken was not seasoned. The chili infused syrup was blah. I think they were trying to let the syrup be the show stopper but failed. Coffee tasted like it was watered down. Staff however was phenomenal. I think I'd need another visit and just stick to an omelet instead."}
{"text":"My mom and I went for brunch today,  we are not familiar to the are  so we were a little bit confused about the location, well don't be , you might think the gps is crazy but no, the place is very small and I loved it! I will definitely be back maybe for dinner next time! We did order a ham and cheese omelette and waffle with bacon, the omelet was heavenly and the waffle was delicious as well, the only thing I found bad was the coffee but that is because I don't like coffee maker coffee, since I'm a barista I'm picky about my coffee!  Now the service was great, the guy who served us was very nice  too ."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Tuesday and we were the only people there! What a shame because the food was awesome. We started with calamari which was lightly fried with panko and had a very well seasoned sweet chili sauce. I got the crab cake sandwich which was awesome. Big crab cake with lots of meat. The side of sweet potato mash was well flavored. My friend got the shrimp and grits which she thought was great but I didn't try it myself. Overall, happy with the food!

The decor was nice- a modern rustic look. I brought my 16 month old with us without a problem. Only drawback was the bathroom smelled like it really needed a good scrubbing."}
{"text":"I can't... I just can't agree that this place is worth driving to or spending money on. Let's break it down....

Waiting to be seated with open tables is always annoying. The problem here is that here isn't a host and the servers/bar tenders are taking on the role. 

Coffee. For a bistro who likes to promote brunch, just spend the money on real coffee beans. Again, i would assume this is a Sysco/Gordon product that they get cheap. The only save is that it was $2 a cup and I got free water. Creamer couldn't even save it. 

Chicken and Waffles. Decent waffle here but I'm totally confused why my knife couldn't cut it. A bit chewy which was okay today but I could imagine it angering most. The chicken was from frozen and had heavy breading. Salt was the flavoring of the chicken tender, it might be better made for gravy. The syrup was just sweet, not \"red pepper infused\" as stated  on the menu. At $12 bucks it fell flat. Not a \"send it back\" bad but a \"won't order it again.\" 

The brunch drinks are also part of the push. Although I did not order any seeing them made at the bar made me disappointed for the recipient. The sad bloody marry only had a lemon and two olives. Lame. 

The restaurant is nice inside but the open space is loud. The wait staff don't have sections and they just take tables as they go. The bartender took a call and let the caller know there were only two kitchen staff; that explains so much. 

Not terrible but noting to write home about, just Yelp about."}
{"text":"We have been to Block Bistro several times, it never disappoints. Our waiter is usually Scott, he is fantastic.
I had the filet for the first time and it rivals for the best I've had in the Charlotte area, that's saying a lot from a girl from the midwest."}
{"text":"Creative  eggs Benedict, but would like to see a few other breakfast options! We had the crab cakes egg Benedict,  biscuits and gravy, and French toast. 

Egg Benedict would be the only thing I would go back for."}
{"text":"Just waited over 10 minutes with no hostess in sight for our group or the 4 other groups waiting.  Completely unacceptable. Several employees walked by or through with blinders on, couldn't even reassure us that someone would be out soon.  I get that brunch is a busy time, but ignoring 15 people in your waiting area is never okay."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service.  Good to have a great restaurant in the neighborhood.  Paige was a well-informed and gracious server.  We enjoyed the calamari with Thai chili sauce.  A little heavy on the breading but acceptable.  The salmon and crab cake entrees were well-prepared and throughly enjoyable.  We'll be back to try other things on the menu.  Hard to believe there weren't more people there on Friday night although it was starting to fill up as we left around 8.  May be a little hard to find if you don't live in the Vermillion development but well worth it."}
{"text":"I stopped by with some friends and we were hoping to get brunch. They only have it on the weekends, which was a bummer but it's okay! First impression: this place is so cute and the decor is perfect. It is in such a nice and unique place. I got the Crab Cake BLT and a side of fries. The fries were so well seasoned! The bread on my sandwich was beautiful and was the perfect crunch as well as chewy. The crab cake could have used a pinch more salt to bring more noticeable flavor to the crab cake itself. The service was quick and he was very attentive. I will be coming back to try the brunch as well!"}
{"text":"I had the Charleston Shrimp and Grits and it was good. Justine was nice and friendly. The establishment was nice and clean. The food was hot, the shrimp was big and had lots of bacon in it as well."}
{"text":"I ended up at this hidden secret due to a lunch invite from a friend who sung praises of the restaurant.  She enjoyed the shrimp & grits, which were very tasty.  I had the crab cake Benedict, which I cannot wait to try again.  The crab cake was full of flavor with minimal filler and the fried green tomatoes were a great crispy compliment.  

So why is this a rave review BUT only four stars given?  Unfortunately both eggs were overcooked and I really craved the creaminess of an over easy egg!!  If I wasn't starving that afternoon, I would have sent it back.  There was also a shell in the food - not the worst that could happen but definitely glad I caught it before taking a bite of it.  

All in all I think those issues are easy to overcome & I look forward to making it back."}
{"text":"First time here .. Discovered on Yelp. Tasty brunch. Good service and prices . Grilled avocado was yummy. Would definitely eat here again.

{"text":"Great food, chill atmosphere, excellent service. I would recommend for anyone who is looking for a place that has amazing food and a chill/ calm vibe."}
{"text":"The best chicken and waffles!! We go here for Sunday brunch often. Mimosas are great and the food is incredible. We found coupons on Groupon and have brunch on weekdays now too. Highly suggest!!"}
{"text":"I want to point out that it's the cutest place I've been to in a while. My boyfriend and I found this place by chance and it has become one of our favorite weekend brunch places. The service is phenomenal, they always greet us immediately. Always happy and enthused. I would and have recommended it to several people! Disregard the negative nancy reviews that are on here . I would highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I am in Charlotte visiting family, and I was very impressed with the dinner here. The atmosphere is very welcoming and refined, and the service was prompt. The serving sizes are neither too large nor too small. The menu is diverse and had options for all taste. My burger was cooked exactly as ordered. It is my understanding that this restaurant is new on the block (Pun intended), and I hope that many more people will give it a chance. I will certainly return whenever I visit."}
{"text":"Disregard ANY other reviews. After waiting for 40 minutes at another establishment, we decided to try out Block. Excellent decision. 
The sausage benedict tasted like I was being spoon fed by an angel. The home fries had the heavenly taste of just coming off the majestic grill.  The 100% crab cake blows most restaurants out of the water, mostly because they are too cheap to purchase real crab and misleadingly use imitation meat. 
The atmosphere is very welcoming as is the staff and service. The decor provides itself for any group outing, romantic brunch, or a little hair of the dog. 

It truly is \"classics done right\". Enjoy my friends."}
{"text":"Cozy and quaint resturant. They were awesome making substitutions for my food allergies. Instead of just offering grilled chicken the chef was great offering the same dish with the herbs in EVOL instead of the white wine reduction sauce. The sweet potatoes and asparagus were so tasty."}
{"text":"The fam woke up early for brunch. We arrived just before 9am. We parked on the street and waited for the restaurant to open. We were the first customers that day and were welcomed immediately upon entering. We had two wonderful ladies serve us. I wish I remembered their names. They were very friendly and responsive.

The restaurant is open and clean. It has a nice, relaxed atmosphere. They offer outdoor seating as well. Saw stairs leading to a second floor, but I do not know if there's seating upstairs. 

After a few minutes with the menu, we decided on the following:
Coffee
Spicy Bloody Mary $7
French Toast $8
Charleston Shrimp & Grits $16
Country Benedict $10

My son ordered the french toast. It came with 3 slices of challah and 2-3 pieces of bacon on the side. We asked for more maple syrup and was brought syrup right away. This was probably the fam favorite. My son tried his best to finish his plate, but left half of the french toast. He wanted to take it to go, but the SO and I devoured the remaining. Whoops. I was in the mood for something savory and hearty. My country benedict was just that. It was served with a biscuit, sausage gravy, two poached eggs, and a side of fruit. It was good, but I probably won't order it again. I had a few spoonfulls of my SO's shrimp and grits. I thought it was creamy and delicious. Had plenty of shrimp from what I recalled. I tried all, but the spicy bloody mary (not a fan of BMs in general). The SO liked it, but was not wowed. 

We all left fairly satisfied. Reasonable prices, good portions, and excellent customer service."}
{"text":"Small town cafe hidden in a neighborbood in good ole HVille. Hubby and I got here right when they opened on a Sunday morning. Definitely no crowds, just one other family seated, so we were seated right away. Interior is rustic, farm-like. You feel like you're walking into a Home Goods/Pottery Barn restaurant. Service was prompt and friendly. We ordered the Stuffed French Toast and Crab Benedict to share. I opted out of the bacon and they substituted it with fruit :) The French Toast was a bit dry but I did enjoy it on the challah bread they use. Crab Benedict was better and I wish I had ordered that instead of the french toast. Flavor just right. Not over the top with the seasoning. However, the did go a little overboard on the hollandaise sauce. The english muffin was an option also, but I highly recommend leaving it out. The less gluten the better right?"}
{"text":"Service here is great and I love love love the location. Came here for Sunday brunch and was rather disappointed in the stuffed French toast. Putting a super super thin layer of strawberry cream cheese does not make it stuffed in my opinion. Couldn't even taste the cream cheese and had I known it was going to be like that I wouldn't have ordered it. My boyfriend ordered the same thing and was also throughly disappointed."}
{"text":"What really made me upset was that I left my debit card at this establishment.  When I realized I left my debit card, I called back and talked to the waitress that served me.  She promptly said that she had my card and had called my bank to have my card deactivated. WHAT??!!  When I got there she said that I simply need to call my bank to have it reactivated.  I called and guess what... It is PERMANENTLY deactivated.  So now, I have to wait 5-7 business days for a new card since my bank is in California.  I called the manager to complain.  I will never visit this establishment again and will tell all of my friends about my terrible experience.  I feel that the waitress stepped way out of bounds calling my bank and basically locking me out of my own account.  Totally outrageous.  What was the point of me coming back to retrieve my card? WILLL NEVER EAT HERE AGAIN!!"}
{"text":"Be prepared to wait, the hostess will seat you but there's no hostess at least not during brunch. They literally had us waiting at the door, no one came to greet us. The mimosa was decent the food was ok, nothing memorable about this place and wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Food is good but not great and the atmosphere is spacious and gives you a lot of room but unfortunately it stops there.

Service is abysmal and the noise level is high.  Arrived just before lunch today to give them a try.  Were seated promptly but then the long wait began. Probably four other tables were taken, one of which was a jewelry party and one by a rather large party which left shortly after we arrived.

Problem was the had only one server was was both seating customers, acting as a server and bussing tables, all at the same time. We say at least three other employees while we were there but none of them jumped in to allievate the situation.

We did finally get our beverage order taken and it came out pretty quickly and the coffee was good. My wife ordered the quiche of the day which was a tomato spinach while I had the Chicken and Waffles.

The quiche was primarily just a staight quiche with only two or three bits of tomato and little else thrown in.  My Chicken and Waffles consisted of four quarters or a very small and very thin waffle along with two small breasts of chicken which appeared to come straight out of bag.

The potato sides were not bad but a little on the undercooked side.

Restaurant has potential but it has a long way to go to deserve anything greater than two stars."}
{"text":"We came during restaurant week which can sometimes impact service at restaurants but not here. Service was great, food was delicious-everything we ordered and decor was nice. No booths though in the dining hall. A little hard to find."}
{"text":"First visit here for lunch on a Tuesday.   Menu was simple and had decent selections.  Service was excellent.    I had the Ruben it was pretty tasty but the bottom piece of rye bread was a too soggy for me as it made eating the sandwich a soppy mess.   

The fries are super delicious. 

I heard the brunch here is very good.  Btw, for lunch they offered to make an omelet.   

No wait, is spaciously small so if you can find this place in Vermillion, you should enjoy your visit"}
{"text":"A group of 4 of us went for dinner on a Saturday night. We got a reservation since they had that option but it turned out it was not necessary since there were only about 15 people there. 

We were promptly greeted and got in our drink orders. I ordered a martini and I think they had to collaborate to get it made, but it was tasty. The others in our group ordered wine and another cocktail, and we were all pleased with our choices. Wine is reasonable, but leans toward the higher end, and the drinks leaned toward the lower end of the price spectrum.

ON to the food....My wife ordered the salmon and I got the crab cake dinner, so we could each share with the other. The salmon was fine, but unremarkable. It does come with sweet potato puree which was very very tasty. The crab cakes were quite tasty - so much so that my daughter who doesn't like ANY seafood thought they were good!

My daughter ordered the filet, which was the priciest thing on the menu, but was very good with tasty red bliss mashed potatoes, which were delicious as well. Our son-in-law got the hit of the night - the Beer BBQ Pork Chops. The glaze was amazing and the pork was perfectly prepared. I'd highly recommend this dish and the crab cakes. 

Service was good overall. My second martini was not good, so I mentioned it to the server and she gladly delivered a new fresh one that was excellent. A couple of people in our group substituted asparagus for the vegetable de jour that was offered, and it was taken care of with no up charge - nice touch.

Overall a very good experience in a quiet and relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"Welp, I'm from the Gulf Coast. So...maybe it's unfair that I ordered shrimp & grits here..however, I did. It was $16. The sauce is good, the grits were not special, and the shrimp didn't taste like anything.. plus a bit over cooked. Even if everything had been perfect, it's a $13 dish at most. Skip it. The chicken and waffles my friend got looked awesome. He raved. The french toast also had a good review at our table. The sausage patties were inedible and burnt. The decor is really cute inside and was busy around 1030am on a Sunday."}
{"text":"This place is definitely the tucked away and in a strange location but totally worth it! We went for restaurant week and the food and wine were amazing. I got the shrimp and grits and it was fabulous! Very small intimate atmosphere and great service. Fancy dining feel on an average budget, looking forward to trying their brunch."}
{"text":"We went for brunch and did not like the food. The restaurant itself is a neat idea but the kitchen needs to go back to the drawing board. Some of the dishes were not well paired in ingredients."}
{"text":"First off, AMAZING BRUNCH! Two friends and I went on a Sunday and were seated right away. Our waitress was great at giving us suggestions for what to order and the food was nothing short of great! Between the three of us we had waffles, bacon, grits, biscuits and gravy and the stuffed French toast. Everything was flavorful and so yummy! Plus the mimosas were a great addition."}
{"text":"A hidden little gem! Went for brunch on Sunday. Wasn't sure what to expect when the GPS had us turn into a residential development. So happy to have found them. Food was wonderful. Was busy so we had a small wait. Love how they use the honor system in place of a hostess. Standing in line was fun. Got to talk with the others waiting. Got the chicken and waffles. The spice was a nice complement. But the best part by far was the grits. There's some about Carolina grits. You cannot get that goodness anywhere else. A must try!"}
{"text":"The service was pretty good. The food was good. Although, the chicken and waffles left something to be desired. I was hoping for real chicken but instead got breaded chicken tenders. Not crowded at all on a Saturday afternoon. Cute place nestled in a residential neighborhood. Good for kids."}
{"text":"Second time going there and it did not disappoint at all. First time was for brunch, chicken and waffles and the stuffed French toast. Went for lunch this time and my wife got shrimp n grits and I got the crab cake blt and frites and both were absolutely amazing. I will continue to go here, the food and the service are outstanding. Highly highly recommend"}
{"text":"Went there for a Sunday brunch, neatly to say will NEVER go back ever again. The service suck for them to be super slow. To make matters worst the Food is disgusting and cheap quality bar food."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast on a Saturday and had a fantastic meal with great service. I live in the neighborhood but have avoided this place because I'm not a fan of Harvey's. This place is awesome. I'm so glad I went and I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"Fun place to have brunch, good food, tasty Bloody Mary and friendly service always making sure you are satisfied. The patio is also a great place to have a dog friendly meal, please bring it back!"}
{"text":"Had brunch  here and it was perfect.

This place is just 15 minutes away from my house in Huntersville tucked away in the middle of a small neighborhood. Free parking. When we got in, we were immediately seated without a wait. It was nice and quite. We sat outside on the patio and the weather was great. 

I had the chicken and waffles which was really good. The syrup even had a kick to it. My wife had French toast meal which was also good.

We'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"We made a reservation to come here for brunch on Mother's Day- oh boy I'm glad we did!! If you don't mind that it's located right in a neighborhood in the middle of townhouses, which I thought was really cute. And the gorgeous scenery outside was also perfect too for Mother's Day pictures(: We were seated outside since it was a beautiful day, our server was very nice. I settled down on ordering the stuff' French toast, OMG ITS HUGE YALL. And I mean HUGE, 4 big slices of bread stacked on top of each other, it's VERY filling trust me. It also came with a side of hash browns which was my favorite part, they're more like tator tots. They were sooo perfect, crunchy on the outside & soft in the inside. I think the best tator tots I've had! I tried some of the grits, and waffles ahh I love the waffles!! I think this just became one of my favorite brunch spots, found me a keeper lol!!"}
{"text":"Bought my parents for brunch. Excellent service. Dad raved about the waffle and sausage. I enjoyed the crab benedict. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Loved the crab cake Benedict ! The fried green tomatoes gave the meal a nice texture ! I will be back !"}
{"text":"Really cool restaurant tucked in the center of a neighborhood. Brick building on the outside with an industrial look yet cozy on the inside. Our server was genuinely nice and efficient. We have only come here for brunch. The food was good. Will like to come and try lunch or dinner. They have a small yet cool bar, that looks like a fun place to hang out with a couple of drinks."}
{"text":"We love love the grilled avocado, seafood specials, and brunch. There is usually not a wait because it's a hidden secret."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner after looking for a new place to try for a date night.  The ambience is welcoming with a good music level and low light.  The service was friendly and well timed.   The wine menu offered a good variety of options at reasonable prices.

The highlight of the meal was definitely the food.  We've eaten at a lot of good restaurants in Charlotte and the Lake Norman area that we've definitely enjoyed but this was a step above.  The amount of flavor in the food was outstanding and everything was well balanced.  I had the crab cake entree which was outstanding, the crab cake had no filler at all and was packed with flavor.  My wife had the special which was crab stuffed trout with wild mushroom risotto, also outstanding.  My wife and I both agreed this was some of the best food we've had in a long time.

We will definitely be back again. This is a bit of a hidden gem that should not be overlooked!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and each time I've been happy. This is a special little place hidden away inside the Vermillion neighborhood. I'm betting they receive business via word of mouth. I had no idea this place was here until a friend invited me. I live in Huntersville and I'm always looking for a nice place for date night. Each time I visited the customer service was attentive and friendly. The food is really, really good and the portions are a decent size for the price you pay. I like this place and will be a frequent patron."}
{"text":"First time brunch here. Great mimosa, and great stuffed french toast. Strawberry cream cheese filling was just sweet enough. Also had a side of home fries which were fresh and crispy!"}
{"text":"It was good. And off the beaten path. Not sure if I'll come back. But if I do I will not sit outside. The day was beautiful but the flies attack you like your a giant bucket of meal!! Constantly swatting them away. Turned my meal into a workout and self defense class."}
{"text":"I came to Block Bistro on a Saturday afternoon for brunch a few weeks ago. We sat in the outdoor seating area. My boyfriend ordered the chicken and waffles, which was amazing and cooked to perfection. I ordered an omelet which was great as well. Fast service and very nice staff."}
{"text":"Grilled avocado was delicious and the crab cakes were huge! Everything was amazing! If this place had a more a accessible location it would be packed all the time. Worth the drive! Will be back for brunch it looked amazing too!"}
{"text":"We love this place!  Nice and quaint and high quality!  Try the wedge salad and then anything else on the menu!  You won't be disappointed. Every server we have ever had has been so nice and personable and made the whole meal a truly nice evening out."}
{"text":"Huntersville has a true hidden gem in Block Bistro. The food is phenomenal (the grilled avocado appetizer is to die for and the grit cakes with fried green tomatoes and jalapeño pimento cheese are equally as deadly) and the atmosphere is wonderful. You see the owners and chefs helping in all aspects of your dinner service to make sure you enjoy your experience. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This place is kinda tucked into the back of the Vermillion neighborhood. I had never heard of this restaurant until I searched for a new brunch place to try on Yelp and this came up.
We tried it one fine fall morning. The weather was great and we wanted to sit outside (we had a reservation) but when we arrived, they said they didn't have any reservation in our name so they sat us inside.
I will say, if you can, sit outside. The inside of the restaurant is big and roomy, which makes for a lot of echoes, making it really noisy even when it's not that full (we had to scream at each other to be able to hear over the folks at the table next to us).
On to the food. I ordered the Charleston shrimp and grits. They were good. A little on the heavy side, but I understand that's how shrimp & grits are. My husband had the half pound burger, which he loved. Two other people in our party had the Country Benedict which was also thoroughly enjoyed.
Our only complaint other than the noise inside the dining room was how hard it was to get our server's attention to bring us coffee creamers. Why not just provide a small basket of coffee creamers to every table since you are a brunch place? Regardless, we figured it was a fairly new restaurant so we'd give them some leeway. Still gets 4 stars from us because the food was good!"}
{"text":"Great Brunch! Went there on the 24th of June with mom and sister. We had Crab cakes Benedict, chicken and waffles and stuffed french toast. All 3 were excellent! The crab cake Benedict with fried green tomatoes and over easy eggs was perfect. French toast was made with Challah bread, which was a bonus for sure! Staff was friendly and prompt. Decor was nice with the brick wall and hardwoods. A Must try when in the area."}
{"text":"I went with my family for Mother's Day. Although we had a reservation there was a bit of a wait while they prepared our table (party of 6). There seemed to be be quite a bit of scrambling around by the hostess which often left the hostess table unattended. Once seated I was a little concerned because our waitress did not seem to be familiar with which menu items were gluten free.  But she had no problem going to find out. She also made it easy for me to swap out sides in order to meet our dietay needs. She was very attentive throughout the meal. 

All of the food was very good. We had 1 order of chicken and waffles, 2 orders of shrimp and grits (without the bacon), 1 crab cake Benedict, and 2 omelettes. Everyone enjoyed their food. We definitely plan to return again!"}
{"text":"First, the place is off the beaten path.  I love that.  It is tucked back in a neighborhood, and if you weren't looking for it specifically, you'd have no idea it was even there.  Parking was sparse.  We found some parallel parking nearby, but I can imagine on a busy night that might be an issue.

The signage when we were there wasn't clear.  I wasn't 100% sure I was in the right place, but went on in since nothing else was around where GPS said the restaurant was.  The signage points to the bar upstairs.

We began with cocktails.  We relied on the waiter for recommendations, and they didn't steer us wrong.  Very good bartender!

The choices for appetizers were few, but what we had was executed well and delicious.  Our table had fried green tomatoes and crab cakes.

The salad course was a wedge salad.  This is a really well executed salad.  The wedge is lightly grilled, then topped generously with bacon, red onion, blue cheese, Roma tomatoes, drizzled with honey balsamic reduction and dressed with blue cheese dressing.  This was probably my favorite dish of the night.

Our dinners were great, too, once they arrived.  For some reason there was a disconnect between salad and main dish and we waited a very long time.  I got the shrimp and grits, which were delicious, but very rich.  The sauce the shrimp was in was made with cream, which was different from what I was used to, and made the dish a bit heavy.  It's a solid dish, just beware: it's a lot.  The grilled fish and the sandwich were pronounced great too.

Dessert was for me, just OK.  We split these two selections (all they offered) with the table.  I was not wowed by either, so would skip if asked again.

If you are looking for a restaurant that is a little quiet, off the beaten path and has a solid menu with dinner selections and casual choices for a pub bite, this restaurant is perfect for you.

{"text":"Block opened in early June 2015, and is fast becoming one of our local favorites.  They are located in the same building as Harvey's, but on the first floor.  Their prices are similar to Cafe 100, but the interior of the restaurant and food are a both more comfortable and upscale.  We have never had a bad meal, and really enjoy the food, ambience, and service.

For breakfast, I have tried their stuffed french toast with bacon and crabcake benedict.  Usually, stuffed french toast has both fruit and cream cheese as the filling.  However, Block stuffed their french toast with just strawberries and bananas.  And that's not a bad thing.  It was really good, and not as heavy as the usual cream cheese filling.  I liked this variation very much!

For the crabcake benedict, I requested scrambled eggs with cheese, and instead of using an english muffin, Block serves theirs on a fried green tomato.  The tangy tomato adds great flavor, and the eggs are always cooked perfectly.  I like this dish a bit more than the french toast!  

My husband has tried their western omelet and corned beef and hash.  Again, Block did not follow the standard method of serving the hash.  They elevate it by using small cubes of tender corned beef, sliced potato wedges sautéed with onions and green peppers, and an English muffin with a fried egg.  (They usually serve this with a poached egg, but gladly substituted a fried one instead.)  This dish was also fantastic.  Again, the eggs are always cooked perfectly (no runny whites here), and the potatoes have amazing flavor.  The corned beef was not grisly as it can sometimes be, and while I don't usually like corned beef myself, I thought it was really good.  The omelet was also delicious.

Their coffee is nice and strong, and we really enjoyed that, too.  And service is consistently friendly and efficient. 

Having enjoyed their breakfast so much, we returned several times for dinner.  Even if you don't usually eat bread, I'm sure you will eat theirs.  They serve a small crusty loaf, sliced, with whipped herb butter.  We always eat the entire basket.  It's so good!

One night, we lucked out, and tried two seafood specials that were just amazing.  I had a salmon roll (sliced thinly, cured), filled with a crab and shrimp salad, with sliced avocado and a citrus drizzle.  I love salmon, and the dish was both light and absolutely delicious.  

My husband had the snapper, served on top of thinly sliced potatoes, and topped with a mango/jicama slaw, and surrounded by a chipotle sauce.  The snapper was perfectly cooked, the potatoes were a great accompaniment, and the chipotle sauce added just the right kick to elevate this dish. 

From their regular menu, we've tried their shrimp and grits and ribeye.  The shrimp and grits is a large portion served with a spicy sauce over perfectly cooked grits.  There is definitely enough for leftovers.  

Their ribeye is served over mashed potatoes, topped with spinach.  They know how to cook a steak (as expected), but their potatoes are amazing - perfectly seasoned, and flavored with the steak juices.  I don't like steak, but the juice really added to the potatoes.  

I can't forget to mention the ambience.  You feel as if you are in a Charleston, SC restaurant when dining in Block.  Their high ceiling and brick walls make for a very comfortable space.  And they play wonderful light jazz music that is so fitting to this environment.  

Block hasn't let us down yet, and we'll keep returning!"}
{"text":"Visited this brunch spot for the first time on a saturday between 11-12. Crowd was not too heavy and the morning atmosphere was very relaxing. Parking is along the street but the area is relatively open and we did not have any issues finding a spot around the circle of this quiet neighborhood setting. Would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"We were so excited to try this place since we live nearby. We went in on a Saturday morning and most of the tables were empty. We were promptly seated, but we had to give up and leave after sitting with menus for 20 minutes without even being offered drinks. There was apparently only one server, who was a little bit confrontational that we were leaving, but several people who came in after us had been served. 

Additionally, there were several people that were helping themselves to drinks behind the bar, so I assume they worked there or were personal friends of the owners. We were told to go to Harvey's if we were in a hurry, but I don't think that waiting 20 minutes to be acknowledged is  reasonable, especially at an establishment in this price range."}
{"text":"I am updating my review from 4 stars, and dropping it at least one!  My husband and I joined some friends for dinner here two weeks ago...and we probably should have known when at 7pm on a Friday the restaurant was bare! We waited 5 minutes to even see a \"host\" which ended up being the one and only server as well.  When my husband and our friend went to order beers off of their menu, the server said \"we don't have a lot of our beers\" so they said...\"okay which ones DO you have?\" and she said she didn't really know, but that she knew they had bud light... interesting! ANYWAY, I had the burger, it was eh... my husband had the crab cake sandwich and said he has had many that are better!  I just was pretty disappointed!"}
{"text":"I've had this place on my list to visit in Charlotte for quite some time.   I thought it was cute upon entering.  I sat down to grab a quick bite.   Barkeep comes over and uses her hand to wipe the crumbs in front of me over to the side (not off the bar).  I go to the bathroom and there is a ring around the toilet, and scum all in the sink.   I check for the health grade and it is a 94. 

I order anyway.   They actually served me a dried up bread ends for toast, cold grits that looked compacted... eggs were okay (sigh).... and most important....BACON NOT CRISPY (I asked twice and confirmed that crispy bacon was possible)!  I've had this place on my list to visit in Charlotte for quite some time and while the eggs and mimosas were good,  cleanliness is not a big factor here,  nor is hot food. It bugged me the entire time looking at the food crumbs next to me, that the barkeep had  just pushed over."}
{"text":"What a fabulous little find courtesy of Yelp. Searching for a close by brunch spot, Block Bistro popped up first on my Yelp search. Tucked away behind a residential neighborhood - Vermillion- is Block Bistro. The downside is that service has room for improvement. We waited about 10 minutest to be seated. The couple in front of us were waiting even longer without any type of acknowledgement. There were tables available and there was no line. While eating, we saw another couple come to the entrance and wait at the host stand for about 5 minutes without anyone acknowledging them and they left. It's as if staff just didn't pay attention to the door. Additionally, while our waitress was kind and attentive, she came out of the back scraping stuck on food particles off our extra plates with her bare hands. I'm going to guess she didn't just finish washing her hands right before. There was a long wait for our food considering the restaurant wasn't very busy.

That being said, Block Bistro redeemed itself with food. They may have the BEST shrimp and grits in the area. Yes, move over Tupelo. My guy ordered chicken and waffles. BB makes it own special pepper syrup (they put red pepper flakes in the syrup overnight. We asked) that is downright DELICIOUS. My guy ate all of the chicken and waffles and had to know the secret ingredient for the syrup. The chicken they used was cooked in a way that it was comparable to a Burger King. They could use a breading from scratch. That being said, the food was GREAT. I will definitely be going back soon. I may become a brunch regular. It was that good.

I forgot. The \"small\" orange juice is the same size as a small cocktail. It's $2.25, but not worth it. Too tiny."}
{"text":"This is were we selected to have brunch on Fathers Day. This place was ok, cute at best by the village feel of it.  I like how it's tucked away between the homes. The food however left more to be desired. I was initially reeled into this place based off the shrimp & grit reviews. My hubby got the shrimp and grits and I decided to jump out on a limb and try the crab cakes and fried green tomatoes. The grab cakes weren't great, but not the worst I've ever had, but I didn't like them. I ordered a side of fruit and home fries with my meal. The home fries were fried unbelievably hard and the fruit that I was served seemed to have been cut so close to the pineapple rind that I actually had some of its skin still attached.... yikes! Imagine biting into that.. ouch! My crab cakes lacked flavor and seasoning and were patted flatter than my fried green tomatoes. Wasn't great, but wasn't the worst. My husband picked at his meal also, and didn't enjoy it. And on top of all of this, the side tables are SUPER sticky for some strange reason. I know it was clean because I saw the young lady wipe it off, but it was unbelievably sticky. On a brighter side, my waitress was nice."}
{"text":"This place is solid.  After perusing the January Charlotte Restaurant Week menus for the Lake Norman area the menu offerings at BLOCK really stood out to me.  I'd never heard of the restaurant before and did some research looking for reviews.  There weren't a lot and I hope folks come to check it out because it's a little hidden gem in the middle of the Vermillion neighborhood and worth driving out to try.  It offers a Johnson & Wales-trained chef, a lovely cozy interior, with 7 tables of 4 and 4 tables of 6.  Very chill atmosphere.  The only downside to the interior of this pretty restaurant are the acoustics, it was a little louder than I expected.

Service:  A+.  Seriously.  We were served promptly by people who took pride in providing great service, we were checked in on by our host and server and when I asked for extra remoulade at one point the server somehow seemed to request it of someone with her eyes because it was brought to me before she even left our table!  We'd gone to two other restaurant week meals this week at very well-known, upscale LKN restaurants and both places could learn a thing or two about service from BLOCK.

Food:  I only wish I could have tried more because everything at our table was very good to excellent.  I took pictures of everything see below.

Appetizers:  5 of the 6 of us got the crab cake appetizer (100% lump crab cakes served with a Creole remoulade sauce). I was surprised to receive 3 mini crab cakes (I'd expected 2) on a nicely spiced remoulade with a little side of nicely tangy coleslaw.  At $8 on the regular menu this is a great deal for an excellent app.  My husband got the Spicy Thai Chili Calamari - fried calamari with banana peppers in a Thai chili sauce.  I was interested to try it because fried apps tend to come with a dipping sauce on the side.  The chef was right, no dipping sauce needed because they were perfectly seasoned and delicious, exactly right.  $9 on the regular menu.  If I'd realized no one was going to order the grilled avocado with pico and feta cheese balsamic reduction I'd have ordered that, but I'll try it next time we go.

Main Dishes:  We were able to try everything on the Queen's Feast menu.  Part of the reason I chose BLOCK was because they offered a 10 oz blackened filet mignon.  A lot of bigger places are dropping to 6 oz and I had the feeling that if they weren't being cheap on the sizing that there weren't going to be cheap on other things and I was right.  The filet was perfectly cooked to the temperature I requested and the seasonings were correct.  Some places oversalt their food to tease your palate into thinking it was better, BLOCK seasoned the meat correctly.  $27 on the regular menu.  My husband chose the Beer BBQ Pork Chop -14 oz French Cut Pork Chop with roasted rosemary potatoes and sautéed spinach, $17 on the regular menu.  He said it was excellent.  Another person chose the Charleston Shrimp & Grits - stone ground grits, blackened shrimp, bacon, red and green bell peppers, garlic, in a cream sauce, $16 on the regular menu.  The grits were creamy and the shrimp was flavorful.  The person who ordered the Atlantic Dijon Maple-Glazed Salmon - sautéed spinach and sweet potato puree, $17, was asked how she would like it done. I think she was a little surprised to be asked, salmon usually just comes out \"cooked\" and she didn't choose correctly, when it came out it was a little too raw for her taste.  She sent it back to be warmed up and it was back out again in two minutes... the service here really is done well.

Desserts for the table included a Tuxedo cheesecake, Turtle cheesecake, carrot cake and a spiked banana pudding.  Cheesecake and carrot cake slices were generous.

At the end of the day, Restaurant Week occurs to give restaurants the opportunity to show their stuff to patrons who might not have known about them or given them a try.  We had a great first experience here and we will be back again another evening.  I'm also interested in trying the brunch, I like what I've read.  I hope the restaurant finds success, I'm not sure how long it's been open but I'd sure like it to stick around, it's a great little find.  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"We were here for Mother's Day brunch last year year and it was great.  Now we are here for dinner for our first time because I was craving a Ruben.   They did not disappoint!   Dinner was awesome!   The bread and butter was totally delicious!!!  My husband got the corn-crab chowder to start and he really liked it. I got the Ruben with asparagus.  The Ruben was awesome!  The asparagus were few but very good. My husband got the Cuban with the fries. He really liked it all. The ketchup and mustard seemed better than any store bought we have ever gotten. Will definitely be back!  Great service!!!"}
{"text":"We had a great Sunday Brunch with comfortable outdoor seating.  The food and service was excellent and the prices, for brunch, were reasonable.  This was our second time eating Sunday Brunch at Block Bistro and it was equally good the first time.  The crab cake eggs Benedict with a fried green tomato is just awesome, the best brunch item I've ever had.  Our party of 5 was well served.  Thanks you!"}
{"text":"Sooo............. where do I start. I arrived at 10am, which was my fault because it doesn't open until 11am. However, the door was open and there were some folks maybe 4 or so just casually sitting on there laptops etc. So my guess would be they allow you to come in and use the WiFi even before they officially open, not sure. I tried the Charleston Shrimp and Grits being they look good going by the pictures on Yelp. Not only did they have good pictures but also good reviews. So my friend and I both had the same thing which was again, Charleston Shrimp and Grits and Mamosa's.  I must say mines did not look as good as some of the ones I saw in the pictures but never the less they taste good. It might not look like it's a lot of shrimp in my pictures but believe me they were. They have a tendency to sink to the bottom of the bowl. The bowl I liked (the appearance of it), but eating from it was kind of awkward. We were there for about an hour from 11AM till just after 12PM and my friend and I seem to be the only ones in the that entire time. Place was clean, food was good and service was good. The lady working was name Justine and she was very friendly. Later I found out she is the mom of one of the owners. She aside from the cook seem to be the only one working. Oh also, to me it was very cold inside but that could be because they had just opened. My bowl of grits were $16 to me that seem to be on the high side and my Mamosa's was $6. Would I return yes however I would not drive across town to go if that makes sense."}
{"text":"The place is nice, the food good. Love the staff. Outside was a bit buggy, flies, you might want to use some fly strips. It was just so bad by the end of breakfast we wanted to run.We did notice the table who was seated 10 minutes after us was served first, but we woudl not have minded except for the flies. The breakfast was very tasty . I had the corned beef hash made fresh with 2 eggs."}
{"text":"This place is a nice little hidden gem and they serve brunch on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays!! We visited this past Sunday. The service was great, the mimosa was awesome and the place itself was lit very well by the natural light coming in through the windows. We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Terrible brunch and sorry to say but if you thought otherwise you have never had real brunch in the Northeast and west coast. The French toast was not warm, bread tasted stale, the cream cheese was too watery, and the syrup tasted like the cheap crap from grocery stores. The chicken and waffles were also disappointing. The chicken was basically McDonald's chicken tenders. The waffles were not cooked well, tasted like frozen waffles, and were dry. The service was ok and the flies in the patio area were endless. Would never return."}
{"text":"Old neighborhood vibe in a new space with amazing food. The home fries pop in your mouth, and the eggs Benedict over fried green tomatoes was something special. The Bloody Mary is just the right amount of spicy - and the generous pour leaves me feeling just the right amount of happy."}
{"text":"Very tucked away in a planned community, this place was a gem for brunch.  Ordered grilled avocado, shrimp and grits, crab cake Benedict and chicken and waffles.   Everything was fantastic, service was outstanding- we will be back."}
{"text":"I'm my opinion, very overpriced. The omelets were smaller than I thought they should be. I told the waitress and she said that the ham and cheese omelet is smaller than the western because it has fewer ingredients. Somehow that makes it a lot smaller but ok. Wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"After a recent brewery tour we needed some good food and found the bistro on yelp. Thanks friends! The place can be a little hard to find. My GPS was a little confused and once in this neighbor we were almost convinced we had been mis-lead, but alas, there was the sign. So, when looking, you're probably close, even though the area feels residential. The night we came the restaurant was almost empty, not sure what the deal with that was. The staff, service and food were very good. The restaurant had a nice, almost romantic vibe to it. Tonight it was pretty quiet since there were few patrons. I would recommend if you are in the area and need some good upscale food."}
{"text":"I love how this restaurant was in a neighborhood. The brunch was delicious. I ordered the chicken and waffles and my boyfriend ordered the Mexican omelet. We both enjoyed our brunch! We definitely will be coming back. We haven't tried the lunch menu yet but maybe soon. Staff was attentive and sweet!"}
{"text":"We went during restaurant week which is always an iffy proposition in terms of reviewing a restaurant but, here I am.  I would lean towards the descriptor of good not great food I've seen in other reviews but I was very impressed with the service.  Dylan was our server and he was a pro and very friendly!

One plus was the flexibility to sub out an extra app instead of dessert as I don't have much of a sweet tooth, more on this later...  The two apps I tried were Block's version of a Wedge salad and a cup of corn/crab chowder.  The salad was a winner but the chowder needed a good bit of tableside seasoning and was a little thick in texture.  Another app at the table involved some Fried Green Tomatoes and was quite good.

For an entree, I had a filet mignon which arrived medium rare as ordered.  It was tasty but not as good as a steak from some other LKN places with 131 Main and Choplin's coming immediately to mind.  My wife had a sauteed flounder dish which I tried some of and it was good in the restaurant and equally good as a midnight snack.

Back to subbing out an app for dessert.... My wife and sister both got dessert, a slice of key lime pie and a slice of cheesecake.  Both were good but the key lime pie was outstanding.  I might go so far as to say the best I've had in the 15 years since we moved to NC from FL.  I asked Dylan where it came from and, to nobody at the tables surprise, it came from a bakery in FL!

Block feels like another decent choice for the LKN dining community and I will give them another go for a non-restaurant week meal.  Perhaps for brunch as that menu looked yummy and I believe they serve it all weekend vs. just on Sunday."}
