{"text":"Stopped in for some pizza while visiting Pittsburgh. Great pizza and friendly service. My son has a severe nut allergy and the owner made sure everything was safe and checked all ingredients. The restaurant is also clean and service was prompt."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time or money. Rude service, and pizza was subpar.  So many better options right around. Please dont cut corners on quality of your product.   The bar looked small and quaint. ..maybe the beer is really cold or I just hit a bad day.  For pizza? Na ...won't be back! NEXT!!!"}
{"text":"Basic little pizza joint that seems to do a good amount of business. I usually get their calzone. It's good sized and big enough to where I don't have to eat anything else. The food is always up fast, but they aren't really a service centered place. They do have a few servers running all over the place, but it would probably be better to order it as pick up. Flavor was good, price was below what I expected. I will be back."}
{"text":"This is a good, basic pizza joint (for Pgh). The pizza was hot and fresh and served relatively quickly. The cheese was a little overloaded. The crust was more chewy than crispy which is typical for Pittsburgh.

The seems to be pretty busy during the weekday lunch hour. Atmosphere is casual. My waiter was pretty attentive and courteous; no complaints there."}
{"text":"I go here a good bit. Tony the bartender is outstanding!! I love the pizza, one of my favorites downtown. Its priced good and atmosphere is good. I would recommend it for sure!"}
{"text":"Pretty straightforward little pittsburgh pizza joint. Hoagies, Salads, Pizza, Calzone. Prices are reasonable, especially if you go in a pie with someone else.

We had a couple different pizzas. I would give them 3 stars. Thinner crust, not quite as chewy as I like it. Toppings and sauce were bordering on sparse.

Service gets five stars. They did a great job handling a pretty busy lunchtime rush. The place is well lit and very clean for this kind of pizza joint, so I'll give them five stars for that, as well. There's an upstairs dining room and some downstairs seating with a bar. Also, outdoor seating."}
{"text":"I always get great service and the sandwiches (Hoagies) are awesome! The bread they are made with is light and crusty. I like the quite upstairs atmosphere and must go there for lunch at least four to five times a month. Would recommend for a bite to eat."}
{"text":"Off the beaten path and closes early (around 7?).  Pizza was quite decent.  Crust was a little thicker than I like.  The only reason I went is because I parked right by it and it was such a beautiful night and I was able to sit outside.  But I will definitely back for happy hour!  Located near Point Park U."}
{"text":"Here we go again. When it comes to office lunches, there's never any question. We're heading to San Remo. 

It's hard for me to hate on pizza in general because, well, it's pizza! San Remo's pizza quality is pretty standard, in my opinion.The crust (my favorite part) is always full and crispy - just how I like it. Then you got the super gooey cheese, your choice of toppings, and loaded with a free layer of grease. Mmmm, heartburn never tasted so delicious. 

In preparation for the dreaded bikini season, I opted for a salad (a.k.a. random pizza toppings on lettuce) this time around. Just awful. The only vegetarian salad option was the tossed salad, so I didn't have much to choose from. The vegetables were cut so large that it was a nuisance to eat, and it's actually very overpriced for the horrible quality salad you get. Sorry San Remo - salads don't seem to be your thing. 

SERVICE IS HORRENDOUS!!! It really is pure torture sometimes. We come in a big group usually (10-20 people), but a reservation is made. We show up, and the tables are not set up. Ugh. But no biggie - we agree to split into different tables. Our group usually orders 6-8 pizzas, and it always takes a full hour to get our food. Ridiculous, especially if they were expecting us to be there. We get the same waitress every time and she never fails to be completely RUDE to everyone in our group. Come on lady, can you honestly be cranky everyday of your life? I understand it can be a bit hectic serving a big group, but the 'tude ain't helping anyone. 

To conclude, average pizza paired with AWFUL service. Pass!"}
