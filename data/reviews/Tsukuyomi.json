{"text":"If you are looking for authentic ramen this is a great place to go.  The broth is the best I've ever had.  My wife and I took the kids and on a very cold day it's hard to beat a steamy bowl of soup.  You pick the way you want it prepared off your own menu card, several variations.  It's quick.  It's delicious.   My daughter had the Japanese soda which was fun for her. The Sapporo is on draft which is always a pleasure. My wife enjoyed the tea."}
{"text":"Le local est joli et accueillant le personnel aussi. Mais ce n'est ni le meilleur ramen ni le mieux présenté que j'ai mangé. Le prix était raisonnable 13$ pour un bon bol avec 2 bons morceaux de poulet. Le bouillon était fade."}
{"text":"nous avions lu un article sur mtl blog. Nous avons vraiment aime lendroit.La deco est sympa et non prétentieuse et le staff est très serviable. Nous avons pris unbol de ramen au poulet et un bol de ramen vegan. c'était un délice. le seul hic c'est que les toilettes netaient pas super propres, un must pour moi! Mais nous retournerons!"}
{"text":"Good ramen, tasty broth, friendly staffs, good toppings without adding extras. I love ramen. It feels good when eating in winter, and even hot summer xD When ordering, you can choose which level for salt. The ambiance is nice, feel like ramen shop from Japan. I recommend this place if you are around in Mile End"}
{"text":"I have tasted their Tonkutsu chashu twice. On my first visit, the pork belly was decent size with perfect balance of lean meat and fat, but unfortunately on my next visit the meat was dryer and smaller size. What was consistent was the tasty soup and the rather small portion size, but then it is inexpensive. Service was fine and place has a little izakaya feel, though I find their choice of Japanese music peculiar. Fine place for your ramen fix when you are in neighborhood."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. I think it's comparable in quality to Yokato Yokabai's. They are still new and can certainly get better. People forget that Yokato was actually very underwhelming in the beginning but they gradually improved and now people rave about them. I don't think the gap between these places is as wide as some other reviewers feel. Which one you like better I think will ultimately be based on subjective preferences.  A standard bowl is $13 here and $13.95 at Yokato. These two places both specialize in tonkotsu broth. The milky color is similar between the two. Yokato's is more thick and gelatinous while Tsukuyomi's is thinner but IMO has a bit more of a porky flavor to it. As far as regular level saltiness, I don't recall any noticeable difference. Both provide a half marinated soft boiled egg, both are yummy. Both have thin, straight, white noodles, which seemed about the same to me. The noodles have good bite to them. As far as veggie toppings Tsukuyomi's base bowl has bean sprouts and spinach while Yokato's base bowl only has wood ear mushrooms (although they offer more veggie options as extras). In regards to meat, they are also different, Tsukuyomi offers a leaner cut, I believe pork shoulder that's bbqed. It was tender and tasty. The extra chicken I ordered is white meat (2 pieces for $2). At Yokato, you get pork belly and the extra chicken is dark meat. Extra meat is $3 at Yokato but you do get get proportionally more meat for the price.  As far as condiments go, I really like the garlic oil at Tsukuyomi. It can really change the flavor profile of broth. I prefer it over the dry garlic bits at Yokato. Yokato has more condiments such as a spicy condiment and sesame seeds. Tsukyuomi had a spicy condiment during my first visit, but this time I didn't see any at all.  The matcha tea with honey is really good here. I also enjoyed their very sesame-ish gomae in a previous visit."}
{"text":"As a fan of ramen, i was pretty excited to try this new place. The place is quite nice and had a nice ambiance for ramen.   The takowasa is inexpensive and is amazing. It wasn't too salty like many other places and had that wasabi kick in every bite.   As for the ramen, i was pretty disappointed. It wasn't anything special and lacked a bit of flavor. The people sitted at the bar had those gingers and other sides to add to it, but we didn't have any at the table.   The service is just ok. They never came to refill our water bottle and we had to wait in line at the cash to pay.   I dont think I will come back."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my ramen here. Got the chasu ramen with thick noodles. The noodles were a bit more al dente than I like but still nice and chewy. The regular broth was flavourful. Not the best ramen I ever had in Montreal but a good option in that area. Went for lunch and the whole resto was full. I liked the ambience... natural light, natural wood. It was very zen! Not a lot of option of broths and toppings (would have liked to see ground pork, corn, etc) but honestly I can't complain as the chasu hit the spot for me."}
{"text":"Small menu with ramen and some sides. Vegan broth available. Full of flavour. Great service. I will return."}
{"text":"Tsukuyomi is a nice little ramen shop with a few tables and a long counter circling the prep area where you can eat. At 1pm on a Wednesday it was fairly full and unfortunately the staff seemed to be a bit overwhelmed.  My friend and I are familiar with ramen places so we wrote our orders down on the designated sheets of paper right away. Since no one from the staff checked up on us we gave our order to the employee standing in front of us behind the counter. After 30 minutes we asked about our order since other customers who arrived after us received their food while we were still waiting. Long story short, they had clearly lost our order, the guy still standing in front of us behind the counter didn't seem to care that much, but a nice waitress came to the rescue and said she requested our food to be prepared asap. However, it still took 1 hour in total before we could start eating.  Fortunately, the ramen was actually good! I ordered the tonkotsu chashu with thin noodles and regular saltiness broth. I usually prefer thick noodles but Tsukuyomi's are super large and flat compared to other places. The broth is creamy and rich, but it doesn't feel too heavy (unlike Yokato Yokabai). It's true that it's not too salty, but I didn't think it was bland. The pork was so tender it broke apart in many little pieces in my bowl. Finally, my egg had a runny yolk, not overcooked at all unlike other reviewers.  I can't say Tsukuyomi made a good first impression based on the service we got, but I would give them another try if I get the opportunity."}
{"text":"I got so excited when I saw there was a new ramen restaurant in Montreal as I'm a huge ramen-lover! After seeing a lot of pictures of this new ramen place in Montreal and really good reviews from my friends (one of them is a food blogger!), I decided to try it out with my friend.  We went there for a Saturday lunch and surprisingly there wasn't any lineup at 12:15 PM (there were still at least 10 seats available). Maybe it's because it's summer time and the weather is still nice (23 but feels like 30 degrees Celsius) so people are not craving for a boiling bowl of ramen yet? Nonetheless, it was a bit odd as other brunch places around the area (Lawrence, Sparrow, Faberge) were packed with people and there were lineups around the same time. And also, with the opening of new restaurants, there is usually more people who would want to try it out, right? (FYI, they opened on August 7, 2017)  Tsukuyomi's ordering system is like Yokato Yokabai: there is a sheet of paper that you can fill out your name and check what you would like to order. The menu is simple, they have 6 sides (edamame, salad, goma-ae, takowasa, mini chasu don, steamed rice) and 4 different ramen (veggie tonkotsu, chasu tonkotsu, chicken tonkotsu and vegan). You can customize the thickness of your ramen (thick or thin) and the saltiness of your broth (low, regular and high). You can also add extra soft boiled egg, chasu, chicken, nori and spinach.  I settled down for their chashu tonkotsu (pork bone broth + braised pork belly topping as described on their menu) and I added a soft boiled egg as I didn't know the ramen also comes with 1/2 of a soft boiled egg. To be honest, I think their menu is a bit misleading as it didn't include what exactly the ramen comes with. Usually, in other ramen places like Kinton, Misoya or Yokato Yokabai, it is clearly indicated what it comes with (1/2 or 1 egg, the number of chasu pieces, nori, etc.) so customers wouldn't have to wonder whether it comes with other toppings or not and whether they have to add extra toppings or not. In my knowledge, usually what is described under the name of the dish is usually what it comes with (ingredients/toppings), so I thought this ramen only comes with the braised pork belly. And yes, some ramen places in Asia like Ichiran would serve a bowl of ramen that comes with chasu (no other toppings unless you add them).   For the thickness and saltiness, I decided to go with their thick noodles and regular broth. When my ramen came, I was surprised to see so many soft boiled eggs! That was when both my friend and I said: \"Oh! It comes with egg already?!\" And veggie (spinach), nori, and bean sprouts!   Their noodles were really thick; the thickest ramen noodles I've ever had, very different from the other ramen houses! I don't know how thin their thin ramen noodles are but it might be better than the thick ones. Don't get me wrong, their thick noodles were really chewer, \"stretchy\" and firm (the way I like) but because it was so thick, it couldn't really absorb the broth, so almost every bite I took, I was only able to taste/eat the noodles that were a bit bland.   The regular broth was on a blander side as it was not salty at all but lacking a bit of flavor I feel. The broth was light and not greasy. I wished the broth could be thicker and creamier though. Maybe next time, if I decide to go back again, I will pick their thin noodles with high saltiness broth (trust me, I have never went for high saltiness because usually it would be too salty).  My piece of chasu was a disappointment. From the pictures and description of my food blogger friend, the chasu was a big as her hand but mine was barely 1/3 of hers (and half of my piece was just fat). The more I compare my bowl of ramen with hers, the more I feel cheated. I'm not sure if Tsukuyomi gave her a bigger piece with more veggies too because she is a food blogger and it would look nicer in her pictures but that would be a bit misleading and unfair for regular customers, right? (this is just my assumption though, no harsh feelings!) Their chasu was however very tender and flavorful!   Their soft-boiled egg was a bit disappointing as well. The yolk wasn't runny (it was a bit overcooked) but it was well-marinated and still tender. The amount of veggies I got wasn't as described by my food blogger friend either (I felt the need to add extra spinach). They also didn't have the black garlic oil as mentioned by my same friend... Our waitress told us they only had spicy oil. I think with garlic oil, the tonkotsu ramen would taste even better (definitely richer in texture). Overall, the bowl of ramen was pretty small for the price ($13).  I hope they will re-adjust their menu and make the size of the chasu piece more consistent. The staff were friendly but not very attentive as it took them a while to notice us when we asked for the black garlic oil. For now, I give them 2.5/5 as I think there is a lot of room for improvement."}
{"text":"Owners need to hire a second person to help out the poor guy responsible for taking orders at lunchtime! He was trying very hard and being apologetic, but there was a feeling that some things were probably forgotten or delayed due to the crowd.   I'd also suggest that everyone pick the extra-salty option for the broth; it more or less equates to \"regular\" at most of Montreal's other ramen shops.   Those two points aside, it's wonderful to finally have a good ramen shop in the Mile End; the decor is cozy, the menu strikes a nice balance between simple and interesting, and the ramen itself is pretty serviceable. Looking forward to seeing this place take shape, and to many lunches here in the future."}
{"text":"It was okay. A bit overpriced and bland flavoured broths."}
{"text":"The 'vegetable ramen' is delicious, but be careful - the broth is actually pork bone broth, not veggie. When we realized this and ordered a vegan ramen instead, we were bummed to discover that the vegan broth is very basic. There's so much more you can do to make a vegan broth amazing! Miso! Mushrooms! This was pretty flavourless, sadly.   But we loved the room, cozy and calm and lovely and traditional. We loved the young Japanese staff working hard behind the counter. The location is great and if you eat meat there are lots of I'm sure wonderously tasty options.   I definitely recommend getting the spicy pickled mustard greens to add to your ramen - such an awesome flavour!"}
{"text":"BEST RAMEN PLACE IN MTL EVER!!! Love this place. They offer tonkotsu ramen as their specialty and it is sooo good. Discovered this place by accident, and have been a loyal customer since. Great service every time; you really feel they care for you and your experience at the restaurant. I definitely recommend this place for anyone.   Ps: They now have happy hours 5-7pm. To consider  if you want a beer and a side dish for only 10$."}
{"text":"We were told by someone that this place served the best ramen in town! As ramen fans, we of course had to try it. We went there on a Friday night and got there at 8pm. There was a line up with 10 people in front of us and we waited approximately 50min so we actually had a lot of time to observe (and get hungry). There was clearly a lack of efficiency in the service and the restaurant needs to review their logistics. We finally sat down and ordered two tonkotsu ramen with chashu and a side of goma ae (Japanese spinach). The ramen was not bad, I actually found the broth pretty tasty (I added the black garlic oi), the noodles were ok. The piece of pork that I got had also too much fat for my taste.  I liked the ambiance, it was cozy with fun Japanese music. Overall, it was ok ramen but I wouldn't get out of my way to go there."}
{"text":"Cute as can be ramen joint. Solid food and great service to boot. Keep in mind most of it is counterside seating (which we didn't mind one bit). Get your ramen loaded with extras, be sure to top it off with some karage, and save room for dessert for a green tea cheesecake that will make you weep tears of joy."}
{"text":"What I love about this place is that the menu is pretty small so you don't have to spend a lot of time choosing, but no matter what you get it's going to be delicious! Love that they have a vegan option, which is also super tasty. Staff is super friendly, and the amazing iced teas are only $3!"}
{"text":"We keep coming back here but not just because it's so close to home! It's solidly tasty ramen, especially once you determine your personal fave combo of saltiness, extras and condiments. The service is friendly and welcoming, and has gotten over some initial opening hiccups mentioned by other reviewers. The seating setup and decor is quite neat too."}
{"text":"Their ramen is very delicious! I highly recommend this place if you are looking for an authentic Japanese ramen with Tonkontsu broth. Their broth is the best one I tried so far, it is really rich and creamy. What surprised me the most is that the broth is not too heavy neither too greasy. Not to forget their egg, it is so well flavored. I usually take their most traditional one which is the Tonkotsu Chasu ramen. Their Chasu (pork meat) is really well done and tasty. What I like about their Chasu is that it doesn't have a really thick part of fat on their pork meat. If you like your ramen to be spicy, they have the spicy takana to add in your ramen, and it is absolutely  something you have to try!"}
{"text":"My opinion might be little biased here since I was not very hungry tonight. I heard so many good things about this place, and truly the sauce for the ramen was well broiled with the pork. (although I felt the pork tasted little bit like a bbq) I liked the ramen in general as it wasnt too salty or strong with the meat flavor."}
{"text":"My wife and I came for lunch. My wife doesn't eat meat, so she ordered the vegan ramen with tofu. We have had several excellent meatless ramen broths (in Montreal and elsewhere). Sadly, the broth here had no flavour. It tasted like a very basic vegetable stock. A bouillon cube would have made a tastier broth. The kitchen clearly did not take any extra steps or use ingredients, like roasted mushrooms, kombu, or miso, to make a rich tasty broth. The ramen was garnished with some sad looking string beans and raw, cold cherry tomatoes. This is supposed to be vegetarian ramen, not a dumpy vegetable soup. The tofu seemed to have been marinated in only soy sauce and maybe some sugar and barely heated through in the broth. The egg was nicely cooked with a soft yolk, but cold in the center.   I ordered the octopus appetizer (I can't recall the name) and the tonkotsu chashu. The appetizer was a mixture of octopus, seaweed and spinach that you wrap in sheets of nori and eat as a roll. The octopus was nicely seasoned with wasabi, but there couldn't have been more than a tablespoon of octopus in he mixture. So you're really paying $4 for some seaweed and spinach.   As for my ramen, the broth was pedestrian. Not terrible, but lacking the full flavour and palate coating richness that I like in ramen. The pork itself was fine, but the portion was meager.   Overall, the place has a patina of authenticity but lacks substance."}
