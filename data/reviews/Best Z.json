{"text":"Decent Chinese Food. For 5.99, you get a large portion of whatever you want. I had some steamed green beans, General Tao's chicken, a spring roll, some rice and some veg. Its not the best Chinese in the world but for what it is (a small joint run in the bottom of a mall), its edible and it seems like a Mom and Pop shop."}
{"text":"Prices have gone up to $5.99 and $6.99 (plus tax).  Only 50 cents but this is becoming less of a bargain.  And, I kind of have to agree with the other reviewer - the food quality is not very good at all.  I still don't think it's terrible, but I wouldn't have great expectations.  Still worth a try if you're in the area and hungry though, in my opinion."}
{"text":"I'd read an article about this restaurant in the \"Toronto Star\" a couple months ago and have been meaning to try it.  Today was the day!  For $10, I got the large container and a bottle of pop.  Yes, you can fill it with WHATEVER you want as long as the lid closes.  I filled mine with veggie rice, black bean beef, sweet and sour pork, General Tao chicken, a couple wings and a couple honey garlic ribs.  I had lots of food and there was still room for the lid to close.  I tried a bit of it all and left a lot. The food isn't very good. The quality is poor and nothing tastes like it was supposed to. The black bean beef, wings and ribs were blah and the pork and chicken were sickeningly sweet ... the veggie rice was the best thing. Everything had a funky texture and was kind of cold.  If I was ranking this on quantity, it would be 5/5 ... you can jam a lot of food in the large container for $6.99!  But ranking it for quality, I've got to give it 1/5.  In this case, you get what you pay for.  I won't be back."}
