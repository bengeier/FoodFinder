{"text":"Oof! Sorry Fuel, this was a pizza fail. I had high hopes from the fact that this chain has exploded in a short time, but they were dashed on the rocks upon the first taste of delivery. The pizza was chewy, and not in a fun way, more in a rubber tire way. The taste is \"ok,\" but reminded me a lot of the Chuck E Cheese variety I downed as a kid. There was very little flavor, absolutely no pizzaz, and the experience is not one I want to repeat. We have done better with grocery store dough, canned sauce, and throwing our own ingredients down on the fly.   FYI, we got a pepperoni and a buffalo chicken. Not even any bleu cheese dipping sauce included with the buffalo--what?"}
{"text":"I just moved to Charlotte from NYC a month ago and stopped by Fuel Pizza craving a delicious slice.  Given Fuel's motto for pizza \"from a couple guys that moved to Charlotte from NYC that couldn't find good pizza in their new home,\" I thought I'd be in luck.   The slices were tiny - if I could change the font to reflect the size I would - yet priced the same as some of the best takeout spots in NYC.  Fuel slices were more like 99cent fresh ($1) slices in the city.  The crust took up half the slice, hardly any cheese on the slices, and literally at its widest point one of the slices was 3 inches.  The sauce was tasty though I will say that much.  Guys - I realize you've found some success down here with a far less scrutinizing crowd but have some pride and either take a visit to NYC to remind your taste buds what your missing or at minimum check on the pizza makers once in while."}
{"text":"It was edible. But not good. Delivery was par, but the pizza was lukewarm and had a chewy texture (in the tire sense, not the warm cookie sense). I'm not sure how this franchise has managed to explode recently, but they need to focus on food quality more and rapid expansion less. Get it right, then go big."}
{"text":"The Brooklyn Bridge pizza we ordered was excellent! Had fresh mozzarella, pepperoni, sausage, prosciutto, cherry peppers and fresh basil. The tomato sauce was very tasty and the crust was also really good. We also ordered wings - hot Buffalo and Asian chili..they were wonderful - just the right amount of 'crisp'. Friendly and accommodating staff. Would highly recommend and will definitely go there again when I return to the area."}
{"text":"It's 1am, they advertise for 2am. I call 3 times and each call someone answers the phone but will not talk. It is like they just take the phone off the hook and leave it there. Luke is probably the culprits. Everyone at this joint are full of the Selves and will screw you over to profit for themselves. DO NOT ORDER PIZZA FROM HERE!  There's a passage I got memorized. Ezekiel 25:17. \"The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of the darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know I am the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon you.\" Now... I been sayin' that shit for years. And if you ever heard it, that meant your ass. You'd be dead right now. I never gave much thought to what it meant. I just thought it was a cold-blooded thing to say to a motherfucker before I popped a cap in his ass. But I saw some shit this mornin' made me think twice. See, now I'm thinking: maybe it means you're the evil man. And I'm the righteous man. And Mr. 9mm here... he's the shepherd protecting my righteous ass in the valley of darkness. Or it could mean you're the righteous man and I'm the shepherd and it's the world that's evil and selfish. And I'd like that. But that shit ain't the truth. The truth is you're the weak. And I'm the tyranny of evil men. But I'm tryin', Ringo. I'm tryin' real hard to be the shepherd. #YNWA"}
{"text":"If I could give this place less than a star I would.  Last night my wife and I went there because it is just down the road from our apartment.  We ordered a pizza and garlic knots, dine in.  We sat down and waited for thirty minutes. I was thinking, \"hey that seems a little long for a pizza\" since the place was emptying out.  I went up and asked the guy if my pizza had been cooked and about how long it may take.  After a few minutes of him doing something, other than looking for my order, he said, \"it'll be a few minutes and we will bring it out to you.\"  This interaction was clearly a brush off and a \"Why are you asking me? Get out of my face\".  I sat down and waited another 15 minutes and asked someone else the same question.  The cook looked confused and pointed to the warming case. The guy went over and grabbed it and handed it to me.  I said, \"are you serious?\"  He just handed it to me and walked away.  Needless to say, I am angry about my experience. Although I don't know what fresh fuel pizza tastes like because it had been in a warmer drawer for at least twenty minutes ,I imagine it tastes like a warmer version of the crap I ate when we got back to our apartment.  I would rank the pizza taste less than a chilled pizza hot pocket.  Not going back.  Garbage service and poor quality pizza."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with friends. Got half aloha and half full engine. The full engine was entirely forgettable. The aloha was tasty and I would definitely get it again. However for the price I'm not sold that this pizza is better than dominos or papa johns. Friendly service. More points taken off because an entire side of the outdoor seating was not cleaned. Meaning four outdoor tables and all the customers having to sit only on two tables."}
{"text":"3 for food. 1 for service. Reminder to self. Don't ever tip here again for take outs.  Ordered a pizza, wings and garlic knots. The waiter forgets wings and garlic knots.   Had to wait 15 more minutes after waiting 20 minutes already for my pizza!"}
{"text":"As far as pizza in the south goes, this is pretty good.  It has cornmeal on the cust, but the slices are big and the toppings are killer, esp the sausage.  Neat \"gas station\" motif."}
{"text":"I placed a large takeout order (almost $100) late on a Thursday night and the gentleman made me repeat every part of the order at least twice. He didn't even bother to tell me what time the order would be ready. I frequent this place for lunch and use them for work events pretty frequently and have always had a decent experience but not this time.  When I got home and went to unpack the food, I realized the order was completely wrong. Checked the receipt and the order that was rung in was completely different then what I asked for and with totally different quantities. It was as if the order was erased and the guy just tried to make it up out of memory. Certainly was not please to have ordered mainly calzones and end up with almost all subs.  The most annoying part of the experience is the sausage, pepper and onion subs were 85% peppers and onions. There was about 10 slices of very very thin sausage on the entire sandwhich which I think is a ripoff for $8.99. Terrible experience overall and will highly make me reconsider ever going here again."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza place! We love the sauce and cheese. You definitely get a ton of pizza for the price you pay. We also love going because of the gluten free and vegan options. Definitely the best tasting gluten free pizza crust I have had in awhile!"}
{"text":"Probably won't be back. Walked into the door wasn't greeted. The guy took our order only had a cheese pie and wings. They brought the wings out. The cook must didn't have any sauce because the wings were really dry. The pizza took another 20 minutes to come out. The pizza was just ok. My previous experiences at this location have been just ok don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch and were disappointed.  The facility was dingy.  I opened my salad and there was rotten lettuce.  I returned it to the counter and they graciously gave me another.  Once again, ran into rotting lettuce.  I didn't eat the salad. (My husband's was fine.)  The pizza was ho hum.  I will not go back."}
{"text":"This review is for service never got a chance to grab a slice of pizza.    Looks like a reasonable place, but the staff didn't know what they were doing.   Went there to grab a slice and apparently a Lego festival was next door.  I was told to wait outside by staff because they were 'full'.  I peaked inside and the line was short.    The staff doesnt appear to able to handle large crowds.  I could imagine the service on the weekends.  I left."}
{"text":"Non c'e  male for an American pizza chain: takeout fast, toppings savory."}
{"text":"Went there today for the first time. Upon entering we were not even acknowledged or greeted. The pizza on display looked extremely dried as though it had been sitting there all day. Needless to say, we walked out and ate at another pizzeria where the pizza looked fresh and the service was excellent. I will NEVER go to Fuel Pizza again, especially the one on Central Avenue."}
{"text":"This place gets everyone wrong.  If you order online, you get there and they tell you the online menu doesn't match the real menu.  So you re-order and wait.  And wait.  Then you inevitably get the wrong order.  Check the number of slices you get!  If you ordered a side item, they are probably out of it.    Last time I was there I got the wrong order FOUR times.  I called them out on it each time, got a replacement, and was still missing a slice when I got home.  They told me it looked like one large slice, but was actually two.   It wasn't.   The service is terrible and the food is pretty bad.   Avoid this place."}
{"text":"So we got a lunch meeting catered at work the other day. Fuel pizza was great then and great today for lunch!!!"}
{"text":"Should have known when they were not busy at 7 on a Sunday with such a trendy atmosphere, that it would be a bad experience. Slow service, orders were wrong, no tea and rude employees. They got mad when we asked for \"the rest of our order\" they hadn't filled. Bad experience.  Everyone has a bad day in a restaurant...but I won't be going back to find out if there are better days here."}
{"text":"Terrible food and terrible service.  Also this place is all about taking advantage of people.   After 11pm (only) you can get water only by the bottle.   Free tap water is not available late night.  Just to take advantage of people."}
{"text":"This place offered to split our pizza then nearly doubled our price.  When I asked why they said new menu.  When I asked for the manager they refused to give me his\her name.  Don't go."}
{"text":"Does this sound appetizing? Ordered a Chicken/Spinach calzone.  The guy took one of the previously cooked calzone dough balls from behind the glass and heated it up, then cut it in half and put in the filling.  It wasn't a calzone, really just a terrible sandwich, with none of the ingredients warm and none of the cheese melted.  The tiny cup of marinara included was not enough to drown this miserable, dry dough sandwich.  The only consolation is the take-out beer I got that washed away the disappointment."}
{"text":"I was in town for a conference, and we were looking for a place to go for dinner.  Downtown was deserted, and there were very few places that were even open within walking distance.  We stumbled upon Fuel and ordered a spinach, ricotta, and tomato pizza and some buffalo wings.    The pizza was good (crust was a little soggy), but the wings were excellent... and I have tried a lot of wings.  The atmosphere is very low-key and casual, and the prices were reasonable considering the downtown location.  A great option for travelers."}
{"text":"I was hesitant about checking this place out because of the poor yelp reviews but me and my wife had a pleasant experience. It's not 4 star dining, but it is a solid pizza. The staff were friendly as well. I'll be back."}
{"text":"This place is horrible better off getting pizza from a chain restaurant.  Over priced and not very good."}
{"text":"Great pizza if you're drunk or just really craving a slice. There's much better pizza in the city but also much worse. This falls right in the meaty part of the bell curve. I'd recommend the Hawaiian slices"}
{"text":"We just started going to this location every Friday (Fuel Friday). You can buy by the slice so it can be rather affordable. The people that work here have been really great. They even gave a free cookie to my 2 year old, \"on the house\". Fuel has been a great affordable pizza joint for our Fridays."}
{"text":"So really the back story is guys from NYC were looking for good pizza and they couldn't find any so they opened their own place? Well they failed so I guess there's still no good place to get pizza in Charlotte. I'm from NYC and this is horrible. First off I'll give everyone a little hint if you ever go into a pizza place who cooks their food and pizza on a conveyer it's gonna suck..I got pizza and the chicken parm sub..totally embarrassing they use frozen chicken nuggets as the chicken. How lazy can you get..do you know how easy it is to flour or bread your own cutlet and make a decent sandwich? If you don't know any better what a good pizza place is have at it..if you want quality run. Run fast...."}
{"text":"We ordered pizza & salad. Great pizza! The sausage is wonderful! Great ingredients...fresh tomato sauce, & fresh mushrooms! The only negative was the crust was a little crisper than we like. The side salad was also satisfying!"}
{"text":"Nothing but great things to say about Fuel on Central ave. Always very welcoming  while dining in and awesome results when it's delivered. There has been a few new pizza places open up around Plaza Midwood but true to form Fuel has been and always will be my favorite!"}
{"text":"Not awesome! Ordered the Chicken Taco Pizza (should be called pico de gallo pizza), when we got it there was NO cheese on it...seriously?!? They sent us another one, but when it got here it was cold, the cheese wasn't even melted...not cool! 90% of the pizza was pico and there was very very little chicken on the pizza, I think between my two pieces I had 3 tiny tiny pieces...so disappointing! Was really expecting some great pizza and I was INCREDIBLY let down...will not be returning unfortunately!"}
{"text":"The pizza was good but it is so dirty and all of the tables are shaky.  Terrible atmosphere.  I like a dive if it has character- this place is just gross."}
{"text":"This is the Original Fuel (probably the best). Their ovens are ancient so you know that means great pizza. The staff are the best people you could ever want crafting your pie. There is a dude waiting on phone calls in one corner while a brave soldier folds pizzas boxes in the other. The dough man was steadily weighing his product while pounding the foundation of more pies to come.  I went earlier in the night and you could tell everyone was getting ready for their Friday night battle. I ordered the usual although not that usual since I recently parted from this area. The had my name, knew what I wanted and my order was set. 15-20 minutes they said, be here in 20 they said. I was there in 10 and the pie was ready 5 minutes later. Place was crowded, superb. Crust 10 out of 10. Toppings 10 out of 10. Sauce is boss. If your looking for New York pizza, stop, think about where you are, appreciate the history and enjoy your well crafted pie from a place I call home, the Original Fuel."}
{"text":"So last night I dropped into this Fuel in South End.  I had never visited this one before.  As soon as I walked in the door I was hit with a smell similar to that of a dumpster in the back lot.  I shook it off and walked into the main dining area to see three patrons - and it is 7:15pm.  I looked for a sanitation score but couldn't find it.  All three things considered, I did an about face and got out of there and went to a competitor.  Brixx doesn't sell slices, but my craving for a slice was trumped by the knowledge of a predictable and delicious product at a value - which is what Brixx offers."}
{"text":"Great team with quality service.  If you're around the area is best to check them out."}
{"text":"Pizza is very good, we've been a Fuel customer for long time at several locations. We don't have anything to complain about. The latest order was delivery & it was delivered on time & hot. The family was happy. Thank You!"}
{"text":"Went to Fuel to grab lunch.I had two slices of The Extreme Fuel Pizza which is pepperoni,Italian sausage,meatballs,ham and ground beef for the uninitiated as well as the Garlic Knots.There have been several restaurants in this particular spot over the years but I believe this one is gonna stick around on a while.The pizza was great and the service even better.Call and order ahead if you can because this place gets crowded really fast.This is a definite step up from your local corporate pizza fare.Enjoy."}
{"text":"Fuel pizza is usually decent. Good drunk food.   Tonight I visited the College St. Location sober and was pretty impressed with the quality of pie and quality of service. No over the top non-sense. Just thorough delivery of solid pizza.   It was around 9:50- didn't catch names. But Goldberg looking fellow that brought out pizza and desserts was hauling ass. He deserves a beer or 8."}
{"text":"Pizza is my absolute most favorite food in the world and I will normally eat any slice, no matter how \"good\" or \"bad\". It's pizza. That being said, I ate my whole slice but it definitely fell into the \"bad\" category. I'll give it two stars because 1. It's pizza and 2. The slices were pretty huge. But those were pretty much the only redeeming qualities. Not worth going back."}
{"text":"Out running errands on Saturday and decided to stop in for a slice.  Just shy of high noon and the pizza case display was already stocked full of single serve selections.  The typical fare of pizza, garlic and cinnamon knots, ready made salads etc.  The slices are nice and thin as they should be if they are going for NY style.    The down side is that reheating pizza always does it a disservice, but you have to know that going in for a slice.  However, being a crust lover, when I go to NY and get a good pie I can't wait for the crust and in this case it was over cooked and the crust was burnt.  I noticed that they have mulit-grain, gluten free and lactose free options.   Cute concept with the theme and I might be back if I just want a slice but would probably defer to Brixx for better all around taste even though it is a different style of pizza."}
{"text":"Even though the address says Trade St, this place is on the back corner of the Hearst Tower on College and 7th.   The best thing about this place is that it's open until 4am on the weekends. Don't bother going there between 1:30-3:00, however, since it is generally filled with drunken club goers. If you happen to BE one of those drunken club goers, then you should fit right in. Just don't get too rowdy or the cops will drag you out of line and toss you outside.  I don't bother with the slices or premade calzones anymore...they are ok, but if I want left-overs I'll make them myself. Get a whole pizza here or try the wings (not bad for a pizza place).   The best time to go here is early evening on a weekend night when the weather is nice. They will usually open up the windows, letting the breeze and sounds of the city flow in. I like to sit by the open window with a friend, a large pizza, and some beers and watch the clubbers roll by on their way to the alley. It's no hot tub in the Rockies, but it beats eating hot pockets in front of the tube."}
{"text":"Pizza that you can get at 3 in the morning if need be after swimming out of the College Street bars. Or, if you happen to be visiting the library or discovery place, a great place to take the kids for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"I love pizza by the slice. Greasy, cheesy, foldable deliciousness. Fuel has it, and it's simple- served on a paper plate, and hot out of the oven. Salads are good too, though pre-made, but always fresh. Counter service is friendly, and quick. Cannot be beat when on the run."}
{"text":"Don't fall for the $3 \"Brad's Cupcakes\"...they are dry and tasteless--almost as if they took a loaf of bread and put frosting on it.  The cinnamon knots are just as bad--but cheaper.  Pizza is good.  I've never had the calzone--but I've heard good things about it.   One other thing...this location is horrible to get out of.  Do yourself a favor and park away from the front door--if you do--you'll never be able to back out properly without ending in the street or being blocked by people pulling in."}
{"text":"I have always been a fan if fuel pizza however, after stopping by over lunch today I was left very disappointed. I got a calzone with meatballs. Usually a fav of mine. When I got it, it was barely warm on the inside and the cheese was not even melty."}
{"text":"The slices in the window can get a little sketchy if you come in at an off-time, but if you order a whole pie it's golden."}
{"text":"Superb wings & pizza!   Friendly staff, newer menu options, lunch combos, and all around excellent service!  I go there at least three times a week! The pizza's always warm and cooked exactly to my order, they have subs, fries, and salads for when I don't want pizza, too!   Super close to the lightrail, and open late on weekends:) my favorite place to eat!! Hands down!!"}
{"text":"Pizza is good if you eat it there but not if it sits for any length of time. I used to love getting the cheese slice and garlic knots in the restaurant as it was tasty and affordable. Now it's gotten kind of pricey for reheated pizza slices and 2 inch balls of dough."}
{"text":"I don't know what all the hype is over this place because I was not impressed at all. I was really wanting pizza-mind you I'm gluten intolerant so that is not an easy thing to do. At least not a good pizza. Since this is in my neighborhood and got good reviews I thought I would give it a try. The crust wasn't bad, a little under cooked but not the worst one I have had, just too soft. I ordered the vegetarian pizza. It was pretty bland, not much cheese. I was wondering why they were skimping on my cheese-pizza and cheese go hand in hand, so where was my cheese? Most of my crust was bare naked-no toppings or cheese. I had to add a bunch of red pepper flakes and parmesan cheese to give it some flavor. I was very disappointed since this 12\"(the only size for gluten free crust)with a tea cost me $19. I could have gotten a better gluten free pizza at Dominos-and probably saved a few bucks."}
{"text":"Blech. Went here for the first time tonight. Ordered online early in the evening (5ish) so they hadn't hit the dinner rush yet. The crust was soggy, only about 30% of the entire pizza had cheese on it, and it was COLD! I also tried the cinnamon knots which were just a chewy ball of dough with a smidgen of icing on top. I really have nothing positive to say about the food itself. Only reason it got more than one star is because they were fast (pickup, not delivery)."}
{"text":"The uptown location is AWFUL. We ordered wings, BBQ chicken pizza (no onions) and garlic knots. The estimated arrival time was 45 minutes. An hour and a half later we called the location and were told that they \"forgot to print our ticket out\" and that the order would be no charge. Another 45 minutes later and our order finally showed up. They forgot our garlic knots, and we were charged for the order. This location is lucky that it is conveniently placed with this kind of service. We will NEVER use this location again.  **Forgot to mention that our pizza had onions on it. Disgusting."}
{"text":"What can I really say?  I'm a sucker for pizza...and as they say...pizza is like sex...no matter how bad it is...it's still pretty good.  Fuel isn't anything special in the way of pizza, but this location has been better than the others I've been to.  The pizza is reasonably priced and somehow tastes better at this location.  That's not including the fact that the sauce isn't all that to begin with.  While I enjoy coming here with friends on occasion, I will mention the mishmash of bubbly service and tepid \"whadya wants\".  I'm not sure what the deal is with the inconsistent service, but I've never waited too long for my pizza, which is what really matters to me when I'm getting pie anyhow.  I'm kind of a pizza guy...and not from Charlotte originally.  Fuel is a New York style pizza...but it's not \"New York\" pizza...if you catch my drift.  If you're craving a slice of really good pizza...not your place.  If you're craving pizza and you love pizza like I do...you'll go anyhow...cuz it aint that bad.  Capiche?"}
{"text":"I live near this Fuel and have eaten here on many occasions. The mediocre pizza isn't my complaint (today). It's the terrible incident last night. I ordered a medium pizza for delivery.   20 minutes after scheduled delivery I call them to check up. I'm put on hold for a few minutes. Then transferred to a \"manager\". He tells me they ran out of pepperoni, so they couldn't make my pizza. He pauses and adds, \"I guess we should have called you.\" Yeah. I guess I should have called someone else. No more fuel for me."}
{"text":"This place is really bad.  Doughy, conveyor-belt pizza.  Basically, it's Papa John's inside a cool old gas station.  If you grew up anywhere up North or somewhere that has real pizza, skip this place.  It is really awful, and you're just asking for disappointment.  However, if your concept of \"good pizza\" is Papa John's, Domino's, or Little Caesar's, this place is for you."}
{"text":"So this isn't the first time I've had this happen.  I live within walking carry out vicinity of Fuel and they usually shut their doors about 30 mins early if not an hour every time I've tried to order.  I guess they enjoy laziness and not making money because if you can't stay open for a carry out order then why be in business.  It's no wonder Dominos and Papa Johns's make it to the next level.  They grow through quality of workers and professionalism.  I wish I could give 0 stars to the lackluster wanna be local pizzeria.  Don't put hours of service on your door or website if you can't maintain them.  Needless to say I've had my last Fuel experience."}
{"text":"Update.  I had an extremely bad experience over the holidays I was supposed to get a full refund. Guess What? I didn't.  So buyer be ware this place ranks as the worst pizza in the region."}
{"text":"I could probably eat pizza everyday and be completely satisfied but I can't just eat ANY pizza. I discovered Fuel Pizza when my mother brought me a slice of their lasagna pizza and I was instantly intrigued. Their pizza is thin with delicious crust and the toppings are great. I like places with really great specialty pizzas and Fuel has some really great ones. They offer combos which I would suggest if it is your first visit. It's a cheap way to sample a couple different types of pizza without committing to an entire pizza. I would also suggest the garlic knots. This will renew any New Yorker's faith in finding a decent pizza place in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Pizza is like art. Your dough acts as a canvas and your tomato sauce is like the paint... ok, I know, cut the crap. It's just pizza.  My mom came to visit this weekend and we found ourselves at the door of Fuel - the neon sign beckoning us in - so we accepted the invitation. First impression: Truck stop? Where is the gasoline smell? I mean, if they want to go all the way authentic they should just put in a gas pump. Heck, that would draw in plenty of people! We were the first ones there.. which was good because about 3 minutes later the line was out the door, literally. We each got a slice. I kept it plain, what can I say.. I'm a pizza minimalist. You can really tell a lot about a pizza place by the way a slice of cheese pizza tastes.. and this is.. average. Although I do love the thin crust I'm lost with the amount of grease. The sauce is good, not to sweet, but the cheese is sparse and knowing what you can get else ware makes it less worthwhile. I'd say this would be a good place to crash in a drunken stupor but for my sober days I'll head out to Rosario's in Concord. That's a real pie."}
{"text":"I'm really disappointed in Fuel. My hubby and I have been Fuel fans for years but my last visit was just that, MY LAST. The pizza was sad looking. I could've gotten a better frozen pizza than this. SMH"}
{"text":"Awful!!!! If i could give it no stars I would!!!! Awful!!!! Way way way over priced for bad/ok pizza... over $12.00 for 3 slices who do they think they are...? There food is Ok at best! I live and work uptown I will never go back and will warn friends to stay away!!!! AWFUL!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Not very busy on Halloween night at Fuel Pizza on South Blvd but yet I ordered my pizza at 9:14 pm for HERE and at 9:54 pm I have yet to receive my food. All employees on their phones and walking around eating pizza but yet we still have no pizza. The manager is on his phone and when we asked about the pizza everyone looking stupid not even knowing that we placed an order... They put the pizza in the oven while they were trying to find my pizza, no that doesn't work. Took a refund and kept it moving..."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of fuel pizza in general, but this one deserves a special shout out because out of all the other fuels I have been to this one by far has the best pizza, I don't know Wether they do something a little different from the rest with the recipe but, other fuel pizza should follow this particular fuel pizzas standard"}
{"text":"I stopped ordering from them. Pizza is just ok. Many moons ago it was much better. Tastes dry now and always skimpy on the cheese. You are basically paying for cardboard crust with toppings. Wings really are good if they get the order right. But just had to throw in the towel and give up on them. 4 of the last 5 times we ordered from the central ave location it was either bad, not what we ordered, did not even have our order one time, one time it was correct but again pizza was subpar and the last time I went to pick it the delivery guy had taken it by mistake. Done with them. Way too many options out there to deal with Fuel Pizza. They need a manager who can expo."}
{"text":"I am torn on this late night pizza joint. Great pizza, but absolutely the worst service I have experienced in a long time. Not only was the staff unable to correctly do their job, but they were rude to the customers and to each other. A supervisor ran around the restaurant screaming at customers about last call acting as if his paying customers were nuisances. His staff behind the counter talked about him and the customers while cursing as if no one could hear. After a staff member screwed up my order, she screamed at me that I was to blame and she was too busy to help and it wasn't her problem. Her supervisor did not help the situation.   Needless to say, I am happy that I do not frequent Charlotte enough to be tempted by their great pizza as I refuse to give them another one of my hard earned dollars due to their awful service. Suggestions: Clean up your unprofessional and rude staff!!"}
{"text":"This location is terrible. Every time I place an order, whether it be in person or over the phone, my order is wrong (I promise it's nothing complicated). The staff is friendly, yet unhelpful, especially when your order is delivered incorrectly. The response you'll receive is \"what do you want me to do about it?\" I want you to re-deliver my correct order!!   The food is good once corrected, but the other locations have much better service, especially Central Ave. Trust me, it's worth the extra drive to another location; steer clear."}
{"text":"Pretty weak pizza, pre-made slices always looks super stale...not a very good spot"}
{"text":"Meh.  That sums up the pizza.  I've had better and worse.  Location is good, comfortable interior.  Only had the slices, nothing else."}
{"text":"Pretty good slices with interesting topping combinations that really work.  I love the Italian Hoagie pizza and the Buffalo Chicken pizza. The wings are perfectly cooked and the Buffalo sauce is great."}
{"text":"Best pie I've had so far in Charlotte.  Love the lasagna pie and the buffalo chicken pie.  Decent late night hang out too.  Not as hip or crowded as the other spots... in fact it's Friday night and I'm writing the review here RIGHT NOW... WEIRD!"}
{"text":"Being new into town we heard good things about Fuel and wanted to give it try. Unfortunately it was extremely disappointing. Our mediocre pizza was delivered to our table first without a word from the waitress. Then the garlic knots 10 minutes later. After multiple attempts to get our side salads, they finally brought to our table at the end of the meal. It was pathetic looking salad with few toppings and old lettuce. Plenty of potential in this place but the service doesn't make it worth the mediocre pizza."}
{"text":"If it's pizza you want, consider somewhere else.  If you want the best Fuel pizza, consider a different location. I have tried this location several times out of pure convenience and been disappointed every time in the pizza. Opted once for a calzone and it was not much better.  There's much better pizza in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst ran eatery in Charlotte. It's mass chaos and nobody knows what's going on. Still waiting 45 mins after I ordered a calzone. If you need lunch fast you better stay away!"}
{"text":"The old manager is very rude. He needs to like learn how to talk to people and employees working here. First time at this location. And the last time for us! ZERO stars."}
{"text":"We ordered a large pizza here to go one night and were not disappointed. Great NY style pizza, thinner crust. Place was pretty cool, lots of race paraphenalia."}
{"text":"This was a pit stop on the way to a concert on the same street. We didn't have a lot of time so we popped into here. We ordered the wings and they where tasty and very well cooked. Only issue I had was I wanted water and they gave me a tiny tiny cup for water. I'm sure it was free but would have paid for a bigger cup.. nice rustic place with good food.. can't go wrong by stopping here...."}
{"text":"They advertised a 2 slice combo w/knots for $7 that we tried to order but were out of knots. The cashier said sorry they are out of knots so for 2 slices we had to pay more than the combo and get less.  The pizza was ok but rating it low due to the cashier not having critical thinking skills and understanding why that didn't make sense and charging the customer more than they should have for something that was not our fault."}
{"text":"Great and reliable late night spot. Good pizza and good wings. Staff works hard and it shows because the place stays clean and the orders are efficient. Well done. One tip is to try the wings, they are pretty good"}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed this Fuel location---friendly employees, quick service, Motown playing in the background with people watching opportunities aplenty (not to much a cozy patio on the side facing East Blvd) Their buffalo chicken and bbq chicken pizza rocks. And they do something to their sausage that is just absolutely spectacular, thinly sliced and seasoned just enough to make my mouth happy. Each time I carry out, I always get pizza but I need to try their wings sometime because I see them coming out to other tables smelling zesty as hell and regret my decision of not ordering them.   They offer a few coupons in the Citipass book--one for a BOGO slice and pie, get our Fuel on!"}
{"text":"Ordered chicken parm sandwich.... ALL bread and 3 tiny dried up pieces of chicken! Oh and bread was stale... Worst sandwich ever!! Definitely not work $9 bucks... Waste of money! Very disappointed.... No flavor, poor quality, and where the heck was the chicken ~  fuel?? Shame on you for even thinking this is acceptable! Wish I could get myoney back but at least I won't ever make the mistake of getting food here again."}
{"text":"This is what a large Ultimate Pepperoni looks like. They agreed to remake it, but no \"I'm sorry\" and who wants to wait again.  We've given them two \"do overs\" this is our last one."}
{"text":"I just sat here for over 30 min with a baby waiting on three slices of pizza that were in the window when I ordered and never came to the table. After several trips to the front looking for my order, in an empty store, our food never came. We finally asked for a refund with a now screaming baby and they couldn't find our order. This was our last trip to fuel, we love your pizza, but it seems the customers in your store are not important to you, as this is the second time we have been forgotten when ordering slices. We will not be back"}
{"text":"Very mediocre place with no service and ok place. We just ate pizza and the sauce was very sweet."}
{"text":"Fuel Pizza is good but definitely not the best in Charlotte. I like to come here when I am looking for a quick lunch fix  ( under $6 for a big slice and a salad, you can't go wrong there) or after a night of enjoying drinks. I like that they have different toppings from the standard  such as spinach/ricotta, bbq chicken etc compared to pepperoni, mushroom, etc. I hear that their full pizzas are a lot better than their slices and looks like they have a good variety of those as well. My slice of BBQ Chicken was flavorful but not memorable. All in all, good pizza in a pinch but it won't be winning my heart as \"Best Pizza in Charlotte\" anytime soon."}
{"text":"I usually come here when I'm in town for a convention and it's pretty Foss. But this year I was disappointed in not only the pizza but the service as well. I asked for the Hawaiian and got the Aloha which has jalapenos on it and was a little to spicy for me. Also as I was carrying it out since I got it to go it dropped out of the box onto my shirt and burned me. The dough was not done all the way through and the pizza was not that great overall."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible service - ordered a pizza using the Slice app around 11 last night, which should be fine considering they're open until 3am. Received an email from Slice confirming they received my order with a delivery ETA of 30-45 minutes. I waited well over 2 hours and no pizza was ever delivered. At this point, I contacted Slice and asked what happened and went to bed.   This morning, I promptly received a refund from Slice and an apology - they contacted Fuel Pizza who responded by saying \"They got busy and never made my order\". Seriously? I can understand being busy because it was late night on a Saturday, but to not even make the order at all or have the courtesy to call and let me know they couldn't fulfill the order is absolutely ridiculous. Will never order takeout or dine at any Fuel Pizza again."}
{"text":"The worst service I have ever encountered. Waited for two plus hours for a pizza that was never even made. Talked to a manger by the name of Dan or Dave and he repeatedly hung up the phone when I was calling to ask for a refund. I have never experienced such horrible service in my life. I asked to speak to another manager and the employees refused to give me a name or number of someone I could contact. Absolutely horrible service and experience."}
{"text":"Had the bacon, spinach and tomato calzone.  It's was good, crispy and just enough chewey also...  I'd come back to try something else, or I would order another one of those calzones :)"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a quick bite, crave pizza, and don't want to wait 20 minutes for a whole pizza to cook, Fuel Pizza is a great \"fast food\" pizza place.  And despite being quick, it's way better than most pizzas I've tried.    Their slices are huge and the pricing is great.  I can get a slice of pizza, side salad (so I don't feel like a total pig), and drink for about $7.  If you're a meat lover, the Extreme Fuel Pizza is the best.  It's loaded with all kinds of meat.  You'll wonder where the dough is!    Don't get me wrong -- they have a variety of other food options, too, like pizzas for the whole family/group, chicken wings, bigger salads, calzones, etc., but I usually pick Fuel for lunch and get the pizza/salad combo.  As a side note, I also enjoy the theming of Fuel Pizza, particularly this one on South Blvd.  For some odd reason, I love the thought of eating my pizza in a gas station themed place."}
{"text":"I hate that this is the closest pizza place to my house. The online ordering is terrible, you place the order online with their Co-company slice and then slice calls it it... except they never do. You end up having to call directly which defeats the whole purpose. Then they like to pick up and hang up the phone, leave you on hold for 10 minutes or they just flat out don't ever answer the phone and then get your order wrong. I keep trying to go back because it's so convenient but I'd really rather drive a few more minutes and not have to deal... i don't know how this location is still in business."}
{"text":"Why eat here when you can go to Luisas? Because it is Sunday, that is why and Luisas isnt open for lunch. Place is run by a gaggle of freaks with face tatts and all kinda disorders. That doesn't bother me. Just save the attitude for the rest of the Yung Jeezy Crue, OK? OK pizza when Luisas is closed."}
{"text":"This Fuel Pizza is one of the few places that you can find open on a Sunday night in the deserted Uptown streets.  We went to Fuel after being totally disgusted by the lack of service from the Uptown Pizzeria Uno.    Usually I just get a slice of pizza and a side, but during this visit, we ordered a Super size Extreme Fuel Pizza (my favorite -- generously topped with all sorts of meats).  We only waited about 10-15 minutes before it was brought out to our table (which was about how long we waited to be seated at the mostly empty Uno).  In the meantime, as we waited for our pizza, we munched on Fuel's yummy garlic knots (a great deal!).    The service we received and taste of our food washed away the bad taste Pizzeria Uno left in my mouth.  We were happy to find it open.  :-)"}
{"text":"After seeing the shiny Fuel in Uptown, I assumed this was a national chain. But no, here in Plaza-Midwood is the founding store, still one of only a handful in the state. It's a pretty neat little place but like Julia said, it's more about the convenience than the quality. The food is fast and easy, which is what you are looking for late at night. And on a hungry alcohol stomach nothing tastes better than pizza.  Food was cheap: 2 slices and 13 garlic knots for $11. If I had to do it again, I'd skip the knots. They were tougher than expected. I suspect that there is better food to be had on this street. I'll be back to confirm that shortly."}
{"text":"First time I've ever given a review. Went last night and service was RIDICULOUS. got there around 10:25 pm. Only one persons head of us. Took until 11:05 to get our order- it was 3 ALREADY MADE slices and 3 garlic knots. We only received 2 of the slices that we paid for and \"garlic knots\" were just bread- no flavor or anything. Everyone else in there was equally annoyed and waiting just as long, if not longer. Do NOT come here."}
{"text":"Think this place has the closest to buffalo pizza. The dough/crust is the best around i think. Affordable and a great place to hang out our get a quick bite. Also it use to be a gas station which is now a small pizzeria."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday (a Thursday) for lunch with my wife. (Side story: I met my wife there on a blind date in 1999 when it was Zarelli's.) The pizza was good and the price is right. Had to laugh at a previous reviewer mentioning screwed-up orders. They forgot my garlic knots, and thought my wife and I were splitting an order rather than the two meals we ordered. OK in the end, though. Good place for some lunchtime pizza or late night munchies I suppose. If you want to stop in for a couple slices and a Coke (Pepsi, actually) then this is the place."}
{"text":"I guess their pizza taste great if you're drunk. Slices are so bland and bad. Nothing special here. Overpriced as well. Villa Francesca has much better slices. Check them out instead."}
{"text":"Ordered my pizza just the way I wanted it.  With anchovies. Not the weirdest thing.  Pizza and anchovies. Come in to pick up my order. The kids behind the counter are talking about how disgusting anchovies are and as I'm leaving they are literally pointing out I'm  the one who ordered it. Just ok pizza and terrible customer service.  Won't be back. If I want to be critiqued about my eating habits I'll hire a nutrionist."}
{"text":"So I've ordered pizza a couple of times from Fuel. Both times have asked for extra cheese. Must say pretty lame, very thin layer. Not worth it, will look for pizza delivery from someone else."}
{"text":"So I held off posting a review on this place for fear of sounding like a sourpuss snob, and finally I had an experience that brought my experience up a star. Have they made improvements?? Will it sustain?? Hopefully.  So normally I would say pizza at Fuel is flat, greasy, never hot enough for me (I think it should be hot enough to make the cheese stringy or burn the top of my mouth, not solid coagulated lukewarm cheese) and there was something missing. What was that something missing? Dunno, but perhaps in the sauce. So I just wanted a little more. i think the wings are decent and the Brad's cupcakes are small, moist and light but also missing a certain je ne sais quoi.    However the other night I stopped in and was the only person in the joint and he heated my Ultimate Mushroom pizza up to the right temperature it was poofier and the mushrooms were awesome! It wasn't greasy at all! I would give it 4.5 stars which brought up my former 2 star experiences.   The interior is garage chic, and the service friendly so I will not complain if I have to go back."}
{"text":"The pizza is greasy but huge slices. The wings aren't that great and they charge $.50 extra for ranch. When wasn't ranch dressing the price of doing business. It's like charging for ketchup, what's the difference. Not cool!!!"}
{"text":"The pizza is ok. Nothing to write home about. They need to think about people with diabetes or medical issue that can't have sugar. Why have unsweetened tea but no sweeteners, they only have packets of sugar or sweet tea."}
{"text":"It ain't what it used to be, or maybe my taste buds have matured.  For sure they've let the quality of service fade over the last few years.  This location has been slow for a while, but I've noticed some of the others sliding recently as well.  Its reheated pizza and garlic knots.  No frills.  Nothing special.  It is what it is."}
{"text":"Don't worry about eating here.....they don't care if you do.     Just had a horrible experience with Fuel off of South Blvd. I ordered through a delivery company before 10 am. It was supposed to be delivered by noon. The delivery driver showed up at 11 AM to make sure that everything was good. After multiple attempts from the driver to find out the status of the pizzas (and keeping in touch with me), he told me they wouldn't give him a status anymore. I called the store and sat on hold for over 10 minutes until someone finally came and hung up on their end. I called the driver again, and he put the manager on his phone. I spoke with the manager, trying to figure out why there was an issue. One pizza (out of 5 whole pizzas) was done...and it would take about an hour for the other 4 to get done. By that time, the first one was going to be cold. The manager seemed like he just didn't care. This order was roughly $120. Can't believe they don't want repeat business like that."}
{"text":"Very personable staff.  I've had the pleasure of meeting the managers Tim and Mark.  Also the delivery guy Chad is pretty cool as well.  The pizza isn't the best I've ever had, but the speed that it comes out and the friendliness of the service makes it my go to place for a quick bite in the plaza midwood area.  Lots of different slices to choose from in this converted old gas station.  Plenty of specials all at reasonable prices.  No place better to be for a quick bite late night on the weekends IMHO!"}
{"text":"So I give this place two stars because the food is good but I ordered delivery at 7:20pm and was told it would be a 30-45 min wait. At 8:08pm I called the store to remind them to call upon arrival to make sure I know that they were there. At this time I was told that the the delivery driver had already left for my order. At 8:20pm, an hour later the delivery had not arrived and I called again. The person who answered was extremely rude and I hung up and called back requesting a manager who said he would check with the driver on the status of my pizza. At 8:32pm an hour and 12 minutes later the delivery driver arrived with the wrong order because they ran out of something that I ordered and never had the courtesy to let me know on the 3 calls that my order would not arrive as I had requested and paid for. I never was given a receipt to sign and was not able to ensure the driver was tipped. I hope I am not screwed out of my money."}
{"text":"Service is sub par. Took 35 minutes to get a cheese pizza slice. Confused orders, and was late when the food did finally deliver. You could literally do better by microwaving ramen noodles."}
{"text":"I really don't have much to say about this restaurant other than after a Hornets game and your staying at the Holiday Inn city center hotel located across the street this open late cheap eats place can fill you up on the cheap. The food was not the best thing I've ever had. It was around 11pm after the game and we had 2 slices of pizza a small salad and 5 wings (garlic salt and pepper) and fries. Everything came to around $20 and it wasn't gross so I'm going to say we chalk this up to a win. Fuel Pizza not great but not bad either. If it's late and you're hungry give this place a try."}
{"text":"So i called in to place my order and a young lady asked me to hold on and never returned to the phone. I was on hold from the time i called to the time it took me to drive up there on my 30 min break and place my order in person!!!!! Mind you still on hold the whole time when i arrived i had been on hold for 7 mins thus far. I walked inside and there was nobody in line and only 2 people sitting down eating. When I ask the young man behind the counter who's in charge he pointed to a young lady who had a ponytail and was Caucasian standing off to the side talking on her cell phone and laughing and giggling and I do mean her personal cell phone all while I'm still on hold when I asked her was she the one that put me on hold she tried to convince me that they didn't had five calling orders which could not have been the case because she was not on the job phone if you ask me is unacceptable unprofessional and just a blatant disregard for customer service they won't have to worry about me coming back! *UPDATE* then to add insult to injury I just get back to work and this pizza is undone!!!!!!!! So not only have I wasted a whole lunch break but I wasted it on something that can't even be consumed you got to be kidding me!!!!!! THEY WILL NOT GET ANY MORE OF MY BUSINESS!!!!!!"}
{"text":"It was fine. We were in the area for a football game and wanted to grab a quick bite before braving the crowd, and the cold... not to mention the obscenely priced stadium food.   The service was quick. My Dad's french fries took the longest (no, I don't know why he ordered french fries). Mom had a salad which she said was fresh and a good size. I had a slice of pizza which was ok. They make their pizzas ahead of time then warm slices to order as many of the pizza by a slice places do. Mine was a little dry and unevenly warmed.   This place was ok for what we needed, but I won't be back unless it's our only option."}
{"text":"Fuel is a convenient place to get an average meal. The decor is great, but the service is slower than one might expect at a fast-ish food restaurant. I got a chicken parm sandwich, a salad, and garlic knots. They were fine.  I got a soda and tried to use Pepsi's version of the magic Coke machine, and it tasted terrible. Reverted back to the original Pepsi fountain machine."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Pizza was very tasty, hot and full of flavor.  Very helpful staff for us visitors to the area."}
{"text":"I wish I could give a zero rating.  Given the choice between Fuel Pizza and cold cereal I will choose the cereal.  Horrible experience.  Food was so cold the cheese had solidified.  Serving size was paltry.  Go elsewhere for pizza, calzones etc."}
{"text":"This is not a great pizza place ... probably one of my least favorite I've ever had ... and that's a bold statement. Most of my friends feel the same way too. Quality is not good, and the taste is blah. For the price ... you can do MUCH better. I'd take Papa John's over this any day of the week."}
{"text":"Don't bother, really.  It's better than Papa John's, but if you have a few extra minutes, go a couple of blocks further down on West Blvd to Blaze.  Superior in virtually every way a pizza can be.  You'll smile more when you leave Blaze."}
{"text":"The people here do not wash their hands. I watched them walk in and out the kitchen and not one person went to a sink. The lady making the pizza walked around tossing the dough. Then another lady went from opening a box to putting the toppings on the pizza.  I'm not sure how they received a 93 rating from the Health Inspector.  This is disgusting."}
{"text":"You know how they say when you hungry everything taste good, well guess what that shyt is a lie. This place was horrible, the only good thing here was the damn cherrywine pop from the fountain machine. I don't care how cheap it is or how it was open late they were open but I will never eat here again. If you see this location just run..... I'll probably give the one on the north side a chance or I'll just say fuck it and go to the frozen food section a the grocery store because that shyt would taste better than here ."}
{"text":"They are the fastest delivery pizza I have ever had...I travel a ton and often use delivery for late night food or just on busy, lazy nights. I have ordered from here 2X (once last week & again tonight) both times the pizza was piping hot and delivery exceeded my expectations.   Tonight the gentleman even called just to make certain I wanted the pizza tonight - I guess their system showed tomorrow. AWESOME!   Pizza tastes good too and they remember my drink, which companies often forget too!"}
{"text":"Fuel is the perfect stop on your way home when all you want is no-nonsense, standard, good pizza. It's not fantastic, but it's not bad. In fact, it is pretty good. Just don't expect fancy schmancy pizza here, and you'll leave happy.   They have a good selection of toppings. They have a few beers and some salad options. I thought the wheat crust was a nice option, though they were out last time I went so I haven't tried it yet. Kudos for having gluten-free options and for offering several different sizes of pies.   Service was slow, but they were busy, and I wasn't in any hurry, so I didn't mind. Small parking lot could be a problem on a busy night. This would be a great option for watching a basketball game (they have a few TVs) or throwing a kids birthday party. Bottom line: it's a solid neighborhood joint that will definitely count me among its return customers."}
{"text":"Tough being a Steelers fan in the middle of Panther Country. The server was nice even though she was a huge Cam Newton fanatic. The Calzone was great according to my daughter. All I know was the Dr. Pepper was perfect. The place has a family vibe and would be ideal for watching a football game if they weren't playing the Panthers. I would go back to have fun talking to the staff and having a slice. Go Steelers."}
{"text":"Buyer beware!!  Absolutely worst Pizza in all of Charlotte. Over cooked fries, bland pizza, and poor customer service. I'll eat a Digiorno pizza 100x's before I ever eat that again."}
{"text":"Quick delivery in the Chantilly neighborhood. Was just the right thing at the end of a moving day!"}
{"text":"I was actually pleasantly surprised by this place... not sure if it's because is was 1am, but the pizza was great and fresh. Prices were reasonable, location is great, and the garlic knots were yummy. I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"Our group stopped in for some much needed drunken munchies after a night out.  The fact that we could get decent pizza at such a late hour is worthy of 4 stars to me.  The service was quick and they had a good variety of pizza slices to choose from.  I thoroughly enjoyed my pepperoni slice and garlic knots.  The pizza crust is thin and New York style, but the outer edge of the crust had a little extra thickness to it that I liked.  One of the best things about Fuel Pizza at that hour is the crowd of people that accumulates.  The huge open space of Fuel is good for socializing, or just sitting back to watch other people socialize.  There tends to be quite a random mix of people late into the night.  Fuel would probably not be my #1 choice for pizza in Charlotte, but it makes for the perfect ending to a night out uptown."}
{"text":"There are so many amazing pizza joints in Charlotte, but this one holds close to my heart. Not because it's the best, but because of the accessibility. Great location, cheap/decent, pizza, quick service, reliable food, great for anytime of day. This is totally my go to drunk pizza of choice.   Of course if I want a good quality pizza I would just go down the street to Brixx, but for the price and quick service, this is a staple."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Stopped in to meet a fellow Uber driver tonight. Ask the cooks if they could make a crustless,sauseless pizza and they dis. It was so good and I will be back. Thanks for great pizza my way."}
{"text":"I was not impressed at all with Fuel. The pizza was dry and flavorless. The only spark of a positive was the wheat veggie pizza. It felt healthy, but still was lacking any flavor."}
{"text":"I will now pay Fuel the biggest compliment that a Jersey girl who went to school in NYC can pay a pizza place: Fuel's pizza reminds me of home.  The crust is the proper thickness and consistency. The sauce is seasoned but not to an extreme. The cheese is nice and melty. There is red pepper flake and garlic powder on the tables (There is also grated cheese but I refuse to acknowledge that it has any right being on a slice). The garlic knots will give you breath to knock out a dog (this is a desired result). There is a respectable beer selection to wet your whistle. And most importantly, very most importantly, they are perfect folding slices.  They are open nice and late so Fuel is great for a post-bar food fix. If you are getting delivery (because sometimes you just don't want to have to put on pants to get delicious pizza) I highly suggest the online ordering for ease and convenience."}
{"text":"Let me paint the scene for you: It's about 2:30 am on a Saturday night/Sunday morning. My friends and I have been at the Lady Gaga show for the past 4 hours, before that we were in a hotel room imbibing in a few adult  beverages. Now it's late, we're starving and there is no McDonalds in sight (by the way, what's up with that?!) So we beg our cab drive, 'PLEASE SIR, Take us to somewhere that's delicious!' And Fuel Pizza is what we found, or rather what we were taken to.   There was good and bad to this trip (bear with me, my mind is a little foggy on the exact details). We arrive, step out of our cab and see that the line is out of the door and down the street a few people. Yikes. But we're hungry, and we're a little tipsy* so of course we decide to wait. We chat, time goes by, but it is a LONG wait. On the plus side, I think it's awesome that there is a pizza place that stays open past 2am - that's a very rare find where I'm from in the Hampton Roads area.   Anyway, we finally get to order: a few slices and a few garlic knots. The prices are good, I think I paid 6 bucks for a drink, a garlic knot, and two slices of cheese. The pizza is alright - it's thin crust and greasy, but let's be real - that's the best kind of pizza when you've been out and about all night being tipsy*. So it was a fun experience, just me, my friends, and every other drunk in Charlotte waiting for a slice of pie.  *We took cabs ALL night long. If you're gonna be tipsy, be responsible."}
{"text":"While attending a trade show in Charlotte, I had a few minutes after setting up the booth and needed to grab a quick bite.  and Fuel was just that.  I had a slice of the Extreme Pizza (all meat) and a Hawaiian slice (ham and pineapple).  The toppings tasted fresh enough and the sauce was ok.  The problem is that the crust tasted a little to fast food to me.  It was crispy but there was something about it that reminded me of  domino's or papa john's.  Overall, I'd go back for a quick bite, but I wouldn't expect much more than that,"}
{"text":"The original Fuel Pizza in Plaza-Midwood is everything a local pizza point with big slices and generous toppings in a converted service station.  I can't say I'm a huge fan of Fuel @ Plaza Midwood, but I can't find much wrong with it either.  Fuel is a good bet for pizza wherever you can find one.  I highly recommend the strombolis here-they warm them up in the oven when you order them and serve them with marinara sauce.  The pizza slices are good as well.  The crust tastes like brick oven pizzeria crust and they always put generous slabs of fresh mozzarella cheese on whatever they make. Yum!  If you are jonesing for slices of pizza though, be sure to do so during the lunch hour peak.  Otherwise, you might find the pizza slices dried out.    The Plaza Midwood location is smaller than other Fuels, though the outdoor patio is ideal for people watching in Plaza Midwood.  The staff are pretty friendly as well, so I regularly stop in for a quick bite for lunch or cheap meal before a night in Plaza Midwood."}
{"text":"How can you go wrong with pizza and wings?  Well, I guess you can, but Fuel does it right. This is a super fast lunch spot that offer salads (though you get them from a fridge - they are actually always fresh tasting) slices or pies and an assortment of wings and sandwiches.  It's a totally casual place with no frills. I've been here twice in the last 3 weeks which is kinda weird for someone like me, but they are located right next to our office and grabbing a salad here is really easy."}
{"text":"The pizza is BOMB!!! i love it, the dough, the crust, the size, the distribution of topping all just perfect! I really have no complaints and have never had a bad experience. My go to pie is the Sun Dried Tomato and Pesto pizza. It is amaaaaazing and they do not at all skimp on toppings. There is so much pesto and tomato on it, you feel like you get what you paid for because this place isn't cheap. It is 100 percent worth every penny and I do not feel like I have been ripped off where as some other pizza places are very cheap with their topping/sauce. Love it, great jobs guys! Cheers!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today and I had a great experience; no complaints.  When we walked in, we were greeted by a friendly gentleman who quickly took our order - one pepperoni slice, one pepperoni/pineapple slice, with three garlic knots.    Our food was thrown into one of their monster ovens while we waited patiently at a table of our choice.  Our food was brought to us piping hot in about 3-4min.  The pizza was awesome.  The crust was solid, but not in an intrusive way.  Plenty of sauce was evening distributed across each of our slices, and there was a plethora of toppings on each slice as well.  -I like that they have plenty of condiments, pepper, napkins, ketchup, etc at each table without even having to ask. -I like that you help yourself to drinks via a Pepsi soda station to the right as you walk in.  So its as much of whatever you want drink-wise. -They DELIVER!  I feel like this may be a known but forgotten fact amongst many Charlotteans.    Its great pizza and I can't wait until I go BACK!"}
{"text":"Great wings and pizza, though I did find the wings a tad overpriced. Staff was friendly, the restaurant was clean, and would definitely come back here again for some late night grub!"}
{"text":"Great spot for a slice and a beer.  Quick,  easy,  very friendly.   Had a slice if the extreme - excellent.   I'd add the fifth star for beer on tap,  but I might be asking for too much for such a casual place."}
{"text":"I don't mean to be defensive about Fuel, but I feel like many of the reviews ooze an aura of negativity about this classic Charlotte eatery.  Well, here's the straight forward, unbiased deal, from a native New Yorker and a pizza connoisseur...   Yes, the inside is a bit grimy.   No, they don't have beers on draft.   Yes, the customer service can be spotty. Yes, its the original Fuel. Yes, this is the best pizza in Charlotte. Yes, I am a fan. Yes, I will be back!"}
{"text":"Great food, very clean, however, the service is very rude and even a little racist. I'd give 5 stars if it wasn't for the service being rude and racist. Also the bathroom was a little dirty. Other than that the food was great"}
{"text":"Staff was incredibly rude. Food was ok but won't be coming back to a place with that kind of service."}
{"text":"Despite what some people say, the old original Fuel location was on Trade Street, just a bit down from the heart of downtown. The newer location in the Hearst Building and on South Blvd try to reach the heights the old one had, but they fall just a bit short in my opinion. For a long time this was my favorite pizza place in Charlotte (along with Wolfman), because they had that true NY style of thin slices with heaps of greasy meat piled on top. I will second the opinion given below that the single slices heated up are definitely not the way to go, if you are going to come here you have to get a fresh pie for the true experience.  The non-pizza items are also pretty good, especially the wings. If you like hot stuff as much as I do try them Inferno style, just have plenty of water or beer to cool your mouth down! The garlic knots are also dangerously addictive, and if you're not careful you can easily fill up quickly before your pizza is even ready. Overall I still think Fuel is the place to go if you want some REAL pizza, and I don't think Charlotte has anything to knock it off the throne just yet."}
{"text":"Living in central Charlotte a few years back my guy and I haunted Fuel on Central quite often. The pesto sauce was always perfection and they never skimped on the cheese. Never had a bad slice, never felt sick or off in the stomach afterwards.After moving back from Austin Texas and now on the west side we have chosen to get our pies from this location on South.   In a word: Greasy. Hands down the greasiest pizza pie I have ever experienced and the service is mediocre at best.  The past couple times we have gotten physically ill meaning I can now recite word for word what it says on the back of my shampoo bottle after spending so much time in the bathroom! I'm not sure if it's a matter of the people who prepare the food not properly washing their hands or what but come on. The last time we ate there and got sick was not the only time we ate there and got sick.   Bottom line: It doesn't matter how tasty the food is going in and down if it makes you feel like something is gnawing at your insides afterwards.   From now on if I want pizza I'll make the drive to the Central location. My insides rejoice in knowing this!"}
{"text":"(See pizza picture with carrots) First... why would you mess up a perfectly good buffalo chicken pizza with carrots. But I order it without carrots, and yet I walk home and they're still there. What a disappointment. Also, disregarding the carrots, the pizza was just ok."}
{"text":"Gluten free pizza couldn't get any better! I love coming here for pizza. The price has unfortunately risen, but that's ok. Because it is the best gf pizza I've ever had, I will keep coming back here. The associates are always nice. I order online and my food is always ready!"}
{"text":"Waited 15 minutes for 2 slices of pizza and was the only person in the place. Eventually just got a refund. Nobody seemed to care at all, will not go back."}
{"text":"Hungry for wings for lunch. Went to Fuel pizza in Davidson. Delicious, big, added a wonderful Cobb salad. The pizza is so delicious too. They has calzones and Stromboli and garlic knots. There are Fuel pizzas all over the Charlotte area"}
{"text":"Great pizza, and even better service!  All the way from the gentleman that took our order to the very kind and happy delivery man that brought our pizza with a huge smile!  First day on the job for him, he's a keeper!  Thanks, Fuel Pizza!!"}
{"text":"We came here because we heard it had good wings. We felt like some pizza, so combined the two and ordered the buffalo chicken pizza. When we did get the pizza, I was disappointed. It wasn't horrible, but I've had better buffalo chicken pizza. For food, I would give the pizza 3 stars (I still want to go back for the wings though). They get an extra star from me for the customer  service. When we got our pizza, they brought out a BBQ chicken pizza. Usually we would shrug off the mistake and enjoy anyway, but we happened to be in the mood for something spicy. They not only apologized, but boxed the BBQ pizza and gave it to us for free while they remade the buffalo pizza. I was impressed."}
{"text":"No wonder it only has 2.5 stars. Terrible service and limited options on a Friday at 8pm...if it's between going hungry or eating here...do yourself a favor and just don't eat. Well worth it."}
{"text":"I got a sausage,onioh and pepper sub, couldn't find much sausage, while sub was heater it still had cold spots and bread was soggy partly. Don't get this sub not worth the price"}
{"text":"Well I semi enjoyed my first slice but unfortunately the second slice of plain cheese had hints of mushroom on it and mushroom is my ultimate kryptonite.  I was the first customer of the day so I guess to be able to offer more than one type of slice they make one pie with sections of different topping so I guess if your like me I would not suggest being the first few clients.  I do not like ordering a plain slice only to have it taste like something else, I was at this location once before and I asked for a buffalo chicken slice and the girl was like oh we are not making that one today unless you order a whole pie.  So as this being the second strike I believe I'm done.... but If your not as picky as me with my pizza being from ny then you should be fine"}
{"text":"Talk about the worst fuel pizza I've ever been to... just walked in from the boat show was there at 630 pm on a friday.... there was nothing but 2 slices of 4 types of basic pizza....they all looked crusty and old. I asked the guy behind the counter if they were going to make buffalo chicken pizza tonight the nasty Hispanic man making pizza was asked by the guy we asked nastier and short he said no only with full one.... looking at the regular slices how crusty they looked I asked if they were going to make fresh regular pizza ....Nasty Hispanic one again nasty and short said ...NO. ..REALLY DUDE...WTF DO YOU MAKE SINCE YOU APPARENTLY HATE YOUR JOB AND DON'T WANT TO MAKE PIZZA. ..We left and we will go somewhere else and never go back there....maybe he will be happier at taco bell because clearly pizza is not his game"}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Expensive for pizza though. One of those places where the pizzas are cooked ahead of time and you pick the slice. They reheat them but sometimes the pieces are stale. It also prevents you from ordering some types by the slice as they aren't on the day's rotation."}
{"text":"I didn't want to write this review, but it will be short.  Couldn't wait to get my pizza, but upon entering and walking to the counter, the pizza maker, takes out a nasty wash cloth or snot towel, blows his nose, puts in his pocket and then proceeds to pick up cheese and pepperoni to continue making a pizza.    I threw up in my mouth.  The nastiest thing I've ever seen and I will NEVER go back.  I didn't know what to do, so I ordered fries, garlic knots and 2 slices that came straight from the oven, all I could think of was the snot tissue. . I couldn't finish the food and you're right I should've never ordered.  I hope management addresses this...."}
{"text":"Ugh! Why does this place exist??? The boneless wings were crazy salty. Maybe I shouldn't order boneless wings... I normally don't but I didn't feel like dealing with bones that day.   So I got some pizza... Yea that wasn't good either. No flavor to the sauce... At all. The pizza seasoning did a lil something something, but yea not worth even $1.   Huuuu... Again, why does this place exist?"}
{"text":"Comparable to the worst pizza you'd find in NY. And you can't get a fountain water on top of it all. Tread lightly."}
{"text":"Place is \"okay\".   Normal feel of a pizza joint with some vintage decor.    Typical local pizza joint customer service... High school kids doing summer help.   Didn't see anyone who appeared over 24.   We ordered the \"award winning\" taco pizza, and honestly wasn't to impressed. I felt I could of done a better job. Not sure if I'll come back.  Definitely going to check out Ma's next."}
{"text":"My family and I stopped here late night one evening while in Charlotte. We liked the layout and everyone was very professional & nice. We ordered a pepperoni pizza and mild wings which came up quick. Our food was very good and as ordered no complaints at all and we would recommed this place."}
{"text":"We were looking for a pizza place downtown open late and stumbled upon Fuel. Even at 1:30 a.m., the place was packed, albeit with inebriated post-clubbers speaking at the same volume they did on the dance floor. The pizza was good and the prices were reasonable - we loved the little garlic bread balls. I didn't find the place dirty - the only thing that pained the eyes were the horrible ensembles worn by the patrons. Cocktail dresses should NOT be worn with flip-flops, ladies, and disco ball-inspired clothing IS as ridiculous as it sounds."}
{"text":"This is the first time in my life that I have had my legal rights violated at an establishment.  I have a service dog that can smell my food allergies and this can save my life since epi pens do not work on me. I went to fuel pizza on south boulevard and was asked to show my documentation for my dog. 1 establishments can only ask me if that is a service animal 2 they can ask how my dog assists me They said they needed the documentation for my dog which is illegal. No establishment can ask that as it is a medical record protected by HIPPA. Asking for anyone's medical record is against the law.  My dog was wear a vest, which is also not legally required. The police explained to the establishment my correctness on the topic. So they then said well we just are refusing her service then. I have never been treated this disrespectful by a restaurant."}
{"text":"Not sure if I can post a NO STARS review- we've been here off an on for 15 years, when we visit Family in Charlotte. Went today and they wouldn't accommodate my wife's garlic allergy (sauce w/out Garlic) headed over to the Hearst Tower location , where we got what we wanted! So, we can't recommend the Origin, Iconic Fuel; bad customer service is just bad customer service:"}
{"text":"OK so how this works is, my wife has food allergies. Normally, that means no pizza. Not at this Fuel, Oh no! After being turned away, at the original Fuel on Central, (they were busy/sauce premade/we don't know how,) Jordan made scratch sauce and a perfect custom pizza. We're from Boston, and this was the perfect capstone to our Carolina vacation this year. Jordan treated us right!"}
{"text":"Fifty percent of my delivery order was wrong. They didn't seem too surprised. Driver said\"that's what they gave me.\""}
{"text":"Fuel looks so great from the outside, but the first time I went here and had a slice from their display case, I was very disapointed.  You could tell that the slice had been sitting in the case for awhile and was just not hot enough, even after they warmed it up. Notsogood. This second time at Fuel, I learned from my earlier mistake and had them make an entire pie for my friend and me.  Bingo!  A much better experience.  The sauce was quite good as were the toppings.  I really like the novel concept of the place (a old timey gas station turned pizza place), and it has a cheery interior as well as free refills on fountain drinks.  I don't think it will be a destination place for me, but now that I know how to order, I could see myself returning.  Again, as a word of advice:  avoid the slices."}
{"text":"This place is good because it's convenient. Is it the best pizza place in Charlotte? No, however it is much better than your typical chain pizza restaurants like Papa Johns or Dominos. Stepped in here for a veggie pizza and some fries while I was on the go. It took a while to prepare the fries because one of the cooks forgot, but I honestly wasn't expecting much when it comes to customer service from this place"}
{"text":"I love this place. The store needs some updating and cleaning but it's none the less charming to me. The concept of being in an old oil shop I pretty cool.   I love the pizza. It's simple and always consistent. I have had many great evenings with family in here.   I will be back and recommend this place to anyone looking for good pizza.   If you're new to the area check out Whit's frozen custard down the street when you finish your pizza."}
{"text":"Just had this. Food is good enough to digest but definitely not the best. Their staff is very well mannered and helpful! Very crowded establishment. Probably need a few extra hands to keep the place clean."}
{"text":"If by somehow you have made it to this Fuel Pizza, you are more than likely hammered just getting out of the bar.  While the pizza might seem like the best pizza in the world, its not.  That is alcohol fooling your tstebuds.  Its's just mediocre fuel pizza"}
{"text":"This place was a shitshow, the food LOOKED good but we never got to try it because they were out of half the things on their menu, they charged us different prices than what was posted on the menu, there was no ice, the guy at the register had NO clue what he was doing. The pizza looked really good, but it was not worth the headache of trying to order. They were out of garlic knots, they were out of strombolis. They charged us $44 for a family deal that should have been $35. We canceled our order and left. You've got to have the patience and tolerance of a saint to eat here. If they had better systems/training in place they would have a shot."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite pizza place in CLT. The magherita is always amazing. Their slices are big and thin, and they sell by the slice. Being a veg, I can't speak for the wings, but the garlic knots are tasty.  This location is consistent with production and level of awesome. They keep the tables clean, and the food is hot. Can't say the same for other locations! Love it here."}
{"text":"Well, it's not that good. Sorry.  The \"by the slice\" pizza looks old and dry. The salads are cheap, yes, but they're tiny.   The pizza itself looks like a decent take on New York pizza. The texture of the crust is right:  flexible but with just a little crispness on the bottom.   But sadly, the crust is almost tasteless. It's not bad, but it's very basic and kind of bland."}
{"text":"We've been searching for a good pizza place for over a year. With so many NYers here, how in the world are most pizza places so bad or just not exactly right?   Fuel Pizza's NY Style is the best of its kind in the Lake Norman/North CLT area. Crust, sauce are the highlight. Great local beers available a plus as well."}
{"text":"Live in uptown Charlotte and decided to try delivery order.  It took them about 1 hour and the pizza was cold."}
{"text":"This pizza had great crust but pizzas as a whole are thin.   Was a little irritated with the pricing. Combo includes two slices, two knots, and optional drink for $8.77.   Although it doesn't say, that is just cheese and the cinnimon knots. Anything else, the prices go up. I got 1 cheese, 1 pepperoni, garlic knots and drink for $10.04. Those were the cheapest options.   A 12\" cheese pizza would have been the same price.    I have it 3 stars because the food was actually had decent taste. And the service was pretty quick.   Just watch how you order. Don't immediately go for the combos, look at the other options."}
{"text":"Have only eaten there.  Loved it.  Delicious.  Good value. Last time,  though,  was told an hour wait for a pie :(  Advice: Eat there.  Call first."}
{"text":"What better place to go eat after a night out in Charlotte? Fuel Pizza Cafe is a great spot to hit up!  Not only because its close by and one of the few choices that are open at this hour, but it is pretty delicious I must admit.  The wings are a must get here, These would be comparative to a BWW or even a wingstreet kind of deal.  They have just enough flavor for a nice kick in tangyness.  The sauce is just enough where it will not create a mess.  You can also go for the dry rub which im not a big particular fan of, however it was still good enough to my liking.   Ofcourse, you can always go for the pizza which is a bit pricey, but it still gets the job done.  Not to mention the big cookies they have :D."}
{"text":"I hate to put 1-star because the pizza is good.  The reason I have to put a bad review is because we were having a birthday party at the near by rock climbing facility Inner Peaks. We first tried to call to place an order no answer after four tries. We decided to go to the restaurant to place the order and get them to deliver.  We were denied delivery so we decided to pick up the pizza at an agreed upon time of 5pm. (Ordered at 3:45). Arrived to pick up the pizza at 5pm to find out the pizza were not even cooked or started.  Manager would not offer any refund or condolences for the delay. We will suggest using another close by pizza place to cater your birthday party in the area."}
{"text":"After the bars and clubs close uptown, this is one of the few eateries open, and it seems that half of uptown descends upon this place. Expect everyone in line to be at least mildly intoxicated, and a longer line than Macy's on Christmas Eve. Bear with the wait and crowd, and you'll be treated to decent pizza and wings at prices slightly higher than the competition.   Not bad, but if you're having a pizza fix at a decent hour there are better alternatives uptown. I'm sure they make a killing catering to the late night crowd, but why wouldn't they? Sometimes gluttonous pizza with friends is all you need after a long Friday night."}
{"text":"The place truly deserves the bad reviews.  The service is poor. We waited 15 mins for someone to take the order just because the person wasn't paying enough attention. This is when he saw us coming and waiting to order.  The pizza is average so I'm giving 2 stars for the pizza."}
{"text":"I just moved into the Plaza Midwood neighborhood and was thrilled to find that Fuel delivered to our new place. I ordered the five cheese calzone which was delicious. Their marinara appears to be home made which makes it all the better. The herbs they added to the calzone were what hit the spot for me though. My husband had their veggie calzone and he was super pleased. It had a variety of veggies in it including spinach. I will def. be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Ordered a deliver pizza tonight...opened the box to have a slice and a ROACH ran out from the box!! Damnit I'm so disappointed because I know Fuel has great pizza but the roach thing makes me want to vomit. I guess the good news is they refunded my money but that's all they offered. I immediately ran the box and its contents out to the garbage bin! Yuck, yuck, yuck!!"}
{"text":"Horrible! Could be worst service and pizza I've had! Took 40 minutes to get our complete order, and when we got it it was wrong, burnt and still incomplete. Guy at counter simply said \"I'm doing the best I can\"... no apologies, no offer to make it right.. we were there with relatives who were from out of town and spent over $70. We won't be back. Eat here at your own risk...  4/18 - Spoke with Area Director and had a very good conversation and he apologized and is working to correct the problems. Good conversation."}
{"text":"Ive been to this location a couple times and the pizza is good, but the WINGS are AWESOME! They are the best wings I have found at a pizza joint. The garlic knots are also great. I would still prefer other pizza places to this one though."}
{"text":"The northmost outpost of the Fuel Pizza empire is very similar to the original on Central Avenue.  Located on Main Street in Davidson, it is small, and unlike a few other locations downtown, looks like it actually might have been a gas station at one point.  The food is typical Fuel though...great pizza!  For me they have been very consistent and have been great from location to location.  The gas station motif is in full-effect here, and there is a small outdoor patio in the front as well, where you can sit, enjoy your pizza pie and watch traffic saunter by in this laid-back southern village."}
{"text":"Ok, so we just ordered from Fuel Pizza Cafe...two fries with cheese, two subs, an order of chicken fingers and a side salad, which came up to $37 and change...I was taken aback when the delivery guy came, and handed us the wrong order...no problem...he corrected it, then stated he needed to go back for the salad...ok, once again no problem...I called the restaurant to confirm that there wasn't anything else I had forgotten (I had already forgotten what we ordered), and Tim (the person who was taking orders) was none to pleased of the phone call...he was unapologetic, rude, and somewhat condescending...the portions did not justify the price + the bad attitude from someone who is on the phone TO TAKE PHONE CALLS AND ATTEND TO CUSTOMERS, leaves me to give this eatery a poor review...thanks Tim!"}
{"text":"I moved into the  Factory South Lofts about four years ago. I was all excited about Fuel pizza being only a couple blocks away. Well, the food is gross and the service is right on par with the food. I'm pretty sure this is the only 1-star review I've given in Charlotte. So, don't think I'm some review snob :]"}
{"text":"Even with the munchies at 2am this place is bad. I've eaten here and at the one in South End and both are a waste.  I usually just eat at the Pita Pit or risk a bacteria infection and eat from one of the street vendors(the chicken on a stick is might damn good!) by The Forum."}
{"text":"The pizza here is good, but not great.  There are some things that work in the place's favor though: they deliver, they offer slices all day, they serve fresh food, and they offer wheat dough.  Considering they serve wheat dough pizza, which i absolutely love, I wish this place had better pizza.  I don't care for their pizza sauce, I think it might be really heavy on the oregano."}
{"text":"This place does not look very clean. Tho' I can't say that it's dirty I think the place is just old. The staff was friendly to me but not to each other. When I walked in the Manager greeted me BUT I WAS NOT HELPED UNTIL LIKE A MINUTE OR SO LATER!!! You would think since he was the manager that he would have helped me since the cashier was not at the register when I walked in. Yes my food was great!!!"}
{"text":"Terrible terrible terrible service. I called in to pick up a to go order and got put on hold and then hung up on. Called again to get put on hold again and hung up on again!! So since I lived down the street I decided to drive up there. I wanted to order some wings and the guy proceeds to tell me they're not frying anything else that night ( this was an hour before they closed ) so I said ok.... And proceeded to order a regular sized pizza pie. A girl walked up and said they're not doing any more pies for the night. So I then asked.... \"What do you guys do then?\" ... They said I could get a slice from one of the pies already prepared. (They looked like they had been sitting for a couple hours now) I walked out the door and left. I've never received service that was worse than this. I use to work at the fuel pizza in Davidson and I know how the store works. This would have never happened at the location I worked at. I don't know any other restaurant that denies business an hour before close. I am a regular at this location and there have been many times I've received bad service here, but this time, I will never be returning to this location again, and will be saying something to Jeremy (owner) about these employees!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick 2-slices of pizza - always ready and then they heat it up in their ovens.  This is a cool spot to fill up a belly that is full of beer.  It is kind of like NY style pizza and the sauce is really good."}
{"text":"Me and some friends went here after a few rounds of drinking and the pizza was awesome. I have been in Charlotte for 20 years and have never been to a fuel pizza before!   The crust was the perfect thickness, a little thinner than most with a touch of crispiness. The sauce was awesome - loved the herbs in it, the cheese was nicely melted and the pepperoni and mushrooms were plentiful. I ate four slices of the large pizza - I topped it with alot of red pepper flakes and grated parmesan. I meant to take a picture, but the pizza did not last long.   We sat outside too b/c the weather was so nice. Great location, except for the homeless people asking for cash for bus fare.   I AM going back....often!"}
{"text":"Alright, this is the second time I've spent my well earned cash at fuel and the second time I've been seriously disappointed. Service was terrible, again. The guy was smart and rude. I felt very uncomfortable through the whole process. Then after I waited fifty minutes for my pizza I was presented with a pizza with half mushrooms and half plain when I paid for a whole mushroom pizza......  So unhappy. Never again."}
{"text":"Nothing beats biting into a wing to find it still pink/raw in the middle. Disgusting place."}
{"text":"I ordered wings for delivery. Nothing beats biting in to a wing and finding pink/raw meat. Disgusting."}
{"text":"The pizza is ok. Every time we go here, my boyfriend always seems to get an upset stomach, which is weird because he loves pizza. I don't like Fuel in general, because I never seem to have a good dining experience. I have been to the one uptown on College, the South Blvd. location and Central. My last visit in Plaza Midwood was on New Year's Day and it was my final straw. Maybe the employees were just as hung over as we were, but they acted like we were bothering them when we came in. Like I said before, maybe it was the day itself, but it was the nail in the coffin for me."}
{"text":"This is my favorite location in Charlotte! First off, talk about GOOD PIZZA!! Even the crust is good..and it doesn't need garlic flavors or butter to be so good, it's good on it's own! I love the people who work here, they are friendly and had my best friend and I laughing the whole time! I love the theme to this place and did I mention the pizza! I never heard of Fuel until I came to charlotte but This is probably my Second favorite pizza place and this particular location with the friendly staff makes it an even better experience!"}
{"text":"Called to order a pizza and the guy tells me they don't deliver to my apartment anymore for some reason that was not given to me. Not cool!!!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for authentic pizza, this is not the place. FUEL offers a variety of Strombolis, Calzones, and Pizza, but leaves much to be impressed. Everything's pretty costly (two Strombolis for $15?), so be sure to be ready to spend that money. If you're in need of drunk pizza at 2am once the bars closed, you're in luck. The food is warm and they offer a lot of options. However, if you're looking for authentic NYC pizza, stay away."}
{"text":"Not that great for sure.. Ordered sausage peppers and onion sandwich. Mistake!! Burnt minimal inkers and no dipping sauce. Over priced for what it is. Good thing I don't live here in Charlotte"}
{"text":"The food was slow coming out to add to that its wasn't very well prepared and on top of it all the wait staff was very rude and seemed as if they didn't know how to handle there selfs professionally."}
{"text":"This place is a great stop before a Panther's game. It's with in walking distance of the stadium and the food is decent. The pizza is served mostly by the slice. The prices are what you'd expect for a restaurant right in the heart of downtown. I enjoyed the garlic knots and pepperoni pizza but wish I had tried the spinach and ricotta. The place is very clean inside and has the feel of a on the fence upscale pizza place."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza at a great price. Had pepperoni on mine and the balance of ingredients was perfect. Crust was thin and crispy. The sauce was really tasty which is why I decided to write a review. I don't often notice that the sauce on a pizza is highly flavored so it stood out. Fast friendly counter service is a plus. Decor is automotive and would appeal to kids and adults as well."}
{"text":"After the Jay-Z concert looking for food and a place to sit, we found Fuel! Fuel looked like they were shocked to see so many people coming to eat! We beat the crowd and ordered two slices and wings! It was thin crust and the wings were hot! For a late night meal it was ok!"}
{"text":"Meh is definitely the word.  I ordered online for delivery service this past weekend.  Apparently, their website menu is not coordinated with what is actually served at the restaurants.  For example, I ordered a combo meal (1 specialty slice, garlic knot, and a soda) and they called to tell me they didn't have the specialty slice I selected (even though it was listed as the one made each Sunday).  The delivery driver then told me that they don't deliver pizza by the slice usually, and that they still haven't adjusted the online menu.    Garlic knot was hard and stale.  Pizza was luke warm and nothing special.  They forgot my soda and didn't give any napkins or plastic forks even though I got a side salad.  Unless I got a little buzz goin' on at 1AM on a Friday night, Fuel won't be getting a call again from this chick!"}
{"text":"The gluten free pizza is great.  The poor quality service is annoying.  Every time I visit, something goes wrong... and I do not have these problems in most restaurants.  Once, my boyfriend and I order our food and his came out while mine took another 30 minutes. They offered to give me 50% off of my next order and wrote my name on a list.  When I called to use the discount, they couldn't find the sheet but said they'd honor it anyway.  Another time,  I ordered a pizza to go and when I went to pick it up, watched as the manager and his employees huddled in a corner chatting about something on one of their phones while my pie fell off of the belt.  They offered me free bread, though I don't eat gluten and was in a hurry and didn't want to wait for another pizza to be made.  Great food... but not worth the hassle."}
{"text":"The pizza is okay, the buffalo wings are definitely better than the pizza in my opinion. The wait is just WAY to long for okay food. I've tried to eat here multiple times and the wait is long whether there is a line nearly out the door or no one in there."}
{"text":"I don't know what to think about Fuel Pizza. It's not bad (it's by far better than most chain pizza), but I can't get very excited about it, either. I've lived in Charlotte for seven years now, and not once have I ever CRAVED Fuel pizza. Fuel is popular with the B2B crowd, so if you hear about a bar giving away free pizza for a promotion, it's probably Fuel pizza. And when I find out that it is, I just shrug my shoulders and think \"eh, that's OK, I guess\". Know what I mean? Also, I don't know if it's this location or the entire chain, but the pizza never seems hot enough here. You know the old \"pizza burns the roof of my mouth\" trope? You don't need to worry about it here. In fact, if you worked in the area, I daresay that if you ordered a slice to go, you'd need to throw it in the microwave when you got back to your office."}
{"text":"Shallow Hal was filmed here 17 years ago. Lit  Pizza is the goat .. jack Black is lit. G Paltrow named her kid Apple after this place. Lit"}
{"text":"Delish. This is what Charlotte boasts as its best pizza. Evidently started by a couple of New Yorkers. Let me start with an analogy, and then work backward.  Let's say some North Carolinians couldn't find any good bbq pulled pork in New York. So they start a restaurant. It wouldn't be quite as good as the stuff from home, but you'll go every once in awhile just to feel like you're home. That's what I would say Fuel is like. I'll stop lamenting about all pizza out of New York now.  The pizza here is good. The crust is foldable, the toppings are fine, and the cheese is greasy. Sauce is present but not wholly memorable. Pizza is baked and reheated in one of those rotating oven assembly-line cooking things, a la Quizno's.  Essentially this makes you the Quizno's of pizza.   Okay, I did it again. Seriously. It's good stuff. The thin crust looked awesome. Can't wait to try it next."}
{"text":"I wish I had \"listened to the star\" and believed the overall rating for this place. I was in a hurry and it wasn't busy and there were parking spots to be had. I heard the Sirens song of convenience and I paid the price. Horrible reheated pizza. How can you bake a pizza twice and still have a soggy crust? Service was speedy and friendly but the food didn't satisfy at all."}
{"text":"Always a great place to eat. Also helps that they deliver. Would recommend if you like to try pizzas."}
{"text":"I was staying at The Westin across the street. Stopped by at 7pm on a Monday night and had the place to myself. Ordered 9 wings (for about $6) with hot sauce and they were delicious.   As for pizzas, I blindly picked the Hero Pizza, which came with cheese, ham, sweet peppers and onions, but no tomato sauce. In hindsight, I should have stuck with a basic pizza. It was nice, but dry. The \"small\" size is definitely enough for 1 person.   The place has friendly staff who stopped by to see how I was doing.   Overall - would definitely go again if staying at the Westin, but would pick a more traditional pizza."}
{"text":"Save your money!  Cold, overpriced, overcooked!  New to the area and this will be the first and last order I make here."}
{"text":"Fuel's crust has a hold on my heart. When it's fresh, it's my favorite crust hands down. I love the availability of sliced Italian sausage, artichokes, feta and banana peppers. I like that the ambiance is more \"pizza joint\" than \"fussy pizza place.\"  I do wish the company would get their website updated so that it is current with ingredients and featured pies -- and moreover that its online ordering system worked. I can call and get delivery, but online it tells me I'm out of range. If I'm paying $40+ for two pizzas, the whole process and product should be darn near flawless. So hey, corporate, how about cooling it on the DC area expansion and looking back to where it all started to really polish up your diamond in the rough?"}
{"text":"Barbecue Chicken Pizza.  Need I say more?  ... I guess I will!  I really like the atmosphere of this place as well.  It's a great place to go out to lunch/dinner or chat with friends, almost like a sports bar, but just not as loud and much more spacey.  I'm usually not a huge stickler on service unless it's absolutely awful, and I haven't experienced that here; it's average to fine.  This place incites great moods all around."}
{"text":"Do NOT eat here. I ate here around 6p on a Tuesday. The guy prepping the pizza didn't have on any gloves he was throwing the pepperonis on a pizza with NO gloves. He even went in the refrigerator touching the door knob w his bare hands and came out the fridge w pizza dough and continues to cook again with NO gloves. I went in and needed a to go box and they gave me a used pizza box. The pizza delivery guy & the young girl w green hair we're completely careless to the fact that they gave me a used pizza box. Someone could get sick by the cook not wearing any gloves, touching door knobs & continuing to prepare food with his bare hands. DO NOT EAT HERE! & they don't have icing with their cinnamon knots, disappointing.."}
{"text":"I love Fuel as a post-1am drunken pizza spot.  It would get 5-stars for being such a reliable late night option.  It's in a great location, near the epicentre and is an interesting place for people watching during late night.  I've been here once during regular people hours and wasn't very impressed with the Pizza, but things always taste better when you are drunk or during late night."}
{"text":"I really hate to be writing a negative review of a place that I had full intention of going in and thoroughly enjoying.  Some of my extended family came down to the \"big\" city from Mooresville so I figured we could check out Fuel Pizza since I also had a coupon.    Since it was my first time, I was a little bit disoriented by the menu since you have to order before taking your seat.  We were able to pull our tables together and sit by the window, which was nice.  The garlic knots are also very tasty.  My problem is with the pizza.  I ordered my favorite pizza as always, a cheese pizza with garlic and onions.  The pizza looked OK, although the toppings were very minimal.  I couldn't really see the garlic, and the onions were mostly burnt and too thin to have much onion flavor.  All of these problems would've been OK, if the pizza tasted good, but I couldn't honestly taste \"anything\" when biting into it.  I could taste a little bit of the garlic, but since that wasn't freshly chopped it was not a pleasant taste.  The crust was OK, but also not that special, and there wasn't really enough sauce to taste it at all.  I'm from the Northeast so I definitely like my thin crust pizza, but this wasn't at all what I had hoped for.  The buffalo wings were OK, but didn't have enough sauce to provide much flavor or heat.  The people were nice enough and the location in Plaza-Midwood is very cool as well so I didn't leave feeling upset or anything, but I'm not in a big rush to go back either."}
{"text":"If you're in Davidson you should def stop by here and get an amazing pizza!! best pizza crust"}
{"text":"***  AVOID  ***  I've been a faithful Fuel Pizza customer for years. But the product and service have consistently went downhill over time to the point that I would advise that you avoid this restaurant.   Tonight, we drove 35 minutes from SC just to eat here. The service was below standard. The cashier took 3-4 minutes and two trips to speak with someone else just to determine how to enter our order. Then we went to get out drinks and the ice machine was out of ice. We told the staff and another 3-4 minutes later someone came out from the kitchen to start adding ice. S-L-O-W.   When our food arrived, my slices tasted like reheated pizza from much earlier in the day. One slice the crust was so hard that there was no way that I would eat it. My wife's calzone was burnt on the bottom.   Not a good experience. We won't return. Much better options a lot closer to home. Fuel, you just lost one of your last supporters."}
{"text":"I used to love this place but don't know what has been happening lately. Just tonight I ordered a pizza and the estimated time was 80 min and it only took 2 hours and 10 minutes. On top of that, I had to put it in the oven when I got it. That blows my mind on how my pizza was able to cool when I live like 1.2 miles from the restaurant. Sad"}
{"text":"The Fuel Pizza on Central Avenue and South Blvd are the two that I used to frequent all of the time back in the day...I have never had any bad experiences with customer service or the quality of food...the theme of the local franchise is that of an old tyme gas station.  You can get whole pizza pies or single slices...dine in or carry out...when I'm in the area I always have to grab a slice!"}
{"text":"Horrible service never go again!  give it a zero worst place ever! Have no idea why it keeps saying I need to type more so I am writing this"}
{"text":"Kind of disappointed with this place. I ordered a large pizza for delivery on a Saturday around 7:00. The driver was very confused and said his GPS wasn't working and then when I finally guided him to my house and paid, I realized he gave me a medium while I order and paid for a large. After spending so much time trying to get the pizza, I wasn't going to wait another hour to send it back and have another delivered. The pizza was very good though and I wanted to be a regular customer but I feel a little cheated."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Incompetent front service people. Asked for a fork and they just pointed across the restaurant. We were the only people in the whole place. Food is mediocre at best. Rotten lettuce in my salad. Sauce is too sweet. Good location but crappy little place"}
{"text":"Took 25 minutes for them to reheat cold pizza and get it to my friend even though ours took five minutes. We were all finished with our meal by the time they brought him his pizza, only because the security guard overhead us wondering where his pizza was. When we asked what they could do to help us they said nothing. Seeing as we were good customers and the only ones who even tipped we felt rather let down! We will not be coming back to this location. Please be careful their AC leaks right at the register."}
{"text":"Pizza and wings? YES PLEASE!!!! Delicious food a bit pricey but def worth it for lunch and dinner ! :-)"}
{"text":"I came in around 4 on a Wednesday. There were a couple people sitting inside, but not too many. I went to look at the menu (I was not starved but I just wanted something little to hold me over till dinner (6:30 ish). I go up to order and I noticed they only had three different pizzas to choose from! A veggie, bbq chicken, and \"extreme\" (which seemed to have sausage and ham. I'm a plain pepperoni pizza kind of gal, and a little upset at this point. When suddenly the gentleman behind the counter said they also have a couple slices of pepperoni in the oven. Hallelujah! I ordered a slice and 2 knots with a drink. I love cheerwine, and this is one of the places that actually serves it! The pizza came out pretty quickly.  The staff (that I was in contact with) was friendly and welcoming.  I did take away a star because of the slim selection at the time (but they might have been getting ready for the dinner rush?)  Overall, I did enjoy the place. It seemed to be cleaned up, no messes that I could see. I love the old, rustic, gas station look."}
{"text":"Awesome simply awesome, great flavors, good service, driver took us here, can you say cheerwine?  Woot woot, best soda ever. On the soda tap. Wow smells so good when you walk in, pizza cooking, makes you hungry. Rule is, if your pizza taste good cold, it's awesome. Bring da kids, get your cheerwine fix."}
{"text":"I've been to this Fuel location twice in the past few weeks, and I was disturbed by how rude the service was on both occasions. One guy in particular stood as as especially unpleasant.  I'm sorry, but even if you do have customers standing in an awkward spot, scowling at them and informing them that they are \"in the way\" is not the proper manner of handling it. I'm sure the location gets a lot of drunk assholes late at night, but when it's 6 o'clock in the evening and you're dealing with a paying, adult customer, you need to at least fake basic social graces.  Other than that, it's Fuel: decent-to-mediocre pizza depending on your luck. Sometimes the pizza takes WAY longer than you'd expect. Just don't ask about it, since it seems to make the employees crankier."}
{"text":"Hot mess, but it works! Always end up eating at Fuel at least once every Heroescon. Pros are it's really close to the convention center. Cons: Could be slow? Could be fast? Could get your order entirely wrong. Forget your order. Any number of things.  You'd think they would have gotten the chaos of a convention weekend down to a science, but they seem like they like to wing it. That aside I feel for the wait staff out on the front line. They seemed like they were trying their hardest.  Food isn't bad. It's not great, but it's easy pizza. Can't really complain there. Not really sure how they function on a normal day, but it's crazy during an event weekend. Probably will eat here again another Heroescon in the future."}
{"text":"Fuel is a staple in the PM hood and really a great place for a quick bite before heading home after a night out. I ever had but it's good open late and the staff is great ...... I want to say that the consistency is awesome and late night crew is particularly great. One person I want to acknowledge is Paris ...... even keeled, always working and when closing one night he was leading the charge in getting the place ready for the next day. Not just oh I gotta clean up but taking the lead engaging the late customers and making sure everything was good for the business and the patrons. People complain about employees but never give compliments so I wanted to shout him out specifically .. I don't know if he's the night manager  ( if not he should be ) he treats customers with respect and exemplifies customer service. ( I've been there with my friends , my gentlemanly hooligans, musicians, artists and all treated royally ) Thank you Fuel for being a good late night pizza spot and your staff with a special kudos to Paris."}
{"text":"Boooooo! Fuel Pizza is awesome. This location is by far the worst. Sub par in service, taste, and coolness.   Grab a pita next door and don't waste your time."}
{"text":"I was honestly just shocked to find Gluten Free pizza`so close to home!  While I can't vouch for the reguar pizza, I would recommend the GF pizza without a doubt.  The only downside is that it takes a much longer time to prepare, but I don't think that's the fault of Fuel.  The people are always friendly and more than happy to keep us entertained while we wait for our pizza!"}
{"text":"Coming from Chicago, I'm a pretty big pizza snob. I just haven't found much good pizza in Charlotte. I'd say Wolfman's is the best, and Fuel is among the worst. It's just not very good. I think I'd enjoy a frozen Digorno pizza much better. I really wanted to like Fuel. Their locations in old rehabbed gas stations are really cute, and there are locations all over, including one that is about a block from my house. But I've just been disappointed whenever I tried it."}
{"text":"Fuel Pizza serves GLUTEN FREE PIZZAS for an extra $2.  I am new to the Gluten Free diet and being able to eat pizza again has been wonderful.  I really enjoy the GF Pizzas with fresh and plentiful veggie toppings.  The GF crust tastes just like a normal thin crust pizza.  My husband said his pizza was just OK.  Unfortunately, the overall price per pizza is a bit higher than I would like to pay."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch uptown and had a cheese and barbecue chicken pizza. Both pizzas were real good and the service was good too. The wait was average and they served you at your table when your pizza is ready. Since its called Fuel Pizza, the entire place is designed like a gas station. Pretty cool and different."}
{"text":"My husband, 4 month old son and I were crossing the street at Plaza and Thomas this evening.  We waited until the crossing light turned to walk.  We were nearly hit by a grey subaru Station wagon with a Fuel Pizza sign on top of the car.  He then sped off.  Instead of giving bad reviews (like this) to Fuel Pizza, where we eat regularly, I called to let them know.  The employee was nice enough, told me to hold on while he got a manager.  While waiting for the manager, I heard her say, \"Tell them to call the f-ing police, I don't have time for this. \"  Then I was placed on hold before being hung-up on.  I tried to call back and was immediately put on hold and then hung-up on.  I'm so very disappointed.  I thought the employee who nearly hit us was not a reflection on the entire store, but it seems I was wrong."}
{"text":"If I could give zero, I would.. i have had food poisoning all day from eating there around 7pm last night..  wings are pre cooked and left in a tub and who knows how long theyve been in there.. thx.. oh and one worker was fighting with her bf on the phone and literally screaming and cussing and not one other worker or mgr said a thing!! Never eat at a fuel again"}
{"text":"Aaaaaa-hole employees give the worst service you'll ever have. Unless you're blackout go elsewhere. They wouldn't give me a water for a dollar. $1.08. Ate the pizza dry as shit. Never again. Pizza was good though."}
{"text":"YUK!!!!  This place isn't worthy of 1 star but there wasn't a lower rating option.  The fact that the favorable reviews are mainly from the crowd who stumble in to this place drunk after a night on the town says all you need to know."}
{"text":"I like this location as it is right on the green and larger than the other uptown location. The pizza is hit-or-miss; depending on the time you go. For the freshest slices you need to go during the lunch hour on a weekday. Anytime I visit on the weekend the pizza looks like it has been sitting out too long and tastes a bit stale.   The BBQ chicken pizza is a good one. I just wish they would take more of a focus on fresh pizza rather than prebaking them then reheating. You can only get it right out of the oven during their busiest hours."}
{"text":"Ok so we went in (my husband and I) with such anticipation...hungry and ready to devour some good ol' Fuel Pizza! Boy were we disappointed...  We usually go to the S.Blvd (South End) location and are NEVER disappointed, but since the Central Ave. location was closer, we went there instead, WRONG! WON'T DO THAT AGAIN!   The pizza was TOO hot! Most restaurant chains have to follow recipes from the company.  Whoever made this pizza obviously did not follow it!   It sucks that they are closer but aren't following protocol...not cool...  We order the same pizza everytime we go, the Buffalo pizza. The flavor, the taste, everything is consistent.   Well this Fuel Pizza is not consistent with the name and recipes of Fuel. Disappointment...the cookies were delicious!"}
{"text":"You come to fuel pizza for:  - LOCATION - prime downtown location for post event glory - ambiance - has this cool slightly retro feel to it - Dependably decent pizza (I have no illusions this isn't New York)... BUT... for 3.50 a slice for cheese - I would expect NYC quality pizza...   Staff was friendly and helpful, but then again, it wasn't busy when I visited."}
{"text":"I had heard great things about Fuel the past several months from new party friends in Charlotte so I decided to finally check it. But I really just didn't see what they were talking about. Maybe I wasn't drunk enough?   In all seriousness, I really thought it was pretty standard. I'd go back because of the convenient location to the many places I frequent on a weekend night. There's also plenty of room, and we had no problem getting our food promptly.   However, the food was pretty \"meh.\" We got a few slices of pizzas and a calzone. Temperature-wise everything was pretty lukewarm. Actually, taste-wise it was pretty lukewarm as well. I've definitely had better pizza, and I've definitely had worse.   In other words, I wouldn't go out of my way for this."}
{"text":"I've had about 7-8 visits to this location over the past year or so, so I figure it's a large enough sample size to go ahead and write a review for this place.   I gave it 4 stars because I think I've had more good experiences than bad, but the only thing holding it back is it's authenticity. You don't really get that true Italian or NY feel, it's more just some college kids flipping some pizzas...and believe me, I'm sure pizzas aren't the only thing getting baked around there, if you know what I mean.    Given my history and experience with this place, I can go ahead and give you a solid order: 2 slices of pepperoni & 3 garlic knots; usually to-go. I suppose to-go, because there isn't really a ton of atmosphere at this particular location.  There are a few flat screen TV's typically set to SportsCenter, and a few dated arcade games at the front. There may even be a Cruisin' USA, I can't remember. I think if they put a few beers on tap and served food from the bar, it might attract more dine-in customers...but for now, it's mostly just either order to-go, or get in & get out.   Also, what's with the large banner that self proclaims \"The Best Wings in Charlotte'? I've had 'em a few times, and they are a solid 7 out of 10. A claim like that is gonna need some references, citations, etc. However, I'll tell you what, they are probably one of the better wing-delivery options in the area....and they've definitely hit the spot during the early AM hours (delivery until 3am on the weekends).     Although, when it's all said and done, their slice is nice, and it's a good spot to grab some grub before or after hitting the SouthEnd scene. Check 'em out."}
{"text":"Order Friday night around 6:30 for delivery to NoDa area. We got our pizza by 7 o'clock. Ordered online, very easy, but I believe its only available at this location.  Delivery guy was super cool, very friendly, asked me about my hockey front license plate, which is a rarity for anyone to even notice here in the south. Sorry its not a Nascar plate.    This is where the great starts, we ordered a 19\" Super, with just cheese. Let me preface this by saying I am from the New Haven, CT area, which claims to be the first and best pizza in the nation.  Having been here in Charlotte for 5+ years now, I have given up hope of a \"hometown Pie\"  This was by far the closest thing to being home. I have had Fuel pizza by the slice before, but this was my first whole pie. Wow is there a difference. By the slice who knows long its been sitting, or under heat lamps.  It had fresh herbs in the sauce, perfect sauce amount, great cheese, and perfect chewy yet crisp crust.  Can't wait to order again!"}
{"text":"This was a solid food option on our way from the hotel to the Belk Bowl.  The cafe was situated in a nice looking part of town, adjacent to a garden and had high ceilings and beautiful big glass windows.  Pizza was good, but certainly not spectacular.  I guess it all depends on what kind of pizza you like.  I tried both the Veggie and the Hawaiian.  For better or worse, the sauce was not memorable.  The pizza crust was thin, slightly crisp and of a good quality.  Cheese was not too greasy or overpowering.  Toppings seemed pretty fresh.  I really liked that it was a pizza place where you can get a beer as well.  Though the selection left a bit to be desired.  Either way, I was sated, the food was a decent quality and Fuel completed the job of a much needed feeding."}
{"text":"This is one of those grimy-type/after the drinking/partying/ it's late & I'll eat anything b/c I'm that hungry, spots... The pizza is straight nuked. Seems like bums/misfits hang out here (well late nites anyway ;-)  ... it seemed fairly clean. I honestly couldn't tell if the grungy look was intentional or neglect. The atmosphere has an 80s diner Grease-feel... The layout permits you to see the people working in the kitchen from the dining area and I was just amazed at all the people that were on staff seemingly so busy making WHAT?! My pizza certainly wasn't fresh!  But hey go for it if the stale pizza flavor is your thing :-)"}
{"text":"The lines get pretty long at lunch time, but otherwise, I've had great experiences here. Even when the lines are out of hand, the staff is used to it, so it moves along fairly well.   The pizza is always good, particularly the whole wheat slice with veggies, and I also enjoy the cookies, which they'll warm up for you in the pizza oven. The brownies are huge and chewy and gooey as well, and the garlic knots are nice. I actually like everything they serve on the side at Fuel kind of better than the pizza itself...but the pizza isn't bad."}
{"text":"This location of Fuel is in one of my favorite parts of town, and I love the building it's in. The pizza isn't the greatest I've ever had, but it's not bad, either. I'm a fan of the veggie slice, which is on a really good whole wheat crust. Fuel also has excellent cookies, and they'll warm them up for you in the pizza oven.   The Central Ave location has the usual tattooed, hip crowd. The staff are all casual and friendly, and I like the kids' art on the walls. The outdoor area is in a fantastic part of town for people-watching, so I usually opt to sit outside. While the Trade St. location is nice for lunch breaks, the Central Avenue spot isn't too far away from the center of town, and it boasts its own parking lot, which is often the tipping point for me.   You can't go wrong with Fuel, in my opinion. What they lack in pizza perfection, they make up for in warm cookies, cool staff, and parking convenience."}
{"text":"Highly impressed with the quickness and quality of this little place!  Having an event at the convention center this little pizza joint is on point with location! We got in and out in under 20 minutes.  The chicken sausage pizza was delicious, just the right amount of toppings. Try the garlic knots! They're only 1.99 for 3 :)  Also, go with the combos- we got a slice a specialty pizza with a side salad and a drink for under $10!!"}
{"text":"I've been to this Fuel Pizza before and would have given it an extra star, but this time around, have to give it a 2.  Reason being, my slice of pepporoni was floating in grease.  Now on the other hand my slice of just cheese was fine, so I guess if you don't add any kind of meat on the pizza, you'll probably be alright.  But, you can't judge a pizza parlor by just it's pizza, can you? The garlic knots were warm and fresh, with just enough garlic, served with a wonderful, tomatoey, garlic, oregano and basil laced dipping sauce.  It was so good, I dipped my puffy pizza crust end in it just to have something to sop it up with. My friend ordered a side salad with her slice and the caesar dressing.  I took a swipe off of her dressing lid, and mmmmm, it was very good...didn't know if it was homemade, or a really great bottled dressing you pay an arm and a leg for at Harris Teeter. Since this particular Fuel is housed in was once a filling station, there's lots of old auto memorabilia as well as .....well...memorabilia of all sorts.  There's also lots of customer decorated paper plates on the wall and some of them are really creative and artistic.....must be lots of NODA customers going there! And, the prices are good and the staff were very nice and quick!  It may have been an off day for them, and I expected better, but if I were that way again, I would probably order a pie to go, sans the pepperoni.  Anyone know how much grease a green pepper would put out?"}
{"text":"If i could give you zero stars i would... This place is dirty.  No one greets you.  Stood for almost 10 mins to place my order and nothing.  It was more important for the bimbo behind the counter to flirt with the guy instead of doing her job.  I dont see how you can stay in biz in a downtown area with people employed like this.  Believe this or not.  Im not a hard guy to please.  Fuel sucks!!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, cool location in heart of Davidson. Great atmosphere! Not fancy, but that's just what I want in a pizza place"}
{"text":"Not just for pizza. The cheese fries, wings, and garlic knots are REALLY good, too... I mean really good. Cap it off with a cold brewski and I foresee this place becoming one of my summertime staples."}
{"text":"I'm thinking we just came at a bad time. End of night, an hour from closing, 8ish pm. There weren't many pizzas to choose from by the slice and they all looked like they had been sitting out for a bit. I tried the Spinach, tomato and ricotta pizza as well as the veggie pizza. They tasted like they would be really good hot and fresh out of the oven. But they were just reheated slices of pizza. Meh. The cashier also did a little lying when my friend asked if they had any sweet tea. They had run out and still told us they had some. LIES.  Plenty of flatscreens, huge space, fun decor. But, disappointing pizza. At least we got to park for free."}
{"text":"Service Service Service from the first step in the door not a fancy place but pizza with a good taste and a good crust! Wings Had that crunchy skin YUMM . This place has a great team of folks that's what makes this place as good as it is. So its on a paper plate if you dine in... Do not judge a pizza by its plate!             They deliver they even have a take and bake ! They could be a common pizza joint but they are NOT! Do not take my word for it try it!!!!"}
{"text":"Pizza was okay, what wasn't okay, was them inflating the tip by $5.  I thought 15% was more than adequate for handing us glasses for drinks and dropping the pizza off at the table. I called back twice to have it fixed. Each time they weren't surprised at all and took the information and never called or fixed anything.  They got me in trouble with my Work since it was a business dinner and now the charges don't match the receipt. Obviously I wouldn't go back. If you do go there, take cash and don't charge anything."}
{"text":"- Lunchtime visit to the original Fuel Pizza. - Interesting old gas station conversion. Translation: this is a neat joint.  - I was NOT IMPRESSED with the rewarmed MEH slices.  - Painfully slow service made me doubt my decision to come here.  - Some people state that this location has the BEST pizza that they've ever eaten, so I can infer from this that - at the very least, their pizza is hit or miss.  - I have no intention of ever going back."}
{"text":"Fuel is a great spot to grab a quick bit.  They have a yummy thin crust pizza and lots of the usual choices.  Their garlic knots are tasty too.  You won't wait too long or spend too much here but will walk away satisfied."}
{"text":"Came here and ordered a pizza, waited 45 minutes for them to tell us that they \"ran out of marinara sauce\" however they had pizzas boxed on top of the oven that they were giving to random people but would not check to see if it was our order. Then when we tried to get our money back, they handed us a pizza with 2 slices, instead of the large pizza we actually ordered. We had our receipt and STILL never got our money back nor a pizza. We paid $20, tipped well, and never got a pizza or our money back. Then they kicked us out of the restaurant and were rude. The employees also gave us fake names. I enjoy fuel pizza, but I recommend going to any location in Charlotte other than this one. They also told us \"they stopped serving water at 10 pm\" and also yelled at us for not ordering alcohol. I'm not one to write bad reviews but this was a terrible experience"}
{"text":"Over priced pizza 12.00 for 3 slices that's been sitting out all day and quality is the worst. Im going to papa johns."}
{"text":"Good, tasty pizza. Great for an everyday meal or a last minute meal solution. We get the Riviera pizza with added pepperoni just about every time. Delicious artichoke, olives, and feta cheese. Their spinach/ricotta/tomato pizza is also very good, and their calzones (with pepperoni added) are nearly perfect. I grab a slice or pie there frequently, and have never had problem with an order."}
{"text":"Let's look at the plus column first:  Great location near Seventh Street Market  Really cool retro décor with a boldness and \"filling station\" feel to it  Decent pizza that can be ordered by the slice   Now the minus:  Took a while for someone to notice me standing at the register  $7.50 for two slices was a bit steep  The pizza looked pretty dried out before it was put in the oven  Quite honestly, if Pure Pizza had been open, I would have gone there instead."}
{"text":"I wish i could give negitive stars. I have never had such a bad experience at the Southend location.Raw chicken, 1 wrong pizza and a two hour wait for a calzone that was also wrong! I have never had such a poor experience in my life. I will never visit any fuel pizza location again. First impression is the lasting one. And yes I tore up a $30 voucher and gave it back to them in pieces. I will be sure to let my fellow transplants know to not patronize this business due to the egregious incompetence shown tonight!"}
{"text":"This location is BEYOND terrible. The pizza is mediocre, but the service is terrible. There are two customers in the place at lunch at the server forgot to put my order, and the previous customers order in so we both waited for 15 mins. Its just poorly run. Once slice runs you about $4 too. Skip!"}
{"text":"Meh."}
{"text":"Nice pizza in a cool little building.  Pretty quick for pick up or delivery!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. The staff acts like its a pain that a customer has shown up. Never friendly or helpful. I swear its a staring contest at the counter.  I would only go with a group to cause  them a bigger headache with more people.  And to make it even better the cook was munching on my fries while she was waiting for my order to complete.  Much better food and service in the area."}
{"text":"Only reason I am giving 2 stars is because the delivery driver was super nice and I gave him a good tip prior to receiving my order. I placed an  order at 2:00 on a Saturday. They were fairly quick, but the pizza looked and tasted like it was maybe a week old. have heard great things about this chain, but I was not at all impressed. Maybe dining in would have been better. I am new to the area and probably will not return due to my experience."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my veggie slice here, it was decked with tomatoes, onions, and bell peppers.  Although it could have been a little hotter, and I also like a more sauce on my pizza.  I haven't been to the Park Rd. location but just by the reviews on this webpage alone, I think that the Central Ave. location has it beat by a long shot.  The employees are all pretty cool; one even commented on my MSTRKRFT flyer and said that he was attending the show as well.  I love places that don't require their staff to shave and allow tattoos, it helps keep them fresh and independent.  I thought that the establishment could have been a little cleaner, but it seems like grunge is the theme for a lot of the businesses on this block."}
{"text":"Fuel Pizza is a hot spot for spilling out of uptown clubs and bars and when in need of some good greasy pizza.  It's normally pretty crowded and in my opinion, the food isn't spectacular but there just isn't much else to choose from at that late hour.  It's a pizza by the slice kind of delivery and the choices are pretty decent so no complaints there.  I like it....just don't love it.  As always if you go late enough, there is some really good people watching."}
{"text":"The pizza here is good  the Brooklyn is one of my favorites, the location, the place, it's something to come and enjoy with friends"}
{"text":"The staff here is beyond wonderful. Friendly and fast service. Pizza, calzones, garlic knots and salads are all really good. I love the fuel interiors and the location is wonderful!"}
{"text":"7+ ppl working and about 8 patrons. Service was horrible. Pizza dough was too thick. Looked for utensils to cut pizza but only plastic available. Staff obv doesn't care. Looked for Parmesan cheese on the tables and had to walk around entire restaurant to find some.  Surprised this place is still in business."}
{"text":"This place is great if you're looking for a drunken mediocre pizza slice. DO NOT ORDER THE WINGS. Apparently ordering buffalo medium wings does not mean you ordered wings with sauce on them. Despite the request you will get sad, bland, barren wings."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Charlotte. Period.   I would punch a kitten in the face for a slice of their BBQ chicken pizza right now. Alas, I'm 3000 miles away.   Seriously this place is awesome. Great old building in a great older area. There are other locations in Charlotte too but this was my favorite."}
{"text":"Me and best friend always eat here when she is in town she hip me to this place I enjoy the pizza and wings I really have no complaints"}
{"text":"Some of the absolute WORST SERVICE I have ever ever experienced in my life. Sure, the pizza's delicious and if you're in the mood for it, its the place to go, but you can literally wait an hour before your food arrives. This isn't fast food, if you ask me."}
{"text":"Run the other way! Terrible! Called ahead and ordered a pizza and salad for pick up. Arrived 15 mins later, pizza was ready, but not the salad. Waited an additional 15 mins and still no salad. Did they have to grow the lettuce? Was told my salad was being made, yet having a clear view of the kitchen, I could see no one was making anything. Sorry, they made boxes. Order not fulfilled and the kitchen staff is folding freaking boxes. Asked for my money back for the salad and still no refund posted. Should have listened when the hotel employee refer to this dump as \"drunk pizza\". Crap pizza and service is non existent."}
{"text":"Literally watched as my pizza came out from running through the oven and it sat on a table for a solid 5 min before they ran it out. They brought out the wrong thing for my friend. Pizza was mediocre garlic knots were good."}
{"text":"When we heard about Fuel Pizza Cafe we took the drive to Central Ave to give it a try.   It could have been because it was a weekend but we were a little disappointed.  However, we did find out that the owner was yet another Central New Yorker moving south.    However, the Fuel Pizza on Trade Street has been a god send for lunch time dining choices."}
{"text":"This was the first good pizza place to open in Uptown.  It was a welcome addition to the noon time choices.  I am giving it four stars for that reason alone."}
{"text":"Creative pizza options, but I found the service to be a bit on the slow side. I popped in for a take out. While I watched the kitchen from my table, I saw my slices come out of the oven and go into the box. Where they sat for a solid five minutes (I wanted to see how long it would take) before the right person noticed and brought them over to me.  Hawaiian had a good portion of pineapple and ham. Veggie on whole wheat was loaded with peppers and mushrooms and more. They warmed up fine when I got them home. Very yummy."}
{"text":"I really don't like to complain because I work in the service industry too, but I stopped ordering food from you guys 2 years ago because every single time we ordered delivery it was always wrong. Literally every single time except for once when someone I knew took my order. I decided to give you guys a second chance this week, and the only reason I'm giving you 2 stars is because your staff is always extremely friendly. However, I ordered a calzone with pepperoni, mushrooms, onions and banana peppers in it this week. I only mention the ingredients because with 4 it should have been a fairly decent sized calzone. I ordered for carry-out, so I didn't look inside the box until I got to my destination. I wish I had looked at it before I left, but I asked the guy who was working if my garlic knots were included in the box and he said that he had checked to make sure everything was right.   When I opened the box I seriously could not believe what I had been given. This was the saddest calzone I have ever seen in my life. In no restaurant that I have ever worked in would this have been allowed to leave the kitchen. As thin as a slice of pizza (which I probably should have ordered instead), I'm not even sure how to describe the way it was overcooked while still undercooked. And I paid $13 for this thing.  I really love supporting local businesses but you guys have got to fix this sort of stuff. I'm not the type of person to call in demanding a refund or wanting something for free, I understand food costs and loss and would never want to get someone fired because I understand everybody has a bad day here and there, but please, get it together. Don't send people off with less than par food. In fact send them off with amazing product so you don't lose business to the other pizza joints popping up in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"They were out pepperoni pizza by the slice so I had to get a more expensive one. The salad I get had rotten slimy lettuce so I had to take it back for another one. The second one also had rotten lettuce...third times the charm. And the cherry in top, the Sierra mist taste like fizz water. This meal cost me almost $10. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Too many amazing places to eat in Davidson to waste your time here. The food wasn't good and neither was the service. Look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Fuel Pizza is just OK.  I've ordered it quite a few times, and it is probably one of the better places to get pizza here.  I grew up in the Midwest, where you could get Chicago style pizza a lot of places.  I had a lot of great pizza there and in Chicago, which has made me very, very picky about good pizza.    As far as I can tell, the only crust you can get here is hand-tossed.  The crust itself is pretty decent.  It holds up pretty well to the toppings, and it has the right level of chewiness that a hand-tossed pizza should have, although the flavor is a little blah.  The sauce isn't too sweet, which I like, but it doesn't have enough flavor to set it apartment from other pizza sauces.  The 'Veggie on Wheat' and 'The Whole Engine' are the best pizzas they have.    A lot of people seem to like their wings, but I thought they were disappointing.  I've tried both their actual wings and their boneless (which is basically chicken strips covered in sauce).  They don't do any cooking of the wings with the sauce; they just pour the sauce over them afterwards.  While the sauce is good, it really doesn't impart much flavor to the chicken itself.  But I admit it - I am kind of a wing snob.  Their garlic knots are just OK as well.  They don't have enough garlic flavor for my taste.  They also have salads, subs, stromboli, and calzones on their menu, none of which I've had yet.  They also offer desserts, via cinnamon knots, Brad's cupcakes, and cookies.  I've also not tried any of those.  They do have relatively quick delivery, and their take-out time is pretty reasonable as well.  Their prices are decent as well.  So, if you're looking for fast, relatively cheap pizza, this is a good place."}
{"text":"Went in tonight.  I was clearly in line but someone thought they were ahead of me. They weren't as I remember.them walking in the door after I did.  They got upset and I simply explained I was already in line.  They didn't like that and the blonde who saw nothing chimes in after saying the girl was right when she was ringing up customers but apparently had a full view.   Gone here more times than I can account literally including the previous night, but per the attendant I've officially been a problem.    I don't expect the highest level of customer service at 2am, but to decide to say things for people you know is pretty weak. I look forward to responding to comments from people not there."}
{"text":"It's the Plaza Midwood pizza joint. It also has a Ms Pacman/Galaga arcade which I find myself playing most times I visit."}
{"text":"I like the pizza here preferably when it's just out of the oven. The atmosphere is extremely casual so grab a table (and pray it's not wobbly--lol) and enjoy yourself."}
{"text":"The pizza tastes great! We preferred the regular cheese over the Buffalo chicken. We ordered it two nights in a row and it was great both times. The website messed up delivery times and they had no problem remaking and delivering later. Great pizza and customer service!"}
{"text":"Pizza is good, better than most. We came on a coupon. You can usually find deals in the local clipper or on Groupon.   I got a side salad from the freezer case and after 2 that were wilted and not fresh. They made me one fresh. Definitely made up for it. Customer service was on point.  Garlic knots were delicious & warm!   It's in a fun spot in Davidson with outdoor seating. If your still hungry or aching for a sweet treat. Whits frozen custard is a few doors down."}
{"text":"Of all the Fuel locations in town, this is my favorite. If you're really hankering for fuel, come to this one--less crowded at busy times, as far as I can tell. I actually really like the pizza here, though it's nothing special or particularly innovative/interesting. It's just standard fare, but with pizza, that normally gets the job done, right?   My favorite is the Buffalo Chicken--it's a slice with chicken, hot sauce, and some blue cheese. Really good if you're into that sort of thing, which of course I am. Definitely not for everyone though. The person I was with got some meat special, and it was good, too---pepperoni, hamburger meat, and some other stuff.   They have beer by the bottle, which is cool, and all the sodas you'd ever want. They also have hot sauce to put on your slice as you like, which is awesome."}
{"text":"We came here last night for a quick bite before hitting the town a little, and I'm glad we did. I'm a huge pizza snob, and Fuel really holds up well. First of all, it's fast: you get your food quickly and efficiently, and it never tastes like it was just microwaved or heated up. It's always pretty fresh, which is key. The also have beer offerings, and that compliments the food really well. A lot of pizza joints don't, sadly, and that just won't cut it with me.   I got two slices: buffalo chicken and spinach-tomato-ricotta, and both were pretty great. The buffalo chicken was amazing, but feel free to add Texas Pete's hot sauce (there are plenty of bottles available) to give it some extra zing. The other slice was good, too, although a little heavy on the ricotta. Shockingly, I also got a side salad and couldn't believe it: all the veggies and lettuce were fresh and crunchy. Great value for just a few bucks. Don't fear trying one if you're not looking to get completely full throwing down an entire pie."}
{"text":"After resisting after so many bad experiences, I am finally breaking down and leaving this restaurant the horrible review they so badly deserve. Tonight is the fourth night in the past year where we ordered dinner for our family via their website and the order was not received. When I called, they said \"I know, it's a problem\". Really? take the site down then!  When you call in it's not much better. I've received orders for other houses. I've had my order not show up. Excuses every time.   Their pizza is pretty good, but I am done supporting our local restaurant as they are totally unreliable and don't do anything to resolve their issues."}
{"text":"The personal is extremely friendly in this place, you feel like those are your friends from college, and the pizza is good, and they also have great combos, I like the pizza slide with the salad size. The best of this pizza is that is NOT greasy at all, thank GOD!"}
{"text":"Second delivery second problem.  My girlfriend ordered wings and I took the order.....no wings.   When we called, she was informed that we did get the wings.  Evidently, they are invisible wings!!! Pizza was mediocre BTW"}
{"text":"I wasn't assked but...let me tell you... I did not anticipate pizza south of the Mason-Dixon line to taste anything like a northern east coast walk through the city.  I was pleasantly shocked to find myself licking sauce off the lips of another patron in the Fuel Stop that afternoon I went.    It was really that good.  It was \"lick the lips of another patron good\".  Can pizza taste any better down here? Still...don't give up on a few of the other NYC pie makers quite yet.  But I will continue to make this one of my stops everytime I am in the Queen City."}
{"text":"I've been to Fuel on Central Ave on two previous occasions and had an above average slice of pepperoni pizza each time.  Both times the staff was friendly and inviting.  My husband and I visited them tonight, a Friday evening around 7pm.  He has never been there before and I, being a pizza snob, said it was great before and for him to order any kind of pizza.  We ordered a 19\" Hawaiian pizza, add chicken and jalapenos.  To go.  The cashier, nor anyone else, ever even spoke to us tonight except to say \"for here or to go?\". We waited about 15 minutes, which was a short time to wait for hand made pizza, so that was a plus.  We were in a hurry to get home so we only glanced at the pizza before wet left.  When we arrived home and each grabbed a slice we were both very disappointed.  If we were still there we would sent the pizza back.  The pizza has an extremely minimal amount of cheese, we think.  Neither of us could find any so we are only assuming there is cheese on it.   The sauce was ON TOP of the cheese, then the toppings.  Ass backwards.  Because they put the cheese directly onto the bread, if at all, then the sauce, then the toppings the toppings were all dry, much like dog or cat food.  This was an extremely poor execution of pizza.  I REFUSE to eat Domino's or Pizza Hut or Little Caesar's, however, on this occasion, any of these would be a much better choice.  If you are looking for great pizza and friendly staff, this is NOT the place.  I'm so disappointed that we just threw a $28.00 pizza in the trash because this pizza place doesn't know how to make pizza."}
{"text":"I was so tired of going to 7th street market and looking for something close by (on a lunch time crunch). This place is right around the corner and had some markings on the outside of the building that brought me in. I figured can't go wrong with pizza place, right?    Well this place is \"gas station\" themed if you will and the food tastes like it came from s gas station so it's fitting.   I kinda wanted a salad, I'm semi trying to be healthy but all the lettuce/salads displayed were filled with iceberg lettuce. No thanks. So I decided on a slice of pizza and fries. Nothing special about the pizza. The fries taste like Arby's curly fries which is cool with me.   You serve yourself your drink and grab your own everything... ketchup, napkins blah blah blah food from the station behind the fountain drinks.   The prices here are okay. Nothing outrageous or cheap. My biggest complaint is that this place was HOT. It was like eating outside but without any breeze. If you want food fast and to be unbothered by waiters then fuel up with fuel Pizza."}
{"text":"Delicious sauce. Absolutely delicious. Definitely get garlic knots so you can get a cup of sauce on the side. Ask for extra sauce. The spinach and ricotta pizza is great - there are better pizzas but not by much. They clearly use all fresh ingredients. The owner is fantastic!! Loved him."}
{"text":"Definitely a fan... plus this is probably the most convenient Fuel Pizza location since it has a parking lot.  The last time I was here, it was kind of dead, but that's when the temp was like below 30 and everyone was probably smarter than I was running around in the cold.  Once you got into the place, it was nice and warm.  This location always has a cozy feel to it and the service is pretty good.  Fuel decor always fascinates me as far as the old sign-age and gas theme.  I like variety in my pizzas and always try to get something new... they can easily custom make you a pizza or you can choose what's out in the glass case already which is a pretty good selection most of the time."}
{"text":"This location is right off the Green and it has been a while since I've visited, but Fuel hasn't really made any drastic changes to their business model so it's a pretty steady staple in Charlotte in my book.  Great place for quelling the  late-night pizza fixes and a great way to end the night to lessen the magnitude of hangovers."}
{"text":"This place is almost in my backyard and why haven't I tried it before today?  Who knows but that's my goal lately to try and support the places in my \"hood\".  So I ventured here after a day of running errands.  This place is a hole in the wall but do people really expect a 5-star restaurant in an old gas station?  I am sure Fuel thought a gas station was the perfect location for their concept, especially since the decor is old gas cans and car parts.  Fuel Pizza isn't the best pizza around but there are some things here that stand out over other places.    First off, the staff.  Super friendly here and interested in your opinion of their food and establishment.    Secondly, unlike many pizza joints, there's no shortage of toppings here.  My slices were covered in them!  Yay!  And finally, they deliver!!!!  How many locally owned pizza places do that anymore?"}
{"text":"I was highly disappointed when I came here today. My roommate and I had been to another Fuel across town and it was phenomenal. At this particular location, we had to wait about 1-2 minutes before even being acknowledged at all-- there was no one in front of us. As if that weren't rude enough, we were greeted by a negative attitude by the person at the counter when they finally got to us. When I was asked what I wanted, I began to give my order, but was abruptly cut off as the person left the counter and began preparing my food (even though I was going to say I did not want specific things in my food.) As I attempted to pay, I was told that my card was declined, even though there was enough money on it. When they brought out my food, I realized that they forgot my cinnamon knots. Come to find out, they never even rung them up. One lady behind the counter was very kind and gave me those instead of making me have to pay (the rude woman made them without ringing them up) When I began to eat my food, I realized that it wasn't fresh tasting, or fresh feeling. I'd waited all of that time for stale-tasting food. My roommate ordered cheese fries and they had a VERY tiny amount of cheese on them. We were both thoroughly disappointed with this meal and establishment."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge pizza fan, so my review may be a little biased based on my taste. But I do enjoy an occasional pizza pie, & Fuel just isn't impress me all that much.  I've eaten at this Fuel in downtown Charlotte for late night several times & the place is always packed. They're open after the bars close, so expect some long lines full of boozed up late nighters. And unlike some other late night options in Charlotte, Fuel takes quite a while to get your order placed, & then you have to wait again to actually get your food. This whole line/wait can take from 20 min up.  Once you get to the front of line, they have a lot of pizza topping options, from your basics to some odd ones. Along with pizza slice choices, they also have garlic knots which actually may be better than the pizza. When you finally do get your food, the pizza is nothing special, especially considering your wait. To me, it's just your average, run of the mill pizza.  I'd much rather have a different late night meal than pizza, but I still don't think their pizza is worth the wait. But if you really do crave pizza after bar hopping, then head to Fuel Pizza for a lengthy wait to satisfy your pizza hunger."}
{"text":"I've tried so many times to \"like\" Fuel. It's the canned tomato paste taste I loathe. The decor gets me too, it's old vintage cans and garage chic it's just rusty and dusty and skeevey. Mostly kids working there and that's not a problem but there is always a table with left over scraps that even when not busy they don't \"bus\" it with any sort of interest in cleaning off tables."}
{"text":"THE WORST service I've had in Charlotte. The delivery order said 30 minutes...the order arrived over an hour and a half later. I called a few times to ask about it and after 11 minutes being on hold as \"the first caller in line\" they hung up on me. The driver showed up after an hour after the estimated time with a pen that wouldn't work. I attempted to sign my receipt and asked him for a working pen. His response was \"whatever....just try to scribble.\" He never gave me a receipt or apologized for how long her took. In addition to that, we ordered 30 wings with veggies, ranch and blue cheese dressing and we only received the wings and one little packet of ranch dressing. My friend has warned me several times about the service of Fuel Pizza and I definitely know now that I should have listened to him. Truly terrible."}
{"text":"The manager here is awful, he was on his cell phone the entire time.I paid for my order and when I received my food I asked him for what I had previously paid for he continued to ignore me and text on his phone. This establishment is subpar at best and please do not order and expect to receive what was paid for."}
{"text":"What feels like many life times ago I actually spent a lot of time in Plaza Midwood but had never made it to Fuel Pizza until this past weekend. I always though the renovated gas station was cute but sadly the care and attention to detail taken on the outside was not reflected on the inside. It was just a little grimy, and the drink selection was pretty low (maybe three types of alcohol and two types of soda left in the refrigerator). The person calling out the orders mumbled and was hard to hear even though there weren't many people there.   There were some good points though - fresh, hot pizza in a matter of minutes for a reasonable price. I can see the late night food appeal and while I am not rushing back I would certainly go again, especially at the end of the night."}
{"text":"Forgot to yelp Fuel!  So, same World Cup day that I'll never forget, while R and I were at Town Tavern, I got hungry. I remembered Fuel around the corner, and since Town Tavern didn't serve food, it would be a-ok to get my nosh on.  During a lull in the game, I sprinted around the corner and breathlessly ordered buffalo wings with spicy sauce. When they were done, I threw cash at the cashier and sprinted back to the bar.  I opened the box and noticed golden brown wings. Interesting. Is the spicy sauce disguised? Nope, they just forgot to put it on the chicken.  I made R run back and have them correct it. They were all good sports about it. With the sauce, the wings weren't bad at all; a good size and meaty. And the service was ace-cakes, all very nice. And there was a massive screen with the match showing, so I didn't even miss a beat of the game.   I can't remember if I've had Fuel's pizza, but the wings weren't too shabby."}
{"text":"Nice, Clean, Convenient location, Friendly staff... Good Pizza. However, if you are going to snag a whole pie, do yourself a favor and get one of the specialty pies... the $20ish for a whole Hawaiian was a bit steep for a slightly above average pie. The cal-zone was also really tasty, with a ton of ricotta type cheese inside,, definitely not for the lactose faint."}
{"text":"I'm giving Fuel Pizza on Central 5 stars for two reason.  First off they are open until 4AM on the weekends when everything else is closed.  Secondly, I was in there really late (2:30AM) last Saturday night and we ran into actor Ben Best from HBO's Eastbound and Down.  What a damn nice guy and funny as hell to.  We had a great time eating decent pizza and hanging out with him.  The pizza was pretty decent but its nothing to go crazy over.  The best thing I had there were the glazed cinnamon knots....good stuff!"}
{"text":"Don't use your credit card here! I wish I could give them zero stars but no one at Fuel cares anyway. The place is absolutely disgusting. We ordered a few months back and the guy who delivered was stumbling drunk. Ordered a few weeks later, was told we would have to use a credit card because it was after 11pm, so we did. Next morning I woke up to several calls from my bank because they caught fraudulent charges on the card I gave fuel. Apparently someone there decided to buy a few pizzas for people on our card (or just ran a scam through the register, refunding in cash, who knows...but there were three more charges for different amounts after our initial order) and then try to do some online shopping. So this place is definitely not getting any business from us now. Require us to give our CC# over the phone and hire people who commit credit card fraud? It's just sad not to be able to enjoy an old neighborhood place anymore."}
{"text":"Fuel Pizza is very convenient for us and we have ordered takeout several times. The pizza here is good and is quite thick and filling. There are several Charlotte area locations and a location in DC. The chicken pesto pizza and the \"whole engine\" pizzas are my favorite. The wings are also very good and meaty although you have to ask for blue cheese dressing if you'd rather have that than ranch. Also neat: you can order online and they offer both whole wheat and gluten free crust options - a nice touch. At our location (Southend) the atmosphere is lively and fun. I look forward to checking out the original Central Ave. location in the near future as well."}
{"text":"I was here for a conference and my stomach was threatening to eat itself so when I saw fuel and smelt the food from across the street I stopped in. I got the honey BBQ wings, side salad, beer, one garlic and one cinnamon knot. The people at the front counter were VERY short and abrupt with me. I was obviously from out of state and had no knowledge about there ordering process but they kept rushing me and were unhelpful. The wings were hard and not fun to eat. The salad dressing on their salad was good, both knots were ok. My favorite part of the meal was my ice cold beer. I was so hungry I couldn't wait to find another place for lunch- lesson learned. I have three more days for the conference and I will not come back here. Not worth the $16 I just spent-my teeth still hurt from eating the over- fried wings!"}
{"text":"Had takeout last night of cheese pizza and chicken wings.  I used to love this place and would ask to have it every time I'd visit my family here in Davidson but I think the pizza has changed a little bit."}
{"text":"Kind of average pizza and wings but not a bad place to go to watch a little basketball and eat a slice. The garlic knots look pretty solid though, will def give those a try."}
{"text":"Solid 3.5 !  I am a New Yorker so yes I am tough on pizza. Papa Johns and Dominoes just doesn't do it for me well really ever but especially not when I need my go-to rough night fixer.   I can call in my order and about forty minutes later they come to my door (which is nice since I live in a complex) and deliver the pizza. Its usually hot and delicious but thickness and crispiness varies : (  . I like thin NY style pizza so this can sometimes be a let down. I wish I knew what to expect each time. The overall taste is the same and the sauce is great.  A bit pricey with delivery but worth it !"}
{"text":"This place needs a little TLC.  Let me start by saying I am a Fuel Pizza fan. The pizza is good and I love a place where I can get garlic knots! You can order by the slice or a whole pie and most locations are open late night ( hello convenience!).  Unfortunately this location is starting to slack... The last few times I've put in an order for pick-up, the orders weren't ready for the time I was quoted so I had to sit around in the dining room watching everyone else enjoy delicious pizza while I waited for my pizza to cook. To make matters worse, usually the staff has been preoccupied chatting with each other instead of packaging the order as soon as the pizza is out of the oven.  Then I tried delivery. Ordered 6 knots and a medium cheese pizza on a Monday night. Was quoted 45 mins for delivery but the pizza didn't arrive until over an hour after it was ordered. The pizza was cold and only 3 knots made it to my door (instead of 6 as ordered). Of course the delivery guy scurried back to his getaway vehicle before we realized the pizza was cold. Darn.  I hope the management notices and they turn this place around because I'd hate to have to take my business elsewhere. I guess only time will tell...."}
{"text":"Here in CLT on business. I dig this place. Service was good, pie was good. I went to another location not too far from here a year or so ago. Seems like they had more beer selections but that's ok. I love the retro look!"}
{"text":"My first Fuel Pizza experience was here and it was great! The building, inside and out, was actually pretty awesome. I think I spent 15 minutes just looking around checking the place out. The staff was easygoing, fun-loving and friendly. The pepperoni slice was a good size and delicious. The knots were great - much softer than I thought they'd be. As a previous review said, it does get warm in here so dress in layers if it's a cold day. One server jumped up and opened the garage door on the front to air it out. No worries though, it's screened in. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"As the story goes, in 1999 (or thereabouts), three guys from New York wanted a slice of pizza and couldn't find one.  So they stopped at an old gas station on Central Avenue in the Plaza Midwood area and created a \"hand crafted\" slice, with real mozzarella, rich tomato sauce and fresh ingredients.  Some seven years later, they have opened five other locations, including this spot on South Boulevard, and are still selling pizza by the slice (you can get whole pies, but the pizza \"buy\" the slice is a major draw).  Sure, you can find a slice of pepperoni, but let's face it - why would you bother?  You can get pepperoni anywhere.  If you're at Fuel Pizza, get something different, such as the Fuel Extreme (basically a meat lover's dream) or the Barbecue Chicken pizza. Both are good and have the aforementioned fresh ingredients - but I would probably argue that they are representative of New York style pizza.  That's not to say that it's bad pizza.  It's quite decent.  but there is better pizza to be had in the city, and there is even better New York style to be found if you look for it."}
{"text":"So me and my boyfriend thought of ordering some pizza for take out. We looked up their website on the phone and decided on two options - The Whole Engine and Roasted Chicken and Peppers. We called up to order, and the girl who was taking our order over the phone seemed completely befuddled at \"Roasted Chicken and Peppers.\" She asked the other staff about it and nobody seemed to know. Then she asked me \"so on the other half you only want chicken and peppers?\" After both me and my bf trying to tell them what we wanted (we even read out the exact name from their website) no one seemed to know what we were talking about, so we just decided to drive to Fuel Pizza and order there, thinking that maybe that particular one wasn't on the menu at this location. On getting there, we found the very pizza on their menu! So how am I supposed to trust a pizza shop to make my pizza right if they don't even know what's on their menu?  Also, while we waited for our pizzas, this place was so loud (I think it was the AC vent) that I got a headache from straining to hear my boyfriend over the sound. It was apparently so loud that the cashier did not hear us when we said this would be for take out, and our pizza was brought to our table.  Back to our food, the garlic knots had a good flavor, but they weren't as great as everyone else is saying they are. I mean sure, it's garlic and I've never had garlic knots that haven't been good but I don't think they were anything to write home about. The pizza was decent. The Whole Engine was delicious, the Roasted Chicken and Peppers, not so much."}
{"text":"Pizza was ok, pretty good for late night stop.   The manager and staff, however, were not good at all.  Simply put,... hair in the food and somehow they made me the asshole in the equation.   Professional advice. Get your staff in line or your gonna sink like all others do."}
{"text":"Late Night Review*: Came here late on Friday and that's pretty much the main reason I stopped by. it's one of the few spots, if any, open for food after 11PM near uptown that's not the Midnight Diner, which looked like a club in itself with the wait line meandering outside their door..  The experience was standard, ordering a limited selection of cold pizza slices, calzones, garlic knots and cinnamon knots. With no line waiting, they quickly fired it up in the oven and we got in and out in no time.  Fortunately, the slice selection is better than just pepperoni or cheese slice, as you can order a supreme or meat lover style.  Unfortunately, for $3+ per slice, the quality and taste wasn't up to par. I've had fresher and better at smaller joints, mainly because they are busier and have to keep making pizzas. The location here lends to less walk-in traffic."}
{"text":"Bottom line:  horrible customer service (for delivery only; haven't dined in), botched order, soggy undercooked pizza, and late delivery  I ordered food from here yesterday for delivery down the street to World of Beer (where they don't serve food but have a wide selection of beer and graciously allow you to bring in food from other places).  Fuel is one of the menus they hand out to you, so I assumed there was some sort of understanding/relationship between the two establishments.  And one would think that Fuel would want to keep this arrangement going, given how many times we saw the Fuel delivery guy show up during the 4 hours we were in WOB.   When I called to place the delivery order around 1:30, the woman at Fuel copped more attitude than I think I've ever experienced from a restaurant employee.  And I order take-out and eat at restaurants a lot.  After putting me on hold to ask her manager whether they could \"do more than 4 deliveries to World of Beer\" and warning me that they would have to charge a delivery fee ($2 - big deal), she reluctantly took my order and treated me like a 12-year-old delinquent child in the process.    It would be tedious to go through the exchange I had with this employee in detail, but she was pissy enough that at one point I stopped the conversation and asked if there was any particular reason why she was acting so rude to me when I was just trying to order food.  I would have hung up then, based on principle alone, if my husband and I hadn't been so hungry.  She said that she wasn't being rude, she was just taking my order.  I was alarmed at her lack of self-awareness.  Anyway, I ordered a pizza, wings, and a salad, and she said the wait would be 30-35 minutes.  It was NFL opening day, so we expected somewhat of a delay in delivery.  Well, 1 hour and 20 minutes later, our food showed up.  The pizza was soggy and undercooked (not to mention cold, but I actually like cold pizza), the wings were skimpy and on the dry side, and they forgot our salad.  With the bad food and even worse service, I won't order from or go to this place again."}
{"text":"I am extremely disappointed in this establishment.  First of all the guy at the register, who claimed to have run a strip club previously, stated that they had no potable water...I know that is a violation. They yelled at the patrons and while I understand the challenges of the location, it was unnecessary.  I will never come back here for anything! I advise not waiting your time. There is pizza at the EpiCentre.  And...after all of that. The pizza was trash and didn't have cheese on the cheese pizza!"}
{"text":"Confession: Chicago pizza has ruined me a little bit.   That aside, Fuel is a-ok in my book. It's fast, it's cheap, it fills the 'za void. But, for some reason I don't hit up this particular Fuel very often, and it's situated squarely in South End. Go figure.   For a last night slice, easy delivery or a mammoth calzone - this Fuel is aces. Convenience is key, here. And while I have eaten inside the actual restaurant, it's not the best pizza joint I've ever hung out in. The staff is hit or miss...sometimes they are super friendly and quick, other times a bit lackadaisical.   Be aware that on weekends this place can get pretty kid-packed, so if you're not a fan of stuffing your face with kiddos running around, choose pick up or delivery, son. I know I'll be back to snag a huge, cheesy calzone that will feed me for two days...especially because this Fuel is just a mile from my house. Score one for convenience!"}
{"text":"Nice laid back atmosphere and great customer service! More importantly the pizza was delicious and cheap! The kids loved the garlic knots we will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Great for large groups! Love the garlic knots, they are delicious!! Would definitely recommend. Super convenient bc they serve by the slice as well. Ive been going to Fuel since I was a kid, and they continue to mainntain quality and taste."}
{"text":"Came here our first night in Charlotte, was right across the street from our hotel so it was super convenient. Me and my wife split a chicken parm hero and a meatball parm hero, we got some garlic knots and some wings. Everything was made to order so it was fresh and hot and really good. The wings were good and spicy but not crazy hot. we've eaten a few other places since we've been here and this place was my favorite. Would definitely go back when we com back here"}
{"text":"I can remember my first experience with Fuel. Someone brought pizza to a rehearsal that was beyond incredible. Flavorful crust that wasn't too chewy, smartly seasoned sauce, and fresh toppings. I had to figure out where it was from...and I've been stopping in for a slice (and those addictive garlic knots!) when I'm around ever since.  On my most recent visit to the Central Ave Fuel, the staff was incredibly kind and quick, especially considering it was the tail end of the dinner rush. Turns out I was mistakenly overcharged - I didn't notice. But the girl at the register found me at our table, asked if I'd like a refund or the extra piece I paid for, and threw in a cookie for the confusion! Honesty and great service!  The only thing on the menu I haven't tried yet are their take-and-bake pizzas. If they are anything like the stuff you get in the restaurant, I may be in trouble..."}
{"text":"I make shitloads of pizza and am really into the art of this food.  That said, I'm not a snob or a bitch about it.  The cheese pie was decent, but the other slices sucked.  Toppings were not fresh, and, worst of all, slices were not hot.  That is really bad in my book.  Sauce was o.k., crust was too chewy.   Service was terrible.  The 16 year old behind the counter was clueless.  Salad was packaged in fridge with bad, goopy Italian dressing.  Horrible selection of small-bottled cheap-ass wine.  Is it that hard to buy some decent house wine?"}
{"text":"Fuel Pizza (uptown) Gets 1 star for being in uptown Charlotte' and another star for good customer service. Too bad the pizza is bland and flavorless, the side salad is colorful but lacks a good dressing to at least put it over the top. I thought the combos were too expensive for a pizza so flavorless and unexciting.   You can get a totally awesome tasting, HUGE, super slice of pizza for $6.50. Here you'll pay almost $8.00 for a drink, salad, and a decent size slice. I would say go to Sabarro's instead. You'll pay just a little more, but your meal will taste waaaay better.   The decor is interesting, but looks unfinished. The restrooms are clean, but they look nasty, with graffiti and poorly placed bathroom fixtures. I would think a \"theme restaurant\"  located in the heart of Uptown Charlotte would have a better looking design. Its a mess here. Glad I don't own this restaurant, I would be embarrassed to have it in my portfolio."}
{"text":"This place gets 1 star for convenience. That's pretty much it. I went twice while working at the convention center and it was solely for convenience.   The first time I ordered a slice and some wings. The wings were way too salty and the pizza sauce is SOOOOO bland! Like they put Ragu on crust and went to work! The next time I ordered TWO slices because I'm a glutton for punishment...and because I only had 20min to eat and get back to my sessions in the convention center, so I needed something that could just sit on my stomach. Pizza was still bland. Nothing changed, as was to be expected. The service is LACKLUSTER! The first night I went, the guy behind the register was really friendly and was working quickly to get my order, and he's half the reason I gave this place a second chance after the first time. The staff the second time...Jesús Christo! The worst. Literally...THE WORST. I'd probably never come back here."}
{"text":"Small gas station themed pizza place! Right on the corner of Central and Pecan. Good pizza. I prefer my slices little thicker. I love that you can order by the slice! And it's also directly across some bars. Place is on the smaller end, but they also have outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Ordered from Fuel takeout the other night when we were completely starving and craving some good greasy cheesy pizza. The delivery came on time - as you know, when you are that hungry every minute counts - and he was very nice.   The whole way back up the elevator I was enveloped by the scent of melted cheese and greesy cardboard. I couldn't help it so I peeked in the box - it looked GOOOOOOOD. We got it home and began devouring it immediately - half regular, half chicken parm, which I regretted after I ordered it because I knew it wouldn't be the NY style chicken parm that we were craving. We were right, but it still wasn't THAT bad.   Our hunt continues for The Great Pizza, but Fuel did the job pretty well."}
{"text":"Great pizza terrible delivery service (2 hours).  I really do think this pizza is great, but operationally, they have to figure out how to deliver on orders in a more timely fashion."}
{"text":"There pizza is pretty good. The garlic knots and cin. knots are amazing. I love this location and the staff is great. Ive been eating here for about 9 years and i cant say its the best pizza but i always love what i get and clean my plate. Never got a bad meal here"}
{"text":"We went here before the Globetrotters game. Service was quick, a cross between cafeteria style and table service. The salad was decent. The pizza had good crust and toppings, but was the cheese real? I'm not so sure. I had the worst case of indigestion I've had in a year, but it could have been from something else.   Decor is early gas station, right down to the Sinclair and Pure signs. They had a big screen hanging from the ceiling with a projector showing the NCAA tournament.   I have tried the one on Central and the one on Davidson before, and remember about the same experience. They're all okay, I guess, but not my favorite pizza joints."}
{"text":"Dropped in for a quick slice. Reminded me of New York style pizza. It was ok. I tried the garlic knots too. They were terrible. Don't get them. The food was cheap and the people were nice so they've got that going for them."}
{"text":"Good and local, but ask them to run your slice through the oven twice - otherwise it doens't come out hot."}
{"text":"This place is probably the worst place in charlotte for pizza.  If you are trying to go here for the pizza, don't!!  Feul is probably an establishment for late night pizza and wings but you should partake in neither. If you want anything spicer than mild, don't even partake - the wings are useless and have zero sauce.  Pizza is okay and staff can be friendly if you get them on the right night.  But mostly you should know they will charge you for extra sauce - including if you just want hot wings with hot sauce which would seem like a given. Only redeeming fact about this place is that they serve craft beer in cans.  Otherwise don't order the wings unless you like dry, sauce less wings."}
{"text":"We had a great experience here.  They were packed because of a volleyball tournament. Customer service was great.  Pizza and garlic knots were excellent. Prices were fair.  I would recommend it.  Loved the BBQ chicken pizza"}
{"text":"GOOD NY STYLE PIZZA!!  This was exactly what I was looking for and it hit the spot. The tomato sauce had a nice zing, with a touch of basil. The cheese was thin and the crust was thin and chewy.   The chocolate chip cookie came out half baked, although I've had better it was still good.   $2 delivery fee. $13 minimum order. Smallest pizza they deliver is 12'' which is a small pizza but enough if you're hungry. Love it!"}
{"text":"Great wings and pizza and definitely worth the price. I visited Charlotte with my husband and daughter and didn't want to go out just wanted to something good and delivered. I had previously had Fuel when I lived in Charlotte and wanted to have it again.   The pizza was hot and delicious and the wings were great not too saucy and so many flavor options to choose from. My husband was thoroughly impressed and my daughter who is a picky eater was asking for more. Will definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Have had better n more for less.  Ordered take out..The side salad was old and browning.  The girl at the front was very nice, but they forgot to include my sauces...  The calzones are pretty good, stay away from the subs.."}
{"text":"not awful but definitely don't think it's worth they hype mainly because the crust is really bland.  service was prompt and folks were super friendly just not a $15 pizza in my opinion"}
{"text":"Delicious NY style pizza in a hearty portion! I also had the garlic knots and they where marvelous!! I will be back!! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for lunch one day while I was working across the street.  Had a slice of pizza and a soda, the pizza was decent, I mean who has ever had bad pizza?  But there was nothing special about it.  To sum the place up I would call it forgettable.  But if you just want a quick slice of pizza it will get the job done."}
{"text":"Went late on Saturday night in a word LOUSY!!! When one spends 20 some bucks for a pizza it should be good.. This was not, it was doughy hard to eat, I managed to get the only slice that was cooked right out of the whole pie.. Garlic knots were good overall dont' waste your money."}
{"text":"Standard college pizza joint in an old gas station. Great pizza and also Gluten-free crusts (the holy grail of GF) which are fantastic. I can't believe we didn't find this place until my son's senior year. They deliver too. Linoleum floors, lots of TV's and walk up service may put you off--but I'm telling you that you're going to love the pizza."}
{"text":"The Garlic knots are good and so are the wings and meaty pizza slices...$8.55! I had the \"C Combo\" with the meaty slice and the salt, pepper & garlic boneless chicken wings..."}
{"text":"Good new York style pizza with sub par service. I've never been to a pizza place that won't allow you to add an extra topping to a slice. The woman working the counter flat refused to add pineapple to my husbands two slices even for an additional charge. Never coming back to this location. Go to college street or steel creek. They give you what you want!!"}
{"text":"In need of something delivered, we opted for Fuel. It was better than I remembered!   We ordered one peporoni and one with 1/2 banana peppers and 1/2 mushroom. Let's just say that very little was left over! :)   Great job and tasty!"}
{"text":"Where do I start? The terrible service or the endless amount of disrespect? It bothers me that I can't just write this rating without giving ANY stars. The first time I came here was after a night on the town with friends...decent experience. I had asked for a cup to get some water but they handed my friends and I a few bottles of water instead, for free! That really made my friends and I realize we would definitely be returning! The buffalo chicken sub was yummy but cold. Anyway, the second time I came here was with my boyfriend. We were out with some friends but ended the night early because we were too tired and I had work the next day, so we decided to come here before the bars closed and to beat the crowd. We arrived around 11:00pm and there were only a few people in the restaurant at that time. The same guy had waited on us as the last time...we went on with our order and I proceeded to ask for a cup to get some water. He then says \"we do not give out cups for water, bottled water is $2.00\". I then began to explain the last time we were here that they were given to us for free and that he should have remembered, well, because he was the one to do it! So I asked to speak with a manager because it seemed as if he just didn't want to hear it...little did I know HE WAS THE MANAGER! Hahahaha LOL!!! What a joke...so much for great customer service right? He then proceeds to get his joke of a bouncer to come over and escort us out...for what reason? I couldn't tell ya! The entire situation was a joke and we were waiting for Ashton Kutcher to pop out with the cameras \"You just got Punk'd!\" However, that didn't happen, so my boyfriend and I took our business elsewhere. That's when we ended up at the Pita Pit. I never was a huge fan of Pita Pit but it was the only thing that was around and open at the time to serve food. The place was empty so we ordered pretty quickly and as we were waiting for our food, guess who shows up?! The bouncer from Fuel Pizza! He was talking to the other joke of a bouncer at Pita Pit, pretending to act like we weren't the reason he was at that place. Hmmm...what a coincidence! Lol so basically we were being watched and stalked the entire time we are waiting patiently for our food minding our business. I just don't understand...all my boyfriend and I wanted to do was grab a simple bite to eat before heading home for the night and it turned out to be a terrible experience with endless amounts of disrespect and humiliation. I have never experienced anything like this before and it is sickening to me that a business, like this Fuel Pizza location, stays open to the public. Instead of the \"bouncer\" paying attention to the REAL problems, they go after the innocent people, like my boyfriend and I, that were never looking to be involved or cause any kind of trouble. I think I'll just let karma take care of the rest for this terrible business."}
{"text":"Terrible service and rude staff!!! We ordered and sat down. 15 minutes later, a woman walked by and said \"I know I told y'all the calzone takes 20 minutes, right?\" She hadn't told us that but we said no problem. The calzone took an hour!! And both bathrooms were closed. Food was not that great and overpriced. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Ordered a lot from this location over the years. Pizza is good and take out usually timely.  A little pricy for what you get. Big problem is phone connection and delivery. Phone is ancient and hard to hear.  But tbats normal. Tonight we ordered 930p and told 45-60 minutes. They often say tbat and arrives 15 minutes and we tip big. This time, Hour later we called and were told it just went out door and would arrive in 10 to 15 minutes. After 2 hours, we called again and told same thing!  They added they Only had one driver and can only deliver in order received?!  Best we could tell, that meant they cooked pizza 90 minutes ago and just now delivering. Oh, btw, we are only 5 blocks away. Could hear confusion and new voices, grousing ... so new/holiday management?  We've ordered here for about 7 years and staff usually. Better than this.  Its now been 140 minutes. Had to cancel order and waiting to see if refund will actually appear.  Got no apology, just excuses that frankly sounded like lies. Sad we'll have to drop them."}
{"text":"Ok so I always go to the Central location, but I was at work which is closer to this location.  We ordered delivery and it came really quick.  The pizza was half done.  The other half was white, doughy, uncooked toppings. So I called and they sent a second pizza.  It was a little more done, but absolutely disgusting.  It was so soggy and greasy that it wouldn't even hold the toppings.  They slide off as soon as I pick up the pizza.  It made me sick and I lost my appetite.  I was extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"I love the food here. I love the pizza, I love the garlic knots and I love the salads. Pizza is just how I like it. Salad is always fresh and crisp.  The sauce tastes very fresh too.  Service is always up in the air...sometimes good, sometimes not. Pretty pricey which upsets me."}
{"text":"Not one of my favorite locations.  The only reason I have come here is because it's open late and if you are uptown and hungry...it's convenient.  The service is not always the best.  The food is ok, hit or miss.  The shop is not always the cleanest.    In the future, I will remember this and try to just avoid and go home."}
{"text":"So good this fuel pizza! Always a favorite so we took a chance and we did not see anything of the complaints others had. The food was hot the service quick they even added olives to a cheese slice for one in our party. It's the fuel pizza we love and the service was great. We got hit up by a pan handler and the manager was quick to politely intervene and send him on his way--which as a mom with 2 kids with me was really comforting that they were keeping an eye out. I will come back to this location any time we are here in uptown"}
{"text":"This Fuel's great success is about one thing - convenience. There's nothing else about it that makes it interesting, other than the fact that it's open later than almost anything in the nabe on the weekends. I mean, ya, it's neat that it's an old gas station, but seriously - A hot, albeit kinda-meh pizza, at 3 am, delivered, to your inebriated door, they're going to rake in boooookooooodles of dough.  At a nearby establishment that doesn't do food? Call these dudes. They'll plop that sucker down on the bar and make you 10 new BFFs in 20 mins flat.  Beer selection is pretty eek and what I wouldn't give for at least a beer or two on tap, but it makes my little heart sing to be able to grab a slice whenever I want. Thanks for being cool and open and everything, Fuel."}
{"text":"I have only eaten here once for lunch on a weekday. I had one of their combos which included 2 cheese pizza slices, 3 garlic bread 'knots' and a drink. Overall it was good food for what I paid ($6.75). It certainly is not the best pizza you will eat but it wasn't too bad and was certainly filling.  Its a good place to eat if you're in a hurry and looking for something cheap. The decor is strange garage/body shop look and it is not a trendy place to be in. But then for their price range they arent expected to be trendy.  I did find one thing weird - they had pizza dough sitting in a platter by the door when you enter. I don't know if thats part of the decor or a one time thing or what..but I sure hope thats not what my pizza gets made from!"}
{"text":"Ordered two medium one topping pizza's, 20 minutes later and they still were not in the oven! (P.S. it was not busy at all)Employees cussing each other out, terrible customer service after I said I want my money back employee raised his voice at me. We were not the only ones waiting for pizza for over 20 minutes... NOT worth your time, better off with a oven pizza probably would be same quality"}
{"text":"The food is amazing but what makes it spectacular is the service. Sage is wonderful - she went above and beyond to make our experience positive and they are so lucky to have her there!"}
{"text":"And now I realize why i only come here after a night of drinking. They got the order wrong even after clearly repeating it several times and there was a nice long hair in the dipping sauce. Yum!"}
{"text":"I know Fuel is predominately a pizza joint, but as much as I love their pizza, the one thing they do best is buffalo chicken wings. There are a few staples that one needs in life and for me a need for crispy, hot buffalo wings, drenched in cool ranch dressing, is a craving that hits me often. I will search high and low to find the perfect wings and thankfully, they can be delivered to my doorstep by Fuel (no matter what time it is).   Their wings have the best balance of spicy sauce to crispy skin. They offer a variety of sauces, but my favorite is the classic hot. Some people may complain that it is too spicy for their taste, but I think it packs just enough heat to break a sweat, but not too much to leave me hurting. I love to order my wings extra crispy, because there is nothing better then the crunchy bite of the skin before getting to the soft meat of the wing.    I can be a pain in the butt and ask for my wings to get a little extra attention (more specifically, some fresh chopped garlic and a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese) sometimes, but Fuel always puts up with my requests. They even know people can be picky about their carrots vs. celery and will let you customize your order to be \"all celery\" or vice versa.   I prefer to eat in when ordering wings, because they fry the wings upon ordering and I am ready and waiting to get my hands on them, but on a lazy Sunday (or late Saturday night) I will request a delivery of my order. My only complaint is that the Styrofoam boxes that the wings are packaged in tend to create perspiration and reduce the crispiness of the wings. If they could poke holes in the top of the box to let the wings breathe, life would be just perfect.   I dare you to find a better wing in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch yesterday with a co worker. Not too shabby. I've been to Fuel before but not this location. Good lunch specials. I got a slice of peperroni pizza & a side salad for $5.50 + a drink. I like the pizza. Good flavor and the crust is thin and crisp. The salad was a salad. The service was fast and friendly. If I really had a complaint it would be the location. On the corner of East Blvd & South Blvd, it can be difficult to get in and out."}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed with the pizza, although they had pitchers of beer for $8. The crust of the pizza was good, other than that, I wouldn't go for the food. Just a nice hang out spot."}
{"text":"Walking on a cold, next-to-New Year's eve night around downtown Charlotte, I wanted to grab some pizza. We found this Fuel Pizza restaurant. I see there's many of them around the area, but doing geographic research, this is the one I went to (near S. 6th).  The service was on point, and surprisingly it wasn't that busy at all on a Friday night.  Me and my father split a buffalo chicken pizza along with 8 wings. I had no complaints about either the pizza or wings; I enjoyed the crust of the pizza -- it's thick and I guess it tastes kind of like a Ritz cracker. The pizza had buffalo sauce, blue cheese, as well as bits of carrots and celery.   As far as pizza in Charlotte, it's pretty good, although I think Brixx has slightly fresher pizza. But I can't complain with Fuel Pizza; it's quick and fast 'za!"}
{"text":"I hadn't been to a Fuel Pizza in at least ten years and this location, maybe even longer ago than that. I used to work right across the street from it, when 22 was urban evolution. Lets see how many people remember THAT place. We used to get a neighborhood discount and I used to get slices, wings, and calzones all the time from here and I REMEMBER thinking it was good. Either my tastebuds have changed over the last 10 years ( doubt it, I was BORN a foodie), I wasn't being picky, or they have gone downhill since then.   Looking for some late night grub, me and some buds dropped in for a late slice. As expected the options were quite limited. I got a slice of what appeared to be white pizza with spinach. The size is kinda that in between size, where one is not enough, and 2 is a bit too much.   I took the thing home heated it up in the oven and even added some feta and fresh cherry tomatoes to it. Even still it was flavorless.  Flavorless sauce, flavorless toppings, flavorless crust. The only thing I could actually taste were the things I added to it. But seeing as though I refuse to salt pizza, that was how it was to remain. I did all I could with the feta and tomatoes, and just went to sleep thinking I had wasted money and stomach real estate. I mean if it can't taste good drunk, its definitely not gonna cut it sober. Want late night pizza? Pester a friend into taking you to Benny's instead."}
{"text":"I don't quite understand how but this fuel restaurant is no where near as good as the uptown location. Did not think there would be such a drastic difference.   Being from NY I absolutely love pizza. Pizza here just lacked everything!  First the sauce... The sauce the sauce the sauce! Where is the flavor?!? Really I think tomato soup would have more on the damn thing. The cheese... Again must be low quality, I just still am baffled at how different the pizza is amongst the chain in Charlotte.  I would say the dough is the only thing they have going for them, but it is just not cooked long enough. Throw some cornmeal on the bottom and cook the damn pizza!   I've had it delivered three times, and picked up twice.. So five times total same result. Soggy pizza, lack of flavor, and always needs to be put in the oven to crisp the dough.     Delivery is quick and service is friendly but... South blvd fuel pizza please get with uptown and figure your differences out!  I'm such a fan of them!"}
{"text":"Beside the price this place is delicious. They have an awesome white pizza, and the large is a 30\" pizza. I've only gotten delivery from this location, but it is always fast. Great location if you are at any of the near by bars and need a good slice, and they are open late. They also have gluten free pizza crust as an option."}
{"text":"The two stars are for one thing.. The SLICE.  It is a descent piece of pie that would only be completely wonderful at 3am after a long night of drinking.  Other than that, this place is grimy, creepy, and nasty.  I would suggest trying one of the other Fuels outside of the city.. Trust me.    -Ian M."}
{"text":"Is this a chain restaurant? I honestly have no idea.   Let me start off by saying this. This is the best pizza in Uptown. With that said, the pizza is just okay.   It's a shame that there's really not good pizza in Charlotte. The Hawaiian pie is okay. The cinnamon-knots are the best thing on the menu.  If you NEED pizza, I'd go there. Other than that, don't go out of your way."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, clean location and the best wings to go!  There is a reason fuel is my go to spot!"}
{"text":"Sober me gives this place 3 stars.  As far as wings go, these are some of  my favorite, extra crispy wings in Charlotte.  The pizza is always... well... pizza.  Decent, NY style pizza that is ok at best but nothing to write home about.  Sober me thinks they should change their name to Fuel Wings because those are the real shining star of the menu.  We got a pizza and 18 wings delivered last night (with a $2 delivery fee) and the total was $42 before tip, which I thought was a bit steep for what we received.  However, me after a few cocktails out in Plaza Midwood gives Fuel Pizza 5+++ stars.  Conveniently located in the middle of Central Ave and in walking distance to all the bars, this is a perfect way to end a fun night out.  The pizza is always hot and can be ordered by the slice.  Hang out with other patrons who have been over-served and enjoy the entertainment!"}
{"text":"Solid pizza place! Service was good, and we we had plenty of seating options. We shared a Margherita pizza and a White pizza amongst the four of us. The pizzas were cut into big slices which made it super easy to share!! One man working here had immaculate customer service and the guy who brought out our food was very friendly. Good atmosphere"}
{"text":"The WORST PLACE EVER!!! This place sucks so bad, I have tried 2 weeks in a row to order online, I even call to let them know I just ordered, they never confirm the order and new call you back, nothing! I usually try to give people the benefit of the doubt, but I whole heartly, hope they go out of business, what a bunch of slacker, lazy people that work at this location. It's only a block down the street, but they will never get business from me again. Like I could even get them to accept an order anyways... Yelp should drop them from the results."}
{"text":"Pizza is decent. Stick it in the oven and bing the cheese is gooey like when it was fresh. Open late!   Biggest gripe with this place is the price. In NYC the retail rent is higher and I'm sure those places are bringing in more revenue, however the slices are smaller and still more than $2 for a cheese slice. The specialty slices don't have massive chunks of whatever and are still almost $4/slice."}
{"text":"I did speak to one of the owners I believe his name is Patrick. He tried to smooth things over some what. His thing was the manager I dealt with is young and inexperienced and did not know how to resolve-my issue. Not once did he invite me back so that he could try and provide a better experience. Also I have noticed they removed all of the pictures I posted. I have reposted some pics and will continue to each time they are removed. So beware if you post something it may be removed."}
{"text":"I just watched the workers re-box a pizza I had pulled apart and touched before realizing it wasn't our order, and give it to the correct customer. They called our number and gave us the incorrect order. $20 for medium sized, mediocre pizza."}
{"text":"The service was not that great. I got 2 slices of pizza and they reheated them. They were still cold when they gave them to me. Not the best pizza place in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Would not give us a water cup even though we bought over 20$ in food! Why would we pay for a bottled water? Said they stop serving free water at 10! Even though we bought 2 slices of pizza and wings!"}
{"text":"Not the best pizza I have had around.It was OK but I have had better. I like all the antiques they have around and it seems like a good local hangout for the college students but other than that I have had better pizza around"}
{"text":"The people where very nice and helpful. They made me feel welcomed to be there. Food is hot and fresh! Would come again soon for the Salt/Pepper/Garlic wings and Buffalo wings. Loved the fact that the person helped me out the door with all the food we purchased. Great performance!"}
{"text":"Well I first have to start this review saying that fuel has a decent (not the best thickness or crust) but it is pretty good. It's in a league above papa johns or any of the other standard pizza joints... that being said, Dan the GM is the man! We had a debacle with a ordering service, (never use slice the app to get pizza) but Dan did everything to make it right and fuel is super lucky to have someone that shows that much passion for what he does."}
{"text":"I visited a friend in Charlotte and we ordered this pizza twice.  It was flavorful and had a chewy and tender texture.  You know, the kind that is meant to be in a crust. The sauce was just right and the toppings were fresh. Just scrumptious.   When I go to Charlotte again, I know where my next pizza is coming from.  UPDATE:  Went to Charlotte again in summer of 2016 and had the same perfect pizza.  Thank you, Fuel Pizza Cafe!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately it appears my previous review has disappeared???   I have been coming to Fuel for over 10 years off and on, as I have never been really impressed.  The one thing I do like it you can get pizza by the slice, which is very hard to find in Charlotte.  So, with that said, every time I go back I have hope it is better, but yet it hasn't changed.    The restaurant is an order at the counter type place, while they re-heat your slice(s) or prep whatever other menu item you may have ordered, and deliver it to your table.  There are several booths and tables, but the overall set up is nothing to be impressed by. And, unfortunately the staff is hit or miss.  The employees are all pretty young and don't really seem to care about customer service.  Last night was the first time someone actually walked around and checked on tables, which was nice to see. The menu offers pizza, salads, calzones, wings and a few other items. I have always had pizza which is nothing great. Based on the fact you select you slice from pre-made pies and the slices are reheated I have never received a 'hot' slice of pizza. It is always just warmed through. I have tried a salad a few times and let me just say, Avoid It!  It is a prepackaged salad with lettuce, chopped carrots and a tomato. The lettuce is always bad and in my mind why bother. Overall it is a good spot if you aren't looking for great pizza, but a quick bite from a variety of pizza by the slice options.  If not, keep driving as there are definitely a lot of other pizza spots in the area."}
{"text":"It shocks me that Fuel Pizza has been a staple on South Blvd for as long as it has.  I had so wished to update my review with a better rating, but I can only give them credit for a hot piece of pizza.  I was leaving work late one night and decided a quick slice of pizza would be easy. I called ahead and placed an order for a slice of cheese and a slice of pepperoni and a side salad.  Upon arriving the service was ridiculous. I do not think any of the workers care about customer service. Rude, short with customers and overall just made my pickup not pleasant.  My order was ready so I picked up the pizza box and bag and headed home. No salad dressing..UGH, I hate that. The pepperoni slice was good, but the cheese was made so sloppy with a spinkle of cheese, seriously. How do you mess up a slice of cheese pizza.  So, Fuel will not be my quick, go to spot when I am looking for something easy on a late night in the office."}
{"text":"The cheese pizza was warm, not close to hot and I  only live 3 blocks away, which means it sat there for awhile. Ordered one chocolate chunk cookie which was burnt. Never again."}
{"text":"Fuel was good and quick.  There are multiple locations in the area, and we thought this was the one that closed at 3:00AM.  It's not.  They were out of almost everything and we thought \"What the hell is going on?\"  Our bad.  Had we known they were minutes away from closing we wouldn't have come in.  Wife & I split the last three slices of Pepperoni and they were great."}
{"text":"Ordered at ORDER HERE sign. She sends me to the cashier. Cashier asks me to repeat my order to him. I give him an \"are you serious\" look. What a bunch of idiots."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times (at different locations) and the food doesn't really stand out to me.  I would rather go to Brinxx Pizza instead.  The last time I ordered Parmesan Wings (extra crispy) and a BBQ Chicken Pizza.  The wings had no flavor what so ever.  They were crispy almost to the point of being burnt.  The BBQ sauce on the pizza tasted like something you can buy out of the supermarket (can we say Kraft), and someone was kinda heavy handed.  There was more sauce on the pizza than there was crust, chicken, or cheese.  Not to mention that we had to wait a while for our food so in my mind it's going to be good and done right...hot and steamy.  Not that way at all.  The food wasn't hot and like I said before it wasn't good.  For the price that you pay they can do a whole heck of a lot better..."}
{"text":"This is the slowest service I ever had one pie of cheese and hot wings 30 minutes and the place is empty"}
{"text":"Right across from the convention center.  It's not gourmet and it's not even very authentic NY style pizza, but it's relatively quick, inexpensive, and decent enough.  Think 1980s mall food court pizza and you've got the picture.  My cheese pizza was above average and so were the garlic knots.  The service is mostly friendly and moves the line quickly.  If there's any fault, it's the lack of any artificial sweeteners for the unsweet tea.    But for a quick lunch near the convention center, you can do a heck of a lot worse."}
{"text":"This was a great choice recommended by our pedicab cyclist last night. Had a late night at epicentre need a greasy late eat. Delivered the pizza to our hotel within an hour. Being from a town where late night pizza isn't available... this was a treat. Pizza was a great all around. Received a phone call the following day asking about their service and pizza. It was good to know they care about how they are doing."}
{"text":"Cute store, really friendly staff.  Crust isn't as good as Pure's, but they have AWESOME garlic knots.  Good pizza.  GREAT garlic knots.  Super fast delivery.  Seriously, their drivers are on point - when we're watching the game and want pizza, it's always Fuel.  They are the fastest delivery in town, even during peak hours (they'll quote you a 60 minute delivery and be there in 30).  Not a huge fan of the stromboli, but the pizza is good.  You can order by the slice if you're dining in.  A friend of mine with a wheat allergy absolutely loves their gluten-free crust, declaring it much better than anywhere else in Charlotte."}
{"text":"We stopped by for some late night munchies last week and ordered #4 combo: 2 specialty slices, 3 garlic knots, and a drink for $9.50. They also have brews! yay.   It didn't take too long to get food out. I think the garlic knots were my favorite part of the meal. The tomato, ricotta, spinach pizza itself had a moderate amount of toppings but I found the sauce bland, crushed red chili helped. They really need to work on the sauce.... garlic salt goes a long way.   I'd come back here for drunk late night munchies if I didn't have any other options but I prefer Brixx."}
{"text":"This place was terrible. It took over an hour to get our food. Our food was then delivered cold! The calzone was under cooked. The dough was still raw. . The food just did not taste good. We didn't receive the cookie we ordered. No explanation. Said they would call and get us know. Still haven't. I will never order from here again."}
{"text":"Decent Pizza and bread sticks. Glad to know of a place with root beer in Charlotte. Went when moving a friend to Chicago. Took about 30 minutes to get the pop we spilled cleaned up though we did move tables. That was weird!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my family.  Friendly, courteous service, but most importantly,  loved the pizza.  Also had a side of Fries that were excellent.  I really liked the old gas station theme, too.  Kind of cool, but not too in-your face.   You order at the counter and they bring you your food, which is my favorite way of doing things.  And prices were very reasonable for what you got in an area of pricey real estate.  I was from out of town, but were I a local, I would definitely be back as a regular."}
{"text":"OMG this place has turned into a dump!  I have been eating at Fuel ever since they opened and they have gone way down hill.  They have no idea what customer service is and they mess our order up more often than they get it right.  The food isn't actually bad, but it isn't worth the experience of the hapless staff or the consistent errors with orders.  They really don't care and it shows.  If there is a manager in the place, you certainly couldn't tell.  You would think with all the new pizza places opening up near-by they would step up their game, but they only seem to get worse.  They had to call the police last time I was in a man was so mad about the staff.  I had to actually wake the person up at the register today because he forgot to even place my daughter's order for a slice of peperoni.  No apology or anything.  Just rude.  We usually eat at Fuel on average twice a week, but that is coming to an abrupt end today."}
{"text":"Charlotte - Welp Yelp ! This was an ok tasting Pizza but Ive had better. Maybe since Im from up North I really know what a good New York tasting Pizza taste like so maybe Im being a little harsh. The atmosphere was cool and Im not too excited on returning but its worth a try at the least."}
{"text":"So I thought maybe having new management was a good idea.  I have been hung up on twice now while im waiting to place an order for delivery.  Its 12:50-and im pretty sure they close later.  Might as well order your pizza from a chain."}
{"text":"Probably the worst pizza I've had in a while. The staff wasn't very friendly. The pizza was lukewarm and just okay. Not sure how this place has such great reviews because even the garlic knots-which I previously believed couldn't be messed up - were awful."}
{"text":"Super torn... I want to give this place more stars since I have been to this location numerous nights out and this place has stood the test of time with all the BAR Charlottes, clubs, etc just catty-corner from here.  It makes me sad people write that this place is \"dirty\" but I think that all falls within the Fuel decor theme.... usually when I go the tables are tidy and everything else is in order.  It could be the concrete floor and the overall look with the vintage signs and machinery sprinkled about the dining area.  Dining format... just like any other Fuel location, you approach the counter order your food and get a number.  Once the slices have been re-heated through the oven a server will bring it to you at your table.  Drinks are self serve... staff are friendly enough.  Maybe because this location has been here for a while, the staff take their customers for granted and the service may not be as sharp as it may have once been.  This location does have a tiny patio and their front windows open up when the weather is nice.... it's a good option if you find yourself uptown, but I think the other location on the Green  is literally just 4 blocks away.  With the 7th Street Market and Pure Pizza doing their thing in the market, I guess it's a hard sell for me to walk another block for pizza that's okay.  Oh, I forgot, Brixx is nearby too... Maybe they should change the name of 1st ward to \"pizza ward.\""}
{"text":"One summer I decided to get in a fist fight with my cousin at a family reunion. He's a lot bigger than me and had a lot more people on his side. Things weren't looking good for me. In the end, my cousin fell backwards and broke the small of his back.  We were traveling from Chapel Hill to Spartanburg. And look, we ALREADY KNOW that we are eating at Pizza Man in Covington, La. tomorrow night. We explained this to the parking lot attendant after pulling over in Charlotte and even HE thought it was weird. Fuel Pizza did not have a lot going for it, but in the end, the parking lot attendant stumbled backwards and broke the small of his back.  First of all everybody, we were floored by the really fun looking Charlotte skyline (and we are skyline enthusiasts to the max, bro). Then we were floored by the really fun Za at Fuel. The food came out fast, it was inexpensive, and was located in a fun spot in the city. Not far from the interstate. It was everything we wanted. We were so satisfied with our experience that we went back in time and warned my cousin about that banana peel and I ended up getting punched in the face."}
{"text":"Very disappointing service burnt pizza cold pizza forgot half our order and when the garlic knots got here they were as hard as golf balls. Then they over charge on the bill all around terrible. Stay away"}
