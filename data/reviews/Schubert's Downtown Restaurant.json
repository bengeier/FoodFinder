{"text":"Very good baked goods.  The veggie hash was very good.  The BBQ was pretty bland--would not recommend.  Great variety in the menu, which is fun.  The server was nice but also very very slow."}
{"text":"The new menu is fantastic and service is always prompt. One of my favorite breakfast spots! Try the mexican haystack!"}
{"text":"Schubert's is another local hidden gem in Mount Horeb.   The atmosphere has a vintage blue plate diner/lunch counter feel to it. There is a counter you can sit at, or a combination of tables and booths. The seating is limited and fills up fast for weekend breakfast/brunch hours. There isn't much room to wait indoors, either. So if you have to wait for a table, be aware you may be standing outside to wait.   The food is delicious. Schubert's has a breakfast and lunch menu as well as a bakery. They make doughnuts, bars, breads, and rosettes that you can purchase and take with you. The menu is full of fresh foods that incorporate seasonal fare along with daily specials. Service can be a little slower during busy times, but that's to be expected.   As a local, I like stopping in during the week for lunch or breakfast, when the vibe is much more laid back and homey. Weekends can get very hectic with visitors. If you are wanting to stop from out of town, try going during a weekday if you can.   Also, Schuberts is only open for lunch and breakfast. I kind of wish they were open for dinner, too, as the availability of good sit down restaurants in the area are slim."}
{"text":"mediocre food. Bad service. uncomfortable furniture. Skip this, lot's of places on main st."}
{"text":"Was excited to go here recently, since it had been years and years.  I remember buying their soft rye bread and getting \"The Hungry Norwegian\" breakfast.  I don't know when it closed/changed names/changed owners/re-opened/whatever, but at the present time it's not impressive.  Maybe it's because I compare all chocolate chip pancakes to Original Pancakes House's (fluffy, rich flavor, and real whipped cream on top), but these were pretty pathetic.  Very thin with crispy, slightly burned edges (what is it with me and burned food??) and a flavor rather like the just-add-water mixes you get in the grocery store.    And pile on the carbs, I also had to try one of their biscuits.  Not very many places around here where you can get a yummy homemade buttermilk biscuit.  But apparently I won't be adding Schubert's to that list.  Very, very dry and tasteless.  Reminded me of the frozen kind you get that are already baked and you just heat them up.  I felt a little like a sucker forking over $1.20 for it."}
{"text":"In Madison for a long late September weekend. Badgers playing the Buckeyes, in Columbus, but, always a nice college football vibe watching the Badgers in one of the many \"venues\" available in Madtown. Friday A.M., the Life and I, and our dear friend, Lonna, decide to take a morning drive in the beautiful Southern Wisconsin countryside. We wind up in Mount Horeb Troll country, and decide to have breakfast. Drive down Main Street, and right smack in the middle of town happen upon Schubert's. Everything about the place says \"old fashioned hearty breakfast\". So, we entered and were not disappointed. The space screams old fashioned. Bright, tall windows letting in the early Autumn sunlight. Pastry display right by the door tempting us. Old wooden inviting booths and tables with checkered tablecloths. A soda counter and stools along one wall with a loooooooong chalkboard on the wall behind the counter describing the daily specials.  We were given a table by the front windows. The owner, Jerry Schubert, brought us a rosette sample that was baked that morning. I am not a sweet guy, but was feeling a bit magnanimous, so I tried it. It was melt in your mouth delicious. Not sickening sweet as I imagine all pastries are, but just good enough and sweet enough to make me eat a whole one.  The menu, indeed, did have all the \"old fashioned\" items; eggs, hash browns, omelets, pancakes, but, it also, curiously, had a bevy of items that I would guess might be somewhat foreign to a Mount Horeb, Wisconsin Diner and Bakery: Mexicana Haystack, Lefse Breakfast Burrito, Roasted Veggie frittata, and, 4 soups.  We all stayed fairly traditional. The Life had Cinnamon Streusel French Toast. It was fabulous. Again, not sickening sweet, but a bevy of favors sprinkled with real fresh blueberries and raspberries.  Lonna had a very traditional egg and hash brown breakfast. Eggs done perfectly. Browns crispy out, mellow in. Sumptuous Swedish Rye toast.  And I had the corned beef hash. Sounds a little pedestrian, but after Jerry's daughter, Kathleen, explained how they made it, I couldn't resist, and I made the right choice. They hand cut the corned beef, and make each item to order. It was \"infused\" with just the right amount of hollandaise. I'm not sure how that sounds, but it was fantastic.  Although the place was a tad busy for 10:30 on a Friday morning, Kathleen Schubert gave us a brief rundown about the \"fresh\" agenda at Schubert's. She shops daily for ingredients, and is a standard at the Mount Horeb farmer's market picking up seasonal veggies and organic eggs from a local source.  All in all it was a wonderful breakfast, and an interesting experience.  Now, this may seem a bit long winded. But, My Life and Lonna decided to do a bit of shopping. If there is one thing in this world that will crush my life enthusiasm, it's shopping. I told her that I wanted to write a review about Schuby's while it was fresh on my mind and taste buds. I repaired to the Grumpy Troll, a local Brew Pub, ordered up a Rochester Rocket Amber Ale, and just started pounding out my thoughts. The length is circumstantial evidence that I may have had two. (If you come to Mount Horeb, it would be a travesty not to stop here for tasty brew).  But, that should not, in the least, diminish the veracity of my words relative to Schuby's.   In fact, I'm kinda dragging this out so that I can go back and get some jambalaya for lunch."}
{"text":"I have vague memories of stopping here last year, so when my girlfriend and I were in the area I wanted to go again. I had the grilled cheese without onions, which was one of the best sandwiches I have EVER had, with the berry house salad, also amazing. The berries were somehow perfectly ripe, the goat cheese was delicious, and the dressing extraordinary. My girlfriend had the eggs benedict and a bowl of the tomato soup. She said the soup was good, but when I asked about the eggs they were \"indescribable. Absolutely wonderful,\" so I'm guessing those were the star of the show. All in all, one of the best meals we've ever had. I would have immediately left this review if I had signal at the time. We'll for sure be back."}
{"text":"We stopped here on the way back from a  weekend in Dubuque for a late breakfast (based on the 4 stars from Yelp). Once again, yelp didn't disappoint.   My wife had the egg white mediterranean omelet (personally, I'll never see the point of an egg white omelet, but what do I know?). She said she would have liked to have just a big plate of the filling, it was excellent.  I had the haystack which was also excellent. Featured *real* homemade hashbrowns (not frozen, not pre-cooked potatoes, actual from scratch hash browns). Pretty surprising as they are getting almost impossible to find. Eggs were perfectly cooked. Toast was excellent.   Two complaints...  1. Service was slow, especially waiting for food. Had to wait for a coffee re-fills a couple of times. And it wasn't jam packed. 2. Seemed a bit pricey to me for what you got, $8.50 for the Haystack which really wasn't all that big.  Funny, they only brought one piece of toast and said we could have another if we asked (waitress said they were throwing out too much toast). However, by the time I got my second piece of toast, i was done eating. She should have said something when I ordered.   Minor nits in an otherwise excellent food experience. If I was in Mt. Horeb again, I would certainly eat here. Recommended for breakfast.."}
{"text":"What a wonderful place to eat. I could stop by here every day.  Great food and wonderful staff!"}
{"text":"I, like many of the other reviewers, found Shubert's after a long sweaty ride on the bike trail. The food is quality, home cooked, unassuming goodness. Sit at the bar and admire the decor and the waitresses, order the sodas and lefse!  The reuben, fried fish, and tuna fish are great, but the bread pudding is the summit. Delicious cinnamon bread with creamy lemon syrup!"}
{"text":"Great food good service. Love the environment and always look forward to another great time."}
{"text":"Cute place, but that's where the good ends. Plate w 2 eggs, toast with rancid butter and hash browns was $16. Totally soaked in grease. Way over priced. Side of hash browns were $7. Those others saying this place is reasonably priced must be eating at some high end places for breakfast. Suggest you avoid this place unless you want some expensive greasy grub."}
{"text":"We started our day there with breakfast. Perfect portions, great price, delicious food, friendly staff. Everything tasted fresh. We spent the rest of the morning taking in the town (it was National Mustard Day) and then went back around noon for milkshakes and rosettes. I was tempted to get a phosphate, but was really craving the milkshake."}
{"text":"Schubert's is such a great idea, a small town diner with authentic 'food,' BUT IT ALWAYS DISAPPOINTS. My main complaint is the agonizingly slow service. Yet, I return, hoping my last visits just caught them on a bad day.  So on my last adventure to Mt. Horeb, I browsed the nearby bookstore, gallery and the always interesting Duluth Trading Company, giving the lunch crowd time to finish. Even then, sloooooow, despite the empty tables. And the last straw, the nicely prepared chicken wild rice soup with grilled Gouda w/carmelized onions, as tasty as that sounds, arrives barely luke warm.   I plan to try the Mexican diner down the street on my next visit as I love Mt. Horeb' Main Street and can't stay away."}
{"text":"Retro without being precious or pretentious, this place is an old school small town soda fountain/casual restaurant and is worth visiting just for the atmosphere. As a bonus, the food is great. Don't miss getting a chocolate malted. If you only have one in your life this is the one to get if you have the chance."}
{"text":"I've been to this café several times and the food is consistently excellent. it's a small town quaint diner and they have homemade pies that are to die for. the staff is always very friendly and you feel welcome. The prices are very reasonable as well."}
{"text":"** Update *** Sign is now OPEN for business.  Yes! Time to go test this out the new and improved Shubert;s.  This place has been in the same location for over 100 YEARS!     ** Update***  Sign in window says closed due to change in ownership.  Updates to follow!"}
{"text":"After visiting the Mt. Horeb Mustard Museum, this is the place to go for lunch.  It's retro-fabulous.  They have a counter with the little round stools, or regular booths or tables.  They have the old-style malt mixers, you can get the standard burgers and fries.  They also have vegie-oriented options or salads. You MUST get a rosette if you go here.  You can get one as an add-on to a shake, or buy them separately.  It's a deep fried cookie made on a branding-iron type form, then dipped in sugar.  The owner comped us two for our kids as we were finishing lunch. The service was friendly.  The food was good.  It's worth the trip all by itself.  But you also get to see trolls!  It's great!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Schubert's for breakfast on the weekend at least once a month for the past 17 years.  Schubert's is one of those little pieces of Americana that is so rare and should not be missed.  Wonderful food, attentive staff, reasonable prices, just a classic small-town diner experience.  They are closed on Monday's but if you find yourself in Mt. Horeb Tuesday thru Sunday in the AM, treat yourself to breakfast at Schubert's.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great food and great atmosphere. It feels like you are stepping back in time, but the menu is modern diner food with a Scandinavian touch. Baked goods and rosettes are great. Good soup and sandwiches too. Breakfast is good, I loved the biscuits and gravy and lefse wrap.  Nice option to upgrade to local eggs too."}
{"text":"This was ABSOLUTELY. The WORST restaurant experience we have had.  We walked in to the seemingly charming throw back restaurant and were not even greeted... No instructions whether to be seated or wait to be seated.  We stood around looking \"lost\" for a few minutes... But no assistance was to be had.  An elderly gentleman, who I assume to be the owner, shuffled about behind the counter, but did nothing to welcome us.  We sat down, and waited some time before having menus brought over.  We were optimistic, as they had some nice selections.  My husband order the homemade corned Beef hash, and I ordered the hash brown turn over.  His hash, though it looked deliciously homemade, was slight in quantity.  And my breakfast looked great as well.  BUT neither had any visible sign of the Hollandaise Sauce that was listed on the menu.  When we told the waitress that they forgot the Hollandaise, she snapped back, \"yes it does I watched them put it on...see it's that yellow stuff\"...when what she was pointing to was my over easy egg yolk I had just poked open.  I turned my hashbrowns all around showing her that there was no Hollandaise. After a couple more argumentative declarations that it was there, she finally said, \"it is there, but do you want a side ?\".  We said that would be fine.  Several minutes later she came out with 2 was extremely small silver cups of cold hollandaise, setting them down, saying something to the effect that they only have the stuff in the fridge and they had no way to heat it up.  Let me add that these EXTREMELY SMALL cups were only half full (probably 2 TEAspoon full).  We were extremely frustrated..but we were going to make do.  The waitress then goes and stands just inside the kitchen door and starts \"b- - - Hing\" that \"THEY said there was no Hollandaise....\". Rather than Trying to keep the customer happy - she chose to loudly complain...loud enough that we could hear her clearly.  No apologies, just a horrible attitude. In my 50plus years I have never walked out of a restaurant...but today I did.  I was hoping to get a wonderful homemade breakfast, and home town hospitality here at Schubert's...but we had to leave and go down the street to get that!!  Slightly less nostalgia...but definitely much better hospitality! P"}
{"text":"Good little family diner w/lots of interesting bakery treats.  Worth a stop when you need a rest from all the trolls and stuff on the street."}
{"text":"Dirt cheap, delicious, a true townie diner. In addition, the rosette's are crispity crunchity deliciousness with the lightest dusting of powdered sugar. You can't afford to not go."}
{"text":"Great little old style soda fountain/diner. They are one of the only places in Wisconsin that you can still get a phosphate. I hear chocolate/vanilla mix is good.   Norwegian meatballs were good. Food is good, portions are big. Worth a trip if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Yum!!!  Great food, great service, cute place. They serve breakfast all day and are a bakery with tasty treats. Great price too. The food was delicious. I would definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since 1982.  Full disclosure: I've been stopping here on my way to trout fishing and/or Gov Dodge St Park every few years since 1982.  Here is what my impression was 30 years ago: quiet, old-fashioned, handmade, hearty, great tastes, great pastry, great bread, nice atmosphere.  I would not say that much has changed here.  They still make authentic baked goods, whose taste and texture contrast strongly with the defrosted microwaved stuff you get at supermarkets and chain restaurants.   Their cinnamon bread is incredible.  You'd really be a fool not to leave with a loaf.  Their other breads are very good.      The last time I was here I had eggs and potato sausage.  The sausage is excellent, and as good as I have ever had.  OK, I can only compare with Ann Sather's but this was as good or better.  My GF had the Lefke (sp?) wrap which was very substantial, and delicious.    Their prices are very reasonable, especially for someone used to paying big-city tabs.  I have never eaten anything but breakfast here, so of lunch and dinner I cannot comment.    I dig the country look with the old painted designs on the wall and the old counter.  Never change that. It's a trademark.  Also, stick with the local art.  It suits this place.   Here is what they could change:  Get better coffee, cover the pastries that sit on the counter...I wanted to buy some, but there were flies on them, so, no way Jose.  Just cover them, no matter what season. Also, the glass cases need serious renovation or replacement.  I am always so glad, every time I visit SW Wisconsin, that a place like Schubert's still exists."}
{"text":"Stopped in here recently for a burger and saw that they had broiled Cod so I changed my mind as did someone else in our party.    The Cod was over cooked and dry for both of us.   Also overpriced a bit at 8.95   The service was pretty good and everyone was cheerful and talkative which we liked.  But the bottom line is you have to have good food.   Do the chefs even try their dishes.  Big disappointment and I knock them down 3 stars.   Won't be back for a long time except maybe to get a shake."}
{"text":"Slow wait service and a decor that looks more rundown than throwback. The tin ceiling may be original but the large pieces of paint peeling off of it ready to fall on you are not. I ordered pancakes and had to ask for syrup....really? The blueberries in the pancakes were tasteless. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"The new Schuberts is a huge improvement over the last.  The menu is interesting, with some classics like phosphates and grilled cheese, but some new tastes like 6 different grill cheese options including goat cheese.    This place has the potential to be great.  The redecorated inside is classic and fun, the menu and specials are interesting, and the bakery items look good.  However, they are missing the boat on a few service and quality-related issues.  Consider our visit:  We ordered the special, apple/blueberry/pumpkin seed whole wheat pancakes, eggs & sausage, eggs & bacon, and plain pancakes.  The pancakes were good, especially the whole wheat pancakes.  The sausage was awful.  Really, really awful.  The eggs were very pale and plain as well, although later we saw we could have upgraded to free-range eggs for $1.75.  When I'm paying $6.50-8.50 for an egg dish at a restaurant that brags about their fresh pastry items, I think decent eggs should be a given.  Does the owner not want to serve the best tasting, not to mention most sustainable, food available?  The break was mediocre, although we still don't know what kind we received.  We ordered the Swedish Rye, but it didn't taste like rye, nor was it the shape of loaf on display when we checked out.  Which brings me to the service - bad.  Not only from our waitress, but it seems like a systemic problem:  We were seated at a dirty table.  I asked the waitress to wipe it, which she apologized and then did, visibly wiping crumbs into her hand.  The specials were not explained to us; we only found out about them after asking about what was written on the board.  When ordering, we weren't given a choice on the size of the drink, and only a white/wheat option was given for toast.  Only when I asked about the other bread were were given more bread choices.  Now, this is a place that advertises their bread on the front window!  They normal slow-to-refill water, slow-to-check-in issues were there, but was really got us was the wait for our bill after we had finished our meal.  We waited so long we got up and went to the counter, presumably checking out with the owner.  We didn't have a ticket, so he basically told us to step aside until the waitress brought it over, with no efforts to expedite the painfully slow process.  No asking us how our meal was.    Don't get me wrong - this isn't a bad place.  It's just not nearly living up to what it really could be with some upgrades in the quality of ingredients and service.  I would visit Schuberts again, but probably not for a while."}
{"text":"Come here for the atmosphere. Or come here for the food. Both get all the stars from me... ALL THE STARS.  This place is family-run, and you feel like you may have fallen down a little rabbit hole and ended up somewhere in 1963--but with fantastic menu options. They play records from the 50's and 60's, and it is DARN PLEASANT.  I feel like time literally slows down for me when I enter, and any stress just kind of melts into the background while I'm here.  I've been here for breakfast, lunch, and afternoon tea, and I've only been blown away by the friendly service and great selection. There's something for everyone (veggies are welcome too!).  The first time, I came in to try Lefse, because I'd never had it and wanted to try it very, very badly. I sat at the diner stools and enjoyed a Rooibos tea (they have a really good loose-leaf tea menu!) with Lefse (which, it turns out, is the same as a Swedish pancake lol). The Lefse was spongy and tasty and perfect (well, to my noob palate anyway). I had it with a little butter.  For breakfast, I cheated and ordered the Veggie Scramble (which is technically on the lunch menu, but I'd heard about it and they were happy to make it for me). It's a mildly curried scramble with squash and kale and everything lovely. I hate to say it's better than breakfast at Mickie's Dairy Bar, so I won't (not out loud anyway). It was so good I ate the whole darn thing.  When I had lunch, I enjoyed the Norwegian meatballs (also ate the whole darn thing lol), which come served on mashed potatoes (these taste just like my German gramma's--no joke!) with a side of seasonal veggies. The meatballs were really, really good. ALMOST as good as my aunt's Swedish meatballs, but we won't get into any nationalism today. lol  The bathroom is located upstairs, and though I haven't had the pleasure of having to go while I'm there yet, I've heard it's quite the destination (I don't know what this means, but everyone says this with a wink, so I'm super curious and will have to check that out next time).  However, if you need a handicap-accessible bathroom, I don't think this is the place.  Parking is Mt Horeb street parking. If you're gonna come out here, make a day of it--the town is absolutely adorable, and there's so much to see!"}
{"text":"Superbly small town Wisconsin quaint. Perfect place for a lazy Saturday morning in summer. Egg-celllent breakfast, homemade bread, bearclaws. Heilig!"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch breakfast.  We took a loaf of bread home.  Tradition hopefully great place"}
{"text":"Randomly stopped at this cute place for lunch because we had been in the car for hours driving. So glad we picked this place! The veggie hash was bomb.com I'm so glad the sweet waitress told me it was a good option. Couldn't have been more pleased. The bathroom was a little different--upstairs but hey, it was one I won't forget at least!"}
{"text":"This little diner never disappoints. Even on busy mornings, I have had great service and tasty food. I've only ordered breakfast entrees, sweet rolls, and occasional milkshakes while walking by. I've had a great experience every time and love the small town, old school diner feeling."}
{"text":"The restaurant looks just like it did in the 70's when we took family trips through town.  Nice to know some things remain unchanged. It's like stepping back in time. Love the breakfast's.  The persian rolls melt in your mouth."}
{"text":"Good coffee, good service. Kitchen was closed so unable to eat from the menu but we tried their pastries and lefse and they were some of the best. Overall great place to stop!"}
{"text":"Schubert's is a treasure in Mount Horeb, which isn't far at all from Madison. If you haven't been since before last summer the menu is completely different but the ambiance, pleasant staff, and delicious baked goods haven't changed. The corned beef hash is one of the best in the area and, honestly, I haven't tried a menu item yet that wasn't fantastic. I love that their serving sizes are reasonable and they don't use a lot of salt. They now offer a handful of vegetarian options and you can order soups, grilled cheese, or lunch items throughout the day. I'm a sucker for their grilled brie and jelly (jalapeno raspberry!). We usually leave with pastries, cookies, pie or bread; all made on-site. Their wait staff is always smiling and on top of things. With everything they offer, you'll find the prices are extremely reasonable compared to most other breakfast joints in the area."}
{"text":"Last weekend we decided to take advantage of the good weather and head out west of Madison for a nice drive in the country. Once you get west of Highway 78 there's all sorts of beautiful back roads with great scenery and fun turns, although with my wife riding shotgun I can't get too crazy.   Anyway, we hit up Schubert's for lunch and ended up having breakfast at 1:30 pm, because breakfast all day is never a bad idea. We had the Mexicana Haystack and Hash Brown turnover, both of which were basically big huge piles of hash browns with assorted toppings and eggs on them.   A couple minor quibbles: I like my hash browns nice and crispy and browned and these were a bit under-done for my liking. My wife asked for poached eggs and they brought out two poached eggs in a little side bowl that she then had to put on top of her dish. The yolks were more like medium done than fully runny, probably had been poached ahead of time. Those things aside, it was a big ol' hearty diner breakfast for 9 bucks each. Not bad.   Best part was I saw this guy walk by with a GIGANTIC piece of some kind of cake with chocolate that had been drizzled over the top, so I went up to the bakery case to check it out. I asked for a piece of chocolate strawberry shortcake. The \"piece\" was the size of an entire small cake, and fantastic.   So fire up your sports car, pick out some back roads on google maps, and grab some cake. Just try not to have it fly around the car when you take a turn too fast."}
{"text":"Good food. Service was a little slow and underwhelming but not a big deal to us as we wanted to not worry about small chat early in the morning. Little high price for what we got ( 1/2 order eggs Benedict meaning 1 egg on biscuit with ham and hollandaise was $6 and a side of hash browns was $4 or so). Excellent coffee based drinks and food tastes great but wouldn't come if you're on a budget."}
{"text":"I'm from Ireland the Cornish pasty's are the best I've had in America...so happy this place is near me .. staff super friendly too"}
{"text":"Great local place with lots of history to it. I was there for breakfast.  They do have organic eggs option that is easy to miss."}
{"text":"Restaurant Review Mt Horeb how you are a dream town. I had the luck of coming into town during a summer festival and parade. The town itself sends your memories back to the olden days where neighbors were friendly and entertainment meant being part of a community. Maybe one day I will move here, but I digress. This restaurant is a jump back into the past. The menu has great american diner classics. The food came out fresh and the staff was super friendly. I believe the owner was playing a violin while people ate. I cannot put it into words but this was an experience that cannot be missed if you want to step back in time  Pro- Inexpensive, classic american diner dish, super friendly staff  Con- None  Hidden deal- Inexpensive across the board compared to Chicago prices. Make sure you get dessert!"}
{"text":"If I could give Schubert's 5 1/2 stars I would, but the app only goes up to 5.  Heck, I'd even give them a 10 if I could.    Service so friendly you feel so welcomed.  The organic eggs are not an extra fee and that's already a sweet, big plus.  Guess what else is not an extra fee, gluten free bread!!!  If you ask for gluten free bread they don't charge extra!  Every restaurant and diner across America should take a page from Schubert's book and learn a little something.    Ok, let's get down to real business.  We ordered the Carrot Dill soup, the Watermelon Gazpacho soup and the Curried Squash soup, and they were ALL AMAZING!  Each and every single one of them was so well made and tasty.    For the main dish I had the Mexicana Hash (without the chorizo - since I don't eat meat, got mushrooms instead) it was so good and filling.   The prices are very reasonable and the diner has an old school ambience feeling to it, it's very authentic and welcoming.    The only gripe I have with Schubert's is that they're not open for dinner.  Why!?!?     If you're in Mount Horeb, Schubert's is a must visit."}
{"text":"Great Midwest food...with a flair! Amazing old time building. Restaurant is over 100 years old. Reasonable pricing."}
{"text":"We ate lunch here on a Saturday and it was great! We also learned you can get breakfast all day long, so will keep that in mind. They have a large menu of soups, sandwiches, salads, specials and desserts all written on the wall. Since we were there for lunch we decided on a cup of soup (butternut squash/apple) and a grilled cheese. There must have been 5 different grilled cheeses listed but I chose brie with a berry jalepeno jam and my dining companion had the gouda with caramelized onions. The grilled cheese sandwiches are made with their homemade bread and both were excellent! The bakery case was sparse so they must sell out early. Next time I would definitely like to try something. Service was friendly and fast even with it being the Fall Festival. Try this place, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"YAY for this place!  I used to stop here while traveling through town for work all the time and my co-worker and I always had a good time and a great meal here!  Decor is cool, menu always peeks my interest and I always walk away from this place thinking, \"I wish I lived closer to Mt. Horeb\"!  The shakes are sooooo good!"}
