{"text":"We went last weekend and had a ton of fun.  There were about 5 or 6 trucks and all sounded great. Apparently they rotate the trucks every week, so you can go and get something different each time.   We got a chicken and rice stew from a Caribbean/African truck and it was excellent. They also had gingerbeer which was so amazing!!!  We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Live music, family friendly, laid back place to hang out;  I know of nothing else like it in Scottsdale.  Food is cheap & still very tasty - definitely better than what I would have expected at such a casual outdoor venue.    Tip: There are a bunch of random tables set up to eat at for people who either get there early or reserve them ahead of time; I'd definitely recommend reserving one!!    In summary, this place was very cheap & and surprisingly great food - who would have thought you could go to a \"food truck\" & order yummy duck sliders??!!!"}
{"text":"DO NOT HIRE THIS VENDOR FOR YOUR WEDDING!!!  Let me start off by saying that I am a wedding planner and specialize in outdoor/desert-style weddings mostly in California. My husband and I got married in September 2017 out in Joshua Tree area, CA and Lori and the Food Truck Caravan team were our caterers.  The main reason I hired them was because they were catering one of my clients weddings at the exact same venue as mine and figured that, by then, they would know the venue well and we would have a good working relationship. WRONG.  Let me walk you through a few things that happened that made my dream wedding feel more like a disaster:  1) We had 70 guests. I paid for 70 guests to eat. About 24 ate the full meal. My entire head table + myself and my husband did not even get to the Poutine Station we were so excited about (I'm Canadian). The elote salad (which I was also super excited about) was more like a bunch of kale with a spoonful of roasted corn. Not at all what the menu described. If you are a professional caterer, you account for 5%-10% of extra food just in case. Running out is NOT an option. She did send her chef out to get burgers at a restaurant down the street however, by the time she came back we were already on the dance floor and a handful of people took a burger.  2) The service took 40 minutes longer than planned. Why? Because Lori did not bring a Food Truck like she said she would. Instead, she decided to save herself some money and rented a local taco cart that ran out of propane. Instead of asking the venue for more propane, she chose to continue to have the chef cook our entire wedding meal for 70 guests on a one-burner taco cart. I can't even make this stuff up.   3) While we were taking our romantic photos, I saw one of her chefs/servers prepping the food out of the back of their pick up truck. We had rented her 2 prep tables but there we even extra wooden tables she could have used but decided the back of the pick up truck was a much wiser choice?!  4) She and her staff were rude. Aside from a couple nice servers, my wedding planner overheard Lori asking my MOTHER how many times had she been up to the taco cart? What!!? Needless to say, guests were very hungry.  5) They didn't respect the venue rules and the entire team vanished right after dinner. They didn't take out the trash (in fact, they gave my wedding planner attitude when she asked them to) and they just disappeared after dinner. By the way, she outsourced her whole team so it wasn't anyone I had worked with on my previous client's event as far as I know.  I reached out to Lori by email a few weeks after my wedding expressing my disappointment and wondering what happened on her end. I asked for an apology, acknowledgement and 50% refund for not providing enough food, for not providing the proper equipment and for not providing capable staff. Her reply? Something along the lines of \"Your budget was too low, we shouldn't have taken this on. I wish I could change how things went but I cannot so I will not be refunding you anything\".  The only good feedback I got from my friends and family was the charcuterie board Lori provided as appetizers.   Needless to say, I would not recommend this vendor for any event at this time. Maybe things work differently in Arizona but in California, we have high expectations for our weddings REGARDLESS of their budget. I personally always give my clients 110% and I would never cut corners to save a few dollars here and there.   Feel free to reach out to me if you have questions about my experience!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Over hype under deliver. Bad parking lot layout. No seating. Not friendly. Selections very limited. Save time and eat at a nice Scottsdale restaurant."}
{"text":"An absolutely chill setting on downtown Scottsdale's 5th Ave. Solid food truck representation, yet not overwhelming. And the solo guitarist can rip some seriously leads (but at a cool volume)!  Get some tacos from Super Farm Super Truck, fresh washington fish or unique coffe brews like the Sun Devil from Affagato Handcrafted Beverages.   Check it out, you'll dig it!"}
{"text":"Can't believe it took me over two years to finally check this out! It's getting a bit too hot to want to indulge outdoors but nevertheless I enjoyed checking out these food trucks. I love being able to sample different types of food, and food trucks are a great way to get a taste for a few things. I was on a double-date and my date and I split the lobster tater tots from the Cousins Maine Lobster truck. So good! The tots were topped in a creamy cilantro sauce and pico de gallo. We considered trying the lobster roll, as I've never had one, but it is $17 for a tiny sandwich! Seemed kind of crazy at a food truck, even though it's lobster. We also shared a quesadilla from the Queso Good truck. I've seen this truck cruising around town and have always wanted to try it --Â and it did not disappoint! We got the Toro Verde quesadilla, which had shredded beef and roasted green chile. It came with a side of chips and salsa, too. We couldn't finish either of the things we got as they were pretty indulgent choices. The mango agua fresca at Queso Good was too sweet for me but my date liked it. The friends we were with said the waffle truck is amazing, so we'll have to go back to try that!  There was soft live music, making for a relaxed vibe for a casual night out. I think there could be more tables and seating, and unless I missed it, alcohol would be a nice touch."}
{"text":"We missed going to this event for Saturday night dinner. It had been a couple months. We get our food, patronizing 4 different trucks, and try to find a seat. Every table says \"reserved\" -hum- this is new. A couple at one of the tables said they just sat down since they had no choice either. We did the same. As we are finishing, a woman stating she is the coordinator of the event approached us to ask if we paid $20 to sit at the tables. Of course we were incredulous that people would go to the food trucks then have no place to sit to eat. What fools are giving this woman $20 to sit at her Costco tables? Are people now being required to pay to sit at a street food fair? What is going on? So we said no- then she asked us all to leave. Keeping in mind my little boy was still eating his ice cream. If this is the new style of food-trucking- why not just go to a restaurant? What kind of person is this? The food truck operators at this event should consider moving or finding another \"coordinator\" since this one likes to treat your customers like criminals."}
{"text":"I've heard people say that the Food Truck Caravan is a bit hit or miss depending on the food trucks that come by on the given weekend, however on the occasions we've gone, we've had a pleasant time. I typically head over to their Facebook page to check out their weekly listing of which trucks are going to be there. Some of our favorite trucks are Frites Street, Waffle Love, Flippin Rice, and so on.  The ambiance is pleasant and it's great for a group of people to enjoy since there's always a variety of trucks present. If it's my boyfriend and I who are going together, we will each get dinner from a truck and then get dessert from another one to share. It normally gets really busy but we are still able to snag seats as someone else is getting up.  Minus one star because they always have music there which is way too loud! It's okay to listen to for some time, but then it gets overwhelming and tough to have a conversation with others. If you go late in the evening, the area does get a bit messy and it isn't well lit. We'll still come back to support the food trucks!"}
{"text":"As a lover of all things \"convenient food\" , I stumbled upon this gem. I am a frequent visitor of the caravan on Wednesday afternoons on campus at ASU. This event offers a great change of pace and an atmosphere that makes this one of the most underrated gatherings on Scottsdale Saturday nights.  Yes, the lineup of trucks on any given Saturday night can get predictable but nonetheless, there are always a few pleasant surprises from the live entertainment, art exhibits, and most importantly the food trucks.   Is it worth the drive all by itself? NO. But being in a middle of old town Scottsdale, the scene lends itself to endless possibilities. But if you are a foodie, then this is where you should be Saturdays. Bring lots of cash and empty bellys and you will be sure to leave very satisfied."}
{"text":"Well..it wasn't too crowded at 9pm, but out of the eight vehicles on property, we only had five real food trucks. The Grilled Cheese folks had a food van, the Chinese guys had a nasty trailer with their name scribbled on the side and my choice of food was the food trailer from Sweet Magnolia. At least that trailer looked professional - I'm not sure how Wok n Roll made it past inspection...that one was a roach coach. One truck in the corner was serving two items, another was only ice cream and a burger truck was also on hand and empty. Nobody cleans the tables, so when I sat down, I had to toss aside the disgusting table cloth littered with food particles and eat just on the table.  There is no desert caravan as indicated on the website The area is poorly lit The music is somebody's Ipod and a guitar guy played every 30 minutes You know how there is always somebody happy and peppy outside the trucks on TV inviting you to come over, well this was the opposite. It seemed nobody wanted you to eat at their Trucks..at least at 9pm, but it was open until 10pm Sweet Magnolia had good BBQ brisket, but was skimpy on the portions of meat.  Overall, it may be worth a visit once or twice year, but it could be better."}
{"text":"Overall, the food trucks are hit or miss. You have to try out a few to know which are OK and which are not. I will review a few of the ones that I have tried. I want to start this review by saying that my family and I are not going back to the food truck caravan in Scottsdale and we have been a few times. The biggest issue for me, is that there is no seating. There were available tables but everywhere we sat, a woman ran up and said \"you can't sit here, this seating is reserved\". I don't enjoy standing around trying to eat and juggle a drink, so I would rather just skip it from now on.  Now for the trucks.  I like the nachos offered by the Command Center, really yummy. The salad offered by the Farm Truck is really good and fresh, great ranch dressing and I don't even like ranch. Quesadilla from Queso good, is very tasty. Cupcakes from Frosted Frenzy are very good. We did try the newest truck, Menime's, that offers sweet and savory waffles. I enjoyed the taste of the waffle, which was nice and sweet, though the waffle itself was not at all crispy, which was disappointing. Also, tried their chicken wings. Did not enjoy them at all, they were heavily floured and deep fried. They have a pretty pronounced sweet flavor and worst of all, the wings were undercooked at the bone. The wings and the waffle were drizzled with a red sauce, which was a surprised as it was not at all described on the menu. I would have preferred the dish more without the sauce, especially I would have preferred that they not put the sauce on the waffle, because I had to eat around the sauce which meant I did not get to eat the majority of the waffle. All in all, it was $11 down the drain as I had to throw the whole thing away. Can't eat bloody chicken."}
{"text":"Hired Food Truck Caravan to cater a wedding rehearsal dinner, casual party inside/outside for over 40.  Many menu options to pick from, and coordinating schedules and contingencies was a breeze.  Lori did an awesome job putting things all together.  Our guests were blown away by the type and variety of food, and the novel idea of being served from the truck.  They set up an attractive serving area for appetizers indoors, and then dinner was served from the truck.  Desserts were served inside so nice flow for our guests. Many positive comments about the food and the novel approach.   Totally recommended for you party or event, Thanks Lori and team."}
{"text":"Awesome! Second time at the caravan and love the quality and the variety! Our problem is choosing! Had the hot link and peach cobbler from Magnolia Smokehouse today and loved it all.  Oh, and great live music! Come on down!"}
{"text":"Lori was awesome, had our table ready and great service. Queso truck was fabulous, our 2nd time eating there, portions were big, Jose went out of his way to give great service and make sure we were happy w our food"}
{"text":"Great ambiance and a great food assortment. The decor was awesome and the \"live\" music is just the perfect touch to the night!  Rain or shine this is an awesome area for the food trucks to park. The lighters make the surroundings perfect looking good for the patrons to feel comfortable. The night lights were great! Sierra, Tyler and Lori have done a great job with the stop making this a great stop for Truckers and their customers!"}
{"text":"This is my second time coming and my experience was a little better. Very nice environment, relaxed. Some of the food was so-so, I won't name specifics, but I wasn't wowed. Would go again because the trucks change all the time, so it wasn't horrible I wi just be more selective about what I will buy next time, and I will bring a chair. There is no seating, which I understand because of the setting, but it would be nice to have a table to sit at versus having to bring a chair."}
{"text":"The food trucks are there to provide a variety of food while listening to the nearby live music along the canal. NO restrooms, though so you have to cross a busy street and use the facilities in a nearby restaurant. Average meals cost $10."}
{"text":"This was fun to go too, definitely ended up spending a lot of money to try out lots of food trucks I haven't been to before.  They have live music and places to sit. Its a fun night out with a group of friends. Especially if you can't decide where to eat, everyone gets what they want."}
{"text":"Every Saturday, weather permitting, the Food Truck Caravan gathers with 10 or so trucks. The event starts at 6:30pm and goes until 9 or so. Plenty of tables are available but usually there isn't enough seating. I know you can reserve a table, but I'm not 100% sure how to go about this and this usually means anywhere from 3 - 6 tables are empty because of the reservations. Thus, even less seating. Some folks sit on curbs or take the food to go. This is the only frustrating part of the entire experience. When attending, I'd recommend going early as to get a table or have to lurk/fight over seating as it gets later in the night.   Overall, it's a great way to experience new foods/trucks. It is conveniently located with plenty of parking nearby. I'd highly recommend checking it out!"}
{"text":"This review is for the event, not the trucks.  We love the trucks!!    We stopped by the FTC the other Saturday to grab some viddles.  They start around 7:30, so the heat of the day has already started to die off a little bit.  Still warm out though.  Thankfully, they have misting stations up, which helps a little bit.  Hopefully, when the weather cools off a bit and the sun starts to set earlier in the next month or two, they'll change the event time to earlier in the evening..say starting at 5pm.  Only makes sense, right?    The Saturday we went, it was pretty crowded.  We were afraid we wouldn't be able to find a seat for the 3 of us.  Thankfully, we were able to squeeze in at a table.   So HEADS UP to the coordinators, more tables/seating please!!  Not everyone just eats and skedaddles.  People stick around.  I mean, this weekly event is meant to be a gathering of people to come eat and socialize, right?  Otherwise, whats the point in having a band?      We'll give it another try since it is right in our backyard.  But I think we'll have our camping table and chairs handy..just in case we cant find seating."}
{"text":"I love everything food trucks and live music  Tonight FTC was excellent...   There were about 8 different food trucks each with great meal options as well as dessert options  The ambience was great because everyone was friendly and very nice... I could not make up my mind on what to eat tonight so I visited each and every truck to look at the options as well as meet the people in the truck... Each truck was great! Very good attitudes and very helpful customer service I really enjoy that about food trucks- you learn in-depth about the products and you learn about the people behind the food..  Finally I made up my mind and went with the pizza truck, Saffron Jak... The guy that helped me was very down to earth and pretty much woo'd me into the pizza... I went with the Mr. Hand pizza... It was covered with ham & pineapple... The crust was thin and interesting because it was like a sesame seed thin crust...  The size of the pizza was perfect for my petite frame haha but I'm sure 2 people could share one...  The pizza was about $8.50 and I really don't mind the price because I feel like I am paying for the ambience, the history of the food truck and the food, and the great pizza...   I was very happy to see that there was seating provided during this event as well.. We will be back soon..."}
{"text":"First time here and disappointed. Only 5 trucks and nowhere to sit . Got a burger at Aioli Burgers.. Very good but would have been nice to get some fries or chips or anything else here. The music is a nice touch but way too loud. Bring some chairs or else you will need to do what we did , eat in our car. Finished our burgers and when to Old Town for a beer and dessert. Oh well, can say we tried it."}
{"text":"Anyone who knows me knows that I love me some food trucks. I frequent the down town food truck caravan, but since I've started working in Scottsdale on the weekends I have been driving past this set up just waiting to give it a shot. I was not let down. A good number of food trucks, some I have had and loved and some I had not yet tried. It was hard to make a choice.  I went with some bar-b-q and creme brulee.  So good. And this set up is nice. Parking is not impossible, and they really let you know your in scottsdale.  They set up an eating area with a Moroccan theme.  Tapestries hanging, pillows ont he floor, colored glass lanterns on every table.  They really pulled out all the stops.  Very well done!"}
{"text":"Tonight was about the 8th time I've visited food truck caravan. The trucks vary every week & some weeks have more trucks than others. Tonight we made a reservation and would definitely suggest doing so. Unfortunately, not everyone understood the reservation concept, but the gal running the concierge table handled it all well. Tonight my group tried Charred Pizza AZ, Modern Tortilla, Ragin Cajun, indah Sushi, and Ice Cream Love AZ. Everyone loved their food  Thanks ladies for putting together a wonderful time!"}
{"text":"I was looking for fun things to do with friends we travel with-what a find.  The food was amazing there were eight of us and we all tried different food. We had 2 kinds of lobster rolls from the LobsterLady from Maine both were fantastic. We had food from the Kogi truck the chicken curry and short rib tacos were fantastic. We had the Rich poor boy (shrimp & catfish) from Buzz and Bees truck which was the killer best.  We got tacos from The Herald truck which we're amazing.  The Greek salad from the Extra Virgin truck was great.  The music was great. I spoke to Lori Baker the person who puts this together every week and told her we had a great time - she is amazing.  Oh I almost forgot we also had the hand dipped ice cream cones from the Ranch Burger truck which was a great finishing touch.  What a find when we come next year this will definitely be a repeat."}
{"text":"Woah Nelly!  What a surprise. Come hungry!   A friend suggested this as a Saturday night field trip. So off I went to Scottsdale. I was a little bit worried about parking. There is a lot right where the event is held. But if I were you I wouldn't expect to park there. (It was full around 8pm) There were some folks who parked in the dirt area (which is unmarked) and I only realized this afterwards. D'oh! I parked in regular street parking.   Walked on over and was happy to hear music! There was a band playing. I was earlier than my friend and had some time to kill. Music is always a good thing. Later in the eve I started to pay more attention to what they were playing..but honestly all of it was great!  Just as a side note... This event is held at dusk and carries into the night. So heat isn't really an issue. And they have a misting station! The kids loved that area! There is plenty of picnic bench style seating for everyone. It's really neat in that folks really talk to each other (as no one really has a private table).  I stopped at the back for my sweets (gotta make time for that!) and then meandered around. There was a richness to choose from for main bites. I wish I had come hungrier.   Hoh Man I wish I had come Hangry. You know that feeling when you're so hungry you eat more than you actually have room for? Yea, that would have been good in this case.   I studiously wrote down the name of the trucks I gorged myself at. Why? So I could hunt them down around town. GOOD STUFF! And I'm hoping they'll be here next week. 'Cause I want to come again :)"}
{"text":"Love it! They were really nice and allowed me to take some items of my food due to allergies."}
{"text":"I love Food Truck Caravan, I actually went the very first night it opened and a couple other times just never checked in!  Its awesome to have all the different choices of different trucks and cuisines!"}
{"text":"Grilled Addiction - oh Yuck! I paid 14.00 for 3 greasy, overcooked, UNseasoned, fatty, fatty lamb chops on a bed of salad greens than wilted from the temp of the chops. A squirt of aioli mayo (or whatever it was) did not have a prayer to save this dish. It was by far, the BEST and BIGGEST looking truck on the lot but geez, hire a COOK, will ya? Bleh. I will keep these boots awalking right past you next time."}
