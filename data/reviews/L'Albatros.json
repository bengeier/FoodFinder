{"text":"Service was great, and the food was tasty, but I had an experience that left a bad taste in my mouth. My bill came out to $23 and some change, and I paid cash with two $20 bills. When the server came to take my payment, he asked if I wanted change.... really. Sorry, bud, it was good, but not tipping 75% good. Then, when he brings me my change, he kept the coins for himself and gave me only the bills. If this is customary at upscale restaurants (or those that are trying to be) then I'm not \"A-OK\" with that, and that's why I'm giving L'Albatros a 2-star rating. I wasn't going to make a scene over 70 cents in front of my party, but I needed to share this experience so others are aware."}
{"text":"A patio favorite. Best cheese board and wine options in University Circle. A favorite after trips to the museum or before the orchestra. The vegetarian cassoulet is always outstanding."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best restaurants in Cleveland, went there last night with my fiancée and she absolutely loved it as well. The ambiance is quaint and perfect , service was excellent ,the server was confident in knowledge of the menu and made recommendations like she knew the menu in and out. Food was fantastic , bottle of wine delicious , I guest what more could you ask for.... Definitely going back and Certainly recommend L'Albatros as a must visit."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by my meal at L'Albatros.  It's housed in a very unremarkable house-like building off Bellflower in University Circle, but one of the first things that caught me was the modern decor inside.

I had heard about this place for some time and rumor had it that it was over-priced French food, but I found it quite reasonably priced. And I think before wine, we paid about $40 each for an appetizer and main course.  We shared dessert.

We went there with a group of six friends to celebrate a special occasion.  The staff was very friendly and amenable, but the service overall was pretty slow.  For the time being, I'm going to write the slow service off to the fact that they were very busy.

We started out with some appetizers to share.  The most remarkable was the sweetbreads over arugula & mushroom reductuion.  Cleveland isn't a city with a lot of French cuisine, and this may be the only place that serves sweetbreads; they're not on the menu, but tey were a special for that day, and they were quite good, with a nice crisp breading.  A friend had the onion soup gratinee (AKA French onion soup), which actually included shredded beef in the broth - a nice touch.

I had the roasted cod, with toasted garlic spätzle, sauerkraut, crème fraîche and cornichon mayonnaise.  The fish was very succulent, and the sides accompanied it nicely.

A friend had the sauteed wing of skate, which came with with brown butter, parsley and vinegar.  She felt it was a little bland, but I thought it tasted good.

Another friend had the duck confit, which was tasty, but not very original, and I actually found it a little dry.  If you've ever had duck confit in the past, it probably was not very different than this one.  It came with a celery root puree, which I didn't care for at all.  I'm not a fan of celery or celeriac.

For dessert we shared the chocolate brownie and the creme fraiche cheesecake.  The chocolate brownie came with with crème anglaise and vanilla bean ice cream, and much like the duck, was pretty much like any warm chocolate brownie with ice cream you've had at any fine dining establishment.

The creme fraiche cheesecake, though, was quite good.  It came over fig reduction w/ fig paste & gingersnap crust.  The fig reduction was a nice touch, and while I'm not a huge fan of gingersnaps, they were a nice accompaniment to the creaminess of the cheesecake.  I tasted the fig paste, but it wasn't really my style, as in general , I don't care to eat figs.

On a scale of 1-10, with 10 being perfect, I'd give the food an 8. My rating of 3-stars is less a reflection of the food, and more my frustration with the slow service.  I also hated their chairs.  They were  flimsy plastic chairs that you might expect to see stacked on someone's patio, and they sort of wobbled as one shifted their weight in the chair.  

Additionally, the place was quite noisy, and you really had to speak up to be heard across the table.  I think the acoustics of the building really aren't equipped to deal with the number of voices that are packed into such a tight space.
Incessant napkin folding

One particular compaint of mine was aestheitc ... when one opened the door to the bathroom, the urinal was visible from the hallway, which means that if one were using the urinal, you were in plain sight of those passing.  That's just poor design in my book.

That said, I'd go again when I'm in the mood for cuisine francaise."}
{"text":"My favorite resturant in cleveland. The service is top notch, the food is delicious. I love getting the the cheese plate and some wine.  The outdoor seating is very nice.
Bottom line. This place hits all the right notes"}
{"text":"Tonight was our first time here and it was the finest dining experience I've had in the past year.  My wife and I shared a bottle of Greek wine, and ordered the grilled salmon and the grilled sausage plate.  Both were excellent.  We had coffee and hot chocolate for dessert.

The food was amazing but what really sets this place apart is the service.  I'm pretty sure I counted 5-6 different people visiting our table, each with a separate responsibility.  Filling water, dolling out more bread and oil, serving food, clearing plates... And all the time our waiter was checking on us also, making sure everything was fine and our wine glasses full.  The manager made sure everything was satisfactory as we left and saw our coat check token.  He went ahead of us and had someone waiting with our coats even before we gave her the token!  Incredible."}
{"text":"Get the cheese! Get the cheese! Get the cheese! I could come here just for that! Otherwise the wine selection is great (obviously a lot of French wines). The salmon and lentil dish I've had was prepared really well. The service could use a smidge of help though- I feel like it could be better or maybe the two servers I've had at different times were having off days. Otherwise it's not just a perfect date spot, it's a perfect any occasion spot!"}
{"text":"Always a favorite. A beautiful restaurant with outstanding food. Always consistent, service. This is a wonderful restaurant from every standpoint--food, atmosphere, service."}
{"text":"We couldn't wait to go to this restaurant since we loved That Place on Bellflower and looked forward to returning to the circle.  The place is beautiful and although some of the sensuous and rustic charm of the former restaurant is gone, it remains a lovely spot for lunch or dinner.  The outdoor patio is divine as was the service but the food we chose was jut ok - not nearly as tasty as the menu described.  Two of us had the stuffed chicken leg which was a very ample portion of leg and thigh meat but the flavors were seriously lacking.  The accompanying spaetzel were fine but there was an odd paprika/salty/bitter after taste to the sauce.  The mussels ordered by another guest were salty and  at the same time bland.  Once the mussels were sent back, they were happily replaced with another entree of pasta which was acceptable but not remarkable at all.  The salads were all good and very fresh.  As much as I wanted this place to be stellar, I must be content with the memories of the former Bellflower instead."}
{"text":"Wow, fabulous food, great service!  All of the staff was gracious and very helpful.  We had the cassoulet and the cod, both were delicious!  Definitely returning!"}
{"text":"On Tuesday night my family and I went out for my birthday dinner.  I had heard great things about this restaurant so I decided to try it.  It's got a great location, the rooms felt comfortably cozy, the patio wasn't open due to weather but the atmosphere was wonderful.  

The service was prompt and professional, our waiter was quite knowledgable about the food and we were never without water and bread.  I was only able to drain my water glass once actually, right before we got up to leave.  

The food was stunning.  We started with oysters and some foie gras.  My dad, who eats oysters fairly frequently, loved them and I really enjoyed the pate, it had a very nice subtle sweetness that was very tasty.  

For my entree I had the roasted cod with spätzle.  It was delicious.  It had a nice texture to it, the softness of the spätzle and sauerkraut complemented the fish.  The tang of the sauerkraut and cornichon was a great counterpoint to the garlic.  I would absolutely order it again.  

For dessert I had the dark chocolate tart with lemon curd.   It was a great finish to a wonderful meal."}
{"text":"A must-visit for me when I'm in town. It reminds me a bit of Lupa in NYC, in that both have lower-priced menus (entrees mostly in the $16 to $20 range), yet both consistently outperform places that charge much more. Aside from the excellent cheese program, which would be notable in any city, the varied menu manages to handle both heavy French classics (like the superb paté) and lighter dishes with equal skill. The reasonable, well-chosen wine list also deserves praise, as does the renovation that turned the dim, tired That Place on Bellflower into the much more sophisticated space that it is now."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best restaurants in Cleveland! I've been here over 20 times and am always impressed with the food and service."}
{"text":"Fine dining with an urban chic atmosphere with white chairs, red brick walls and fabulous jazz music.....lovely culinary experience"}
{"text":"Favorite place to eat in CLE.  Consistent french food and interesting features such as a killer cheese board.  Cassoulet is particularly decadent. Happy hour can be a fun time."}
{"text":"You know, its just a bistro. But a real bistro. Reminded me of my times in Paris. Simple  French food executed very very well. Attentive and educated servers. Properly aged cheeses (now that's a hard thing to come by in this town). Lovely wine selection. 

If you are a real foodie--beyond the trends, the in-places, even the hype that this place itself receives--you appreciate a place that just practices the craft of cookery with an eye for all the small details, which, when properly tended, results in that moment when ingredients find their proper expression. This is such a place. 

And if you are not yet a foodie? This is as good a place to educate your palate as any."}
{"text":"Great. Best meal in Cleveland I've had this far. 

Arugula salad as an appetizer served with shaved Parmesan cheese. Can't really go wrong there as long as the ingredients are fresh, which they were. I had Veal ribs as my main course. Very tender, juicy, and just the right amount of sauce. My gf had the scallops, which were divine. Perfectly cooked with the meat being just the right balance of chewy and raw.

Our waiter, Will, was cordial, knowledgeable, and just a nice guy. I think we could be friends.

The only annoying thing was that parking was 3 dollars... Seems kind of an unnecessary way to extract money from customers."}
{"text":"Great dining experience! As soon as I tasted the savory French toast appetizer (with balsamic drizzle and mushrooms) I knew I was in for a treat.

My dining partners absolutely raved about the french onion soup which made its mark by adding hearty beef to the mix of onion and cheese goodness.

I got the cod on the waiters recommendation and because I was intrigued by its Alsace/German preparation with spätzle. It was so good that I returned the following week for seconds. Those I was with got the trout and thoroughly enjoyed it. I feel confident saying generally that they do their fish really well. 

There is just so much yum packed into this bustling but cozy and dimly lit French restaurant. They also have a lot for parking FYI."}
{"text":"Thrilled there's a place in Cleveland (on the east side, no less) that serves cassoulet. (However, I don't think all the meats they serve with the cassoulet were actually cooked with it. Lots of flavor profiles going on in what they serve; not sure they all mesh. I'm tempted to knock my rating to 3 stars on this point.) Onion soup is magnificent. French toast appetizer thing with mushrooms is divine. If you are salt-sensitive, don't order any of the sausages, pork belly or cured meats. Desserts are wonderful, especially when paired with French press Kona. Should be a Cleveland foodie destination."}
{"text":"I have been to L'Albatros more than any one person should, indulging each time I go and easily spending two hours enjoying every tasty bit! I have a real passion for French foods, and all of their foods are rich and here you feel like you're at home.  The best way to enjoy L'Albatros is when it is packed with people-- not so fun when there is no one there. Try reservations from 6-9 for the best experience. 

Here are some of the foods I've loved:

Cassoulet 

This was recommended to me by my waiter the very first time I visited L'Albatros. By far the best dish on the menu.  This cassoulet is always perfectly seasoned, a great mixture of different meats, and white beans I will actually eat. It is served in a skillet and has a great presentation.

Onion soup

The onion soup is great.  Whole pieces of bread and lots and lots of cheese- exactly as the French would eat it.  The perfect start to any entree.  I would rate this soup a 5/5. 

Duck confit

This is good, but I will be perfectly honest- If you're interested in duck confit, you may as well just order the Cassoulet.  The Cassoulet has the duck confit as well as sausage and lamb.  

Chicken confit

This is the one dish I was mildly disappointed in.  The spices were not as strong as I would like.  Also, the chicken was hard to pull off the bone and could have been cooked a little longer- unlike the duck confit where the meat falls right off the bone. 

Pied de cochon

One of the most interesting dishes L'Albatros has to offer.  This is pigs foot with so much flavor.  They form it into a sausage and serve it with haricots verts.  Once you get over the fear of eating meat from the foot of an animal, you really are surprised at how good it is. 

Cheese assortment

I am often fearful of cheese assortments, so maybe I am biased in reviewing their cheeses.  They offer a great assortment of cheeses from everywhere.  I am somewhat weary of soft cheeses because they do not refrigerate their cheeses.  I typically only order the hard cheeses, however they are very delicious. 

French press coffee- kona blend

A great way to end a great meal.  This french press is enough for two people to have a cup each.  It's comparable in price to a Starbucks coffee but is an experience Starbucks simply cannot duplicate. 

Berries with creme fraiche

We went to L'Albatros with snowflakes flying over our heads.  Our amazement came at how fresh the berries were- even in the dead of winter."}
{"text":"L'Albatros, my beloved L'Albatros! How have I not reviewed you yet?? I am incredulous, appalled, ashamed of myself. In fact, I came here today with the intention of adding a follow-up five-star review to a previous five-star review, but discovered that, to my horror, said review had only been written in my head! So let me try in some small way to rectify my sins. Because, dear reader, L'Albatros doesn't just deserve one or two glowing reviews. They deserve a love note.

We have eaten here perhaps 6 or 7 times now, and, once or twice just for wine and cheese. Every single experience has been exceptional. We now trust L'Albatros with no lesser events than anniversary celebrations and New Year's Eves, and know we could bring even our most demanding out-of-town friends. The food is delicious, creative, and varied; the patio is absolutely lovely (the inside of the restaurant is also handsome, albeit in a more spare way); the cheese tasting is a revelation; and the service is not only the best in town, it is extraordinary by any standards. 

To start with that last item: going out to a meal here is like going to a spa. The wait staff is incredibly knowledgeable, friendly, and attentive; it helps to that they tend to hire adults rather than teenagers, and one has the general sense of intelligence and dedication to craft. Without ever being the slightest bit intrusive, the servers make sure your water glass is always full, bread is on your plate, and the napkin is re-folded if you leave mid-meal for the restroom. The details they remember about your preferences are rather mind-boggling. For example, the last time we had dinner here, a previous fromagier--from a meal we had months prior--dropped by our table to say hello, and asked us how we liked a more recent iteration of a particular cheese that he had served us before. How many customers had he served in the interim? Seriously: these people are the nuclear physicists of waiters. This last visit happened to be for an anniversary, a fact which my fiancé mentioned when he initially made the reservation. And although we wound up having to reschedule that  celebratory dinner (moving it several days forward), the host had nonetheless conveyed the date to the wait staff--for not only our own waiter but several other people wished us a happy anniversary while we were there. Nor did this even feel like a command performance; wishes were conveyed and a friendly and low-key way. Clearly it is management policy to make sure the guests feel recognized; but equally noticeable is that the wait staff performs its duties with such good will that one feels confident about the larger operation.

The several dishes that I have had have all been quite excellent. As a pescetarian, I always appreciate vegetarian and fish dishes being well represented on a menu as they are here. The trout is wonderful with the light almond crust, the Nicoise salad is just perfect, and I have dreams about the scallops. And the cheese plate. Where do you even begin with the cheese plate? The experience of sampling 3 or 5 or 7 cheeses alongside a cocktail or glass of wine is so total that it is almost a pity to eat a meal afterwards. Indeed, to call it \"wine and cheese\" does not begin to convey the wild ride you go on when you dive into the cheeseboard: salty, buttery, caramelized, blue veined, crystallized--from the most delicate sweet cream to the muskiest of barnyards: whatever you could possibly desire in a cheese, you can find here.

At the risk of reaching the point of diminishing returns, I will simply add that I love  their herbaceous cocktails, that the patio is certainly the best on the east side, that the creative selection of small plates allows for tapas-style eating as comfortably as it allows choosing an entrée, and that they clearly want a diverse clientele to be comfortable here. Thank you L'Albatros, for being the best restaurant on this side of town, if not in fact the best restaurant in Cleveland."}
{"text":"L'Albatros is, in my estimation, as close to a perfect dining experience as one can have in Cleveland. I love that it's tucked away in University Circle and not downtown; the menu and wine list complement each other beautifully and are among the best in the city; the staff is often the perfect balance of doting without being over-intrusive; the space is warm and cozy, but still sexy; I could go on.

For years L'Albatros has been my go-to for business lunches, romantic dates, and for a warm and dreamy cordial after a Cleveland Symphony performance. Never, NEVER has it disappointed on any level: quite a feat! Unarguably Bruell's best."}
{"text":"This restaurant was delightful.  The atmosphere was comfortable, lively but not loud.  The service was exceptional.  For instance, every time the bread plate was down to 2 or 3 slices of the excellent crusty but fresh bread, or the water glasses were less than half full, bread or water would discretely become replenished, but at the same time without the overzealous plate clearing that is becoming too common as a pretense for good service.  When the manager asked how everything was, my wife mentioned that her chicken dish was good but had a little too much paprika for her taste. Although she wasn't even hinting at any dissatisfaction warranting a remedy, we were given free desserts."}
{"text":"great ambience. usually go here after Wade Oval Wednesday. The food is tasty, and the presentation is always on point. The wait staff really work as a true team to make your dining experience seamless."}
{"text":"We have stopped here for lunch on a Saturday, made reservations for an evening dinner, and stopped by for drinks while at University Circle....everything has always been delicious!  The service has been fantastic!  We have tried so many items on the menu - love their cheese selection!  Sitting on their patio is so romantic - as is sitting by the fireplace inside.  Good drink and wine selection!"}
{"text":"Nice patio.. overpriced, food was bordering inedible."}
{"text":"We went to L'Albatros for my birthday, and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised to find such a gem in Cleveland!  I was quite impressed, definitely ranks up there as one of my best culinary experiences.

We had 7:00 pm reservations, and upon arrival, we requested to be seated on the outdoor patio.  We had a 10 minute wait until our table was ready, during which we waited outside and were greeted almost immediately with a drink menu.  We ended up not ordering since we were seated so quickly.  We asked to speak to the sommelier, Brandon, for our bottle selection.  He recommended the Chartogne-Taillet, which was quite good for the price.  Turns out Brandon is quite well-traveled and very experienced...we chatted for a while about his training and his experience in NYC with one of the best sommeliers in the world, Aldo Sohm.  We were quite impressed!!

So onto the food.  We ordered a dozen oysters, which were quite fresh with a very nice mignonette.  For salads, I had the frisee salad with lardons and a poached egg.  My husband had the watercress Ceasar.  Mine was delicious.  My husband liked his, but he said he wished he had ordered the frisee.  For entrees, I had the mussles with pommes frites...excellent!  My husband had the pied de cochon.  It is prepared almost sausage-like, and he does not like sausage, so he sent it back for the hangar steak.  Our server was very apologetic that she did not explain the dish better, but it was not her fault...how was she to know he doesn't like sausage.  He was very happy with the hangar steak.

For dessert, he had the warm chocolate brownie (comp'd due to the main course mix up), and I had the three-cheese selection.  Both were amazing...and as we learned from the server who presented my fromage options, Brandon is also the fromagier.

Overall, we were pleasantly surprised to find such a wonderful French establishment for such a reasonable prices.  The most expensive entree on the menu is around $22.  Our bill was just over $220, and more than half of that was on our bottles of champagne.  We can't wait to try Parallax next!!  Great job, Chef Bruell!!"}
{"text":"With all these raving reviews I'm beginning to think that I just went on an \"off\" day.  For starters, the staff was very welcoming and friendly. Our coats were taken at the door which was a nice touch. I know I hate bringing my coat to the table and slinging it over the back of my chair only to wind up on the floor and trampled on. We were promptly taken to our table where our server took our cocktail order. I ordered the lavender martini which I will say was fabulous! Slightly tart, slightly sweet and not overly perfumy like you would expect a lavender drink to be. It even had a special touch with bits of fresh lavender floating atop the cocktail. I wish I could give a 5 star just for that.  After our cocktails I ordered oysters on the half shell. I ordered the oysters on the half shell which were good (it's hard to mess up raw oysters). My significant other ordered the pork rillettes. It was very bland but the pickled cornichons served on the side were delicious! I had ordered a frisée and lardon salad (which happens to be one of my favorite salad combos ever!) My frisée came out lifeless, limp and swimming in a bed of liquid. The vinaigrette was much too oily and I don't really enjoy biting whole peppercorns (although I'm not opposed to freshly cracked pepper). Because the atmosphere of the place is eclectic and unique and the service was great I may give it another chance. As I said they may of been having an \"off\" night."}
{"text":"I've been here about 4 times before with great service, for both lunch and dinner.  This is the first time I've sat at the bar and likely the last time. The bartender, I won't mention her name (maybe it was a bad day- who knows)... was very inattentive. When asked about the pasta of the day, she didn't know the ingredients. Before ordering the vegetable & goat cheese flat bread, we also asked which vegetables would be on it; to which she replied, yellow squash, zucchini, mushrooms- there were no squash or zucchini. It actually also had leeks, tomatoes, artichokes, and a variety of other vegetables. It was fantastic, and I'm not picky, so that was fine- but please PLEASE learn the menu. Someone could have an allergy.

It got worse- after hearing her greet another table COMPLETELY differently than how she greeted us. I believe service to a table should be just like service to guests sitting at a bar. She was giving them recommendations, asked if they preferred sparkling water or flat, thoroughly described a cocktail to them- all of this which was not mentioned to us. Not even recommendations. She asked, \"were you looking for an appetizer or entrees?\" to them, and to us, she'd ask \"are you ready?\".

My friend and I began to wonder why, what was wrong with us? Was it because we were younger? Does she think we're going to be bad tippers because of this? This was seriously the only time I've felt offended at a restaurant. I honestly didn't even think that was possible. And of course I felt like a fool because I've raved about this restaurant to her as being one of my favorites, as she is from Seattle, and likely will never come back. 

So we left a 40% tip, as we usually do and went on with our day. I hope you understand now that your guests can see and hear everything... We aren't bad people, we've both served our YEARS in food and beverage and don't deserve to be treated worse than any other customer. And please if there is a reason, let me know what it is."}
{"text":"Very good! Love the mussels and pomme frittes and trout, would love to see more plant based entrees.
Great atmosphere but I find the chairs rather uncomfortable. Love the hip patio!"}
{"text":"This is one of my three favorite restaurants in Cleveland with one of the others being another Zack Bruell restaurant, Chinato. The guy clearly knows how to do it as I am virtually never disappointed. Like Chinato, the service is top of the line. There are 4-5 servers assisting you throughout dinner so you never have an empty drink or lack of homemade bread. The \"Pork Two Ways\" is phenomenal as the pork belly is perfect. I wish they would serve it with something other than fried cauliflower but I'm sure you could substitute.  Their chicken livers with polenta were the best I've ever had. I've never had anything bad here although I was not blown away by their \"Cassoulet\". Their Escargots was great and was served in a buttery sauce that was perfect in richness and flavor. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"L'Albatros used to be one of my favorite restaurants in Cleveland. My most recent visit was definitely disappointing and did not live up to my previous stellar visits here.

First off, cocktails were great and wine were great. They have an extensive and broad wines by the glass list. 

We started off with the charcuterie board. It was good, just like I remember it being. No complaints except for the fact that it literally took twenty minutes to come out. Why?

We then split the watercress caesar. I don't know what was caesar about this salad. It was watercress with white anchovies, croutons, caper berries, and olives. No shaved parmesan, no creamy traditional caesar dressing. I don't even know what the dressing was. It was disappointing, and extremely salty. Talk about salt overload. The dish name and description were definitely misleading. 

Lastly, we split the pork two ways for our entree: braised pork shank, pork belly, and crispy fried cauliflower. The individual parts were cooked well, but I felt that the dish lacked flavor. It also needed more of the broth/sauce that the dish sat in.

I hope that tonight's visit was a fluke and not the direction that L'Albatros is heading."}
{"text":"restaurants around Cleveland, but L' Albatros has always been my favorite that exceeds expectations during every visit. First of all, the service is the best I have come across. Everyone is kind, quick, and accommodating to anything you may need. The food is so delicious each and every visit. Though a little more pricey than other restaurants, the menu offers a variety of classic French dishes along with modern twists that is definitely worth every cent. One of my favorite is the Cassoulet, which offers braised white beans with lamb, duck confit, pork belly, and sausages, but it is difficult to go wrong at such a great restaurant."}
{"text":"never been  to France don't need to now. proud of u Cleveland!! Zachary B. is the man. pate is soooooo old school but perfectly executed as always. Get your absinthe on plz. if Les Halles is a honkey tonk in Dallas then this is the chefs table at Bath&Body Works with you're college ex. fragrant, floral and frighteningly romantic. Swear the greens were plucked from the hedgerow by the server behind my back they were so pristine. still think snails are pretty much an evolutionary dead end... but wow! luv  ya Manhattan but... not so much"}
{"text":"Quickly becoming our \"go to\" spot.   Lets face it.  As you get older and start having a family you only get so many opportunities to have a night out.  When you do you want to know you are going to get great food, service and a comfortable atmosphere.   They have it in spades here.  Last night we had 2 apps, a few drinks and a main course for under $100.  For food of this caliber its almost unheard of.  We have sampled the entrees and yet to have a bad one.  I would highly recommend starting your meal off with a charcuterie plate or the \"French Toast\".  Both are devine.  The charcuterie plate also forces you to step out of your comfort zone and try unusual things like tureen. 

5 big stars..."}
{"text":"We had a fabulous experience bringing friends from out of town who were thoroughly impressed with the food, wine and service. From the escargot and salads to the duck confit and chicken confit, it was a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Food was spectacular. The escargot was flavorful, the salmon was cooked to perfection and the mussels my girlfriend had have been on my mind since I took a taste. The mushroom soup on special was spectacular, too. My only gripe at L'Albatros is that the service, at times, can be a little over the top. That's not necessarily bad, but it just seemed as if every two seconds someone was putting more bread on our plate or filling our water. It's a little distracting if you're trying to have a conversation with a small group of people. That said, still one of my favorite spots in Cleveland.

Oh, and the maple nut old fashioned was great."}
{"text":"We found the food and service at l'albatros to be outstanding. The somollier arrived just as we were making our wine decision and made an outstanding recommendation. The entire staff worked together to ensure everything was taken care of. We enjoyed our meal here significantly more than at a downtown restaurant where we paid almost twice as much. Would definitely recommend to others and will definitely come back next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Service was exceptional. Our hostess Caroline was a delight. The sommeliers did a great job of suggesting pairings. 

The charcuterie platter was awesome. it came with housemade chicken sausage, chicken liver pate, pork pate, paper thin proscuitto, garlic toast points.

The goat cheese tart was okay. the french toast was okay (i felt it was over hyped).

The servers kept replenishing the breads. 

ended with a chocolate neapolitan, creme caramel.

the restaurant has a super nice feel to it. parking is available in front."}
{"text":"As a French couple, we found this place to be OK. Everyone we asked what their favorite dish was, they said the cheese tray. That is my point, the stuff produced in the kitchen was ok but not great. If you want real French food, try another place."}
{"text":"I was in Cleveland for work, and this was the best meal I had while in town.  

I had the vegetarian cassoulet (even though I do eat meat) and it was rich and I felt like licking the bowl it came in.  It was a filling combinations of beans and vegetables, and the creme fraiche on top absolutely exceeded any vegetarian entree I can ever remember eating.

The atmosphere is lively but the restaurant maintains a calm feeling: with high ceilings, and balanced acoustics  you and your fellow diners continue your conversation at a normal tone.  

Someone else at my table had the Roughly special (Friday night - and also a local fish to Lake Erie) and the one bite I had of her dish was sensational.  Great flavors and a wonderful sauce.  

Our dessert of the lemon tart was refreshing and the whipped cream so light.

I eat out often in New York City, where I live, and I can tell this will be one of the great meals I have all year.  It was that good."}
{"text":"L'Albatros is definitely one of the best restaurants in Cleveland to eat (if not the best).  The atmosphere , service and food are all excellent!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the best meals I've had in a long, long time. Combined with a beautiful back patio and servers that always on top of it, L'Albatros is definitely a must in Cleveland. Save it for a special occasion though, unless your wallet can handle it.

The escargot, and specifically the sauce it came in, was fantastic, and shared among 4 people was just the right amount, although it could easily be for 2. My entree, the duck confit, which came with pureed sweet potato and braised cabbage, not only looked amazing, but was cooked perfectly. What I liked about this place was that while all the dishes (friends also had steak frites and lamb shoulder) were visually pleasing, they were also fair portion sizes; two things that don't always happen together.

For dessert, the chocolate Napoleon is definitely the way to go, a the \"Warm Brownie Sundae\" we also ordered was a little disappointing (very dry, not warm)."}
{"text":"It's a very loud place. The cheese plate selections are amazing. The decor modern with the plastic cheap chair look. I ordered the skate which was good but the braised cabbage not a big fan. The wife ordered veal with risotto the Risotto was under cooked and crunchy they fixed it but I was done with my meal before they came back. Overall wasn't the greatest we had to sit 18 inches away from another couple in the seating arrangement. I won't return."}
{"text":"Duck confit, cassoulet ,and daily special! Nice place, sweet waiters, and good environment! But a bit much oil and salt..."}
{"text":"Went again for the third time,  first time this year. ..and was so disappointed.  The meat was not flavored as well.  I ended up leaving behind half of my main course....apparently they have some new people in the kitchen : (
Dessert was on the house and that was beautiful,  the way I remembered things being previously but it did not quite make up for the main course"}
{"text":"While i had worked for a number of french restaurants in Arizona and LA, We had yet to find a great French restaurant here in NEO. Well, that was until we found L'Albatros. Without a doubt, the best Escargot  I have ever enjoyed. Fantastic wine list. In breadth and depth. Knowledgeable staff and the service was impeccable. Now we DO have a great French restaurant in NEO to go back to time and time again. Exploring this menu and wine list is a treat not to miss. Bon Appetite!"}
{"text":"I love French food but don't treat myself very often.  I'm so glad L'Albatros lived up to all the hype I've heard about it.  Saturday night a few ladies and I went out for a friend's birthday and had a great experience.  I think my favorite part of the dinner was choosing our cheeses from the extensive selection presented to us.  The woman presenting them was enthusiastic, knowledgeable and very helpful.  We also started with Escargot, which I've never tried before and were absolutely delicious.  The garlic and fennel butter sauce was to die for.

I had the Chicken Confit for my entree and it was awesome, very crispy skin and the meat fell off the bones.  Unfortunately by this point I'd eaten what felt like a whole loaf of bread, tons of cheese, and some escargot, so I took half home for later (it reheated all right).  The others tried the Cassoulet, Seared Sea Scallops, and the Veggie Pasta special.  Everything I tried of theirs was also tasty.  The house-made sausage in the Cassoulet was some of the best I've had in Cleveland.

Of course we had to try the desserts, and I'm a sucker for cheesecake so I got the Lemon Cheesecake even though everything looked good.  It was so yummy!  We also tried the Pear and Almond Tart, which I wouldn't usually order but was so warm and flaky.  The pear flavor wasn't overwhelming, which was nice for me and the Burnt Caramel Ice Cream was amazing.  The Chocolate Napoleon was so rich and chocolately I didn't want to keep passing it around!  My least favorite was the Creme Caramel, but I think it's just because I'm not a fan of that texture.  The flavors were great.  We got another thing, I think it might have been the Warm Chocolate Brownie but I'm not sure.  Whatever it was, it was also delicious.

Our service was great, the food was perfect, overall a great experience!"}
{"text":"We are from out of town and wanted to have a nice dining experience in Cleveland, and this was it! This place was excellent, the food was absolutely delicious, the service superb and the ambiance was lovely. Proof of quality was also that the dipping olive oil was at least a \"one cougher\", a sign of good quality. We dined at several spots during our visit to Cleveland, and this restaurant was our favorite."}
{"text":"Kendra was the best bartender! She took my requests and made me the best made to please cocktails that I could have ever expected! I stayed to drink even after I expected because the drinks were so good and she was so friendly. I highly recommend this place based on how exceptionally personalized our service was and the lovely atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I only ate here once during a recent business trip, but it was excellent overall. An ideal spot for lunch, and I'm sure that dinner is warm and romantic. 

I had the soup du jour which was a chilled cauliflower and it was good, not great. My main was the roasted cod and I cannot recommend it more highly. The fish was cooked perfectly and the spätzle was an ideal accompaniment. 

The staff was friendly and efficient. I only wish I could return to try other menu items since so many looked good."}
{"text":"One of the most exquisite places in town. Exquisite is the food, prices are reasonable, and ambience is welcoming. It has a cozy feel and fresh decor. The cheese and meat board was so in depth but the gentleman who presented in was so knowledgable and pleasant to talk to. Our waiter Chris was wonderful. Chris made the whole experience. He recommended items and was so attentive. We will definitely be back sooner rather than later. They are simply amazing."}
{"text":"Clearly to go-to spot for Case Western academic expense accounts, L'Albatros is deceptively wee from the outside and slightly disorienting on the cozy interior, as the entry is next to the open kitchen and the main dining room is through a room to another room.  Nevermind, this thoroughly French bistro is a welcome retreat from the snowy Cleveland winter.  True French bistros are hard to come by in the Midwest and if you are like us, you will appreciate the kitchen's inventive and especially fresh greens.  Portions are large, especially the hearty cassoulet which can easily serve two.  Although we didn't order it, the table behind us was swooning over the Assiette de Fromages."}
{"text":"Very personable and knowable staff. The roasted Cod with spatzle is a delicious dish. Also their patio is great in the summer!"}
{"text":"I really like L'Albatros....I think this is something that Cleveland was missing, a good semi-casual French Bistro.  Been there twice now and tried the steak frites, which was good, steak was cooked well, and fries were good, but not as thin as I like them.  Second time I did the Mussels and fries, and these were excellent.  Also if you go, you have to get a cheese selection from Brandon the fromagier......it was so worth it.   I will continue to go back.  The  first time we went our server was fabulous, she was very attentive and very nice, second time our waiter was a little slow.  We walked in without a reservation the first time (only 2) and the hostess was very accomadating, however the bar area is a little small if you did have a long wait.  Overall, I will be returning, cant wait for the summer, it looks like they have a great back patio!"}
{"text":"Can't say my experience there yesterday (Mother's Day) was a good one. First, even though we've had reservations for weeks and the place was rather empty, we were seated in the back dining area, and I was surprised by the white plastic lawn chairs and tables on top of one another. A very ugly, too-bright  dining room.  I had always been in the main dining area, pretty and comfortable. This got my experience off to a bad start. Second, I ordered the scallops as my entree, and I have to say that they were ill prepared. The noodles were decidedly undercooked, and the sauce, that I remember liking so much the last time I had this dish, was more soup than sauce. The scallops were so drowning in this soup that I couldn't even find them at first. Yuck. And, as many of you pointed out that the menu hasn't changed in a long time, could they at least give you CLEAN menus that aren't so torn up that you have a hard time reading them? Really, are 1-page paper menus that expensive? I did enjoy the French toast appetizer, however, but  I think I'll give this place a long rest before returning."}
{"text":"For months my boyfriend has been talking about wanting to try L'albatros and I figured there was no better time then to treat him for his birthday.  One side note before I start rambling, it's $3.00 to park in the lot - I believe they have a machine that takes credit cards in the lot, but better to have cash on hand (luckily we had exactly 3 bucks because I wasn't in the mood for walking any kind of distance in the shoes I was sporting).  

Ok, so let me begin.  The vibe starts even before you walk in - the entrance is mysterious and it's almost like it lures you in and it's a great prequel to what's waiting inside.  Once you enter, you're greeted with contemporary awesomeness - tables and chairs are white, the art is loud  yet kept to a pleasant minimum and the very dim lighting really sets the mood.

We arrived about 15 minutes early for our reservation (I would suggest making one because even on a Tuesday night at 8:00 and on the place was completely full).  We figured we could grab a drink at the bar if we couldn't be seated, but much to our surprise and liking they were able to put us at our table.  When I made the reservations on open table I had mentioned that this was my boyfriend's birthday and that he had been dying to eat here so I was hoping they could give me one of the better tables or patio seating (weather permitting).  Well, I'm pretty sure a genie was reading that reservation request because all wishes were granted!  The weather was VERY questionable that night so instead of seating us on the patio we were escorted to a small two person table in the back room (or the one that's not ALL white) directly next to a full sliding glass door with a total view of the patio next to us.  The lighting was dim and sexy, the exposed brick and dark walls gave a rustic homey feel to the setting - it was absolutely perfect!

We were started with bread and olive oil, which was delicious and never stops coming throughout your meal - at one point we both had to just say no because I believe I ate about half a loaf of bread before our cheese platter even came!  We both ordered signature drinks (Manhattan for him, Effen herbs and berries for me - both DELICIOUS!) and decided to start out with the 5 cheese plate.  A fromagier comes to your table with a HUGE board of cheeses to choose from and she was very informative and descriptive.  I will say, this is a great choice - I definitely recommend it - but it's VERY filling.  My one peeve was that we waited a LONG time for our entrees to arrive but now that I think of it, I think it was planned on purpose to let our palletes relax and to make room for the food we ordered.

Our entrees came and OMG!!  I got the nightly special - oxtail ravioli - and my bf had the cassoulet.  Both were out of this world.  The flavors just exploded in your mouth and each entree had so many different components and levels of flavor that the meal from start to finish was absolutely wonderful and exciting.  Lastly, we ordered dessert - frozen blood orange & grand marnier souffle - which to our surprise and delight came out with a candle on top!  I thought it was so awesome that they had remembered that it was our party celebrating a birthday - talk about attention to detail!

This honestly was one of the best meals and service I've experienced in a LONG time and couldn't recommend it more (trust me, this is the short version of this review - i figured I'd spare you the rest of your day)!  It's pricey, but totally worth it and if you're looking for a romantic restaurant for date night, then L'albatros is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Fiance and I went here for an early dinner last month. Let me tell you, that was some of the best French cuisine I've had since I left Paris... and where the hell else are you going to get a beverage, appetizers, entrees, and dessert for $50 that is this wonderful? Nowhere! It also deserves to be mentioned that the atmosphere is very intriguing. Brick walls, white tables and chairs, big glass door/windows to the backyard area.. rustic and modern, with a giant mural over the fireplace. Loved it. :)"}
{"text":"As good as it gets, and one of my favorite restaurants in Cleveland. Amazing wine list, great food. I've always had great experiences there in the summer on the patio - the great food alongside the nice ambiance sets this restaurant apart from other places in the area."}
{"text":"We ate a chocolate Napoleon. Ethereal, light and crisp. Every dish we tried was properly prepared. There is a full selection of interesting beverages. Servers are well versed. I've got to say we liked it and want to return. It seemed like they had a pre-Orchestra crowd the night we were there."}
{"text":"Celebrated my birthday dinner here and was really looking forward to a special evening. Unfortunately the service was mediocre, the Beef Bourguignon was salty and the brownie we ordered for dessert was dry and crumbly. Save your money."}
{"text":"Everything was amazing. The service was the best I have ever experienced. It's a must try in CLE."}
{"text":"Charcuterie board was amazing. Service and atmosphere was great. As well as the duck confit."}
{"text":"OMG, this restaurant is amazing. My husband and I were blown away by the food, the service, the ambiance ... everything. I had braised leeks for an appetizer; husband had a finely shredded pork that you spread onto crackers, with pickled caper berriers. Am-ah-zing. Then I had duck confit for dinner ... so tasty and tender. Husband had hanger steak with bernaise sauce. We both ate every scrap. I had a lemon/lavender cocktail and a glass of Pinot. He had a beer.

So three drinks, two appetizers, and two entrees = $88. I was amazed. I expected the bill to be about $120 based on the quality. 

To put the icing on the cake, I got cold because we were sitting on the patio ... so the waiter brought me a chef's jacket from the kitchen! 

We couldn't have had a better experience here, in every way."}
{"text":"This Restaurant is truly divine. Their unique French food is so wonderful to see in Cleveland. The servers are well educated on their menu, drinks, and very friendly. I will definitely be back in the future!"}
{"text":"They should have a self serve counter ! 
One may argue that the food is good. 
Besides that this place has just about the worst service possible."}
{"text":"I visit from California every month, and I make it my purpose to stop every single time. 

I have tried every single dish in the menu and they are delicious! My favorites are the Cassoulet and the Almond Trout!  

The wine selection is very fitting (as are the beers). 

The service is consistently impeccable and they will accommodate your requests! 

Overall, this is a place you will come back to, again and again! 

Worth every penny!"}
{"text":"Overpriced and tasteless....they should be ashamed to call themselves a French restaurant.

Really disgusting. Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"L'Albatros has 5-star potential, but fell short on my first impromptu visit (though I plan to return).

The opening courses were very good.  My wife had the butternut squash soup, which was excellent though short of transcendent.  She also had the mixed greens salad, whose freshness was a pleasant surprise in December.  I had the onion soup, which seemed just above-average at first, but developed into excellence as I uncovered more of the submerged flavors, particularly the (braised?) beef buried within.  I followed the soup with the \"French toast,\" which was a delightful combination of perfectly pan-toasted bread, wild mushrooms, and a balsamic reduction -- a unique dish that I had never seen before.  So far, so good.

The experience lost steam at the main course, at least for me.  I ordered the choucroute garni, a combination of sauerkraut, pork chop, sausage, pork belly, and root vegetables.  Texturally, all was cooked perfectly.  However, the meats were all oversalted -- and I am not shy when it comes to salt.  The dish was still edible, but bordered on unpleasant to eat.

My wife had the cassoulet, which had many similarities to my dish, but did not suffer from the abundance of salinity.  However, she indicated that she would be unlikely to order it again on future visits.

For dessert, we had the frozen lemon \"soufflé\" and a French-pressed Kona.  The coffee was absolute perfection -- velvety, syrupy, and complex, with a cocoa-powder finish on the tongue.  The serving was easily large enough to split between two, with coffee to spare.  

The lemon soufflé was good, but not mindblowing.  I'll withhold judgment on the overall quality of the pastry chef until I sample more desserts.

The atmosphere and decor were excellent -- probably merits a bit of dressing up, though they didn't ostracize me for jeans and sneakers (it was an unplanned post-museum visit).  The pricing seemed appropriate for the food and experience.  The team-based service approach was very attentive without being overbearing.  As a side note, it appeared that some sort of physical-fitness test must have been required to be a waiter."}
{"text":"We have heard great reviews about this place.  And it deserves all the praise.  There aren't many places in Cleveland which serve modern cuisine and those which claim to do so usually present lackluster dishes.  This place likes to have fun with it's classic French comfort food.  And the service was fast, friendly and warm but not overbearing.  The charcuterie plate was delicious and simple.  They presented cured meats and pate so creamy.  As for entrees, the mussels with pomme frites rivals a similar dish served at a famous NYC brasserie in the meat packing district.  The flavors were clean and tasty.  The ingredients were not muddled with too much seasoning.  The duck confit was also really stellar.  The duck was so satisfying.  You can tell the chef took great care not to overwork the duck in the cooking.  The sweet potatoes puree and red cabbage complemented the duck so perfectly.  I couldn't get enough of it.  They serve dishes like this at places like Ortolan in LA but L'albatros does it with really really reasonable prices.  We finished off with the blood orange frozen souflee and espressos.  It was great but the apps and entrees are where this restaurant shines."}
{"text":"This is a very trendy restaurant, sophisticated diners yet still in a comfortable setting. 

We started off with oysters and the escargot, all very delicious and oysters were very fresh. For the dinner I had the Cassoulet and my date had the hanger steak and frites, the Cassoulet was very interesting served in a stainless steal pan with duck confit, pork, and sausage. I was a bit worried about the white beans at first, not a bean fan, but the concoction came together very well. Only negative was that the duck was a bit salty and not enough carbs to help absorb that taste. The steak frites were done well, but I've had better at Lola. To finish we had the warm chocolate brownie with vanilla ice cream, very rich and dense. 

Overall it was a pretty good meal, only downside was the over salted duck and the wait staff seemed a bit new (not knowing how to clear plates, not giving enough time to order, etc). But it's a welcomed restaurant into the Cleveland scene, worth checking out at least once if not more."}
{"text":"French food, I'm a fan.  We arrived on time for our 4 person reservation.  The table was not ready due to some lingering patrons.  No problem, we hung out at the bar in this modernly decorated restaurant.  The table was about 15 minutes late and we were comped a free appetizer for our hassle.  Our waiter was attentive.  There are waiters that are managed by the table and there are waiters that manage the table.  Ours was the latter, which is a much better experience.  He knew the food to a T, and his wine recommendation was spot on.  I had the cassoulet, seasoned just right, I ate it all.  fantastic.  Would go again.  Perhaps this place is not as good as Chez Francois in Vermillion for French food, but its tops in Cleveland."}
{"text":"We had an early dinner and were sat at a little table right next to the fireplace. Anthony started with the potato soup, which was quite comforting. I thoroughly enjoyed the duck confit while he chose the  veal spare ribs. Following our entrees we shared a Meyer lemon tart and some impressive espresso. We were also served complimentary glasses of champagne since we were celebrating! The service, along with the aesthetically pleasing environment, rounded out our experience. It was lovely."}
{"text":"One of the BEST pork dishes I've ever had.

The Pork Two Ways is fantastic.  The pork shank is set up and braised overnight for over ten hours, and the results are outstanding.  Savoury, impeccably tender, this pork shank made me take notice on the very first bite.

The pork belly adds a great textural contrast, with the crisp skin overlying more tender fattiness below.  One might find the pork belly quite intensely salty on its own, but it pairs up beautifully with the pickled red onion on the side.

An un-advertised but superbly delicious part of the dish was the panko-covered deep fried cauliflower.  Everything about this side was balanced, without any sense of over-breading or greasiness and letting the cauliflower just taste amazing.

The frisee and bacon lardons with poached egg salad was a nice way to start, although be prepared for a vinegar and mustard dressing that definitely leans more on the heavily acid side of things, but will balance nicely with the fattiness of the lardons and egg yolk.

The only disappointment was that pear and almond tart was served to me partially burnt and quite dry throughout, but they quickly offered to replace my dessert without hesitation.  Too bad the caramel ice cream was so good that I had already polished that off first and was too full for a second dessert by then.  Next time!"}
{"text":"Food is grea, bt service is slow. Everything on the menu is delicious...so it makes up for the wait."}
{"text":"I think we ordered wrong maybe?  Also, having to pay for parking in an attached lot with ample space is a little ridiculous for this area of the city. The wine was a great deal, however the food was just OK. Service was reasonable."}
{"text":"A few years ago, wife and I decided to take our three teenage boys on a road trip to Cleveland (from Pittsburgh) to visit the various museums near Case Western.  An unexpected highlight of the trip was the delicious food at L'Albatros.  In fact, we enjoyed our lunch so much on the first day of our trip that we immediately made a reservation for lunch the next day.  We have gone back to visit the museums each year, and a major draw for all of us is eating at L'Albatros.  I especially enjoy the Grilled Tiger Shimp pasta (in a Pernod cream sauce), and two of our boys always get the Bianco pizza (which is also very tasty).  The desserts are also quite memorable.  The ambience in the restaurant is very pleasant: we especially like to sit near the fireplace."}
{"text":"Had great recommendations for this restaurant, but unfortunately the service was terrible when we went and ruined the experience. It started from when we sat down and took several minutes to even be greeted or given water. Our server was pretty on top of our drinks and ordering, but it went down hill from there. We were given our food and checked in on maybe 1 min later-haven't even gotten to everything to know if it was ok! I wanted more sauce for my meat and our waiter was MIA for 10 min, not wanting my food to go cold I asked the busboy who happily obliged. My husband finished faster and while I was still eating the rest of my food we were asked 3 separate times in 5 min to clear our plates-including by the manager. I was taking my time finishing as my husband had ordered another drink. Finally finished and no one could be bothered to clear our table then, waiter forgot our drink and at this point we had been sitting for a while waiting for anything to happen. Busboy finally cleared the table and brought us dessert menus. I wanted to order dessert, our waiter finally brought husbands drink and apologized, said he would be right back. After 10 min we had to ask the manager for our check as we were just done. A couple also asked to switch tables next to us and away from window and were declined as they needed it for a 4 top once we were done. Unfortunately it took so long that they sat another 2 top next to us, should have offered to the couple by the window first as they were flabbergasted as we were leaving about this. Manager needed to be more concerned with level of service rather than seating and getting customers out the door."}
{"text":"Perhaps the best restaurant that Cleveland has.  Great service, solid wine list, great food.  Get the charcuterie platter and goat cheese tart as appetizers and cassoulet for an entree.  Don't eat too much bread before dinner or you will get heartburn like me."}
{"text":"Booked a table for a special celebration.  The oh so friendly parking assistant told us the lot was full and we'd just 'have to wait for a space'. 

30 minutes later, after missing our reservation, and having driven around the local area searching desperately for somewhere to park, we gave up and went somewhere else.

Don't bother unless you have an hour to waste to find a parking space."}
{"text":"Horrible food. So disappointing. $50 for bread. Apps are not even recognizable. My fiancé and I are asking each other what things are."}
{"text":"Let me just start by giving Patricia our server a shout out! She was absolutely fabulous! I went there this past Wednesday for my birthday dinner. I was politely greeted by Patricia with her asking who's birthday it was? When I told her it was mine she very cheerfully wish me a happy birthday. A suggestion for other restaurants this is how it should be done, always make your guests feel special. The meal started off with a fresh bread and butter which was nice. I ordered some kind of gin martini then had cucumber and it and it was very refreshing. My girlfriend that I was with also loved her drink. I asked the server how the French onion soup was because I am a HUGE French onion soup connoisseur. I order it and pretty much every restaurant that has it on their menu. This was hands-down the best French onion soup I've ever had in my entire life! Seriously you must order this soup! The broth is made with braised beef and they actually serve the beef in the bottom of the bowl, which was awesome! The cheese is melted to perfection and I probably could have licked the bowl if it were socially acceptable. For our entrées she had the salmon over lentils which looked amazing, and I had to cassoulet. Now this is the first cassoulet that I've ever had but it was pretty amazing! It was served over navy beans in a rich sauce. A variety of meats were in the cassoulet such as lamb, pork belly, duck, and two different sausages. Definitely amazing and I would order it again in the future. We were so full that we didn't order dessert but Patricia was nice enough to bring a dessert wine for both of us along with a lit candle which I thought was absolutely adorable!!! This was my first time here and I will be back soon! Can't wait to try their patio!"}
{"text":"Great service at the bar. He was knowledgeable and offered a great selection for dinner and dessert. Seating was a little tight but I enjoyed my dining experience. Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great service. I recommend getting the cheese platter because the \"sommolier\" is awesome and the cheese is amazing."}
{"text":"Overall, I was happy with my dining experience here, but there were a few negatives that keep it from a 5 star review.

The biggest positives were the food and the wine list, which are obviously very important.  They have one of my favorite wines, and my chicken breast was delicious.  My boyfriend ordered the special, which he didn't rave about, but said was good.  He also had oysters which he enjoyed.  My coffee after dinner was really good, and it was just plain coffee, so that's a plus.

Service was very good.  I had water and bread almost as soon as I was seated, and my server took my drink order right away while I waited for my boyfriend.  The wine presentation was formal but not crazy.  The servers were friendly.

The downside here is the seating and the parking.  L'Albatros is not exactly in a convenient location.  It is behind a small parking lot on University Circle streets, none of which you can park on and walk from.  So you have to pay at least 3 dollars, 5 if you think you might be there more than 2 hours, to park in the lot.  

I was seated immediately upon arriving, which would normally be a plus, but was awkward because of how close my table was to the one next to it.  The two tops are so close that the man next to me had to move the menu he had placed on the bench so that I could sit down.  As I waited for my boyfriend, I felt that I had to be on my phone (which I normally wouldn't even take out at a nice restaurant) to make the situation less awkward.  I could obviously hear every word my neighbors said, and I didn't want them to feel like I was listening to them.  Additionally, when I ordered a bottle of wine, the wine bucket placed next to the table was protruding into the aisle.  I thought the passing servers were going to knock it over.  

I would probably go here with a group, but not a romantic date.  Even though it is a nice restaurant that could be romantic, the proximity of the 2 person tables to each other ruins that potential.  If it wasn't busy and you could be seated at a larger table it might be nice."}
{"text":"Probably the best restaurant in Cleveland. Awesome service. The staff splits their tips and it shows in their consistent excellence. The cheese board is something to behold. The patio is very well laid out. The menu is unbelievably good with lots of variety and changes often."}
{"text":"Nice secluded location. Comfortable seating with great outdoor option. Service was prompt. Menu items are all good Bistro style selections. Only complaint is that the menu is unchanging with a lack of seasonal variability. There is also a nominal charge for the associated front parking lot though street parking is usually available."}
{"text":"I've eaten at L'Albatros many times -- each time was memorable. Last week we dropped by for a bite with a large group of friends. The endive salad with poached egg and lardons was good as usual. The chicken liver pate with foie gras moussalline was amazing, as always -- a must try. In penance for the pate, I ordered the vegetarian cassoulet. It wasn't nearly as exciting as I had hoped, but then why eat vegetarian at a brasserie? I tasted a friend's coq au vin and it was HEAVENLY. Will order next time (it's the special on Mondays). To finish, the creme brulee was out of this world. 

In the past I have brought my young daughter, who loved it. I have also brought many   friends on a budget. One of the beauties of this place is you can eat very frugally if you go with appetizers and salads. Everything bite is a jewel."}
{"text":"Excellent staff. Have to admit the duck was a little dry last time I went, but I'll be going back again as soon as possible. Beautiful place. We went after the orchestra and were blown away by the staff and the food.  An easy choice if you're looking for somewhere nice to take a date or just have a nice meal."}
{"text":"A hidden gem for the love of food and appreciation of gluttony for the sake of selfish taste bud happiness.  I call it that good good :o)"}
{"text":"Great great service. Fireplace. Great wine list, many by the glass. Excellent cheese cart. Prices very reasonable."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of having a milestone birthday here.
BEST BIRTHDAY DINNER EVER!!
Our table ordered the amazing French Toast,a beautiful cold tomato soup,pasta of the day,veal short ribs and almond crusted trout. Also an order of pommes frittes were sampled by all. 
The service was great...lots if attentive servers and assistants that made sure you had cleared plates,bread,water,bread,clean flatware,did I mention bread?
Everything was perfect,food quality,quantity,temperature and most importantly ....flavor!!
Thanks for a great experience!!"}
{"text":"I had a great meal here with my boyfriend.  The food was delicious (I had the hanger steak, he had the pork two-ways) but the server was slightly off.  First impression walking in the door was perfect.  The host was incredibly friendly, but our server seemed detached."}
{"text":"As a French native I would say that every time I miss French food I can go to this restaurant and get good French food especially the Croque Monsieur to die for and cheeses are amazing too. The wine list is great and Brandon, the manager and fromager/sommelier gives good advices to pick the right wine for your food. Like it!"}
{"text":"If there's one University Circle spot you must visit, make it L'Albatros.

Tucked between Case Western University's Zeta Beta Tau and Alpha Chi Omega Greek houses at 11401 Bellflower Rd., the restaurant boasts a nationally-acclaimed Neo-French Brasserie and Bar. It's one of four impressive establishments launched by Zack Bruell, who was a 2010 James Beard candidate, a coveted award dubbed the Oscar of the food world.

That tiny detail is among many others that make L'Albatros quite distinctive. The restaurant--constructed of two connected carriage houses--was designed by Westlake Reed Leskosky. The intimate, dimly lit red rooms invite you with a fireplace, complemented by Johniene Papandreas' Gathering Storm painting of alluring auburn eyes. The white rooms offer a more extrovert environment with a lounge that summons you to sip \"L'Albatros,\" a mixology of absinthe, mint, seltzer and pineapple and lime juices.

Another distinguishing detail: Brandon Chrostowski. The general manager and sommelier studied at New York City's Culinary Institute of America and has worked alongside some of the world's most recognizable restaurateurs in Paris, NYC and Chicago.

Most of all, the major notable is L'Albatros' undeniably creative offering of contemporary cuisine. Eye le menu for just a few seconds, and your initial reaction is regretful--that you didn't wear looser pants.

Hor-d'oeuvre
My hands-down vote goes to the Goat Cheese Tart with Olives and Sun-Dried Tomatoes ($8). The nice appetite teaser saturates your taste buds with a perfect balance of creamy, salty flavor and concentrated
tartness.

Salad
Arugula and Radicchio with Shaved Parmesan, extra virgin olive oil and lemon juice ($7), a light option that delivers plenty of bite.

Entrée
The entrée list is overwhelming with dozens of lick-the-plate creations--from Braised Leg of Lamb to Confit of Chicken Pizza and Root Vegetable Cassoulet. But it's the Chicken Breast with Caramelized Fennel and Goat Cheese ($16), that's most delicious and a convincing cause for an immediate L'Albatros return.

Dessert
Three words: Warm. Chocolate. Brownie. The dessert ($7), paired with crème anglaise, is even better with burnt caramel ice cream in place of it's usual vanilla bean complement.

After-Dinner Drink
Not referring to the spirits selection, rather the four dark amber French Press brews: Kona, Kenya, Jamaican and Sumatran. The quartet java rainbow might have you doing some St.-Patrick's-style drinking. Yes, all are that good. My pairing vote with the brownie: Kenya, a premiere African coffee with clean flavor, vibrant acidity and hints of ripe berry."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and ambience. I'll regularly bring friends and family here. Great for a late night cocktail on the patio. Love it!"}
{"text":"After looking at the menu in advance and considering all my options (hey, I take my food seriously!), I arrived at the restaurant ready to make a decision. But when I got there, I just got overwhelmed and conflicted again! Everything looked phenomenal! I ended up asking our waiter, Robert, what he recommended. He pointed out the Walleye and Lobster Quenelle, which was recently featured in Esquire. A FAMOUS dish?! How could I go wrong?

Ah-mazing.

oh

my

word

If I'm ever on death row -- or know that I'll be dying in 3 hours, this would be my final meal. The flavors were so incredible! The fish was light and flaky and soaked up the delicious, buttery, savory sauce quite nicely. I wasn't sure what to expect with the lobster quenelle, but it exceeded all of my expectations. For those of you who are tilting your head, wondering what the heck quenelle is, I'll fill you in. \"French quenelles, usually made with pike, are dauntingly rich dumplings that the restaurant makes with lobster meat, egg whites, heavy cream, and herbs, combined in a food processor to form a thick paste.\" These were then cooked like a dumpling and served alongside the fish. So rich and creamy, yet surprisingly light! Out-of-this-world.

Just when we thought we couldn't eat another bite, Brandon, the restaurant manager (I think) stopped by with a treat for the birthday boy at the table.

Heavenly cheese platter.

This cheese was out of this world! I wish I could remember the names of them all, but you are going to have to go to L'Albatros and give it a try -- it'll knock your socks off. Not to mention, the service was outstanding -- these guys know their stuff and are so incredibly helpful -- plus, they didn't turn their noses at me when I couldn't promounce the fancy words! For those of you who aren't lucky enough to live in Cleveland -- this restaurant alone is worthy of a trip -- just make sure you invite me along."}
{"text":"One of the best meals, with some of the best service, I've ever had...and at prices that were very reasonable for what you get: a top-flight meal."}
{"text":"The ambiance of this establishment is fantastic.  However, that said, you can get a \"bad\" table.  The cheese appetizer is an absolute must.  It's not just a dish, it's an experience."}
{"text":"This restaurant makes you feel like you are in LA or NYC or Chicago. The atmosphere is very chic. And the food is AMAZING!! Some would say it is overpriced, but I disagree. This quality of food in any big city would cost close to twice as much as it does in Cleveland.

Recently went to dinner with friends. We had a seafood fest. My friends and I split the oysters. 1 friend had mussels, another had scallops, a 3rd had the Friday special (Walleye) and I had the salmon. The oysters and salmon were great and everyone enjoyed their respective dinners.

For anyone looking for a good seafood place in Cleveland, this place is definitely worth a trip!"}
{"text":"Went once for dinner and enjoyed and went back again and got a whole bunch of apps!! The staff was very friendly, helpful with what we should order! The backyard patio and bar is VERY nice and relaxing!"}
{"text":"I cook all the time at home (yes I cook very well) so it's hard to impress me. With that said me and my GF went here last week. Everything I ordered was on the special for the evening menu. It was a cold onion, fennel soup. The special beet salad with olives & lettuce and pan seared halibut. To make this short and sweet. The soup was good, different but a good change, grade B. The salad was very salty, grade F. The piece halibut was seared wrong. The outside was rubbery looking, not juicy at all. The inside was a little over cooked. It was laid on top of a bed of mashed/cut up potatoes and some kind of sauce (I forget). The sauce saved the entrée. The server asked us if we were doing dessert. I said we're deciding on here or Mitchell's. The server told us go to Mitchell's. Enough said. I gave this place 1 shot. I'm done! PS. How do you mess a salad up?"}
{"text":"Although the menu is quite interesting, the food is WAY over-salted. We have eaten there twice and both times ourfood arrived so over-salted as to be almost inedible. Our party consisted of a young man in his 20's and we are about 60 and we all agreed.  I wish the chefs would salt less and let customers add it to their own taste. The waiter was very nice."}
{"text":"L'Albatros was my dirty little secret for a few years. I attended Case Western, where this restaurant is located, and I could see it from my freshman dorm window. The dining halls at Case would close at 8 PM for dinner, and I'd often get hungry later, so what's a starving budding foodie to do but hop across the street for a quick bite occasionally? Well, these meals became not so occasional, and eventually I had my own regular table and had sampled every item on the menu multiple times. While it was certainly a splurge unwise for one on a meal plan, I loved the atmosphere of the place, the older clientele that made me feel like not a freshman for an hour or two, and the decadent French food. I may have used an alias on my trips there, even taking on a bit of a flirtier older personality. Don't tell Mom and Dad on me.

The building is adorable. It is brick grown with ivy and encasing a charming garden patio. There's multiple rooms so the restaurant feels full of intimate places to have a quiet conversation, and copious windows keep the space feeling light and airy. At night the place does very much feel like a cute candlelit bistro. 

The menu here does not change often (by which I mean it hasn't changed in five years), and unlike many of Zack restaurants, has an obvious theme. It's rustic French cooking, so think cassoulet, sausages with creamy mashed potatoes, a decadent burger, Mussels with pomme frite and Boeuf Bourguignon. I have an emotional bond with many of these dishes, tied to memories of feasting after a good exam, taking parents out during a campus visit, illicit Wednesday night dinners for one, and a graduation feast in the private wine cellar room (a fantastic room for a private party). With the extensive eating I did here through four years of college, I practically majored in the menu at this place. So while I will say all the menu is delicious, and worth ordering, I do have my favorites (in no particular order):

1. I will weep like a baby if they ever take the Goat Cheese Tart with Olives, Sun-Dried Tomatoes and frisée salad ($8) off the menu. This dish is perfect. The texture of the quiche is spot on: creamy, dense, not too eggy and flavorful with olives and zesty tomatoes. The crust is buttery and flaky, and one of the best elements of the dish. There's an olive tapenade and a small salad on the plate that punch through the creaminess with some acidic elements.   

2. Radish and Cucumber salad with red onions and crème fraîche vinaigrette ($8). This salad is wholly unique. The creamy slightly tangy dressing feels light and cooling, and the radishes and cucumbers are pretty and crunchy. The salad is always salted perfectly and portioned for a satisfying appetizer. 

3. \"French Toast\"with ragout of wild mushrooms and balsamic syrup ($9). I remember eating this at my first meal here and realizing with the first bite how special this place was. I'm pretty sure a Chef was drunk, high or both when he came up with the idea to do a savory egg battered bread dish smothered in meltingly creamy mushrooms, a butter based sauce and balsamic. The dish is quite heavy, but incredibly tasty and memorable. 

4. Roasted Cod with spätzle, sauerkraut, crème fraîche and cornichon aioli ($21). Once again, a dish that tastes comforting with a creative twist. I would not have thought to put classic German sausage accompaniments (sauerkraut and mustard seed) with cod, let alone spätzle, but it works amazingly well. This is another heavier dish, but worth the splurge.   

5. The Cheese offerings are serious business around here. Prepared to be schooled in cheeses by a very passionate and dashingly dressed French cheese expert who will guide you through rare and interesting selections. 

6. Finally, the standout dessert is the Crème Caramel ($6). I had a very intense monogamous relationship with this dish for the four years I lived close; I would never eat a meal here without ordering it for dessert; it was that perfect. The dish is simple, with just a perfect dense creamy flan surrounded by deep caramel sauce, a dollop of fresh cream and seasonal berries. Each bite is rich caramel heaven. With all the years I had it, it was never once not on point. 

In conclusion, I love this place. It's a CWRU institution where many professors go to eat, it's a great date spot, a satisfying lunch joint, a peaceful oasis for just a quiet dinner for one. The staff are marvelous and welcoming, the kitchen is incredibly consistent, and fond memories of meals here will warm the cockles of my cold cold heart for years to come. May you thrive for many many years to come, L'Albatros!"}
{"text":"The service is great, the statement about the water in other reviews, totally true and much appreciated!  The cheese tray is fun and a must try for anyone that is even a slight fan of cheese.  They fell a little short with the wine pairing as it was an afterthought and a very expensive glass of house wine.  All of the food was fairly heavy, I know it is a French restaurant but in retrospect I would have been happy with just the cheese tray (we did 5 split between 2 people, each cheese serving is approximately an ounce of cheese) and the French Onion Soup (it was extremely good and not your typical French Onion, it included large chunks of beef!) I ended up taking 3/4 of my dinner home as we were out celebrating my birthday and I was looking forward to Crème Brule.  I was a little disappointed when I learned they don't have serve typical Crème Brule but instead a Carmel Brule, I was however more than pleasantly surprised when they made an exception for my Birthday and brought me a true Crème Brule from their Carmel Brule, it was divine!  All in it was a great experience and I will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal. Dining here is just delicious and rewarding. A solid front runner in the Cleveland food scene, with no pretensions, just a timeless grasp of what good cuisine should be."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem tucked back in from the hustle and bustle of University Circle.  One of the best meals we have had in a long time!  The service was excellent!"}
{"text":"A surprise in the middle of campus. First, I would suggest to visit the nearby art museum and end your trip to this restaurant. The place is cute, cozy without filling you are crushed. The menu has a long list of typical french dishes like duck confit. Do order the cheese platter! A guy will show up with a cart full of cheeses. He will discuss the difference and you will get to enjoy them with figs and honey. I chose the mussels which came with french fries. I would put the fries on the side so they don't get soggy. The trout was great encrusted and accompanied with green beans. They also use vegetables from their own garden."}
{"text":"Insanely affordable prices, wonderful interior decor, and flawless food. I will visit here every time I come back to Cleveland."}
{"text":"Great price for a wonderful night out! I have now been here multiple times and each time the food and service is fantastic. In the many times I have eaten here I have ordered:
-Pork rillettes: delicious with many accompaniments, serving size was large which was a bonus!
-French Toast: the perfect mix of sweet and savory. I have reordered this on multiple occasions. This is certainly a highlight on their menu.
-Arugula and Raddicchio salad
-Cassoulet: very well-rounded flavor
-Chicken Confit: there are many other delicious items on the menu that I would not order this again
-Pork Two-Ways
-Roasted Trout with Almond Crust: delicious! This is very light yet flavorful
-Pistachio Cake: I thought it would be softer and have more of a cake texture, but the texture was similar to corn bread. Still good but would not order again

If you are new to Cleveland or have out of town guests to impress take them here!"}
{"text":"Brought the GF here for a fancy date night, we loved it!  We both live on the west side and thought a it would be a fun little weekend \"getaway\" to spend two days and one night on the east side.  This was our selected Saturday night restaurant :)

There are TONS of other reviews for this place that probably go into extensive, college research level detail... so I'll keep it as quick and brief as I can.

I ordered a beef dish and she ordered a pork dish.  Both were fantastic.  We had oysters as an appetizer that were good... but I've had better.  The waiter seemed new, but was still attentive none the less.  We asked for a wine suggestion and I was happy to see he recommend at $40 bottle of wine rather than one of the $100+ bottles.  We both enjoyed it.

The service was great.  My GF actually lost an earring and after searching around our table I said she could ask the hostess if anyone had given them an earring.  Fortune would have it that someone DID return her earring to the hostess desk!... crisis averted... Saturday night saved!

The overall atmosphere was very trendy.  The restaurant had a lot of character, which I like.  I would come back in a heart beat for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying this is my favorite restaurant. On par or better than most 5 star restaurants I've visited on either coast.

It's hard to pick my favorite dish but some of my favorites are: roasted chicken, duck/chicken confit and the roasted trout - you definitely can't go wrong with anything on the menu.

Also, the burger is amazing if you dine in for lunch. In my opinion, it's much better than anything at B-Spot. 

Try the chicken liver to start and finish with their cheese board for dessert"}
{"text":"AMAZING FOOD!!! This French food was better than anything I ate in Paris. The staff was so professional and helpful. Great for a romantic night out with the love of your life."}
{"text":"I lovedbtge Croque Monseiur...smothered ham & cheese, bechamel sauce, sweet,savory deliciousness... I enjoyed the smoked salmon appetizer...delicate,delicious,devoured prior to photo op. The hostess was very friendly, professional, welcoming. All of the wait staff doted on me, made sure my dining needs were met...My server, Gillian, was friendly and attentive. I really appreciated that.."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic, the service top-notch, the atmosphere so charming.  But the staff, in particular, Kim, makes this a 5 star restaurant.  Without hesitating, she accommodated our party so I could join my friends (last minute) on a very busy Saturday afternoon on the patio.  L'Albatros is the gem of Cleveland."}
{"text":"I took my husband out to L'Albatros for his birthday. I had been to the establishment before it was L'Albatros and was still \"That Place on Bellflower\" so I was interested to see what had been done with the decor. Inside, it was nice; there was definitely a romantic vibe going on. Our waiter was very attentive and took the time to thoroughly explain the menu and answer any questions we had. I'm not too familiar with French food, so I definitely had a lot to ask!

We ended up ordering a bottle of wine on a recommendation of the waiter; it was delicious and went very well with our meals. We started with the 3 Cheese Selection; I was extremely impressed with the huge platter of cheese that came out for us to select from and all the cheese was fabulous. For dinner, I ordered the hanger steak and pomme frites and my husband ordered the chicken confit. Both were outstanding - my steak was cooked to perfection and the fries were the best fries I've ever had in my life. Seriously. For dessert, I ordered the warm chocolate brownie and my husband tried the Napoleon. Again, both were delicious.

Since this was a fancy restaurant, I thought that the plates would be small. I was impressed when the portions were large as it made me feel that I was getting my money's worth.

I would definitely go back to L'Albatros, although it will likely be a \"special occasion restaurant\" for us as it did take a pretty penny out of my social worker pocket!"}
{"text":"Cleveland is lacking in the French cuisine department, but fear not, L'Albatros Brasserie has nailed this fine food. If you aren't familiar with the owner Zack Bruell, well... you should be. He owns several other very high quality establishments (check out Parallax in Tremont for starters).

This restaurant should be in anyone's \"Best of Cleveland\" lists. Take the plunge and you'll be delighted at what you experience.

Personally, my girlfriend and I went here (Aug, 2014) for a nice evening out. We have over 20 years of restaurant experience between us, so we're what you might call \"foodies\".

For starters, we selected the Braised Leeks with Dijon mustard sauce (extremely refreshing, and unfortunately probably often overlooked). I chose the French Toast, which judging by other reviewers comments... is something you.need.to.try! Period. I concur on every level. My girlfriend hates mushrooms and even loved this appetizer.

Afterward we went for the \"Assiete de Fromages\"... which is their cheese connoisseur. We opted for the full-out 7 cheese selection (why would you not?). It was WELL worth it. This guy knows his stuff. I'd compare him to a Sommelier, but in respect to cheese. You hash out the details with him and afterward enjoy your selections. If eating on the patio, beware... the wildlife (read: flies, and bees) will certainly be attracted to the pungent smells of your dairy. 

For our entrees, we got the Duck Confit (amazing!), and Lamb Shoulder (great). I have attached photos of several of our items for your viewing pleasure.

Desserts: Chocolate Napoleon and Almond Cake. Both are great, but if you went with only one... pick the Napoleon. Perfect mixture of taste, texture and presentation. We topped that off with the addition of a dessert wine (the Caddilac Chateau - which was quite sweet).

Beverages: I drank four glasses of a fantastic Malbec (Chateau Ponzac), and she had two Great Lakes on tap. Unfortunately the third beer was not comped as promised by the waiter. He appeared to be newer to the restaurant so I didn't make a fuss over $6, but I did notify the management since they need to be aware.

Overall, this fine purveyor of French cuisine was charming, romantic, perfect for college students to the corporate elite. You can't go wrong dining here and I strongly urge you to give this place not only one visit, but several.

P.S. Reservations are strongly recommended."}
{"text":"This is my favorite lunch spot near work.  It's located in Cleveland's University Circle for those unfamiliar with area.  The food is exceptional as is the service.  This is where I take my most important clients and colleagues.  My regulars include the smoked salmon appetizer and the duck confit.  The duck is perfectly prepared.  There is no other way to describe it. I have also had the grilled tiger shrimp, chicken breast (a friend orders this every time so I had to try it once), and the hamburger.  All were really delicious.   I could easily order those same dishes.  I plan to try the other menu items as well."}
{"text":"A group of friends and I decided on L'Albatros for a birthday dinner on a Saturday evening. The restaurant itself was very cozy, and the patio looked beautiful in the evening. Our meals were amazing and the drinks delicious. There was just one thing really had me scratching my head through out the dinner. As a server that has years of experience working in fine dinning, I was VERY disappointed in our server. It took him about 12 minutes just to come to our table to order drinks. He did not tell us his name, or ask us if we had dined there previously. He did not tell us any specials, and I would say he did absolutely the bare minimum as a waiter. A friend of ours was a vegetarian and she was a bit confused by the menu. He was not helpful to her what so ever, had no suggestions, and was very quick to walk away. At the end of the meal we were all actually much more impressed by the bus boy who poured our water and cleared our plates. He was very on task, very professional, and I would much rather of tipped him for his service. I would go back to L'Albatros just to see if round 2 was different experience, with a different server. The food was great, and because of that I would give it another try."}
{"text":"A great Event diner place. Very knowledgeable and friendly staff, wonderful food, amazing atmosphere. This is a go-to place when a special event comes up, or if I want to celebrate with friends. 
Not the best for families with small children."}
{"text":"My wife and I have enjoyed fine dining in Cleveland for 30 years and this is our new #1 all-time favorite.   The service was way above anything we have experienced with impeccable timing on everything food related and also drink refills, water and even clearing plates once a course was completed.  We each tried different appetizers and entries and shared all because they had their own outstanding flavors.  Our server was exactly correct when she told us that once we had the French Toast appetizer, we'd have to have it every time.  Very unique dish.  Sharing a Napolean at the end was a perfect finish to a terrific culinary event.  Compliments to the entire staff, they are top notch!"}
{"text":"I'd heard a lot about L'Albatros and thought it would be worthwhile to go.  I was shocked walking in how different it looked from the previous restaurant That Place on Bellflower.  I do like the new modern look.  I especially think it's neat to see into the kitchen right as you walk in.

The service was friendly, though our waiter seemed a little out of it.  He had trouble remembering what the specials were and messed up our orders.  However, they were very friendly and attentive, and despite the error, I was impressed.

The food itself is delicious and perfectly crafted.  We had the onion soup, sea scallops, and cassoulet.   Everything was cooked perfectly.  Portions were good as well.

Alright service (would have been great if not for the mistake), good atmosphere, delicious food.  4, almost 5, stars."}
{"text":"Outstanding restaurant. Tremendous food and the service is attentive without being overbearing. The waiters know the menu and make learned recommendations if requested."}
{"text":"If I'm looking for a great experience around Cleveland, I know that I can always find one here. The warm but extremely knowledgable service, creative menu, wonderful cheese selection, and fantastic ambiance keep me coming back for more.  Keep an eye out for their cigar tastings, it's a fun and unique experience."}
{"text":"This place did blow my mind away. I did not expect the experience to be that good. 

Even though this place does not have a dress code, I would highly recommend that you dress somewhat in the business attire or semi casual. 

Services: service was excellent, and this is why i docked 2 points off of their rating, one of my friends did not know about the dress code and he dressed somewhat casual, decent casual not like casual casual, and the waiter gave him looks after looks after looks, dirty, demeaning ones, all night long. Made us feel very uncomfortable. Though, you can count on your water to never go half empty, they keep an eye out on you and take care of you. 

Bar: they have full bar services with some of the very fine and well selected wines. I was pleased with the recommended wine. 

Food: It was beyond good, it was somewhere in between excellent and outstanding. I ordered Duck Confit (confit de canard ) and it was excellently executed, you get two huge duck legs with a bunch of veggies and salad and sweet potatoes or potatoes. It was cooked to perfection, I don't think I have had better confit de canard in the States besides this place. 

Dessert: Very well made as well, it was a nice touch to an excellent evening."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place, and have had dinner here many times since moving to Cleveland.  We've always had wonderful experiences. Unfortunately, this review is for a special occasion fixed menu service they did.  While the food was excellent, we experienced a rather bizarre service kerfuffle.  They required a CC number be left with the hostess when the reservation was made, which I did without an issue.  But into the second course of the meal, the manager came up to our table and rather loudly announced that my card had been 'declined', and that he needed a new one.  I immediately knew that the  hostess and I must have had a communication error over the phone, so I apologized and gave him the same card I had given her.  Of course, it went through just fine.  He then dropped the 'check' as we were still eating our course, saying 'whenever you're ready'.  I left it on the table, since we were still enjoying our meal, but he came back and grabbed it no more than 20 seconds later without saying a word.  We knew he would be back in a few seconds, so we just waited for him to come back and make a joke about him being too eager, before signing it and moving on with our meal.  Then we never saw the manager again.  The whole thing was pretty awkward. I can't help but think that the way we were approached, and the manner in which we were addressed, would have been very different had we not been the youngest couple at the dinner by a few decades.  I worked in restaurant management for years before medical school, and I am shocked that a manager who is, I am sure, very experienced would be so clumsy about the whole situation.  This is particularly true given that it was at a somewhat pricey wine pairing event.  We will be back for normal dinners, but that was the last time we'll eat at one of these events."}
{"text":"I love the food here! Duck confit and the chicken liver appetizer are my favorite dishes!"}
{"text":"Fantastic overall experience. The food was incredible. Would come back just for that reason. Our server was knowledgable, knew the menu extremely well and we so appreciated her recommendations. The overall service was also incredible. Multiple servers to fill water, bring food, clear dishes, and answer questions. The outside seating looked charming as well, excited to come back in the summer. Only complaint if I really try to fish (speaking of fish my GF got the trout and it was awesome) for one, the tables are right on top of each other and I got bumped often as a result. Will come back again for sure!"}
{"text":"It took me years to make it to L'Albatros and I'm not sure why other than the fact that it always seemed a little too swanky for me. 

We walked over here on a Tuesday for some happy hour delights, and boy we were delighted! We sat at the bar and the bartender was super fun and attentive (he even helped me sneak the check payment when my fiance was gone for a minute). Looking at the happy hour menu, we weren't sure what to get. Everything sounded delicious! 

I ended up getting a lavender martini--so tasty; tasted like a spa, but in a good way!--and a grapefruit martini--super grapefruity and not weighed down by sweetener. To begin, we got the mussels. Holy cow, those mussels. The sauce was buttery and perfect and there wasn't one bad mussel in the bunch. We inhaled them and used the fries to soak up more of that juicy saucy brothy goodness. I still think about that dish often. We also tried the goat cheese tart, which was super rich and had a very light, airy, whipped texture to it that I loved. For dessert we had the honey almond cake, which was good, but nothing special if you ask me. I'm not huge into desserts, but I felt like I could have whipped that up on my own. A better dessert would have been the mussels--finish the meal on the great note that we started it on! 

I'll definitely be back and I'll definitely get the mussels again, but hopefully I can bring myself to try all of the other amazing sounding menu items, too."}
{"text":"This was my first experience with French food. I found this place on Yelp and drove 30 mins out of my way to visit while in Cleveland for the night. I'm definitely glad that I made the effort to try this place. 
The ambiance was very romantic, and I could see this being a great date site. My server, Jeff, was attentive, but not intrusive, and it was really great to see the waitstaff working as a team to refill my water, clear my plates, and deliver my dishes timely and smoothly. 
The food was really good as well, the ONLY reason this review is a four and not a five, is because of some personal preferences on the dishes I had. I started with the Onion Soup Gratinée, and although Jeff did warn me that their version is adapted a little with an addition of beef, I decided to give it a try as Onion Soup is one of my favorite dishes. Personally, I would of rather had more onions and less beef, but thats only my preference. For my entrée I had the Duck Confit with braised cabbage and sweet potato puree. This dish was very delicious! The duck was so tender and cooked perfectly, the cabbage was sweet and sour, and the sweet potatoes paired so well with the duck. My suggestion for this dish would be that it be served on a different sized plate. Although the plating was very attractive upon arrival, it quickly became difficult for me to separate bones from the meat and other components that I wanted to eat because the size of the dish was a little on the small side. 
Again, this is ONLY MY PREFERENCE, and shouldn't discourage someone from trying this place. The food and service were top notch. If ever in Cleveland again, I would like to return and try other dishes. Great job!!"}
{"text":"Went here with a big group for a birthday and it was FANTASTIC. The French cuisine was to die for and the service was impeccable. The casoulet is a staple and a must have. Pork two ways was another one of our favorites. The duck was also particularly tasty. Not my first time there and it certainly won't be my last."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: this rating is purely based on service

This was my second time visiting the restaurant. My previous experience was excellent - service and food were excellent. Given that this was my boyfriend's favorite restaurant in the area, we had driven from Akron to have a special birthday dinner here. It had been about 6 months since our visit, but I still feel upset thinking about our terrible experience. Our dining experience started with the waitress given us our menus but keeping conversation to a minimum. She wasn't very friendly and was almost rude to us. It didn't help that we were seated by the windows and the sun was blinding us. Food was good as usual... as dinner went on, we noticed that our waitress was very friendly to surrounding patrons and did not visit our table to ask how we were doing. It seemed like the person who brushed crumbs and refilled our cups were much more attentive. We decide to order a selection of cheeses.. there was a choice of 3, 5, and 7 cheeses to choose from. It came down to 4 that we wanted to try, so we asked if we could do 4 instead of the set 3/5/7 cheeses. Our waitress said yes. She failed to mention that ordering 4 cheeses would be more expensive that ordering 5 cheese. When we went to pay the bill, we pointed out the price discrepancy.. and she tells us that the lower price for 5 cheeses was to create incentive for people to order more (wouldn't you expect to be informed of this??!). So she offers to set the price to the amount of 5 cheese.. but no. We were not offered another cheese. Needless to say, her tip was reduced.
For service alone, I would barely give a 1. The food was good, so I'll give it a 2."}
{"text":"Not L'ALBAGROSS, but not amazing either.  Went home to visit the parents and picked this supposedly delicious foodie locale for our big night out.  It started off fine; I love the space, cozy and open at the same time, big, dramatic art on the exposed brick walls, nice windows overlooking a patio.  The busboys and bread-boys are easy on the eyes and quickly came to our table with water, fresh bread, and olive oil.  But it started going downhill from there--I ordered the signature drink--it was painfully sweet with an odd mix of lemon and absinthe flavors.  Killed the appetite a bit.  My husband and I shared the charcuterie plate which was nice--an interesting selection of cured meets, pickled veggies, and pates--but only came with a few small pieces of crusty bread.  So-so.  We anxiously awaited our dinners while our very nice server disappeared for about 20 minutes.  When she finally materialized with our dinner, we tried our first bites, we all looked at each other with sad eyes that said \"wow, this is IT?\"  So much has been written up about this L'Albatros that is was literally hard to swallow how unforgettable our main courses were.  My hanger steak was cooked with care but served with a too-thick and ultimately flavorless bearnaise.  The pomme frites were SO salty and too gooey to be memorable.  Dad and husband's special of the evening (Boeuf Bourguignon--made desirable by that gem of a flick Julie and Julia) was less than attractive and tasted the same.  My favorite comment of the night?  I asked my mom why she wasn't eating her meal and she said she didn't like it.  I asked what she didn't like about and she replied, \"the taste.\"  I think that sums it all up."}
{"text":"A truly great dining experience. Great, polite, attentive service. And the food... Wow!  I had the Monday night special, Coq Au Vin. This chicken and vegetable dish was out of this world delicious. The sauce was so flavorful. It made the chicken, and the vegetables so good! My wife had a pasta dish (no meat) that was also a cut above normal flavors. The servers were very attentive and knowledgeable regarding wine pairing, etc... 
An absolutely wonderful experience from start to finish. I whole heatedly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful lunch experience here over the holidays. This place is so classy and the service and food are divine. I got the vegetable cassoulet which was so hearty for a vegetable dish and I'm not even a vegetarian! I also got the frites because I can never resist them when dining out. The aioli they come with is SO good. I took half of each home so portion sizes are still great at lunch. Would like to go back for dinner sometime soon!"}
{"text":"Without a doubt, one if our very favorite restaurants in the Cleveland area.  Consistently good food, great wait staff, lovely surroundings.  During the summer, their back patio is a beautiful place to have a meal and enjoy friends and family.

To start, you MUST get a cheese board...one of the most affordable \"luxuries\" you'll find around.  You can choose from 3, 5, 7 (I think?) styles of cheese, and their fromager is always extremely knowledgeable and will help you choose cheese to your liking, or guide you to a few more adventurous choices.  Make sure to get plenty of crusty bread, you'll thank me later!

We do have some other \"staple\" dishes we always love to get, namely the escargot and the mussels with frites.  Their escargot is absolutely to die for!  Drenched in butter, garlic and herbs...these little beauties are delicate, slightly chewy and their sauce demands to be slurped up via dunking of the crusty bread (if I could drink this sauce straight up, I would). As for the mussels and frites, the bowl is a moat of delicous broth and again dunking your crusty bread in their while downing those gems from the sea along with a few frites and the spicy aioli makes for a heavenly dish.

L'Albatros also has a great selection of drinks and cocktails...my wife loves to experiment with new ones each time we go and has never really been disappointed.  Lastly, my daughter is a sucker for their creme brulee with its torched surface and creamy interior.

We consider this spot to be Zack Bruell's greatest restaurant in the area.  If you are looking for a great \"special occasion\" restaurant or even an intimate late-night stop after a show...this is your place!"}
{"text":"The pear cocktail was delicious, and the cheese platter was impressive - favorite was the espresso and lavendar cheese. I heard the night I went, they were missing a few of their regular cheeses as well, including one that melts in your mouth, so I'd be curious to try that. I had the pasta du jour and wasn't too impressed with it, but the duck confit looked amazing. Looking forward to trying next time."}
{"text":"The food, the staff, the ambiance, is always spot on!!   I love going for lunch and sharing a few dishes among two of us.  The sauteed skate wing, duck confit, and Scampie with Pernod cream sauce are to die for!!  A must try in Cleveland!!"}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant with nice ambiance (fireplace and patio for seasonal needs), great service and excellent food. They bring grilled gluten free bread on request, and also made me a French onion soup with it! The soup is hearty and full of tender beef. The house smoked salmon is also good, and the steak frites is fab. Parking!"}
{"text":"First night in Cleveland, while pursuing a 60 day road trip for food.  Sat outside on the patio at this unique Bistro style restaurant, and was warmly welcomed.  The service was fantastic.  My server Jamie is an absolute gem, who guided me perfectly towards a unique dining experience.  Hats off to the chef for the French toast appetizer.  Who would have thought of adding a bechamel sauce and balsamic drizzle to french toast, topping with wild mushrooms, and garnishing with shaved parmesan?  Glad they did.  Perfect early fall appetizer with plenty of flavor and character.

Don't skip the cheese board which turns heads, once it is actually brought to your table.  Great establishment with a very dedicated and outgoing staff, who reflect a passion for their jobs, and the quality of food/ingredients.  Not a place to skip when in town."}
{"text":"I didn't think this lived up to it's reviews or prices. My scallops were excellent, but there were only 3 of them and the pasta and brussel sprouts they were served on were undercooked with a bland sauce. One of our party had the cassoulet, which she thought was quite good, but none of the 4 meals would cause me to come back and pay these prices. Walk a few blocks and eat in Little Italy instead!"}
{"text":"L'Albatros is one of our favorite restaurants and last night's experience was just as good as always. 

We love, love, love the cheese course but decided to skip it this time in favor of starters.  I had the amazingly delicious frisee with egg and bacon. This can't be topped!  The egg was perfectly gooey which paired so nicely with the vinaigrette on the salad. My husband had the escargot  which he loves. It has fennel in it which is so delicious with the sauce. 

For an entree, I enjoyed the Saturday night special which was the boeuf bourguignon. It was the perfect winter dish. My husband had the pied du cochon. He's had this before and it is so yummy. I know pigs foot can be scary to some, but don't be scared. The meat is molded together like a sausage and served with a bernaise sauce. Oh, just try it!

This place is always wonderful...and pretty unique for Cleveland. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Not what it used to be. The food is bland and does not provide any wow effect anymore. Their menu hasn't changed in years. I used to love this establishment, but I must say I am now mostly unimpressed... Staff is always great though."}
{"text":"The food is great .. but I m giving 1 star for their bad ridiculous customer service.
On a dinner table of group of high professionals , a Mercedes keys (value of 400$) , was on a table ..seen by all people on the table . 
All of sudden the keys Vanished .. I tried to find it , looking around .. nothing there . 
I went to the reception , they were like \" ok , leave your phone and call u later \" ..,very careless response.
Then I called their \"manager \" to make sure that keys disappeared in his restaurant , again his response was \" ok \" .. then I burst that is not OK , when something get lost on a dinner table ..
I didn't feel they know what customer service means or they were defensive instead of being responsible and trying to find out what happened .
They never called again ..or showed any kind of follow up on the keys .
Bad on their side .
Never again ..where are the keys ."}
{"text":"Went to L'Albatros because its just a short walk down the alley from Glidden House and I would agree with other Yelpers that this is a quality restaurant . Because of its small size- it conveys a '' bistro'' vibe of intimacy ..... had 3 or 4 different appetizers while seated at a table in their bar section . They were all fine - their version of French Toast was different and tasty albeit a small portion ."}
{"text":"Goat cheese tart, French toast were delicious. Also cauliflower side dish, kids loved it!
The staff were very friendly and our kids also loved the food!
I had special soup which was cold curry carrot soup and it was delicious.
My family had cod and pork and they were both very tasty.
Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Cute and small French restaurant with great food. The apple cinnamon cheesecake was smaller then what I was expecting but delicious."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Ask for Michael  at the bar. He makes the best drinks!!  The food is classic French and the service is great!!!"}
{"text":"Well, there were so many flavors and tastes it's hard to focus! From the Chianti to the amazing French onion soup with braised beef, to the apple cake with praline ice cream... lovely!  We closed out our meal with the spectacular cheese tray and sherry. What an experience!  Others at the table tried the artichoke, the cod and the terraine de chef and all was so well prepared. Nice portion sizes, and the staff was accommodating and fun. The cheese tray is a trip around the world and something so unique. Love this place!!"}
{"text":"Everything was pretty good, but nothing special for the cost.

l'albatros cocktail: super yummy even if it does taste a bit like cheese. $8.

cassoulet: A lot of food, but all parts seemed to taste the same, over powered by the breadcrumbs sprayed over EVERYTHING $22"}
{"text":"Excellent food and impeccable service. Treat yourself to dessert...they are all fabulous. My group ordered several and we were in heaven!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have gone here on many a date night (and even taken her parents here to show off one of Cleveland's best restaurants)! The atmosphere is lovely, both indoors and on the patio. The service is always amazing - they are knowledgeable, friendly, and there's always someone roaming around with bread to refresh your plate! In the winter they also have a coat check, which I wasn't expecting and was delighted to have!

The food is consistently delicious. I always get the chicken with potatoes and goat cheese and it is always an explosion of flavor. My wife mixes it up - hanger steak, pork two ways, bouillabaisse - she's never ordered a dish she doesn't end up loving! Their foie gras is also excellent and I highly recommend to anyone who wants to try it! 

And, of course, it comes as no surprise the dessert is amazing! I am partial to the creme caramel, while my wife prefers the apple cake. They are just the right portion to wrap up a lovely night and, again, are consistent in their taste and high quality."}
{"text":"French restaurants are rare in the Cleveland area, so L'Albatros was a very pleasant surprise. The menu was short but offered variety with a generous handful of specials not on the menu. 

Their escargot in heavy butter sauce and spices was an interesting diversion from the standard butter+garlic venue. Quite rich in flavor. The shoulder of lamb with risotto was a surprise; the risotto was closer to acini di pepe (like the pasta used in Italian wedding soup) but I didn't complain -- it was still delicious.

They had a new Chianti wine (French region) that was incredible with the lamb."}
{"text":"A great atmosphere and a great food experience and def will be back.. Very busy on the weekends"}
{"text":"My husband and I had a lovely anniversary dinner here. I would say skip the cocktails and enjoy the wine. The cheese cart looked phenomenal but we opted to try it another day. The duck confit and salmon with lentil dishes were delicious. We finished off the meal with a crème caramel and a port. Please note that these dishes were gluten free. They also served some gluten free bread in addition to the regular bread for dipping in olive oil. Every other dish we observed being delivered to various tables also looked quite good.

Newcomers be aware the restaurant is on a walking path/street so it is technically inaccessible by car. It abuts a parking lot that costs $2-3 for dining patrons. You can also park on the street where there is metered and walk through the parking lot. We opted for the parking lot."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Cleveland. Beautiful dimly lit ambiance and exceptional food. The specials are amazing and I would highly recommend ordering the cheese appetizer. Someone will bring over a board of cheeses and walk you through selecting 3, 5, or 7 different cheeses. You really can't go wrong! Additionally, we always feel as though we got a great value. Prices are reasonable, especially for this type of restaurant!"}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for our one-year anniversary this past summer, and had to bring our newborn son along because we had literally only lived in the city for a couple days and did not know anyone enough to leave him with. 

They were great about it, though, and set us in a quieter room, and he went right to sleep. Our food was outstanding and service was excellent. It is pricey, but it's not something that should surprise you - it's well documented in all reviews and they do not hide the fact that they are a high-end restaurant."}
{"text":"called to prepay a portion of a family members birthday. asked them to please write up little note to slip in bill when presenting to them. They said they would. Very disappointed they forgot to do this and didn't even tell the guests till they were out the door. Said they would credit the bill? Expected better."}
{"text":"I have dined at L'Albatros many many times over the years and the food and service were stellar. 
My last dining experience, on my birthday, with my family from out-of-town, was not good. 

We arrived at 7:30, were seated immediately with menus, and our drink order was taken some 20 minutes later after asking a passing waiter to send our waiter to take it. 

Bread service was surly, our waiter never returned to take our order for starters, and after taking our food order at 8:10, it had not been served by 9:10. 

No communication from our waiter who did not return to our table., although he was attentive to the two parties at tables near ours.

I walked to the kitchen to check on our order and was told there was a problem preparing one of the seven dishes, and our food would be out shortly.

At 9:30 food was served. Thankfully my guests raved about their food. My choice, cod with spaetzle, was not up to snuff - fish had off taste and spaezle portion was skimpy.

The half portion of food to be boxed by the kitchen was thrown out. While they offered to prepare another dinner for us, by 10:30 we were not of a mind to wait.

No adjustment on bill was offered.

My husband requested a call from management, expected the next day. No call yet.

A very disappointing dining experience."}
{"text":"Great drinks & food. The drinks are excellent, food quality is also amazing- only downside is they don't have many vegetarian options. Lovely patio in the summer also. Definitely recommend the cheese board- a lot of variety to choose from."}
{"text":"My go to recomendation for anyone looking for a classy, French inspired restaurant. I say inspired because they have dishes that transcend the typical French classics. Not that there is anything wrong with classics! I can honestly say after 4 times here I was never left wanting for the quality of the service, food, and ambiance. The perfect spot after a classy evening say, enjoying the Orcherestra at Severance. If you are unfamiliar with French, come here, engage your server, let them do what they do best and guarantee you will be happy. If you have kids, you will enjoy it much more if you spring for a sitter. This is a place best allowed to pace leisurely from course to course, and the tables can be close together."}
{"text":"Had lunch here for first time with two other diners on 3/12/18. Likes; service, menu variety, tasty food, soup du jour, location, parking and general ambiance - our table was contiguous to courtyard with lots of natural lighting. Dislikes; the place needs some interior freshening up and what's with the horribly uncomfortable molded plastic seating?!  It's not quaint and we're not sitting on the quai de Montebello in Paris. I'll definitely go back to enjoy the food but not the seating arrangements."}
{"text":"This restaurant is probably one the best places to eat in Cleveland. I loved the atmosphere of the restaurant, and it is located near Case. Tried the duck confit. Minus one star for the price, but French restaurants tend to be expensive."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Cleveland. The patio is gorgeous as well as the interior. I love stopping by after a night at Severance Hall for a light dinner, some good wine and an amazing cheese selection."}
{"text":"This is where my bf and I go when we feel deserving of awesome food at an upscale restaurant. If you're on a budget (be aware \"budget\" here is still not cheap but I mean satisfied for under $20), order the arugula salad with lardons and the French onion soup. If you want to play it safe, order the trout. It comes breaded and fried in brown butter and you really can't go wrong with butter... In fact, you can't go wrong with anything on this menu. I've tried over half of it. The waiters are really good at making recommendations too. Lastly, try an absinthe cocktail! They specialize in those. This is a great place to go with your parents if they're in town, or if you are on a special date, as the atmosphere is cozy and the lighting is romantically dim :) have fun!"}
{"text":"Went to happy hour (only available in the bar area). The hostess was very accommodating and put a couple of tables together for our party of 5. The blood orange champagne cocktail was disappointing. We also ordered kir royales that were better but not on the happy hour list. As a group we tried most items. The goat cheese tart was more like a slice of frittata. I expected it to be more of a savory item but there was a strong lemon infusion. The fried cauliflower was huge but flavorless. Good reviews about the pizza and burger, but I didn't try these. The honey almond cake was more like a strawberry short cake with cream, the cake was dry. Gave it 2.5 stars for the ambiance and service alone."}
{"text":"sooooooooo good. Tried the cassoulet and house salad. Bread and water never empty. Due to a mix-up on order, we were given choc truffles and heartfelt apologies. Great vibe w classic techniques."}
{"text":"After changing my reservation time several times because if a previous engagement, we finally arrived, famished. The host was most hospitable explaining how the specials were cooked. I was so cold considering i walked through a snow sleet shower in the middle May, that I ordered coffee first. The onion soup was the best onion soup I've had!! My pasta entree with veggies was delicious. The salmon was perfect. We lingered and wasn't rushed. The fireplace table was the perfect place to warm out. Definitely a perfect lunch. Our bread plate was constantly filled with bread as soon as each slice was eaten. A definite recommend."}
{"text":"Premium dining spot right in the heart of the University Circle part of Cleveland.  Reservations are necessary. Excellent service, excellent food and loved getting to dine in the backyard patio are. Will return for sure."}
{"text":"I have eaten here 4x. Every time for lunch. Never had dinner.

My Mom is into high end celebrity chef type restaurants and this fits the bill. So for special occasions like Christmas Eve this is her first choice. 

Honestly every meal I have had here has been good. We ordered a drink. I got the Harvest. I liked it. My Mom got a moscato. We like sweet wines. 

For an appetizer we decided to split the artichoke with lemon aioli- the lemon aioli was the best thing I ever ate. It was fantastic. No lie. Artichoke was adequately prepared. But the lemon aioli was so good! I ate the rest of it with the bread. 

Had the pasta of the day and Mom had the burger. Honestly the burger looked good. Had a bite along with the pomme fritas, it was good. My pasta was good as well. Homemade linguini with olive oil Parmesan cheese and pea's. food is very good. No problems or complaints. 

Our service was great. All the staff is friendly. The only other thing is expect to pay high end prices for this experience."}
{"text":"Someone recommended this place for a nice meal. It didn't disappoint. We had the french toast, duck confit and veal short rib. All dishes were very savory and hit the spot after a long drive into town."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me for our first year anniversary we both have never been, first we started with the escargot which was flavorful and delicious but maybe too salty. Next we decided to get the cheese tray The cheese selection is amazing love how they bring it over and tell you about each one and cut them right there at your table as you choose. The Blue cheese selections are amazing in itself. We also ordered the meat tray with accoutrements it was wonderful with the cheeses. For main dishes we ordered the duck Confit it was nice not the best duck I've had and the beans and potatoes were definitely over cooked kind of mushy for my taste. We also ordered the Braised Shoulder of Lamb with risotto also not every impressed by the taste. For the price I feel like the food should have more flavor maybe the other entrées are better but I would only come back for the cheese board choices and meat tray, seems like a lot of hype for this place and the seating is super close together like a buffet, feels super crowded I definitely didn't like that."}
{"text":"Everything about L'Albatros is impeccable, from the romantic ambiance to the attentive service, to the cocktails and food. Where they really shine? The cheese. Do yourself a favor and get a cheese board, and the formagiee will whisk you away on an educational and delicious tour of cheeses of your choice. I never expected to learn so much from an upscale meal! 

But seriously, the formagiee that worked with us was so knowledgeable, friendly, and tolerant of our naive questions. I would go back again just for the cheese experience."}
{"text":"L'Albatros is a good restaurant to visit in Cleveland. The food here is actually good, well thought out and impeccably prepared. The pricing is right where it needs to be as well, which rounds this location out. 

The last time we were there was early in 2010 and we had a really bad experience. This was the first bad experience we have had in about six visits to the restaurant, so we will definitely be giving it another shot when we return to Cleveland later this summer. 

Be sure to save room after your meal for the cheese selection. It is one of the best in Cleveland, perhaps falling slightly behind the Baricelli Inn whose cheese selection is really impressive. That being said, you should also try the cheese cake at L'Albatros. It is one of the best cheese cakes we have ever had."}
{"text":"As with all of Zack Bruell's Cleveland Restaurants - L'Albatros is 100% FABULOUS.  Don't forget to check out the patio for a truly romantic setting - or with a group of friends.  In the cooler months - or for their air-conditioning, the inside is just as intimate and marvelous.  The food is not to be believed.  Zack is the most innovative and talented chef in town!!!  Cleveland is blessed to have him here - when he could clearly succeed in NEW YORK CITY, Chicago or elsewhere.  SO GLAD he came back to his home-town to spread his talent.  I can't think of anything on the menu that I would not recommend - it's ALL delish!
Save room for dessert, too!  A tiny bit on the pricey side - but worth every penny.  ALSO - the wait staff is top notch - and the management is 100% professional and always willing to make your dining experience as memorable as possible!!  NO, I am not related to Mr. Bruell - just a huge fan, along with the rest of my friends and family!"}
{"text":"I was surprised by this place- I saw the good reviews but I'm normally not really one for fancy food.  the Wife and I came here to celebrate Cleveland food on our Staycation and really really enjoyed it.  Loved the TERRINE DU CHEF- not pasty like some other pates.  Loved how it came with pickled onions and cornichons.  My wife had the CASSOULET (braised white beans with lamb, duck confit and sausages).  It was hearty, had tons of pieces of meat and sausage in a wonderful earthy, beany sauce.  Very french and plenty to mop up with the delicious crusty bread.  We don't normally order dessert but we were on a roll so we ordered the Meyer Lemon Tart.  It was beautiful, carmelized peaks of meringue on top.  The lemon curd was a little soupy but I'll forgive it because it was otherwise delicious.  To top it off it was not too expensive for what you got.  Service was outstanding.  We will be back."}
{"text":"It was a great meal from beginning to end! The menu offers a variety of options and you can't go wrong. There is really something for everyone here. The service is also exceptional and they are very knowledgeable of the menu. I will definitely be going back again!!"}
{"text":"We had a great experience, from the Vieux Carre to the french onion soup to the cassoulet.  Service was outstanding and the atmosphere made us feel like we were in California.  This is worth every penny."}
{"text":"I have to start by saying that I have never received restaurant service like this before in my life. From the minute we walked in to L'Albatros, we were provided with genuine, attentive, quality service from a host of staff throughout the night, each doing his or her job to make our dining experience seamless. We were seated in the patio and were promptly given some nice chewy baguette. After mulling for a while over the tantalizing menu, we chose the escargot in garlic and fennel butter, the cold watermelon beet soup, the hanger steak and frites, and the duck confit. The escargot was very flavorsome (though could've been a bit more garlicky), and my hanger steak was wonderfully tender. Our lovely waitress recommended the honey-almond cake for dessert, but we found it to be a bit dry and skimpy on the cream and berries. So we told our waitress, and she promptly brought us a new one. Great service, food, and experience. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I rarely give five stars but this place nailed it! From the amazing smoke salmon appetizer to the selection of cheeses everything was delicious. Our waitress was very knowledgeable about the menu and gave us great suggestions. Very attentive to ensure your waters were filled and plates cleaned off in a timely manner.

They had a gentleman come around with the cheeses to let us choose what we wanted- he knew so much and gave us great advice on what to choose. 

Everyone was happy with their main courses- I did the duck confit which I loved with the sweet potatoes . Others did the cassoulet (which is a lot to eat) the trout and the baked chicken with goat cheese. Everyone raved about their choices, all of which were suggested by our waitress.


We were stuffed but all wanted to split a dessert- decided on chocolate napoleon (again our waitress helped us out) and it was to die for. 


We left with full bellies and a desire to return again soon!


We ate inside but the patio looked awesome- was a little cold for it this weekend!"}
{"text":"Yes. Go. The food is excellent. The atmosphere and design of the interior is unique and enjoyable. I love this restaurant."}
{"text":"Good food and service.  When I used Yelp to check the menu, the prices were substantially less expensive than in real life.  Come on people, update the online menu."}
{"text":"I've heard about this place for so long but haven't tried it until now. We went for our graduation and it's like a hidden gem in University Circle. Nice ambiance and the food was amazing!! All their appetizers are delish. The menu is a bit pricey but well worth it for a special occasion."}
{"text":"The service at this restaurant was great. The staff was so friendly I wanted them to sit down and join me for dinner. 

The problem with the dinner I had was in it's preparation. 

My entree (if you know any French, you know this is the appropriate use of this word) was the mushroom soup. I felt, and the folks at the table next to me agreed, that the soup was salty. It was also served too hot -- ok skip the McDonald's hot coffee jokes.

For my main course, I ordered the cassoulet. I love cassoulet. The duck in this cassoulet was too salty. One of the staff confided that the duck is cured in a salt solution but it was a too salty solution. It detracted from the dish. But I must say that the sausages and pork were well executed and quite tasty. The white beans were done to perfection.

For dessert I had the brownie. It was supposed to have a mix of cherries and walnuts in it. In the whole brownie, there were two bites with cherry. The rest was just nuts. The brownie was also burnt.

I can recommend the Chinon wine but the same glass of wine is $5 cheaper ($7 vs $12) at the Visible Voice bookstore. 

I don't know if this was an off night or what but I was disappointed by my experience."}
{"text":"Wow. I'm not that familiar with the Cleveland dining scene, but coming from Chicago, L'Albatros would be a welcome addition of heaven in any Chicago neighborhood. Admittedly, I don't venture out for French food as often as other cuisines (mostly out of courtesy to my waistline), but when I do, I have to throw all thoughts of calories out the window and let loose. And that's exactly the best way to enjoy a fantastic French establishment like L'Albatros. 

I enjoyed L'Albatros with two friends a week ago on a random Thursday night while in town for a couple days. The restaurant ambiance is perfect for a cozy but modern French restaurant. Intimate but not quiet. Quaint but also elegant. There's an open kitchen that you see right upon entering but it's not visible from most tables. There's also a cute bar just before entering the main dining room.  This could easily be a local neighborhood eatery in any French town. 

We were seated immediately for our reservation and started with a delicious bottle of Sancerre. Our server was extremely helpful in guiding us through the menu, making recommendations, and also politely suggesting we might want to wait and see if we were still hungry after the first 7 items we ordered before adding more.  The menu is massive, so the good news is there is something for everyone. The bad news is you want to try everything. 

We began the night with escargot, French toast, oysters on a half shell, and the arugula and radicchio salad. 

Wow. What a start. The oysters were perfect, fresh and with a delicious mignonette. 

The escargot was buttery and garlicky just as it should be.  They will gladly bring you as much bread as you want to use to dip and soak up all the heavenly garlic butter. Don't be shy. We might have asked for refills at least 3 times. Ok, 4 times. 

The French Toast was an interesting concept with egg soaked bread topped with mushroom heaven, balsamic, and arugula. I will never be able to eat mushrooms any other way again. 

The arugula salad was a nice fresh and light contrast to make us feel like we weren't total gluttons. 

Despite being totally full after the starters, our two entrees came next - the cassoulet and the trout with a side of the crispy breaded cauliflower. All were excellent but heavy (even the trout was a little extra buttery). The cassoulet is super meaty with a variety of animals tossed in a skillet of heavenly flavors. The trout was moist and delicious. And the cauliflower was a perfect side. We easily could have ordered 3 fewer items and have been totally full. (But we needed more food to go with the second bottle of wine...)

All in all, it was a wonderful night out for 3 friends who don't see each other often. The restaurant was bumping at 7:30 when we got there and totally empty at 10:15 when we left. But that's expected for a school night. 

Can't recommend this restaurant enough for anyone looking for a fun night out or a great date spot."}
{"text":"Went for my birthday, it was very crowded, but they were accommodating. The food is very well prepared, the \"French Toast\" was innovative, and delicious. A Cleveland jewel."}
{"text":"L'Albatros has been on mine and the BF's list of restaurants to try since we moved in Ohio in 2009.  It wasn't until we decided to move out of Ohio that we finally scheduled a date at this gem.  And I am so glad we did.

We opted to try L'Albatros over lunch instead of dinner, and this was an excellent choice.  With the exception of a few dishes, the menu is exactly the same, only a few bucks cheaper.  Not a bad deal.

We choice to sit on the patio, which is a MUST.  You would never guess that this gorgeous outdoor space was hidden in this area.  The patio is a huge, and is adorned with tables for dining, couches for lounging, and a bar for imbibing.  So no matter what you came to L'Albatros to do, you can do it on the patio.

Our meal began with bread that the restaurant gets from a local bakery.  Very soft on the inside, with a nice crispy crust, it's served with olive oil for dipping.  

For entrees, I chose the Choucroute Garni and the BF chose the Cassoulet.  Both were served in 12-inch skillets, so the portions were quite large, even for lunch.  If you're super hungry, you can probably finish it all in one sitting, but there's definitely enough to bring leftovers home.  The quality of the food was superb.  Both of our dishes were meat-heavy, and each of the meats was cooked perfectly.  I'm not normally a fan of duck, but the duck in the cassoulet was fall-off-the-bone tender.  The pork belly in the Choucroute dish simply melted in my mouth.  It's extremely rare to find an establishment that can cook pork belly so perfectly.  Too often, it's overcooked and chewy, but that was not the case a L'Albatros.

Hearing nothing but great things about the dessert, the BF and I split the Chocolate Napoleon which is chocolate mousse and fresh raspberries layered between sheets of crispy phyllo.  While the dessert was tasty, both the BF and I agreed that it would have been better with soft phyllo instead as the crispy phyllo made the dish difficult to eat.

If L'Albatros isn't on your must-try list, put it on there now and pay them a visit while the weather permits patio dining!"}
{"text":"Went again for a special romantic dinner. Got largely the same items. We were on the fence about the 3 or 5 cheese plate, so the server offered us a compromise on 4 cheeses. They bring over a huge wooden platter with  more cheese than I could ever eat in my lifetime. The servers are very knowledgeable, and helped us pick the cheeses we were looking for! The fig spread is delicious, and provides a sweet contrast to the salty and creamy cheeses. Just wish it came with either some fruit or crackers, but the bread was an acceptable substitution.

The french toast and root vegetable cassoulets were excellent as usual. Don't know if I would ever stray from those dishes. The pear tart this time was deliciously moist, and the burnt caramel ice cream was just as I remembered. Salty and sweet with an amazing depth of flavor.

Even though the food is beyond amazing, I think the service really makes it. Every single server that approached our table was beyond kind and gracious. On our way out, no less than 5 people wished us a good night. Don't know if I can love this place more than I already do!

The price of the food is perfectly reasonable for a date night. It won't break your bank at all. For two drinks, a cheese board, an appetizer, two entrees, a side and a dessert, we paid about $90. It was a steal compared to the food quality, and we even had enough left over for lunch the next day!"}
{"text":"L'Albatros is an amazing restaurant. We dined  there on Friday night for the first time, and look forward to going back. Where does one start? Top notch customer service was a huge plus, and knowledgeable and skilled waitstaff. We started off with the onion soup. Not overly salty (a plus), rather delicately seasoned to infuse your mouth. Second course we had escargot. Delicious! For our main course we shared the leg of  braised lamb and the cassoulet. Both were prepared perfectly for us....tastes and flavor were limitless. Oh, I must not forget the wine selection. We shared a wonderful Bordoeux red wine. I don't recall who helped us select this wine, perhaps the GM. All I know and recall is his warm demeanor, his sharp suit, and his knowledge of wine. And he wished us a \"happy anniversary\"....thus making us feel extra special that evening!"}
{"text":"L'Albatros is hidden away behind a row of Greek life housing and a parking lot, nestled in a small and intimate building.  Once you step inside, it is a completely different atmosphere with modern decor.

To one side of the restaurant, you see contrasts of dark brick with white furniture to brighten the room, with a fireplace as the centerpieces of one of the rooms.  The large window provides a picturesque view of the patio with and outdoor bar, stylish furniture and a garden full of beautiful, white Hydrangeas.  The bar has a nice, clean, contemporary seating area.  Liken much to a trendy scene, where young professionals or stylish adults would meet to grab a drink or two. With two small booths for those, who desire to sit in a booth, instead of a bar chair.  The other side of the restaurant has softer lines with bright colors with a semi-private dining area.  

We started off by ordering two specialty drinks: \"Effen Herbs and Berries\" and \"Port of Call.\"  Each of the drinks had contrasting flavors in comparison to each other.  The Effen Herbs and Berries had a nice sweet taste with smashed basil and strawberries.  The splash of balsamic vinegar completed the drink.  The Port of Call was more of a tart drink with light hints of lemon and figs at the bottom.  Both were a nice refreshing summery libation.    

We started off with an appetizer of escargot, which were okay.  The escargots were served in a non-traditional style with the shells off and in a miniature casserole dish.  The escargots sat on a bed of surprisingly crispy croutons and were completely covered in a buttery, lightly garlic sauce.  It was quite the variation from the typical white wine, garlic, parsley, and tarragon sauce.  They were not the best escargots I've had, but my view on escargots is a bit bias since my trip to Paris.  For Cleveland, they're good, not great, but good.  

I got a side salad just for a balanced meal; a typical basic salad with lettuce, tomato, etc.  The dressing was a slightly sour/tart, perhaps balsamic vinaigrette, but heavy on the vinegar.  

Unfortunately, my main course did not go over as well.  I got the pan seared scallops and fresh pasta, a \"popular dish,\" as quoted by the waitress.  The scallops were cooked perfectly, without rubbery texture and not overly seasoned.  You could taste the fresh scallops.  However, the fresh pasta was chewy and needed to be cooked an extra 1-2 minutes.  The basic bechemel sauce surrounding the pasta and lining the underside of the scallops was bland and lacked flavor.  I quite surprised to hear that this was a popular dish.  I hate to send food back and be a bother, but this was so too disappointing not to send back.  Perhaps, they forgot an ingredient or two when they made mine?

Luckily, we had a wonderful waitress, Tesa (pronounced Teasa), who was very gracious and accommodating.  Our water glasses were always full and she made sure we were satisfied.  In lieu of the scallops that were sent back, she advised me to try the Hanger Steak and Frites.  THE DISH WAS ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS.  The steak was tender and cooked to a lovely shade of pink in the middle (I like my steak medium-medium well).  The steak juices just oozed out every time I stuck my fork or knife into it...  Mmmmm (mouth watering, while writing this review, kind of good).. The steak was dressed in a Bearnaise sauce, which is different from the typical Espagnole sauce that goes with beef.  It was different, providing a slightly different flavor to the steak.  The sauce didn't overpower the steak, but instead, enhanced every the flavor and the seasonings of the steak.  The delicious shoestring-like fries were cooked in beef fat (as I was told), providing the sweet AROMA OF A FRESH DONUT with the tasty savoriness of beef (insert more mouth watering).  

Bottom Line: While the dinner went off to a rough start, the restaurant's strong points: great customer service, drinks, Steak and Frites, and atomsphere, saved the night.  I shall return to L'Albatros for some more Steak Frites and to venture onto other dishes soon."}
{"text":"This was an interesting choice of location for us, we don't rarely choose French Cuisine. :) I wasn't quite sure what to order off of the menu, luckily our server was extremely helpful. Honestly, I kind of just made a guess and crossed my fingers! Thankfully I was pleasantly surprised, everything was delicious, and nothing I would normally make for myself. I will definitely go back if we are in the Cleveland area."}
{"text":"Okay, confession; I'm not used to going to classy places. Normally, I'm not the \"suit and tie at dinner\" type, but L'Albatros is a place I'd gladly dress up for again.

We had a giftcard from a wonderful friend of ours, and decided to visit this gem in University Circle. We were not disappointed. 

We were early, and decided to eat at the bar, which was very well stocked and was manned by a young gentleman who treated us like kings. Their food is very good (I had a pizza that was one of the best I think I've ever tasted, my wife had a duck confit that was wonderful as well.) I'm not used to French cuisine, but I must say, I was really impressed. 

The atmosphere is very classy, but also casual. I think this would be a good place to take clients for a business lunch/dinner or if you're really wanting to treat that special someone to a special night out. 

The prices are what you would expect from and A+ level place, but I think the experience was worth it. 

So, if you're searching for a special dining experience and want to treat that special someone right, follow this classy bird to University Circle and visit L'Albatros:)"}
{"text":"Great food and drinks! Lovely patio in the summer. One of our favorite spots in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Really one of the best restaurants in Cleveland. Tucked off the street on Case's campus-- you would never guess that the surrounding area houses some of the biggest geeks in Ohio.  L'Albatros is modern, sexy, comfortable.  The menu changes regularly, but the extensive wine menu and cheese selection stay.  Bring a date or good friend."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere--cozy brick floor and warm fireplace. The location was a little hard to find for those of us not familiar with the city. The Chop Salad was delicious. My husband ordered the Roasted Cod with some apprehension about the cornichon aioli, but it was not overly rich and creamy.  It was an excellent blend of flavors--cheese, mild sauerkraut, spatzle, creme fraiche and aioli. Our party of four was delighted with our entire experience and highly recommend L'Albatross."}
{"text":"Dined on the terrace on a Monday evening.  We started with oysters on the half shell (with mingnonette sauce) and Goat cheese and herb tart. They were both wonderful served on a warm night with a crisp white Bordeaux.  The tart was luscious and savory but very delicate leaving plenty of room for entrees and a desert.  We ordered the ROASTED TROUT WITH ALMOND CRUST and the ROASTED COD
with spätzle, sauerkraut, crème fraîche and cornichon aioli  the latter a far more elegant and  delicious choice.   
The cofe au lait was superb.  My dinner companion and I split an ample sized Napoleon for dessert.   The service was amicable."}
{"text":"Came here for a Saturday lunch after exploring the gorgeous Museum of Art and University Circle. Read a lot of good reviews online before coming here, and this place definitely deserves all these 5-stars. I love this place!

Highlights:
+ Good outdoor patio in the summer
+ Exceptional service!! I initially ordered an appetizer that I ended up not liking - the waiter (or manager?) was asking table-by-table about their experience, noticed I wasn't too fond of the appetizer, and immediately offered to take it off the bill. 
+ Exception food - I had a bowl of French onion soup ($6) and the Roasted Cod ($16). The sou was decent, but the Roasted Cod was breathtakingly delicious 

Definitely recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Definitely the best restaurant in Cleveland, everything was beyond phenomenal. Everything we had was awesome- but my favorite were the oysters and the French toast appetizer. The oysters were so fresh and the sauce that it comes with we asked for on the side. As for the French toast, I think I could eat it for breakfast even though it had mushrooms on it. I didn't want to leave, I wanted to stay and keep eating! Also, cheese for dessert was quite amazing! We tried more mild cheeses, but they were so delicious. I highly recommend the chimay. The staff was so knowledgeable and really friendly. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"My husband and myself went here for Easter dinner.  We had a delicious dinner. Our appetizers were quiche and leeks with mustard, Dinner was Waleye dish and pasta with cauliflower.  Dessert was berries with creme.  We really enjoyed the dinner.

The only disappointing thing about today was as soon as we walked out of the restaurant in their parking lot.  There was a lady asking us for $20.00.  She was really invading our space so of course we just gave it to her for her to get away.  Too bad that happened because it really put a damper on the experience.

I believe that the restaurant should have some type of guard just to curtail that problem.  I would not feel safe going by myself to meet a friend there.  I would of rated this 5 stars  but the parking lot took away one of the stars."}
{"text":"This place is adorable and if it werent for the fact that other diners were around you, you'd feel as though you were eating at home with a private French chef.

Our group started off with bread which they brought around to all the tables. They also gave us really good quality olive oil to go with it. It was aromatic and fresh. Yummmmm! Our table ordered some drinks; I was extra cool and got a cream soda (who likes alcohol anyway? Psh...) which was very tasty and strong.

We decided to skip the appetizers and go straight for the entrees so we wouldn't get too full for dessert. Our table ordered the walleye, rib eye, braised lamb shoulder and cassoulet so we could nibble bits and pieces of each other's dishes. Everyone's was delicious and juicy and had the characteristic buttery taste typical of French cuisine. By no means do I claim to be a French chef or expert as this was the first time I ever had cassoulet but I found my dish to be a little too salty for my taste. I loved the sausage, duck confit (for the delicious crispy skin) and lamb. I could have done without the chicken but my table gobbled it up.

We decided to check out the dessert menu out of curiosity. We had planned to go somewhere else for dessert but they caught our eye. My friend and I shared the cheesecake with creme fraiche. This is the definition of dessert. Light, creamy, not too sweet, with a cheese flavor that wasn't overpowering. Love!! Our table got other desserts but I didnt try them but they looked equally appetizing. Overall, we don't regret not going to our originally planned dessert place.

We also got some coffee, also tasty and strong. I had two sips total and somehow I wasnt able to sleep for several hours last night...not sure if it's that or because I had napped earlier in the day."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been on my radar for many, many years and I am embarrassed how long it took me to actually go. Recently my husband started working in University Circle so we decided to meet for lunch and finally give this place a try. I am SO glad we did. 

When we arrived, I was a bit turned off by the hostess. It was a Tuesday at lunch and the place had about 3 tables full. She was a bit rude in her \"do you have reservations question\" and when we said no, she just walked off. She came back quickly and commented, \"ok, we have room for you.\" I think they are a bit full of themselves and it was a bit unwarranted. I mean, she is the hostess, she probably should know the restaurant has 3 occupied tables and plenty of room. 

Anyways, once you get past the hostess everything goes right uphill and in the most delicious way possible. The cheese, the bread, the entrees. I am pretty much drooling writing this review and just want to time machine myself back to my table. 

My only negative is the bread. PLEASE STOP GIVING ME BREAD, I CANNOT SAY NO."}
{"text":"Oh. My. Gosh.

We were looking for somewhere \"fancy\" to go, but we weren't sure if we defined \"fancy\" as involving well-dressed patrons, staff who dusted crumbs off the tablecloth, or food with mouth-exploding flavor. Whatever we were searching for, L'Abatros definitely fit the bill.

As it seems everyone has been saying, get the \"French Toast.\"
Do it.
You won't be sorry. It's an appetizer, and no, it's not sweet. If there are two of you (and yes, I recommend this absolutely as a date spot [but probably not for a first date]) they split it in half and give you each your portion (they likely know there'd be some bickering over the division and are trying to preserve your relationship). The toast is lightly sweet and creamy--as with \"normal\" (read: boring) French toast, it's been soaked in cream/egg and fried in butter (mmmm!). But then it gets a balsamic drizzle, flaked cheese, gorgeous mushrooms, and a cream sauce. I just--you need to get it. A sweet lady seated nearby was pleased to see we'd ordered it and gave it her hearty recommendation before engaging in a 20-minute conversation with the sommelier about mutual friends.

I also got the root vegetable cassoulet--a white bean porridge/casserole creation with hunks of roasted parsnip, carrot, and acorn squash and topped with flaked cheese and more of those amazing mushrooms. My date got the almond-encrusted trout and found it similarly delicious, but he can post his own review. ;)"}
{"text":"I had a fantastic experience when dining at L'Albatros with my girlfriend a few months ago.   I'd heard about this restaurant from a segment on Marketplace by American Public Media.

We were greeted by an open kitchen and modern decor. After being seated, we had no problem finding something delicious to eat.  

One recommendation:  get the cheese plate.  Their resident fromagist Brandon Chrostowski is the OG of cheese in the Cleveland area.  He'll be able to give you some excellent information on many cheeses that you possibly didn't even know existed.  For me, the cheese plate was the highlight of the evening.

I'll definitely be visiting L'Albatros again soon."}
{"text":"We have been to this restaurant countless times over the last several years and the food, the service, and the ambiance have always been outstanding. I certainly owe them a review. As aforementioned, though we have been here more than a dozen times in the past, I will just specifically review this dining experience. My husband and I went over the weekend and sat on the patio and it was a perfect night weather wise. The service was a little bit slow because of how busy they were, but I will not hold this against them because in their defense, I think that is an anomaly. Their service typically is excellent. We often get the cheese board which is the best cheese board I've ever had regardless of city, but it was a cool enough night where we each got a cup of the onion soup which was phenomenal add anyways. We split the special that night which was the halibut and I've included a picture. It was beautiful and well done. We finished the dinner with a lemon roll dessert which was more than amazing. My husband typically gets a beer and myself a cocktail although we did not get drinks this time. In summary, this is one of the top five restaurants in Cleveland because of the quality of the food, the service, the atmosphere and ambience, and most importantly, the consistency."}
{"text":"My first time here with my husband, we tried because of the great reviews. We left disappointed.
 The meal it self wasn't anything to rave about the meat dish was so greasy and everything just tasted the same after swimming in the oil/grease. I got the muscles and they weren't bad but the fries were too soggy. The Caesar  salad was the best tasting thing we ate. The only saving grace was the mixed berry and creme dessert. The service was not good at all, it felt as if we bothered the waitress. The woman who brought us water and bread was very nice and was willing to answer questions without treating us like we were idiots because we wore jeans and tshirts. Having been to France, this place was nothing like the food I experienced abroad. Very disappointing after reading the reviews."}
{"text":"The beau had a random night off work and invited me out for a date!  I almost felt like a \"normal\" couple going out for dinner on a Friday night.

We were seated in the cramped dining room to the left of the bar with a view of the patio.  It has been a while since I've been at a restaurant where you're sitting on top of people, so I felt mildly uncomfortable.  This quickly dissipated though.  

I was a little confused on the service when three-four different people approached the table telling us about specials, bringing us food, and taking orders.  They were all great, but I felt like it was a little over-kill on the service side. (Not something I normally complain about).  

We started with an absolutely delicious dish that I never would have considered.  The Mushroom, Balsamic French Toast!  It was melt-in-you-mouth good.  The French Toast was so light and the balsamic so sweet.  Heaven in my mouth!  We enjoyed the Pate.  (Buttah, baby!)  The house-made fig preserve was a wonderful compliment to the pate.  We enjoyed our appetizers so much we ordered some more.  The next course was braised leeks and escargots.  The leeks were perfect.  They were braised and then chilled with a lovely mustard.  The escargots were the only \"let-down\" and that's simply because they didn't come traditionally prepared.  They were delicious but so incredibly rich I could only eat two.

The man proceeded to order the Roasted Cod and I an Arugula Salad.  I was so stuffed from the rich dishes I couldn't contemplate an entree.  Both were served to perfection.  

As we came to the close of our meal the table next to us  was seated with a new party and unfortunately we had to inquire if we might move to the bar.  The new party was loaded with perfumes and immediately my beau could not breath.  (Minor rant:  Seriously people, how can you eat your food if the fragrance you are wearing is so strong I can smell you before you walk into the room?  Also, please be aware that many people have fragrance allergies so think before you put on that Eau de toilette)  The service staff graciously ensured us it was not a problem and quickly removed us to the bar.  There we were greeted with two desserts (courtesy of the chef) both of which were paired beautifully with dessert wines (courtesy of the manager).  

L'Abatros was amazing on all counts.  The menu items were priced VERY reasonably for the quality and quantity of food you receive.  I recommend this for a nicer dinner out.  You'll not be disappointed by the service or the food.  And if you order dessert, please request they pair it with a dessert wine.  Your mouth will thank you."}
{"text":"Delicious food just don't go if you only have an hour for lunch.  So slow and it wasn't busy.  Luckily I went with my boss so I wasn't judged for being gone for an hour and a half then came back to my desk to eat my food. It took 45 minutes to get my starter, and super tasty, cup of carrot and ginger soup.  I got my yummy Croque Monsieur with a side of Brussels sprouts 30 minutes after I finished my soup.  I had to ask for it to be boxed up so I could eat it at my desk while working.  If they don't want to be a work lunch place I wish it would be mentioned somewhere that they are not a quick service lunch type of place."}
{"text":"I'm from the westside of town.  There are many great French restaurants, however this one has my favorite, fois gras mousseline. They have other nice dishes as well. Very cute place, but the chairs are hard and not very comfortable. I will overlook that because you make my mouth smile."}
{"text":"On our visit to Cleveland I wanted to try all the good restaurants here. Based on recommendations from Chowhound.com we ate at Lola, Crop Bistro, Moxie, and L'Albatros. We loved all of them especially Crop. L'Abatros is one of our very good experience. The food was of high quality and most of all the services were excellent. I did not like the french onion soup, I thought it was salty, the owner or manager came out and took care of it right away. He took the soup back, I ordered the foie gras/ pate instead and it was very good, there were more pate than I could finish, I had to save room for my main course. I ordered the \"Pied de cochon\" which is a sausage-like dish, it was very very fatty, interesting but not that impressed. My son ordered the steak and it was excellent. We ordered the chocolate brownie and the Napoleon for desert. I would recommend the chocolate brownie but not the Napoleon ( just OK ). The overall experience was very positive, the waitress was very attentive and pleasant. I would reccommend this restaurant strongly. I saw other items on the menu that I would try if I come back. Being out of town I am glad I chose L'Albatros. You will not regret, if I come back to Cleveland I will definitely come to this place again."}
{"text":"Patty are waitress is tres magnifique! Wonderful atmosphere, great food, romantic! A+"}
{"text":"The service was impeccable -- attentive, friendly, and efficient. The restaurant is rustic and beautiful. But the food overall was medicore. The pulled pork appetizer was simultaneously too salty and bland. The escargot appetizer was extremely salty and not interesting. My son ordered cod in a cream sauce. After he complained to me I took a morsel and found it tasteless. My other son ordered beef with a roseotto type pasta. I tried the roseotto and it did not have delicate flavoring which I expect in a French restaurant in this price range. My seared scallops in a cream sauce with pasta were good, as was my spouse's fish with almonds. So the overall food eating experience was medicore."}
{"text":"REALY REALly good!! The duck confit is AMAZING!!!  Definitely recommend this place awesome date spot"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! First time here, all I can say it mouthwatering! Began with a black and blue specialty drink that was recommended by our waitress. Then I got the chicken confit after yelping what I should get..lol. And ended the meal with a pistachio cake. Everything was delicious, but let me just take a second to say the pistashio cake was the bomb!! Do not leave until you have had pistachio cake...that's how good it was!! The restaurant provided a very romantic ambience--perfect for date night. Lastly, I just want to comment that our waitress was super friendly and provided excellent service..loved her accent!"}
{"text":"Had a good experience trying their foie gras/pate, cod, and french onion soup.  Decor is efficient and trendy and music hip.

Service was friendly and rather efficient, as well as attentive.  Wine list wasn't extensive, but had a decent selection of bottles.  

The cheese selection is impressive, and will require another visit to appropriately plumb."}
{"text":"This is just a quick update to my review (see below for more).

In a few words...

the patio during summertime? Warm, cozy, well-populated with cabana-like seating for more relaxed larger parties... it is GREAT.

I had the cod -- really good, a little on the creamy side for me post-workout that day, but it was cooked very well. 

Tried some of the red cabbage from the duck confit... addicting.

Arugula salad with poached egg -- my bf and I split it and they very kindly gave us two (full?) plates and 2 eggs!

Service -- my cup was never past half-empty ever. 5 stars for service!!

This is always a great place for a date!"}
{"text":"The wife and I were in town to visit family and celebrate our anniversary. So after a nice evening of visiting the Cleveland Museum of Art I thought L'Albatros would be the perfect place to celebrate based on its reviews. 

As I always do when we celebrate a special occasion, I wrote a comment in the open table reservation indicating we are celebrating our anniversary and would appreciate anything they can do to make it special.

We were greeted by a hostess who had a bit of trouble finding the reservation, no problem. When she asked if we'd like to sit inside or outside, the hostess next to her who was half on the phone burst out, \"well if you want to sit outside you'll have to wait.\" I figured she was rude and perhaps no one read the comments. I was going to give them a pass.

We were seated at an okay table, water, oil, bread all came. It was nice. Our server came over to ask about drinks. My wife said something about just having water since we had been on a vineyard tour earlier in the day (and had a complimentary bottle of champagne from our hotel still in the fridge) for our anniversary. 

Her response: \"oh yeah I heard it was you anniversary.\" Seriously, no Happy anniversary, no we're glad you chose to spend your special night with us.

My wife's dish, the sausage, was fairly good. Mine, the hanger steak, was chewy and poor quality. 

I'd like to think our experience could have been better. I get the feeling that the restaurant hires inexperienced Case students. Humorously, I overheard our waitress tell another table that they all take turns being the fromagier for the evening. 

Fortunately we've been married long enough that we laugh it off. If you're looking to celebrate a special occasion, I'd look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Solid French countryside comfort food in a location and ambience that absolutely dazzle. This is the definition of romantic dining, if you're into that sorta thing. The ambling, intimate and interesting restaurant space has several motifs to choose from. If you like a modern feel with bright colors,  go to the room straight past the host desk and the bar.  If you want a space that feels cozier and more traditional, sorta like what I envision an old chateau in the Loire Valley 
to look like, turn left at the desk; you'll find yourself in an immaculately-restored cluster of rooms with deep mahogany (I think) walls, built in wine glass shelves, exposed brick, candles galore, and windows that look out onto the patio through the branches of arborvitae and hydrangeas.  Dynamite spot. Ask for table #203 if you are a party of two; you won't regret it.  

If you're a fan of Chinato and other Zack Bruell joints, the food will have a familiar ring to it: carefully built classics and variations on classics that evidence good cooking technique with a reasonable degree of creativity, with a price tag that won't break the bank. Case and point is the cassoulet ($22), a dish which, in true Cleveland style, features an expertly seared, mouthwatering piece of pork belly, along with homemade sausage, as well as a duck confit leg with skin perfectly crisped on all sides.  The waiter fittingly called it a \"deconstructed\" cassoulet: the protein parts, which sit on top of a tender white bean stew, are all cooked separately and placed atop the beans at the end to maximize their texture and freshness,whereas in a traditional cassoulet, meats elements would stew slowly together in the liquid, creating a gumbo-like result.   The end product is an incredibly satisfying, albeit uber-rich indulgence, served in an All-Clad stainless steel skillet for extra effect.   If you make it through the dish with any appetite still intact, the creme caramel makes a nice finale to your evening;  textbook texture, not-too-eggy, and large enough to share. 

Servers, runners, bussers and managers are very on top of their games here, stealthily appearing at your table when needed or required.   Waitstaff is knowledgable and will eagerly guide you in pairing your dish with wine (great selection of glass pours btw), if you so desire.  Your water glass won't ever be half empty (or half full), and you will always have two pieces of delectable, crusty sourdough on your bread plate.   It's tactful pampering, without the pretension and display of an urban steakhouse.

WIth Trentina, The Barking Spider, Little Italy and loads of city attractions within footsteps of the restaurant, L'Albatros is a great anchor point for a restaurant crawl, a day trip, or even a weekend getaway in Cleveland.   The Glidden House - an immaculate boutique hotel with very reasonable rates - sits almost next door to the restaurant.   For a nice birthday or anniversary indulgence, book yourself a room overnight and enjoy an extra glass of wine or port with your dessert at L'Albatros."}
{"text":"We've been wanting to try L'Albatros for a very long time and finally made it there on a busy Friday night. We didn't have a reservation but they were nice enough to find us a table.  I started with the French onion soup and it was delicious! My husband had potato soup and he also enjoyed it. We also both were very happy with our entrees.  I had chicken with leeks and mashed potatoes and he had a pork dish. We were too full for dessert but there were some great options on the menu and we will definitely save some room next time."}
{"text":"We had such a great experience dining here while in town for work. The ambiance is very relaxed yet sophisticated. The staff & service was on point! 

Everything our table ordered was delicious, fresh, and spot on. I ordered the French Onion soup as an appetizer and it very well could have been a meal. It was by far the best onion soup I've ever had. For an entree I had the duck confit with pickled cabbage and sweet potatoes. The duck was a bit dry / slightly overcooked but the sweet potatoes were melt in your mouth delicious! Our server also provided dessert on the house because we were there to celebrate a special occasion. We opted to try the chocolate napoleon which was layers of flaky pastry, chocolate mousse, and fresh raspberries. The mousse was out of this world! 

When we are in town again, we will be sure to visit. Great job!"}
{"text":"Discontinue the foie gras. Not a healthy or ethical practice:

{"text":"If I could give this restaurant a 4.5, I would.  This restaurant is nestled in the middle of the Case Western Reserve University campus.   Quiet and low-key surroundings are juxtaposed against the energetic buzz of the crowd when you walk in. 

The food is fantastic.  We ordered a simple arugula & parmesan salad, which was perfectly portioned and dressed.  Sometimes you just want the basics to be done right.  For entree, we ordered the duck confit and the papardelle scallops.  I've never met a duck confit that I haven't liked, so it's not exactly a fair review here.  However, the saltiness from the confit was offset nicely with mashed yams and celery root puree.  Very generous portions, you can easily share this dish for two.   The papardelle was cooked nice and al dente, and the scallops offered the heavenly combination of both nice brown grill markets on the skin but nice and tender meat inside which was not overcooked (my biggest pet peeve when ordering scallops is that they're either completely overdone, or not done at all). 

We loved the food so much that we came back TWO nights in a row.  On the second night, we ordered the roasted trout with almond crust which was perfectly light and tasteful.  Very nicely done. 

It's worth mentioning the ambience is chic without being pretentious.  Lovely patio decor provides an intimate candlelit dinner outdoors with the warm summer wind softly rustling through the trees.  (tres romantic).  Inside, the restaurant is equally modern and sleek.  Since I live in New York, I can definitely attest to this restaurant having all of the metropolitan charms without trying too hard. 

Finally, service.  AMAZING.  I don't know if I should attribute the attentiveness of the entire waitstaff to middle America cultural warmth, or if the restaurant staff manager should be credited - but I don't really care.  The waitress knew when not to interrupt an intense discussion, and when to seamlessly top up our water glasses without our noticing, and when to prompt us on what dessert we might be craving.   

All in all, this is a gem of a restaurant that I would be looking forward to eating at the next time I visit Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Best dining experience I've had in years.  The cuisine, the ambiance, the staff such as Michelle and Amanda were exceptional.  This restaurant bar none is one of my TOP 3 choices in Cleveland.  
The seafood stew, the escargot and the wine list are spectacular.
Anticipating our next dinner date at L'Albatros sometime soon.
Thank you to the staff for delivering an outstanding dining extravaganza on a beautiful summer night."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the presentation was very good as well. The price was also reasonable. I would definitely come back next time I am in Cleveland."}
{"text":"It's a place for multiple occasions, either hanging out with friends, birthday, dates, or your parents are visiting Cleveland. 
It is classy and the food is so delicious. It's not that expansive, especially if you are going in for lunch.
It's a pretty classy place, so do dress up a little bit. We have someone wearing shorts and shirts in our group, but people inside is generally well dressed."}
{"text":"Favorite restaurant in Cleveland. Perfect date place, particularly in summer, on arguably the best patio in town. Every meal here has been best-in-class or very close. Coq au Vin and Pork Osso Buco daily specials are particular favorites; most recently opted for the Root Vegetable Cassoulet, which was also outstanding. Prices are extremely reasonable relative to downtown counterparts. Very few places get absolutely everything right. This is one of them."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Had dinner with friends a couple weeks ago and were wowed!  

Great Service, Great Drinks, Great Location, and Amazing Food!  

Get the Pork Two Ways, unreal!  I highly reccomend this place.  

Nice job!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Parking: There is a parking lot right in front of the restaurant, and it costs about $2 per hour. You can also find some free street parking nearby though! 

Ambiance: Dimly lit restaurant with some interesting wall decor. Most of the clientele seem to be older people in their 40s-60s. 

Service: Great service!! There are constantly waiters coming to your table to fill your water and bread plate! 

Food: Some things I tried include:
- Escargo: Loved the flavor! It was escargo in a rich, creamy sauce. The portion size wasn't too big though for $12. Despite the price, I would definitely get it again! 
- Cassoulet: Duck confit, lamb, and 2 sausages with white beans. This was a huge portion! It was a bit salty for me though, but I definitely recommend this for all you meat lovers :) 
- Veal: This dish had sooo many layers of flavors and the meat was so tender. It's unbelievable! 
- Salmon: Nothing too impressive! Flavor was light but the meat was tender and melts in your mouth. 

Overall, I'm very satisfied with L'Albatros! :)"}
{"text":"This is foodie heaven in a quaint little house setting in old Cleveland.  I came here fully intending to have the cassoulet which everyone (except one shamefully unadventurous purist) loved.  That said, the specials of the day tore me away from that plan. Jamie, our server gets top honors among wait staff, not only for her excellence in service, but for her mouthwatering descriptions of the food(s).  And...with her peppy demeanor and sultry voice, I think she would make shoe leather sound appetizing. In this case, she was dead on target with her obviously well informed reviews.  Clearly, she takes great pride in her work and in the quality of this restaurant.  

The meal: The fennel soup was outstanding; the beef short ribs melted in the mouth and the caramel custard was off the charts extraordinary - not the same ol' creme broulee that is ubiquitous today.  Paired with a nice right banc Merlot-based Bourdeaux from St. Emilion and I was totally satisfied.  I still rue my failure to sample the many other tantalizing options on the menu, especially the foie gras, the terrine and, of course, the cassoulet.  (Sigh) One has but one stomach.  As a result, I'll have to find a way to return to the Cleveland area."}
{"text":"Have been here on three separate occasions. Each time the food and service was wonderful. The atmosphere and decor is great.

My favorite items were the duck confit, trout with almond crust and the chocolate napoleon.

Really hard to find good french or french style food in the area but l'albatros nails it."}
{"text":"We are visiting Cleveland, and we just ate at L'albatros. It was wonderful! Not only was all the food great, but the cocktails were inventive and tasty! I feel like some restaurants try too hard, and the food and cocktails turn out strange. This meal, on the other hand, was delicious! We had three drinks, a cheese plate, a dessert, and two entrees for $100. It was a bit pricey, but it was worth it for a splurge."}
{"text":"Amazing food here. I ordered the frisée and bacon Larson salad and the porky belly was delicious. It had a runny yolk on top. 

Also had the cassoulet with duck confit sausage and pork belly. I switched out the lamb sausage for extra duck confit for an extra charge. 

Fried Cauliflower is the best!"}
{"text":"Exquisite French meals and charcuterie in Cleveland's University Circle district (next to Case Western Reserve University). Chef Z. Bruell is solid, as these dishes attest. If you come for L'Albatros' excellent happy hour, you can order the signature goat cheese tart (it truly is to die for) and the beer-soaked mussels for a deal.

The cocktails are intriguing -- especially all of the absinthe-focused concoctions.

Grade: A"}
{"text":"L'Albatros is a little slice of heaven. The atmosphere, food, service, drinks, music, seating...everything is utterly divine. I dined here this past Sunday night for the third time and after finishing my meal with my family, I've decided this place is officially my favorite restaurant in Cleveland. I said it!!

Cocktails - I enjoy a good martini and their menu is full of different concoctions. I ordered my usual vodka martini, no vermouth, straight up with blue cheese stuffed olives and it did not disappoint. 

Service - I normally never like hearing the specials because they always sound too complicated and overpriced but our server did a great job of explaining it short and sweet - a creamy fettuccine with kale, tomatoes and squash. It tasted even better than it sounded too. Our waitress was phenomenal. polite, quick and patient. The bussers and servers around us all worked as a team catering to everyone's tables, cleaning empty dishes, refilling waters, giving copious amounts of table bread. Ugh they are amazing!!

The food - OMG everything I've ever eaten here has been amazing. It is a French restaurant so I was unsure of what things were on the menu but after quick explanations and descriptions your mouth will water about everything. It's so hard to choose. From their soups and salads, to entrees and desserts, you will love it all!"}
{"text":"In the past, this was my favorite  place to dine. No more. The waiter  was the only positive. He was superb. The drinks were late, the salad was undressed. The artichoke was small and tasteless. They forgot to bring the sauce for the cauliflower until half way through the meal.  The trout was mediocre at best. ,. After all these years, sorry, I won't  return."}
{"text":"I was a big fan of \"Z\" back in the 90's, so the pedigree of this restaurant appealed to me. Wow! Dinner with a friend last weekend confirmed this. The setting is superb.  In the \"Circle\" in a charming building (house) with ample parking. We had the artichoke appetizer, which was delicious. I had the hanger steak with frites and béarnaise sauce, which was excellent. My friend had the Cod with sauerkraut and loved it. We had a nice bottle of a red Rhone and thought it was wonderful and well priced. 
Service was attentive, with water and bread regularly attended to and, while we lingered a bit during our meal, there was never any rush to move us out. Lovely  setting and great food. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The service is good, but the flavor is just not fit me. We ordered the cassoulet and duck confit. They all have too much meat and oil. I like something lighter. Plus, there is no French traditional dishes such as goose liver. Anyway, it's a good restaurant and not suitable for me."}
{"text":"We went during Zack Bruell's restaurant week.  Although I usually don't always like the restaurant week menu, and would rather try traditional menu offerings, I found my arm being very twisted to try the $30 prix fixe menu.   Our server was very talented at making each entree yummy and delicious and you know what?  He was spot on.  I started with the winter garden salad with blood orange vinaigrette and pistachios.  Perfect.  A wonderful mix.  Each flavor complemented the next and they went very well together.  Course two: I selected the Farro, winter vegetables and braised greens.  I was very satisfied with this mix.  It was a hearty grain mixture, and although I usually enjoy a hefty meat, I opted for this since I had veal and pork the night before.  I was not displeased.  It was flavored absolutely perfectly.  For dessert I tired the creme caramel.  What a delight to the palate!  My friend always guesses which drink I'll order, because she knows I love bourbon.  I opted for a drink with bourbon and orange bitters and I forget what else.  And I forget the name (but it was clever!) and it was yummy.  You can see this drink displayed in my current profile photo.  Wait!  \"Fashionably Late\"!  That was the name of the drink.  My friend Emmalyn enjoyed her meal immensely.  She had some sort of fish and the salad with radishes.  Both were excellent.  The original dessert we had sought out on the menu was a souffle made with grand marnier, but they had changed it up, so she opted for the cheesecake instead.  It proved to be a good second choice.  The ambiance was very cute.  The service was great.  I did not, however, enjoy the people begging for money outside.  I would absolutely return here again and perhaps try the short ribs.  I saw them on the table of the couple next to me and they looked phenomenal.  This being my second restaurant in the Zack Bruell group that I heavily enjoyed, I would have to say, Bruell is pretty much awesome."}
{"text":"LOVED it! The atmosphere is great and cozy in this old house. All 6 of us enjoyed our meals. Their French onion soup was amongst the best I ever had. We will definitely be back to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"French toast waz great. Lot of flavors. Complex. 
Duck confit is a huge portion and awesome taste. 
Chocolate Napoleon was just okay considering the appetizer and entree."}
{"text":"I really really liked the mahi mahi special for lunch, it wasn't dry at all, flavored to perfection."}
{"text":"Husband and I went to L' Albatross on a whim.  And oh, what a whim.  We started with the goat cheese tart -- HEAVENLY!  For our main course, he had the pork two ways, I had the scallops and we both had an amazing meal. To top it all off, he finished with the brownie and I with the fresh berries with creme fraiche.   Out of all of Zach Bruell's restaurants  (we've visited all four) this is my absolute favorite.  The atmosphere here is classic and modern.  They don't try to outdo themselves.  It's just a great place to have a fantastically prepared meal."}
{"text":"Cozy little restaurant with decent food and good service. Food items are definitely hit or miss. My trout was excellent but the pizzas were not very good. The mussels came covered in some kind of heavy sauce but the French fries were good. Seems like a very local place which was nice with lots of regulars. Skip the brownie dessert, it was dry and burnt with cherries inside, the creme caramel was much better."}
{"text":"One of my favorites in Cleveland! Every time we go here I practically have to be rolled home. I just can't contain myself from ordering a trillion things. The apps are so great and that's where I should stop. Buuuuuutttttery escargot, earthy eggy mushroom French toast, salty smokey pickles charcuterie platter. But I must go on. I waffle between the duck confit and the cassoulet. I tend to go to the cassoulet because then I can have a bite of all the different types of meats. My husband will usually order something on special. We have tried the hangar steak (a butter knife can cut it), walleye, and scallops, and others I can't even remember bc I'm usually going into a food coma. And then, THEN(!) we cheese board for dessert. It's like a bed time story having the dear server describe each of the 15-20 cheeses and alas I must settle on a few. Never one disappoints and the fig compote, honey, and toast points seal the deal for a most decadent meal."}
{"text":"Amazing French cuisine.  Excellent wine from Gigondas.  Had the Terrine du chef which was superb.  Main course was the Cassoulet.  All of it was fantastic.  

Cassoulet was a little heavy on the salt but it was so tasty it's forgiven.  For a French restaurant the portions are HUGE so beware when ordering appetizers.  No complaints as I came with large appetite.

Disappointing dessert menu.  Nothing really stood out or was traditional.  Skipped and went for an after dinner Beaumes du Venice Muscat.  

I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Solid place and good service. Good place for date night. Duck confit is definitely solid."}
{"text":"L'Albatros might be my favorite restaurant on Earth. The food is fantastic, (though certainly not the best on Earth), the service is attentive, the atmosphere is refined but comfortable, and the prices are reasonable. The different spaces of the restaurant, including an amazing patio, make it amenable to just about any occasion. It's the perfect combination of upscale and casual, and that combination makes it my favorite! L'Albatros arrived on the scene during my sophomore year at CWRU and it became a fixture in my life-- I met my boyfriend's parents here, I celebrated my 21st birthday here, I dined with academic advisors here, I celebrated my graduation here, I managed to convince friends that cocktails and cheese plates could indeed fit into the undergrad's budget and spent many afternoons indulging in a bit of high class procrastination at L'Albatros. Whenever I visit Cleveland I make a point to come here.

Favorites include: Frisee Salad, Split Pea Soup, Goat Cheese Tart, Pork Two Ways, Croque Monsieur, and the Chocolate Napoleon for dessert. My boyfriend also swears by the Cassoulet, and we never ever fail to order and devour the Charcuterie Platter. Getting a cheese plate is also always a great experience, the cheese guys are great with suggestions and always offer generous portions! The cocktail list rotates and we were both sad to see some of the old drinks go, but still love the Lavender Side Car, and since the Port of Call has been added, I almost never get anything else. (Side note: when the the drink list changed the bartenders were more than willing to offer up recipes for the old drinks when we asked). I also totally appreciate the fact that they serve cider!"}
{"text":"It was my first time to L'Albatros and I was very pleased. The milieu was great. Service was superb. We started off with the signature dish of \"french toast\" with mushrooms and balsamic syrup. It was good, but our second appetizer stole the show. In fact, the escargot was the best thing we ate there. It was amazing. My wife got the veal short ribs which were very tender, but I thought the risotto stood out. I ordered the cassoulet. The duck confit and pork belly were ok. The lamb was the best I ever had. The stars were the sausages though. The one sausage had raisins was unique and flavorful. I had a bordeaux to go with my meal and it was exquisite. For dessert, I ordered the warm chocolate brownie because we heard the next table raving about it. I am a chocoholic, so I love brownies. This brownie was very different. I would consider it a cross between a blondie and a brownie. It was sweeter than a typical brownie and not as choclatey, but it was good. It was a great meal and we will be back."}
{"text":"Phenomenal as usual.  Kim runs a great restaurant.  Food is consistent with a great taste profile.  They care how they blend each offering and the service is absolutely terrific.  IMHO the best restaurant in the CLE."}
{"text":"Went here with a group of people and half of us got the duck confit. It was a pretty disappointing dish. The portion was large but the duck meat was stringy and tough. The skin wasn't fully rendered and was sitting in a saucy bed of cabbage and got soggy. None of us finished our dishes. It just wasn't authentic or tasty. I did enjoy the French onion soup, which had inside with hearty chunks of tender beef--that was a tasty surprise. 

The ambiance of the restaurant was nice, but won't be going back. Service was good--no complaints there!"}
{"text":"Wow!!  What a fantastic experience.  We sat next to the cozy fireplace and enjoyed excellent service and food.  We both ordered Chicken Livers with Organic Polenta, Sauce and Herbs.  The complex flavors of the dish, along with the creamiest polenta ever, were heavenly.  Really looking forward to returning soon!"}
{"text":"We ate there twice while staying nearby at Glidden House..a very short walk through the parking lot.  We sat inside once and outside on the beautiful patio.  Highly recommend the patio if weather permits.  Very good French food that is not overly fussy.  Had the baked cod once and the steak frites once.  Both were delicious.  Their special salads were also very good and fresh.  Service is excellent, great wine selection and great desserts.  I also thought the pricing is very fair for what is an excellent dining experience.  Reservations seem key but there are a couple of bar areas where you could probably sit if there are just a couple of you."}
{"text":"Oh mon dieu!   Non!  Bon, ma campagne était satisfaite avec son poulet, mais les saveurs n'était pas trop complexes pour moi, escargot en entrée et coquilles Saint-Jacques comme plat, et en tout cas je ne pourrais goûter que du sel, du sel, même après avoir averti la cuisine plusieurs fois.  Même ma campagne qui est américaine et qui sale ces frîtes Macdo a trouvé sa soupe trop salée aussi que tout mes plats.  Les coquilles Saint-Jacques était parfaitement cuite, en revanche.  Mais, je trouve 3 coquilles Saint-Jacques pour un plat principale à 24 dollars à Cleveland un peu poussé.  Les nouilles était sans goût et fades.  Des légers notes de fenouil dans les escargots aurait était intéressant à goûter si je pouvais.  Les escargots aussi était très bien cuite et du bon qualité.  Dommage - mauvais nuit dans la cuisine?   Bon, je ne conte pas tester l'hypothèse.  Le fin- un espresso froid dans une tasse fissuré, c'est un peu la définition de mon expérience à l'Albatros."}
{"text":"We ordered the pea split soup and duck. Super tasty and their service is great!!! It is indicated as a $$$ sign restaurant but the price is quite reasonable there. I would say it is a $$ with $$$ quality."}
{"text":"To put it mildly, I was absolutely spoiled tonight. I was taken by my residency program for a dinner here, and it was fantastic. 

Just as a start, the staff here were wonderful. They refilled my water glass at least ten times, and they were so attentive with regard to refilling my bread plate that I had to just give away my bread plate to stop from overeating. And the bread itself was fantastic, of course!

For a first course, I had a whole artichoke. It was succulent and rich, and the aioli sauce, while a bit tangy for my taste, was objectively quite lovely. I also tasted a piece of escargot as well as a spoonful of the cream of cauliflower soup. Both were succulent and perfectly seasoned.

For my second course, I had their trout with asparagus. The presentation was beautiful (I ate so quickly I forgot to photograph!). The asparagus was still just slightly firm and the fish had a beautifully crispy skin. It was clearly a lovingly prepared dish.

To top it off, I ordered the frozen Grand Marnier souffle to end my evening. It had the perfect amount of sweetness and was a small enough portion that it merely topped off the evening rather than bloating it. I also had a taste of a friend's Napoleon, and it was exquisite. 

I will definitely come back here again, even if not on my program's dime! The meal was just fantastic."}
{"text":"Wow. As the reviews for this place clearly show, it is impressive. I can honestly say that I wanted to order everything on the menu all at once, but since my bank account won't let me, and I was trying to make a good impression on the lady I was with, I ordered the soup of the day, a fantastic cream of mushroom, and the Bianco pizza. Again, wow. 

It's going to be a long debate between my wallet and my stomach from now on as to how often I come here!"}
{"text":"Yes! Yes! yes! Amazing! Please order the French Toast! It will be such a wonderful decision. Also, be adventurous and order a cheese plate. Ask them to pick extra funky cheeses."}
{"text":"L'Albatros is one of my favorite hometown restaurants. I love French food and I have been going to L'Albatros since they opened. The reason that I love ALL Zack Bruell restaurants is because they are all fabulous! You will always get a great dinning experience at any of his resturants. Just the atmosphere alone is worth dinning at L'Albatros, the decor inside is very modern  and the patio is tranquil. While dinning here my faviorites have been...

ESCARGOTS with toasted garlic and fennel butter  

FRENCH TOAST with ragout of wild mushrooms and balsamic syrup 

FRISÉE AND BACON LARDONS WITH POACHED EGG with Xeres vinegar and Dijon 
mustard

SEARED SEA SCALLOPS with brussel sprouts, noodles and Pernod cream 

ROASTED TROUT WITH ALMOND CRUST with tomato confit, haricots verts and truffle butter

CONFIT OF CHICKEN with St. Paulin cheese, melted leeks, mushrooms and truffle butter

They also have phenomenal beef and pork dishes but I prefer poultry and seafood. They have their own garden that is outside of the restaurant for some of their vegetables and spices. The service is top notch and so is the food. I go here for a girls night out, special occasions, and date night with my husband. If I can find a reason to dine at L\"Albatros I AM THERE!

{"text":"First time here and it was perfect! I went with a group of friends and had the greatest pleasure in eating at this (I think the best place compared to all of Zack Bruell's other places) nice, classy fine dining restaurant. Dim lighting, jazz music playing in the background, felt like I was in a different city. 

To start, I had their  \"Meiomi\" Pinot Noir which was light and smooth. Not much of a dry aftertaste, just right. I had the chance to try my friend's Escargot and it was delicious. A bit heavy on the cream and salt but overall it was cooked right. For my entree, I had their duck confit which was absolutely mind blowing. The meat was cooked just right with the crisp skin on top, and the sweet potatoes mash with the caramelized cabbage altogether made this dish delightful to eat. The only thing I didn't get is the spinach garnish, to me I didn't think it had to be there. 

Definitely a place to show your out of townies' friends."}
{"text":"One of my very favorite Cleveland restaurants! Best steak I've had in the city, and possibly best steak ever. The hanger steak is always perfectly seared and flavorful, but I think it might be their béarnaise sauce that makes it. I almost always order it. 

Another favorite is the duck confit. It is usually fantastic. One time I ordered it and it was seriously dry; that was a disappointment but I guess everyone has an off day. 

The salads and appetizers are great- try the mushroom French toast!! 

They have a great wine selection and the servers are always very knowledgeable. 

Really love their outdoor patio. Perfect ambiance. Indoors is very nice too. Great restaurant. One of Cleveland's best."}
{"text":"We eat all over Cleveland and we eat out often. With this background we can honestly say, this is THE best restaurant in the CLE metropolitan area. AND it continues to get better and better rather then the opposite tact that often haunts most establishments. We could list the entire menu as our favorite because collectively we have tried almost everything, plus an assortment of specials. Gun to head I'd order the pied de Cochon and my wife the roasted cod, but no one need to bring armament, just the desire for a great dining experience."}
{"text":"When I first moved to Cleveland I thought I would miss the Toronto food scene. Boy was I glad to find L'Albatros! I came here for my birthday and was really good. Ambiance, decor, people...so cool. Food...amazing. I got the scallops and was just blown away. Definitely great for a special occasion! 

Only complaint, parking is a drag. They've got a lot but you have to pay (in cleveland? come on!) aaaand it's super full so we ended parking farther away"}
{"text":"Amazing food. I got the chicken breast on the menu, it was really good the sauce and how it was cooked.. Customer service was great as well."}
{"text":"This is still a solid 4 star experience for me.   A oouple of girlfriends and I met here for dinner.  We had a reservation and were seated immediately, served bread & olive oil (coarse salt and grainy mustard is placed on each table as an accompaniment) and proceeded to review the menu and order beverages.  I ordered a ginger ale and was give the option of Fever Tree ginger ale, the server mentioned that its selectively sold and includes bits of real ginger.   I proceeded to order it and it was, I must admit, very tasty.  I'll have to look for it in retail locations.  My dining companions had the sweet potato soup as a starter, I had the arugula & radicchio salad with shaved Parmesan, dressed in lemon and olive oil.   This is my favorite salad at L'Albatros and it didn't disappoint on this visit.  I am not a big beef eater, but I do like a nice hangar steak from time to time.  I order the steak and pomme frites.  I usually like my steak medium well, but the server suggested that I order it medium, so I took her advice and it was perfect.   The steak arrived sliced, slightly pink and covered in a tasty bearnaise sauce.  The pomme frites were equally good, but more like french fries than pommes frites.  We also ordered dessert.  I chose the Meyer Lemon Tart with meringue topping and pistachio crust.   It was a little disappointing, lots of, just ok, crust, I didn't really taste any pistachios.  Very little Meyer lemon filing and LOTS of meringue.  This was served on a warm plate, which was also a bit disappointing.     Service was great and our bread plate and water glass was never empty. All-in-all this was a very good meal, and I will definitely venture back!"}
{"text":"I love love love this restaurant. The food is always so fresh and delicious. While there aren't a lot of options for vegetarians, the white bean cassoulet is so good that I don't even care. I don't need any other option."}
{"text":"A 3-course meal at L'Albatros for $25? Only during Restaurant Week! Some fellow students and I jumped at this chance to fine dine in style without starving for a week to foot the bill (I jest, truly). We had reservations through OpenTable and were treated with utmost courtesy from our arrival. 

The dining area is dimly lit - good for blurring imperfections from your date or business partner, but not so great for pictures. It's also the place where you get the feeling that the waiters would silently be judging you for being on your phone anyways. A glass or two of wine certainly complements any meal here, so take your pick from the wine menu. If you're on a budget (which probably shouldn't be used in the same sentence as \"I'm dining at L'Albatros\", but whatever), some wines are available by the half-bottle, which we chose to split. 

I had a hard time ignoring the regular dinner offerings in favor of the Restaurant Week menu because everything sounded hearty and delicious. Cassoulet, duck confit, a variety of vegetarian and pescatarian-friendly options - worthy of a revisit when my pockets are deeper. For my three courses, I got the Gnudi, Grilled Swordfish, and Lemon Poundcake w/ Strawberry Ice Cream. Gnudi are gnocchi's lighter, chewier cousins, served in a mixture of savory vegetables and mushrooms. I found it a little on the richer, saltier side, but I tend not to use that much salt or butter in my own cooking. The swordfish was cooked evenly through and through, with perfect cross-hatching grillmarks. I probably could have inhaled it all in 3 bites, but etiquette and company demanded that I savor each bite. It was a very balanced dish, the only fault being that I wished the cherry tomatoes were fresher and juicier. The Beef Shortrib dish some of my other friends chose was divine. It was just an hour or so short of being pulled pork consistency; so tender, and a surprisingly large portion. It was served atop goat cheese potatoes au gratin, so definitely a heavier plate which made it difficult for them to finish dessert. I was thankful for the citrus tang of Lemon Poundcake and fresh strawberries to round out these flavors at the end. The Creme Caramel option looked and tasted a lot like flan. 

While eating we were definitely people-watching, and I couldn't help but notice the cheese cart making its way around. I don't even like cheese, but the fancy display and obvious pride in which the server presented options for tasting for those who ordered it made me curious. 

Throughout the meal the staff was wonderfully attentive even though they had a packed dining room to deal with. Complimentary bread and olive oil w/ salt and pepper was kept on our plates, water glasses never ran empty, and dishes cleared promptly. There were a few amusing instances of waiters in training awkwardly reaching around to deliver bread or being reprimanded for stacking plates on the tabletop, but it highlighted just how seriously they take the dining experience. Even though the setup forces you into close proximity with other diners, the service made it so each table felt like the center of attention."}

{"text":"Cleveland never seizes to amaze me. This is probably the best in its class. Classic French restaurant with an extensive menu. Very good for a date. Service was perfect. Food was even better. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Wow, a memorable day , took my better half on her birthday to this great French restaurant. Nice cozy place. Started off with the roasted artichoke with aioli. Took little time to figure out how to eat a whole artichoke. Thanks for the iPhone and google, we quickly learnt the art to eat the artichoke. The lemon aioli adds to the taste. Main course was the grilled chicken breast with mashed potato and aioli. Really well prepared and decorated. The pasta du jour was made of roasted cauliflower and spinach, would have preferred an Italian pasta from an Italian place. Dessert was chocolate Napoleon , we wish we had more space to try some of the others on the menu... But there is always a next time."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, great location, and fine environment for conversation. We ordered some seafood dishes, and we were happy with how they taste -- seafood was perfectly cooked with rich and balanced flavors. 

Our major complaint was the service. We got plenty of water and bread while we patiently waited for our server, but he just seemed to prefer other tables over ours. We waited a long time to be served, at least an hour after we were seated. Unfortunately, this was consistently an issue for both times we went. For the same price range and quality of food, I'd choose other restaurants in Cleveland area."}
{"text":"Wah wah weee woo. An EASY 5 star rating. Heck, I would give it 10 if I could! Delicious, divine, exquisite, phenomenal, decadent--literally all of the above. I felt like I was dining in NYC. We went for my birthday and it was all of our first time there. My Mother has already decided this is where we will go for her birthday, too and she doesn't even live in Cleveland. 

I had the best salad ( I think it had arugula) and french onion soup of my life. We also ordered escargot that is a must try. I really don't think you could go wrong with anything on the menu and we had a really hard time narrowing it down to just one entree each but somehow managed and loved it all. Even the dessert was to die for ( we ordered 2 and shared between the 3 of us.) 

They offer some out of this world cheese selections that looked like a meal in itself. I was tempted to order even though I am lactose intolerant- that is how incredible it looked! The service was on its A game. They kept the yummy bread and water coming nonstop. We were finishing up our meal around 9:30-10p.m. and people were STILL filing in and it was just as busy as it was when we had arrived- prime indicator of how great it is. I just cannot say enough things and am very anxious for the next L'Albatros experience. 

The only negative is that they charge $3 for parking....."}
{"text":"I love, love French food. When I think of L'arbatros I think of cassoulet. It is my favorite dish in the restaurant, and the one that makes me go back to the restaurant time after time. I was determined to have something different during my last visit so I had the pork two ways, and it was great. That pork belly really delivered a punch of flavor; the pork shank had a flaky consistency (which was not pretty) but the flavor was actually very, very good. It came with a beautiful mustard sauce, and fried cauliflower. I wasn't impressed with their salad special (arugula, goat cheese and peach or apricot?). It was weird because I could see the ingredients, but I could not really taste them; the flavors were not there. All I could actually taste was the dressing, which was just ok. The drink I had was DE PECHE MODERN, which was based on bourbon and peaches. It was also disappointing (too watery, not enough bourbon nor peach flavor (and it was way too expensive). The coffee (Kenya) and the dessert (Meyer lemon tart) were very good and helped ending my experience on a positive note. - Angel - www.healthyroadadventures.blogspot.com"}
{"text":"This place is wow. The choucroute garnie was a real standout - super meatful but so worth it. The escargot was probably the best I've ever had. I liked my trout and potato soup and artichoke with lemon aioli - everything we ordered had a subtly complex and delicious flavor. Go you, Cleveland."}
{"text":"Enjoyed an awesome luncheon with my wife at L'Albatros in the University Circle area this afternoon. We started with Chicken Liver and Fois Gras Mousseline with toast points and glasses of Duval-Leroy, Brut, Clos des Bouveries, Vertus, 2004 Champagne. Then Roasted Artichokes with Lemon Aioli, Mushroom soup with shaved Parmesan, and an entree of Duck Confit with sweet potato puree and braised cabbage. Accompanying the entree, I had an unbelievable Vouvray, Huet, \"Le Mont,\" Sec, 2010 while my wife enjoyed a red wine, Malbec, Clos La Coutale, Cahors, 2011. For dessert we had the Chocolate Napoleon with whipped cream and raspberries, French-pressed Jamaican coffee, and Cointreau. I love this restaurant."}
{"text":"A fantastic restaurant. From the cheese plate to their wine dinners this place is always a treat. The staff is courteous and friendly and the food is reasonable and delicious."}
{"text":"Solidly good food and a respectable dining experience, but nothing spectacular that draws me back, especially with imperfections / variability in the food and service. I dined here mainly to claim the right to say that while in Cleveland I ate Zack Bruell's food, and for that I'm very glad I gave L'Albatross a try. 

The lemon pound cake is a must -- 5 stars! -- and if you also get lucky in your waiter and in being seated in the classic exposed-brick-and-tasteful-chandelier half of the restaurant, you will rave about the magnificent service and magical, romantic mood. 
-----

FOOD: 
The bread & olive oil they bring you is really good! You can also add mustard (with the actual mustard seed, not the artificial yellow kind). 

The duck confit ($24) was smoky and flavorful, with a nicely crisp skin. My favorite part is how well the sweet potato + the slightly tart tomato-y sauce complimented the salty duck, while also adding soft texture and moistness. The cabbage was lightly pickled and just barely acidic, but tasted strongly of a medicinal mystery herb -- interesting at first before the perfumey herb became too much. 
I could have used much more sauce, a little more sweet potato, and wayyy less cabbage, but that's just me. All in all, a solid but not memorable dish. 

The pistachio cake with burnt butter cream frosting ($8) was not that good. The orange flavor was way too overpowering, especially when the menu doesn't even mention citrus. I don't know whether it was the buttercream or the entire cake that caused it, but every bite made me mouth feel oily and buttery. 

The lemon pound cake dessert ($7) with strawberry ice cream and balsamic vinegar, however, was PERFECT. It was BEAUTIFULLY balanced in every way, and such a delicious flavor marriage. I could rave about this forever!! 
So I will -- 
First, the audible crackle. What's that? Before your tongue can taste, your ears are awoken by a soothingly soft series of popping sounds like slow-mo crisp sizzling of freshly fizzing bubbles. The scarce orange pop rocks sprinkled over the food elevated the dish beyond a good taste, into a  standalone sensory experience. 
Next, the lemon pound cake. It was barely buttery and dense enough to be called a pound cake, and reminded me more of plain cake, light and fluffy. I thought this was the perfect balance of richness and lightness. Clear but not overpowering lemon fragrance. 
Most important, the balsamic. I couldn't see it, but it's there, a thin drizzling sitting at the bottom of the plate, lightly seeping into the waiting sponge of cake. It's just enough to add that perfect finishing flavor, but not enough for you to say, \"Ah, there is the balsamic\" -- it simply blended into the dish and elevated all the other flavors. 
Finally, the fresh strawberry ice cream and strawberries were very good too, and nicely tart. 

SERVICE: 
Day 1: Extremely professional and attentive, worthy of admiration. I typically don't care about service style or quality, yet L'Albatross was so wonderful that I've realized what I've been missing all my dining-out life. 
-- Bread & oil and water are brought to you immediately and quietly, as the waiter slips in and out without disturbing you at all. Bread is replaced immediately after you've finished it, and water is refilled often. Good service is invisible service -- when your needs are met seamlessly by someone who blends in to the restaurant atmosphere, so you never are aware of being served. 
-- Our waiter was very enthusiastic but still professional, and took it with a smile when we told him we only wanted dessert after he had already recited all the specials. He was so convincing though that after hearing his lovely monologue, I nearly ordered a second dinner. 

Day 2: Similar, but the waiter gave the impression of a chill So Cal bro more so than an upscale food expert. We asked to split an entree but to please serve it on one plate, but received two plates of pre-divided food instead. Paying & leaving took a bit longer than expected. 

ATMOSPHERE: Romantic and classy. Simple plates and plain tablecloths lit by the warm glow of a single candle. Quiet chatter, glass windows half-obscured by green plants, and dim chandelier lighting create an intimate and personal feel.  

But then you one night you're seated somewhere else and it's plain white linen booths on two sides with a view of an extremely boring, plain painting and bland walls, and you feel like you just got sent to a real estate showing of Suburban Living Room #XFLH238

So, it's all very variable. Best case -- magical dining experience. Worst case -- average dining experience at a premium price. Worth the gamble."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant recently.  I arrived in town late with no reservation and the restuarant was crowded.  However, they were willing to work with me and get me in quickly.  Even with the crowd, my order was taken quickly and my food arrived after a short wait.  The food was excellent and I returned the next night for more.  The place seemed as if would be a nice place to take a date but not a place to take children.  I will probably visit the next time I am in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Yep this place really does deserve five stars, Don't hesitate just go.  Everything from ambience to wait staff to bar staff to quality to service is amazing.  My wife and I were with another couple and one of my buddies recommended the hanger steak and all three of them ordered it and all three of them were very impressed. I personally had the pan fried walleye with Green beans and it truly was off the charts amazing. Our waiter was fantastic as he was very generous with his time and not pushy in anyway shape or form, the rest of the staff and he were quick to fill water glasses, bread and olive oil, and refresh drinks from the bar at the appropriate times.  We had to rush out for a show so we didn't stay for dessert but an item that caught my eye was the cheese platter as I walked by the prep area and saw stacks and stacks of beautiful artesian cheese ready for slicing.  We plan to go back for another visit when we have more time to truly enjoy the full experience as we were a bit rushed to head out to our show downtown.  The prices were amazingly reasonable considering the level of quality service and ingredients, Main dishes were between 18 and $25 and I forgot to mention we had salads to start which were also off the hook amazing and what was nice is they allowed my wife and I to share a salad which made the portion just perfect"}
{"text":"After much review reading and indecision, I decided that this was the best place to take my wife for our 3rd anniversary.  What a good decision I made!  I was impressed with the service, ambiance, and most of all the prices.  I had the duck and she had the chicken, I had 2 $15 glasses of french pinot noir and she had 1 glass of reisling, PLUS we had escargot for an appetizer and our bill was just over $100, after tax.  For such excellent food, service and ambiance, this was a steal!  I highly recommend this place, plus the location is excellent for an after dinner walk.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"as with most reviews, i start out with the caveat of, i'm vegetarian. however, this time i really don't have to. which is kinda even more amazing since this is a french restaurant. french food is not known to be vegetarian friendly. in fact, quite the opposite.
i asked the waiter like a million questions about the menu. he was helpful and patient, as i changed my mind three times.
i wanted to try everything on the menu that was vegetarian but given that i had to stay within some sort of reasonable budget, i went for an appetizer and a side, the \"french toast\" and the crispy breaded cauliflower. wow they were both super tasty. the french toast, i can't even describe the flavors in my mouth. it was light and fluffy, with balsamic drizzle, mushroom ragout and buttery sauce. it just melts in your mouth. the cauliflower, cripsy and breaded is pretty self descriptive.
my friend had the mussels. she said they were good.
i really never go to these fancy places. the most i can stomach to pay for a meal is 30/person. if i were to dine as usual without regard for the prices, this would have been easily a 50/person sort of place for me. or more. i have a feeling i'll be back though, but probably on a special occasion."}
{"text":"The ambiance and service simply transports you... and their patio is stunning in the warmer months. I could eat the French Toast with mushrooms and melty cheese over and over-- it's that good! The cheese offerings look great too, they bring out an entire cart and make a big production of it.  I've never personally ordered it but I have seen others get it.  This is a great place to bring your out-of-town foodie friend to impress them."}
{"text":"This place is arguably one of the best places I've had the pleasure of dining.  Wonderful selection of deliciously prepared meals and equally wonderful and attentive staff.  This is certainly my place for business dinners, especially when I want to impress.  And it certainly helps out to put my wife \"in the mood\"!  Love this place and will continue to come as often as I can!"}
{"text":"We lived in Cleveland for five years and know that the area has a lot offer diners. However, despite the plentiful options we always seemed to end up in L'Albatros from the occasional date night dinner. Hidden in University Circle with easy access and parking, the decor is sophisticated and romantic (aka - dark) with a nice ambiance. Most importantly, the food is delicious. We always start with the escargots (or as we call them \" amazing garlic butter goodness\"). My husband usually has the duck confit and I'm more the experimenter. The only thing I ate I didn't enjoy was the burger - too charred on the outside for my taste. 

Pros - excellent food
         - knowledge and friendly waitstaff
         - quiet
         - tasteful decor 
         - not kid friendly

Cons - a bit pricey 
          - the atmosphere can be a bit pretentious
          - not kid friendly 

If you haven't tried it, you should!"}
{"text":"Beautiful food!  Nice variety on the wine list, and plenty of options for my vegan dining companion. So lovely!"}
{"text":"Three words: Goat. Cheese. Tart.

Those three words are enough reason to fly in to Cleveland to dine at L'Albatros. 
Heavenly rich but light at the same time with that delicious goat cheese tang on a buttery crust, served with a side of punchy olive pesto. It is perfection. Would go great with a glass of sancerre.

What can I say, L'Albatros has proven again and again each time I dine that they are one of Cleveland's finest restaurants to dine at, offering both excellent food and excellent service.

Each dish, is prepared and plated with so much finesse and attention to detail, the end result is a confident dish, that truly stands on its own. They don't go overboard with their presentation either, you won't find any dish decorated with a constellation of chopped parsley (often a bad sign!). Each dish has a variety of textures and tastes that work together beautifully 

I remember the first dish I ever ordered, the pork two ways, a masterpiece of sorts. The dish is composed of braised pork shank wrapped in (im guessing - caul fat?), a perfectly seared pork belly, side of fried cauliflower, and pickled onions. This dish is definitely on the heavy side (pork belly and fried cauliflower), but the acidity from the pickled onions really helped cut through the grease. For a pork lover like myself, this dish was incredible and definitely hit the spot! I remember noting to myself right then and there that it was the best dish I've had in Cleveland.

I've only had two dish that was subpar (they were specials of the day - risotto with a side of pork belly & a vegetable noodle dish), the noodles, while deliciously homemade, were swimming in a broth that tasted a little funky (like a veggie broth gone wrong); the other dish, was a perfectly cooked risotto (very al dente and creamy just the way i like) served with a big piece of porky belly. The pork belly was cooked well, but the piece we got was just overly overly fatty, even for me. But aside from these two minor things, I've never had a bad experience here.

If you are a wine and cheese connoisseur, there is perhaps no better place for a tasting of exotic cheese and wine. Their cheese expert, knows his stuff and can give you the back story and makings of their huge assortment of cheeses as well as pairing recommendations. I went for a wine and cheese pairing one time and learned a great deal from the cheese-ologist. One cheese I remember in particular - Foot cheese, funny enough, it smelled like feet, tasted like feet, I do not recommend.

The wait staff really takes care of you, and at time are quite entertaining. They put customers first and make sure you have a great experience. Just an example: During my first lunch there, I had asked a waiter where the bathroom was, as he led me to the bathroom, any staff member that saw us coming, even if they were carrying a heavy loads of plates, instantly stopped what they were doing and backed against the wall to allow us to pass. 

The restaurant itself is beautiful. Like an art gallery of sorts, very three dimensional, with a blend of white linen and brick walls, it provides a chic, yet warm vibe.

L'albatros has all the elements down, from food, to service, to decor, they really know what they are doing. And while professional, they maintain a lax atmosphere. The food consistently impresses without fail ..especially that goat cheese tart, try it!

Food: A-
Atmosphere: A
Service: A

ps- right now (october) is a great time to get their mussel with fries! they are at their peak season, and what's better than cozying up with a bowl of juicy mussels basting in a rich aromatic broth? What's more, the mussels are topped with some of the best fries in town!"}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible. Came here for my birthday dinner and I was just floored by the food! Had the smoked salmon and artichoke appetizers and the duck (with sweet potato and cabbage) as an entree, everything was perfect and had well balanced flavor! Beyond impressed."}
{"text":"We had a very enjoyable anniversary dinner at L'Albatros. Our server was extremely knowledgeable, especially as our fromagier. She new every detail about the cheese board, and guided us to an excellent selection of cheeses! The french onion soup was the best I have ever tasted. There was an abundance of brisket in the soup which was a welcome surprise! We each had the Croque Monsieur and the Chicken Confit. We couldn't have been more pleased with our meals and portion sizes, and can't wait to come back for future anniversaries!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice.  Loved both times.    Get the Cheese board!"}
{"text":"Food is always good, service is occasionally lacking.  Cool atmosphere. Good wine list and cocktails. Would return."}
{"text":"This has been one of our favorite restaurants in Cleveland. We used to go often as we are very involved with the arts and University Circle.  Last Fall we went for dinner and the meal was horrible. Everything was cold, undercooked and the desert was still frozen when they served it. After 6 months we decided to try again and hoped for the best.  Our meal last night was not edible. Raw Mussels were served to 2 of the people at the table and the overall quality was horrible. They waitress was friendly and exchanged the raw mussels for new plates however we were all a bit disgusted and could not eat. When they cleared the table nobody ever bothered to ask why we didn't eat any of the food.  We decided to order desert since we were still hungry and the desert was like something off of a shelf in a cheap grocery store.  The did give us one of the 4 Mussels we ordered for free however that was really not sufficient,  It was still over $250.00 for a horrible meal. I called to let the manager know however I was told the manager was \" busy\" and so far nobody has Called.  The service and quality of the food has gone down hill and I would not give our recent meals to a stray dog on the street.. Its sad"}
{"text":"a coworker of mine recommended that i check out l'albatros years ago.  i finally got the chance last week, and here's what i felt about it...

parking/directions/area: i knew it was in the university circle area, near case western and severance hall.  my date and i did not park in the lot, rather we circled around until finding a space about 3 minutes walking distance.  mind you, this was around 830, 9pm on a thursday night.  

environment/decor/atmosphere: i tend to look at a restaurant's interior design more so than others, so one of the first things i noticed was the contemporary feel w the brick walls, lovely subdued lighting (great for dates!) and oddly enough, i mentioned to my date that winter-time dining must be fantastic w the view out the window on the patio.  however, the restaurant did resemble a maze at times, the seating arrangements are quirky (my date had an issue w the couch seats) and the patio seemed common, banal even.  also, the bathroom seemed tight and the door was too close to the stall and sink.

food/servers: our servers were nice, informative, and gave us time to select our choices without feeling rushed.  nothing bad to say on that level.  food-wise, the arugula salad is VERY GOOD.  flavorful and a wonderful precursor to the entree...

i had my eye on the hanger steak but opted for the salmon w lentils.  honestly, ive had better salmon.  not bad, but i was expecting a bit more flavor.  my other half had some type of shrimp bisque combination which was very tasty.  i forget the name of this as its an entree that is a special and as such may not be on the menu that much longer.

overall, i was pleased w the environment and service...but next time ill pick another plate and hopefully my opinion of the food will be a bit better."}
{"text":"Do chefs ever coast?

Do restaurants ever go on auto-pilot after years of stellar reviews?

I think so.  Which is the ONLY reason I'm adding to the already massive list of reviews of L'Albatros, as our experience is so very different from previous reviewers'. 

Sunday night, four of us celebrating two birthdays, decide we should try L'Albatros, based on local as well as out-of-town glowing recommendations. It is considered a \"destination\" restaurant.  Parking, as noted, is a couple bucks.  No valet, no validation.  The place is a \"re-purposed\" coach house and as such has rather peculiar lay-out and decor.  We were led to the fireplace room, which was quiet and pleasant enough, but two of us were seated on white, plastic chairs.  Inside.  Not on the patio, where perhaps those would have been acceptable.  Our water glasses were delivered, and soon some pretty great bread and olive oil arrived. (Those water and bread servers were on their game, the whole evening, and that bread could have been my entire meal, it was that good.)

Our waiter arrived, chatted us up a bit.  Cardboard menus that looked, like the room, as if they were last refreshed during the Reagan administration. Very well-spoken, perfect pronunciation of the rather-challenging French menu items, took our drink orders.  (Two mixed drinks, one bottle of wine.  All really great.)  On his return he explained the specials, answered a few questions and was off.  At this point while the patio was already pretty full, our room was mostly empty.

Two ordered the escargot, served in small Dutch oven-type crocks, and both declared as fabulous in taste, temperature, presentation.  One also ordered the oysters, again nicely presented and tasty.

Here endeth the three stars of the review, and the start of the subtraction of two stars.

As this was a \"milestone\" birthday, and I wanted to focus on our time together, I kept most of this to myself during the meal, and in no way fault our server or partially even the kitchen, as they were given no opportunity to make things right, for us.  I do, though, want others to know that even great places can have an off night, or get a bit lax.  A few of these are pretty minor quibbles, but others I think might signify a lapse either in the kitchen or by the management.

All four entrees were \"serviceable,\" at best.  A chicken dish was so undercooked it was bloody.  Salmon, while prepared as ordered, was bland to the point of flavorlessness.  (We took three of the four home, nearly untouched, hoping to \"re-prepare\" them and so not waste the food; the lentils served with the salmon actually had sand and a rock in it, which we discovered the following day.  I say that again as a disclaimer, that the kitchen was NOT given a chance to make things right.  But, honestly.  If that's something they sent to table?  I'm not sure there would have been any point in sending it back.)

Two drinks, one bottle wine, three apps, four entrees, no deserts.  Four hundred bucks.  I've spent as much and more at other places around the world.  But then again have nearly always felt we received at least that in value.  L'Albatros?  I doubt I would have felt I got my money's worth at a quarter that cost.  

(As an aside, they have no dress code.  Not sure ANY restaurant has one, these days.  As such, seated right next to me was a man wearing a wife-beater, shorts and flip-flops.  At dinner.  On Sunday.  In what their website describes as a \"fine dining restaurant.\"  Again, please understand:  I am NOT faulting L'Albatros for this.  Just added to the disappointment, I suppose.  And that lug was not alone; many others were, to be kind, \"under-dressed\" for a place that is considered in the top tier of Cleveland restaurants.)

If you've come this far, here's my conclusion:  A visitor to Cleveland might peruse for example Zagat's and see at the very top of their ratings for restaurants L'Albatros.  On one night, not only wasn't it the best, it really wasn't even very good.  Many consider it their go-to place for special occasions, and more power to them.  I have asked a few after our experience, if maybe they weren't relying on tradition, going to a place that perhaps has slipped a few notches, yet their fondness masks problems?  Are they thanking a great chef for years of groundbreaking work and investment in Cleveland by casting a blind eye?  Based on one visit, I don't consider L'Albatros for recommendation, let alone top-tier status.

{"text":"I've eaten at L'Albatros twice. Once, when it first opened last December -- and just last week on May 1st. Both times were at lunch. I was very impressed with the lunch in December. Zach Bruel was the chef that day and everything tasted fantastic... unbelievable! I ordered the cassoulet and it was perfection. The duck confit, the sausages, the beans -- everything was delicious.
I'm sorry to say that last Friday's lunch was lacking. I wanted to order something different -- but I couldn't. I was so crazy about the cassoulet that I ordered it again. This time the duck was tasty -- but way more fatty that the first time. The sausages were not great and hardly cooked -- in fact, one of the sausages was a knockwurst, slightly warmed through. The beans were more like a \"ladle full\" of rather soupy, sweet baked beans. I never really tasted any garlic in the dish. My mother ordered the roasted scampi  on a bed of spaetzels. When her dish arrived, the scampi was placed on parsley buttered noodles -- no spaetzels. 
I have to say that Zach was not in the kitchen that day. Maybe it just depends on who is doing the actual cooking as to how dishes are sent out of the kitchen. I was kind of bummed. 
I love the carriage house space L'Albatros is in (I was a big That Place on Bellflower fan -- and was happy to learn that L'Albatros was going in there). I will go back again... someday. Maybe in another 6 months. I hope that my experience last week was just an \"off\" day for L'Albatros."}
{"text":"Expectations were high. After all, coming from renowned local restaurateur Zach Bruell (a la Parallax, Cowell & Hubbard, Table 45) why wouldn't they be as such? It turns out that it was a wonderfully decadent and memorable dining experience from beginning to end. An experience that, at least for the two diners represented by this review, served to remind us that exceptional dining is indeed alive and well in the Cleveland area if you just know where to look.

A few notes before I continue:

Inform your server if you plan to share any of your dishes. The kitchen will actually create two identical half-size platings. A brilliant touch.

Yes, it's expensive and yes it's worth every penny. I know it'll be a challenge, but go into this with a mindset to avoid ordering based on price.

Parking will cost you $3 in their private, attended lot unless you manage to score a street spot nearby.

If wine is your thing their extensive list will not disappoint. If beer is your deal, 3 of the 4 draught lines are dedicated to local brews. Else-wise, some strategic cherry-picking of the bottles list should yield some tasty results. Look for the Gavroche. It's an amber malt-forward French bier de garde and it's delicious.

Shall we continue? Right this way, please.

As others have confessed, we too have had L'Albatros bookmarked for years. It was a destination awaiting an occasion. We finally pulled the trigger for our 16th anniversary dinner. A Monday evening, 6:15 reservations, beautiful September weather and patio seating. I can't comment much on the interior space as the length of time I spent within it lasted as long as the walk from the front door to the patio, but one thing I did notice was how dimly lit it was. I have a feeling that their average diner would struggle to read the menu. As for the patio, it's a cozy, garden-like nook , beautifully landscaped and surrounded by the historic buildings that make up the restaurant. One minor annoyance was the rather loud air conditioning unit that kept kicking on and off during our meal. 

The service we received during our dinner was world-class. Our host was kind, congenial, and demonstrated a seemingly effortless approach to what I have no doubt is a tiring profession. She made us feel as welcome guests and not as burdensome customers. She was incredibly knowledgeable, meandered through the daily specials with a well-rehearsed, flowing ease, and just generally made our special evening a delight. We were also never wanting for either water or bread, as the attendants that flitted about the patio made sure that both were constantly replenished.

Let me just say it. Everything we put into our mouths was ridiculously delicious. Hugely flavorful, perfectly seasoned, wondrously aromatic, beautifully plated, buttery, goodness. I think that about sums it up, but I know you're wanting some details.

\"French Toast\" - Get this dish. Don't think about it, just get it. A unique and savory take on the breakfast classic. Soft, eggy bread triangles, seared to crispy-edged perfection topped with an umami blast of wild mushrooms and a drizzle of slightly sweet aged balsamic syrup. Shaves of Romano cheese and a beautiful edible flower. More. That's what you'll say after the first bit.

Salad of FrIsee with Bacon Lardons and Poached Egg - About as good as a salad can get. The lettuce, fresh and crisp tendrils, was dressed in a touch of vinegar and tossed with house-made crouton and smoky, crunchy, fatty bits of bacon. Cutting into the egg released a creamy, yolky river that added a wonderful fattiness and delicious compliment to the bite of the acid.

Cassoulet - A signature dish of L'Albatros and a meat-centric wonder that I'd happily eat every day. I mean, how often does one get to enjoy pig, duck and goat in one pot? Braised white beans, rough-chopped carrots and parsnips, goat shoulder, duck confit, pork belly, and sausages. Pardon my drool. There's so much going on in this dish. The meats were all fork-tender. The herbs an olfactory feast. So. Damn. Good. I want to eat this in the dead of winter as I lounge next to a roaring fire with a blizzard hammering angrily on my door with snow fists.

Braised Shoulder of Goat -  My wife has a soft spot for goat shoulder. That's not weird at all, right? This dish was a goat showcase. Wisps of gaminess, fatty, unctuous. Everything goat needs to be. The meat haplessly yields to the fork atop a bed of tender, gently toothsome \"risotto\" of pearl pasta. Shaves of Romano, crumbles of goat cheese and slivers of sundried tomato. Incredibly flavorful and filling.

Apple Cake with Praline Ice Cream - Complete with a candle in honor of our little celebration and a drizzle of creme anglaise, this was a perfect end to a wonderful dinner. The ice cream, Mitchell's, was smooth, creamy, buttery and filled with crispy, nutty praline throughout. A perfect textural foil to the brownie-sized piece of soft, warm apple cake. Not overly sweet and just the right amount."}
{"text":"L'Albatros is definitely among my favorite fine dining restaurants in Cleveland. Nestled right in the middle of University Circle, the surrounding bohemian neighborhood consists of cultural gems such as Severance Hall, The Cleveland Museum of Art, Case Western Reserve and Wade Oval. This is a great dining option either before or after watching the Cleveland Orchestra -- rated as among the best orchestras in the world (they perform in Vienna for crying out loud).

My dishes of choice: any of the daily specials that are printed on the menu -- especially the fish. I'd include: escargot, mushroom french toast, duck cassoulet, duck confit, chicken confit... I'm sure I'm forgetting something, but once again, you can't go wrong.

The exterior is rather unassuming, much like Cleveland -- looks like nothing on the surface, but deep inside you'll find easy-going richness, culture, and pure awesomeness in a package that is lovable and unpretentious."}
{"text":"Hostess greeted me with a warm smile. Bartender was very attentive. The bar was very clean. Managers were engaging with staff AND guests. Pork Rillete was incredible (one of the best I've ever had).  The Duck Confit makes you want to start a flash mob of happiness down the street with butterflies flapping around and Michael Jackson moonwalking alongside with a Pepsi in hand and a flashy glove. Great meal and I'll definitely come back!"}
{"text":"3.5/5.0
I went with a pretty large group for a friends birthday. the service there is really nice. everyone is super friendly and the waitress knows her menu and specials.

I got the chicken liver foie gras mousseline for an appetizer. it was amazing and the serving size was quite large that I shared with everyone else (they all loved it too)

The entrees however are not so on point. they are about average. the waitress suggested the lamb but it was barely mediocre... the lamb I usually get is way better. A friend shared her Duck Confit with me and I think it's only about average as well. I'd say go with their seafood, and also stay away from the steak and fries (the steak so small that my friend thought the fries were the main thing)

Anyway I enjoyed my night there and I was really fond of their friendliness."}
{"text":"This little gem tucked in by Case Western Reserve University serves up some really interesting french cuisine. This Zach Bruell menu can be a bit intimidating, with Skate Wing, Pig's Foot, and Escargot among others. However, if you just trust the chef, I've yet to try a meal here that I haven't enjoyed.

The service is very good. I challenge you to actually finish off a glass of water. None of my friends could.

The atmosphere is so much fun. It is sophisticated and romantic, but at the same time is full of young, interesting people. The restaurant is very busy, and the bar is always full of energy. Make reservations for dinner! Also, during the summer their outdoor patio is outstanding.

Last note, if you love cheese, you HAVE to try the cheese plate. A formagier (cheese expert, like a sommelier is to wine) will come to your table with literally dozens of cheese neatly organized on a huge wooden cutting board. After explaining in detail where each cheese is from and what its flavor is like, she will arrange the cheeses of your choice for you, providing accompaniments like fig spread and bread. I'm not much for cheese, but it was impressive, and my friends were blown away by the cheeses offered. They will even help you arrange an off-site wine and cheese pairing party!"}
{"text":"I lived in Cleveland for three years while I was in law school, and now having lived in LA for a few months, this is the one place I truly miss. This restaurant is absolutely not to be missed. Almost every important occasion over those three years for me happened here, and I can assure you that those memories will stay with me and my family for a lifetime. The food is excellent, but that's not what makes this place a must-visit. The beautiful patio, friendly staff, and mood-setting atmosphere are all just perfect. I had intimate anniversary dinners here, a large graduation party, and important meetings with professors and fellow students. If you are wondering where to go tonight - or any other night - in Cleveland, this is the place.

I should have written this review years ago. Kim, the manager here, is the gold standard. Don't waste another second reading reviews or deciding where to go. Head to L'Albatros and enjoy this Cleveland gem."}
{"text":"I hate to be the person who had many good experiences and then writes a review after a bad one, but my last two times dining at L'albatros were as a solo, middle aged, female diner, and the service was so unbelievably poor in comparison to previous occasions as to make me think that it must be a policy. 
On both occasions, lunch and dinner, I was not told about the specials, although I heard the same server explain them to tables near me. At dinner, the server said \"thank you!\" after everything I ordered, in a tone that suggested that I was an idiot that she did not expect to know how to order food and wine in a restaurant. She did not use this tone with her other tables, and even suggested a chefs choice tasting menu.
The lunch was just ridiculous, I was basically ignored while other tables were fawned on. If you have ever eaten at L'Albatros, you know just how unacceptable it is that I sat in front of my extremely salty mussels with no water or bread. My water was eventually refilled, but I was never offered more bread. The mussels were also mushy and fishy. The fries were good, but also overly salted.
After sitting for ten minutes at an empty table waiting for a bill, my credit card was returned with someone else's bill. This was corrected, but with a less than even perfunctory apology.
I've had some great meals there, and might return, but never alone."}
{"text":"Been to this restaurant many times, most recently this week.  As usual as good as it gets in the Cleve.  Was eating a late lunch by myself and felt very welcomed.  Hostess and waiter very courteous.

Bread and olive oil given as usual.  Ordered chicken liver and fois gras mousseline to start, came out quickly with the usual accouterments.  Rich and savoray as usual, and pickles were good on the side.  For lunch, ordered the Croque monsieur.  Sandwich was a bit soggier than I was expecting, but otherwise very tasty.  The waiter did actually ask if I wanted the bechamel sauce on the side, but it really was very good the way it came.

Anyway, just had a quick stop-in to get lunch, and food and service were top notch as usual.  I have always preferred to dinner to lunch at L'albatros, but its hard for me to NOT eat here."}
{"text":"5 stars each and every time! When food is done right in this town, they roll out a plush red carpet! The last few times my fiancé & I patronized L'Albatros they truly did their best to impress! We were given the attention of their delightful sommelier--he completely flattered us with his limitless knowledge of Prosecco;  we ended up with 2 bottles to celebrate our date night! Dinner was fantastic (Almond-crusted Salmon)! My favorite highlight: Ordering their favored French toast appetizer--one simply cannot visit this place without having it!"}
{"text":"Came here with a large group last night. The restaurant itself is in a historic building but is updated with modern interior and furniture. 

To start off, we sampled cheeses with red wine (don't remember the name of the wine). The sampler had 7 1-oz portion of cheeses that we chose from 20+ variety. My favorite of the bunch was the one with \"ash\" on it. It had a smooth milder taste and didn't have a weird texture or after taste. 

I ordered the pork two ways as my main. It's braised pork shank with pork belly. The portion was pretty big and was served with deep fried breaded cauliflower. The pork belly and shank was seasoned in a similar way but I felt that both were a bit too salty. The pork belly was cooked very nicely with the skin almost in a jelly-like state. The shank on the other hand was a bit overcooked. The shank was mushy and much saltier than the pork belly. I wasn't able to finish the dish due to having wine and appetizers, but also in part that it was a bit too salty. I think this dish would go well with some raw fresh vegetables. 

I've been here previously for lunch and would easily rate those a 4 or 5.
Based on last night's main course, I would rate this a 3. However, with its great atmosphere and service. I would give this an overall 4."}
{"text":"What can I say I've got a thing for French cuisine and L'Albatros is my favorite restaurant, Edwin's of course is a close second! The simplistic yet elegant decor is warm and inviting creating a very intimate atmosphere that seems to energize the enthusiastic patrons that drop by. I began my exploration of the unmatched facility at a private dinner party out on the patio several years ago and from there I've been hooked. The food is artfully prepared, with fresh ingredients that tempt you into wanting to pack a sleeping bag so that you can stay the night. This is the type of place you wish was open 24hours, 7 days of the week! Whomever stocks the libations, let's all pause for a moment of silence and  bow. The sophistication of your palate is something I've only seen in Chicago and LA, so thank you for blessing Case Western with your unmatched talents."}
{"text":"My mother, grandmother, and I went here for dinner last night.  The food was incredible.  I had a chicken confit special, braised in red wine with mushrooms and pearl onions.  My mom had the duck confit, which was one of the best duck dishes I have ever tasted. We also ordered a charcuterie board and fell in love with the chicken liver and fois gras pate.  

Just as good as the food was the service.  Andrew was our server and he was patient with our questions about the extensive menu, providing thoughtful and knowledgeable recommendations. My 86 year old grandmother does not get around too easily.  He took the time to help me walk her to the bathroom and out to our car.  Due to her mobility limitations, she does not go out to eat often.  Since I was visiting from FL, it was so special to have her out with us and share this lovely meal. 

Bravo L'Albatros.  From the food, service, and ambiance... it was the perfect evening!"}
{"text":"Excellent place!  And as several reviewers have mentioned very chic (but without breaking the bank).  This place is located across from the law school.  I'm jealous of all the law professors that have this walking distance from them!  The outdoor patio is especially enticing this time of year and that is where we went!  

I had a chicken pizza for lunch and it was quite tasty (albeit a tad oily). Altogether, the elegant chic ambiance of the place is what elevates the entire dinning experience. I felt like I was at a chi-chi restaurant in NYC or some large European city.

*One weird thing: there's no bread basket at the table, rather, waiters hover around and intermittently place bread on your plate with thongs.  WHY?  This is rather distracting and unnecessary in my opinion."}
{"text":"We will NEVER ever return there again.
When we dined there 6 years ago, their food left me no impression. But this restaurant seems so popular looking from the patio and I chose to give it another try last week. 

People seems to like these restaurants, FIRE on Shaker Heights and L'Albatros, and we don't know why. 
The ambience is romantic and stylish, and the patio is perfect for date nights, BUT, it's way too dark and very very Loud.
I had to read the menu with a candle on the table.
I had to yell at my boyfriend to talk to him.
Overall a pretty crappy dinner experience. Combination of poor service and bad food. 
 
The ONLY compliment is that their comlementary bread and olive oil are very good.

The service was very slow the entire night as they accept too many customers for their tiny kitchen. Our waiter barely showed up around our table.
45 mins to get seated, 30 mins to get the first appertizer salad, 15 mins to get oysters, 30 mins to get entrees.

(Our orders: Green Salad, Oysters, Chicken Confit and Seared Sea Scallops)

The oysters are real joke. The size of oyster were like half inch. How can they serve and charge for that?

I had a first bite on my scallop dish, I lost word and wanted to stop eating.
On the menu, it says Seared Sea Scallops with brussel sprouts,noodles and pernod cream.
But the 80% of the plate was this flat thick uncooked noodle in a cream sauce. 
When i saw my plate, I almost said to the waiter \"I did not order pasta\". Honestly I thought he's brought a wrong plate; fetuccini pasta with scallop.
Even to date, I  have no clue if that noodle was supposed to be fetuccini or some kind of asian flat noodle. As the description says \"noodle\" on the menu, i guss that was not pasta but noodle.
The idea of dish killed the taste of sea scallop. My partner had a bite of the noodle and instantly spit it out saying yuk. 
Chicken Confit was unseasoned and fell flat. He was not happy with his dish either and we both stopped eating.
Chefs there don't know how to compliment main ingredient with others. 

Although the price range is somewhat reasonable (Chicken  $16, Scallop $22), I would rather pay $10 more(per plate) to eat at places like LOLA and Blue Point Grill, or pay $10 less to eat at Thai restaurants. 

If I have a choice between $100 free dinner at L'Albatros and $5 Happy Meal from McDonald's, I rather go to McDonald's. Seriously."}
{"text":"I see why this is my friend's favorite place. Very modern, amazing food and drinks. Great French cuisine."}
{"text":"Haven't used Yelp in years but had to come here to warn some folks about the swarms of flies and bees at the terrace seating. Interestingly enough, someone just posted yesterday about the same issue. However, I use Yelp for the helpful hints before going and so I'd like to smooth out the complaints with direction:

Sit inside and review the menu before going - ask the server to help with a pairing upon greeting. If you do this, I'm sure you'll have a good time."}
{"text":"Exquisite food! Escargot is amazing! Oysters, awesome! Drinks, delectable! Can't go wrong here, great service even better food! Must go! Trust me, it will impress any foodie!!!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful French food in a friendly, inviting atmosphere.  Very good service, helpful but not intrusive.
I'll be back asap."}
{"text":"This is such an experience. Every course was enjoyable, not simply by the merit of the food itself, but the conversation that naturally arose from it. What really set the tone was the seasonal cheese plate. They had an entire tray laden with hard, soft, pungent, and blue cheeses. Each cheese was described by flavor and history, and then we selected which cheeses we wanted to try as a table. It felt so interactive and unique, and we actually got to engage with our food beyond just eating it. The entrees were perfectly prepared and the desserts were creative, unique, and so delicious that your eyes rolled back into your head with the first bite. Also notable was the olive oil served with the never-ending bread, which I later learned was a product designed by the chef himself. It was almost sweet and the olive was obvious without being bitter. Overall, an excellent fine-dining experience."}
{"text":"This restaurant is delicious. I have no qualms about their food and their service. Everything I have eaten here has been tasty.

My boyfriend and I eat here when we celebrate special occasions. We went to another restaurant for my birthday (another of Zack Bruell's, actually) and definitely regretted it."}
{"text":"Our hostess welcomed us last minute without a reservation (I know, I know, I'm sorry). The patio is so quiet, shaded, and relaxed. Our waiter Nate was super friendly, professional and very accommodating. He took care of us start to finish. The escargot with the homemade bread was the best I've ever had. My wife enjoyed a cod fish while I feasted on cassoulet. A stunning white Burgundy section on their wine list ensured I wouldn't go thirsty. Please visit! Enjoy! Love life and love good food!"}
{"text":"I finally had the pleasure of dining at L'Albatros last weekend, and it lived up to expectations. Everything was wonderful. My bf had the onion soup - it contained beef, which he said heightened the already delicious onion flavor. I ordered the foie gras which was also delicious, and to my surprise they gave me a huge portion of it - don't order it unless you plan to share! 

After our appetizers we sampled 5 cheeses from the cheese board. I wouldn't miss this experience. They have about 20 cheeses on the board, and all the servers are knowledgeable about the background of each cheese. It was really fun (and tasty!)

For entrees I had the duck confit, and omg - best duck I've had in my life. We were both speechless after trying it. The accompanying butternut squash puree and braised cabbage were amazing as well. My bf had the leg of lamb which was also wonderfully and uniquely flavored.

We had a bottle of bordeaux with our meal which was very good. While the food prices were very reasonable, the wine list was a tad pricey.

Unfortunately at this point we didn't have room for dessert - next time! I'll most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I am a fan of all of Zack's restaurants! I love this place for their mussels and frittes, amazing L'Albatros Burger and their phenomenal onion soup!!! It's a nice trendy spot within/near the campus of Case Western Reserve University. The food is always very satisfying!!"}
{"text":"It's my go to for so many things. Romantic dinner by the fireplace, awesome patio dining, late night food (opening till 11 or 12), great lunch, place to go with friends to just get a bunch of apps and drinks, second best cheese board in the city (after Jordan left you fell 1 spot). 
We went last week with friends for dinner, one of our friends had some left overs and asked they be packed up, she placed the bag on the long shared bench she was sitting it, we didn't realize it till later but the couple at the table next to us also had food together and took hers too (100% sure by accident), once the server over heard us talking about it she went to the kitchen and had a 1/2 order made up on the house to go.
Great service, fair pricing, and awesome food, what else could ya want?"}
{"text":"Took my wife for her birthday.  Food never disappoints.  First time tying their cheese board on the recommendation of a friend and will have it everyone as it was exceptional."}
{"text":"Holy Francy-pants this place is good. 

Grand, wonderful. 

Let's be clear here... the friggin' cheese board is enough to warrant a visit. Just listen to the sweet sounds of the gentlemen explain the cheeses in depth to the point that you'll probably start drooling. I mean, tell him what you like and you'll get exactly that. He's like the wikipedia of cheese info and if you love cheese, this is heaven.

The ambiance is wonderful, but what really stood out here, experience-wise, was the service. Witty, yet sophisticated, helpful and honest--wow. I'm talking about catering to your needs here people. And the bread service? Let's just say I've never had to tell the servers at a restaurant that I didn't want anymore bread before in my life. I think I ate more complimentary bread than I've ever had in my life! 

Other than the obvious cheese board I ordered, I also had the tomato salad (special) which was simple, yet delicious. The hanger steak was the same. I actually wish I would have ordered something better, and more special, like the cassoulet. It came with tender lamb and sausage--it looked divine. 

My fellow diners absolutely loved their meals, which included the beef short ribs (special), the escargot, the pate and the mushroom French toast. And I actually tried the toast and the broth of the escargot (..err rather, thick, rich, butter sauce) and both were indescribably good. Specialty cocktails? Ohmygod, try that Effen basil, strawberry one--it's out of this world. 

Pricey, but absolutely necessary. Get there, go there more often, enjoy. You're welcome."}
{"text":"Another great experience - revisited my favorite soup, the potage. The portion was a little smaller than I remember, but it tasted just as creamy as I remembered.  I had the veggie pizza and it was loaded with fresh roasted mushrooms, peppers, etc. and topped with my goat cheese, my favorite.  Kudos to the staff who did not seem annoyed that my toddler was with us (it was mother's day after all!).  And if you haven't tried the mustard on the table, it's AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Oh yummy.  I had such a hard time ordering from the menu, wanted to eat everything. Food didn't disappoint at all, I had the snails and the chicken liver pate with a side of vegetables .  All so good.  Table of 4 no one was disappointed or hungry.  So glad we found this gem in Cleveland.   Very busy, book ahead.m Service was fantastic despite the restaurant being so busy."}
{"text":"Great place to get some french cuisine. Went to L'Albatros with a couple of friends and got after it with trying a little bit of everything. Was really digging the charcuterie platter and the french toast appetizer really got the taste buds firing. i could go for some more right now. All and all great place to eat, nice dining area service was solid.  I also like the fact of how much pork is on the menu. Pork is gods animal."}
{"text":"I've been here dozens of times (not kidding!) and it's just splendid each and every time. I highly recommend the French Toast for an appetizer. It's french toast with cream sauce, mushrooms and fennel. For those a little leery of French cuisine, they have options such as the L'Albatros Burger that is one of the best burgers around. I don't even feel right calling it just a hamburger. It's very good. 

Inside is much larger than it looks because they've done a great job in maximizing the space of this carriage house. I wish the patio was somehow open year-round. It's very beautiful and relaxing. I highly recommend L'Albatros."}
{"text":"Great food and great service!
Excellent environment, ambiance and décor! 
Overall wonderful amazing experience!!!!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Cleveland! I enjoyed happy hour with wife and friends.

Their French Toast is modernized and topped with mushrooms and a savory sauce. A must try!

Also, the L'Albatros Burger is unforgettable. 

Get there early if you want the good happy hour pricing!"}
{"text":"Here's the short of it: Just because it has beans and meat in it doesn't make it cassoulet. But they *will* argue that point...

The details: 

We came here on the high ratings in Yelp and the fact that they serve cassoulet. We sat down and prepared to order drinks. I was looking to enjoy a good French beer -- after all, this is a fairly large French restaurant, and they should carry at least the most popular beer in France, Kronenbourg 1664. Wrong. One oddball French beer, that's all they had in that category. Lots of unknown craft beers and that type of thing. You may like that. I opted for a red Bordeaux instead. OK... it was good...

Next we chose the goat cheese tart and a mixed-greens salad. These both were absolutely exceptional! I don't know why that salad was so good, but it was fresh and crisp and dressed with just the tastiest vinaigrette. My wife, who had the tart, echoed the sentiments of another Yelper, who said they would weep like a baby if that tart was ever taken off the menu. (Great line.) So, so-far-so-good.

When we ordered our main courses I noticed that the cassoulet had lamb as one of the meats. Who puts lamb in cassoulet?? I've had it several times in France, and NOBODY there would ever do that! In fact, I'd dare say you would be laughed at if you did. Each chef creates it differently, but they all stick to the same basic ingredients. I'm not a fan of lamb anyway, so I asked if they could substitute a chunk of pork, which is traditional in this dish. To their credit, they said they would see what they had to substitute.

That should have been a clue -- real cassoulet is baked for hours and the meats are integrated under the crust that forms from the white beans and broth; it's like a stew, and it would be difficult to change-out anything inside. But I missed that clue and ordered the dish.

(Rant coming...)

So the \"cassoulet\" arrives in a few minutes, way too few beans for the amount of meat in it, soupy broth, no crust - and what really matters, it was just \"meh\". One of the sausages was really good. The duck leg was decent. But everything else was pretty boring, especially since the savory stew-like broth and beans were essentially missing. That would have carried the dish.

When the server asked how I liked it, I told her that it wasn't what I expected and wasn't so good. A bit later a woman who was apparently the manager came over to the table and I told her the same thing. She explains how they don't prepare the cassoulet traditionally; they cook the beans separate and add the meat just before serving -- so they won't run out of the dish, she says. Well, OK... but it was still not real tasty. Is that explanation supposed to reverse my experience of it??  There was no offer to make it right -- in fact, it was like she argued that I was wrong for not liking it. She smiled the whole time but never acknowledged my experience. I guess that's what 4 1/2 stars on Yelp does to your attitude.

My wife, who worked at a Marriott restaurant for years, said that she would never argue nor allow any dissatisfaction from her customers -- it was always replaced with something else that the customer wanted, or they were compensated in some way. *That's* real customer service.

And as for her dish, the mussels she ordered were good for what they were, but, again, they didn't have much of anything in the broth to make them great. No \"wow\" factor.

So from incredible starters to \"meh\" entrees, with an attitude. That's why three stars. Minus-one for the attitude, and the fact that if you go to a French restaurant, you ought to get authentic French food, not some convenient fusion someone dreams up...

I hope you fare better."}
{"text":"Get the cheese board and charcuterie plate. Personally, this restaurant is one of the best in terms of fine-dining in Cleveland. If you have to decide between Lola's or L'Albatros, choose L'Albatros. You won't be disappointed. Make your  reservations a couple days in advance, this place is hopping."}
{"text":"Dinner with friends at L'Albatros.  I arrived a little later and did not take advantage of the restaurant's happy hour menu.  I heard, however, about some major disappointments in the service at the bar--which is by no means large and, in any event with it being a Wednesday night, was not at all crowded.  The dissatisfaction boiled down to a lack of attentiveness on the part of the bartenders--not checking on drinks and culminating in a problem that, when they finally did check on a second round, happy hour had already ended . . . for a whole four minutes.  Nonetheless, the bar refused to relent and, while I perfectly understand that \"rules are rules,\" the lack of attentiveness and then essentially blaming the customer for not watching the clock is something I would expect more from Cadillac Ranch than a top Cleveland dining spot.

We were seated in the dining room with the darker brick walls--a odd combination of a rustic feel combined with white tables and noticeably flimsy white plastic chairs.  A painting of a woman's face with an intense set of eyes kept watch over the room, as if to dare you to criticize the mix of traditional and modern.  The room itself was very poorly lighted.  I strained to read the menu and wine list, and I can't imagine that the task was any easier for the East Side blue bloods at the surrounding tables.

So, all in all, L'Albatros was not off to a good start.  Fortunately, the food picked up the slack:  I highly recommend the cheese plate.  The cheese server brings out a large tray of over twenty cheeses, identifies each one and gives a little added background about its taste, where it was from, or how it was made.  The \"French Toast,\" a ragout of wild mushrooms and balsamic syrup over two pieces of bread vaguely resembling French toast, was okay, but I would not have it again unless I really had a taste for mushrooms.  I am still curious what about the combination of mushrooms and toast the dish was intending to highlight.  The Goat Cheese Tart with Olives and Sun Dried Tomatoes was better--the olives and sun dried tomatoes were welcome highlights in what is a very rich appetizer.

For an entrée, the classic Cassoulet--a hearty mixture of white beans, lamb, duck confit, and sausage served, oddly, in a skillet--was very good and better than the same dish at Crop Bistro, the only other local cassoulet I've had.  Also at the table was the vegetarian Pasta du Jour, a fairly unexciting mix of pasta and fresh vegetables with olive oil and herbs.  On the other hand, the Braised Leg of Lamb was warmly received.  In addition to the entrees, we got two sides for the table, neither of which was particularly good.  The Crispy Breaded Cauliflower was on the bland side and could have used some spices or a sauce of some sort.  I liked the concept of the Vegetable Tian, but did not agree with the overpowering cheese it was topped with.

Dessert was a mixed bag:  After a quick scan of the menu, I zeroed in on and ordered the soufflé--excited and a little surprised the menu did not list the usual 45 minute lead time needed that you see at the rare few places you can find a soufflé for dessert.  The reason became apparent when the desserts came out:  The dish was not a soufflé at all, but rather ice cream.  Our server explained that it was called a \"soufflé\" because part of the ice cream rises slightly above the cup it is served in.  Checking the menu again, it reads \"Frozen Blood Orange and Grand Marnier Soufflé.\"  I think the restaurant could have at least put quotes around the word \"soufflé\" or otherwise came up with another name for this dish (which, mind you, is not accompanied by any type of description on the dessert menu).  The other desserts at the table were a very creamy Chocolate Napoleon and, probably the best dessert, a simple and rich Warm Chocolate Brownie with crème anglaise and vanilla ice cream.

Overall, I would be lying to say that my first visit to L'Albatros was not a disappointment.  The Cassoulet and Cheese Plate were excellent but accompanied by big misses with the two side dishes and the soufflé snafu.  The wine list was pretty good (the 2005 Chateau La Croix St. Georges was fantastic), though I would not go so far as to agree with our server that it was intimidatingly large.  Frankly, it is difficult to read just because the restaurant lighting is so dark.  As previously mentioned, service at the bar was subpar and the service at the table was not any better than average--coming back to get our food and wine orders and also getting the wine seemed to take inordinately long.  I started writing this review with the thought of giving L'Albatros three stars, and I still think the restaurant has the tools to get a three, if not four, star rating.  But I do not want to judge on potential--despite how badly I may want to see it."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurant experiences we've ever had and a true highlight of our trip to Cleveland.  We went back for dinner again the next night.  Hurt the wallet a little but we didn't regret it for a moment.  Try the cheese selection.  It's fun.   If you want to impress a lady, this is the kind of place you take her.  Period."}
{"text":"below is my original review. have been back a couple of times since and it's just ok. in NYC you'd be over. makes me sad. over steamed artichoke and ammoniated skate. desserts a loser. why? in better news the roast chicken was very good and we also liked the escargot...

loved it. really loved it. it's just right. we were a table of 4 and all the food was great. the ONLY thing that was a major creep out was the painting over the fireplace. it is SO AWFUL that i couldn't stop looking at it. really bizarre choice. but back to the food... it's french bistro food and again, really well done. the menu doesn't miss a thing. to be honest, it was about 2 months ago that we went but i am really wanting to go back and soon... realized it when we ate at le petit triangle the other day, just zero comparison. l'albatros kicked its ass."}
{"text":"For Valentines Day decided to try something different (one of our fav spots is Fahernheit) and heard great things about L'Albatros. Located in a very cool/cozy section of town, we were promptly greeted and at first blush- the atomosphere was pretty chic. Seated quickly and met by our server whom was VERY nervous. Infact, I don't think he could spit out the specials quick enough let alone understood (fully) what it was he was talking about. I know we didn't. He took our drink orders and after several minutes we were given bread to munch on. The drinks took wayyy too long to get to the table. After our drinks did come; it became very apparent there was too much stuff for our little table. looking around, you realize the little details have been over looked. Salt and pepper shakers that look like thier at home in TGIfridays, and even the lighting/music didn't quite fit. Moving on, we ordered our app (Pork Rillettes) which we didn't realize was served cold, it tasted odd and had the consistancy of tuna fish. I then had the French Onion Soup. - this was GREAT!!! infact it was the only part of our meal that left an impression. I had the Hanger Steak and she had the Salmon. Neither one of our entree's stood out in our mind to be memorable. It wasnt until our entree's were cleared did our server begin to show a personality. The staff overall (from our view point) appeared rushed, disorganized and not the 'grace under fire' one expects in this type of resturant. Being a former Certified Sous Chef of the ACF and having worked in the business (Boston) for ten years; the number one thing I note in Cleveland is poor consistancy and lack of execution. I am a foodie, but far from a food snob or ego maniac. Sadly, even Fahrenheit is spotty at times. For consistancy we go to Salmon Daves in River. Or for a great Steak; Mortons. And that's SAD! I love privately owned places like L'Abatros- and WANT you to not only succeed; but help put Cleveland on the map!! I shouldn't have to drive 45 minutes from westlake to Chez Francouis (which is one of the most impressive restaurants I've been too!) to get a great experience. 

Come on Chef! Make me want to get in my car and drive 35 minutes to L'Albatros!!! :)

{"text":"The food is excelent !
The only think... When you are getting it..  You can see the floor in The kitchen... It was very dirty..  It doesn't look good!"}
{"text":"They have a Happy Hour menu!!

I stopped in a little before 5pm on a Saturday and sat at the bar with my friend. We split several dishes from the happy hour menu and have no regrets. My favorite was the pork belly poutine and next up would be the homemade gnocchi, mmm! The burger was good too, the flatbread I would pass on next time. I did get the cocktail on special and it was super tasty and refreshing! Prices were $10 or under and the kitchen was kind enough to split everything so that we did not have to at our seats. 

But maybe even better than the food was the service! The three servers we encountered behind the bar were all just so pleasant and helpful! They seemed like they genuinely liked their jobs and each other. 

I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Just like I miss Parallax, I miss L'Albatros too.  Not just because of their beautiful patio, dark yet modern ambiance and great service, but because they have some of the most scrumptious food that I have ever enjoyed ever.  

The roasted artichoke and the french toast are great apps... two must haves in my opinion.  I have tried numerous entrees there never to be disappointed either... I suggest the Skate wing, Scallops, or even the Duck Confit.  Great bar area even. 

Keep up the kick a$$ work ;)"}
{"text":"5 stars, really? i think l'albatros is totally overrated. i prefer \"that place,\" the restaurant that l'albatros took over.

you can either perceive the food as this: 1) falling short of expectations, or 2) overpriced for what you get.  i ordered one of their specials, sea bass over a \"stew\" of vegetables. the fish was overcooked and quite tough and the combination of vegetables was odd and did not work together to make the dish that great - peas, onions, bok CHOY(why?) in this watery soupy-like broth. was that the \"stew\" part? it was strange to me, but tasted okay, but it could probably be better than that!

my visiting parents ordered duck confit (that looked better) and salmon with lentils. the latter was overcooked as well and the lentils didn't really go too well with it. maybe fish isn't their forte. this place doesn't use gallons of salt like sergio's, but i think they could probably come up with a better way of making their dishes flavorful. not the most satisfying dinner...

oh and BTW, also commenting on parking: it is SO silly to charge patrons to park in their giant, empty parking lot when you can park on the street for free! i pulled up to the parking attendant, found out i had to pay, and back out and right into a space on the curb in front of him. good ol' university circle. i wonder what that made him think!

on the plus side, the cheesecake is unique and really good. cool space inside and attentive service."}
{"text":"I don't think I can say much that hasn't already been said in all the other rave reviews for this restaurant.... Though I can say this... \"Everything wonderful mentioned is absolutely TRUE!\" From the ambience, staff, food, overall experience,L'Albatros is a true gem nestled in the heart of University Circle!

Our group of 6 came here for new year eve's dinner. The restaurant was beautifully decorated with chi? black & gold balloons as well as banners. Thankfully they did not have an exorbitantly priced pre-fix menu like a lot of the other restaurants. 

We started off with a few hors'doeuvres & sides for the table. Honestly, I'm hard pressed to pick a favorite! We got the salmon plate, French toast, roasted cauliflower & the French fries. The flavors were spot on! The fries were Crisp & piping hot with an amazing cheesy taste to it.  The French toast was a high point. It was savory, unique, something I have never had before at another restaurant. An absolute must try!

The entrees for me was a let down especially after the delicious appetizers. The food was cooked perfectly however lacked the impeccable flavors the appetizers had. We had the roasted cod, the cassoulet, the veg cassoulet & the veg pasta of the day. I personally could have skipped the entrees in favor to try more of the appetizers. 

For desserts we tried the chocolate brownie, creme fraiche cheesecake & chocolate Napoleon. Verdict: the cheesecake is hands down the winner of the dessert round! Not too sweet, not too dense... Just perfect!

Overall: L'Albatros is a great upscale restaurant & definitely a Cleveland must try!"}
{"text":"Went here for happy hour and had a great cheeseburger wIth grilled onions and Bearnaise sauce for $10. Very filling and delicious. Next time we went for happy hour had the cauliflower gratin appetizer for $5. Was quite tasty, maybe a little on the salty side."}
{"text":"We had a lovely dinner for 2 in late August 2011. The service was attentive without being overbearing, the food was delicious and the outdoor patio is quite nice. The only downside was the music from a nearby pub that obviously couldn't be filtered out. The chocolate napoleon was mousse between several crispy layers - a nice new take on an old stand by. The tuna salad was also slightly different take on a common theme and quite tasty. I'd definitely go back the next time I'm in Cleveland."}
{"text":"My singing partner & I had just finished playing a set at the Barking Spider and were ravenous. A friend led us over to L'Albatros (around the block), saying only that it was pricey but good. He was only half correct: for the type, quality and even quantity of food it was quite reasonable (especially since I'm used to Chicago prices); but the service was friendly and knowledgeable and the food was amazing.  Despite some tempting specials and a full bistro-classics menu, i zeroed in on the choucroute garnie.  It was every bit the equal (and then some) of any I'v had in Paris or Montreal. Huge, meltingly succulent slab of pork belly, generous cut of a subtly smoked pork chop (not at all salty), boudin blanc and andouille sausages on a bed of cabbage braised in a gentle savory broth that with a touch more saffron could have been the basis for bouillabaisse.  My singing partner had the grilled sausage platter. I went old-school (match the regions) and paired the choucroute with a crisp yet full rosé Cremant d'Alsace. Dessert was a dish of impeccably fresh blackberries, strawberries and raspberries  with a generous dollop of creme fraixche. Partner had excellent coffee and a dried-cherry-and-walnut brownie that was sort of like a Teenage Mutant Ninja Chunky.\"

It was the perfect capper to a satisfying gig and two-week tour. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I celebrate our anniversary here almost every year. It's one our favorite spots. The entrees are always delicious- French comfort food, cocktails and the escargot is to die for!! I got the starry night cocktail and it was amazing!! The prices are super reasonable- we got cocktails, split a salad, each got entrees and split dessert...100 dollars even.

 Bring your own wine
VERY gluten free friendly"}
{"text":"L Albatros is one of the best restaurants in the area.  If you want to impress your girlfriend, wife, spouse or significant other, this is the place to take them.  The atmosphere is casual, but sophisticated, with one of the best patios you will find.  The service is impeccable, try to have your water glass or bread plate empty for any length of time.  And then there is the food, which is expertly prepared.   For apps, try the oysters or the mushroom french toast.  For your entree, I would recommend any of the fish dishes, with the mussels frites, being my go to item.  Leave some room for dessert if you can, they are excellent.

Price is reasonable considering the quality of what you get."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner on a Friday night, and I was truly surprised by how impressive the entire experience was. For a place that isn't as expensive as some other nicer (a little nicer than just a casual place, I think, but no Lola) restaurants in town, the attention to detail here is incredible.

When we walked in, the place was alive and buzzing with people but not overwhelmingly crowded. We sat at the bar to wait for our table, and ordered a couple drinks. My boyfriend got a Kronenburg on tap, and was surprised both that they had it on tap, and with how fresh it was. He thinks it's because they have a quality selection of only four beers on tap, so they stay fresh b/c they prob have higher turnover. Sounds plausible to me, and fresh beer is always preferable to choosing from a large selection of old beer. I had a martini of some sorts that was delicious--off to a good start.

At the table we continued to have impeccable service, from the waiter, to the fromagier who helped us with the cheese plate, to the busboys--everyone was very professional and perfectly attentive. And the food, the most important part, was spot-on. We started with the cheese plate, where the fromagier expertly explained the different choices to us tableside, and we choose 5. If you like cheese, this is a no-brainer, get it! For entrees we got a pizza, salad nicoise, vegetable cassoulet, and the pasta special that day that had cauliflower and arugula--deceptively simple but so perfectly done. For dessert, we took the waiter's recommendation and got the Napolean, and I was blown away. Best dessert I've had in a long time, love the subtle raspberry sauce that comes with it.

Fun and intimate ambiance too, and I can't wait till they open the patio (might already be open now, I haven't checked for about 2 weeks now). Great place for a date or a dinner with close friends, and you won't break the bank.  I hope this place sticks around, I'll definitely be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"The food tastes a little bit salty to me but their service was great. Very professional. I also liked the interior design of the restaurant. I will definitely go back there again and try another dish! :)"}
{"text":"This is definitely one place to check out in Cleveland. Christopher Gruden gives this a 5 star review."}
{"text":"Still my go-to place in Cleveland for French food served with class. 

The cassoulet is masterful and at least two meals worth."}
{"text":"Quality of the experience is compromised by incompetent front-of-the-house management.

I purchased my in-laws a gift certificate to L'Albatros for Christmas and made them a New Year's Eve reservation at the same time (for 5:30 PM). My in-laws arrived at the restaurant at 5:30 and informed the hostess that they had received a gift certificate that the restaurant was holding. The hostess insisted that the restaurant did not sell gift certificates and there was no gift certificate being held for them. 

They reported that they had a wonderful dinner, during which the manager came to their table to greet them. When he asked how everything was, they pointed out the food was excellent but their gift certificate was not at the front desk where it was supposed to be. The manager had no response, as if he did not even process the complaint but rather was engaging in rote pleasantries.

My in-laws had to pay their entire bill on New Year's Eve, despite that they charged my credit card for an amount that would cover most of the dinner only the week before (i.e. they double charged for dinner). This indicates the front-of-the-house either engages in fraudulent behavior, or are grossly incompetent.

I would recommend staying away until this restaurant works through its management issues."}
{"text":"I was lucky to be taken here on someone else's dime and had a thoroughly enjoyable meal. The service is terrific and unobtrusive, with waiters constantly replacing small slices of crusty bread for every patron, and refilling dishes of olive oil and water. Having trouble choosing between many nice menu items, I finally settled on the trout, which was a generous serving cooked with an almond crust, pan fried in butter with tomatoes and garlic. There were al dente green beans on top. A very well-coordinated wait staff brought out all of the dishes for our fairly large party together. For dessert I had a lemon tart. It had a pistachio crust, very sour lemon, and a meringue on top. Though all of the elements were good, I wasn't convinced that they all came together. I like lemon desserts because they usually aren't so sweet, yet the very sweet meringue overcompensated for the sour lemon. The richness of the pastry crust, while good on its own, didn't quite combine with the other favors. However, that's just my taste, and the overall experience was still 5 stars. About the price - though the 3 dollar signs would have scared me off, the average entree price was about $20, and there were lots of appetizer and salad options. The portions were generous, and it would be possible to eat a nice meal or just drinks and dessert without totally breaking the bank. I would recommend to anyone visiting Cleveland."}
{"text":"I personally find the food here overrated. The leeks were served cold which was unexpected and I find the food overpriced. The fish was good, but not fantastic especially considering the price. They have a decent house red wine, which is $5 during happy hour. Their service is attentive, sometimes too much so. I would like to eat more than a few bites of food before someone refills the one sip of water I've taken."}
{"text":"Stop it. Honestly Albatros is too good. I can't stop thinking about when I can come back!

This is my second time having dinner here and while I remember loving it the first time around, I don't remember what I had.  This week though I started with the radish and cucumber salad, which was crisp, fresh, and delicious, followed by the veal short rib with wild mushroom risotto. It was perfect, and I don't say that often. Incredibly tender and bursting with flavor. I ate every last bite of it with no shame! With a lemon tart and cappuccino for dessert, this was an all around amazing meal and possibly now my #1 restaurant in Cleveland.  Between the food, the ambiance, and the excellent service, I can't recommend a better place."}
{"text":"The cheese board alone is worthy of eating here! The staff is knowledgeable and helpful in picking out the best cheeses to sample, paired with local honey and fig compote! The cocktails are both delicious and aesthetically pleasing. The mussels with pommes frites was a generous serving topped with their spicy aoli sauce. Would return here a million times over!"}
{"text":"I write this from the standpoint of having been fortunate to dine at Parallax (a sister restaurant of L'Albatros). I also eat out fairly frequently w/ my fiancée -- places we have frequented and enjoyed include Blackbird (Chicago), Sepia (Chicago), Lola (Cleveland), The Flying Fig (Cleveland), and Radius (Boston). So, in a sense, I am writing this review from the context of having dined at these other fine establishments.


That said, we made reservations for lunch on a Saturday using OpenTable. We were actually running a bit behind w/ our errands, so we called, and the restaurant was easily able to accommodate our request to be seated 15 minutes later. The décor/ambiance of L'Albatros is a mixture of modern overlaying a rustic historical carriage house. We thought it was cozy (there are different rooms linked by twisting corridors). Our bread and olive oil were brought out rather promptly, and we were able to peruse the menu. The bread, notably, was soft and appeared to have a nice crusty exterior. It wasn't as soft and as freshly cooked as the bread at Sephia, but it was decently close. It took about 15 minutes before we actually able to place our orders - The server was very nice, but it did appear he was the only one covering our room at lunch (there appeared to be about 5 other couples/groups in the room at the time).

We ordered the pork rillettes w/ toast points. The rillettes were characteristic of a Northwestern French style - there was a very rich and bronze color to the fine pieces of pork interspersed with the fat. Very yummy - I haven't seen this appetizer at other French restaurants such as NoMI (Chicago), Aquitaine (Boston), and Brasserie Jo (Boston). The small pickles were a nice accoutrement, and the flavor of the pork was strong but not too overwhelming. Given the large amount of visible fat that is characteristic of a rillette, I suspect that this dish may not be for everyone, although fans of French cuisine should try this at least once.

My fiancée ordered the roasted cod with toasted garlic spätzle, haricots verts, and truffle butter. I actually ordered the same dish, substituting the roasted trout with almond crust fort he roasted cod (I usually don't like cod as much). The server and staff were very accommodating w/ respect to making a change on the menu.

Both of our dishes were excellent w/ respect to the fish. Although I am not typically a fan of cod, I did think the cod on my fiancée's plate tasted quite good - the outer surface was crispy w/out being overburnt. My trout was also scrumptious, although I thought the almonds distracted somewhat from the natural taste of the fish itself. The spätzle tasted as though it was freshly made. However, both my fiancée and I agreed that the truffle butter was a bit overwhelming. We were somewhat disappointed that we couldn't savor the eggs in the spätzle due to the excessive butter in the dish.

As for dessert, we've noticed that Parallax also suffers from a truly uncreative dessert menu. The dessert menu at L'Albatros also had rather unimaginative offerings such as crème caramel, mixed berries w/ crème fraiche, cheesecake, warm chocolate brownies. Compare this to Lola (Pear & Walnut Backed Alaska - oregonzola blue chese, brown sugar meringue, roasted concord grape), Blackbird (manjari chocolate pave with black mission figs, crispy chocolate and lime salt), and Radius (goat cheese and huckleberry cheesecake w/ huckleberry ice cream, buckwheat tuille and tart lemon syrup). Anyway, Zach Bruell would probably benefit from hiring at least a part-time pasty chef to develop a dessert menu for his restaurants. We ordered the frozen lemon soufflé. The candied lemon peels were delicious and added immensely to the taste of the frozen soufflé. However, we could not help but wistfully think about other more creative desserts we have had in the past at some of the other places listed above. Even the fig ice cream at The Flying Fig would have been better....

In summary, we had a pleasant but not really memorable meal at L'Albatros (:(). We really have enjoyed our meals (w/ the exception of the desserts) at Parallax in the past, so we were looking forward to a similar experience at Zach's new restaurant, L'Albatros. As it is, however, I would have some reservation about recommending L'Albatros at this time and instead recommend that people check out Crop, The Flying Fig, or Parallax instead for restaurants in the same price range. I really wanted to enjoy L'Albatros, and while the service staff was gracious (albeit a bit slow due to understaffing), I think that we will probably hold off on returning until these early kinks are worked out."}
{"text":"We discovered this gem when visiting Cleveland last year and were VERY VERY impressed.
This year trip we've started with the lunch here and again it was a pleasure from the beginning to the end.
Highlights: terrine, bread service, Roasted cod, great choice of beer.
Service was impeccable, ambiance was very nice and cozy, the value was adequate to the pleasure. When we are in Cleveland again no doubt we'll return.
P.S.  We returned earlier than we thought for the last dinner in Cleveland and it was a terrific experience. Don't skip their meat board, it's amazing."}
{"text":"I gave up red meat for lent, but I need to come back here for their Cassoulet and Cod (supposedly his best dishes here!)

So, please don't look at just this rating. I will definitely need to come back to this restaurant again. The only reason I'm writing this review is maybe to recommend what dish may not be his best at this restaurant.

I've heard many great things about this restaurant and tons of friends have claimed for this to be his best yet restaurant. With that said, I didn't find my first time here to be as great as I expected.... however, I do believe i ordered the wrong dish.

Bouillabaisse for 2 (3.9): Since I got this for myself, I actually only for 'bouillabaisse for 1\" so I didn't get to have lobster in my dish (boooooo...). Anyway, usually I love Zack's seafood dish. And don't get me wrong, this is better than most restaurants you'll ever go to, but not Zack's greatest. 

Pork Tenderloin - special of the day (3.5): Not Zack's best pork tenderloin. The meat was very tender and cooked well but the flavors were a bit on the bland side and the vegetables wasn't the best pairing for it. The white beans kind of overpowered the meat flavors. 

Zack, i'll be back! :D 

PS- the outdoor patio is awesome here!!!"}
{"text":"I had a real great experience my first visit. Great ambience, amazing food and dedicated service! I'll be back soon enough"}
{"text":"The food was good...expensive, but good. Definitely for \"special occasions.\"The worst part about this place was the bill. I would have been fine paying the $80 tab for my wife and I, but I certainly didn't appreciate paying it twice...that's right, they inadvertently (I hope) charged me twice. Had to got through the nightmare of filing a claim with my credit card company. The most disturbing part was that I called the restaurant for an explanation, they said the manager would call me back. Still waiting. That was July 2015. Patience is truly a virtue with L'Albatros. I don't care how good the food was...I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Wi,wi, monfrier!

Well 1st lets start out with the bad part of this dinning experience.  That would be the female I took here.  She felt out of place because she was wearing blue jeans.  Then she took her gum out of her mouth and put it on the bread plate and ordered a glass of sweet champagne. Then was making weird comments about the people eating next to us whom she thought were looking funny at her.  This girl was class all the way.  WTF!  


Next- the food. It was pretty good. My dish was 4.5 stars.  The gum girl ordered the BRAISED LEG OF LAMB. I had advised her maybe not the best choice. She got it anyway.  It kind of tasted like pot roast.  Very Meh!

Next Guy that brought Gum Girl(that would be me) I ordered the Skate Wing.  That is something that you do not see in the Clev very often! It was very good.  Very mild sauce that let the freshness of the fish stand out.  The zucchini layered with cheese was the perfect side.  Low in starch and very tasty. I gave her some of mine as she was still hungry!

Gum Girl who likes to complain that she eats too much and needs to go on a diet proceeds to order desert. Well this was a good call. The flan was incredible.  Having lived in Merida, Mexico I have been spoiled with great flan. This was exceptional.  The homemade whipped cream was divine!

Well,  L'Albatros I will be back.  I really want to try your burger but with so many other choices that one may have to wait.  But don't worry I  certainly will not bring gum girl back."}
{"text":"Okay, sorry not too impressed.

The atmosphere is cosy.  The service was attentive, and genuinely friendly...
I think most folks here want something genuine, not pretentious, and I can attest that this spot should get high marks for the atmosphere and the staff. I do appreciate that the servers were professional, courteous, and had a nice sense of humor.

I was just disappointed with what we ordered, and was hoping for more from a special night out.  The mussels and pomme frites were over-salted, though the mussels were tender and cooked well.  The pizza we ordered was a little ridiculous.  It was pretty comical when they placed a plate down, with what turned out to be just a gooey mess of cheese that you might expect to be a 3$ item from a food truck.  Dessert was okay, not great.  Yes, we were just there for drinks and snacks, not dinner.  But we were pretty incredulous that our food was so expensive... and not too sensational.  I went in with high expectations, and went home a little bewildered.  If you work hard for your money, you might want to skip this place."}
{"text":"Well, I live in CA and I just came back from Paris.  Stopped by at OH with friends and tried at this place, O-M-G!!  Everything is good at this place, the lavender drink, the red wine, the duck, the dessert, the staffs...  And the price is right!!"}
{"text":"One of top 5 in Cleveland.

A friend introduced us to L'albatross with glowing remarks.  I had a romantic dinner with my fiance on the outdoor patio.  We had at least 4 people waiting on us.  Nothing was wanting.  We had 2 great appetizers, both very rich (which I like about French cooking) but delicious:  french toast with black mushrooms and a savory tart.  Excellent.  Then we had a cold beet and melon soup.  Wonderful in the warm night air.  For our main course we shared the scallops over linguine.  The scallops were excellent, but the cream sauce in the linguini was bland, bland, bland.  I would either recommend asking for this dish with a different sauce or skipping it.  There were other choices on the menu.  The bland cream sauce would have knocked my rating down a half-point, but no option to do that here.  In any rate 4.5 stars from me.  A beautiful, well-run establishment with a creative menu, good service and good prices for the quality of the food.  Our total bill was $47 + tip."}
{"text":"Yummy!  I tried the slow cooked beef shoulder special and it was delicious.  The hanger steak and root vegetable cassoulet were also amazing.  What makes this place stand out is the attention to details-  water glasses,  bread, the ambiance and fireplace- its the perfect setting to feel like a grown up."}
{"text":"Such a classy well run place.  Call ahead for reservations.  The only downside is the parking lot charges 2$ per hour though theres probably street parking nearby.  The atmosphere is diverse, the white booths near the bar feel contemporary then theres the large dining room as well as a beautiful patio with outdoor seating.  They have an impressive wine and beer list as well as innovative cocktails.  The cuisine is french like the restaurant name implies.  The sea scallops were delicious, 3 large scallops on fettuccini tossed in a light cream sauce mixed w shaved brussels sprouts.  Next time I might get it with sprouts on the side because the coarse texture was a little distracting.  The dish was still excellent.  The lemon roll was a very refreshing summer dessert accompanied by strawberry sherbet.  I have had a lovely experience every time I've dined here.  The servers are very knowledgeable and can help pick just the dish you are in the mood for.  The entrees are are about 20-30$ here but well worth the slightly higher price point then the average Cleveland restaurant.  This classic is definitely worth a trip."}
{"text":"I am very much a fan of L'Albatros.  Living in Cleveland, this place is a little haven in the middle of the University Circle area.  I enjoy sitting at the bar and nibbling on chicken liver mousseline, enjoying artichoke heart leaves, and picking at the fries off the divine burger someone else ordered.  They make phenomenal cocktails and for sit down dinners-this place hits the spot.  I love birthday dinners here, accompanied by bottles of wine, duck confit, cod, and steak.  This place really is a joy, and I recommend everyone's patronage!"}
{"text":"Who would have thought I could find a decent cassoulet in Cleveland?  While not in my Top 10 cassoulets on the planet, it was passable, and certainly better than I expected in this zip code.  Light on the beans, and with breadcrumbs (sacrilege!), but tasty.  Probably the best cheese board the city has to offer.  With a glass of wine with dinner and some port with my cheese plate, the bill came to $66.  I could have a paid a lot more for a meal nowhere near as good."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of going to dinner at this FANTASTIC place last Friday night. To say everything was perfect would be a complete understatement... The food was outstanding, the service was excellent and the atmosphere on the back patio was truly majestic! Make sure you stop in this spot for dinner and drinks sooner than later. It's ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! Cheers!"}
{"text":"We ordered from the Restaurant Week 3 course meal menu and it was just \"ok\" which was so disappointing. We had such high expectations for this place. It has good reviews and is pretty pricey so we thought we were in for a real treat. The meal I had, I pretty much could've cooked at home myself. It was dark meat chicken with undercooked potatoes in chicken broth. The salad was also just mediocre. It sounded really fancy with asian pears, goat cheese, dried cherries and vanilla vinaigrette but it totally missed the mark. My boyfriend's appetizer was much better. He ordered the dumplings in a bed of mashed butternut squash. The warm brownie dessert had way too many walnuts for my liking. I won't be coming here again. Not worth the prices."}
{"text":"This is my second time here and I feel I have some fair input by now.

First, atmosphere is modern, contemporary and comfortable.

Service is next to none.  They make sure your glass is always full and you always have bread to chew on before your meal.  You have to make it a point to say no to stop them from continuously coming by and filling your plates with bread.  The bread, yes, are great!

Bar menu is full of surprises.  They have the usual red, white and beer.  Cocktail selection is interesting.  The L'Albatros cocktail is a absinthe based drink, which is quite a pleasant surprise.

Appetizers feature soup, cold cuts of cured meat, pate and cheese.  These are quite good!

The entree we had were cassoulet, short rib stew and a special they had, seared red fish on mushroom risotto.  Ingredients were fresh.  Mushroom risotto was made beautifully while the red fish is seared so the skin is just slightly crispy.  Job well done.  However, while each dish brings wonderful favors to my palate, they are salty and not by a tidbit.  My friend and I both cannot finish our entrees mainly because of the salt content over-filling our savory desires. Other than that, we thoroughly enjoyed our evening.

Overall, I gave it a 4.  If they can reduce the salt content on the entrees, things will be perfect. 

Oh, they also offers parking for the restaurant, which will cost you 3$."}
{"text":"Visited from LA a week ago, and had the wonderful pleasure of having a superb lunch here. It was truly outstanding, one of the very best chicken dishes I have ever eaten, and I have eaten great chicken in NY, Vancouver, Paris and LA, and elsewhere. Great restaurant!! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Goat cheese tart, ground mustard, drink fashionably late, presentation meh, service great, pork dish meh, cauliflower awesome, tiger shrimp good risotto was tasty. Onions in pork dish meh. I'd go back but I wasn't WOW'd as my first visit."}
{"text":"I had a lovely evening here last summer. My dining companion and I were seated on the patio, which is unbelievably beautiful. Seriously, the patio is worth a trip here in an of itself.

The service was excellent as well. And the food was very good. It wasn't spectacular, but it was very good. For French cuisine, it was rather affordable as well. 

Check L'Albatros out the next time there's nice weather, and be sure to request a seat on the patio!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and outstanding service.  This place has an eclectic menu and is unique and has maintained its well deserved reputation for years."}
{"text":"I've been back to L'Albatros many times and I have to say it just stays wonderful! The manager is super hands on. Checks on tables refills water, good things. The food is always stellar and recently I was there with a group of 10 and we ALL loved everything and they even divided the check! I love having this place nearby, and will stay loyal."}
{"text":"We decided to go to L'Albatros for a romantic Christmas Eve dinner and we were not disappointed. We will definitely be returning: 

I was a bit concerned when I walked in and saw how small the restaurant was. I was expecting something a bit more open. It was really the opposite. It didn't end up being a terrible problem, though, and we quickly settled into a little corner. The hostess complimented my husband on his cologne choice, which made him smile. 

The waiter was friendly and helpful and the food was DELICIOUS! Everything came out very fast, hot, and fresh. I really enjoyed everything we ordered except for maybe the chicken confit. More on that later. 

I recommend starting off with one of their classic cocktails, Ford, which was gin and citrus. So refreshing and strong, just how I like it. And then the escargot (so buttery, delicate, and flavorful). I wish I had known ahead of time that they bring fresh bread around to the tables. It would've gone perfectly with the escargot but they brought it when we had just about finished the appetizer. Is this something they typically put on the tables as soon as the guest sits down? I'll remember to ask next time. There were also little cubes of toasted bread in the buttery escargot dish itself, which was really wonderful. Like little crispy bits of surprise floating in a butter sauce. It really helped enhance the flavor and the texture. 

Next was the Onion soup, which really hit the spot. It was SO buttery and dense and, surprisingly, had little pieces of beef under the cheese and bread. I asked and found out it was, to my delight, brisket. Unusual for onion soup despite the beef stock base, but it really really worked and we enjoyed the extra flavor and texture, which ended up satisfying both of our craving for red meat, and encouraged us both to change our minds for our entree! I ended up ordering the almond crusted trout. It was silky and flavorful and the thin green beans (haricots verts) were tender and well prepared. The whole dish needed more salt, but this ended up being a good thing! I actually enjoyed that they under-salted it because I was able to use the (what I thought  was) pink salt they had available at the table, and it was very subtle, mild and added a nice smoky flavor to the dish. I would definitely recommend this dish and can't wait to try it again. 

My husband ordered the chicken confit. The flavor was there and I could definitely taste the confit aspect of the dish, but, unfortunately, it was overcooked and the chicken was a bit stringy and definitely dry. He was pretty bummed but I traded him half of my fish dish and ate the other half of the chicken confit (it really was pretty dry) and we were both content. The spätzle side that came with the chicken confit was a bit odd-tasting and mushy. I suppose it would've been better had the chicken not fallen flat.

The dessert was quite good. I went for the chocolate Napoleon and he had the pistachio cake. The Napoleon was incredibly rich and VERY sweet, and perfect for 1-2 people. The pistachio cake, while delicious, should really be served with some sort of hot beverage as it was a bit dryer (more like a bread) and less like a \"cake\". It was not something we would order again, but we are happy we gave it a try.

I give this restaurant an 9/10! We will definitely be back and thanks for making our Christmas Eve so special!"}
{"text":"I can't afford this place for dinner but for lunch it's a perfect option.  The space is airy and beautiful and the service is impeccable.  The first time I went my friend had the cassoulet and I had the trout, both suggestions of the server. We shared the chicken pate, which was good but I still prefer AMP 150's.   I also had the lemonade which was light and refreshing.  My trout was amazing, sauce was perfect but I wasn't that big of a fan of the fried spatzle.  It was a little dry.  The cassoulet could have easily fed 2-3 people.  It had every meat imaginable in it.  It came in an actual pan as I don't think it would fit on a normal plate.  It had several types of sausage, lamb, pork belly, duck, chicken and was just insane to look at.  It was only 16 bucks for lunch and all the meats were tender.
Went a second time with my parents.  We tried the tourine (spelling?)  I wasn't a big fan of the fat that surrounds the dish but the meat part was pretty good.  Not my favorite.  My mom had the mussels and pomme frites, which were so so so so good.  The sauce was a little too buttery but the mixture of the mussels and fries was great.  I had the homemade pasta with veggies.  It had kale and a ton of root vegetables.  Again pretty awesome.  My dad had the croque monsiuer sandwich.  It was pretty heavy but good.  
Both times I've gone it's been pretty busy which was nice to see.  I'm excited to come when the weather is nice outside cause the patio looks really inviting."}
{"text":"If I could, I would give this restaurant a 7 star rating!  We absolutely love this place!  We were visiting Cleveland for the Hall and Oates concert and read the reviews on L'Albatros; so we decided to check it out.  OMG, were we surprise on how good the service and food was....we started with the french onion soup (yummy) and the salmon appetizer with this wonderful aioli drizzle. Just wow.....  then my husband had the sautéed skate dinner and I had the duck confit.  So delicious!  Hubby loved his fish and the veggies that came with it.  Our server was the best also.  She came back a couple of times to check on us and I can't think of anything they need to improve.  We cannot wait to come back to Cleveland and have dinner at this hidden gem!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner here a week ago and absolutely loved everything! From the moment we walked in to see an open kitchen, to the cheese cart being presented for dessert....LOVED everything! We are in the restaurant business, so when I say we loved it, take that to heart! Thanks for a great experience !!!"}
{"text":"This may be my new favorite spot in Cleveland. The cassoulet was perfect, and everything in it was just so expertly prepared. If it's a nice day, I'd recommend seeing if you can snag a table on the patio."}
{"text":"There are pro's and con's to this place. The restaurant is warm and cozy, but way too cramped. The tables are so close to each other in certain sections that you can overhear people's conversations without trying. The wait staff was extremely polite and attentive, and the food is beautifully presented. Our appetizer was made with goat cheese, olives, and sun dried tomatoes and it was delicious. We had the hanger steak and pork two ways for our entrees and they were mediocre at best. For the money you pay at this place, you'd certainly be better off going elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great French restaurant in Cleveland! Located in a quiet place in University circle. The outside seatings are lovely. Food was amazing and lunch was not too expensive."}
{"text":"I feel more 4-and-a-half stars, but L'Albatros is worth rounding up.

We have been to L'Albatros a few times now, and most recently we took a friend there on a snowy March day. From the moment we walked in, we were greeted warmly, our coats hung for us, and escorted to our table with friendly courtesy. Our water glasses were filled, and bread and olive oil brought to the table for us to enjoy while we perused the extensive menu.

We had no doubt about our first course: the cheese plate. We have enjoyed the amazing variety of cheeses at L'Albatros before. The Fromager soon brought his abundant board of cheeses to the table and asked how many we wished to try, 3, 5, or 7? Of course we chose 7. He asked about our tastes in cheeses and, based on what our claims to like strong cheeses and adventure, laid out a flight of cheeses for our enjoyment, along with stone ground mustard and fig jam to clear the palate. We loved all but one of the cheeses, which is exactly as a request for adventurous cheeses should be: pushing us to the limit.

Because we were feeling extravagant, we also ordered the charcuterie platter to share. This arrived on a slate slab and ranged from prosciutto to foie gras. All of it was beautifully prepared, though no one at our table cared for the pork and veal loaf. The foie gras, though, we almost came to blows over with our formerly vegan friend. Not that she objected to it; on the contrary, we engaged in a knife duel over the last bits of it on the plate.

Already quite well-fed, we moved on to our main courses. I had the boeuf bourguignon, and it was eye-rollingly tender and delicious, and so rich after our appetizers that I took half of it home for lunch the next day. Our friend had the scallops, which she pronounced delicious and devoured. Ferrett had...he can't even remember. I know it was tasty, because he ate it all. But his memories of the evening are all about the cheese plate and the charcuterie. 

There were also desserts for the two of them, but we were a couple cocktails into the evening and I finished with a glass of port, as I am not a dessert person, so I just have to take it on faith and the evidence of empty plates that they enjoyed those sweets.

Our service was attentive, and our water glasses were never empty. So where does the half-star-off come from in my mind? 

Mostly, it's in the layout of the restaurant. Because the tables are wedged in tightly, and the rooms mean there are a lot of corners, the serving staff was often jostling for position in the room. I am undoubtedly being really picky here, but I felt like I was much too aware of the staff's difficulties in negotiating the space and had a couple wincing moments when I thought a diner was going to be spilled on. In a restaurant of this quality, the service should border on invisible. It's a small thing, in so much quality, that I am happy to round up. 

This is a perfect restaurant for special events like birthdays and anniversaries. Go and enjoy the pampering."}
{"text":"What a delight! Our server was exceptional. We began with the cheese selections. She brought a large tray of cheeses and explained every cheese to perfection. The cheese sections was wide ranging and wonderful. 
Next was the French Onion Soup. Absolutely spectacular, using left over bouef bourguignon as the base for the soup. 
My entrée was the Monday special, coq a vin. Wonderful flavors for this classic French peasant dish. It's just too bad we were too full for dessert. A wonderful dessert menu ...... but no crepes??? After all, it is a French restaurant!  
You won't be disappointed. A great choice and won't break your budget!!"}
{"text":"CLEVELAND, OH: Super excited to get squeezed in at the end of a shift to dine at the famous Cleveland French destination L'Albatros.  Located basically on campus at Case Western, it is surrounded by old architecture and new museums, as well as a river.

They serve French cuisine, and the restaurant resembles a small chateau house.  Very approachable.

I tried two menu items, by recommendation:

French Toast Appetizer: (5 Stars) Served savory with a thick brioche toast, cheese and mushrooms with balsamic glaze.  Yum!

Cassoulet: (5 stars) How can you go wrong with a traditional French preparation of pork belly, duck, lamb, sausage and vegetables?  Answer: You can't.  Their most popular dish packs a significant flavor-filled punch.  

Shout out to Kim Paradise for giving me excellent recommendations and getting me in for dinner after closing time."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a couple of drinks and appetizers. Everything we had was wonderful and the service was superb. Will definitely be back to try more dishes."}
{"text":"I was really on the brink of 4 and 5 stars for this one. My boyfriend and I even discussed our yelp rating systems after dinner and the reason that this got 4 and not 5 is because while it had exquisite food and ambiance, we didn't eat something here that was \"the best ever\" of that specific food (though it was pretty damn good!!!) I would definitely recommend this to place to friends and family though. I would recommend the veal short rib served over risotto. Yummy! I also was a huge fan of the atmosphere (great for a date night) and will be coming back here when it's warmer so I can check out the patio. I would stay away from the pomme frites - lacked flavor and an aioli for dipping. I was also not a huge fan of their brownie. I thought it was heavy and rubbery. Price was comparable to restaurants of similar quality (Lola, Cowell and Hubbard, Greenhouse Tavern). Overall though, the experience was excellent and I will try it out again in the summer!"}
{"text":"Great food, but the service has gotten progressively worse over the uears. Three visits in a row, we have been far from thrilled with the service here. Unfortunately, this'll be the last for us."}
{"text":"My husband surprised me with an anniversary dinner last night. We've been here on multiple occasions and we've never once had a bad experience. 

We started with drinks and appetizers. Which were the \"French toast\" and the escargo. The escargo was absolutely amazing and jam packed with flavor. The chunks of garlic and toast made for an awesome crunch. 
The \"French toast\" was also very good. I'm a huge fan of different textures and the toast hit that on the spot. Between the crispy bread, mushrooms and sauce. It was a sweet yet delectable treat. 

We did get a bowl of the soup which was a corn chowder. Served chilled. It had an amazing taste. The chives were an awesome touch. However, I didn't realize until that night. I don't like chilled soup. Lol! Its a weird texture. But, if you do, I'd totally recommend you try it. 

Out main meals were. The Cassoulet and the seared sea scallops. 

My meal was the scallops. Talk about amazing. The mixture of brussel sprouts, noodles, scallops and the white sauce was absolutely heavenly. Everything was cooked perfectly and seasoned right.
I loved the fact the brussel sprouts were shredded, it added an awesome texture. 

The Cassoulet. You seriously can not go wrong with this dish. Beans, duck, pork belly, sausage and so many other tasty treats in one pan. The flavors blend together making it the most incredible dish on the menu. 

For our dessert, we had the warm brownie. It was packed with cherries and nuts. Warm and delicious topped with vanilla ice cream. 

It was an incredible meal. If you haven't been here. I'd highly recommend you go! We can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"In Cleveland for a combination book launch/memorial service, and the night before stopped in for dinner. I hadn't been back to Cleveland in nearly a decade after going to graduate school there, and as always I'm fascinated by the look of blighted urban Rust Belt catastrophe (though in Cleveland I like it; go figure) and then suddenly gorgeous little neighborhoods with a Frank Gehry building and a restaurant like L'Albatros. 

I wouldn't have been surprised if the hostess had asked us if we were smoking something when we flew in at 7:45 on a Friday night and expected to be seated. The place was jamming! We barely found a place to stand, but the hostess was nice enough to call another restaurant nearby, found us two cocktail seats, got us a waiter for drinks, and 15 minutes later, just as we were leaving, told us that they'd had a cancellation and could seat us right next to the fireplace. Now that is service.

The table service was great as well: capable, enthusiastic, and put us in an even better mood than we were in already. We warmed up with a beet salad that was divine and both ordered the cassoulette, which came in two little French saute pans with a seared duck breast on top. I was floored. It was so completely delicious. 

The wines were great, very generously poured, and the desserts were wonderful, too. I don't know anything about the chef, being a Bostonian, but I've heard he opens restaurants and fans flock to him. I can see why. Everything about it felt right."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant!!  I came here for dinner with my boyfriend on a Saturday night.  We had reservations at 4:30 and were seated immediately.  I love how trendy and upscale the decor is inside.  I had the roasted trout with almond crust, it was served with crispy green beans.  This is the best trout I've ever had and the portions were perfect.  My boyfriend had the hanger steak and frites.  He ate everything!  The best part of the meal was the dessert...we ordered the warm chocolate brownie.  It was delicious and I wanted more.  The service here is great!  There are different waiters that come to your table for refills, bread, etc.  Overall, I would say if you're in the Cleveland area visit L'Albatros you will definitely not be disappointed."}
{"text":"While visiting some friends in Cleveland, we went for lunch at L'Albatros after some time with the kids at the Cleveland Botanical Garden nearby.  It was a strange, but cool layout and decor.  The open kitchen is front and center when you walk in the front door, with a minimalist, contemporary decorating scheme in the several small dining rooms.  The lunch menu was very appealing, with a variety of open faced sandwiches, pizzas, salads and a large number of entrees.  I started with an arugula salad and the smoked salmon tartin.  Both were very good.  Everyone seemed very pleased with their choices as well.  My friend's burger, even when viewed from across the table, looked excellent.  I even had a bite of the white pizza our daughter had and it was very good.  Now, it probably wasn't the best place to bring our two-year old, but they stuck is in a back corner and we were fine.  I liked L'Albatros a lot and would go back for dinner if visiting Cleveland again."}
{"text":"Holy merde this place is so good!!  

Went this eve with a client and she loved it.  He \"French toast app is actually a savory dish with mushrooms and what seemed to be an almost demiglace sauce on, well, savory French toast.  We also tried the goat cheese tart which was spectacular.  That and a salad would make a fantastic light dinner.  

But then we moved on.  She had the cod and I had trout almandine.  Hers came on spatzele and sauerkraut which we thought was an interesting combo but it turned out to be delightful.  My trout was rocking, crispy and light with a butter sauce to liven things up.  

Dessert was crime caramel and lemon roll with strawberry ice cream.  We certainly didn't neeeeed the dessert but it was worth the extra cals.  

Wine was great and our server, who was awesome, helped us with pairings.   My client loved it and we had a great time.  So happy I was able to bring her to one of my fav Cleveland Hotspots!

Addendum:   They comped me a very nice glass of wine for being a frequent customer.  Bonus points!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is hands down in my top five for Cleveland. Eating here is an absolute treat. We've never had anything short of delicious. Wait staff is always on point. Their familiarity with each dish's ingredients and the wine list is excellent. 

In our visits here, we've especially loved the duck confit, lamb shoulder, cassoulet, fish specials, foie gras and the watercress Caesar. Wine list is excellent. If you go with a group, it's fun to sit in the wine room in the back - a bit of a closet, but you're SURROUNDED BY WINE. 

We will continue to go here as much as possible."}
{"text":"Easily the best restaurant I have been to in Cleveland.

I attended Case Western Reserve University, but never thought to try a restaurant \"on campus\" as a student. However, after reading so many stellar reviews about this place, I decided to finally give it a chance. I actually ate at this restaurant alone and had a phenomenal experience. I ate at the bar and my server seated me to a little corner by myself that was peaceful compared to other bar atmospheres. She was excellent and explained the best features of the menu and I thoroughly enjoyed the fact that she gave me very personalized attention. I am vegetarian, so she explained what dishes are great and what makes them so. I ended up ordering the Root Vegetable Cassoulet because it seemed unique and unlike anything I have ever eaten before. It was served in a really small dish, so at first, I was concerned that I made a mistake in ordering the dish. However, it was SO tasty!! The beans and abundance of vegetables made it extremely filling even though it didn't seem like it would be. The goat cheese taste was perfectly balanced with the white beans and the flavoring of the dish was near perfect. For dessert, I ordered a Creme Caramel and it was simply decadent- probably the best flan-like dessert I have ever had! I don't like sweets with TOO much sugar, so the Creme Caramel was just what I needed. Absolutely amazing. Without a doubt, a star restaurant."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. Nice atmosphere. Good value. Second time here. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Cleveland. When I dine here, I usually order the duck confit (you must try at some point, whether it's your first visit or second...you WILL be coming back!)  The escargots, oysters, scallops, pork two ways... ALL GOOD! I do wish they had a better drink and wine menu. The atmosphere is wonderful, inside or out and the service is nice and laid back. And yes, parking can be a bully here: pay $3 or find a spot and walk! This is a \"no fail\" place for Cleveland, others it's a hit or miss with menu items, so far I haven't tasted anything that disappointed!  À votre santé!"}
{"text":"Came here for a lab lunch. Made a last minute reservation and had no problems.  We also got seated right away once we got to there.  The restaurant was kind of confusing with lots of random walls and turns...I got pretty lost finding the restroom, but it's a very nice space and the workers were nice enough to point me in the right directions :)

One thing that stuck out to me was that instead of leaving a basket of bread for the table the server kept constantly kept refilling each of our bread plates... They came by at least 5-6 times to refill it too!  We were also intrigued by the containers of different colored salt that were on the tables too.  Fancy.  

I ordered the hanger steak and frites which was amazing.  They cut the steak up for you and put a nice bearnaise sauce on top (you can also ask for it on the side).  It was so flavorful and cooked perfectly.  I also tried one of their cocktails, I can't remember which one but it was a good combination of not too sweet and a little bit strong :)

All in all, had a great experience.  Great service and food.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This restaurant was absolutely amazing! I visited Cleveland for the first time as part of a business trip; the folks at the hotel recommended L'Albatros, and I am so glad I went!

The cod was cooked to perfection, and the sauce was delicious. The flavors were unlike anything I have tasted. The staff was courteous and friendly and spent time helping me pick a wine that suited the dish. 

Be sure to book a reservation. I went on a Tuesday night, and the place was packed.

I work in New York City and have dined at many nice restaurants there, but L'Albatros gives those NYC places a run for their money!"}
{"text":"Friday evening on the patio A+ we loved it. Service was very good. Drinks and Appetizers were incredible, we did not order the cheese board but we should have.  Entrée was very good. Loved the atmosphere.  If you're looking for something different and an experience to remember this is definitely the place."}
{"text":"Got the assorted cheese for an appetizer, they have a cheese sommelier who came over with a huge board of about 30 cheeses. It was wonderful, the guy was really into it and we had some stupid good cheeses. 

Dinner was great as well. Girlfriend got chicken, I got braised lamb shoulder.  

There is not much else to say, the staff fills your water glass before you have an opportunity to drink even half the glass. I love this place."}
{"text":"The only really good restaurant near Case campus. They have nice French bread for starters with olive oil and then their salmon and crusted almond fish is amazing too. Do order a side of fries. And still leave room for delicious desserts."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner on a random Wednesday, and surprisingly the place was pretty packed! I get excited when I see thriving businesses in CLE, yay! We made reservations thankfully, so we were seated right away. Although the weather was nice, we decided to sit indoors to avoid the humidity and possible bugs landing on our food (don't really want extra protein in the form of a fly~tempting, but not today Mr. Fly ;p ). The restaurant is quite nice, modern and hip with French music playing softly in the background. The staff came around right away to start us off with some bread. Mmmh, I love my carbs...almost as much as I love my protein...bzzzz! 

So for starters we decided to share the mussels and frites. Even though it is an entrée, it was perfect for a group of four to share. We also decided to get the escargots (it would be a shame if we didn't at least try them). The fries were...well fries, nothing special. The mussels were cooked well, very buttery and tender. The escargot was very soft, not rubbery like I imagined. It didn't have a distinctive flavor of its own, but rather took on the flavors of the sauce it was cooked in. I actually enjoyed the escargot, but the sauce was too rich for me so I only had a couple pieces. 

My friend ordered a red beet soup,which was the soupe du jour. I of course, being a good friend, also tried some of her dish...what are friends for haha. It was a cold soup, with puréed beets. Normally I'm not a big fan of cold soups, but I was a definite fan of this soup!! It was refreshing, and I love the bit of sweetness from the beets. If I go back I'd definitely order it again. 
 
Entrees: Duck confit- meat was very tender and deliciously fatty like duck normally is, but a tad bit too salty. If they went a little lighter on the salt, the dish would've been perfect. 

Roasted cod- the fish was cooked to perfection! It was still moist and not dry, and I loved the garlic spatzle (little dumplings) with creme fraiche. They went a little crazy with the cheese however, so I had to shove some of the cheese to the side of the plate. A little bit goes a long way, the dish is good without that much cheese! 

Croque monsier- from the description it sounded very good. My friend said she had it in France and she loved it. This sandwich was not a petite sandwich that I had imagined though. The bread was very thick and buttered. Smeared between the breads were mustard, LOTS of cheese and pieces of ham. I only had a few bites, which were good, but the sandwich is too rich and heavy for me. If you really want a filling dish, this would probably be a good choice.

Roasted trout with almond crust- my friend devoured this before I even tried a bite. And he cleaned the plate...so I'm guessing it was good?

Dessert:
Creme caramel- I really loved the creme caramel, which was smooth and not overwhelmingly sweet. I want more just thinking about it! 

Chocolate Napoleon- I liked the crispy layers with chocolate in between. It was a good dessert, but I think I would choose the creme caramel again if I had to pick between the two. 

Overall it was a good meal, and I would come back to try other dishes!"}
{"text":"I've now been here a few times, and enjoyed it each time.  A nice bistro menu, with some creative items.  The food has been delicious each time, and the service has been great.  Coming to Cleveland from NYC, I'm particularly tuned in to what a good restaurant can be, and this place is lovely."}
{"text":"I had the best birthday of my life when my husband surprised me with dinner at L'abatros with our closest friends. Neither of us had been here before, and my husband found the restaurant based on Yelp reviews and my intense love for French Cuisine. We were NOT disappointed.

To begin with, the staff was incredible. They seated our party of 10 in the back room, which was private and oh so cozy. Our bread plates and glasses were never empty, and the prompt, professional, attentive staff made for a memorable evening. 

The food was out of this world. Every single item we ordered was splendid. We ordered several of the appetizers, including the savory French Toast, pate, cheese plates, and goat cheese with sun dried tomato. Every dinner guest in our party raved about their entrees. I had the Coq o Vin, and my husband had the short ribs. I ate every bite of my meal, despite the fact that I had no room after all the bread and appetizers. It was just that good. The wine selection is extensive and the staff is very knowledgable about their wines. They helped us select several bottles, which were just wonderful.

My husband brought a cake, which they served and packed up for us when we left. I really can't say enough about every aspect of our dining experience at this quaint upscale restaurant. I can't wait to come back here to dine again."}
{"text":"I had a great meal and dining experience at L'Albatros.  I was traveling for business and a physician I was working with and the shuttle driver, Amy, at the Courtyard Marriott, highly recommended the restaurant. 

I sat at the bar and this was a great decision because Gillian, bartender / server extraordinaire, provided excellent service, food and drink recommendations and interesting conversation.  

L'Albatros has a great selection of French, American wines as well as, wine from other locations around the world. 

I started with the Braised Leeks with Dijon Mustard Sauce and the dish was excellent.  You don't see leeks on the menu in the US like you do in France.  They were served cold on top of very good dijon dressing.

Next, I ordered the Radish and Cucumber Les Salades over mache with red onions and crème fraîche vinaigrette.  The salad was very good and different than something I would normally order.  The rest of the salads on the menu looked amazing too.  

For the main course, I thought that the Seared Sea Scallops with brussel sprouts, noodles and Pernod cream sounded good, but I didn't want noodles.  Gillian suggested substituting the noodles with hericot verts (green beans).  That was a great suggestion and I think should be a permanent option.  It is also cool that the bartender at a French restaurant in Cleveland has lived in France and speaks French.  (added bonus for authenticity)

I was planning on skipping dessert but the Crème Caramel was highly recommended and it did not disappoint.  The dense creamy flan surrounded by deep caramel sauce, a dollop of fresh cream and seasonal berries was amazing.  I'm glad I don't work there or I would eat it every night!"}
{"text":"Wonderful French food, nice ambience and very nice service. A must if you come to Cleveland and love French food as I do."}
{"text":"The portions were huge for our duck confit and scallop dish. The staff was wonderful. Dishes were priced very well. My boyfriend and I were visiting from Seattle and by a quick look at the menu and the prices determined that this would be a fairly casual dining experience (I think we determined that everything in Seattle is just much more expensive), but we were extremely underdressed in our flannels. However, the staff made us feel welcomed. Don't make the same mistake we did and dress up!"}
{"text":"I can't believe that I still haven't reviewed this place-  one of the best spots in Cleveland area! I love everything about this place starting from the minimalistic interior to the wonderful waiters! 
It was a time, that every Wednesday, we would come to L'Albatros to have dinner. Every single Wednesday for straight 2 months, and we have never got tired of it. 
My favorite dish is a roasted cod! However, all food is delicious there. Mostly, I like their soups of the day, cucumber and radish salad, mussels, fois gras and chicken breast. 
The hostess usually makes a good job and remembers their regulars- they know how and where I like to be seated and are super welcoming! 
One more plus, they are willing to make changes to the order. I'm super picky with what I eat, so usually I ask to put any dressing or sauce aside. The kitchen staff always listen to request and often do extra just that a guest will be satisfied with the food. 
A great place for romantic dates, friends encounter or a business lunch. 
And they do have a wonderful summer patio!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice and this rating is an average of both times. (the first time was 5 stars and the second 3 stars). The service was top notch both times, but my wife's steak was charred to bitterness on the second visit. She ordered it Medium Rare and to the chef's credit is did come out Medium Rare, which is no small thing. The way the chef got there however, was to use a very hot sear on the surface of the meat which I suppose is an accepted way to do it, but for it left too much char on the meet for our taste, every bite that included the outside of the steak was bitter. The server said it was supposed to be that way, so we didn't press it but in hindsight we should have sent it back. So the issue was It was our fault for not returning something we didn't like."}
{"text":"This might be the best French food I've had outside of NYC. Escargot were the best I've ever had, and the artichoke with lemon aioli was very good. Chicken livers and frisee salad also were great. Moules Frites were perfect and the scallops were tender, cooked just right and nice amount. The pork plate, which consisted of a brined ham slice, pork belly, pork sausage gave you a taste of several types of pork and all excellent.
Wine list is fairly priced and even though they were out of what we originally ordered the server came up with a different bottle that worked very well."}
{"text":"One the best places in the city. Surprisingly affordable for a restaurant with this much to offer. Don't miss out on the cheese board. Dessert is also a must for the experience. A high standard is set and maintained for the patrons of this establishment. This is the kind of institution that has patrons. I would come once a week if I could afford it. Long live L'Albatros."}
{"text":"Located in the heart of University Circle, L'Albatros is an inviting building with the exterior reminding me of a charming French cottage. 

L'Albatos boasts a private, pay-parking lot ($3). Upon our arrival, the parking lot attendant, a well read man, waived his latest edition of Esquire magazine in front of us and was proud to proclaim the magazine named this very restaurant among the best of 2009! Needless to say, I was excited for our New Year's Eve dinner, if by nothing more than this man's genuine enthusiasm. 

Inside, the decor is chic & minimalist. Deep red brick floors with clean white tables and seating. The lighting was appropriate for an intimate dinner. Floor to ceiling sliding glass doors on one wall overlook a brick lined private courtyard for better weather dining. I can't wait to come back in the summer. 

The drink list was plenty acceptable, particularly the beer list. Among other things, a Belgian caught my eye by the name of Duvel Green. The menu also consisted of multiple Lambic varieties by Lindemans. As a beer snob, I found this pretty impressive. 

For an hors d' oeuvre, we ordered the Oysters on the half shell with mignonette sauce. Refreshing and clean tasting. A great start to a meal. 

As an entrée and being this is a French restaurant, I had to order something appropriate. I settled on the Duck Confit. Poached in it's own fat, the duck legs had a crispy outer skin with a moist, dark meat interior. Accompanying the dish was a celery root puree. Very tasty and a nice compliment. 

For dessert, I finished the meal with a cup of coffee and the Warm Chocolate Brownie with creme aglaise & vanilla bean ice cream. Rich, moist, sinful and filling. A perfect cap to an outstanding meal. 

Turns out the parking attendant's praise of this charming Neo-French Brasserie was well warranted! Congrat's L'Albaros. You won a spot on my \"Top 3 in the CLE\" list."}
{"text":"I came here as a suggestion from my boss with my best friend who was in from out of town. First off, when I called for Terrace seating they told me we could come at either 4:30pm or 9 pm. So we chose the 4:30pm slot only to find the place nearly vacant until 6:30pm. Our waiter, Keith, looked like he would rather have his appendix out than wait on us. I am not sure if it was because he assumed we were poor college kids (we are actually doctors) or if he just dislikes serving. In any case he never cracked a smile or even said more than a few words. 

In terms of the food. The escargot was wonderfully cooked. The cheese course was fantastic as well. I ordered the braised lamb but found it a bit over salted and found myself expecting a more substantive pasta with it. The menu states it was a risotto but it looked and tasted like Israeli couscous. I think a pappardelle or cavatappi  would have paired better. My friend got the scallops which were cooked well but the paired pasta again was not impressive and was actually undersalted and a little bland. 

Then we were literally attacked by slew of flies and bees and had to relocate toward the bar. The surrounding wait staff was extremely helpful in moving us but our actual waiter Keith stood at a distance and made not motion to help. To see if things would improve we ordered dessert and drinks at the bar. The creme Carmel was excellent but the blueberry mint julep was a bit misproportioned. Overall we bolted out of there by 7 pm (still room for seating) and will be hesitant to return again as the food didn't overwhelmingly win us over."}
{"text":"I've been coming for many years, and it is still excellent. The kitchen puts out a consistently good product every time. I go back for favorites, but always include a different choice each time... The escargot was a new treat, very different than your usually present butter and garlic. I really was reticent to share a taste w my table mates! Service is always on point too."}
{"text":"Been there five times, the first one was a big disappointment. We had chicken liver and fois gras mousseline, fresh half oysters, French onion soups, hunger steak, duck confit and cassoulet. The appetizers were pretty good, oysters very fresh, chicken liver very smooth and fragrant, which made us expecting the entrees really bad. However the soups and the entrees were not at all satisfying. Only the guy ordered the steak was not complaining about the taste, but also, he said the portion was too small. The soups were fine at first, but it was getting worse when we had the beef on the bottom, they were way too salty! Same problems with the entrees, too salty! None of us finished our dishes( except for the steak, he instead expected more). This experience protected me from having dinner there again for a long time, and then a friend of mine ensured me that the mussels was very good, I thought 'ok, I am gonna give it another try, anyway the chicken liver is delicious, I really miss that.' And my friend was not lying! Everything we had at the second time were great! I finally saw where all these good reviews on yelp came from. Now I went there alone for diner on a regular basis, normally I would only have some appetizers and salad/soup but sometimes I will have their daily special entrees. I recommend the French toasts, chicken liver, mussels, cheese plate and creme caramel for dessert. This is a actually a really good restaurant and if you don't have a good time the first time, just give it another try, I am 90% sure you will find something you like there."}
{"text":"Although my Choucroute Garnie was very salty (the sauce), I still give L'Albatros 4 stars.  There were certain elements of the dish that saved the day.  The Pork Belly in the Choucroute was so tender it was like butter and the sausages-which were probably made in house no doubt was my favorite part of the dish.  The Terrine du Chef was the best part of the meal- Not only was it beautiful to look at, but it was beautiful in flavor as well.  I was really pleased to see that they had Vouvray on their Wines by the Glass list-it's my favorite white wine and a lot of restaurants don't offer it. I really like the ambience in L'Albatros and I always feel special when I go there, whether it's for a girl's night, happy hour or a romantic date. The service is impeccable and it really adds to the experience."}
{"text":"Amazing! Order the cheese board it will knock your socks off! The atmosphere is incredible and service spectacular. It's a must visit in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Fabulous...this place has tremendously flavored food with the comfort of a warm atmosphere.

EVERYTHING was good. We shared 5 dishes and from the warm bread to the delightful main courses of short ribs and duck...wow.

When in Cleveland...take in a touch of Paris at this gem."}
{"text":"Having dined in various fancy restaurants across the country and the world . I have tried top notch places. L'Albatros  will remain as one of my favorites amongst the other few. 

Visiting L'Albatros is a must if you are one such as I am who is willing to explore Cleveland area. 

 We went there for our dinner. The place is very well set up and provides a perfect cozy winter ambience with fire place, other nicely done interior set up, extremely attentive and treat-guests-special kind of  service.

 They have a very good selection of wine and other special drinks. In fact, our waiter understood what I wanted and suggested a really nice wine . For appetizers , French toast,  I thought it is a must to try( our waiter suggested on this selection too). It was delicious. I tried Soupe De Jour for the soup , then  I tried chicken confit and a dessert called chocolate Napoleon. Over all, more than satisfied and definitely would like to visit again ! Hats off to the Chef.  One of the best I have tasted when it comes to French Cuisine. 

  I was even happier with the menu prices which is very reasonable on your wallet. 

A must visit for the forth coming valentines day! Make your reservations :-) for a perfect evening!!!"}
{"text":"Best French food I've had in awhile! Waiter was very nice and attentive. We came for Cleveland dining week in November 2017 and it was so good. We will be back again and we visit Ohio."}
{"text":"Great restaurant. Very upscale and yet very comfortable at the same time. That's a rare combo. Exceptional food and service."}
{"text":"This is by far the best French restaurant that I've been to. Cozy, charming, good menu, cool staff, classy ambience, delicious food at a very affordable price. What more can you ask for?! I was in Cleveland for five weeks and have dined at this place at least a dozen times (both lunch and dinner combined). Really really impressed. Looking forward to visiting again!!"}
{"text":"I first came here when I was interviewing for a job in Cleveland and have been back regularly since I moved here.  The food and drink are superb and the service is excellent. The outside area is very nice in the summer and the bar inside is nice for a quick dinner and glass of wine.  I highly recommend their arugula salad!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I both feel that this is our favorite restaurant that Cleveland has to offer. The food is unique and exquisitely delicious. The service is always superb. Best of all, the prices are reasonable. I recommend the cheese platter. They bring a large selection with a variety of cheeses. The portions are generous and the staff is knowledgeable of every cheese offered."}
{"text":"Parking was easy, dedicated lot for $3. Ambiance is beautiful and the food is delish. They have a guy that comes around to show off and explain the different cheeses they offer, which I thought was particularly unusual. 

Now, for the main part, the food. Got the cassoulet as many yelpers recommended. The lamb was spectacular. The duck was a bit dry for my taste and was not \"fall off the bone\" as others described. Now, I am no noob to duck, so was not impressed with preparation. The sausages were very sweet, but still tasty. Portion was large enough to feed a rhino.

Verdict: would return. 
Tip: sit on the patio, it's very nice."}
{"text":"I really genuinely believe L'Albatros is one of the best restaurants in Cleveland, period.

Even if you think you're not a fan of French food, everything is still incredibly enticing, and this restaurant will change your mind. I've never actually ordered something on the menu I didn't like. My go-to here is the pork two ways-- but tonight, I tried the special, the short rib, and it was equally amazing. There's something about L'Alb's cooking methods... every bite, even down to a garnish, is bursting with flavor. The chefs here know what they are doing.

If you're in the mood for charcuterie, L'Alb does an incredible spread that they bring to you table side. The gal working tonight was incredibly knowledgable about every single cheese, and it was remarkably impressive. 

Coupled with their delicious craft cocktails, its impossible to not walk away happy. We had the Cellar Door (which had a red wine float), and the Black Dahlia (fernet branca base), and each was super unique and satisfying.

For dessert, we had the pistachio cake, and it was honestly the best dessert i've ever had in a restaurant in Cleveland. The cake is big enough to split for two, and the burnt butter cream frosting that thickly coats the cake is divine. 

In sum, L'Alb is an incredible place. Its a place for foodies, its a place for a romantic date, or a place just for a lovely dinner. If you don't go there at least once, you're doing yourself a tremendous disservice."}
{"text":"Sweet Jesus, this is an awesome place. While I am generally the type who feels way more comfortable in dives than in swanky places, I gotta say that the meal I had at this place was pretty damn near impeccable. It was a family get-together, so there were about 15 of us, but our reservation said as much and they were ready when we got there on a busy Saturday night. For one, the service at this place was really astounding. They were there to refill drinks (and even the cheapos like me drinking water) and the like constantly. 

But of course service only goes so far -- at a restaurant, it's all about the food (duh). And boy does this place deliver. I only got the house burger with a salad, but even that was probably one of the best burgers I've ever had, much more rich and delicious than your usual restaurant fare. Everyone at my table ordered something different, so I can also say that (at least bites) of the roasted cod and pork two ways were phenomenal. And, for what you get, the prices are absolutely reasonable for this level of fine dining. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went here on Sunday night for our anniversary dinner and it was spectacular!  We started out with a glbc chillwave and he had a cocktail (I can't remember the name, but it was so good that I ordered it for my second drink).  Our appetizers were oysters and braised leeks.  The leeks were good, but the oysters were great.  I had the roast cod with spaetzle and we shared a side of farfele with mushrooms.  Both were fantastic.  The cod was perfectly cooked and seasoned.   The service was on point and the atmosphere was perfect.  We had been here for lunch a few years ago and weren't impressed, but I'm so glad we gave it another shot.  This may be the best upscale restaurant in Ctown."}
{"text":"Really great service. You're treated really well here. Pricier but the food was great. Loved the wine selection."}
{"text":"A true gem in Cleveland.

Ambience is sleek, modern, and romantic.

Food is flavorful. (Had the pork/veal pate, porkbelly salad, cassoulet)

Cocktails are good.

Service is excellent.

Price is reasonable.

And? They have FEVER TREE! My FAVORITE tonic water. For $2!!!"}
{"text":"The food and wine were really excellent, as was the ambiance on the patio, but I would agree with several others in saying it is a bit overpriced.  Brasserie food should not cost $50 a person.  

Nonetheless, if you don't mind the price, I thought the mushroom french toast appetizer was heavenly.  I also enjoyed the goat cheese tart, the special goat cheese pasta, and the chocolate raspberry napoleon.  

My fellow diners enjoyed the duck and cassoulet, but since the patio was pretty dark, found it challenging to eat food off the bone."}
{"text":"Fancy French never tasted so good... 

Nestled in the Case Western Reserve University community we sat outside enjoying the early fall air but this day was particularly warm so sitting facing the sun wasn't the best choice.

 I had the flank steak with pomme frites... which was on point!   I polished it off with a Leffe Blonde since they were a little short on their French brews and I wasn't interested in any wine at the time.

I'd go again just wouldn't sit in front of the sun...the ambiance is pretty chic but not pretentious which is really hard to pull off.  

I enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"Love this place! L'Albatros will be a new go-to. I spent my birthday there with my family and we all had a lovely experience. 

The ambience is nice, with windows and a beautiful fireplace. 

Our waitress was attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable. What more can one ask for? Professional, friendly service like that is the absolute best. 

I ordered a small salad to begin with, which was fresh, dressed perfectly, and just downright delicious. 
I ordered the cassoulet for the main meal and it was amazing. Hot, savory, flavorful- I have no complaints. It was served in a skillet and the portion was HUGE. Everyone tried some and I ate more than I normally do, and still had some to take home. Each person at our table was very pleased with their salads, main courses, and drinks. My dinner was so good I can't say I tried anyone else's or even paid much attention to it, which is rare! 

Both of the wines I tried were very good as well- I had one with dinner and one with dessert. 

Lest I forget to mention dessert! The creme caramel I had was absolutely delicious. Texture, flavor, everything- YUM. Others tried it and loved it as well. My dad got the creme fraiche cheesecake with (I think?) a berry sauce. I tried a little bite and it was very good as well. I say this as someone who normally does not like cheesecake- but this was light and refreshing rather than heavy like many cheesecakes out there."}
{"text":"Overall a pretty crappy dinner experience. Combination of poor service and bad food. The latter I will take some responsibility for because I ordered things I had never had, though I watch enough food network I felt I knew what to expect. The former is inexcusable at a place this high end.

Poor Service:
-We had a reservation and arrived about 15 minutes early. The hostess said we could wait at the bar. We accepted b/c we had planned to do that anyway. We sat at the bar for 45 minutes waiting. One of us finally went back up to the hostess(now 30mins after our reservation). Our table had been waiting for us but the hostess didn't come get us, even though we told her we would be waiting at the bar. No apology, no offer of reconciliation.

-Service was slow. LONG lags between visits from our server. Food took a long time to come out(this was at 9-10pm). Entrees were delivered while some were still eating salads... all minor things since we weren't in any hurry. But contributed to the overall bad service.

-Our server in particular was very thoughtless and inefficient. When he returned at the end of our entrees he asked if we were finished. I said that I had called it quits and didn't want to take the rest home. So he takes my plate. Then without out asking the 2 ladies I was with if they were done, he starts collecting their dishes and putting trash from the table on top of their half eaten meals!!! So we have to stop him and tell him that they want their leftovers boxed up. So he takes 1 person's dish to go box up. We wait quietly for 5-7 minutes for his return. NOW he asks the other person if they want a box too, takes the plate and we wait another 5 minutes. Seriously?! You couldn't take both at the same time. And he finally brings a dessert menu and we have to wait another 10 minutes for his return to order. For sake of length, this is just 1 example of the inefficiency and thoughtlessness that detracted from what should have been a pleasant dining experience.

Bad Food:
Again, this could be reworded to say \"I didn't like the food I ordered\" but oh well, it's my review.

-Appetizer: TERRINE DU CHEF Am I an experienced pate eater, absolutely not. But in my mind, pate is a smooth paste like consistency and that's what I expected. Instead i got a few slices of hard, dense, not flavorful meat concoction in loaf form. 

The salads my friends got looked and tasted very good though.

-Entree: CASSOULET Have I ever had cassoulet before? No. But I've seen Anthony Bourdain  make it on the Cleveland episode of No Reservations. I'm expecting a dish of white beans that have been stewed in a flavorful porridge with various types of meat. Is that what they serve? No. They ladle some not very tender beans in a not very flavorful sauce onto the dish. Then they place small portions of various meats(duck, lamb, sausage) on top. Everything was cooked separately and only came together for the final dish. Flavors had not mingled and melded together into a cohesive dish. Everything was on it's own and just tasted weird.

Admittedly, if I had ordered different dishes I would probably feel better about this place, but overall this visit was a FAIL."}
{"text":"Last week my boyfriend and I decided to start out our long weekend with a trip to L'Albatros Brasserie and Bar. I'd read a favorable review on Yelp which indicated that there were \"multiple\" vegetarian options, so I felt I should give L'Albatros a try. (Especially after I looked at the menu online and saw that there's an entire section of the menu devoted to vegetarian items. Yay!)

So...I made a reservation and happened to arrive a smidge early. The hostess was extremely friendly and told us that it would be a few minutes until a a table outside would be ready and then escorted us to a really nice outdoor lounge to wait for our table.

I was really impressed with how nice the patio was. I really felt like I was in the backyard of a home pictured in Better Homes and Gardens or on a TLC show.  Needless to say, the ambiance scored major points with us.

We started out our meals with beverages. I had the L'Albatros - which consisted of absinthe, pineapple juice, lime juice, mint, and lemon lime soda. I think that combination of ingredients might be an acquired taste, but it wasn't horrible. My boyfriend had a beer. A beer is a beer to me since I don't drink them, so I have nothing to say about that.

Feeling extra hungry, I decided to order the mixed greens salad to start. It was a good salad. But I think it's fairly challenging to make a bad salad. When it came time to order our entrees, our waitress was extremely knowledgeable and helpful, asking questions about our preferences to see what entrees might best fit our taste preferences. My boyfriend got the hanger steak and frites and thought it was excellent. I decided on the root vegetable cassoulet, a creamy, mix of vegetables with goat cheese and breadcrumbs. It wasn't quite what I expected when I placed the order but it was definitely very good. 

However, the highlight of our entire meal, besides the amazing ambiance and on the spot service was dessert. I've blogged about brownies more times than I can count, but I can honestly say that the warm chocolate brownie dessert that I shared with my boyfriend was the best brownie I've ever eaten in my life. Hands down. It was really a masterpiece. If it hadn't been too dark to take a picture, I may have framed the image to look longingly at whenever I'm hungry. Why was it so spectacular? First of all, it was a dark chocolate brownie, which made it extra rich. Secondly, it was perfectly warm - so the chocolate melted in your mouth leaving a rich chocolate flavor. Partnered with vanilla bean ice cream, the chocolate and vanilla flavors really left a great lingering sensation desserty goodness. That's the best way I can describe it. It was really quite incredible. Think delicious lava cake but a thousand times better.

I can definitely say that I'll go back to L'Albatros to enjoy the fantastic patio and the amazing dessert. I love supporting local businesses that recognize the importance of good service and also providing vegetarian options. (Hats off to you, Zachary Bruell!) If you're looking for a great place to have a relaxing and delicious meal, please run, don't walk, to L'Albatros."}
{"text":"First off, this is not my usual choice for dining. I was taken here on a business lunch.
That having been said, the place is beautiful. We sat on the patio and the trellises are covered in flowers. It feels like a fairy tale.
I had salmon and a tasty salad with romano and lemon. 
The food was very good and the staff was nice. 
This is a night out place, special occasion place or maybe the perfect place to pop the question. 
The guy that took me here, well this was one of his usual haunts, but he's loaded so..... 
Anyway, great place. Pricey but yummy."}
{"text":"I would say this is one of Zack Bruell's better restaurants overall.  The seafood here is pretty good.  I've tried the cod, the trout, and the scallops - all were cooked to the right level of doneness, and had good flavor profiles.  The meat, however, is a different story.  The veal short rib had a bad aftertaste and (according to my friend) the duck tasted sort of plain.

Their service -  it's good in the sense that they refill your glasses pretty regularly.  As other people have mentioned, they also constantly replenish your bread without your asking, and sometimes without you even noticing.  So be careful!  On the other hand though, I came here once with a party of 8, and it took a good two hours for the food to arrive.  I understand we had a large party, but two hours?  Also, this restaurant is on Case Western's campus, so you might be served by an undergraduate.   Whether that is a good thing or a bad thing is up to you to decide ;)"}
{"text":"Wow! I went into this place knowing my friends loved it but had no idea what was on the menu. We ate like queens. Our table sampled 5 cheeses, the charcuterie, the mushroom French toast, and we each got entrees and dessert. Let's just say, we took leftovers home. 

You must try the cheese - it's theatrical and beautiful and such a hard decision not to try them all! There was a coffee crusted one that was perfection and one with a berry in it. Yum! To make it better, the bread keeps on flowin. 

I am so happy I had the opportunity to come here and try it out. 

Note: there is parking for $5 in the lot out front, but find street parking if you can! This is one of my favorite areas in Cleveland - take a stroll through it."}
{"text":"Food is consistently excellent here.  The menu is a bit eclectic and may not appeal to everyone.  Service is always friendly and outstanding.  The servers obviously enjoy their jobs and it is reflected in their attitudes.

This is one of Zack Bruell's places and he has a knack for running professionally staffed restaurants."}
{"text":"This restaurant highlights the true French aspects of the style of cuisine. A gorgeous menu bursting with wonderful flavours, choices and a lovely wine selection also.
This restaurant really has a wonderfully quiet location and the service is super."}
{"text":"We are out-of-town visitors from New York City and consider ourselves foodies...  we also spend a lot of time in the south of France.  This restaurant offers truly authentic south-west French cooking, with many choices not often found in the us.  We ordered the French toast with wild mushrooms appetizer, a savory dish that was exquisite... and for the main course  the short ribs and cassoulet... both perfection.   

What also impressed us was the wine list.  Great choices, reasonable prices... try a BANDOL and discover a new region of France.

... now all we have to do is hope that the Cavaliers win the NBA championship and pull off a miracle"}
{"text":"This is the impeccable spot - great food, attentive and personable service also surprisingly fair pricing. My boyfriend and I came here last year and had a memorable experience. We visited again this year and wish we could have this restaurant in Atlanta where we live. Would recommend to everyone!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants! At first the idea of French food didn't seem too appealing to me until I gave this restaurant a shot. Usually I get their arugula and radicchio salad as a starter and the roasted chicken. The Creme Caramel for dessert is DIVINE! Restaurant itself is very chic and quaint, very European. Always a nice staff and zero complaints from me."}
{"text":"Best in Cleveland. This is by far one of my favorite restaurants in Cleveland. Everything from the ambience to the service to the food is excellent, I have never had a bad meal here. My top favorites are the mushroom French toast, Frisse Salad with egg on top, pork rillets and escargot for starters. For main dinner options the mussles and the cod with spaetzel are my top choices. You can't go wrong with any of the dinner choices as well as there offering of pizzas. Each day of the week they also offer a nightly special.
Excellent drink menu as well. The Delice was one of my top favorites. 
The best part of this restaurant is there cheess board which you can order for an appetizer or dessert. Our waiter was very knowledgable on every cheese and helped us make a great selection. Highly recommend this place for small groups, date nights or special occasions."}
{"text":"L'Albatros is THE best French Restaurant in the Cleveland area.  There...I said it...You get what you pay for here which, is not always the case for this type of cuisine.  Beautiful restaurant and the food is perfectly prepared.  I started off with the Escargot and Chicken Liver/Fois Gras Mousseline as appetizers.  Duck Confit was my entree choice that evening.  What more can I say?  L'Albatros...C'est magnifique!"}
{"text":"Been here twice and both times amazing!  I love the steamed artichoke, so flavorful you don't even need the dipping sauce.  Their happy hour is a great deal and the fried cauliflower are to die for (don't tell my mom but they might be better than hers).  The mussels and frites are crazy good and the spicy mayo they put on the fries is so tasty (I am not usually a mayo on fries kinda gal but theirs is so great!).  I wasn't crazy about the radicchio and arugula salad, the dressing was kinda off, but everything else was so stellar.  The happy hour is an amazing deal if you don't have the ducets to spend on the full priced menu."}
{"text":"Took my parents and DH here to celebrate my birthday.  The French Toast and Goat Cheese Tart were delicious.  Definitely must trys, and I say this as someone in an uneasy truce with mushrooms (FT is covered in the squishy lil buggers).  Between us we had the cod, chicken confit, lamb, potato soup, French onion soup, and the chop salad.  All were thoroughly enjoyed although the potato soup was reportedly a little bland and my confit was a little too...confit.  What?  Well, the meat was fantastic, but the plating features spaetzle and fewer veg than I expected from the description.  This along with the garlic jus made for a very heavy and one dimensional dish.  Confit is a naughty treat and my poor palate and stomach would have appreciated something clean and bright to balance it out.  Instead the spaetzle just soaked up the flavor and became sort of an essence of confit... too much.  

We would have loved to have had desert and indeed had two hours set aside for the meal, but despite us mentioning we wanted desert things went too slowly following dinner (our empty plates sat foreverrrrrr) and we ran out of time.  We did come back that night after an event to have desert.  It was interesting to see the contrast in service- our first server was very friendly and sweet, but when we told our second server it was just desert for us he was fairly cold and didn't interact much.  We didn't feel very welcome.  As a former server I can understand why, but he didn't even try to hide his annoyance.  It was like a switch went off and his personality fell down the rabbit hole.  So pacing at the first sitting and service at the second lose a star for me, but we'll be back to try again because we did really enjoy our meal.  Great place to bring people, I don't know why but I got the feeling it would be consistent and you wouldn't have one of those embarrassing dinners where you raved about the place but the chef has an off night.  The atmosphere is modern but warm and very bustling."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I have been here maybe 8 times and every time I go I am impressed with the food. It was my first french restaurant and inspired me to seek out others, and now I realize that I love french cuisine. The service is always great too, they seem to be very well staffed even at off hours. 

The outdoor patio here is probably my favorite outdoor patio in Cleveland. The way it is secluded, well designed, cool candle/tiki lighting... there is very little not to love. Well, except for the price. I would come here more often if it was a little less expensive."}
{"text":"Ordered the frisée salad - it was good, though all the bacon chunks were a bit overpowering. Ordered the lamb as a second course, but it wasn't put into the system until I had already taken out my credit card since the wait was so long. Parking attendant was rude. Workers chatted more amongst themselves than paid attention to the fact that I was done with my salad for twenty minutes waiting in the duck."}
{"text":"Was surprised to see that here you are going to an upscale restaurant that is pricey to begin with and they charge you money to park in their lot. Really!  The food was delicious though.  We had the veal ribs and the lamb shoulder.The meat was exceptionally tender and the flavors were there. Service was excellent.  When it can time for dessert, we were excited to try the pistachio cake.  It was not as good as anticipated. The cake was drying out and the icing was way too thick and sweet."}
{"text":"L'Albatros is one of those rare cases for me that nails everything except for the food. Unfortunately, this means that I have no choice but rate it as 2/5 stars.

The waiters/waitresses were professional and courteous; atmosphere was done right; interior design was excellent; bright sunny days. Both times we visited during lunch (in summer - in the patio - and winter - indoors), the stage was set.

The food here is simply too rich for my palate. Both me and my date found ourselves unable to finish our food halfway through the meal simply not because we were full, but because we were starting to become nauseated at how fatty the meal was.

The first time we split an onion soup and Terrine du Chef for appetizers. So far so good. The onion soup was rich, and the Terrine du Chef was light and complex in flavors. Once the entrees arrive, however, the meal went downhill. The Duck Confit was cooked too dry. Paired with a bed of sweet potatoes and (also sweet) braised cabbage, the meal simply became too overwhelming to consume.

The second time, we ordered a smoked salmon plate to start - again, so far so good. I followed it with a Confit of Chicken pizza and my date with a Cassoulet. We didn't finish half of the plates because of how rich they were.

I really want to like L'Albatros - I've heard (unanimously) great things about it. Unfortunately, I don't think my stomach can handle the food. I'm not sure what went wrong, but I don't think I'll be coming back for a third try."}
{"text":"This place is top flight every time I eat here.  

Charming ambiance, impeccable service, fantastic food all in one.  We have gone three different times and it has been the same experience every time.  This place is a must in Cleveland.  You can eat anything that you want and it will perfect, but aside from the food...let me address the service, which is a big deal to me as I feel that customer service in this country is almost dead.

It's not that they know that they are serving at a classy restaurant as much as they are professional and the best at their occupation.  The refills are timed perfectly, bread service is proper, trips to the table by the primary server are exactly correct.  All the way down to the dropping of the check, it is right.

Ambiance is perfect if you want to go to the small bar and have a drink before or after your meal or if you want to have a small group for dinner.  This place is perfect for a really nice dinner, anniversary or showcasing Cleveland food to a friend from out of town.

This place tops my chart for Cleveland restaurants."}
{"text":"Very romantic, nice patio and excellent overall ambiance. The food is high quality and very accommodating service too!"}
{"text":"This French inspired restaurant is unbelievable. The hostesses greeted my father and I with the biggest smiles and seemed so happy to see us. We were seated right away in a warm dark environment and served water and bread right away. 

The \"French toast\" appetizer was amazing. Especially if you're a mushroom lover. Such a unique taste, you won't want to miss out on this hors d'oeuvre. Then we split the poached egg salad. (I forget the exact name) This was an appropriate amount for both of us even thought we split it. The dressing was unique also. It was a little zingy which made it different. Then, I ordered the duck confit. It came with two good sized duck legs. They were super moist and exploding with flavor! It also came with a side of a type of mashed sweet potato.. I've never had it before but it was great! My father got the cod which he was was very different but very tasty. 

Our water glasses and bread plates were always full. The service was top notch and the manager, hostesses and our waiter were so pleasing. 

Don't miss out on this place, you'll truly remember it for its unique French cuisine."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance and great tasting food.  I had the skate wing, and tried some of the roasted chicken.  Both were prepared well, and had good sized portions.  The skate wing wasn't the best I've had, but it was pretty close.  The chicken was juicy and tender.  We were seated at a window overlooking the patio, which made for a nice view.

I'd like to go here again to try their happy hour."}
{"text":"L'Albatros is definitely on my list of top 5 restaurants in Cleveland.  It's located in the same area of Case Western Reserve University that also includes Glidden House, The Barking Spider, and Arabica Coffeehouse.  I would advise that you grab coffee at the Coffeehouse, go to happy hour at the Barking Spider, and then get dinner at L'Albatros.  Here's a great combination all within walking distance of each other.

I've tried many things on the menu and just as many things which aren't on the menu.  Half the time I go here, the special sounds so good that I end up ordering it.  And I'm never disappointed.  My usual go-to dish here is the cassoulet, which consists of pork belly, sausages, and duck confit served in a stew of beans and vegetables.  The cassoulet is served in a skillet and has plenty of food.  Alternatively, you can order the pork items and duck confit separately if you prefer one or the other.  The French onion soup, served in a bread bowl, is fantastic.  Fish dishes are done well.  For those of you who are less adventurous, the L'Albatros burger is also a great item to order.

Make sure you save room for dessert.  The chocolate napoleon is huge - it consists of smooth, chocolate cream inside flaky wafers.  I most recently ordered the chocolate tart, which had great texture and blended well with the sauce served with it.

Lastly, I want to remark on how great the value is here.  You get large portions and fabulous food for very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"This place is IMPECCABLE.
 
Beyond the charming, swanky, warm interior and patio, the level of service and attentiveness received here on two separate dining occasions in one weekend has surpassed all expectations.

Dined here solo for lunch on their perfect patio on a Thursday(salmon pate appetizer with pickled veggies, 3 cheese plate) and hosted an event for about 20 guests on a Saturday. Both times in awe of the professionalism from staff all around. 

The service here exceeds the 'routine' and is actually anticipatory of and tailored to guests needs.

There's a reason it's *always* busy, no matter the time of day.

One of the best dining destinations in Cleveland and could shine anywhere.

A gem!"}
{"text":"One if the finest restaurants Cleveland has to offer. From ambience to professional staff to wine selection and if course food, everything is perfect. Been there for lunch, happy hours and dinner. Great patio and outdoor seating. Truly an amazing dining experience and always consistent. This is our favorite Zack B restaurants."}
{"text":"I came here for an anniversary dinner :), and it was lovely. It was a winter night which made the restaurant look super cute, like a toasty cabin in the snow. Service was accommodating, we were seated quickly (had a reservation).

We didn't order much here, so I can only speak for a small portion of the menu. The bread they serve is a little dry and I wasn't super fond of the olive oil, but the entrees were so delicious. We ordered Veal Short Rib and Braised Leg of Lamb (so soft and flavorful; I love lamb!). It was a nice portion for a fancier restaurant, and both came in a soupy risotto sauce. They are very nice and happily substituted sides since one of us did not like the default mushroom risotto =P

The noise level in the restaurant is medium, it made me feel more intimate with my boyfriend since it was loud enough to make me wall myself off to my own table. Lighting was mood. Overall I had a wonderful experience, because the occasion was particularly special to me.. :)"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful!!!! Not sure how I had never heard of it before because I love cheese and they have an awesome selection of different cheeses. They literally bring out a huge cart with different cheeses and you pick what you want. All of the servers are very very knowledgable about the food and ingredients and how the meal is prepared. The food was delicious and atmosphere is great. I had the special for the evening which was Walleye and Lobster Quenelle. It was very good. Others in my party had the Roasted Cod which was amazing and the Cassoulet which was very good. The prices were reasonable and I will definitely be coming back for more cheese!!"}
{"text":"The selection of food was good.  There was a nice selection of well crafted vegetarian dishes.  My only complaint is the service could have been more attentive.  We were a large group and often the server would come and take 1 or 2 of our drink orders but skip a person."}
{"text":"A gem of a restaurant. My meal was delicious, starting with their \"French toast\" appetizer, a melange of tasty mushrooms juxtaposed with a buerre blanc. My husband's veal short rib was delicious and tender, well partnered with a  mushroom risotto, and my root vegetable cassoulet was excellent. Finally, we paired a Tokaji dessert wine with an unusual, but well-designed raspberry chocolate Napoleon, bringing out the delicious chocolate notes in the Tokaji. The service was excellent, the restaurant well hidden (my favorite kind) and the meal leisurely."}
{"text":"This place is delicious for French food this side of the pond.  I have only been here once but everything I tasted was top notch...right down to the sea salt and olive oil they serve with the bread before the entree.

I had the cassoulet (braised white beans with lamb, duck confit and sausages) which was absolutely perfect.

If I lived in Cleveland (my husband is from there), I would frequent this French gem on a regular basis...the entire menu sounds delicious, the atmosphere is relaxing yet contemporary, and the service is excellent."}
{"text":"Was visiting and came here for a late lunch. Very good service. Creative menu with top ingredients for a fair price. Enjoyed it all from the salad to the frozen souffle."}
{"text":"The place to dine if you have anything to do in the University Circle area (or just want to nosh on flavorful food with a French flair).

Think Lola, but Chef Bruell has actually seen a vegetable and knows how to cook one...well.

Think French, but without the undue pomp and pretentiousness oft associated with the genre.

Before you dine, take a look at the pictures on their website - food porn!  And what comes out to your table matches up.

My party had two variations on the traditional French cassoulet.  One with lamb, duck, and sausage, and one vegetarian version.  The meat was well prepared:  duck was moist, as was the lamb, but neither was overly fatty.  The vegetarian cassoulet was was robust and complex.  The vegetables had consistency so one didn't feel like they were eating a spiced vegetable mush.  The menu said that some items were made for those going to the orchestra (i.e. fast).  Our waiter described this as \"made the morning of.\"  This is great if you're looking for a meal on the run, as many visiting University Circle are, but I wonder how much better the dishes would have been if they were prepared fresh at the time of ordering rather than heated up from the morning.

Dessert was very good, but not outstanding.  The caramalization on the Pineapple Tarte Tatin was tough which made for awkward eating.  For the price, I'd rather drive up Cedar Hill to La Gelateria for dessert."}
{"text":"When I go to a restaurant I like to enjoy the whole experience. I cannot say that I did for this restaurant. The food you will have will be good or fair. but the people who will be sitting around you will most likely be rude and pretentious and that does not make a good restaurant experience. The restaurant is very very cramped no room to have an extra helping. When it comes down to it I just could not recommend this place to a friend even though several friends have recommended this place to me. I for one couldn't do the same. The food I had was just okay. I got the duck confit it was just ok. I was expecting to be a little more wowed here. The best part of our meal was our appetizer I believe it was a goat cheese tart that was really good. But the beef in wine my girlfriend got she didn't even finish it she took it home and sat in her fridge."}
{"text":"Oh my favorite, my favorite! If you ask me where I want to go for a special meal in Cleveland, I have my answer. It doesn't even have to be a full meal. Let's just go for cheese and wine! 

The first couple of times, boyfriend and I went for dinner in the wintertime. We sat inside and dined by candlelight and it was all very romantic and elegant and... even sultry? (I guess it depends who you go with. I see groups of businessmen there and I'm sure they're not having a sultry evening with each other, though I shouldn't assume.) If you order cheese, the cheese guy comes out with a platter of a myriad different cheeses. He asks you what kind of cheese you like and doesn't judge you if you don't know but instead guides you along by asking questions about your preferences. I have yet to be disappointed by the cheeses I've gotten. It's like the cheese guy knows me better than I do! 

Cassoulet is my go-to. It's rich and hearty, full of delicious meats, and scrumptious wonderful. It comes in a skillet, which makes you feel all the more special. Veal short rib is boyfriend's go-to. Also so delicious amazing. Melts in your mouth and so much flavor. Both highly recommended, especially if you want to warm up on a cold night. 

Eating out on the patio in the summer is a whole different experience. Sun shining, surrounded by trees and hedges, hidden from the rest of the world - It's like being on vacation. More laid back and relaxing than indoors, which is more intimate. For a more summery dish, try the skate wing. Sooo skate is like a flipping stingray and if you Google image it, it's rather scary looking. And still a little odd-looking when it's cooked and sitting on your plate. But it's so wonderfully flaky, buttery, and somehow rich and light at the same time. I'm debating whether the skate wing might steal the cassoulet's spot as my go-to. Gasp!

Explore their wine menu. I had my most favorite wine to date here, a dreamy vouvray. Somewhere I've taken a picture of exactly what I had so I can buy a stash of it. You may discover a new favorite, as well!"}
{"text":"One of my top choices on Cleveland. Never had a bad meal, or bad experience. From the food/drinks to the atmosphere, L'Albatros does everything on the high end!"}
{"text":"This was my first meal in Cleveland and I was definitely impressed!  The food and service was extraordinary.  We ordered two bottles of wine and each time someone left for the restroom, someone neatly folded their napkin.  This is totally unnecessary but this kind of service I welcome and appreciate.

We started with the grilled artichoke and braised oxtail and scallop (one of my favorite combinations!).

I ordered the Skate Wing with brown butter and parsley.  To be honest, my only experience with skate wing was on an episode of Top Chef when Chef Jacques Pepin requested it to be his \"last meal\".  I had to have it!  I had no idea of what I was getting myself into, but it was delicious! It had the texture of crab but was not as sweet.  How wrong could you go with something that had butter in the title?  

My boyfriend had the Pork Two Ways, which included braised pork ribs and pork belly.  If we weren't going to eat at Lola the next day, I would have ordered Pork Two Ways.

If I'm ever in Cleveland again, I would have to come here again, without a doubt.

P.S. It's pretty dimly lit, so bring your glasses."}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place after seeing the yelp ratings! I was in Cleveland for work and wanted to find some time to try this place at least for lunch.  However, work took longer than expected and I had no time to have a sit-down meal.  I didn't give up though, called L'Albatros and asked for duck confit to go.   I picked it up and didn't get to eat it at least one hour later at the airport, but it still tasted very good!!! :)  so I can only imagine the dish would've tasted so much better at the restaurant!!!  Will definitely try again if/when I go back to Cleveland next time!"}
{"text":"Had the mussels with pomme frites. So good. Got extra spicy aioli because it was so good! Mussels were perfectly cooked! We asked for the creme caramel to be bruleed and they were very accommodating too. Very nice environment and the staff are lovely and very helpful."}
{"text":"Good food, excellent service. A nice replacement for That Place, a staple of Bellflower for many many years.

The food was rich with sizable portions. The ambiance is classy for a college campus, but laid back compared to Table 45.

Service was impressive with delicious bread being constantly replenished on our plates and water glasses always more than 1/2 full.

While That Place will always be missed the renovations added a modern touch without trying too hard and still has the underlying feel of being hidden away from the bustle of Euclid and Mayfield."}
{"text":"I think I spent the whole time I lived in Cleveland assuming L'Albatros was a white-glove French restaurant, and while I love to eat, that is almost never my bag. But as I said, I love to eat, and I love everything L'Albatros actually is: unfussy, with warm, friendly service and expertly prepared bistro food that is unfailingly delicious. From the skate, to pasta with snap peas and beets, to white pizza with anchovies and capers and runny cheese - it. was. great. I'm so glad I finally ate there, and frankly, it's worth the drive from Pittsburgh to eat there again. Don't think I won't do it."}
{"text":"Amazing everything, i ordered the skate, with \"regular\" mashed potatos, amazing! Amazing food, realistic pricing, and fantastic service.  The pattio was lovely, the inside seemed a bit loud for my tastes.  I will say however, and to no fault of the restaurant, some little insect bit my legs several times while out on the pattio and i felt nothing, so do be careful if sitting by the bushes."}
{"text":"We have been to L'albatros at least 20 times. This place is excellent. Service is great. Very affordable. 
We have tried almost everything on the menu. Favorites include: French onion soup ( at least their version of it), goat cheese tart, pork rilletes, charcuterie board, trout with almonds, coq au vin, frozen soufflé (lemon and espresso flavours), chocolate Napoleon. 

I didn't give it 5 stars because on 3 occasions our food was over salted. We brought it up to management and we were compensated. 

Overall it's a great place!!"}
{"text":"We had a great experience here for dinner.  Service was extremely attentive and we constantly received refills of bread (by the end, it really got to be too much, as I will eat as much bread as is put in front of me).  We got the charcuterie appetizer. My husband got scallops, and I got the sausage platter with potatoes. Everything was very good although I only liked one kind of sausage of the two that I was served. If we lived in Cleveland we would definitely come here often so we could try the other dishes on the very extensive menu."}
{"text":"11401 Bellflower Ct was many things over the last 10 years before it finally turned into L'Albatros - my new favorite restaurant.

I was hooked on L'Albatros after my first wine and cheese evening hosted by Brandon Chrostowski - a passionate expert who wants nothing more than to share his love of wine and cheese.

The atmosphere is generally reposed, the decor is modern, the food and spirits are amazing! The bar stocks virtually every imaginable liquor. Their wine list is quite impressive. The services is top notch. The food is amazing!

My culinary exploits in Paris were few and left me wanting more. With L'Albatros in University Circle, I can have amazing French and French inspired delights!

Stop by for an afternoon drink, a great lunch, a fabulous dinner. You wont regret it.

Thus far, I've enjoyed a few dinners, a few lunches and a couple too many evening cocktails and dessert runs. You'll probably see me there again next week."}
{"text":"Great drinks, attentive service and always a solid menu. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Waiter and staffs were friendly and attentive.  The French onion soup is the most rich one I ever tasted - not too salty, has tender beef chunk inside.  Compliment bread and olive oil(high quality oil with a kick).  The duck confit was moist, tender and well balanced with the acidity in the red cabbage and the sauce with sweet potatoes.  As soon as the dish arrived, the bees in the patio have been circulating nonstop. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I think there were 4 or 5 waiters attending to us at some point, all of whom were personable without being intrusive.  Everyone enjoyed their entrees.  Mine was only ok.  I'm not a big fan of dark meat chicken and ordering the chicken confit was more of a mistake on my part than any fault of the kitchen.  I did enjoy the chicken pizza my grandma ordered and my parents gave high marks for their steak frites and chicken breast.  My pear and almond tart with caramel ice cream was delicious as was the warm brownie dessert.  I'd go back but seeing as how I visit regularly from NYC I'd probably try some of Bruell's other restaurants first."}
{"text":"I recommend this restaurant to EVERYONE. I especially recommend the cheese plate. The cheese options vary. You have the choice of getting just a few types of cheese or practically all of them. The cheese plate plus the bread is a meal. Add in the most wonderful selection of wine and you have yourself one of the best dinners of your life. The prices are a little on the high side. If you are on a budget I suggest keeping your visits to special occasions or eat simply with their delicious soups and salads. I have eaten many entrees from here, but I must say the skate wing is perfect. There are very few restaurants that even offer it in the northeast Ohio area. You must try it from here. It is as close to France as you are going to get. Enjoy your visit! You won't be disappointed. I have not had bad service here, but one bad waiter should not ruin the meal."}
{"text":"Had pleasant brunch at this establishment on the outdoor patio.  Overall, it was a good experience with nicely prepared French fare, attentive service staff, and nice environment.  

The back patio was very nice and I would recommend requesting a seat there if you are coming in on a nice day.    The service staff was nice enough to move around the umbrellas to maximize the shade we were getting.  Additionally, they were very accommodating when one of the guests in our party needed to be served ahead of the others.  

For drinks, I had the house recommended Cambria Chardonnay which I would highly recommend for those who enjoy a smokier Chardonnay.

For appetizers, we shared a the foie gras with chicken liver.  The dish comes with nicely prepared French bread and the spread.  A very generous quantity of the spread is provided.  The flavor was nice and earthy and had good texture, however, would have like a little more flavor in the spread.  The bread was delicious.

For the main entree, we ordered some salads, the chicken pizza, and the mussels.  The mussels stole the show - it was loaded up with a bed of French fries over it.  The mussels were very fresh,  had great flavor, and good texture - not dry and overlooked like a lot of other steamed mussels.  The sauce was a bit heavy over the French fries, nice time I will probably order it on the side.  Pizza was pretty good - very light and the chicken was very flavorful.  

Overall, a good experience.  Will be back to try out the dinner service."}
{"text":"Went here for my husband's birthday with another friend on a Sunday evening.  Made a reservation a week in advance with no issues (you can't reserve seating outside but reservation is highly encouraged).  Here's the breakdown:

Ambiance: 5 stars, if you are eating outside.  Bar next door had live music that you could hear from the restaurant patio and it was awesome.

Staff:  4 stars: friendly and knowledgable staff, a lot of people on hand to help.  Laid back.  Some staff were 5 stars but some of the help were more like a 3, and overall I get annoyed when too many different people are visiting the table.

Appetizers: 5 stars.  Must get the French toast.  I would potentially go here again just for appetizers.

Drinks: 3 stars, bad incident with a cocktail that was ordered (orange peel was dirty, hair in drink, sugar at bottom that wasn't properly mixed into drink).  Wine selection and taste was excellent though.

Dinner: 3.5 stars - ok the taste was 4.5 stars but for the insanely high price of each dish, everything should have been perfect.  Medium rare steak order was more like medium.

Dessert: 3 stars.  I love dessert, like my favorite part of a special meal, and it was just OK.  A lot of people come here to celebrate so they do the whole candle thing which is nice."}
{"text":"The food was fine. Authentic I suppose. I am perhaps spoiled having spent a large amount of time in France. I do understand the \"bistro\" style of this location. 
I will say that to be quite honest with you, very few if any of the cheeses were French. The fromagier had little idea about the cheeses and could not answer as to why they were not authentically French. This aside, I do understand that some cheeses may be difficult to get due to season, availability etc. However, the restaurant should not proclaim itself to be serving  authentic French cuisine of the blue cheese comes from Italy and there is Gouda on the menu."}
{"text":"As a lifelong Clevelander simply the best meal I have ever eaten out in Cleveland.

The service was absolutely impeccable. Not too much, not too little. The experience was unimpeachable. 

2 Appetizers. 2 Entrees. 3 glasses of wine and sparkling water for $116. Considering the quality. Very reasonable. 

Decadence began with the chicken liver and fois gras. It continued with the cassoulet of braised white beans with lamb, duck confit, pork belly, and sausages. I am never a huge fan of pork belly, but when I put this pork belly in my mouth I closed my eyes and savored each morsel."}
{"text":"Great food - high end cuisine. Very good service. Expensive, but worth it for the food. Customers pay to park."}
{"text":"I was in the city for business and was looking for a good place to eat. I was recommended to try this place from my barber. The place was pretty out of the way, so I was a bit hesitant at first since I did not have access to a GPS or my phone maps, but I decided to check it out anyway.

L'Albatros has a fantastic decor and amazing food. I ordered the duck confit and the L'Albatros (drink). Both were made very well. The duck was very smooth and would melt off the bone. Definitely one of the best duck dishes I've had in a while. The drink was also quite interesting since it combined absinthe, mint and some other ingredients. It was made quite well, and was quite smooth even though it had absinthe in it.

Overall, L'Albatros is a must try here in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Fabulous service and food!  I had all the specials featuring local produce along with  a halibut entree.   Travel a lot and appreciate a delicious meal."}
{"text":"This review is going to be short and sweet. Perfect brasserie. All the right selections perfectly done. Great atmosphere. Great decor. Spot on service. Comfortable and friendly."}
{"text":"If you're only going to have dinner at one place in Cleveland, I highly recommend that you choose L'Albatros!

When we walked into L'Albatros I immediately fell in love. As soon as we stepped in I was greeted by the intoxicating aromas from the open kitchen immediately to our right. The space is split up into smaller sections, making it the perfect setting for an intimate dinner with friends or loved ones.

Once we were settled into our cozy corner table that looked out to the patio, we got straight to business and ordered a bottle of wine and an assortment of cheeses. L'Albatros has a \"cheese guy\" (fromager? cheesemonger? we just went with \"cheese guy\") who brings out the full selection of the restaurant's cheeses to your table and cuts off your pieces right then and there. We opted for a couple funky, a couple soft, and one hard, and we were off to cheese-lovers' heaven! Served with sliced bread and a little bit of honey and fig jam, this was the perfect way to start a very memorable meal.

After the cheese came the Escargot. L'Albatros' version is made with toasted garlic and fennel butter (lots and lots of butter) and we both really enjoyed it. The addition of fennel was a twist that I've never tried before and it worked very well. Make sure you have a few extra slices of bread to sop up all of that delicious butter, it's always my favorite part!

We also ordered salads to add in a bit of lightness after our first two courses. We had the Radish & Cucumber salad and their special, mixed greens topped with heirloom tomatoes, goat cheese, and a Meyer lemon vinaigrette. These were both cool, crisp, fresh salads that hit the spot.

For our main dishes we had the Roasted Cod, a fixture on the menu, and the Amberjack, a special for the evening. The cod was served with spätzle, sauerkraut, crème fraîche, and cornichon aioli. The amberjack was served with summer squash and several other great seasonal ingredients. Both delicious dishes!

We were both happily full but just couldn't say no to dessert. We shared the dark chocolate tart with Meyer lemon curd, not too rich but just enough sweetness to satisfy; it was a great way to end an already fantastic meal."}
{"text":"Solid 4 but this night I give them a 4.5.  I'm still searching for that 5 star joint that falls in the same category / price point as L'Albatros.  Now the review.

L'Albatros has been on the short list of restaurants to visit in Cleveland since moving here in 08'.  The wife (Alison) and I decided it was time to buck up and get a sitter, date night if you will, because it has been LONG over due.  We wanted something different then ponying up to a bar or sitting in a booth sharing wings and pizza, so we pulled out the restaurant bucket list and chose L'Albatros.  I then did my due diligence and read my fellow Yelpers reviews for ideas on what to order.  Now instead of going into a long drawn out review with paragraphs of descriptions on the food and comparing to other places that do it better, I'll just be short and sweet.

Made reservations on 4 square and were seated right away in a nice table for 2 with a view of their bubbly patio.  Little cramped but expected for Saturday night.

We both ordered wine, Bordeaux for me and I think Pinot Gris for her. Mine was great so we ordered it by the bottle for dinner;  decided we didn't care about matching with our entree selections.  Bread was served with olive oil.

http://albatrosbrasserie.com/ --Menu for reference.

For starters / appetizers:
Shared: \"FRENCH TOAST\" - WOW!  Alison is not much of a mushroom person but this $8 app was delicious.  

Alison - VEGETABLE SOUP (SOTD) - She loved it, me not so much.
Jeff - FRISÉE AND BACON LARDONS WITH POACHED EGG - Great salad.  Poached egg with the large chunks of bacon went perfect with the frisee and light dressing.  

Shared: SELECTION OF THREE CHEESES - This is a must for anyone visiting.  We both decided that the time spent choosing the cheeses from our Fromagier (sp?) and the tasting itself was both educational and divine or in man terms - pretty cool. 

Dinner:
Alison - ROASTED TROUT WITH ALMOND CRUST - For some reason we've both been on this rainbow trout kick which made it really hard to pass up.  Very happy Alison went with this dish.  Perfectly cooked and the fish didn't get drowned out by all the additions to the dish.  
Jeff - HANGER STEAK AND FRITES - This seemed to be the most popular dish with decent marks on Yelp so I went with the safe route.  The steak was cooked as ordered and the cut was exceptional.  I was waiting for that one bite where I chomp down on fat but that never happened.  The béarnaise sauce went well, not overpowering, just a nice compliment to the steak and frites (also wonderful for 'French' fries).

Dessert:
Shared - I called ahead of time and asked if it would be OK if we brought a bottle of dessert wine that we have been saving since our 1st Anniversary, no prob!  I think he actually told me to bring as much wine as I wanted, no corking fee charged, very cool for them to let us do that.  Perfect ending of a close to perfect evening.

Top notch service from top to bottom.  We will return.  Patio, wine, and 5 cheese sampler, that's worth a trip in itself.  Thanks L'Albatros for a wonderful night.  A well deserved honor to be the 300th review from this Yelper."}
{"text":"L'Albatros is my go-to restaurant for meetings, dates, meeting with friends etc. It is nearly always open, often when other places aren't, has consistent service/dishes (this is huge for me) and although it's French I feel there's something for everyone on the menu. It's decadent food to be sure but you can make it healthy if you opt for a salad. Price wise you can spend a lot or a reasonable amount. I'm never disappointed. Also a surprisingly nice place to work if you sit at the bar."}
{"text":"Love this place. Everything was spot on from the service to the food. The atmosphere was warm and cozy (also, it helped that the party I was with were sitting next to a fireplace on a cold blizzard night). The waiters there were really attentive and the bread and water kept on coming and coming. I had the a three course meal starting with the smoked salmon plate which was delicious, followed by the hanger steak with frites, and ending with the chocolate napoleon. The hanger steak was really flavorful and I found myself enjoying it, savoring every last bite. The chocolate napoleon was also great but I couldn't handle the mass amounts of chocolate mousse that was on that dish but the berries placed in the plate tasted really fresh. The other party members had the soup du jour (soup of the day) followed by both the chicken breast plate and the pasta du jour and both were really highly recommended by them.

Overall, I would recommend the place for anyone craving french flavored cuisine or a romantic night. The drinks here are pretty strong and I would also recommend getting the cheese plate."}
{"text":"Among the top 3 restaurants in Cleveland. Never disappoints. I get the salmon dish pretty much every time. It's amazing."}
{"text":"I took my husband here for a special occasion and the entire experience was wonderful. The food came as expected and was thoroughly enjoyable, the warm brownie dessert was gone in a flash, and the service was impeccable. Truly a gem in Cleveland since many other fine dining establishments fall short in service. Even though the small dining area became full over the course of our meal it was never too loud that we had to raise our voices to speak to one another. Our server was very nice and friendly. I really enjoyed the attention he provided from wiping off the table to get crumbs and tidbits before dessert to asking if he could clear my plate before taking it. The service was comparable to fine dining in Chicago. Very nice to finally see in Cleveland! 

Some of the other diners showed up in completely unacceptable attire. Zip up hoodies, sweatpants, tennis shoes; one woman had the audacity to arrive in a bright pink Gap pull over sweatshirt with the large Gap insignia on the chest. You know what I'm talking about. The restaurant's offerings and service deserve respect and I personally think that they should enforce a strict dress code. It adds to the ambiance and atmosphere to require a collared shirts and no jeans. For anyone reading this review.. please do us all a favor and dress yourself appropriately for the price point. No one wants to enjoy a romantic/quiet, nice dinner with you in your sweaty workout clothes at the next table. 

I will happily return and will tell others!"}
{"text":"This may be a more mixed review than a two star, but a couple of negatives added a definite cloud to our experience.

There were a few of us visiting from the west coast and other US cities for my sister's birthday, and this was her dinner choice for the first night, a Wednesday.  The restaurant was busy, but not jammed.

Following a very lengthy wait for drink orders:

We waited over an hour an thirty minutes for our entrees.  My sister has to hunt down the waiter to ask after an hour and ten minutes.  Vague excuse.

Second, disappointing result for a fish entree with which my sister was familiar.  Other food was good;  my cassoulet was very different than others that I have had, and quite tasty.

Third, over all service was not very good.  Sweetly friendly waiter with a story about his tie, but I prefer professional.  Not often attending.  The bread server had to be asked, and was somewhat surly.  Water service was inattentive.

Fourth, the boxed item to take home disappeared.  They did offer to cook another one, but it was too late by then.  

Following all this, we asked that the manager call my sister/host.  Three days on, no call.

There was no offer to adjust the bill or make it right.

So, hesitating to go back;  my sister will not take another larger party, for sure.  She was disappointed.  So, watch your step if or when you visit."}
{"text":"Hidden gem in the midst of a college campus. The cheese and charcuterie is my favorite dish. Their main courses are typically heavy but delicious. The bartenders know how to pour, so be careful. A great meal that is worth the price tag."}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite restaurant in Cleveland. If it weren't hard on my wallet I'd be here weekly. 
Apps: charcuterie platter, salmon platter, pork rilletes. Even if I'm not coming for dinner I love sitting in the bar for drinks and apps. 
Multiple good entrees but my favorite is the scallop pasta. 
Service is always great. No snooty waiters who judge your lack of French and help explain the menu. 
The cocktails rotate and are well made. 

In the summer def sit on the patio!!"}
{"text":"Not sure if I hit it just right, or if this place is always as good as it was tonight, but I really enjoyed the meal and the overall experience.  I savored the corn  soup served cold with truffle oil.  Creamy!  Delicious!.  I had the Cassoulet for an entree- braised white beans with lamb, duck confit and sausages.  Wow.  Unique taste with very hearty, very memorable.  Lots of flavor.  My co-worker shared a bit of the Pied de Cochon  topped with Bernaise sauce accompanied by green beans.  First time for me with this dish, but equally unique and it hit many parts of the pallet.  I paired these dishes with a nice glass of wine from Rhone Valley.  They had excellent selection to choose from - both by the glass and by the bottle.  In a larger group, I might have venture to the Chateauneuf de Pape - one of my favorites.  Kind of spendy, though.  

For desert - they just added a white chocolate cheese cake with Raspberries to the menu.  Spectacular way to top off a great meal.  

I would easily go back, as they had a number of other tempting dishes to try.  

We dined outside on a lovely patio area (uncharacteristically cool and low humidity for Cleveland - made the evening that much more memorable.  

Wait staff was just the right level of attentiveness."}
{"text":"Food was outstanding.  Took my wife and daughter here while visiting our daughter at Oberlin college. Wait staff was friendly attentive and knowledgeable.  They picked up on my wife and daughters glutton allergy immediately and brought them glutton free bread. Setting was intimate and cozy.  Tender hanger steak with béarnaise.  They also have the mother of all cheese boards.  Ended w three of us ordering deserts and kona coffee. Left a good feeling w us days later."}
{"text":"Excellent service, glasses were always topped with tap water, waiters offered fresh baked bread constantly. I had a mouth-watering root vegetable cassoulet. Very fresh vegetables -- carrots, potatoes, mushrooms, with generous helpings of cheese. Presentation was very nice in a ceramic (?) bowl. The price is decent. Lovely ambience."}
{"text":"Plus one and I went to L'Albatros before going to see a play at MOCA. I have never been there before, Plus One had lunch there once. We got to L'Albatros at 6pm without reservations, we were seated right away at a booth in the bar area. Happy hour ends 6:30pm, on the happy hour menu there was five drinks and 6 food items. We shared an entree, Mussels with Pomme Frites. Delicious!! The staff was friendly enough. Constantly getting refills on water and bread. I would go back again, hopefully get dessert next time."}
{"text":"5 Stars! This little French gem in Cleveland is a must go for all foodies!!

Here's why:

1) Fresh warm bread served immediately 
2) Attentive servers
3) The Food!
4) Location

Highly Recommend: Duck Confit, Seared Sea Scallops, Goat Cheese Tart, Arugula Salad and Oysters!

Only con is very small tables which is hard to have a conversation with your date but who needs talk when you're having your own relationship with your food ;)"}
{"text":"We went here last weekend to celebrate our anniversary! From the moment we stepped inside and saw the small open kitchen, I knew it would be a good experience. 

I wish I knew our servers name because she was really awesome and also down to earth. She told us that escargot tastes \"very earthy, a lot like dirt. In the best way possible!\" I thought that was hilarious so we had to try it! The escargot was really good and earthy! But the star here was the fennel butter broth that escargot was bathing in. Seriously, I would've slurped it if we weren't in this fancy restaurant, instead we just dipped our bread in it... you should do!

For entrees I had the duck confit and my boyfriend had some kind of beef stew. His meal was good but he was disappointed because he feels like he didn't order right with so many other good things on the menu! On the other hand, we were both blown away by the duck confit. It was crispy duck, sweet potato purée, and red cabbage in a large dish. This might sound like an odd combination but it was perfect! Probably one of the top 5 entrees I have ever had! 

We needed the meal with the brownie and ice cream dessert. Order it, perfect meal capper. 

My only problem was how close the tables were together, you could literally hear everyone's conversation next to you. So that kind of killed the romantic vibe, but nonetheless I would come here again to celebrate a special occasion."}
{"text":"Hopped in here for happy hour and had a great experience.
Bar staff was super friendly and I went with :

L'albatros Burger $10 
Chicken Wings  Confit $8

Both items were very good , flavorful and great value . 


I would definitely return if I was in the area."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The service is great, the food is delicious. We couldn't stop eating. The whole atmosphere and the location was great. I will definitely visit them again if I am around that area."}
{"text":"Think provincial French meets upscale presentation.  This is my go to place for lunch when I have business at the university.  They usually have a vegetarian option and  the decor is really nice for business lunches. On a soggy cold and rainy day, we arrived right when they opened.  We were seated by the fireplace to warm up.  I started with their celery soup with shaved parmesan.  My main was their pasta of the day  which was vegetarian Alfredo with beets, asparagus and ramps.  The Alfredo was not super creamy but more on a lighter broth side which was fine by me.  We closed the meal with cappuccino and the almond cake, which paired nicely with each other.

{"text":"I love this place. It's been 3 years (I don't live in Cleveland), just went back, and yes. Still the best French onion soup I've ever had. The roast cod is superb also. I've never had a not-excellent meal here. The people are nice. Service is excellent. Love."}
{"text":"Here for an anniversary dinner - we used to dine here 30 years ago when it was called That Place on Bellflower.  It's still a really quaint place, though the menu has changed a lot.  What knocked us out was the service - very very attentive, they were constantly coming by with more bread, water, refilling wine glasses, and good timing on getting the meal to us.  For food, I would give it a 4.5 out of 5, very good, but a touch short of fantastic.  The Escargot were wonderful, the garlic butter sauce is to die for - just to dip your bread in.  The house special salad, with beets, pistachios, greens and a light vinaigrette was very tasty and unique.  I had the daily (Friday) special, walleye with lobster sauce, green beans, and dumplings.  Very delicate, small pieces of fish, but enough to satisfy, and tasty, so no complaint.  My wife had the duck confit with sweet potato puree and sweet cabbage - duck seemed pretty ordinary, though the other stuff was really good.  They had a French Sancerre wine, don't see that too often in restaurants, it's a nice dry white wine, we got it because we had it in France a couple years ago, and it was great.  Overall a wonderful meal."}
{"text":"Had the roast duck with sweet potatoes. Had that + coffee for $20.52 at lunch. Highly recommend this restaurant! High scale French eatery for a surprisingly fair price(at least during lunch). The mussels seem to be popular as well."}
{"text":"This place is up there as one of my favorite restaurants in Cleveland. I went during Cleveland Restaurant Week and was blown away. I loved the upscale intimate atmosphere. The food and presentation was phenomenal. The servers were very attentive and polite. I had an amazing experience and look forward to going again."}
{"text":"Wow I can't believe I've never been here before. This is one of the best restaurants I've ever been to! The service was amazing and the food was A+. The prices are also reasonable. If you like Martini's the blue cheese olives are awesome, they were so good I ordered a little plate of them. 

Bottom line is go here, you won't be disappointed. Can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"i am surprised by some of the low ratings. i have been to l'albatros twice - once several months ago and then again last night for my birthday dinner. both visits were outstanding!

we started with oysters, the goat cheese tart and the 'french toast' appetizers. all were delicious.

i had the trout and lobster quenelle with green beans and a tomato confit sauce. it was very, very, very good. i even dipped my bread in the remaining sauce - i couldn't help myself! we all tasted each others dishes - the cod, pork two ways, veal and lamb and everything was delicious. 

for dessert we went with the cheese plate and all 5 we sampled were excellent. i love this place and i recommend it highly. it is reasonably priced as well. my dish was only $20 and it was incredible."}
{"text":"L'Albatros is a great space with a wonderful menu.
We three enjoyed our food, my grilled sausage not so much. 
The reason for the two rating is that the room we were seated in was freezing.  I mentioned this to the server.  She said it was taken care of.  It was not.  I the went to the greeter and she said the manager would fix it.  He did not.
I do not want to have dinner and be shivering the whole meal.  It was so uncomfortable we left as quickly as we could.
Dining out is more than the food and the space. Customer comfort is also important.
Why would everyone tell me the temp. would  be corrected and the do nothing?"}
{"text":"I took the boyfriend here for a birthday dinner, and it was fabulous! The decor had a more modern feel and was lovely, and they had our table ready the moment we got there (we had a reservation). We tried the pork rilletes as an appetizer, and it was interesting but delicious. I had the braised lamb shoulder, which was tender and full of flavor. The waiter suggested a perfect red wine for my meal, and it made everything come together that much more. Boyfriend had the casulette, which he loved (as did I, because of course we have to sample each other's meals). Dessert I had the almond cake (amazing!) and boyfriend had the Napoleon (also great). We also had French press Jamaican coffee, and that ended the meal just right. 

The only reason this isn't a 5 star rating is because our waiter was pretty busy with us, 2 other tables, and a large party in the back. He was a bit slow to attend to us at times (which we totally understood and weren't upset about). However, when my boyfriend had finished both his soda and water and wanted a refill (after waiting for a good amount of time with no sight of our waiter) he flagged down another waiter and asked for a refill. This waiter simply said that our waiter would get it for him, and walked away. We were a bit surprised that for such an upscale restaurant, the staff wouldn't be willing to help each other out to make sure all patrons were taking care of.

Still, this was a lovely dinner and great experience. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Almost like you're in NY...definitely get the cheese plate. They have the widest selection in CLE and also do an excellent job of describing everything. Also, get the french toast! It sounded weird but upon recommendation, it blew my mind. Of course, it's not really regular french toast but the cream sauce with mushrooms makes it mindblowing."}
{"text":"L'Albatros is nothing short of a religious experience. I would give serious thought to becoming a nun if this was the church I would be serving.

Just came back from a long luxurious lunch and lets just say that after that, I won't be able to get anything done today. I'm too busy writhing around in my own food ecstasy. Every time I come to L'Albatros, I am not only blown away by the exquisite food, but also but the amazing service. You can go to Greenhouse or any of the other puffed up restaurants in Cleveland, pay more for your food, and not get the same amazing experience. My husband and I went for our anniversary last month and he ordered an absinthe. The server was well versed in the absinthes they carry and the effect they have and he didn't just get a drink in a glass, he got a whole song and dance. I was so impressed by the extent they go to showcase their amazing fare. All of the servers take such pride in their job and what they carry that it is nearly impossible not to get excited about it.

My recommendations:

The Cassoulet: I literally could not finish the story I was telling after I took my first bite

The Hanger Steak: Cooked to perfection and bathed in bernaise sauce

The Frisee salad with poached egg and lardons: BEST salad I've ever eaten.

Any of the cheese selections: One of the top cheese plates in the country (its not just me who says that! Important people do too!) and they have such a passion for cheese that once they found out I loved it too, they took me and my friend through the kitchen and into the freezer to sample an extremely rare Roquefort just to be able to share the experience. I will never forget that.

The Lavender Lady: My favorite drink in the world.

If you have rated L'Albatros with anything less than 5 stars, I strongly encourage you to try it again!"}
{"text":"My favorite item is the GRILLED TIGER SHRIMP with brussel sprouts, noodles and pernod cream. This is my favorite lunch. It is a little pricy for lunch at $16, but it is also worth it. Their bread, oil and spice/salt mixture for dipping are great too."}
{"text":"Our epicurean adventure began with finding this building with so much character and history. Ask the well-informed waitress,Tesa, for some history of the building or suggestions about the menu. Tesa guided us through descriptions on a fantastic menu. We only wish we could have sampled more dishes. 
We started with a special salad with zucchini, cucumber, tomatoes, arugula and a squash blossom stuffed with goat cheese - truly an amazing salad! Then a most interesting combination of mussels with pomme frites - very good and we were told by Tesa that this was very popular here. Lastly we had a scrumptious roasted trout with almond crust - perfectly done! A wonderful evening!"}
{"text":"We (I) came here for the giant capers that come with the pate/foie gras, and it was well worth it. I never knew capers grew to such a size, like they cannibalized other, lesser capers to form a new breed of super-caper. Capers aside, the food was good, not great - all well-prepared, but a little too forced at times, as if bonus points were given for the inclusion of as many on-trend ingredients in one dish as possible. 

The almost militant service, on the other hand, is above reproach. Should you ever feel unappreciated and unnoticed in your life, make your way post-haste to L'Albatros, order yourself something that comes with giant capers, and wait for the bread boys to swarm."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere, good service, good food. I got the braised lamb shoulder, which was very good. Their charcuterie plate was also tasty. We went with a large group, 12-14ish people."}
{"text":"Excellent service with absolutely professional and friendly staff who managed to introduce special dishes of the day and give recommendations artfully. I'd highly recommend the Cassoulet and Foie Gras. The best thing about this place arguably would be their sun-filled patio, which would be perfect for a dinner in the summer."}
{"text":"The outside reminds me of a restaurant you would see in Europe. Entrees are huge! My boyfriend got the cassoulet and I had the trout. Good wine & appetizers. Definitely a great date night place!"}
{"text":"The wife and I celebrated our 13th wedding anniversary at L'Albatros recently.  We had never been to L'Albatros and I've been wanting to try a French restaurant, since I've never been to one in Cleveland.  We made a reservation and off we went.

Upon arrival, we were seated indoors in the back of the restaurant in a dark area with candle light.  It was romantic!  My wife started off with a glass of champagne and I had a glass of red wine, although I do not remember which brand.  I believe it was a Shiraz wine.  Soon, bread arrived that was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  It took us a while to pour over the menu as French cuisine is new to us.  We had a couple questions for the waiter about what things were.  My wife ordered the mussels with pomme fritze dinner as an appetizer for us.  They turned out to be the best dish of the night!  Five stars for sure.  They were really delicious and unlike any other fries I've eaten.  The sauce in the bottom of the bowl was so good that I actually ate a lone spoonful of it.  

My wife also ordered the french onion soup, which I tried.  It had beef in it and a lot of cheese.  It was pretty tasty, but nothing like french onion soup I've had elsewhere.

For dinner, my wife ordered the lamb shoulder and I let the waiter pick a dish for me.  He asked if I liked fatty meat or lean meat.  Upon telling him lean, I was later served the pork two ways dish.  
Her lamb was very tasty, but the risotto was very large and lacked a lot of flavor.  The pork two ways was good and it had some battered and deep fried cauliflower.  The brazed pork was excellent!  Did I mention this dish had cauliflower?  I had approximately seven large pieces of deep fried cauliflower.  So if I was inclined to do so, I would rename this dish to, \"deep fried cauliflower with a side of two kinds of pork.\"  It was mostly cauliflower, which was good, but WAY too much was served.  I still gave the overall flavor and presentation of my dish four out of five stars.  I could not finish all the cauliflower.  Was I supposed to?

We ordered a chocolate mousse with fresh raspberries dessert, which we shared.  It was good, but not amazing, as I had hoped.  

I am looking forward to visiting again to try some other menu items like seafood.  The price was very reasonable.  We had three entrees, four drinks, and dessert, and our bill was still under $150 with tip included.  

The service was excellent!

Recommend!"}
{"text":"Since moving to the East side this indeed is one of my favorites! What's not to love? We enjoy sitting at the bar booths the atmosphere is always nice and softly romantic in a great way. The cocktails Rick prepares are always on point, fabulous martinis. Furthermore Rick is informative and always so gracious very attentive with a great knowledge of the menu always having great suggestions. Should I mention \"The Food\" and presentation are absolutely amazing!! Zack we love all your Restaurants but this is our favorite!!"}
{"text":"I love L'Albatros. One of my favorite places in Cleveland.

I took a bite of the mushroom french toast and I was in heaven. Very yummy. Good bread with lots of mushrooms on top. 
I also loved the trout. The fish had lots of flavor and was light, not greasy.

I must comment on the service. They are absolutely amazing. They provide a nice crusty bread while you're waiting and they never let you have fewer than 2 slices on your bread plate. If you're on a diet, beware because you may be filling yourself up with the bread.

Are you a glass half-full kind of person? Then this place is for you. They never let your water glass get below half-full, which I love. 

I came to L'Albatros with a group of friends for a birthday. We forgot to bring candles and a lighter for the cake, but L'Albatros came to the rescue. In addition to providing candles and a lighter, the staff was amazing in cutting the cake without charging a cake-cutting fee.

As an aside, I've gotten the same dish for lunch and dinner. While lunch is a bit cheaper, the portions are the same side. Go for lunch if you're on a budget."}
{"text":"After 2 delayed flights and finally arriving in Cleveland after a 13hr commute from NY, the hotel concierge recommended L'Albatros for a late night dinner which was still an option at 10:30pm. Everyone from the front of the house to the kitchen were impeccable. Escargot was buttery, comforting, and sultry. The duck confit was amazing, it was nice to see a properly Frenched piece of poultry. If memory serves me right, it was oh so moist, delicate, and rich - possibly the best I've had. I completely forgot about my day, walked back to the hotel with a full stomach, and slept like a baby."}
{"text":"I was looking for someplace new to eat when visiting Cleveland and this was it!

It's great French-style dining with a pretty reasonable prices. Decent selection, well-prepared with a very encouraging list of wines and beers. I know, I should have been selecting a wine with dinner here but they had Chimay Blue available and I couldn't pass it up. 

The lighting and decor is a bit... \"intimate\" which made my co-worker question my intentions when I took him here after a job (ha!). Nonetheless, I will certainly be back."}
{"text":"One of the best (and my favorite) restaurants in CLE. It's hard to find an entire menu where everything is delicious, and L'Albatros just does it right. The ambiance, the cozy feel of being inside a \"house\" sets this apart from other restaurants in the area

But be honest, a restaurant of this caliber still has work to do with their serving staff... Once I came here for early dinner with my sister on a weekday night, the restaurant was almost empty, and I requested to sit in a corner table and the waitress made a huge stink about it. Then she took forever taking our orders, following up with us, etc.  I felt she didn't know the order or timing of when to bring out food or refill drinks, etc. That was a little annoying.

I recommend: 1) going here for Valentine's day - I made reservations a month out.  Their Vday menu is pretty amazing and reasonably priced ($75 for 2 appetizers, 2 entrees and dessert); you just have to be prepared for sitting pretty close to other couples as they tend to cram more people in a room 2) Dine at lunch! Menu prices are slightly cheaper and it's not as busy 3) If you're a burger connoiseur - TRY THE BURGER! I don't usually like a busy burger (swiss cheese and carmelized onions) and this one was TDF (to die for). 

ENJOY!!"}
{"text":"From what I can tell from everyone else's reviews I'm one of the only people not in aw of this place. 
It is nice, really really nice and has the low lighting for ambiance. The type of place where everyone is dressed very nicely.
With that being said our table was so close to the one next to ours I minus well have been on the person next to me's lap. Any conversation between my table and the next could of all been had together. I get it, it's popular but all that romance for what when you have no privacy. Food taste wise, not overly memorable especially for the price. For a date or special occasion I would recommend somewhere with a little more privacy and more memorable food."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.

Out of Zack Bruell's restaurants that I've tried (Table 45, Chinato), this is the better of the 3. At least it wasn't too salty and at least it was flavorful?

We were seated right away. It's a nice artsy type of restaurant- the lights were dimmed and the restaurant seemed pretty spacious.

I got the \"Pork Two Ways.\" My friend claimed that the chicken confit was to die for. It seemed good? Let's just say one thing- the portions are HUGE. Yes, HUGE. I have no idea how people actually finish their dishes. 

I did enjoy that they came out on stone pots/plates. I do enjoy food which is cooked in stone pots. My pork in two ways was, yes, gigantic- the pork \"shank\" per se, was alright- tender, flavorful, soft. The pork belly... just seemed overcooked. I'm not sure- I just didnt' really enjoy it. My friends, however, loved their foods.

This place didn't really meet my expectations. Food was alright- but for a place so hyped out, it was okay. I kind of wish the tables just weren't so close to each other though. The waitress brought over a plate of cheeses for another table next to us...and man, it reeked!

Next time, I'll try something different. All I know is that no pork dish for me next time...."}
{"text":"Came here last night for my bday dinner. Omg. Spectacular. I have not had this great of a time and food since the 1st time at Chinato's. SO SO SO yummy. Mouth-exploding goodness. 

Service was excellent, although again, tables are small and can barely fit the food. Aside from that, the hostess, waiter, and other random waiters came by to wish me happy birthday. 

Tip: bring your own wine! No corkage fees either. 

Restaurant has their own parking lot, takes cash only. $3 for weekend nights. 

Food:
Appetizer: 
3 cheese plate - the cheese person was very very knowledgeable about the cheese, and recommended 1 soft, 1 medium-soft, and 1 sharp/hard cheese. Delicious. He also gave us two scoops of fig preserve, which was so scrumptious. Even my bf who doesn't like figs enjoyed this. This is very very filling.

Mushroom french toast - I love the balsamic vinegar taste that adds some kick to the mushroom and soft french toast. Exploding with flavor.

Entrees:
Bf ordered the duck confit as he did the other two times we went to L'albatros. The duck was very tender, and the portion was huge, bigger than I remembered.

I ordered the pork two ways. A little over salty, but still very very enjoyable. Both the pork shank and the pork belly melt in your mouth. The pickled onions on the side complimented the fattiness of the pork, and also refreshes your palate. The best part was the fried cauliflower. I would come back just for the cauliflower. You would never imagine that cauliflower would be so flavorful.

Dessert/Drinks:
Effen berry cocktail - minty with chunks of strawberries. 
Creme caramel - came with a candle! Tastes like a mix between flan and creme bruele. Not too sweet, and the caramel sauce compliments the cream on top very well.

TLDR, LOVE this place. May be my newest happy spot in Cleveland."}
{"text":"This place is very unique. The restaurant is actually a remodeled first floor of a house. There is also patio outside, which is great in summer. As I walked into the restaurant, I smelled the reason of living..

I ordered escargot and duck confit and my boyfriend ordered chicken liver and veal. I would say their food was a little on the salty side - especially the escargot and the cabbage in the duck dish i ordered. They were also very generous in the portion, especially the chicken liver. It was so much that we were afraid that we were going to get vitamin A intoxication! LOL Overall, it was a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"L'albatros is clearly one of the top restaurants in the city.  Amazing food that never disappoints.  They have a great happy hour if you can get into the bar area, and don't leave without trying the mushroom french toast appetizer and the cheese cart.  And al fresco dining doesn't get much better than this!"}
{"text":"I dined here for lunch for the first time yesterday with a friend. We sat at the bar and were promptly greeted by the bartender (I wish I remembered his name, because he was excellent!). I ordered the chicken breast ($14.00) and my friend ordered the Croque Monsieur ($10.00) Both dishes were amazing! The chicken was perfectly cooked, and the carmelized fennel and potato mousseline meshed perfectly. The goat cheese under the mousseline was a perfect compliment. The ham and cheese sandwich  was massive, and the benchmark sauce was delicious. I order the stone and apple cocktail, which is a great fall drink if you like apple cider! Not too sweet, not too strong. Great service, amazing food, and we were in and out at lunch time in under an hour. Can't wait to go back soon!"}
{"text":"Our family was in Cleveland for my husbands heart surgery.  We wanted to be together and enjoy fine dining in Cleveland just like we do in New Oeleans.  
Our party of 7 was very happy with our great table a corner with sofa seating.   
My grandson said the specify made fettuccini was Really Good!! He is a fettuccini expert. 
I selected the soup, salad and appetizer specials. Love when I don't have to ponder a menu. So happy to be able to enjoy the family meal. 
The most impressive thing of the restaurant was that we forgot a spiderman case filled with favorite toys. I received a call in the morning to say they had it and we could pick it up any time. Funny thing is that we all thought we had left it in the lobby of the Intercontinental. 
Good thing we had a limo service...did I say the wine list was awesome!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely perfect!

Came on a Friday night and the only time I could get was 6:00 for a table for one/two. It was empty when I got there but quickly filled up.

Started with a cool cucumber drink while purusing the wine and dinner menus. My server, who again I forgot her name, was charming, bubbly, perfectly described the specials and answered all questions without hesitation. 

After the drink I decided on a nice glass of St Emilion to go with dinner. It was delicious, it's very hard to find good wine served by the glass, and this was it. I found the bread boy to be amusing, his only job is to put two slices of bread on everyones plate all night, that has to be the lowest stress job in the world!

So I started with the pate, made with veal (which I usually dont eat but hey I'm at l'albatros) and pork with whole pistachios and a lovely gelatinous coating, served with toast points , cornichons and pickled vegis. Simply delicious. 

I was looking forward to the cassoulet all week as I've made it at home but it literally takes all day and makes way too much for one person, thus the perfect opportunity to try some here. It was worth the wait! A leg of duck confit, a block of crispy pork belly,  shredded lamb and two kinds of housemade sausage served with slow cooked white beans and a tomato based sauce. OMG, this was to die for! So delicious, Of course I could only eat a few bites of the delicious richness but it was so worth it. 

I debated on dessert but passed and enjoyed another glass of wine while lingering. Never did I feel rushed and never did I feel odd eating alone, in fact they were quite charming about it and went out of their way to make me feel welcome. Every server who walked by stopped to talk to me even if it was just for chit chat.

Total bill was around $94 plus tip. Well worth it , I really cant say enough for this place. Oh and when I asked the hostess to call for a cab a limo showed up! Bonus!!"}
{"text":"Usually one of my favorite restaurants, last nights experience was disappointing. The pasta that the scallop dish was served with was either seriously undercooked or overcooked. None of us could tell. But it was sticky and rubbery and did not hold the sauce well. 
Everything else was as wonderful as ever. The restaurant is beautiful and the staff attentive and informative. I did not complain about the pasta - if I had I know the restaurant would have made amends. But sometimes it does not feel good to be The quality alert!"}
{"text":"Not a full review, as my wife and I have yet to have a full meal, but as a birthday gift, my wife sought out Brandon Chrostowski. We had recently spent 2 weeks drinking wine and eating cheese during our honeymoon in New Zealand and we came back avid cheese lovers. Brandon was hand picked to run L'Albatros for his extensive experience as a fromagier and moved from NYC last year. 

There is really no cheese plate in Cleveland that compares. He gave us a private instructional cheese tasting that spanned nearly 20 cheeses and 6 wines. Who knew my wife loves \"bloomy\" cheeses and I was partial to the mountain cheese. As we enjoyed each cheese offerings we were given the back-story including where it comes from, how it is made, and which wines to pair. 

Welcome Brandon to Cleveland and check out this unique Cleveland experience!"}
{"text":"While in Cleveland for a night, we dined at L'Albatros for dinner at the recommendation of a friend. It absolutely did not disappoint! The food, atmosphere, and service were all excellent. 

We began our meal with two signature cocktails, which did not disappoint. I had the onion soup to start and found it to be extremely hearty and flavorful. I was, however, slightly surprised to find meat within the soup. I enjoyed its presence, but I was surprised that neither the menu or waiter mentioned this fact as it would be an unwelcome surprise to anyone assuming the soup was vegetarian as it normally is. My dining companion ordered the radish and cucumber salad, which was more unique but equally delicious. The crème fraîche dressing was amazing! For our main courses, we both had the mussels pomme frites. The mussels and sauce had tremendous flavor while the fries were perfectly prepared. The spicy aioli on top was a huge hit, and I will be trying my hand at making this at home! Unfortunately, we did not save room for dessert but the menu looked fabulous.

Although busy, even for a Monday early dinner, the restaurant was not overly loud and was a comfortable place to sit. Everyone was well-dressed but not particularly fancy. Our waiter was very attentive and thoroughly answered all of the questions we had about the menu.

I would recommend this restaurant for any occasion, whether formal or not! We look forward to our next trip to Cleveland in order to return and explore more of the menu."}
{"text":"L'Albatros was stellar to say the least.

Their staff of waiters and waitresses are stellar. The service and food I felt I received was nothing like what we paid. Back in LA or even in Portland, I would have expected a tab closer to $30-40 per person, but here it was definitely less with each entree priced at 20$ or less.

First things first. Family was in town and we were looking for some good food. We wanted to get brunch. Let me say that this isn't really a brunch spot, but it's definitely delicious.

We were all starving, so we each downed 4-5 slices of their bread dipped in olive oil. The bread was perfectly snappy on the outside and soft on the inside. The olive oil was beautifully fragrant. Overall, it was a good start. The waiters and waitresses were really on top of restocking our bread and water, having to do so 3-4 times. They only stopped when we had really had enough. In short, this was the first time I've ever had to say no to free bread.

It doesn't end there though. We ordered a number of dishes between the five of us. We had duck confit, choucroute garni, cassoulet, special of the day (braised pork belly over mushroom risotto), and the braised shoulder of lamb. The waitress was extra special when my dairy-allergy brother asked for the special without cheese, she made sure everything we were possibly sharing was cheeseless (or at least warned us that it had cheese). In addition to those entrees, we also got two frisee pork belly salads to split. 

Food came out in a timely manner and man we were so happy. The salad was amazing. I've never had frisee salad, but it worked perfectly with the perfect amount of dressing (I hate it when restaurants douse the salad in dressing, but L'albatros really let the flavors shine). The bacon bits were great and crunchy and that pork belly was cooked perfectly. It was juicy and delicious.

Already almost full, we moved on to our entrees. We like to share as a family so I got to try a little bit of everything (although the cassoulet is awesome because it has a little bit of everything).

I won't go too into detail, but let me tell you this: you can't go wrong with anything you order. Everything we had today was amazing and truly thoughtfully made. The dishes were well balanced and extremely tasty! If you're looking to try a little bit of everything, though, I would definitely go with the cassoulet (this is what I ordered). Unless you don't like beans (there were plenty of white beans that were crisper than I was expecting, but surprisingly refreshing.

Wish we had space for dessert, but we'll get it next time!"}
{"text":"Service was poor, waitress was no where to be found. The tables are crowded. I could not have a conversation with my date because the people sitting next to me were so close & loud. I was getting bumped into all night. The food is good but the high end dining experience is not there."}
{"text":"This place always gets it right!  The patio is beautiful, the service attentive, and the food is amazing! My favorite dish is the roasted cod. It is one of the best dishes I have ever had!"}
{"text":"Would be five stars if it wasn't for the service which definitely didn't represent a 5 star restaurant. 

I will say that the food here is really really amazing. I came with a large group and we had a prefix menu. To start we had a salad and chicken liver pate which was mouth watering. For my entree, I had the duck confit which I just couldn't get enough of. For dessert, the warm chocolate cake served with ice cream. 

Everything about L'Albatros is superb: 

- ambiance 
- food
- outdoor patio ( in spring/ summer)

If you haven't been here before, I highly recommend you do go. It is a must in Cleveland and I would even go so far as to say it stands out amongst many restaurants that I have been to in New York and globally. 

As far as our server, maybe she was having an off night.....it happens."}
{"text":"French. Classy. High end. Is the food any good? The short answer is yes, the food is outstanding. I could go on for 2 paragraphs just talking about how great the food is. I strongly encourage you to taste for yourself. 

So why just 4 stars? It's because of the building. This is a very strange labyrinth like restaurant. There are very narrow walk ways, strangely uneven brick floors, low ceilings and closed off spaces. We were a party of 8 so we sat at a big table, but to get to that table we had to make 3 right turns from the hostess podium to be seated at a table surrounded by three walls. 

About 30 minutes into service I had to step outside to get some fresh air because of the claustrophobic stuffiness of that room. Two things that almost never happen to me. Maybe it was just me though. Check it out for yourself."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Cleveland. Love the roasted trout - perfectly cooked, the tomato confit and green beans are yummy. I also really like the goat cheese tart as an appetizer to share. It's a small slice, but very flavorful.  And because portions aren't ridiculously huge, I usually try a dessert- the chocolate napoleon for is delicious! You really should be able to find something here, menu has a lot of different options. Great selection of wine as well. 

Service is always friendly, knowledgeable. Love the interior, it's modern,yet still manages to feel cozy."}
{"text":"Fantastic dining experience in Cleveland. Great location on Case Western campus. Really pretty. We had dinner on the patio out back since the weather was gorgeous. 

Love that you walk right into the open kitchen. Great decor and design. Loved it!

We started with the cheese course. You must start with the cheese course. We did 5 cheeses and really enjoyed them all. The hard cheeses were our faves.

I had the Duck Confit. Its a French restaurant after all. The duck was crispy and delicious but even better was the sweet potato souffle. That sweet potato side was crazy good. The sweetness of the sweet potato was very subtle. Loved it! My friends had the steak and enjoyed it as well.

it's so refreshing to have great staff. I live in Miami where you pay a premium for attitude. There is nothing nicer than being welcomed into a restaurant by truly nice and attentive people."}
{"text":"L'Albatros is a solid dining choice if you are in the mood for French inspired cuisine and in the Cleveland area.  We would have loved to experience the lovely terrace area dining, but 100 degree temperatures drove us into the cooler confines of the interior...a historic building, converted into a restaurant.

Intimate seating atop a brick flooring are set against floor to ceiling windows in the main dining area which provide a view of the terrace area.  Parking is available in the rear of the building for a small fee.  Thus, our entry through the back of the building was probably not the  most attractive view, but one of the unique peculiarities of the experience

The service is most accommodating and very attentive.  Glasses are continually replenished, the bartender created a virgin cocktail that was unique and refreshing and the orders arrived promptly and steaming hot.  The performance was so flawlessly executed that we were somewhat surprised to find that two hours had passed by in a most pleasant fashion.

Now, for a bit about the food.  We started with a cold soup which was a blended puree of squash and green vegetables infused with thin slices of cucumber.  Hubby opted for French Onion soup, a perennial favorite.  The twist on the French Onion was tender chunks of beef.  Very flavorful and filling...

This was followed by a split appetizer of  a savory French Toast set atop a cheese and Balsamic wine sauce with mushrooms and fresh herbs.  Absolutely splendid!  I would highly recommend trying this item.  It would also make a great light lunch with a bowl of soup.

The entrees are quite hearty.  We could have been satisfied with sharing one.  I had the Pork Two Ways and hubby opted for the Hanger Steak.  Both were well seasoned and I particularly liked the compliment of the breaded/fried cauliflower and pickled onions with my pork.  

Dessert was the most lack luster aspect of the experience.  We tried the honey almond cake topped with blackberries.  While it was moist, I found myself biting into something hard and found a piece of something that was brown and orange...perhaps a bit of carrot that had inadvertently found its way into the batter.  Would have loved to end the meal without that little surprise..but, I guess, it is what it is..."}
{"text":"I had lunch here and it was a good choice. The lunch menu is really affordable for the portion size and quality. I wanted to try the lamb dish, duck confit or a chicken dish, so I decided to get the cassoulet and try a few different meats in one try. I really liked it. It is a great value for $14 at lunch. People spend $10 or so at Applebees without blinking. The service was very friendly and attentive. I sat at the bar, she asked me for my name, told me hers, and I thought that was a nice touch. She even remembered my name on the way out which was shocking. Definitely not a good job for a stoner. The bread was very tasty with great crust and the coffee was also good. I will do lunch again there and try something new. I would recommend it. Bummer about paying for parking though. It is right on the Case campus so it is necessary I guess."}
{"text":"Great warm atmosphere and excellent food.  The service is exceptional.  Patricia was always there when she was needed.  She knew exactly when we were ready to order and the courses were perfectly timed.  There's nothing I cannot stand more than having the mains delivered while the previous course is still on the table.  The person serving the food even waited for me to come back to the table before serving."}
{"text":"Sunday. Waiting excitedly for them to open. My French Onion soup was so incredible. I ordered the savory French Toast and ended up eating it the next day. Then, dessert. CHEESE! We own a cheese shop, so to have someone serve us cheese was a delight. I can't say enough. I want to sit on the patio, but it was too hot that day. I look forward to our future visits."}
{"text":"We celebrated a birthday here last night. Service was exceptional and the food followed suit. Ambiance inside is excellent. Great meal on the pricier side but affordable compared to some other high end spots downtown. Zack Bruell killed them with the artichoke app, chicken liver pate, Cobb salad, trout dish, pork 3ways, veal dish, and of course the burger. The hangar steak was not my favorite. Check this place out!"}
{"text":"Do you want to be treated like a queen/king for two hours all whilst being fed heaping portions of delicious food? Then go here. This place is phenomenal! 

We started with two house cocktails and opted to go for the cheese selections. My SO absolutely loves cheese, and when they pushed out a giant cart of cheese, his face was filled with the biggest smile. Basically the cheese is presented by a sommelier, but for cheese. She went over each type of cheese, the flavor, region, and even the history of some. We wound up picking 7 different cheese, one of which was Napoleon's personal favorite.

I ordered the croque monsieur, while my date had the cassoulet. I made a vocal \"mmm!\" noise when I took a bite into my sandwich, which embarrassed my date, but told me that the food was just that good! We also started with some soups, and I have to say that their french onion was the best I've ever had. I would up skipping most of the cheese since I'd had enough cheese to last a lifetime already, but the broth and pieces of brisket were so good. We ended with the brownie for dessert, and while you can't go wrong with an ice cream-topped brownie, it was perfectly gooey and chocolately.

The staff really made this experience top-notch. Our server (Jeff, I think) was incredibly knowledgeable; we knew nothing about french cuisine going into this, but came out knowing quite a bit. He made great recommendations and made sure we didn't want or need for anything. Every five minutes someone was coming around to offer more bread, or refill water, or wipe crumbs from the table. We really liked one of our cheese selections and the woman presenting them wrote down the name of it so we could find it. She went out of her way to track us down on our way out! 5 star service and food!"}
{"text":"Sit on the patio while it's still nice outside!!  If you're in the mood for something light, I HIGHLY recommend the oysters.  The cheese board is worth it just for the treatment they give you - a cheesemonger comes out with a huge selection and you get to choose from the cheeses right in front of you!!  I've also been one time for brunch and the cod is awesome!  My brother loves the mussels too.  :-)"}
{"text":"The best oysters on the half shell west of the Atlantic Ocean! Delicious French and German inspired cuisine. Excellent service by Jamie and other staff members."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my lunch here. This was my second time here and this time I was able to sit outside. The patio is a very nice, shaded and fenced in area away from traffic and noise. It looks like it would be very inviting at night - there is an outside bar and there are couches and tiki torches and lights throughout the pretty large patio area. The service is spot on and the servers and their assistants are very attentive. There is parking right in front of the restaurant for $2 which is very convenient for the area this restaurant is in right - in the middle of Case Western's Campus. If you enjoy your experience here I recommend you check out the other restaurants operated by the same chef. I have dined at them all and they each present different and unique, but equally good experiences."}
{"text":"What a wonderful place to dine! The food has a very \"French countryside\" feel that is full of flavor and approachable. The atmosphere is modern and comfortable from my perspective. The service at the table was professional and admired from a fellow foodservice professional! I must also commend the wine list; wonderful choice, not too daunting, and well laid out. If I lived a little closer it would be a regular stop for sure, but my occasional visit to Cleveland will surely warrant a visit.
Thank you, L'albratros!"}
{"text":"It's a shame there aren't more French restaurants around. It seems like there are Italian restaurants everywhere, and if you want to get French food you have to pay extra. I wonder why that is. It's not like everyone in France is rich and everything on a French menu is better quality, but c'est la vie. I was really excited to try L'Albatros. After reading the reviews and perusing the menu I was already prepared to order before I walked in the door. Parking was easy and with a reservation on a Wednesday night, we were seated right away. We started with the oysters. They were fresh and tasted delicious. For my entree, I ordered the cassoulet, a braised meat and bean dish. It was a lot of food and well worth it. It turned into two meals, which is good because the whole meal was not cheap. 

I just wish French cuisine was easier to find and there were some more affordable options. It's funny to imagine a chain restaurant like the Olive Garden but French. What would you name such a restaurant?"}
{"text":"One of our favorite places. Summertime eat outside. Cheese board alone is worth going here. Service is attentive - food is fresh and has great 
Alsatian influences. Trout has been my favorite."}
{"text":"The food here is truly phenomenal.  Three of us came here for dinner for my first taste of Cleveland this past weekend and I was tres impressed.  

We started by sharing the soup of the day, a curried vegetable combination.  I'd never tasted anything like it.  It combined Indian and French flavors in a creamy, hot puree.  I was impressed.  

Then between the three of us we ordered the hanger steak, scallops, and lamb.  My hanger steak was cooked perfectly (rare!), was incredibly tender, and there were way too many fries! (that's a good thing).  They even brought out a house mayo (red pepper i'd guess) when we asked for something to dip the fries in.  The bernaise sauce was the best part and I was left full and satisfied.  The scallops were also incredible.  They were large, buttery, and perfectly cooked.  The bed of noodles/veggies/sauce they were on was also too hard to stop eating.  Finally the lamb was also good, but it tasted a little less gamey than we were expecting.  

Overall, the food here is quality food, in good sized portions, and definitely cost less than what I'm used to seeing this food go for in San Francisco, so that was a huge plus.  

The only downside was the service.  We didn't get any oil for our bread, and our attempts to ask for some fell on unobservant servers.  However, the bread and water never went empty.  My goodness, that was impressive.  The amount of time it took to get our food was a little on the long side, and overall I felt they weren't as interested in tending to us as they should have been.  So I'd definitely come back for the food, but I wouldn't anticipate feeling like I was getting any special treatment."}
{"text":"Can't have a bad meal here if you tried.  We came here for my birthday celebration and got a cozy table next to the fireplace - perfect!  Kept me nice and toasty warm and lent a great light to the table!

We ordered escargot, a cheese selection, a frise salad for the table to start.  They were all amazing.  I crave the escargot on a daily basis.

Entrees varied among the table - I had the fish special and it was spectacular.  A short rib and another fish entree were ordered and they were both delicious.  We were all splitting at the seams!

Last, they brought out a dessert for me for my birthday and it was great, too!"}
{"text":"I can't ever say enough about this place.  Definitely in my top 3 restaurants in the city of cleveland.  It's the full package.   Good food, good location , good service, and surprisingly very good prices.  Wine list is extensive which is great.   The cheese board is a must have with cheese options for all tastes.   I think at this point I have had pretty much every item on the menu and you can't go wrong with anything on there.  That said the cassoulet and the hanger steak are favorites.   Enjoy a great French press after dinner.  Deserts are the only thing that I would say is good but nothing exceptional.  That said after the cheese, apps, and meal there's usually no room anyway.  A great experience on the last visit was their wine room which also has a private table for up to 8.  Gets you into a quiet space in the back of the restaurant.   During late spring, summer, and early fall it has one of the top patios in town!"}
{"text":"Excellent service. Great wine list with lots of options. Fresh oysters that were well worth the money. Good frisée salad, but the egg is a fail. That is not a poached egg. Overcooked.  Choucroute garni and baked cod we're outstanding. Creme caramel was perfect.  Finished off the meal with Calvados.  Low prices.  Great restaurant, not excellent."}
{"text":"Best was the French onion soup. Bold flavor with melty gooey cheese. One of the best onion soups. One criticism is that it was a tad over salted. A cup was just enough to leave us craving more

The mussels were fresh and flavorful and pomme frites crispy. The delicious sauce was great for dipping anything. 

Pork 2 ways: a miss. Pork belly was fatty and should have been rendered longer. The shank was overcooked and dry. The cauliflower, while crispy, was bland. 

Took a risk with the \"frozen grand marnier soufflé.\"  While we were warned not to expect a warm soufflé, but a cold dessert, it was completely unexpected to have watery vanilla sauce that resembled nothing of a soufflé in taste or texture. It was neither smooth nor fluffy, and unfortunately not frozen either. It tasted more like ice cream left at room temperature to melt and then served; then someone must have took a swig of our grand marnier because the flavor was nowhere in our dessert. It was only suitable in the coffee as a substitute creamer."}
{"text":"I've made several trips to L'Albatros at this point and I can tell you it is certainly one of the gems of Cleveland. One of the little known gems by those not considered foodies, food connoisseurs, gourmands or whatever other adjective you wish to label those who love great food.  Chef Bruell at L'Albatros and all his other restaurants does a great job for really nailing the cuisine in question.  In the case of L'Albatros it is French cuisine.

Anyone who has eaten French food will know that you won't leave hungry, and by not leaving hungry I mean that the richness of Traditional French food is excellent at tricking you into the age old problem of your eyes being bigger than your stomach. It may not always look like a 24 ounce steak and potatoes, but the deliciously rich and tasty cassoulet will leave you wanting a wheel barrel for dessert.......to wheel you out with.  It may sound like I'm telling you that the food will make you feel miserable and that isn't the case. I'm saying that you should know what you are getting yourself into and order accordingly.  The main reason I warn you is due to a small but very important part of the menu that I won't allow you to miss, the cheese plate. Unfortunately, cheese and charcuterie plates have become \"trendy\" and as a result often times become very generic and forgettable.  So much so that you will probably overlook them on a menu 9 out of 10 times unless you've been to the restaurant before to know they know their stuff.  Well if there is one place in Cleveland not to miss the cheese it is L'Albatros. GM, sommelier and fromager Brandon Chrostowski describes cheese in a way no one else can.  Each cheese is described in such a way that you feel like you are along on a journey with it.  Brandon describes where and how long the cheese is aged, the type of milk it is made from, the scents and subtle tastes you should notice from it.  In the event Brandon isn't the one to deliver your cheese, the others are more than capable of describing the cheese with the very same details but their delivery just may not be as eloquent.

You may wonder why I would write a review mostly about cheese and not about the other food options? Well I've avoided steering you in any one particular direction as far as the entrees go because I've enjoyed enough things to know that if you order something that fits your tastes you will likely not to be disappointed."}
{"text":"I love this place, I can't believe I haven't reviewed it yet!

The food is always spot on, delicious, and it's very reasonably priced!  It's right by us, so super convenient location.  I've been here several times, and I can't even give details of specific dishes because I've had quite a few different things.  But I can say all our selections have been delicious, and we've never left hungry or disappointed.  They have a great wine selection and their cheese platter is quite popular as well.

It's an adorable place, it'd be perfect for a date if you're looking for a date spot.  It's quite romantic!  There's street parking around the area if you look, but if you're lazy, there's a parking lot (I think it costs $3).

-----------------------------------
Explanation of my rating system -
5*: Epitome of something, the best I've had, would LOVE to go back
4*: Great food and happy to go back regularly, but not the best of the category
3*: Food is fine.  I may spontaneously decide to go there based on convenience.  But no need to go back either.
2*: If you insist, I guess I'll come along. I'll find something to eat. But I wouldn't have picked it.
1*: No plans to come back.  I'll try to talk companions out of going."}
{"text":"Well...here is what happened.  I have been to this restaurant twice in the past, closer to when it first opened.  I had been raving about this place to anybody that would listen to me.  Because of my raves, I am forced to write this.
Went there last Sat. night 10/9 with my wife and was terribly disappointed.  Arrived at 5:47 and was seated while waiting for the other couple to arrive.  The arrived a couple of minutes to 6pm.  The wives ordered a glass of wine each at about 6pm.
We ordered 3 salads,one appetizer and our entrees about 6:05 and were served the salads and the appetizer at approx. 6:20.  We finished our salads by about 6:35.  About 10 minutes later our server came by to tell us our entrees would be ready any minute.  Then about 6:50 a gentleman who appeared to be a maître d'  arrived to say the meals were held up because one of the people in our party ordered chicken that was on the bone and it always takes longer when you cook chicken on the bone?!?!?!?
Finally our meals came out about 7:05.  The meals tasted as though they came out of a brine???  They were way...way over salted.
Ok...we should have complained at the time and sent the food back but had tickets to attend Severance Hall.
I could live with almost any of this had the matre'd not given me the bologna story about chicken on the bone taking an hour to cook.  If he had said that maybe they had problems in the kitchen it would not have led to this review.
Maître d'  sir---just hit us with the truth and take the hit.  Nobody in his right mind is going to buy into the logic that it takes an hour to cook to chicken legs and thighs just because they have the bone in them."}
{"text":"I'd like to give them a 3 1/2 , but I can't. Darn!

They have great bread and even better cheese. They have a cheese sommelier like its fine wine! It was a great appetizer and we tried 5 cheeses between 2 couples--perfect amount! Also ordered breaded cauliflower--it came with a spicy sauce and was excellent.

Entrees were different and everyone tried something different. Favorites were Cod and seafood pasta. Caesar salad was boring. Too full for dessert, but it was a great evening out and a good french experience."}
{"text":"Highly recommend this restaurant to all Clevelanders who like good food and can afford to pay for it. I got the french onion soup (which has beef briquet in it!!!!!!!), escargot (best I have ever had) and delicious duck confit. We sat outside and listened to live jazz that was playing next door. The service there was also phenomenal. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Had a great meal during Zach Bruell's restaurant week. Got to L'Albatross early so we were able to visit before the crowd came in. Zach has a line of olive oil. Very good with great crusty bread. Also his own coffee, which is a different blend at each of his restaurants, was bold and smooth--very nice. Service was attentive. A convenient parking lot is in front of the old house restaurant. We paid $3 to park."}
{"text":"Did you know that L'Albatros has one of the best burgers in town? And that the savory French Toast is to die for!? Actually, L'Albatros has one of the my favorite Happy Hours and full menus, and if it wasn't for distance, I'd be here way too much.  The restaurant is the perfect pre- or post-stop after taking in a flick at the Cinematheque, which is within walking distance.  The staff is extremely knowledgable and courteous beyond belief.  My only qualm is with some of the specialty cocktails--a little overwhelming, even for my palate, so it's better to stick with the standards.  However, I'd take any of the staff's recommendations on wine--they know their stuff."}
{"text":"You honestly can't go wrong with this restaurant! I've been here multiple times over the years and they truly never disappoint! 

Mushroom soup with sorrel purée and chives- wonderfully flavored and mild. The sorrel really adds a bright, citrus and grassy flavor that compliments the mushroom so well.

Salad with radish, beets, Camembert style goat cheese, and truffle vinegrette- the dressing was KILLER and the cheese was incredible.

Striped bass with red pepper purée, asparagus, ramps, peas, and mushrooms- the bass was nicely seared, the veggies were great (you can't beat ramps) but the sauce made the dish! It was sweet and bright and really just blended perfectly with the dish.

Cheese plate- I've never found a better cheese board selection outside of San Francisco. The server presenting the cheeses was super knowledgeable and the options were great. I LOVED this! 

Overall, I've never had a bad meal and certainly didn't today. The service is terrific, wine list epic, and ambiance is modern and cool. I'll definitely be back, if only for the cheese!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Cleveland. I've been here 5 or 6 times and have never been disappointed. 

Best dishes:
Escargot - So rich and buttery
Cassoulet - Get this for sure. It's basically a sampler dish of several of the entrees: Lamb Shoulder, Rabbit Sausage, Duck Confit and Pork Belly all in one dish!!"}
{"text":"L'Albatros offers a quality and relatively reasonably-priced lunch selection in the heart of Cleveland's University Circle.  Given its proximity to museums, Severance Hall, and other cultural attractions, it makes for a lovely place to hit before or after the show.  The atmosphere in the smaller room with the fireplace was cosy, not pretentious.  The only goofy blip was discovering someone hotboxing the women's restroom when I went to wash my hands.  There were only 2 stalls, and there was definite pot in the air.  Heaven help you getting the munchies in a place that serves such amazing fries and bernaise sauce!   

I was impressed with the huge diversity of menu options, and also the generous portion sizes.  A bowl of soup will run you between $6-8, and this alone, with the complimentary bread, could make for a satisfying midday nosh.  My salmon entree with bernaise and lentils came out crispy hot and savory.  I could have easily halved it for a second meal at home.  For dessert, the praline ice cream had the sweet and salty balance worked out to perfection.  

Staff were attentive, and my water glass nor my bread plate were never empty.  If you have gluten issues, they can also provide grilled gluten free bread, a nice accommodation.  Definitely worth a return visit."}
{"text":"My parents are regulars here and this is their favorite place to eat in Cleveland. I went with them one night to celebrate my dad's birthday. The menu is delicious (not literally but figuratively) and I want to keep coming back so I can try everything. 

We ended up with the mussels with frites for an appetizer. They were fresh and meaty. For the main meal I had the scallops (because whenever I see scallops on a menu, I must try them). They were well seared and done perfectly. The accompaniments of brussel sprouts, and noodles with pernod cream was perfect. My mom had the veal short rib which was decadent. Dad had steak frite but substituted for mashed potatoes.

If it's your first time there then order the cheese plate. It is an experience I truly enjoyed and was the perfect ending to an amazing meal. 

The space is intimate and busy but also polite."}
{"text":"Ok. This is a sexy joint. Except it's not really a joint. It's a classy French bistro that I wish was in NY and not in Cleveland. The manager/sommelier came to our table to help us pick out another wine (they were out of our first choice). Our waitress was divine. Knew everything there was to know about the menu and had an outgoing delightful demeanor. Plus, a perfect place to have a farewell dinner with the lover you drove 8 hours to visit knowing it might be the last time you ever see him again."}
{"text":"This restaurant has become a benchmark against which we tend to rate other fine restaurants. The service is always impeccable. We noticed recently that one of our favorite waiters was handling manager duties, as he well deserves. L'Albatros is fantastic for a special dinner, or we've even gone for a lazy Saturday post-Art Museum wine and cheese and appetizers (incredibly relaxing, try it).  

Foie Gras: Amazing.
Fromage: Amazing.
Wine: Always Amazing.
Favorites: Cassoulet, the Truffle Soup (if they have it), Duck Confit, Pork Two Ways, Sea Scallops 

After several visits, I have nothing negative to say. Sad that we are moving out of the area, as I've yet to find anything close to L'Albatros in our new surroundings."}
{"text":"We came here for restaurant week 2015. I probably would not have made it out here without a special occasion unless there was a special, eg. restaurant week. For $33 we got three courses. But, we also added on a cheese board. I was SO IMPRESSED with the cheese board. I loved that I got to choose the cheeses and they were patient with me as I asked about each type of cheese. I ended up getting 7 selections and they were all high quality/awesome. For the restaurant week menu, I started with the mushroom soup. Ahh-may-zing. The flavors were well developed and the texture was so smooth. Please never tell me how much cream is in there. :) yum. My entree was the swordfish belly served on a bed of roasted root vegetables. Eeh. It was OK. Now dessert though, that was also really good. I tried the apple cake, the custard, and the chocolate cake. All were fantastic. 
Overall, I will definitely be back to check out the test of the menu!"}
{"text":"We were visiting Cleveland and friends recommended this charming French restaurant.  After excellent French onion soup, I had \"pork two ways\" and my wife had scallops. The Pork was unique and delicious. First was pork belly (like a fist sized chunk of bacon that was cooked and then crisped.). Next was shredded pork formed into a patty,seasoned and crisped in a pan.  Both were delicious.  The scallops were perfectly cooked and on a bed of pasta with shaved Brussels sprouts.  Also excellent.  Portions were large.  Dessert was grapefruit soufflé- also unique, creamy and delicious. 

Service was excellent, prices were reasonable. House Cabernet was \"Edge\" - delicious.  

No complaints"}
{"text":"L'Albatros has an excellent menu. I highly recommend trying the pate appetizer. The restaurant interior is so cute and welcoming."}
{"text":"Bouillabaisse is so nice! It is not on lunch menu but you could ask for it if you want : D Chocolate Napoleon is my favorite here"}
{"text":"Unlimited bread!!!!!! I know nothing better than that! 

They have a great wine selection and appropriately priced food."}
