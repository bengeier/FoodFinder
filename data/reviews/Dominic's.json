{"text":"This is the first time I have been here and was disappointed for a couple of reasons. First of all, our waiter maybe had 2 tables... Us being one of them. He took our simple order and we asked for no mushrooms or tomatoes on one sandwich and no tomatoes on the other. Once the order came, the one had tomatoes and the other had mushrooms. He goes \"I can show you the receipt I put no tomatoes on there but is it cool if you just pick them off? Because if I take it back they will just pick it off for you\". Gross! Then we asked for separate checks and he brought it out together. He seemed like he was intoxicated the entire time and just couldn't concentrate on what we wanted. We had asked if he was and he got very mouthy and started slamming things around. Overall, just a bad experience with the service. The 2 stars is because the food was decent."}
{"text":"Ordered take-out/delivery for lunch and was less than satisfied.  Salads with \"mixed greens\" came with nothing more than a pile of dry iceberg lettuce.  The veggies on top weren't great quality either.  On top of that, the chicken was missing on top.  (although they did send over a new salad with chicken, I'll give them credit for that).  If they can't build a simple salad according to their own menu description then I'm not about to try them again."}
{"text":"Dominic's is a nice little place to duck into and grab a meal before a game at PNC Park - and believe me, the sandwiches and beer here will be a lot cheaper than what you find at the stadium! From my time here they may even be better for you - not by much, of course, but the food here did not upset my stomach, which is something stadium food is always guilty of, so that's a good sign of which has better quality food options in my eyes.  While I wasn't here very long I thought they had some interesting looking menu options to consider, most of which were deli or bar-food sandwiches that are perfect for game days. I ended up getting a chicken sandwich and water and got what I expected: a very big, greasy but yummy sandwich with the right amount of additional toppings, cheeses and sauces. As someone else mentioned, they use Boar Head's meat here, and it's a nice ingredient that helps bump this place up from being an ordinary sandwich shop.   Of course, I guess the bar also makes sure this is more than an ordinary sandwich job; I didn't drink while here because it was 90 degrees outside and I wanted water more than beer, but from what I saw they have a very impressive selection that won't disappoint.  I want to add that they actually had very nice service while I was there - a nice young man brought my food and even picked up the trash as soon as I was done. He was very observant and attentive, which really stood out in my mind because I truly expected that I'd have to pick up my food and then throw the little basket it came in out myself, given the casual setting that Dominic's has. Kudos to them for going above and beyond - I'd love to come back and eat here again if I have the chance."}
{"text":"Wandered by again and noticed that it looked like they had *doubled* their food prices!  Sandwiches are $17 - 19. Hot dogs were $16 !!!    I don't know if they were out to cash in on early Pirates season, or trying to soak all the contractors that are around working on the park. But there's no way I'm paying a premium to eat their food."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, most recently about a year ago.  I don't remember what I ordered the first time, but the second time, I ordered the snob (caprese) salad (is this supposed to be a dig at foodies?).  It was pretty basic, consisting of sliced tomatoes, fresh mozzarella slices, and basil leaves drizzled with balsamic vinegar, but it was fresh and quite tasty--comparable to versions I've had as appetizers in Italian style restaurants.  Not bad for Federal St., and prices are less expensive than at SoHo.  The outdoor seating provides a great place to come to people watch, esp. on game days.  One of the days I was here before a Steelers game in Heinz Field, and the street was flooded with people in black and gold with Terrible Towels.  About halfway through our lunch, there was a commotion at the bar across the street--first a police officer showed up, then a fire engine, and then an ambulance--and my dining partner and I wondered what in tarnation was going on over there.  Finally, a guy in a Steelers jersey was brought out on stretcher and loaded into the ambulance.  Looks like someone must have pregamed a bit too much!  The first time I was here, there was also live music on the porch, which was nice.  Overall, not a bad place to grab some grub before a game. 3.5 stars,"}
{"text":"Poor service. We waited for our food so long that I had to leave for a meeting... Several customers who came in well after us received their food as we waited.. My co worker brought back the food since I could no longer wait.. Of course my order was not there.   It's like they completely forgot about us. Not exactly the best way to treat a paying customer.   I had to call and was told to come back. Apparently they did not understand that reason I could not wait, was because I had to go back to work. They wasted over an hour and a half of my time... Just for hummus. All they had to do was put it in a container. It's not like it was a special order. Hummus and pita. That is it.  I will not be coming back. There are plenty of other places on the north shore where I would rather spend my money."}
{"text":"Great service and selection. Be prepared to wait a little at lunch since they have to prepare every item, but all their selections are great."}
{"text":"Not too bad.  Came here in the morning before a Sunday afternoon Pirate game and got a salad.  It was the first order of the cook's morning, and I actually heard him make a comment about the first order being a chicken salad.. (deduction of a star).  Also, the waitress put mistakenly put in my order twice, so maybe it was just the morning that was affecting her, but I didn't mind but the chef did.  The salad was definitely good, but it was just alright, and for 8.50, I wasn't too shabby."}
{"text":"Decent beer selection and right outside the stadium. Servers are not very knowledgeable on the beers that they offer. Had nachos and they were just okay; nothing spectacular though. Nice location to watch the game if you didn't get tickets. Would go back."}
{"text":"I stopped over here to grab a bite to eat for lunch before I went to PNC park to join my meet up group for the game. I had recently suffered a fracture on my toe and needed a place to sit down.  I came in and the staff was very friendly. They offered me a bar stool to sit on and another to prop my foot on. Known for a wide assortment of beers I was just hungry to grab a sandwich and drink. I ordered the turkey Rachel panini which was very filling.  The waitress was very helpful and offered to get me another drink without my having to lower my leg. Prices here are more reasonable than what you would pay inside the ball park. Food was okay and my sandwich came with a pickle. They have take out available if you choose and normally they try to get the food to you without a lengthy wait."}
{"text":"On an random walk I encountered Dominic's. I went in and decided to get a bite to eat. It was there that I found the best BLT I have ever laid my taste buds upon. Nicely toasted bread filled in with fresh crunchy lettuce and a monstrous pile of smoked bacon. Not only was this sandwich delicious but it's also good for you too!! Okay so that second part isn't entirely true but it did taste great.  All of their meats are Boar's Head meats and they do a very good job at preparing your meal. The price is pretty reasonable too. They have a bar there but I have yet to try it out.   In summary, if you are by the baseball stadium and need some lunch, check this place out."}
