{"text":"Looks old inside and out and the food is ok. Casual. Chips and salsa are good! Like eating on the patio in the summer."}
{"text":"Excellent Smitty burgers! Bonus is the Yuengling on tap or in the bottle. Great place for a burger or a drink."}
{"text":"The transition away from its original dive location into its new family-oriented spot has seen mixed success. The burgers are still good and I suppose frozen krinkle-cut fries is a step up from the complete lack of fries it had before. But a perfectly reasonable place to meet someone for lunch. Also, I met Obama there."}
{"text":"Perfect for a quick lunch break.   The building and menu are old school (the burgers are frozen and the use crinkle fries)... but they have been true to the origial intent. The building has been kept in great shape and updated so you don't feel like you're in a dirty diner.   Overall- great tradition and decent lunch for Elyria."}
{"text":"What ever happened to stopping into Smitty's for a relaxing time, friendly atmosphere, burgers and beer?  The beer was fine, but we left quickly before ordering food because of the raunchy language.  True, we're in a BAR, but who wants to listen to foul-mouthed patrons who scream the F word, G*D* and C*S* every few minutes.  And the owner was there.  How can this be tolerated?"}
{"text":"Never disappointed! Food is always hot and fresh and consistent. You can't go wrong with a Smitty Burger and fries!"}
{"text":"Once was more than enough for me.  Waited more than 5 minutes to even be acknowledged once we walked in.  Three tables open.  Why the wait?  Food was average.  I had the philly beef steak and onion rings.  Not sure why this place seems so popular."}
{"text":"For cheap eats they can't be beat!  And what's more is even President Obama recently saw fit to grace Smitty's with his presence to enjoy the \"famous\" Smitty Burger.   Decent 'diner style' food at an affordable price.  If you looking for a cheaper than average quick bite, or a long lunch with friendly, quick, attentive service this is the place."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and had the honey mustard wrap. Good basic wrap but the service was pretty slow. It was very packed and it seems like a lot of locals go there. There only seemed to be two waitresses working the whole place so it took awhile to get water, orders in, and food finally out. Overall decent food but be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"My sister and I decided to try out as many of the Lenten fish fries as possible.  This means I will be eating at various perch places over the next 5 weeks. Smitty's was yesterdays pick.  To say it was a disappointment is being kind. The 2 stars were given because the wait staff were very nice, not because the $15 perch fish fry was good.  I believe it was perch although it was an over cooked pale yellow crusted pretender to the throne of a real deep fried fresh perch version. It looked baked rather than being a fresh fish dropped in hot oil to come out golden brown and delicious. The only saving grace about this meal was the cole slaw which was excellent."}
{"text":"Smitty's is great.   There is nothing fancy about it, but it offers good food at a good price and always good service.  Perfect place to meet up with friends and the patio out back is nice.  Wings are awesome and cheap on Sundays.  I always go for the Smitty Burger and chili"}
{"text":"I'm sad. The Smitty burger used to be something to marvel at. You would open the container and drool everywhere. Now its just sad. The fries are the crappy crinkle ones and the meat patties are premade frozen yuckieness. The side salad is lettus with the 'secret' sauce and that's it. I understand saving money everywhere you can, but I would gladly pay more for what was an amazing burger. The only reason I gave 2 stars is because the staff is great."}
{"text":"I guess if you're looking for slightly sub-standard bar fare straight from the freezer, Smitty's might be the way to go.  I think it's incredibly lazy for a bar/restaurant that has a deep fryer to serve frozen onion rings or breaded mushrooms straight out of the bag, but to then charge $2.25 or $3.60 (respectively) for them??? Ridiculous.  Even the \"legendary\" Smitty burger has declined in recent times.  Smitty's has a loyal following and got a boost from a visit from Obama, but there are certainly better spots in the area..."}
{"text":"This was the 1st restaurant that I tried on Yelp!  My mom remembered hearing something about the President's visit and we read the great review from Rachel, so we thought we'd check it out.  It was fabulous.  We didn't try the burgers, but had the appetizer special- nothing like good fried bar food and also had the potato soup which was really good.  We also enjoyed the french fries.  They were crinkle cut, but thin, not thick, which made them really good.  And, our meal was extremely reasonable.  We'll be back."}
