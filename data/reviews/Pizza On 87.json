{"text":"This place is awesome. Besides the excellent food (the berry bites are insanely good), the staff is super friendly. Props to Thomas, that guy knows hospitality. Go get yourself a Big @SS slice, some wings, and save room for berry bites (everybody has to try them once)!"}
{"text":"Good was really good and the garlic knots were nice, but it took over an hour for the food to get here. When they finally got here the driver mistakes the recite for cash instead of credit. They did most of it right but they had an occasional mess up whenever I order now."}
{"text":"First time trying this place and it was one of the best pizza joints. Had it delivered and was told 45 mins but the delivery guy showed up in only 20 mins and the pizza was still hot!! Definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite pizza place around. The pizza is so good. Their garlic knots are the best hands down. I was defeated by their giant pizza challenge but I will be back for a second shot. Friendly and cheery upon arrival. Good local company"}
{"text":"I have gone to pizza on 87 several  times. Every time I go the service  is fast and friendly.  I have tried different items each time, everything from single  slices (which are huge) to wings and a pizza to go. I was told to try the garlic knots and now I'm hooked.   Not only was I impressed  by the food but everything  is very reasonably  priced! There was a nice patio  on the outside  and they had tv's playing the playoff game. I was surprised  to see they even have beer! I will definitely  continue  to go back.   You have earned yourself a regular."}
{"text":"Very good pizza. I like to stick with the basics the first time around and got the pepperoni pizza. Was very satisfied with the size, price and taste. I highly recommend this pizza joint. I will definitely use this place as the go to pizza place when I am in Chandler."}
{"text":"A well deserved review!!!  Pizza on 87 has always been my favorite. Their pizza is so delicious. Best I've had in Arizona, hands down. I would eat it every day if I could! They also have super nice employees and their delivery times deserve a gold medal   Today, I ordered a surprise pizza for my boyfriend and in the delivery instructions, I asked if they could write a note for him and they totally came through. They also threw in some complimentary frosting bites for him. Best service ever.  Thanks, guys! You made his day and mine!"}
{"text":"Great pizza! Crust and sauce are excellent and toppings are satisfactory. I wish the ham was better. Crust is buttery gralic.  Salads are large portions. All in all, a thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I more often receive delivery rather than grab some take out, I finally was able to taste Pizza on 87. The Big A$$ Slice was huge!! Very delicious, and I also ordered fried zucchini.. one of my favorites. The zucchini was delicious crispy and flavorful, portion size wasn't optimal... however they did include ranch. Tasty and delish all the way around.   If you chose to visit this location for a sit down meal they have great pizza and beer deals, that is something I will be happy to check out. The customer service was great, happy to serve and obviously proud of the food they provide to their customers. I definitely recommend Pizza on 87 for take out!  I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"I tried ordering from this place but was told they only deliver within a 4 mile radius.  When I hung up the phone I went to my gps and it showed 3.6 miles.  Probably a 7-10 minute drive at the very most.  Oh well thought I would try something different but wound up calling Rosatis who has no problem delivering to me.  I think Rosatis is even further away from me than Pizza 87.  If I ever stop in this place for lunch and I like their pizza I will update this review."}
{"text":"Great place, low cost. The pizza and wings are great!! The beer is cold and the asphalt ale is $2 a glass. Best deal in town, plus they make the biggest party pizza I have ever seen. Great place! Check them out!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza and salad. Excited to have found this gem. Not the best part of Chandler but don't let that fool you. They messed up one pizza but ended up giving us an even better one plus a free pizza! Chef salad was awesome and huge. Great value all around!"}
{"text":"I just discovered this place about a week ago and their pizza is delicious! I'm very picky with my pizza and so many places in the east valley aren't that great, this place is. So tonight I went to see if I was in the radius of their delivery service, they said I was too far, that their limit is 5 miles. I didn't think I was that far though, seemed closer when I drove there last week. So I when I pulled up Yelp it says it's 3.5 miles.. My maps said 4.3 for fastest route. That's still not 5 miles! You bet I called back. It's pathetic giving false information to customers or not even knowing what you're doing. So the girl said she would do it this one time and let me know if I was still too far for future orders(still confused?) she said it'd be about 50 minutes.. More like an hour and 20 mins or so.. Pizza was barely warm and the guy that delivered started off nice and became rude when I told him I wasn't 5 miles and he insisted I was. He pretty much walked away shaking his head not wanting to discus it. It was very awkward. I feel like I seem like that annoying customer lol They need to figure out how they run their delivery service, as you can see I'm not the only one with this same weird complaint, and the other guy was told the delivery radius was 4 miles. Which is it? So I may not be returning. Maybe one day if I'm really craving Pizza (rolling eyes) because as annoying as this was, I'll probably return because it's so good. It's not even fair.."}
{"text":"Yum! This is good NY style pizza. Crust was perfect, thin w/soft thick rolled edge. Ordered Jumbo 18\" half sausage, half pineapple and a Caesar salad. Salad was really fresh and I loved how small the lettuce pieces were cut. Staff was really friendly. Will definitely go back. This place is 10-15 min drive from my house (and they don't deliver south of the 202) so we won't be able to get pizza from here as often as we'd like."}
{"text":"This is my 3rd time eating at this place and my 1 st eating in no letdowns  so far !! great pizza great service great wing great portions and great prices  definetly a hidden gem  you have to come!!!"}
{"text":"For what it is,  it's great.  Pizza is NY style and better than all the franchise pizza joints' pizza.  Also better price points.  The garlic knots, fried mushrooms and mozzarella sticks are the best, at their price points.  The wings are also very good, although the sauces, other than hot, are not as thick as I prefer.  Where this place really shines is in their salads.  As low cost as the salads are, they are huge and stuffed with toppings!  The food always arrives very hot, as if you were dining in."}
{"text":"Decided to branch out from our usual -big mistake. Whole pizza was slathered in some garlic oil butter slop, effectively ruining it. Seriously- the kids each picked at a slice, rest went in the trash. Please forgive me Clockwork Pizza, I've learned my lesson, I'll never take your excellent pizza for granted just for some fried mushrooms ever again!"}
{"text":"Ordered a delivered pizza and garlic knots for first time. Garlic knots are good, pizza not so good.  The pizza arrived soggy.  I don't believe it was cook enough.  The toppings were good without the crust."}
{"text":"Great Pizza. Owner moved here from Big Boys Pizza! This place even better than that was. I will keep coming back here. Especially since I live closer."}
{"text":"This place is just awful...I went in while waiting for my car to be fixed across the street. Mind you I have never been here before.... I ordered the teriyaki wings and I didn't like the sauce... I asked the waiter if I could exchange my meal I already paid for... The waiter said he'd have to ask the cook... I them told him to let me talk to the cook since he's in charge. The cook was reluctant to exchange my meal.. Even though all of the wings were there... He then tells me... Next time taste the sauce first. Wtf? Where do they do that at? I mean even McDonald's will exchange my food if something's wrong... This place had horrible customer service. The waiter was cool... But f*** the cook.."}
{"text":"No brainer. This little gem is great for dining in as well as delivery. I love the friendly staff and their pizza is just fantastic! This is the first choice for us when it comes to delivery . We appreciate the great pizza and great service you always provide us guys! Keep up the great work you proof not all heroes wear capes!  Not happy with the customer service i tried calling twice to order and ive been left on hold for so long had to order another pie"}
{"text":"Just ordered here after realizing I hadn't eaten all day. Thought I'd try a new local joint! The pizza and wings were hot and crispy. Pizza crust has a nice chew/crunch balance, not greasy and is seasoned well. The toppings were fresh and flavorful and generously applied. Delivery was super fast on Eat24, like under 40 minutes which is impressive. Delivery man was super nice! Looking forward to leftovers tomorrow. Yay."}
{"text":"The employees are always welcoming and the food is great. The salads are by far my favorite at any pizza place. Always enjoy making a trip out there just to get out of the normal chain restaurants. Give them a try and get a big ass slice."}
{"text":"Checked out the reviews before we ordered and decided to give it a try.  Pizza was pretty good, and I'm not a big fan of lots of sauce, so after reading others reviews I have to say they were correct about being light on sauce. Garlic knots were good, and they piled lots of lettuce on the Greek salad."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza place. The pizza is thin and the wings are delicious. My favorite sauce is sweet chili. You can get a slice, 5 wings, and a drink for like $8...  the slices are so big that you can split with someone. They have a lot of toppings including spinach and the salads, garlic knots, and mozzarella sticks never disappoint!"}
{"text":"Simply fantastic pizza, reasonably priced, incredibly friendly staff, and the garlic knots are brilliant. Pretty much a weekly staple for me."}
{"text":"Super greasy. Sadly I prefer dominoes. Over priced in my opinion as well."}
{"text":"Excellent service and pizza as good as I've found in AZ. Crust is perfectomundo."}
{"text":"The pizza was so good! HUGE, awesome cheesy slices and delicious crust.  I'm not normally a crust eater either, but I finished off whole slices. The sauce was very tasty as well.  I've probably eaten pizza from every pizza shop from Scottsdale to LA and this is one of the bests. (I've also lived in NE for 10 years so I feel I have some say in whats good in the pizza biz). Garlic knots were top notch! ;) Lastly, delivery was typical-30-45 mins but worth it!"}
{"text":"The pizza is great but the salads are the bomb, everything is always fresh and on time"}
{"text":"Food is bomb but the suicide flavor wings  is freaking hot that not even drenched in ranch helps lmao I couldn't  feel my mouth after taking one bite"}
{"text":"Employees are great. Salads are big, pizza was the best I've had in AZ. They need to work on dpreadi g toppings more evenly.  Since 80's when It's Pizza Time closed. Wings were a little tough."}
{"text":"I have been looking for a good affordable pizza as so many gourmet pizza places are out of the price range for most pizza circumstances such as a party. This place has good pizza at great prices. I will never order from a chain again."}
{"text":"Wings amazing! Best around!  Pizza cold and burnt and looked nothing like other pictures...completely bummed and wondering if I ordered wrong.  I got a pepperoni and cheese.  More grease than cheese though.  I love greasy NY style pizzas but usually it's smothered in cheese and not black on the bottom.  :("}
{"text":"Ok.... with grub hub. Me and my family were so pleased with the food (quality) and delivery time. You guys hit it out of the patk. Thank you guy's for the big Ass pizza/ wings and knots. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"They flyered the community that I live at so we thought we would try them out.  Great deals and lots of options. The delivery wasn't very speedy and once the food did come, the pizza was cold, the quality of chicken wasn't the best.  I'm not completely pointing the finger at them but later that night both my boyfriend and I got sick.  I'll stick with NYPD."}
{"text":"I love this place! It has amazing pizza and wings. Their big ass slice is more then enough for one person and the prices are good. I tell all my friends about this place."}
{"text":"I hate calling in an order and someone on the other line has such a bad attitude that you actually lose your appetite.  We have ordered pizza from them before and we must have been lucky so far by getting the owner or someone who takes ownership in what they do. Today wasn't that kind of day.  I work too hard for my money to spend it at an establishment that doesn't appreciate the golden rule in business \" sales are a good thing\""}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I'm from buffalo NY. I like a little thicker crust then typical New York style and when I ordered from here, I asked then how they would describe their pizza, and they guy said New York style and I would agree.  We ordered the large pizza and garlic knot special, and as someone else started in a previous review, the garlic knots were lacking a little bit. I don't know what was missing, but it just needed more flavor.  The pizza was pretty good. It reminded me of the pizza I used to get back home. Had good flavor and they gave a good amount of toppings.  If I could give three and a half stars I would, but it wasn't the best pizza I've ever had, but I would order from them again.  I wish they did a new client special, but when I asked they said they don't offer that at all, and they also don't do military discounts (most places don't)."}
{"text":"Hell. Yes. This place rocked my world. I'm not a fan of deep dish pizzas so their big A$$ slice was perfect and crispy and had all the right flavors. My husband and I got their slice and wings meal deal which was 7.99. I also grabbed a beer and it was only $2-$3 which made me even happier. I don't remember the last time I enjoyed a pizza place so much...but I could eat here again and again. Their wings were freshly made (I heard the crackling of hot oil) with the yummy honey bbq sauce. Wings were to die for. Customer service was excellent- the guys were friendly and upbeat."}
{"text":"We first had Pizza On 87 the day we moved into our new home. My whole family was there to help and naturally needed food. I chose them because they were a small business and had great reviews. Everyone in my party loved the pizza. Now, every time my cousin's or other family comes over (from the West valley) they request this pizza. It continues to please us."}
{"text":"Can't say enough about Pizza On 87! Tried it for the first time tonight with the kids (8 and 3). Pizza slice (a meal in itself!) 5 wings and a  20 oz(?) drink for less than $8! All four of us are for $30.17 (not including tip) and had pizza, wings, garlic knots and drinks (soda, no adult beverages this trip but plan to have them next time! Specials look great!) Owner helped us but the entire staff treated us like VIP guests as well including a special treat for the boys while we were there and another before we left! The only thing better than the food was the outstanding service! We will be back... And often.  We have been looking for a new \"go to\" pizza joint, and we found it!!!"}
{"text":"This is some real good thin crust pizza.  Crispy, chewy huge slices on the jumbo.  Fresh, hand tossed dough (you can actually see the guy through the window throwing dough).  I never knew about this place, but my cousin raved about it.  Then I saw the reviews and knew I had to get there.  Pizza is outstanding and so are the wings, especially the sweet red chili.  I appreciate the friendly staff, they really enjoy what they do.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great new place for pizza! Owner very friendly and helpful, offered us complimentary garlic knots with marinara sauce (yum). Pizza slices are very tasty and made fresh. Oh and the slices are huuuge!!  Did i mention amazing prices too?"}
{"text":"Pizza is really good. Hand tossed and cooked to perfection. They even add a little garlic butter to the crust it tasted like. Now the slice itself is definitely thin but its not your NY style crust, a lot more dough and man its good. Family owned and super friendly, great prices also. Check it out."}
{"text":"We've tried these guys three times now. First time was amazing. Went in, owner was there and he's great. We thought we'd found our new pizza spot. That first visit the pizza was delicious, perfect crust on the bottom etc. they deliver to our house, so we ordered again.  Pizza was a world apart from what it was the first time. No sauce, toppings randomly placed, crust was soggy. It was disappointing. We also ordered the honey bites, 75% of them were hard as rocks and the product as a whole was just meh. We called and they said the owner would call us. Sent him the info/pictures and let him know we weren't trying to get anything out of it, even though we paid for something we clearly didn't get.  Yesterday we decided to give them another shot. We didn't even bother calling the store again, because sadly we feel like nothing will be done about it. The pizza was almost sauce less again. (We got the white pizza with chicken, mushrooms and bacon.) We thought that maybe it would be better. Now we don't like a ton of sauce like some places do, but you've gotta have some on it! The delivery guy came and didn't bring change with him. We're not the type to not tip, but this guy pretty much shot himself in the foot with that. We went to the car and dug out some quarters so he wouldn't leave empty handed. Now I will say that we added mushrooms to this order to meet the $15 minimum, and those were pretty tasty. However, when we ordered we asked for extra ranch and that didn't show up. The delivery guy said he would come back and unsurprisingly he didn't.  I'd really love to give these guys a glowing review, but I just can't after paying for things I'm just not getting. If you're going to stop in and eat, I'd say hands down do it. But if you're going to get delivery be wary. The drivers don't seem to really care about anything except getting their tips. It's sad for me because the owner we chatted with, Dennis I believe was his name, is wonderful. He's got a great idea and now just needs the right people to help him out."}
{"text":"I am torn about this review. I have reviewed then before and was get positive but my last Wednesday night my experience was less than stellar.  They have a great special on their wings on Wednesday. $.60 for great wings. I ordered 2 large pizzas and 24 wings. The guy told me the price, which was $60 something. It seemed high and I said how much are the wings. He said, \"Oh wait\". After recalculated it and gave me a new price. I paid and fast and waited with my nephew.  We each had a beer while waiting. After awhile he asked what I ordered. I told him. He looked confused. It seems that he put in the order for 1 wing. I had people waiting at my parents house. I was l little irritated but my nephew said we could take the pizza home and he would come back for the wings.   So I paid another $15+ for the forgotten wings and left. I don't expect something for nothing but this was his screw up and caused us to make two trips. Maybe a comped beer or something would have been nice.   It won't stop me from coming in when I'm in town but it could have been handled better.  The pizza and wings are great. The owner is great at customer service. They are still my favorite pizza place on Chandler."}
{"text":"We love this little place! It's a super casual, small spot to get very inexpensive pizza. You can actually watch them hand toss the crust, since there's big window that looks into the kitchen. Kids love it! The crust is delicious, too. Be prepared for a wait (although they do have a few little games you can grab and play as you wait), as the food is fresh (this is not instant pizza), but so worth it!!   P.S. This might be the safest place in town for pizza, as cops in uniform seem to get a free slice (I think, but I'm not 100 percent sure - someone told me they do, and I've seen many officers in there) - it's your chance to thank our officers up close and personally for what they do for us in the community! :D"}
{"text":"I placed an order for delivery. No problems with customer service at all! Super friendly person I interacted with. My food got here and wow... As soon as I opened the box I knew the pizza was going to be good! Closest I've had to east coast pizza yet! Real pizza is greasy and this hit the spot! The garlic knots were really yummy. I loved the marinara sauce. The mozzarella sticks were good, but nothing super special. Still no complaints.   Can't beat the price though! I would've spent more if I had gone to a chain pizza place and the food would've been just ok. I absolutely recommend this place! REAL pizza. Great price. And delivers! I I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Food is all about presentation. How can you send someone 24 wings...and have them come unflavored? Especially when it's requested that a specific flavor be on the wings, and another flavor on the side. Pathetic. Contact the restaurant, and what's the response? \"Oh, do you want us to send you more?\" No...I don't want more from a place that can't get a simple order right. I want my money back."}
{"text":"I am originally born raised Queen, NY.  I have tasted all kinds of pizza.  My family is from Argentina and there is a lot of Italians in Argentina that know how to make a good pizza. I know my pizza :) I am in health and fitness business so I am mindful of my nutrition and once a week I allow my self to have a cheat meal.    I look forward to going to Pizza on 87 :) I will not compare it to NYC, Argentine or Zimbabwe pizza!  Plain and simple it's damn good pizza. Big slice and drink for less than $6 you can't beat that with a bat.  Been going for over 6 months everyone is friendly and the food is yummy. Can't wait till next Friday when I get a chance to go back :)"}
{"text":"This is a family owned business. Located in an old plaza. Place is clean and they have a window to the kitchen so you can watch them prepare pizza dough. This is enough to keep my toddler fascinated. Staff is friendly and accommodating. Place is small but they have outside seating. The pizza is amazing. First time I went, my husband and I each ordered a big ass slice of pizza. They were not kidding. It was huge! Biggest slice of pizza I've ever been served. The wings were ok, nothing special about them. Since our first visit, my husband and I have been back twice."}
{"text":"From the guys at Discount Tire on Chandler Blvd and Dobson.... Thank you! We love the food! Great customer service. Ordered over the phone, we ordered two of the GIANT PIZZAS, and they are HUGE! We have a large group of guys here and we are struggling with the second pizza! The pizza taste amazing and the Garlic knots are just as awesome! Loved the service and and the food, we will definitely be doing more business here. Thank you!"}
{"text":"We just got delivery and everything was nice and hot when it got delivered. Wings were delicious but a little dried out on the sauce, the pizza however tasted okay, if only the cheese and toppings would stay on. Me and my boyfriend both have worked in pizzerias both as line cooks, pizza chefs and servers, and we were amazed by how badly this pizza was cooked. Loved the wings, but I don't think we'll order from here again."}
{"text":"We had a pizza & garlic knots & mozz sticks it was Delicious !! Def. Must try ! Not bad for the buck ! Fast delivery ! Only thing wish they would have gave us all drumsticks only on our wing order.... But that's ok still bomb !"}
{"text":"Great price, amazing pizza!! I always get the big ass slice combo with a drink and it's beyond good."}
{"text":"Heard about a new spot on Arizona Ave, and had to try it.  Walking into Pizza on 87th, you are struck by two things. First, it is immaculately clean. The place shines. The second thing is that you SMELL amazing food. Think about it, when you walk into a huge pizza chain, you don't smell anything. At Pizza on 87th your nose is met with the great scents of garlic, oregano, basil- all floating through the air.  Pizza on 87th has a cool, industrial feel to it, there are pallets turned benches, and it's laid out nicely. Great customer service, the staff are friendly and provide great customer service.  The food is the star here, and the pizza and the deals are tough to beat. I bought a large pizza and order of garlic knots and it was just over $10. It's pretty clear that Pizza on 87th would rather have customers for life, than gouge you and you never return.  The pizza was very good, you could tell these guys know what they are doing, and use great ingredients. Fresh mozzarella, tasty pepperoni, and it is handled with care. One of the owners was telling me that they are working on having a really cozy patio, so large groups (in nice weather) can have their pizza and relax.  Give this place a shot, you won't be disappointed. Pizza on 87th is where classic pizza meets great prices and service."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Small place, no table service, but there are board games and draft beer. Lots of great food; not a lot of money. Had the house salad, wings, 2 slices, and mozzarella stick appetizer. Perfect pizza crust, etc, etc."}
{"text":"Have had poor interactions with this pizza place prior but the owner reached out and did everything they could to make it better - so I'm updating my review and would certainly recommend them in the future."}
{"text":"Good pizza and good prices. This place is a fair deal good prices comprable to the quality and taste of the food. It can be very busy to eat in so we mostly only carry out"}
{"text":"We were looking for somewhere new to try for wings & found this restaurant. I ordered through Yelp (Eat 24). I had a $39 order and ordered wings (teriyaki, medium, honey BBQ), cheese bread, 1 slice of pizza & mozzarella sticks. I paid w/card & delivery time was 45-75 mins. The food came in about an hr. & we live less than a mile out. I had to go outside to find the delivery driver. Not a huge deal. I get apartments can be difficult. In any event, the delivery driver seemed frazzled.  He wasn't going to have me sign for my food (almost forgot). I also couldn't tip on the receipt like every other delivery place & had no cash which made me feel bad. Little did I know, the mozzarella sticks were missing. I call the pizza place less than 5 minutes after thinking maybe they left them in the car. The guy I spoke with proceeds to ask me if I'm sure my cheese sticks weren't in the bag.... yes, that's why I'm calling. The way I was asked felt like I was trying to get one over on them. The solution was giving me the $5 back for the cheese sticks. Not next time you order we will give you a can of pop or even an apology for the inconvenience. I pretty much just didn't get what I ordered and that's about it. Too bad the customer service  was below average because the food was good. I won't however order here again."}
{"text":"This is our third visit to Pizza on 87 and will not be our last. We only order one slice because it's bigger than one could ever imagine.  I always order the Feta and Jalapeno slice. My first bite was a crispy crunch of delightfulness, Not sure if that's a word but it is now.  First the crunch of the perfectly cooked pie followed by the best blend of cheeses and then finished with an Italian herb cheese flavor that leaves no doubt to how good the pie is. Looking into the kitchen they must be using real pizza ovens instead of these roll through ovens everyone else is using.  Just when I was just recovering from my first bite of satisfaction I notice several flavors of hot sauce on the counter.  Not just any hot sauce but my favorite hot sauce in the world Arizona Gunslinger. So I grab all the flavors but use only the green...I add parm shake and I'm in heaven!!!  Just when I think it can't get any better I noticed some frosted mugs in the freezer.  The Mugs looked as if they had been frozen for weeks and had a coat of Ice on them, well since it was 100 plus degree's outside I gave in.  But the choice of which beer would compliment my pie was causing my pizza high to fade.....lucky for me a bystander step in an offered me some beer samples and saved the day while my pie was still hot.  I think the bystander was the owner because he just walked into the kitchen and started pouring me some samples without consulting anyone.  I told my Wife this guy must be a beer God!!!  When I took the first sip of my brew, I could feel the Ice flakes flowing down my throat...OMG...This beer is a B.L.F......Barley, Liquid, Form.  I almost passed out from joy and happiness.  I will remember this day forever.  To top things off the kids wanted some wings but I told them \"I don't think this is a wing place why don't we wait\" But they insisted so we got some Mango Habanero wings.  I told the kids I'll try one and to my amazement they were as good as any other wing I have tasted.  I found myself sucking on the bone for about 30 minutes and even suck out some of the marrow.  I used to be a Pizza Chef and can tell you...This place is the SH_T!!!!!! Bring your whole family, what a prize finding this spot.  Just Damn....Sorry about long review..."}
{"text":"I went here before and it rocked. I think its gotten more expensive. The lady at the register had zero personality or friendliness. She said if I got half pepperoni and half pineapple on a pizza they would charge me for 2 toppings even though its only half thr amount of each topping. I asked if they could make honey medium wings instead of honey hot and she said,\" No. \"  Real short. She asked if we wanted ranch or blue cheese with the dozen wings and we said ranch. Then, since they didn't give me a receipt, I went back up and asked for one and realized they charged 50 cents for the ranch which they never mentioned. Overall nickel and diming and lack of customer service left bad taste in my mouth. Pizza was good and the bathrooms were clean."}
{"text":"Very poor place to order from, they will only deliver if they feel like it. I had order from them before and had no problems getting it delivered.  Tried to order a pizza from them today and was told that I was two far for delivery. I guess 2.5miles is to far. Would not recommend ordering from them to anyone of my friend. Place your order beware should be posted on their yelp posting.. good luck hope you live within 2.5miles."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Chandler. The recent review regarding their customer service is surprising. The first time I ordered from them I called about 20 minutes before they closed to see if they would still deliver, and they came through. Not only did they accept my order, but the gentleman that was taking my order was extremely patient, and even made suggestions based on what I was ordering to save me a little cash.  Everything I've ordered so far has been excellent. Last weekend I ordered a large white pizza, and couldn't walk away from it. I have no shame in admitting I ate a whole pizza, because it was just that good. Keep it up!!"}
{"text":"Sat outside windy but nice, $$ big ass pizza was exactly that great taste nice service & wings were good. Spicy not honey bbq. Bring an appetite"}
{"text":"The pizza was very tasty and just what I was looking for from a local pizza joint.  The crust was not your typical pizza crust... It was a bit flaky and had a hint of garlic to it which made for a great tasting pizza. Their wings were probably some of the better wings I've had in the valley and I would definitely return for both the pizza and their wings."}
{"text":"Absolute worst pizza experience I've ever had. I was quoted 20 to 30 minutes and delivery took an hour and 20. The driver called at the one hour mark and said he couldn't find the address where his GPS took him to. I was visiting Arizona and used 3 different GPS systems, all of which had no issues getting me to this location.  I first noticed that the box was very greasy at the front where it opens. After I opens tho box, I noticed that ALL toppings from the middle of the pizza had slid to the front side of the box. It looked like it was not just carried on its side, but more like someone flung it around in a circle 3 or 4 times. To top things off, the food was barely mediocre, at best. The garlic knots were dry and flavorless, and the chicken wings were sub-par Tyson nuggets from the local Walmart, as best I could tell. Overall, absolutely terrible experience and will not be frequenting this place on future trips to AZ."}
{"text":"I love the pizza here but after being placed on hold tonight for 3 different times for 10 minutes each time, sitting on the phone like an idiot I won't be calling anymore. Lisa or Alyssa whatever her name is if she doesn't like customer service positions she should find a new job."}
{"text":"Just ordered pizza from here, the phones are a little weird.. First was on hold for 10 min then recalled and they took me right away.. So I think she forgot. Anyways she wrote down the completely wrong address and complex number! Poor pizza guy was so frustrated but so nice! Loved him and he was professional and stayed positive! As for the pizza it's amazing!! We got the big a pizza thinking it would feed four boys and a pregnant girl.. And it was perfect with left overs for munching later! The garlic knots are super good to as others have reviewed! Will order here again!"}
{"text":"The pizza is great ..the only problem I have is with the lady upfront..she is quite rude on the phone and in person..if the pizza wasn't good I wouldn't return but I like it..she needs to have a better attitude.   If you don't like where you work work elsewhere..there's no need to be rude.."}
{"text":"Tried this place with my boyfriend, got pizza, wings and fried pickles. The pizza was pretty good, no complaints. The wings were absolutely fantastic. The fried pickles however were pretty soggy and I ended up peeling the breading off and just eating the pickles. We ate so much food, we got stomach aches, haha! I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Tried it for the 1st time tonight.  Kids and I loved it!  Pizza was amazing as were the garlic knots.  I also ordered the Greek salad...yum!!!  For $24 I fed my family and had leftovers.  Can't beat that!!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place.  The pizza actually is the best you can get in this area if you are out of delivery range for La Famiglia.  A great NY style pizza with a twisted, thick, doughy end crust.  That is atypical for a NY pizza, but I really like it.  My favorite other dishes (so far) are the fried pickles (omg they are so addictive) and their chef salad is like nothing you'd expect from pizza delivery places.  The ingredients are fresh and delicious and the presentation is laid out like a proper restaurant and not just thrown together in a fast paced who-gives-a-f#@! pizza kitchen.  Even though they are just fried dough, the Berry Bites are really tasty.  I do wish they had more dessert options, but the little fried dough balls topped with icing and berry sauce hits the spot when you're wanting something sweet after dinner.  Their wings are also pretty good with a nice variety of flavors.    I plan on trying more things eventually but I just can't stop eating the pizza and pickles for now.  If these guys ever offered sandwiches and a few more desserts, I'd probably never have to order from anywhere else ever again."}
{"text":"This restaurant is fine. Pizza taste good enough. There is just one huge issue. Every time I order from there (Including tonight) they call and cancel your order. This has happened 5 times. Only had them successfully deliver to me 3 times. That's not the best way to run a business."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza in Chandler.  We now only order our pizzas from this Mom and Pop shop   Fast delivery,  love the 87 Supreme.   Support this local pizzeria,  you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Wings are pretty good, haven't tried the pizza yet. I did call for delivery an hour before they closed and was put on hold to 'see if we're still taking delivery orders'. When she came back on I was asked where I live. So, not exactly impressive service.. I decided to just drive up there to pick up my food. The wings were good, so they def have that going for them. The woman at the counter was very friendly when I showed up for my take-out as well.   1. Good wings 2. Delivery may or may not be an option  I'd def go back though, the wings are above average."}
{"text":"Pizza on 87 is a great local pizza place.  Every time we order, the pizza is delicious and the customer service is great.  The pizza is similar to NYPD but better.  It has become our favorite spot for pizza day.  We love the pizza, wings and sides, usually fried pickles.    They use great ingredients for the bread/crust, cheese and sauce.  Their toppings are great including our favorites: pepperoni, bacon, olives, mushrooms and veggies, the only topping we didn't like was the sausage but it was just medium compared to all the other toppings. The crust is soft, like a garlic bread knot without the garlic. The cheese is tasty and the toppings are top notch. The pizza has great hold up value into next day if needed. The wings are good and priced well.  If you like good sides nearly all their sides are good, we dig the fair food like fried pickles. The berry bites are also a kid favorite.  The customer service is great, we have gotten them almost 10 times now and there has not been one mixup, we usually order directly. When we get delivery, best part is the delivery is always organized and taken care of, no pizza sliding and always nice and hot. Pizza on 87 is one of those local establishments that just get it right on all measures.  Glad we gave Pizza on 87 a shot, it is our favorite pizza place now. You should try it out as well!"}
{"text":"Lackluster pizza at best...this is not a New York crust.  The wings were pretty good though."}
{"text":"This is such a great place! Randomly found it while browsing Yelp and I'm so glad we tried it! It's definitely a hole in the wall, but their pizza and wings are fantastic! Definitely a diamond in the rough! Everyone needs to try!"}
{"text":"This place is right down the street from us and we were looking for something quick and easy for dinner. The owner and staff are super friendly. We had our 5 year old with us so they gave her a paper plate to draw on (which they later hung up on the wall) and the chalkboard table was open so she was entertained with that, as well as watching the gentleman behind the window tossing and making the braided crust.  Pizza was delicious as was the beer in the chilled mason jar mugs.  We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in by accident. Live close by and never knew this place was here. Ordered the BIG A** slice of pizza. It is HUGE and tasty. The owner was very nice and friendly too. Girlfriend order just a pizza and that was good too. Will definitely be going back again."}
{"text":"Looks like I found me a new pizza spot.   Not only are the prices right but the pizza is amazing as well.   Very fast and super friendly service (for delivery).   Would highly recommend the garlic knots too they are delicious.   Do your self a favor and give this place a try you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Found this joint through Yelp! it was less than a mile away from our old house unbeknownst to us, so we had been traveling further for inferior pies, and stopped that after one visit here. Now, that we are in a different hood, we travel to them!   The Tuesday $5.99 Cheese Pie special is one of our favorite deals; truly a delicious steal! We also very much enjoy the aptly named Big Ass slice, and Big Ass calzone, one of each shared is more than enough to sate both of us, with leftovers to savor a couple of times over. The House and Greek salads are both good, inexpensive, and big enough to share.   The staff couldn't be friendlier or more accommodating, I like that you can watch your pies being made and fired through the window overlooking the ovens. Once we witnessed a customer a little late picking up her pizza, and the cook asked if she wouldn't mind waiting for another to be fired because it was no longer up to THEIR standards after sitting too long. Color me impressed!   We puffy heart you, Pizza on 87!   * the $5.99 cheese pie on Tuesday is the Bees Knees; Scott routinely smashes two slices in the car carrying it home *  ** clean, cute space, small patio, made to order food in \"pizza window\" **  *** the Big Ass Pie is a monstrous 28\" if you have a small army to feed ***  **** they serve beer, deliver, and have specials daily ****"}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza, sausage has a lot of flavor. Crust is delicious. The only thing I didn't like is that I left a $2 tip on the Eat 24 paper and the driver said he'd just call eat 24 for me no problem to add that. Eat 24 called me to verify the $3 tip...nice try guy!"}
{"text":"This is going to be our new go-to local pizza place! Their pizza was yummy and so were their boneless chicken. We ordered the supreme, 6 boneless honey bbq and 6 boneless sweet chili! It was made in a timely manner and we decided to take it out. The person on the phone even informed us that they also offer delivery. GREAT news because we assumed it wasn't an option!  Our boneless chicken was nice and crisp, drenched with yummy delicious sauces. My boyfriend and I love the extra sauce they added just because we live dipping our pizzas in there. The pizza was so beautiful with all the generous amounts of toppings. Only down side is, I am allergic to olives and we requested no olives, and it was covered in it. That was ok because I was able to enjoy the crust and the boneless wings, however, I would probably love to try the pizza. We will try again though! The boyfriend said it was perfectly cooked and the dough was pretty darn good. It wasn't too thin and not too much.   Overall, I love chicken. And their chicken was GOOD. Will try again though. Since we were so hungry we didn't feel like complaining."}
{"text":"Great people and good pizza. It is super thin crust with tons of flavor. Our only issue is that after two times of bringing home a large pie with everything on it, it is soggy.  I'm not sure if they are using frozen toppings or what but about 3 inches of the center of the pizza is soggy and watery. Taste is great, if you can get past that.  The garlic knots are tasty but a little bready. I would love to have the garlic butter baked into the knot but they are good.  Sadly, I don't think we'll be back due to the sogginess."}
{"text":"Good choice for some NY pizza, and I love that they have green chile available for a topping."}
{"text":"I wish there was a big menu to look at when you walked in. But besides that, the $8 pizza-wings-drink was a good deal. Got a pepperoni slice and 5 honey hot bone-in wings, both were delicious. The \"big ass slice\" is appropriately big and also crispy. I didn't have to wait long before my food was out. I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"We got it delivered and the food was horrible. It even smelt bad and didnt look appetizing at all! I was so disappointed!"}
{"text":"Take it from a New Yorker....This place is GREAT!!!  The Big Azz slice is like two slices of goodness.  They have salads and garlic knots but it's the \"back East\" Pizza that's the star!!  Nothing like finding a little \"slice\" of home way out here!!  If you think you'll find better pizza FUGGEDABOUDIT!!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza! Saw a piece at the shop when I picked up my bike... It looked awesome... I found the place and it was!!!   Just don't pull into the lot with a trailer, it's tight.   Second time in... It's still awesome!!!"}
{"text":"These guys are above and beyond every food joint I've ever seen in 58 years of eating. Food is exceptional and the service is unbeatable."}
{"text":"I would recommend this place if you're looking for something new. The pizza is delicious. The slices are huge. The staff is friendly. The atmosphere is calm."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now, and both times have been awesome. Got the \"Big Ass Slice\" and a domestic pint of beer for $5.99. The slice is as big as your head! Seriously a great deal.  They use fresh mushrooms! Yay! A lot of pizza places use nasty canned mushrooms, which are rubbery. The pizza thickness is thinner, but it's crispy and not soggy at all...just how I like it.  The joint is smaller inside, but that's what makes it special. Staff is super friendly and you can tell they care about what they put out. They do pizza and they do it well.   Will be back often. Great job guys, keep it up!"}
{"text":"We tried them because they delivered. It was fantastic. Our new go to pizza delivery place. The pizza was fresh, the sauce was subtle and the different options were good. We cannot wait to order again."}
{"text":"We got take out today, the delivery man was really nice and he was really enthusiastic about the product. He was not wrong the pizza was amazing! Even the twisted crust which just showed that they took pride in their work. The wings!!!!! WOW!!! The were out this world! The garlic knots were so moreish I had to restrain myself.   It's nice to see a local business beating back big chain restaurants.   Bottom line if you like good pizza and you support local business then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Got takeout here the other day and was not disappointed! Ordered a large pizza w/ bacon and garlic knots. The bacon on the pizza was actual cut pieces of bacon as opposed to other places that would just use bacon bits. The garlic knots were pretty spot on too.  Will definitely be back! I'll probably try their other toppings by the soccer next time I'm here."}
{"text":"Ordered online through the Yelp App, worked to perfection! Took about 45 minutes but the food was delicious. Ordered a chef salad and some mozzarella sticks. Would order from here again!"}
{"text":"This place is super amazing. Wings n pizza are bomb.com. I freakin love this place. N most importantly the staff is GREAT! Forget about long wongs and every other pizza place. Oh n they play 90s music!!"}
{"text":"Love at first bite!! We've only just had the pizza and boneless wings but that's what we go back for every time! I most definitely would tell you to try this spot!! Love the fact that it's a family owned business and not a corporate place. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"A solid hole-in-the wall pizza place. They make their own sauce every day! If you want no frills, tasty greasy pizza come here."}
{"text":"Awesome place, good food and great service. Dennis is the best, he cares about his customers and always takes care of us."}
{"text":"I have been a long-term customer. I recently have decided that I can no longer order from pizza on 87. Tonight I ordered a pizza with three extra toppings. When  it arrived none of the toppings were on the pizza. I was charged $1.50 for each of the three toppings.  I called and spoke to Tracy to let them know what happened. I told her that I was going to eat the pizza and that I just wanted to let her know what was going on. Tracy said that yelp did not transmit the extra toppings and if I had an issue that I needed to call yelp. Yelp is not who I ordered from. They are just an intermediary that supports online ordering. They are their vendor and I am sure yelp charges them for the service . I don't see why I should have to call yelp and waste my valuable time when they are paying for a service. In the end regardless of where the failure was I did not receive what I paid for.  This has been a consistent theme on three or more occasions so I let the person on the phone know that as a long-term customer I was disappointed and I will not be ordering from their establishment anymore. They should've called yelp themselves after they made it right with me. I wasn't asking for money. I wasn't asking for a new pizza. I just wanted to let them know what was going on. I feel that the response of you need to call yelp was unacceptable.  Attached is a picture of the receipt and pizza."}
{"text":"Well i was visiting AZ and i wanted a good pizza joint and wings. The pizza was ok and the wings were good. I hot a bad vibe when i waled in the door and the 3 employees that were there continued to have their bicker back and forth conversation while i stood there at the counter for 5 min. I looked at each of them and still got no response. When the lady that seemes to be higher up finally asked if i need help i got it eith little respect. Even after we placed a 135.00 order. Asked for cheese and peppers and i got 5 packs of each for a big ass 28in pizza. Never will i go there again. Customer service comes first. Meanwhile my food was sitting on top of the oven getting cold while they had there little argument"}
{"text":"Recently a friend suggested delivery to our office from Pizza on 87. We ordered a pepperoni pizza and wings, both were delicious and hot! Today we have our daughter and her friend over so for lunch we figured we'd try Pizza on 87 again! We ordered the white pizza with bacon and onions (as it comes), sooo good, and you could feel your belly growing (isn't that what pizza does to you?!). We also ordered a pepperoni pizza with black olives. This place does NOT skimp on toppings which is unusual for a pizza spot. The garlic knots are the real deal too and oh so garlicky doughy. I'd show a photo but we don't share how much pizza we consumed in one sitting! :)"}
{"text":"Decent pizza. Prices are ok. I have order several times. Moved here from the East coast recently and born and raised on New Haven pizza which is rated best in the US. So for me to say it's decent pizza is telling you something. I just wish they would change their sausage. It has a funny taste but my husband likes it."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza in the valley! Great food...great staff... great service! I always come in and get the slice, wings and drink combo. Fills me up on my lunch break. I would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best white pie I have ever had. The co-owner Heath is a stand up guy with excellent hospitality. Definitely worth a look. First time customers and was very very very impressed! Also, try their honey bites!"}
{"text":"I ordered with a coupon to find out the coupon only worked on nfl game days but lucky me i was talking to the owner Dennis whom still gave me the deal :) yumm yumm pizza is delicious. Thanks Dennis!! Ill be ordering again soon!!"}
{"text":"So I've ordered from here a few times. 2 out of 3 times the pizza was wrong, and the third time it had a burnt bottom.    So why the 4 star rating?   Well...   1-The pizza tastes pretty good. Thats obviously one of the most important qualities in a pizza restaurant.   2-The people are super nice. Both times they have apologized and offered to fix the mistake. Once I told them not to worry as it was just 1 topping missing. The 2nd time they let me munch on a slice of the mistake pizza while I waited for the correct one. They even offered me a beverage while I waited.   3-The toppings are fresh and they give you enough toppings (unlike some chain bargain pizza joints).   I know most people wouldn't give a 4 star rating when their food has had something wrong with it most of the time. However, I get a good vibe so far and I understand that things happen."}
{"text":"I had a flyer on my door when I got home and decided immediately that I would give Pizza on 87 a chance!  The pizza, garlic knots, and the fried zucchini were amazing!  I definitely suggest you give them a try! Very prompt delivery too!!"}
{"text":"I only work a few miles from this location so I decided to give it a try. It is your typical premade pies that are refired with your chosen toppings.   I opted for garlic, ricotta, and artichoke hearts.  The garlic was delicious, but I would have preferred to see more of the atrichoke hearts, not so much the leafy part.  As for the ricotta, I found it but it tool a bit of hunting.  The slice is very large and thin but held up nicely with a crispy bottom.   I really liked the outside crust which is brushed with a delicious garlic butter. While this may not be the pizza to write home about, I will certainly be back.  Who can beat a fast, cheap, and near by lunch.  It was quite busy when I entered but I had immediate service and great customer service.      I did take a moment to check out the ladies room and was very pleased to see it was in great condition."}
{"text":"Fabulous, Friendly, Incredibly affordable, charming & Delicious are not enough adjectives to describe this little Gem near downtown Chandler!! My son and I got two slices of pizza which could of fed 4 people and a salad ... I actually told the owner to raise the prices ... It was a joy and delight & each employee was nicer than the next!! Please tell your friends.... Selfishly I want this place to be here forever!! Cheers"}
{"text":"Tried this place on a whim, wanted to try a new pizza place and found this one online. Was not disappointed. Staff is friendly and fun, pizza and garlic knots were excellent.  This is now top of the list of pizza places to go back to. Crust has right thickness and cooked perfectly. Knots were buttery and had great flavor. Not overbearing or smothered in garlic."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza. Ordered the 14\" pepperoni, mushroom and Jalapeños. And 6 hot wings with awesome sauce. Pizza and wings hot after a hour 15 min. Oh! Man the best Ranch dressing I ever had! Homemade in house!! The Bomb!!"}
{"text":"Great food! Very clean. Friendly people. Cashier  was very friendly and so accommodating checked on us several times. Besides the pizza being so good  the chicken wings were very tasty and the fried zucchini is the best I've ever tasted! Nice to be able to eat good food and watch the ballgame! Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Pizza was good.  The butter in the main crust was very flavorful.    Mango wings were good and cooked thoroughly.  Beautiful set up for watching The game. Two dollar drinks on Thursday a plus.   Great staff  everyone was nice.  Probably go when they are offering a special. As being my first pizza experience in the area overall it was good.  5 stars to the staff."}
{"text":"Pizza 87 is on my regular lunch circuit. They have a great NY style pizza and a drink for around $5.50. This slice is called the Big A$$ slice and will fill you up. Another nice touch is they give you a pizza cutting wheel with your slice so you can cut smaller pieces of that beastly slice. All you need is one slice at this place unless you are a total chow hound."}
{"text":"Quick delivery but probably the worst pizza I have had in a long time.  Garlic knots were not anything special, and even the fried zucchini wasn't good... I didn't know you could have bad fried zucchini!"}
{"text":"Wow! What a great slice. The very best buffalo wings we have EVER had! Service was outstanding we are new to the area and hav finally found our pizza home. Young lady and staff so helpful and accommodating. These slices are like three normal portions of pizza. Had the Big Ass slice 5 buffalo wings and s drink for 8.99 each! Twenty bucks for two and we could not finish our pizza and doggy bagged it for tomorrow's lunch."}
{"text":"So looking forward to trying this place but the girl on the phone was so extremely rude I know I will not try again. There are too many pizza places to pick from for you to be rude"}
{"text":"Found this newly opened pizza place today.  If you want great tasting, HUGE portion sizes and great prices, then this is the place for you!  Garlic knots for an appetizer ... YUM!  We had a slice ... it came with it's own pizza cutter that's how big it was!  Also had massive calzones stuffed with whatever you wanted.  Didn't get to try any of their salads but will on our next trip.    Definitely recommend this place.  Oh and the owner is hilarious which makes it even better."}
{"text":"We like to seek out and try local, non-chain pizza. That's what we found here. Really nice folks, great pizza. We had drinks while we waited for takeout but you can eat there as well. They have a lot of specials!"}
{"text":"So, we are new to the Phoenix area. We actually live in Chandler. I go to Yelp before we eat anywhere because I have never been let down by doing so. This experience was no exception. We were having a birthday party for a 5 year old and I needed pizza. I pull up Yelp and this looked good so I called. I was informed the had a 28 inch pizza. Im going to be honest, it really did not click in my head how big that was. It sounded fun so I ordered it. We get to the restaurant and they ask if my trunk is open. I said no, it fill fit in my back seat. They kind of smiled and then brought out my pizza. WOW, it was big. It was not going to fit in the back seat of my Dodge Charger. Lol. We got the pizza home and it was a conversation piece for a good 15 minutes. When we actually tried it, it had a great chewy crust, lots of pepperoni and cheese and the sauce was just perfect. It is a very small space with just a few tables. I am assuming the do mostly take out. Everyone was very nice. Everyone enjoyed it and we will be back."}
{"text":"I am a fan. I am a pizza snob, as most people who come from Chicago are. I really enjoyed the pizza here, it was flavorful and reasonably priced. The wings were soooo good. They were not skimpy like how other establishments have them. I definitley will be returning. The owner is super friendly every time you call."}
{"text":"We are so glad a new local pizza place opened so close to our house! We have ordered delivery from here numerous times now. The pizza always comes very hot and delivered very quickly. We have also tried the cheese bread and garlic knots, both very good. They are always very friendly when taking my order. Have not been into their actual store, but I can say their delivery service is superb."}
{"text":"The slices are exceptionally large, and high quality. Definitely greasy, but that's nothing a napkin (or ~5 napkins, in my case) can't fix. Also got an order of the honey bites, which (as was the case with the pizza) ended up being quite sizable. Excellent consistency; absolutely no complaints. Really good service, too."}
{"text":"Okay pizza and wings but very great prices.  Garlic knots were delicious.  Quick service.  They have a lot of specials that were nicely priced."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, we tried this place about 6-7 weeks ago and since then we have been back 4-5 times. The wings and pizza are awesome. Everyone inside is friendly and always have a smile on their face."}
{"text":"I was going to post about how much i loved this place but then i started thinking about all of the weird moments I've had that overruled the great specials they used to have. Once I've called in and there was a really creepy guy that would keep calling me back on my cell phone trying to talk to me and a lady maybe the owner or something is beyond rude and makes excuses as to why she needs to be rude. After tonight i can't say I'll ever go back. They had the best garlic knots but it's not worth the type of service they are okay with putting out there. There's too many pizza places to try and find better service.   We have a flyer from Pizza On 87 that did not have any expiration date on their specials. One stated Friday's and Saturday's that you could get an add on to your pizza order for a appetizer for 3.99 and they won't honor it. I almost wanted to run over there and show that to them which I'll just take a picture and post. I hope the owners read this so they can possibly change their attitudes so they are aware of the type of employees they hire is going hurt their business. I don't even care if they went out of business. I am beyond baffled with how this woman spoke over the phone. I am beyond livid. My fiancées friend was even like omg that woman sounded like a \"B\" everyone in the room could hear her mannerism and it was beyond disgusting if i knew her name i would have posted that along with our review."}
{"text":"Came here with my husband tonight. Pizza was great, wings were great too. But, we ordered a large \"house salad\" and it wasn't what we were expecting. It was like a big bag of leafy greens from the grocery store with shredded mozzarella cheese and olives on top. ( not your typical house salad). We were expecting crisp lettuce with carrots, cucumbers, tomatoes, croutons, etc.  Service was great though, very friendly!"}
{"text":"This place is yummy! The entire family liked everything we ordered. Also very reasonable prices!!!"}
{"text":"I just ordered a pizza and wings from this Horrible place!!!!!!! Saw these misleading reviews and decided to order. Worst decision I have ever made in my life. They literally just delivered the food 20 minutes ago. When my husband put the food on the counter I yelled at him what is that funky smell. It smelled like dog crap. You know the funky smell when meat goes bad. The wings were old as heck!!!!! The pizza was burnt on the bottom and lifeless. As a former Chicago girl I try not to judge so harshly but this pizza and wings and establishment is garbage. I'm so upset because my kids were hungry and one of my kids ate a wing and his tummy is upset. My husband was so pissed he dropped their burnt pizza and soiled wings off to them and got our money back. We ordered Rosatis Pizza by the way and it was so fresh and not burnt. My Friday night ended up with funky food and a trip to Walgreen's for ginger ale and medicine for a kids sour tummy. This place needs to be checked by the health inspector asap. I will be making that complaint. I don't want any other kids or families getting sick off this crap!! The one star is for them owning up to their crap and giving us our money back and not our tip."}
{"text":"The Lite Rail has Main Street so torn up near my All Time Favorite pizza joint (L.J.'s) that I had to change tacks and venture out beyond delivery boundaries for new and exciting pizza today.  I saw the # of positive reviews and called up PO87. Just the phone call was memorably pleasant. Thank you nice person on the phone. You were also probably the nice person who rang me up and handed me my order. Thank you nice person. Nice. Nice. Nice.  I got a 16\"  1/2 Pep/Saus/Jala -  1/2 Ham/Pine and 10 Hot Bone-in wings Extra-crispy  Now the extra crispy didn't work out. Perhaps that's on me, I'll be more emphatic with my next order.   Seems I live in a house divided on the pizza.   I liked it quite a bit. Dig the whole affair and the crust was ... well ... fun. So Tasty & Fun, I'm going that way.  //Preparing Neener-neener mechanism for (int expHappinessCntr=0;expHappinessCntr &lt; 1000;expHappinessCntr++)  {     System.out.println(\"Damn that was good pizza!\n\n\");  }  Queue the Empire March--  Darcie felt it lacked flavor. What does she know? She can get her own damn Yelp account.   Yeah, well I was gonna go 3 but now I'm goin' 4 STARS. No! No, I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt on the texture of the wings.  Hey! Neither Chris Pine nor Tom Hanks is at the door, so you go put that suitcase away. ...Honey?"}
{"text":"How have I missed this place for almost two years? I work in downtown Chandler on the square and usually get pulled in to all the food available within walking distance.  I also like to get out for lunch and check out new places within short drives. I mean, my favorite candy store is only a mile away from this place and I have driven right past it numerous times without ever noticing.  Today, that all changed, and dang if I'm not upset it has taken me this long to discover this nice little hidden gem! Ordered the lunch special, big slice (pepperoni), salad, and drink to go. Took it back to the office, opened the box and was almost dumbfounded by what they call a slice of pizza, and I mean this in a good way. It's not called a big @$$ slice for nothin'! Darn almost needed two tables to hold it. :)  On top of that, the pizza was awesome. I'm a simple meat and potatoes type of guy, so simple cheese and pep pizzas are difficult to cover up a bad pizza with a bunch or random toppings. This pie was spot on in my book. Very fresh, tasty ingredients, with great crust.   It's a small humble looking building, no frills, well worn and cozy inside. My kind of joint, no need to distract me with fancy decor when all the only thing that needs to be impressed is my tastebuds.   I'm pretty thrilled to have this so close to work for my lunchtime pizza cravings. I only wished I lived near Chandler now. I shall return! Multiple times!"}
{"text":"I was at uhaul getting a trailer hitch installed and walked into this place just hoping to get some food. Great service and the pizza is really good, I got a slice special and the slices are so big they give you a pizza cutter. They have their own beer on tap for like $2, very worth it. Not a very big place and location isn't the greatest but great bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Really yummy pizza the big a$$ slice is definitely filling  garlic knots were soo good and their homemade chips are soo yummy! Loved this place!"}
{"text":"First time ordering from here.  The pizza arrived earlier than quoted. The flavor was good but unfortunately all 5 of the toppings slid to one side of the pizza (some spilling over onto the box) leaving the other half with just the crust and sauce."}
{"text":"Awesome place to stop by for some lunch. I go in there often and I always get their big slice with 5 wings with a fountain drink. For what we pay its Amazing, huge pepperoni slice, and the sweet red chili wings have to be the best wings in town.  Even the pizza crust is good because its basically a long  garlic knot.  Keep up the good work, Thank you."}
{"text":"The woman on the phone is extrememly RUDE. TERRIBLE customer service. the pizza was grossly undercooked, had to eat with a fork. if you picked up a slice, all the toppings slid off. expected better pizza for the high prices. ordered wings, they were mediocre. and DID NOT come with any ranch. I requested extra ranch, and never got it. then I got a RUDE voice-mail. from a very condescending employee. TERRIBLE customer service. and they do not update when the delivery will arrive. simply....  it could have been better. I was quite upset that the 12 wings came with NO dressing/dipping sauces. shameful"}
{"text":"Delicious, New York-style slices served all day. The crust is both soft and perfectly crispy at the same time, with a garlic knotted edge. Sauce is tasty, but I'd prefer a little more, maybe on the side for dipping.   Their 'Big Ass Slice' is a great value, as it's probably the size of three normal slices. Tuesday deals for regular one-topping pizzas is a steal. Why would you ever buy a luke-warm Little Caesar's pizza that tastes like cardboard, or a frozen pizza, when you could eat here for a buck or two more? Plus, they even have craft beer on tap, and a nice little patio out front.   I live right around the corner and can't believe I just discovered this place. It's hard to find good New York style pizza in Chandler. Definitely going to become a regular. I've eaten here twice in the past two weeks and both times the staff were very friendly and enthusiastic. That goes a long way.   Overall a pleasant surprise given the location. Pizza on 87 is a fantastic little hole-in-the-wall gem."}
{"text":"Love ordering from this place.  Food typically arrives in under 30 mins.  Pizza and toppings are delicious - my new go-to for delivery ."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Pizza is great, wings are at a great price and fresh salad! Glad I found this place on yelp!"}
{"text":"This pizza is humongous and just absolutely the best! I love this pizza joint! I can't wait to try the giant calzone next. The people who work here are incredibly nice! I recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"I had this one bookmarked for a while!  I wanted pizza and this place finally came to mind. Not gonna lie, it was a little difficult to find this place due to having some many small businesses in the building neighboring it etc. So I added a pic for reference. First impressions: It looks kind of like a hole-in-the-wall place.   However, the food was actually surprisingly good. Its kind of like NY style pizza. The slice is pretty thin itself, but the crust is super doughy. Definitely greasy good pizza here though.   Inside was pretty small. Seating was limited, however there were about 5-6 good sized TVs with sports on. I thought this was cool. It shows that they are actually utilizing the space that they have!   Customer service 4/5 Restaurant cleanliness 4/5 Food quality 4/5 Value 5/5"}
{"text":"Ingredients taste like they came out of a freezer.  Sausage didn't taste fresh or like sausage.  Crust was good, but too perfect to be fresh.  We ordered a side of jalapeño ranch that wasn't delivered, but they charged us for it.  The corn bites are very good.  The garlic rolls were just ok.  Very disappointed.  We waited over an hour for it to be delivered.  I would not order pizza from here again."}
{"text":"Yesterday I ordered two pizzas and mozzarella sticks from Pizza on 87 and had it delivered via Grub Hub. The mozzarella sticks tasted great as expected, and the pizza was thin and delicious. I especially appreciate Pizza on 87 for using real mozzarella. The only thing the others eating it with me pointed out was, how easily the cheese fell off the slice, and how the pizza wasn't sliced well. Regardless, they enjoyed the pizza as did I."}
{"text":"The staff here is super friendly and I love the local feel to this place. It is small but we usually order to go. Pizza and wings are a great price and serving sizes are good size. They always have our pizza ready for pick up when they say they will (which is usually just 15-20 minutes)."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza and calzones! Pizzas have a thick Brady braided crust and are delicious. Hole in the wall place that I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Honestly the best pizza every by the slice is the way to go for lunch. Omg I'm n heaven."}
{"text":"Bomb food and friendly staff!!! This is such a great local shop! I have never been disappointed leaving here."}
{"text":"Pizza is huge and it was really good. Nice small place to pop in.  I will be back!! I gave it a 4 because it was really good but if it was more retardant style I would have given it a 5!!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery using online ordering on Yelp. Let me add I did it on my iPhone and found the process simple and quick. Few clicks and it was on its way. Also love the cash option so I didn't have to fumble with a credit card. Checked my email to verify the order and delivery address was correct.  Came quick I didn't time it but pretty sure it was not over 30 minutes. The guy knocked on the door cause our bell is broke. He had crutches. More power to him.  Food was hot and tasty. We had 18\" cheese pie and mild wings. I generally don't like chicken but it had a nice flavor as did the pizza. The crust was like garlic knots which is an added bonus. I would have loved cheese in the crust.  Very impressive experience."}
{"text":"Always a fantastic experience when we come. So worth the money and the drive from Phoenix. Everybody's so kind, great service and amazing flavors. The wings, pizza, salad..Everything's perfect. The prices are great for the big ass pizza slices they give you. Definitely one of my favorite place to eat in chandler."}
{"text":"Had pizza from here for the first time last night.  It was an average experience.  The pizza was pretty flavorful, but it was real greasy (meat lovers).  I understand a little grease but it was so bad it was affecting the crust.  My girlfriend had a cheese pizza and the cheese fell right off when she grabbed a slice.  Delivery came about 30 minutes sooner than it said online, which was a huge plus since I was starving.    Not sure if we would get the pizza again, maybe try the wings next time."}
{"text":"100% order big ass slices over normal pizza mozzarella sticks were amazing me and bf put down 3 orders!!!"}
{"text":"Top notch customer service. Small place but that's usually a sign of great food! Great meat specialty pizza. I got a 18\" pizza. Teriyaki boneless wings were good as well!"}
{"text":"Big pizza, a bit disappointing didn't seem to have much flavor,  garlic knots didn't have much flavor as well.  Mushrooms and fried zucchini we amazing, and the cheese bread were good as well.  The boneless wings were good too.  I would come back But I would add more garlic to the pizza.  However  the owner was amazing as well.  Very very nice gentelmen"}
{"text":"Pizza on 87. My man is a pizza lover . We ordered them one night and it was delievered pretty fast. The pizza and wings were great. It was very new york style ,thin foldable,peperoni was crispy. Very good! The 87 salad was pretty solid . I'm a sucker for good honey mustard which is something they have."}
{"text":"This is my second favorite pizza place in the east valley! It's nothing fancy, but the pizza is made in a window where diners can watch and the food is just yummy! They have a plethora of toppings and the rolled crust is just awesome.  The pizza is flavorful but not too salty.  Along with that the honey bites were amazing, they're wings look tasty.  We didn't try them though.  Also staff was super helpful and nice, but genuine.  Decor is full of character!"}
{"text":"So, i just moved into chandler and I like to try new Pizza places around me. This had some interesting Yelp reviews, so I gave them a shot.  Pizza: Pizza was good. Not Great. Still better than the Papa John's of the world. It is quite thin, maybe a little light on the sauce, cheese fits the sauce well and the dough is good. My pizza came cooked pretty close to perfect.   Delivery: I am used to 1 hour+ delivery time from where I used to live, so I was pleasantly surprised with the 40 minute delivery time. Driver was nice and found my place easily.  Price: This is probably the biggest selling point for this place. It is Pizza that is better than chains, but priced around chain prices. Cant complain about that."}
{"text":"Pizza On 87 is just what my neighborhood needed.  A local business focused on keeping their customers delighted, and serving delicious pizza.    I've noticed the owner chat with every customer, which is nice. You can tell he's invested in making this place the best it can be.   I've watched this place transform the past couple of months, and it's been cool to see it go from just another building on Arizona Avenue to it's own unique feel.  Think licenses plates, pallets turned into seating, unique memorabilia.   They even have this table that's a chalkboard for all you folks with little ones to keep entertained when dining out.   Never actually ate here; always take out. But I know I'll be coming back once the hot weather dies down to enjoy dinner on one of the high tops on the patio.   Draft beer? I'm in!   Pizza on 87 cuts no corners. It's clear that the ingredients are incredibly fresh, and you can assume this is not frozen dough or industrially-canned sauces. The crust practically melts in your mouth.   They're also affordable. One of the great specials is $10.87 for a Large Pepperoni Pizza and some Garlic Knots.   Can we talk about those garlic knots?! So buttery and delicious, real chopped garlic and not garlic salt.   I only get them if I know we're having friends over for fear of committing carbicide!  Whether it's Pizza/Wine/Yoga Pants/Netflix night, or you're just seeking delicious pizza, check out this place out.   I hope Pizza on 87 sticks around for a long time."}
{"text":"Really good pizza! And inexpensive!   The pizzas were fresh and tasted so much more homemade vs chain restaurants. The garlic knots and fried pickles were tasty too.   The kids played on the chalkboard table and watched them make pizzas in the window behind our seats.  So it was easy to keep them entertained.   We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Last night I searched \"Delivery near Chandler, AZ\" on Yelp and I found Pizza On 87. Even though I live only half a mile from this place, I had never heard of it. The reviews intrigued me, so I decided to place an order. I originally ordered only a large pepperoni pizza with garlic knots, but ended up also ordering fried zucchini and a 2 liter in order to reach the delivery minimum (which is $15 but isn't mentioned on their website). The VERY nice man who took my order said that delivery would take at least an hour, which I was fine with. Delivery ended up taking about 75 minutes. The delivery kid was a doll and super sweet. Although it took 75 minutes, it was truly well worth the wait. The food was AWESOME! Since the menu is lower priced, I really wasn't expecting the food to be very good. I was pleasantly surprised! I'm really looking forward to my next Pizza On 87 experience! Thanks for the excellent food and customer service!"}
{"text":"This is probably the best NY style pizza i've had outside of the east coast. My boyfriend's family of 10 came over and the only sensible option for a party that large is pizza, and this place is right down the street. We ordered it for delivery and it came promptly in 30 minutes like they said. Greasy, cheesy and it had a fluffy crust. Highly recommended. I will check out the actual restaurant next time I have a pizza craving!"}
{"text":"This was the best pizza in Chandler. The guys working were very helpful, and even remembered our names the entire time we were there. We had pizza, wings, and a calzone for our large family, and when we left about an hour later they called us by name and said good night. The pizza slice special I have had on carry out before and it is a huge slice, wings, and a drink for about $7. Any time I want pizza from now on, this is where I will go."}
{"text":"While I love supporting non-chain restaurants, and especially Pizza places, this is nothing special. The \"The Meat\" pizza was ok but nothing more (esp at $18.97 pre tax).  Garlic knots are bready, tasteless and served with a teaspoon of marinara. Avoid.   Service is friendly.  However, for the prices they're charging they have a long way to go to compete with the others, including, Nello's, Spinatos, Barrio's and even Rosati's! All of which make a MUCH better pie."}
{"text":"Pizza on 87.. this is going to be weird but i dont care... this pizza gets my nipples hard... there, i said it. This is why Columbus came to America. If you dont love this pizza, then you support hitler"}
{"text":"This pizza is amazing!!! When I called to order I was initially going to go with the special which is a hell of a deal ( one topping pizza and garlic knots for less than 12$) however I wanted toppings! They guy I spoke to recommended the you pick 5 and it was outstanding!!! Price is completely affordable, it's the best pizza I have had in the valley thus far and I have tried many spots.  While on the phone he recommended the wings WOW... Sweet chili glaze OUTSTANDING WINGS!!!!! Thoroughly impressed with service, pizza, and wings were amazing.  The only item that is lacking is the website, there isn't enough information to adequately order your pizza... They apparently have some house pick pizzas but they aren't on the menu... ADD it guys!!!! This is an absolute repeat, and great addition to Chandler."}
{"text":"This is the the best pizza in town. Fresh homemade custom pizza....with good crust. I don't usually eat the crust but this crust....forget about it!   It's a small spot that's locally owned. They have indoor and outdoor seating. TVs are available for watching games or whatever it is you watch and the staff is amazing. Always friendly and service is super fast. This place is is highly recommended. I hope you enjoy as much as I do."}
{"text":"Good pizza and good food for looking like a whole in the wall. You definitely get your fill of food."}
{"text":"Love Pizza On 87! Been here several times before and it's always been delicious and at a good price. The main specialty is a large slice of pizza and some sort of side!   My favorite is a giant slice of pizza, house side salad (deliciously great salad), and a drink! You can't beat it!   If you haven't tried this place before expect a fully loaded slice of pizza with plenty of your topping of choice and cheese! He crust is braided with garlic and is full and fluffy - it's not a normal crust bland crust.   Seriously, you've gotta try this place."}
{"text":"Very nice service, down to earth and humble guy who took our order and served our food, he might of made them and he might be the owner who cares! Because the pizza is so good, hot, big and fresh! Every business should be running like Pizza On 87!"}
{"text":"I like Pizza on 87 a lot! The big slice is delicious and the owners are very friendly! The owners seemed to care about all their customers which is invaluable. A quick date site for us for sure!"}
{"text":"Wanted pizza and saw the other reviews and this looked like the place for me. Called and order and was told 20 mins. Went ahead and left house and got their in 10 mins wanted 5 and it was ready. Got home opened up and it was all huge portion. The pizza was good the garlic knots were awesome a little lite on dipping sauce and the honey balls were huge and awesome. Thanks will be back."}
{"text":"Hello fellow foodies ....  I am not sure why it says *** ordered online***... I tried but it never confirmed order so I called the store to confirm it went through and confirm order.  I will start with the positives...  Close to home! Great wings ... Nice and meaty and yummy choices of sauces... Always delivered hot!  Now on to the pizza... The first experience back when they opened we shared wings and a big ass slice... And that it was!  The pizza slice was tasty but nothing great.  The small pieces of sausages have barely any taste... The pepperoni is pepperoni... Nothing special... Not enough cheese  We have tried their pizza 4 times now and couldn't quite decide if we really liked it... We mostly went back for the wings.  Couple night ago we ordered a pizza that had sausage,pepperoni.. Peppers and black olives.  Pizza was NOT HOT... And they are only located a mile from me... Or less!  We picked up a slice and everything slid off the limp crust!  Neither of us finished one slice and the whole pizza went in the trash!  If you have ever read my reviews you know that I am fair yet honest and I DETEST spending good money on bad food!  It took an hour and 20 minutes to get our order but I understand they were busy...  I tried to call to tell them about our experience but the phone kept going to their fax machine which forced me to write this review before sharing my experience with them....  In the times I have gone in to pick up... Everyone was very friendly so it upsets me that we disliked their pizza so much.  Ya live... Ya learn  That's about it for this review... Stayed tuned for my next riveting review  Bon appetite'"}
{"text":"There's nothing like a refreshing beer and Delicious  pizza and wings after a long hard week with your husband. Great customer service, you feel like family here. Can't wait until my next pizza cheat day. I know my prego sis in law who's a huge pizza fan will love it at this place"}
{"text":"if I could get negative stars I would... pizza was soggy and didn't taste at all good cheese and toppings fell off pizza.....NEVER GOING BACK EVER!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place has been a hidden gem and I'm so glad I found it. The owner is super sweet and the food is wonderful! The BIG SLICE is an understatement! However, that and the wings are so delicious, it's definitely worth the effort to try and finish it, even though I get full half way through. I will definitely keep coming here."}
{"text":"Hands down one of our favorite pizza joints in the Valley. The only thing that stops us from going as much as we'd like is that we live about 20mins away. The pizza, wings, garlic knots, salads, and mozzarella sticks are all delicious and the prices really can't be beat. We stop by pretty much any time we are in Chandler and we always make sure to spread the word to family & friends looking for a good pizza joint at a good value."}
{"text":"Tonight will be a heavy collegiate study night, so we had an idea to order pizza from a new place; in an effort to broaden our small business support. Service was fast and accurate. Unfortunately, I found that I'm no fan of the sauce or the box taste of their crust. Visual presentation was great; the look of the pizza was beautiful -- only compromised by its ingredients. They also have an awesome & quaint little patio area that looks like it could comfortably accommodate 10+ friends and serve as a background for good memories should you dine in."}
{"text":"This place is the business. I ordered food from them at random a week or so ago and was really happily surprised at how good it was. The portions are gigantic and the price is perfect. Can't describe how highly enough I recommend checking this place out!"}
{"text":"I really like their pizza! The zucchini is great! Every time we're in the area and want pizza and wings this is where we go."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time today as did my girlfriend and nephews. Only reason I came here is because the place is well reviewed on Yelp. Pizza was really good, better than I expected. We ordered a house salad and a large pizza. One half of the pizza was pepperoni and the other half had pineapple. The pizza was piping hot with fresh ingredients. The salad was unlike other pizza shops in that it had fresh veggies and cheese and a spring mix, not just romaine lettuce. Another cool thing about this place is a window that lets you see the cooks make the pizza."}
{"text":"This place has excellent pizza and salads. Their prices are pretty good too. The building is pretty inconspicuous and I don't think it even has the name outside. Try it out!"}
{"text":"First time customer. Had single slice pizza, delicious crisp and garlic knots. Bargain prices, few seats inside or out but worth giving a try. Recommend ... Whodathunkit"}
{"text":"We found this little gem on Yelp because it was close by and sure glad we did. Pizza was awesome, salads were good, and the service was AMAZING. We will be back again!"}
{"text":"I ordered the XL Pizza and 20 Wings deal for pickup. The lady that took my order over the phone was kind, and when she checked me out at the shop she again displayed good customer service. I got home with my pizza and it looked great on the top, but when I picked it up I could see the bottom was very black. It wasn't burnt enough to make it inedible, and the flavor of the ingredients helped to get it down. The burnt taste did pervade the experience, and made the crust have a bad texture. It seemed like a well made pizza that they cooked too long, so I think I will give them one more shot. I'll post again if anything improves."}
{"text":"This place is right around the corner from my house and open late so it is always a temptingly convenient choice. The pizza is pretty meh, very greasy and nothing too special about it. The garlic knots I can definitely get down with, however the sauce served with them is also anticlimactic. The wings were cooked very nicely with a substantial amount of meat. Now I like my wings hot and saucey and in this aspect they did not disappoint! My mouth was on fire. Overall this is one of those places I will go to as a last result when nothing else is open or I don't want to venture too far."}
{"text":"I always get one slice and 5 wings. I also never finish because one slice is larger than my face lol. The pizza is lovely and delicious. I love the hometown feel of the spot too. Wing Wednesday's is the best! If it is your first time, come on a Wednesday! The salads are HUGE so order one and share. This last time I went with a co worker of home and we were served free desert. The berry bites are actually delicious. Almost like fair food."}
{"text":"We enjoy visiting this restaurant. I was introduced when my co-workers ordered lunch from here (again and again, and again), and have been hooked ever since.  My daughter and I particularly love the big a$$ slices of pizza, the garlic knots, the honey hot wings, the green salads, and the berry bites.  The eating areas are clean, and they have a decent patio section with flat screens if you'd prefer to sit outside and soak up some of AZ's nice weather during the winter months. The workers are always courteous and laid back.  Nice edition to our little neighborhood :)"}
{"text":"Love this place. Very reasonably priced for a large amount of food. They have great salads foo"}
{"text":"Really hard to find. Had to get something else to eat (because of my timing not there's) I called to let them know I would not be able to make it to pick it up and woman seemed fine on the phone. 2 min later a man called very upset with me asking what he wanted me to do with my order...??? I was taken back with how mad he was with me and apologized and said I wouldn't be able to come pick it up due to me having work and he asked my place of business?  I told him and said I was sorry again and then he hung up on me."}
{"text":"AWESOME FOOD, AMAZING STAFF!!! They have great specials and even offer delivery!!! We had the wings, pizza, garlic knots, and salad, it was all very good. Delicious food and very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Not enough sauce, cheese was like rubber, crust had no flavor. Won't be ordering again."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Great food and great prices! I come here every week with a few of my friends and weve never had a bad experience. Their slices are gigantic and always delicious and their garlic knots and berry bites are to die for! They also have great wings."}
{"text":"I found this place from browsing tripadvisor reviews. When they say they are home of the \"big ass slice\" they arent kidding the slices are 2x what most people consider to be a normal slice. They are thin crust but tasty and filling, don't try to eat two slices alone or you'll hurt yourself. The garlic knots are tasty too but share them! It's a nice lil spot right off of knox & arizona avenue that i've been driving past for years. They have license plates and old sports jerseys hanging up as well as a window to watch them cut the pizza and a tv as you sit in reused wooden booths."}
{"text":"We use to be regular customers here because we live across the street, less then a mile. The last time we had ordered delivery here, it was the worst experience. With a time estimate of 20 minutes.we waited 45 minutes until I called the place. Some guy answered the phone and she that she got might have gotten pulled over. Food shows up and the didn't give us the right order. We wanted 2 salads and cheese bread. We only got one salad. The condition of the food was horrible. The chicken in the salad had melted the cheese. So it was one huge clump of chicken and cheese. It was a huge disappointment. Won't ever be back"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to stop in for a while now after seeing Meagan B.'s excellent review.  Since I was on this pizza kick last week, I figured I might as well celebrate a nice long work week with a fresh hot pizza from Pizza on 87!  What a great little place!  As soon as you walk in, the smell of fresh ingredients and herbs hits you.  I was drooling before I could get to the register.  Not knowing what to expect, I got the jumbo pizza with twelve wings special.  The check-in offer at the moment was $2 off garlic knots so I got those and some fried pickles [I've always wanted to try the deep-fried snack] as well.  I figured I might as well try a little bit of everything.  Anyways, w-hoa!  Flavor explosion!  The crust is thin and crispy and they even knead it out in front of you behind a window at the shop.  It's flavorful and the twisted crust makes it feel like you're eating breadsticks.  We went with pepperoni for our one-topping so I really can't say too much on that.  The pizza was almost just as delicious right out of the fridge as it was when it was hot.  I didn't eat any wings since they were too spicy [Mr. W. is a fan of spice.  I'm more of a wuss].  The garlic knots... these were lovely.  They had chunks of garlic and were super buttery and soft.  The fried pickles went by much too fast but I think I'll pass on that next time.  I really wanted to try their Berry Bites!  All this food for only $30!  Wow!  Leftovers for days!"}
{"text":"Excellent fresh made enormous slices of pizza at a phenomenon price. Drafts for $2 and friendly service, you can't go wrong"}
{"text":"Absolutely not impressed at all. After all the hype  and a friend who swore it was great I have been totally disappointed. I thought the pizza was so so it has no sauce and the cheese was broken down with holes everywhere like was fake or over cooked. The only thing that was good and not great was the dough. The Garlic Knotts sucked and the wings were so so reminded me of Pizza Hut gross. The pizza tasted horrible. I won't be back, the pizza at Quick Trip is better."}
{"text":"Love the food and love the customer service the owner it very nice and very down to earth. Most importantly the food taste wonderful!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this restaurant after reading the reviews and I am always excited when restaurants partner with delivery apps! We ordered the white pizza, the salad, wings, & drink combo, and the garlic knots. They forgot my drink and ranch which I can generally get over. The garlic knots could use SERIOUSLY SO SO much more garlic. They taste very bland. The pizza was super greasy and stiff. The sauce was less than apparent. I am sure that this restaurant can deliver a better dish I just did not receive one."}
{"text":"Flavor: Good flavor. Cheese Pull: Slides off the crust. Crust: Twisted crust. Neat but nothing special than that it looks different. Price: Fair. Cold Test: Good. Next day test: Good.  Overall: It seems like the only reason why we and other seem to like the place isn't because of the pizza, it's for all the other things they have."}
{"text":"Great Price! New York style pizza! Recommend! Perfect place to order from for a birthday party or get together."}
{"text":"Ordered a large pepperoni, 24 wings half suicide half garlic Parmesan. Total was 34.00 decent price for everything including delivery. Overall everything was really good I'll definitely order from here again especially for the suicide wings with extra sauce"}
{"text":"Today I was well pleased with my lunch at this hole in the wall Pizza joint. I purchased a big ass slice and enjoyed the sauce, the cheese, and the crust. It was so huge that I was  not able to eat the entire thing. I tasted the crust some time later and it still maintained it crunch. I loathe soggy pizza. This was not it. I perused the order of an elderly gentleman's which was a salad. I think that will be my next purchase. It looked tasty."}
{"text":"This place surprised me. I had the slice/wings/soda combo.  The wings were surprisingly good (surprisingly b/c very few restaurants around AZ seems to know how to make good Buffalo Wings). These spent a few too many minutes in the fryer, but they were good sized, had good sauce. I liked 'em. I'll likely come back for a full order of those.  The pizza. Wow, be careful. The slice is freaking huge, so huge they bring a pizza slicer with it. The size was huge, but the flavor was a bit lacking -- more garlic! The italian sausage wasn't good. It's those little sausage balls, rather than good sliced sausage (or even chunky sausage like Chicago pizza). This was more like frozen pizza sausage. If you're in the mood for a slice and you're hungry, I'd still recommend this place. Just maybe go with pepperoni.  I ate in.  Good place. Friendly staff. There's a big window where you can watch the guy toss the pizzas. Nice surprise there on the 87 in Chandler."}
