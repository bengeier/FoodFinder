{"text":"Pizza can be a very personal taste, and this one was not to mine. The sauce was very light almost not even there and the crust was thick and doughy. I got the smoked meat pizza and there was a lot of good smoked meat on top and the cheese is good and there's lots of it. It's just not really my style--I like thin crisp brick oven style, thin, greasy and floppy NY style and deep dish with flakey crust. Just thick and doughy isn't my thing. Service was quick and friendly and the $18 pizza was enough for 3 and came with 2 cokes."}
{"text":"It's hard to believe that within a few blocks of \"Little Italy\",  you can't get a decent pie delievered. We ordered two, \"all dressed\"  which is basically pepperoni, green peppers and onions. Additional toppings are $5 a pop.   Delivery was fast so they get a point for that. Driver had a debit card reader which is nice, but they charge an additional \"fee\" to use it.   As for the pies themselves, they looked like plastic displays you might see in a glass cabinet. The kind they use to show you how wonderful their products are -  the same way an embalmer might show off his work. The toppings were paper-thin, and by paper-thin, I mean single-ply asswipe. We had one with sausage added and it tasted like a hot dog that had been boiled in old sock water. The whole thing was a greasy mess and it had a real foul odor.  Breaking into the dough was a bland, gooey white blob you might use to patch a leaky pipe. Oh and the grease? Half an inch deep of it, swirling around the box.  What's most shocking about this experience, as we sat speechless and looked at what they sent us, someone actually thinks this is edible or somehow desirable. For $45 I don't expect imported Calabrese peppers but a frozen pie out of a box would have been much more nutritious, tasty and at a fraction of the cost.  Pizzeria Villeray ties for first place as worst pizza ever."}
{"text":"The place is spot on, whenever me and my flat mate feel hungry, we order a nice pizza for a caloric blast. Food is pretty fresh even if it's fast food, you won't get that awkward feeling as if somebody raped your mouth with monosodium glutamate the next day."}
{"text":"A-Ok indeed! This is one of our go-to delivery places in the neighborhood for cheap good greasy pizza, subs, chicken wings, heart-attack-ilicious stuff like that. Just yer regular Quebecois casse-croute with that amazing Greek influence we are lucky to have in the mix.   The staff is that kind of totally amazing bilingual where you can't tell they speak English while they are speaking French and vice versa. Delivery is always fast and food is fresh, pizza crust is between thin and thick and it's light and tasty enough to reorder on those dark and wintery nights when you need the cheesy cheap eats."}
