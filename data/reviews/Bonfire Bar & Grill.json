{"text":"We went there for the Valentine's Day specials because we have had positive experiences at the Bonfire in the past. This was not one of them. First of all, I had to flag down a passing waitresses after 5 minutes or so because no one would wait on us. Then we found out the Valentine's specials only included an appetizer for one and not both of us. What's up with that? 

I ordered the sea bass and my wife ordered the filet mignon. Mine was pretty good but she thought the filet was a little small but not bad. I ordered the crepes suzette for dessert but it was so tough I could not cut it....even with a knife! On top of that, the server took my dinner fork, when the dessert came, I asked her for another fork. She never brought it! I had to ask another passing server for help. 

I hate to be negative but I doubt we will be back. It's a shame as we need good restaurants in Concord and we had high hopes for Bonfire."}
{"text":"We decided on a casual evening at a local restaurant and, having not tried Bonfire Bar & Grill before we thought it was a good time to give it a go.
We ordered loaded nachos as an appetizer - and asked for no chili.  Not 5 minutes later a massive plate of nachos appeared.  It was probably whole bag of tri-colored chips.  The cheese sauce was interesting.  It tasted like it had been cut with cream if that makes sense.  There was unmelted cheddar chese sprinkled on top.  Interesting.  Not bad, just not like nachos we've had before.
Husband ordered the fettucini alfredo with chicken.  His chicken was very, very dry and it tasted \"off\".  He didn't eat more than a few bites and didn't want me to try it.  His alfredo sauce was very heavy on butter.  The sauce broke in the bowl.  It was a new menu item so perhaps the chef is still working out the kinks.
I ordered the special.  It was a 7oz filet with bacon wrapped scallops, asparagus and potato wedges - all covered in a blueberry reduction.  This is where it gets interesting and confusing.  I ordered my steak medium rare.  It came perfectly cooked.  My scallops were perfectly cooked - the bacon on the outside wonderfully crisp. The potatoes were perfectly cooked - crispy on the outside - soft on the inside.  The asparagus - meh, it had been in a steamer for a while or something, not offensive but over done for sure.  All of that perfectly cooked deliciousness was coated in a disgusting, sweet blueberry sauce.  As it is, tonight's sauce would have been better suited on ice cream - certainly not steak!  I think maybe the sauce just needed something to cut the sweet - pepper maybe?  But with a beautiful filet and really nicely cooked scallops - why sauce it?  They would have been great on their own.

Our server was very helpful and attentive.  The staff in general were all kind and helpful.  Prices seemed reasonable. 

Hopefully they'll work the kinks out of their sauces and it will be a really great local place to have a nice meal."}
{"text":"Don't bother, unless you want horrible service and nasty food!!! I ordered the pork chops, they were dried out and smothered in barbecue sauce along with the brussel sprouts and mash potatoes. Yuck!!!"}
{"text":"We go here for lunch often. The staff is fantastic. The service is usually quick and the food is good. New menu is good. Had the Breakfast Burger today. Wow!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has decent food, but an apparent disorganize kitchen and mediocre wait staff.  We went for dinner, my friend ordered clams & shrimp over pasta.  It came with no clams.  When she asked the waitress, the waitress said \"Oh, yeah, we ran out of clams.\"  Really?!  We went for lunch, ordered their special sandwich of the day which the waitress said came on whole wheat bread, then she came back and said \"We're out of whole wheat bread.\"  Really?!  People from my office like the food here, but I hate to go there at lunch because they just can't get the order right, and the kitchen is slow."}
{"text":"I've been to Bonfire One time since its been open but not for the food! I went on a Friday night when the club is open! I had a blast dancing And drinking! Lots of people there dancing and having a good time! So BonFire is not only a restaurant it's a club on the weekends! My cousin tabby goes there a lot to the weekend club and she loves it! So I suggest to anyone looking for a Good time hit up Bonfire! You will not regret it!"}
{"text":"What a fantastic evening! Great entertainment and a fab meal. The meatloaf was melt in your mouth scrumptious. The service was impeccable, special thanks to Heather Box for making the night a very special one. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I have been to Bonfire many times, for the food and for the nightlife. The food is excellent. The chef always creates different food specials each day, so make sure you ask about the daily specials. They're pricing is very reasonable for the portions you receive. They offer karaoke, acoustic music, and live bands throughout the week. I always have a good time.  All the staff is very friendly. I would recommend this restaurant if you're looking for something different than your generic chain restaurant."}
{"text":"\"Not Too Good!\".    We keep going back hoping that the next time will be better.   We simply ordered two \"Fiesta Salads\" ... they were marked as \"NEW!\" on the menu.   When they came out , they only had about half of the ingredients in the salad.   Sounds picky, but the menu said \"tortilla strips\" ... not to be found.   When asked about this obvious miss, they sent out a bunch of crunched up nacho chips on a saucer.   Next step, complain.   Although there were very few people there (except a bunch at the bar, I assume including the manager), the server came back to tell us the manager would take ONE of the salads off the bill.   I guess you get 50% off when you get 50% of the salad!!   I think we'll quit hoping."}
{"text":"No wonder there was no lunch crowd!  Walked in and not a hostess in sight.  Walked into dining/bar area and stared, waiting.......waiting.......waiting.....went back to front door.  I opened and closed the door a couple of times hoping that the chime (if there was one) would signal someone that there were potential customers waiting. ......Still nothing.  So, back to the dining area, had some glances from staff, but nothing.  The manager needs to train the staff, or should be fired."}
{"text":"Food was wonderful! Great staff and local entertainment. My wife really enjoyed the Fish Tacos and I also loved the Pork chops. Great place I would highly reccommend Bonfire. Ill be back real soon!"}
{"text":"I was in Concorde, NC for a customer visit. While there I stopped in the Bonfire Bar for dinner. The food was good and the Burgers were on special that day for $5.00. (About 1/2 price), also had the wings. It was a little slow but the staff (Amber, Taylor, and Brittany) were all very nice and friendly. Nice place if you haven't been there, give it a try."}
{"text":"We've visited several times for business dinners. The staff are very professional and timely.  Very attentive.  We've had the meatloaf, steaks, most of the appetizers.  The food had great presentation and the food tastes fantastic.  Truly a great restaurant!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been twice and both times service was fast and friendly. The atmosphere is great and I've loved the food each time. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"7:45 on a Saturday night, and they weren't that busy. We waited 15 minutes and no one even acknowledged our presence. We've eaten here several times before, but that's not acceptable. We left and found somewhere else to spend our money."}
{"text":"WATCH UR CARD WHEN RUNNING A TAB!!!
Lousy service.
Last nite presented my card to cover tab. When done and wrapping up, they tried to give me someone elses bank card. BUT THEY DID NOT HAVE MINE!!!!!  THEY GAVE MY BANK CARD TO SOMEONE ELSE!!!
Manager said he had us covered. Covered my bill for 4 guests.  And offered additional cocktails. We accepted. When went to order \"Irish Trashcan\" bartendress said she never heard of them and didnt know how to make it. She had just made us 2 of them. Ladies wanted strawberry daquiris. Bartendress said they dont have a daquiri machine.  Manager had given approvals then this person got a case of STUPID.  
Lousy service.  Despicable.
Immediately notified my bank. Canceled card. Now without bank card over holiday weekend. Thanks Bonfire bar staff."}
{"text":"Perhaps if your menu and website links worked and didn't redirect me to some Japanese website I'd be interested to visit your establishment"}
{"text":"We like this place. The food is always good with large portions, and the staff are very nice and accommodating."}
{"text":"This will be the last time we ever give our business to Bonfire. The bartender didn't know how to make a mojito, a mai tai, or even a long island iced tea.. The \"naked ninja turtle\" is listed on their menu. It was awful, so I suggested she taste it, she agreed, made me a new one, and it was just as bad. We ordered cheesesteak rolls as an appetizer, which were good, but we were not given plates or silverware/napkins. At this point I noticed there were several fruit flies flying around.  He had a burger as his entree, which wasn't bad until we found a hair in it.. As for me I had the \"chicken masala\" which was little more than a paper thin slice of chicken drowned in gravy. For a $75 bill we will happily take our business elsewhere."}
{"text":"I went to this location ordered the bang bang shrimp followed by the steak and crab cakes. The food was pretty good actually no complaints there. My service however was pretty bad. There were only 5 tables there total and my waiter was just moving far too slow. I mean took forever to greet us, took forever to take our orders, took forever to bring the check and pick up. My drink was always too low or empty. There were also flies all in the window. Just a bad experience overall"}
{"text":"Really nice little spot my boyfriend and I came across. We typically don't go this far into Concord. Food and service was both good. Had a good beer selection too. Definitely going to return at some point!"}
{"text":"Love Bonfire. Great location and great food. I've become a regular on their Saturday night Karaoke."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were looking for a late night eating option after attending a local concert. We found the 'late night' dinning in Concord to be extremely limited.  We happened to find Bonfire on a random Tuesday night and we were very pleased. Staff were very warm and friendly, and the locals were notably welcoming.  The menu was limited at midnight, but as far as their wings and Fat Tire on tap...we were very satisfied!  We will go again if we're in the area."}
{"text":"Congrats!! One star since I couldn't give them zero. We were in town for a competition and had approximately 60+ representatives from our group with us here in Concord. After searching Yelp for a local non chain restaurant we decided to give Bonfire a shot. Upon arrival, we went to the hostess stand and asked if they had room for a party of 16-18. It was obvious they did, by the open tables in the restaurant. The hostess asked one of the servers if they had room to seat the party and she quickly replied, \" uhh.....no....!!!\" And then stormed off. This didn't sit well with my wife and when she told us, from the parking lot,  I looked back into the restaurant and the hostess was flipping us off with both hands!! Yes.....double gigs!! Perfect way to keep your patrons coming back for more. 
   I went immediately back into the Bonfire confronting her and asked for the manager. She said that it was directed toward a fellow employee that was arriving to work, and it could have been, since there was another girl walking in at the same time. Regardless....what a piss poor way to represent a place of business. Our group would absolutely rather support a local business rather than a chain, but I can't see that happening anytime soon. 
   I'd love to review the food, but due to the complete lack of professionalism from the staff....that won't happen. Good luck with your fine staff!! No telling how much they've cost your business that you don't know about."}
{"text":"I got the Quattro Formaggio pasta. It was pretty good and a very huge portion. My boyfriend got the pork chops and they were delicious. Both were only $9.95 and worth it. The cream corn was very good as well."}
{"text":"This is our second time visiting because I have a few gift cards. I had the Cuban Sandwich. The sandwich was fantastic but the side of beans I ordered had more meat than beans and weren't my favorite but that's a matter of preference I'm sure. 
My husband had the Cajun Pasta and picked out the soggy vegetables that looked like they had been frozen and overcooked but he said the actual pasta and sauce was good. 

We had really great service and would return again with the family just for that."}
{"text":"I used to love this place BUT...  now Sunday Buffett is a disaster.  No service, food cold and dry. Pancakes hard and cold.  The one saving grace, is they took one Buffett off the bill."}
{"text":"This is a restaurant we have been to a few times and we like. My boyfriend gets the pork chop or meatloaf and I usually get a salad. Last time I got a strawberry salad w a crab cake on top. Flavors are very balanced and food presentation is always nice.  Service has been good, friendly.  I'm sure we will go back again soon."}
{"text":"Great food.....live music when we went on a Friday night.....band was Great and the service was awesome"}
{"text":"This place used to be great.  This is no longer the Bonfire that the community came to love.  A new owner and lack of management has left this place as a bad imitation of what it used to be."}
{"text":"Just a typical bar with really decent food. I just don't recommend their \"Ninja Turtle\" or \"Lol Lemonade\" drinks. They are overly sweet and no alcohol. Otherwise our food and service were good!! 

I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Might be good if you can ever get a table. Don't come here with a group bigger than 4. The hostess is NEVER at the hostess stand. We saw many people walk out because no one was there to greet them. Avoid unless you've heard the food is orgasmic, but judging from the lack of enthusiasm at the front of house, I doubt it."}
{"text":"I think \"meh\" is the best word to describe Bonfire. Service was okay but not outstanding. I had the Bonfire burger and my date had the turkey burger. My burger wasn't bad, but it comes with ketchup on it and that totally overpowers the other flavors. My date said the turkey burger didn't have great flavor. They didn't have any napkins available when we were there besides tiny cocktail napkins. All in all, not bad, but not good."}
{"text":"Great food for the price + it's close to downtown. They have live music frequently. There isn't too many places in concord with live music...need more places like this!"}
{"text":"The location was great and for a Saturday late afternoon / early dinner there was no waall.  With that being said the service was remarkably slow but the food came out in a reasonable timeframe and was very good.  All (6) of us were pleased with our food.  I really enjoy their 10\" pizza, great sauce and awesome crust!  If service was slow once in a while I would rate higher but they are consistently on the slow side so I rated them lower.  If your not in a hurry the food is worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I love this place been here 7 years and going! The best place in concord by far!"}
{"text":"Mediocre food at best but the service was good! I will not be going back unless there's a zombie apocalypse and there's nothing else open."}
{"text":"Decided to try a new restaurant and ended up at Bonfire. Nicely designed and spacious bar/grill with lots of seating. The menu offers a lot of choices from Pork Chops to Fish Tacos.

I had the blackened fish tacos and they were awesome. Ordered onion rings as a side and they came with a mustard-based sauce that was a pleasant change from the typical ketchup.  My fiance had the chicken tacos and loved them as well. The pico de gallo was fresh and had a nice heat from the serrano peppers and the spicy aioli sauce added a unique dimension to the dish. Overall, the service was attentive and the atmosphere was great. 

Only complaint was with the creme brulee. They used powdered sugar instead of sugar so the topping didn't have the classic crispy crust that creme brulee should have. 

We will definitely return to try other items on the menu"}
{"text":"Nice place with friendly staff. Menu has some great choices on it. I went with some fried pickles and the pork chops with potatoes and asparagus. All was very good and came out quickly. My only complaint is the food was all piled together so my asparagus tasted like potatoes and so on. Definitely worth stopping in."}
{"text":"Last fall, we went wine tasting at Treehouse Vineyard and Bonfire was set up outside selling food in a catering type style. My boyfriend and I got some macaroni and cheese to share and it was ahhhhhhh-mazing! So good in fact that we hunted down the actual restaurant, even though it is a little bit of a drive for us. Service has always been good. Manager and servers are very nice and friendly. 

We have eaten here three times and are pleased each time. I love the chicken caesar wrap (this should be no surprise at this point since I often speak of my love for wraps). At times, the chicken in it is somewhat dry but it is still good. My boyfriend has tried several things but his favorite is the buffalo wings. We both always get the macaroni and cheese because that was what brought us there in the first place. 

A heads up - they have pretty late hours (I think it is posted that they close at midnight) but they close a little early when it's not football season. This hasn't even been an issue for us but I wish that they would reflect this change on what they have posted."}
{"text":"Had to ask for water.
Small town beer selection :(
Over cooked, under-weight ribeye.
Tough, heat lamp fries.
Waiter called me \"boss man\"???
Gave my wife a stomach ache.

Might be good for the local Ricky-Folk, but doesn't really cut it."}
{"text":"Locally owned and friendly staff. Enjoyable  whether you are here for dinner or to enjoy the many regional  bands passing through that turn the place into a nightclub on weekend nights.   Extensive menu beyond just pub fare.  Meatloaf is a staple and are the blackened fish tacos."}
{"text":"Was in from out of town and needed dinner. Inside its pretty typical sports bar (not a bad thing), inside the menu you'll find a lot of different things to eat. I got the grilled cheese (comes with mac n cheese and pulled pork inside and I added bacon. Because bacon) and onion rings (extra crispy). Everything tasted good. My server was just attentive enough. I will go back when I am in town again."}
{"text":"Loved the chicken wrap, ribeye and who can pass up the half priced bottles of wine? Wish we could have stayed to listen to the live music, but we'll be back!!"}
