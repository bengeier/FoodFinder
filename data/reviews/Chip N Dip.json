{"text":"The stand-alone building that houses this restaurant, used to be called the Steer Inn and it was a fixture in Richmond Hill dating back to the 60's when I was a teenager.  After perusing the so-called menu perched on the countertop next to the cash register, I chose the Queen Combo.  It comes with a side of french fries and a can of soda.  It was June the 16th and the time was 8:57 PM. The place was empty.   The lady who served me was pleasant and very friendly, however after placing my patty on the grille, she came out from behind the counter area, sat down and became deeply involved with her cell phone. After returning to the grille, she asked me what condiments I wanted on my burger. Upon plating the burger and fries, I retrieved the items from the counter area, selected a can of Coke Zero from the commercial fridge and sat down at my table.   Unlike the photo you see here at Yelp showing their burger, mine was burnt. The top of the bun was dry and hard to the point where chunks of it broke off as I was biting into it.  As for the patty, it was dry and overcooked, leaving it rather bland and unappealing.  The fries were acceptable but I had to ask for vinegar, which was delivered to me in a little plastic cup.  All in all, the meal was rather unpleasant, to the point where I will never return.   Nothing about this place was positive and I was left with the impression that the family running the operation are clearly out of their depth. There is much they could learn from Harvey's or Hero Burger. It will surprise me it this place is still around a year from now. As I was leaving, the lady asked me if I enjoyed my meal. I told her no and explained about the overcooked meat and the burnt bun. She defended the burnt bun by saying that is how they do it and no one has ever complained.  I found that interesting in light of my 50 plus years of eating burgers at Wendy's, Burger King, Harvey's, Steer Inn, A&W, The Red Barn, Hero, McDonald's and probably 50 other establishments.   When someone comes up with such a lame, ridiculous excuse, I quickly realize that I am talking to a brick wall and therefore wasting my time. This may be a petty point but exactly how does the name \"Chip n Dip\" relate to this business?"}
{"text":"I really want to like this place. I've been there two times. But the second experience really leaves a bad taste in my mouth. The first time I came a young gentleman served me, he was extremely courteous. I came away extremely impressed with the quality of the burger and the value of the combo. However ive vowed to never return to this establishment after the second experience. This time an older gentleman greeted me and perhaps he's the owner of the business. The restaurant was practically empty at that point and it was getting goes to 7pm, maybe that's a telling sign of why it's empty despite good food. He greeted me in a reasonably courteous way. He asked me if it was my first time and I replied no and he still offered me a fry with their yummi sauce as with my first visit. The problem came when I tried to cash out. First I told him I'm taking it away, then he thought I was staying. No big deal people make mistake. So it was time to pay and I opted to pay with credit. When I paid, I stared at the amount and it looked a bit off. The combo is 11.99 But the bill came came to 14.05. I asked the gentleman why the amount was off any he said that it was an extra $0.50  credit card service charge. I mentioned to him that he should let me know ahead of time or at least have a sign so that customers can have a choice. He proceeded to say that if I wanted the 0.50 back I could have it back in a tone implying that I was cheap. He also mentioned as if he had every right to pass on the additional cost of doing business to consumers without their consent. Ireplied by saying it's a matter of principles not the amount because you are giving the consumer a choice and being transparent about business practices. But he wouldn't have any of it and said if I want to talk principle then tell it to the other burger places that sells $4 burger but give customers garbage meet. I told him that I don't dispute their quality of food that's why I came back a second time but if you are to treat customers like this you are going to lose a lot of customers. He then told me to take my business elsewhere and don't ever come back. During this whole interchange I spoke in a polite and courteous way and every intention was to let him know how to better their business and was met with such attitude. While this is all going on two construction guys came in to order burgers, the same gentleman was on the phone, practically ignoring the two guys for a good three or four minutes even when they ve been ready to order.  If you can deal with the horrible service go ahead and give chip and dip a go.   As I consider a foodie myself where I truly enjoy my food, if the food is exceptional and exquisite fine I'll swallow my pride and enjoy my food but chip n dip ain't one of these places."}
{"text":"Excellent service and fresh food. We arrived at 6pm and according to Google business, that's when they were not the busiest so we stopped by. That's when we realized, 'oh no, what if we get the leftovers from lunch?!' However, when we arrived, we were greeted and asked if we've been there before. We said no, and they suggested having the burger if it's our first time. We got the queen patty combo and it was cooked right away.  We got to taste many different sauces with the fries which was sweet! Their fries were also very crispy I noticed. Definitely would not mind going there again.   Only downfall is that there's currently construction in the area so it may be hard to get in but hopefully that gets changed soon :)"}
{"text":"This is an amazing family-run business. They have great food, large portions, and excellent service! Lots of parking and lots of room inside to eat. Definitely check them out if you're in the Richmond Hill area!"}
