{"text":"The food is very good, the bread is fresh, the service is quick and the staff is knowledgeable.  Only problem: it's GROSSLY overpriced. You basically have the choice of an all-inclusive for two, that comes to almost $200. Or you select from a list of small tapas at around $20-$25 each. My gf had a cocktail that came at $26. I mean....the place is good but I'm sorry, those prices are pretentious. And it's not like I'm not used to pay to go to good restaurants. I enjoy dining out at good spots and I usually don't  care about the price. But Laurie Raphael is the most expensive place I've been in a couple years. This is why I actually know you can get equally good food and experience (even better to be frank) for half the $150 you'll pay per head at Laurie Raphael.  Bottom line: had a good experience but the inflated bill ruined it all. Will not return."}
{"text":"Quel accueil chaleureux et service professionnel. Nous avons pris le menu 5 services et nous avons qu'une envie ; revenir pour le 10 services tellement tout est bon à ravir . Chaque plat est bien équilibré avec un éventail de saveurs subtiles . Chaque bouchée  est une dégustation. On aime prendre son temps dans ce bel endroit confortable et tranquille . Ça fait vraiment du bien. Trop de restos sont bruyants à Montreal.  Ici la qualité se paye et on en a pour notre argent. J'ai hâte à notre prochaine visite."}
{"text":"Having dined in the Quebec City location a few years back my husband and I opted to make a reservation at the Montreal outpost of Laurie-Raphael while we were visiting Montreal recently, and while nothing can ever match that first visit, I was far-from disappointed.  Service is excellent and professional.  Full-bar is available, but the drinks are a bit skimpy.  (To be fair, we noticed this in every restaurant we'd dined in while in Canada.)  The wine list is pricey-but there are some lovely wines to be had by the glass.  I was a bit worried when I realized the a-la carte menu consisted of 'small plates' as I was starving, but I needn't have worried about going away hungry.  Yes: the plates are small - but the quality and the rich flavors of each plate will sate your appetite - expecially the seared foie-gras.  (truthfully, though:  how anyone could eat anything after the seared foie-gras is beyond me - sheer bliss!)  This is a fine-dining establishment.  It is about quality, not 'quantity.'  There are hundreds of restaurants in Montreal which will fill your stomach.  I'd like to think that Laurie-Raphael fills your soul  ."}
{"text":"The reason I give this three stars is the exorbitant price tag.  It was about $400 for 4 people without a lot of wine.   The food is good although in the style of nouvelle cuisine with small portions.  Previous comments I read about good service and excellent bread selection I concur.   Was impressed with the deserts.  However, I can pay $100 for a meal that I will never forget, I don't think this meal qualifies.  The decor is pleasant and relaxing."}
{"text":"Even in consideration that it was Christmas Dinner, the service was exceptionally slow. This experience was probably the worst restaurant experience I have ever had in Montreal. There where many other customers looking around waiting anxiously for the next course to come during the entire dinner service. Not only was the food slow, cold, and unappetizing. When I made a reservation, I was under the impression they would be offering the advertised $65 (not the $85 on the menu) 5 course meal they had advertised on their website for weeks prior to Christmas day (yet suspiciously couldn't find day of). It was very unfortunate that this had to happen, and while I gave the much obliged tip for working on a Holiday, I truly wish I could get my money back. Not only do I feel completely duped, but I left hungry, disappointed and quite honestly embarrassed that I ended taking my husband to such a fail of a place to eat. To top it off, I made the reservations weeks in advance, requesting a view or by a window- to which I did not receive, and we were placed behind the bar. I truly believe that if they were struggling with staffing, or something - they would have at least come over and apologized. Yet, no manager EVER checked in on us. I left hungry, again embarrassed, and asking was it just because it was Christmas? It took well over a half hour for each course to come out, and over three full hours to complete the meal, because of this we skipped dessert and coffee, high-tailing it out of there as we waited what felt like forever for the check. Almost $300 CAD for 5 \"course\" itty bitty meal and 3 weak drinks per person, for 1 couple is absolutely uncalled for.   Bottom line- completely overpriced, underwhelming, uncomfortable, and not worth it AT ALL. Should have just gone to the Ritz for better service and food. I truly wish I could get my money back."}
{"text":"Déception! Nous avions tellement d'attentes envers le haut lieu de la gastronomie... Certains plats étaient plutôt ordinaires, d'autres bon mais rien a avoir envie d'y retourner... Service plutôt ordinaire, je convient que le jeune homme à fait de son mieux mais une mauvaise connaissance du menu n'a pas expliquer celui ci... Et il avait un français approximatif bravo pour l'effort mais va ne va pas si tout. Au prix de l'expérience celle -ci se doit d'être parfaite, ce qui ne ne fut pas le cas. On y retourne.... Non"}
{"text":"Small plates in a hotel?  This sounds like a recipe for crappy food at a high price!  I was surprised to find the food here is really good but when you throw on the hotel prices it's getting up there with some of the big players in Canada!  For that I had to bring the score down as it's good but you can get much better in the amazing gastronomical city of Montreal for the same style of food.  The service is great as well as the atmosphere.  If you're looking to impress the ladies then this might be a place to do it.  Otherwise I'd steer clear of here for those occasions."}
{"text":"No stars, really. Small plates should be renamed single bite plates. There were four of us and we should have been informed by the inadequate waiter that a plate would barely be enough for one person.  The food was tasty but incredibly minuscule. Scrounging would be a more descriptive term. What a disaster at exorbitant prices. Don't bother."}
{"text":"The dishes are in a small plate format and are excellent.  Fresh bread selections (pistachio, cranberry, rosemary, mini wheat baguette...) are baked daily.  There is a pot of perfectly delicious, soft butter at the table.    The decor in the narrow dining room is modern with mostly tables with a voyeuristic view via a large, lightly tinted circular window to the kitchen where you can see your food being prepared.  There is a small number of banquettes facing the street view to one side.  In back there is a curtain for parties wishing more privacy.  I noticed harsh lights overhead at a number of tables and was happy to not have to sit there.  Many of the diners are hotel guests.  Chef Owner is Daniel Vezina, a well-known local chef  The tasting menu is $100 and with wine it is $175.  It is a separate menu from what is offered a la carte.  The menu on the website is largely what was being offered when I visited, with some items changed.  We ordered about 6 or 7 dishes and shared -- including:  -Huîtres fraîches au granité de « Granny Smith » 18 -Thon façon « Général Tao »,  brochette de betterave jaune et tatsoy, soba à l'huile de homard et soya bio 24 -Carpaccio de veau de lait piedmontais de Valcourt, vinaigrette aux anchois, niçoise et espuma d'hollandaise 15 -Ris de veau laqué à la betterave et canneberges, purée de céleri rave et popcorn de boudin -Veau de lait piedmontais de Valcourt en millefeuilles de pleurotes, sauce à la truffe et os à moëlle - a 'foie gras lollipop' dish that I don't recall clearly -and a cheese croquette with melted cheese in the center  I was surprised to find what reminds me of a pecan sandie creatively used in place of a biscuit in a layered dish.  The popcorn boudin was enveloped in a thin layer of seaweed as a part of the coating.  And finally, in the dish with the bone marrow, the bone is filled with a bone marrow based stuffing.  I can highly recommend the by the glass bubbly which was I think,  from Ontario.   Overall my views on the service are mixed.  It was lacking in consistent attentiveness for the price point - we had to ask on several occasions to see the drink list or to have more bread.  On the other hand, the food was well explained and the staff was very knowledgeable and helpful with tasting and selecting wines to try.  I got the impression that the very best service is reserved for those who spend the most.    Our chatty waiter referred to regular water as 'municipal' water, when listing our choices.    You will be informed that all of the china is the made by local artisans and available for you to purchase.  I think that you will enjoy this place, just remember that it is small plates that can be fun to share however, you will need to order several dishes due the the format and while you will not leave hungry, this is not for you if you have a big appetite.  So go here to enjoy the food.  The party over from us was commenting that they enjoyed their dinner here more than their last visit to Toque...   :)  Laurie Raphael is open on Mondays!"}
{"text":"The menu dégustation was truly amazing! It's a true  culinaire experience. Yes is expensive but u have for your money. Food lover ,perfect for a special occasion. I bring my boyfriend there for his bday and he just love it."}
{"text":"Amazing gourmand experience. We went for a dining experience -- the full 10-course tasting menu with the 8 wine pairing -- and LR did not disappoint. A few things that might not work for others: price was high (worth it in our opinion), the full service was long (3 hours but it was a rainy Monday night so why not), the ambiance was a bit strange as one diner could look outside but the other could only look at her dining companion. Each course was more delicious than the one before it, and as refined as the food was the servers somehow managed to keep the experience fun and not stuffy at all. Some favorite courses were the foie gras and the mushrooms (served on bark!)."}
{"text":"Our concierge at the Loews Hotel had recommended this place for a special night out, for my husband's birthday. Yes, the portions are small, as have commented others on this site, however, I think it is to be expected from a place of this caliber. It is definitely NOT your CPK or even higher end restaurant that serves larger plates, nor are the plates meant to be shared, which our server made clear to us.   We greatly appreciated the attentive service and beautiful atmosphere. The food is top notch and beyond unique. I agree that it came with a hefty price tag, but, again, it is a matter of perspective, and keeping in mind that it was a birthday celebration, I'd have to say it was well worth it.  I had the trout  and my husband had the lamb with curry sauce, both of which were divine. For dessert, we had a homemade mascarpone based dish which was unlike anything I've ever had, and I have a serious sweet tooth.   As a special surprise, they gave us a jar of elegant cookies for my husband's birthday, which was a pleasant and much appreciated surprise. Our server was Hugo who was friendly, polite and just overall wonderful."}
{"text":"A good 3.8 because they make here some really nice combination of ingredients. However, portion are all appetizer size and you will be left hungry for sure and service was really to slow, with several meal arriving not warm at all (pan seared fat liver foie gras should be served hot, not just medium warm!)"}
{"text":"This is our first trip to Montreal (Also Canada) and also our first meal in Montreal. Compared to NYC, I think the portion is good for fine dining. Flavor is complicated and I love the beef tartar and the duck! This place definitely deserves more stars;)"}
{"text":"Le restaurant est situé au 1er étage d'un hotel qui de l'extérieur ne parait pas très attirant. Quand on rentre dans le restaurant, on découvre une très belle place romantique. La qualité des produits présents dans les assiettes est au rendez vous. Cependant, le prix des plats semble un peu élevé par rapport à la quantité présente dans les assiettes."}
{"text":"We ordered the five course tasting meal with wine. Not cheap, but the food and service was excellent. The halibut with fiddleheads was one of the best things I've ever eaten.  For the people commenting about the size of the plates: the portions weren't large, but we walked away from the meal feeling full, but not stuffed.  If someone else was paying, I'd be back here in a shot. Otherwise, It's a Very Special Occasion type of restaurant."}
