{"text":"Ordered a chicken souvlaki combo to go.  It cost me close to $10 incl. tax.  The portions are very calculated.  Not enough roasted potatoes.  I watched 2 consecutive combos made, the lady gave 3 pieces of roast potatoes on both.  It's a shame because the roasted potatoes tasted quite good.  The salad is pretty lame.  Rice and souvlaki were the tastiest part, but not really worth the price to keep coming back on a regular basis.

A good place to get a quick bite, but don't expect anything special.  You can get a lot more for that kind of money in other greek places.  A stingy place if you ask me.

{"text":"Parkway has hardly any choice of food; indeed the food court is depressing in the extreme so perhaps I didn't sit down to eat in the best of moods but it was made worse by the poor food I was served at this place. I ordered a chicken sandwich and fries;  well the fries were quite 'mealy', the bun was far fom fresh and the chicken in the sandwich somwhat cold. 

No wonder people abandon these places in favour of nearby frachise fast food outlets."}
{"text":"I decided to grab a quick bite to eat while shopping at Parkway Mall. I am a huge fan of Greek food and considering there was not many choices in the food court I went to Zorba The Greek. When I ordered my food I took a notice on how clean the take out stand was (well at least from what I could see). The service was welcoming and pleasant. I ordered the Gyros Dinner Plate and the portion size was extremely generous. I receive Gyros, Greek Salad, Rice, Potatoes and a Water all for under $10.  I would have to say this place is great when you are in the area and feel for some Tzatziki."}
