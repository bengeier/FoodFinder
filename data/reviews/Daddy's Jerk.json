{"text":"I go there for lunch the jerk chicken is great. you get a great meal for a great value. The food is always warm and fresh."}
{"text":"One of the better jerk chicken places in Brampton. This is my go to place when i crave for jerk chicken. The owner is super friendly and the food is awesome. Portions ate of good size."}
{"text":"Good chicken 13.25$ for large jerk rice and peas. I Eat there often. Girl at the counter is not quite as friendly as a honey badger though. Whatever, chicken's good and that's what really matters."}
{"text":"Best around , and they have white meat !  The coleslaw could be a bit more in the cup   5 out of 5 stars for sure !!"}
{"text":"Good spiciness on that jerk and nice quantity, but a little pricy. It's a small friendly place and theirs usually a small lineup but worth the wait. Perfect for takeout."}
{"text":"Whenever I am in Brampton I usually make a stop here, really good Jerk chicken, chicken Roti, amazing Ox tail, curry chicken on rice, also their Beef patty is pretty good ( the chicken patty sucks ) for some reason   Thanks for reading"}
{"text":"I live close by and usually pick this up when I am looking for something fast but not greasy.   The jerk chicken and rice is really well done (it's slightly spicy). The portion sizes are also fairly good, the larger serving is usually enough for my parents to share.  My only gripe is that their debit/credit machine has been \"not working\" for more than a year and they only take cash."}
{"text":"I ate jerk chicken, rice, and creamy coleslaw. The chicken was flavor packed, rice in great consistency and the coleslaw was good as can be. Main point: the jerk chicken beat a chain place's out of the park. Thank you Daddy."}
{"text":"I visited not too long ago the place is a bit run down and the portion sizes are tiny.  Ordered oxtail and felt like they very very stingy.  The flavor ok I have had better.  The coleslaw is creamy not like some other places and felt like it was packaged and sitting for a while.   Won't go back."}
{"text":"For Brampton, you really have to take what you can get up here, in terms of food within distance.   But actually, very pleased with this location!  Great jerk and rice - highly recommended and friendly service.   Price would have been grounds for five stars. Also, I like my rice moist so it may have been limiting there... But ask for oxtail gravy !"}
{"text":"Ate the jerk chicken meal today. It was good. Not the best but good. I like fire hot this was not close. I think I may have got a better amount  since I told them this would be reviewed.  The jerk was juicy ++  The rice okay The oxtail gravy could of been loaded more considered I ordered extra extra,  portion was big and vegs ok  If these guys added more spice to heat it up... They would get 5  It was good but not the best..  Worth a look for sure but many better options for bang for buck"}
{"text":"Been here numerous times and had the jerk chicken, goat curry, rice peas, coleslaw etc everything practically and this place is excellent....cant wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"IMO they don't have the best jerk chicken. Not that it taste bad I just like my jerk more BBQ with a crispy skin theirs has a gravy as if it was stewed. However, they have my favourite fried chicken. It is thin, crispy and juicy. Just perfect! I also love their curry shrimp roti! Talk about flavourful! They usually have the same people behind the counter and in the kitchen and they are friendly. I like coming here and I will continue to."}
{"text":"Overall the jerk chicken has no taste.. large rice portion is terrible but they do give 5 pieces of chicken.. the coleslaw is only 3/4 of the container. Price wise: terrible way overpriced for the value of the food.  Would I go back here? Nope.  Would i recommend to others? Probably not."}
{"text":"It's a hit and miss. First time I went it was pretty good. The flavour seeped into the meat. Second time it was bland. The rice and peas were consistently dry. I would come back if I was around the area. Portion size is reasonable for the price. I'd go back if I was around the area."}
{"text":"If you can get over the rude lady behind the counter who beckons to you to collect your packed lunch by wiggling her index finger at you, you'll find the food is tasteful. While I waited for my take out, I noticed that the patties come out of a frozen store-bought box... Guess it is too much to ask for freshly made patties..."}
