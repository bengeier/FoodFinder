{"text":"In the search for a great new Chinese delivery place in our new area, we tried this place out. It was absolutely terrible. We ended up throwing every single thing we got out. Everything, especially the chicken products had a very strong chemical taste to it. I can't even describe it but it was like they somehow got coolant or oven cleaner into the chicken? The pork had a very unnatural orange color to it too. The only thing that we did eat were a few steamed dumplings which also had an underlying strange taste to them. 

And delivery took over an hour! 

My husband said in all fairness we should wait until the next day to see how sick it made us. We were okay the next day, but felt really gross for a few hours after eating it and didn't consume anything other than a few bites."}
{"text":"It was Chinese food that's it. Same food you would get at a mall for lunch ( I've had better mall Chinese)service was prompt and food was hot , but just OK"}
{"text":"Ive been here about 4 times. First I tried the Broccoli trio (chicken, beef and shrimp), amazing flavor! Im obsessed with their brown sauce, coming from NYC this is the closest thing to home around Gastonia. Now I just order shrimp and broccoli, the shrimps are plump and cooked right. Did I mention their brown sauce, OMG ITS DELICIOUS. Savory and full of meaty umami flavor, its amazing."}
{"text":"I orders the family dinner A and had it delivered . It says $23.95 but once you get done it's $31.95 plus tip . I was very unhappy with the food . The chow mein was greasy and tasteless with huge chunks of purple onion and what look like tiny thin strips of lunch meat in it . The orange chicken has pieces of red pepper skin and was horrible . The Kung Pow chicken had mushy over cooked veggies in it . Also has egg flower soup which I did not even bother to try . Over all it was not good at all . Worst Chinese I've ever had . Was so let down about the chow mein . I hope they read these and change there food ."}
{"text":"I tried this place today because.i.saw thry have thai food, i been craving thai red curry due to im preggy right now,.service is nice but i ate the thai red curry doesnt taste anything like thai curry at all i didnt even finish it all i was just disappointed because i been craving it maybe they are good in chinese food."}
{"text":"Second time ordering my food arrived within 30 minutes.  The food was hot I order spicy pork and vegetables shrimp on a stick two egg rolls.  I had enough for two.  So I finished it off the next day.  I was please with my order everything was good."}
{"text":"Love the lo mein! It was one of the best I ever had. The chicken wing is one of favorite"}
{"text":"We have been ordering from here for probably 8 years now, 2 or 3 times a month. It used to be China House, I think. We have never had a bad meal. The House Special soup is excellent, as are the pork dumplings. My wife always gets the same thing, Shrimp and Broccoli. I tend to experiment. Yesterday I ordered the Double Cook Pork, it was very good. 

Anyone looking for something different may not be happy here. As in another review, this is standard Chinese fare. However, if that is what you want and expect, you will be extremely satisfied. The food is always good, arrives on time, they give you a lot of it, and it is not expensive at all."}
{"text":"Loved the place before the new owners came! The current owners are super rude and the food quality is at midtime LOW!  I always used to order boba, they were delicious. But now they dont blend the ice good and leave big chunks of ice! The tables are dirty and the kitchen looks even worse! NEVER going back"}
{"text":"I live in the area so I stop by this place all of the time. The staff is lovely, boba is always delicious, and the food is always fast and good! Their egg corn flower soup is just what I need when I have a cold. My go to menu item is the eggplant and tofu dish, it's so delicious! Definitely do yourself a favor and stop by this delicious restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!! the special chicken wings are flavorful and shrimp fried rice is great. Will order again. Delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"My first visit to this place (BIG MISTAKE ) and it was disgusting! The worst chicken fried rice I've ever tasted. The \"chicken wings\" if thats what they are supposed to be were equally horrible! I ordered my rice withOUT onions, yet I get it and not only do I have a plate full of onions but they  are burnt onions and the rice is scorched. I take  the rice back and request an exchange for lo mein instead and the cook in his native language tells the cashier NO, I have to take the rice, so she cooks more chicken fried rice which taste worse than the first batch! I don't want to eat my rice like GRITS! No customer service. NO CUSTOMER SATISFACTION. They've lost a customer before they gained one! #YUCK #NASTY #MUSHYRICE"}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. The first thing I noticed was that the egg rolls are very small, about 1/3rd the average size. They are even smaller than the packaged refrigerated ones in the supermarket. I ordered the Singapore mei fun and it had way, way too much cabbage as compared to the amount of rice noodles. It had lots of carrots but zero peppers, which should have been the main flavor in that recipe. Also, the bits of roast pork were just chucks of gristly fat. I could have made it better myself at home, which defeats the purpose of take-out. I would not recommend it, unless you don't care about taste or portion size."}
{"text":"Love, love, love. My fave is the beef fried rice w/ a green apple smoothie. Service here is friendly. Delivery takes a bit long so i always order for pick up. We've also gotten free egg rolls or chicken with our big orders. Love them."}
{"text":"I've been in for lunch twice now and really enjoyed the food. Large portions,  quick friendly service and well priced. I will be returning for sure."}
{"text":"Fastest delivery and always consistent. Food is amazing. Food Always steaming from the box when delivered. This place deserves great reviews. It's always been the same service since I've been ordering from them about 2 years now. Customer service is great also. Thanks"}
{"text":"I am spoiled, this is the only Chinese food I will ever eat! The white wine sauce is a favorite of mine, but I like almost everything there! The customer service is amazing and the girls go out of their way to make it a wonderful experience for you. I just feel so bad for them when they get so busy at night! But overall, clean restaurant and delicious food."}
{"text":"Ok, so it's really hard for me to dislike Chinese food.  I think I even gave the Tokyo  BUFFET down the road 4.5 stars due to quality / cost / buffet status all factored in.  And I actually love going there, or any other Chinese I have ever been in , though out multiple states, hundreds of times.  

That being sad I can't ever remember one I didn't want to finish my food at until now.  Mediocre is kind... the reviews saying great must be wasted college students.

Details:  ( I order large every time)

Egg rolls : horrid, dry, TINY, nothing inside

Crab Rangoon : had hope for these until I opened the bag. See egg roll description

Egg drop soup : ok, not very flavorful

Lo mein: bland beyond what soy is capable of fixing (had two house)

Fried dumplings :  I think I found a few specs of meat in there somewhere 

Kung pao chicken : again zero flavor, added shrimp fried rice, still didn't help.

Spent $50 wanted to return 95% just to make a point, but that would have caused me more agony then the meal already has.  

Again this has been literally the first time in eating Chinese in 25 years I have been unhappy. 

This place sucks"}
{"text":"We were not sure at first of the distance outside of downtown Las Vegas. But we took the time to go the 9 miles and were wonderfully rewarded. The food was the best Asian food we have had, maybe ever. Everything was so authentic, and the service was superb. The restaurant, while small, was very clean and well worth the trip"}
{"text":"We order from here frequently and the food is pretty consistently good. Lately, the food has been piping hot and fresh. It doesn't taste like someone's incorrect order was reheated and stuffed in a to-go box. Sometimes you order fried rice from a restaurant and it tastes old, dry, and looks way too dark. I'v e never had that problem here. The combination fried rice is a staple in my household.

I love the green tea smoothie and original milk tea. The boba pearls are hit and miss. Sometime they are smooth and chewy perfection, sometime they are hard and gritty on the inside... Try your luck if you enjoy boba, when it's good, it's good!

I tried the curry chicken, but it was mostly quarters of green bell pepper and and white onion floating in a very thin, almost watery curry sauce. There were literally two nickel sized pieces of chicken in it... It was so ridiculous that I'm sure someone didn't stir the batch well or something, because I wouldn't have expected that type of entree to be passed off on me here.

Try the mongolian beef, hot garlic chicken or shrimp, green bean chicken, kung pao chicken or shrimp, combination fried rice, Taiwanese mei fun, or bbq pork."}
{"text":"I ordered from here for the 1st time this week. I was pleasantly surprised.  I ordered the General Tso's Chicken, it was good I thought.  I was really impressed with the crab rangoons. I thought they had alot of flavor and cooked perfectly.  There's alot of competition for Chinese food in the area, so I can understand people's reviews about certain things.  However, I enjoyed my meal, and would order from there again."}
{"text":"I always order for delivery via the Eat24 app. Food arrives in a timely fashion every time & very rarely disappoints. I'm not a big fan of the egg rolls, but I am a HUGE fan of the fried wontons and crab Rangoon. Delivery drivers are always friendly & there's no minimum order amount which is really great. The malasadas are also pretty good, though I wish they were a little less greasy & had a little more cinnamon & sugar. My boyfriend really likes the Orange Chicken & I'm a fan of the teriyaki chicken. Overall it's a great restaurant with good food and affordable prices."}
{"text":"Great Food!Great Place ! Great Service!  Great Price!
Do not judge by its cover. It looked real nice inside and the food was given in larger portions. Steak teryiaki was great. Extremely recommend the shrimp tempera roll and the dynamite roll. They were da bomb!!! this will be my new sushi place since their rolls taste better and are bigger than the ones i normally go to in cleveland."}
{"text":"Probably some of the worst Chinese and food in general I have had. I would worry about getting sick here based on the raw chicken i was served and kung pao chicken that I have now idea what it actually was. Steer clear of this place."}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant. Friendly staff and the food is delicious. I love the chicken wing, it taste so specials, YUMMY! I think I will try their food next time"}
{"text":"Super terrible.  Ordered orange chicken,  egg foo young, and hot and sour soup.  Just terrible. Paid $30 only to have a few bites of each and throw it out.  Not recommended."}
{"text":"I spent about $45 here and had my order delivered...  Very disappointing. a couple of items were OK, but others were so awful I tried to chew them but ended up giving most of it to my cat!"}
{"text":"Good food for good price. They have Great selection of food items as well. And service is pretty prompt too."}
{"text":"WORST FOOD EVER!!!  Order Crab Rangoon to go. It was BURNT to a crisp, PETRIFIED is more like it.  Never, Never, Never will I order from there again. Don't waste your hard earned money on this AWFUL food it is NOT worth it. I even took a picture for people to see but no way to download on here."}
{"text":"My food was delivered quickly and hot, but it taste like windex. I did research and discovered that food develop an aomonia taste after it begins to spoil. Luckily I didn't get sick. But I will never order from this place again."}
{"text":"Just arrived from San Fransisco - Hungry as heck from the long drive...Did a Yelp review and decided to give them a try.....Sighhhhhh to put it mildly terribly disappointed !! Food too salty (and I usually love salt ) Just not a good experience... Sorry"}
{"text":"It's hit or miss.

Be careful when ordering Seafood....they do not mind serving the catch of 2 days ago.

Normally it is good, but I ordered steamed shrimp that smelled so bad it stunk up my house."}
{"text":"The owners are really friendly and the food are really good, they can cook real Chinese and Thai food. The  Singapore noodle is the best among all Chinese restaurant and General Tso's Chicken is the best one I ever had in my life. I definitely will recommend my friends to go there and try it out!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Thai restaurants. They have true spicy dishes and one of two Thai restaurants with Singapore noodles. Food is hot and ingredients are fresh"}
{"text":"I'm First time ordering from them and not only was the food I ordered fresh being that it was Fried wontons, Crab ragoons, and Pot Stickers with a drink Passion fruit slush with extra boba. It was without being over fried so it was crispy where it needed to be and soft where it needed to be and not chewy. It was not saturated with oil and was hot when it arrived. The drink was really good and was not charged extra for the extra boba I requested.The delivery time was great as the estimated time was between 6:55pm to 7:05pm and they arrived at 6:42pm which was 13 minutes earlier than the estimated time of earliest arrival. The delivery person was also nice and friendly, since I did the ordering thru Grub Hub I didn't talk to the staff at the restaurant. They also have coupons for the amount of ordering you do so I got free Egg rolls for ordering $10. I am looking forward to ordering again from them and try other things on their menu."}
{"text":"Sorry but their food is ordinary at best.  It seems that no one in LV really knows what good Chinese food is & I've given up trying to find it here.  The fried won tons were so greasy we couldn't eat them, crispy beef was salty & not crispy, S&S chicken ok, combo chow mein rather flavorless.  $35 down the drain"}
{"text":"Another mediocre Chinese place. My friend & I went by the rating. However I can understand if in other people's eyes it's a 4 star and it's good to them, then it can be ranked highly. Maybe they didn't have the delicious Chinese food I've had in my life. To start, the chicken satay was so dry and tough. The egg roll was thick with that overwhelming thick wrapper filled with a ton of clear noodles. I didn't care for the taste either. The fried rice was bland and they gave me the wrong one. The waiter said it was his first day. The fried veggie tofu dish wasn't bad. I didn't care for the overly sweet & sour chicken. The service was lacking. They never checked on us. My friend had to get up to get her own refill and we had to ask for takeout containers, which he put in front of my face when he brought them to our table."}
{"text":"I love this little place, and so does anyone I know who has tried it! It has a nice atmosphere inside, but usually I do takeout."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place due to them delivering. I'm very glad I did. Less than 20 minutes after I ordered the food was here. I was impressed with the food and I will definitely order from them again."}
{"text":"Grabbed some take out and service was quick! Decent food with pretty standard prices."}
{"text":"I wanted to rate this place 5 starts before even eating the food. I'm a bit of a food snob and I'm very picky when choosing where to eat. This place was so well kept and clean I knew from the moment I walked in I would love it! Definitely a hidden gem in this area!"}
{"text":"Have been to this place several times but, after today don't know if ill be back. I always come and order the crispy beef and ask for it as a dinner special and i just pay the extra money but, today the lady said well were under a new ownership. I told her i always get this and she said okay finally but, we got our appetizer last and didn't get our drinks until our food arrived. The service is also pretty slow and the customer service isn't good at all compared to the old owners and workers. The food also doesn't taste the same it definitely is more food but, not as good as it used to be. Also the menu is not very detailed about the food my girlfriend ordered chicken wings and was highly disappointed when curry chicken wings arrived (which it said nothing about in the menu)"}
{"text":"This is literally the cleanest Asian restaurant that I've ever been to, the food is really good and the staff lady that works there is super nice! Overall an incredible experience! I'm definitely coming back here for Asian food!"}
{"text":"Got sick from the food, as did my family. General Tso's Chicken was disgusting and didn't look cooked, also had horrible texture.

The rice was mushy and tasted bland. Ordered steamed rice and fried rice.

Delivery itself took over an hour to come. If you're looking for a date with your face in a toilet bowl all night, Asian Garden is your place."}
{"text":"Ordered chicken and beef teriyaki plates and not only were they cheap, but very good! The boba milk teas were very delicious and our waitress served us egg rolls on the house!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place negative stars I would ! The delivery was fast but the food literally tastes like ( excuse me ) dog ass . I am very disgusted and neither me or my boyfriend could eat more then one bite . We considered ordering food again from somewhere else because it was just not edible ! I wouldn't recommend anyone get food from here ."}
{"text":"I ordered takeout from here. Picked the pineapple fried rice because the description sounded delicious but what I received was white rice with pineapple chunks and bland chicken. There was absolutely no taste whatsoever and there were definitely no peanuts or coconut sauce in it! Even though I was ravenous because I hadn't eaten all day I couldn't get myself to eat it! I also ordered the garlic delight which was just ok. I'm definitely not going to try this place again and I suggest you spend your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Had Sushi delivered for lunch today, a group lunch.  Had the shrimp tempura roll, boston roll, california roll and hawaiian roll, enjoyed them, but my favorite were Tempura roll and boston roll and love the fact they deliver!  Will order from again!"}
{"text":"I've eaten and gotten boba at this place since I was a kid. In the time I've known it, it's been taken over by different owners and changed names many times. This current state is the best iteration so far. Delicious meals and a variety of boba that can be delivered right to your door. I implore you to give it a try, especially if you live in the vicinity of this place"}
{"text":"Customer service was excellent food not so much potsticker looked like fried mushrooms mongolian beef more onions and peppers then anything and not spicy at all egg rolls were so greasy the broccoli beef the broccoli was hard chow mein tasted like garlic noodles like i said people were great they get 5 stars food 1 star sorry"}
{"text":"Heading south to Florida. Almost 9pm. I search and find this place and call ahead. 25 mins later. It's ready and hot.  Wife drives. I eat.  It is perfect. Just as I ordered it. Beef and broccoli plus some teriyaki chicken on a stick. If this place can nail it on a Sunday night 9pm take out order, they get it right all the time.  Check them out. Florida here we come. Beat the snow out of town by just a little bit."}
{"text":"We live right around the corner from Asian Garden.  My husband LOVES their sweet & sour chicken; says the sauce here is better than any he's had in Charlotte.  I've had several of the Thai offerings and also tried some of the daily specials.  I'm not a fan of their brown sauce and find their white sauce a little bland but the Thai dishes are very good with the right amount of spiciness. Portion sizes are substantial as most entrees come with an egg roll and choice of rice.  I find the prices to be on par with other take-out places we've visited.  Service is always fast, with our order never taking longer than 15 minutes from start to finish.  The space itself is small, but has a few tables if you choose to eat in."}
{"text":"The young lady who waited on me at the counter was seriously watching a video or show on her phone. She only looked up to acknowledge my existence when I wouldn't say what I wanted because she wouldn't look at me.
Wontons were good, but even pork fried rice was just not right.
If service was better, I could probably overlook the food. I've never been so ignored before though."}
{"text":"Let me just start out by saying that when my fiancé and I started dating 4 years ago, this was one of our absolute favorite lunch spots. It had these nice big booths, had a sushi bar and pop machine, was decorated appropriately, and the food was delicious. Then life happened, and we hadn't been in for a meal in quite some time... 

So my fiancé frequents the vape shop next door and needed to get juice. Neither of us felt like cooking so he suggested that we pack the kids up and head to Asian Garden since he was going to be right there anyways and we hadn't been in ages.

We enter the restaurant, and all of the booths have been removed. In their place we're a few flimsy mismatched plastic tables and chairs. The sushi bar? Vanished. Instead of having a pop fountain, there was a self-service cooler. Ok, I know this doesn't make for a bad experience in and of itself, but stick with me here.

We were asked to order at the counter before we sat, kind of like in a cafeteria. The food all came out rather quickly, which seemed a little odd considering past wait times. I had ordered the orange chicken, which was a favorite of mine when we went regularly, with a pork egg roll, fried rice, and hot and sour soup. The soup was bland, my egg roll had been fried to oblivion, my rice had a very plastic taste to it. My fiancé's meal fell right in line... Needless to say, we were quite disappointed.

Next time my family wants Chinese food, we'll take the $40 we spent on overcooked cafeteria food and set it directly on fire... Or just hit Rice Inn up the road."}
{"text":"The food here was fresh and delicious.  The best Asian Food I've had in my 11 years in the Carolinas so far!! Extremely clean and the people were friendly!!!"}
{"text":"Come here a lot for lunch . Great lunch specials. Lots of variety and plenty of portion size ! They also have great wonton soup and New York egg roll is my favorite !"}
{"text":"Have no idea why but after getting food delivered here for years all of a sudden I live to far wtf f*** Asian garden what ass h***"}
{"text":"They deliver!!!!  very fast always good.  LOVE the Mongolian chicken.  Teriyaki chicken IS AMAZING!  VERY VERY CHEAP"}
{"text":"Ok so the place is a little small but the food was awesome and the staff was great. I don't usually just jump into a unknown Chinese restaurant but glad it was good and I will be back"}
{"text":"Really good food in a scetchy part of town... But I'll go almost anywhere for good food. This place not only is it good, but it's a good value. My family of three can eat for less than $20 and still have leftovers for the next day. I've been here at least ten times and haven't had a bad meal."}
{"text":"Awful food. Garlic sauce is dark brown and incredibly syrupy. Chow mein has no noodles, but crispy chips on the side of cooked vegetables and meat. Very nice service, though.  We still shudder at the thought of that food.  I don't know that a Chinese person would know that it was even supposed to resemble that cuisine."}
{"text":"Horrible. Waste of money. The red peppers mixed in my food was inedible. It was like eating plastic. I don't recommend this place at all. It was dirty as fuck there. I'm not from the area so I'm trying new places to eat and so far, this was a bad experience. (Sorry couldn't have said it any nicer)
Rude.
Bad Service.
On phone the whole time.
No music."}
{"text":"Saturday lunch sushi can be hard to find.  Seeing Katana and Little Tokyo were not open for lunch on Saturdays, I suggested Asian Garden to my sushi-eating friend.  

While in a strip mall, it still has a nice restaurant environment.  The dining area is divided from the entryway, so when you're sitting at one of the booths, people coming in won't be gawking at you.  There is a hibachi/prep area with a counter around it for seating on the opposite wall.  We were greeted and seated quickly, and the server was patient with us as we scanned the very extensive menu.

I ordered the green salad with ginger dressing to start.  I get this everywhere I go.  The dressing was more loose than I'm used to and lacked  flavor.  I can usually eat this stuff with a spoon, but this wasn't my favorite.

We ordered Spicy Tuna, Rainbow, and Eel rolls to share, and my friend ordered some sushi.  It was prepared fresh where we could have gone over and watched if we wanted. I took a photo of the plate and posted it, but the color isn't quite right, so don't judge by that.  I tried eel roll first (usually my favorite), and it was still warm.  The eel was just a tad chewy, but it was still very good in flavor.  The Rainbow roll was my favorite from this plate.  Everything in it was fresh and delicious, and it had just a slight spiciness.  The Spicy Tuna was surprisingly mild, which was a little disappointing to me.  My friend also enjoyed the sashimi he ordered.

I still consider myself a sushi rookie, so I may not have all of my terminology correct, but I do know good vs. bad, and this is good.  I just wished I lived closer, so I could benefit from their delivery!  I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"The food was surprisingly very bland. It had no flavor at all. I was really excited to try out this place but I will not be eating here again."}
{"text":"The food is great my favorite are the Singapore Curry noodles, and the salt and peppered shrimp. The Thai boba tea one of the best I've ever tried, the food is always well prepared and in a timely manner, prices reasonable, highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were looking for Chinese or Thai restaurant in Sunrise. Based on the excellent reviews of Asian Garden we went to the restaurant and gave it a try. BEST DECISION EVER, service, selection, speed, food quality, portion size and absolutely AMAZING recipes! We had eight different items and every one of them was delicious! We WILL be back again and again."}
{"text":"A fantastic little takeout place! Great placement- I can pick up a few groceries, maybe some liquor if it's been a rough week, and some great food all in the same plaza. Very clean, polite attendants, but definitely not for dine-in spot. All the dishes my friends and I have tried have been a success. The crab rangoon especially! Keep an eye out for those specials- they're a bargain!"}
{"text":"Best Asian food in the Belmont / Cramerton area. Maybe even all of Gaston County. I've never had a bad meal from here. The carry out is fast and has always been accurate for me. The place is always very clean and the staff are all very friendly. They have 6 tables inside if you want to dine in. Try the Honey Chicken, it's awesome."}
{"text":"We tried more entrees, specifically the summer chicken and the Thai chicken for lunch. The summer chicken is steamed chicken with vegetables. The Thai chicken is a little more misleading as it's nothing like Thai food. It definitely reminded us more of Chinese sweet and sour chicken than it does Thai. They were alright but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and great specials for lunch and group orders. I've come here a few times with my co workers and the food is very good. I love the eggplant tofu, crab cheese rangoons and boba drinks."}
{"text":"Probably the best Chinese food I've had since living in Vegas  seriously, ordered the family dinner for my girlfriend and son and it was delicious !! Food was very fresh and it was reasonable pricing  Now when i think about Chinese this place will come to mind  take all my money lol"}
{"text":"I love the food but this is the second time, different occasions and two different guys decide to yell at me. on one occasion he came to give me the food and yelled at me for using this app to order... I WAS AT WORK and created a great commotion!!!.  I should give a 2 the foods pretty okay so  shouldn't let these two men with very bad service skills lower it so much. I always eat here and their service is getting worse and worse"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery online which was very easy it said 45-60mins it was here right on the hour. My friend got Chicken Teryiaki and substituted noodles for rice. She liked what she got. I ordered crab rangoons and asked for Egg Fried Rice with no veggies. The crab rangoons had maybe a 1/4 of a teaspoon of filling which was kind of disappointing and my rice had veggies & onions in it. I don't mind the veggies except I hate onions and i was pretty clear with my notes. Also i ordered a side of plain rice which was not in the bag. I'm 50/50 on ordering from them again as I'm new to this side of town still looking for a good Asian place. I feel like a lot of these 5 star reviews are pretty bogus."}
{"text":"No matter if you order dine in, to go, or delivery, this place is very quick to serve you up the correct meals, with steamy hot delicious Asian style food. Anyone on the EAST side of town should make a speed dial entry, and you will be full and satisfied."}
{"text":"I recently order Chinese food from here and it was excellent and very priced. I have tried many Chinese food restaurants in the area and nothing else compares to Asian Garden. I called my order in over the phone and they got everything right. I'm looking forward to ordering from here again!"}
{"text":"I love their food but loved it more when they still delivered, Now it says they don't deliver to my location"}
{"text":"I don't know how this place has as many stars as it does. The food is terrible I ordered orange chicken and at the bottom there was juice and made all the chicken soggy. And the noodles were over cooked and greasy. I ordered that along with a drink and the delivery guy forgot my drink brought it about twenty minutes later and it was supposed to be a slush but when I got it it was like water. And when I called to let the lady know they forgot my drink she said ok and hung up didn't let me know she was going to get the drink for me or nothing. Sad because my small order was 15$."}
{"text":"There seem to be a lot of negative reviews for this restaurant, but it's actually one of my favorites to order delivery from. I always order the steamed chicken and vegetables with white rice and general tsos sauce on the side (there's no extra fee for the sauce, which is nice).

Their delivery is fast, and the food always arrives hot and served in a generous portion. Their menu is also very extensive and offers more healthy options than many other Chinese restaurants."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! I try something new everytime I go and I always wind up loving it! The Summer Chicken is so light and healthy and tastes amazing! I never feel guilty eating it! Last night I tried the Thai Pineapple Fried Rice and its fantastic! The service is always top notch too. Everyone is so happy and friendly! You have to check it out for yourself!"}
{"text":"The waitress is super cool and cute. 
The food was hot and fresh at reasonable prices. The place is clean, even the bathrooms which are usually dirty in these mom and pop places."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I have been going here since they opened a couple years ago. We've been going less lately since we moved from the East side of town. The people are friendly, the prices is right and  most importantly the food is excellent. Every now and then we make the 20 minute trip just eat at Asian Garden."}
{"text":"One of the best small Asian restaurants I've every eaten at! Great interior and food!"}
{"text":"Nice place to eat with the family. There prices are reasonable as well. The portion was pretty filling as well."}
{"text":"Delicious! I'm a visitor to the area, visiting family for the holidays. Yelped a Chinese place near our hotel and this came up. Thank you Yelp! I got the Garlic Delight. Comes with chicken, beef, shrimp and veggies and crab rangoon. Both delicious! My Husband got Shrimp Lo Mein. We got it to go but the restaurant looks clean and nice. Service was friendly as well."}
{"text":"Love this place.!!!! My boyfriend and I have recently been ordering from here and everything we have ordered has been amazing. Service has always been wonderful when we dine in. The best thing about this place is their speedy delivery."}
{"text":"I love this place. My favorite is fried chicken wings, buffalo chicken and home special Lo men!!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding dinners! I had the spicy chicken dinner with fried rice and it was excellent. The fried onions were plentiful and cooked just right. My wife had the shrimp with spicy garlic sauce. She thought it a bit too sweet but enjoyed the dish very much. Our order included free foil wrapped chicken with dipping sauce that was out of this world. The friendly service and reasonable cost were excellent too! We will definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"I have to say I was very disappointed. My food was cold. The food was not good at all. Sad because I was craving some good Chinese on this rainy Saturday afternoon."}
{"text":"The employees here are amazing people and just wonderful to deal with. Their food is delicious and worth every penny. I love the deals they have"}
{"text":"Off the beat'n path but worth the drive. This little place serves impressive meals. The family run place is as good as the best places I know back home in San Diego. Even the house made ice tea is exceptional. I had a noodle dish with sprouts, Chicken, Shrimp, It was outstanding. They make several different egg rolls that people where ordering & seamed to like a lot. Egg drop soup was popular as well. I'll make the drive here again."}
{"text":"Asian Garden is by far one of my favorite little hole in the walls to go to. It's very close to my house, the food is always on point and the staff there is like family to me. I've been coming here for so many years and every time I walk through that door they greet me with a kindness I don't experience from many places. 
    Some of my favorite dishes to get there are the Singapore Noodles ( amazing curry flavor with pork, chicken and shrimp), the House Chicken ( a nice house sauce they use with a little bit of a kick), combination fried rice (pork, chicken and shrimp, ordering it extra spicy is the way to go though), cucumber salad ( very flavorful, but they put a lot of sesame oil if you're not into that) and the snap pea and shrimp is very light and filling. They also have very cheap lunch and dinner specials. For dinner they have about 8 items to choose from, which comes with a beverage, egg roll, fried rice or noodles and a soup all for $7.99...can't beat that. As for the boba drinks, they are very good! My favorite is the honey peach slush or smoothie! It is a must try!    
     I really love this place and think that everyone should at least try it once. The staff is so friendly and caring, the prices are beyond reasonable and the food I guarantee you won't be disappointed in."}
{"text":"We eat here at least twice a month. Great food every time. Have tried a lot on their menu."}
{"text":"Update: got some boba in the last few days (mainly the milk teas) and they tasted really good! My boyfriend and I love the almond  this place is great for deliver, I'm gonna order the egg foo young next time! Also this time (3rd or 4th?) they gave us a menu and this makes it easier to order next time. Our go to when we're lazy :) or especially craving boba lol





My boyfriend and I ordered a honey peach and honeydew slush, two spam musubis, and it was more than $10 we got free (2) egg rolls. The ordering was easy on the app and it took about 30 minutes to get here which wasn't bad. 

Honey peach slush just tasted like regular peach, didn't really taste any honey. My boyfriend liked it though

Honeydew slush tasted great, kind of wish we asked for boba. :(

I personally prefer the spam musubi to have equal spam and rice but this was okay, it had more rice than I liked but then again it's personal preference. 

Egg rolls had vegetables in them, crunchy, dipped them in the sweet sauce 

Will be ordering slushes w/ boba or the milk tea next time!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent will definitely come again. Broccoli was crisp tofu was wonderful."}
{"text":"First of all I'm not even certain this was food. If I had to guess I'd say either some form of rat poisoning or perhaps a cat or dog from the back alley. It's not a matter of differing tastes in food - this is really hardcore offensive stuff and it's not at all edible. I put it in the trash. I hope no dumpster rats have the misfortune of finding it, it will surely make them sick."}
{"text":"I have no idea who would give this place 5 stars, but I took my mother here on the strength of the 2 seemingly impartial Yelp reviews. Now I am no stranger to Chinese carry-out, and I never expect much from these places, but this place was truly awful, and the prices definitely did not reflect the cheap quality of food that was served.  

Where to begin?

Sesame Chicken Combo - the eggroll was TERRIBLE.  It was extremely oily, and the insides were dry and tasteless. Didn't even make it past the first bite. The \"pork fried rice\" was equally horrible. Yellow steamed rice mixed with bits of pork. No frying of the rice at all, and the whole thing was utterly bland and tasteless.  I know, I know.  It's \"combo fried rice\" but places inside mall food courts have a better cost-cutting \"combo fried rice.\"  The sesame chicken itself had clearly been sitting in sauce too long, as there wasn't any crispness left. Small balls of over-fried, yet soft and squishy, chicken.  Worse than most carry out holes-in-the-wall I've ever tried.

Alaska Roll - I'm always dubious of Chinese/Japanese places, but the Yelp reviews specifically highlighted this place's excellence for Japanese. I don't buy it. My roll was loose, the rice not sticky enough to hold it, and, to add insult to injury, the avocado was COMPLETELY UNRIPE!  What kind of Japanese establishment can't tell when an avocado is not ripe??  The same was true in the california roll.  Gross.

Shrimp toast - Utterly disgusting. I love fried food, obviously, and this was just terribly fried and had an off putting taste beyond the frying.  In my frying expertise, I would say they hadn't changed their oil in a while, which allows the food to become literally soaked with off-tasting, old oil.  

Dumplings - not bad. Not great. Standard fare.  A safe bet if you get stuck here and need to find something edible."}
{"text":"This is some of the WORST chinese food I have ever consumed.  I don't say that lightly.  The service was good, and the place was clean.  The food was simply terrible.  Orange chicken was essentially chicken nuggets in a syrupy, Tang colored, gelatinous substance.  The fried rice was not fresh.  The egg rolls reminded me of the ones you can get a Sam's club, not good.  If you need cheap crappy food, this would be the place to visit."}
{"text":"We have been ordering quite a bit from the Asian Garden lately.  Every time the food has tasted great, arrived hot and in a timely manner.  The delivery persons have been very friendly.  Pricing is very reasonable.  My wife and I will definitely be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"Not a fan of this place. Always finding things that I don't like. Really really HATE surprises in my food, especially when I feed my baby the food. I usually don't post what I find but this time I will, since my 11month old spit it out. Yes that is metal scrubber between the carrots and rice."}
{"text":"First time I've gotten food from here. The Garlic Delight is awesome! Friendly staff. I will definitely order from here again!"}
{"text":"***EDIT: This place is closed and has been taken over as a run of the mill Chinese takeout called Hunan ONE.***

This isn't your typical takeout restaurant. Sure, the Chinese menu looks like that would be the case, and even the generic name may have you fooled, but flip the menu over and you have an entire menu dedicated to Japanese cuisine. I was hesitant about ordering Japanese food from a place like this, but I went out on a limb and don't regret it one bit.

I always order the Katsu Don, which is deep fried pork cutlet over a delicious combination of scrambled egg, onion, pickled radish, and steamed Japanese rice. It comes with a bowl of miso soup and a side salad with ginger dressing. Let me just say I've tasted a large variety of foods many times and in large quantities, but this is one of my top five favorite dishes. Everything comes together perfectly. EVERYTHING. I've tried Katsu Don at other restaurants in the Cleveland area and they just can't match the quality of Asian Garden's. The miso soup is pretty good, the salad was average, but the ginger dressing was phenomenal.... plus they give you a more than sufficient portion for your side salad. I could probably drink that stuff straight from the cup.

To be honest, I haven't tried anything else on this side of the menu, so I can't convince you that anything else here is as good. They do carry a wide variety of popular Japanese dishes. They have other Don Buri dishes, as well as noodle dishes, teriyaki, tempura, and sushi. They even have gourmet sushi on the menu (the large rolls with several ingredients). If they could somehow pry me away from the Katsu Don, I would definitely try other things.

I've tasted a few dishes from the Chinese side. It wasn't terrible, but after having so much Chinese takeout from different places, all of it kind of blends together... especially if you get the more Western dishes, like your sweet and sour or sesame chicken.

Can't comment too much on service, as I've only ordered takeout every time. No messed up orders, and they were prepared in a timely manner. Not much else to say there.

Pricing is reasonable."}
{"text":"I order General Tso Chicken no spice very plain more of a sweet chicken then Tso. The chicken fried rice was yellow rice with about 4 pieces of chicken and onions..disappointed"}
{"text":"I got 2 boba drinks. Coconut milk tea and a honeydew melon smoothie. The smoothie tasted like blended ice with a hint of melon flavor. The coconut milk tea was good and I can't complain about it. But this place can not prepare boba for shit. The boba was so hard in the middle and they sweetened them as well. You are adding them to a sweet drink, more sugar on the boba is the last thing you need. The boba was actually sweeter than the watered down smoothie actually. I am willing to still try their food one day but if you are looking for good boba on the east side, don't stop here."}
{"text":"I was surfing online a few weeks back looking for a place that delivered to my area and found this place. I had decided to give them a try based on the menu having thai food as well as the standard other choices. I was thoroughly impressed with the food. I ordered on (http://eat24hours.com) and they have coupons on there as well as no minimum amount spent for delivery. The prices are fair and the food is really good. I've had the eggrolls, the crab rangoons, and the Shrimp Pad Thai. Also, it normally says 45 minutes for delivery, but they show up within a half hour. The delivery driver is also very friendly. Try this place."}
{"text":"4/5 stars only because of the location. It was tucked away, and difficult to spot from the main roads. Otherwise, this is my new go to resturant for chinese food!"}
{"text":"6/11/2017  Asian Garden seems to have NEW Owners.  I have not had time to review the restaurant, and I will miss the previous owners and hope they open elsewhere."}
{"text":"Honestly some of the best Chinese fast food in the University area. It's always fresh and delicious and I've never had any complaints. The pork lo mien is incredible and so are their special combos. You get a meat, fried rice, and an egg roll for under $7. Prices are great, portions are huge, and the owners are so sweet! A constant go to for quick, friendly service and delicious food that easily makes about 3 or 4 meals."}
{"text":"The food is not good at all. Delivery took over an hour and we live not even a mile away. I wouldn't eat here ever again."}
{"text":"They have daily lunch specials. The food is cooked very quickly. The place is very very small on the inside so don't come here with a large group of people. I normally get my did to go. They charge 50 cent for water. The cashiers are always friendly and greet me with a smile. Good quality Chinese food!"}
{"text":"I'm usually pretty satisfied with any Chinese food restaurant. I get that it's Americanized and not authentic. I know some places are better than others, but this was the absolute worst. We couldn't even eat it. The dumplings had no flavor and the dough was too thick. The won tons in the wonton soup were empty!  Also flavorless. The salt and pepper shrimp was blah. So disappointed."}
{"text":"ordered food which never arrived. They lued about it. Horrible place, DONT order from them"}
{"text":"Nasty!!!! Worst Chinese Ive ever had and that actually is quite the accomplishment. Lo mein had zero flavor besides the burned, dirty griddle they used...which I could also smell with every bite I choked down. Also, theyre apparently too lazy to cook the veggies bc they were pretty much raw. Rangoons and egg rolls were stale and might as well have been empty. Dumplings were burned, chewy and also were pretty much empty. Needless to say, Im still hungry and livid bc that wasnt cheap. Theres too much competition Asian Garden. Hope your business plan is good bc your food sucks!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been ordering delivery from there for a year or two now. The food is decently priced, and we have always received a ton of food. It is standard Chinese takeout, but we have never had food come messed up from here and we order 2-3 times a month. I get plain lo mein, he gets General Tsos, and we share fried rice. Delivery is always way quicker than expected. All in all, good Chinese takeout for a good price."}
{"text":"The two bites of food I tried tasted great BUT I was too skeeved out to eat anymore!  The place was absolutely filthy!  I almost turned around to take the food back but felt guilty?  Floors haven't been cleaned in a long time.  I could see dirty rags on the kitchen floor.  I'm shocked at all of the good reviews because I've worked in the restaurant industry for years and understand that things can't be perfect BUT this was the look of long term neglect.  Yuck.  Threw it all away."}
{"text":"Our absolute favorite Chinese/Thai place to eat on our side of town. I've been a patron since they were Express Wok but they've certainly come a long way! It's such a relaxed atmosphere every time we walk in and the woman who's always there (working her butt off) is always so sweet. They have a great dynamic in the kitchen, you can hear them communicating and even watch them because you have a clear view of the entire kitchen behind the register. They get the food out pretty quickly and always warm. Everything we've tried has been top quality and had amazing flavor, Boba and all. They even have things on their menu that you wouldn't usually find outside of China Town. They have new and interesting specials every time we go in and we can never walk out of there without getting something to go for later. We order so much they've given us free appetizers  on numerous occasions. If you're looking for great food for a great price you should go here! My only complaint is I wish they were open later, but I get it. :)"}
{"text":"For White Oak, this is one of the best places in town, that said, it's nothing fabulous.  They are making an effort to include more fusion items on what I'm told is a new menu, but I didn't order anything spectacular. 

It met my expectations, but didn't impress me.

ETA:  Updated with 3 instead of 2 stars because they updated their menu.  It's huge now!  I'll say the quality of their food is good, but not great.  They do have a really friendly staff, and as far as White Oak is concerned they're probably the best Asian fusion.  Still room for improvement, though."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time tonight. I decided to go with some sushi, as they offer both Chinese food & sushi. The Tuna Roll & Yellowtail Roll both sounded like winners. (See uploaded photo). I was disappointed. The presentation was very nice, including big helpings of pickled ginger & wasabi, & a little plastic grass to divide the two types. This sushi lacks flavor because the tiny pieces of fish are being strangled by a lot of white rice & a thin layer of seaweed. Although it was inexpensive sushi - $5.50/roll - I expected a little bit more flavor."}
{"text":"This Resturant delivered lunch to all the teachers and staff at my school for free. Not only was that super amazing and generous of them but the food was delicious!!"}
{"text":"If I were to ever give a five star review to a fast food restaurant, this would be it... but of course I can't as it is fast food. 

The BEST Chinese and Thai take out anywhere in the Charlotte area.. In Gaston county. They recently won 8th place in the Top 100 Takeouts category. I tried looking up the source - but all I found was their listing and menu. No ranking.

The point is, this is some damn good takeout. While it might not be everyday, I can easily fall into the statistic that Americans consume 2.5 million Chinese meals per day.. That's $25 billion in annual sales with over 46k Chinese food places is the country.. Well.. There the only ones open on Christmas.. What do you want??? It's tradition you know?

Health score at the time this was written was a 95. It is the cleanest takeout I think I've been in. I didn't wonder what was growing out of the ice machine.

If you're having trouble locating the place, it's right next door to the Food Lion and the pitiful excuse of a pizza place, Market Street pizza.. Hide your  wives and your kids from going into that pizza place. Yuck. 

What's good eats here: I like the sesame chicken, General Tso's, and the spicy garlic beef or pork or chicken. Good stuff."}
{"text":"Its alright ... Nothing fancy ... But that sayimg not bad ... Just not great ... If ulike grab and go stuff this is your spot ... Had orange chicken maybe next time ill try something else..."}
{"text":"Since we are first timers to Asian Garden we decided to order the Mongolian lunch, the Singapore noodles, calamari, and egg rolls. The food arrived in a timely manner,but it was cold and the calmari was tough, however everything thing else was great. We will be ordering from them again. Your review helps others learn about great local businesses.

Please don't review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review, or if you're connected in any way to the owner or employees."}
{"text":"Asian Garden is BY FAR THE BEST ASIAN TAKEOUT I HAVE EVER HAD!
If you try Asian Garden, you will never look at your local Chinese takeout the same! 
Everything is so fresh and you can tell it!  
Do yourself a favor and try it out. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Decent Chinese take out. The chicken and rice soup was very good. I also enjoyed the garlic shrimp. I didn't much care for the generals chicken. I thought it was over cooked."}
{"text":"I stumbled on this restaurant today and have to say it was surprised and delighted at how good their food was. What drew me in was that they have BOBA AND LOTS OF FLAVORS TO CHOOSE  from.  I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"The prices on the daily specials can't be beat. The food was good though not amazing. Service was fast and very friendly. I would defiantly go back if I'm ever in the area again."}
{"text":"I don't know why there were all 5-star reviews, but it was not good.

I thought I give it a try since its down the road where I live instead of the usual Chinese restaurant I usually order from. Such a bad idea! For ever sticking with my Chinese place.

I ordered the crab ragoon, house special lo mien, curry chicken with onion and beef with broccoli. I was extremely excited to see all total only came up to a little over $20. Drove home all excited and it was a disappointment the second I bit into my crab ragoon. It was soggy even though I saw her fried it in the second I ordered it, but it was soggy because it was a already made crab ragoon that's been frozen until someone places an order. Very little filling inside and it was just not good.

Never had curry chicken before so I ordered that. It was plain. Taste like ramen noodle to be honest. Only took 2 bites.

The portion of house special lo mien for a small is VERY small. Disappointed in that as well. A lot of veggies though and not enough meat or noodles. Very bland.

The beef broccoli is probably the okay one! To be honest, I told my husband that out of all the fish, the WHITE RICE was the best. He laughed, but I was serious. 

I would not come here again. At least, I know to mark Asian Garden off my list because I've been tempting to try it since I shop at Food Lion all the time as well as driving by it daily. 

If you want better portion and delicious food, I recommend Dragon Wok next to Walmart in Kannapolis 

YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED."}
{"text":"The food is so gross. The taste and color and even texture did not seem normal. My husband and I got really sick from it. I can't explain the taste other then it tasted like chemicals and old chicken. Will never order from this place again. Save your money!"}
{"text":"A small restaurant near our house and one afternoon after running my errand at chase bank we decided to pop in and see the quality of this to go restaurant. When I walk in the door I found out that all the staff are chinese so they better know what they are cooking right? Well they do.

We have since tried this place twice and I can honestly says to you that they have one of the best chow mein in the eastern area. The shrimp dishes however left a lot to be desire. First of all their honey walnut shrimp are not the real authentic honey walnut shrimp and on other occasion we found that the shrimp are smelly which means not fresh.

Other than that, they have great orange chicken and general tsos chicken. We love their kungpao dishes as well. Nice and friendly service, great deals and absolutely worth a try if you are happen to be in the area."}
{"text":"Note #1: They are a BYOB establishment.

Note #2: They offer free delivery with a $12 minimum order, but I have no idea what their boundaries are. I'm guessing they're limited to the Castle Shannon area, but I'm sure it can't hurt to call. They do take-out too, so you can always shoot over and get it if they won't bring it to you. 

My parents owed me a belated birthday dinner, and I hadn't a clue as to where I wanted to go. That was until they got a flyer in the mail for a new Asian eatery in Castle Shannon, right down the road from Pho Kim 88. 

It's yet another entry into the Asian Cuisine Strip Mall War. Does it stand tall? 

For the most part, yes. As it says on their flyer, Asian Garden offers a mixture of Chinese and Japanese including sushi, sashimi, and hibachi. Geez, I couldn't decide where to go eat on my birthday, and once I decide on an Asian restaurant, I can't figure out whether to go Chinese or Japanese! 

\"Why not go both? It's my birthday after all,\" I said to myself.

I started out with some Tako, which is octopus and a wad of rice lashed together with a strip of nori. My sister almost fainted. I thought it was ok. You get two pieces, and I finished both without using the attendant wasabi and ginger.  The octopus itself was a little gelatinous, had texture for days, and only a mild flavor. I didn't hate it but am not sure if I loved it either. 

Now I almost got their Chirashi which is \"assorted raw fish on vinegar rice in a bowl\" as their menu states,but a \"Chef's Special\" called Seven Stars Around The Moon caught my eye.  The menu describes it as \"Jumbo Shrimp, Lobster Meat, Crabmeat, Beef, Chicken, Pork, Scallops, and Mixed Vegetables in Brown Sauce.\" White rice comes with it in a separate bowl as does that famous red sweet & sour sauce. 

It was filling for sure, so much so, that I took about 40% of it home. Each shrimp was tempura battered and fried and puffy and was the best seafood funnel cake/fritter thingamajig I've come across in months. And when you dip each morsel into the red sauce, goddamn, seafood becomes dessert, candy. Who wants tuna ice cream when you can have this? The shrimp was the star with everything else becoming a huge, tasteful mishmash of proteins and veggies united by that Brown Sauce. All of the other sea critters surrendered unto the Borg. 

The Fried Dumplings the four of us shared as an appetizer were an instantly familiar crowd pleaser, the \"Detroit Rock City\" of our Chinese meals. If it doesn't happen, people go home disappointed, y'know? 

Honeyed, crispy, soft, full in flavor and mouthfeel, the dumplings were like pastries of pork. Yet again, a case is made for meat as a dessert by the Chinese, and Asian Garden isn't the only Asian restaurant doing them up like this. In quality, they were very much like Dormont's Amazing Wok, and we ate them up eagerly, each of us getting two. Dad tried to steal a third. 

Speaking of Dad and Mom, they both liked their Hibachi dinners which had a little bit of steak, scallops, and shrimp in them. Dad wasn't nutters over the Miso soup, which I finished for him and liked. He wasn't crazy about his Green Salad with the ginger dressing. I had to finish that for him as well (For what it's worth, Dad's not used to Japanese food, but he used to be iffy about Indian cuisine, and now he loves it, so...). Anyway, AG's ginger dressing isn't the creamy kind I'm used to. It was pretty tangy, a little bitter, and wasn't very sweet at all. In terms of consistency, it was somewhat akin to a cocktail sauce, and that's the best comparison I can make. 

Sis, who's almost as fussy as Dad (I had to beg her to try the Miso soup), liked her Chicken Lo Mein, and Mom, being easy to please, liked everything. 

Asian Garden's lone dessert offering is ice cream in various flavors that you can have as is or \"fried.\" Considering the Chocolate Sin birthday cake from Potomac Bakery waiting for me at home and my recent date with Overindulgence at Burgatory last weekend, I figured it was time to walk away. 

Guess what else was waiting for me at home? More gift cards! Cracker Barrel (I can live with that) and...ulp...TGI Friday's (aiiiieeeee!!!)

Now officially wise to my secret life on Yelp, Dad created a \"freestyle\" that goes \"Darren can't help it, he's gotta Yelp it!\" He also wants me to review EVERY chain in Pittsburgh.  Save me.

The portion sizes are generous for the prices too. The lunch specials are great. They even substituted for me because I wanted sesame chicken. I decided I didn't want the rice so instead of giving me the small portions they just upped it for me. Got a big plateful of chicken and chow me in, more than I could eat. The soup of the day was free, and we even got drinks. Walked out of there feeding two people for less than $15. 
I instantly was texting everyone I knew to come try this place out. Fantastic. I can't get enough!!
