{"text":"I'm not actually a burger fan so I'm not really reviewing so much of their food. I've passed by this location many times and saw that they had great fries, why not try their poutine.   It's my first time here so I ordered my poutine and sat down with my friend and chatted with her. It was really loud there and it was hard to hear. The server stood beside the counter and shouted something a few times. I assumed it was mine. I walked up to her and still could not hear what she was saying. So I asked her if it's a poutine and then she proceeded to rudely tell me that it's 51 and then grabbed my receipt and point to the number on top and talked down to me saying, here there's a number on top. I know it's her part time job... But there's really no need to be rude. So I was chatting to my friend and not paying attention to you. I don't expect high-end service but rudeness is always not appreciated.  The poutine was okay. Although the fries were fresh the cheese didn't really melt. The gravy a tad salty the cheese is average. Most likely not coming back."}
{"text":"The chicken burger is great! Their fries are good as well along with their shake!"}
{"text":"I would give this four stars when it comes to a quality burgers and fries place. This place has by far the best poutine I've tasted while living here in Toronto when compared to THREE other fast food restaurants I've tried. Very delicious."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. They would not serve me with a tray. Never coming back to this joint with excessively long wait times and rude cashiers that cannot count change. Every tine I've been here the cashier has been on her phone."}
{"text":"Overpriced mess. Honestly the line and price is not worth the wait. Its just another overhyped and and overpriced hipster food joint. I could buy President's Choice burger from No Frills and grill at home for a better experience."}
{"text":"I would give this place 3.5 stars. I absolutely love their fries! They are so satisfying. However, I am not a fan of their gravy so I would skip their poutine. I've tried their Italian chicken Deluxe with roasted peppers and Gorgonzola cheese...delicious but messy the chicken kept sliding out the burger bun. I've tried a regular burger on gluten free bread, pretty good but the gf bread was gross. I've had way better. Overall I like the variety but I still prefer a licks burger and this location is always packed."}
{"text":"6ounce egg burger with fries combo is everything. Had me full for hours. The price is staggering though ($14) but if it wasn't for that, no other complaints."}
{"text":"This review is written from the perspective of a vegetarian. I have never eaten the other menu options. I assume that people enjoy this place because it is always packed, but this review is negative based on my experience as a vegetarian.   I enjoy Hero Burger and was excited to have one open up at York Lanes. I have went there several times and have always been disappointed. I am a vegetarian, so there are limited options available to me at this burger place (like any other burger place). My burger has been consistently soft and soggy even after I asked to have it well done. My biggest annoyance was once when I went in here and it wasn't busy. I waited in a small line up, but when it finally came to my turn the cashiers ignored me. They laughed, texted, and talked to the cooks for around five minutes before one of the cooks directed their attention to me. I wanted to try the veggie poutine option, and was surprised to find that you have to buy a drink with it. I usually drink water with my meals and am not a fan of soda.  As a vegetarian I have also been bothered to notice that the cooks usually do not use gloves and do not wash their hands (unless asked) before preparing vegetarian meals. Maybe I should not be so picky about it seeing as I am eating in a fast food place but sometimes I have that craving and it would be nice to indulge it without having to be the \"picky\" customer."}
