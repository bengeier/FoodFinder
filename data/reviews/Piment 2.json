{"text":"Toute nouvelle adresse dans le Vieux-Montréal. Cuisine chinoise. La carte est intéressante et la table d'hôte proposée le midi est variée. Le service n'est malheureusement pas encore bien rodé et peu professionnel. A surveiller au cours des prochaines semaines."}
{"text":"The place was empty, and we found out why! We waited ages for the rude server to attend to us. The food was overpriced and looked like it belonged in a styrofoam clamshell container. We paid the bill and did not feel it was appropriate to tip given the quality of the service. At which point the owner stood by our table and demanded that we tip. He informed us that it was the law to tip in Montreal. We ended up tipping, but in hindsight we should have insisted he call the police if indeed we were breaking the law. A very unpleasant experience."}
{"text":"What can I say?  Go find a real Chinese restaurant elsewhere.  This one is for the tourists."}
{"text":"I was disappointed with my visit at Piment 2. It was very quiet on a Sunday night, we had the restaurant almost all to ourselves. The service was quick and efficient. We ordered dumplings for appetizers, they were ok, but not the flavourful and delicious dumplings I was expecting (I do better at home). The main course was the General Tao chicken, a classic. The sauce was delicious and they were hot and crunchy, but the chicken was like that of too many chinese restaurants : brown, greasy, with hard bits that make you wonder if you're really eating chicken... Overall, a disappointment, and we won't be going back."}
{"text":"its a very good chinese restaurant?has typical Chinese food but also has very nice decoration on the food. More like a French style Chinese restaurant with real Chinese food taste. I have to say the most best food are absolutely not on the menu, you have to ask the waiter to get the special from chef, 5 stars for the taste and look, hundred percent sure I'll go back for the food ."}
{"text":"WONDERFUL. We came on a Tuesday night and the restaurant was largely empty, but it seemed that the tables that were filled were mainly locals. The prices were extremely reasonable, the atmosphere is great, and the food was absolutely the best Chinese I have ever had. Not kidding. 

I got the Taiwanese Beef Noodle Soup, and ate it too fast to post a picture here. It had giant chunks of beef that just melted in my mouth and the broth was heavenly. It was large enough for two, as well! 

My boyfriend got the Taiwanese Fried Noodles, which had onions, shrimp, pork, and tons of thin noodles. Delish. I decidedly won, though. 

The wait staff was extremely friendly, and even gave us some free fruit for desert. He was knowledgeable about the city as well - pointed us in the direction of some free comedy shows! 

Come to this place! It was amazing!"}
{"text":"Seriously tasty Chinese!!!! Our hotel concierge recommended checking this charming restaurant out... we liked it so much we came back a second night. You have to order the dumpling chicken in peanut sauce. It's a tiny bit spicy but each bite gets better than the one before!
Ask for Tony as your server.. he is extremely fun and upbeat. 
We can't wait to come back!!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food, incredible environment, amazing service. We came here on vacation, and even though we're only here for a handful of days, we are coming back for more! Piment 2 is absolutely fantastic, and I can't have enough praise for them!"}
{"text":"We came here towards the end of the night, the place is huge and the person attending to us was very nice! 

We ordered a few starters including the firecracker dumplings, vegetable dumplings and a fried roll that was shaped as a square. Deep fried goodness! I enjoyed the firecrackers, the reminded me of spiky see urchins. 

Our main courses were shrimp with veggies, vegetable fried rice, and chicken mufoo. Everything was delicious and the portions were huge. We had a ton of leftovers and had we stayed an extra day in town, I would have wrapped up everything for a fine meal the following day."}
