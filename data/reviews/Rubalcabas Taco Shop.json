{"text":"Awesome. Great food. Lil commercial but I'm still satisfied. Me and my sister got the California burritos. Just a slight bit different then the ones back home were used to. Other than that. A plus"}
{"text":"1 star for the soda that was the best thing I had here. The Asada taco didn't have no taste, and the pork taco was burnt. The cashier was rude."}
{"text":"Stopped here for breakfast on the way to hike in the lake Meade national recreation area.   Got the eggs with chorizo.  It was great.  Served with beans, rice, and poco de gallo.  Also came with a large warm soft tortilla wrap.  Soo good.  We liked it so much we came back twice!"}
{"text":"Place is dirty got food poison food is not good at all they don't make anything fresh very very bad place to eat!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here 4 times for the past 3 weeks and can't get enough of their carne asada burrito! Super tasty and moist! My sister got me hooked from this place.

Their tres leches cake was also delicious. The texture was perfect. 

I've also tried their wings...yummy in my tummy:)"}
{"text":"Stopped by around 1am for some Carne Asada Nachos. It was $6.50 and enough for 2 people. We killed it!!"}
{"text":"I love LOVE this place! Yes is a hole in the wall and is not so pleasantly looking but it is worth it for the DELICIOUS FOOD! Food is amazing and they have specials all around. The have the best tasting shrimp cocktail and they don't skimp on the shrimp I love it! I live on 35minutes or so away and I drive that way just for their yummy food!"}

{"text":"We used to go to Roberto's all the time sense we move here from Arizona 3years ago and for the past 3 Months we have been coming here to Rubalcabas and they have not lets us down once it's an amazing flavor and staff is always friendly and make it like your at Abuelita's house! If your ever in this area have to stop and try! This is a Chile Verde chimichanga wet"}
{"text":"Best place to go for a quick yummy meal. My family and I've been going there for years we have never left disappointed."}
{"text":"Growing up in Hawaii leaves you EXTREMELY limited to mexican food, and so I grew up not liking mexican food. I don't like the beans, am not a fan of the rice and pretty much considered Taco Bell good mexican food. But oh my god, the food here is seriously making me reconsider mexican food. It's a complete hole in the wall place you would never think twice to stop by, but you should make it a point to. The serivce is awesome, the guys there are really nice and they don't skimp on the servings. Love, love, love the food here!"}
{"text":"I wanted a wet burrito.  I got a soggy mess! I couldn't even see the enchilada sauce because of all the sour cream and guacamole. I didn't order a combo but got one. I will not recommend to anyone. Unless you like soggy food"}
{"text":"Out of all the spanish places in vegas i fell in love with this place alot. Ive been here about 4 times now and every single time i never left dissapointed. Im a big meat head and believe me when i say they are very generous with their meat. Most places ill go to ill order something and theres barely anything on it and alot of vegies and what not, but this place never dissapoints."}
{"text":"Sometimes, you just need a good Taqueria, and this place really hit the spot!!! The nachos and coctel camaron were especially tasty!"}
{"text":"It's so hard for me to find carne Asada fries in Las Vegas. This place delivered 100 % !!! The fries even still tasted delicious when I reheated them later ! If you're into Asada fries definitely try these :)"}
{"text":"Foods great recommend carne asada fries or burrito. Place is a hole in the wall with some on point breakfast burritos as well. The decor sucks, but the food is all that matters"}
{"text":"I give this place 5 stars omg this is SALP yo mama stupid goodness. See my pictures. Lol omg two thumbs up all the way."}
{"text":"This is one of my most favorite places in Vegas.  The Chicken tacos are incredible.  It looks a little rough, but I'm staring to realize that places that don't look necessarily \"sterile\" are usually busy cooking up delicious food in the back, so cleaning is 2nd.  It's pretty off the strip and you don't go through the best side of town to get there, but do it anyway.  When's the next time you'll be in Vegas?  might as well venture off the strip a little."}
{"text":"....I must truly say I love this lil taco place I seriously ...if ya ask me they have the best sauce that they put on enchiladas and and tamales ...they got the sauce ;) lol 
But yeah I serious recommend the enchiladas tamales and hard tacos so leave with out trying the enchiladas..."}
{"text":"I love Rubalcabas Asada Fries! They also have chicken wings which are bomb AF. I like their service. I prefer their green salsa over the red. Their burritos are Pretty decent. I recommend their Chimichanga with shredded beef! Their prices aren't bad either!"}
{"text":"I found this place in high school/college days 10-15 years ago, used to eat here all the time. Moved out of the area a long time ago and just visited my dad nearby, remembered this place and came back and it was just as awesome as I recalled. The food is very authentic and delicious, always fast and piping hot. Everything on the menu is good and worth getting. The guys behind the counter are crazy nice, they treat my little girl like family. Hey, the area is a bit seedy and it's location is a little out of the way but the food and service are top quality."}
{"text":"This place has some delicious food. Can't wait to come back. I had the carne asada fries and was not disappointed, I also tried their burritos and it was delish."}
{"text":"Delicious!  My son asked to go twice on the same day.  We asked for an off-menu item and they had no problem making it and reasonably priced it."}
{"text":"They absolutely have the best carna asada fries in Las Vegas!!!!!!!!!
Food is hot and fresh!!!"}
{"text":"Great peeps!  Good 'ole mexicana grub. It's on the way to Lake Mead entoute to a day of boating and drinking - go figure, it's on Lake Mead Road. Tap it again on the way home. #4 is a trusty item!  Chips with awesome salsa, pickled carrots/onions/peppers. In short, great beer food!"}
{"text":"I've been eating here since I moved to this side of town and I love the food here. It has been consistent and I have never gotten bad service over the years. The staff is always professional and nice, I never have to wait long for an order which is good when everything is freshly cooked. I'm skeptical of Roberto's because if I order Carne Asada fries they are prepared by the time I get to the window. So, was the meat sitting around or were the fries? I prefer their food to Roberto's any day."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb.com. My husband and I work swing shift so it's hard to find places that are still open when we get off work where we can get a quick bite to eat (that isn't McDonald's). We drove by this place a few times and decided to try it and OMG IT WAS DEFINITELY WORTH IT. the food is amazing, the gentleman working was super nice and did I mention how good the food is?! My favorite is the carne asada fries with half carne asada, half lengua and even though I have to wait a few minutes, IT IS DEFINITELY WORTH IT. you must try it. So. Dang. Good.

They also have a little bit for everyone (from chilaquiles to chicken wings) and I have yet to try something I didn't like. 

Definitely stop in and give it a try!"}
{"text":"6-19-2015 - I stopped in this location for a quick burrito and some beans and rice.  The place was almost empty and I ordered a beef burrito and a side order of beans and rice.   My order came with the beans and rice in the burrito, and I did not reorder as I was in a hurry.  It did not come  on a plate,  just wrapped in paper,  They had a little station to add salsa, etc.  The burrito was ok but nothing special.  This was my only experience at this location and I can not rave about my food, or service like other reviews I read.  I did not get the rememberable thumbs up experience that a person gets after having had  something above average."}
{"text":"Well priced for large portions. The carne asada tacos and burritos are good. The staff is nice although usually they don't speak english. 

The nachos are good too. :)"}
{"text":"The carne asada french fries the bomb.com OMG sooo good I recommend you try it. Friendly and clean. The bathroom art is awesome"}
{"text":"OMG! I love love love love this place. It is wonderful. Typically when you go for a meal you end up in one of 4 scenarios:

1. Good Food + Good Price (Rubalcabas)
2. Bad Food + Bad Price
3. Bad Food + Good Price
4. Good Food+ Bad Price

Well I have had an opportunity to visit Rubalcabas Taco Shop on just about ten occasions and have found their food in the first category each time. They offer good sized portions at a value. The food is tasty and often leaves me wondering how they do it. I can never finish the chicken burrito and manage to finish it the follow day. Every time, it is fantastic. The service is good and they also have a decent condiment bar with salsa, veggies and limes. 

I would recommend anyone try this place once to see if they can at least agree the food is yummy and the price is fantastic."}
{"text":"I love this lull spot million times never then robertosvwell rounded lil mex spot monster sized taqitoes... Best enchiladas in town"}
{"text":"Quick and tasty! I had the taquitos and a quesadilla for a quick lunch break. They were friendly and the food was fresh. I'm so glad I Yelped this place!"}
{"text":"Good hole in the wall taco joint. Handy for a quick stop on the way home from work.  Super friendly employees."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall Mexican joint. Consistent quality. Friendly staff. I used to go to the taco place on the corner but now I only go to this joint when I need a quick bite to eat for lunch. My only complaint is that the carrots at the salsa bar seemed mushy...must be canned.

Also, they have surprisingly good chicken wings as well."}
{"text":"Still five stars all around! The flavor is spot on with anything I've ordered. The portions are huge and the price is right. My husband and I can order several things for under $20. The staff is always friendly. They also have daily specials for $5.99 that are very tasty. I love that their food isn't overly greasy and is made fresh. 
Some of our favorite items to order are the carnitas burrito with guacamole, beans, and pico, any one of their chimichangas are always huge and yummy, the fish tacos, chile relleno, and the al pastor taco salad. This place also gains points in my book for being open 24 hours!! Anytime the need for some solid Mexican munchies hits Rubalcabas is there!"}
{"text":"We eat here once or twice a week. My husband is extremely picky but they always accommodate his requests and are super nice about it. Some of our go-to favorites are the Rolled taco supreme, king breakfast burritos, chimichangas, Rubalcaba plate."}
{"text":"Still not disappointed. I stopped in the other night and had a Carne Asada Torta,Cheese quesadilla and a slice of Flan. The torta had a nice texture and was messy but delicious. They didnt skimp on cheese with my quesa. The flan was delicious and fresh and had the right amount of carmel taste. And overall the EMPLOYEES are super friendly."}
{"text":"Everybody loves Roberto's out here. But i LOVE Rubalcabas! I get carne fries pretty much everytime. 
Its close to my house, open 24hours & BOMB."}
{"text":"Total hole in the wall that you can pass by repeatedly and never even notice yet their tacos and nachos are amazing and definitely worth stopping for. When you are looking for great Mexican in the area of Nellis and Lake Mead-- this little shop definitely should be at the top of your list. Grab and go as the inside is more a fast food set up than a sit down diner-- and call ahead if you are craving tacos now."}
{"text":"I went to this place last Saturday after reading all the great reviews. However, after eating the Carne Asada burrito, which was mediocre at best and the salsa wasn't even hot. I was greatly disappointed by this place. I don't know if they changed chefs from all the other reviews, but this place isn't worth stopping by."}
{"text":"Ignacio likes this place for Menudo usually a couple times every month."}
{"text":"The food and service have been amazing for the 11 years I've been eating here. Those nachos....yum."}
{"text":"Ordered up al pastor fries and the chile relleno plate. The al pastor fries were good! I would give it a 4/5. The chile relleno, however, was not to my liking. the chile was too firm in my opinion. I am a fan of soft chile relleno. This chile was so firm that I had quite the difficulty cutting it with the plastic fork and knife. I will definitely try this place again I think, maybe explore the menu a bit more."}
{"text":"The staff could not understand my order in English; they should have people who can accommodate their customers and their orders. 
Once my food was done, it was all wrong after trying to explain to them exactly how I wanted my tacos. 
Besides that, the place was VERY dirty and had an unacceptable restroom with graffiti all over & a disgusting toilet which I did not even use.
Health department should review this place!!!
It's not right at all."}
