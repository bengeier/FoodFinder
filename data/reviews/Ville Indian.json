{"text":"Reasonably priced an quite tastey.  Service a bit mixed, really slow the first time too quick the second. I will be back."}
{"text":"This is definitely not authentic Indian! My wife and i paid over $70 for a table d'hôte that didn't even come close to what we get in Montréal for half the price. The dishes we ordered seemed watered down, the chicken tandoori tasted like it was warmed up from yesterday, the naan bread was dense, and tasted like those we buy at IGA or Costco. The butter chicken, well what can I say: chicken extremely dry and the sauce well far from the creamy thick sauce I am used to. At least service was good!  It's too bad, my wife and I were so looking forward to and Indian experience close to our home, unfortunately this was not the case."}
{"text":"Pas clair. Trop cher pour la qualité et la quantité, mais toutefois correct pour s'éviter une virée à Parc ex."}
