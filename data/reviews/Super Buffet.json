{"text":"Checked out Super Buffet for the first time today at lunch time, and enjoyed it very much.  The soup station is great with both savory and sweet variety.  There is even lobster soup.  I had the Hot & Sour soup, it could be a bit thicker and more spicy for my taste.  Also had the sweet tofu soup, very good and brings back nice memories of childhood!  The main warm food stations provided lots of seafood selection that are fresh and tasty.  I especially enjoyed Honey glazed oyster and Mussels.  The Sushi table is of great quality for a buffet.  Grill table looks good but I was too full to try any.

Icing on the cake is that the buffet is free on your birthday month when you go with 3 other friends."}
{"text":"I love the open kitchen here, which allows you to choose many stuff of your choice and ask them to cook the way you want it! 

Though has only less stuff than Mandarin, I like this place more."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what the big hype over this buffet is. My boyfriend really likes this place but I'm neutral about it!

Decor- a tad below average of Mandarin 
Food- good, but nothing to write home about
Service- good

I believe they have a birthday special, and crab legs."}
{"text":"Super Buffet is cheap and that's about all that is good for. You really get what you pay for here. 

The restaurant is dirty (tables, silverware, floors, even the walls are splattered with oils and food.), in poor repair (burnt out light bulbs, dents in the walls etc) and poorly/cheaply decorated. Everything looks worn out and in need of a complete overhaul. It's a completely depressing place to eat. 

We waited an hour for a 9 person table and they ended up sitting us at separate tables. The maitre d station is completely disorganized and can't figure out how to accommodate larger parties. (no problem seating parties of 6 since that's their max table size). We had many parties of 6 bypass us before they decided to seat us at separate tables. No accommodation to put the tables together. 

The food is nothing special same food you find anywhere, maybe 20 items, 5 item dim sum selection, 5 sushi rolls and a make your own stir fry section (the only good tasting thing here). 

This place makes little effort. You come to eat here when you want to eat your feelings until you hate yourself and not want to pay much for it. 

For comparison this place isn't even half as good as the mandarin."}
{"text":"We had arrived just 10 mins after opening and it was a zoo!  Appears the regulars know to come early; it would not surprise me that the ones already seated when we got there were door crashers!!  

It's a Western style Asian buffet with no shortage of fried favorites like chicken wings, chicken balls, and fried rice. 

The restaurant is large and can handle large parties with the most common table size of 4. 

I must confess I have a soft spot for buffets, especially ones that offer something different from the norm. I enjoy the hunt for the unique items. 


The highlight for me was the wok station where one can assemble their own stir fry / soup with the vegetables and meats/seafood available. You also have a choice of sauces like garlic, satay, and oyster. 
 
The draw was the price but was it worth it?

$7.99 for Tuesday lunch it delivers good value. There are number of selections from a variety of Asian cuisines to please. 



Some super random fact, this location used to be Mr. Wong's long ago then Orientalis now Super Buffet."}
{"text":"Not a whole lot of food choices and a lot of the dishes weren't really that great. I was really disappointed with the desserts. The service was pretty good. They regularly took away our plates and made sure we had water. 

It was $18.55 for Saturday lunch. I would rather pay more for Mandarin."}
{"text":"The name says it all!!  It`s a good deal for a buffet. The Chinese dishes are of average buffet quality, but I shudder at the other dishes like the prime rib and sushi.   The selection of main dishes is pretty large, but there isn't much choice for desserts, salad, or fruit.  But did I mention it's cheap?

If you're going for non-ghettoness though, you might want to try Mandarin or Dragon Pearl."}
{"text":"This is the closest buffet to me, so I've been here quite a bit, but usually only for special occasions.

I did go here though on their half price Tuesday's. If you're looking to get a quick bite, Tuesday's wouldn't be the day to go. I think my boyfriend and I waited at least a minimum of 30 mins ... Though I think it was longer.

Food is great, but not Mandarin quality. The dessert options are poor though."}
{"text":"Not a fan. I've come here plentiful times for family gatherings and I can say that with every time I've dined here; I find all my experiences to be pretty bland. Some of the meats don't have any flavour and the sushi at all times (let's be real) is pretty bad. To be fair, I would much rather go to Mandarin or Star Walk - at least the experience has a little bit of an edge in comparison. May come back for future gatherings but not on thine own will."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I've been here 6 or 7 times over the past 5 years. It's been great every time. Their prices have gone up a few dollars over the past few years but it's not significant. They have also added new things to the menu such as peking duck and lobsters. They have a great variety that caters to all races and palates. I love their crab legs. They are very fresh. I only wish they had melted butter to serve with it. They have unlimited lobsters on Sundays. They serve tray by tray at a fairly reasonable speed. One lobster per person per line up. So if you want another lobster, you have to line up again. The dinner costed 27.99 per person. If you go on your birthday,  you will get a free meal if you bring 3 other people with you. It's a pretty good deal. For dessert my personal favorite is their taro tapioca.  The atmosphere is pretty good. Lots of space. The bathrooms are big and they keep it quite clean.  For the quality and price,  it's my favourite Chinese buffet in the area."}
{"text":"*THIS PLACE IS STILL OPEN*

[Service]
It's all-you-can-eat so there is no service lols. Anyways this place is a joke but I paid $10.99 for lunch...I don't mind running the whole place by myself. I'm warning you right now, you need to go up to the waiters and tell them what you want. No one will care about you. The only good thing is, they will collect your dishes and give napkins out faster than other restaurants. Anyways, go on Tuesdays or Fridays so you get the special discount!

[Food]
Honestly it sucks, it sucks balls but it was better than some of the buffets in Las Vegas (like the ones you do under the buffet of buffets deal). I'm going to recommend some dishes because they were legit okay:
- Mushrooms (teriyaki/grilled)
- Soup (lots of MSG but to the tongue it was fabulous)
- Veggies (thank god they didn't mess this up)
- Dessert (I'm talking about the soup-based ones)
- Fried chicken wings (super crunchy skin, I like lols)

Although it was not a good buffet I also think for this price, you can't beat it. I haven't had diarrhea after eating it (positive!) and my stomach was filled to the top. I thought the soup weren't bad, but I'm a soup person."}
{"text":"6/10 for quality. 8/10 for service. 6/10 for value. 6/10 Overall (not an average).

Came here for Wednesday dinner for the 15.99 special. Here's the gist.

- Came here expecting steamed snow crab legs. Instead, we got this marinated crab of some sort (not sure what kind). Flavor was decent, but only the claw had some meat in it. The legs had very little meat, and was a lot of work to work through it. After just one plate, I thought it wasn't worth the time to get any more crab legs. 5/10
- This \"5 flavor duck\" was possibly the best flavored duck I've had in a while. 9/10.
- Sushi was probably not worth touching (though I had maybe 4 pieces of salmon sushi) 3/10
- Ribs were pretty good, but many of them were more fat than meat. 7/10
- Tofu dessert was decent. 8/10
- Fried shrimp was decent 7/10
- Most ice cream were all half melted before I scooped them. Also not a lot of variety. 4/10

Conclusion: probably won't be coming back."}
{"text":"The worst buffet I've had. We had to wait like half an hour before getting seated. Even the group that came after us got seated first. The quality of food and the selection was very poor. Everything tasted off. Even some cheap food court Chinese food woulda tasted better. I just didn't like anything about it. And I believe its super expensive for bad food. It cost around $25 pp after taxes for dinner on a weekend. Blah"}
{"text":"$25 per person for sunday dinner, half a lobster. A lot of crab legs, cooked / cold version.

Nothing memorable that would make me want to come back for or crave. it's good for large groups/families.

cons:
only 4 or 5 ice cream flavours.
not a lot of choices
the dim sum was unpopular items
the lobster was just steamed, should give options of flavours

pro: 
lots of fresh fruit choices
noodle bar to make your own fried/soup/steamed noodles
good choices for desserts
the honey garlic oysters was good
sushi was OK."}
{"text":"Been going here every Tuesday since I don't remember! 

The prices have changed from 7.99 to 8.99 for Tuesday lunch. I don't mind it but the reason they lost a star with me was when I first booked an event with them they were super friendly, very helpful, very understanding. We booked the private room away from the crowd. That was a success and I was very pleased with them.

But when I went to go book another event for July 1 I wanted the private room as described in my first event with them. Over the phone they reassured me and asked to go in and put a deposit. A deposit was made but when the day came we were NOT in the room I wanted, I have a huge family and this event took place on Canada Day. Although I know I didn't get the same price as last event and I understand that it was a holiday as simple as giving me the room I wanted so that it would be easier to push out people who didn't belong there! I didn't have a table like before to place the cake, and gifts. But looks like in every room you are able to hook up your stuff like for a photo slideshow, video, and karaoke! I guess it wasn't all a lost cause but still!

Which if you do decided to do a party be ready for people to walk in looking for a seat, the staff is already busy sometimes they are able to help with people that don't belong there but when its a zoo you cant blame them if they cant help 1 or  2 people trying to come in. Especially if they look like part of the family.

Anyway the food was great as usual, for those thinking if its even worth it...It really is they have this station where they will make you our own stir-fry or soup with whatever your heart desires. sushi station with really good sushi an a huge assortment, dessert station which includes mango and green tea ice creams, then two stations of hot foods and a station for cold foods, and last but not least ready made soups, dumplings. oh and on Sunday's there is a seafood platter in the hot dish station with cooked seafoods meaty claws of goodness! its one container that gets refilled often!"}
{"text":"this place technically isn't closed. apparently they changed bosses or whatever and it got renamed to Scarborough buffet.com (which i mean no offence it's pretty dumb but whatever) 

went here a few times before the change, and it was alright. i only really liked the steamed sweet egg and those long king crab legs (this is the place where i developed my hatred for medium-rare to rare meat OH GOD BIT INTO A PIECE AND BLOOD OOZED OUT DEAR GOD) 

so i went here with my family on Boxing Day and it was a huge disappointment. don't get me wrong some of the food actually tasted pretty decent like it ain't bad but ALL OF THE FOOD WAS LEGIT COLD like not a speck of heat to be detected like it looked hot but once it lands into your mouth it's like the North Pole hella cold. my dad was complaining the whole time and thing was, this buffet ain't cheap. im surprised no one ever complained like how can y'all just eat cold food IS IT TO COMPENSATE FOR THE LACK OF SNOW OR WINTER WE HAVE IN CANADA WHY DO YOU CRAVE THE COLD?! anyways just a pretty upsetting buffet to eat at now after the change (and i was so excited too-_-) 

***they have pretty good mash potatoes (im a mashpotato fanatic) i got it every time i was looking for more food and legit the cookers were eyeballing me to the max (i think i took at least half of what they had LOOOL)"}
{"text":"It may not seem like much on the outside, but I was really impressed with GDSB.

My family booked one of the private rooms on a Saturday afternoon. There were at least 40-50 of us seated in one of the back rooms and we had separate wait service.

GSDB offers some typical Chinese offerings you would find in any other Chinese buffet, but they go as far as to offer a Mongolian grill area, a sushi bar, salad and fruit bar, raw bar, dessert bar, and even an awesome dim sum bar. They have a huge selection which I appreciate because there's something for everyone.

Notable mentions:
- black bean mussels - huge mussels in black bean sauce
- sesame seed balls - so fresh and crisp on the outside and sweet and moist on the inside
- sushi
- dim sum bar complete with steamed pork buns, shumai, and tofu fa or \"douhua\" (my personal favorite)

Service: Wait staff was quick and accommodating.  They were prompt in re-filling drinks and providing tea and beverages. They were also on top of replenishing the buffet area.

GSDB surely attracts big groups and families and seems like a hit with the locals. This is a solid place for authentic Chinese food. I would definitely return during my next visit."}
{"text":"My dad loves buffets, aka we go to a new one almost every week (I don't know how I'm not a fat kid rolling off the streets of Toronto already). Just like Carmen T's dad, my father also loves this place.

I've been here so many times, and each time it was great. They have a wide variety of Asian dishes to choose from including oysters (cooked in sauce or raw), Peking duck, crabs, crab legs, and they even have a section where you kind of make your own meal. you choose your own meats, veggies and noodle and they'll stir fry it for you, or put it in a broth for you. 

The service is actually pretty amazing for a Chinese buffet. Repeat, CHINESE buffet. I've worked years in the service industry, and I know for a fact that the Chinese aren't exactly the best at tipping (Before you say anything, I'm also Chinese myself with parents who don't \"believe\" in tipping.... haha). I get better service here then I do at some really nice places. The servers are attentive and are always ready to replace your dishes and hand you more napkins. 

Also if it's your birthday month (*NOT just birthday date, but any time of that month you were born!!*) and you go with 4 adults, IT'S FREE. It typically cost around $23 for a weekend dinner which is pretty standard anyways. This is also another reason why my dad like to come here every other 2 weeks as my family's birthdays are all spread out. 

The only negative thing I have to say here is also their sushi bar. i'm a huge fan of sushi and their selection is just the typical California roll and a couple other rolls you can get at take out. They have mediocre sashimi, but I can't except too much because they do have pretty much everything else I love. 

The ambiance is kind of just like Mandarin, it's not really fancy but kind of tacky. I don't expect anything more though.

Overall, this place is great for less casual family gatherings, and really for pigging out. Enjoy :)"}
{"text":"What I love about thisr  place is how you can choose your own veggies, meat and sauce and they will cook a dish fresh for you.  I didn't do it this time but AJ made a yummy curried chicken/shrimp dish. 

The only problem I had was trying to be good & eat fairly healthy. They did have some roasted chicken breast that was good to go with some salad.. I'm so glad they have seaweed salad in the salad buffet."}
{"text":"whoever says mandarin is better than this place must be working for mandarin. admittedly neither of these 2 places will ever make the list at zagat or an epicurean magazine but give me a break, super buffet is not bad at all. you may even be surprised if you come for dinner on a weekend and have some really fresh salmon sashimi or steamed crabs, all you can eat.. my tummy, wallet and taste buds were happy."}
{"text":"Definitely not my place of choice for a buffet experience.
There is a good selection and a wide variety of foods, but really made me cringe when I saw the atmosphere. Was not at all pleased by the very slow service and rather apathetic nature on their part.

Nothing too special to report food wise-nothing stuck out...seems to me like it is the average cookie cutter type of buffet.

I will note that the stir fry option is an interesting twist, but cannot comment on this since I did not bother."}
{"text":"I had not been to a mid-priced Chinese buffet for a while, because I didn't recall a good experience in recent memory.  Super Buffet changed this perception last Wednesday ($21 per person). Seriously, most items tasted decent, ranging from okay to good.  

Good: appetizer station, soy sauce chicken, BBQ pork, sashimi, long green beans, tofu dessert
Okay: king crab legs, steamed fish, snow peas, black bean mussels
Not so okay: sushi

The restaurant was not busy, so the services was attentive.  Empty plates were immediately removed.  The ladies washroom was clean and tidy.  

I guess if I want to eat at a mid-priced Chinese buffet again, Super Buffet will be at the top of the list."}
{"text":"I've come here one too many times for AYCE dinners. Prices are lower on Tuesdays and if you come here on your birthday its free but you can't come alone on your birthday and eat for free if that's what you are thinking. There is a good assortment of food - Chinese and Japanese mostly. On one occasion they had lobster but of course it wasn't that great and extremely salty. It usually gets snatched up once it comes out but after about 2 pieces I couldn't eat anymore as it was too disappointing. There is also sushi and salmon sashimi. I usually fill up on the salmon. And the only other dish I like here is the tofu soup dessert. Its made fresh and super smooth and you can add as much sweetener as you want. Worth one try if you want to have AYCE. Slightly better than Mandarin in my opinion."}
{"text":"Went for my Cousin-In-Law's new son's 1 month old party.  The restaurant was booked on the side for us for the buffet.

This review is only based on the sushi as I only ate this at the party.

With someone who has anaphylaxis to shellfish, I found that the sushi did not have any traces of it.  This is because they did not have much variety and my throat did not even react the slightest.  Good for me!  Although, the salmon negri was touching the tail of a shrimp negri.  

I had many pieces of:
salmon maki rolls
salmon negri
Philadelphia rolls
spicy salmon rolls

My only concern is that the salmon in the maki rolls were a bit fatty and the spicy salmon rolls were not spicy at all.  The Philadelphia rolls were truly tasty.  I actually loved them though the raw onion can be pretty strong.  I know that in other buffets there is more variety but everything was okay.

In my opinion, go for the Chinese food.  Sushi is only a plus.  They had more of a variety for that."}
{"text":"I loved it! The food was grreat, the servers very attentive but never 'in your face'. We were stuffed and happy when we left today. It's not too pricey and what can I say, was able to carry on a great conversation with my Son AND enjoy great food! Had a lovely afternoon there and would not hesitate to highly recommend it to others!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed eating here,  it's a buffet restaurant and the selection of food is pretty good. I really enjoyed their green tea ice cream and sushi.  As for the service it was good too.   They were also very reasonable regarding the price.   One of my friends was fasting that day so she didn't have anything to eat except a bubble tea,  so they didn't charge her the full amount,  just for the bubble tea,  which I thought was very good of them to do so.   Overall it was a great dinner.   I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"My dad loves this buffet! We always have our family dinners here. They have a wide variety of foods to choose from and they also have a station that you can customize your own noodle soup! Their variety of food has gotten better as the years progressed and also the cooking as well. The previously years I've went, most foods were overly salted but the recent time I've went, it is definitely on point!

As a seafood lover, you can find me at the seafood stations. They have cold and hot king crab legs and also cooked small blue crabs. The day I went, there was also Peking Duck. I'm not sure if it was just for that day or whether it's a new offer but the previously times I've been, there weren't any. They also have a sushi bar but the sushi there is mediocre.. which is kind of disappointing but the seafood definitely makes up for it. 

They have birthday specials when you go with at least 4 people. When you go with 4 people, the birthday person is free! Just remember to bring ID to get your free meal!"}
{"text":"It was okay. The staff was not rude nor friendly. Food was replenished within a reasonable amount of time. 

The only thing I was not happy about was when they did not honour the coupon I brought in. It was Dec 31 when my family and I went out to dinner. We had a coupon that said it was '\"valid thru Dec 31\". Of course, there was a small disclaimer that said \"restaurant reserves the rights to make change of the coupon without prior notification\". However, I feel that it should have said valid thru Dec 30. So they said it was because today is New Year's Eve, we could not use the coupon. Did you not know that Dec 31 was New Year's Eve when you made the coupon? Did you think that Dec 32 was New Year's Eve? 

Anyway... I might go back if family wanted to, but I wouldn't be the first to suggest it."}
{"text":"Super Buffet is awesome. I have been here twice so far, once for lunch and once for a Sunday dinner. They offer lobster for Sunday dinner, but you're limited to 2 halves per person. Lunch is the better value option and is even better during a birthday, where you get a free meal (requires 3 paying adults).

The place is pretty clean and the waiters are fairly attentive in terms of taking away empty plates and refilling water.

The food is really good for a buffet. It's certainly not high quality fancy stuff like at Yang's, but is definitely a huge step up from college-town buffets. There is a lot of variety -- rice dishes, noodle dishes, dim sum, soups, vegetable dishes, sushi, etc. They even have a station where you pick ingredients for the chef to cook. We chose some Chinese spinach and shrimp. On my last visit, the things that stood out were the fried oysters (what!? at a buffet?) and baked sweet potatoes. There are also a variety of desserts, including cakes, fresh fruit (pineapples, cataloupe, strawberries), and my favorite -- coconut macaroons!

We're definitely coming back here."}
