{"text":"Very good chips and salsa.  The food was good.  I would go back, but I'm also not ranting and raving about it.  Not really a margarita fan but we ordered a pitcher anyway.  It was a pretty generous sized pitcher.  :)   Our waitress was very nice and helpful.  You don't find that much these days.  The one thing this place is really lacking is atmosphere.  I seriously thought Ashton Kutcher was going to pop out and tell someone they were on Punk'd....the restaurant looked that \"fake\" and was very un-inviting and just, well, odd."}
{"text":"We love this place. Many nights the owner is the one making you your Margarita- which are strong. They make a Pomegranate Margarita which is extremely good. The Seafood selections are actually amazing- never thought I'd like a seafood mexican dish til I had one here. Lunch specials are very good and the menu is reasonably priced. The atmosphere is nice with lower lighting - we enjoy sitting at the bar or on the new patio they built last year. Overall- worth a visit."}
{"text":"I love that every time I eat here, the salsa is just a little bit different!  Proves it's homemade.  Always ask for both hot and mild.  My absolute favorites:  The empanadas and the cheese enchiladas.  A decent margarita.  Bathrooms are very clean- I ALWAYS look for that!"}
{"text":"I been here before and wasn't impressed but decided to stop by again because a new banner outside stated it had a new menu nd was under new management. Luchita's always had pretty good food but was priced for gourmet Mexican cuisine. It just wasn't worth it.  To summarize my experience this time around, I'll say the menu had crusted food on it and looked like it was printed on a very low quality home printer, the pork burrito had hard rice and tough pork, and the chips were very hard & thick (not very good). The place was without their usual liquor license so I couldn't try a drink. The server assured me it would be restored soon. The prices didn't seem to have come down at all and the food was lower quality than I remember. Hostess didn't seem to receive any training but wasn't rude either. Not a good dining experience.  If you are looking for a very good and inexpensive Mexican dining experience, I have never been disappointed in Fiesta Jalepeno's in North Ridgeville. A bit more casual atmosphere, but great food and margaritas."}
