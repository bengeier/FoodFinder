{"text":"This is by far, my favorite place for a cocktail in the city. We went here after a game last year for a few dranks.  I had my first ever Pina Colada. It was definitely a sweet treat.  The clientele here was nice and the waitstaff helpful. The best part was watching the fireworks on the porch at the back of the bar, postgame. It was a great atmosphere and solid experience."}
{"text":"Here for pattys day, the waitress gave us wrong beers, they have no green beer and no pitcher specials. On top of that they're playing crappy techno music. Luckily they have $7 sandwiches. I don't see why they opened today."}
{"text":"Strange.  Really strange.  Maybe going here on Halloween was a mistake...  I was the only guy there not dressed as a geisha.  Again, strange.  Punk rock band from Canada dancing and performing on stage.  OK.  Brought their parents to see them.  Strange.  Some guy is filming it.  OK.  On his phone.  Strange.  Bartender has an awkward expression, sort of like one might have if one's clergyman gave him a sex toy for his birthday.  A few local customers are crushed up against the wall as if someone on stage was releasing cooties into the air.  All of it just so strange.  So what do you do?  I say sit your butt down, buy the nice guy in a japanese dress a drink and enjoy the show!  Pretty soon you're doing shots, dancing like an idiot and stumbling out into the street hoping you didn't give anyone your real phone number!    The Thirsty Parrot is the strangest place I've been in several years.  I had a decent time there.  The bartender was solid and the beer was cold.  I might go back someday, just not on Halloween!"}
{"text":"We were in town for a baseball game and heard the wings here were good. I would give them 3-3.5 as they were pretty good. You couldn't split your order with two different sauces which was disappointing.   Service was good prices seemed excellent but I live in Chicago so everything seems cheaper. I would go back for the wings again. We also loved the atmosphere and how close it was to everything else."}
{"text":"I thought this was a good place for a pre-game drink or three. Prices were reasonable and the highlight came when the bartender  offered us a shaker full of \"riverwater\". Basically they dumped a bunch of liquor into this shaker, and handed it to us with a strainer and shot glasses. Definitely looked like riverwater, a nasty brown, but the taste....well it wasn't bad. Each shot we poured from the same shaker tasted different. And at $10 for the shaker, we got eleven shots. Not bad."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, before and during cleveland sports games.  Neither time was I impressed by the crowd, drinks, service, or setting.  Two stars sums it up: \"Meh. I've experienced better\"."}
{"text":"Went here after an Indians game and received the worst service I have ever encountered. Bartender would not let us order drinks off the menu because they were \"out\" of it. Other bartender told they closed in 30 minutes. If you own a bar and close at 9 on a Thursday you shouldn't be in the business. No hours posted anywhere to be found and no one answers the phone when you call for that information. Plenty of other great bars in Cleveland to choose from."}
{"text":"We visited this bar two nights in a row and had the most amazing experience ever. Our waitress Alex was so nice and gave us such great service. Even though our ball games got rained out, the staff took amazing care of us. They remembered us each time we came in and all of the locals were so friendly. We will definitely be back to the Thirsty Parrot!"}
{"text":"Thirsty Parrot is nothing more than a stadium bar with a restaurant attached. I think it's a good place to hang out. Carribean theme is summery and fun.   Drinks we're relatively strong for a stadium bar. Served in plastic cups of course. My friend and I ordered a shaker of Parrot Punch and another of the Cuyahoga River Water. Both were good and strong enough to make it a good buy, though to call drinks of this 'shots' is a misnomer. You can drink this stuff straight easily.  So we ordered some food too. My cheeseburger was incredible for a stadium bar type place. Perfectly melted cheese. Quality toppings. Wow, what a great deal. My friend got a buffalo chicken wrap and he said it was realllly hot and saucy. Both were served with ranch-seasoned potato chips. The seasoning was great, but the plain chips that didnt get any seasoning weren't as good.  This is a bar where you will run into herds of 21-26 year olds getting blasted before or after Cleveland sporting events. If you expect that going in, you will not be disappointed by the Thirsty Parrot."}
{"text":"A very cool place to hangout before a Tribe game.  I suggest getting there at least 2 hours early if you'd like to snag a table outside.  Reasonable pricing.  Found the staff to be incredibly helpful and prompt."}
{"text":"They bill this as a Caribbean bar but it is no more Caribbean than Jack in the Box. Not a bad place to stop and have beers before an Indians game, but the apps are pretty standard and the liquor selection is mainstream. There are some fru-fru drinks inviting hangovers, but I would stick with beer here."}
{"text":"My friend and I followed the Nelly music from Progressive Field and ended up here. We stayed for about an hour and had a great time. Nice music. Nice prices. Fun crowd. Great location!"}
{"text":"Went here after a baseball game on a Monday night. Is there life in Cleveland?!  How is it possible for like 10 people to be at a bar right accross the street from a baseball stadium. Even on a Monday night that is no excuse. Anyways, This place is pretty cool. The inside is all wood fixtures and looks kind of like a Hooters. The outside has nice patio with a bar. The bartender was really cool and the beer was cheap. I would go back for sure."}
{"text":"Thirsty Parrot by far is the most diverse place in 5 points..The Thirsty Parrot is laid back, predominantly for people of color...it has a healthy mix of women.the best part is the women heavily outnumbered women but it was enough not for me to complain I was very satisfied. Saturday is a great night to go..  Good drink specials $9 pitchers..cant beat it,..So I will give 4 out of 5 beers"}
{"text":"Great outdoor bar and live DJ. It's right next to Progressive Field and the Q so it's a great place to hang out at before game time."}
{"text":"As mentioned previously, thirsty parrot is a typical stadium bar with no higher aspirations.  The televisions are a little old, but it's a good place to watch the game if you don't have tickets.  Burger was good, but don't get the chips.  Substitute for fries.  Chips were over cooked."}
{"text":"Location is great: right outside center field from the baseball stadium. The outdoor patio is great for sunny days before or after games. The crowd is also lovely and fun. But the overpriced bad beer knocks this down to a 3 star spot."}
{"text":"Thirsty parrot has a nice patio and good drink specials. I've never eaten here but they have a huge space to hang out with friends and have some drinks before/after/during games! Fun spot to visit."}
{"text":"A staple for all Indians games. Before, during or after all summer long.  They usually have ticket give aways for Friday night games but criteria changes how to win then. Food is solid bar food. Tall boy cans are half the price here instead of inside the stadium so drink 'em fast. No Bud products. Only PBR, Miller Lite & Labatt in cans. Overall one of the better places to go in the summer in Cleveland before Indians games.  See you on opening day 2014"}
{"text":"Great service, reasonably priced drinks, and a fun atmosphere. It didn't look like a place I'd actually want to eat at. It was right across from Progressive Field and had a huge deck and a good crowd.    I usually go here before concerts or games and always have a great time."}
{"text":"Came here before the Indians game. It conveniently located for a quick bite before the game, good ambiance but was disappointed by the lack of selection of food on the menu. They have a small choice of burgers and appetizers and thats that. The food was decent but nothing to rave about. I liked the music they were playing. We sat outside and seemed the music could have been a little lower...too loud is not good for socializing. You'd think this was a party the music was so loud."}
{"text":"Skip the game and just hang out here. So close to the stadium, all the pre game is here. Cheap beer, great waitstaff. Huge crowd hangs out and goes late to the game. By the time they clear out, the early leavers from the game are coming back. They have the game on TV. I came back for the fireworks. Great view from the bar."}
{"text":"We stop by the thirsty parrot after leaving an Indians game to kill some time before leaving downtown.  It looks like an average bar with a great outdoor patio.  The day we went it was extremely hot outside and I don't think they had any air on.  Though all the windows were up.  The drinks were good and pretty cheap- which is a major win in my book!  I don't believe they serve any food- which was a bummer but there is a bbq place right next door if you do get hungry.  I think this place is a great option to hangout before/during/after an Indians game because it is right across the street from the stadium.  I will be back for sure in the near future."}
{"text":"The service I had was okay at best. It was a full bar so it's too be expected. The beer selection is okay and they offer some house mixed drinks but it's definitely a sports bar. Not the place to go for signature craft cocktails but perfect place to pre-game before heading to an Indians or Cavs game!"}
{"text":"My first Indians day game in 10+ years, wow. So, my friend and I stopped at the Thirsty Parrot for a drink before hand.   It is a stadium bar, with a vague Carribean theme and heavy use of aqua.   Their beer selection was typical: domestics plus a Great Lakes and Sam Adams. Their drink special was a 24oz can of coors for $5.00.   Their patio is the largest near the Jake [AKA: Progressive Field] [besides Panini's] with several round tables and an outdoor bar.   Maybe it was because it was a day game, but my friend and I were the only people there under 30 or 35. It was mostly boomers wearing jean shorts and not my atmosphere.   This was my first visit to the thirsty Parrot and probably my last. If you'd like a patio near the Jake/Progressive Field and looking for a drink before or after the game, it's an option, but there are also plenty of other bars nearby too."}
{"text":"The owner was rude to my party. We held a company event there and one of the members of our party was verbally assaulted by another person at the bar. This person was a good friend of the manager and we were asked to leave. Otherwise drinks were average and they do have a nice patio, but none of us will visit again."}
{"text":"The Thirsty Parrot IS the place to go before Indians games to get a drink, MAYBE a bite to eat.  It seems to be the place to go and I couldn't imagine how busy the other places would get if this bar didn't exist with its enormous deck.    I've had chicken wings and a chicken sandwich here before and they were both good so feel free to order some food up while you are there.  For the most part I just go there for the beer pregame, and for that such need of mine to be fulfilled as nicely as it does at the Parrot, they get a 4 star rating."}
{"text":"I came here before and after the Indians game and I had A LOT of fun. I have no idea how this place is when a game isn't being played but if you're heading to an Indians game, this seems like your best bet.   Drinks were dirt cheap. And they have a really nice outdoor patio.   Also, we got here after the game before the fireworks started (it was fireworks night when we went!). Sitting out on the patio gave us a great view."}
{"text":"We wanted a decent lunch before the baseball game & wanted a new place. The drinks were good. The food was awful! The burgers were way overdone & dry. The wings were terrible, & even the fried apps were over cooked!  Just go for the drinks"}
{"text":"We didn't eat. I'm always a little skeptical of Caribbean themed bars in very non-tropical areas. But large open space for indoor seating, plenty of room at bars, huge patio, and ideal Gateway location for Tribe and Cavs make it worth a stop. I was told the $15 minimum on cards is when they're busy to discourage 20-somethings from closing tab after every drink. Although we never have a problem ordering $15 worth anyway. Decent drink selection."}
{"text":"$3 Coors light tall boys... enough said.  We went here to pregame for an indians game and it was empty when we arrived, about 2 and a half hours before the game, but was packed by the time we went over to see first pitch.   We got the mozzarella wedges for an appetizer and they were awesome. Almost got the nachos and were glad we didn't since the guys next to us ordered them and they looked like they were lacking much toppings... all chip not much cheese.   There's an outside patio but we opted for inside since it was about 90 outside. The inside was open air as well but was somewhat cooler.   All in all you can't go wrong as a pregame place of the Indians games so long as you're looking to drink... not so much eat. Also, the mixed drinks they were pouring looked STRONG."}
{"text":"Visited this bar for a drink on a Sunday afternoon. The patio is big with alot of room and perfect for a sunny day. There was a bar outside so we decided to sit at a table on the patio. Too bad we only sat out there for 10 mins because the place is covered in bees and other bugs. Couldn't go a minute without a bee flying around us. We moved to the inside and sat at the bar. Saw some food being delivered to a customer next to us and it looked absolutely disgusting."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to hang out. My first time here was your typical first time at a bar before a baseball game. We didn't wait longer than a minute or two for drinks even though they were packed. So that was really nice. We ordered the pretzel and the house made chips, both were good bar food. Great patio and great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"We went here after an Indians game. It was busy and lively. An interesting mixture of young people and old(er) people. We got drinks quickly and didn't see any fights. So overall a success."}
{"text":"Ended up here instead of entering the game, and saved a ton of money.  For being downtown and a stone's throw from Jacob's Field, it's got awesome drink deals.  'Pitchers' of decent shots for $10, Miller Lite Pounders $3, not bad.    Pretty slow during the game, even on a Friday night.  I was bummed to hear that they stopped serving food after the SECOND INNING, about 8pm, which is just silly.  I'm sure 80% of the food is just thrown in the fryer, can't imagine why they wouldn't want to make some more money and have their customers stay around longer.  (Our solution was to get take out from Wilberts next door and bring it back.)  The patio is the reason we stayed, having to secure the seats for the firework show at the stadium.  It will do as a patio for pre and post Tribe games.  Nothing special, it works.  Go Tribe."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good and the beer selection was great! Loved being able to sit on the patio, the patio was massive and had great service. I ordered the Buffalo chicken wrap, but I was most impressed with their French fries! Woah! Such an interesting cut but very well prepared! The best part is the location in relation to the Venues!! Wow! So close and convenient!! Definitely a must if you're going to watch the Indiana or going to The Q."}
{"text":"I was visiting Cleveland and was looking for a place to grab a drink between Indians games.  I saw a bunch of people out on the patio area and thought I'd check it out, obviously if there's a lot of people out there then you know it must be good.    The staff was friendly, we were seated right away but unfortunately we weren't able to sit outside due to the large crowd.  The waitstaff was on top of our drinks and we never had an empty beer on the table.  The food was good, I can't say for the Entree's as we ordered just appetizers but if you're looking for someplace to grab a few beers and some appetizers before, after or even between games, this is the place!"}
{"text":"Great Happy hour spot! It's always packed in the summer after work or on a weekend. They have a large selection of beers and liquors and you most likely won't wait tooo long to order. The service is friendly and very fast!"}
{"text":"When my family and I went to the Indians game the other day we decided to stop in here and have some beverages before the actually game. I am not much of a drinker but do like the occasional beer. The Thirsty Parrot is a fun place to go and have a beer before a game and to just sit and relax.   I will admit that it does get a little crowded and very loud, and even outside. But, this was overlooked with the sun shining and knowing we were headed to a good game. We did order some appetizers - potato skins and chicken strips- and they were your standard bar fare. The prices are reasonable as far as food and beverages go. The crowd is a little young for me, but I am okay with that as long as my kids are having fun. Overall, a good place to visit for drinks before an event."}
{"text":"Fun place before, during, and after an Indians game! We watched the fireworks from here after a recent game and it was crazy fun!  You might want to venture inside to get a drink during warm weather, however, as it's harder to get the attenetion of the bartender outside."}
