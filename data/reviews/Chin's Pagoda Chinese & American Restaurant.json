{"text":"This is the best place to get Chinese takeout in Willowick. My husband and I get sweet n sour chicken from here about once every couple of months. The sauce is yummy and my husband loves the pineapples in it. The gentleman behind the counter is very polite and efficient. We've tried other Chinese restaurants in the area but none compare to Chin's!"}
{"text":"Never again.  Ordered a pint of General Tso's and a quart of beef lo mein, got home and found a quart of beef lo mein and a pint of breaded chicken with no sauce.  The bag was leaking very badly (from the lo mein) - in the bottom were two unwrapped and crushed fortune cookies.  All of this for the bargin price of $17.00 dollars.  Normally, I would have went back and said something, but after opening that bag I could tell the people running the place just don't give a damn.  The apperance of the restaurant, the care of how my order was prepared and packaged showed the family that runs Chin's has absolutely no pride in what they do - sad.  I should of been tipped off by the fact that there were only two people in the restaurant, the cash register area is truely a sight to behold!"}
{"text":"From out of town, and heard some good things about this place and was not disappointed. Ordered the duck which was perfectly cooked. Tender with the right amount of crisp. The sauce with it was great as well. Potstickers are a healthy size and amazing. The gentleman who took our order was a nice guy and helped with directions as well. Oh and my fortune was great too!"}
{"text":"BEST egg rolls in Lake County.  My family has been going to Chin's for more than 30 years.  My kids have grown up with Chin's being a part of their life and a Christmas Eve tradition. Unfortunately, our children have grown, married, and moved away but each and every visit back to Lake County, there is a guaranteed visit to Chin's.   We order the family dinner - each selecting their favorite entree.  Family dinners come with soup, egg roll, ribs and chicken wing. A  family favorite is the Wor Sue Gai ( gai = chicken).which is lightly breaded chicken served over a bed of lettuce with a light brown peanut gravy w/scallions.  Yumm!  There are many choices but as I stated earlier...the BEST egg rolls.  My children have traveled and now live out of state and have yet to find a better egg roll."}
{"text":"I remember going to this place years ago with my parents when I was a kid and it was fantastic back then.  It's a shame as it has ally gone into disrepair and is quite filthy inside. If the dining area is this dirty I can only wonder what their kitchen and food prep area looks like.  The food was not bad, but it is not as good as some of the better places in Lake County like Imperial Dragon.n portions could have been better too.  Quite small portions for what you pay for and what other places give you."}
{"text":"This is the WORST chinese I have had in a long time!! The bow-legged man at the register was flat out rude. They didn't know how to make a long island iced tea and charged us $7.00 for a rum and coke!  The egg rolls weren't even any good. Will never return. Heed my warning go somewhere else to eat chinese. My first clue should have been we were the only ones in there."}
{"text":"It was literally the worst food of any kind that I've ever eaten. The chicken was 80% breading 10% air pocket and 10% chicken. When handing us our bowls of rice the server put her whole hand over the top of the bowl touching our rice with her palm. The walls were also stained with what looked like some sort of grease or oil coming through the wallpaper which made wanting to eat there difficult."}
{"text":"Gotta say - I wanted this place to be good as it is right across from where I live, but the product was horrible.  One dish had scallops in it, and frankly there was a ratio of 5 parts breading to one part miniscule scallop.  Everything was fried - the order took a long, long time to prepare.  While I waited, I used the restroom - filthy.  So I am hunting for a new local Chinese restaurant.  Moving and having to rediscover the half-way decent dives is the pits!  One thing for sure though - going to Chin's was even worse!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Chin's. This is perhaps the most authentic... non westernized Chinese restaurants in town... or at it has the least westernized food. Service is always top notch. I particularly enjoyed the pressed duck."}
{"text":"Okay Chin's. Our relationship is seriously flawed. Bipolar even. I love you again!   Seriously. I ain't lyin'! Even my food snobby cousins and pretend boyfriend were impressed. We grabbed take-out last Friday night. Everything was delicious and just how it used to be. Maybe they've been reading my reviews?   Anyway, I'll be hitting up Chin's on the regular again. Those chicken wings are SO got.damned.good!   I'm getting take-out again tonight. F cooking."}
{"text":"Got takeout here for lunch.  I see there reviews aren't to great, but considering how close this place is I'd do it again. There was a nice assortment of veggies in the food. Most of the meats were fried however leaving you with a heavy feeling.  The price point is a little high, but I guess in a pinch I'd give it another shot."}
{"text":"This family run place stands the test of time as one of best food in Cleveland. Food is fast fresh with old school true to Cantonese style. Now I have a personal attachment to this restaurant being a customer for almost 30 years and come back every time I come home to Cleveland to visit. Could use some updating but besides that it is one of the premier Chinese restaurants in the city."}
{"text":"By far the worst Chinese food in the area. The menu is a piece of paper that is a sheet, cut into 4. Only a few items on the menu, the place is dirty. When you walk in you will see behind the register, what a disaster, I can only imagine their kitchen.  Food had no taste and pricy. Go down to China House at Lakeshore and Babbit Road.  Lucky to get 1 star!"}
{"text":"After moving here from LA where I was spoiled with amazing Chinese food, I have been looking for a go to place to get decent Chinese. I was really hoping that Chin's would be that place. When I ordered, both the man and woman working there seemed very pleasant and friendly. I ordered Orange Chicken, Crab Rangoons, and an ice tea. Pretty regular American-Chinese food fare.  I got strips of Chicken that I guess were stir-fried in a very, very thin sauce and the portion did not fill up the to-go carton that it was placed in (usually Chinese places pack those things to the bursting point). The Crab Rangoons were very miesly filled and a little stale. The iced tea? A can. China is known for their tea and I was so disapointed to get a Brisk Tea. And yes, I got the unwrapped, stale fortune cookie mentioned in other reviews.  I am so disapointed. I really, really wanted to like this place. The search continues..."}
{"text":"Chin's Pagoda is a Lake County landmark which makes this review difficult to write. I have been going to Chin's for over 30 years!! I have fond memories of sitting at the lounge waiting for our food while my Mom had a cocktail or 4 while my brother and I had our Shirley Temples. I digress. Let's get to the point. Chin's Pagoda is dirty. It is not clean at all. I actually tried to have a heart to heart with the owner and explain that he should clean the place up but he only became defensive. No cleaning measures were taken. The floor is dirty, the restrooms are dirty, the booths and menus are dirty and the front counter is stacked with old papers, and whatever else he can cram up there. It's a darn shame because Chin's deserves better. I really hope he cleans it up but until then, I will not be going back."}
{"text":"This restaurant has always had consistently delicious, well-prepared food.  Dan and Diane are wonderful people who strive to provide excellent customer service. It's just them running the place, so be prepared to wait a little bit when they're trying to fulfill a bunch of takeout orders. They get slammed with takeout orders and it's only Dan up there, so please be patient and understanding! Oh, and Diane always amazes me that she can remember everyone's orders even when we don't go that often anymore due to family circumstances."}
{"text":"Honestly, I've never had better Chinese food in my life, very family oriented environment, the food is excellent, and they are very caring, and their prices are very fair, the portions are more than plenty, and I plan on eating here more often."}
{"text":"This is not the best Chinese in lake county. It's not even the best Chinese in Willowick. It is the funnest to eat at. Some Chinese places are decorated very 80's or kind of like a doctor's waiting room. This one has the authentic red and gold hues i think one should have. It reminds me of the one in the famous \"Seinfeld, four!\" episode where they end up not eating. It also reminds me of parts of Big Trouble in Little China. It is situated in a run down strip mall across from the lake and next to a thrift store.The food is good enough i guess. I also dig the name. Not to many restaurants have pagoda in their name."}
