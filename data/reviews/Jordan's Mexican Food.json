{"text":"Don't walk by.  Run by this place and don't look back.  The worst Mexican food in Phoenix.  Absolutely no flavor. The only thing going for it is the friendly wait staff."}
{"text":"I found this place during my lunch break. I didn't know what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised. The booths are comfy and the atmosphere is warm and inviting. I feels authentic and the waiter was funny and attentive. The food came out fast. I ordered the beef machaca and it took up half of the large plate. The beef was savory and tender, the tortilla was fresh and the toppings were mouth watering. Price wise they are very reasonable. Wonderful place to eat!"}
{"text":"I ordered a beef soft corn tortilla taco and a side of beans. I loved the chunky salsa. It had a little kick. The guacamole was very good and usually I'm very picky about how I want my guacamole. The food came fast. The restaurant was very nicely decorated and I liked the Mexican songs in the background. The customer service is great. The manager is very friendly. I would definitely come again."}
{"text":"I stopped in tonight with a girlfriend, and was pleasantly surprised:-) Our server was friendly and attentive and yum did I mention the chips & salsa yet lol. The chips were so crisp and delicious we finished the entire bowl before our meal came! May I suggest when it comes to the salsa ask your server to bring you their 'hot' or 'chunky' salsa it's sooo good but doesn't come on to the table unless you ask for it. I personally like to mix the 2 together, delicious! 
The food came out nice & hot and was also very good! I had the chicken flautas, and my friend got the # 7! My meal included guacamole & I'm so glad it did because it was also delish! It was actually made with fresh avocados, & let's be honest that's becoming more rare these days with the local mexican restaurants! So all that being said, if your looking for a truley authentic mexican meal this spot is definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at Jordan's Mexican Food for 41 years. I remember burning my finger on a bean burrito when I was 5. I think it was supposed to be a red chili burrito so when I picked it up and bit into it the cheesy beans oozed out onto my pinkie finger ouch... I'm sure I made a big scene. I've always been somewhat of a Drama Queen. I've had great times at Jordans. It's where we would head to on Christmas eve for dinner, and sure enough when we got home  Santa had already been to our house. I miss the one on Central because of convenience, but for Jordans I'll go anywhere. The food is delicious and the service is personal (which I love). I think I know what I'm having for dinner."}
{"text":"After a meal at Moira Sushi, we decided on a whim to stop in at Jordon's for a fried ice cream dessert.  We walked in the door and the place smelled of old carpet and b.o.  Not very appetizing, but I'm willing to give any place a chance.

We ordered the dessert, it arrived promptly...and was clearly not freshly made.  A very icky mushy crust with some cinammon and a dab of whipped cream, after a few bites we both looked at each other and said \"yuck!\".  Worst fried ice cream we've ever had!

After seeing some of the food passing by, it's probably on par with any other chain mexican, similar to a macayos or carlos o'briens.  Crispy tacos, flaccid yellow cheese, tomato and lettuce on everything.  Surely a step up from Taco Bell, but what's the point of that?  

WIth so many authentic cheap (and good) Mexican food places nearby with great corn tortillas and cotija cheese, I'll call this one a total pass....and I understand why I've never stepped foot in the door in 10 years that I've lived within 3 miles of the place."}
{"text":"I love the hot sauce, but they also have salsa if you like the chunky stuff. My family started coming when my grandparents brought my dad, and after we were born he brought us, so it's been a tradition for about 55 - 60 years. The staff is friendly (especially tony & joe). Overall just a pleasant, relaxing place for good food."}
{"text":"The last time I dined here was many years ago. I recalled it being a \"decent\" dining experience then, but one I wasn't exactly enthusiastic about repeating again during a recent visit with friends. As another poster mentioned, there is a small segment of the population who is rabidly devoted to this long time Phoenix fixture. Why? I'm not exactly sure. My most recent experience, days ago, left me wondering how this place has managed to stay open for so long.

Upon entering the dark, cavernous entrance, no one was there to greet us. It took a while before someone noticed and seated us. The dining area on this very hot afternoon, was uncomfortably warm. Not exactly a respite from the heat.

Then the salsa and chips arrived. Please see the photos and other reviews on this awful concoction which appears to me to be nothing more than tomato sauce (spaghetti sauce base) with a few chili pepper seeds thrown in for good measure. This stuff absolutely comes from a can. If you ask for the \"other salsa\", what appears next is a watery, minced pepper mixture that is horribly bland and only slightly better than the tomato sauce salsa. I wound up eating the chips by themselves.

I ordered a chicken burro enchilada style. The rice was fine, the shredded chicken abundant, but not seasoned. The enchilada sauce topping was also quite flavorless. 

All in all, highly disappointing and completely non-authentic."}
{"text":"This place has been around forever, but I can't really understand why. The restaurant is run down. The service was pretty awful - it took forever to place our order, we sat with empty water glasses, then there were missing dishes, messed up dishes, we needed silverware, etc. And from the moment you try the salsa that tastes like canned tomato sauce, you'll know that the food just isn't good. There are many better options for Mexican food around this area."}
{"text":"I have grown up on Jordan's and it is like home food to me.  When I am out of town, I miss it and crave it.  In fact it's often my first stop if coming from the airport.  With that being said, it is not for everyone.  The restaurant is kind of dumpy and the food a bit pricey for what you get.  Luckily, I have converted my best friend to a Jordan's lover and we go there at least once a month.  My husband is still resisting, even after more than 15 years of being dragged there. 

The hot sauce is spicey and tomatoey.  The cheese they use on the cheese crisps is so gooey and good!  My friend loves the salsa, but you have to specifically ask for it, as they always default to the hot sauce.  The service is usually good and I know most of the staff.  There have been some times when it wasn't so good, but it's not the norm.  Personally, I would give 5 stars, but I am writing this for people who have never been and I don't know that a Jordan's virgin would have the same love for it that I do."}
{"text":"Sigh.  Our food was sublime.  Yes, Jordan's is serving the absolute best cheese crisp anywhere.  We came for a late lunch (about 2:30 pm), were promptly greeted, seated in a booth and told that the lunch specials were still available.  We both had a shredded beef taco and cheese enchilada after sharing a green chile cheese crisp and were in heaven for the next hour.  We're so glad Jordan's is here and although we don't live in this part of town, we will definitely be back at our first opportunity."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely terrible. By request of the kids, we ordered  food for takeout and this will definitely be the last time I let them choose.  I placed my order and was told it would be ready in 20-30 minutes, so I show up about 15 minutes after placing the order expecting to wait a few minutes.  I walk in to a girl sitting on a bench talking with what appeared to be a friend, and a guy who was probably mid to late 40s sitting on a computer behind the counter with what I assumed was my order sitting there. I tell him I'm picking up my order when he looks at the girl, she rolls her eyes, and tells me my total. She has to go run my card in the other room while the guy sits there seeming real thrilled to be there. 

I get my food home (which is 5 minutes away at most) and start to divvy it up for the kids when I find our cheese crisp is completely cold. There wasn't any part of it that was even slightly warm, it had clearly been sitting for a while. The cheese in the enchiladas had already congealed, My chimichanga was soft instead of crunchy. I tried to resurrect dinner by warming it up in the microwave, but I think it actually tasted better cold. At least there's an excuse for food being bad when it's cold. 

After spending $50 at this place, we ended up throwing it away and ordering pizza and it's safe to say I won't be returning here again!"}
{"text":"We know Mexican Food so don't let the dark and dingy fool you, food is excellent. Been coming here for years. We crave the green beef enchiladas and the ground beef tacos. Meet is tender and not fatty. Food is soul satisfying.  My only regret in giving five stars is we don't want it to get busy. We love the staff some have been here as long as we have been coming."}
{"text":"love this place so much!! you can never pick a bad item here. i love the chimichangas, they're basically heaven on a plate. always get enchilada style, you cant go wrong with it. the atmosphere is so welcoming, and just family friendly. the restaurant is extremely clean, and the restrooms have darling decor. i go here at least once a month, and i love the option of ordering ahead so i can pick up if i want to enjoy the delicious food at home."}
{"text":"Jordan's is the first restaurant I ever ate at- I was only 4 months old and I had rice.  Ever since then, this restaurant has been my guilty pleasure.  My favorite thing on the menu is the sour cream cheese enchiladas- they are heavenly.  Nowhere else makes enchiladas that good!  The food is definitely NOT heart healthy, but it's great for mental health.  I am a big fan of the shredded beef tacos, the crispy bean tostadas, and the yummy chimis.  I would stay away from the fajitas and the salads, though.  I've taken people here, and they don't like the paste-like hot sauce in lieu of salsa, but I'm absolutely addicted.  I always get some to go!

{"text":"I am being utterly polite by giving this place one star. Places where I've had better food: the cafeteria in a hospital, 7-11, if I'd ever been to prison, prison. I'm not sure if Jordan's pays people to park in its lot to give the impression that the place is full. There's absolutely nothing authentically Mexican about this place, except, perhaps, for the Mexican dishwasher.  If you've recently lost your tase buds, love greasy beef dumped into a Old El Paso \"taco shell\" topped with shredded Velveeta and iceberg lettuce, then, boy is this the place for you. Also, if you're a fan of tomato paste in the guise of \"salsa\" and served from a stolen syrup container from IHOP, then do it up at Jordan's.

Please, do yourself (and your wallet) a favor and eat at the Jack-in-the Box down the street. You've been warned."}
{"text":"Jordan's is seconds away from my office and I was craving cheap, run-of-the-mill Mexican food so we ran to Jordan's real fast. Expecting the typical Mexican restaurant with the typical wooden booths and plastic covered seats, I was surprised to find the interior was actually really nice. I was even more surprised to find the menu prices weren't as nice. Looking to spend no more than $7 on some tacos and rice and beans, I wasn't thrilled when I saw entrees for $12-$15.

Luckily they have a killer (but limited) lunch menu for $5.95. To your table in 30 minutes or less or it's free. Of course, it came out in less than 14 minutes. And it was pretty good. I should have asked for soft tacos instead of hard but the meat was good and the toppings were decent. The salsa was odd though. I'm used to thick and chunky but this salsa reminded me of pasta sauce and that was odd but I ate it."}
{"text":"This place is where everyone knows your name. The food is fantastic and the servers have all been working there for years. I've been coming here for 30+ years and go at least once a week. 

What you need to know:
Service: is it the fastest? No, but if you get to know the servers and owner they become family. They are all so nice and friendly.

Salsa: sure there main salsa might look like tomato paste but it is so good and made fresh. If you want chunky salsa the just ask for it, but beware sometimes it is really spicy. 

This is a family owned business so support them and other locally owned businesses."}
{"text":"Came here bc we wanted to try a New Mexican restaurant and when I discussed it with my boyfriend we figured since the establishment had been open for so many years that they had to be good.  I think they are more based on nostalgia sake then quality of food.  And because there are so many other good quality Mexican restaurants in town we figured they would have to at least stay competitive with the other business.  Walked in and slightly dingy- aged interior- which is fine we knew they had been around forever.... we were seated at a booth which only had 2 place settings not 3 as we had a party of 3.  No one brought us an extra setting.  Service was pretty good, but food quality was sub par especially for the price.  Chips came out cold- salsa was chunky in water and another in a syrup dispenser.  We ordered a combo dinner platter which we were disappointed at the quality of the beef and chicken.  Biggest regret was the fajitas which only were overly oily cooked meat and chicken with onions.  Only 2 thin uncooked slices of peppers on top.  The beef was chewy and unappetizing.  Cooked in way too much lard/oil to try to mask the quality.  I wish I could of had better things to say.  When we got the bill we were shocked- almost $75 for 3 for a subpar meal.  Too expensive for the overall meal and ambiance."}
{"text":"I first reviewed Jordan's back in November of 2011, after going there since 2000.  As everyone has stated, many customers are locals who have been going here for decades with their families.  For all of those people who complain about the tomato sauce-based salsa, ASK YOUR FRIENDLY SERVER FOR THE CHUNKY SALSA AND THEY WILL BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO BRING YOU SOME!  Be warned, it's spicy and it's awesome.  For those others who came to Jordan's for the first time or were visiting from out of town and gave them a bad review, fine!  You people don't need to come back here, EVER!  Jordan's has done just fine on local return customers for the past 10+ decades and don't need you here!"}
{"text":"I love this little old place.  They are friendly and serve the kind of Mexican food one used to find often in Phoenix (but not any longer).  It remains a family-run business and they want to make sure that you enjoy yourself.  It is an older building and is a little dark, but that's part of the fun.  The food is not super spicy so is good for out-of towners who can't handle the hot stuff.  I have never had food there that was less than great, so order what you like and enjoy!"}
{"text":"The service is great, food is Americanized Mexican with a twist- try the chicken tacos and the cheese crisp"}
{"text":"Two words: Cheese. Crisp. My family and I when we visit Arizona often choose Jordan's over our long time family favorite the Tee Pee because the quality of their food just isn't the same. We never left Phoenix without a Tee Pee dinner. Now, we can do without and this is our new joint. Get the chimichanga, you'll thank me later :D"}
{"text":"As many reviewers have stated I have been coming to Jordan's for 40 years, it was a family tradition that I have continued with my own children. I love the hot sauce and chips, and my kids fight over it. If you ask they will gladly bring you some chunky salsa. 
Joe the owner always comes by and says hello to all of the guests.
I've never had any problems with the service they have always been attentive and friendly.
This is the Mexican food I have grown up with and it's what I consider good Mexican food. It's always been consistent and wonderful.  It defiantly is old school Phoenix Mexican food one of the last of a dying breed of a non chain.
I usually get the no.7 red or green and it's always satisfying. I also love the chimichanga and the portions are very generous."}
{"text":"menu was hard to follow. No combination specials that most would have
Chips were good. Salsa was ok. Service was ok. Owner did walk around checking on people. been wanting to eat here for a while. was sadly disappointed."}
{"text":"I love Jordans. They have the best salsa in the valley - I'm not referring to the spicy red sauce that they give you at the table. You have to ask for it. They are an old, family run business that's been here since the 50's. True, there are many Mexican restaurants in Phoenix but this one keeps us coming back. The open faced cheese crisp is a favorite for an appetizer. I usually get the tacos and rice, always great. The enchiladas with red sauce are fantastic. The chips are fresh and hot (get the salsa though).  I'm surprised to see so many bad reviews because the service and food have always been excellent."}
{"text":"We lived in Phoenix for 12 years and never went to Jordan's, our loss!  I had the number 8, a cheese enchilada, beef taco and bean chalupa.  The enchilada had a very flavorful cheese with one of the best enchilada sauces I've ever had.  The beef taco was made out of shredded beef, delicious.  We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Man I don't think they changed recipe since they opened in the 80s very Bland no presentation and kind of a pricey side for what you get I have the tostada and enchilada plate just thought it was soggy and the enchilada really had no flavor food was very boring server was nice he was only guy there working on the floor and he had like five six tables he did a really good job I was impressed by him had the fried ice cream witxh was gross taste like that ice cream you get in a bucket at Fry's for like 2 buck never going back"}
{"text":"Standard Mexican fare.  I went during lunch with another person place was not busy. the waiter was very friendly.   Service very good. Food was presented very nicely and was good.  I have no complaints sept one tiny one the chips they gave you were good but the salsa was so hot I couldn't even eat it. Other than that everything was good and I would go back"}
{"text":"Service was excellent - it helps that I went to the restaurant with my aunt and uncle who have been going to Jordan's for decades and the waiters and waitresses and owners know them. Our waiter Tony was great, btw.  I had a taco salad with shredded beef. It was delicious. They also have good chips. I recommend this place. Unsure why the place doesn't get an overall four. It's also inexpensive but then again I'm from SF so food anywhere else is often cheaper but still...check this place out."}
{"text":"A Phoenix Staple that is still around. Yes its dark, old, and a bit dingy, but the food is decent.

It has great old-world charm and its been retrofitted over the years. 

Dishes are standard Mexican, nothing special to report, they are good and up to par with most other Mexican food establishments around town."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and unfortunately its never been a great experience.  I think the first time it was a three star, but the last time was definitely a two--maybe even a one and a half star.  The service was terrible.  Granted, we were a large party with three kids, but it they clearly weren't busy and it was a weeknight.  It took them about 20 minutes to get a table together for us, which was fine.  But then it took them about another twenty minutes to take our orders.  We were so hungry we ended up devouring four baskets of chips before we even placed our orders.

The chips were probably the best part--but I can't say the red ketchup sauce is great.  We asked for a chunky salsa that was decent and ended up mixing that with the thick red ketchup sauce they give you.  I ordered a burrito with green sauce with a side of beans and rice.  It definitely wasn't anything to drool over.  It was edible, but not great.  Plus its not even super cheap.  

Its a pass."}
{"text":"One of the worst Mexican restaurants I have ever eaten at in my life.  Im a native and grew up on Mexican food and this hands down is the worst.  Right up there with Ponchos buffet.  

They should put this place on Fear Factor if that show is even still around.

Disgusting."}
{"text":"While driving home last night, we decided to drive up 7th St and look for a Mexican restaurant.   Sadly, we found Jordan's.  The outside looks very nice.  Once inside, it's obvious this place hasn't been updated since 1981- lots of dark, heavy wood & wrought iron. NICE! I loved it. REALLY!  I loved it enough to overlook the amazingly creepy carpeting figuring if they updated the carpeting, they'd have to update the rest of the decor, too.  We were blown-away, in a really, really bad way, when the chips & salsa came...as noted by others, it tastes like ketchup with some chili powder mixed in. Horrible. We already ordered drinks & didn't want to split and stiff our waitress so we ordered a cheese crisp.  The cheese crisp was fine.  Sadly, we didn't have any salsa to put on it.

Other reviewers pointed out that aside from salsa, it was a good experience.  Whatever.  I suppose these same folks would be fine with a blind date who arrived in dirty clothing & who hadn't showered in a week.   If a Mexican restaurant can't do a decent salsa, they don't get a 2nd chance."}
{"text":"One of the worst Mexican restaurants I have ever eaten at in my life. I'm a native and grew up on Mexican food and this hands down is the worst. Right up there with Ponchos buffet. 

Disgusting. This place should be condemned."}
{"text":"Avoid this place. Turn away and literally go anywhere else. Do not let Jordan's beautiful exterior fool you. This entire staff should be ashamed of themselves. My dinner consisted of incomplete meals, and the kitchen staff actually left in the middle of our service, lights being turned off on us, the entire staff saying \"are they gone yet?\", and we did not receive drink refills. We were even upsold to a larger queso, which did not come with chips because the \"kitchen is closed\". 

Salsa has NO substance and is watery, runny... comparable to ketchup. 

Last night, my husband and I decided to try this place rather than visit our favorite restaurant next door. The time was 8:45pm. We had no idea the closed at 9pm. Our favorite restaurant next door closes at 10pm. The hostess did not bother to tell us they were closing. I don't know about you, but when I go to dinner, I don't like to be rushed. I would have gladly came back on another night before closing. Communicate with your customers! It's okay to ask people to come back when you're opened.... What you did was wrong on so many levels. 

I'll share my horror experience so you don't have to go through this. Here's what happened. 

We walk in at 8:45pm. My husband says \"Two for dinner?\". The hostess looked annoyed, but told us to follow her. We were seated in a lovely booth. I ordered a chili relleno and a taco. We received half a bowl of chips ahead of time and quickly finished them. We ordered queso, and the waiter suggested the larger portion. He brought the queso, but never brought any more chips. The kitchen staff was now leaving, just as our food was delivered to the table. (Kitchen staff should NEVER leave prior to your customer taking their first bite. This should be common sense.) 

My chili relleno was an omelet wrapped around a chili. I was expecting a cheese-stuffed relleno. I have a medical condition that restricts me from eggs, so I pushed it to the side, and was hoping to order another taco. (full intention of paying, I understand this happens frequently).

Soon after the food was delivered, the owner/manager shut the lights off on us and hobbled away on his cane. He never made eye contact with us. Another owner/manager nicely dressed woman was at the front giggling and talking about personal issues with the hostess. Twice, I heard the hostess say \"Are they still here?\"

We never saw the waiter again throughout the \"meal\". My taco tasted as if the meat had been microwaved. We didn't get refills on drinks after the food was delivered. 

At 9:15pm, we finally saw the waiter and asked for chips to accomodate his upsale queso. \"Sorry, kitchen's closed\" he said. 

We explained the error and irony of him upselling us an this item that he was unable to facilitate. Explained to him that kitchen staff should never leave during the meal. And that we shouldn't have been seated if they were in the process of closing for the night. 

Also mentioned that we had went through the meal with no drink refills. He was apologetic to the mistake and gave us to-go drinks and also removed the queso from our order. I did not mention the relleno, because again, that was my fault. 

As we were leaving the hostess walked by and saw our empty table and said \"They finally gone?\" and looked right at us. Didn't apologize and even smirked at her own timing. She walked to the front door and aggressively pushed the lock open. 

It was 9:30 by the time we left. By the way, Christos next door, is open until 10pm and they are very nice people. Go there. Don't go to this place. 

The food was cheap at Jordan's, so I can understand why they didn't want to wait around for us. Again, we would have went next door if your terrible hostess would have communicated rather than make us feel bad for being customers. The service was dirt. The owners/managers do not care about good service at all. I get the feeling the hostess enjoys being rude. She has a miserable attitude.

Get out of this neighborhood Jordans. You don't belong here."}
{"text":"This place is a family institution. I have been coming here my entire life. The beef enchiladas are incredible and their hot salsa is life changing. The owner is the sweetest man you'll ever meet. Also ask for Tony when you go. He's an incredible server. He's been with jordan's for as long as I've been coming here ! Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"I insisted to my husband that we try this place since it's been here for a very long time. The food was a disappointment. The service was great, the hot sauce tasted like ketchup with some crushed red peppers thrown in it. The prices are higher than Carlos Obrien's and La Pinata down the street. The red chili burrito lacked flavor, and paying $16.00 for a combination plate you want to have a meal with some flavor. I read here that this place has it's loyal customers, which is great. I'm glad I got it out of my system and tried this place. We won't be back. Next time we'll go to a Mexican restaurant that has better tasting food. If you are in the area go to La Pinata. For even better food drive out to Comedor Guadalajara on I-17 and Central. So disappointed....."}
{"text":"Jordans has been closed for 3-4 years now. Much to my dissapointment because I always enjoyed going here for lunch and getting their tostadas.

RIP Jordans."}
{"text":"Random stop.  Leary of the 3 star review, but we really enjoyed this place.  It would be a 5 star review but our first table and something mysterious on it. Started bad.  Finished strong. Great service.  Loved all the regulars who were there.  Obviously for a reason."}
{"text":"Had lunch with another guest. Lunch specials for $7.95 are OK because their prices are high if you order single items, like a taco and beef enchilada will cost you over $11.00. I feel $7.00 with tax is bit high for a beef enchilada with nothing else.  Place has locals and I guess that keeps their business going. Taco salad is the best deal on the lunch menu. Only got one hot sauce with chips, other tables got two. Nothing special here just ANOTHER Mexican Restaurant."}
{"text":"I have been going to Jordan's since the mid 1960's and it has been a family institution ever since.  I grew up going for tacos every single Friday.  Birthday's and all family visitors were whisked to Jordan's and thus the traditions began.  I had a server named Lottie for my entire life until she passed away.  Servers stay there and there has to be a reason for that.  The food is \"comfort food\" and just reminds you of something that you've known your whole life.  My children grew up on Jordan's every time they went to Grandma and PaPa's house.  By the time they left for college, Jordan's was the first stop when I picked them up at Sky HArbor.  Even today, I buy it and take it to all my kids when I leave to go out of town.  I've had to get very creative packing it on the plane.  People who don't \"get\" Jordan's should go to a tourist trap and be happy.  This is old school and a family restaurant that has made generations of people very happy.  Jordan's holds a very special memory in our family traditions."}
{"text":"I had always heard that Jordan's is the best Mexican restaurant in town and I can see why people think so.  It's got a lot of tasty dishes on its menu.  My vegetarian dining companion did not find too many options but was able to put together a nice dinner.

Ambiance and location are good.  This restaurant obviously has a lot of happy regulars.

Would I come here again.  Yes!"}
{"text":"I read plenty of bad reviews and I totally disagree.  I absolutely loved this place.  And I've been looking for a good Mexican restaurant for quite a while...!  Excellent food and excellent service!"}
{"text":"This was my first time there but my family rants and raves about how good the food is.  Food was great and service was excellent."}
{"text":"Terrible.  I used to eat at Jordan's on central for years. This place is awful, not even close.  My wife and I dated and feel in love on central, I guess it's good we did not go here."}
{"text":"I read several reviews and noticed a pattern, the highest reviews  came from those with a nostalgic history with this valley institution. Having lived in the valley for most of my life I appreciate the sentimentality.  

BUT!  It is important to separate nostalgia from reality, especially when others rely on your opinion when making dinner plans.

I've lived in the Valley for a good long time- more than 40 years.  I've been to Jordan's more times than I can count.  

As a child, this was one of many local Mexican food restaurants we visited- others being El Maya, Don Jose's, Rosa's, Rosita's, George's Ole, and others.  As an adult, part of my enjoyment was the old-fashioned, retro atmosphere- the genuine Naugahyde seats, dark wrought iron, old-school environment.  I was even OK with the smooth taco sauce in lieu of chopped and chunky salsa.  I tend to stick with the old-school combo plate- taco, enchilada, tostada type combos when I visit.

My last two visits have occurred in the last year- most recently in November.  The experiences were almost identical- disappointing.  It was as if someone in the kitchen had just given up.  The taco meat was not really seasoned, very bland, and the shell tasted as if they went and picked up a package at the grocery instead of making their own.  The enchilada was rather oily.  Food was warm, not hot.  Service was friendly but scarce- my drink sat empty more than once.

The visit in November is likely my last.  I drive by this location at least 3 times a week, and remember wistfully the days when the the food was piping hot, shredded beef well seasoned and the entire taco fresh out of the cooker- crispy and delicious.   There are too many good Mexican food places in town, and even for the memories that walking into this places conjures up, I cannot see myself coming back anytime soon.  I'll keep my eyes open for an upturn in Yelp reviews, particularly from those who are trying it for the first time.

As another reviewer said- be forewarned.  You run a great risk of being disappointed."}
{"text":"Came to Jordan's a few days ago. Walked in and greeted by the host and waited a couple min for a table. There was a older guy lingering in front who was just sitting there and made me feel uncomfortable, telling me the host will seat us soon (yeah she just told me that a sec ago) I wasn't in no hurry. There was also people sitting at the front tables who seemed to maybe own the place which I felt was unprofessional.
We sat at the back in a booth. They could of have the ac running, felt more humid and warm. We got good chips but the Salsa was like paste it was ok (I've had better). The menu options was the usual Mexican food, nothing different that'll make your mouth water.
The service was the best, we had a younger guy didn't get his name but he was on point with great service.
It would been nice if they added fresh cut tomatoes onion cilantro to the salsa. My kids enjoyed the guacamole we ordered for the chips. 
The good service is what made this dinner turn out really good, thanks.
Don't think I'll come back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Sadly nostalgia doesn't make the food here any less bland. I am very generous when I dine out, and always will find something positive to end the meal. In this case the positive was that I did not have to pay for the horrendous meal. 

Word to the wise- if a place that serves mexican food serves you ketchup as salsa, leave immediately. 

My boyfriend and I set the salsa aside and ordered the very basic machaca beef burritos. What we got was GRAY meat, with not one ounce of seasoning. 

At this point we apologized to our waiter, offered to pay for the drinks and salsa, but he seemed used to this and said not to worry about it. At first he tried to say they make the meat with eggs. But saw quickly that we would not be buying that story. We did leave a nice tip for the poor guy.

This is what happens when you have uninspired people making food. 

Too Sad."}
{"text":"Many of these reviewers seem to be dining at a restaurant in a different dimension than the Jordans I visit as often as possible. My Jordan's has traditional \"Sonoran Red\" sauce, one of the few places remaining that serve this sauce rather than some sort of \"sausa with pineapple and mangos\" [pop lips].  The Jordan's I eat at has solid Mexican food at a reasonable price without the fufu nonsense that many other purported Mexican restaurants engage in to satisfy the ignorant hords that have moved to Arizona from the Midwest, California or the East coast. No tofu tacos, but some of the best cheese enchiladas and shreaded chicken tacos you will find anywhere."}
{"text":"First time here for me and my husband. So much food couldn't eat it all.  The best spinach and cheese enchiladas ever"}
{"text":"I use to eat at the Jordan's that was located off Central and Thomas years ago when I worked across the street a bunch of us would go weekly and looked forward to it each week. I forgot about this location until I passed it not to long ago and decided since I work not to far to head there for lunch. I got seated right away and served chips and salsa (just like I remembered it) I ordered the personal size cheese crisp with green chilies and a bean Tostada ....well, my food came out VERY quickly. The cheese crisps was cold and the chilies weren't even warm....seems like it had been sitting there for a bit then they threw the chilies on last minute...kind of disappointing. My Tostada on the other hand was good. The service was great but the food was a let down. Not sure if I'll be back soon but if I crave a Tostada I know I'll head over there."}
{"text":"I grew up coming here. Their chicken tacos are amongst my all time favorite (and I've been to the #1 and #2 taco shops in America according to 538.com haha). Their chimichangas and quesadillas are great too. I like their hot sauce a lot too."}
{"text":"I grew up going to Jordan's and they have the best Cheese enchiladas anywhere. Son-in-Law's favorite is, Steak Fajitas. My husband's favorite is the Southwest Chicken Salad. Every thing is good, and the service wonderful and speedy, the staff is friendly and know the of all the regulars by name. The owner will sit and visit with the regulars, making everyone feel very much at home. All the food is prepared fresh daily, and if you want spicier salsa just ask for it. They have a great cheese crisp, but you need to try the their Butter Crisp. Go and enjoy!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Jordan's since I was a kid.  The food is consistent and good, and the staff treats you like you're family.  It's a very relaxing neighborhood restaurant and a great value!"}
{"text":"My family and I have been going to Jordans for decades....great service great food great quiet little place to take the the family!!!!"}
{"text":"Giving two stars alone for service and the third star for the food.  Server was very polite and and effective.  As others Yelpers have stated the salsa for the chips is unique.  The chips are excellent.  Small side of chile con queso was tasty and plenty.  The flop of the meal was the chicken faijatas.   Served with three tortillas, guac, sour cream, and a pick de gallo - and of course rice and beans.  The fajitas were plain- not much flavor and while the onions were sizzling when served, they flat lacked flavor.  Price was fair for the food.  Would I go back?  Perhaps for the $2.50 beers but not for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Good for basic Mexican food, tacos's, enchilada's, etc..  If you like heat in your food, you might be disappointed, however, as the food is not very spicy.  Hot sauce is very bland, and flavor is very inconsistent (from one visit to the next).

The main thing that I don't like is the older gentleman (could be the owner) that walks around,  comes up to your table, will sit down at your table (if you leave room in your booth) and starts talking to you and does not really care what you have to say.  Please keep him in the back!"}
{"text":"I've been driving past this place for quite some time. My wife and I were in the area and decided to give it a try. We should have kept on driving! First of all, this place has tons of potential. Good location and the building is actually kinda cool inside. The service was typical of what you would typically expect from such a restaurant. Certainly no complaints! The food on the other hand was not very good, to say the least. My wife and I both the green corn tamales w/ beans. To be fair, the tamale was ok. It wasn't horrible, nor was very good. The refried beans that accompanied the dish were about the same, on the bland side. The beans were also the smallest portion of beans i have ever seen at a mexican restaurant. I'm guessing maybe 3 ounces, if that. The most disappointing part of the meal was the salsa. By far the worst salsa I've ever had! This is no joke! Picture taking tomato paste and tomato sauce, adding some garlic salt, and walla! Pretty terrible actually! I wanted to write this review to educate the owners/manager of this establishment. Please fix the salsa! Open a cookbook, or hire someone that has worked in a Mexican restaurant kitchen before to overhaul things. Fill the plate with bean or rice, its cheap and it makes people feel like there getting a lot for their buck! On a positive note, I found the restaurant to be oddly charming. Its the most quiet restaurant I think i've ever been in, and there were quite a few people dining while were were there. Its almost like a being in a basement or recording studio. The ceiling has these very large wood beams and the bathrooms were unexpectedly nice and clean. I really hate giving this 2 stars. I might go back, but it won't for for several years or until I hear the food has improved. My 2 cents!"}
{"text":"My dad talked about coming to this place when he was a kid. Decided to give it a go with my husband. We came in to an employee struggling with a transaction at the register. We sat down on the bench in front of the register and waited for him to seat us. After about 10 minutes still struggling with the transaction, he asked us to seat ourselves in a booth. We sat ourselves and waited for almost 10 more minutes for menus and drinks. We were in full view of a waiter who serviced booths surrounding ours. Nobody ever talked to us. I got up and got menus. We waited 5 more minutes and had our order ready. With no service, we walked out. We literally sat alone for almost an half hour ignored. Wanted to like this place but we never even got to try. We both showered today. Don't know why we were aversive or invisible."}
{"text":"Ok so we always drive by Jordan's and wonder if it is any good. The building looks nice and they have been around forever. We got a coupon in the mail and decided to give it a try. The parking lot was pretty full for late at night. We go in and are seated and look at the menu. Both of us commented on the odd assortment of items on the Combo. Our first clue was all of the help looked as if they were from the Mid-West. We decided to have the Fajitas and a Combo. They brought out some chips that reminded me of the ones you get at Safeway in the giant bag for a buck or two. Then there was the \"Salsa\". It was basically Catsup, not Ketchup as in Heinz or some other reputable product, but the stuff in the huge container for 99cents, mixed with something like hot sauce. We ordered Cheese Crisps. They were basically corn tortillas with some shredded cheddar cheese melted on top. Then the food came out. Let's just say, having eaten at Ponchos Buffet, there is worse, but places like this are usually found in the Mid-West where the people think Taco Bell is authentic. The only redeeming value to this place was the Ice Tea was tasty, that and the cashier offered to let us buy some candy to make the $40 bill (for two) so we could get the $10 off rather than the $5 off of a $20. Purchase. I thank-you for this, because it was certainly not a $40 meal ore a $30, or even a $10 for that matter, but Sir, you earned a second star because of that. Well actually it was only a half star and you added a star but since I can't give a one and a half stars, you get two. 

Fellow Yelpers you have been warned. Check Yelp first, no matter how good a deal it seems."}
{"text":"We decided to try out a new local sonaran style mexican restaurant and passing by Jordan's on several occasions I was curious to see what this was all about. I recommend calling in to make a reservation just in case they happen to be busy on a weekend. This place reminds me of being at a traditional mexican home feel. We are first served with fresh chips and homemade salsa! The homemade margaritas were made by the server himself, and he made a mean margarita! The dishes were fairly priced and I had the ground beef burro with a side of fresh guacamole and rise. OH lastly there tea is freshly brewed(I love me some tea)!"}
{"text":"Never rated a place this low before. Bad start... It was very slow and yet it took forever for our server to come to our table. The decor was a throwback to the 80's, and probably that was when it was done and never updated. The menus came with dried up food on mine. They eventually came and brought us typical chips and awful salsa. It was served in q maple syrup dispenser and had the consistency of tomato paste. You couldn't pour it so you had to remove the top and scoop it out with a spoon. It tasted a little like flavored tomato paste as well. When our server came by we asked for a drink menu and he pointed to his head, as if to say all we needed to do is ask and he would recite it to us from memory. We asked what is good here and he grinned and said \"margaritas\", to which we asked what kind. He began to recite flavored, and we said we wanted a top-shelf, he really didn't know what we were talking about so we ordered the non-flavored with salt on the rocks. It came out and was perhaps one of the most typical standard margarita mixed drinks with very little tequila. We mistakingly at that pint decided to stay and ordered a combination plate, split. They split it, but instead of splitting both items they gave my wife one and me one and only one set of utensils. He asked what kind of sauce, we said green but on the side. The green sauce came later when we were ready to leave. The food was really diner fare and while not awful, not something to write home about. We chose not to finish and instead took our check to the counter and paid with Apple Pay, which was the only redeeming part of the visit. We should have trusted our first instinct and left as soon as we walked in."}
{"text":"This is the one I call the \"Other\" Jordan's. Not because it is any worse, only because it isn't the one I grew up eating at.

This Jordan's is downtown, along a little strip of restaurants including the Caddy Corner, Durant's, and Thaiger. And the food here is slightly different from the other Jordan's, but just as good. 

The service here is quicker but more in tune with a lunch crowd, since most of their customers pop in from neighboring office buildings. It is very dark inside but it serves as a nice respite in the summertime when the sun glares at such absurd temperatures. 

They have some lunch specials that aren't available at the 7th street location, and even some deviations from traditional mexican fare like ham and cheese sandwiches or burgers. My recommendation is to dance with the fella that brought you, so don't stray too far from the tacos and enchiladas."}
{"text":"Anyone who has grown up in North Central Phoenix in the past thirty years knows about Jordan's. Of that group, I would say around 25% take it a step further: they worship this place. 

I'm part of the 25%. I have memories of eating at Jordan's and ordering cheese crisps off of the Kids' Menu, and then promptly engaging in bitter fights with my sister about who got more pieces, invariably ending in one of us throwing ice cubes and/or utensils at the other. Good times. 

However, it isn't a place I take out-of-towners all that often because, frankly, it isn't the best Mexican food around. Or the most authentic, for that matter. (No offense to Jordan's, PHX has some ridiculously tasty comida mexicana.) 

My favorite way to describe why I still go here is the salsa. I remember trying it as a kid thinking it was the spiciest salsa known in western civilization and I was among only a handful of reckless Arizonans that even had the chance or the guts to taste it (I had never had salsa before and, well, those are the sorts of things I thought about when I was four). Needless to say, it's not spicy at all, but going back I feel like an official badass grown-up now that I can heap it on my chips without flinching. 

Entering the dark restaurant's seating area stirs up stories and memories and smells from my early childhood. And it isn't uncommon to run into someone I went to grammar school with, who is undoubtedly there for the same reasons that I am. 

I rounded it to 4/5 stars but my more specific rating must be broken up by demographic: For Phoenix Natives: 5 stars. For Visitors and Snow Birds: 3 Stars."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican food restaurant ever. The salsa is on point fresh balance of flavors, and the spice level is perfect. The food goes from amazing to perfect, fresh chips are perfect."}
{"text":"Really?  One of the best Mexican restaurants?  This was recommended by a friend and maybe the friendship should be examined, or at least their taste.

Although they advertise take out, there is no take out menu. For those who wish to stop in for a quick lunch, there is no bar and you have to sit by yourself in a very large booth.  The atmosphere is stale and the service adequate. 

I ordered their burritto and enchilada with red sauce, rice and beans. It was heavy and greasy. Good food does not consist of drowning the dish with cheese and grease. My stomach was upset by the small amount I sampled. 

I will not visit Jordan's again."}
{"text":"Went to Jordan's for the first time last night. I had the Green Burro, enchilada style, very tasty, large portion, very good quality ! Eddie was my server, nice young man, attentive, but then they got busy, still very good service :-)  Had one of the back room's all to myself, they even changed the TV channel for me ! Nice atmosphere, private rooms for parties, large get togethers !  They are well established in the community !  Thumb's Up !  I Will be Bach :-) By the way, try the Chunky, Spicy Salsa, it will clear your head :-) !"}
{"text":"D+ Mexican food at best. I didn't get sick or barf up a hariball.

That's the best I can say about this place"}
{"text":"Meh is right. We are trying all the Mexican spots around us and this one was a little too greasy for me. I will say it was probably the best service we have had at a Mexican restaurant so keep that up!"}
{"text":"Had lunch there today, one of the most rundown dirty restaurants I think I have ever been into, the carpet was filthy and old, sat at a booth and it was so worn out I was sitting on a board, Was hesitant to order food but we all did, I sat there and looked around and started realizing how filthy this restaurant was it was dusty the ceiling had big stains on it all the seats were worn out the walls were smudged and dirty the windows were filthy, I started wondering what I had got myself into, I will get a chili Relleno dinner and it was discuss, it was some chopped up chilies from a can with egg batter which was like an omelette wrapped around it I told the waiter that it was one of most disgusting chili Relleno I have ever tasted, and he told me yeah a lot of people don't like it and turned around and walked away never offering to take it off what I'd like something else, he just walked away, no music was playing in the entire restaurant we could hear ourselves talk because we were the only ones in the restaurant and now I know why! This salsa was disgusting tasted like cheap tomato sauce, The chips are pretty good it would've been nice if they would've been warm instead of cold, I realized the lazy hostess manager server all set around  instead of cleaning since there's nobody coming into the restaurant they could've got a rag and wipe things down! They seem like they just gave up..."}
{"text":"The food was not bad, but long wait to get a glass of water, and then the long wait to place my order, and then to get my food... Not awesome. The waiter was a cool guy. But he was literally the only guy working the whole floor."}
{"text":"Well, on the positive, the service was good and our waiter brought us out this really good chunky salsa, after having eaten the one the come out with the chips, which equates to the packets of pizza sauce that comes with a Lunchable (seriously...tomato paste and maybe some salt and pepper). The food was less than mediocre and quite expensive for the quality and quantity received. I was seriously looking forward to an authentic Mexican dish after having read some of the posts here and what my son and I got for nearly $22, well, was subpar. I was disappointed to say the least in the food and the cost."}
{"text":"I had the #1 dinner with a margarita and beer. The drink was not potent. The beer went down well. The chips are pretty good. The salsa is horrible. It's more like tomato sauce than what I would think of as red sauce from a Mexican restaurant. There was no heat. On a scale of 1-10, it's a 1. 

The food was good. The rice and beans were noticeably better than average. The cheese enchilada was superb. It was my favorite item from the #1 and I'm not a big fan of cheese enchiladas, but it was perfectly melted and flavorful. The beef tamale was also excellent. The masa was moist and the meat was tender. The shredded beef taco was ok. Not outstanding. The bean tostada seemed good but I only tried a bite.

Overall the food was good except for the ketchup like salsa. They need some Tabasco or Chilula on the table as an option. I would visit again."}
{"text":"Just don't eat here.  I didn't know that Heinz made salsa.  Just can't seem to find anything positive to say about this place.  This is a town with a plethora of Mexican Restaurants, so you would think that competition alone would have closed this place.  Just drive over to Sylvia's La Canasta.  Its close, and very good."}
{"text":"Bad. Very bad. Ordered a combo: sour cream enchilada, taco and tostada. The shredded beef in the taco was harder than jerky, the enchilada was an oily mess and the tostada was soggy. 

You can tell a lot about the type of food you are going to have by the salsa. True to form, the red sauce tasted like canned tomato sauce and the chunky sauce was about 80% jalapeno and no flavor.

There was a strange smell in the restaurant and I couldn't wait to leave.

I will not be back"}
{"text":"Tony is amazing. Always knows what we want. Food is always good. It's never been a problem substituting something I don't want. Salsa is so good!"}
{"text":"Unbelievably rude service. The nice gentleman at the front who told us to sit anywhere was the only pleasant portion of this visit. It took the waitress 5 minutes to even bring us menus another 3 to get water. The waitress came over rudley asked if we were ready. I asked for a beer list she snapped at me that they dont have one. I asked what they had she snarled just tell me what you want. I think my disgusted look indicated I was not going to guess what they keep in their bar.  She finally snapped at me what my options were I ordered and we skipped dinner as I couldn't stomach being treated poorly an entire meal. My 2 minute interaction was enough."}
{"text":"I went came here for lunch on a Thursday around noon. There were a number of people here but I was able to get a seat right away and they brought water and chips and salsa to the table right away as well. I could tell there was at least one \"regular\" there as all the waiters knew him by name and came over to say hi. Everyone was upbeat and pleasant. I had a Red Chili Beef burrito plate that came with a cheese enchilada and refried beens and rice. The food was good and took a reasonable amount of time to come out. I had a large portion and left very full. They offered mints and gave me a to go cup of soda for the road. I did think it was a little high priced. I paid around $24 including tax and a 20% tip for just myself. I didn't get any appetizers other than the free chips and I didn't get any desert so though I left stuffed I thought still a little steep."}
{"text":"Disappointed by the salsa they provided us with (tasted like ketchup mixed with chili sauce), but was pleasantly surprised by dinner: Baja tacos and my boyfriend got the shrimp fajitas which we both enjoyed! Staff was below average, but atmosphere, food, and prices were all excellent. Also had very very clean bathrooms! Would definitely come here again, just pass on the salsa and don't have expectations on the staff."}
{"text":"It was OK - Just. Usual fare, usual Mexican decor.  Two negatives.. first, when i ordered my combo plate dinner, i wanted the included enchilada to be a chicken enchilada. The waitress winced and said she didn't know if the owner would 'allow' substitutions. I said Id be happy to pay extra, and she went off to seek the 'owner's' permission.. she returned saying \"no\". Odd.. and it did not strike a welcome tone.
Secondly, I ordered a 'side salad'.. the salad itself seemed fine.. but they clopped a ton of dressing on top of the salad.. so I had to carefully 'stir' my salad, with limited success. Other than that, it was an OK meal."}
{"text":"I love this place!! The waiter -short male--is so friendly!! The best item on the menu is the chicken fajitas!! The best I'd ever had. It was worth the money."}
{"text":"I love this place!   The food is fantastic, the service is fast and friendly and the price is suprisingly low.  With all of the new places popping up in uptown, it is refreshing to go to such an authentic old school phoenix resturaunt."}
{"text":"Jordan's is a central Phoenix classic. Owned by the same family for generations and serving local families that have been coming for generations, as well. The service is quick and friendly. They have the best cheese crisp in town and they serve a butter crisp that is totally addictive! (Not sure if it is listed on the menu though) My kids love the sour cream enchiladas!! I love the red chili and I won't even order it anywhere else because it never compares. 
It has an old school comfortable feel w the big booths and dim light. The dress is totally casual but you'll def see cute older couples w/ their \"fancy shirts\" on for their night out.  I totally recommend going ;)"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service!   Only $6.95 lunch specials and nice sized portions, esp the taco salad. When you see several locals and the waitstaff knows their names you know it's a good place to be! Taylor is friendly, attentive,  and very fast which makes the experience all the more enjoyable!"}
{"text":"I know this place has been around for a long time and that people seem to love it, but honestly, I just can't figure out why. Every time I've had dinner here, the service is awful and the food is only decent.  The server is never around, so if you want a drink refill, I say good luck to you! Our server waited so long to come back one night that my brother and I started to wonder if we were supposed to take our own plates to the kitchen. The only reason I go to Jordan's in the first place is because it's some sort of tradition that when any family member comes into town, we either go here or to Macayo's. I don't know. I just go with it. But what intrigues me the most is that as bad as my experiences here have been, I can tell that other people genuinely like this place.  The staff seems to always know the names of the surrounding diners, which means they're either regulars of this establishment or dare I say it...family members? Either way, I know next time my aunt comes in to town, I'll be back at Jordan's staring at an empty glass of Dr. Pepper and wondering if the server went to Mexico to refill the chip bowl."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for about 30 years. It is still owned by the same people. Their Mexican food is delicious. I especially like the chili relleno  and their cheese enchiladas. I recently had a cheese crisp with the green chili strips melted into the cheese.  It was fantastic.  The inside needs a little remodeling. But it has the old-school look to it. I will be coming back here for many more years!"}
{"text":"Jordan's is literally within shouting distance from where I live. Love going in there for a quick lunch during the business week. Very quick and courteous service. Initially, I thought the hot sauce was actually pizza sauce, but I fell in love with it after several trips there. It's very fresh and tasty, but it's not chunky at all, which for me was misleading. The tacos, enchiladas, beans and rice are on point and authentic-esque. It's American/Mexican food and it's delicious, filling and priced very well. It just is what it is, so don't expect brilliant fine dining Mexican cuisine here. During the work week, go in for a quick bite when you're on a time crunch or hit it up on evenings or weekends for bomb drinks and good grub."}
{"text":"This is old school mexican food at its best.  Love the traditional decor and the older wait staff who seem to have been there for years.  Best of all is their hot sauce.  Nothing like it any where.  Best taco and enchilada in town.

If you want a trendy, fancy place this is not for you, but if you want the best traditional mexican food served by the same family for generations, Jordans is just the place."}
{"text":"Best salsa ( ask for the chunky) ever!  Everything we ordered was excellent.  I got chicken chimichanga, and my husband got some combo plate.  Also got a cheese crisp.  No complaints about anything.  Service was fast and friendly.  Mexican food is my absolute favorite and I have eaten almost everywhere.  This may be my new fav!"}
{"text":"Well I know this place is a staple of PHX and has been around since the 40's....but I'm sorry to say I was not impressed. Hopefully my review will help them improve for future guests....
1. We were seated, brought bowls and salsa right away....but no chips for a little bit
2. Appetizer was brought out , but no silverware or napkins, 
3. I ordered a coffee asked for creamer, coffee was like warm before the creamer was brought out
4. The red chili chimi and sour cream cream enchilada we ordered were both pretty bland. 
5. For it being a Friday night they definitely seemed understaffed , the group behind us sat for about 15 mins before having their order taken. 
6. I have def encountered friendlier hostess'"}
{"text":"The best Mexican food comes in family owned restaurants and Jordan's (55 years) proves it.
Wonderful fresh Mexican dinners served in a warm environment by an outstanding waitstaff.
We be back indeed."}
{"text":"There are no other Mexican Food restraunts in the Phoenix area that I have been going to longer than Jordan's.  Its just good comfort Mexican food.  A Phoenix tradition. I love the sauce and love putting it on everything."}
{"text":"Dark, dingy atmosphere.  We ended up getting a beer and then going to a real/different Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Terrible. For a city so lavishly seasoned with some of the best Mexican food on the planet, this place coulnt have been worse if it tried. Outdated, dingy, dining space and help. I love me a good hole in the wall, but Jordan's can't even hit that mark. Avoid it!!!"}
{"text":"I think Jordan's is a staple for the community. It's one of those restaurants that make you feel like you live in a small town. I've been going to Jordan's since before I could walk. My dad grew up eating Jordan's with his friends and we always went here for a quick mexican bite. Now I'll tell you I didn't always love the salsa. It's strange and I can't explain why but after years and years of coming here as a kid I fell in love with it. I now probably eat Jordan's at least once a week. The food is affordable and while the service isn't \"express\" the wait staff is always friendly. A few of them even remember my order before I order it. For the people who think it's gross. Not every place has amazing everything. Jordan's definitely has its super star items. I always get the tamales, tostadas, open cheese crisps and flautas. As for the salsa they have the same old salsa every other place has as well. Just ask them and they will bring it out for you and if you ever have a problem talk to the sweet man who owns the place. Help keep places like Jordan's around instead of generic places like Chilis."}
{"text":"Great Fajitas, green chile burrito enchilada style.  Good service quick and pleasant!"}
{"text":"Great service. Great food. Guacamole is extremely good! Love the atmosphere. Recommend this place."}
{"text":"Stopped in yesterday to try out something new. Wow it was amazing. We made it in after lunch and was pleasantly greeted. The decor reminded me of the kinds of Mexican restaurants I ate at 15 years ago very traditional. We had four dishes cheese crisp, machaca chimmy, sour cream taco, and rellendo(my Spanish spelling is horrible). 
Everything was amazing and the tab was only $30 dollars. The server was super friendly and professional, I will be back many more times!!!"}
{"text":"So originally we were going to Joe's Midnight Run but the wait was too long so we drove down the street to Jordan's. Our booth seat was covered in crumbs.. the waiter was awesome, but everything else sucked. It was so quiet we heard the next tables entire conversation and it didn't feel Mexican or upbeat at all just not a good vibe. The food was so bland and they didn't even have hot sauce! What kind of Mexican food restaurant doesn't have hot sauce!? Like no Valentina? No tapatio? They did have this weird ketchup sauce that was not spicy at all.. but all 4 of us decided we won't be back. Sorry.."}
