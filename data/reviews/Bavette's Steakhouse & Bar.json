{"text":"This was a disappointment the food was just mediocre at best. The $85 steak was the biggest disappointment. They couldn't even make a good pot of coffee. The candied sweet potatoes were the only thing worth ordering again. Save yourself a $$$ and pick a different steakhouse in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Can this really only be day 3? Three days ago, Bavette's opened for business. We walked in feeling like celebs into which felt like a thirty year-old establishment with a mile long reservation list. Great bar, even better food, and brilliantly well staffed and trained in the finest."}
{"text":"My husband I love Bavette's in Chicago, and this location did not disappoint.  The bone marrow is to die for... so buttery and rich.  I'm ready to go back!"}
{"text":"Best Steakhouse in the world! Great atmosphere, excellent service, and high quality food. I always order their filet mignon with a side of mac and cheese, and brussel sprouts. Their sourdough bread is delicious."}
{"text":"Very upscale restaurant. If you're thinking about going...dress up! The food is amazing. The steak is so tender you can cut it with a butter knife. The pork chop is very juicy and nicely seasoned. We had the truffle mac and cheese and it was hands down one of the best I've had. Expect to pay approximately  $160 for two people but so worth it. Carlos, our waiter, was very attentive, entertaining, and knowledgeable of the choices on the menu. The only negative thing I have to say is lighting is very very dim. I guess your eyes eventually adjust but it was still very dark for me."}
{"text":"So, in general, I don't like Yelp or find Yelp reviews accurate. And people who are Yelp \"Elite\"... your reviews are obnoxious and you should find something better to do with your time...after you watch South Park. But I figured this Bavette's was worth my first review. My girlfriend and I went here yesterday on opening night. It's our favorite steakhouse in Chicago, hands down and we've celebrated her birthday there two years in a row (in Chicago), now three years in a row with our visit to the Monte Carlo location. Bottom line, if you're a local, don't stay away because it's in the Monte Carlo. The food is just as good as the original in Chicago, and the staff is somehow even friendlier. The menu is exactly the same as Chicago. Must gets: Any of the bone-in steaks, the elote style corn side, the bacon and tomato salad (it's actually huge slabs of pork belly. They also have kept the same corkage fee policy they have in Chicago: waived so long as you share or exchange one glass with a random table. But, don't take my word for it. Listen to Phil Vittel (Chicago food critic) or Chicago Magazine (http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/November-2017/Chicagos-Best-Steakhouses-2017/) I've been to to 7 of their top 10. It's number one on their list, and deserves to be. They even have several managers from Chicago living in the hotel working to make sure it lives up to their standards. Only caveat I can think of: traffic might be a pain during Golden Knights home games, so leave a little earlier."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and service in a beautiful setting.    We ordered two entrees - a petite filet and the fried chicken.  The filet was cooked perfectly and was delicious.  When you order a filet at this price point, this is what you expect and Bavette's delivered.  The fried chicken was possibly the best we've ever had. The spice blend is unique and the chicken was cooked perfectly.  A very moist delicious alternative to beef.  We had the creamed spinach for a side. This was prepared differently to the more traditional version, containing both onions and cheese.   The dessert list was impressive.  We opted for the carrot cake. Great choice as it's nothing short of extraordinary.  Simultaneously light and dense and not overly sweet. A home run.  If you don't have time for the entire meal,  you could do worse than dessert and a cocktail while sitting at the beautiful bar.  We thoroughly enjoyed our experience and hope to return many times."}
{"text":"Amazing food the 16 oz bone in filet was like cutting thru butter and the goat cheese with duck is Also a must get appetizer and Gaga is the most amazing server"}
{"text":"I recently went here a few days after it opened and all I can say is WOW! Usually when I go to a restaurant opening it still has some kinks to work out but this restaurant runs like a machine!  We loved it so much we came back a few weeks later with our friends who love steak and at the next table was Frankie Valli. You wouldn't expect such a beautiful and large restaurant from the outside but it feels like you are transported to another era. All of the food was amazing. I highly recommend the crab cake. It is huge and basically an entree unless you split it with 2 or 3 people. The sourdough bread and butter is the most delicious and fresh bread I have had in a while. The steak is of course fantastic, but that goes without saying. The only thing is the restaurant is very dark so if you have trouble seeing it might not be the place for you. PS, the water service is hardcore. I take a sip or two and the waiter is right there filling my glass back up every second. I guess I like that because I can never have too much water in Vegas."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best kept secrets on the Vegas Strip!! The atmosphere is sensual and speakeasy like and the food is absolutely mind blowing!  I had the filet, sprouts, & Mac & cheese that made me want to smack someone they were so good. There is also a hidden gem in the back...??  A must in Vegas!  I'm going back next week."}
{"text":"JOHN gave great service!! Loved the decor inside... the garlic shrimp, crab cake, and brussel sprouts were my favorite"}
{"text":"Was there the first week they opened. Nice restaurant, the bread was unbelievable. The staff was great. I think the seafood tower is a bit overvalued. The steaks were ok as well. Nothing really special. I'd go back but probably order one or two things that are good on the menu."}
{"text":"This is a great new steakhouse hidden within the under construction Monte Carlo. Great food, service, and ambience. I had the petite fillet, elote style corn,  and garlic shrimp de jonghe."}
{"text":"You have to go here! Very cool decor, amazing food, and attentive and friendly staff. One of the best meals I've had! I ordered the Filet and my husband got the salmon. Both were wonderful. We also split the broccoli and truffle mac and cheese. Drinks were great! Seriously everything was great! Some of the most amazing broccoli I've ever had! We had other high priced meals in Vegas, but this one is worth every penny!"}
{"text":"Exceptional!  Great Atmosphere. Great Service. Excellent Food. Bavette's is a must try if you find yourself in Vegas. Well balanced flavors and complimentary sides. If you are looking to splurge a little, I assure you they will not disappoint."}
{"text":"This meal made us emotional. Here's what we ordered:  The 22 oz. dry aged bone in ribeye, the creamed spinach, the elotes style corn, the buttery mashed potatoes, the carrot cake, and the chocolate pie. We were sharing the steak and asked if they would bring it to the table whole so that we could slice it ourselves so it didn't lose its juices and they were more than happy to oblige. We ordered the steak the way the chef wanted to cook it and that is always the best way to order a steak. It came out medium rare with a delicious charred crust and every single bite of it was perfect. The mashed potatoes were delicious, the elotes style corn was out of this world, but the creamed spinach almost made me cry. If you do not like blue cheese you will not like this creamed spinach, but otherwise it's one of the most incredible things you will ever put in your mouth. Just the smell of the chocolate pie is enough for dessert, but go ahead and eat it AND the carrot cake. You won't regret it. The service is 5 star, the ambiance is lovely, and the food is worth every penny. Eat here."}
{"text":"The filet mignon was cooked perfectly. It was soft and tasty. Oysters were good for starters. They do not have much choices for dessert. Cocktails were also goos. Service is excellent."}
{"text":"From the drinks to the entree's are absolutely delish! The steaks are to die for!! Definitely would recommend to come here. Staff are very friendly & polite"}
{"text":"This place is Legit! Salmon was really fresh! Buddy of mine had Steak- to die! Brussels were the best I've ever had! The mashed potatoes are just like Grandmas!!! The BEST!!!"}
{"text":"I think I found my new favorite steakhouse in Vegas...and it's not just because of the food. Both the delicious menu and the excellent service make me want to already book another reservation.  The atmosphere is gorgeous. Stunning. You forget you're in a casino. It's dimly lit with a speakeasy feel and gorgeous decor. The bar is so beautiful. It somewhat reminds me of Herbs and Rye if you've been there. They even have a little speakeasy lounge in the back.  My sister took me here as a graduation gift and unfortunately I was not feeling too well when we got there. The server was nice enough to ask my sister if they needed someone to check on me in the restroom and make sure I was okay. I found that so sweet and I really wish I remembered his name. He was working a Sunday night.  Beyond that nice gesture he gave us amazing recommendations and even though my stomach felt bad at the beginning, I still managed to eat way too much!! The two of us could barely dent the food we ate, and we had two giant to-go bags after. Don't worry, around midnight that night we consumed all of it. It's so delicious we couldn't save it to eat the next day.   The crab cake was soft and delicious. We also got I believe a half pound of lobster with butter. WOW. It was beautiful just to look at but tasted even better. Even their butter for dipping tasted better than usual. We also got steak, mac n cheese, elote corn and Brussels sprouts. You can't go wrong with any. I can't remember what steak we got but it cut like butter. So delicious. The corn and the Mac n cheese is a must. I devoured that corn during the meal and later that night. I'm a big \"elote\" savant and this is probably one of my favorites from a steakhouse.  We ended the meal with a sundae about the size of my head that came with all types of candy toppings. We were so stuffed I think the staff was surprised how we barely touched it but I promise you guys we ate so much! It was so tasty.  The assistant general manager was very attentive and made sure we had a great experience. Thank you Bavettes for the kind service and understanding when two girls could barely dent our food. It was a delicious meal/late night snack and I will be back ASAP."}
{"text":"Best steak ever. If you love bone marrow. This is the place. It's a great Wall of bone marrow. Best old fashioned I've ever had (hibiki). Maybe I should get out more but this place will stay in my mind for awhile. And our server Brian is awesome. The service was so memorable I remembered his name! Will definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Here is the 3-1-1:   Food: Old school themed with a classic menu of various cuts of steak and other meat options. So, for our dinner we went for the Chicago Classic rib eye which was medium rare and served with a side of béarnaise; the meat was very tender but for a rib eye it did not have a lot of fat, so it tasted more like a filet. The bone in rib eye was super tender and it tasted completely different from the Classic as they fat content was far more present.... a great piece of meat! The sides of brussels sprouts that were tender and charred really made it a flavor explosion; truffle mac & cheese, a definite must have as the cheese oozing with truffle essence; the wild mushrooms completed the tri fecta as this garlicy, buttered plate of goodness was a perfect pairing. Great pics on their website: http://bavettessteakhouse.com/las-vegas/food/  Service: Though they were busy our waiter was still very attentive and provided a nice level of service as he checked on periodically and made sure things were going well.  Ambiance: Classic, dark and old school jazz piped throughout the restaurant. Very spacious with the sound level pleasant so conversations don't have to be loud."}
{"text":"The best steakhouse in Las Vegas. Excellent food, service and drinks. I highly recommend the bone marrow, goat cheese and steak tartare. For dinner we had the lamb chops, aged rib eye and the 10 oz filet mignon. Food was exquisite!"}
{"text":"Had dinner with three other couples and the food was wonderful, the ambiance perfect but the service was a little off. I'm not sure why but that does happen sometimes.  I will definitely give it another try as all of my friend's love the place. I would recommend it and feel comfortable you will enjoy the food too!"}
{"text":"Welp. People weren't kidding about this place. One of the best meals I've had in a really long time. A must go!"}
{"text":"As we sat down, the waitress brought us bread. So far so good. Then we ordered our cocktails. They kept interrupting our conversation as if the were rushing us out. We ordered our main course, with sides. Again, we were interrupted constantly. They brought us our food with sides, and took our bread and plates away, not even asking if we were finished. As we started to eat our sides, each one of us bit into Chuncks of salt. The next bite was again, Chuncks of salt.  We had no bread, because they took it away. I do not recommend this restaurant if you want to eat good food and have great conversation with your company. The $$$ was not worth it. The scenery was beautiful and the music background was nice."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for our two year wedding anniversary and we had the most amazing experience. Our server AJ was the best and everything you hope a server to be. He was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and was able to offer suggestions for us. The food was incredible. We shared the 22oz ribeye, the crab cake, and the bone marrow. I highly recommend this place to anyone and I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Arrived here around 6:30-7pm came here for a bachelor party so we rolled in here with 24 guys which we had about 6 tables put together in a section off area we had our best man do all the ordering with all the steaks ordered divided up to each table along with oysters, bone marrow, roasted Brussel sprouts, Mac and cheese. If you plan on coming here plan to send a lot. The ages rib eye was my favorite. Forgot to take some pictures of the meat since it was being devoured so quick by the guys."}
{"text":"WOW.  Ambiance - Check.  Service - Check.  Food - Check.  Bavette's ambiance is \"dark and moody\" (per our waiter, John), creating a very elegant and relaxing stage for an unforgettable dinner.  The lighting creates a challenge when trying to read the menu, but there are little lamps on each table which offers some assistance without blinding everyone with your iPhone flashlight (yes, I tried that).    John was an outstanding waiter.  I can't rave enough about him!  He impeccably described every item on the menu that our group inquired about and everything out of his mouth was absolutely eargasmic.  He exquisitely painted a portrait of each menu item in such a manner that it was almost as if he were the executive chef himself!  I also need to praise John for being able to handle our group and \"gracefully back away\" when needed.  Lol.  I'm not much of a salad gal, but John sold me when he said the bacon on the wedge salad was made in house and cooked 4 different ways (mind blown).  The salad itself was your standard wedge salad, but that was seriously the best piece of bacon ever!  I would order just a side of bacon next time I eat here.  As the main entree, the 22 ounce bone in ribeye that has been aged for 42 days is definitely something that everyone needs to experience.  It was rich and full of flavor, and not super fatty as most ribeyes tend to be.  For sides, the table shared the truffle mac n cheese (super cheesy and with a touch of velveeta, yes I said velveeta, to make it extra creamy), elote (rich and creamy), brussel sprouts (can't ever go wrong with this) and extra decadent mashed potatoes (super buttery with roasted garlic on top).  The mashed potatoes are a must have, in my opinion!  To top it all off, please treat yourself to a slice of carrot cake.  It has a rum wash on the side to seal in the moisture.  Even if you're full, just order a slice for the table to try.  You won't regret it!    I will definitely be back to Bavette's on my next visit to Vegas!  If I could, I would give it 10 stars!!!"}
{"text":"Very good steak and wine pairing! But just know that it's super expensive (that's why I have to give it a 4 Star for value)."}
{"text":"This is the sister restaurant of their Chicago location that is incredible.   It's sitting in the old Monte Carlo now called the Park MGM - definitely a superb high end choice  I recommend you try the speakeasy bar in the back of the restaurant - you cannot see it, it's around the corner and super cool  The martinis are decently sized, the bartenders are solid and knowledgeable.   Awesome   The steaks are cooked to perfection!"}
{"text":"This place was excellent for being first time customers. The hostess was amazing! I never had reservations and I didn't realize you needed one. But she was very nice and said wait a few seconds, and she seated us in the back by the bar. Our waitress was wonderful! She took very good care of us! She noticed right off the bat that we were form Hawai'i because of the way we speak. And the most cool thing was, she was from there too! Now living in Vegas for about a year. The food was wonderful and everything was cooked to our liking! The ribeye was so tasty and the roasted garlic melted in your mouth like butter. I was very shocked that the baked potato was not just one but two of them! I could only eat one. The dessert was very good as well. We had the sundae with the candies and little side stuff. We didn't use everything in the candy trays but it was enough for what we ate along with the ice cream.  I would definitely go back again to have this same experience, except I will make reservations before going unexpectedly. Haha"}
{"text":"this place rocks!  love the back bar.  if you can't find the steak you want, it does not exist!  A must is the old fashioned, but try it with cogna  Professional staff and all the waiters know the details to the menu.  The GM, Sean Michael,  stopped by to make all was good.  it was beyond good, it was excellent.  best steak house in Vegas!  a must stop!"}
{"text":"This restaurant spells CLASS!  Love this steakhouse and is by far the best I've been to!  The décor is beautiful.  The ambiance was so cozy and I LOVE the darkness!  It was funny to watch everyone pull their flashlights out to read the menu but here's a tip...hold your menu under the little lamp on your table and you'll see your menu. :-)  Once you've ordered, sit back and enjoy!  Our waitress was amazing.  The staff was amazing.  Never a dirty dish left on the table and our glasses were constantly being refilled.  Service at it's finest.  The food...OMG!  It was so good!  I loved the bone marrow and the filet mignon melted in my mouth!  The spinach was good but a little on the rich side and the candied yams were delicious!  The chocolate pie was delicious but very very rich and dense.  I could only eat a few bites.  I kid you not, if I could hop on a plane tomorrow from San Diego to Las Vegas, I would!  I would fly there just to eat at this restaurant and head home!!  It was an amazing dinner and experience!"}
{"text":"This Chicago inspired restaurant was amazing. The setting is great, dark and chill. The service was exceptional and our waiter was very personable. The food was absolutely delicious, I can't complain about any of it. I ordered the salmon and my boyfriend ordered the rib eye, we shared a Mac and cheese and some French fries! Omg, so delicious I can't rave about it enough. They also serve warm bread, which was perfect, it's very filling so don't order an appetizer unless you are STARVING. Oh, I also ordered a salad which I definitely recommend, LYONNAISE SALAD. We will be back for round 2!"}
{"text":"This is a beautiful restaurant. A little dark when you first get seated but your eyes adjust. We went twice and It was amazing. Service and staff are first rate and the steaks are the best we've ever had. We will be returning at the end of the month and will take pics. Awesome restaurant"}
{"text":"We had a fantastic experience last night at Bavette's.  Our waitress was attentive and very knowledgeable.  The steaks were cooked perfectly and the side dishes that our waitress recommended matched up perfectly.  The GM even came over to say \"hello\" which was a nice touch and a good ending to a great meal."}
{"text":"Stellar service! Food was AAAAAHHHMAZINGGG! Cooked to perfection.  Very large portions, can definitely share with one other person. The mac and cheese makes you wanna smack ya momma. The chocolate cream pie is decadent and so rich yum. The lillet rose martini is just ridiculous,  I would drink that in a pitcher if I could, so smooth. The ambience is so cool, I felt like I walked into an old 20's era social club. Very cozy, a bit dark but thats what i most loved. It has a style to it, even the plateware was dainty and unique with pink flower print on it.  I cannot wait to go back.  Lastly, they have a hidden back room where they have lounge sofas, totally worth coming for juat a cocktail and convo!"}
{"text":"The fiance and I treated ourselves to a fabulous dinner at Bavette's for our big date night out in Vegas.  Bavette's is an incredible steakhouse and we thoroughly enjoyed our time here.  It's located in the former Monte Carlo soon to be Park MGM.  A sneaky door with a Bavette sign located on the casino floor will take you to this phenomenal steakhouse.  Upon entering, you'll find yourself in a cozy, well decorated lounge inspired by everything Gatsby.  Dim lighting from Tiffany lamps, endless velour, tasteful brass finishes and more will take you back in time.  It took less than 5 minutes for us to be seated, and we were presented with a cozy table near the bar.  My favorite part about this place is their corkage fee policy.  Typically the corkage fee is $50, but if you are willing to share a glass of wine with another patron in the room your fee is waved.  Of course we did this - we could not not take advantage.  We were more than happy to share a glass of our Cabernet Sauvignon with a fellow diner - and watching their reaction when they received the glass was priceless.   Now, the food. Everything we ate was delicious - it rivals any steak dinner we've had in NYC. We shared the mixed green and apple salad ($16) and it was more than enough for the two of us.  We shared everything else as well. The bone-in ribeye (medium rare) was phenomenal ($85).  The steak was perfectly cooked with a flavorful crust and melted in our mouths.  It came with bernaise sauce, but the steak was so flavorful we did not use it.  We had a difficult time selecting sides as there were so many delightful options, but we were not disappointed with the brussels sprouts ($14) and the buttery mashed potatoes ($13).  Out of the two, the spuds won.   Service was good overall - we were not rushed and took our time enjoying our meal.  The restaurant has only been open a few months, but I'm sure it's going to be one of the hottest spots in Vegas once construction at the hotel is finished. Beat the crowd and check it out!"}
{"text":"One of the better restaurants I've been to in Vegas. Oysters tasted like we were on the coast and not in the middle of the desert. Steak tartare on point served with thick and moist bread. Got the ribeye which came with bearnaise sauce, which was good but the steak didn't need it since it stood on its own. Highly recommended but be sure to get a reservation."}
{"text":"Had an incredible steak dinner at Bavette's, probably the best dining experience we've had on the strip. The 6oz fillet was perfect. We shared the baked potato, creamed corn (Mexican style) started with the tartare and ended with the carrot cake. Our budget wouldn't allow regular meals here, as it's not cheap, but was worth the expense for a special meal."}
{"text":"I love going to the strip when I'm home for a special dinner, and this year we chose Bavette's to try for my boyfriends birthday. I really loved the decor on the inside, really old Vegas vibes and the bar in the middle of the restaurant is BEAUTIFUL. The drinks were amazing, and definitely on the pricey side, but if you're dining here I'm assuming money isn't an issue.   For dinner I had the Filet and it was cooked just how I asked (medium well) and was topped with crab. They called it the Oscar topping and it was amazing. We also tried the Brussels sprouts and the corn which were mouth watering and full of flavor.    All together it was a top of the line dining experience. It's VERY dark inside so bring glasses if you have a hard time reading in the dark. Considering you have your pick of world class restaurants in Las Vegas, Bavette's got four stars from me."}
{"text":"We recently dined here while staying at the Monte Carlo. I chose it mainly for convenience and am glad I did. The ambiance and service was pretty low key, so if you're looking for a flashy Vegas experience you'll want to choose a celebrity chef place instead. Our server was good if not a little too quiet. Our ears were still ringing from a two day concert. We started with the baked goat cheese app....it was perfect with an unexpected depth in the tomatoes that can really only be achieved by reducing a sauce over time. Really good. Onto the steaks: I had the duchess cut filet. The only reason I didn't get one of the dry aged steaks was simply due to the size of them and no way to keep leftovers. It was cooked and seasoned perfectly. We really enjoyed the wild mushrooms on the side, also cooked very well. But that bernaise.....probably the best I've ever had!! Husby had the aged new york strip and felt the same as I did. All of the flavors were spot on. Wish we'd had room for dessert!"}
{"text":"The service is remarkable.  The steak is wonderfully prepared but the CREAMED SPINACH and sour dough bread ,was by far the best! Very pricy but ambience was outstanding. We loved our English waiter. They tend to check on you too often, if there is such a thing. I recommend  this place to anyone without children or a tight budget. Our steak, alone was $85 .It was 22 oz. But sides are extra and not cheap. Tasty , to say the least"}
{"text":"Delicious food, old world vibes inside, and our waitress Gaga was very entertaining. The cocktails are also one of a kind. Overall we had an amazing time"}
{"text":"Wow, great steaks, great drinks, and great service.  Our server Brian was super attentive and very professional.  Yes the meal was a little pricey, but isn't that what Vegas is about?    By the way, a quick Mark Wahlberg sighting while we were eating..."}
{"text":"ined at Bavette's recently for a belated birthday dinner.  Upon entering the venue, it's very dimly lit and old Chicago style speak easy design/interior.  We enjoyed great service from our server Kristen who was very pleasant and attentive.  Based on our review of the menu and some of Kristen's recommendations - we had a good variety of items:  the Garlic Shrimp, Crab Avocado salad, Classic Ribeye (which we shared), side order of mac & cheese and Brussel sprouts and a nice bottle of wine.   Everything was really great -  I'd say the salad and Brussel sprouts really stood out.  The steak was cooked perfect but a little fatty but to be expected with this cut of steak.  We were stuffed but Kristen was kind enough to have a complimentary b'day desert sent out which was a nice touch.  There is a really cool - back room in the restaurant - almost like a private lounge area if you are looking for something more intimate (no tvs and small space)  -  you wouldn't even know it's there.  A nice and needed addition to the Park MGM property and a great option to go to before or after a show at Park Theater or T-Mobile.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"Top notch - Steakhouse in Las Vegas!  Highly Recommended!  Brussels Sprouts and wild mushrooms perfectly combined.  Definitely would come back!"}
{"text":"Both the filet and New York steaks were dry and flavorless.  The filet was unevenly cooked, half medium rare as ordered, the other half medium plus.  The baked potato tasted as though it had been baked the night before, refrigerated, then reheated.  The service was mediocre.  I gather this place has issues with consistency; won't be returning or recommending to friends."}
{"text":"It was our first time staying at the Park MGM which is the newly renovated Monte Carlo Resort and Casino. There are only a few restaurants here, so far. My fiancé and I already checked out Primrose which we loved for brunch, and we were really looking forward to going to Bavette's. It was late on a Friday night, and we were nervous that we wouldn't get in but we tried anyway. It sort of looks closed from the outside and it's also a very dimly lit restaurant. When we walked in, the hostess greeted us kindly and told us that they could definitely take us without a reservation. However, she said we only had about a half hour until the kitchen closed. We quickly found our table and we were greeted right away by our phenomenal server, Brian. He asked us if we had ever dined here before and also if we had been to Bavette's in Chicago. This is a Chicago style restaurant, and my fiancé, being from the Midwest had a lot of questions for him. We decided to split a steak and also start with the crabcakes and salmon Caesar salad. We went back-and-forth with a few wine options and Danielle came over to help us pair of the right wine with our meal. They let us sample a few before we decided on a nice, full-bodied Cabernet. Everything was delicious. I highly recommend the crab cakes. For the price, there was a ton of food. The steak was delicious, the Caesar salad was so good-Brian recommended that we get a smaller portion and even the small portion is huge. We had such a great time, the service was great - Brian and Danielle took a lot of photos of us so that we could remember our experience. Brian even walked me all the way to the bathroom. The place wasn't super busy but it was also kind of late. The environment was close to a Chicago downtown restaurant, again - dimly lit and romantic. I definitely recommend going here and I would even return back."}
{"text":"We were so excited to try a new steakhouse in Las Vegas! Overall,  I'd say we have mixed feelings about this place.  I really think it's a very cool space. The atmosphere is great,  the music is neat,  and it's very comfortable.  The service was good, not the best I've had.  We had a male server and I noticed that the table near us being served by a female seemed to get excellent service, so perhaps it depends on who you get.    The portions on apps, salads, sides, and desserts are large and by Vegas standards somewhat reasonably priced.  The steak we ordered, well that's another story.  We decided to share the 22oz prime dry aged rib eye.  The price point on all of the steaks is very high.  We  have eaten at several Las Vegas steak houses and our expectations for the steak were high, because we know what prime dry-aged ribeye should be.   Unfortunately,  the steak wasn't very flavorful and was actually on the dry side.  There was a very thick crust , perhaps too much, that made the steak seem overcooked (we ordered medium rare and it tasted more like medium well).  The downside to the restaurant being dimly lit is that you can't see the doneness on your steak.   The apps, sides, salads, and dessert we ate were pretty good, so I'd consider going back and trying something other than a steak.   For that price point, it's just not worth it, there are many other steak houses in Las Vegas that do it right.    Here's another cool thing about the restaurant: they have a good corkage policy:  the fee is waived if you share a glass with another table.  You can bring one standard bottle for every two diners in your party."}
{"text":"I have never been to a restaurant that I can honestly say that the restaurant itself has taken my breath away. Bavette's is that restaurant. The pictures that you see online do not do the place justice. Don't let the bombed out exterior of the Monte Carlo keep you away from Bavette's.  When you walk into Bavette's you are thrown back in time to when Vegas as Vegas. No neon lights or celebrity chefs. Just a relaxed environment and great food. The male wait staff wear tuxedos. The female wait staff wear beautiful, yet practical, cocktail dresses. You are surrounded by dark wood and crushed red velvet booths. The lighting is perfectly dimmed and the sound level encourages conversation. Truly, a romantic restaurant.  The food at Bavette's is incredible and the wait staff let you take your time enjoying it. Our reservation was at 8 and we were seated at a table near the BEAUTIFUL bar. Albert was our waiter and took really good care of us. He was very old school in that he checked on us enough, but not to the point of bothering us. As an appetizer, we tried something new. We enjoyed the Peppered Duck and Goat Cheese Terrine. This was new in that my wife thought she ordered something else. lol This particular dish was actually really good. The apricot mustard withe the terrine itself made for a salty/sweet flavor. Then we ordered the wedge salad. Just because I love wedge salads. The salad wasn't actually in the form of a wedge, but I didn't care. It was more of a chopped salad. The salad was incredible. Peppered bacon, egg, gorgonzola, ranch dressing, and onion. The beautiful thing was the chunks of gorgonzola you would run across that were covered in bacon at times. So good. An epicurean orgasm. lol My wife ordered the Double Cut Berkshire Pork Chop. It was served with wild mushrooms and was so tender. I ordered the the Beef Short Rib Stroganoff. The noodles were hand made and it had button mushrooms in it. I was in heaven! I can honestly say that if you are going to try any dish at Bavette's, have the stroganoff. And if you are going to order any of the sides, you have to have the Brussels Sprouts. They are charred and tossed in dijon mustard and parmesan cheese. Sadly, we were too full for dessert, so I drank my Manhattan instead.There is a lounge in the back of the restaurant that rivals the restaurant itself in its beauty.   Bavette's is on my radar now because it is truly a special place. So if you are looking for a quiet alternative to the craziness of Vegas, then give Bavette's a try."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. The service was awesome. Although we were there at 5 pm on a Tuesday. The bartender made my dirty martini exactly how I asked and they even brought over a celebratory dessert for my sisters birthday."}
{"text":"I've eaten at a lot of amazing steak houses! This one is definitely my favorite. The ambiance, the service, the spectacular food is on a different level.  You might get a little bit of sticker shock coming here, but I promise it's worth it."}
{"text":"Amazing experience dining here while on a short trip to Vegas. The restaurant itself is in the casino and pretty easy to miss if you're not looking for it. Inside it is cozy and even though it was pretty busy, it did not seem too packed. A strange thing, and probably my only complaint, was that there were plenty of open tables but they sat us at a tiny table in between (and extremely close to) two separate parties which was awkward. The waiter was very attentive and helpful. He advised us not to order two separate entrees but instead to share one, which turned out to be amazing advice. We started by ordering drinks which were very strong but had good flavor. The bread that was brought out prior to our meal was probably the best we've ever had at any restaurant! We could not stop eating it. Since we weren't in the mood for steak, we chose to share the Spicy Chicken (which came with mashed potatoes and gravy) and also shared the mac and cheese and creamed spinach sides. The sides themselves could have been a meal, they were absolutely incredible and I could not recommend them enough. My boyfriend loved the chicken, but personally it was probably my least favorite of the food we ordered. Which was fine because I was so full from the sides/bread. For dessert, we got the chocolate pie which was absolutely incredible. Overall a great experience and would definitely return next time we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"We had dinner there Christmas Eve and this is the quintessential Chicago steakhouse!  It is dark with great beef and booze. We found it to be amazing. Vegas is full of steakhouses but this place is at the top of the pack. The drinks were excellent. The steaks were to die for and the service was amazing. Give this places try. You won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"GREAT place! Delicious food! Top 5 best steak I had in my life! Super cool atmosphere and the service was impeccable. I loved the beer that I had and the selection of food was extensive. The food was pricey, but it's what you would expect from a place as classy as this! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great hidden gem in Vegas. Phenomenal food and a great wine list. We had the rib-eye, truffled Mac and cheese, and a bottle of Faust Cabernet. All amazing"}
{"text":"Top-notch service, food and drinks!  The steak was perfectly made and their sides are large enough to share."}
{"text":"This Cajun guy is here to ILLUMINATE YOU!!! This is the best so far me & Mary has eaten in!!! Service Best, Food Outstanding, ohhhh...\"SARSAPARILLA\" aka alcohol super, & ambiance SUPER!!! Get a seat at the bar & ask for James. (Get Bartender) this is a must place!!! Only been open 2-months but still!!!!!!!! Come"}
{"text":"We decided to splurge on a really nice steakhouse, and Bavette's delivered with a couple of the best steaks we've ever had. I had the bone in NY Strip, and I desperately wanted to knaw all of the remaining meat off of the bone. (I reluctantly deferred to the general elegance of the restaurant.)  My wife had the petite filet and loved it. She added the mushrooms, but she was a little disappointed with them.)  Our sides were the pommes frites and corn, which were both amazingly good. Even though we were stuffed, we still found room for a slice of chocolate cream pie...and we're glad we did.  We generally don't frequent expensive restaurants like this, but we're glad we went to Bavette's. It was an amazing, memorable evening."}
{"text":"Currently my favorite steakhouse on the Strip!  We have been staying at the newly renovated Park MGM the past couple of Vegas visits (at least once a month) but we have not tried any of the hotel's restaurants, until now, and I am glad we did! Since we had a comp room, we decided why not splurge a little on food. My husband & I wanted Roasted Bone Marrow and Dry Aged Steak, so Bavette's it is! Located inside the Park MGM Casino, enter to a dark red velvet room & you'll feel like you're in a different era.  Our server, Gaga, was amazing! She checked often to make sure everything was great. Also, our water glasses were never empty (& I drink a lot of water!)  Now on the Food, we ordered everything we wanted that night. 1. Roasted Bone Marrow Appetizer: You can't find a better deal on Bone Marrow on the Strip than at Bavette's. For $24, you get 6 halves!! Most places serve 2-3 halves, and for a lot more than $24.  2. 42-Day Dry Aged Bone In Ribeye, NEED I SAY MORE?!  3. Garlic Shrimp: YUM!   4. Baked Sweet Potato: My side of choice, I love sweet potatoes. This was almost perfect, although I could have gone for a little less butter/sugar since I like my SPs more natural ;) Next time!  5. Truffle Mac & Cheese: This was my kids' order and they enjoyed it. However, it's not as 'truffle-y' as most Truffle dishes I've tried. I still enjoyed it though :)  6. Tokyo ______ Old Fashioned: I forgot the full name since it was my husband's drink, but I quote; \"The best old fashioned I've had\", and he's tried a lot, so must have been great!  Desserts: We ordered 1 scoop of Vanilla Ice Cream and they offer complimentary hot fudge or goldbrick, or since our server is awesome, she gave us both ;) And as a cake lover, I had to try their carrot cake, and it's so good! Spiced more than the average carrot cake, it was perfect!  Over all we are definitely coming back! We love everything about Bavette's!"}
{"text":"Great dining experience, great wine selection, and the brussel sprouts were amazing. We did 3 cuts of steak family style and they were good. Crab cake appetizer was also a crowd favorite."}
{"text":"Delicious- steaks cooked perfectly! Our sever, Vanessa, was very nice and knowledgeable! We'll definitely be back. Our food was taking longer than usual (we weren't in a hurry, so no big deal) and we were given complimentary salads and a round of drinks- without asking."}
{"text":"We came here for my partner's birthday. What a great choice! The bone marrow entree is a huge portion and very filling. We also had the steak with frites which was cooked perfectly and came with fantastic sauces. We split the bone marrow, steak with frites, mushroom side and Brussels sprouts side. It was more than enough food. We couldn't finish it. Everything we had was on point. The service is great as well. Each server was so polite, attentive just the right amount, and very professional. The drinks are very strong which makes the price worth it. We are very pleased with our entire meal. We took a carrot cake slice to go as we were so full after our dinner."}
{"text":"For those of you that know me and follow me you all know that I am on a quest to find the best Steakhouses in Las Vegas, and I keep a list of those I think that are amazing to the worst.  I have to say that Bavette's is now #1 on my list of favorites.  I think that when you arrive at a restaurant making a family feel welcomed and special is important and when I found out that Brian was kept from the old Steakhouse called Brand I knew that my dining experience was going to get good.  Our server was AJ and he explained the whole menu with passion and flair which we all appreciated.   Let's get to the actual meal, in a single word Wow!! Bavette's is a must try and amazing experience.  I didn't realize that in Chicago there was an actual waiting list of a couple of months to get in, and now Las Vegas has this location along with the hidden bar.  You have to order the Bone in Ribeye and add the bone marrow on the side.  The flavor of the meat is very unique and the little char flavor is so good and flavorful.  I always order a medium temperature and it was perfect.  The sides for us were corn, mac and cheese along with mash potatoes.  I hope this helps and look forward to any feedback."}
{"text":"Dress: lounge wear dressy Ambience : vibey jazzy music background  I have the champagne smash which is the mixture of Dry gin ,prosseco and mint lemon and lime cost me about 17.50 ...Denis was my server !!!!....I'm not a Mac and cheese person but oh my GOD!!! As I'm writing this this moist and creamy real cheese !!!! Awesome chill place !!!"}
{"text":"Really liked the place. Went there late last night, arrived around 10:30, half an hour before they closed but did not feel rushed at all, did not end up leaving until midnight. Our server James, I think, was really great. Enthusiastic and happy explain anything about the food or drinks.   Both the filet and the spiced chicken were very good. The truffle mac and cheese was solid, but the cheese was crisped a bit too much in top.  I would go back, it's good to see the machines going on at Monte Carlo."}
{"text":"Just opened... get here soon, before it becomes the hot rage in LV!  Recommended by a work colleague, who said, \"This will be the finest steak you have ever eaten.\"  I doubted that, and said let's give it a go!   Well - he was RIGHT! It was the best...   We had the ribeye, pepper encrusted with a side of bone marrow, mushrooms and sweet potatoes, and I will report that each side dish was equally excellent as well.  The service staff was friendly and helpful, the ambiance was like a old library with an updated hip and trendy flair, old school and new blended seamlessly.  I will definitely return and tell all my friends.  One small downside- turn up the lights just a little... it was too dark inside the restaurant.  The place is hard to find too because the casino is under construction, but don't let that deter you."}
{"text":"Our New Favorite Steakhouse in Las Vegas!  Once you walk In the doors the noise of the casino disappears as the dimmed lights sets the ambiance of the old vegas, mobster, Chicago type decor steakhouse. The tables were booked as it was a Friday night so we sat at the bar. The service was excellent. We were greeted immediately and the menu was explained along with a few suggestions. The fillet was perfectly cooked and the most tender we have ever had. The entire meal was superb and the drinks were were not weak. We don't go to the strip often, but we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"BEST STEAKHOUSE on the strip. My new favorite steakhouse!! Warm greeting from the door, the ladies in front walked us through a beautifully dimmed room to our table.  Our server ROB was spot on and amazing, he was knowledgeable and gave friendly, professional but not stuffy service. His assistant RADO was on point! Never once had to ask for anything. CRISTA the somm came over to say hello and was just as friendly.  Even the manager came to see how we were doing as well! She was super sweet!     Now about the food, how did vegas not have this tasty food sooner!! The food isn't something that hasn't been done before, it's just done so much better! Oysters-super fresh and clean. Wedge salad- probably the best I ever had, the dressing is delicious as well as the maple pepper bacon they topped it off with. Crab cake- just get it!! So much crab meat it's unreal! Bone marrow- holy mother cow! Soooo good! Comes with onion jam and sourdough toast. Traditional filet- melted in my mouth! Super tender. 42 DAY DRY AGED BONE IN RIBEYE- are u kidding me! Cut through like butter and packed with flavor! Stroganoff- creamy, flavorful pasta topped with tender pieces of braised short rib! Mac n cheese- super cheesy and good amount of layered flavors. Brussel sprouts- def a must have, slightly sweet and tangy! Choc cream pie-so velvety and chocolaty.     The whole experience is something I'll remember, the food and service is something I'll come back for again."}
{"text":"This place has great food. Seriously, great. The cocktails we had were delicious, the restaurant had a nice ambience and the bus staff and maître de were excellent. However, I booked in advance making it clear it was our wedding dinner - they placed us in a table immediately behind the servers station so constant foot traffic and glasses congregating half a foot a way from where we were sat. Also, our server was rude to the bus staff, and would constantly address my husband when I asked for something (drinks menu, check, etc). It's 2018. So while there were lots of great things about the place, there were quite a few disappointments too."}
{"text":"I had dinner here on a Sunday and had a great experience. Stepping into Bavette's from the casino it feels like a different world, completely isolated from the sounds and lights of the casino floor. Bavette's has a classic feel to it, a dark room, nothing avant garde or fusion with the food, drinks served in gimlets... Our server, Brian was prompt and attentive and made sure to explain how Bavettes was different than other steak houses and gave us advice on our orders.  Bavette's is about food that is big enough to share, and they don't mind if you do. Regular salads could feed 4, so Brian suggested we do a half order (1/2 price) which was the perfect amount for my wife and I.   I appreciated that there was no issues when I had to push back my reservation. There are a lot of steakhouses in Vegas, this is one that offers a bit of a break from the noise and hustle."}
{"text":"Unexpectedly decided to see if we could get a table at 5:30 this past Monday without a reservation and to our surprise we were seated almost immediately.  Wow ~ so romantic!  Love the chilled out vibe in a very dim lighted atmosphere where you feel completely private.  Amazed we able to carry on conversation & actually hear ourselves talk as if no one else were around.  I wasn't impressed with the music though ~ it was too old school...not a deal breaker for me but would've enjoyed R&B smooth jazz to make this the ultimate experience.  5 Stars for the food across the board ~ no write up will do justice really ~ you must try for yourself!    We ordered way too much as every dish is huge even the bread basket.  Started with half salad orders: mixed green & apple and the smoked salmon caesar both out of this world!  I'm craving these salads as I'm writing this review and I'm not a fan of salmon at all!!  Moved on to share the double bone pork chop & the roasted chicken with sides of mashed potatoes & the wild mushrooms ~ simply heaven!!!    We were so impressed...made reservations for tomorrow since they were already booked completely for Valentine's Day."}
{"text":"My experience here started with a nice greeting by the hostess and gentleman who turned out to be my server. I got there right after they opened at 5:00 (I thought they opened at 4:00pm - wrong) so the restaurant was empty. I knew I wanted a ribeye - just the small 10oz tonight since I still had 3 more nights at the hotel and ample time to sample more of their menu. My server offered me a half of a Caesar salad which sounded good since it's so hot outside. The salad was delicious but then the ribeye arrived cooked (seemed a little small but what the heck) a perfect cook to medium rare on the first bite and OHMYGOD - the flavor - whew, so good, then tender, then marbling, then flavor, flavor and more flavor, texture, juiciness. i couldn't wait to finish chewing this and cut another bite to savor and enjoy. I passed on dessert and went to the french Restaurant, Primrose, next door (in the Park MGM) to sample their country home, garden-inspired setting and menu. I was once again, blown away. You have to try these restaurants to experience what I mean.  nJoy !"}
{"text":"This was the best meal of my life. Am I exaggerating? I don't think so. Everything my party of 8 ordered was second to none. The appetizers, although pricey, were perfection. Shrimp cocktail and the steak tartare were perfect for sharing and a great start to the meal. Then got the wedge salad. It was the largest wedge salad I have ever had. I think it's meant to share between 3-4 people. So I shared with a buddy and still didn't finish. It was delicious. With the pork belly(bacon) on top being the real star. For the main I went Big and got the 22oz bone in ribeye. It was the best steak I have ever had. And my top 5 steak list is no slouch. Lots of heavy hitters. And this steak is now on the top. Yes you pay 85 for it, but hey, it's a special occasion. Go for it. The sides we got was Mac n cheese, best I ever had? Yes. Mashed potatoes also ridiculous, not sure how they did it. Fries, didn't eat, thick cut bacon, had on salad, but people said it was the best thing they have ever had. It was amazing I can concur.  Can't recommend this place enough. Phenomenal service. Norman is the man!!!"}
{"text":"The vibe was awesome. We ordered the spiced fried chicken and short rib stroganoff pasta, both were delicious. The drinks are also incredible. Would recommend the Lillet Rose Martini and Bavette's punch."}
{"text":"Awsome food and service! Diana was our waitress! Wow what can I say! So would go there again when we are in town!"}
{"text":"An important thing in great food at a steakhouse is the experience....Chef Jon & our server Bree were amazing....I had a birthday celebration & they  placed us in the vip speak easy room....beautiful ambiance & I will now make it an annual thing event"}
{"text":"Amazing! Went April 12, 2018 to celebrate our anniversary. Such a cool Chicago speakeasy style decor with dark lighting (our eyes adjusted within a few minutes). So romantic. Our server Kristy was friendly and started us off with complimentary champagne. Appetizer was baked goat cheese... delish!! We shared the Chicago cut ribeye ... cooked with a perfect char to medium rare perfection. Comes with a special season salt on side which you can add... steak is fabulous. Sides were truffle mac and cheese... best ever and pomme fritte with garlic aioli... very crispy and good. We felt this is one of the best steakhouse meals we've had in Las Vegas since moving here 14 years ago. Yes it is pricey but not any more than the other steak places on the Strip, plus for a special occasion it is worth it. Wife had lemon drop martini and I had two different old fashions ... all were superb. We will be back and highly recommend this restaurant due to their superb service and amazing food."}
{"text":"Fantastic oysters, filet, lamb, and Cobb salad. We had a delicious anniversary dinner that couldn't have been replicated anywhere else. Bavette's offers a very 1930's speakeasy ambiance, outstanding service, cocktails and food. What else could you want?"}
{"text":"We randomly went it to Babette's after a Golden Knights game. The atmosphere was great. The food was amazing and just right. We had shrimp cocktail, mushrooms and the dry aged rib eye. The service was top notch! Everyone was friendly and super attentive to all of our needs. Highly recommend for a nice quiet dinner or lounge with company."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great. We ordered the spiced fried chicken and short rib stroganoff pasta, both were delicious. The drinks are also incredible. Would recommend the Lillet Rose Martini and Bavette's punch."}
{"text":"Went here for a birthday dinner -best service received ever. The waitress was so kind and so helpful. The food was spectacular -absolutely recommend the salmon (it was AMAZING). Will most definitely be dining here again in the future !!"}
{"text":"Unexpectedly ended up having dinner here on their first night open. Everything was as you would expect from a finely tuned steakhouse, but with an atmosphere that is second to none. Honestly, it would be impossible for photos to do this place justice. I snapped a few on my phone and then realized that without sending a blinding flash across the entire dining room I wasn't going to get a photo I loved. *puts phone away for the rest of the meal* This is, without a doubt, the best kept secret in Las Vegas so run (don't walk) and experience this gem before word gets out.  Music, lighting, service, food - all simply delicious. I might be easily impressed, but the charred tomato and perfectly dressed watercress salad that (unexpectedly) came with my filet took things over the top.   idk...just go!"}
{"text":"What a great meal! Food is kinda like The old brand restaurant that was in the same area now they added two bars, walk all the way to the rear exit through the restaurant past the first bar in the dining area and then turn left just past the exit. Password is \"open Seasame lol we ate Dinner at the bar and next time we are going to get a booth as we had no idea what great food they serve thinking we where getting a bar menu, nope full menu is served at the bar, yes the whole menu!. Awesome, fun place. The bartenders are some of the best in Vegas, serious mixology, very attentive."}
{"text":"Ok, so it was dimly lit but that's obviously the idea.   We enjoyed the atmosphere. We had a reservation. The ladies up front were very pleasant.  We were quickly seated.  Our server was pleasant as well.  Our food was served very quickly and cooked perfectly.  I had the Classic Ribeye and my wife had the petit filet.  They were both very good pieces of meat and both cooked perfectly.  They do cook with a char but it was still cooked perfectly.  The corn side was really really good as well. Very good side for the steak.  A little spice to it.  Overall our experience and food was much better than a couple more known steakhouses near.   Great job."}
{"text":"If steak is your thing, Bavette's should be on your radar when you're in Vegas.  It's a great steakhouse in a city of great steakhouses.  This one has distinctive traditional steakhouse decor, very dark, lots of leather and wood.  It could be 1950, it could be 2018 when you're at Bavette's.  The service is attentive.  Menu is very standard steakhouse fare.  I started with the champagne smash, which was delicious but too sweet for my palate.  I added some club soda to cut the sweetness and liked it much better.  This is probably just me.  I was expecting champagne level sweet and this one is full-on sweet drink level sweet.  I normally just give the bread basket the stink eye if one is delivered to my table, but I couldn't pass it up when they brought out one filled with aromatic, perfect sourdough bread.  Crunchy crust and soft center with the ideal sourdough tang.  Carbs, you complete me.  My dining companion had the wedge salad, and I had the bacon roasted tomato salad. They have a half salad option, which I ordered and still had leftovers. Both of our salads had the BEST bacon ever.  Smoky, salty, sweet.  A holy trinity of bacon. The hat trick of pork.  We both had filets for dinner.  Mine was ordered Pittsburg rare, and for a place known for its char, I was disappointed in the low level of char on mine.  My husband had a baked potato, which is actually two potatoes, and came with more of that bacon of the gods.  I had a baked sweet potato, which was gigantic. You can definitely share salads and sides here if you're so inclined.  We ended up with quite a lot of leftover food that we took back to our hotel to enjoy the next day.  Plan to swing by your room afterward with a bag of leftovers if you have kitchen facilities where you're staying.  I can't say that this was my best steak experience in Vegas, but I can't say it wasn't, either.  There are so many different feels to the steakhouses around town, and Bavette's brings a unique experience to Vegas.  I'm sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"Fantastic steakhouse and experience.  We had a party of 6 on a guys trip to Vegas, and when we walked into the Monte Carlo earlier in the day we began doubting whether we wanted to eat at Bavette's.  Thankfully we kept our reservation.  When you walk into the door out of the old green Monte Carlo carpet, you literally go back to the 1920's in Chicago.  Unbelievable how awesome the ambience is.  Food was great, drinks even better, and all the sides perfect.  I would not hesitate recommending this place."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant - love the old vibe build-out! Service is over the top, and the food was really, really good. Hubby tried the Spicy Fried Chicken with whipped potatoes and gravy. They put peas in the potatoes, which was a nice touch. The potatoes were so light they melted in our mouth! I had the Crab Cake, which is 7 oz. It's light and flaky, with a delicate balance on the seasoning. And.... they make the best manhattans! We are so coming back - more to try on the menu!!"}
{"text":"We stumbled in this amazing dining establishment. Angels sang as we walk through the Pearly Gates of this incredible restaurant. in particular Ngoc and Gustavo were amazing and helpful with food and libations.  IF you are within 100 miles form Las Vegas, STOP HERE,  you will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"Such an awesome addition to an updated casino. Randall, our waiter, was the best!  Recommend oysters, salads, and all else. Lemon meringue was superb. We will be back to try the ribeye; looks awesome. Overall, service was outstanding."}
{"text":"Tried this place before a show the atmosphere was super cool the staff was great and the food was amazing the Truffle Mac and cheese was the bomb and you can add some  bone marrow to your steak to kick it up a notch"}
{"text":"Oh. My. Goodness. This place is awesome. Ig anyone has been paying attention, Park MGM is the new place to be and Bavettes is no exception. From the minute you walk thrift the thick heavy doors you are transported to a different time. There's no murmur of casino life outside the door. You are completely emerged in Bavette's vintage ambiance. I absolutely love the red velvet couches! We sat down for dinner and the beginning to end the service was impeccable. We started off with the duck and goat cheese terrine. To be honest I had no real idea what terrine was, but anything with goat cheese can't be bad right? My first bite of jyst duck was a little much and I was worried I might have chosen wrong.... However once I spread it over the toast with the goat cheese and apricot mustard... Oh my...delicious! I couldnt get enough!  I couldn't decide between salad and appetizer so of course I had to get both. I  especially when i learned you could hey 1/2 portion salad. I ordered the wedge (sans bacon of course) and it was perfect. For dinner I ordered the ribeye. I love that they char everything. Although I recommend requesting no or light char for those that don't prefer it as the steaks seem to be on the dark side... I actually prefer the char as long as the inside is a nice bloody med rare. Perfection. Lastly the truffle mac and cheese is epic. I can't rave about this place enough. The only complaint is that you'll never have enough room for dessert!"}
{"text":"FANTASTIC place with a very classy and upscale vibe. Loved the ambiance including the music. Our server Carlos was first class and we always highly recommend clients and friends to pay this place a visit. Well worth it!"}
{"text":"The food, the service, the ambiance was absolutely amazing. ..this is by far my absolute favorite restaurant in town....I went for a birthday dinner and the bone marrow, the chicken, the steak,  the salads the drinks,  the desserts, and more is to die for. ..nothing beats this place by far. ..thank you for outstanding service and the love in preparing the food.  Definitely top of the list."}
{"text":"Bavette not only delivers on the main product (quality steak) but also on service and a relaxed atmosphere - the total customer experience.   Las Vegas has a tradition for quality steakhouses, and this has risen to be a top contender. We started with sharing the wedge and asked that it be chopped so all could share. The larger bacon bits and just the right amount of dressing complimented each other well. The steak is a 16 oz. New York, prime 42-day dry aging is perfectly cooked, and the taste and texture are wonderful (we asked to share this which was perfect for my wife and me). The variety and quality of the side dishes are incredible. The sides are definitely big enough for family style sharing.  And if you like dessert, the carrot cake, and sundae area great way to end a meal.   Las Vegas attracts another great export from Chicago!"}
{"text":"Came here after the Frankie Vallie concert and unfortunately we had a bad experience.  Upon entering the restraunt you'll notice how dark it is so be ready for that when it comes to reading the menu.  After our table passed the little lamp around so we could see, we decided on the salmon and 2 plates of lamb chops.   We received our wine and a then were told that the restraunt was out of salmon. So we ordered the chicken dish, because it's chicken and who doesn't have chicken?!  Well, here comes the manager to let is know that they were now out of chicken.  Upon learning that I'd had enough.  Let him know that we were not going to be dining here as it sounds like nothing was available on the menu.  The manager apologized and them asked if we'd like a to Go cup......for our wine!!???!!  Mind you this was Saturday night, around 10 pm on a holiday weekend.   Too bad, the reviews all looked promising.      P.s..  if you tap the bottom of the lamp it gets brighter!!"}
{"text":"Went back here and again the food was amazing! We sat at the bar and had Gustavo as our bartender he was funny and helpful and the drinks were great!!! Luis was nice and helpful.... definitely would suggest this place if your looking for a nice night out with great food and wonderful ambience."}
{"text":"Just go. You won't regret it. Best food, service and ambiance experience  you will ever have. Located in the Monte Carlo in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Very good meal.  A little dark but the food and the service were exceptional.  The brusel sprouts were a great side and the salads can be split which was a good tip from the waitress."}
{"text":"This dinner was by far one of the best we've ever had. Our waiter AJ was so nice and friendly and accommodating. As I journey through sober life, I still miss having fancy drinks...AJ had the bartender make me a special mocktail...the Brussel sprouts were delicious! The crab cake tasted like they picked a crab out of the ocean 5 minutes prior. The ambience was great. It was just awesome. Great experience. Thanks MGM Resorts, Park MGM and Bavette's Steakhouse & Bar"}
{"text":"Best New Steak & Seafood Restaurant on the Strip. Can't say enough good things about the Food, Ambiance & overall Dining Experience.Walking into this new Venue In the New Park MGM you will be totally Shocked at this Place & How Nice it Is. Ask For Gaga as Your Waitress Not Lady she is Terrific."}
{"text":"Amazing dry-aged meats paired with an exceptional wine list and attentive service. I've had a couple of the seafood tower apps but you need to get the steak tartare which is some of the best I have ever had."}
{"text":"Highly recommend. Best mint juleps I've ever had and honestly you have to get one at a place like this. Fried chicken was to die for. I still think about it. The food here is super rich and the portions are huge! The vibe is lovely, jazz music, very prohibition-esque. Great for a low key night out with friends in Vegas."}
{"text":". The Bone Marrow, Chicago cut steak, Brussel Sprouts and Sweet Potatoes were all delicious. Highly recommendable on food and service. We were staying at the Park MGM and decided to take the trip to Bavette's, and boy were all 4 of us happy we did. The price is what you would expect from a high end steak house. All of the servers were very polite and attentive. We all loved the atmosphere once you entered, to where you are sat with its current roaring 20's aesthetic decor."}
{"text":"This is the definition, the standard of what a 5 start restaurant should be like. The customer service is second to none, John & staff was amazing. The food was from another world, I ordered a dry aged ribeye and wow I could not stop eating. nice, juicy, tender, and well seasoned. A small confusing on a bone marrow as I ordered it but John never placed it..probably my fault as I was extremely indecisive if I wanted it or not plus I didn't bring it up, so def not johns fault. But the price is definitely worth it. If you are looking for great food and great customer service, check this restaurant out!"}
{"text":"Excited to go to the new bavette at the Montecarlo, we were 8 people with reservation at 8:15pm. We stop at the bar and been seated promply. Decor is oitstanding and very simple menu , nothing really exciting. They made the effort to make a vegetariam menu who is pretty nice. Not to full either but at least they try. Thank you a couple Vegan option will be nice 2.  Ordered a salad with roasted tomato, it was good but the ingrediens dod not really match. Got the pasta  and a side a mushroom. I was not the host and did not say anything about the wait between the order and . Bit the service was realy bad. No manager figure out everybodybwas waiting for the food more than 45 minutes. Nobody ever touch the table except the sommelier who went out of his way and  gave us an outstanding service with great advices and was always there to refill the glasses. The waitress was good but she should check the timing on the table. When you wait for your food for so long, you get a little irritated , and when the runner come with the food ask who as what? And got confuse, I have to ask him if there is not seat number in the front of the ticket? Gave me an attitude and when back to chexk the set number. Overhall the food was good but the service need to be work on."}
{"text":"Bavette is now where the \"Brand\" steakhouse used to be and I'm now I'm a fan..  Service: Our main server and his assistant were on point throughout the whole evening.  They kept the table clear, drinks fresh and the vibe positive through the night for our party of 6.  It's definitely the great service you'd expect from a high end steakhouse. Good times  Steak & then some: I went with the 16 oz Classic Ribeye Chicago Cut, cooked medium.  The ribeye was charred a little too much for my liking.  This created a dark crust that might have taken away from the flavor as it was a little more bland then expected.  Was the Ribeye better than average?  Absolutely, but in their High End Steakhouse League, the competition is so tough in Las Vegas. The BFF loved her 6 oz Petite Duchess Cut Filet.  She ordered it medium and mentioned it was flavorful and cooked perfectly.  I'm on their traditional filet on the next visit. The buttery mashed potatoes is their perfect match with the steaks, I loved tasting the garlic with the butter.  The herbs and thyme worked well with the mushrooms.  The Charred Broccoli made me feel healthy af, and I have no issues with the broccoli being charred.  The Truffle Mac & Cheese did not make me feel healthy af, but it was all worth it as it was excellent.   For dessert, the Mango sorbet was lovely.  Thicker in texture for a sorbet which I'm ok with it because it was packed with Mango flavor.  Definitely ordering again.  Their Vesper martini (Titos vodka, Bombay gin, lillet) got me feeling buzzed and like 007.  Ambiance:  Dark af with smart mood lighting at the table and I LOVE it.  Our main server came out in a tuxedo and everyone is dressed to the nines in predominantly black and white formal wear.  The center bar is beautiful and I loved the Dark Wood Chicago steakhouse feel.  This might currently be the most attractive steakhouse on the Strip.  I'm glad Bavette's is here and they're definitely another steakhouse to consider when it's $$$$ steak night out for you in Vegas.  They are definitely on my list.  Enjoy! =)"}
{"text":"Great spot in the new MGM park... good way over priced for Monte Carlo.... but service good and ambiance great... the best restaurant at park MGM..."}
{"text":"This is a hidden Gem! We finally found a perfect steakhouse in Vegas! Everything is perfect fr the reservations, reception , to the waiters- are superb! And very friendly. They made us feel very special! We ordered the aged bone in rib eye steak and the bone marrow! Which was the best. The cocktail drink was refreshing! The chocolate cream pie was delicious as well. The old chicago feel is in the air, with the matching blues and jazz music. Velvet sofas are very comfortable. The whole ambiance is perfect for celebrating special occasions!! And a date night too!"}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant before a hockey game because we needed something close to the venue. We were pleasantly surprised! We sat at the bar and ate because the restaurant was packed. Everything we order was delicious! We will definitely be going back very soon!!"}
{"text":"I dined here before we went to a show at the Park Theater, which was like a 2 minute walk from the restaurant. I love the ambiance of the restaurant.  It has an old school feel, dimmed lighting,  like I'm on the set of Mad Men. The service and food were amazing.  My husband and I ordered Hibiki Tokyo old fashion, Mint Julip  Crab cake- this is a must! One of the best crab cakes I've had!  16 oz bone in filet- cooked to perfection.  Truffle Mac and cheese- i highly recommend this Creamed spinach- this was good but a little too salty for my taste. Overall we had an amazing dining experience and would definitely return when in Vegas!"}
{"text":"This is a really good steakhouse in Las Vegas. It's located in Monte Carlo hotel. We were staying there and we wanted to dress up and enjoy a nice dinner. Wow! Everything was so good, from the Cesar salad to the duck appetizer. We also order the filet mignon with a couple of side orders. Best filet I've ever had! I would suggest to do a family style and order some protein with a coup of sides. It's plenty to share. I was with a group of 6 and we each ordered our own and we had so much left overs. I was sad though because I wanted the lamp chops and they ran out of it by the time we ordered. So I would try the lamb chops the next time we go."}
{"text":"Wow!   What a discovery in the Monte Carlo.  This place sets a new standard in fine dinning.  Beyond great food, the Bourbon selections are amazing.  This steakhouse sets a beautiful standard among it's peers in Vegas.  The customer service piece is amazing.  They all encourage questions and know the detail behind the drinks and food. A must on your list is the back bar.  A completely different gone and it complements the restaurant in a unique way.  You got to love the music.  This place is a great escape and I look toward to making this a must stop in my trips to Vegas.  Bottom line:  Great people loving customer service and shinning through.  A must try.... Crab cakes,  bone in Filet."}
{"text":"Amidst all the Steakhouses in Vegas we Chose Bavette's tonight for Dinner and We were so Pleasantly Surprised! This is Our New Favorite in Vegas!  AMBIANCE:  Very cozy and tucked away Chicago feel steakhouse, nicely dimmed lighting. Warm wood/red velvet colors, nice for a romantic date. Many booths which over a private setting for you and your guests which is pleasant.  SERVICE: Trully some of the Best in Vegas! Our waitress Dragana and the support staff were superbly trained and gave such nice informative recommendations that really added to our dining experience! From Start to finish every single member of staff was so Warm, Friendly and Pleasant.  FOOD: Wow! Enjoyed Maine Lobster as a starter and the presentation was so uniquely served Platter style which several sauce options, very ncie! Dry aged Ribeye Oscar style was so nicely charred and flavored, the seasoning served with the steak was simple but so flavorful! Oh and the Sides of Sweet Potato was so richly carmelized and Mac & Cheese was very Rich in flavors! A must try on BOTH of these sides! BEST Meal so far in Vegas!  DRINKS: Tried a few drinks, Very Happy with the velvety smooth Tokyo Old Fashion One of the Best i've ever had! The girls Loved their Lillet Rose Martini."}
{"text":"Bavette's is wonderful! The staff is very friendly and  the vibe of the steak house is not at all pretentious. Our waiter Brian was helpful and funny!   We ordered the bone marrow, truffle Mac n cheese, elote corn, and the bone in rib eye. It was more than enough for the two of us to share and we had food left to take home. My personal favorite part of the meal was the bone marrow. Not only was it a generous serving, but there was a lot of marrow on the bone itself and they still give you their sourdough toasted on the side along with a raspberry onion jam! The ribeye was delicious as well! We got it cooked medium, if you are more daring than us you can get it the recommended medium rare. It comes with a side of bernaise but it did not need it at all.   Husband got the hibiki old fashioned and he said it was the best old fashioned he's ever had and I had the bavettes punch and that was delicious as well. It didn't hit you with a strong alcohol taste.   We are customers for life. We will definitely come back on our future trips to Vegas."}
{"text":"Loved this place!! Great ambiance, service was very attentive, food was delicious and cocktails exquisite. Nice wine list, they have a cool thing they do, they will allow you to bring a bottle of wine if your own and will wave the corkage fee if $50 if you share a glass with someone else in the restaurant. Also have a cool little speakeasy bar in the back private room as well as big one in the middle of this intimate dining room."}
{"text":"The wife and I had dinner before the show the other night. The restaurant was busy but the food was worth the wait. I had the Prime beef sandwich, the meat was cooked to perfection. My wife had the smoked salmon Caesar and loved it. Great new restaurant and we will be back again!"}
{"text":"Navigating the restaurant scene in Vegas is daunting. Bavette's is a welcome addition from Chicago to the Vegas strip. And, with all the hipster-centrism to most of the dining establishments, it was nice to experience first class authentic service from beginning to end along with high quality.  Babette's has a classic dining feel with mini Tiffany lamps and big leather booths, low lighting and you can actually hear what you're saying to your date. The service is top notch period. You never have to look for your server, and they were extremely accommodating to my food allergies. There are contemporary updates in flavoring to classic dishes. They offer a great wine selection and immediately serve a warm and freshly baked sour dough bread. I had a large seared Salmon with a truffle Mac and Cheese. My Husband had a large and well seasoned prime rib with steak frites that we're fresh and crunchy. We had the carrot cake for dessert which was a very large slice. Babette's is a great refuge from all the noise and clutter. We'd definitely return."}
{"text":"We went to Babette's Steakhouse on Thanksgiving. The interior lighting is dark. I guess they are trying to create ambiance. We asked for another little lamp so that we could see and noted that another table also had two lamps. We were told we couldn't because people were going to be seated next to us--they never showed. My husband and I have  visual handicaps. Do not go here if you have visual issues as they will not accommodate a visual handicap! The food and service were good. My only complaint on the food was that I ordered a salad that called for apples. I didn't have any apples in the salad.  It's a pricey restaurant.  This is not the place for you if you're on a budget."}
{"text":"Our waitress called us unicorns because we were locals who dont work on the strip. After driving by a billboard ad for this restaurant inside the monte carlo hotel and casino, we decided to give it a try for Valentines Day. For the two of us, we ordered a Hibiki Tokyo old fashioned, a Lillet rose martini, baked crab cake, truffle macaroni cheese, classic chicago cut rib-eye, traditional filet mignon, and extra sour dough bread. This ended up being plenty of oh-so-amazing food. We left extremely full and satisfied. The bill ended up being around $200.00"}
{"text":"We had a 5-star experience at Bavette's on our last trip to Vegas. From the ambiance to the food and service, this restaurant is worth a perfect rating in every way.   The setting is dark, expansive but intimate, and very romantic. The location was a little hard to find at first though, as the Monte Carlo Casino was being renovated and the normal entrances were blocked. We had to walk around the side of the building through a construction zone to get inside. But once we got there, it was worth it. The space feels as though you have taken a step back in time with beautiful circular booths, Tiffany lamps, and dark wood accents. An \"old Vegas\" vibe that we were looking for... very cool!  The food was delicious and we ordered a lot of it - crabcakes, mac and cheese, and a New York Strip that my boyfriend enjoyed. Our drinks were carefully-crafted and boozy. Well worth the price.  Finally, the service was excellent. Our server was a true professional and incredibly knowledgable as well as friendly and welcoming. We got a level of service that is pretty rare nowadays, even at more high end restaurants. He really ensured we had a nice experience and we appreciated that.  If you're looking for a high end date night place, don't hesitate to try this spot. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I ate here the other night for a work event. The side dishes are absolutely amazing. I had the truffle mac n cheese, potatoes (mashed), candy bacon.. must haves!! I ordered their 10oz filet mignon. The ambiance of the restaurant is very unique, dark and cozy. I would recommend having the flashlight app on your phone to read the menu. The reason why I am giving it 4 stars out of 5 is that my steak was really burnt, to the point of inedible. I felt really bad, so I didnt ask them to recook it or anything like that  i just cant do it!! Lol!"}
{"text":"I was skeptical in coming here since it was the only restaurant available to go to at the Monte Carlo but I was truly impressed. We celebrated our 5 year anniversary here before the Bruno Mars concert.   We literally ate almost everything.   As an appetizer, we had the garlic shrimp and it was one of the best SHRIMP I've had in awhile. the buttery garlic was to die for.   Entrees: I had the petite filet with added mushrooms and bone marrow. The bone marrow was amazing and a must have. The petite filet was cooked perfectly and was easy to cut. only thing is that i wish it had a little bit more flavor to it, if i didn't add the mushroom, it would have been super plain to me. It also came with a teenie tiny salad and a roasted tomato. My husband had the pork chops and he loved it. Again, he said one of the best pork chops he's ever eaten and he loved the mushrooms that it came with. This guy barely ever eats mushrooms, so the fact that he had it, it was really good then. We shared the mashed potatoe side along with the corn elote. MUST ORDER THE CORN ELOTE! it was SOOOO good!   Dessert: Mango sorbet, yummy again! plus had the French Press coffee and it got me up for the night to get ready for the concert ;).   Highly recommend coming here. Ask for Brian, hes pretty awesome and funny too."}
{"text":"Excellent!  Had the steak tartare to start.  Ribeye and brussell sprouts for meal.  Absolutely excellent service, food, and atmosphere.  My new fav steakhouse in Vegas.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"4.5/5. Awesome steakhouse. It has a very subtle entrance. The decor is something out of the 1920s or a set from the movie midnight in Paris. Really cool decor and extremely dim lighting. I find it a little pricey however for the steak even for Vegas standards. I haven't been to the Chicago location but when you compare the menus the Vegas location is slightly more money. I had the dry aged bone in New York and truffle Mac. The steak genuinely tastes dry aged. I've been to a lot of restaurants where they say it's dry aged and convinced it's not. Overall great spot, I'll be back."}
{"text":"Crab cakes were EVERYTHING!!! Not full of breading like most. All crab and sautéed to perfection. All the sides were amazing. Brussels were the best I've ever had (and I love Brussels).  Shared the bone in filet with my husband. Worth every penny!!!"}
{"text":"I was super duper excited to try this place given the stellar reviews! The service was nice and attentive.  The atmosphere was classy and dim lit.   However, we order a bone-in rib eye that was rare, and in the dark setting, the color looked off and it did not taste right.  We looked at it closely under a light, and it was more a medium and an off color.  When we inquired with our waiter whether this was how a rare should be, he didn't say much but had it re-done which didn't really address our question.  The bone marrow was nice, fatty, and rich.  A little bit overwhelming with both bone marrow and steak.  The brussel sprouts were delicious and a nice side dish though! A little crisp with some cheese sprinkled on top.  Overall, I was really wanting to like this place, but unfortunately was not satisfied with the steak.  Furthermore, it was served on a pretty cold plate, so the steak did not keep warm for long."}
{"text":"A transformation is taking place at the Monte Carlo and there's a lot to be excited about and it starts right here. The staff, the service, and most importantly the food is top notch. Stick your head in the door and you'll see."}
{"text":"Great food and service! Ambiance was a real treat. Although, pair the dark room with the heavy foods and its straight to bed after dinner for you. (Even if you do eat your vegetables.)  We shared the Lyonnaise Salad for started. One of the best we've had. The thick-cut bacon paired with the egg was delish.   Entree, my wife got the burger, which was very flavorful. Plenty of bacon. Somehow the bun was vegan according to our server, John who was from Australia. I say somehow b/c it was excellent. I had the 42-day dry aged bone in New York Strip steak. Very good. Our sides were the recommended Brussels Sprouts (some of the best I've had) and truffle Mac n cheese - also great.  I'm just waking up from my food coma now. We'll go back for sure. (And try to save room for dessert next time)"}
{"text":"The staff is top notch and very helpful. Attractive place but very dark.  Bring a flashlight if you want to ready the menu.  Food is good but not great. There are many other steakhouses in walking distance that will Wow you.  This one won't"}
{"text":"I dined at Bavette's steakhouse in Chicago 5 years ago. I was very excited when I found that they opened one in Monte Carlo resort. It happened that we were staying at the resort this time so I made sure to make a dinner reservation.   The entrance is hidden among all these slot machines. Once you stepped inside the steakhouse, you cannot hear any noises from the casino. Just FYI, it's dark inside.   We were seated right away and our server (forgot his name) greeted us right away. He made some recommendations on the menu. We took his recommendation and ordered crab cakes! They were one of the best crab cakes I have ever had and we were so glad that we ordered it.   We ordered elote style corn, which was really good as well.   For entree, we ordered filet mignon and classic ribeye. The portions for both steaks were just right and the steaks were tender.   Highly recommend this steakhouse! Great food, great service. Will come back for my next Vegas trip."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! We went in celebrating a family anniversary, party of 4. We were greeted by the hostess and a host and promptly seated per reservations.  Mood was very romantic and peaceful. We ordered our drinks first and along with them came some surprise champagne to add to our celebration. So nice, tasty too! Our waitress made several suggestions on food and explained many dishes in detail, as far as size and flavors.  Extremely helpful. We had an assistant waiter who kept our waters full, and removed our plates as we emptied them. All the help was \"spot on\". The filets melt in your mouth! The truffled mac n cheese was heavenly, the brussel sprouts were something to talk about (fabulous), Bread was the best, crusty outside and perfect inside. We had the mixed green salad with apples, so tasty, the crab stuffed avocado which was superb! I can't forget the crab cake for our appetizer, best ever. There was nothing bad or wrong at all, exactly the opposite. On top of all that they gave a Military Discount and thanked my husband for his service! It is located inside of the Monte Carlo Casino and we all loved it!"}
{"text":"My husband and I dined at Bavettes last night as an early birthday celebration for him and it was hands down the best meal/experience we've had. From the moment we walked in the door until we walked out the service we received was SUPERB. AND our meal was FANTASTICALLY DELICIOUS! We both ordered steak dinners, I had the petite filet mignon, and he had the New York strip, and we shared brussel sprouts. The CHAR on those cuts of meat were by far the best we've had. The steak was OH SO tender and SCRUMPTIOUS and the Brussel sprouts were so good. We both really enjoyed our meals. I hands down recommend this place if you are looking for a great dining experience. Our server Randall took great care of us HE was AMAZING. As for a cocktail You MUST try the Lillet Rose Martini OMG I wish I could get it in a to go cup! THIS PLACE IS DEFINITELY WORTH YOUR MONEY as we've been to other steak/restaurants in Vegas and have not been this satisfied with our meal/service. P.S. I recommend making reservations."}
{"text":"All around excellent!!! Definitely recommended . The food was delicious, great service and good environment."}
{"text":"Hidden gem. Don't be discouraged by the current construction goin on.  The inside looks like a speak easy (a huge one) Its dark and romantic!  ORDER THE MAC AND CHEESE!!!!! pretty delicious.  Not a fan off the Brussels sprouts.    Secret tip: there's a hidden bar in the back if the front is too full."}
{"text":"Had two fantastic meals at Bavette's.  Recommend getting the 1/2 Cesar Salad as the whole portion is HUGE. The salad is served with smoke salmon instead of anchovies and apple chips vs crotons. Outstanding salad. I had the salmon as a entree and it's was cooked to perfection. The sides are huge. The second stuck with a Cesar and had the lamb.   I will be coming back. The service and food was top shelf."}
{"text":"We dined here while staying at the Monte Carlo recently. We were big fans of the Brand steakhouse that was here before. Please note this is a REAL review, because most of these other reviews don't look too real to me!  The atmosphere is upscale, very nice, but EXTREMELY dark. We ordered a crab cake appetizer, a Chicago cut ribeye, a mixed mushroom side and a baked potato side. The crab cake was excellent. The steak was very slightly over cooked, it was pretty good. It was not the best ribeye I've ever had and not the worst. The mushroom side was killer, the potatoes mediocre. The service was 5 star excellent, the food was a 4. It's a pricey place, but these types of places always are.    We are not strangers to high end steak houses or restaurants. This is without a doubt the darkest place we have ever eaten. You couldn't see if you were eating steak or mushrooms! The light at our table was 1 watt. We commented on it, the Maitre'D said everybody says that. If your girlfriend or wife (or husband) is really ugly, I guess it's a good place to go. Everybody looks great in the dark! The steak knives were not serrated and dull. They bring the water out in a fancy bottle, no ice, and they leave the bottle on the table. So, it's warm, probably tap water to drink for your meal. I'm stone deaf, but my GF said the music was particularly annoying. She said it was brassy jazz, and a bit too loud to relax. And...that's kind of ironic, because that's why we went there, to get away from the sounds and bustle of the casino to dine and relax for a bit.     In sum, the food was pricey, but ok. Service was excellent. It is not as good as Brand's was. There are clearly better choices for steak in Las Vegas. Bear in mind I don't drink, and I'm 65 years old, I've eaten in thousands of restaurants in my lifetime! I don't think we would go back there again."}
{"text":"We came in her to grab a small bite after the hockey game. This restaraunt has been open for a few months and had a very old school Vegas feel to it.  It was a nice break after being at the crazy hockey game all evening. When we walked in we were immediately greeted my the pleasant hostess stand and told the bar was open seating. We only came in for maybe dessert depending on their menu.   We sat at the main center bar and were immediately greeted by the bartender Rocco. He was so awesome and inviting. He greeted us with a smile and offered menus and a beverage. My bf ordered an old fashion and the 2nd old fashion ordered, Rocco suggested a Japanese whiskey which was a nice twist to the traditional drink.   My bf was only interested in dessert and ordered the carrot cake and ice cream. They didn't skim on the cake cutting and he ate every single bite. He had a sweet tooth and said that's what he needed. Me being vegan, Rocco offered me the vegetarian menu and there are notations on which items could be ordered vegan. As I wasn't very hungry, I ordered the sweet pot and it was plentiful.   This place has a great atmosphere, a nice break from the hussle of the tourist crowd in the casino. We were happy to stumble into it and plan on returning next time we're near"}
{"text":"We have been here twice now. Both times were amazing. Great service, drinks and food. My favorite drink is the bavettes punch. We always start with the oysters and garlic shrimp dew jonghe. We learned the first time that the serving sizes are big so come hungry and share. We shared the dry aged bone in ribery this time and it is easily my favorite steak ever. The elote style corn and truffle mac and cheese are my favorite. We never finish the sides. They are definitely for about 3 people each. We ended our meal with the chocolate cream pie. All I can say is everything was delicious. They have vegetarian options too so there is something for everyone."}
{"text":"New Steakhouse Alert!   Chicago is a steakhouse capital of the US.  One of its best has made it to Vegas.    Bavette's makes practically every top ten steakhouse list from professional reviewers and publications.  The new Vegas location, in the renovated Monte Carlo Resort and Casino does the original justice.  All the menu favorites are here and they are good.  Standard chilled seafood cocktails and towers.  Pass and look towards the more interesting.  The peppered duck and goat cheese terrine is outstanding.  Slices of the \"loaf\" contains chunky bits of duck and tangy goat cheese in a mixture of chilled duck fat and innards.  Spread it on the charred bread like a country pate.  Good eats.    For salads, the crab stuffed avocado is excellent.  A pile of jumbo lump crab meat, a head of fresh bib lettuce and a classic, tangy, mustardy dijon sherry vinaigrette.  Classic.  Now, the steaks.  All USDA prime.  All well trimmed.  Cooked slightly below temp (better side to err on).  All seasoned with a custom steak salt post cooking.  The non dry aged, 16oz, bone in filet is very good.  Extremely thick cut but perfectly cooked internally.  Uber tender and thanks to the bone, beefier than normal.  It is easily overshadowed by the very good 42 day dry aged, 22oz, bone in ribeye.  Denser, beefier, very good umami finish.  The steak has a good sweetness, nuttiness with just the right bleu cheese funk.    Traditional steakhouse sides.  Solid creamed spinach with just the right amount of melting bleu cheese to punch up the umami finish of any steak.  The truffle mac and cheese (made with truffle bits not synthetic  truffle oil), creamy with a blistered, crisped topping of white cheddar.  Very good.  Again a great way to punch up the umami finish, epically of the aged steaks.  Prices in line with this tier of steakhouse.  Bone in filet, $73; dry aged ribeye $85.  Service is surprisingly good for a new eatery.    Properly made old fashion and martini.  Very good wine program.  Nice selection of brown libations with very fairly priced doubles (it is a Chicago steakhouse after all).  Vegas resort markup.  A true Chicago steakhouse and  a welcome addition to the plethora of top tiered steakhouses in Vegas."}
{"text":"Oh man, I was ecstatic to hear a Bavette's was coming to Las Vegas!  It's a go-to place for me in Chicago - some of the best drinks and steaks you'll ever have.   Located inside the Monte Carlo, Bavette's has a small closed off entrance so you don't need to worry about smoke or gaming (this is a huge plus for me) It has an awesome 1920's, 1930's NY/Art Deco vibe with service and hospitality that are next level!  World class mixologists and chefs - you can't go wrong with anything you order. This will for sure be a new go to spot for me!"}
{"text":"Amazing, amazing, amazing food!!! OMG! The steak, sides and cocktails were out of this world. I had dinner with a group of 6 and the entire experience from the moment we arrived until we left was perfect. The cool Chicago ambiance was so romantic and just set the tone of one of the best dinners ever. I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"We found this little gem on Yelp and it did not disappoint. The service was stellar, the food and drinks were AMAZING. My petite filet was cooked perfectly. I highly recommend the Truffle Mac n' Cheese and the Brussel Sprouts. We look forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"Really nice steakhouse! The ribeye steak is the BEST ever! Crispy surface with juicy steak yummy~"}
{"text":"I didn't want to give this review because I don't want it to be impossible to get into this place one day but good lord it's great. Don't let it being in a crappy hotel fool you. The decor, the service, the food is all top notch. I'm a steakhouse snob and it was one of the best experiences I've ever had. Love this place! Mac and cheese is insanely good! Not too creamy not too dry! Steak was perfect!"}
{"text":"I am obsessed with fine dining in Vegas. My friends & I wanted to check it out being one of the newest places on the Strip and although I'm a Vegas local of many years I'm originally from Wisconsin. An original location of Bavette's. I'll keep this review short & sweet.  I had the Bavette's salad ... delicious & healthy (ish), the filet was tender and yummy, the oysters were fresh, the Brussels and mac n cheese were also very good. The only reason I HAD to give it 4 stars it due to the pitch black ambiance. Truly you can't see a thing even with the lit candles. It's over the top and was so dark all of us agreed we wouldn't return because of that. Ambiance is a very big deal. Apparently the owners want to keep it dungeon dark but until that's rectified I nor my other foodie friends will return. It's nice to see what your food actually looks like, as well as your company! ?"}
{"text":"We were in town for the Blackhawks vs Knights game and after a quick search of the Monte Carlo website found this place. Although we are from Chicago, we somehow have never heard of it. We called to make a reservation for 7. All of the staff from the initial call to the servers and support staff were excellent. Our Maitre D' Brian was very attentive and made excellent recommendations. All of the food was cooked well and tasted very good. The seafood tower ordered was very fresh too. Not only will we be back here when in town, we'll also make it a point to visit the Chicago location."}
{"text":"Two of friends recommended this place where we were in Vegas. They said that they have a branch in Chicago as well and they been there and it was crazy good so they want to check out Vegas location as well. I was game.  We made reservations for three and got there 10 mins before the reservation time, so we were asked to wait 10 mins till our table was ready.  When you entered this place, the whole place have a very classy atmosphere. The waiting room was like a library with a lot of cool sofas.  After 10 mins, our server got us seated and we were served fresh bread. The bread was ok, but the butter was amazing. It was sweet with perfect amount of salt.  We decided to order 3 different things and plan to have it family style.  We ordered aged dry steak, cheese burger and French dip with truffle mac and cheese.  After 20 mins, we got our food and it was out if this world.   The steak was tender and amazing. The French dip was probably the best French dip sandwich I had ever and the burger was delicious too, but the best was truffle mac and cheese. It was marvellous. The fries were pretty good too.  Overall, a great experience and would love to check out Chicago location to compare which one is better."}
{"text":"In town for business from Chicago and after a long week, I needed a taste of home. Bavette's here is just as fantastic as the original in Chicago. I had their burger while sitting at the bar and if that's not the best deal in Las Vegas, I don't know what is!    For the price of a meh burger on the strip, you can have an amazing burger and perfectly cooked fries with truffle mayo. Have a piece of their scrumptious sourdough bread while waiting...and don't forget a champagne smash cocktail!  Service was warm, professional and polite. Atmosphere, especially after a week in Vegas, was calming and felt like you were in a \"real\" restaurant rather than part of the casino floor or dining in a mall like so many other places on the Strip.   You can bet Bavette's will be on my list when I return to Las Vegas again!"}
{"text":"Despite another steakhouse in a city that has way too many they have done a solid job at this one.  Came here to enjoy a piece of Chicago and to experience a tasty meal. Decor is great and love how dim the lights are once you arrive and are seated.  Started the dinner with a few cocktails in which they had a few different old fashions to choose from; I went with the Tokyo. Hints of smoke and sweetness was a nice sitter change to the traditional fan favorite.  Apps were:  Steak tartare- seasoned well needed a touch of lemon Shrimp cocktail- perfectly cooked shrimp and ice cold sauces to accompany them  Lyonnaise salad- super cold, great dressing and the bacon slabs they serve with are super tasty.  Entrees:  22oz dry aged b/I ribeye- ordered chared MR and arrived at the correct doneness and charring fantastic and served with bearnaise.  6oz petite duchess cut filet- ordered blue and was sent of correct. Served with the same sauce  Steaks had the house seasoning salt which I really didn't care for; it didn't add any value to the steak experience  Dessert:  Fudge Sunday with different types of candies- wasn't to impressed with this as they were bought candies versus making them yourselves..  All in all great experience server was attentive as well as the rest of the staff. Check them out"}
{"text":"Everything worked.  Perfect steak.  Great service.  However, we did not get seated until 15 minutes after our reservation time.  No comped apps or drinks (and it appeared others waiting longer).  Had it went any longer I would have been mad.  If this is a practice I suggest the restaurant post a disclaimer or the reviews on yelp will probably tank.  Once we sat down our server got our food out super fast so we made our show on time.  These seem to be the right kind of people running this place.  Stop in for a bite."}
{"text":"Oh what a disappointment for our last dinner in Vegas. I am a loyal Monte Carlo player and thoroughly enjoyed most of the restaurants that were there prior to the current renovation. I always welcome change and was very much looking forward to trying Bavette's and Primrose (which I'll review separately) during my first ever New Year's Eve in Vegas trip. There were four in my group and the others also enjoy and appreciate a good meal. The ambiance here is really cool, as it's like stepping back in time and it almost gives you the feeling of dining in a speakeasy. It's pretty darn dark so we needed to use the flashlights from our cellphones to navigate the menus, but this wasn't really a big deal and made us chuckle. (Perhaps offering small flashlights to guests would make for a nice touch?) We ordered the wedge salad which was delicious and the shellfish tower which was also amazing. The complimentary bread was also a hit. The Mac-in-cheese side is yummy and the roasted broccoli was just okay. The entrees were bone in NY strip (medium rare), 2 bone in ribeyes (medium rare to rare and medium), short rib stroganoff.  Although the food up to this point as very good (the service wasn't stellar - just average) I have to give a 2 star rating to a steakhouse that is known for, well, steak. All three steaks were tough and cooked improperly. The med rare NY strip was medium well. The medium to medium rare ribeye was medium well and the medium ribeye was very close to well done.  The waiter apologized, took each of our steaks and notified the manager. The manager acknowledged the poorly cooked steaks and apologized. He even went as far as saying he was embarrassed. I opted to bypass the steak altogether but the two others (Ribeyes) accepted newly prepared steaks. Even with the second preparation, the beef was tough and just the overall flavor quality was lacking. Dry aged beef should be very flavorful and tender - neither of which were present here. The restaurant took several items off our bill without us having to ask which was appreciated, but we would have preferred to pay for a great meal with top-notch ingredients and preparation."}
{"text":"Bavette's is amazing with it's back-into-time ambiance and apertifs.  The service is great, the tables are cozy and inviting, and the food is memorable."}
{"text":"Exceptional food worth the stop. Service was marginal. Slow with drinks. We had a party of 9 so you would think,they would be hovering. Over all rating based on food."}
{"text":"Wow! Where do I start? As soon as you walk in the door the sound of the casino melts away. Give your eyes a minute or two to adjust to the soft lighting. We were seated quickly and our waiter Robert came right over. Our first time here, he took his time and explained the menu to us. We ordered the Salmon Caesar Salad. Wow! This was such a unique dish, and the flavors were delicious.   The table ordered petite filets and rib-eyes. Everyone's steaks were cooked exactly as requested and they melted in your mouth. The charr crust was so tasty. Whenever there is Truffle mac n cheese on the menu, you can't pass that up. It did not disappoint! We almost order seconds because it went fast.   For desert we ordered the hot fudge sundae with 4 spoons. The presentation was beautiful. So many different toppings to choose from. Everyone left satisfied.   My only \"boo\" about the restaurant is they don't have an espresso machine. The only have French press coffee. Still super delicious and tasty but I was really wanting an espresso martini with dinner. Oh well."}
{"text":"First let me say I got charged $25 for parking.  The place is very dark...like good luck reading the menu dark.  I felt like I was too close to my neighbors as well.  I couldn't see them as much as hear every word that came out of their mouths.    Got the baked crab cake to start.  Its weird... there was a mild fishy flavor which is very odd because crab doesn't have a very strong fish flavor. I would certainly not order these again.  Ordered the 10 oz filet mignon.  It came cooked more than my liking.  Asked for medium and it came more like a medium well.  Normally I would not complain about such things as small as that however when you're paying the price you are then suddenly you get a little bit more nitpicky.  Now let's talk about the flavor.  Bland - as in it tasted like someone went to the grocery store picked up a cut and cooked it. No prep no spicing no additional flavoring of any kind. It did come with some weird yellow stuff in a silver cup...oh and a piece of parsley.  I did not try the yellow stuff.  I can think of off the top of my head at least 10 different places including my own kitchen that have better steaks in this place. And on top of that I don't have to pay $25 for parking at any of the other places that I would rather go to.  So I guess the bottom line is if you are looking for someplace where you will not be able to see, you will hear all of your neighbors conversations you'll pay an exorbitant amount of money for parking and you'll pay a premium price for some mediocre steak well then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"What a GEM! This restaurant is undersold and absolutely blew me away! I can't say enough about the service and the food. Carlos, Ivan and the chef know what it takes to deliver an exceptional experience. And the ambiance, incredible! The music, the dark woods, the warm feeling of the room is as comforting as the food. I highly recommend this as a Must Eat next time you're in town.   Favorite items:  - Duck & goat cheese terrine  - Bone in filet - Truffle mac n cheese  - Carrot cake"}
{"text":"Great experience, except for the most important thing.   My wife and I dined at Bavette's on Friday, May 11, 2018 before going to the U2 show at T-Mobile Arena. We were staying at Aria but chose Bavette's because of its proximity to the arena. We made reservations weeks in advance and were anxiously anticipating the dining experience. We've dined at some of the finest steakhouses in the country and tried to go to Bavette's in Chicago on a recent trip but failed to be able to get a reservation to fit our schedule.  First of all, the decor and atmosphere at Bavette's are superb. You'd never guess it was built just months ago. It has the look and feel of a vintage restaurant. Dark woods and rich, earth tones, coupled with low light create an upscale atmosphere. The restaurant was busy but we were seated promptly. The service was attentive (mostly, more below) and sophisticated, exactly as you would expect. The waiter greeted us and acknowledged that we were headed for the U2 concert, as were many patrons, and noted that he would get us going asap. We had an hour and thirty minutes alotted for the meal, which seemed ample on booking.  We skipped appetizers in order to be sure finish in time for the concert, but started with cocktails, both choosing the Champagne Smash. It was delicious but was mostly crushed ice, and at the $17.50 price tag, not a good value. We should have gone with a martini or bourbon, of which they have some excellent choices. The waiter explained that if steaks were ordered (as I intended) to expect a crusty char on the outside per their cooking style. This suited me fine. I started with the Ceasar salad, which though not disclosed by the waiter, came to the table with tongs and is enough for at least two and probably more like three or even four people. Fortunately, my wife had not ordered salad and I persuaded her to share, or we would have been severely overstocked with greens. For dinner, I ordered the filet, cooked medium. My wife ordered the spiced fried chicken and we chose the elote corn and brussel sprouts for sides. Let's begin with the positives. The chicken was excellent in flavor albeit a huge portion on a bed of mashed potatoes. The size was overwhelming to the point of being aburd. The sides were excellent and a good portion for sharing. I'd recommend the elote corn first, but the brussel sprouts were outstanding as well.   So, here's the rub. My steak, ordered medium (which the waiter repeated back to me when I ordered) had not a trace of pink inside. Instead it was gray throughout and cooked on the well side of medium well, by anyone's standards. It had a nice char on the outside, as described, but was totally dry inside. If not for the side of bearnaise, it would have been difficult to eat. I'm normally not picky about such things and expect some range when ordering a steak. I've ordered medium and gotten closer to medium rare, or closer to medium well. Either is fine, but this was vastly overcooked. Unfortunately, our waiter was absent for an extended period after I cut into my steak and, as it took about 45 minutes for us to receive the mains (probably due to fact that the steak was cook about 15 minutes too long), I had no opportunity to point out the chef's error as we were on a tight schedule to make the U2 concert. Had we had more time or had the waiter approached within a reasonable window, I would have politely explained and shown him that the steak was overcooked, though I doubt much could have been done at that point to accommodate our schedule. Needless to say, this was disappointing enough to taint the entire experience. It is really even difficult to say how good the cut of meat was, give that it was so dry as to be also lacking in significant flavor. I honestly don't think if it were served to someone who ordered it well done that they would have complained. It was that overcooked. By the time the waiter checked in again we were over halfway finished and I asked for the check in order to make sure we made the show on time.   So, overall, there were a lot of positives, but one major negative. A steakhouse should be able get the steak cooked within an acceptable range given the customer's request. This is the first time I've ever had this complaint at any of the dozens of steahouses I've visited around the country. I was rather shocked and disappointed that it happened here. I am going back to Vegas in June to stay at the Park MGM, where Bavette's is located. Sadly, I won't be dining there again."}
{"text":"It was ok. Filet mignon was not cooked exactly to specifications and waiter didn't know what the steak temps were when bringing them out so he mixed them up. I normally wouldn't care but at this price point I expect it to be perfect every time. Steak had a good flavor though. The wild mushrooms were ok. The brussel sprouts were very good!  Truffle mac n cheese was very good.  Overall, the meal was good but I just didn't see the level of attention to detail for the price point. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"First time here and our dinner experience was AMAZING!! Ill go into the food and service a little more but if I have to say anything negative about this place it would be that it's a little to dark inside. But thats just being picky. Inside the decor was nicely done with a bar located in the middle. We sat at a booth which was comfy and cozy.  We ended up ordering the crab cake, baked goat cheese, spiced fried chicken, 10 oz filet, charred broccoli, mac and cheese and bacon. We also received complimentary shrimp and tar tare.  I wont go into details about each dish but I will say everything was on point and amazingly delicious. Few of my favorite from the dishes we ordered has to be the mac n cheese and the filet with roasted garlic. But everything was so good and the portions were huge. This place is not one of the high priced restaurants that serve you small portions. You definitely get your moneys worth for the quality and the amount of food you get.  Throughout our visit Tony was our server who waited on us. He was very attentive and made sure we had everything we needed. Tony was very friendly and actually carried on a conversation with us.  After our delicious meal, we ended up receiving complimentary carrot cake and chocolate cake. So I have a place I goto back home for carrot cake which is my favorite dessert. The carrot cake back home is one of the best. After trying the carrot cake from Bavettes, I have a new winner. Bavettes carrot cake is moist, full of plump raisins and full of flavor. The chocolate cake is soooo smooth you can taste the dark chocolate they used.  We will definitely be returning again soon. This restaurant is one of our top 3 here in Vegas. Thk you Bavettes for an awesome dinner experience!!"}
{"text":"The food here is delicious. The service was great (had Gaga). I had one of the best old fashioned cocktails of my life (for those that don't know, old fashioned is an actual drink ).  Like most steakhouses it has limited hours and a dark cozy atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went last night.  Seafood tower was amazing, best crab I have ever had.   Also got the aged ribeye.   Soo much flavor."}
{"text":"Had the table lady didnt make us wait for almost 30 minutes before she get us to our table, it would have gotten a 4.5 stars review. Our reservation is for 2 people at 8pm. We arrived there at 8 and there were only 4 other people waiting for their tables. She (with an attitude) told us to wait cause our table were being prepared. We ended up waiting for almost 30minutes, despite arriving on time!!!  The restaurant was barely full and there were a lot of empty tables around us. I dont understand whats the deal with the waiting. And she seriously needs to work on her attitude. Really.   Aside from that. the food is pretty top notch, we had oysters for appetizer and (40minutes later) the dry aged rib eye and new york strip."}
{"text":"Service was spectacular. Decor was comfy old school. The place is very dark so anyone over 40 will have challenges reading the menu. Food that we ordered was ok. Good. Edible. Some great and some just ok. We wanted an assortment to share. Crab cake was excellent and full of lovely crab. The remoulade was overpowered with dill so one loved it and the others just ok. Steak was fabulous as were the frites. Brussel sprouts were not charred or crispy but baked and mushy.  Fried chicken was fully encrusted but I think they pound the chicken very thin as it was all crust and no chicken. One in our party ordered a Provence Rose but got sparkling. She just drank it. Wanted to order a craft cocktail. We went with wine this time. Our server bent over backwards and showed true hospitality spirit.  We never complained as it was ok."}
{"text":"WOW!!!! What an amazing Steakhouse. My husband and I went here for the first time and everything and everyone was beyond amazing!!. We loved the atmosphere and the food. The bone marrow was just delicious and the Filet Mignon with roasted garlic was superb and the Prime Beef French Dip was out of this world!!! Thank you Ivan the manager at Bavette's and Danielle for an outstanding service and our servers AJ and John went truly above and beyond for us. We were so amazed with everything that we went there the next day too!! Thank you so much to all of them. We will definitely be back next time we are in Vegas again."}
