{"text":"I ordered takeout for channa bhatura twice and both times the bhatura were still raw. I can actually see the dough inside the thick bhatura.  A1 really have gone downhill over the years."}
{"text":"I came here a few times with my co-works for lunch. I like to get the THALI combo which includes 3 veg.'s, 1 sweets, rice, salad, and naan or 2 rotis. The food taste great with a lot of flavor. The Gajar Halwa was my favourite. However, the service was slow."}
{"text":"This is one of my \"go-to\" spots when in Toronto.

There is very limited seating inside (has only 3 or 4 tables) and so is mainly a take-out place in my opinion.

But the Indian food is 100% vegetarian and is CLEAN! There is a wide selection of traditional sweets, samosa's (which tend to be very popular here) along with all your north indian (punjabi) dishes. 

I usually get a Veg-Thali to go which consists of rice, naan, a few veg options and one dessert...it all can be had for about $7 which is great since the portions are perfect.

On certain days, they do have other items on their menu (i forget). But they are closed on Mondays which seems to be the norm for most Indian places I encounter in Toronto."}
{"text":"The place is dark,  the lady at the front is impatient and rude and the sweets are stale."}
{"text":"Great food and sweets, but the staff seem very rude and impatient. It has been the same for years. Limited seating. But I wouldn't want to dine in and witness other customers too being treated rudely. If you go there, swallow the rudeness, take the good food and run. Their Channa Batura is the best I have tasted in the GTA."}
{"text":"My family and I have been going to A1 for the past 5 years and we have always received excellent food. A1 is  mainly a takeout place in my opinion because it has limited seating but the food is consistently good. 

The prices are reasonable as well since they charge for curries by the container and naan and roti is separate. They also sell indian sweets by the pound and they have a large variety during Diwali. They offer snacks as well such as samosa chaat, aloo tikkis, bhel puri, and pakodas. 

The service is fast and you can order and have your food within 5-15 mins tops. If you're ever in Scarborough and you're craving good Indian food, I urge you to try A1!"}
{"text":"I just found a COCKROACH in my malai kofta from A1 sweets, located at 3300 McNicoll Ave!!! DO NOT EAT ANYTHING FROM THIS RESTAURANT! We're reporting them to Toronto food health and safety. YUCK!"}
{"text":"Overall decent indian food at a great price. My standard order is the $7.99 thali, I love the variety it offers. 

My favorites are the shahi paneer, potato eggplant, matar paneer and aloo tikki. I wish they offered the aloo baingan  (potato eggplant) as an everyday offering, I have to order a party tray every time I want it (which I do, I like it that much). 

Sometimes the curries have a thick layer of oil sitting on the top, the samosas are okay (nothing special) and the chana masala has been oversalted all 5x I have tried it. Other than that, great variety at an affordable price."}
{"text":"We ordered the halwa puri. (They only have it available on weekends) My husband and I loved it! The food is spiced well. It had the correct amount of spice for us. We also ordered the 2 veggie meal. We chose the get the malai kofta and the shahi paneer. It was delicious, enough to feed 2 people with plenty leftover. Will definitely be returning again."}
{"text":"We were a few blocks away and let's looking for an Indian (casual) place, when I remembered that the A1 from Oakville has a branch in Scarborough, lucky we were less than five minute drive away. 

Ordered two Thalia with naan and a Methi Potato with Roti the Potato being one of the two non dairy option on the menu. The service was a bit slow even though the restaurant being not super busy. 

But as soon as the naans and roti made in tandoor were ready we were quickly served. The place needs a bit of clean up, not overly dirty it compared to the one Oakville it certainly needs some clean up. 

The naans were super fresh and fluffy and rotis my preferred option were made to perfection. Warm, soft and whole wheat- yum! Could have eaten just the rotis plain. The Potato needed some additional seasonings as we all felt it lower in salt. The Okra had too much oil. Traditionally that's how Okra is cooked (with little or no water), however some places we have seen have taken care of that problem. 

The rest of the dishes were good, only the Malai Kofta had green peas, which was out place. 

For $8+taxes for Thali its a fair price."}
{"text":"Awesome, quick take out. One of my favorite and economic options for vegetarian Indian restaurants. 

I've been a regular for years, and will continue to support these guys!"}
{"text":"Mattar Paneer - 3/5 
Initial thoughts..The sauce needs more work. It was a tad bit more sweeter then what I've tried elsewhere. I would have appreciated some more paneer in it. I don't like how they leave that black pod thing (it's a spice) because I'm sure it's just there to flavour the sauce during cooking. 

Channa Masala - 3.5/5
It was good, but nothing that sets it apart from other restaurants. 

Garlic Naan - 4.5/5
Nice and garlicy. Light and fluffy. 

Given this places popularity and long takeout lineup, I am still eager to try some of their sweets and other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Best damn Chana Bhattura I have had. The food is really tasty... Finger lock-in' good!"}
{"text":"A-1 has been in existence for many years now, and those in the Indian community living in Richmond Hill-Markham-Scarborough area, regard it as the go to spot for inexpensive takeout. 

It's a tiny family-run restaurant with a few hired cooks in the kitchen, where you can order snacks like samosas, pani puri and even a full Thali. I'm not too keen on the Thalis, since I tend to find the spices pre-made, and the overall dishes exceptionally bland and infused with sugar, but I can see how this type of fast-food Indian restaurant would stay in business. It's a one-stop restaurant for anything you could think of ordering in terms of Indian food. 

The desserts are also a hit and miss since I've found their Rasgulas to be fresh, soft and lightly sweet at times, like they ought to be and at others, hard as a rock and overly sweet, when they happen to be sitting out for a while. As it happens, you'll never know by simply looking at them. 

I do enjoy their samosas, however, since I believe they are made on location, because they taste very fresh, and well-stuffed and seasoned albeit very greasy.  

I'll go here for the snacks, but I steer completely clear from main dishes."}
{"text":"PLACE: 

A1 is a great place to get Indian food especially when you want to eat at home or take it out else where! They do have seats in the restaurant but its not a fancy place and definitely not a restaurant type of place as people are always coming in and leaving. The seating area is not the cleanest, but after renovating, it has gotten better. The parking lot has plenty of space for people to park as its in a plaza. 

FOOD: 

The veggie biryani can come to cater your spice needs (mild or hot). I eat a lot of spicy food so when its hot and fresh, the biryani is spicy which I like! It comes with the pickled carrots/onions, raita, and the biryani itself topped with paneer the first time that I got this, but the second time was almonds. The raita and biryani is a good pair and tasted delicious.I'm not a fan of the carrots but I have many friends who enjoy it and even ask for extras! 

The thali is a great deal to get! It comes with 3 curries, naan or roti, a dessert, salad, rice, and raita (yogurt type of side). The curries were delicious, creamy, and just the right amount of saltiness and sweetness. Some of the curries could be spicer but majority of the population don't like it that way which makes sense why they wouldn't increase their spice level. Overall, I enjoyed the curries. They have tons of paneer curry options which I love! The salad is not enough and I wish there was more especially cause it's split with the rice portion. However, they do make it up with the naan or roti you get. 

They have a variety of sweets aligned for you to pick right away as well. 

SERVICE: 

They are fast and friendly. If you call in and order or order online, its even faster! I was in and out within 5 minutes. 

PRICE:

Amazing prices for the amount of food we get. $4.99 for the biryani and $7.99 or so for thali."}
{"text":"A regular go-to for my family, we mainly go for the the vegetable thali. Great little takeout place with fair prices. Especially love that I can switch the dessert item with another subji."}
{"text":"My experience @ A-One was not just as they describe; Not A-one but A-OK nonetheless. My  spinach and roti combo was filling but fresh-out-of-the kitchen -at home kind of bland. Service was very prompt. A great place if you want a good and fresh meal in a rush."}
{"text":"I am not a vegetarian and I didn't USED to like spicy food, but this was the place that turned it all around for me. I really like the to go meals but we just tried to eat in this time and it was surprisingly nicely setup. 

According to my Indian friend, this place has everything that you can think of for vegetarian Indian cuisine. 

When I first started going here, I was sweating while eating. Don't anymore but still, some good eats."}
{"text":"Very good Indian vegetarian food. We've tried the thali and the saag was excellent, today is Diwali and we had the channa combo and it was fresh and delicious (mix the potatoes and channa), the bead was made to order so there is a bit of a wait. On weekends they serve an excellent halwa puri."}
