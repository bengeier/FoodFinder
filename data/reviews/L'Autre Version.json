{"text":"My husband and I came here for dessert and wine on a Saturday night. They had live jazz from 8-10pm, which we enjoyed. Atmosphere is calming and quiet and the staff are very nice.  They have an extensive wine list but we settled to go by the glass, which was affordable. For dessert we had maple doughnuts served with crushed pistachios, and maple and apple toppings. It was very good, although it would have been ever better if the doughnuts were warm.  We also had a cheesecake plated with a tiny bit of sorbet and fresh fruit. It was a crustless cheesecake served in a cylindrical shape. It was yummy and you can tell it was made with more cheese than flour, but I think I enjoy traditional cheesecake just a tad more.  All in all, this is a very nice place to come for dinner on a weekend in Old Port! The live jazz was a big plus."}
{"text":"This restaurant was such a treat. After the BIXI around Montreal, walking around old city, you will find this restaurant in a quieter street in old city. We had the tasting menu. It was delicious!"}
{"text":"Awesome food. Excellent meat quality and very tasty. Highly recommend it! Nice outside patio."}
{"text":"My wife and I visited l'Autre Version on a Friday night during our vacation from the United States. It was our second night in Montreal; the first of which was spent at an outstanding restaurant serving traditional French food. We had heard good things about l'Autre Version, so our expectations were high going into the meal.   Although our dinner started off well, we were soon sorely disappointed. When our entrees arrived, my wife received something she did not order. Mistakes happen, and we took it in stride, but what followed was an unacceptable lapse in customer service that should never have happened in a restaurant of the caliber at which l'Autre Version claims to be. First, the waiter (likely in an effort to make life easier for himself) convinced me to keep my entree rather than ask the kitchen to make a new one, promising us that her entree would be out in ten minutes or less. 25 minutes later, my wife received her dinner after my plate was mostly cleared (and the rest of my food now cold) despite my efforts to eat slowly so that we could eat part of our dinner together. During this time, our waiter checked in once--after my wife's wine glass was already empty--to tell us that her meal would be out in two minutes (it wasn't). After she received her meal, he disappeared again until time to deliver the check--comping a glass of wine for my wife and half of her $30+ entree. My wine glass, long drained by that point (the pours were particularly stingy) apparently was never noticed.   Maybe our waiter was embarrassed or maybe he just didn't care, but the level of service is certainly some of the worst we have ever experienced. The waiter was correct when he said that comping half of my wife's meal was \"the least\" the restaurant could do; he certainly made no effort to do anything more than that. We recommend that you skip l'Autre Version."}
{"text":"We came to Montreal for the Jazz Festival hoping to experience some of the great food and drink that we'd heard so much about, along with the fabulous music. It wasn't until our fourth night in the city that we discovered this amazing place and felt that we'd had the culinary experience we'd been looking for. I generally don't like to spend lots of money on dinner, but if I am going to do so I want to be \"wowed\" and I want to have a meal that doesn't leave me feeling that I could have made it myself at home. L'Autre Version specializes in locally grown/raised foods. We arrived on a Saturday night without a reservation and were delighted to be seated right away at a nice table in their back terrace. This lovely outdoor space is a beautiful green oasis and escape from the hustle and bustle just outside in Vieux Montreal. The service was perfect. The wait staff always seemed to be there just when we needed them, but remained unobtrusive and almost invisible while we enjoyed the food, wine, and conversation. We started with sautéed local mushrooms served on an actual piece of tree bark with a smoking piece of fresh thyme, some lichen (yes lichen) and sea lettuce.  These ingredients might give one pause, but the combination was absolutely perfect, creating a perfect blend of color, smell, texture and taste. For the main course I had venison served with mushrooms, barley nettle risotto and a delicious sauce. The meat was rare, tender, and delicious. My wife had Lake Walleye with broccoli. The fish was a bit bland but the sauce was delicious. The mix of local fresh ingredients prepared to perfection and presented with an artist's flair left us fully satisfied. Dessert was to the same high standard. I had a chocolate plate with a range of different types of chocolate, while my wife had mini beignets served in an aluminum can. Our meal at L'Autre Version was one of the best we've had, and one that will stand out in our memories for a long time."}
{"text":"***CUTE WAITER ALERT***  I was in Montreal for work this past week and had only free night. My colleague and I decided we were going to head down to Old Montreal. We asked concierge for a restaurant recommendation and she suggested a place off Rue Saint-Paul. I can't remember the name of the place but when we arrived at the location, we learned they were closed for a few days. Darn! But there were a good number of restaurants on that street and after walking a few doors down, we came across and settled on L'Autre Version.   The restaurant was fairly quiet on a Wednesday night. Besides the 2 of us, there were only 4 other parties throughout our entire 3 hour meal. Our waiter's name was Jean Claude I believe. I'd describe him as nerdy cute. He was tall, slender, good looking, with nicely-styled hair, black framed glasses and the cutest smile. I could picture him walking a high fashion runway vs. waiting tables. This young 25 year old was somewhat bashful which made him even more adorable. He was definitely nice eye candy for us older, married women. Along with his French accent...super dreamy! Ok, I'm starting to sound like a pervert so I'll move onto the food.  The hostess that seated us told us that on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, they offered half-priced bottles on some of their wines. Sweet! We decided on a red wine from France - Julienas Domiane de la Conseillere. It was on the peppery side and very delicious.  They were offering a tasting menu which we decided to share. This included a mise en bouche, 4 entrees, and a pastry surprise. You could add the foie gras dish for an additional charge which we did. We also ordered the Charcuterie Platter and Fall Salad. Prior to bringing out the food, they brought us some bread. Besides the usual olive oil & balsamic vinegar mixture and butter, there was salt and apple cider vinegar. You simply dip your bread in the ACV followed by salt. I suppose it's similar to how one eats fish & chips. I wasn't the biggest fan but my colleague loved it.  -----  *Fall Salad - served w/pears, pecans and shaved parmesan topped with a maple syrup vinaigrette. The salad was light and refreshing.  *Charcuterie Platter - there were 4 slices each of Genoa, coppa, speck, and a 4th type which unfortunately I wasn't sure how to pronounce let alone spell. This was accompanied with a side of apple chutney which provided a nice sweet/savory balance.  -----  \"The Good Version Tasting Menu\":  *The mise en bouche was Lobster Arancini - served with a saffron sauce. I loved the cheesy risotto center and crunchy outer coating.  *Salmon Mi-Cuit - half cooked salmon w/horseradish sauce and topped with coriander panko. This was served with a side of greens, pickled onions and a lemony dressing. The texture of the salmon was smooth and buttery...practically melts in your mouth. And I liked the slight crunch from the panko.  *Scallops - served with cauliflower purée and king eryngii mushroom. The scallops were cooked to perfection and topped with a caper sauce. The purée was silky and the mushrooms offered a nice bite.  *Foie Gras Torchon - served with homemade brioche and a side of greens and golden beets. The piece of foie gras was lightly coated with pistachios. The foie gras was nice and creamy.  *Beef Carpaccio - served with arugula pesto, grainy dijonnaise, some type of sprouts, parmesan and capers. The capers seemed to be deep fried adding a unique texture.  *Braised Beef Short Rib - braised for 11 hours and served over crispy polenta. The meat was so tender and had just the right amount of fat to give it added flavor. There's nothing worse than dry polenta but that wasn't the case here because the polenta was crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. This was served with a napa cabbage salad and almonds. I loved the added crunch from the almonds and the acidic dressing on the salad helped neutralize any saltiness. We were so full by the time they brought this out and so bummed we weren't able to finish it all.  *The pastry surprise was a chocolate mousse. It was decadent but not too sweet. I don't typically care for chocolate desserts but really enjoyed this one.  -----  Each and every dish was beautifully plated with the chef using food to create his masterpieces. We didn't catch his name but the server that brought out the food did a great job explaining each dish. At the end of our meal, JC asked us which dish was our favorite and we both couldn't say because everything tasted so good. Each dish was complex in flavor and texture. It was obvious that the chef put a lot of thought into making sure each ingredient used complemented one another. This was clearly a meal to remember and there was not one item that fell short of our expectations.  **Tip - The restaurant offers free wifi. Just ask for the code. It was tough for us U.S. visitors to be  out-and-about without data so this was very much appreciated."}
{"text":"The best meal that we had in town.  Call it four and a half.    The was a jazz quartet wrapping up just as we were led out to their patio for dinner.  The setting is very sleek and hip and the patio was like some kind of lounge you might see in Miami.  The cuisine is French and it was all great.  We started with the Two way tuna Sashimi on algae salad, unilateral paned tuna, mango and Espelette pepper salsa, Yuzu emulsion.  Very good and fresh tuna.  For our entrees my wife had the Blue Marlin, rice lettuce sauce, sweet potatoes and sundried tomatoes purée, paprika piperade, artichoke and daikon crushed.  She loved it.  I had the good and bloody Venison Boston, cipollini and Banyuls vinegar sauce, Guinness cheddar potato purée, Kenya beans sautéed, tomatoes and chipotle compote.  Yeah, it was fantastic.  And did you see that?  Guinness.  Cheddar.  Potato. Puree.  I rarely notice anything but Venison when I have it.  But, that was just brilliant!  We had to wrap with a sweet and had the Nut cake, cherry compote, and coconut cloud.    Our service was good and the food was great.  It just about took my mind off of the chain smoking Frenchies that were rightontopofus and upwind.  Just about.  Thanks for that extra helping of emphysema to go along with my meal."}
{"text":"Really impressive menu, service and tasting experience! I went here for a work dinner this Tuesday night. The street was bustling but this restaurant was quiet. I'm not sure why though as I was impressed with everything. We started with a complimentary gazpacho in shot glasses. It was wonderfully refreshing. I had the tomato salad followed by rainbow trout with a chick pea side (almost like a polenta). The rainbow trout was served on a slate slab. Presentation looked fabulous and the taste of the smoked/cooked rainbow trout was exquisite. I had a dessert which consisted of chilled fruit pieces- Beautifully served and perfectly refreshing after an adequate meal. I would highly recommend this place for an upscale dining experience either for a special personal occasion or to impress your workmates."}
{"text":"3.5  I liked L'Autre Version more than I expected I would. I am usually not very enamored of places that look like they were designed by senior citizens who still go to nightclubs. Paying for decor, especially when it's silly, is not my idea of a value proposition.   But the venison tartar was good and fresh. Pickled cauliflower was a good, bracing accompaniment, but almost too dominant. A fairly classic roast duck presentation was better still, though I'd like a mushroom that better complements the bird. Who wouldn't?  Under ordinary circumstances I would have indicated a 3.5 star rating with three stars above. But I think it's important that this place's average review score reflect reality. And not disaffected complaints.  Our service, if you're wondering, was very good."}
{"text":"We had an early dinner reservation. I think we were literally the first diners to be seated. I recall service was leisurely attentive, which was fine with us. Nice atmosphere to spend some time. I don't specifically recall what we ate for dinner (this review is over a year post visit.) what I do remember are the DESSERTS. They are served as themed tasting plates. Beautifully presented. I had \"le chocolat.\" Wife had \"led sucres.\" some of the most delectable bites of sweetness I've ever indulged, particularly \"les sucres.\" A top notch dining experience."}
{"text":"Everything was spot on: from amuse bouche to dessert, so good.  Service was wonderful, everyone was friendly, helpful and knowledgeable.  This was our Anniversary dinner and it was definitely great for that.  We also loved the bar and decor.  Very much enjoyed our whole experience."}
{"text":"The service was horrible.    The food was mediocre for the price point of $100 per person.    The restaurant staff has a responsibility to diners to inform them that they have a party of 30 that they have sat during prime dinner hours.  35 minutes to receive the 1st course is unheard of.  Was at least 15 - 20 minutes between successive courses.   $14 for a Manhattan cocktail makes you wonder if you are in Manhattan.  Under poured wine is a disgrace, especially when the glasses are marked for pour levels.  Waitstaff made no attempts at explaining the delays, until we brought to their attention that we saw the party of 30 people leave the building.  For $100 per person, the evening was a total failure in our book."}
{"text":"J'ai essayé l'Autre Version pour le brunch dans le cadre du festival Montreal à Table. Le resto ne fait pas de déjeuner habituellement, c'était donc un test autant pour eux que pour moi. Le menu était fixé à 21$ et ça incluait 1 plat (parmi 3 choix), un macaron et 1 mimosa. Mon amie a essayé les bénédictines au saumon fumé et elle a bien aimé. De mon côté, j'ai essayé la crêpe aux herbes avec le lapin braisé. Les saveurs étaient intéressantes et présentes, mais le plat était malheureusement froid. Les portions étaient plutôt petites, nous avions donc encore faim en quittant le resto. Apres coup, je dirais que considérant la portion des plats, le mimosa \"inclus\" nous est en fait chargé dans le prix. A lui seul, le plat ne vaut vraiment pas le 21$. Malgré que les plats n'étaient vraiment pas mauvais, je ne retournerais pas à l'Autre Version pour le brunch. Je serais toutefois bien ouverte à l'essayer pour le souper, j'ai entendu de bons commentaires."}
{"text":"Great food, good service, beautiful outdoor dining space (the interior was a bit dark and unappealing).  We had a large party of 10 and chose to sit outside in the beautiful courtyard. When it got a bit too sunny and hot, the staff moved three large ( and heavy ) shade umbrellas for us in order to keep us cool.  The food was beautifully presented and tasted great as well. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Without reservations on a Saturday, this was the best \"unplanned measure\" to impress a date!! Not sure of the reviews regarding poor service, because the entire \"Team\" was outstanding. If you are looking for a top-notch experience, L'Autre Version is your place. Before I could think of my needs, the server team was already moving in sync to first anticipate and then  over-deliver in expectations! Oh -- the team also presented themselves in an unassuming manner and took cues from our progress to not disrupt our ebb and flow throughout the experience. Again -- clearly, the team is well versed on the menu, training, and understand the end-user is the customer. Thanks!   Menu was perfect for a selective 'pescatarian' with a nose for pairings of wine.  If you too are a freak about an all-inclusive indulgence -- this was it!   Can't wait to return to Montreal for this special treat."}
{"text":"Excellente table au coeur du Vieux-Montréal. La carte n'est pas très longue mais assez variée, la cuisine est bien exécutée quoique les portions sont limites à mon avis. Le service est attentionné et très professionnel. C'était ma troisième visite et à chaque fois je me dis que je reviendrai. Les prix sont un brin élevés mais on en a pour son argent donc ça va. Le seul bémol c'est la liste de vin au verre qui m'a paru courte et trop chère mais j'ai pas regardé le reste de la liste."}
