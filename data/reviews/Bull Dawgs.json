{"text":"Waited in line for quite some time (expected). When I finally got to order they could not get my card to work, which can happen on mobile swiping devices, but I was never immediately informed of this or asked if I could pay another way, instead I was just pushed aside while other people ordered. Finally I was told that my card didn't work. I said I would've paid cash if you'd of told me that my card didn't work.  By that time 5 people had ordered in front of me so I walked away. Rude and unprofessional. Who knows if their dogs are any good. I won't be putting in the trouble again to find out."}
{"text":"Drove up to Pitt with a fellow chef from Phoenix, while he was in doing his tasting, I went to PPM to check it out! I ended up eating here and got the lunch special which filled me right up. I had the public market dog with the corn relish and it was beyond good! My only complaint is that I didn't have enough room in my stomach to try all the different dogs! I will definitely be stopping here next time I'm back in town!"}
{"text":"I had the Southside Dawg and the Georgia Peach Dawg today!
Both good, but I enjoyed the Georgia Peach the most. Hotdogs are hot, the buns are super fresh, and their soda options are great!
But if we're being honest, I will go back to Bulldawgs simply for the customer service. The guys are super friendly and accommodating, they thanked me 3 different times for stopping by, and care about their business and its customers."}
{"text":"Waited in line for 20 minutes just to be told that they didn't have the item that was listed on the menu on the truck.  Asked why it was on the board still.  She said because we have the item.  Just not today.  And just sat there and stared at me.  OMG.  What kind of business is this?!? Get it together."}
{"text":"High quality beef dogs, chewy fresh bread, inventive toppings, and wonderful service!"}
{"text":"It was surpassing to find a hot dog food truck with ZERO vegetarian options when attempting to order, and disappointing that the staff hardly seemed surprised when requesting such a dish. 

After coming to terms with the lack of veggie options (a lone pathetic fries dish was all that was offered), I ordered a few other things as a compromise. When I attempted to pay with my American Express (which they have a socket for in the window) I was declined with zero sympathy. 

Not a lot of empathy from the staff and poor options for not meat eaters will have me steering clear next time I see bull dawgs pulled up somewhere. There are better options with friendlier service aplenty."}
{"text":"I love this food truck you guys!! I'm addicted to their dogs and fries. I've been to a few events and they've never disappointed. Not sure where their actual physical location is these days but I know for a fact they can still be found at events all around the city. 
Prices are decent with great combo deals.
My fave is the chili dog with provolone for sure."}
