{"text":"Scaccia is a good place to get Italian in downtown Toronto.  The service was great and our server was knowledgeable about the menu.  I had the Pesto (oil based) and my friend had the Fettuccine Alfredo.  The Pesto was to die for, honestly the best Pesto I have had in years.  The Alfredo was apparently a bit too heavy and could have done without the pepper.  The Cabernet was just alright.  We shared the chocolate Tartufo for desert (ice cream with dusted chocolate and a vanilla center with nuts on top), which was also quite good.  The prices were reasonable.  57 bucks before tip for two meals, wine for one and desert."}
{"text":"The pasta is really good, but the customer service is terrible. The girl at the cash actively ignored me for almost two minutes to talk to another coworker about a guy she just saw. Made me feel very uncomfortable. Lasagna and manicotti is fantastic, though!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years mainly as I work in the building. Yes it can be pricey for what you're getting but for the most part they do offer delicious food. I prefer to eat in, in which case you'll get much better service. 
The Pepina Salad is amazing! I've had sausage scaccia, lasagna, penne with olive oil and veggies (yum) and seafood pasta, it's all great!!! Their grab and go salads (tuna pasta, etc..) are quite good too. 
In terms of the service, it's clearly all family as all the servers and cashier girl have been there for years, which means it won't change, but it's a limited interaction and I think the food is worth it."}
{"text":"I've eaten here 3x, and while the food is ok, I find it a little expensive. The real problem, and the main reason for the low rating, is the service; it's horrible. The staff is rude, unfriendly, and bitter. I've never seen or been given a friendly smile, or heard any excitement from anyone. They don't even pay attention to you when you walk up to order. I've also seen a girl get pretty angry at another worker and I heard her call her a \"f*cking b*tch\" and they basically started a short argument.
Unfortunately, I'm done with this place. While it may be convenient to get lunch here once in a while, this type of service will stop me from coming back."}
{"text":"My personal experience when visiting: Very not good. Staff didn't pay attention to me. Pasta was from a can of Chef Boyardee ravioli."}
{"text":"Awesome Italian deli in the basement of the Manulife Centre. They also have seating and a quaint little restaurant attached but the mall vibe of the Manulife is unshakable for me, so I've never actually sat down to eat. The people who work the deli counter are really well versed in the menu and are very nice and helpful over all. This is a godsend when you're going to a movie at the Varsity and you don't want to eat crap movie food. I get the Nicoise salad, but that's what I seem to eat everywhere. I have never heard a bad word about any of the take away."}
{"text":"I find that this restaurant provides fast and friendly service and great food for the price. I have eaten here many times and always thoroughly enjoy my meals. Give it a try."}
{"text":"Food is just OK, service is HORRIBLE.  I have been here every once in a while over the past 4 yrs, and every experience leaves such a bad impression...They ignore you if you try to interrupt their conversation to order your food. They are rude when you finally get their attention.... today the girl helping me made a loud sigh and rolled her eyes as I paused to get the money out of my wallet! No sense of urgency, and no regard for keeping the customers happy. All my coworkers have now stopped eating here, and I am DEFINITELY not going back. The food isn't even worth it."}
{"text":"This is a great lunch time spot for take out food, in the often very over priced Yorkville area. I've never sat and ate at the restaurant, but I really like the take out. 

The menu can be a bit confusing (contains name of dish but no description of content/ingredients) which I suspect might be why I've gone for the pasta of the day a few times as the ingredients are clearly explained.

The food is good quality and portions are big. You get an optional bread roll when you pay, and this is always delicious and fresh too. I found their lasagne to be a little bland, but still OK. The packaged pasta boxes are also really good, and decent value.

My problem with Scaccia, and from a look at other reviews I'm not alone, is the service. The girls that work there are (generally) snappy, interested in their own conversations and not focused on the customers. Their attitude makes me feel I'm both an nuisance and definitely an afterthought...not exactly a shining example of customer service! I've witnessed a chef in the kitchen shout at one of the girls, completely disregarding myself and my colleague stood in front of her - very disrespectful both to the girl and to the customers. 

I overheard a woman, who I think was briefing a friend who had never visited before - and it sums up my feelings too - \"you come here for the food, not the service...\""}
{"text":"Pretty terrible. Very expensive for pretty horrible food. Veal was not even veal, very tough. Chicken parm tasted like it was coated in bleach. Went back to get something different - got better- however unremarkable paninis. Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"I tried Scaccia for the first time this week and I really enjoyed the lasagna. I have to agree with the other reviewers' comments on here about the indifferent service received from the women at the takeout counter - smile a little! Life's too short to look so miserable. It also took some time to get my food, and I imagine it's because they heat it up, so this wasn't really a big issue. It's the service that is a real downer at this place."}
{"text":"There's a serious lack of cheap, decent quality lunch options in the Bay/Bloor area that are not chains, so I was happy to find this place.

I had the lasagne (to eat in) and it was really good. Made with real meat (not crappy meat sauce) and the sheets were thick and filling. My DC had the risotto con pesci and loved it.

As others have said, the service wasn't uber-friendly. It was also slightly on the slow side in terms of delivering the food. This wasn't an issue for me, as I had an hour to spend, but for those looking to eat in on a quick lunch break, takeout is probably the best option.

I'd happily return here though. 3.5/5"}
{"text":"Scaccia is a good place for some quick Italian takeout.  Anything that I've tried here has been pretty good and had no disappointments.  We've never attempted eating at the restaurant itself but there's nothing appealing about the atmosphere to really ever encourage us to do so either."}
{"text":"Ordered from their front counter. Didn't understand that there was a difference between take out and dine in. Decided to sit down and was promptly told to leave the dining room. More than three quarters of the dining room was empty. Wasn't told in a particularly polite way. The food is not great to begin with. My guess is only their location keeps them in business.  So many places avoid this one."}
{"text":"The food is really quite good, not bad sandwiches out front and good food and nice ambiance in the dining room. The only reservation I have is with some of female staff, who are almost laughably indifferent, bordering on unpleasant. More than once they've been seen storming around, rolling their eyes and shaking their heads, giving the impression of not being very happy to be there and not caring to hide it.
Otherwise, some lovely soups and one really pleasant male host or server who somewhat makes up for the attitude of at least a couple of the ladies."}
{"text":"Scaccia's quailty has declined in the last 2 years.  I used to be a regular and always ordered their manicotti.  The last 3 occasions the food was overcooked, the sauce watered down, the cheese was low quality and so was the bread.  Scaccia is just not the same anymore.  I am no longer a fan.  Update:  Jan 2013 - I tried it again like a fool.  I threw out half my meal.  I got the manicotti and it was wayyy overcooked.  Can't believe they actually sell this.  Gross.  My stomach is sill burning at midnight. Never again."}
{"text":"Great place for grab and go Italian sandwiches and pastas.  The prices are decent for the area. We got two scaccia sanwhiches for $13 and it filled the two of us up for the afternoon.

They also have a selection of Italian sweets as well."}
{"text":"Rude service and rather bland pasta.  But on the other hand if you wanna get take out pasta in the area it is your only real option.  

I always saw I won't go back but then again I am lazy."}
{"text":"Ordered their chorizo sandwich. It was delicious. Very flavourful sausage and very tasty bread. However it is quite expensive and the service was pretty slow"}
{"text":"I eat here at lunchtime and take it to go. I've never actually sat in the restaurant. However, the take out I get is great. Their beef lasagna is SO HEARTY AND YUMMY. I absolutely love it. Also, I get their shortbread cookies with chocolate chips in it. Also, yummy."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars.

Walked past this place way too many times to not try it at least once. It's a nice swanky place though it is a little costly. I think it costs a little less to eat outside at the tables rather then being seated within their restaurant.

It's nice to just grab a latte here and read a book for class or something, which I did!

I also ordered a scaccia (veal and spinach) that was okay, nothing too special. I mostly just ordered it because the restaurant was also called Scaccia!

For a full review and pictures, feel free to visit my blog, conveniently located in my profile. Happy eats, fellow yelpers!"}
{"text":"Came back again to try their pasta - the penne pesto cream with Parmesan cheese was on the dry side, but still flavourful for the most part. The pesto cream was accompanied by sundried tomatoes which really helped the dish along - it would've been plain and dry otherwise. I added one meatball for $3 - they're quite large and do taste great, and are not overcooked, however the price is steep. I'd go for a wetter pasta sauce next time and perhaps hold on the Parm to keep things more moist. No complaints about the texture of the pasta, wasn't disappointed by wait time, and happy that bread and butter are on the house - the cashier will ask if you're interested!

----

Very, very impressed with the scaccia I picked up today for lunch. Conveniently steps away from my office, this was a recommendation from a colleague and it hit the spot for my party of four. Unfortunately, the dine-in area was quite full, and a colleague later informed me that there's a surcharge for dining in anyways. There's common area seating facing the shop, and a bit of patience will help you find a seat. There's a decent lunch crowd so think quickly and don't expect tons of service - we're all busy people here.

We grabbed takeout during the busy lunch hour--Scaccia is a bit cafeteria/food court style on their take-out front. Order on the left hand side where the fridge containing all the scaccia sandwiches is. The line progresses to the right, you pay, and wait. Your scaccia will be toasted (optional, but I wouldn't recommend it any other way) and arrive to you in a foil lined bag, piping hot. My first time getting a scaccia, it seemed like a panini made out of a flat loaf corner. The crust is crunchy but easy to bite into, and the contents are filling and plentiful, but not excessive. The scaccia of the day was chicken, broccoli, and cheddar. I expected a flavour that oozed processed cheddar cheese, but I was pleasantly surprised by a quiche-like combination of broccoli and chicken taking center stage. The foil bag definitely helped keep the sandwich warm--especially useful for slow eaters like myself.

Some of my party ordered pastas: penne alla vodka with meatballs and frutti de mare. Both looked decent and neither individual had any trouble cleaning off all their food. The portions are just right for lunch, and sum to around $10-$15 making it one of the best bang-for-buck deals in the area. If you find this expensive - welcome to Yorkville!

I'll definitely be back - always down for Italian style comfort food, and their pastry fridge was very tempting! It's clear that food items are not made to order - lots is precooked, pre-prepared, refrigerated...but really, my lunch from home was made three days ago too, so it's all about the same."}
{"text":"Although I've never eaten in the main dining room, I usually come here for some good  Italian food for a quick lunch. Their pastas are pretty hearty and tasty, as are their scaccias. There's a decent selection of sandwiches and cold pasta salads as well, in addition to some cakes and other dessert items. 

Although I do like their food, service is a bit subpar, with indifferent and unfriendly staff behind the counter. There's not much that really makes this place stand out, but if you're in the area looking for a quick reasonably-priced lunch, then Scaccia is a good option."}
{"text":"This little hybrid cafe / resteraunt in the Manulife centre is a bit strange. Big take out counter with pasta and sandwiches plus a menu for sit down dinners. I came here yesterday to grab a bite.  Had a veal sandwich and a pelogrino. 

The veal sandwich was okay, with a lot of spinach. I asked for it heated up and I think it got lost in the shuffle. 4 orders of pasta came out before my sandwich was finished in the toaster oven.... Or maybe someone forgot about it. Not great. Service seemed a little disorganized especially since there were 5 staff kinda standing around. I never blame bad service on the staff ( service industry is tough! ) But on bad training or bad organization. The place seems to have a lot of turnover which makes me suspect the ownership is hard to love ..."}
{"text":"The servers were very nice, but that does not make up for the quality of pasta. Honestly, fettucine alfredo at Pizza Pizza was better than this watery version with rubbery pasta."}
{"text":"It used to be amazing.  Highlight of my day.  And then....something happened.  Probably a change in management?  Who knows.  But the staff got snobby and rude.  The wait in line got longer for no reason.  The soup got saltier and the sandwich doesn't get warm (despite them taking it to the back to be put on the grill for, like, ten minutes).  And I just lost interest."}
{"text":"Horrible service I bought food from them but they still wouldn't let me seat inside the restaurant."}
{"text":"Its expensive and not the best italian food I've ever had. But its by my work and i'll go for lunch when i feel for lasagne.

Their desserts are actually better than the food. They bake red velvet cupcakes everyday...which is actually pretty handy on a monday afternoon :)"}
{"text":"Who would think you can great an Italian meal in an indoor mall? Well, this restaurant is right up there with good Italian food. Ordered their seafood insalata and side of provolone. Friends ordered pasta dishes and salads along with a great meatball sandwich. We were delighted with our meal and bottle of wine. This place is packed and their service may be a little slow due to the limited seating and staff. But it is well worth the price, value and taste! Mmmm Tutto Bene!! Bella Sera! Mange!"}
{"text":"On a Saturday evening at bay and bloor probably the best thing I tried was Sccacia. We ordered spinach and veal and vegies with ricotta. 6.75 each. It is not enough for an empty stomach but I loved the taste, specially thee veggies and ricotta. Very neat,  lots of cheese, crunchy bread. It was a very delicious small bite,  with good quality. I will try it again definitely.

They have pasta too, no comments on their other foods for now."}
{"text":"Not surprised to read some of the comments about how the front of house girls should be fired. I was just ogled and made fun of by the kitchen staff (as though I can't see them in the open planned kitchen). When I told the lady at the cash that the kitchen staff is making customers feel uncomfortable, she laughed at me an said I'm being ridiculous and silly. 
Will never be going there again. It's like going to a 22 year old club with a bunch of rude and condescending people."}
{"text":"If you find yourself in the Manulife center looking for something substantial to eat on a budget, perhaps before a movie, I'd consider Scaccia a good option. They offer a wide selection of Italian food and everything I've had has been good/passable and a great option for the price.

It's nothing I'd go out of my way for, but considering how many overpriced options there are in the area, I think Scaccia offers better quality for price then some of the nearby options."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my mom,  Scaccia is the only restaurant in the immediate vicinity of the building.  They got their express section for patrons who are looking for food on-the-go rather than dine in.  Luckily we came here just before prime lunch time as the tables started to fill up with office employees.
Scaccia usually has daily specials but in this case we both decided to try their scaccia (aka pizza dough sandwich) which is what they're known for. 

**Spinach and veal scaccia served with salad

**Sausage scaccia served with salad: Presentation was bang on, served with a homemade vinaigrette to compliment the salad, the sausage scaccia was quite delicious! chunks of sausage packed in between two slices of pizza dough topped off with a tangy sauce to give the overall dish a kick. 

overall their prices are okay, however when in Yorkville, comes to no surprise."}
{"text":"Not exactly a catchy name...  But more importantly; The lasagna (all I have had) is very good; nice portions, reasonable prices and they are smart; hire attractive staff!!  Plus they are helpful and fast.
Great find in the basement of manulife.
Worth checking out."}
{"text":"Location is great because it is quite close to work for me but I wish there were more things about Scaccia to win me over. 

I'm a little weary about the desserts, they have a large selection of desserts at the take out counter, do you think they are made fresh daily? no! I work early mornings, so I usually walk the under groud and pass by Scaccia just before 7am and I see the same desserts and paninies sitting there from the night before and I see those same desserts again being served at lunch. Some of the stuff like cheesecake I know it doesn't get made daily but the panini? come on I don't want to see that! 

I usually only get the soup from here if I go which is usually pretty tasty but over priced.  A lot of my co-workers come here too and most of them say the pasta is not bad put not worth the price. I try to avoid this place but when i'm feeling like a baller sometimes i get the soup!"}
{"text":"I've always strolled by this place whenever I'm in the basement of the Manulife Center and I finally had a proper chance to eat from here last week with a movie buddy. This is not a bad place if can afford to pay a couple of $10s to fill up your stomach before a film.
My buddy got the beef lasagne which comes with a plain (maybe somewhat garlic flavored) roll and a really good pool of tomato sauce underneath. 
I decided on the restaurant's namesake a Panini-type looking baked stuffed pizza dough with a filling of spinach and veal. And there a couple of other fillings to choose from. I thought that the half square of it didn't look like much but it actually filled me up after a few bites. 
I also dipped a portion of the Scaccia into my buddy's tomato sauce and the flavor was all the more better. 
I also had a small dessert of some sort and he also had one. I think it was a pecan tart of some kind and my friend has a cookie. My tart was tasty enough that I finished it and it just closed up the last few inches of my stomach after the toasted sandwich :-)

All in all the displays of pleasantly looking hot dishes and the choice selection of baked goods are enough to give this place a try, and for some reason that Tuesday evening, the food from Scaccia made my movie watching a much better experience.
It's definitely worth an occasional visit before watching one of the Independent/Art style films shown at Varsity cineplex."}
{"text":"This was another pleasant surprise,  given that they have an express take out area adjoining the main dining room.  There are not much choices in this Manulife building,  so if you are in the area,  this place is not that bad.  We ordered the Carbonara and the grilled chicken with pesto pizza.  It was decent,  but for the price,  I could have gone elsewhere.  Maybe for lunch or takeout,  it's better than paying the price for the main dining.  Service was good though,  servers were very attentive. Would try the express next time."}
{"text":"Visited here before going to a screening at Varsity Cinemas.

Had the Vegetarian 'Scaccia'.  Apparently their signature dish and \"A variety of delicious ingredient combinations placed between two layers of pizza dough then oven baked\"

I would describe the 'ingredient combinations' on my 'Scaccia' as having tasting notes of 'office' and 'depression'.  Pretty bland and flavourless, and it tasted like it had been sitting in a fridge all day and then reheated quickly in an oven.  Which was actually the other problem.

The 'Scaccia' was ice cold in the middle.  So much so that it was such an unpleasant taste that I brought it back to the counter.  Like eating a cheese and frozen vegetable popsicle.  (My partner was eating the Chicken version and had the same experience)

I brought it to the counter staffs attention, and she seemed pretty non-plused with a 'this seems to happen a lot for some reason', and then put the half eaten 'Scaccia' back in the oven.  I don't have my food handlers certificate, but I'm pretty sure that's a health code violation or two.

When the sandwich was warmed properly, it tasted like dried out pizza crust with a flavourless goop inside.  I'd honestly recommend Subway over this place for an office lunch break, and that's a depressing condemnation."}
{"text":"I hesitated a few times before going to this place because it looked a bit too expensive for lunch.  I eventually caved... a couple of times actually because I work in the building and it was just convenient.

The place looks promising, with it's fancy decor and sometimes a bit of a line-up.  I tried this place 3 times before rating and I just think it's a bit over-rated IMO.  

I've tried their penne with tomato sauce, fancy chicken and tomato sandwich (which I can't remember the actual name for), and lasagna.   Their pasta and lasagna is nothing spectacular, and maybe it's because they're trying to go for authentic, but it's just boring.  I liked their chicken sandwich though, very good.

I'd like to come back sometime to try another sandwich and possibly their desert, but for now I am going to give them 3 stars."}
{"text":"I went here because I was looking for something good to go and I didn't feel like eating the usual hot counter foods from the grocery store across from it. I got carbonara and for some reason I got penne pasta instead of the linguine that it usually comes with. The wait was also annoying and they don't seem to have a rational system for takeout with people just standing around. The front staff were indifferent. 

Anyway the food was not worth the wait or price at all. For 13 dollars I was paying for a heart attack that came in the form of salty over sauced pasta and a lot of bacon bits with some mushrooms. There was way more sauce than pasta with the penne swimming in it, and my guess would be they ran out of linguine and just decided to dump the sauce on some leftover penne. Disgustingly salty but edible and I was hungry so I ate it except for the plentiful bacon bits. Would not recommend this place at all!!!"}
{"text":"Meh, it seems hit or miss.  I've had the lasagna there and it was good, but then tried the Carbonara and it was very Canadianized (they used a cream sauce).  Worst part was the fake Parmesan cheese that was lathered over top of the pasta - that just spoiled the whole thing.  It does look like they have some nice desserts and salads."}
{"text":"This place has changed a lot. It used to be good.
 I am really not impressed by the cooking or the service. They should just stick to desserts!"}
{"text":"Insipidly pointless flavours.  Characterless tomato sauce, over cooked pasta, and 'fresh' rolls chewier then toffee

Don't. Just don't."}
{"text":"I never tried the pasta, but I love the scaccia. Such a great idea,    I love sicilian food! I always get the one with chicken and a ton of spinach, so juicy and fresh! My son tried the lasagna once, he liked it, it looked very rich, with a lot of cheese on top."}
{"text":"Made lunch reservations a couple days in advance for a party of 10+. Had to call a couple hours later to update the number of people. Told the person it was to update the people count but she kept asking for an updated phone number. The call was quite unpleasant as she was starting to sound impatient but kept mistaking the reason for the call. On the day of, headed to the restaurant which has a counter outside  for takeout orders. Inside the back, there is a seating area for sit down meals.

Was a little excited at the sight of buns moving towards the table, maybe it was the hunger. It was quite disappointing to grab one just to realize they were cold. Already imagined buttering and biting into soft warm bread, hunger makes people a little crazy. Ordered the Frutti Di Mare because the description on the menu looked too good to pass. It came with a bunch of calamari, four tiger shrimps and a single solo scallop on top of a large bed of spaghetti. The pasta arrived warm and under seasoned, tasted bland. Also, the scallop was a bit overcooked.

Overall, decent Italian food and pasta. Was told by a coworker that takeout portions would be a bit smaller but less expensive so that's something to consider."}
{"text":"I picked up some Tiramisu to go from the takeout counter of this restaurant.  I really like this place because everything tastes authentically Italian.  The Tiramisu was perfect.  Light and perfect balance of coffee flavour and alcohol.  The real deal.  As good as if i made it myself.  I will get it again next time im craving dessert after a movie."}
{"text":"Ahh, Scaccia - my default \"pasta lunch\" location for the past half a year...

A tad bit on the pricey side for a lunch, you can slash the price by not getting any drinks. And the pasta is delicious, really well made. One step above the typical lunch location quality, I won't hesitate to check this place as an actual restaurant.

However, there are little nasty drawbacks here and there which drop the value of the place. For example, I've seen a person cutting those scaccias, dropping a knife on the floor, picking it up and continuing the job. Tossing out the thrash can, and keeping on wrapping food with those same hands (no gloves).

There is also a strange amount of drama constantly present at the counter - folks on the other side always look sort of annoyed, absentminded, clashing between themselves, throwing food on the table and cursing... This is besides being kicked out from the dining room if you bought a food for take away. Earning their tips, aha...

Yet, I was returning for the take out again and again - because the food was generally fast, and almost always of an excellent quality. Except for a couple of burnt lasagnas, but oh well.

If you are working around the Bay and Bloor buildings and feel like a quick pasta lunch - please check them out. Just pay attention to what happens to your food on its way to your little brown bag."}
