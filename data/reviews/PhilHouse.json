{"text":"The food is great, but every item that I order they charge $1 extra when it is already suppose to be a meal deal?!? What surprised me is the Tortang Talong it's $1.50 more, its too much!"}
{"text":"Two points:
1) Be careful ordering anything that looks OLD or leftover from yesterday, because it is a guaranteed upset stomach or worse, diarrhea.  I have experienced this twice already including a friend of mine.  Items such as pinakbet and kare-kare are notorious to be some of these.

2) It is OVERPRICED.  As some already pointed out, the combo items are misleading.  Any item will upsell you as much as $1.00 up to $2.00 more.  This is specially apparent when a server is very good at upselling you items that will cost you \"extra.\"

Stay smart with your dollars.  Just because it's Filipino does not mean you should pay more or extra.  You can get popular Filipino dishes from other places that are tastier, like Kusina ni Lorraine, for a lot less-- and more importantly not have an upset stomach."}
{"text":"We placed a order at 10am for a party pan to be ready at 430 we came at 445 and here I am at 745pm still waiting for it. What was the point of me calling ahead of time"}
{"text":"Hidden gem inside Island Pacific. The food is on point and the price is even more on point. Feed your whole family some delicious Filipino food for $25. Ever since the first time we got dinner here it's become a weekly thing. They are always putting fresh trays of food out and nothing has ever tasted like it just sits around. I wish they had their shanghai lumpia out all the time because it's hella good, but we've only been able to catch it there once so far. Definitely check this spot out if you're craving Filipino!"}
{"text":"Delicious Filipino food, buffet style. Decent prices. It's situated inside the store. Halo halos are the best."}
{"text":"Glad they are just around the corner. The one item combo is one of the best values in town. I always get the pun-set, with a beef curry. The veggie patty is also really good and so is the BBQ chicken. Clean market with hot food service for take out."}
{"text":"Best Lechon Kawali I've had!!  Crispy, golden brown exterior. Juicy, moist and tender, with even ratio of meat and fat.  When you take a bite it's never been hard or chewy. Every time I've come here it's been soooo good!

The set up is buffet style in serving trays, you go down the line and point to what you want to order aka Turo Turo (point point)  I'll be honest, not fan of this but seems like pretty high turn over rate. This location is always busy. Been there when skewers sold out, (waaah)  So you know the lechon nor the bbq skewers have been under heat lamps very long.

The bbq pork skewers are my other fave. It's fatty, juicy, pork. The marinade taste fruit based, like pineapple.  Ma sarap!

There's also meal combos you can order and there is seating but, it's cramped and everyone is on top of each other. 

The staff here is really nice and very polite!  Service is great! They understand my Taglish ..lol...Plus they are super generous with the servings.  I ordered the small container of pancit, it was overflowing when  they packed that container. The times Ive been here, it was sanitary and food was hot.

Organized chaos the first two weeks, but wait in long line went pretty quick. Plus they came thru for me for two very large orders I had for a Super Bowl party, and a last minute dinner party.  My guests raved about my Filipino cooking. JK..I gave the Phil House credit. And the price 13$ per lb for the Lechon Kawali is in line with other places that sell it. So driving here, is a no brainer since it's quicker drive from Henderson."}
{"text":"this place was amazing! the food was great, i don't recommend the sisig though (they add sweet and sour sauce to it, i'm more a traditional sisig eater!). the lechon kawali was crispy, the pork bbq was juicy, and the kare-kare did not need any bagoong. 

my favorite part was the price and portions! i paid $20 for two large combos and a side of barbecue. it fed four people comfortably.

i recommend eating here, especially since you get to walk around island pacific afterwords!"}
{"text":"Sisig, lechon and dinuguan is what I was craving for...they have it all
What a great selection of food?
It's a to go place like most...I bet you won't be disappointed 
Try this place out...you gonna love it"}
{"text":"The staff here is so generous and very accommodating to the patrons. I asked for Pancit...and almost had to ask them to stop scooping lol. And their serving area is extremely clean!"}
{"text":"Fantastic service! We've been here in LV for a month now and we're all craving for Filipino food. Everything here is delicious! Everyone must try their dinuguan and chicharon."}
{"text":"I don't know if it's a good thing or a bad thing that Phil House is just a few minutes away from me. LOL! When I'm too lazy to cook (which often happens) and I'm craving for Filipino food, I come here! I really like their pork adobo, beef steak and lechon kawali with extra Mg Tomas sauce. I've only had their halo-halo once and it was also really good! All of their staff are really friendly as well especially the gentleman with glasses. I don't know his name but he used to work at DJ Bibingkahan! This is now my new favorite \"turu-turo\" style restaurant."}
{"text":"Came to visit the market a couple of times and every time I tell my self next time I have to try the food.  Today I finally did!  Came in and a woman helped me out by explaining how to order.  I got the two choice combo which comes with rice.  For my first choice I got dinaguan and second was pancit.  She asked if I want to do the rice and pancit half and half so that way I still have two choices.  I said awesome!!! My second choice was the pinakbet (I think that's how you spell it lol) and she asked if I wanted soup I could choose chicken or beef which I chose chicken.  All this I got to go.

Got home and opened up the plate and WOW!!!!! She filled the plate with pancit!! Everything was great from the customer service, the food, and the cleanliness of the food area and dinning area!"}
{"text":"Craved morning Filipino food again but they stopped serving breakfast food at 12PM. 

As a back up, I ordered 3 chicken bbq skewers and some Shanghai lumpia. They do 10 pieces of Shanghai lump for $3. The chicken was quite dry. It was confirmed after my friend offered to let me try some of the food he ordered from a nearby Filipino restaurant down the street. The restaurant down the street offered barbecue chicken with way more flavour, sauce, and was less dry."}
{"text":"Filipino food is on the up and up in the American foodie scene. With all the fusion dishes out there and ube this and ube that, sometimes you just want to enjoy Filipino food dishes done traditionally and prepared in a grocery store's kitchen because you are just too lazy to cook and never really learned how to do things right. That's where Philhouse comes in for me. They are a great \"turo turo\" option for Filipino food - where dishes are already made, sitting in hot plate and you \"point point\" to what you would like to eat. You can either order combos (comes with rice or pancit) or do entree sized items. They also have a wide array or heart-attack inducing fried and crunchy goodness towards the end of the ordering area where you can get fried chicken skin, chicharon, jeprox (fried fish), etc. Out of their main dishes, I personally enjoy the menudo (cause I love the hot dogs in it) and the bistek (the meat is usually pretty tender and drowning in delicious sauce). Hipsters beware, I wouldn't introduce someone to Filipino food to this place, but if you do, the workers speak both English and Tagalog and can help you find something you might like."}
{"text":"My favorite spot for Filipino food when I'm in need of those home cooked meals. Low prices for some great quality food!"}
{"text":"This place have a best service .All the employees always smile. Good customer service."}
{"text":"It's so good we just can't get enough we love it here we get diniguan menudo beef stew it's delicious ooo and don't forget the halo halo"}
{"text":"I love love love our location it's just  .41 miles from where I live. Love the staff. My bf and I loves the food. I wish Philhouse have their own PH number though."}
{"text":"Great place to go to if you don't want to cook on your day off. I had inihaw na pampano & lechon kawali. It was good. But what made an impression was their Taho which is available in the bakery. Definitely met my craving for Taho!"}
{"text":"Very good flavor and nice worker's. Trust what I say. Go enjoy the flavors. I love this food and I have been twice. I even got my husband to eat some and he does not any food other than beef, fried chicken or potatoes."}
{"text":"Had this for the first time today and it was good. Was craving for some pancit and that's what I ordered. Di hamak, si kuya ng kumuha ng order ko gave me a pretty good helping of pancit with my barbecue but the price...for the grill combo...hay naku! Ok I added some halo-halo, pero still...Sarap, pero mahal ng konti."}
{"text":"This place sucks. I thought I'd give them a few chances and see if they'd do me better during a different occasion but of course not. They always make me wait for at least 15-20 minutes after I arrive to pick up an order. This time, I arrived about 20 minutes later than pick up time, and still had to wait for another 15 minutes. We called before picking up the order, they gave us a total. Once we got there, the total was $12.53 more. Asked why, they answer me back with no concern and no resolution. \"That's what I told him.\" Basically. So where'd this random total come from?? In addition, they said that the order would come with something included. The lady who wheeled out the order said they ran out of the item, but I could clearly see a whole large tray of that item right at the register. Don't say you'll include the item if you don't have it or can't substitute it. Their food is mediocre. They don't even give a decent amount of food for what you pay. I'm going to recommend everyone I know to not go to this place. Ask your parents, titas, and titos to help you cook Filipino food. Or heck, learn it yourself."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times & all experiences have been consistent. 

It's turo-turo style (point-point) where you tell/point to the item(s) that you want & pay at the end.   The name of the concept is from the Philippines. I didn't make it up! =)

[ PROS ]

* Food is already prepared, so service is quick

* Prices are reasonable - $7.25 for 2 item combo

* Serving sizes are big

* They have a lot of choices

* You can choose between rice or pancit, or half & half... and again, serving size is huge! The pancit alone can be a meal itself (and I'm not exaggerating)

* Staff & Manager are friendly 

* Bicol Express is deeeelish!

* Binagoongang Baboy (Pork with Bagoong) was actually really good. A lot of fat, but very tasty


[ CONS ]

* Tables are limited. When they're busy, you may have to wait for a table

* Dinuguan, Kare-Kare are a bit bland (for my taste buds anyway)

* Pancit is a bit dry


I'll definitely be a regular here tho.. there's still so many other items to try!"}
{"text":"Maybe one of the most forgetful Filipino food I habe had. Ordered grilled squid, chicharon bulaklak, a goat dish and melon juice. To call it a juice is being generous. For $3 it is pricey. It has maybe a drop of juice and cup full of ice. Goat dish was meh. Chicharon was not crispy and oily. Squid is dry. They even forgot to give vinegar for the chicharon."}
{"text":"Still giving three stars as they are really friendly here and I haven't tried enough to really know how I feel. First time coming here today and I got a small pancit palabok and large sweet spaghetti. I will say the portions are big here they FILL the containers up! I also got cantaloupe juice which was a bit pricey but it was good. The pancit palabok was meh it just a step above bland seemed maybe it was cheaply made they used spaghetti noodles and there was only ground beef I like my palabok with shrimp and lechon or at least crushed chicaron so I was pretty disappointed with this one. The spaghetti was kind of the same thing not completely plain but the flavor wasn't all there also there was little to no meet or hotdog no cheese either. I will be trying this place out again want to try their dinuguan, bangus, and pork belly hopefully it will make up!"}
{"text":"Went to a party at a friend's house and they had a full spread of filipino food from Philhouse. Made my way around and took a little of everything, MAN it was good! Made another round and even took some home. About a week later I go to Philhouse for dinner with the fam... This might be a weekly thing for me!"}
{"text":"If you're craving for delicious, homemade-style Filipino cuisine, then PhilHouse is the place to go (in Spring Valley). When an establishment has owners and employees that care, it shows not only in the quality of the food but also throughout the overall dining experience. Yes, the place is laid out 'turo-turo' style (point out what you want) with very minimal human interaction, but every single time we come in for a Filipino food fix, we are always met with pleasant and friendly folks behind the counter eager to serve up the freshly prepared dishes. PhilHouse also has a grill area that offers pork belly lechon, barbecue and other grilled meats and fish that compliment the wide variety of dishes served up daily like laing, kare-kare, dinuguan, lumpia, okoy, pancit palabok, sisig, grilled bangus pork/chicken bbq and many more to mention. Also, don't forget to try their breakfast menu for that oh-so-good longsilog, spamsilog (yes, spam!), hotdogsilog or tapsilog which your food preparer is only too happy to pile on to your hungry plate! Lastly, PhilHouse is now one of our go-to places for party platters--the price is good, the quantity is ample and the taste is top notch. We ordered our platters and the awesome pork belly lechon from PhilHouse for our class reunion and everyone who sampled it enjoyed every morsel making the party's food offerings a success (thanks guys!). I do hope they never change!"}
{"text":"You know why the food here are so damn tasty? I found out that they put chicken broth, beef broth, sinigang mix and the notorious MSG Mono Sodium Glutamate. These are not good to our health. I got sick everytime I ate food with all this food enhancer. I rather eat healthy"}
{"text":"This place has a variety of different food and it has a really good price for the amount they give out!! Super good!!"}
{"text":"When I was picking up lunch at Teppan Bento one day, I was surprised to discover that Island Pacific has made their way down to Silverado Ranch. With it comes their food service area known as PhilHouse.

I've tried the PhilHouse at the Trop/Durango location and this one seems to be a mirror image. The food was about the same quality, which is to say that it's good -- about as good as you'd expect from a \"turo turo\" (literally means point point). It will usually depend on how long the food has been sitting there.

At lunch today, I ordered a 1-item combo for $5.95 with tax. I appreciated the lady giving me way too much rice and pancit for being just one item. I had plenty left to take home. I chose bopis as my one dish because it had just come out and tasted as good as it looked.

Anyway, I'm happy to have another lunch option somewhat close to work."}
{"text":"BS +++

Mabuhay!!! A lil Pinoy grocery store.  It's humble and very compact.  But this little guy has it all.  I got some ingredients for tinola and got myself crawfish and BALUT! WHAT! I'm ready for anything after that.  The parking lot is super pack but I got parking.  The carts was readily available.  The floor staff was helpful and spoke Tagalog.  I was even happy to see a Goldilocks  as soon as you walk in (ANG SARAP!) If you are looking for some quick turo-turo (point-point Pinoy cuisine) they also have a small area to pick up some quick food.  If you like a much crowded grocery then go here.  It's minutes away from Las Vegas BLVD.  I am visiting from NYC and I don't know a lot of blocks except S Rainbow and Blue Diamond hahahaha So I'll act like I live here.  But seriously this place has BALUT! so it's legit here!! 

So as soon as I got home I got excited to cook and to check out how fresh the meat and veggies are.  I was so excited that I was dancing the  whole time.  It's so good to use fresh ingredients to cook a soul warming meal.  While I waited for the chicken to cook me and my father-in-law ate the balutttttttttt!!!!!!! So good!!

Authenticity It's 100%
Food selection is BOMB
Food selection is FRESH
Restrooms I didn't check.
Lines at the cafeteria  NONE
Food In Cafeteria is OK.
Tables for the food area are CLEAN
Customer service is GREAT
Cashier lines NONE
Cashiers are Fast and Funny
Ambiance is like Albertsons
Aisles are Organize
Balut is SOOOOOO SARAP (good)

{"text":"Large portions of food the breakfast $4.99 platter was big enough for lunch and dinner.
Variety is quite large to choose from, food was tasty not greasy as most Filipino places cook it"}
{"text":"Came here with my brothers and sister in law. When you're with family, you eat. The portions were a good slice and you pick either 1, 2, or 3 dishes did the combinations. I only picked one, but still got two scoops of rice, which is a lot for me. They had a lot of fried goodies as well, but I didn't have any."}
{"text":"2016 Yelp 100 Review Challenge 68/100

This quick serve Filipino restaurant is located within Island Pacific Seafood Market so I didn't have any expectations, I thought it would be like Grill City at Seafood City, but boy was I wrong! 

I was pleasantly surprised to like everything I tried here! Okay don't shoot me, but I'm not a fan of Lechon. Usually, especially the ones made here in Vegas, the skin is too hard to chew, tons of fat, oily and gross. BUT PhilHouse's Lechon was delicious! I LOVED IT. The skin was crispy and NOT hard at all. The meat was juicy (yes, oily too) and there was more pork meat than fat. It was my favorite dish out of everything I tried here. I wish I ordered some to go. I heard they make their lechon fresh daily. It sure seems like it. 

I also got the sinigang, which was delicious. Tastes like my mom's and aunts. Not too salty. Perfect for this freezing cold weather too. Would've preferred shrimp over pork though. We also got pinakbet and another oily pork dish, I forgot the name. Those were pretty good and made better than some other places in town. 

Oh and the kind lady that helped us was amazing, so friendly. There wasn't a long line when we got there but when we left the long line for dinner started to form. I really liked this place and will be back to try other items!

** TIP: The hours posted on here are wrong (\"closed at 5pm\"), still open as of 6pm. No hours listed at door or receipt, assuming they stay open as long as Island Pacific Market is open 10pm.

** Also check out the Bread Republic bakery to the side, to get fresh out of the oven Pan De Sal and Ube or Buko Pandan Cupcake with Flan! SO GOOD!"}
{"text":"Check your receipt when you pay, they added $0.75 for making my food ToGo, not my fault because I told the lady from the start when I was ordering, then when I was paying I noticed they are not wrapping it, so I said \"that's for ToGo\" then when I checked my receipt as I was walking away there's that extra charge. 
Then today same thing happened, I asked for a combo and the lady taking the order made a mistake and she puts the 2nd viand/dish \"ulam\" in a bigger container, so she told me that it won't be full because it's a bigger container, I said ok. After I pay, I checked my receipt and there's that $.75 again!!! Mind you, they don't tell you that you're getting that extra charge... and for something that is not my mistake. 
Did not go back anymore to question that extra charge, anyways, it's just $.75, but they won't get me the third time! Or probably won't buy from here anymore. 

Do not order the Kare kare, the meat is an unknown parts, it's like left over from the other dish, it was so hard to chew also. I think because it is covered with the peanut/yellow sauce that they think they can fool you."}
{"text":"Largest selection of Filipino food I have seen in Las Vegas, and everything that I have had has been good."}
{"text":"The traditional dishes are fairly good and tasty.  However, I don't recommend the bbq pork on skewers.  They were very tough and chewy.  The chicken version was just so so.  They do have a lot of variety so points for that."}
{"text":"So I went to this new location in Henderson called Island Pacific which they usually have in Tropicana the location is big as well as their restaurant PhilHouse, the price is affordable for a filipino food and ot makes you feel like home! It is spacious and staff was good. I met Sol that I would like to give credit for, she is our server and she's friendly and accomodating. Definitely will come back and bring more friends to introduce the food that i grew up into."}
{"text":"Sol of Phil house in silverado ranch is great and always providing very good customer service. Always giving her sweetest smile even at busy times."}

Everything we ordered was delicious!
We came in close their closing time and they were very generous with the portions they gave us with some freebies to go. 
The servers were very kind and attentive to our needs!"}

{"text":"I was craving Filipino food and decided to pick up lunch. I ordered rice, chicken skewers and the beef stew (I apologize for not getting the Filipino names for these dishes). Both the beef and chicken were really tough, not dry but tough. I was disappointed because the taste was there but it was just too tough to enjoy."}

Febz and Jules are awesome!
Great food!

{"text":"Great hot quality food at your convenience! Plenty of options and they give you good quantity. Staffs are friendly and helpful, the only downside is the lack of place to eat. We always end up ordering to go!"}
{"text":"Went for the breakfast. Tapa, Eggplant Torta (fried in egg batter) and Filipino garlic rice. Yum. All was delicious. Would be giving a 5 star, but worker by the name of \"Jewels\", not sure of spelling because she had no visible name tag. Anyways, she was so sassy and angry and seemed unhappy to work there or help us. I know I will be back cause the food was good. To the Manager of this place if you are reading this, please try to correct this, customer service is crucial, at least give us a fake smile. LOL."}
