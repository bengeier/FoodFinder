{"text":"Ambience is decent, staff is friendly, pizza is great! I have been an occasional visitor to this spot for years, and would suggest trying their wings or meatball sliders. Kitchen is open until 11pm, and half off bottles of wine on Wednesday. Most recently my GF and I sat in the dining room, and \"built\" our own pizza with Italian sausage, pepperoni and green peppers, we ordered a second to take home with us!"}
{"text":"This is a pretty cool little pizza place to come have a beer and watch a game in the bar room on one of their many flat screen TVs. They have a good happy hour 3-7. Their pizza is ok. The boneless wings are pretty bad. Nothing you would find at a Buffalo Wild Wings. The rest of the food is pretty good tho"}
{"text":"This place used to be good, but with lazy wait service and inattentive management things have inevitably declined."}
{"text":"My niece and her baby girl were in town and she eats at Upper Crust in Nm.  I was not impressed; the waiter took our order via text which basically meant no personality just a person looking at his cell phone.

He also repeatedly put our HOT dishes within reach of the baby in a high chair putting her at risk to be burned.  He was not personable at all!!

However the food was decent; not fantastic and for the price plus the annoying lack of personality and experience I'd rather not go back.

Also why have high chairs but no kids menu? we paid for an entire order of noodles with butter ( about 5 noodles eaten by the baby); I just think for a \"family style\" serving restaurant they should be more family friendly.

In an age where everyone is on their cell phone and disconnected most families go out to dinner to have an experience.  This was just another disconnected moment in our lives and should have been an easy relaxing time to catch up with our family."}
{"text":"The owner contacted me to assure me that they have maintained their high quality of food and recipes (which I certainly agree is top notch) and are working on the proper training of their staff. He asked for another chance at our business, which we will do. I appreciate him reaching out and caring about our community, we need more of this and less of the chain restaurants. I'll update when we get a chance to eat there again."}
{"text":"Arrived to pick up to go order,  it was screwed up. Manager totally took care of it.   Remade and comped:)   Good job taking care of the customer !"}
{"text":"Came by here for the first time to get take out on a tight time frame. Awesome! I wasn't sure if it would be good, you never know, but we were pleasantly surprised!! 

We headed inside to the bar to place a takeout order. We only had 15 minutes. 

In 15 min, they made honey BBQ wings, pizza, Stromboli, two salads, fried mozzarella & cheesecake in that time frame. They were super fast and their sauce is excellent. The fried cheese is in pizza dough. 

The salads were excellent - they were just house salads but had marinated red peppers, mushrooms, onion, tomatoes and olives. The dressing is awesome. 

Pizza is thin crusted and crispy - we got 1/2 cheese and 1/2 pepperoni. It may be not the kind your kids  like but it's very, very good! I would come here over 
The service was fast, prices good and service is very nice. A+"}
{"text":"Dear uppercrust management,

The last two times I've been in for pizza the service was lacking despite the dining area being quite slow.(waiting more than 15 minutes for a beer that I ordered was disappointing)  The lounge always seems like it's doing a good business and your attention is focused there instead being spread throughout the restaurant.  

It seems to get good service I'll have to leave the kids at home since they're not allowed in the bar area."}
{"text":"My only issue here is the music is too loud at times.  In the dining area I have been able to get it turned down.  No getting it turned down in the bar area.  I always come here for their pizza.  About as good as it gets anywhere in Phoenix.  Did have one time when they overcooked it and it was just OK.  Only reason it only gets 4 stars from me."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. We went to the patio first. No one wanted to clear the table we were at let alone take a drink order. So we went inside stood at the hostess stand for 7
 minutes with them all fighting over who would NOT take the table. We left good riddens."}
{"text":"I've been at least 5 times and I will continue to go back. We usually order a pepperoni pizza with ricotta and wings. Ingredients are quality and togo orders are quick. Bar is nice and usually pretty packed on Friday and Saturdays. Lunch menu is cheap 8inch cheese pizza and salad for $6! I highly recommend giving them a try."}
{"text":"I love Upper Crust Pizza and Wine Bar!  The food is fabulous and the staff is friendly.  It's a great place to meet for Happy Hour or to have a nice family dinner. I love their pizza but their calzones and pasta dishes are awesome as well!  Great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I'm being generous and giving this 4 stars...reason being service. My bartender was NOT FRIENDLY.  Smile. Interact. Speak. Anything she said she sounded annoyed and like it was forced. I felt like I was a nuisance to her. Maybe it was just her personality (or lack thereof) or maybe she was having a bad day. But it felt very tense and uncomfortable. If you don't like your job, quit. Find one you like. Life is too short. And if you're not a friendly person by nature, stay the hell out of the hospitality industry and certainly don't bartend. All you're gonna do is spread around your miserable attitude and bring down the morale/reputation of the place. 

With that said, the food was good. And everyone else was super friendly and accommodating. 

Rant over :)"}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza by far in the North Phoenix area!  We take the kids here for dinner and never worry about them being too loud. Great for take out too!"}
{"text":"I just moved into the area and I ve tried the food a few times and it's great no complaints at all about the food. Just one teenie winnie problem. .. EVERYONE that works here besides one kinda shorter white guy.. felt bad to say everyone for one second. Anywho everyone is just miserable and assholes for some reason it's awful and who I really feel bad for is the owner bc I'm sure he's loosing so much money bc of this awful staff bc his foods good sadly and I'm n hospitality and my fiance is a chef at the boulders and our dream would be to own a restaurant and we would know how to treat our guests so it's all sad. So I would get it to go they make u feel like ur bothering them being there and it's so awkward when ur the one kissing ass and being pleasant.  No personality and ruin an outing so good luck owner.."}
{"text":"The pizza is excellent. I had a thin crust pie with amazing sausage, sun dried tomatoes and cheese! This is a wonderful place to get great food and a cold beer.  They had Left Hand Milk Stout and 90 Shilling on tap which is always a plus.  Prices are very reasonable, and there are literally dozens of TVs to watch any game that is on...  The staff was very attentive and friendly.  Can't wait until it warms up a bit so I can sit out on their nice patio."}
{"text":"Food was tasty, This place has a great wine and beer selection. It has anchor stream on tap. Menu needs expansion though. I would like to see pre made combos on the pizza menu and a kids menu. I think this place has potential though if it expands its menu as the pizzas are excellent."}
{"text":"i went to this place expecting very little, we would always drive by and it looked like no one was really there. But this particular Friday night, the lot was full. I had never seen the patio in front but as we walked by, i saw it had great, loungy outdoor patio furniture. Both tables to eat at and couches to chill on. It was already full by 6 pm though. 

it had been a long day at a spring training game, so i was reluctant about going out in the first place. But this place exceeded my expectations ten-fold. Its minimally decorated with dark walls and several TVs that all had some sports. There was a nice sized 21+ lounge that we did not see but looked very fun. We were seated and served immediately.They brought out pizza dough for my son to play with, and the service was so spot on and FAST! The food...OH MY this was the best part... so fresh and amazing, and our server Matthew was very knowledgable. He reccomended fresh salami for my caprese salad which was great. We also ordered a small (if small is 16 inches!!!) cheese pizza. It was margherita style and they make the mozzerella for the salad and pizza fresh on location. Very thin, fresh crust, but not too crunchy. The wings were the best part. I am sure this chicken has never been frozen, and not to fatty or oversauced. Speaking of sauce, they have 8 different ones to chose from. I love wings and i am tempted to say these were the best ever.

It was midrange in price, $55 for pizza, wings, salad, beer, wine, a lemonade, & tip. More than i was expecting but i also didnt go into it knowing it was family style. The tables are a little small, and they have no kids menu, but overall I am very excited this place is in my neighborhood. Definitely coming back for date night."}
{"text":"Recently relocated to the area. We found this place when a friendly new neighbor recommended it. Great Happy Hour specials!  The bar is best and doesn't allow screaming kids. Nice to go out and eat without kids running wild."}
{"text":"Place is so cool!  The waiters look like theyre using their cell phones yet theyre actually placing your order on phones. Our drinks arrived while our waiter was still taking our order. Now that's impressive! Awesome food as well and good pricing!"}
{"text":"AMAZING place for the perfect dinner! The food is absolutely delicious and the staff is incredible and super fun! If you get Nikki as a waitress you're in for a huge treat! By far one of the best places I've ever been and I can't wait to return! :)"}
{"text":"Really nice place to eat pizza. Friendly staff, very knowledgeable. Atmosphere is very relaxing. Pizza is very good. But this place can get pricey. I will be coming back with family and friends."}
{"text":"OMG! Their pizza is off the hook delicious.  Everything about it...perfection!  1st time here today and definitely not our last. Atmosphere is chill and relaxing."}
{"text":"We had a coupon so that's what lead us to Upper Crust in the first place. 

We ended up sitting at the bar during happy hour on a Thursday night. The two guys behind the bar are really what ruined our experience. They weren't very friendly and were somewhat abrasive.

The Caprese Salad was excellent! We loved it. The pizza was also very good. Not my favorite pizza in the valley, but it was definitely better than average.

Their patio looks quite nice, but it was too hot for us to sit outside. I'd like to go again when the weather cools off. The bar has a bunch of TVs and would be a great place to watch a game. This place does have potential so I think we'll try them again this fall."}
{"text":"The pizza is great, the staff is friendly, and the happy hour specials are awesome!  

I've only eaten in the lounge, never in the restaurant.  It's great place to watch a game and grab some grub.  I've been here probably 10 times and the food/service has been consistently good.  Definitely recommend the pizza and the wings.  I'm not one of those crazy \"I know everything about the best pizza\" people, but the crust is thin with great texture, the toppings are good, and the CHEESE...Mmmmm....

There's lots of places to meet up with friends, grab a drink, and watch a game.  The food here makes this place better than most.  No more settling for \"freezer to frier\" bar food.  Their food will keep you coming back."}
{"text":"One of the main reasons why we keep coming here is for the server Joe! The food is 5/5 stars for sure, but servers like Joe make the atmosphere enjoyable. His recommendations for wine, beer, and food have never led us astray! He is personable and a great server!"}
{"text":"I've only been here once but it was enjoyable. They did accommodate our group of about 25 people. Food was good. Don't really recall my veggie pizza being anything special.  Will go again."}
{"text":"When we go there, We start with Bruchetta, then we split a Full order of  Ravioli in Alfredo Sauce, and have a order of Focaccia WITH that. Topped off with a couple of Flourless Chocolate Cakes to go.  Costs about $65 with tip to do all that but OMG is it GREAT!

LOL, I'm drooling just writing about it.

Service has always been good too."}
{"text":"i had some issues at AT&T recently which required me to spend time in the shopping center in which Upper Crust is located. I decided to take some time and check out Upper Crust. I was stressed out and needed to regroup. I walked into the door and the immediate sense of calmness was in the air. I decided to have some food and beverages at the bar. 

The ambiance was  of being invited to a best friends house for dinner. Perfect lighting, perfect receiving, perfect welcome. I sat down and had the most incredible appetizer that was simply tomatoes covered with mozzarella cheese, oil and spices. WOW. I felt like I was in Italy! 

I left Upper Crust with a calm sense of the inevitable. Back to AT&T to finish my business in a peaceful state of mind. 

Thanks Upper Crust."}
{"text":"The last several times we've eaten here it's been more or less a disappointment. The quality of food has definitely gone down hill. (The service was never very good, and tonight was no different). Our server acted as if we were inconveniencing her by being there. The spinach dip was the highlight of the meal. The pizza was fairly soggy and the house salad was less than desirable- a small was, however, enough for two people to share. But we were charged a dollar for dressing?? Really? WTF?! I think we'll skip Upper Crust next time around...."}
{"text":"The food is really good! Don't complain about service or how long it takes to get water & a kids lemonade from Tammy, because she will come to your table and argue with you about it. Thank you to the gentleman who fixed the situation."}
{"text":"Who can beat half price bottles of wine on Wednesdays? The food is always delicious and good service. Bloody Marys are awesome too. I love the vibe of the place very cozy and upbeat."}
{"text":"Upper Crust has AMAZING fried mozzarella!! We always go for that to share for an app, a medium pizza, and a bottle of wine and four of us are STUFFED.  The crust is SO good to and the pizza is even good 3 days old in the microwave!"}
{"text":"Food here is great! Except I wouldn't recommend the calzone. Service is very good if you dine in. On 2 different experiences in the bar and take out, the staff was quite rude and unfriendly."}
{"text":"One star for awesome food. One star for amazing staff. Minus 3 stars for everything that could be better. I will never eat in the bar area, it's just loud, typical of a sports bar. The 'family seating' area is okay. Where it's at is the patio. However, despite many requests the owner won't improve it. 'Good enough' he says. For starters, the music outside is way too loud, especially if you're at the table right under the speaker. The lay out, is retarded, no other word for it. Very inefficient. Need much more individual seating. One person sits on a couch and now a 10x10ft section is occupied. The rock gardens, wtf??? Two giant wastes of space. Put a couch on it. Add more two person settings, use the umbrella stands to block the giant 500watt building halogens. Nothing like eating with a high beam in your face. The sort of Edison style hanging bulbs are great, if they were by themselves. If the building manager requires the halogens to be on, find a way around it, block them somehow. Then there's picky things like they don't enforce the 20ft smoking law, so you usually walk through a cloud of smoke while making your way to the patio. After all that though, omg the pizza is ridiculously amazing, and the staff are just awesome. And the tiramisu is to die for. But because of the epic fail that is their patio, I tend to only eat their food when I'm in the mood for take out, to avoid their entire restaurant atmosphere. If the owner fixed that, I'd probably be there twice a week."}
{"text":"Always a good meal!!!  The ingredients are fresh and they make their own mozzarella! The price is right for the great quality and quantity."}
{"text":"Where is management in this place?!!! Just the worst...employees taking up the whole bar, cursing up a storm, talking loudly about their personal lives. Went in around 7pm and already had an employee belly'd up to the bar taking up spots and bartenders time and attention. Just a bad experience all together. No personable people helping or waiting on you. Decor is antiquated and certainly doesn't live up to current pizza/wine bars. 

If that's not bad enough, food was way below average. Meatballs seemed frozen and put under a broiler with frozen mozzarella on top. On and on...

Save yourself the time and trouble and find another place. Trust me"}
{"text":"I was very  disappointed in the restaurant due  the fact that it was freezing  and couldn't enjoy my meal and told the waitress a few times to put up the heat. Won't be back"}
{"text":"So here's the thing usually I like this place I've been here 10 or so times. The last time I went here it was a pretty slow night.  during our dinner the server seemed pretty preoccupied with something in the kitchen.. We had to ask for extra sauce a few times but that's okay.. he was pretty understanding of my accomplice and I's particular taste in alcohol..
After our check came, and I left around a 25 percent tip we left. Long story short he ended up charging my card for the total amount of the dinner as his tip.(instead of charging 55.00 as the total he charged 99.00) Even the most competent server knows when their bank is off.  and if they don't, that is what you check when they tip out. Just a big inconveneince all around. 
Reading some of the other negative reviews I agree for the main part. The food is pretty good, a bit pricey but oh well. But the service staff could use some retraining. 
It will be awhile before I will be back... if ever."}
{"text":"Very excited to have another restaurant in the neighborhood.

Ate here last night with some friends. Pizza was very good but the wine is way over priced. 

$42 for a bottle of Petite Petite is crazy!  I don't think they can classify themselves as a wine bar.  The wine selection is not of wine bar quality and the atmosphere does not allow them to charge as much as they do for the wine.

I will go back for the pizza but will not make this my neighborhood wine stop."}
{"text":"This area has been starving for a fun, classy, tasty eatery. Upper Crust has answered the call.
The atmosphere is upscale and the food is delicious. There is a casual upscale dining side and a separate sports bar. There is a beautiful patio as well. The staff is attentive and the owners are approachable. I highly recommend Upper Crust for dine in, take out, or catering. We've done all three!!!!."}
{"text":"Yum!

Just had the wings here for the first time last weekend and I really don't think I've had better wings! They were soo good! Ordering them \"hot\" was just perfect!

Infact, the pizza and salad were just as amazing. I had friends next to me raving on the bread and meatballs they had ordered. 

We had a large group and the service was excellent. They were very friendly and were nice enough to inform us there would be 2 servers since it was Sunday and they like to tagteam if they are slow!"}
{"text":"Been here twice and thoroughly enjoyed the food and wide selection of drinks. Have to give it only 4 stars instead of 5 because we have had the same waitress both times and she is slow and doesn't check up on tables. Had to go to the bartender to ask for things a few times."}
{"text":"Their pizza is quite good. Real, delicious mozzarella cheese but a bit expensive @ $2 per additional ingredient on a large. That, plus the fact that the more relaxed inside dining room is 21 and over (even with supervision) are the only reasons this place gets 4 stars from me."}
{"text":"Hands down the worst service. Owner could care less and outside of Alan, no one in that restaurant cares about the customers. With way too many places to patronize and spend your money on average food, I'd suggest you venture elsewhere."}
{"text":"We've had the pizza from here a few times.  It's good when your order comes out correctly.  They are one for 4.  The last time we ate their one of the pizzas was supposed to be a white pizza and it had buffalo sauce on it.  How do they screw that up??  AND they didn't bother coming over to apologize, get us a new pizza or comp their screw up.  

We're sticking with Grimaldi's."}
{"text":"Review is for Lunch only.  We've had dinner here and regularly been pleased.  But the last 2 times for lunch, there have been order mishandling and errors that I'll spare the details of here.  The reason for 2 stars is that both times, management attitude has been policy over customer satisfaction.  I'm truly easy going, maybe that's the problem.   But each time I've talked to a manager, I've ended up paying full bill and walking out the door dissatisfied.

AVOID lunch!  Enjoy dinner here."}
{"text":"If you own this place leave me a contact number and I will donate my personal time to help you fix some of the issues that are causing your reviews to trend in a negative direction.  I have over 40 years of experience in the F&B industry, I love your concept but the consistency (food and service) needs help, I believe in locally owned business and believe in supporting them.  2 stars should be a wake up call from a culinary professional..."}
{"text":"I have never in my life had to reheat a pizza I just bought! 

First things first, when you walk in... What a cluster fuck! People don't know where to pick up food and where to ask to be seated. 

Second why is the manager pulling water out of the togo fridge? And why didn't he ask me how I was doing or if I needed anything? 

The togo lady was busy making orders but bot actually check on my order. She told me it would take 20 mins, and I sat there for 40 mins and my fucking pizza was cold when I walked out the door!  UNBELIEVABLE

In addition, even the people from the kitchen looked at me but didn't ask me if what they where bring out was my pizza. 

So my pizza was sitting back in the kitchen all ready to go while I was waiting.... Great service! 

In conclusion: (areas of improvement)
-front entrance major improvement 
-communication between kitchen and togo desk
-stop tell customers it's a 20 min wait over the phone when it's 40mins
-togo host should check order for people waiting inside the store (the people calling in aren't first priority. (Why not make the hostess also answer call? Basically stood there the whole time) 
-MAKE SURE THE PIZA IS HOT WALKING OUT THE DOOR"}
{"text":"I  have been there a dozen times and I'ved lived in the hood for 12yrs. The food is always fabulous! Orgasmic in my opinion. Apparently it's a pre-rec to hate customer service and your life to work there. Not pessimistic, just a happy realist."}
{"text":"Solid pizza and great specials.  How can you beat that.  The beer upsale for $1 is worth its weight in beer."}
{"text":"Went with friends this weekend.  Couldn't get the bartenders attention or one of 3 waiters (or 2 waiters and a bus boy) if we set ourselves on fire.  The place had maybe 12 people.  We told them after 15 minutes why we were leaving and they said, \"we'll, we don't have a hostess today.\"   Why would that matter??   We weren't greeted, we didn't have anyone take our drink order, and nobody gave us menus in 15 minutes.   I will not try them again."}
{"text":"I have been here 4x and always had a great experience. Everyone I take loves the pizza. The staff is courteous and efficient and always gets the orders right. I love how you can choose family dining or the bar or the patio, 3 different atmospheres for whatever your mood is. Prices are good for the high quality pizza and happy hour has some really good deals. It's become my go-to pizza place."}
{"text":"The service is AWFUL.  Went in on a Saturday night around 7:30pm. There were about 3 other tables. Took a few minutes just to be seated because no hostess was to be found. Service started out OK, but once our food was delivered by the runner - that was the end of our interaction with anyone. Server stopped by for a quick second to check on us, which at this point I was planning on ordering food to go, but I didn't even get to answer before she continued on her way. Then we sat for almost 40 minutes after we finished our meal for our check!! Yes, a large party came in however, we were finished with our meal for about 10 minutes when they arrived. I couldn't take the ignoring from ALL staff members any longer and was about to walk out when she finally came with the check. \"Sorry this was unexpected\" was all I got. 
The food was decent. A bit overpriced. Horrendous service. Nothing to go back to that's for sure."}
{"text":"We have been here s couple of times, once for wine, once for dinner. I got a calzone for dinner. It is huge. It was good I would order it again. (However, you need to ask for sauce).  The other night a friend brought over a pizza...fresh mozzarella and pepperoni. By the time he got to our house it was cold, but it was still really good. 

I think their wine is a bit over priced...and while they offer 1/2 price bottles on Wednesdays, you can still find the same bottles/years at other restaurants for far less than their regular price.  

Overall, I like the atmosphere and I will be back to try more dishes."}
{"text":"My wife and I used to like coming here for happy hour. Recently we just had a baby girl. We figured out quick that it isn't easy to get out to eat. We decided to go to their happy hour to get out of the house with our baby but was unfortunately offput because they wouldn't serve us because of our baby. I can understand the scene isn't good for our baby, so I asked if we could sit in the dining room, and maybe they could still honor the happy hour. They refused and said that they couldn't. While waiting for my wife to enter the restuarunt after parking I was asked multiple times if I needed help and asked them all if they could honor happy hour, and they all said no. No one went to ask a manager or anything. Just no. Really upsetting after we spent so much energy and time to drive there for their food. This just shows that they don't care about their customers. Wonder what else they do or refuse to do when it comes to their food service. I'll never go back. There food isn't good enough for me to pay for a sitter anyway. I will say that we decided to go to Spotted Donkey on Scottsdale and Carefree and they honored there happy hour for us with our baby in the dining room. Better place, better food, better people at Spotted Donkey."}
{"text":"We went there for lunch on a Wednesday.  The lunch menu is fabulous. The service was great.  The pizza was delicious.  My husband had the pizza on the lunch menu and it was a good size.  The crust was thin and the mozzerella was fresh. Just delicious!! I had the Honey Hot wings and they were pretty good.  The wings weren't saturated with sauce so that was nice and it had a nice bite to it. The total bill for 3 people for lunch was $25.00 before tip.  We will be going back!!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed everything about the bar.  But the lack off staff means service was slow.
Roomy rest rooms, spacious dining area, OK beer selection.  Loved the pizza."}
{"text":"Their food is great but I've always had a problem with their service. Why would you say you're open until 11 but not take takeout orders at 10:20? I'm not even dining there I just want to pick up food."}
{"text":"They prioritize customers that come in for the bar area and lounge. We stood at the entrance waiting several minutes for a server to sit us down but no luck.

We weren't greeted, we were sat down as if it was an inconvenience. We finally ordered, the place wasn't busy so it baffles me, we got our pizza which was at best okay. Medium wings that were dryer than the Arizona desert."}
{"text":"Pizza isn't bad and the wings are decent. They're lazy with their online upkeep. Their menu online has cheaper prices than in store but they've yet to update their site to reflect this. That's pretty poor business management and definitely an annoyance."}
{"text":"A group of 4 of us visited Upper Crust last night for the 2nd time and were very disappointed compared to our first visit about 6 weeks ago.  We loved their antipasto platter the first time around - it was almost a meal in itself with good quality cheese and meats- for $11.99.  This time it was half the size and mostly roasted red peppers out of a jar.  The pizza crust was good, but we order sausage and sundried tomatoes and there was hardly any sausage on it and the tomatoes were quite dry.  Last time, they brought a pizza like this to our table by mistake and it looked so good we knew we would have to try it next.  The white pizza is still quite good.  The service in the bar area was better than last time.

We all agreed that we would not be going back.  There is better in the Valley."}
{"text":"Decent happy hour usually no problem dinding a table. . Staff takes care of you.  . Not amazing but a good place to get a bite"}
{"text":"Good food 
Nice atmosphere
I recommend this place 
Service was alittle slow 
But it was very crowded 
And waitress was very nice about it 
And apologetic 

I recommend eating there 
Nice place"}
{"text":"The food is amazing and so is the service. We are addicted.  They even have gluten free pizza and it is amazing!!"}
{"text":"We live close by and tried this place out now 2 times. The food is not good but I convinced my fiance this second time just to go for a simple glass of wine on the patio since its so close. For a wine bar they have a poor selection of wine. We were never noticed walking in, even stood there to let someone know we would be outside. We walked and sat outside with our 6 year old and about 5 minutes later we were told at 8:45pm that we could not sit outside with him, only on the restaurant side. That is a first for me. Needless to say we left."}
{"text":"Be warned.... This business includes a line item for \"rounding\" on their bill.  According to  the consumer-protection folks at the state Office of the Attorney General that rounding up without an explicit and clearly visible explanation to customers is a violation of the law because it amounts to an undisclosed charge and a deceptive practice. The amount may be just a few cents, but that consumers have a right to a bill charging them for the total of what they ordered, nothing more.  When I questioned the bartender about the rounding practice and stated i didnt think it was ethical or legal his quote was \"Whatcha gonna do?  Sue me?\"  Hummmmmm..."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the valley no question.. I wish however, the crust was thicker and had more cheese! I never had any other food here but I imagine it would be very good as well."}
{"text":"Good stuff here.  We prefer Humble Pie and Spinatos so we usually don't order from here that often.."}
{"text":"Mostly really like this place...(see below)
I've eaten at Upper Crust six or seven times now.  I've been there alone, with my husband, with my immediate family and with a large family gathering.  The best experiences I've had were the first two times.  Both times we have excellant service and very good food.  
We are a little disapointed with the lack of consistent good service.  Management, why don't you use the really good servers to help train the not good servers?  Is there ever a manager on the floor watching for \"training opportunities\"?  I have never been greeted by a manager or been asked how everything was.  
Each visit, the food has been from good to great...except for the Gluten-Free crust.  Don't order it until they have replaced their supplier...it's currently not edible and even our server acknowledged that it was bad...after we sent it back to the kitchen.  Hint:  it would have been nice if the server had warned us in advance so my daughter could have had a dinner that she could eat.  BTW...no manager came out to apologize for the nasty pizza that time, either.
All in all it's worth the visit because the ingredients are mostly very fresh, the portion sizes are a good value and the beer selection is great."}
{"text":"We are frequent diners at Upper Crust, as the restaurant is less than five minutes from our house. We love the buffalo chicken pizza, which is topped with buffalo chicken, blue cheese, and celery. The crust is on the thinner side, which I like, and it's nice and flaky. The fried mozzarella is our favorite starter. They make the mozzarella fresh in-house, and it is lightly coated in their pizza crust and served with marinara sauce. The wings are great as well (we like them a little spicy, so we get them in medium), crunchy on the outside and not too heavily battered.

Based on food alone, I'd give Upper Crust five stars. However, service can be hit-or-miss. It is usually fine, but every few visits we'll have a waiter seemingly forget about us."}
{"text":"O stars!!!!! We took this food to go. This food is disgusting. The spaghetti was a clump of cold stuck together mush. The 1 small meatball was dried out with no sauce that looks liked it was picked up off the floor. The pizza was horrible. The interior of the restaurant was depressing and very strange. When spoke to the manager about the food, they offered our money back which we never got. We called 3 times after with different stories and excuses why no credit.
Also spoke to the owner. To sum up they don't care, there food is horrible and they have bad business ethics.  I can understand the other bad reviews.

9-2016   So here is an update to the Owners response to me. I really believe you have us confused with another unhappy customer. 1st I never said i would \"smear you on social media\" because i don't do social media. I have only ever had to use yelp 1 other time. I don't have time or like writing bad reviews ever! However you had an employee who hung up on us 3xs when we called in to check on a credit promised and never issued and that was over a long period off time. We NEVER yelled at anyone. We were very nice to her (even though she was rude to us) and very nice to your wife in speaking to her. I am sorry your unhappy but your food is terrible. And you do have spaghetti because they made it for us. You were out of the country remember and you had your rude employee helping us."}
{"text":"We attend events here frequently and usually  always  have a great experience.  Today we ordered their boneless  wings, large order $16.99...very disappointed  as we got about 20 small nuggets (size of a quarter)and 3 carrot sticks and 3 celery  sticks. Not worthy of  the price Thank goodness we had a great server/bartender Wilfred who made it a memorable girls lunch experience with his great customer  service and understanding,  even with  our complaints he kept his big smile and extra celery and carrot sticks. Jessica and Nora"}
{"text":"Ordered there boneless wings and they are a joke. The size of the boneless wings are a huge rip off. It looks like chinese food chicken without the veggies and noodles. I strongly recomend not ordering the boneless wings. Needless to say i wont be going back there again."}
{"text":"Visiting this location for the first time last Friday evening.  We sat on the patio to enjoy the BEAUTIFUL weather.  The service started out slow as we were passed several times by a male server who practically stepped over us and avoided all chances of eye contact.  Finally a female server greeted us and could not have been friendlier.  The food and beverages were served promptly and everything was delicious.  We were particularly impressed with the fresh ingredients offered in the Mediterranean salad.  The portions however were ENORMOUS and we definately over-ordered.  (In the future server should mention portion sizes to new guests.)  The restroom facilities were also very clean which is something any guest can appreciate!  Our experience turned sour as we were preparing to leave.  Another guest on the patio chose to light up a cigarette even though they were the closest table to the entrance and near other guests (including myself who was 9 months pregnant at the time).  We attempted to wait indoors for our bill but the smoke was EVERYWHERE.  When we notified the service staff they made no effort to follow the law and require the guest to be the appropriate distance from the entrance.  I realize as a new establishment it's hard to be difficult with guests but this definately impacted our experience and we heard grumbling from other tables around us as well.  
Overall a good experience, hopefully in time the staff will be more comfortable in handling guest issues to ensure everyone is able to enjoy their dinner."}
{"text":"My wife had to literally drag me to this place, mainly because I didn't expect there to be a decent pizza/wine place away from Old Town/Kirland/Desert Ridge areas. The place blew me away! Delicious food, friendly service, and a comforting atmosphere. 

Atmosphere: They really spent the extra cash and attention in the build out. Three sides to the restaurant, family dining area, a sports bar area, and a patio. Since college football was in play we sat in the sports bar area. There were a dozen or so TV's to catch all the games that were on. The atmosphere here was clean and inviting. 

Food: Good selection of wine and beer. Since we were watching football I thought it only natural to go with a cold beer. Was nice to see they had beers on tap that is typically not found around town, gives me another reason to go back there. Like I said before, I had low expectations going in so when our appetizers came out it blew me away; THE best stuffed mushrooms I have ever had. Next, we tried the wings, not the highlight of the meal but still fantastic. For our entree we shared a ceasar salad and pizza. If you are expecting to get a $10.99, 3 topping pizza from Dominos, with greasy cheese and crust, this isn't the place for you. The pizza is higher end with fresh topping and higher end cheese. Not the type of pizza that makes you want to gorge after, it was light and delicious. Reminded me much of Grimaldi's but with better toppings.

Service: Very friendly staff. Couldn't decide on the beer I wanted so she offered us a couple of samples. Really gave us a fantastic experience, THANKS LAURA!!"}
{"text":"When my wife and I showed up with our two kids we didn't know what to expect. Some places have a hard time dealing with young kids. The staff and waiter were awesome!!!  We were so pleased at the friendliness of everyone. 

I highly recommend it. The outside doesn't look like a \"nice\" place but the ambiance inside and staff treated like a great high end place."}
{"text":"Steve, I hope you are reading this.  I tried calling and left a message but never heard back and you have no email contact information on your website.  

I live close by so often stop by with my family for dinner.  We've always enjoyed the food.  But here is the problem.  Just as the other reviews stated, your bartender/waitress is very rude.  It seems like I am a burden to her.  I know being a server is probably not her end goal in the game of life, but right now, it's her job.  It's like my father used to say, \"Whatever you do in life, just be good at it\".  

I came in last week with my parents and in laws for their first visit.  There was no one in the restaurant, not even staff.  I went to the bar to seek help.  There she was, already angry and disgruntled.  She just points to the restaurant area, no words out of her mouth.  I guess it's my fault for staying because I had a hunch the way our dinner was going to be.  It took 30 minutes to receive our food, I only know this because my father kept looking at his watch every five minutes and verbally gave us a five minute update EVERY five minutes.  As I mentioned earlier, we were the only people in the whole establishment.  No one complained about the food, very tasty as always.

When it was time to pay, my in laws had a 20% off food coupon for \"dine in or take out\".  She told us \"this coupon is good for takeout only\".  I showed here that it clearly states \"dine in or take out\".  Nope, she wouldn't take it.  She added if we liked your Facebook page, she'd give us 10% off.  I assure you we did not or plan on doing it.  

I enjoy small business.  In fact, if you look at my past reviews, you can see where I clearly state it.  We love your food.  Don't let one staff member give your business a black eye.  I'm not trying to get her in trouble, but she needs to be taught.  Perhaps you should do spot checks with her?  You have not lost my loyalty yet, but I assure you that my parents and in laws will never be back.

Best of luck."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza...Margarita is my favorite! !  Low key, neighborhood type bar/restaurant.  Good for anyone....family , couples, etc.  
Casual attire, friendly eatery....would recommend without reservations."}
{"text":"Walked in, awkwardly sat myself after no one greeted me. Waitress came and took my order (a beer), and then I sat there for about 15 minutes watching her serve everyone around me. Finally just walked out. Not sure if anyone even noticed. So, yeah...that happened."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!!  They have an amazing happy hour (till 7pm) and great lunch specials:)  Thank you Michelle for introducing me to this fantastic place!!!  The pizza is top notch!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! Great service! Will return... And definitely recommend to all! The variety of pizzas is great, you won't be sorry you stopped by!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite spot! The pizza and wings here are amazing. The wings are super crispy with a nice flavorful sauce. I would recommend the hot ones, because the medium is lacking a bit of heat. The pizza is also to die for. The cheese is very fresh and all of the toppings are very fresh. The sangria is soooo good too. It really does rival postinos. If the weather is nice, sit on the patio. Finally, the prices are extremely reasonable. A large pizza is only $12. My husband couldn't believe it when I told him!"}
{"text":"This is ridiculous! Happy hour prices but only if you sit in the sports bar part. AND IF THERE IS NO ROOM YOU EAT IN THE DINING AREA AND PAY FULL PRICE!  In other words if you walk ten feet into the dining area you pay full price. AND they will not let you bring anyone under 21 into the sports bar area. We have tried their food and its ok...expensive for what they serve. I will say the service is exceptional from the wait staff. The hostess forget it! See ya and ww will never be back and will not bring our office back either."}
{"text":"We've been here quite a few times and its always been great pizza.  They make everything in house, fresh cheese, fresh sauce and fresh crust...oh the crust!  In my opinion its the crust that will set you above all others, and this crust is fantastic.  Try to go on Tuesday for the special $10 one topping large pizza, we usually get pepperoni and its not greasy like most pizza places."}
{"text":"WOW!

Great place, with amazing food. Very nice outdoor patio.

Started off with the stuffed mushrooms, which are stuffed with spinach dip, mozzarella, and sausage on top. OH SO GOOD!

Pepperoni and Italian sausage pizza. Had great sauce and thin crust, I just wanted to dip the crust in more sauce, it was great. 

Fettuccine chicken alfredo... LOVED IT. Lots of sauce, lots of chicken. 

Match it all up with a glass of vino... you are all set to go. Our waitress helped us match a vino with our pizza. She was very friendly and knowledgeable of the menu. 

We will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"I would have loved to like Upper Crust, as I've heard good things about the food.  However, they don't seem to care about families or taking care of their customers so we never got to try.  I called a day ahead to make reservations for 12 people (2 kids included), and inquired about the happy hour options and seating.  I was told they didn't take reservations, but we could sit at tables near the bar and receive happy hour for our group.  I sent the email confirming this to our friends.  The day of, one of our friends called to ask about the specials and was told by another employee that we weren't allowed to come in for happy hour with kids.  Of course, I received the call from my friend while we were all en route to the restaurant.  I called and spoke with the bartender (no manager on staff) and asked if they could do something for us.  She said they don't allow kids in the bar area period.  I asked if they would allow us the happy hour pricing in the restaurant side and they said they would see what they could do.  We showed up, and received a big fat no- no apology- no offer to make anything right for our group.  Which by the way, all of us live in N. Phoenix and this would have been our first visit (that's 5 families).  I asked to speak to the owner and was told he was in a meeting.  I asked for a phone call back when he was out of his meeting, which I never received.  Not only were we misinformed, then inconvenienced, there was not a shred of concern, nor even an attempt by the staff to take care of the situation.  We were told the owner doesn't allow kids on the bar side.  It is not illegal for kids to be in a bar with their parents at a table having pizza and a glass of wine.  The owner clearly just doesn't care- which is completely disenchanting but in the end, his loss.  Instead of making an exception and allowing happy hour prices on the restaurant side, they lost the business of 5 local families forever.  We went to Kona, sat at a table for 12 and had a wonderful happy hour.  If you want good pizza- go to Cibo or Humble Pie."}
{"text":"Tasted their food at Yelps pleydate.  They were sampling some awesome meatballs and raviolis.  They also handed out a coupon for a free pizza.  Their location is across town, but decided to give it a try hoping that their pizza would be as good as their samples from the event.  

Excellent pie.  If you like Girmaldis style pizza, you have to check this place out.  There is a Girmaldis closer to my house, but I would rather drive here for pizza.  Great crust and the mozzarella is outstanding.  This is our new favorite pizza place in town."}
{"text":"Weve moved here from back east, and thought that we'd never find pizza we loved as much as back home!  Well, WE FOUNT IT AT UPPER CRUST!! Best Pizza I can remember having, crust was perfect, flavor was out of this world, and they even gave us a private area for a family party.  Wish there was one in MY neighborhood :)"}
{"text":"Picked up two large pizzas last weekend.  Was shocked on how big these pizzas are.  Four hungry adults couldn't eat it all.  Also amazed by how many TVs are in the restaurant.  Will be dinning in soon to watch some football and eat some great pizza."}
{"text":"What they lack in service, they certainly don't make up for in their average food."}
{"text":"My Fiance and I have become regulars here for happy hour after moving to the area. I can't get enough of their wings, they are the best and I am addicted to them now. They also have a great house white wine for $3 on their happy hour menu. We occasionally get pizza, which is delicious. The thin crust kind that is only is good hot so eat it quick! When it's not too hot we love to sit on their little patio. I wish it wasn't next to the parking lot, takes away from the ambiance a bit but it is still comfortable. Inside has a nice laid back feel as well now that it is too warm for outside. A lot of people's reviews are low due to no children in the lounge or patio. As an adult with no children who wants to relax at happy hour after work I really like and prefer this. They don't extend happy hour to the family dining area, which I think maybe they should. 

Only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because it can be hard to get the waitresses attention to come serve on the patio when you get there since it is open seating. Service can occasionally be a tad slow, but the waitresses are always friendly to us. 

All in all I love this place as my go to spot. Definitely worth checking it out!!!!"}
{"text":"So I told 3 of my friends about $10 tuesday..we usually go out to dinner together once a month. So we planned this about a month ago and the sisters I guess found a coupon for a free pizza (I have no idea what the coupon says). So we are seated and hand waitress coupon they order there cheese pizza I'm next and said $10 cheese and sausage you can't have that price with coupon ok I'll sit at another table cause your pizza isn't worth $20 waitress says you can't do that. Our other friend can't have red sauce of course they don't have white cheese pizza anyways it goes on  what my problem is , is that the waitress sees we are upset and doesn't say anything but negatively. A great waitress  (customer service) would of said oh this might work for you and this price would be better..nothing ..None of us will be back.."}
{"text":"Just like Maria said about a long drive to get here, Abby and I did the same trek as well. After trying their food at the Yelp Pleydate it was a no brainer to try this place in person. 

Their location right off the 101 makes them able to serve a larger population than a typical family run pizza joint. They were super easy to get to and if I lived somewhere in the Desert Ridge area I would be here often! 

We arrived on a Friday night and was able to grab a seat right away which was surprising since after looking around I couldn't find an empty table anywhere. Our waiter took good care of us. We were entertained by the TVs showing different sports, but it was the right amount of TV's (if you've read my reviews you'll know I don't like to be overwhelmed with TV's). 

I started out with a Sleepy Dog Brewery beer right from the tap so +1 point there! Then we shared a \"Specialty Pizza\", the Buffalo Chicken Pizza that was super tasty! It survived a night in the car (since we went straight to the bars afterwards) and is still making a name for itself in our fridge as a left over. 

We finished things off with Upper Crust's Pizookie. I remember reading about it in another review so when the waiter asked about dessert I ordered one with no regrets. 

I really wish this place was closer so I could try some of their pastas. I would have taken my mom here on Mother's Day if it were the case but either way, if you're in the area or want to take a drive to eat some bomb food, go here."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the valley!  They make everything in house - the crust, the sauce, even the cheese!  We usually start with the Mediterranean Salad which has crisp lettuce, feta cheese crumbles, black olives in a really light vinaigrette - it's huge and so good!  Then we always get a large pepperoni and onion pizza - so good we haven't been able to try anything else.  Go try it!  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been going to UC for quite a while, love the food and the staff have become friends. The only complaint I have is towards another regular customer. His name is Michael and everyone knows him. He is the most intrusive, rude and aggressive person I have ever encountered. This man literally hangs on you, grabs and touches you, invades your space and makes women feel so violated that they have to ask total strangers for help. I have told him on many occasions to leave me and my friends alone to the point of fist fights. He upsets the staff and they have 86ed him on several occasions. Here's the problem ... he keeps coming back. The owner of Upper Crust seems to be uninvolved and I hope with this review will bring this to his attention. There is no reason why we need to endure this type of behavior and my hope is that I can remain a loyal customer."}
{"text":"What a nice find. Gluten free for the wife, and half price wine on Wednesday night for me!  The pizza was excellent and prices seemed reasonable. The wife said the gluten free crust was excellent b"}
{"text":"Fist time here my boy friend and I went for dinner... it didn't seem busy took for ever to get our order out.. never got offered more drinks and she wasn't attentive at all. I had to ask the waitress how much longer never going back."}
{"text":"Friendly service. Had the Buschetta as an appetizer and it actually would have sufficed as my entire meal - it's the size of a personal pizza that I ordered for my meal. I had the basic personal size pizza with pepperoni and it was pretty tasty, so I can definitely recommend it. 

Upper Crust seems like a good spot for a nice hearty selection of tasty pizza and other Italian fare.  Check it out."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, it's ok in a pinch. The calzone was soggy on the bottom, so was the pizza crust. Usually I'll drive past it on my way to Spinato's, even Gus' down  the street has better food."}
{"text":"I've been to Upper Crust several times with my in-laws, and the food and service are always top notch.  I don't always have time to write reviews; however, something that Upper Crust did last week was so nice that I wanted to make sure to thank them for it.

Last Monday was my birthday, and with a two year old and a six month old, eating out can be tricky.  My boys and I go out fairly often, but not for dinner (my husband prefers my cooking, how nice!).  My birthday fell on a Monday, and after working all day my husband just wanted to eat at home.  So he asked what I'd like for my birthday dinner, and I asked him to pick up pizza, wings and a salad from Upper Crust.  When the folks at Upper Crust found out it was my birthday, they included tiramisu (sp?) in the to-go bags, and it made my night.   Everything was delicious as always - the honey hot wings, the pizza, and the house salad, but it was so nice to include an enormous piece of tiramisu (perfect to share) and we did not ask for it.  THANK YOU Upper Crust, your consistency in providing not only excellent food but top of the line service will keep us coming back again and again."}
{"text":"pricey and the service is hit or miss, however they do have great pizza and the place is great to watch the game when all my PACKER NATION bars around me are packed full !"}
{"text":"This place is so unprofessional. I called ahead for happy hour times to ensure my family was able to come. We were seated in the regular area and not able to order from the happy hour menu. When I asked for it the waitress say no it's for the lounge area only. Well I asked could we go and she said no because of the baby my sister had. So I asked could we sit outside again she said no. I've been a chef 16 years! Never turn away business ever! You turn away a family of four after we can't eat from the menu we chose? Was it because we are African American? Any other time you can get a manager to make exceptions but this witch rushed us from the table completely. I will never ever eat here again and guess what. I'll continue to write terrible reviews every chance I get of this racist restaurant! Don't eat here if you're Black!!!!"}
{"text":"This was an excellent stop in Phoenix for dinner while we were visiting.  It's a very cute restaurant with a rustic theme and family-style dining.  The food was enjoyable and fairly reasonably priced.  Our waiter was friendly and helpful in choosing wine and food.  However, once the food came, I never really saw him again.  The owner was circulating, checking on tables, as owners do, so, he ended up getting us things like refills.  Apart from the absentee waiter (which ended up not even being that bad), this was a nice spot for dinner!"}
{"text":"This place is conveniently located near my house.  Its one of the nice places nearby that you can eat/hang out and isn't a chain restaurant.  The pizza is thin and crispy like I like it.  The restaurant is a pretty decent size place with PLENTY of TV's for all the sports addicts.  The patio seating is nice as well but its a shame the only view you get is the parking lot."}
{"text":"I have edit my last review, yes was I unhappy with the owners rule to keep the patio and lounge to 21 and above, yes. But it is their choice. Please be aware that the Happy Hour only extends to that area only. I am sad that the beautiful patio area and the lower prices don't apply & can't be extended to families. Just be aware and not disappointed. Steve reached out and explained the rationale, understood but still sad!"}
{"text":"Friday night, NBA playoff games are on. So what to do? Grab a beer and eat some pizza and wings. The ratings were good, 4 out of 5 stars, and location was close to where I'm staying. We have a winner.

Going in, the restaurant side only had one table occupied while the rest of the restaurant was emptied. My group preceded to the bar side, after all we were looking forward to a relaxing beer after hours of driving to Phoenix. We ordered our beers and settled with a small pizza and a 12 piece wing (with two sauces). The pizza is huge for a small, in any other pizza place it would be considered a medium or even a Papa Johns large. It was good, thin crust with just enough toppings. The wings were good, the sauces wasn't anything special.

The one star review is due to service. I know, the reviews should be about just the food and not so much weighted on the service. But if you think about it, service is a big part of a restaurant...I mean, you're tipping 20% of the bill on their service. So because of this, the food being just okay. The service was what really killed a perfectly good night. The waitress was condescending in how she talked, correcting my math when it was her that was wrong. Stating that ALL places that sell wings would charge for two 6 pieces instead of a 12 piece if we wanted two sauces. If she had just mentioned that in the first place then okay, if the menu had stated that then okay. But neither did. What's more was she was staring down our table and talking to the other waitress about my table while we were still there. Very inappropriate! You ruined our night and I guess we ruined hers, but wait until the customer leaves before you bash on customers.

If you come, eat, drink and enjoy just don't sit in Laura's section because she could ruin your night too. 

Therefore, the food being just okay and the service being horrible equals one star."}
{"text":"If there was a 3 1/2 star, that is what I would select for this place. The first time I went during happy hour, it was fantastic. The other two times, not so much. The personal pizza for $4 plus $1 per topping is a good value. They make fresh Mozzarella cheese and you can definitely taste it. 

The wings are also pretty good. Honey Hot is how I like em. They have a nice beer variety and $3 house Merlot during happy hour is a nice offering. If it was more consistent, it would get a 4 star rating. The pizza sauce seems to vary in flavor from sweet to a tad spicy. Not sure why this is the case. 

The layout and flow is nice and the patio for outdoor lounging is nice when the temperature is below 90 degrees."}
{"text":"So my buddy and I walked into Upper Crust Pizza and sat at the sports bar side which had TVs on the wall with all the games on- sweet! The area has a classy yet relaxed and fun atmosphere. Right when we sat down our waitress, Aliyah, came to take our order. Aliyah was very friendly, social, and just had a great attitude. The best part of Aliyah was her pulchritudinous and mesmerizing looks- almost as she was radioactive with \"bueatiful-ness-energy\" radiating from her.  Aliyah, with her ridiculously piercing good looks, recommended the Fried Mozzarella and they were delicious- something new that I've never tried. On to the main dish where we had half mushrooms and half pepperoni on our pizza. The pizza came out in about 15-20 minutes. The crust I'd rate a 4/5, the sauce 4/5, could use  a little more topping to really taste them 3.5/5, but the cheese was a 5/5 since you could definitely tell that the cheese was high quality- something most pizza places skimp out on. Overall the pizza was great! However not as great as Aliyah's supermodel good looks!"}
{"text":"We love this pizza and wine bar.  Very, very good pizza with fresh quality toppings and homemade mozzarella.  Good wings and other appetizers.  Great selection of wine and beer.  All at a very inexpensive price unlike a lot of other wine bars.  The wait staff is always friendly and has good wine suggestions.  We like the patio seating and inside bar area.  Highly recommend this one!!!"}
{"text":"Their pizza needs to be in your mouth. BUTTERY crust. Like, butter buttery. And it's superb reheated at home in the toaster oven."}
{"text":"Great pizza!! This place was a great last minute pick!! 
We decided to bring in the big 2013 with a small get together celebration at this pizza joint!! The service was great!! We had a friendly and patient server with our undecided group. Also we loved the surprisingly good tasting white sauce on our pizzas!! Everything was amazing!! The Mozzarella appetizers and the Extreme Hot wings!! Oh so good, fatty food!! We look forward to coming back!!"}
{"text":"Hung out with some friends here this past Saturday night for the first time. This unassuming pizza place is right down the street from our house and provides a quick \"go to\" for some good food and excellent service. 

We had such an enjoyable time sitting on the patio having a couple glasses of wine (beer for the guys) and eating from very tasty food. I thought at first it would be weird on the patio with the parking lot right there, but it really didn't bother any of us and we kind of forgot where we were for awhile... so, don't let the location deter you from going here!  

As far as the food is concerned...we all shared the stuffed mushroom appetizer and bruchetta. Both were good and somewhat unique. The mushroom was stuffed with italian sausage, which I love, and the brushetta was make your own on pizza bread. I was pleased with both appetizers and their prompt service. In addition to little noshes, we all shared 3 pizzas, the buffalo chicken, a pesto with sausage, and plain cheese. I've got to say the pesto was my favorite followed closely by the buffalo chicken. I didn't care too much for the red pizza sauce, just didn't taste that great to me. We also had the cookie dessert, which was mighty fine. 

Since this place is so close and better than other pizza places near us (mainly humble pie), we will be frequenting here whenever we have a hankering for some good quality pizza."}
{"text":"I have stopped here for lunch on multiple occasions and continue to be surprised about this hidden gem.  I wish I can live closer to hear to come by in the evenings because the ambience seems really fun.  

Try their appetizers they all have been good, I have tried the mushrooms and the bruschetta and the mozzarella balls that are made in house.  

They have a bar area and a dinning spot.  They use iPods to order your food and their pizza is awesome!  What else can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Great place for thin crust pizza, salads and wings!  A little on the pricy side, but happy hour in the bar ROCKS every day from 4pm to 7pm!  And Burt ROCKS too!"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place in n phx.  Great atmosphere and the food is spectacular!   You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We love the pizza and wings here--I'm not sure what all the service complaints are because we have never experienced any issues with service. We always sit in the restaurant side because children are not allowed in the bar so maybe the service ha better in the restaurant. 
One of the best pizzas in town--fresh mozzarella, not greasy at all, thin crust--so good!!"}
{"text":"Good, not great. I prefer my pizza thin crust which they don't offer here. I need to load each slice with pepper flakes and Parmesan for flavor when I think a good slice of pizza needs neither. Nice restaurant, a lot of TVs and great drink menu. They also have an awesome mozzarella appetizer."}
{"text":"Ate there for the first time last night and the food was fantastic. They did a great job on the remodel, so it's a lot more open than it was before. They have an extensive wine list and the service was wonderful. We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"We just had the best service from Miranda. Truly top notch! We came in around 10:15 for some pizza and never once did we feel rushed to get out by 11. She was polite, attentive and just plain delightful. 

We ordered theFried Mozzarella to start and oh my golly! I think they make it with rainbows and unicorn tears. Thick slices of fresh mozzarella wrapped in thin pizza dough and flash fried to a crispy, not greasy, crust. Pillowy pockets of cheesy heaven. It was delicious! As far as pizza, we orders a small (which is an enormous 16\") half cheese, half pepperoni. The crust is thin and crisp with a perfect chewy bite to it. The sauce is light and fresh and not over powering. Somehow their cheese to sauce ratio is perfected. 

Our drinks were always full and our dishes were cleared in a timely manner. 

If you are thinking of trying it, you will not be disappointed. Very delicious!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and wine!  We will definitely be back!!  Good thin crust pizza!  Cute place!"}
{"text":"My brother told me that this place had great pizza and thought it was of the best in Phoenix, so he dragged me down there one evening. 

Upper Crust is located in a shopping center shared with Costco which doesn't always give the best first impression. The previous tenants were pizza restaurants that didn't last so I was hoping that UCP would be good and stick around for a while. 

We started off with fried mozzarella, which wasn't like mozzarella you've had before. This cheese is made fresh on the premises and wasn't too heavily breaded. We devoured these white nuggets of goodness and couldn't wait to see what else UCP had to offer.

Next up were the chicken wings. OMG, these buffalo wings were epic! They were just the right size, good portion of meat to bone ratio and the sauce was outstanding. These wings could arguably be some of the best in town.

Finally, our awesome waiter brought out our pie topped with pepperoni and sausage. Now, depending on what style of pizza you like will depend if this a winner for you. UCP serves more of a thin New York style which I enjoy. I would give the pizza a 4 out of 5 knocking one point because I thought the pizza was too flimsy. Overall, the pizza tasted great and you can tell they use quality ingredients.

To sum this up, my brother was right, UCP served up some great food! I am glad to see that people like this place and I think it will be around for a while. I noticed they had some valuable happy hour offerings which one could take advantage of discounted drinks and appetizers such as the fried mozzarella or chicken wings. Another great thing about this place is that is has a main dining room or you can walk through a door and go into a more private wine bar which offers outdoor heated seating."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza!  Quote of the night:  me: \"What's your best pizza?\"  Server:  \"The best pizza is the one with the toppings YOU like.\" We had pizza with roasted red peppers, saussge, kalamata olives and sliced tomatoes. Out of this world!"}
{"text":"Over priced and under flavored. It's a shame that such a great location is occupied by such a bad establishment. The bar staff just seems disinterested in being there."}
{"text":"Went there the other night, had Pizza and wings.  The pizza was ok-good, really not the style I like, so if I were you, reading the review, I'd take that wiht a grain of salt.  It was large and very thin.  Like 1/2 as thick as a Rosati's.  The good news is the price is much mroe reasonable than Rosatis.

Now to the really good news.  The wings.  Very, very good, like a 14 out of 15 on my proprietary scale of wings.  Would have been 15 out of 15 if they had left them in the fryer a few moments longer.  they bake the wings ahead of time, then fry them quickly to crisp them before adding a perfect, thin sauce (not the ketchup like stuff you get at some \"wings\" palces\".  These are, in my opinion, some of the best I've had in Phoenix.  Let's give it another shot to ensure they're consistent... and ask them to drop them in the frier a little longer!

The other reason I gave them 4 of 5 - and if they ONLY did wings they'd already have a 5/5 - was I don't care for the happy hour policy.  I understand it, but I think they could be more accomodating.  You see, to get the HH hour pricing, you need to sit on the \"bar\" side.  However, if you are there with anyone under 21 you can only sit on the restaurant side.

While I apprecaite that I don't want to necessarily expose kids to the bar scene, at the same time, I don't feel I should have to pay more just for travelling with kids.  Make the HH prices restaurant wide, and we'll be good, or let us take kids into the bar area.  Kona does it!"}
{"text":"I have been a fan of UC since the first time we met, but I believe things have changed.  The last several times I have been, the service is not what it used to be.  Most recently, I tried to book a party of 20 for THREE days. This is my sons favorite place to eat and he wanted to spend his 18th birthday here.  I cannot even get a return phone call or email. #iamdone
UPDATE- Been back a few times now.  Service has improved.  Food is still excellent."}
{"text":"Great pizza!  Fried mozzarella was like air filled hot pockets.  They really need to use more mozzarella. Service mediocre at best.  We ordered pepperoni, got cheese?? Waiter didn't understand when we asked about a white pizza?  He had no clue so we gave up.   We will go back but won't be ordering fried mozzarella until they change the recipe."}
{"text":"Terrible!  The wings are hard and taste like them cooked them yesterday.  The pizza was soggy and we found a piece of Long Hair in pizza!!! Will Never go again. I would give it zero stars if we could."}
{"text":"3.8/5 Stars - Pizza was better than average but didn't blow me away. Service was outstanding, but I can't include that in the rating. Had really good happy hour prices which I do include in the rating. Would go back a second time and try the pasta."}
{"text":"I  frequent this joint often to relax outside on the patio and drink wine and/or beer.  The service here is outstanding.  My vegan friend particularly likes this place because they make her vegan friendly pizza.  As a carnivour I love their italian sausage.  And for all you cheese lovers their mozerella is made fresh daily!  I am more of a beer fan than a wine person so it is worth mentioning they have an extensive beer list, including quite a few beers on tap.

The sign above the patio says 'Patio and Wine Bar', so it can be easy to miss if you are looking for the full name on the sign."}
{"text":"I had given this place a great review previously, but I had to edit it because of the lack of customer service and disappointment.
It's very upsetting that I booked a party of 7 (only 6 people had eaten) and was charged an added gratuity of 20% without being made aware. I called to ask for a manager and they passed the phone to someone else. I explained the situation and asked what their policy was for automatic gratuity and I was told  it was for parties 8 or more and to call back when the other manager was there. 
I sent an email to the Upper Crust via Yelp with no response. I then emailed the actual Upper Crust's website via their contact information and also received no response. I called once again and the gal who claimed to be the manager stated that it was the \"servers discretion.\" Granted, I should have looked at the bill closer, but we were a bit focused on the bottle of wine that was charged to our tab that shouldn't have been on there. It's very disappointing that, for #1, the hostess didn't tell me that I would be charged a 20% gratuity for a party of 7 upon booking (again only 6 people were eating) and #2 the server (Claire) didn't make us aware that she added an automatic gratuity. There were three tabs at our table. The total tip that I gave Claire ended up being over $80. For the entire table, Claire made at least a $130 tip. I would have expected at least an email back regarding our disappointment."}
{"text":"Delicious pepperoni pizza. Really reminds me of a New York style pizza. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been there a few times now. We really love the atmosphere. The service has been great every time. The food is great and I especially enjoy the wine selections."}
{"text":"So I came here with my girl because they have a great happy hour. We ordered food, and hers came out about 15 minutes later. I ordered pizza and wings, which came out 30 minutes later. Meanwhile, she ordered a water and she never got it. Service was atrocious. Furthermore, while I'm still waiting for my wings and pizza, the server is mingling with a patron at the bar eating wings! Haven't received my wings, yet she is eating them at the bar! One one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had on a not so busy Tuesday."}
{"text":"Stuffed mushrooms? With what? Fried mozzarella? If you like 5 pounds of cheese.  Garlic pepperoni pizza. We'll lets jut say I won't be hunted by vampires any time soon.  It was hard to take and we love garlic.  The server was nice but Un-attentive.  My boyfriend never got a 2nd beer and was never asked if he wanted one. I had to give him the rest of my Moscow mule.  By the way the Moscow nuke was delicious.  I guess kudos to the bar tender."}
{"text":"One of our favorite pizza places!  We usually take out, but the times we have eaten there have been enjoyable as well.  Their Pizza and Salads are very good!"}
{"text":"I work at a nearby animal clinic and we often get our lunch from here when we have busy days. I grew up eating a lot of Italian food and I can be picky with what I eat. I really like this place- the owners are super nice, there are lots of veggie-friendly options, and I like that they are a lot less \"gimmicky\" with their options than a lot of other Italian places. We have to thank them quite a bit for fueling us through our work days and I think it's a great little place to relax and grab a bite."}
{"text":"Boo!!! We had a pretty good experience until we went to checkout. The coupons we printed off of their website TODAY were expire and they would not honor them. Update your damn website!"}
{"text":"Yummy... Nice thin crust, homemade mozzarella, and close to home! What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Went 1-4-17 for dinner with my daughter.  Read all of the reviews prior to leaving the house so was hoping for the best.  Laura was our server - EXCELLENT service - thank you, Laura.  Had the meatballs (very tender/tasty), the anti pasta plate (it was per the description so can't complain there, but a variety of meats and cheeses would have made it a great plate), fried mozzarella (unique way to prepare mozzarella), and spinach dip (very flavorful).  All in all, this is a neighborhood gem.  It's not, nor is it meant to be, some 5 star Italian restaurant.  It's just good food, with excellent service, and a relatively good wine list for the type of restaurant it is.  Also, Wednesday is 1/2 price wine day - all day.  I will definitely return."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's not the best pizza in the world but it's definitely on my top favorites in Phoenix. My favorite days are Wednesday's here, half off bottles off wine. Can't beat 14$ for a nice Chianti. Antipasto and pizza is a great meal for us to enjoy over a bottle of wine. I'll definitely keep coming back, especially on Wednesdays. Always good service which is very important to me along with the food. Only negative is...I wish they had cannoli's ;)"}
{"text":"Went there for first time, ordered pizza, salad and stuffed mushrooms.  The food was excellent and the service was also good.  Will certainly go there again."}
{"text":"Worst service I have had there!  Inattentive waiter and took forever to get our wings.  We only got them after we got up and asked someone to check.  When we first started going there, the service was great - including iphones that sent the order from the table to the kitchen immediately.  I really don't know what happened tonight since the waiter mumbled an apology."}
{"text":"Best Pizza in town! I've Been looking for a good pizza in town for 8 years. Well I found great pizza at Upper Crust. Oh yeah don't forget  about the honey-hot wings well made wing sauce. Great service, excellent food, and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Not only was the owner, Chelby, an amazing host she instructed a paint night birthday party for my cousin! Food & wine was delicious :) Must go!"}
{"text":"We loved our experience from HomeRun for Upper Crust. Food was excellent as well as the service. Have been there several times and will go back again."}
{"text":"We come here regularly especially during football season. We love the staff and the gluten free pizza is about as good as gluten free anything can be. The wine list is pretty extensive and my husband loves their fried mozzarella. All around a great experience."}
{"text":"Very good! We stopped in after a Costco run and were really pleasantly surprised. The pizza was delicious!! Super thin crust and very tasty. We had the pizzoki for dessert, also very yummy. Our server was just ok, but food came out quick and hot. We will definitely be back. A place we consider one of those hidden local gems. Glad we stopped in."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place for awhile now and this last experience has been so awful I am NEVER coming back!!!!
I made a reservation for my husbands birthday for 12 people on a weds night in the bar area. We arrived to find out that they lost our reservation and we're told in a condescending manner that, \"we don't take bar reservations\".  We explained that we talked to Kevin and he double checked that the our reservation In the bar would be just fine. When I told manger/owner this, instead of apologizing and trying to rectify the situation, he acted as if we were out of line or lying about our reservation.  So then they shoved some tables awkwardly together and NEVER said sorry or that they were going to take care of us in any way.  I'm not sure why we stayed but we did, we were trying to have a good time for his birthday.. When the \"incompetently obnoxious\" server finally came over to get our drink/food order ,it was at least 5-10 mins. She took our order  and got everyone except myself.  She never asked me again if I was okay or if I was eating anything.  Long story short, it took forever and we waiting about 30 mins for our checks.. Speaking of split checks... Two couples in our group asked for separate checks because they had to leave early.  That wasn't a problem for them to get separate checks but when we asked for our checks to be split, she dropped off one check and told us to circle what we had!  We did so And of course she screwed it all up.  We also had a $25 gift card that surprisingly didn't work. They took the card and comped our bill. But really we paid $25 because they be we gave us a new gift card, (not like I'd ever come back).   Don't waste your time here!!!! The owner could give a shit about giving good service or making customers feel wanted."}
{"text":"Very good pizza and wings definitely our go to place in the neighborhood , doesn't taste like chain pizza !!!"}
{"text":"Let's start from the beginning, came with a group, everything was going fine until the end. The food was good, no doubt, but it was the service that was \"sketchy\". When we were done we asked to spilt the checks, our waitress was having a really hard time with this common core math, , and got real snappy with us when she couldn't get it right. It took her around 1/2 hr or more to figure out the checks. 1/2 hour later she split the checks but had doubled everything. It was painful. Even tho we told her what was on who's,it really was not that hard, and there were only 3 tables at lunch time. She was acting very strange and was twitching a lot. She was all over the place. We got there at 12:30 and left at 2:10. I had my toddler and he was about to lose it because how long it was taking her. To the owner the food was fantastic, it was the service that makes me not want to return."}
{"text":"We usually come here pretty often because the food is delicious. But it's impossible to get good service at this place... We have been coming regularly (almost once a week) for over a year and still have yet to have good service. I keep hoping they will hire someone decent, but chances are getting slim to none. Tonight we sat on the patio for 30 minutes with nobody even acknowledging us. Worth making the drive to the other location so you don't have to deal with the unbelievable service."}
{"text":"This has the greatest pizza... And I hate thin crust pizza with a passion! But this was the closest place in a new place so we gave it a try.. The pizza is so flavorful! I really can't express the greatness of this pizza it's easily 6 stars... Along with the host, he was so nice. The happy hour half price house wine would have been nice but she didn't ring it up correctly..

The only reason this review is not 5 stars is the service. I mean holy shit! I have never seen a waitress so unable to make eye contact or smile, let alone even consider making any small talk. She even took my water cup and didn't even ask if I wanted more.. 1.5 slices through our pizza she asks if we want a box... 10 min after it came out.. The place is. After we ordered desert she has someone else bring it out.. We were the only table. Then she drops of check I say thank you.. She walks away with out a word.. FYI I'm a great tipper min 20% this is the only time I will be leaving a shitty tip. We will get take out if we come back!"}
{"text":"Great Pizza. Can't say much else, I drove by one night last week and stopped to pick up a pizza for dinner. The crust was great, so was the sauce. This has become our new favorite pizza place."}
{"text":"I unfortunately have to downgrade my previous review.  My big complaint was that picking up the pizza to go was a big hassle.  You must pick up the pizza at the bar which is usually very crowded.  It was an annoyance, but tonight was the last straw.  The bar was completely full on a Thursday night around 7. I squeeze in by a little hallways that leads to the kitchen, people constantly squeezing by me.  I get handed just the check, no book or anything. I hand my card over which gets passed to the bartender to run.  He hands me my card back along with my copy and the store copy to sign.  No book to sign on, no space on the bar.  Myself along with another lady had to literally sign the paper on our hand.  I even mentioned that this was a terrible system to pick up food.  I got a reply that they only did it at the bar when it wasn't busy.  The place seemed pretty busy to me though.  I thought they built an area by the front to pick up orders, however I have never seen it used.  I guess it's too much hassle for them to walk to the back to get my check and pizza for me?"}
{"text":"Really good pizza, wings and wine. Lots of tv's for your viewing pleasure and a real neat outside seating area to enjoy the spring weather."}
{"text":"Found this place through Google offers and so happy we did. Maybe the best tasting pizza in Phoenix. They have buy 1 get 1 free on Tuesdays so you get 2 amazing pizzas for about $13. Don't miss this place."}
{"text":"Nice place and staff. Went in after our courthouse wedding and the server we had still remembers us years later. Good service and they bring the kids crust dough so they can make and bake a little appetizer while they wait."}
{"text":"This restaurant serves EXCELLENT pizza. The stuffed mushrooms are also delicious. I have had a few different pies here and each one is delicious. Great wine and beer selection too. Definitely will come here again."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza, especially the buffalo chicken.  I wish the menu had more to offer though...."}
{"text":"I went here for a first date. I've never been prior to the date. We shared chicken Alfredo. It was bad. It wasn't best Alfredo that I had either. I'm impartial about this place. I would go back a second time and try something different to see if I love or hate this place."}
{"text":"This place is a must try for happy hour. Their after work menu offers tons of great food options for screaming cheap! My husband and I ate like kings - ordered wings, two personal pizzas, artichoke dip, and a beer for him for under $33.

Good luck trying to get a table in the bar or on the patio during happy hour because it's pretty packed!"}
{"text":"Just ordered an Alfredo sauce pizza with ricotta on it in an effort to make it like a white pizza. For pick up.
Thought the place was cute.
By the time I got the pizza four minutes home it was cold which I thought was odd.
But that would have been fine except that the pizza had virtually no cheese on it what so ever.
I mean none.
It was like thin crust pizza well done with a THIN barely there later of cheese.
So much so that some bites didn't have cheese on them at all.
The rare bites that did have some ricotta on them were good but again, that's a stretch since it just wasn't enough.
The pizza was quite dry.
However, it was flavorful.
So I'm not sure if I should try them again and just ask for EXTRA cheese. Or maybe just tell them to actually put cheese on it.
Ha.
I'm disappointed because this place is 4 minutes from my house. 
And also because I paid 17 dollars for  dry bread with a thin layer of cheese on top.
I'll try them one more time one day."}
{"text":"Walked and we were seated quickly, hostess seemed a little put out as I looked around the restaurant, I had not visited since the space was occupied by Native New Yorker.  We sat and sat for well over ten minutes with no further acknowledgement from the staff. The place was not busy it was early in the evening. After another ten minutes of waiting we walked out. What a shame. I guess it is Spinatto's Pizza for dinner instead."}
{"text":"So, my husband and I have been to Upper Crust Pizza a couple of times now.  It is by far my favorite pizza place in town.  The meatball and Ricotta cheese pizza is to die for.   If you are looking for a pizza place to eat in north phoenix, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Enjoyed gluten pizza and other gluten free selections, pleasant clean environment, happy staff!"}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE!  My girls and I love coming here (close to home).  Andrew is our favorite waiter, he recognizes us, knows our favorites and treats us awesome!  We come back, always...and will continue!"}
{"text":"The pizza was really good. The beer and wine selection had some nice options. Im glad I tried this place I am always looking for a good pizza place.  The only thing I can suggest is maybe some customer service training for servers something is a little off with the staff."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this place a lot.  Of course when you are having fun with your friends, the places is even better.  It was our twin moms night out, so we had about 15 moms.  Good thing I decided to share not only my wine bottle but meals too.  Portions are insane.  The \"small\" calzone fed 3 moms and we had 2 pieces left.  We also shared the meatballs, they were very tasty and a Mediterranean Salad.  It was very good.  I will come back with my hubby for another great time."}
{"text":"Our first visit was on a Saturday around 830pm The place was not busy and it took awhile for someone to seat us. The service was ok. The pizza was very tasty and the wings were amazing! The second time we meet up with a friend for happy hour; enjoyed the 5 dollar pizza but no drink specials . Definitely will be back for the food!"}
{"text":"I actually located Upper Crust by doing a search of the area on Yelp. Once I read the reviews and saw that they were like Grimaldi's, I knew had to give it a whirl. 

I got there like an hour before closing on a Sun night and they were very gracious hosts. They didn't force us out or make us feel rushed at all. 

I can't give more stars because I didnt try the pizza yet. We just had drinks and an appetizer. But the service is 5-stars for sure!"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to go to Upper Crust, I will admit, because we had a coupon.  We live north of the 101 and there aren't very many places to choose from up here, we were excited at the opportunity to try a new place at a discounted price.  We received a coupon for 1 free dozen wings with the purchase of a large pizza and decided to give it a whirl.

We arrived around 6:45 on a Friday evening and decided to sit in the bar- the place was busy but there were still a few tables available.  We sat at a booth and were able to have privacy in addition to a view of plenty of televisions.  It took a little while for someone to come over and greet us but that is my only complaint about the whole experience.

I ordered a glass of a house red wine, on recommendation from the waitress and my husband got a bud light draft ( both were discounted because of a HH special that lasted til 7!!!).  We ordered wings as an app and they were FANTASTIC, as a side note a dozen without a coupon will run you  $6.00- which is nothing considering how large the wings were.  We had the honey hot, great flavor, good size, a lot of meat,  we will definitely order those again.

We then put our order for a large pizza (neither of us was that hungry anymore b/c of the wings but the coupon required the large) and the waitress even tried to down-sell us on the pizza, letting us know that their large is more than enough food for the two of us. We appreciated the consideration but had the coupon so ordered the large.  Our pizza had sausage, garlic, and pepperoni...and was fabulous.  The amount of sauce, meat etc was perfect and the dough was amazing.  My husband actually commented that the lady next to us wasn't eating her crust... he couldn't understand why she was wasting it when it tasted so good.  We ended up with extra slices to take home for leftovers and overall a great experience.

I highly recommend trying out Upper Crust, it's a nice local joint with good service, great food, and reasonable prices.... a combo that I think is hard to find!"}
{"text":"This place is a new favorite for me and my husband! We were due with our first baby and wanted to try a new restaurant for our last date without kids. We saw that it had awesome reviews and decided to try it out. We were NOT disappointed! They make their own mozzarella daily and you can tell; fantastic. We have been back multiple times. That staff has always been friendly and accommodating, they use iPads and iPhones to write down your orders. As far as the building, it's so cute and relaxed.  They have a lot of options when it comes to wine and beer. (They even have root beer on tap and a great root beer float I might add) Food wise: the personal pizzas are big enough for me to share with someone and the perfect amount for my husband to eat it on his own. Their pesto veggie pizza is to die for and their pepperoni is awesome as well. I liked building my own pizza too. I've also had their stuffed mushrooms (that have mozzarella, sausage, and some other stuff) and their antipasto salad which I will DEFINITELY have again next time.  This place is priced very reasonably, too! A great date night option!"}
{"text":"Loved the pizza here. I first tried their food at the Yelp pleY date event and it was delishious! Their meatball, ravioli, mozzerella cheese sampler at the event was awesome. I just had to come and check them out.

The pizza is not quite what I would call a thin crust, but the dough is not too thick either. I may just be trying to convince myself that pizza is good for you here, but does thinner crust = less carbs? I think so, and thats what I'm going with at least. 

All their pizza's come topped with their home made mozzerella, and I finished mine off with meatballs, which seemed like a good idea at the time. 

I was right! The meatball pizza is nothing less than super. They seem to have different daily specials. Swing by on a Tuesday for buy one get one free pizzas and bring home some 'za for tha family."}
{"text":"This place was really good- I'm surprised that I haven't been here sooner considering how close I live.  

Came here with my husband, son, sister, and nephew.  They had only been open for about 3 minutes when we came in so we were only the second patrons (plus it was 11 a.m. on a Sunday- no one goes for pizza at that time).  

A cool thing about this place is that they brought out a little pizza tray of dough for the kids to play with (complimentary) and popped it in the oven when they were done so that they could eat it later (like a bread stick).  Those didn't turn out so great- but the fun in it all is really just playing with the dough.

We ordered the large veggie pizza and it was amazing.  The crust is thin but can support the toppings, and the slices are large so you have to fold them in half.  So good, I will definitely be ordering that again.

We also ordered some boneless wings for the munchkins- I was unimpressed with them (in my experience boneless wings are breaded, but these weren't) but the ranch dressing that came with them were awesome.

We will be back for the pizza!"}
{"text":"This place is not something I'd ever come back to. First, the mozzarella sticks were in a egg shape and tasted really dry! Not worth the $8 I spent. The pizza was very thin and I don't like thin crust pizza so I didn't like it that much but if you like thin crust pizza you'll probably like it. The pizza was pretty dry too and was only meh. I wouldn't come back here since it's far from my house."}
{"text":"We love this restaurant.   The pizza is very good and they have delicious wings.  Service is always attentive and pleasant.   Recommend the strawberry spinach salad too."}
{"text":"Enjoyed Happy Hour here last night. The $3 house red was great, as were the bruschetta and small pizzas. Server was extremely busy but still personable and provided good service. It was a nice place to spend a Friday evening."}
{"text":"So good!   We started with the spinach dip and super hot wings and they was a perfect start.  The dip was full of flavor and the soft bread triangles served with it were perfect!  The wings were excellent, they brought the heat, which was exactly what we wanted.  I had an antipasto salad and it was over the top fresh.  Love the fresh mozzarella!  We also had a sausage stromboli that was excellent.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"First time here, tried two types of wings, mozzarella and marinara, antipasto salad, 4 types of pizza, all were very good. There were 17 of us, efficient service."}
{"text":"To start couldn't get seated because my whole party wasn't there even though there was an empty restaurant. Than three of the four people ordered beer and server said \"Sorry to be a dick but can I check your guys ID\" (Christopher was our server) Beers took forever to get to the table, overall horrible service! Food on the other hand was pretty good, love the fact that they use real mozzarella for there pizza.But our server rang in the wrong pizza than proceeded to blame it on the kitchen saying the kitchen is slammed and made the wrong pizza (again we where the only people in the restaurant) Stuffed Mushrooms where not the greatest thing, short on seasoning and bland. Would definitely not recommend this place..."}
{"text":"Great beer great food great wifi and good people. This place is a gem. Love the meatball sliders! Great for lunch and dinner, nice crowd but nice too busy either."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times my problems were with the service. We went there yesterday. When we got there the place was pretty dead yet we had to eventually walk into the bar area to get service to be seated. Ok, no biggie. I asked our server what their \"house white\" was. He had no clue... went to ask... came back about 5 min later stating no one in the back had any idea and that it was \"just a blend\"- but of what they have no idea. I'm not a huge wine snob so I ordered a different glass which took about 10 more min for our drinks to come back. Now mind you, the place was dead so not sure why it took so long. After waiting about 30 more minutes after placing our order of a house salad and bruschetta appetizers I inquired about where our food was. He said he just checked and had an issue with the computer so the order was not placed. He was very apologetic which I appreciate but at this point I was pretty irked as he could have noticed this a bit earlier. We placed our credit card on the table (you know the universal sign of you're done and want to leave) and he walked by multiple times without picking it up. Eventually I flagged him down and we got out of there. I see all the great reviews and really want to like this place because it's right near my house but am disappointed every time. I highly doubt I will ever go back to the regular restaurant,  maybe I'll try the happy hour but I'm not too comfortable drinking a wine that no one has any clue as to even what kind of blend it is. *Sigh*"}
{"text":"Awesome place and the owner was amazing, involved with the flow of the restaurant checking on tables. Definitely will be back! Try the meatballs, they are amazing!!"}
{"text":"One of the only local places that carry my favorite local micro brews! Plus they have multiple TV with the football games on. Try the stuffed mushrooms- best thing I have ever had!"}
{"text":"The pizza here is top notch.  Family style Italian food which is all good.
Have a decent selection of beers on tap and the wine selection seems varied (not a wine lover).
Has a NY type feel and the staff are friendly.
Decent size bar and a patio for the cooler weather.
-1 star for a pizza we got to go that was cold."}
{"text":"Wow!  Sampled the ravioli and meatballs during Yelp's Ultimate pleydate event.  I wanted more and will make my way to the restaurant to fulfill my desire.

I didn't wait long to go to the restaurant after trying the samples.  Went the next night.  We ordered meatballs and the stuffed ravioli as well as a pizza topped with artichoke and garlic.  Everything was very fresh and tasted wonderful.  The manager and our server, Ivan, told us why: They make everything from scratch.  Even the mozzarella is in-house.  This is not your typical pizzeria.

We had the cheesecake with strawberry sauce and it was VERY good.  Rich and the sauce is, again, made from fresh ingredients.  The menu has a number of items we want to try and we will be returning to do so."}
{"text":"We were headed for Johnnies's Pizza for an early dinner (kids go to bed at 6:30) but found they were closed for the long July 4th holiday weekend. Having had a positive experience at Upper Crust previously, we decided to take our girls here.

One would think walking into a restaurant at 4:30 with only one other occupied table would equal prompt and abundant service, right?

Uh, no.

Cold-ish pizza and a spicy kids pasta (weird - because the marinara we had with the mozzarella wasn't spicy) kinda sealed the deal: we won't be back. 

Too bad. 

While cold, the Margherita pizza WAS tasty."}
{"text":"I did not stay, I was extremely disappointed to find out you had to be over 21 to sit on the patio at 6pm. I had my 12 year old with me and it was a beautiful night and the inside atmosphere couldn't compare to being outside. I've never heard of such a policy and couldn't justify staying."}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza - thin, buttery crust,  not swimming in cheese or sauce! Speaking of sauce, theirs is a simple tomato sauce with seasoning added on top of the toppings. Made for some awesome bites - mild seasoning or simple sauce, or both - loved it!

Hubby and I shared their \"small\" Mediterranean salad.  Excellent dressing, not overly seasoned,  letting the olives, tomatoes, cucumbers,  and red onions show thru with that yummy feta cheese!  Well done! 

Plus,  hubby was happy, they serve Sierra Nevada!"}
{"text":"I've had a consistently good experience at Upper Crust and would definitely say that it's the best pizza place in the North Phoenix area. Plus, it's super convenient right off the 101 and Cave Creek Rd. Many days I call in or order a pizza or wings or whatever to pick up on my way home since there just aren't many options up in Cave Creek.

Just blew my non-gluten-free friend away with upper crust gluten free pizza! Also a bottle of Rambauer chardonnay half off (on Wednesdays)?! Yes!

They have a pretty good variety of gluten free options if you're into that - but I don't know how good they are about cross contamination. Since I'm just gluten sensitive I don't really need to worry about that.

The restaurant is split into the bar area and the sit down restaurant, so you can choose your experience. The bar area gets pretty crowded for happy hour! But the restaurant is completely fine if you have kids. There's even a pretty nice outdoor patio area (really nice if you consider this is like a strip mall) for great Arizona evenings. 

Great wine selection, pizza, appetizers, location, service... and a cool atmosphere - what else could you want? I've found the service in both the bar and restaurant to always be fantastic. They also make their own Sangria if you're into that. Personally, I do the sparkling wine splits when I'm alone. But I like a little fancy in my day."}
{"text":"Upper crust has great pizza and wings. Also take out and just the same when you get it home ;) wish they delivered !"}
{"text":"My review is on the take out service. I have not dined in yet. I always crave this pizza. It is the best in the area, hands down. Great togo service. The lady even asked me if I wanted plates. I think she read my mind! (I was low on plates and just ran the dishwasher) great little place. Keep it up"}
{"text":"I'm so disappointed in this place. I wanted to try this place so bad and I even called my order in super early to make sure they had time to get it right. 

I ordered carry out. Starting with a Caesar salad, they picked half the veggies off of another salad to give me. No cheese, croutons or dressing. Then a large pizza, extra sauce and extra cheese, my pizza had very little.  Pizza was cold despite me giving them a specific time a pick up would be made. I didn't pick it up or I would have looked at it and had it all remade or refunded. 

I'm so tired of not getting what I ordered and at the desired temperature."}
{"text":"We've had slow service and not so great service before, but nothing as bad as today.  We were in the bar area for 9 minutes and nobody acknowledged us (there were 2 tables and about 6 guys drinking @ the bar) so we walked into the dining area thinking that would be better.  We waited another 8 minutes...2 waiters CLEARLY saw us and didn't say a word and had 2 small tables.  Finally we got up to leave and my husband asked one of them why the service was so bad.  His excuse was, \"we don't have a hostess today\".  What does that matter?   Then he asked to speak to a manager...guess what?   They have no manager either.  The guy never apologized or took any responsibility.  He only said, \"well I can wait on you now.\". We will never ever ever waste our money here again.  Not when there are so many other pizza and wing places nearby."}
{"text":"Was recommended by a friend who frequents this place. Went in with my family no one was there to seat us, place was almost empty so we just grabbed a table. After 5 minutes of not seeing a server we left. Dissapointed, called manager \"Scott\" to let him know, sounded like he just woke up."}
{"text":"I'm compelled to write this after having dinner here last night.  I ordered the house blend but was informed they were out. I said ok let me have 2 glasses of wine X. On my second glass they came back and said they were out of that wine also. I said ok give me what you have of the Pino Nior.  Now the problem I am having is that the bill comes with prices for wine that I had no intention of purchasing when I arrived. I asked if they could adjust the bill downward a little to offset the cost a bit.   I was informed that they would check and returned telling us that there was nothing that could be done. This is where I have a problem.  There was no possibility of taking anything off the price or as I suggested was to give it to us at the price of what they ran out of?  This apparently @ 830 pm new years eve half hour before closing was to much to ask for. Paying $72 + tip for a pizza, salad and a few glasses of wine is excessive for me and my wife. Pizza was good. Just can't handle the nothing I can do for you..  In this day and age, there is always something that can be done to get your customers to return. Now not so sure. Arena's would have taken something off the bill. Call me picky."}
{"text":"Probably some of the best pizza and wings you will find. Happy hour prices are awesome. Great service either in bar or restaurant. Only knock I will give it is sometimes in the bar they play top 40 teeny bopper music. Considering the average age of the clientele is about 40 years old let's just stick to country or classic rock."}
{"text":"Great fresh sauce and spicy pepperoni.  Mozzarella tasted handmade and crust had the right thickness.  Good pie."}
{"text":"I used to be here 1-2 nights a week a couple years ago then stopped going for no real reason. Went back tonight and the place has slipped for sure. Bartenders never asked if we wanted peppers/Parmesan with our pizza then automatically gave them to the couple next to us and they had to be waved down every time the glasses were empty. Smh. Not a bad place but not great either. Costco is next door and I may just have their pizza next time."}
{"text":"This was our second visit to Upper Crust.  It's located at the SE corner of Cave Creek & 101 in a nice suite that seems to be cursed for some reason...  First, there was Native Yorker (serially successful in the Valley across many locations)... After a few years, they gave up here and Brick Yard (a nice sports bar) took over the spot.  Just a few months later, that was over.

In the last year, Upper Crust moved in.  Our first visit, shortly after they opened, was not great, but showed promise.  The wings were average, and the pizza was straight up soggy in the middle.  However, you could tell the ingredients were good and it was reminiscent of Grimaldi's (same style, almost the same crust...).  The salad was... well... FRIGGIN' AWESOME.  Simple romaine, tomatoes, cucumbers, red onions, and kalamato olives topped with nice feta tossed in a simple vinegarette.  I'm not sure what kind of olive oil they use, but it was just perfect.  Just the right amount of dressing with a perfect balance of the buttery olive oil and tangy red wine vinegar.  Maybe a bit too much feta, but damn... it was good.  The pizza was much improved.  The center was still just a bit on the soft side, but as before the ingredients seemed top notch and the sauce was just right.

Happily, we can say that the kinks appear to be working out.  Tonight, we had a couple beers, a small Mediterranean salad (they say it serves 1-2, but as a first course, it's more like 3-4), and a 16\" w/ onions, mushrooms, and sausage.  

The atmosphere is casual, but a bit on the quiet side (sad to say, it was probably because the restaurant was about 1/2 full on a Saturday night).  They retained all the TV's and sports programming from the Brick Yard/Native New Yorker days, but don't crank up the volume, so it's a bit unique, but cool.

The service is pleasant and earnest (admittedly, our server seemed a bit inexperienced and awkward, but effort was all there).

We'll be making an effort to visit more often (gotta hit the neighborhood places a bit more...).  

Really, this place is just an over upgrade away from being right on par with Grimaldi's and the prices are bit better."}
{"text":"Was really excited to try this place but should of read the reviews about no kids on the patio before we stopped by.  Bummer."}
{"text":"We went here bout a month ago... Sat in bar. Order gf pizza n wings. Server was great. Cool personality talking w us n table next too.  Pizza was fabulous... Being gluten free that is huge bonus!!   Reminds me... Think we will revisit today!!  ;))"}
{"text":"I've decided to change my rating of this place from 3 to 4 stars... some time has passed and I've been 3 more times now. I've noticed a nice improvement to the speed of service at this place. The food has always been good it was just lacking service before and now I'm much happier here. 
The bar staff is really nice as well. I wanted to say \"great job\" to the staff here for improving and bringing this place back up to what it should be!
The large pizza is a good deal at $13 and is very tasty with a nice thin crust and fresh cheese and toppings."}
{"text":"I am so disappointed in the experience myself and friend had last night. He was so excited about taking me here because he said the pizza was some of the best he had ever had and he knew how much I like trying new places. 

We arrived at around 9pm and it wasn't busy. We were greeted nice enough and asked if we wanted to sit in the main seating area or the bar area. We choose the bar area so that we could also watch highlights of the game. We got a booth, the waiter in the next booth over saw us sit down so it wasn't like no one knew we were there. A waiter took care of a table two tables behind us and another waiter took care of a table that was seated one table to our right. Again nothing. We even watched as 3 waiters congregate around a table to chat it up but again nothing. After 15 mins we decided to leave. Yea we waited 15 mins. My friend was more disappointed then I was only because he felt that he had talked them up and he felt like he let me down. I told him no worries as it was there loss. I was there to hang out with him anyway. The pizza would have just been a bonus. 

Will I be back?  Probably not anytime soon. I wish I could say that it was because they were so busy. Oh well."}
{"text":"Just another nice friendly place to meet my family at for a GREAT dinner. Food is wonderful, wait staff is outstanding. We always feel welcome. Thank You, Tony"}
{"text":"I have only sat at the bar here, and haven't eaten anything here.  Because I'm a whisky girl, I think the whisky choices are limited.  I did enjoy the company of the bar tender here, as he was able to not only make good recommendations on beer based on what I like, but carry on a conversation as well.  I came in late and it wasn't very busy, but I would assume that was only because it was so late.  I think the choice in music played here was terrible. It's all pop. Not even close to a mix that would appeal to more people. If the music had been better I might have given an additional star."}
{"text":"If I could give this restaurant zero stars I would. I ordered a large margarita pizza to go and a salad. My husband went to pick it up. Little did I know I need to tell my husband the order because they would charge for the items and not give him the correct things. I called and spoke to a young boy. Instead of the manager (April) coming to the phone to handle the situation she would tell him what to say which was tell them to come back to the store to either pick up the salad THEY forgot to include in the order or to come back to the store to get a credit. Ridiculous customer service! April the manager never came to the phone once and to make matters worse I ordered a margarita pizza that came with no basil. Horrible horrible customer service. Don't order from them ever."}
{"text":"I am not sure why we returned to this place.  Our last visit, we up and walked out.  We thought this time we would give it a shot.  They have a great price on Happy Hour chicken wings.  Well, we walk in with our 13 year old and are told that we can ONLY get the happy hour price if we sit in the bar area, BUT it is 21 and over.  Being that we want to have wings at the happy hour price, we ask if we can just sit on the restaurant side.  Not allowed.  10 feet away in the bar, wings are one price, but in the restaurant they are FULL price.  Great way to drive away business.  We are sure to never visit this establishment again.    Horrible business plan"}
{"text":"I didn't give it five stars because there is a slight chance there maybe better pizza out there, but I doubt it."}
{"text":"Moved here from Pittsburgh PA. a few weeks ago. Was afraid that I lost my local pies and Stromboli's. I've had many chooses to chose from in the valley, but Steve and his staff, Have done me right on more then one occasion. He has got me business hands down. 

Thanks upper crust.
.        Mark and Lisa"}
{"text":"DH & I went to Upper Crust for Happy Hour. We had a pizza and wings, which were on happy hour specials. The pizza was good, similar to the grimaldi's style. The wings were a one star. The ambiance was a little dark, could use some color. Lots of TV's to watch any game were available."}
{"text":"We normally love this place. 

We saw a roach in the bathroom and when we asked to speak to the manager the waitress said: \"we don't really have a manager\" 

This is my last time coming here. 

- former regulars."}
{"text":"Placed an order online, received a confirmation number and was told a 20 minute wait. When we went to pick up our order they said they forgot to start the ticket, so we had to stand there and wait while they made it. What is the point of ordering online if you won't even start the order? They offered no apologies."}
{"text":"We have been coming here since we moved in this area.  We stopped going as a regular because of lack of service and quality.  Tonight we went in again and \"LEONA\" met us at the door and wasn't happy we requested a booth that was in her section I guess (maybe she was on the way out the door). Seriously, her greeting to our table was \"DRINKS?\" I said \"drinks what?\" Are you kidding me? Then she was upset because we were trying to pick out a bottle of wine and walked away while not saying anything.  No water nothing while we were going to order a nice wine.... To say the least - I will NEVER return! The food is less than average and the staff are inadequate and impolite.  LEONA should wear a name tag that says \"I hate my job and could care less of guests that pay my paycheck.\" Reputation owns up to the service and poor quality.  Pass! Go 8 minutes away to Times Square Neighborhood Italian restaurant! Great service great food and just about 8-10 minutes away from this location.  Seriously Upper Crust absolutely SUCKS. Keep driving by!  You won't be satisfied - or waste your time by getting up and leaving after 10 minutes."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best pizza spot in AZ.  I have spent the last 8 years trying to find the best pizza in AZ as I am from Cali.  This is it!  The pizza is fantastic. My children love it too.  Not many spots where both the kids and parents are happy with the food.  We recommend this spot to everyone we can.

I have to add that the chicken wings are amazing.  I do not eat chicken wings anywhere, but here.  They are that good!"}
{"text":"My family and I came to Upper Crust after receiving a free pizza card from Yelp's playdate.  It was a pretty long drive for us, but well worth it.  We had good service.  We asked the server what she suggested and she said that the mozzarella was a must.  I always ask for suggestions, but normally still order what I originally wanted.  This time I listened.  I am so glad that I did.  The fried mozzarella was wonderful!  I would order it again.  It was sooo fresh!  We also ordered the mushrooms which were ok.  The pizza looked beautiful, but it tasted ok...it needed a tad bit more marinara.  I would go back."}
{"text":"This place is over priced and they nickel & dime you. Although their wings were good, and the quality was what I'd expect--- it is not worth the money. There is far too much competition to put up with this. Based on the fact we were 1 of only 3 couples eating there--I'd say others are catching on and taking their business else where. If Upper Crust want to stick around another year, I'd suggest lowering their pricing/profits. We will not be going back unless the prices are dropped."}
{"text":"Great pizza place. 
Came here for a celebratory dinner and drink and requested to sit on the patio so I could watch the sunset. 

All was great until a group of older men began hitting on me, sitting at my table, smoking asking to buy me a drink etc. Though I politely declined they were extremely persistent to the point where another table when inside to bring the issue to my waitresses attention. They were asked to leave and the manager came out and personally apologized for their conduct, which I thought was very sweet. 

The pizza was perfect, the sauce wasn't too sweet and then have gluten free options! I ordered a small Gluten Free Buffalo Chicken pizza and was not disappointed. It wasn't too spicy and hot as some buffalo pizza's can be, the blue cheese that gets melted on top was a great compliment to the buffalo sauce. 

I ordered dessert and had the Monster Mud Pie. It was a little frozen so I had to wait a bit for it to melt, which wasn't very long in the AZ sun the wine pairing I had with it, Los Vascos, completed the whole experience.

I will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Upper crust serves a thin crust New York style pizza.
I have been going here for a long time and I am surprised I still get tricked into going there when I get pizza cravings.
The pizza is great when it is made correctly. I ordered a pizza with sausage, pepperoni, ricotta, and basil. Honestly not even a pizza. It was basically a focaccia. There was only one piece of pizza that had sausage, barely any ricotta.There is barely any sauce or cheese leaving the whole pizza with 4 inches of crust. I don't know if it's the owners being ridiculously cheap or just a bad pizza cook. This has been happening a lot over the last couple years. 
I also wouldn't get the basil, it will not be fresh. Also if you get take out then take the, \"it will be ready in 15 minutes\" with a huge grain of salt. Takes 40 minutes every time. Unfortunately the only thing that is good there are their calzones. I really don't like how this place is being operated and I left feeling taken advantage of by the lack of ingredients on the pizza. Give me what I paid for please."}
{"text":"We've gone here on occasion for the delicious pizza (add feta too!) but recently came with a big group for a birthday party. The young teens said it was \"fancy\" with linens and glassware. Not the usual local pizza place in your community. Go check it out!"}
{"text":"We stopped in at Upper Crust a couple weeks ago and had an exceptional evening. The cozy restaurant was packed, but the receptionist took the time to find us a nice booth near the back. The owner stopped by and couldn't have been nicer. The food was superb and the wine was half priced. The establishment also has a separate bar and patio....something for everyone. This gem is right off the freeway. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Love their pizza!! I have gone here with large groups as well as on a date. The service is great, they never run out of anything, and it's cozy and clean."}
{"text":"I was a little shocked at the appearance of the pizza. Granted, I got it to go. But it had white cheese and was super thin. It tasted \"ok.\" I'm sure I'll go back bc the have a great pino...but I'll probably order the wings."}
{"text":"I'm lazy. I'm lazy and I like wine. What I really like is to be lazy on patios that I don't have to clean up while I drink wine. Therefore, I have found a new happy place. 

Ironically, we didn't sit on the outside patio as we had my daughter with us and the patio is 21 and over. I was bummed out but am sure the euphoria that will be induced by lounging with wine sans kids anywhere near me at a future time will make it all better. 

Our waitress was adorable and explained that she can take our order with her iPhone and that, no, she wasn't texting. Cool technology, people. We ordered the fried mozzarella after she explained it wasn't like lame fried pieces of string cheese. Oh, she steered us down a happy path. The mozzarella is fresh house made and it was wrapped in thin pizza dough and fried. If I could married it, I would have. The marinara dipping sauce was spicy and tasty. My kid hogged all the cheesy goodness. Damn her. 

Next, the three of us shared the small fettuccine with meat sauce with a few meatballs thrown in for good measure. Didn't feel like pizza but that looked REALLY good. The pasta was a little over cooked. More mushy than al dente. That's why they only get four stars. The sauce was yummy and the meatballs were freaking awesome. They had great flavor and held together really well. Personally, I would have dunked them in sauce and then served them. Just serving them baked, no sauce, made them seem dry. 

Boyfriend and I had a glass of Pinot each and the bill came to $40, and we had a $10 off coupon. Pretty sweet. Perfect amount of food. We'll definitely be back. The staff is lovely and so is the atmosphere. Looking forward to some unpretentious wine patio lounging."}
{"text":"Order To Go...12 mild wings, 12 bbq wings, great tasting. However, i will go with medium, needs more fire. 
The only thing i want to mention is, their are the drumettes and wing parts, right? 
out of the 24 wings, there was 5 drummettes and the rest was wings. I eat the wing parts and my Alex like the dummettes. We perfer it to be more equal since we are sharing. 
We have never eating here but the ambience on the patio looks very comfortable.
Maybe next time we will have to try that before it gets to warm out."}
{"text":"Upper Crust is one of my favorite restaurants!  I am a regular!  The food and staff are amazing!  Miranda is always our waitress and she is awesome.  Has my drink always arriving shortly after I sit dowm!"}
{"text":"Happy Hour is one of the best in town. Drink & food specials are amazing.... huge problem with place is they are not family friendly. I really wish they would let kids in bar area at least until 6pm OR they should have same HH specials in Dining area. We went with family, not allowed in large bar area. Sat in main restaurant, prices were way too high for a family with 2 small kids at 5pm. We eat out all the time, this is the only restaurant we been to in the valley that doesn't honor HH specials in main dining area or let kid's in bar area. Chilis even lets kids in bar area!!!
Main dining room  is dead during HH, hmmmm I wonder why? Management / owners need to get with the times... missing out on a lot of cash From catering to families who are looking for early cheap dinners. Parents drink, they don't understand this....HH specials in main restaurants  will brings them in. 

BTW Honey hot/extreme wings are awesome & so are the meatball app."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Wldnt honor a postcard we received months before Halloween because we didn't keep it. No where on it did it say this was a coupon that wld need to be presented, it was a post card that's it. Will be taking our pizza orders somewhere else, they left us in a jam with guests over. Upper crust doesn't apparently need any more customers."}
{"text":"When I was a kid, I used to look forward to Friday night pizza parties at the local pizza parlor. Since moving to Arizona, I haven't found many pizza parlors here that mirror my childhood experience. That is, until I found Upper Crust. Upper Crust sneaks up on you. Literally. It's located in a small strip mall just off of the 101 and Cave Creek Road but the second you walk inside, it's a whole little sports bar/pizza parlor experience. To the right of the restaurant sits a dining room complete with red checkered tablecloths and family style tables. To the left sits a bar with at least a dozen flat screen TVs, several high top tables and a large bar top. It's the perfect spot to watch a game. 

The pizza is outstanding. It's large and in charge! One slice is probably the size of 2-3 regular size pizzas. It's thin crust with soft bread, gooey cheese and any toppings you want. This is the ideal Friday night pizza. If you're ever in the area, visit this hidden gem for some delectable pizza!"}
{"text":"We have lived down the street from this place for a couple years but have never tried it until the other day.  We were very pleasantly surprised.  Our waiter recommended the fried mozzerella (he said they make their own) so we tried it and it was pretty good.  I'd say Maggiano's does it better, but Upper Crust's was definitely above average.  We also split alfredo pasta and a small pizza.  The alfredo sauce was really good, and the pizza was surprisingly good as well considering it hardly had any cheese on it.  The crust was thin and very flavorful.  The only negative is the crust was a little soggy and it does not reheat well.  We will definitely go again."}
{"text":"We sat inside as it was a rainy day but probably would have anyways.  I like how it has the family side and the 21 and older side even though there was a baby in the bar (Benjamin button)?  The place has the ambience of a retro pizza place with the checkered table clothes.  Our server was magnificent and had the best server personality (not too much taking but personable.  We had wings, mushroom and onion pizza.  The wings were phenomenal tons of meat.  The pizza was alright.  We would go back and check out a happy hour."}
{"text":"Revising this review from 2 stars to 4...we gave this place a few more tries and have been happy all those visits. Maybe we just hit them in a busy time or someone was having a rough day. Great food, service is good (better) and it's super close to our house so it's convenient. Pizza is great, salads are ridiculously large. Worth the price!! 

PREVIOUS REVIEW:  The pizza is delicious here, especially the thin crust. Only giving two stars though because the service is not great. We've only ordered pick up from here so I can't comment on the wait staff but the last time we ordered, my husband drove down about 15 minutes after we placed our order. He then had to wait another 20-25 minutes for our food because they forgot to make it. To make matters worse, when he got home we found there was no salad dressing for the salad we ordered. Very frustrating to say the least. Again, great pizza....but we won't be back and won't recommend this place to our friends."}
{"text":"The boyfriend and I were big fans! We came after finding them at a Yelp event with a free pizza certificate. Assuming it was for a personal size, we were shocked we could order a large so we did! The boyfriend was impressed with the beers on tap and happy watching three games at once in HD. I was really impressed with our server Jonathan. He was fantastic and knowledgable. He had the chef slice some mozzarella made in house so I could revive some Bronx little Italy memories. It was not quite there but I was really impressed by the effort. The ravioli with meat sauce was quite good. We can't wait to try the lasagna next time! As for pizza, the peperoni was more impressive than the margarita but both fared well and I cannot wait for leftovers!"}
{"text":"If the service was as good as the food, this would be a 5 star review. For being a slow Friday night, our waitress seemed to be really distracted by somebody in the bar area to the point that our first drinks was bad and we had a bus boy bring us two more drinks without our waitress noticing. About 15 minutes later, she checked up on us and noticed we was missing the marinara sauce and our drinks. The lack of attention from our waitress is unbelievable. The food is awesome and that's what keeps us coming back. 

Still horrible service. And now the food is almost at bad as the service"}
{"text":"Have frequented this place several times and felt it was time to give a review. 

 I have noticed the last few visits that my pizza is burned black around the crust and/or doughy and limp in the middle so inconsistent baking here folks!  Ordered a calzone last night and it was bland, no garlic AT ALL and the dough was limp and the filling all kept falling out - not a true calzone!  

My biggest gripe about this place is the revamped pick-up and take-out process. You have to walk into the bar, jump up and down to get noticed to let them know you are there to get your order, be made to feel like you are interrupting the staff be being there, play cat and mouse trying to stay out of the way of everyone while you are backed up to a wall next to the bar waiting for an ungracious server to bring you your meal.  Then you play a balancing act trying to hold the bill and pen in hand to sign the receipt which you can't see because you are in a dark corner. I've decided not to return after the rude manner in which I was treated by the staff last night and I know they get a large part of biz from take-out.  Better re-think this part of the process there, I'm sure other patrons do not return for the same reasons.  Go back to bringing take-out the the front hostess stand on the restaurant side of the place like you used to and make even your PAYING take-out customers feel appreciated!"}
{"text":"The manager Alan, was amazingly helpful getting us a catering tray of pasta for our Soccer team dinner. Our other place had fell thru and Alan had it ready for pick up in 45 minutes. So glad it worked out. Will definitely come here first next time! Great place!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and the meatballs are to die for. I ordered the salad which was gigantic btw, everything all around is great  here"}
{"text":"Great place for a good pizza and a drink. Indoor on the family side or next door in the bar. They have a great patio as well. 

Basic pizza and Italian food menu, including salads. 

I had the personal sized pizza and it was excellent. VERY VERY Grimaldis type. Thin, nice sauce, great crust and ample Mozz cheese. 

I ate the entire thing. $ 8 for the cheese add $1 for the Pep. $9 lunch meh.. a little expensive.  Share a large with 4 people. LOL

Staff was great, nice and friendly. I wish the owner would have been a little more proactive at meeting his customers. :(

Prices on the drinks seem steep. I doubt I would go just to have a few drinks.

Next to the Coffee place in the Costco shopping center. North west side of the complex facing Cave Creek."}

{"text":"Great pizza. This is one of the best places in this part of town in my opinion. I have eaten hear a number of times from business lunches to dinners out with the family. The servers are always happy and they are quick too. The food comes out piping hot and the aroma as soon as you enter this place knocks you out. They can accomodate larger groups as well."}
{"text":"Upper Crust is a neighborhood pizza joint that serves up a New York style pizza.  They have a full bar next that serves up some nice craft brew, but also some nice tasting whiskey (Johnny Blue).  

We had a large group of patrons that attended with over 20 people.  Service was on the ball with as many of guest that we had.  

I went for a glass of Chanti and ordered the meat trio pizza to share with my friends.  The pizza we ordered was large and all 18 inches was overwhelming for just 3 of us!  I went for the first bite; my take is the ingredients pepperoni, Italian sausage, and meatballs were pretty basic tasting and could probably order from another place and wouldn't know the difference.  The crust was a tad bit burnt, but that didn't bother me too much.  My friends ordered their wings and antipasto plate which they seemed to enjoy; either that or they could have been really hungry.

In the end, I didn't really care for the pizza; too basic.  The service was on top of things and the ambiance is really family friendly with a minor sports bar feel with the TV screens hanging from the walls.  If I needed sustenance of pizza for a quick bite then I would shoot for this place, otherwise I'll carry on. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Who said that Pizzeria Bianco is the best in Phoenix...what more the country??!  

They obviously haven't found Upper Crust Pizza yet!
It took us a while to make it here as it is out of our downtown Scottsdale neighborhood, where there are plenty of great choices of restaurants.  But at the suggestion of a friend we finally worked in a stop on the way home from up north.

So...My parents are from Brooklyn and now my son lives there, so we have had some \"real\" pizza and this beats most of them!  Thank you for bringing good real pizza to Phoenix.

And the service!  Not sure if we got lucky but our waitress, I think her name was Laura, could not have been better.  She got us everything we wanted on the first try...and we never had to look around trying to track her down for service like so many places.  Thank you! 

So if you are looking for good real Brooklyn pizza at a reasonable price..try out this place which isn't really that far out of the way as it is right near the 101 and Cave Creek.

...and hopefully Laura (?) will be there to serve you!"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to take our 3 kids here for an early dinner and happy hour on a Thursday at 4pm. After we had gotten settled into our tiny booth, we asked the waiter for a happy hour menu. Well apparently happy hour is only in the lounge area, which you have to be 21 to enter, even in the middle if the afternoon. So we got up and left. 

They definetly arent family/kid friendly, why should I have to pay more for my drink juat because im with my kids and have to sit in the 'restaurant' side. Also the tables and booths are tiny. A heavier person could not fit in a booth. If we go back, it wont be with the family."}
{"text":"Killer Wednesday night wine deal: all bottles 1/2 price.  When was the last time you sipped on a ZD Cab?  Never, right, the thing is $70-80.  But for $35, not a bad splurge!

Cute server, tasty, fresh food, sweet patio ambience"}
{"text":"My second visit was far more positive. The wings were just wonderful no disappointment there and the pizza was great also. I had a wonderful glass of cider. The service was great! The owner/manager arrived at our table so we could compliment him on his high standards. Why only four stars? 
As we were leaving one of the wait staff was standing right by the entrance SMOKING! YUK! Mr Steve please direct your staff to the rear of the building to indulge in their disgusting habit, so I don't get smoke full in my face as I leave. Thank you"}
{"text":"The first time we went, the place had been opened for a week. Food was average. Nice neighborhood joint. We had a server that was clueless and ruined the experience for us. I gave them some slack because it was opening week, but the server had no idea of the beers they served. We decided to give them another shot a month later, the service was great, but the food was still not that great. For some reason they season the food with quite a bit of salt in everything, which really ruins the flavor. We tried two pizzas which came out undercooked and the lasagna which was ok minus the insane amount of salt and being burnt on the bottom.
Great ambience for a drink, but the pizzas, pastas are not that great."}
{"text":"Such a Shame! My family and I go to upper crust all the time and when I say all the time, I mean we know the servers by name. Tonight we had a really unfortunate situation, and I understand mistakes are made but the way it was handled was unprofessional. The pizza and wings are great but this place has gone down hill in the last couple of years or so. It's always empty and I can't imagine with the service and lack of management this place will stay open much longer. Hire managers, make the customers happy and hire friendly staff that want to be there!"}
{"text":"Yum! Started with the spinach dip and it was delish. The crust on the pizza is awesome, as well as the meatballs! Caution-huge portions!! Plenty to share!"}
{"text":"Come here all the time for happy hour cuz there's plenty of good options. I usually just go with the wings tho such a good deal. The servers are always friendly and hook it up with whatever you need but im usually chillin at the bar watching sports!"}
{"text":"I've only ever ordered take-out since this place is right around the corner. The pizza here is decent. Thin, chewy, quality cheese, good crust. I wish they would come out with combo pizzas instead of having to pay individually for each topping. $2 per topping is too much for, say, a penny's worth of garlic or 25 cents of mushroom... especially considering sausage is the same price as veggies. I never understand places that price this way. Just put a veggie pizza on the menu! 

Their wings are awesome though. Ever since they graciously gave us a free order for having to wait a while picking up on our first time trying the place, I've been hooked. I have to have them, and then wind up eating all the wings and leaving the pizza to the fiance."}
{"text":"Both times I've been here I've had a good time.  The food is excellent, the atmosphere as well.

One side caters to the breeding crowd, while they have a bar side which I've visited.  I've enjoyed bellying up to the bar and being greeted quickly by a bartender, even if they were busy helping someone else.

The wings when I tried them were crispy!  It's a refreshing feeling to bite into the skin and feel the crunch yet find the meat is still tender.

The pizza was delicious.  I recommend the buffalo chicken pizza.  It's got a blue cheese sauce to it that compliments it nicely.  Furthermore, their beer selection is large enough to make me happy, including a few micro brews around here that go well with the menu.

I suggest if you find yourself on the north side of Phoenix to make the trip.  It's well worth it!"}
{"text":"I recently moved to this area and I was excited to try this place. I was not disappointed in the slightest. Their pizza might just be the best in Phoenix, the sauce is extremely flavorful and the crust is perfect. Mike and Alan in the bar are awesome dudes. Ive already made this one of my regular spots."}
{"text":"Favorite pizza place in Phoenix.  The ingredients they use are noticeably superior.  Thin crust always, you aren't paying for bread here!
I haven't tried everything here tho."}
{"text":"This place has the best pizza.
We usually eat in and that is a good thing as the take out can be cold before it gets home.
They have a decent selection of beers and wine and the service is good.
As a family dining place we like to bring our out of town families and friends!"}
{"text":"Before I leave upper crust I needed to write this review... Ruben was very attentive.  The food on the other hand not so much.  Sausage, mushroom and cheese  calzone large.. very large, wish I could have tasted the sausage.  That didn't sound good.  Creme brûlée burnt sugar, the creme was soup vs solid.  The bottle of wine couldn't even make this meal work."}
{"text":"Okkkkk I just found this gem of a place ..... food is amazing ..I had the Mediterranean salad .. added chicken . Also the BBQ chicken pizza .... oh and don't let me forget to tell you about the margarita (yummmm) they use fresh lime! Please check the place out ... good happy hour . Plus had the game on :) lastly wonderful staff."}
{"text":"YUMMMMM! 
The atmosphere is so comfortable, I especially love the patio area where we like to enjoy a glass of wine and a couple of appetizers. The food is excellent especially the pizza and I think its hard to find good pizza!! This is a great place for date night or to bring the whole family......we do both :)
Great food at an excellent value with wonderful service! What more could you possibly want."}
{"text":"Enjoyed Happy Hour with a friend. The food and service was spot on. Clare took care of us with class and style. 
I'll be coming back soon!!"}
{"text":"Pizza is amazing. Surprisingly, during happy hour you can wait awhile for service to show up if you decide to sit on the patio, especially in the summer."}
{"text":"If you like Grimaldi's, you'll love this place, and the price. It's almost too good for the area. Nice light pizza, great atmosphere, you'll love it."}
{"text":"Groupn had a special $30 coupon for $15 so we went there for dinner. 
They have up-to-date ipods which takes and sends the order to the kitchen for a fast turn around which is awesome! 
We ordered a large house salad which could have been tossed a little better as all the dressing flavor was at the bottom of the plate. A few more olives also could have been added. 
The medium wings were not bad and they had decent blue cheese dressing, son had ranch which he said was pretty good. The wings were crispy and the medium sauce wasn't too hot or spicy. Not over or under cooked. Would try the hot if  you like more spice and heat...the wings came out tempature hot and needed a minute to cool down.
We also ordered a large pizza with sausage, mushrooms, sun dried tomatoes and 1/2 with onions.  They added a bit too much dried tomatoes and besides tasting all the sun dried tomatoes the pie was plain in taste, a bit rubbery, but at least not soggy...They have a nice layout and if it wasn't too warm out the patio would have been a great spot enjoy. 
Wife thought the place was just okay and most likely will not return any time soon. If we didn't have the Groupon we would have passes it up."}
{"text":"Go for the pizza! All ingredients freshly made in house. I love this restaurant. It is always nice and clean (even the bathrooms). Great for families because they have an entire seating area with booths that is separate from the bar. The best way to enjoy Upper Crust is outside on the patio; on there huge cushioned patio couches, relaxing in the shade of over-sized umbrellas, with a bottle of chilled wine. Oh yeah, if you thought it couldn't get any better... IT'S A WINE BAR. I do not know who categorized it as a sports bar, but I guess any bar with more than five tv's has to be a sports bar. The full title on the sign outside the place it Upper Crust Pizza and Wine Bar"}
{"text":"Service was excellent. Food was just okay. Basic and bland. The cheese has a weird consistency...not sure what it's made of... scary...."}
{"text":"Tucked into the shopping complex this location can be easy to miss if you aren't looking for it. We ventured over here since it was close to our place at the time and we were hoping for good eats close by. The inside has a definite New York style feel to it when you go it. We were seated right away and had our drinks quickly.

The menu is a variety of what you'd expect from any Italian eatery - pizza, pasta, calzones, etc. The food was tasty and the ambiance is nice if you are looking for a good date night spot. They offer a variety of weekly specials, so check it out to see what may be happening when you go.

Overall: A
Good eats, easy going vibe and nice staff."}
{"text":"Whoop, typed in the wrong text for this place. Upper crust is awesome, I will expand on this later."}
{"text":"This place is really good!! I have had the alfredo pasta with chicken and loved it! They wilont allow anyone under the age of 21 in the bar area so thats pretty awesome. My boyfriend loves the meatball sliders with the diff type of bread they have. Everything we've had here is pretty good. Definitely recommend for a nice night out."}
{"text":"Went there this evening with my parents and one year old baby. 2 stars because everyone was so nice and accommodating to the little. I don't take my daughter restaurants much so it was nice the waitress was so friendly. The food was mixed. Wings were unevenly cooked and one carrot and two old celery sticks with one order, the other order had 3 old carrots and no celery. I ordered the small antipasto salad and half of the lettuce was nearly black (old/wilted) and drenched in salad dressing. The pizza had uneven cheese, a few slices with none at all :( we didn't complain because the server was so nice and we even tipped her 40%. The staff even took pics for us and greeted us throughout the dinner. So sad to be disappointed with such a potentially great place."}
{"text":"Had a coupon for a free pound of wings (10 wings) when you buy a lg. 1-topping pizza...me and my buddy used the coupon and got a pepperoni pizza and hot buffalo wings, had a large beer a piece, split the bill in half; seriously the best $15 I've spent in a while. Probably my new favorite pizza here in Phoenix, and hands down the best wings I've ever had. Housemade Ranch was delectable. Our server and hosts were so helpful and polite. Definitely will be out in my regular cycle; want ro try so much here!"}
{"text":"I've been to upper crust twice. I love the pizza. They have a very thin but tasty crust. The pizza sauce is so flavorful and robust I love it. For a large 8 slice pizza it's a price you can't beat and way better than delivery from a big name place. If you like tirimasu give theirs a try for dessert. You get a huge slice that you can easily share with your date and it's delish!  The staff is kind and helpful. If you have small kids they will bring you some raw dough so they can shape and cook up with dinner."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday 5.6.18 for lunch with my hubby. We walked in at 1:45pm, there was a 3 top sat at a table on the lower level, they were already eating, and there was a 2 top sat in a booth, that was it. We opted for a booth. The Hostess took our drink order and brought us our diet soda and iced tea, she told us our server would be right with us. Well... by right with us, she meant 15 minutes later! When the server came over she asked awkwardly if she could get us something to drink, then said nevermind you have drinks, I meant to eat. I told her we were on a bit of a time crunch and asked how long a cheese pizza would take, she said 10 minutes. We ordered a 12\" Cheese Pizza and Fettuccini Alfredo, add 2 meatballs.
We sat and watched the minutes tick away, with no sight of our server, and after 17 minutes we were ready to walk out, but as I was going to get up, she was behind me with our food. 
Pizza looked and tasted great!! Really good pizza, worth the wait. The Alfredo was nothing to write home about and the meatballs were pretty bad; they were hard, dry and crunchy on the outside. Crunchy meatballs? No juice or tenderness at all, needed a fork and knife to cut them. I had to ask for marinara sauce just to hydrate them a bit. We immediately asked for the check, paid and left.  Total time from walking in to leaving was 50 minutes!! I could see that if it was busy, but when you only have 3 tables and one of them left while we were there...come on!! And don't tell people the pizza takes 10 minutes when it's closer to 30. We would have made other menu selections.
Even though the pizza was good here, there are plenty of other options to get just as good if not better pizza, and way better service."}
{"text":"I have been back, a couple more times, still my FAVORITE pie in Phoenix. Nice work Upper Crust!"}
{"text":"You don't expect to find a good restaurant in a strip mall, next to Costco, but Upper Crust is all of that. They have fantastic food, including fresh made mozzarella (made at the restaurant), really good chicken wings (ask for them crispy!), and, yes, great pizza. There's always a happy hour special going on and the bar and restaurant sides are totally separate, which is great for both families and the no-kid crowd. And, now, that it's cooling off, you can finally enjoy the patio!"}
{"text":"Upper Crust is like Grimaldi's on steroids. The two places have nearly identical decor and the pizza is extremely similar. Upper Crust uses a little more cheese which is nice, but they also use cornmeal on the crust which I am not crazy about. The wings are huge and delicious, especially with the honey BBQ sauce. The meatballs are nothing special (with or without the mozzarella cheese), but Stephanie H would disagree. Happy hour is Monday-Friday 4pm to 7pm and on Wednesdays they offer half off on bottles of wine. 

Overall, it is a very good pizza and I plan on returning. Next time I'll be giving that pizza cookie a try. I really liked Upper Crust, but Grimaldi's in Old Town is still my favorite for traditional NY style thin crust pizza."}
{"text":"Really good pizza and a great happy hour! Unfortunately, I feel like the service is hit or miss. They have a cozy little patio with comfy chairs."}
{"text":"I am so in love with the pizza here. I've had the Hawaiian and the BBQ Chicken pizzas so far and I totally loved both. I especially love the BBQ Chicken. The pizza has a very thin crust and is full of flavor so you can have more slices of pizza than you normally would. I ordered an 18\" large recently for only $16.75. 

The restaurant was kinda dark inside, but it was a beautiful day anyway so I was already planning to eat at the patio. The patio had 3 tables and some lounge chairs and sofas. It isn't a huge patio area so I can see how it might be difficult to get a seat during dinner or perhaps lunch. 

I gotta thank my niece for introducing me to this place. I am so a fan now."}
{"text":"I love this place best pizza and wings in the valley by far. They have a great drink selection too!"}
{"text":"The pizza and wings are delicious, we are celebrating my son's Birthday. Great atmosphere, everyone is friendly. Great service. Especially our server Kristy she was phenomenal. We will definitely be coming back. Yumminess!!"}
{"text":"Our favorite little go to spot.  My fiancé and I usually go to Upper Crust at least one to two  times per week.  We now have our \"own\" booth and the waitress know us well. In other words, we are always made to feel special there.  We always get the Ceasar Salad and a large pizza with feta cheese on it...extra crispy please!  We thank you, Upper Crust for your existence and to the great wait staff!"}
{"text":"No one under 21 allowed on their patio? Never heard of that and no one under 21 allowed in their bar area. BYE to happy hour drinks or appatizers. You cannot get happy hour price in the dinning room . Happy Hour prices are the best ! So if you want to be part of the cheaper prices don't bring anyone under 21..."}
{"text":"So I hate to do this but this place is crazy to charge $11 for 3 meatballs.  Ive always enjoyed their pizza but the fact they do not put prices on their website or menu makes me think they know this is an insane amount to charge.

I repeat, i just paid $11 for 3 meatballs and they are regular sized, not too big. 

In good faith I cannot go back here and support this restaurant.  For comparison sake, Oregenos, a larger chain serves up 2 meatballs that is a larger portion than the 3 at Upper Crust.  Oreganos charges 4.99.

4.99 compared to 10.99?

My office is cracking up that I paid for this."}
{"text":"The only thing worth ordering here is the fried mozzarella. It is DELICIOUS and fresh. We live right down the street and have tried carry out multiple times, but as others have said, it is horrible. Dining in is definitely the better option when it comes to this place. Even with dining in, the food is very expensive unless you have coupons (which they do sometimes send out in the mail). Their wings are good, but again very expensive. The pizza is thin so it takes more pies to feed people than a normal pizzeria. We actually order Barros and Papa Johns over Upper Crust. Which I hate to say, because I love supporting small businesses. If they would lower their prices, they'd get more service from us and many others."}
{"text":"Great gem of a place located close by to Viet Kitchen and Cave Creek Costco. They always send us coupons in the mail for a free pound of wings with purchase of an entree. They have a Tuesday deal where pizzas are around $10. We've tried the following:
- Stuffed Mushrooms: decent, a nice flavor
- Pizza: crust is deliciously garlic-y, and it has a brick-oven taste to it, goes more towards the thin side in terms of thickness
- Wings: decent"}
{"text":"This is our second time here and loved both times. We have been hearing great thing about this place for sometime so we decided to change things up and finally give it a try. We looked online for their Happy Hour specials and boy are they great!! $3 house wine!!! And $5 appetizers!!! Plus, they had coupons to use too!! (I think they expired at the end of 2013 - not sure if new ones are posted yet).

Our first experience was great! Service and food was awesome. We transferred from sitting at the bar to the outside patio under the heaters. The server came out a few times to check on us but mostly we went inside to the bar to order our drinks b/c HH was winding down and we wanted to get a few glasses of wine at $3 before it was too late.  While I was standing there waiting (it was VERY crowded) a nice gentleman who was standing in the crowd asked me if I had been helped. I replied, \"no\", and he hollered for the gal behind the bar. While I was waiting for my wine, I asked him if he was the owner. He replied \"yes, I'm Steve\". I thought that was great of him to notice my need for service! Well done!

Our second time, we took our best friends who were getting ready to move out of AZ to Missouri. We again sat in the bar area but at a high-top table. A server came over very quickly and introduced himself as Joe. Joe was AWESOME!!! He really made our last night with our friends very amazing and we have some great memories from that night.  Joe was extremely attentive throughout the night even while the place was filling up to watch the BCS football game. We were there just during Happy Hour and ordered from the HH menu. The food is awesome!! The mozzarella is AMAZING!!! And wine for $3 a glass is a great deal.

I HIGHLY recommend this place.....and when you go, ask for Joe and tell him the crazy people with the floating condo (boat) idea in San Diego sent you ;-)"}
{"text":"I love Upper Crust. The best red sangria! Sometimes the service can slack but the pizza is amazing and ambiance is great."}
{"text":"Oh. My. YUM!!!!!

I had a coupon for a free pizza (thanks to a Yelp event) and have never been to this place so we decided to make the drive and check it out. Sooo glad we did! 

I wish I would have gotten our waiters name, he would have gotten a 1 star. We were seated and sat and sat and sat. It was a Thursday (5/24) at about 6pm, there were maybe 3 other tables with people. NO ONE acknowledged us for a solid 10 minutes. We finally flagged down a bus boy who went and got our waiter. The waiter was not personable at all. Whatev. Although twice a lady brought our food out to us, she was so super nice and we had even said to her that we wished she was our waitress, very personal and nice. 

We ordered several things to try since it was our first time. We did an order of wings, an antipasto salad, the mozzarella and then a pepperoni pizza.

I don't eat wings, so I cant say how they were, but they were the biggest I've ever seen and the guys really liked them a lot! 

The antipasto was fresh and tasty! We will for sure be ordering that again. Note a small is big enough for 4 people! 

The fried mozzarella was super tasty! Very different! Loved it! Not the best I've had though, that award goes to Lo Cascio, but I will for sure order it every time I go! 

The pizza was HUGE! A large will easily feed 5 people. It was so different, loved the amount of cheese on it, though I do wish there was slightly more sauce on it, the sauce is soooo tasty! 

This will for sure be a repeat place for us!"}
{"text":"So this place i would rank in the same exact field as spinatos. This is a tough category to be in. Not quite sure what they were going for with the decor. There were/are tv's everywhere (in the family/restaurant) section of the place. I mean i won't lie i love to watch sports everywhere i go, but this is just screaming for me to get in trouble if i go with my girlfriend.

The food wasn't cheap in price, but wasn't ridiculously priced. 

Lets start with the good: The pizza. The place is called upper crust they better have a good pizza. and Just like their name the crust is great. Infact it is the best part of the pizza. Yes i will admit we got a weird combination of toppings on the pizza so that probably didn't help much, but here we go...
The sundried tomatoes should have been slightly rehydrated before putting in the oven because...they were super sundried tomatoes. the cheese was good. The crust, it was a good thin crust pizza, but it didn't have enough to put it over as GREAT. To be honest if they made the crust a garlic crust or something, add a little pizzazz to it. Yeah it would have gone over better with me. 

But to be honest, if you want a straight forward pizza. They got you a great straight forward pizza.

Because they are in the same category of spinatos. They are getting graded against what i would like to say the best sit down pizza THAT I HAVE PERSONALLY tried in the Phoenix area. 

The specialty pizza selections um...,how you say. Small... i was expecting more of a selection on this from a place called upper crust. 

We also got their stuffed mushrooms. They were good, i won't lie i don't get too picky about my stuffed mushrooms as long as they have a good tasting mushroom and is stuffed with something tasty.

I don't think they were worth the 7.99 price tag they had on it though. 

I'd come back, but i'd have to try other things to convince me of a better rating. Maybe i will go to the \"lounge/bar\" side next time. (the wings looked decent i will try those next time)."}
{"text":"I sat outside so I didn't pay attention to the decor, but I thought the pizza was top notch. Crust was great and the unique combinations of pies were a welcome to our family. There is so much blah pizza these days that this place definitely stood out to my tastes."}
{"text":"I came here after receiving a free pizza at a Yelp event.  Upper Crust had some of the best food at the event so I couldn't wait to have dinner at the restaurant.  

My friend and I came here on a Wednesday and were pleasantly surprised it was 1/2 off a bottle of wine day.  I can't remember exactly which wine we ordered, but it was a Shiraz and it was good.  We shared a happy hour appetizer of mild wings and a large pepperoni pizza with basil.  It was all so delicious!  

I also came here a different day with my boyfriend and we shared the meatballs with cheese on top and a large pizza with pepperoni, sausage, and basil.  Again, it was very tasty!  

 Everyone was very friendly and prompt.  I will be back to Upper Crust!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised.

Nice but casual atmosphere. I like how there were TVs to watch the games but it didn't have that dirty sports bar vibe. 

Fast, nice, and efficient service.

Reasonably priced beers. And really good selection of bottled beers. Wish they had a bigger selection of drafts.

We had the fried mozzarella which by husband loved and I thought was okay. I loved the texture of the breading around the cheese but I wish the breading was a bit more seasoned. 

My husband had some wings which he thought were really good. And he was happy they made them \"extra crispy\" for him. I liked that you can order them by the half dozen for just $5. Most places you have to order them in larger quantities which sucks cause I'm a vegetarian.

We ordered a large pizza with Kalamata olives, artichokes, and tomatoes. We liked the pizza for the most part. The cheese tasted delicious on it. I liked the texture of the crust, just wished there was a little more flavor in the sauce. Luckily if you order tasty toppings it makes up for it.

The value of the pizza was amazing. $12 for a large, $2 a topping. 

They only had 2 specialty pizzas on the menu, both chicken, which I found puzzling. I was hoping for a few veggie varieties.

Overall, I'm psyched we found this place. We ordered a ton of food and 2 beers for $43. I am looking forward to trying their happy hour."}
{"text":"We were just visiting AZ and staying at a near by resort. A lady at the pool told my wife that we had to go to Upper Crust to try their Pizza as it was the best in Arizona!  With that being said, we went.  Service was okay, however the food was great. The small salad was enough for 3 people. We enjoyed it so much we wanted to go back a second time.  Honestly the best pizza I have ever had!  Prices were excellent!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for quick to-go order; the caesar salad was good as was the grilled chicken that came w on the side. The pepperoni and mushroom calzone was a bit of a disappointment; it looked/smelled great, however, it was stuffed w nothing but ricotta (allllll ricotta) n very lil mozzarella, the mushrooms were either so small I missed them or there were none and to make matters worse the marinara sauce on the side was filled w raw/uncooked chopped garlic which is way too powerful n destroys the palate."}
{"text":"Arrived at this place and realized this was their soft opening.  We were excited to see another pizza place in this location because the other two had failed and all I can say is WOW.  We ordered the honey hot wings.  They game out piping out from the fryer with great flavor.  We ordered a large pizza with pepperoni and sausage.  PERFECT CRUST, wonderful fresh toppings and Delish fresh mozzarella cheese.  This place is awesome!  Tons of tv's, great customer service.  We will definitely be coming back here!"}
{"text":"Stopped in today after reading Yelp reviews.  Happy hour is only in the bar-that alone means we likely won't be back.  HATE restaurants that do that.  We always have our kids with us and like to enjoy a HH beer while out.  Waitress seemed annoyed to be at work, and the place was EMPTY.  Pizza was good and the housemade mozzarella was amazing.  Place was expensive too-$78 before tip!  If I ever patronized them again it would be for takeout."}
{"text":"Bleh. Bland, tasteless pizza, squishy pasta, watery sauce. The service was lackluster and the music is LOUD. Such a bummer, since it is so close to my house."}
{"text":"I love this place! Great thin crust pizza!
Amazing Happy Hour with many selections!
I had my Significant other 50th birthday party on the patio! Our Server Heather was
A Rock Star! 
Sorry I didn't take pics of our food but
Everything was delicious"}
{"text":"Pizza was great, homemade sausage - very good - service was great - so happy we finally stopped here"}
{"text":"Don't visit this place; they have a nice
Outdoor patio, but don't think it is valuable enough to get a permit for dogs! Phoenix is a fun place that is usually very dog friendly. Avoid this place. Also, the waitress doesn't know what \"customer service\" means. She is put off and rude. Try Oggia pizza and brewing instead! They rock!"}
{"text":"The bartender thought to take it upon herself to order for me. We ordered hot wings not knowing they had two different kinds. She assumed we wanted honey hot. Well I HATE honey hot. We just paid and left. People should never assume. Always ask and give people a choice."}
{"text":"Loved this place servers are awesome pizza is just as good. Great atmosphere and friendly crowd. Great view to watch your favorite game from any seat in the house. When the weather is good you can't beat the sunset views from the patio. Recommend the place to anyone."}
{"text":"I'd been to this place a couple times before, but just on the dining side. Went in tonight to the bar; this is the cool side of the restaurant, FYI. 

Had a glass of wine and Margherita pizza. Exceeded my expectations. My pizza was great (extra basil, just how I like it); so obviously I ate the whole thing. (It would have been a terrible thing to waste; and re-heated pizza is never as good.)

The staff were friendly and all seemed to really enjoy their job. I will for sure come back."}
{"text":"Great pizza and a great beer selection. Big improvement in service over the brickyard (R.I.P)"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Upper Crust has the best pizza in Phoenix, and I love the appetizers, drinks, and friendly staff just as much.  We go in here all the time and just love the atmosphere and good energy.  And did i mention the pizza :)"}
{"text":"I've visited Upper Crust a few times now. The service and food have always been top notch. Kudos to Scott, marisa and April for great service and friendly conversation. This is definitely going to be a regular happy hour spot for me from now on!!"}
{"text":"My second home, no seriously , its that good! Cant say I was ever in the place before so I wont be making any comparisons. 

Dough!- The pizza is perfect! I always get the personal size, with italian sausage and ricotta cheese. Its big for being a personal , I usually share it with my main man and it fits us perfectly, however I think for most people its not for splitting. Its thin crust , sorta similar to Grimaldis but better! and not as pricey. They seem to use a similar style bread on the spinach dip too and it melts in your mouth! noms!

Friends behind the bar- I have only been at the bar seats, but the servers are all friendly and happy to chat with you even when your not at their table. Bartenders are super awesome. All are fun and talkative. Making drinks quick and having a good conversation is hard to find!!

Wine bar?- The sign says Patio and wine bar, soooo it is.. but its very unpretentious , so if you are just getting into wine or are not at all , dont be shy come on in.. its not pricey and the guys are here to help! Plus a good selection of draft and bottle beers! If you like good wine, get in here! I you are a beer drinker, get in here! If you just like a goo place with good friend and soda, get in here!

Break it down Jess- All in all its a great place, half price wine bottles on Wednesday, and a great happy hour. My only thought that if you go to this wine bat for a bottle of wine with friends for a quite time, dont go during any sporting events as there are tons of tv's( which is great) but could easily turn into a guys bar during those times. But I love this place!!!!!!

See you there!!!"}
{"text":"Andrew was the best server! Made our experience at Upper Crust memorable. I cannot wait to go back! Best food, best drinks, best service I've ever had!"}
{"text":"We live right around the corner from Upper Crust, and if it weren't for the high prices, we would probably eat here once a week because of the high quality and freshness. The pizza is fantastic and the wings are the best I have had. We normally get takeout and the service is always quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time and it's decent. 

Unfortunately we started with the Focaccia Bread... It was bland at best. When I asked if we could get a side of marinara our server told us it would be $1.25 extra... I told her to go ahead and charge us. Otherwise there was no way I'd have eaten it. My advice would be to try something else as an appetizer unless they start serving it with the marinara or seasoned olive oil... something with more flavor. 

We ordered the BBQ Chicken Pizza and it was pretty good. The pizza crust is thin and crispy. The BBQ sauce had good flavor. There could have been a little more chicken on the pizza. 

For dessert I tried the Tiramisu. It was very good. One of the better I've had in a while. 

Overall, they're a solid 3 to 3.5 stars, but our server Miranda pushes it up to 4 stars. She was friendly and attentive all evening. There were 8 of us and no one ever had to wait long for anything. A big thanks to her."}
{"text":"Great patio bar with comfortable seating. Our server Cordae was a delight and very attentive. We ordered from their happy hour (which is not current on the site). Spinach artichoke dip and bruschetta is wonderful. We scarfed it down before I took pictures! Then ordered stuffed mushrooms and mozzarella sticks. Stuffed mushrooms are recommended, we did not like the mozzarella sticks and sent them back. Bland not coated appeared more like pierogies."}
{"text":"This was our first trip to Upper Crust and we chose it for their Gluten Free options and they did not disappoint. They make their own gluten free crust, from what the waitress told us and it nice a crunchy. They also have 3 plus options for appetizer. The spinach artichoke dip is delicious with gluten free bread. The flour-less chocolate cake was tiny but great!"}
{"text":"This place is as much Italian as Pizza Hut.  Server was very nice but the food is bad.  They want $12.00 for a small Linguine \"dinner\" that includes nothing.   I asked for a side salad and I got a few pieces of lettuce in a bowl right out of the cooler for an additional $2.50.  I asked for bread and they do not have bread unless I want to order it off the appetizer menu.   WHAT REAL ITALIAN PLACE SERVES A MEAL WITHOUT BREAD!!  If you like Pizza Hut stye food this is the place for you.  I am staying far away."}
{"text":"I'm not usually one to criticize, but I read the good reviews for this place and it seemed like a pretty safe bet.  Went on a Saturday evening and the place wasn't crowded at all ;-) Our server, Matthew was fantastic - a really nice guy.
We ordered a large pizza with 4 toppings but the pizza arrived with only 3 of the 4.  Matthew was very apologetic and said he would bring us a glass of wine on the house for the mistake.  He left and returned a few minutes later saying they wouldn't allow him to give us a free glass of wine, but he could take the charge off of the bill.  Being a business owner myself, I though, hmmm, pretty poor customer service.  The pizza itself was fine, however, we ordered it with sliced tomatoes and much to our chagrin, it seems the tomatoes were the first thing put on the pizza because there was no sauce, cheese or anything else under them and they covered 80% of the pizza.  The sausage was sparse at best with maybe 10 pieces on the 18\" pizza.  The crust was so thin in the center that it couldn't even hold the tomatoes without disintegrating. So it was disappointing, but on the other hand, the patio was very nice and Matthew was great. If I could give the management one piece of advice, it would be to never let a customer leave disappointed - it may have cost him a glass or two of house wine, but I would have returned."}
{"text":"Really liked the pizza here and will definitely return. Crust was cooked perfect and thin. Toppings were fresh and flavorful."}
{"text":"Bummer,  wanted to eat at the restaurant but after being seated and asking what was on happy hour was told that the only specials are in the bar.  So we asked to be seated in the bar area and but they do not allow our child in there.  So unfortunately you cannot partake in the discounted appetizers.  I thought that was a dumb rule. And was told by the waitress that yes it wass but the owners won't budge.  So i guess this is not a family establishment."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza. Cute little wine, pizza place  in the middle of chains. We only had take out so that is our reason for 4 stars. Next time we will dine in!"}
{"text":"FYI: Their pizza \"patio\" is NOT dog or even kid friendly. After we sat down outside and the waitress took our drink orders, she came back out to tell us that the dogs were only allowed to be tied up on the outside of the patio. She also added that kids weren't allowed on the patio either. There were no signs saying any of these rules posted inside or outside at the patio. If you're looking for a nice outdoor patio to bring your kids or furry friend and enjoy a nice drink or meal...this isn't the place."}
{"text":"I've been here two more times since my last review.  

Mother's Day was relaxing and cozy.  Hardly anyone there.  I did mention on a quick tip that they had no wait on that day for lunch.  My mom opened the door and said \"this place is really fancy, are you sure this is the place you are taking me?\"  Awwww moms!  LOL  She loved the pizza and the Pizzookie!  

Went by last night, and ran into some fellow Yelpers that we met in Las Vegas.  How funny!  We'll be seeing them again at the next Yelp event.  It is so nice to meet new people and us Yelpers share a lot in common too.

It was a busy night, but we ended up at our usual  \"It's okay to have too much fun.\" table.  Our waiter was awesome, and he mentioned the stuffed mushrooms were really good.  We got them, and they were really good.  Delish stuffed fungus filled with ricotta cheese and topped with mozzarella and Italian sausage.  We then went for the BBQ chicken pizza.  I was expecting chicken soaked in BBQ sauce, but instead the BBQ sauce was drizzled over the pizza with grilled chicken pieces and red onion slices.  Very tasty, chicken was a tiny bit dry but the crust tasted like an \"elephant ear\".  (I'm from the Midwest and I know that is a Midwestern thing.  So an elephant ear is like Indian bread with sugar and Cinnamon or like a flat funnel cake.  It looks like a giant elephant ear.  LOL)  I did enjoy watching the Indiana Pacers play on the TVs, but they lost. :(  But that's what happens when you keeping passing the ball around.  LOL  So, I was fully entertained.

Another romantic night.  I would like to take advantage of their happy hour sometime and also bring the crew from work to this place sometime too.  

Good food, good service, good atmosphere, decent prices, just can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Pizza and wine joint! I was a fan before I walked in. Thank goodness they didn't disappoint! That was close. 
The place has two different rooms to experience. When you walk in there is a hostess to greet you and a room full of tables and booths covered in red and white checked tablecloths. Yes, real table linen! This room in for a quieter more formal dining experience. Just to the left is a door that leads you to the \"bar\" area. They have high top tables, bar seating, booths and a nice little patio. When we arrived the hostess asked where we would like to sit and before I could reply, a patron leaving suggested the \"fun side\". The bar it is! 
We ordered the spinach dip appetizer and a veggie pizza. The dip was flavorful and the focaccia wedges were thin and crispy. I could have had that for my dinner. The veggie pizza was great! They do a thin crust, white pizza with artichokes, broccoli(shredded), onions and small mushrooms. I really enjoyed this pie for two reasons. All the toppings are chopped small, so every bite has all the goodies! And second, it's amazing reheated in a hot oven the next day. Yum! Basically it's green and white! Go Spartans! 
Speaking of collage and this leads me to sports, they have at least 8 flat screen TVs broadcasting a variety of sporting events. Fun place! 
Our server was friendly and very attentive. Drinks where also replenished quickly. Overall a nice place to relax and enjoy some delicious food and tasty beverages!"}
{"text":"Just wanted to add that over three years later, the pizza is still amazing.  We ventured outside of pizza and ordered the calzone, which is also quite tasty, and sometimes order the mediterranean salad to go with the pizza or calzone, which I am now addicted to.  The stuffed mushrooms and wings are also noteworthy.  To top it off the service is always consistently great."}
{"text":"Great pizza and wine/beer selection.  The fried cheese appetizer is unique and super tasty!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I'm doing this but I am going to go public about my favorite pizza place. I've looked for great pizza in Phoenix but have only found a few contenders - but for my money, it's really hard to beat Upper Crust. 

Upper Crust is a somewhat undiscovered gem in North Phoenix that offers excellent pizza at family prices. And if that weren't enough, the appetizers are also fresh and first rate. If you're a first timer, I suggest you go with the fresh deep fried fresh mozzarella for a starter. It's flavorful, light crust is never greasy and the marinara sauce is rich in flavor without being over-spiced. 

Follow that up with a pizza with your favorite ingredients. You can't go wrong with the fresh fixin's and their light sauce plus their cheese makes all the difference in the world. If you can save room for dessert, the creme brulee is the perfect way to end a fantastic meal. There are pizzas that are more well-known in Phoenix but very few that taste better. 

If you're like me, service is a big part of dining out. We've always had great luck with the friendly staff who take accurate orders (using an iPod touch - how cool!) and they have the uncanny ability to anticipate our every need. If you have young kids, be sure to ask for some fresh dough for them to play with and the kitchen will even bake their crusty sculptures and post them online. 

Of our numerous visits, the only misfire we've ever had seems to be the salads. Don't get me wrong, I love a plate of fresh, quality mixed greens as much as the next guy but get the dressing on the side to suit your  taste.

The large portions and friendly service ensure that you'll leave rubbing your tummy with a smile on your face. So there you have it. The word is getting out. I hope you enjoy it as much as we do!"}
{"text":"This is by far one of my husbands and my FAVORITE spots.  Living up north off of Cave Creek there are not a lot of options.  Many restaurants have occupied this space all of which we hated.  Amazing lounge area with lots of TVs, free wifi and  great staff.  Matt or Kevin usually wait on us in that area and we now actually consider them friends were there so much!!!  Only bad thing is you can not sit in the lounge area with kids...which is awesome now but will be annoying once we spawn. Gluten free options for me and when we feel like cheating delicious artichoke dip!   Patio was nice in the spring and were looking forward for the cooler weather to sit out there again.  YUMMIE PIZZA, BEER, WINE  AND SALADS and a good spot for watching sports!"}
{"text":"Good prices. Horrible bartender (Mike). See picture. Sooooo inattentive.  Maybe that's why it's empty at HH. He's also Dropping f-bombs talking with clients. Checking cell phone instead of filling drinks. 

No HH menu/price list. Heard servers and bartender try to explain to customers, both here and over the phone, what the HH prices were.

Men's room missing soap dispenser and has graffiti on the mirror."}
{"text":"My review is based on the service. The food was fine, as it always has been. The service has been either so-so or bad every time I've gone, so I have taken the hint and will likely not be going back.

I went to meet a friend at Upper Crust last week, and we got there at about 8:00 p.m. It was a Tuesday and was empty in the lounge except for two people sitting at the bar, so we sat in a booth off to the side. It took a few minutes for someone to come over to us, which was no big deal, as I noticed the bartender was busy speaking to a customer about something, but did not see a server anywhere. 

After a few minutes a server (I think his name was John? Jim? A tall, slender young guy), came up and greeted us asking us for our drink order. I was trying to decide on a glass of wine so he said he would be back with two waters that we asked for. We didn't see him again for about 6-7 minutes. 

He came back with our waters, got my wine order, came back with the glass of wine, and said he would \"be right back\" to get our food order even though our menu's were closed and we were clearly ready to order. I would've understood if he had a busy section, but we were the only table sitting in the entire area. The restaurant side was empty as well.

After about 10 minutes he finally showed back up again to take our order. Once our food was ready he dropped it off but we did not see him again for another 25-30 minutes. The bartender obviously noted his absence as he came up to us to check on us saying he had no idea where our server is but wanted to make sure we were okay.
Any interaction with him was sort of slow and tired on his part, and it was pretty awkward, especially when he came back to our table reeking of cigarettes.

I hate to pull the \"I work in a restaurant\" card because I know how annoying that can be, but from working in a restaurant for so long I guess I notice these things and they disappoint me, especially when I feel that everyone deserves a tip, but shouldn't feel entitled to it and should take at least some sort of pride in their job."}
{"text":"Upper Crust is going through a major identity crisis. On the door it says \"Patio Lounge and Wine Bar\" which makes you think of Postino or some upscale snooty place, but before you even walk in you can see all the TVs showing sporting games through the windows. Are you a sports bar or a wine bar? And then you feel like you're in the middle of New York when you're sitting down and looking at the red and white checkered tablecloths and old school photos. But, there's no denying that the food is pretty tasty.  We had the Mediterranean salad to share, and a pizza with sausage and sun dried tomatoes. The chef was a little stingy on the sausage; I definitely could have used more. Someone else in our party ordered the pasta with meat sauce and it was pretty delicious. Not my favorite pizza but definitely near the top."}
{"text":"Looking for the perfect thin crust pizza? Well if you like homemade mozzarella then try out Upper Crust Pizza and Wine Bar. Our friends introduced us to this restaurant on a recent visit to Scottsdale. This restaurant is situated in a strip mall and doesn't look like anything special from the outside but take a step inside and you'll feel differently. It has that \"cozy\" feeling that makes you want to keep coming back.

They make a variety of homemade pizzas to order that come out of the oven with just the right amount of \"crispness\".  On my short trip to Scottsdale I made 2 visits to Upper Crust. (We just liked it so much the first time I couldn't wait to go back). In addition to pizza they feature calzone and pasta on the menu. It's a casual place that's big on \"atmosphere\". On both visits we were lucky enough to have \"Laura\" wait on us. She was personable and made our experience very enjoyable. 

Pizza sizes tend to be larger than what you would expect. The \"personal size\" pizza was plenty to eat for my party of 2. If you're a wine lover my tip would be to make a visit on a Wednesday night.  All bottles of wine are half off!"}
{"text":"So my boyfriend and I went here tonight and stayed all of 15 minutes before we got up and left. I know it's friday night and they were busy but when the serve at the bar area sees you says sit anywhere and you sit in her section she could at least give you a menu. We waited and she passed us twice along with another server and some food runners and nothing happened.  We were so mad we just decided to leave and then she finally acknowledged us and said have a good night. Wow seriously I couldn't believe it. I was so angry we love to eat and drink and will tip very well for good service so there's some money they lost out on. So all in all this was a huge disappointment because we live right up the street and were hoping to find a cool little spot to hang out sometimes but we will definitely never go back."}
{"text":"This place has some damn good pizza, could not believe the size of the personal pizza , there was enough to definitely take home and the staff is good, friendly, and fast highly recommended!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the personal pizza with onion, garlic and basil. The onion and garlic were both raw. The pizza lacked cheese and sauce. Two days later and I still taste garlic.

Will not return."}
{"text":"I love Upper Crust. And one thing stuck out to me. The great customer service. My dad recently ordered a calzone with meatball. When my dad got it there was no meatball. Obviously he wasn't upset. He told the waitress and the waitress told the manager and the manager came over. To see how apologetic he was showed how greatly he cared about the customers. He took it off our bill and offered a new calzone. We didn't need it but it was the kind gesture. Thank you."}
{"text":"I really really wanted to love this place. Great location, super cut atmosphere, food looks good. But it really fell short. The salad was eh and and the pizza WAY under seasoned. I read in another review it was too salty, I wish I had some of their salt. Even though the food was just mediocre the service is really what ruined it for me. I chose to sit in the bar, as im a bar fly, plus I think they have more specials in there. Anyways, all the tables were occupied except for two dirty ones, a high top and a booth. I opted for the high top, im sure I sat there a good 15 min before anyone stopped to help clean the mess. Sure I got lots of eye contact but no one seemed to want to serve me. So I moved to the dirty booth. It was cleaned quickly. My server showed up with menus and wanted a drink order stat! Whoa nelly! i asked if i could have a couple mins to decide on wine ( half off btls of wine on mondays) and for my guest to arriive. well bad idea cause then it took her like an hour to return. and this set the mood for the rest of our meal. at one point we had to get the busser to grab her and another i had to get up to order another bottle of wine from the bar. towards the end of our vist we were hoping for a pizzookie, well turns out the kitchen had been closed without our knowledge. too bad, i doubt ill be back"}
{"text":"The pizza has always been good. The service not so much. We ordered a pizza, said I would be there in 30 minutes to pick it up. Got there in 45 minutes and it still wasnt done. They charge you $2.50 for half full containers of Ranch, when other place give them complimentary. Also, sometimes they charge for them and sometimes they dont. No consistency. Something has also changed with the sauce, not anywhere near as good as it used to be. Lastly, the girls at the front act like they are doing you a favor by helping you. I would say find another place for pizza."}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza, not great. Like the bar, but the prices aren't great. They do have a mediteranean salad that is excellent. Service is always pretty good. Good place, not great. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Had a group of teachers come here twice on lunch breaks where we could actually leave school. They have some great lunch specials for pizza and we do enjoy the food.
However, we won't be able to keep doing this as it's pretty necessary for teachers to be back on time. Both times have been slow service, getting slower each time. The first time we went, we were only 3 minutes late getting back to school. The last time we went, this past week, there was only one other table in the restaurant when we came in. I specifically told the waiter that we had only an hour for lunch and needed to leave by a certain time, figuring this would fix the issue of last time. 
It didn't. It took so long to get our pizzas that we had to ask for the check as the food came out. 2 of our orders came out wrong and he tried to charge us for the fixes of their mistakes. He finally realized the mistake and fixed our checks but it took a while. Our checks came out right as we were supposed to be leaving. We gave him our payment methods and we didn't see him again for 10 minutes!! We were literally standing up trying to run out as soon as our cards were handed back! We were 20 minutes late getting back to school. It's too bad the service is so slow because we would have loved to make it our regular lunch stop."}
{"text":"We went back last night for the second time and again had GREAT pizza! We had two pizzas: a pepperoni and a sausage with garlic and onion. Both cooked perfectly and probably one of the best garlic combos we've had in the phoenix area!  The sauce is perfect, the Crust was done with just the right amount of Crisp and both were full of flavor with an excellent sauce. We had the opportunity to meet the owner who was there walking around and greeting his guests and checking on everything from service to making sure the place was set up nicely and in order. The server we had was so so nice and friendly and brought our kids some pizza dough to play and mold while we waited, which helped our little ones pleasantly pass time.. we had a great family dinner and We would recommend this to anyone from a first date all the way up to a group event. The food and ambience was again a 10! Well done and thank you!"}
{"text":"First off, the pizza here is some of the best I've had. You can taste that the mozzarella on the pizza is homemade - it's fresh and light - and the lasagna is also amazing. We catered my daughter's 1st bday party from here for 60 adults and kids and the food was so excellent. The owner helped us tailor our menu to what I was looking for - and trust me I am picky. I wanted kid friendly foods yet at an elevated flavor and display for us adults, so he provided steak and grilled chicken sliders with multiple toppings such as sautéed onions and mushrooms, chicken fingers and several apps. The food was so delicious! We also had a frozen margarita machine that went quick. I can't say more about how wonderful our experience was with the taste and quality of the food, as well as the superior service. We look forward ordering catering from them for our next party."}
{"text":"This place was very similar to Grimaldi's in Phoenix.
They have a family restaurant environment with TV's everywhere. 
It is awesome I did not have to crane my neck to watch the Coyote's playoff game at all. 
The service was really good, attentive, the also have a party room with an absolutely MASSIVE TV in it, as well as a nice indoor and outdoor lounge. 
The outdoor lounge has nice plush furniture to sit on and relax, it would be a fantastic place to take a date!

Their wine list is nice, I was sad they didn't have a moscato on it however the Reisling was really good so I couldn't complain. 

My husband and I always have the Pepperoni and Mushroom Pizza wherever we go. It was really good, Just the right amount of sauce and toppings and I have to save the left overs were really good cold. (Breakfast of champions right there)
We also ordered Hot Wings and Teriyaki wings. Its a good thing I love my husband or I may have bit him for the Teriyaki wings, there were fantastic and I could have made a meal out of them by themselves.

Certainly give this place a gander, I don't want them going anywhere soon, except for expanding locations!"}
{"text":"Spinach dip is deliciously not good for you!"}
{"text":"The suicide sauce is legit.  Pizza leaves a lot to be desired.  I do not recommend this place for a pie.  Soggy, undercooked, cheap crust, etc.  Server was pleasant enough but not quick on the refills."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza! Wednesday half off bottles of wine is great for a ladies or date night. Nice bar and patio area."}
{"text":"This place serves disgusting food at a high price.  There is also a creepy, male-dominated atmosphere that I find offensive.  The waitresses seem cowed.  

Their \"meat\" sauce and \"meat\" balls contain pork, but the menu doesn't mention that.  If you get chicken with your pasta, it will be served as a whole breast that is cut into thick strips and placed on top of the pasta.  The chicken looks and tastes nasty and old.  I almost thought I was eating a chicken tumor, rather than an actual breast.  I imagine the Upper Crust head chef picking out the tumor at the market, throwing it in his backpack, and then riding to work on his bicycle before preparing it for me.

I asked for some basil to lighten up the very heavy flavor of the tomato-cream linguini.  They gave me some and charged me a buck.  When I am paying $25 for some noodles, cheap sauce, and a tumor, I think they should give me the basil for free.  The fact that I asked for the basil indicates that the food isn't very good, and they should care about that.

Sorry, Upper Crust, but I will be stepping out and paying you no heed in the future."}
{"text":"WHY?  I simply want to know WHY?! Why is there only one of these places! And it's way up north in a strip mall with very limited parking.  

Almost a hundred reviews . . . that must tell you something. The pizza is incredibly good. Nothing \"out of a box.\" All homemade tasting yummy goodness. Melt in your mouth cheese. Crust that you do not want to leave a single scrap of on your plate. And the toppings? Stop me before I salivate into a flood of desire for yet one more piece of p-pie!

Last night we had 1/2 veggie & 1/2 BBQ chicken. I literally could not make up my mind which was better. They both were incredible. And we started with a Caesar salad . . . I loved it! It seems such a simple thing, but not many eateries get it right. Upper Crust serves a mean Caesar salad.

Ok, so it's about 30 miles out of my way to go for pizza . . . but totally worth it! Wonder if they deliver?????"}
{"text":"Great Pie! The small pie is perfect for two people -awesome date place.
Stuffed mushrooms a great added bonus to the meal. (the artichoke, and Italian sausage made those mushroom oh so yummy!) 
If you can ever make it there for happy hour you should, and not just for the pricing but to try all the other small serving items on the happy hour menu. Such a great way to start the evening and end it with their desserts! 
Fantastic food and fantastic service."}
{"text":"Wow, I was impressed!  Upper Crust is a family style restaurant; the owner and staff are very interactive and make every guest feel right at home.  

We ordered a 'small' pizza and a 'personal' calzone; both were absolutely delicious. The ingredients were fresh and the service was excellent, it felt like I ate a million calories but I guess that's always what if feels like when you eat something this good.

The portions are huge so expect to have leftovers!"}
{"text":"Came here for a middle school fundraiser. Didn't expect much, as has been my experience with any school fundraiser like this. Went on yelp and saw that they only had 3.5 stars. Which in my experience means we will either love it or it will be a total bust. Well our family of four was over the moon happy with everything!! Their pizza is thin crust. So if you're not a fan of thin crust pizza, don't bother BUT if you ARE it's SO good! Everything is made from scratch. My husband and our oldest ordered a pep/sausage pizza, our youngest ordered a kids cheese pizza and I ordered the meatballs w/ mozzarella cheese & a small Caesar salad (which is big enough to split....I did with my whole fam). Oh, and we ordered the focaccia as an app. Everything was delicious. Best meatballs I've ever had, anywhere, hands down!! The sauce that came with the focaccia, meatballs and on the pizza was so tasty. Our whole family raved, even my youngest who is super picky.... not to mention I come from an Italian family so I know an amazing sauce when I taste it!  So happy to have found this gem in North Phoenix! We will be back for sure....prob too many times. Lol. Heard their happy hour is pretty awesome too! Can't wait!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place is rated as high as it is. I just placed an order to go and these guys are NOT organized or efficient. To pick up your order you have to go into the bar area and ask one of the bartenders to get your to go order. I think a bar tender is better suited to serving drinks rather than helping with to go orders, don't you? As a restaurant owner I would want them pouring drinks. First, they couldn't find my ticket. And you have to understand how busy this place gets. It's BUSY where they have you picking up to go orders. It's right where the waiters put in their orders and also the kitchen is RIGHT there. It's just a very high traffic area and there is nowhere to go when the waiters are trying to bring out food from the kitchen, so you have this, excuse me--cluster F, of a situation. Then more people start piling in to pick up their order and it's just a big mess. 

So on the way out I had to put myself back together again because I'm carrying this 14\" hot pizza box, my purse, my debit card and my wallet and there's no place to set anything down. I stop by the front entrance near the hostess stand and sit down to collect myself. At the hostess station there was, what I would consider to be either a host or the owner, I'm not sure which...In any case, exasperated, I exclaimed to him that the to go order pick up process was inefficient. You would have thought I'd told him his hair was on fire and he was wearing clown makeup...Total deer in headlights. Didn't give a CRAP that his customers have to jump through so many hoops to get to their food. In addition, many of their servers are pretty grumpy when I see them. If you don't want to be there, go find another job.

I don't think I'll order take out from them again after this experience."}

* Wine Wednesday: 1/2 off bottles
* Great deals through social media
* To-die-for yummy crust"}
{"text":"I only gave it a 1 star as it wasn't possible to score it less.  We stopped there for dinner, they weren't very busy, not unusual since it's Tuesday.  We ordered a small house salad, with grilled chicken and a personal pizza.  It took over 30 minutes to get the salad.  We finished the salad and was told the pizza would be out soon.  I was drinking ice tea.  The waitress re-filled it, and when I took a sip it wasn't tea - it was coffee.  I told the waitress about it, and her response was they don't service coffee, and got me a fresh drink. At one point a server stopped by to ask if we had our pizza.  Forty-five minutes later I went to find her to tell her to bring us our check for the salad, ice tea and soda as we were leaving.  Before they brought the check, the pizza arrived - in a to go carton.  I told them we didn't want it, and then we had to wait for the manager to deduct it from our check.  Manager never came out - they said they were slow because they had a new cook, yet other, larger tables were being served in less time.  Ironically, one of the handicap parking spots in front of the restaurant had a 15 min parking limit.  Not sure you could get much in that amount of time.  Don't waste your time or money on this place.  You have a choice when you go out to dinner -don't chose this place."}
{"text":"We had stuffed mushrooms and a large pizza. Food was good but the service was at a snail pace. We had to wait a long time for our food, drink refills came as we were finished eating and we waited for half an hour just to pay our bill. 
It will be a long time before we think about eating here."}
{"text":"Dinner was fantastic! Waiter knew his stuff pairing a great wine and suggested beer flavor to a great pizza and salad. 
Pizza was a tomato less sauce. The basil pesto and garlic sauce set our taste buds into a spiral of greatness. Dinner prices are so very reasonable. Eating outside on a comfortable couch is again very relaxing."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years! The food has always been amazing and has been consistent all this time. The happy hour pizza is awesome and you can't beat the value. Actually, you can't beat any of the happy hour selections and prices. 

The service is also amazing! Miranda and April are always friendly and keep your drinks full. And yes, this includes your adult beverages. They make you feel like family and never rush you. 

Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Ate here with my family in tow and... WOW! Get the fresh mozzarella.  I never had fresh mozzarella and I am glad I did.  If you are going here try the mozzarella please.

Be prepared right off the Cave Creek exit in a strip mall, had to make a U turn to get into it.  Also the windows are all blacked out so at first I was not sure it was open.  

Great place to have some pizza, everyone liked the pizza....Yes my kids are good judges of pizza.  When they get full on pizza and not ask about dessert you know its good :)"}
{"text":"I went here with friends last night.  I read the reviews and knew I had to have the fried mozzarella which is home made every day and stuffed mushrooms with spinach dip, and I was not dissapointed at all.  They were delicious!  The pizza was amazing also. Everthing is Family style. 

They have a full bar, and a wonderful menu of wines, and they also have some that are not on the list.  Would have loved to go and sit on the patio, but the Haboob had other ideas last night!  But definitely somewhere I will go back again to again."}
{"text":"So my bf and I came back here for our 3rd time (never wrote a 2nd time review bc it was great like the 1st time) 3rd time meh not so good. We ordered the Caprese salad which is our fav! But the cheese tasted like rubber! it was so dry and hard and we were surprised b/c it was sent out with HUGE pieces. I told the waiter that it didn't taste right at all and he tried to convience me that it was more \"fresh\" and that is why it tasted like that...I beg to differ, I order Caprese salad prob 2x/week for yrs and this was not good. He took the plate away and we sat and waited for 10 mins for him to at least offer us menus. We never got them. At that point I just wanted the pizza. My bf ordered 6 wings which he said were average, nothing special. Pizza was amazing like always. The waiter returns and told me in fact the cheese was dried? wrong and the manager and agreed and said that they were going to stop serving the Caprese b/c it got too dry or the water was taken out of it too much? I don't really understand the process of making mozzarella cheese but I was happy he at least agreed with us. Kinda thought they would offer a small salad or dessert to compensate but nothing. Just had the pizza and my bf had some extra wings. I would return but JUST b/c I love the pizza there. We may order the caprese again since it is such a big portion and usually really good. But this waiter totally turned us off. The last 2 times we were there we had female waitresses who were AMAZING, maybe the male servers aren't that good? Hope I am not being too sexist hehe :)"}
{"text":"I finally brought my family here to dine in instead of take out. We had the fried Mozzarella as a starter.  It was very good. The crust flavor was perfect and the cheese tasted like it was fresh made.

We then progressed to a small pizza (actually the same size as a Papa John's large) with pepperoni,  mushroom, black olives, and sun dried tomatoes on it. I'd never had sun dried tomatoes before but they tasted much like a candied tomato. They were very good and the combination of flavors on our pizza was perfect.  The crust was one of the best I've had. Not too thick, not too thin. The flavor of the crust was really spot on as well. 

We finished our meal with a flour less chocolate cake. It was very rich but was actually very good. If it were just for one person it would be too much to eat after a great big meal. However,  since it was split between the 3 of us it was just right. 

Service was good overall. We thought the waiter was a little slow to clear our plates but he was Johnny on the spot with drinks. To me, that means more. I'd rather be left to look at the dirty empty plate as a memorial to the wonderful meal I'd just consumed than have a clear table with an empty cup."}
{"text":"Pizza is one of those things like hot dogs and certain other foods that some people feel they have to make sweeping claims that the style they know/prefer is the \"best\" and anything else is unacceptable.  It always makes me wonder why they would go to the trouble of going to a restaurant other than their \"favorite\" and then giving it a bad review because they didn't like it.

Anyway, this review of Upper Crust Pizza isn't going to rate the pizza as \"best or worst\", it will simply tell you what I experienced and you can choose if you want to try it or not.

We got there a little early in the evening last night and it was almost empty, not looking good.  But within an hour the place was bustling.  Let's look at some of the key things restaurants are rated on:

- Service.  Could not have been better. Our server (from Jersey complete with cool accent) was awesome in every way.  Tremendous energy, personality and just a lot of fun.  Score: 5

- Price.  We had a \"small\" pizza (which at 16\" is what every other pizza place calls a \"large\").  It was $10.99 plus toppings (@ $1.50 each).  This would be considered a great price, BUT their special was you could buy any pizza and get any pizza free.  That came out to be probably the lowest price pizza in town!  Score: 5

- Ambience.  The place is clean, funky, fun and not pretentious.  What I loved is that the bar was in a totally separate room so all the loud drunks were far away from the dining area.  There are large-screen TV's on two walls, but they didn't overwhelm the room and thankfully the sound was turned down.  The background music was classic '40s vocals played at a reasonable volume.  Score: 5

- Food.  I know pizza.  I've eaten virtually every type and enjoy variety.  I usually try to order my pizza the same way on the first visit to any pizza place ... pepperoni, sausage & mushroom ... which allows me to compare \"apples to apples\".  If you've ever been lucky enough to eat at America's first pizzeria, Lombardi's in NYC, you will find that Upper Crust is an incredibly accurate comparison to the Gold Standard.  I found out why.  Virtually everything is hand-made on the premises ... dough, sauce, sausage, even the cheese.  Who else does that?  And that difference can be discovered with the first bite.  To my taste, it is flawless.  Our second pizza was the Upper Veggie (artichoke hearts, mushrooms, onions, basil pesto, to which we added ham). While far from being a \"traditional\" pizza it was awesome.  Score: 5

- Beverages.  Extensive wine list paired with an equally extensive on-tap & bottled beer list.  Score: 5

So there you have it, Upper Crust earns a rank of 25.  What's that?  I can't add up the individual scores?  Sigh.  Ok, have it your way.  But PLEASE don't come back with any reviews whining that their pizza isn't as good as Domino's or that it's not deep dish.  If you do, I'll whack ya one!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Pizza in North Phoenix.  Not even a competition.  The patio is good for enjoying a glass of wine on the patio while having a slice.  

Two sides of the restaurant make if family friendly.  Good place to watch the game on the bar side if you want a quiet enjoyable spot with great food.

Amazing HH specials on top of everything else."}
{"text":"Food was good.  Service was questionable.  From the moment we walked in we felt more like strangers than guests.  The server and hostess acted as if it was weird to have patrons walk in and the dining room was empty.  Our order was screwed up by our waiter and the other service staff was literally walking around near our table having personal conversations about things that do not belong in a professional environment.  Where is management???  Would not recommend or return."}
{"text":"We LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this Upper Crust for a family meal!! Thank you, Mr. Owner, for NOT allowing dogs at your RESTAURANT!! My kid is highly ALLERGIC to dogs!!! Dogs do not belong at a restaurant!!! Take them to the dog park!!! How many of these dogs mark their territory with a quick whiz??? Disgusting!! 

Don't get me wrong, we LOVE dogs!! We can't have one because of our son's allergies, but we have had dogs all of our lives prior. We just strongly feel that dogs do NOT belong at a restaurant!! 

Also, THANK you for keeping families away from the bar!!! There have been too many times when we have witnessed drunks acting out when we have our kids and it is SCARY for them!!!! Besides that, I think a lot of adults would PREFER not to have little ones around when they are having a grown up time!!! I think you, Mr. Owner, are making SMART decisions!!! 

We will support you MORE OFTEN because of your decisions!!! 

I do not like the fact that people are not rating your food or experience, but instead are whining about your smart choices!! 

People, ignore the bashers and support this local family business!!!! You will enjoy the food, the service and the experience!!!"}
{"text":"The pizza is AMAZING! Honestly the best tasting pizza I have ever had (And I have had a lot). Prices are reasonable and it's great that you can go into either the restaurant side if you want to be romantic or the bar side for a more relaxing environment. Such a great concept and simply amazing food. I have been here plenty of times and even for my birthday with a group of nearly 20. Great service, food and overall somewhere everyone MUST go to and try (The pizza that is)."}
{"text":"Hands down the best pizza in North Phoenix. How am I just now discovering this place??"}
{"text":"The pizza was good. Their small is actually a large. So if you want a medium, go for the kid size? Good beer selection. The wings were on the weak side, but it wasn't bad.

The service was questionable. At first we had good service. We had order 3 beers, 1 pizza, and a 12 pc wings. I asked if I can have 2 different sauces for the 12 pc. So when I got the check, I was charged for 2 orders of the 6 pc. There was a price difference of 1 dollar. Personally, I dont really care about that $1. But the server made it a point that it was our fault. Clearly it was not. And why would it matter? Made our experience a terrible one by not accommodating our tiny request. It was the stupidest disagreement about $1. Emotions were running high. We came in a very good mood, but we left with foul vibe."}
{"text":"Amazing evening.  Had a great paint night with Chelby.  Laura our server was fabulous.  Delicious food and nice wine selection."}
{"text":"Stopped in for Happy Hour with the Girls, Happy Hour was great and HH menu was perfect.  Great house white, and best Bruchetta."}
{"text":"This is my first time here with a friend. Awesome fried mozzarella, terrific service! Waitstaff is super friendly and service is fast!!
Will definitely be back sooner than later!"}
{"text":"Great service, decent food. I went here with my family for dinner and the staff was extremely friendly and nice. The pizza was ok, we ordered two large pizzas, one was all cheese and the other was half veggie and half buffalo chicken. My husband said he enjoyed the buffalo chicken the most, I preferred the cheese. I didn't get to try the veggie but my mom said it was very good. The bruschetta was very tasty and I would recommend trying it. We also really enjoyed their pizookie, and if you like warm cookies and ice-cream I would highly recommend trying it!"}
{"text":"So I walked into Upper Crust and then totally felt like I was transported to Patsy Grimaldi's. The Decor, the glasses, the tablecloths I mean everything was identical.  I love Grimaldi's so I guess this isn't a bad thing for me.  So after sitting down I was given a menu and again blown away it's Grimaldi's menu but vertical not horizontal.  This was just getting weird, but I was there so I went with it.  I placed my normal Caesar salad small as it's huge (just like Grimaldi's) and a pizza with just sun dried tomato's for topping.  Prices are similar to Grimaldi's so nothing wrong there for good food.  The pie is identical except no coal flavor from the oven which is good because I can still say Grimaldi's is my favorite."}
{"text":"Update: Due to Steve's response, I'm changing my 1-star review to 3-stars. I still disagree that the chicken we reveived could be considered boneless wings (maybe three of them...they rest were truly tiny), and the mozzarella dough was raw upon receiving. The explanation of why baking didn't help makes sense though. I will update again after I try the place out again, and likely scrub what I previously wrote if all goes well. Everyone deserves a second chance.

-----------------------

First impressions are so important. This was takeout. $19 after tax, my boyfriend got a TINY portion of buffalo chicken and 6 fried mozzarella pockets with dough that was still raw. Good thing they included 2 giant cups of ranch for all that (lol) chicken and one small cup of marinara for the 6 somewhat large mozzarella pockets. I always wanted to try this place. Guess I'll pass!

Update: Ok, after a little online research magic... This is to the owner. 

Steve, I want to like you and your restaurant(s). You are probably a nice guy to those that know you and I align with you politically. However, you are way too defensive when it comes to addressing Yelp complaints. Some deserve the attitude (like the girl and her multiple beers... love how you checked the camera!), but others had valid complaints and the tone of responses seemed unnecessary. MY complaints are valid, yet I'd be afraid to actually speak to someone there and get flak (me and my German/Irish temper...). How about apologize when apologies are due and vow to do better?"}
{"text":"Stopped here on the way back from a night of riding motocross. We were both starving so anything is good. Ordered a large pepperoni that came to be about $20. We ripped into it, and it's one of the few times I've had bad pizza. Sauce was sour, crust was reminiscent of a ritz cracker. Honestly you have to make a really shitty pizza for two dudes who are starving to both hate every bite."}
{"text":"Saw this place from the freeway and stopped in after work because I wasn't ready to fight traffic during the afternoon rush hour.  Great little place with a nice comfortable bar/lounge area, a friendly bartender, and some fantastic happy-hour deals. $3 wines?  At least I'll know where to send the search party if my wife ever disappears.  The generic \"red\" wasn't bad, either, although I'm relatively sure it comes in boxes, not bottles.  

The caesar salad was huge, as were the spinach dip and meatball appetizers.  There was some sort of pizza special, but the wife and I were already way too full to eat anything else. I guess we'll have to go back. Definitely during happy hour."}
{"text":"I LOVED this place but i just came here for lunch and i just literally had the WORST experience ever with an unfamiliar waiter,  he had absolutely no motivation while taking our order and he was slow and seemed to be out of it. He took an unnecessarily long time with every interaction with us and we were finally able to place our order nearly 30 minutes after arriving. My friend ordered a salad and when it arrived it took over 10 minutes to get a fork  - I believe they wanted him ti eat it with his fingers. 

Unless management finds some new non-drug addict employees I do not think I will be returning."}
{"text":"Went in on Sunday 6/26/16 afternoon, there were 5 people sitting at the bar, no one sitting at tables, we opted for a high top table, in the middle of the room, directly in front of the bar. The bartender clearly saw us walk in, but said nothing. After waiting for @ 10 minutes, the bartender finally went and told the waitress we were there. She brought us our menus, including a happy hour menu, which clearly stated Monday-Friday. When she came back to take our drink orders, I asked her why she brought a happy hour menu that wasn't applicable. She stated they do happy hour on weekends now. We ordered drinks and appetizer. The meatball sliders were amazing (as always). We then ordered a pizza. While we were waiting for our pizza, a table of 4 walked in, sat down at the table next to us and eventually after 10-15 minutes walked up to the bar and asked for menus. Our pizza arrived and of course there were no red onions on the chicken bbq pizza as stated in the menu. The two kitchen staff blamed each other and the waitress blamed the kitchen....my pizza passed through at least 3 people and no one notices a major component of the pizza missing...? Another party of 4 walked in and after 10 minutes of waiting walked out. The waitress was dumbfounded, she came over to our table and asked where they came from. We told her they had been sitting 2 tables down from us the whole time, she said she never saw them....guess the bartender didn't either. Wouldn't you know it, another person walked in and sat down at a table and after a few minutes, we actually went and told the waitress she was there...seriously, do your damn job!

Well during our meal, we noticed 7-8 open bottles of wine sitting on the bar and two people pouring themselves glasses. So we asked the waitress what was going on there. She said they had a wine tasting for the staff at 9:00am and that's what was left over. She then stated that's probably why she didn't see those people sitting at the table, she sampled too much wine too early in the am. At this point we are appalled. If only the liquor board would have walked in to see that one! We told her that was illegal to have open bottles sitting on the bar and letting people pour them, she said she didn't know that, we assured her that her bartender probably did.  Did I mention the two people sitting at the bar pouring themselves glasses were employees still sitting there drinking? I have a picture of the wine bottles sitting on the bar, if only knew how to upload them to this post. I took that picture at 1:30pm and the wine tasting was at 9:00am. 

We love the food at Upper Crust (when it's made accordingly), but every time we go back, the service gets worse and worse. The bar décor is great, we do love that, but why on earth would you have 20 television all turned to the same channel? I guess if you like soccer it's fine, heck the bartender might even talk to you, if you talk about the game!! At this point, I think it's safe to say, we will not be giving them any more tries. Great food, worst customer service ever!

After reading several similar reviews with no response from management or owners, I think it's safe to say from a customer standpoint, no one within Upper Crust on Cave Creek gives a shit."}
{"text":"the service wasn't very good and the food was mediocre at best.  I was disappointed because friends have told me the food is amazing.  Perhaps it was just bad timing? Either way,  I doubt ill be spending any more money or time there."}
{"text":"Had the spinach dip, personal Margherita pizza and Sant Tan Devils Ale! Food was bomb and beer was delish. Kind of disappointed the Deschutes Mirror Pond was out, but San Tan is a great substitute. Waitress was super friendly and helpful! 

Great atmosphere in the bar area and the regulars were a lot of fun!"}
{"text":"Our new pizza spot!!! Restaurant is tucked away but a gem- it's a must try!! Very clean and staff is great. Mediterranean salad was delicious. Ricotta cheese and pepperoni pizza was even better. Kids got a dough ball for entertainment. Pick up is available too."}
{"text":"Definately one of my favourite places.... everything is home made... including the mozzarella EVERY DAY.... it certainly makes their deep fried mozzarella the best I have ever had....

add that cheese to the thin crust fresh sauce pizza... amazing.

Went on a Wednesday for 1/2 bottle of wine... great deal with large portions on food

Staff always friendly and make the dining experience even better.

Can't wait for the weather to cool down to enjoy that patio...."}
{"text":"So far, so good. Just stopped in to try out a togo order (craving some hot wings) and I'm impressed by how much its changed since the sportsbar was here."}
{"text":"The food is legit, don't get me wrong, but we sat outside and asked what the happy hour specials were. Our server listed them off and then said he would be back with our waters. We put our order together and waited for him to come back. And waited. And waited. After 2 cigarettes, we figured he didn't want our money and left. As we left, he was standing at the bar hanging out with the other staff. We came in prepared to spend money. Oh well."}
{"text":"Huge improvement in the bar area over Native New Yorker and Brickyard. The wine is a bit pricey ($7 a glass) so maybe it's better to split a bottle or go during happy hour.  Or just order beer.  I didn't get to try the food yet but I'm guessing it will be decent.  They've done a great job on the renovation.  The bar is now totally open and you can see all the TVs from anywhere you sit.  This place will be great during NFL Sundays.  Also, they've added a patio!"}
{"text":"The husband and I went here for dinner (after wanting to come here for years...literally since we tried them at the Yelp Pley date...whoa) on Friday night after a not so good happy hour somewhere else. We were pleasantly surprised by their amazing service...they were on top of their game, friendly, helpful, attentive. The place was SO busy! I couldn't believe it. Despite this, we were seated fairly quickly. The food was good, we split a 'personal' pizza and the appetizer meatballs. The meatballs are really good, very juicy, and topped with house made mozz... yummy. The pizza was thinner than I expected, but it was tasty...you know what made it better? Putting some of the meatball on it...so good. Here is the weirdest part....their pizza was even better as leftovers...seriously, microwaved leftovers....it got crunchier and just was awesome...that is a good thing to note since leftover pizza isn't always so good. I would definitely make the trip out here again."}
{"text":"Good food and good service, ive actually been ordering from here for a while. The only reason they got 3 stars are because of the prices. Very over priced."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times now, and it's been usually great!

I love the patio and the fact that the patio is only for age 21 and up.  On a nice night, it's great to sit out there having a drink and eating their delicious pizza!  I also love that they have one of my favorite beers, Ace Pear Cider!  Not many places carry cider, so this is a huge bonus!  

There were still seats available at 6:30 in the evening, so it wasn't too full.  The wait staff has always been pleasant and nice.

I do love their pizza!  I'm from Chicago and I feel like I am a bit of a pizza snob, but I love their thin sausage pizza!  They use such fresh ingredients and I love their mozzarella.  So fresh and delicious!  I also like their Mediterranean salad.

I have ordered pizza to go from here twice, and both times I wasn't super impressed with it.  I think once I got it home it was cold and just not as good.  But I know I love it when I'm there!"}
{"text":"We did not eat but everyone around us did. It smelled and looked great.  The happy hour was a great deal and the wine pour were generous for the cost"}
{"text":"This is one of our to go spots but today early Sunday afternoon my husband and i walked in to catch a game and spend some together time and we sat at the bar for about 7 mins or so...it seemed long..and we waited for bartender to greet us...he then stood in front of us making a drink for someone else no eye contact with us or a  hello ...he tended to others and mind you it was not busy...we waited another minute passed us up again so we left. Really disappointed.  All he needed to say was be right with you but we got nada!  Food is great...but guess today was an off day."}
{"text":"Pizza is great and a fair price, but I always have trouble with the takeout service.

Almost every time I go to pick up a pie, I have to fight to get the attention of the bartender to get my order...even if there no one at the bar. I get weird looks when I ask for a side of ranch and the staff isn't generally friendly."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza, spinach dip, wings! The hospitality was great! My husband and I enjoyed the vibes and the music playing had us feeling as if we were in Italy. We definitely will be coming back for a night experience."}
{"text":"I had Grimaldi's pizza the night before and really hoped this could rival or beat it, as Upper Crust is a good 15-20 minutes closer to my place.  Definitely not bad (the cheese definitely tasted fresh), but the sauce seemed a little bland and the pepperoni seemed to be just the generic, thin sliced kind you can get pre-packed at any grocery store.  All this considered, the crust was so good it elevated the whole to a pretty decent pizza. I was on the cusp of giving the restaurant 4 stars, but I had to wait ten minutes beyond the time I was told the pizza would be ready.  I'd understand if the place was packed when I got there, but it wasn't.   All in all, I liked the pizza enough to give this place another shot sometime in the future."}
{"text":"First rated when I was new to Yelp. Four stars is now only reserved for places that I deem deserve them. All comments previously posted are still valid, it's just my star ratings have now been adjusted."}
{"text":"We had a group of 12 and received really lousy service.  They also played a little \"bait and switch\" game with their happy hour prices.  When you enter there is a big board with happy hour prices and specials. What they don't tell you is that you have to go through another inside glass door to go into the bar area to get the happy hour special pricing.  In the restaurant they charge the regular rates.  And they won't allow you to go to the bar and bring your drink back to your table.  For average food and poor service, I can go to McDonalds and have a beer at  home.  The Upper Crust won't be getting my business again."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I stopped in here tonight after attempting unsuccessfully to get a table at two other restaurants. We arrived for happy hour and sat in the bar. We were greeted fairly quickly which was nice! I got wine (house white for $3!!) and the fiancé got a beer. We got the cheese focaccia and each got a pizza. The food was delicious, service was awesome and prices were to die for. It was pretty calm for a Friday night too! We will definitely be coming back.  Great place!"}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place because it was a) 3 minutes from my house, b) cute, and c) the servers were always nice. However, it simply wasn't meant to be. The food here is just not good. 

The pizza I ordered on the first occassion was oddly juicy, soggy, and cardboard-like (pesto, cheese, onion, tomato).

The pasta I ordered on the second visit had NO TASTE AT ALL. It was like that stuff in a can from Chef Boyardee. Bland and crappy. Luckily I ordered it via take-out and was able to season it myself at home with organo, garlic salt, and onion powder to make it edible. 

You'd think I'd give up after two terrible experiences, but I'm no quitter! I took my brother there for a lunch date and suffered a 3rd disappointment- The calzone I ordered was the same soggy, cardboard tasting mess as the pizza I had there the 1st time. Except the tomato sauce tasted of cigarette ash! UGHHH!"}
{"text":"Woowza!!!! I've been here five times and I can't believe it's taken this long to \"yelp\" them. Tonight was the kicker! I ordered the veggie pizza and added pepperoni, plus a caesar salad with chicken. What got my heart (which everyone other items on their menu has, but not like this) veggie pizza and added pepperoni. The veggies are so fresh . The artichoke hearts are smokey and the perfect blend of the veggies, touched with the perfect amount (not too much) pesto. I'm not the biggest fan of Caesars, but my hubby really loved the dressing and the freshness of the salad and best of all fresh grilled warm chicken. We will be regulars on a weekly basis for sure. The prices are in expensive for the quality of food too."}
{"text":"Upper Wine Pizza and Bar has a very chill atmosphere and had delicious food.  I came here with a generous Groupon.  The menu had a great mix of items from pizzas, wings, salads, sandwiches, and a whole lot more.  We were initially were heading for wine tasting, but we decided for a place that combined food and wine.  We got a chance to sample between 2 different Pinot Grigios, and the one we chose had a sweetness, but not as sweet as a Riesling.  The wine went perfect with our BBQ Chicken Pizza.  To start off, we got a Caprese Salad.  I could taste the authentically made cheese the server raved about.  I was very excited for our pizza, and it did not disappoint.  I really wish I had 2-3 stomachs because the pizza was heavenly, and they give you A LOT of food.  I would say a small pizza is good for 2-3 people.  Overall, we had a very pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Just ordered a pizza with pepperoni, sausage, and onion.,,really good pizza!! Spinach dip is also really good! Good place to go!! Yum!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE the pizza here. So good. Thin crust, great sauce. Wish they had a 'little' better wine selection but otherwise I love this place. Had pizza and a house salad. The salad was yummy. Lots of stuff in it. All in all I would recommend this place for sure. It's not the greatest location but since it's been there for over three years now, looks like it's gonna make it."}
{"text":"Went with Ashley L. and another friend.  We got seated right away and enjoyed our pizza.  That fresh mozzarella is great.  I didn't like the way they take orders, via iPod Touch, but I think that is just how things are changing and eventually it will be the norm."}
{"text":"Absolutely, hands down my favorite pizza place in the valley. From the fresh, made in house motz to the perfectly crispy thin crust, I crave this place weekly, almost daily if I'm reminded of it! The wings are also phonominal! You ever get those nasty wings with soggy skins & waaay too much sauce! Well you won't here! They even have a stupid hot sauce that will knock out your taste buds, but can be an awesome way to earn $50 by your friends daring you to eat 3, which i regretfully accomplished. But after the incinerating feeling goes away its still an amazing wing! Also i love the patio on a beautiful Arizona evening with the perfect slice. Highly recommended & enjoyed."}
{"text":"Second time here, first was when a friend had the high school graduation dinner and had multi pizzas and pasta which were excellent.

Came here in a Tuesday evening and found out the large specialty pizzas were $12.00. We ordered the Upper Trio and the Margarita Pizzas. 

The Upper Trio was excellent! Generous amount of pepperoni, sausage and meatballs. The crust is excellent and the type of pizza you fold to eat. I like the slight burnt spots so you know it is cooked just right with not overly over cooked. 

My daughter had the Margarita and she said it was very good so getting a thumbs up from her you know it was good.

Their pastas are also excellent and previous we had the Alfredo Pasta and Meatball Pasta which each were so good.

I really enjoy their food each time we dine here and beginning to slide up into a top 5 pizza place for me.

Will be back soon for more"}
