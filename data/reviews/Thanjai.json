{"text":"Good south Indian food, I had \"Maysore Masala Dosa\" which i would rate 4 out of 5. Sambar- the lentils were the best I had so far in Montreal but it was in a tiny-miny bowl. Usually sambar is what you get to eat the most at least in India. The one thing which I didn't like was the service was slow & I wish I was offered more sambar"}
{"text":"Very clean, great service and reasonable prices. Had lunch on this occasion.  Great for vegetarians and meat lovers alike. Large choice of dishes on the menu, decent portions and authentic dishes and presentation.  Food is very tasty, fresh and well presented.   The waitress is super nice and patient; she will make sure to describe all the dishes if you aren't familiar with them. They will even ask if you prefer the food spicier or not spicy at all.  Street parking only with payment at the meter. They accept all major credit cards and have Wifi."}
{"text":"On a family tour to Montreal for the weekend with family and we hit this place two nights in a row. It is the best South Indian food I have had in North America, and this is coming from a guy who has eaten fair share of Dosas in famous NJ restaurants. Saturday night was jam pack and still manager managed to squeeze us in without a long wait. One small advice - if you are going here for the weekend, make sure u make reservations in advance, coz looks like it gets fully booked. We also stopped in on Sunday, and food was spot on amazing. All different dosas we tried were great. If you like spicy dosa - Manglore mirchi masala dosa is the best you can order from the menu."}
{"text":"Arguably the best South Indian restaurant on the island. Started off with the Medu Waddas which were sublime they were presented with a coconut chutney. My friend ordered the Chicken 65 and Chilli Chicken both were great. Warning: If your spice game is not up to snuff avoid the chilli chicken.  My main was two Masala Dosais stuffed with chicken. The texture and taste were good, personally I would've preferred it more spicy but hey there'll be a next time so will definitely ask. The meal was capped with a mango lassi and a chai which were both delightful. Would recommend this place to anyone who's been to the subcontinent and who've actually been south of Bombay and craving the cuisine. Few steps from Metro Plamondon."}
{"text":"I'm from South India, my dad is from Madras (Chennai) and my mom from Bangalore. And when I crave SOUTH Indian food, most times it's hard to find because most restaurants are North Indian. Then add to that they're run by bangladeshis (nothing against them but they should just run delicious Bengali restos, but I digress).   Thanjai is authentic South Indian and even the owner is South Indian and he cares about his food deeply. So come enjoy the dosas and idlies  and don't forget to order the indian coffee! (South Indians NEVER drink chai!!!)"}
{"text":"We ordered the chicken Masala Dosa. The chicken filling was fragrant and spicy. A melange of complex spices cooked with pieces of chicken was highlighted by peppery coriander. My table mates were too busy wiping their brow of sweat cause by this dish and taking straight shots of yogurt to put out the fire; I for one didn't feel a thing, and contemplated wiping my face with the dosa."}
{"text":"Thanjai is the only place on the Island of Montreal to serve a range of authentic South Indian food. Dosa, wada, South Indian style curries in coconut milk, savoury rice dishes, tasty but still healthy desserts -- this is just a small sampling of the food on offer. If you haven't tried it go for it now: it is very affordable (BYOB), has friendly staff and ambience and nice decor. I've taken innumerable friends to this resto and they've all thanked me profusely! Last I was there was to celebrate my birthday and we got a long table on the side all to ourselves. I brought balloons and party hats (!) and it was a fun and memorable event. Plus they have a large room downstairs where you can throw a private party, hurrah!"}
{"text":"Bad food Briyani was stale and the fish curry was of bad quality . When I complained to the waitress I was told that it's was impossible to make Briyani every day ."}
{"text":"Went with friends on Friday evening. It was good that we had made a reservation as they were super busy. Ordered platter of vegetarian appetizers and dosas as the main course. Everything was delicious! Spice level was high so be warned when ordering dishes marked as hot (2 chilis) if you're not used to spices.  Unfortunately the service was really really really slow. It took almost an hour for our main code 2 to arrive after ordering. The appetizer came soon but we finished it way before the food came and had to wait a long time. The servers were very friendly and nice but obviously couldn't deal with all the customers and avoided looking at us as they ran from table to table. We waited half an hour trying to get someone's attention for the debit card machine then eventually went up to the counter where a number of disgruntled customers had come as well. They need to increase their numbers especially on busy evenings and also get more debit card machines to go around! I would go again for the food but never on a weekend evening!"}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant twice. Both times the service has been awful. Trying to get the waiters attention is almost impossible. They made several mistakes both times. I waited a half an hour for samosas and over an hour for my main chilli chicken dish. The samosas were dry and very peppery. My girlfriend ordered a dish that smelled so awful we had to send it back. I won't be coming here again and if suggest you stay away too."}
{"text":"Excellent and authentic South Indian food. Restaurant specializes in dosas so that's what we had. So many choices.  Although not at all traditional, they even had chocolate dosa made with Nutella for dessert.   The only downside is the price. A bit too high for a type of food that is very cheap to make."}
{"text":"When we discovered this gem (thanks to yelp) we came here first with a little trepidation.   We love dosa but have been a little spoiled by India, Singapore, and Jersey City.   Well this is our second time here for brunch and guess what: we are coming here for dinner too! Yes, it is that good.   The staff are awesome. Friendly, very pleasant, and efficient too.   For those of you unfamiliar, dosa is like a 24 inch crepe except it is made from lentil and rice flours. You judge them the same way.   They should be crispy around the outer 6inches or so, at least, gradually giving way to a softer centre where the filing is.   A really GOOD dosa is crispy further and is even crispy on top over the filing. And of course this is precisely what you get Thanjai.   The choice of fillings is very extensive.  If you like Indian food it is impossible you won't be spoiled for choice. The difficulty is settling on one.   If dosa isn't your bag, don't worry. Aside from all the other for bread based dishes (idly etc) there are all the  usual curries and rice based dishes. And of course nans.   Enjoy."}
{"text":"We visited this restaurant earlier this year on our trip to Montreal. Authentic south Indian food, very good service and reasonably priced. We were in Montreal for 4 days and we went to this restaurant 3 nights in a row. It was that tasty- we have rarely eaten at such a good restaurant outside of the Bay Area and Edison, New Jersey. I would highly recommend"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. We have been many times, and the only disappointment is when they are too booked to fit us in. We recommend the mushroom masala dosa. Make sure you book on popular days and bring your own beer or wine."}
{"text":"The food at Thanjai restaurant is outstanding. Crisp dosas, flavourful filling, tasty coconut chutney and sambar that you want to drown in.   My low rating is because of a poor service experience. My husband and I turned up one weekend evening and were told that there were no available tables. Half the restaurant was empty and tables had reserved signs on them. Fair enough. So we asked if we could place an order for take-out. To this the manager replied that they were not taking take out orders because the kitchen was very busy.  We have ordered take-out from Thanjai before so this change in policy seemed quite flippant. The information also did not square with the fact that the restaurant was still half empty.   I was 7 months pregnant and craving their imly chutney when this happened. I'll go back for sure, because the food is great. But it will take several perfect meals with decent service to restore my love for this restaurant."}
{"text":"We are very excited to have triedThanjai--we'll be back!  I have tried a number of Montreal Indian restaurants over the years, and have become disenchanted with my previous favorites. A Sri Lankan friend recommended Thanjai to us, and we are very excited to have tried it-we'll be back!  We made a reservation because we were going for dinner on Boxing Day.  Once we got there it didn't really seem as though it had been necessary, but it did start to fill up while we were there.   We were very warmly welcomed and greeted with genuine smiles. The ambiance wasn't fancy but very warm and inviting, good for families or a meal with friends or a date. For me it was perfect, especially the orange walls!  Restaurant and bathroom were both clean.  The wait for the food was just right and well-paced. A number of different servers waited our table, but it was seamless and every one of them was friendly and professional. There wasn't one error in the order despite the variety of servers who attended us. The serving staff was very attentive and answered all of our questions with knowledge and patience.  We appreciated their teaching us details about which spice combinations were in which dishes, and topographical and climatic information about the regions from where the dishes originate. For example, we learned that the cardamom, curry leaves, and black pepper in the Chettinad chicken curry are particular to that regional dish because that is the region where they are grown.  The four of us shared and really liked everything we ordered:  S-1 Rassam soup (super yummy and comforting consistency--my dinner companions determined it was one of their favorite parts of the meal.) S-3 Thanjai special soup (clear base, a bit spicy, full-flavored and delicious, great if you have a cold!) B-3 Parotha bread (really good and hot, a bit crunchy on the edges and softer in the center, more layered than other paratha I've had.  It reminded me just a bit of Yemenite malawach, which I love. We were glad we had ordered it.) A-2 Chile Bhaji (It was satisfying and novel for me to be able to order two whole large fried chilies! They were okay but not as spicy or juicy as I had hoped for, and the batter wasn't particularly interesting to my taste.  I don't know if I broke with authenticity but I squeezed some lemon and sprinkled some salt on them. The tamarind sauce that accompanied it was good.) A-6 Medhu vada (We liked these very much. Present but mild spiciness in the \"doughnuts\". Interesting lentil flavor.  Nice and crunchy exterior without being too oily.) D-3 Cheese/garlic dosa (My daughter and our friend really liked this. It was very tasty, although I wouldn't have guessed that a \"melty\" cheese is typical of South Indian cuisine. It was sort of like an Indian quesadilla! The garlicky flavor was great.) DM-10 Phav Bhaji dosa/Mumbai street style (very good.) All of the condiments were very good and plentiful. C-7 Chettinad Chicken curry (really good, a little spicy) + a side of rice  We had the fun of watching another party order and dig into a 6-foot dosa, which took two servers to deliver. We learned that it is common for South Indian families to share those super-long dosas.   My friend and I shared a good strong Canadian ginger beer, and my daughter had a mango milkshake (made with vanilla ice cream) which she enjoyed for dessert, but we'd get the mango lassi next time (made w. yogurt), because it seemed to contain much more mango than the milkshake.  In our opinion the value was super by any standards, and being from the USA, we benefited from the exchange rate being in our favor. Some menu items seemed inexpensive and others average. Nothing seemed expensive. It is a nice feeling when you pay a bill and really feel good about it!  If you go, ask for Nandakumar and tell him that the family of 3 people from VT and the insistent French-speaking Quebecoise woman sent you there! We can't wait to go back and just may have to make Thanjai an international destination trip!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were in Montreal in April, and our visit to Thanjai was so memorably delicious that we put it on our priority list for when we returned this month. My husband had lived in South India for 8 years, and he deemed Thanjai both authentic and delicious (having never been to India myself, I could only vouch for the deliciousness). Everything was fantastic - everything. Friendly service, tasty menu, excellent Bollywood playlist - what's not to love?"}
{"text":"Pretty good. I wouldn't go out of your way (which we did). The dosa was good, but my husband ordered a chicken dish that took forever to come out! I was already far done my dosa by the time it came out, so that was unfortunate. Also the uttapam was way too thick.. not how it should be. I wouldn't recommend and wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"OMG.... What an amazing place!!! I haven't had this good South Indian food even in New Jersey. Love the options and variety of dishes. The South Indian coffee was definitely the highlight for me."}
{"text":"Excellent!! A MUST GO! This place is a gem in the city of Montreal, Loved everything about it. Their food was delicious, served hot and in a very nice, traditional way. The service was spontaneous and very humble & courteous. If you are visiting,make sure you don't miss out on this place. Its a kids friendly place and can get extremely busy, so making prior reservation is highly recommended."}
{"text":"Food is definitely good. We had dosa, chicken and a lentils plate, and everything tested homemade good. Why only three stars when the food deserves 4.5 stars, the toilet attack of piss, pretty bad."}
{"text":"Delicious and well priced! Safe for vegetarians! This is the only truly South Indian restaurant I have been to in town."}
{"text":"Worst service ever ... no staff n too much crowd.. food was not at all fresh ... rude staff... made on call reservation but still need to wait for 1hr 20min ... first n last visit to this place"}
{"text":"South Indian food done right. The majority of the menu is dedicated to dosas, however they also have other options that are worth exploring.  I ordered the chicken kothu, and loved it. It was a huge portion, very flavorful, great ratio of chicken, egg, paratha and veggies. I got it medium, which I must warn you, it was VERY spicy. Coming from someone used to eating spicy food, I would recommend sticking with mild unless you can handle really hot food.  I also got to try some of my friends dosas, idlys and biryani. These were all very good as well, I don't think there is a bad menu option.   Price was very reasonable, service was prompt, and after the meal the owner came and chatted with us a bit. Had a great dining experience with a large group."}
{"text":"For cheaps eat, this is probably as good as it gets. For $10 I got a huge take-out container of fried rice and curry, plus a drink. The food was tasty as well, a bit on the spicy side. While I was waiting for my food, the lovely woman working there was very kind and informative, discussing South Indian cuisine and the origin of the restaurant; sweet, sweet woman. I hear they are moving up the street soon, and hope the service/food quality continues to be as good!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend this restaurant for authentic South Indian food. Being a South Indian, I did not go with high expectations but the food was simply amazing! Will go back again if I happen to be in Montreal.  PS.- Open a restaurant in Toronto :)"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I've been to this restaurant with family many times and the food and service has been good. However, most recently I was hosting a large family dinner and we tried to order takeout.   It took 2 hours and three attempts to finally place our order. The staff tried to be accommodating but management prevented them from doing so. The website was down, then after giving my order to the staff they called back to ask that I put everything in online as the system was \"working\". After taking the time to go through the online process, the website refused to let me complete my order. The staff at the restaurant agreed to go ahead with the verbal order over the phone....again, they called back saying that I had to go through the process once again online as management demanded it. At least the third time it worked.   After all that, the food showed up over 45 mins late and 25% of it was cold.   Overall a terrible experience and we as a family will not be returning. Please don't reward this type of business practice by eating here"}
{"text":"This is really a 3.5 but I'm rounding up because of our last take-out from here. We were visiting Montreal and typically during every trip we end up getting Indian food at least once - it is our comfort food after all. We actually went to Thanjai twice during this trip. This review is for our 2nd visit.   On Christmas Day, with very few restaurants open we decided to go to Thanjai. I ordered the Mysore masala dosa and my husband got the chicken thali. For a place that boasts of such a huge variety of dosas - my basic masala dosa was a huge fail. My husbands thali was ok - nothing too special to call out though. Despite the disappointment, we ordered more food as take-out because we didn't know if we'd get dinner elsewhere on Christmas night. We ordered the chicken 65 and the lamb biriyani. Both were phenomenal especially the chicken 65.. Just blew my mind (Side note: We had asked for both these dishes to be made spicy since we found the lunch food to be on milder side for us). The lamb itself in the biriyani was very tender. This can either make or break the entire dish and this one was perfectly cooked. Portion-wise, I felt that they were small. I typically always have leftovers with Indian food but not in this case.  Service is a little slow as others have expressed here as well. There are tons of South Indians who eat here which is a sign of authenticity. If I'm traveling through Montreal again, I'd probably go back for the chicken 65."}
{"text":"We finally found a south indian restaurant that makes real south indian food! I got to try many dishes that I have never had before, very spicy and super tasty. Menu is mostly dosas but they have just enough of everything else to find just what you want. Sometimes service is slow because it can get really busy here."}
{"text":"Overwhelming selection of food, slightly  underwhelming service. The menu items also seems to be a bit of hit and miss. For example, a friend ordered the spring paneer dosa which was deliciously flavourful, meanwhile my coriander dosa fell short of expectations and it tasted quite bland---sadly it was more mashed potato than anything else.  The server later forgot our dessert order and we had to flag them down to remind them we had actually ordered something. If you're visiting, get ready to flag folks down for service, but otherwise, it's a spot worth visiting and I will be back!"}
{"text":"Second time around was a disappointment.  Lamb Curry was mostly bones which made for a very pricey curry dish.   Had good impressions first time around but maybe curries aren't Thanjai's forte."}
{"text":"I don't think I've ever had this type of cuisine before, what a treat. Got there around 8 and it was packed with indians and hipsters ;) The vegetarian dosa is quite good, we also the lamb biryani. Had to wait a little for a table but service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Tasty, spicy, and all-round good food. If I have any criticism at all, it's two things: price; and uni-dimensional spiciness.  This is mostly Sri Lankan fast food, so should be at s lower price point, though they are obviously playing to the market price. As for spiciness, simply adding chiles to the dish does not make it better. I can take the heat, but am looking for a slow burn, not a palate-burning fire.  All told, it's a favorite nonetheless"}
{"text":"If you love Indian food then you need to try some flavours of south India as well. They have a variety of Indian dishes from different parts of India, but I'd say their specialty really is southern Indian food, dosa (crispy rice crepes), idly (steamed rice dumplings), uttapam (rice flour savoury pancake)... if in case you can't decide between trying something southern or northern, you can have both! Their paneer 65 North Indian appetizer is a great app to share, while exploring other items on the menu. They also have a super long dosa (6ft long) that is carried out by a few waiters, impressive, but greasy! There are plenty of vegetarian options!"}
{"text":"Been twice. Really good and authentic. If you're looking for butter chicken kinda western food this may be too real for you. ;-) The Sri Lankan dishes really up the anti but the dosas are great too."}
{"text":"One of my go to Indian restaurant in Montreal.  This place specializes more in South Indian food. That means (among other things) you'll have more vegetarian dishes here.  Food is always delicious and service is good. Nice music usually, good prices.  I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Went back and ordered a bunch of different things for take out. Everything was very good, but even though I asked for the dishes to be not spicy, they were extremely spicy; too spicy in fact. If you don't like even a little spice in your food, I'd say you may not want to risk it."}
{"text":"A little salty, but is really great."}
{"text":"Visiting Montreal from  DC which lacks decent South Indian restaurants, Thanjai was a great surprise.  The dosais were excellent and so were the accompanying sambar and chutney.  The South Indian coffee with which we ended our meal was perfectly brewed and presented in a dawara-tumbler. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I don't like Indian food so my review is biased. But we went there for someones birthday. The service was very slow I found. It took a very very long time to get our food. About 1 hour.  The food, EVERYTHING, was SO SPICY!!! I really had a hard time eating and finishing my plate. According to everyone else it was very good. But not for me."}
{"text":"The air was thick with humidity, the diesel of brightly coloured trucks passing along this roadside shack.  The cracking of the fire, the aromas of the dark crimson crab curry that simmers above it are in many ways not unlike the harbingers of Armageddon.  They warned you, you just didn't listen.  The sounds of seagulls listlessly gliding about the port are punctuated by occasional ship horns, as the marina winds down for the day.  Such is the scene in my mind's eye when I take a bite of Thanjai's crab curry.  Beer me, bro. Fire's starting."}
{"text":"This place serves great food in a very simple, unpretentious setting.   The waiters are often rushed and nervous and the kitchen can be overwhelmed when they get large tables and many orders at the same time, so that the food may come in a very random order.   But the food is so good that I forgive them.  My kids can't get enough of their mango lassi, roti, naan and paneer butter masala.  I love their dosas, sambar and chutneys.   There is such a long list of dosas to choose from, it's overwhelming!"}
{"text":"Some friends of mine invited us to a holiday dinner, which included free food. Yet, the idea of some random potluck over the possibility of some amazing South Indian cuisine just didn't really excite me. Especially cause this was our first time going to the famed Thanjai.   It was a Saturday evening and we walked in to a packed house. But luckily for us, it was probably towards the end of the dinner rush so there were a couple tables available (next time I'll make sure to make a reservation). The staff was super kind and attentive, and answered all the questions we had since the menu was huge and everything looked good!  Here's what we ordered: - mango lassi: either they make their own yogurt, or they know where to get some really good yogurt, but this was super tasty and you could tell it was made right. I'd come in just for that.  - appetizer platter: it was our first time so why not. In addition to the usual samosa (delicious by the way), also included a veggie roll, the bonda potato, the onion bhaji, the medhu (donut looking thingy), and I think the Podi Idly. The mint and tamarind chutney that came with it were essential not just for the appetizer but for the entire dinner. That said, mayyyyybe next time I'll just get one thing because the sampler pretty much made us full.  - PHAV Bhaji Dosa: sooooo good. If you're not into onions you might not like this one but we were all over this thing! Also came with a few sauces/dips.  - vegetable kothu: wasn't sure what to make of this, my partner said it reminded me of Egyptian Koshery, but either way, it was delish! Maybe I'd try it with meat next time.   Overall, the use of spices and cooking technique had our taste buds exploding. There's a place in Berkeley, CA called Vik's Chatt which is our favorite Indian spot, and this place brought back memories and comparisons to that (which is difficult to do)! Also, being able to skip the meat and still enjoy our meal was an added bonus.    Can't wait to come back! Definitely want to try the Thali for lunch!"}
{"text":"First of I should mention that I enjoyed my time at this restaurant. The staff were friendly and manager was chatty and very nice. My low rating is because of the scale they used to inform clients about the level of spice in their food. As a person who was in several Indian restaurants I can say that they underestimate spices in their food, and for some people with allergic reactions it can not be very good."}
{"text":"I came here for my birthday in March with a group of 20 ppl. We requested in advance to be seated in their basement (it's a 2 floor restaurant) but they refused. This is where the giant Jenga pieces start falling for me- oh dear. We were seated at two tables smack in front of the entrance. Traffic was at a max-which took away from the event.   We came for the 6 ft dosa but there were \"technical problems\" with the batter. Seems kind of unrealistic when normal sized ones are coming out at the speed of light. So we were offered two 3ft dosas.  Upset (the whole purpose of my event got ruined) we got the two 3 ft dosas. Wait-it gets worse!  They decide to give us one serving of fillings and chutney for a table a table of 10! YIKES. So we agreed to pay extra for additional fillings that came frozen/ literally just thawed and plopped in a bowl - I could taste the ice pellets melt in my mouth.  Then the cherry on top: the waiter was so overwhelmed my friend helped divide the bill, clean up and pack!!!! Unbelievable!!  So in summary: DON'T order the 6 ft dosa or come in a large group. Stick to a normal sized one to have your happy ending."}
{"text":"I am being generous and giving this two stars.  My girlfriend and I ordered take out from here and the food arrived cold an hour after quoted delivery time.  Food tasted good when reheated, but it was an expensive meal to have to reheat...  Staff was not accommodating when I called them about the cold food/late delivery.  To top off a poor experience, our $3 order of naan bread came with one paltry flatbread.  There are so many good Indian restaurants in Montreal, I'm going elsewhere in the future."}
{"text":"I was staying at the Quality Hotel Midtown. That is when I decided I need some restaurant food! Good thing I found THANJAI RESTAURANT! When I ordered their Biryani I ended up ordering the biryani for the rest of the week everyday. The manager didn't look at me weird because I was there everyday too, which was nice. Also I tried their Dosa, which was good. This is Southern Indian Food, so it is different from Northern Indian food. Super good! Five stars!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has amazing south Indian food, very flavorful. We ordered podu idli, chettinad dosa and vegetarian biryani and everything was so tasty. You should definitely try this place if looking for South Indian food in Montreal."}
{"text":"I've been a devotee of Thanjai for quite a while. They were in a different location for many years just down the street where they offered some of the best Indian food in Montréal. Since they've moved to their new location on Van-Horne the place has blown-the-expletive-up and for good reason. There is no other establishment in our fair city that can boast the authenticity and flair for genuine South Indian cuisine as they can, period. I'm assuming you've tasted the deep soul-searching and reaffirming soft yet crisp taste of a masala dosa -- and if you haven't ! get thee to the nunnery and make it snappy. Believe you, me ... if I could buy masala dosas on a street corner in Hochelaga-Maisonneuve; sold in a plastic ziplock baggie, then cook it up on a spoon with a zippo underneath and shoot that sweet Shabu-shabu right up into my veins, I would, oh yes I would. But I think that'd be a tad bit unsafe so in between my methadone fixes I go to Thanjai where I eat to my heart's content. The chilli garlic masala is my dosa of choice but please please do peruse their extensive dosa menu. You'll be in dosa heaven. Their lunch thali or tasting platter is excellent as well. *Notwithstanding levity: substance abuse and addiction is no laughing matter and should be treated with the due seriousness it deserves. Incarceration is never the answer. Treatment and rehabilitation is the only way to cast asunder this plight.* Go eat a masala dosa and perhaps donate to or volunteer at your local substance abuse treatment centre."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Best dosas in Montreal. Had the mango milkshake which was great along with the onion bhaji and a dosa, would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I lived in South India for almost seven years, and I find the food at Thanjai to be some of the very best as far as restaurants go. The veg thali is an excellent choice, and if you want an extra good thali, ask for poori instead of roti. Also the idli and dosa are great. The very best part is the sambar! I tried the chicken 65, and it was great too. I felt it risky to order the biryani because I normally like a Muslim biryani, but the cooking is so good here it might just be worth it. Close your eyes and point at the menu, and you will get something good."}
{"text":"Excellent South Indian dining and among the best Indian restos in Montreal. This is one place that knows what perfection when it comes down to creating their dishes. Definitely a place worth dining at!"}
{"text":"When you get inside the restaurant, you can feel it's an Indian restaurant for their color schemes and pictures of their gods and goddesses. I think Thanjai is the only one in Montreal that caters South Indian food. My favorite dish is without a doubt idly. Their repertoire of dosa are vast. Every time I go there, I try different dosas. The service is pretty long either it's super busy or they slow in the kitchen, but the servers are amiable. In the end the food is worth it. Highly recommended! It is untypical type of food compared to regular Indian restaurants who has basically the same menu."}
{"text":"Overall 8/10.Taste, quality, service, cleanliness, ambience. Liked the steel utensils used for food and water. Suggestion, since this place is dosa centric and most customers shall try eating with hands hand, bowl with water at the end would get the service level 10/10."}
{"text":"J'aurais bien aimée goutée leur bonda et leur genre de crepe, mais contrairement a ce qui est ecrit, ils ne font pas la livraison et la fille au telephone ne parle qu'anglais.... decevant"}
{"text":"It's been a while since my original review, so I thought it would be good to update over 4 years later.  So the most recent time I ordered a few different dishes: samosas, curry chicken, lamb biryani, and chili paneer. Each dish had it's own spicing so the flavors could be detected even when on the same plate. The heat level was fairly high for me, probably the hottest I'd like while still being able to taste the rest of the ingredients. However, there was something immensely satisfying about each item, and I wouldn't hesitate to try a number of other dishes in future.  Also, you can now order via Just Eat, which makes it incredibly convenient."}
{"text":"Man, I love this place. I can't handle spicy food but Thanjai is just too good. The tears are worth it.  I've tried the mysore masala dosa and the masala uttapam, and was happy both times. My next goal is to tackle that 6-foot dosa!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The decor looks better than most restaurants in Parc-Ex and the taste is pretty comparable too. I visited this place twice and was pleasantly surprised both times. The first time we ordered the (giant!) Mirch Masala dosa and the chicken biryani. The dosa was very tasty; I haven't had many in my life but I found this one to be crispy and filled with savory spiced mashed potatoes. The chicken biryani was very enjoyable but I prefer the shrimp version which I tried on my next visit. For appetizers, the bonda potato was a fun change from samosas. The filling tasted essentially the same, but instead of being wrapped in pastry dough, the spicy potato filling was fried in chickpea flour. The chilli uttapam was really unique, nice and spongey, reminding me of a tasty Ethiopian lamb crepe I had at East Africa (I should get started on that review too!). I also tried the chicken pepper curry dish, which tasted average compared to the other dishes.   I can't wait to go back to try their other dishes, especially the 6-foot long dosa! Sounds great for a party :)"}
{"text":"Went there on a Friday night at around 7h30pm. The man told us that we would've been better if we had a reservation. ..but then told us it would be about 5 to 10 min.?! So why would we need a reservation?  First thing I noticed is that this place is lit up as bright as a grocery store,  terrible for lovers. Then they sit us in between 2 tables (first 3 tables on the right) where there is no way of getting out of without bothering a person to get up and out of their chair!?  Wow, what is this place? They have nice booths all along the left side of the restaurant, but you probably need a reservation or luck to get one. The place is badly lit, bad seating arrangements,  absolutely no ambiance, packed with people and quite loud...but hey, what about the food?  Well ok. Here is my humble opinion.  We came here because there were very good reviews on TripAdvisor and Yelp, so we thought hey, let's try it! We are not familiar with the specific regional cooking specialties, so we went with what we know and love.  So we ordered rice and cheese with peas in a sauce which was brought to our table at least 7 minutes before they finally brought the rest, butter chicken and a fresh out of the plastic bag STORE BOUGHT NAAN BREAD!!  Why the wait?  The butter chicken (that tasted like no other butter chicken I've ever tasted (spicy)) had a thin crust on top meaning that it was ready and (probably) waiting at the station for 7 minutes for the STORE BOUGHT NAAN BREAD to be taken out of it's plastic bag and put in a basket.  All in all a VERY BAD FIRST EXPERIENCE.  The kind that makes me think of Gordon Ramsey's Kitchen Nightmares tv show.  P.s. If you guys can't make your own naan bread, than    get it off the menu and don't try and sell us store bought crap. You are not a depaneur."}
{"text":"I've been here many times now and have tried a few vegetarian dosas. I liked the chana masala and the onion rava masala, but my favorite is by far the mushroom masala (8.50$). All dosas come with sambar and chutney - delicious! The potato bondas are also amazing as an appetizer (3$ for 2). The only negative experience I had was when my friend ordered the spinach and lentil dish. It was 8.50$ but was very small and bland. The rice was an extra 3$. Basically, I would recommend sticking to the dosas, as that's their specialty. Staff are friendly, service is great, and it's BYOB. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Finally, I decided to try this authentic South Indian restaurant after hearing so much about it. It was a Sunday afternoon around 6 pm and when I arrived there, it was so busy so the waiter took me to my table and gave me the menus. I went through the menu and then the waiter came back around 5-7 minutes. I decided to go for the samosa chaat and chicken masala dosa.   After 10-20 minutes, my samosa chaat arrived and at first bite, I had that tangy, spicy flavour I wanted and the onions added that crunch which was delicious to the palate. I crushed my starter and then within span of minutes, the dosa came and it was so good! Totally authentic food and served with the sauces on the side with the dosa added more flavours. They were consistent, spicy and I paid around $20 with tips. Good for a night out and treating yourself when you want to try new cuisines. I'd return for sure. For sure, you get the quality for what you're paying for"}
{"text":"South Indian food: outstanding - five stars, dishes I've never had before. (Because, it turns out, I've been eating at Northern Indian restaurants. For example, naan is more of a Northern menu item-- get the dosa, a Southern menu item. Again, the food is exceptionally good. This place is busy though, so service was on the slow side. I'll definitely return. I'm craving their food again already."}
{"text":"Have been thrice over here now and loved it every single time.The food is here is authentic South Indian (I am a South Indian and can definitely vouch for it). You can check out how good the food is from the basics (chutneys and sambar , that were fresh and delicious!) to the regulars (vada (crunchy on the outside soft on the inside ..that was perfect), oh so soft idlis and uttapams and crunchy soft dosas). If you are ever craving for a proper south Indian meal have it here! The service is always impeccable and sweet."}
{"text":"Very, very spicy indian place. I reiterate spicy! The food is delicious but the spice takes over so ask for 'not spicy.' A great place for the dosas but not anything else. The Thalis are disappointing."}
{"text":"I just went to this restaurant tonight and it was so incredible that I  ate and ate and ate and couldn't stop and now I want to die from fullness.  Incredible food. 10/10 would overeat here again."}
{"text":"South Indian cuisine in neighbourhood full of South Indian restaurants. Food prepared somewhat differently from the North Indian,which most are used to, and is very spicy. The butter chicken,  which many people use as the standard to measure the quality of an Indian restaurant, was made with tomato paste, which I liked, preferred even, to the usual \"buttery,oily\" style, and came with naan. Another patron at the table, was however; not  very impressed, she prefers the usual style.The fish patties with sauce, were very good, spicy, but contained more potato than fish, the sauce was very good. The chicken dosas were 2 large pancake rolls stuffed with very spicy chicken with veggies, and came with 3 sauces, none of the cooling yogurt variety. People at the other tables were enjoying their various dishes, and everyone appeared to be happy, sated and very satisfied with the portions.. large and the prices ... small. This is a family owned/run resto, can accommodate large groups, there are 2 floors, but service is VERY slow. The temperature was also chilly inside,  many patrons kept their coats/jackets on while dining, and what's with the plastic cutlery??Thank heavens the manager/owner herself,  had the grace and presence  of mind to bring out the the regular stuff. This is also a BYOB restaurant, so  this further brings down the costs. Overall: everyone seemed happy to have been here , loved the food,  great new find,  another place will revisit."}
{"text":"They have some seriously delicious and good quality food at Thanjai! I was there last night as part of a large group for my friend's birthday, and while the service was on the slow side, the food more than made up for it.  My sister and I shared the samosa chaat and chili chicken while we waited for the 6ft dosa (or so we thought!) We asked for medium spice on the chili chicken and proceeded to lose feeling in our lips and tear up a bit haha but it was so good #worthit. The samosa chaat was a generous portion and great appetizer for 2 people, though it could have used more sauce and the onions should have been chopped more finely. It would be great to have a yogurt dip/sauce prepared when they serve very spicy food! But they were nice enough to accommodate.  We had to repeatedly ask for water - they should be more on top of that. Also, we were a little disappointed when they announced that they could not make a 6 ft dosa as advertised, but rather 2x 3ft dosas. Still delicious, more practical but not as show stopping. The fillings they served the dosa with were all delicious (mashed potatoes, coconut, tomato carrot... etc).  I like that the restaurant is BYOB, definitely made for a fun night! And overall, great food and I will be going back to try other variations of dosas."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal. The dosas are the star attraction, and there are plenty of varieties on the menu.  For my starter, the Chilly Idly was fantastic (be advised that \"medium\" on that one is still pretty spicy).  Chicken masala dosa was terrific.  I also had the lamb biryani.  The lamb meat was a tiny bit dry, but when you dip it in the yogurt sauce it was sublime."}
{"text":"A totally unexpected and shockingly pleasant surprise!!   I am a vegetarian Indian recently moved to Montreal from Atlantic coast but yet to visit Toronto. I have been mostly disappointed to infrequently mildly pleased by Indian cuisine thus far in Canada. Imagine you walk in hungry, and the ambience and pleasant coterie of well informed young Indian hosts relax you immediately with pleasant attitude and promise of authentic South Indian  food!  The promise of great culinary experience was fulfilled 100% and then some with absolutely authentic tasteful fare, that tickled my brain with wild wishes such as one (I still recall )that I wished I had many more stomachs...  To western audience, a must try to sample authentic South Indian taste by authentic chefs and management who want nothing more than spread whats great about India!!  Well done and Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"This is the best Indian food in Montreal.   - A white girl  I have a confession to make. Before I started dating my partner, I couldn't eat anything spicier than an M&M (according to my Thai-loving aunt). I've come a long way since then, but when Raj first started taking me to Thanjai so he could get his dosa fix, I was pretty wary about this Indian food business.  I couldn't have come to a better place than Thanjai for my introduction to (and continuing love of) Indian, especially south Indian, food.  While Thanjai offers many delicious dishes, the dosa's the thing here. For the uninitiated, a dosa (or a \"crêpe indienne\" in French) is a delectable, crispy, thin giant crepe enclosing the toppings of your choice and served with two delicious chutneys and some sambar. I am happy to say that I can now eat the sambar that used to make my tongue combust. IMHO, the chutneys are one of the most important/overlooked/amazing factors in this whole thing.  For a long time, I ordered a cheesy garlic dosa every time I came because as far as I'm concerned, cheese+garlic+crispy = FOOD OF THE GODS. They would always add potato masala too, which I'm cool with. But the owner finally threatened to withhold my cheesy garlic dosa and force a different menu item upon me if I didn't explore a bit more. So now I can tell you that the buckwheat-made rava dosas are also great, especially if you want to try something different with your dosa, and the garlic shrimp biryani is one of the best shrimp dishes this shellfish-loving lady has ever had.  If you want an intimate dosa experience, I recommend a plain ghee dosa (try it as an appetizer or split one with a friend in addition to your more flavourful dosa). The dollar ghee idly is another winner for those who want to taste some straight-up ghee (clarified butter). My other favourite menu items include the onion baji and the yogurt vada. I've also enjoyed picking off Raj's thali. The dahl soup is thick with spinach and not quite to my taste, but others may certainly like it. The rassam soup is still a bit too spicy for me to order but I enjoy a couple spoonfuls of Raj's rassam as long as I have some raita handy to control the damage!  Finally, a protip for others with spice-sensitive tongues who want to ease themselves into Indian food: order a big bowl of raita (savoury yogurt). You needn't fear a five-alarm tastebud fire when you have cool, creamy yogurt to smother your overambitious decisions."}
{"text":"If you are craving Dosa, this is the place to come. Not only do they have traditional Dosa, but they have creatively come up with 50 varieties to appease your interest. I went with the Masala Dosa with Garlic and Cheese. My table got the appetizer sampler while were there. The Samosa was incredible. The others were meh. But that might have been based on my preferences as opposed to the actual quality. I would highly suggest grabbing some coffee at the end of your meal. It is fantastic here! And if, big \"if,\" you have room left over, their Rice Pudding with Almonds was incredible! I can also appreciate that it was high quality food while remaining at a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"After being in Montreal for 4 long months I just lost my South Indian food virginity @ Thanjai. This is one of the really good South Indian places if not the best. They specialize in Dosas.        Dosas are crispy Indian Crepes made with rice. They are served with 2 different chutneys & Sambhar (Lentil curry). They do 51 kinds of dosas. If you get any of the \"Masala\" versions, they come stuffed with spicy potato mix. Also try their Chicken 65. Its YUMMM. Chicken Biryani is great. So is the Pepper Chicken. My only complaint is that the pepper chicken isn't boneless. Also instead of the naan, go for the Parotha.        Why didn't I get Naan???? 2 reasons....... One, its Naan of your business...... And two, Getting a North Indian dish from a South Indian restaurant is not a great move. You'd be disappointed.  I'd say order the Parotha instead. Its much much better than naan. They have lots of other things on their menu, But i'd rather stick to the things they specialize in. Definitely will be back to try other south Indian dishes  Food -  Great Service - Slow Ambiance - Casual Worth the money - Affirmative"}
{"text":"I usually go by myself, order the 6 foot dosa, and settle in for a serious snack fest!  Tasty and delicious, one of the best Indian restaurants in town!"}
{"text":"Great little South Indian place. If you go you must try the dosas of which there are many varieties. We also tried the lamb biryani, the mutter paneer, chettinad chicken, lentil soup and rasam soup all of which where excellent. Will be our go to place when were in Montreal and in need of good Indian."}
{"text":"The decor is nice and clean. The servers are knowledgeable and welcoming. Portions are just right and the food is authentic and stunning. I have been here twice and been beyond impressed both times. The vegetable kurma is spectacular. As a vegetarian, the options here are great. I also like the Channa curry. Try the lemon rice. You won't regret it. I am very new to Indian food, but of the places that I have tried this has been far and away the best, by a long shot."}
{"text":"This place is incredible, and has definitely earned it's accolades in the last couple years. Young, smart passionate team paying close attention to everything from the alkaline ionized water served to the enormous 6ft dosas at this spot that pays devoted loving tribute to the uniqueness of South Indian cuisine. We went for lunch and couldn't resist ordering way too much and it was still super affordable - two dosas, 2 savoury potato donuts, possibly the best chicken I have ever had, and two mango lassis for $30 is excellent (and delicious) value. I love the decor, the silver glasses and plates, and the charming friendly waitress who worked the whole lunch rush by herself with a smile. Big fan, can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"They bring their spices from India. They specialize in South Indian food. They are serious about it. Best Indian food I've had in Montreal. Having been to Southern India 4 times, I vouch for the authenticity.  I recommend the different dosas and the biryanis. The curries were also very flavourful.  My colleague from India picked this place, and what a place it is! Story goes that the owner, a consultant working in a large firm,  started in the restaurant business as a side job, in a little alley with 4 tables. Today they have a mid size restaurant with a private part room, and are planning to open a second restaurant somewhere downtown in the spring."}
{"text":"If you like spicy food you will love this place! The rolls were so nice and crunchy on the outside.  The curry shrimp is Amazing! If you have never tried South Indian food I recommend you try kuttu roti ! I went on a Sunday at 3pm and it was nice and quiet. kinda pricey though ."}
{"text":"It takes a lot to blow my mind when it comes to food. In Montreal there are many good and great restaurants that can prepare and serve a meal. However Thanjai truly is exceptional. If you are into the real flavours of Indian food you must come try This South Indian treasure. They deliver something intriguing and tongue tingling (flavour wise ). Also it's about a chef who can mix and deliver Indian spices that compliment and can contrast flavours in a meal.   With over 60 Dosas on the menu I had to try one. For those who have never tried Dosa it's a crispy crepe type texture filled with potato and spices whereby you break off small pieces and dip by hand in one of the three accompanied sauces. The Dosa I ate for lunch was PHAV bhaji (Mumbai street style). One of the sauces was a chickpea very nice and light. The other was a milk or yoghurt base which was cooler milder and the other was a creamy one. Healthy and flavourful and crazy amazing!   After my meal to continue on with the great flavour I ordered two dishes to go for dinner that evening. One was vegetable biryani the other chilli chicken. The chicken was ordered as a medium which was adequate spice level for me. Chicken was in a rich red sauce which was sweet but had some good spice kick to it. The biryani was so flavourful of mint, coriander and cardamom that I need to come back and indulge in more.   On the menu I LOL about the spice levels:  of Spicy, Super spicy or Supreme spice. I can only imagine the heat level of a Supreme spice. It could be akin to seeing new colours in the air and Hindu characters dancing around you while in a hallucinating dream land.   They claim to be able to do a six foot family style Dosa. It would be a great place for a group event for those who are hungry!   I asked the people working there if they were from Tamil Nadu and they confirmed yes. Then I complimented them on the fantastic flavours of the meal and said how much I enjoyed it.   If you want real deal South Indian food eat here. If you don't then I'll enjoy it thank you!"}
{"text":"One of the best dosas I've had! I ordered one of the spicier dosas that had onions, vegetables, and a bunch of spices. It was very flavorful and spicy! My friends also enjoyed their masala dosa. They have a huge selection of different dosas, along with other South Indian food. The only downside was that the food came a bit slow."}
{"text":"I'm a South Indian and I live in Toronto. I was in St Jean for 8 weeks and was dying to get a taste of home. My friend recommended Thanjai restaurant. I thoroughly enjoyed the food offered at this place and left with a big smile on my face.  I had: Sambar Vada  Masala Dosa Gulab Jamun  This all costed around 17$ which is an amazing deal. The food quality is top notch and if you are a South Indian looking for some food in Montreal, this place is as authentic as your local dosa joint in Chennai.   I also took one of my buddies who's of Caucasian descent m. He was initially worried about the spice as he'd never eaten Indian food before. His verdict was that the food was very well balanced, savoury and not at all spicy. So if you're anxious about dabbling into the Indian cuisine, don't worry, this place isn't going to set your mouth on fire.   The quantity of food is also very reasonable at this place. The only thing I would advise you to do is to make a reservation. I spent the day in Montreal and reserved a seat, in advance, on their website and boy was I glad. The place isn't very big and seems to attract a lot of people so do beware that if you don't reserve, you may end up waiting upwards of 20 minutes.  PS: this is my first review."}
{"text":"Hummm... des dosas bien croustillants! J'en rêve encore! Je suis venue ici, par une belle soirée de juillet, avec des amis végétariens. Ce n'est pas toujours facile de trouver un resto végétarien pas cher et qui plaît à tous, mais Thanjai est vraiment super!!!  En entrée, des hors--d'oeuvres divers, dont des excellents bhaji aux oignons, accompagnés de deux sauces vraiment savoureuses. Bien exécutés, on ne sent pas la friture comme dans certains restaurants indiens. En plat principal, un dosa au fromage--masala--chili: un dosage bien réussi entre le piquant du piment, la douceur du fromage et les épices des pommes de terre. Le tout est servi avec deux sauces et une sambar (soupe aux légumes épicée). J'ai tout simplement pris un thé masala pour dessert, parce que je n'avais plus faim. Dommage, car il y avait des halvas aux carottes bien tentants...  Le service est assez rapide et très courtois. Bonne équipe! La décoration est épurée, mais le restaurant est propre. De toute façon, on vient ici pour manger et non pour flasher!   Il y avait un gros groupe assis juste à côté de notre table et ils ont commandé un dosa de six pieds!!! Vraiment sympa pour partager entre les convives.  Un conseil: réserver! C'est assez achalandé, alors vous serez certains d'avoir une table.  J'ai passé une soirée fantastique et mes amis ont été enchantés par leur expérience. Je me suis promise de revenir!"}
{"text":"Best inidian food! First time here. Ordered the lentil Daal soup and the rasam soup. Delicious  Their signature masala was yummy too. Perfect  Tried the lamb biryani and the rice was fluffy and the boiled egg was still hot. So good!  So happy eat here!  Service was great! Wonderful!"}
{"text":"If you're an Indian food fan and are looking to try something new then you should definitely check out Thanjai! South Indian food is a completely unique flavour profile then what you might try at your standard Indian resto in Montreal like Maison Du Cari or Le Taj which serve up North Indian fare.   The menu is vast and most of it top notch. If you're a first timer my advice is stick to the south indian classics.   Starter:  Idlis or Rasam vada. (the first a steamed rice batter dumplings, the latter are fried) Main: Dosa! Be adventurous and prepare to get your hands a little dirty as you eat - it well taste best if you attack with your hands. Every dosa comes with sambhar - a lentil soup and chuntneys which are high quality and absolutely delicious. End: must try the south Indian filter coffee. It's unique to the south - sweet and strong.    Thanjai does a great job serving up south indian cuisine - with great service and a great ambience. It's a must try and you will want to return!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: Nous sommes allés à Thanjai un vendredi soir avec une réservation pour 20 personnes, donc ma critique est uniquement basée sur cette expérience.  Réservation: la réservation par téléphone s'est très bien passée, outre le fait qu'ils ne parlent qu'anglais, heureusement je suis pas si mauvaise que ça pour m'exprimer au téléphone en anglais. Vu que c'était pour un anniversaire je leur ai demandé si je pouvais amener un gâteau, ils ont accepté très gentiment. Ayant pris connaissance de la taille de la salle en avance et sachant qu'ils avaient une seconde salle un étage plus bas, je leur ai demandé si on pouvait avoir ma salle du bas et malheureusement ils ont refuser, ce qui a créé un petit problème je pense durant la soirée. Arrivant au restaurant nous avons été placés en deux groupes, une table de douze et une de huit personnes près de l'entrée, une table de chaque côté de l'entrée. Donc avec des gens qui passaient sans arrêt entre les deux tables pour aller s'asseoir, pas le plus agréable ou pratique.  Nourriture: La nourriture était délicieuse, je pense que dans tout notre groupe pas une seule personne est repartie en ayant faim, ou n'ayant pas aimé son plat.  Puis nous avions tous pris des petites entrées différentes du le samosa chaat au rouleau de légumes. Tout était très bon et bien assaisonné. En plat principal, comme le restaurant est réputé pour leur fameux 6 pieds Dosa, nous en avons commandé 2, un pour chaque table. Malheureusement, une fois l'heure du Dosa, le serveur nous dit qu'il y a un problème avec la pâte, et qu'ils arrivent seulement à faire un Dosa de 3 pieds et donc nous propose de faire 4 Dosa de 3 pieds. Pour tout dire nous étions vraiment déçu, nous avions précisé au téléphone que nous venions spécialement pour ça mais nous avons accepté quand même car ça reste un Dosa de 3 pieds. Le Dosa était délicieux, j'ai particulièrement aimé la farce à base de pomme de terre, extra-yummy!!  Service: Le service était correct mais je ne sais pas si ils manquaient de personnels ou d'organisation mais il y a eu des lacunes.  Nous devions constamment demander de l'eau plusieurs fois durant la soirée, car ils nous oubliaient. Ils ont eu beaucoup de mal à débarrasser les tables même quand les assiettes vides étaient clairement en évidence au bout de la table. Arrivé à l'heure de pointe le restaurant était bondé et clairement la meilleure solution aurait été d'être installés dans la seconde salle. Au niveau des commandes tout s'est très bien passé, nous avons tous eu ce dont nous avions commandé, mais arrivé à la fin ils n'avaient pas séparé les commande par personne donc j'ai dû aider pour savoir qui a pris quoi au moment de faire les transactions. Mais les serveurs étaient très gentils, ils nous ont laissés mettre le gâteau dans leur frigo, et ont fait preuve de beaucoup de patience vu que notre groupe était là bas de 7h à 11h30.   Pour finir niveau prix, en moyenne nous avons dépensé 30$ par personnes (tx et tips inclus), ce que je trouve raisonnable pour la quantité de nourriture que nous avons eu, mais au moment de payer j'ai été vraiment déçue qu'ils nous refusent un rabais sur le Dosa et qu'ils nous aient chargé en plus un extra pour des petites sauces au yaourt pour les palais sensibles aux épices. Je pense que c'est la moindre des choses d'offrir un rabais que le restaurant n'est pas en mesure de servir l'item le plus mis en avant du restaurant.   En conclusion, allez y en petit groupe et ne prenez pas le Dosa de 6 pieds. Tout sur le menu est extrêmement bon et avec des prix raisonnables."}
{"text":"Proper authentic South Indian cuisine. CHICKEN KOTHU !!! - must try. Was good to hear a lot of ppl conversing in tamil. Loved the sambar. I got the rava dosa, medu vada."}
{"text":"Amazing South Indian style food. So many kinds of dosa. We got samosa chaat for an appetizer (my personal favourite) and for main course: palak paneer and mushroom/spiced potato dosa. Both were amazing! We had a fantastic waiter, fantastic food and pretty quick service. Best to make a reservation but we got lucky and we're seated quickly."}
{"text":"Wow South Asian cusine served at its best. I am really not a great judge when it comes to this type of south asian cusine when it comes to food but Thanjai was just really good. All these dosas were a great combination of taste and flavours. I tried their cheese dosa, and just wow soft and tender cheesiness just blew me away. As a bengali myself who doesnt have much real exposure to south asian food this was a nice intro to this side of indian cuisine. Its impossible for me to go to an \"indian\" restaurant north south east west or whatever and not order lamb biryani so when I had their version I was happy with the mild spicy(requested) take and curry flavored rice. I will however never understand the point of why they put a boiled egg on top of the biryani as I am used to having boiled egg curry or korma as a side. Nevertheless its a different cuisine and I am a boiled egg lover so Im not gonna cuss over eggs on side or on the meal or wherever as the meal itself was really yummy. You can really see the passion coming through the staff and the people who are running it over their service, food, and ambiance. Loved how they kept a replica of the famous temple on the entrance and the orange walls and nice traditional vibe. Will return again...and again :)"}
{"text":"I have been here twice. First time I had mango lassi, dosa, and a curry shared with my friend. Second time I had buttermilk and the lunch only big set of dishes. You won't go wrong if you want to try these.  The masala tea is kind of like a hong kong milk tea to my Chinese taste but with a hint of spice. The waitress told me that ginger. I think it's a very old ginger which gives you a subtle spicy taste. That's a nice Indian style. I like it.  I like the spices they use in the dishes. Dosa is so unique and worth trying."}
{"text":"Quite tasty -- I went out of my way on a trip up to the airport to stop in here.  It was a bit of a trip to find it as it was a bit off the main routes (albeit still on a busy street) but worth the detour.  The appetizer I had (samosa) was good though a bit too high on the pastry versus filling (and I was a bit disappointed they didn't have Chicken 65 available though listed on the menu).  The dosa more than made up for it however -- wonderful filing, the sambar and chutney were excellent, and all very tasty.  I always think the mark of a good dosa place is how well they do an onion rava masala dosa and this one was one of the better ones I've had -- crispy yet not oily, spicy without being overwhelming, and nice ratio of dosa to filling."}
{"text":"The great thing about Thanjai is that everything is delicious! I got to sample food I never heard about and wouldn't find at just any traditional Indian restaurant. It's a small place that gets full quick,  reservations strongly recommended.  I tried the onion bhaji as an appetizer, these are like onion rings but less greasy and with a finer crisp, served with tamarind sauce. Everyone comes here for the dosas: thin crepes stuffed with delicious savory potatoes, cheese, tomato and whatever else you like. They are paired with perfect dipping sauces and are easy to eat. I also tried prawn curry and biryani which were very flavorful but there's no kidding around with the spices, despite asking for it \"mild\", my mouth was on fire. The only drawback was concerning the prices and portions - for 14$ the curry seems expensive and there were very few shrimps, it's not served with any rice or naan either.  Worth a taste, stick with the basics, like dosas and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Everything was good. The ghee roast and cauliflower Manchurian were really good. I have been here long back once before two years and did not like it. Never returned back. However this time it was good!!!"}
{"text":"Bon bon bon! kya aap french bolte hain?   Le service exceptionnellement bon. Tout le monde est super fin, super beau. Le tout est excellent! Vraiment. Les portions sont un peu petites, mais le goût est vraiment superbe. Si vous n'êtes pas trop connaissant, allez-y et discutez avec votre serveur/seuse. Ça sera leur plaisir de vous conseiller.   Aussi! Goûtez les thali le midi ou encore les crêpes minces immenses!   Allez-y pis vite! À genre 250 mètres du métro Plamondon... vite!"}
{"text":"Tasty dosas. Those are the star. I had one with cheese and spiced potato and it was bangarang. Lamb curry was good, but not as eye watering spicy as I would have liked. Basmati was a bit of a rip at 4 bucks. All in a tasty option"}
{"text":"Great menu, very versatile and different from generic Indian restaurants. They're dosa, khotturoti, manchurian and noodles are a great option. Service is friendly as well.. Be sure to make reservations on the busier nights cause they are usually packed"}
{"text":"Where do I start... First off, I'm not an indian food connoisseur so what I'm saying here might not reflect its authenticity, but from my experience, the food here lacks in flavour. We had lamb curry, chicken curry, and chicken biryani. All three contained a vast array of flavours, but they still tasted... rather bland (for indian food). Chand palace, in comparison, serve stronger tasting food.   About the dosa, everyone liked it, but I found it average: 1. A bit too salty 2. Very oily on one side.  Otherwise it was crispy, but my impression of the dosa was similar to eating rice crackers or chips.  Pricewise, it is more expensive than the indian restaurants on Jean Talon West.  And as usual, I felt bloated after the meal.  Probably won't come back."}
{"text":"Thanjai is pretty unique in Montreal since it serves South Indian food. And according to a Bengali friend, it's really authentic.  We visited the restaurant with a group of about 15 people. The service was not quite up to that: dishes got mixed up, one person waited for an hour just to get a glass, and in the end it took about 45 min to split the common bill. Overall the service did not leave a very professional impression.  The food was interesting, but a bit hit and miss. The dosas were great, but the Biryani and some of the deserts were eaten with considerably less enthusiasm. Since the restaurant specializes on dosa, I would recommend to stick with what is best!"}
{"text":"A real change from the standard Indian restaurants. Order dosas and try different varieties. The service is friendly and helpful. A great place to go with a group. We ordered a variety of appetizers and everything was delicious."}
{"text":"We are visiting from NY and was looking for a good Indian restaurant for dinner. Saw some great reviews on Yelp and decided to try it. Plenty of street parking (it was a Sunday so not sure if that makes a difference). The place has many tables and is very clean. We ordered the lentil soup, masala vada (lentil doughnuts ) for our appetizers. They were both fantastic!! My husband had the chili chicken boneless with tomato rice and I had the Paneer Masala Dosa. It was my first time having dosa and it was fabulous!!! This is a gem of a restaurant and if you are looking for great Indian food try this! They also have a 6 foot Dosa that will feed 6-10 people. So bring some friends!!!"}
{"text":"When it comes to Indian food this place is always my fisrt choice. They offer a very complete menu. The dosa are amazing ! The byriani is to die for. Everything I've tried there was really good. They have a good variety of vegetarian choices as well. The serivce is friendly and quick; you might not get it in French but they are really trying their best. It's an BYOW, that's a nice plus. The prices are really decent for teh huge portion you get. The decor and lightening are not the best but it's really not a big deal.  Might just not be the place for a first date:)"}
{"text":"I love food! Particularly good with a punch. This place delivers bold flavours that will satisfy the not avid food lover out there! Everything we ordered was delicious. Hubby and I shared the Thanjai special soup, an platter with an assortment of appetizers, shrimp biryani, lamb dosa and chili chicken. We usually ask for our food order to be spicier then their usual but decided to follow their \"heat\" chart. Thank goodness we did lol! Good thing we made reservations because the place was full and people kept on coming in. Very good eats at a very affordable price. Also BYOB!!! Service was excellent even though we received one of our main dish before our soup and appetizer. I mentioned it to the waitress and she was very nice and apologized. It happens and it didn't ruin our evening. I can't wait to come back with a bigger group so I can try the 6' long dosa :)"}
{"text":"While I love a good French crêpe (and who doesn't?) dosas just ignite some mystical dormant savoury crêpe love in me. If you haven't had the pleasure of trying South Indian cuisine (if you've had unspecified Indian food your whole life, you likely haven't tried South Indian) I couldn't urge you more to start the culinary adventure here. It really feels like they have everything on that giant menu. If you're like me and can't choose one dosa among the 50+ on the menu, ask for a recommendation; you won't be steered wrong.  Additionally, the service is among the warmest I know- I have yet to have anything short of a fantastic and gregarious reception when I eat here. The prices are definitely a tad more than your standard Indian, particularly within the neighbourhood, but it's absolutely worth it."}
