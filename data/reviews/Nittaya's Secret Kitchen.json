{"text":"My go-to place to take friends. The spinach salad is fabulous. The curries are super tasty. The Thai basil chicken is defaulted to hot, so make sure to give a rating on the spice level. The lava shrimp are a must have. They renovated and expanded a few months ago. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Food is good. Authentic Thai food, freshly cooked as you order them. I love their spinach salad. The place is a little small and cramped, so you might as well make a reservation if you're going in a group. Price is reasonable as the food are freshly prepared."}
{"text":"Upscale Thai with a unique menu and super cute Summerlin dining room... I realy wanted to like this place!  I notice some of the positive reviews say Nittaya's is hit or miss, but I can't bring myself to go back.  Servers here are awkward high school boys who forgot numerous parts of our order and brought things out in incorrect order (one of our apps came after we had finished entrees, drink never came, etc.), way strange for an upscale restaurant in this part of town.  Makes no sense.  Fried \"famous\" spinach salad lacked any kind of heat or flavor.  The coconut soup was boring and one note, again no flavor.  Nothing wowed us, and we tried a good assortment.  With SO many fab Thai restaurants in this city (ie. Lotus of Siam where they have an expansive menu of authentic and super memorable dishes), this should be last on anyone's list.  I'm guessing they cater to people with timid palates who want a quiet and cute atmosphere for date night and food comes secondary.  I cannot imagine a lover of Thai food coming here more than once."}
{"text":"Really 3.5, this place is super cute and cozy. Perfect for a date night, but keep in mind it's very small. Decent wine selection. The food had more of an Americanized Thai flavor, but still good. The Thai tea was waaaayy too sweet. I would stay away. They have great lunch specials. Service was ok, not great but not bad."}
{"text":"Everything we ordered was outstanding. The service was great as well. I'm not from Vegas but this restaurant will be on my list of favorites when I return."}
{"text":"5 Stars for sure!

The First Rule of Nittaya's Secret Kitchen
is you DO NOT talk about Nittaya's Secret Kitchen!
(Except to tell awesome people who love amazing food.
Always tell other awesome people.)

I heard it through the grapevine that this place was amazing, and oh-WOW-uh!
I knew before my meal was over that I would become a regular 
& will attempt to try everything on the menu, eventually.

Extremely intimate & cozy (for now), so become one of the initiated
before the word gets out and the expansion starts.

I'll say no more (for now)."}
{"text":"One of the best tai restaurants I have ever eatten in.  Warm decor, great staff.  The food is amasing each time I go.  I am hooked on the coconut soup.  The spinage salad is fabulous and if you like pad tai, their's can't be beat.  It is a little expensive but quality food always cost a little more.  I love it!  Can't wait to go back and try the curry."}
{"text":"Love! It's small and intimate and the food is delicious. This is not one of the noisy \"hip\" places with overpriced crap on the menu. This is a place for food lovers. The decor is very nice as well. 

Everything we tried so far is excellent. But there is one thing that's to die for: the creme brûlée trio!! Chocolate, coconut and lemongrass. You may not think these sound so great but they are all absolutely delicious. Mmmmmmmmmmm!!!!"}
{"text":"Another Thai favorite to my list. This is a hidden gem. Great tasting food and drink menu"}
{"text":"This little gem of a restaurant has won me over after only 2 visits. Most Thai places I've visited feel too cold, too sterile, too kitschy. Nittaya is a comfortable space that feels elegant without feeling stuffy.

The food is the true star. Nittay's Secret Kitchen serves \"Thai Tapas\". I was skeptical that this was just another marketing term for \"not enough food\". I was pleasantly surprised. Generously portioned, beautiful and tasty creations graced my table. The World Famous Spinach salad is a revelation. Deep fried Avocado with panko crumbs and two sauces will make you swoon. 

I plan on eating my way through the menu :)"}
{"text":"The fried spinach is heaven! I thought I've had good fried spinach before, but not even close.. Hands down, a must-try! Service was great as well, I wish I remembered his name but he was the bartender as well. Awesome guy with random useful facts!"}
{"text":"Husband and I stopped in on a Saturday night without reservations around 6pm and were seated without issues, which was nice because we seemed to just beat the rush that happened at 6:30 to 7:00pm. The waitress was very kind and patient in explaining the dishes. It didn't seem to have come from some rehearsed dialog, as she genuinely cared about the food and service. We chose the chicken pad thai and tapas called Golden Pouches. The pad thai was most definitely the best version of the dish that I have had in town and was a spitting image of my memory of my Thai friends' family's home-cooked pad thai. The chicken was tender and the flavors were amazing! Earthy, fresh, noodle texture was perfect and not rubbery... We ate the whole thing and when we go back again, we would easily order that dish a second time. The golden pouches are potato and curry seasoning wrapped in egg dough that is fried. They are made to look like little pouches, and they are so good, crisp, hot, and spiced! Reminded me of Christmas... Those were off the tapas menu, and were big enough to be satisfying. 

The ambience was very nice, subtle decor, music from Massive Attack playing in the background... Did not have a chance to try any wines, but the selection was very decent given the size of the establishment. The bar section looked very inviting. Overall cozy feel and welcoming. Would certainly go back again to try more dishes, if only for the kindness of the staff, not to mention the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Fantastic place!

Small, intimate dining, with a nice bar.

Incredible food, with complex intertwined flavors and world class presentation. 

The service was quick, but un-rushed. Very attentive.  No bum's rush with the check when we were finished.

Simply the best Thai food in the Las Vegas valley"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! The food is amazing, service is perfect and the atmosphere and presentation make you feel like you are at a 5-star restaurant but their amazing lunch combo is only $12! They have different infused water available each day, like mint cucumber, and it's always so yummy and refreshing. They just hit every single detail here and I could eat their drunken noodles every day!"}
{"text":"Food was very tasty. We started with the tempura battered spinach that was served with a side of wonderful citrusy dressing. Delicious and a must have. I ordered the massaman curry, which was outstanding. They list it as a spicy dish, however I don't think that is was spicy at all. The flavor was amazing though, didn't miss the heat at all. My husband had a salad with beef, the name escapes me, that was good. 
The water is infused with strawberry and I want to say rose. Loved it. 
I wish the restaurant was a little more child friendly. My little one needs to be able to sit up in a highchair, which are not offered."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Wonderful, attentive staff. I tried the pad Thai and drunken noodles, both were spectacular."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant and have been there three times now. The first two times were really pleasant and we had a great experience. So I should certainly rate this with five stars. 

But last valentines day I reached the restaurant and had very poor service. Not only was the service too slow ( which can be expected on a busy night) but the food was extremely spicy. When we told the staff about our experience they started arguing. It's only when I said fine, we can't eat this just get the check and I'll leave did the staff agree to \"add some coconut milk\" to make it palatable. Not a fun place to be on a romantic night. And that's why it gets 3 stars."}
{"text":"We went with a big group, and although this restaurant is quite small, they accommodated us well!  We started out with a bunch of tapas...the best one was the spinach salad with tempura spinach (so unique!) that came with a chicken lime dressing.  The tempura was not overly greasy and paired well with the dressing.  The fried avocado was also very good, creamy on the inside and perfectly crunchy on the outside.  For our entrees, the green curry with chicken and penang curry shrimp were my favorites.  The flavors were excellent, and there was some definite spice to the dishes.  The chicken pad thai and pad Z-U were standard.  

The restaurant itself is very pretty inside, with low-lighting for a more romantic atmosphere.  Definitely give this place a try for a more upscale Thai restaurant!"}
{"text":"The fried avocados and spinach salad are amazing. The service is wonderful as well. I need to come back and try out more of the menu. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This has to be the best Thai restaurant I have ever enjoyed. We ordered the crab rolls that came with a nice sweet sauce, eggplant panang, koi-soi (with pork shoulder), and lemon grass soup. We loved all of it! Service was friendly and ambience was warm. The strawberry infused water was a good touch. I look forward to trying some wine on my next visit. All around 5 stars."}
{"text":"Took our dinner 50 min. To come . Lousy service. Will not come back.  Ask for Hot sauce, took 10 min, fish sauce, another 10 min. My husband was livid. Green curry was lousy. Padtai  noodles ok. They are really short of hands. Bad experience."}
{"text":"This place is exceptional. It's a small bistro setting and the food is excellent.  Customer service was first class.

Small portion size but gourmet presentation, and incredible flavors.

The night we went the house special was Ahi Pokey, OMG, delicious!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and I must always order the spinach salad... so so good! who doesn't like friend spinach with a yummy cashew sauce?  I tried the fried avocados, not as amazing, the curries are delish! The restaurant is small and doesn't have a lot of tables so if you go on a Friday/Saturday be prepared to wait... but its so worth it!"}
{"text":"Food this good should never be a secret. Me and my wife had date night with a couple of friends. As we walked up to the venue we noticed that a considerable amount of people were already neatly tucked into their out door bistro style seating. We went in and immediately to our left was this kickback bar with a wall decorated with various wines. To the right was table and semi booth seating. The ambience was great! It was a mix between a hip dive bar and chic and exclusive eatery. This is a very cool place to take a date. The menu has plenty to choose from. We tried the corn fritters which were yummy, super delicious chicken lettuce wraps, green curry, avocado steak, volcano shrimp that was soo good I can still taste it and I  special requested a coconut curry chicken. To my delight, my curry was served in a roasted coconut bowl with sweet coconut lining the inside of the shell. I love love love loved it! The servers were attentive and accommodating. I'm looking forward to returning. If you love tai food or are looking for a great first time experience you should totally go here. It has an upbeat atmosphere that's great if you don't mind crowds."}
{"text":"If you like Thai food, or if you're the kind of person that likes to try new delicious things, this place is amazing. A member of our party ordered the tempura spinach leaves for the table, which were great. I had the coconut soup to start with, played it safe with the chicken pad thai, then had the coconut creme brûlée for dessert. Everything was absolutely wonderful and I can't wait to go back and try the Thai Donuts!"}
{"text":"I kind of wish there was a half-star rating, since Nittaya's falls between 3 and 4 stars for me. I rounded up based on the expectation that my next experience will be even better. 
We went to Nittaya's for dinner last night and it was quite busy. We hadn't thought to make a reservation (our fault) but there wasn't a long wait, which was nice. The dining space is tiny, but elegantly decorated and comfortable. You get quite friendly with your neighbors, which is good if you are social, or if you just want to look at their food. They do have some outdoor seating, which looked pleasant, and we'll definitely try next time. 
On being sat, we were offered a fruit infused water. I thought it was very nice, subtle, and something a little different. 
Before I go any further, I have to admit that I am NOT a Thai food expert. I have actually actively avoided Thai food for years because I couldn't handle spice. I only recently began developing any spice tolerance and  I was hoping a \"fusion\" place like Nittaya's would help ease me into a heretofore unexplored cuisine. I was definitely not disappointed on that count.
My husband ordered the fried avocado as an appetizer. Unfortunately, it took a REALLY long time to come out of the kitchen. We kept watching food for the table behind us whiz past while we could only stare longingly at it. Finally however, it did come out and oh, it was worth the wait! The avocado was a brilliant green, with just enough coating to give it a delicious crunch without being oily. The sauce that came with it was bright and flavorful and just a little spicy, perfectly cutting through the creaminess of the avocado.
For entrees my husband ordered the duck curry and I ordered the tofu curry, and here is where we came to another service problem. My curry came to the table roughly ten minutes before my husband's ever made it out of the kitchen. The waitress was extremely apologetic and offered us comped desserts to make up for it. Again, the food was totally worth the wait. The tofu was nicely seared (which many places don't bother to do) and the sauce, although a bit on the sweet side, was very delicious. My husband thoroughly enjoyed his duck curry, saying the duck was very moist, tender, and perfectly cooked. I tried one of the cherry tomatoes from his dish and though it was a little spicier than mine it wasn't overwhelming.
Then it was dessert. I chose the Thai Donuts, while my husband got the fried banana rolls. Both came out piping hot and absolutely delicious. The only complaint I would make about the donuts is that I would have liked a ramekin of some kind of sauce to dip them into. 
The waitress apologized again, and assured us that the kitchen normally runs much smoother. We told her we appreciated her candor, and that we would definitely be back. And we will!"}
{"text":"The food and wine are so good. Everything is reasonably priced for quality that tastes like it should cost way more. The intimate atmosphere is perfect for a date or small celebration. My husband is not a huge fan of Thai food but the menu is varied so it doesn't matter. I usually get a curry with tofu and it's always delicious, the tofu is expertly cooked. The appetizers have been good as well and they do have a small bar so it's also a good place for drinks and apps."}
{"text":"Must try their world famous Spanish salad, it's probably not what you expect.  Thai tapas are usually what I try.  Love most of them, some even \"just like mama makes it\".  

I've tried curry which they ask between 1-5 and we had a 5 (which my friend asked for a thai 5 not a white guy's 5, since he's had some places skimp thinking he can't handle it) and it wasn't that spicy at all.  Although he did get the Duck Curry, which too spicy might overpower the dish.  So it's understandable.  My other friend got a 3 tofu curry.  TO DIE FOR!  I loved it and I am normally not a curry fan.  Although eatting a whole dish by myself I don't know (that's just not my dish nothing against the food)

I prefer Pad Thai.  They have tofu and chicken, but we asked for Duck.  They made it for us.  It was heaven! I would ask them to make it again!  

They also have wine there...and are pretty knowledgeable and will let you try some of the wine if you were interested in trying it.  ((We spent more in wine than our dishes...we had 7 people and our bill ended up being 150 for food and 170 for wine))  I say with that many people, it was a good deal :)"}
{"text":"This is an update from my 3 Star review back in September of 2016.  First the food.  Like I wrote last year, the food at Nittaya's Secret Kitchen is exceptional.  When I wrote the review last year I was so upset about the service I really wanted to give the review a 1 star, but because of the food gave it 3 Stars.  Since September 2016 I have been back to Nittaya's six times and all six times the Staff has been really good, no GREAT!.  First they seem to remember us now.  Second, the indifference we used to experience when we walked in is gone.  Third, the Waitresses and Waiters seem to really care about providing good service along with the exceptional food.  The staff has improved remarkably and they truly seem to care about what they are doing and making sure their customers are completely satisfied.  This is a great restaurant and the staff have become professionals in their craft.  I highly recommend Nittaya's and want to thank everyone from the Bartender to the Waitresses, to the Waiters and most of all to Nittaya for running one of the best restaurants in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"We've eaten at just about every Thai place in Las Vegas.  Nittaya's is probably the best. Exceptional quality. Unique menu and flavors.  I've yet to find a menu item I dislike. Nice setting as well.  People always talk about Lotus of Siam, but this place is much better and more interesting in my opinion."}
{"text":"I love the food at this Thai restaurant. One of my favorite dishes is the coconut Seafood Curry. It is served in a coconut with Jasmine rice on the side so many different types of seafood in side the coconut with wonderful Curry coconut sauce delicious. I always love going back there to see what's new and on the menu so many wonderful things to try."}
{"text":"I found myself in Nittaya's the other day after asking Siri for Thai nearby me.  I have lived in this area for almost 8 years, and I am embarrassed to say I have never stopped by.  I stopped in and placed an order for take out, but was immediately taken back by the very intimate and sophisticated interior decor.  I know Thai, and this was much more White Orchid. Very classy, very inmate.  

For sure, there were still classic Thai accouterments adoring the walls, but it was not overdone.  I really wish I could rate the wine bar, because it looked above-average, and who doesn't want to rate a wine bar? 

I can rate two things: a few of the dishes and the service I received. 

I ordered Curry in Young Coconut, Basil Beef, and Tofu Pad Thai (always have to try the Pad).  The Basil Beef was excellent (similar preparation to Mint Beef), sweet and savory.  The Pad Thai was also excellent.  Not overdone, not too sauced, and the waitress asked if the included egg was OK - as a Tofu dish, I could see how egg may put some people off and this was a nice touch.   

The Curry Coconut?  Oh my.  It was the perfect dish. Amazing curry spice sauce, mussels, clams, scallops, and whitefish all roasted inside a coconut.  My son hasn't stopped talking about it for two days.  This is a definite must-do.

The service was very polite and professional and did not lack.  

I can't wait to go back after finding this gem for a proper sit-in dinner.  Maybe I will get  to review the wine bar, too.  For the sake of review only, of course.

I'm holding off on 5 (or 3) stars until I get a full sit-in experience."}
{"text":"Awesomeeee food, pineapple fried rice is the best ive had. All their plates r wonderful and great service. Id rather spend 50 $ here than anywhere else n know that the food is always perfect. Keep up the amazing cuisine chef! Aloha"}
{"text":"Wonderful food and exceptional service. The spinach salad is a must have! Love the cozy ambiance."}
{"text":"We truly enjoyed this restaurant. We went in giving the Chef carte blanche with our dinner with the only requirement being that we are gluten free. He made a wonderful Salmon Eggplant green curry and lettuce wraps for appetizer. I enjoyed the ambiance. It was pretty quiet, but it was a Monday at 5pm, so I'm guessing it gets busier. Not Good for Kids at all....so don't bring them!"}
{"text":"I had a pad Thai craving and headed out for this place. I had a perfect meal with a tasty wine and sat solo at the end of the bar with my kindle, enjoying every bite.  At first, it seemed a bit pricey, $17-$18 for pad Thai (usually around $10-$15), but then I got the dish and damn, it was worth every cent...I would gladly pay that, even more, again.  The bartender/server was super helpful with wine (offering to let me try before making a selection) and food recommendations.  I'll be back to try the infamous spinach \"salad\" for sure."}
{"text":"The food is delicious, presented in beautifully decorated dishes by Executive Chef Nittaya. They have an amazingly rich wine selection from wineries around the world. The employees are very friendly, providing quick, but excellent service. You will feel cozy in the restaurant's ambience with all wooden walls, tables and wine teamed decorations. This is a must - try place. Once you visit it for a first time, you will love Nittaya's Secret Kitchen."}
{"text":"Attentive and friendly staff. Josh, behind the bar, was my server.  Food is beyond expectation. I started with the coconut soap that was a surprise of perfect pieces of chicken. Then had Massaman chicken that is very good, stick to your ribs and filling. Ended with Thai Donuts that I thought I would not be able to eat them all but had no problem empting the plate. Small space for the well to do locals without busting the wallet. I will go back for more."}
{"text":"The food was tasty, however, the small portion size does not warrant the oversized price. $18 for a tiny portion of crab fried rice ......ridiculous!  There was so much sauce in our chicken dish but just a tiny portion of chicken, again, $18.  They have to lower their prices."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I always drive by this Thai place always saying how we wanted to try it, well we finally did! 
The restaurant is very cozy with a rustic feel to it.
We went afternoonish so it wasn't busy at all, two other couples, so it was very quiet. Service we pretty quick with seating us and taking our orders, but again it was a quiet afternoon. 
We ordered 3 tapas dishes and 2 main dishes and it was way more than we had expected for just the two of us, but the more the merrier right?!
We started with the shrimp jalepeno poppers, crispy pork, and the stuffed chicken wings. 
For our entree we ordered the home style shrimp pad Thai and the drunken noodles.
I love when Thai dishes have a good kick to it, but was a little disappointed when I didn't get just that. The shrimp jalepeno poppers had maybe the littlest kick to them.
I also ordered my drunken noodles with spice and was more overwhelmed with the amount of basil in it. To be fair the menu description clearly lists the main ingredients as egg, chicken, and BASIL.
All in all, I really did like the restaurant and the food as a whole and would definitely come back! Maybe just ask for a bit more spice next time :)"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been coming here for a couple years now, so I can't believe I haven't given a review yet! Honestly, Nittaya's is the best Thai food either of us have ever had. 

Nittaya's is definitely an elevated and more stylistic type of Thai: seriously tasty and satisfying dishes with a modern tapas flare. Deep and unique flavors in every dish and sauce. Even if you are the type that only gets a common dish like pad thai (like I used to...), you will love it, but I recommend branching out if you come here. The quality and taste equal that of the presentation, which you can tell by the pictures!"}
{"text":"Food was VERY spicy... usually they will identify what is spicy or not.  Expensive for what you get.  $14 for Fried Rice on lunch menu.  Had ordered a dish and then decided to cancel before dish was served.  Owner insisted I pay for the dish even thou I had not received it yet.  Overall nothing special for the price.   If you don't like Very Spicy Thai, make sure you are careful what you order."}
{"text":"We had driven by this restaurant many times but never saw many cars and were hesitant to go in for dinner.  On a recent Thursday night we arrived there a little early,  which was a good thing since its a small restaurant with few tables that really fills up.  Our waiter was very helpful with the complex menu.  Her recommendations which included the fried spinach didn't disappoint,  the food was great.  The prices good, and the portions ample.  The atmosphere was also lovely, so unexpected from the outside.   We will defiantly make this a neighborhood regular"}
{"text":"So earlier, I had a higher review of this restaurant (only 3 starts) but after a whole fiasco of incorrect credit card charges unfolded after my visit, I must give this place a much lower rating.

I went with my friend, and we wanted to split the bill down the middle, which is easy enough, but they double charged her and then were very rude about the whole thing, refusing to refund the money. 

This was to top of an already mediocre to poor evening of service.  I am so embarrassed to have invited my friend here for what was supposed to be a fun girls' night out."}
{"text":"Such a great place! Small, cozy, and intimate atmosphere. Food is superb! Every dish is so creative and unique from other restaurants. Try the spinach salad or volcano shrimp. They are delicious!"}
{"text":"Fine dining Thai in Summerlin! It's a pretty small place but that just makes it so intimate..Everything I had was delish! Tamarind shrimp, lettuce wraps, and drunken noodle. We went on a Monday night and it was a full house. I suggest making reservations. It's a perfect spot for a low key date night!"}
{"text":"Love this place - the food, the ambiance, the SERVICE and the food again! Just perfect. Ask for Devynn if you go! She's fantastic. 

This is an upscale place where you can either dress a little nicer for a great date night or a little more casual."}
{"text":"If you can stand the taste of avocado even only somewhat then get the Avocado Curry, it. is. a. mazing! I got the Avocado with steak (med-rare) curry and it was amazing. The other food is also really good and it's cheaper than what I expected such a fancy looking restaurant to be although I wouldn't say it's cheap either but it's worth it. Since I go with family and friends and we always taste each other's food I can honestly say that I have yet to taste a dish that I don't like. Service is good, they infuse strawberries with the water though so if you have an allergy to it TELL THEM. Overall though it was really good."}
{"text":"Probably the only Thai place in Summerlin that I know.
 I don't know maybe. I'm not an expert or something. But the food was decent for a Thai place. If you want real good Thai place  look up noodle house and pin kaow pretty good places."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite date night restaurants!  They have great food, wine, and ambience.  We love the coconut seafood curry and the coconut shrimp.  We will definitely miss this place when we move from Vegas!"}
{"text":"very small place. The food was outstanding. i will be going back. my wife and i loved this place everything we had tasted awesome"}
{"text":"Omg Becky!  I am in love with this spot!  Everything on the menu is fabulous!!  Cannot eat here without ordering the World Famous Spinach Salad, Cilantro Steak Skewers & Fried Avocado!!!!  Those 3 are a MUST!!!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely, hands down the best Thai food. I enjoyed every bite of it. Great service!"}
{"text":"I came here on my 40th birthday with my husband and friends. Very nice and intimate place to eat.  I had the Salmon which was tasty and delicious.  Everything we ordered on the menu was amazing! The pad thai, calamari, satay, pineapple fried rice and curry chicken was all delicious! They also have a wide variety of wine.  The mango sticky rice with coconut ice cream was a great finish to our meal. I would definitely recommend this to my friends and family!"}
{"text":"Best Thai in town! The staff is phenomenal- especially the bartender. She always remembers us and has great recommendations. The food is amazing and never disappoints! Love Love Love!!!!"}
{"text":"Have eaten here three more times since the initial review and the quality of the food has notably declined.  

Today one in the party ordered Pad Z-U beef.  I thought it curious that there was some wadded up plastic wrap under the rim of the plate, and removed it.  It seems that dish was refrigerated and re-heated (possibly in the microwave given the plastic wrap's texture).  It didn't look good, and our companion, having had the Pad Z-U two other times here was very disappointed.  It was served lukewarm too.  

The other two dishes:
-eggplant with basil sauce and added tofu was fine, though tastier on prior visits

-eggplant with peanut sauce ordered mild, but came more medium-hot, but good

-an order of brown rice was a bit undercooked and about 1/4 of the quantity of the dish of white rice, not quite enough for one person  

-waiter was distracted and a bit grumpy and was the same way last time too

The place wasn't very busy at lunch and perhaps the declining food quality and service is to blame, especially when their prices are in the higher category.  Quite a disappointment."}
{"text":"What a secret!  I can't help but tell everyone about Nittaya's.  A very small, cozy space that is stylish yet casual.  Each dish is carefully thought out and executed beautifully.  The dishes are layered with flavor and it is worth making many visits to get through the menu.  Tapas & Thai, two of my favorite things done very well!"}
{"text":"The Secret Kitchen is all about secret family recipes from Thailand. The restaurant offers Asian cuisine served tapa's style and a regular Thai menu. The restaurant serves beer and wine. The service is outstanding an very attentive. The desert menu is delightful. Try the old style rice pudding. This is one of the BEST Thai restaurants in the Las Vegas area. I know I am hooked. They do have carry out service. The restaurant is small, clean and very romantic. I suggest you make a reservation on the weekend. Absolutely marvelous!"}
{"text":"This is the mother
\"The hair that I gave your server was in the food that was served to me. I pulled it out of my mouth. The hair was grey, not blonde! I then placed it on the tablecloth next to me to give to your server. We did not expect you to comp the entire meal. We did expect you not to try and charge us for the dish with the hair in it. Not only did you charge for the dish, you offered us a free dessert and yes, we ordered two. So what did you do? You gave us the cheaper one for $7.00 and charged us for the dish that cost $12.00. The right thing to do would have have been for you, the chef/owner to come out, apologize and make it right. We have enjoyed our other meals at your restaurant and have recommended it to our friends. This kind of experience leaves a really bad impression and does not excite us to come back or recommend you. With such a small venue, it seems to me that you would want your customers be leave happy. As an aside, my dish was shrimp with baby bok choy as was my daughters. Both dishes came with broccoli (substitute) , with no discussion or notice from the server! Sincerely, the mother who had the grey hair in her mouth.\""}
{"text":"Great ambience and atmosphere. Small cozy restaurant with great decor. Very welcoming service staff. I was introduced to this restaurant by a good friend of mine who is Thai herself... and when she says the food is delicious, it it must be good!  We went for lunch, (it was a total of five of us) for a birthday celebration. Even though we made reservations, it was nice to go when we didn't feel rushed by a dinner crowd and the food came out very quickly.  I will definitely be back! Worth a try, I would highly recommend coming."}
{"text":"The Spinach salad is actually more kinda like Spinach \"nachos\" -- spinach dipped in tempura so they're like crunchy chips that you can dip in a delicious sauce. The tofu Pad Thai and Beef Pad See Ew were also good. The prawn tapas was a little dry / not recommended."}
{"text":"Love this place!  The spinach tempura salad is one of the best appetizers I've eaten in years.   The interior is small but cozy and would be perfect if you are on a date or meeting with friends.  It's not pretentious but it does however have a sophisticated atmosphere.  I would rate Nittaya's right up there with Archi's Thai or Pin Kow."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service! Very nice ambience. We had the secret potstickers, tempura spinach salad, shrimp curry, pork green bean curry, and the bread pudding and everything was delicious. So glad we finally tried this place, will definitely be frequenting!"}
{"text":"My friends and I decided to have dinner at Nittaya's  as we wanted to try a restaurant we had never been to before and Nittaya's menu of Thai inspired tapas was intriguing.

Nittaya's is a small, nicely appointed restaurant on the corner of Rampart and Lake Mead.  The restaurant has a long bar with comfortable looking leather stools and just eleven tables set with little oil burning candles, white table clothes and fresh flowers. When we arrived on a Monday night, at 5:00 pm, we were the  first guests to be seated, but by the time we left two hours later, the place was nearly full.

Service was wonderful.  Our severs were friendly, knowledgeable of the menu items, prompt, and unobtrusive.  Our server even asked if we'd like to sample the wine we decided on before we committed to order it.

Nittaya's has two menus, one for traditional choices of appetizers, salads and entrees, and a tapas menu featuring a vast selection of Thai inspired little dishes. The restaurant also serves a decent selection of wine and beer. My friends and I decided to order several dishes from the Tapas menu and share them.  

We ordered the \"World Famous Spinach  Salad\", bbq ribs with five spice, curry potato puffs,  mango shrimp, beef jerky, pork egg rolls, and crab wontons.  The true winner in all of those selections was the spinach salad which wasn't really a salad.  It was tempura fried spinach leaves served with a tangy sauce that contained cashews and chicken.  It was absolutely delicious and I highly recommend anyone who dines at Nittaya's to try it.  The beef jerky was also good and not like traditional tough dry slices of beef.  The jerky was tender, tangy marinated pieces of  beef with a good amount of heat.  I enjoyed this dish very much, but one of my dining companions thought it had a little too much heat.  The mango shrimp were ok.  They were small size, shelled shrimp wrapped in bacon and served with a creamy mango sauce.  They were good, but would have been better if the shrimp were bigger and the bacon a little less overpowering.  The crab wontons and egg rolls were good but did not stand apart from those sold at chain take-out restaurants.  Two of the dishes we had were disappointing, with the ribs having a nice flavor, but being so tough they required a knife to eat, and even then took a little work to get the meat off the bone, and the curry potato puffs (curry flavored mashed potatoes, shaped into little semi circles, battered and deep fried), being so sweet they bordered on being candy.

For dessert we tried the Thai donuts and coconut ice cream.  Both were heavenly.  The donuts were little fried rounds of fluffy light and incredibly delicious dough that was not overly sweet, and were served with a caramel sauce which added  just enough sweetness to make them one of the most delicious donuts I've ever eaten.  I would love it if Nittaya's sold these exceptional little bites by the bag full with a generous dusting of powdered sugar as I would.buy them daily.  The coconut ice cream was served in a pretty little covered pewter bowl.  The  texture was  somewhere between an ice cream and a sorbet, and was so delicious and bursting with coconut flavor that I wished I could have bought a quart to take home.

The price for dinner for the three of us, which included several rounds of wine and beer, was $130.  

Overall, I liked Nittayas and will return to try other dishes on the menu and to have those incredible donuts and coconut ice cream again."}
{"text":"The interior of this restaurant is very elegant, but the furniture is too big for the small space. All tables are way too close to the others, leaving little room for some privacy. Altough the decor might be called intimate, it appeared a little to dark for my taste, with black table linen. Service was excellent though and restrooms were immaculaty clean.
The food was tasty, but not extraordinary. Avocado rolls were delicious, but so are those at other places (Cheesecake factory, BJ's in Henderson). The spinach salad was fried, but that was our mistake as we did not check. Komol serves a similar dish that is just as good. Drunken noodles (flat noodles with ground chicken and veggies), was great, although Dangee Thai on Pecos makes them better. 
Overall a very enjoyable lunch but the Eastside of town has just as many enjoyable places. Komol is great, but StickErice is still my favorite Thai!


Update: I received a nice email back from the owner, explaining some of the dishes I tried and I really appreciated the effort. It showed they really care about their food and their customers. Maybe a second try might be worth it when I am in Summerlin."}
{"text":"This is the most romantic Thai food spot we have found in Vegas.  Were making this a monthly location. :-)"}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Vegas!  In my opinion way way way way way better than Lotus of Siam, puts them to shame actually.  Satay, Tao, and Lemongrass is also very good, but I like this one the  best, not sure how it was rated 10th and Lotus was #1, other than the god awful press in this town barging about it.  Honestly if you have not tried this place, give them a try, great food, good prices, however it is very small and sometimes hard to get a seat inside."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the tapas. We ordered the fried spinach, fried avocado, steamed mussels, bacon-wrapped mango shrimp, and chicken with peanut sauce. The first two dishes were novel and served with excellent dipping sauces. The mussels were fresh and maybe just a tad over cooked, but still pretty good and without that stale salty taste.  The shrimp and chicken were also delicious.  The one aspect I would recommend is to order the food a little at a time because it came to us quickly, but it was a Tuesday night.  I can't wait to go back-and I've lived in NYC and travel abroad (including Paris) and so I recognize a good thing when I taste it!"}
{"text":"Delish! My boyfriend and I tried 10 tapas, including 2 desserts. Here are the outstanding:
Spinach salad: OMG. Must try. Fried spinach with cilantro lime dressing, diced chicken, and cashews. Our favorite.
Secret stickers: delicious pot stickers with house dipping sauce. These are hard to explain but amazing
Golden pouches: potato purée, sweet golden curry, deep fried crispy pouch. Must try.
Mango sticky rice: fresh mango slices, sticky rice in a sweet coconut cream. To die for.
Mussels: steamed mussels in coconut broth with lemongrass sauce on side. Must try! 

Still good, but not favorites
Crab wanton: needed more crab and maybe a little bit of green onion.. Still delicious
Esaan sausage: little sausages, good flavor but not the best
Naked shrimp: shrimp in a Thai sauce, a little too fishy
Sweet corn fritters: our least favorite, needed more corn. Mostly ground pork with corn here n there deep fried. 
Thai donuts: large order! 5 donuts per order. Still very good but could have used another sweet component. 

Service is amazing.. Best I've gotten in a really long time."}
{"text":"Excellent cuisine with a friendly staff and owner.  The dessert menu is aptly titled \"Happy Endings\".  For a Thai restaurant, its utterly hilarious!"}
{"text":"Wow!  I'm in town for business and I wanted something different. I love Thai food and thought I would try Nittaya's Secret Kitchen.  The service was amazing and the food was even better!  I asked the server, James, to just \"feed me\" whatever he recommends. James brought me a tapas plate of deep fried pork belly with a sweet chili sauce for a starter. The pork belly was cooked just right and the sauce was spicy hot but I couldn't get enough of it. For my entree I was served curry steak with avocado. The curry sauce was fantastic!  I refrained from licking my plate but I managed to clean the plate using the steak, eggplant, and rice. 
Great recommendations James!  I can't wait to visit again. Yummy!"}
{"text":"I was thoroughly impressed! Great service. Superb food. Ambiance was great. We had the chicken curry (hot), this was super tasty. Perfect sized serving. The spinach was TO DIE FOR, the sauce was just the cherry on top. I will be back, for sure."}
{"text":"Amazing! We must've tried 8 tapas and a red curry, all were delicious.  I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I liked this place, but it is TINY as in you have to literally squeeze by the table next to you, to sit down. The Thai food was more Thai fusion, the presentation was beautiful the prices a little high. Is it the most authentic place I have eaten? no. But it is a nice place for date night (don't let the price point fool you). The food was good, but I cant get over how cramped the tables. I think in reality it deserves a 3.5 rating."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere. Our server was delightful. We only had tapas on this occasion and found that Four items were plenty for the two of us. Each one was tasty and well presented. We will be back."}
{"text":"Oh yeah gurl, you want to go to there. 
*Calamari Lemongrass Salad
*Spicy Green Bean Pork
*Crying Tiger Steak
*Spicy Catfish
*Green Curry
*Eggplant with Thai Basil
*Fried Banana

I didnt eat all of that myself. I went with 3 other people and my 13 year old daughter. 2 of the guys own a world famous restaurant and they were super impressed as well. We brought a bottle of our own wine and they allowed us to do that and we were glad to pay the nominal corkage fee. We even ordered a bottle(or two? ) from their better than average wine list. 
The wait staff was amazing. My daughter kept saying, \"Hey Josh, could you bring us some lettuce bowls for the pork? Can you bring me some shishito peppers?\" He catered to her like the foodie queen that she is. That in itself was impressive. Most waiters approach teenagers with a bit of awkward disdain, glancing at the mother before they feel the child's food request is valid.. Josh was amazing.  
They are willing to accomadate almost any request to the best of their ability. Helpful, not hovering. It really is a secret, special place."}
{"text":"First me start by saying this place is definitely a 5 star restaurant. The only reason I removed a star was due to the limited menu but I assure you everything on the menu deserves 5 stars. The spinach salad seems to be everyone's favorite and with good reason. I had the pad see ew, fried rice, and spicy basil chicken. This place seems to only use the freshest ingredients and the customer service was excellent. It is indeed a bit pricey but that should be expected from a place that serves only the freshest produce on its menu. The atmosphere was intriguing with the mood lighting being very dim. The comfort was tight but not crowded. I will definitely be returning back because they certainly know how to treat their customers unlike some of the other local businesses in town that I posted negative reviews for. 

Make sure you check those reviews out and stay far away from them!"}
{"text":"came here for valentines day. had a lovely evening. the restaurant itself is very small, cosy and intimate. perfect for a romantic meal. the service was good and the food was really nice. I had the basil beef and it was very tasty. portions arent too big, nor too small,just right. recommended."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. I've been there 4 times now (every weekend) since I found this place. Very authentic Thai food and the staff is great. I would recommend you make a reservation because the restaurant is a bit small."}
{"text":"What a great find for lunch and luckily we got there before noon because it filled up fast. We sat at the bar and received great service. As first timers we wanted to try several dishes knowing we could take home what we couldn't eat. We tried the dumplings (great) and satay (excellent) and then I had spicey pork noodles while wife had the bbq ribs. Mine was good but hers was Outstanding. We had one of the coldest Sapporo beers ever. A perfect match.
We'll go back. :)"}
{"text":"I notified the waitress that I had a severe allergy and inquired if they could accommodate it and she said \"yes\" and would let me know what dishes I could eat. Long story short, she was very busy between other tables and seating tables so I had to ask other servers passing by about the dishes to ensure they did not contain shellfish.

Somewhere along the line there had been some cross contamination as I had an allergic reaction. When I later called to speak w a manager about my frustration with the poor communication and/or execution of handling food allergies, they apologized and said there's nothing they could do but would like to offer me a free desert. 

I understand not all restaurants are able to accommodate allergies and that's not the problem as long as that expectation is set in the beginning."}
{"text":"Great hidden spot.  They have an excellent happy hour also. The mussels are absolutely delicious.  Pretty great wine selection also"}
{"text":"I almost don't want to say how great our dining experience was for fear I will never get a reservation . It's small and a little hard to find but for those who persevere they will be rewarded with great food, great service and flavored that will bring you back time and time again."}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is top notch and the food is delicious!! Totally random, but one of my favorite things to do here is to eat the orchids that garnish the plate. First off. This restaurant taught me that orchids are even edible. But secondly I was shocked to find they actually taste really good.

More generally though, the food here is all top notch. Flavored well. Delicate and rich flavors. Good ambiance. Everything is top notch."}
{"text":"Food is great; tastes fresh and authentic.  The curry is amazing.  The service is great too.  The average price per dinner is about $21."}
{"text":"We have started to add this restaurant in to our rotation.  Most nights there are tables available but if you are with a big crowd I would suggest calling.  The food is very good.  Our favorite dishes are the spicy catfish (we get it not too spicy and it still has a kick to it), grilled salmon avocado curry (this dish is to die for and I will steal this idea of crispy grilled salmon in a green curry sauce with avocado on top and try to make it at home),  crab fried rice.  We have gone with friends who have enjoyed the pineapple rice, fried avocado, chicken satay.  I have not gone on thursday nights but they have all their bottles of wine at half price.  The restaurant is small but I like the decor and the wait staff is good.  Definitely a good addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Great service, excellent happy hour, very nice selection of wines, and an extremely unique and inventive menu. Try the Riesling and mango shrimp."}
{"text":"Fabulous first experience! 

Wine is quite pricey. 

Tofu lettuce cups are yum!

Service is friendly and fast.

MUST TRY: \"World Famous\" spinach salad --- tempura spinach?!  YESSSSS!

Love this place. I will be back! I will be bringing friends!"}
{"text":"I eat there all the time food is very good ... this time I decided to order to pick up .. got home the food looks horrible, dressing to the salad is definitely reused looks like a threw up . I called them and the manager was so rude and hung up on me .... I would never recommend this place to anyone that"}
{"text":"This is hands down, our favorite local restaurant--not just for Thai food, but in general. The food is great, consistent, and the menu selection is awesome. They recently remodeled to be larger, which was a must because they used to get really cramped. It's still tight but the decor is adorable and cozy.

Menu faves: beef jerky and crab rangoons (both from the tapas), and Massaman curry."}
{"text":"We did not eat here so I can't rate based on food, just our experience. We stopped by on a Saturday evening unaware that reservations were needed. The hostess, while not super friendly was willing to accommodate us if we promised her we could be done in an hour. I was happy they would accommodate. Unfortunately, I have a one year old and there are no high chairs in the establishment. They clearly don't want families dining there with younger children which I found extremely disappointing. We might give it another shot for just the adults, but the experience left a bad taste in my mouth. It's also as incredibly small restaurant, on a busy night like we were there, you feel very crowded. Definitely not a romantic atmosphere when you can't enjoy a private conversation."}
{"text":"Cozy, Relaxing & Intimate Spot, Perfect Place To Enjoy A Glass Of Vino! 

PROS
Fried Spinach Salad With Chili Lime Dressing - YUM!  Also, the ahi tuna appetizer was delish. 

CONS
Drunkin' Noodles - Most disgusting thing I've ever tasted. Has a licorice flavor, I couldn't even finish a single bite.  

Overall, this place is great if you just avoid the drunkin noodles."}
{"text":"Delicious mango desert. Enjoyed lunch with frie nds. Staff is extremely friendly. Great selection of wine."}
{"text":"This charming restaurant has a nice ambiance and serves tasty meals. We were drawn to it, because it uses organic products.  After a day of hiking, we decided to give it a try.  Upon entering the restaurant, we felt our clothing was a bit too casual since most existing customers were dressed in business casual attire.  Nonetheless, we were greeted and received above average service. We did not have a reservation; however, due to the size of the restaurant, I would recommend making one.  The shrimp pad Thai was phenomenal!  It was the best I've ever eaten.  My husband raved about the eggplant curry, and our friend thought the basil chicken and crab fried rice were awesome.  The only reason I can't rate the restaurant as five stars is I asked the waitress to omit the egg in the shrimp pad Thai, but the meal was served with egg. Outside of that, the restaurant has great ambiance, clean restrooms and delicious food.  We have found out new favorite Thai restaurant in Vegas.  We WILL eat there again and again and again."}
{"text":"I love everything about this place. From the edamame appetizer to the different dishes that make my mouth water. I can't wait to go back!!! My sister found this place and when she visits we go every time."}
{"text":"Everything was so good. The pad Thai, bbq ribs, spinach salad (best spinach I've ever had in my life), and the pork & vegetable egg rolls were all delicious. We showed up at 9:30pm, which is 30 minutes before closing, so I can understand why the service wasn't the best. The staff was still very friendly, though."}
{"text":"Honestly one of the worst food experiences I have had! Ate here when it first opened and was not impressed, sub par Thai tapas. After many people telling me I have to give it a second chance, I did. Worse than the first. Yes the spinach salad was good, but you can fry a sock and it would be tasty. Got the seafood madness and that is exactly what it was. The frozen shrimp tasted like mussel and the mussel tastes like shit! The restaurant should spend less money on flower garnish and more on fresh ingredients. And that was only my meal my husbands was pretty bad too."}
{"text":"Unfortunately my family and I didn't get a chance to try the food. So I can only speak on the service we received from a hostess over the phone. We called to make reservations the hostess initially said no problem but after she found out we were bringing our 1yo daughter she then said that the wait would be really long and that they didn't have high chairs for children!!! (I guess they discriminate on children)Then quickly got off the phone. I will never eat at this place. If you have a family save your money and go to DW bistro where the food and service is always top notch!!!!"}
{"text":"I went here to celebrate a friend's birthday. Didn't really know what to expect except I heard that it was fabulous. Believe me. It lived up to the hype. Absolutely delicious. Fried spinach and corn fritters are a must. Shrimp Pad Thai was one of the best I've ever had. The drunken chicken was outstanding. Highly recommend. Btw. We had reservations. It's a small (adorable) place so I'd suggest making them before hand."}
{"text":"We've eaten here several times as it is in our neighborhood. However, they have a strange way of turning away business. Every single time we've gone, no matter what the time, we are asked if we have reservations. We do not. We then get a very confused look and told that they are booked - when the place is empty!! I actually laughed one time & they sat us & we enjoyed a full dinner with only two other tables being sat the entire time we were there. Not going back."}
{"text":"This place is hands down one of the best spots in town. Visit Josh at the bar, he's the man.  #baconwrapedshrimp #catfish #springrolls"}
{"text":"Wow! This is not a Thai restaurant, it's a Thai palace! I am originally from Vancouver BC, and this is the first time I have experienced authentic, delicious Thai food since I left that city!! And on top of it- it's a wine bar!! I was in heaven! My husband and I ordered the fried spinach which came with a spicy/fish sauce dip (delicious). It was an unexpected treat, so tasty!! Warning- it's enough for four people, so it was a big dish for the two of us! We also had a dried rib appetizer, which was very good. The big surprise was their curried avocado salmon. OMG!! Out of this world! The ambience was super cozy, clean and beautiful décor... right down to the fresh exotic flower popping out of wine crates. Very friendly, knowledgeable service. The menu was very extensive, and good wines by the glass. So excited to find this gem! Can't wait to go back, and we will be back a lot!! I LOVE Las Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"AMAZING! When traveling you search for the accommodating bar with interested people and delicious food. You found it! This is the best thai food in Vegas"}
{"text":"The food was outstanding - perfect really. Had never been here before and so glad we came. And the portions were very larger -- we took a lot home."}
{"text":"Ate here a few weeks ago for my gf's birthday. Food was amazing. Service was great. Will definitely coming again."}
{"text":"I enjoy this restaurant and am glad that they expanded. Be Forewarned that the website is not updated and they are CLOSED on Sundays."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised....you must try the \"World Famous Spinach Salad\" no other Thai restaurant has this!  I've eaten Thai food in the best city(San Francisco) and the food at Nittaya's is really that good! Try the Spicy Basil Tofu or the Seafood Curry prepared in a real coconut (my partner had this one)

Don't just take my word for it...go there you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Best Thai restaurant we have ever been to! Went three nights in a row. Tried half the menu and loved it all! 

Must have Starters: coconut soup, spinach salad, crispy pork belly, secret stickers, 

Entrees: the grilled skirt steak avocado, Pad Z-U noodles (incredible), Panang chicken curry. Wow! 

(Special mention to the wonderful servers. So thoughtful and helpful. 5-star service too. 

Prices are excellent. You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"This place is really hit or miss.  

My friends and I were invited by John's uncle.  And he even told us this place was really hit or miss.  

And we ordered a lot of different tapas.  I mean, it's a tapas place.  You've got a large group of people.  So of course you're going to order a lot of different dishes.

So we got the fried tofu, the fried avocado, the summerlin rolls (chicken), the fire cracker prawns, the steamed mussels, the famous spinach salad and some salmon dish that I don't see on the menu now.  What was interesting.  The spinach salad was really interesting.  It's like tempura spinach with a dipping sauce on the side.  Really unique taste.  And I've never had crunchy potato-chip like spinach.  So it's pretty fun to eat.  The mussels weren't bad.  The sauce it was cooked in was a little bland but the mussels were perfectly cooked.  Fried tofu is good.  But I love fried tofu.  But then again, the fired tofu's not amazing.  The fried avocado is different.  Not bad.  Never had fried avocado so if you like avocado-I definitely recommend it.  The salmon dish was possibly the best thing we had.  Excellent.  Made me wonder if ordering tapas might have been the wrong way to go.  So what was terrible?  The summerlin rolls.  Garbarge.  The fire cracker prawns, almost tasteless.  Pricey.  Worth it?  Meh.  Food wasn't bad but I wouldn't go back.  Too many misses and not enough hits."}
{"text":"This is one of the best kept secrets in Las Vegas.  The spinach salad is unique as it is fried in tempura batter and served with a cashew dipping sauce that will knock your socks off!  Im going back here!"}
{"text":"Cute little spot! Rustic winery feel. Very friendly wait staff that checked on us frequently.  We shared a few plates so we can try a variety and we all thought the boat noodle was a little too salty. But the red curry was delicious! Also the sauce for the spinach chips and the raw shrimp was very flavorful. Would definitely return and recommend!"}
{"text":"I research asian restaurant by Rampart and Lake Mead in the internet because its close to where I live and I'm craving for Asian food and Nittayas Thai Restaurant pop up and read good reviews from yelp. I went tonight and when I came in, the restaurant is full and the place is so small....I wish it is bigger....So I end up sitting in the bar...While looking at the menu, they only have list for wines, liquor and beers for drinks..I order Home Style Shrimp Pad Thai, it tastes okey and this place is expensive...Definitely not coming back....Archis Thai taste better :)"}
{"text":"My mom was overly jovial when we left the restaurant and this is a rare sight to see. The service was quaint, cute and on-point.  The food also delicious of course. Attention to detail, cleanliness and relaxed atmosphere.... I would undoubtedly recommend"}
{"text":"Our favorite hidden local gem! We love the bar service and date nights at Nittaya's. You know this place is good because I once called for a reservation and Nittaya herself answered the phone! Thanks for the delicious food and wine pairings!"}
{"text":"Great food, excellent Service  ... LOVE it So much, specially I like avocado salmon curry , it's really wonderful, and for the appetizer I would recommend spinach salad or beaconed shrimps"}
{"text":"This quaint place has the perfect small RESTURANT atmosphere
Food was excellent too"}
{"text":"This is absolutely hands down the best Thai place in Las Vegas. If you know Vegas you'll know that means something. While the location is in Summerlin and a bit of a drive from the Strip, I promise that it is totally worth the drive.

The decor is chic, contemporary and service impeccable. I come for both lunch and dinner and it's always extraordinary. My favorite things to devour here is a long list but take note you'll want to try every thing.

So here it goes:  Coconut soup, citrus steak salad, papaya salad, shrimp pad Thai, crying tiger steak, drunken noodles, cashew shrimp, catfish, eggplant, FOB rice, the beignets, Thai donuts and creme brûlée. I'm sure I missed a ton of other things but trust me when I tell you, you will be back.

LOVE THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"Best Thai I ever had , lamb chops delicious, crispy spinach brilliant , service excellent, will be back"}
{"text":"Everything  I read about the place was true, small, intimate,  beautiful artwork, just fun.
The food all was so delicious except the sa uce that went withe Ribeye too salty.  Other than that Awesome I will go again & again till I have tried everything!
Thank you for a great time guys!"}
{"text":"This is a restaurant I wish I could keep Secret!  VERY GOOD food! Small, quant and a di-lish neighborhood dining establishment. Always take out of towers here! A+"}
{"text":"Worst customer service experience ever!!
My sister and i went to have lunch here, everything was good, server was good. But one of the lunch specials tasted off, the chicken tasted almost not fully cooked. We told the server, and he acted weird about it. We didn't have time to wait for anything else, and had a two year old. 
And not to mention, he offered us to have dessert like in replacement for the meal. During us explaining to him our issue... He was never sympathetic or tried to say sorry about what had happen.. I'm sorry but if chicken doesn't have a right texture I won't eat it nor will I give it to my 2 year old son. So I sent it back.. Never was asked to remake it... Nothing was said ... Just if we wanted anything else or the dessert.. I get the bill & I'm still being charged for the whole meal... So I walk in there to ask why I'm still being charged for something I didn't touch and he tells me that \"there is no return policy\" \"it was still made\" \"the chef tasted it and said its fine\" so I walk out feeling very frustrated.... & my sister goes in from the patio to talk to a manager.. She was so rude!!! She said she would not take it off the bill what so ever and that the chef tasted it and it's fine... & if we want they can box it up for us ! WHAT? After your chef tasted our food and I just told you the chicken wasn't right! We will never come back ever again! I had this dish before here and I know this one wasn't right. And the server should think about how he handles his customer problems and maybe find a different job because now it's hurting him. So here's your warning... If it doesn't come out right, they simply don't care...."}
{"text":"Greatest sliced poke tuna lunch salad I have ever had before. Luckily my friend Ernie took me there after he tool me what criminals health plan of Nevada and united Healthcare was and had me enjoy one of the best lunches of the year. Kudos to nattayas and thanks."}
{"text":"Very good Thai food. Slightly differs from a traditional Thai menu but in a delightful way. After hearing about this place for years, I finally tried the secret Thai kitchen and was not disappointed. Our waitress recommended the \"favorites\" fried spinach salad and secret dumplings as starters. We tried both, I would not get the spinach salad again. Each piece of spinach is deep-fried although the lime vinaigrette is tasty this was extremely heavy and not my thing. The dumplings were OK but I probably would try something different next time as well. However we did order the chicken lettuce wraps and they were so flavorful and fresh definite must for next time. For Main's we got the Panang chicken curry and the rain forest  rice both were knockouts! The curry was light and flavorful slightly spicy and creamy. We will be returning here again!"}
{"text":"This is my FAVORITE Thai restaurant. If you are looking for some amazing Tapas and Wine, this is the place to be. Highly recommend their worlds best spinach salad, served with an awesome sauce with chicken and cashews (can be substituted with tofu for the veggie lovers) Some great veggie tapas choices are golden pouches and curry puffs. My husband loves their Phuket poppers, with shrimp jalapeños and cream cheese. The main course has all the traditional Thai curries, very good portions. I ordered spicy basil tofu and it was excellent. 
Every Thursday they do half price wine by the bottle. They have a select menu to choose from and has a really good selection of wines. You can get a nice bottle of Chardonnay (original price $36 for $18!!) it's a steal. 
The service is always awesome. For extra heat I request their Thai chilies which the staff is happy to serve."}
{"text":"You must try Nattaya's, and give your usual restaurant hautes a break.  This is for the guys, if you want to impress your wife, first date or someone really special, take them to Nattaya's.  

You'll feel you're at an exclusive establishment, and only you and a few friends were invited.  The food is amazing, so work your way through the menu as I have on three visits.  The staff is very professional and polite.

It is what dining should be, relaxed, inviting and not forced.   You will lose track of time there, best dining experience I've had in years."}
{"text":"Spinach salad is a must try. That alone should make anyone a \"return customer\". But give the menu a shot."}
{"text":"Loved this place so much- great local little hideaway with great food, excellent presentation and great service. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Im not sure if they're thinking or can afford to upgrade to second or larger location but typically when I review a good place, their business booms and they go crazy with fortune

This secret is mine.  Can't tell you about it.  Shhhhhh 

It's just a really nice Thai restaurant

{"text":"Nittaya's is a great neighborhood Thai restaurant that's cozy with delicious food! My friend and I went for her birthday and ordered alllll the food bc we are hungry little monsters. We got the fried spinach thingy, calamari, emerald fried rice, and pad see ew. BETWEEN 2 PEOPLE. I know, girls can throw it down. 

The deep fried spinach thing as interesting but delicious. It's literally deep fried spinach. They deep fry each leaf. EACH LEAF. How long does that take? Sheesh. Anyways anything deep fried is delicious so this is an A+ in my book. Would I eat it every day? Probably not, my family has a history or heart disease and diabetes. Would I get it maybe 1x every 2 months? Hell yes. 

Calamari also deep fried. So can't go wrong. Pad see ew, is the same as every other Thai place. Can't go wrong ordering this either. Out of everything, I probably wouldn't order the emerald fried rice again. I mean it was good, but it just kinda seemed like green curry with rice but without the saucy part. Does that make sense? Like why would I order this when I can just order the green curry, is what I'm saying. 

Anyhow, other than the waiters constantly trying to take our food away, it was a delight like always!"}
{"text":"Food: Food was wonderful, the curry we tried was the green curry Avocado with Rib eye steak, and the  tapas has a different  take on thai food. The crispy spinach was good, the dip made a huge difference  on the dish. The calamare and the ribs that we got from the tapas were savory.

Ambiance: The decor and how the place is arranged in a way that creates a cozy dining experience. The restrooms are very clean. Definitely do a reservation before dining at nittaya's. They have a bar which is good for get togethers after work, and also has al fresco dining. 

Service: Service is pretty good, the waitress was very knowledgable in the foods that are popular in the menu. If you like thai food, definitely try this place out. It is Nittaya's Secret Kitchen after all."}
{"text":"Super cute place. Have lived in this neighborhood my whole life and wish I found it sooner. Very intimate. Would love to come back and do a date night on Thursday when wine bottles are half off. Kinda pricey other than that no complaints. Had the drunken noodles soo good!"}
{"text":"This was such a tasty place, with really nice ambience. The massaman curry was fantastic, the best I've ever had. We also tried the Thai donuts with rum caramel sauce and homemade coconut ice cream. Both delicious:)"}
{"text":"If you just walk in, you wouldn't know this is a Thai restaurant.  You would think a wine bar with it's decor.  We walked in and there wasn't anyone to greet us, though we entered during an off hour.  There was one table that had guests waiting for their food.  

We had the crab fried rice, chunks of crab meat all over, not salty at all and full of flavor.  It wasn't dry either which was a bonus.

The pad thai was not the variety with ketchup or very little ketchup so it was very welcomed.  I don't tend to like ones that are on the sweeter end, I prefer this one which is browner on for the noodles.  Very enjoyable.

Asked for water, it's infused so bonus!"}
{"text":"Excellent....the garlic edamame was fantastic.  Kale salad was a first and I loved it. Everything was so fresh and cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"The food honestly looked extremely promising and my friends and I were so excited to come and dine in for our first times. Judging by the other reviews and word of mouth from friends and family, the food is absolutely amazing. Unfortunately after being seated and told by the server that he would be right back, we never encountered  another colleague again. 

Maybe it was because we chose to be seated outside but several other guests who were seated outside well after us received their waters and menus immediately whereas we only received the menus from the hostess who sat us. Our server was nowhere to be found and when he eventually came out, he proceeded to provide service to another couple that had just sat down. 

It is a shame that we were not able to taste the food, but the lack of attention and bad service quality were too much to bear for us. After 15 minutes of waiting and even as we walked out of the restaurant, not one service person batted an eye. 

I am sure this restaurant will continue to be successful but I don't feel inclined to return if this is the type of treatment that even only a small percentage of guests will receive."}
{"text":"First look, it's a nice cute cozy little place. Feel nothing like your regular Thai restaurant. More relax. Staff are really nice, informative. 

We ordered fried Spinach tempura salad. The sauce that comes with it makes it awesome and balancing the tempura taste. 

We dined for two. So we ordered \"Crying Tiger\"-ribeye charbroiled then sliced up with this Thai amazing sauce. Also Thai Basil Chicken, this is a Thai style, uses ground chicken. Portions are generous. If you like to try something new, order the garlic rice to go with your entree!"}
{"text":"I can make this really easy: if you like P.F. Chang's, you'll like this place. It's good food, don't get me wrong, but it's not stand-out. The place is really small and we had to eat at the bar, no biggie, but it filled up quickly and we were lucky to have gotten seats. Make reservations if you want to try it out!

My fiancé seemed to enjoy this place much more than me, and she holds it in a higher regard than P.F. Chang's for sure. 

I ordered my meal 5/5 spicy, and extra spicy if he could do it. To me, not spicy at all. My lady took one taste and started coughing and downing water. Sooo...depending on your tolerance level.

I ordered the Panang Curry with chicken instead of shrimp, flavor was pretty good. I also got the spicy chicken fried rice. Also tasted pretty good. But like I said, it was just P.F. Chang's quality, nothing special. 

Definitely lost a star for being as expensive as it was given the food quality, but it'd be a solid 4 if the food came up a bit or the price went down."}
{"text":"By far one of the best food experiences I have had in a long time.  The food was spectacular!"}
{"text":"I had the fried avocado, steak skewers, chicken satay skewers, a shrimp tapas, pork pot stickers and shishito peppers. Everything was delicious, but I could have done without the pot stickers since they were nothing special, but they were well-made if you like them.

I came in here thinking it was just a good Thai place to stop by for a quick lunch, but was surprised to see that it was more of a classy establishment. I considered leaving due to time, but I'm glad that I stayed and will come back again to try the rest of the tapas menu and the entrees. 

Yummy!"}
{"text":"While staying in Summerlin over the summer on our last night in town we discovered Nittaya Secret Kitchen Thai restaurant. What a fabulous find. This is the best Thai that I have had in a long time. We had the Coconut Seafood curry and the Drunken Noodles with chicken. Both excellent. It's a really nice restaurant, the service was terrific and the waiters were great. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Just love this place. Consistently excellent food. We had the spinach salad the drunken noodles and the Penang shrimp. All delicious. Best Thai in town"}
{"text":"We eat here on a regular basis.  The food is ALWAYS outstanding.  The service is ALWAYS outstanding.  The wine is great as is the ambiance.  These are all the reasons why we are regulars. Some highlights:  the tempura spinach salad is a must!  The green curry salmon or steak is amazing and not something you'll find anywhere. Glass noodle salad is great.  All the rice dishes are very good. Lamb chops are to die for!  Basil chicken is another great dish. Too many to list. The only disappointment is that Nittaya does not come out of the kitchen. We've been coming here for years and we don't know her. Otherwise amazing place. Need a reservation in advance, especially on a Thursday, Friday or Saturday."}
{"text":"One of the best experience I had with all the restaurants I have ever been in Las Vegas.

Tempura Spinach Salad was the so good, when you eat them, you want to order another.

The best item of the night was the dessert, home made coconut ice cream, the dessert was served in a whole young coconut shell, warm sticky rice inside of the coconut, home made ice cream on top to melt into the rice. The creaminess of the ice cream and the chewiness of the rice was the perfect mixture of texture and feelings  The ice cream was also the most expensive item of the night. But I think it was totally worth it."}
{"text":"My friends and I decided to try this place out tonight. I thought it must be bigger at first when we arrived, because the parking lot was 2/3rds full. So while we're waiting for our 3rd, we step inside and see a podium that isn't being manned. The place looked cramped, and they had a table everywhere trying to maximize the space. So I looked around real quick, there's no one ready to step up to the podium. Someone is performing bus boy duties 3 feet away from us at a table, but he can't even look up to us. So, turning around to see the bar tender, she makes eye contact and then wanders down to the farthest point of the bar, away from the door. The two of us stood there for close to 5 minutes, and actually turned around to leave when we were boxed in by 2 more customers coming in the door. Now the podium is right in front of the door, and there's a table in-between the bar and the wall, so there is no where to go. 4 people at the front, and the area is so small, we can't even shut the door. 
Finally, the bus boy walks into the back, and our waitress/hostess finally comes up and asks who was first. My friend and I took her attention and asked to sit outside while we wait for our 3rd to show. A table we wanted outside was unmanned when we arrived, but had yet to be cleared off. She said it'd be 3 or 4 minutes for them to clear, and so offered to step out to wait. After those 4 minutes, she brought us a menu to look at, but the table still wasn't cleared. (I really hope they had half the crew call in or something, because she was all over the place.) After dropping off the menu, the waitress/host steps back inside; finally coming out a few minutes later to clear the table herself as the guy who was performing bus boy duties before is now nowhere to be seen. So she tells us the table is ready, and we take a seat. 
Our 3rd person shows up right after the waitress brings us water, and then we waited. And waited. About 15 minutes have gone by, we've all looked at the menu 3 times, and she finally comes back and asks if we wanted drinks. So, not to miss out again, we place our drink and meal orders all at once. And then it seemed like ground hog's day, because we waited some more. And more. Almost 10 minutes later, the other 2 with me get their meals, which was surprisingly quick for meal prep considering how slow everything else had been. About a minute after that, the bus boy finally makes another appearance by trying to give our 3 beverages to the couple sitting next to us (who are almost done already, mind you). And then we waited some more. I still haven't gotten my food. My friends and I have been talking for about 5 minutes now, and I still don't have my food. I finally tell them to start without me, and then after nearly another 5 minutes, my meal finally arrived. 
Now, I have to say, the meal was awesome. The dish presentation was on point, and the food tasted better than it looked. But for the 3 of us there that night, only one of us got rice with our meals, even though the menu showed all of them coming with it. And once you start eating hot, you burn through your drinks, so they couldn't get refilled fast enough. Our latecomer to dinner mentioned her curry was much hotter than the menu suggested, and mine was as well (luckily, I prefer hotter.) We ended up being there for over an hour and a half, and once we finally got our rice, we had to get up from the table to ask for drink refills after about half an hour had passed without an employee in sight. 
We finally got to see our waitress come by again at closing, and she asked if we wanted any deserts. We declined and just asked for our check, and then we saw her right back. Not surprisingly, they're making a mad dash now to close the place down. We had our bills inside of two minutes, and before she can turn around, we put our cards in and handed them right back. The bus boy decided it was time to make another appearance, and he starts clearing off the cushions from all the outside furniture while we're waiting for the cards to be processed. We chatted for another minute or two after signing our receipts, and you can see he's getting impatient for us to go so they can clear the table and snatch off the tablecloth. I quietly suggested to our friends we should go, and before we can step off the sidewalk to the parking lot, the table is cleared of all remnants and he's back inside the door. 
All in all, the food was amazing. But as I hopped back into my jeep for the short drive home, I was relieved I came here with friends inside of bringing a date. I can't say it's a place I'll ever go back to unless they decided to move to a bigger location and hire some more staff to help."}
{"text":"I do love this place, the flavor, the service, the interior decorations except it's really salty and on greasy side for me.   I am assuming most restaurants are like this unless I request other wise.  But the reason for the 3 star is because this is also not authentic enough.  The dishes are on sweeter side."}
{"text":"The restaurant is rather small and constricted in space for the tables but we managed to squeeze in one of those side tables but another customers chairback was right up against mine.
The menu resembled a clipboard with a number of papers attached. Half the menu was dedicated to the food and half  dedicated to wines.
our interests were focused on the Chinese dishes advertised and those were presented as tapas rather than like dim sum which in a Chinese restaurant they would've been.
We ended up having three tapas plates and one entrée dish. Each of the Tapas plates were tasty and imaginative. The entrée was a smartly presented dish of fried rice with pineapple chicken onions and cashew nuts.
I think the key to the Tapas dishes is to make sure you have the proper sauces to accompany it with. In most cases, the default sauce worked well but I would recommend asking them for whatever other kinds of sauces you happen to prefer like a soy sauce or a hot sauce.
The entrée dish was a pineapple fried rice with chicken onions and cashew nuts. The dish was presented in a pineapple half shell which allowed you to take it home and eat the remaining Fried rice and cut some additional pineapple from the edge. My wife loved it.
in closing, I would recommend coming early because it appears to be a very popular nighttime get together place. It's a little pricey with each of the Topos dishes being about $10 each and the entrées between 11 and $18. I will be coming again!"}
{"text":"Ask for Dante Marcy, he's an adult blonde male. He will service you so good and hard you'll be begging for more. We once toured the Italian countryside together sharing wines and cheeses as we sunned ourselves along Tuscan country roads. But what is sweet in life is fleeting and impermanent. Such Is life. He soon grew tired of me in favor of his lover Pablo and I was cast aside like day old scones in Vatican City. Heartbroken as I am I would still request him by name to wait on me and fondle my taste buds into a world of ecstasy so rapturous and sinful even the most hedonic among us would blush. Tip him generously, but as you do whisper the name Juan Pablo."}
{"text":"It's for me, the best thai restaurant I've been to here in Las Vegas. So many thai restaurants in town but this one is so good. Very cute and cozy,  more expensive than the other thai places in town but who cares when the food is delicious?....I don't care to pay more if the food is worth it.
My boyfriend and I got the fried rice which was absolutely wonderful, very tasty and not greasy! and also the shrimp curry and their awesome pad thai......They served water infused with fruit which was uhm uhm uhm...This is like a gourmet thai restaurant so don't expect big portions. I looove this place!"}
{"text":"Loved the beef jerky and the Spinach salad!  Great lunch specials too."}
{"text":"The reviews don't lie! I came here for lunch with friends and we shared the following:
-crab fried rice (not my favorite among the dishes, we didn't even finish half of it)
-drunken noodles chicken (yumm!)
-chili basil chicken (the best!)
appetizers were spare ribs (waiter suggested this but there was barely any meat and I just didn't like it) and the fried tempura spinach (who would ever think this could be so good!)
-homemade coconut ice cream-wonderful
-lemongrass creme brûlée-could barely taste the lemongrass and it was too thick
 Service was great. The inside is very dark and I highly suggest not sitting by the door like we did. I was blinded by light every 3 minutes and someone entered and exited."}
{"text":"I unexpectedly found this place on yelp, I didn't know what to expect but I was optimistic. As I entered it was a quaint and cozy place. The staff was very accommodating and friendly. I ordered the tempora style spinach, ( not sure of the name) but it was absolutely amazing, crisp and delicious the sauce was to die for. I also ordered the basil rice and the Mah Thai rice which was also delicious. It's seldom I give anyplace top billing, but if you like great service, delicious food at a reasonable price... this is your place. Bon appetite!!!!"}
{"text":"Expensive but really good! Go there for happy hour so you can experience their cuisine without breaking your wallet. Spinach salad is an absolute must."}
{"text":"Spectacular Thai food. It definitely beats the hell out of Lotus of Siam. And the wine selection is superb too, specifically the Pinot Grigio by the glass. The Panang Shrimp dish was super. Ordered it at five, which is their spiciest level, and Nittaya certainly delivered. The chicken satay was excellent too. Great Thai food in Summerlin is always fantastic to find.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Upscale Thai food 

I must admit that this place appeals to me from the outside alone. It's a great way to set the mood and prepare you for what's about to take place inside. 

The decor is beautiful and I'm the type of person who really appreciates the little details like fresh flowers at each table and complimentary infused water.

The food is fantastic, packed with bold flavors. I'm a big fan of the sweet & sour coconut soup, pineapple fried rice served in an actual pineapple and the famous spinach salad! I could drink the dipping sauce straight for the salad! I also appreciate that every dish is so beautifully prepared. 

Prices are higher here and of course you could get cheaper Thai food but no other Thai place looks like this one. It's about the overall experience here and it's a great one."}
{"text":"Awesome dishes and consistent everytime!  Service is impeccable plus the restaurant is decorated tastefully!!  Make sure to make reservations for dinner on weekends."}
{"text":"This is a good Thai restaurant. Prices are on the high side.  They serve  dinner only and are not open late. The menu is limited."}
{"text":"Nice, small, cozy place. Has dinning room seating as well as a bar. Food is fantastic with good portions as well as good service."}
{"text":"Went out of their way to set up outside seating for us since we had our puppy with us. The food was on point. You pay for what you get. The servings were large, spice level was perfect, and everything tasted fresh. Servers were incredibly friendly. We would definitely come back."}
{"text":"We ordered a few apps and the drunken noodles. All were so yummy. Perfect amount of spice! Service was great and the atmosphere is so cute and quaint. I'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"As usual the best or nothing, first time at lunch and what a great deal. Had the green curry chicken salad and appetizer $11 I'm happy!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, great wine list, exceptionally priced and nice ambiance.  The portions are nicely sized, ingredients are fresh and the variety of choices is not overwhelming but enough to satisfy anyone's pallet.  The restaurant and bathroom were clean which usually means the kitchen is too. The staff was very friendly but not pushy, they weren't constantly checking to see if we needed more wine but stopped by enough to check and refill our glasses.  By the way if you like wine with your meals this place is great because that's all the serve not hard liquors or beer.  Would definitely go back again but make sure you reserve your table, they're a busy restaurant and you could end up waiting for a one."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite Thai place.  Everything was great including the service.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great for lunch! They make a delicious green curry. Their fried spinach salad is absolutely delicious. Just don't expect authentic Thai food, this very modern and Americanized."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time yesterday.  Service was prompt, got seated immediately for lunch.  It was a typically hot Vegas day, and they never let my water glass get empty. Food was excellent.  I'm a wimp about spicy foods, so I was pleased to find lots of non-spicy selections on their menu. I had pot stickers - done perfectly, and served with a delicious sauce.  Then came the chicken fried rice, also delicious.  I finished up with a chocolate mousse dessert the called Pot of Cream.  I'll definitely be back, and plan to bring friends."}
{"text":"This is a fancy Thai restaurant.
We love the spinach salad!!
And the pad Thai . The atmosphere is nice welcoming . It's very crowed and a little small but other than that the food was pretty good ."}
{"text":"I am a big fans of Thai foods . I was a regular customer in one of Thai restaurant around the corner for years . But since I found this restaurant I have been coming here . The foods are so good , place is clean and the staff are friendly"}
{"text":"Very unique and tasty dishes! I love that they have tapas! The Tamarind Shrimp was awesome and presentation is great! We also ordered the Drunken Noodles, Beef Jerky, Garlic Spare Ribs and the Bacon Wrapped Shrimp. NOTHING disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place was perfect in every way.  The service was the best service I've received in a long time. The  fried spinach salad is a must!  It is a smaller restaurant but I really liked that about this place. I'm sure on a busy night it's a wait to be seated but I don't mind..  I'll be eating here a lot more!"}
{"text":"My husband found this great Thai place in our new neighborhood.  The atmosphere is cozy and service was impressive.  I really enjoyed the eggplant with basil and the Pad Z U was tasty.  The portions were large, so great to share."}
{"text":"Food is amazing. Atmosphere is amazing. Customer service is amazing 5 stars all the way... best pad Thai in Las Vegas... the ahi appetizers are to die for"}
{"text":"This is a very comfortable, upscale, Thai restaurant. Decor and environment are nice. Wait staff is excellent. Food in general is quite good.  

We visited this place last nite. For a party of three, we ordered the following dishes:

Spinach tempura salad - great idea. Dipping sauce is excellent. Grade A. $11 each.
Volcano shrimp is excellent. Grade A. $12.
Avocado skirt steak is super. Meat is slighly over cooked. Grade A-. $24 each.
Crab Fried Rice is the best I have had. Grade A+. $15.
Shrimp Pad Thai is OK - shrimp is overcooked, not tasty. Pad Thai is too saucy and spongy ( over cooked ).  Grade B-.  $19. 

Pricing for this restaurant is on the high side. Can't really compare to the ordinary Thai restaurant."}
{"text":"Very good shrimp pad Thai. I'll be coming back. Nice atmosphere. Would be a nice date spot."}
{"text":"The \"Not So Secret Salad\" is one of my favorite salads in town! It's more of an interpretation than an actual salad, but I don't let that pesky detail get in the way. The dish is tempura-fried spinach leaves with a sweet-and-spicy dressing slash dipping sauce. You can dip the leaves as you go and eat it like nachos, or dump on the dressing and attempt to use a fork. Either way, your taste buds will be quite delighted. You can share this as an app or order it as your main, like I do.

Nittaya's Secret Kitchen has $11 lunch specials that include a salad and potsticker, as well as a Happy Hour (Mon-Thurs, 3-6PM). The Not So Secret Salad is also $11 though, so I find myself ordering that instead of branching out to try new things.

Small neighborhood place, classy décor and local art, lots of wines available. They have a small section of patio seating, and some day I'll actually try something else on the menu."}
{"text":"Really nice cozy place... The food was delicious and better than a typical Thai place, it felt more upscale and you can taste higher quality ingredients in the food.  The place has wine and beer also.  The service was nice and the waiter was pleasant.  The fruit infused water is a nice touch.  Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"I came to Nittaya's for a quick meal on a Friday night. We chose to sit outside on the patio & it was like out of sight out of mind because the service was painfully slow!  After 20 minutes I went inside to complain & it took another 10 minutes after that to be served! The inside was not even full & the service was so slow. The food was good but the service was so lacking I doubt I will be back!"}
{"text":"Love this little local restaurant. Low key, great ambience. I love the appetizers. Pretty good wine not a huge selection but this isn't a huge place. Perfect way to end a date night. We have only done the bar experience but we found this is the perfect way to start or end a evening. 
I personally don't care for Thai food ( in general)but the BF loves it, and he enjoyed his entree there. As I said the Appetizers were wonderful"}
{"text":"The best Thai food in Las Vegas. Food is excellent, service is excellent, and the decor is classy."}
{"text":"The service was exceptional. 
The food was okay, nothing special. It is pricey.
Good decor and ambiance.

We had the lunch specials which came with a vegetarian dumpling and small salad with house dressing. Both were good.

Our Lunch Specials:

Drunken Noodle, chicken: Good
Pineapple fried rice, chicken: Good
Cashew Chicken: Below average"}
{"text":"We stopped in for Lunch on a Sunday. Nittaya's has a Nice atmosphere and pleasant knowledgable servers. On our first visit We tried Thai egg rolls, citrus steak salad, home style shrimp pad Thai, each delicious! 

Update: I've been to Nittaya's multiple times, although today was the worst! We stopped in for lunch on a Monday at 2:30pm. 
My main dish- Combo Pad Thai off the full menu not the lunch special arrived with egg ( I ordered without/ allergic) so..I sent it back, of course! (The exact thing happened on my last visit to Nittaya's as well). Both times my server didn't notice,  I had to point it out:( When my food finally arrived my husband and daughter were finished with their lunches! I also asked for a 4 out of 5 on the heat ( my dish arrived with no heat).
The most upsetting part: place was empty- not busy at all! 
No apologies
Paid full price 
Last visit!"}
{"text":"Generally, I find the trend of fusion restaurants to be an empty fad.  Most of the time, one restaurant blending two culinary traditions simply fails at both of them, rather than creating something interesting.

So I walked into Nittaya's Secret Kitchen, which offers a fusion of tapas and Thai foods, with a heavy bias.  But I left pleasantly surprised because Nittaya's has mastered the art of juggling -- offering a wonderful selection of Thai and tapas fusion dishes that are often better than what you'd find in Thai or tapas restaurant.  

When we were there, we had the fried avocado for an appetizer.  It's the only time I've ever used the terms \"airy\" and \"fried\" to describe the same dish, but it really was an inventive combination with the delightful fried crispy shell surrounding the soft tastiness of a fresh avocado.  If you head over there, I'd put the fried avocado on your \"must have\" list.  

We also ordered the spinach salad, which was tasty, but not quite as magical as the fried avocado.  The spinach salad also comes with fried spinach leaves, which are tasteless on their own.  But dip the fried spinach leaves in the sweet cashew sauce provided on the side and it's fairly tasty.  A distant second to that lovely avocado, but creative in its own right.

For the mean course, we stuck with a more traditional Thai and ordered the red curry with chicken.  And kudos to Nittaya's for not dialing back the spice.  The red curry was spicier that I was expecting and super flavorful.  And they treat the ingredients right.  The vegetables?  Cooked and crisp.  The chicken?  Tender.  And they didn't skimp on the vegetables in the curry.

All in all, one of the better Thai places I've eaten in Vegas.  The prices are a little steep, but creativity doesn't come cheap in culinary land.

4.5 stars overall."}
{"text":"There's a reason why they take dinner reservations, this place is tiny. Also it's not very well laid-out. The food was ok, my dinner companions and I decided to do tapas but it took a very long time to get everything we ordered. Twice they sent us the wrong plates (figuring it's such a small place, it should have been easier to get out order correct!) and twice we had to remind out server what we were still waiting for. Gauging the value of the meal by balancing out service and atmosphere vs price leads me to conclude that I'll not be making another visit here."}
{"text":"Great service, awesome value lunch menu for 11 dollars with salad, potsticker and entree, red curry beyond amazing!  The best Thai in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"My measuring post for whether I return to a Thai restaurant is the Green Curry, so I ordered that as a lunch special. I found Nattaya's green curry chicken to be delicious, with a hint of spiciness, though not at all overwhelming. And here's the kicker...like many Thai restaurants, Nattaya uses ample bamboo shoots in their version, but like very few, they cook it in a way so as not to distract from the rest of the dish. Delicious!

All in all, I enjoyed my lunch, which also included a refreshing house salad and potsticker as part of the special. Their wait staff was very attentive and friendly, and this surely enhanced my dining experience. Will I be back - absolutely. Now that Nattaya has made me a believer with their Green Curry, I'm ready to explore the rest of the seemingly delectable menu, which includes ample \"small plates\" by the way."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I drive to Vegas from Phoenix to eat here - often. Granted we're there to visit friends and stuff too but like, look guys: come with us to Nittaya's or get wrecked because we're going. 

The atmosphere is fantastic. It's a quiet place with low lighting and friendly staff. Basically everything I'm looking for in a restaurant. Loud, bustling, bright places are fine but I have to be in the mood to interact with large groups of people. The only thing worse than people is large groups of them, amirite?

No words I can say will do the food any justice. You just need to try it. Any of it, all of it. Each dish brought to you has a quality that is indicative of the fact that the person who created the dish loves to cook. Their passion for cooking shines through this food in a way that's enjoyable in and of itself. There's a profound joy in taking part in a thing that someone clearly loves, and this is the place to experience that. 

I really hope this restaurant is doing and continues to do well."}
{"text":"I went to Nittayas Secret Kitchen for tapas and drinks last evening.  It was truly a delightful experience from start to finish.  We were seated immediately upon arrival at the restaurant and were treated with respect by all members of staff.  It was clear that customer service is a huge priority for the employees at this establishment. 

In regards to the food, the crab wantons were incredible. They were perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. A great suggestion from our waitress. Also, the Bangkok Fried Rice was an incredible addition as well. It had an excellent combination of savory flavors.  

I would highly recommend Nittayas Secret Kitchen and will absolutely be back."}
{"text":"Great food! Great service! Great decor! Love this little gem.  Cozy and refreshing. Beautiful and simple. Nittaya takes great care of this restaurant and all the details. I felt comfortable here, no snootiness. Fresh flowers inside and as some beautiful well plated designs. A nice small patio. Feels like a romantic escape. Very flavorful food, great use of spices. All the servers were kind, helpful, and attentive. I will be back for sure!!!! :) 

I had the 5 Spiced Ribs, the World Famous Spinach Salad, a Thai tea, a Lucky Budha, and a water infused with stawberries and oranges. Can't wait to come back and try more."}
{"text":"Met some friends here on a Tuesday night when I was in Vegas (the restaurant is located in Summerlin, NW of the strip) & it was quite busy.  We made reservations and they are definitely recommended because seating is limited.  I had the tofu pad thai, spicy edamame, fried tofu & veggie pot stickers which were all spectacular!  The flavors were excellent, service was on point (considering how busy it was) & ambiance is definitely upscale.  

Definitely a worthwhile trip--good thai is hard to find in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Nittaya's is the best Thai restaurant in Las Vegas.  I highly recommend this place.  I not only love the food, but the atmosphere is fantastic.  There is also a great Wine list.   My favorite dish is the Green Curry Salmon with egg plant and avocado.  Delicious!!! Crying Tiger steak is likewise fantastic.  Service is right there anticipating you needs."}
{"text":"Great Pad Thai, lettuce wraps, and pad See ew. All in all a delicious restaurant with great service hidden in a little strip mall."}
{"text":"Great place.

Excellent staff and service.
Cold cold STELLA beer!
Tasty dishes - all very yummy.
Great atmosphere
Highly recommend 
Go every week
So many amazing APPs....try them ALL!
PS - coconut ice cream is to DIE for!"}
{"text":"We discovered Nittaya's about 6 months ago when we moved to Summerlin. We have been here 6 times since (would be more but we have small children) and every single time it has been outstanding! The atmosphere is more for date nights. It's a small, romantic and intimate setting not very ideal for bringing small children but we have! Our favorite items are the braised short rib curry, the avocado salmon curry and the whole coconut seafood curry. ALL outstanding. The secret potstickers and mussels on the appetizer menu are equally delicious. They have a 1-5 spice level you can request which is amazing because we love spicy thai food. Level 4 is perfect. You can sample different wines before purchasing which makes it nice. The menu is priced accordingly. If you want crap Thai food you'll pay cheaper prices for it. At Nittaya's, you get what you pay for! It is beyond extraordinary. We would come here a lot more if we could afford to, believe me. It's definitely a treat to come at least once a month for us. We are fortunate that we live so close. IF you don't live that close, it is worth the trip! Definitely make reservations on weekends because it gets busy. We have been fortunate not ever to wait too long for a table though. Service also is outstanding. Their infused water is so good. I can't say one thing that needs improvement here. Love it love it love it!!!!!"}
{"text":"Food was not fresh, over seasoned, loaded with salt and with MSG, not authentic Thai food. This is American Thai restaurant. Look around you don't see Thai people eating here.

We ordered drunken noodle and cashew chicken. Cashew chicken does not even taste like cashew chicken. Not even a cashew in sight.  Flavors were off and had to ask waiter where was the cashew in the cashew chicken. Ask why cashew chicken does not taste like cashew chicken. Waiter said this is how cashew chicken taste like here. Major dehydration afterwards. Prepare to drink lots of water.


Ask waiter how much it was to substitute shrimp for chicken.  He said 2 to 3 dollars. End up paying more than three dollars to substitute the meat. Asked him why it was over three dollars( despite asking him in advance )he said it could be anything. 

I guess you should have him write it down on paper before substituting any type of meat here. They will charge you whatever they feel like. Don't come here if you don't want to get rip off for unauthentic Thai food and overpay."}
{"text":"It was so good. I will be back again and again. I have anointed this place as my LV Thai spot. I have been looking for my go to and I got it."}
{"text":"Everytime I go here, it never disappoints!!  The \"Spinach Salad\" is one of my favorite apps in the city..That dressing..OMG....My go to for lunch are any of the curry dishes or the drunken noodles.  Fantastic!!"}
{"text":"Truly a best kept secret!!!!  The food is amazing and Josh behind the bar is an awesome bartender/server!!  Our favorite dishes are the beef jerky, Phuket poppers,  ruing tiger steak and my personal fav the chicken pad woon sen!!! They have a very eclectic wine list and the bar is cozy.  Whether you're on a romantic date or just hanging w friends the atmosphere is perfect and always good people watching!"}
{"text":"Always such a great experience at Nittaya's!! 

Always start with the not so secret salad, seriously it's a must to try!! Game changer for salads!
Typically, I do the tapas so I'm able to try a few different dishes while I'm dining. Last night we had the crab wontons and firecracker shrimp. Both were amazing dishes! I really have NEVER had a bad dish at this restaurant! 
Always love their infused water, last night was orange and cucumber.. delish and so refreshing. 

Be aware that this is a very small and intimate restaurant. If you're looking to be loud, this is not the place to be. Also, make a reservation for dinner if you're hoping to get a table. Otherwise, decent sized bar to sit at without reservations. 

I will always recommend Nittaya's and will always be back for more! :)"}
{"text":"Hands down, one of the best places in vegas! I recommend the salad, avocado steak curry, drunken noodles and bread pudding. Great place for a date."}
{"text":"I went in for a quiet lunch at the bar. My waiter James was great. The menu is given to you on a wooden clip board with a bunch of papers. I didn't like the concept it was hard to get a really good look at the menu. The decor had a really homey feel and love their wine board in back of the bar.
I ordered the garlic endame and basil chicken entree. The endame was good but nothing special. I would have liked a little more spices. The basil chicken was awesome! I ordered it mild so it had just a little kick but the sauce was just right. The plum wine was good as well. I wanna buy a bottle. Overall the experience was great and nice spot for lunch if you want Thai."}
{"text":"I am teetering between a 3 and 4 star review and because of the rocky start to our evening, I am going to have to go with the 3 star for the moment.

When we arrived on a Thursday afternoon, around 5:30p, this very cute and intimate restaurant was pretty much empty. However, the host asked if we had a reservation (we didn't), and said that he wouldn't be able to seat us because it was 1/2 priced wine night, and they'd fill up. Um..okay.... (looking around empty restaurant)... Well, can we sit at the bar? Long pause. How about outside? They hesitated, but said they'd set up one of the outside tables. That was a process that took awhile. Because it was a bit breezy outside, we asked if they could set up the outdoor space heater. Another process.  That finally being settled, we sat down at the somewhat shaky table.

From that point forward, things went well enough. The sangria is delicious and beautifully presented. We ordered the fried avocado, the veggie potstickers and the mango bacon wrapped shrimp. All of these offerings were very good and again, the presentation was lovely. Service was friendly and pleasant. 

As the evening progressed, the wind picked up, and even with the space heater, I was downright cold. I asked our server if it was possible to move us inside to finish. We went inside, and while it was busy, there was a small table right by the bar. She said that the reservation wasn't until 7, so we would have plenty of time to complete our meal. So...why weren't we just seated there in the first place?

The seating issues did put a bit of a damper on the meal, but I am willing to give Nittaya's another try."}
{"text":"The food is sooooo yummy!! The atmosphere is so comforting and chill as well. My favorite part was the Bangkok tea and how they served it in a cast iron kettle. The waitress was so sweet and helpful! I had no idea what I was doing or what I was ordering and she picked that up quickly and explained things to me/suggested things for me. She rocked!"}
{"text":"Yum! Came here for a late lunch, and just in time for happy hour, and it was delicious! It is a secret kitchen because from the outside, it looks dark -- almost like it's closed. There isn't an \"open\" sign, so at first, I actually thought that they were closed. The door also sticks a little bit, so you really have to yank hard to open the door. I thought that I was the only idiot to get tricked by this, but while sitting inside, it looked like several others were also fell for that trick! Guys, the secret is that Nittaya's Secret Kitchen is actually open! 
I'm glad that I was able to make it for happy hour, as I got to try some of the appetizers. They definitely have more of the \"common\"/\"less exciting\" tapas on happy hour (e.g., dumplings), but I was satisfied with everything I ordered. For tapas, I shared the bacon wrap shrimp, the garlic edamame, and the fried avocados. You can't really go wrong with bacon-wrapped shrimp, but I was pleasantly surprised by the size of the shrimp. They definitely weren't shrimpy shrimp! The garlic edamame was REALLY good. It was really garlicy and had a nice kick to it! I think that they might have pan fried it, instead of steaming it, to give it an extra crisp. The fried avocado was really good! Again, most things are good when fried, but what really made it above and beyond was the cilantro sauce. 
I also got the kao soi to share for an entree: the kao soi is really good! It's a bit pricey, but the portion is generous. I was worried that there wouldn't be enough to share, but there was plenty. The curry had a rich, spicy, coconut-y flavor, with a few large chunks of pork. 
I ended up sitting at the bar. The bartenders were friendly and willing to make recommendations and help explain some of the items on the menu. 
I would have loved to see some of their other more tapas on the happy hour menu."}
{"text":"One of the best Thai places I've been to in Summerlin area. The food was absolutely delicious. We have the chicken basil entree which was fantastic and perfect flavors. Opted for level 3 spice, which wasn't too spicy and would probably increase next time. The garlic rice with the chicken basil... you must try! The spinach tapas was really good along with the garlic edamame. There was no wait on a Sunday night at 7:00pm. Service was just okay. The server forgot one of our entree orders and bartender brought our bottled beers over, offered and suggested we use one of their cold beer glasses, we said yes.. then he never came back. It's okay though, it didn't change the fact that the food was delicious and I'd come back just to fulfill my Thai food fix!"}
{"text":"Very good Thai food, thought I didn't think it was amazing, it was still really good. the Atmosphere is all really nice and cozy. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"This is best Thai food I've had since moving to Vegas a year ago. So far I've tried the pad thai, mussels, basil eggplant, and fried avocados. I don't have a single complaint about any of these dishes. Pad Thai is usually the dish I use to determine how good a Thai place is, and the flavor is on point. Great balance of flavors, perfect portion size, just the right amount of crumbled peanuts. It's quite s treat.

In addition to the food, the ambience is quaint and perfect for a relaxing meal. The staff has been nothing but exceptional on each visit. I will definitely be coming back many times."}
{"text":"Small, intimate, great service. Good selection of wines. Spinach salad and soft shell crab are my favorite dishes! The small plates are all delicious and great for sharing!"}
{"text":"To begin, I am not the biggest fan of thai food to begin with, but this place was great.  We went with another couple and seemed to order everything on the menu.  I don't like spinach, but they got a spinach salad that was great, the lamb was excellent too.  I would make a reservation if going for dinner as it was super packed and the place is relatively small."}
{"text":"Had an amazing dinner here tonight. Intimate restaurant - completely non \"Vegas\" - like. Cozy ambiance, delicious meal. Restaurant was packed so definitely make reservations.

Highly recommend the spinach salad and lemongrass soup. 

Also, my compliments to the staff for handling a VERY rude couple a few seats down from us. They had one thing wrong on their meal and threatened the owner with posting a scathing Yelp review. Restaurant staff did what they could in a packed room, and honestly it wasn't a big deal."}
{"text":"Had reservations for a Saturday night.  Great food and great service.  Had some small plates and one entree to share.  And hen dessert.  You must see and taste the dessert menu."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch.  I walked in and the waiter was extremely nice and seated us. They had some wonderful infused water.  The waiter explained the items on the menu and gave us his recommendations.  I had the red curry, my girlfriend had the pad thai and my friend had the drunken noodles. I tried them all and they were all excellent.  You get to choose on a scale of 1-5 for spice level and it can get very spicy.  I can't wait to come back and try more items off their menu."}
{"text":"From the million items on the menu to the soft indie oldies covers, I was smitten. We got a million things to share, and each was p dank. We ended up getting two orders of the tempura avocados. Who knew breading avocados could make them 10x better? It seemed pretty expensive with all the small plates, but if were being honest, I didn't pay the bill, so I didn't really care. This is a perfect third date spot - the one you go on when you're expecting to get laid. Loud enough for pauses to not be awkward, but quiet enough to have nice convos. 
They also last-minute put together a bunch of tables to seat all 8 of us in a rather small restaurant, so that hospitality is greatly appreciated. Oodles of pescatarian options, many could be veg if requested. Not that I am, but just so ya know!"}
{"text":"I dream of the green curry. This place is super tasty. I wish the dishes were a tad cheaper for sure, but overall very yummy. Everyone I have taken has very much enjoyed it. 

I can not order above a 2 for spice- and I'm not a spice chicken by any means... this mess is HOT! Husband ordered the pork and green beans at a 4 and it was so hot I could barely eat it, but so yummy that I sure kept trying! 

Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"What can I say, I really like this place.  It's not traditional Thai, but what do you expect with Thai tapas.  Everything I had was really, really good and inventive.  

My husband and I were starving so we started off with three \"tapas\" - the shrimp patties, stuffed angel wings, and spinach salad.  I love the spinach salad!  It's tempura spinach leaves served in a big cone (like French fries) with a yummy dressing on the side.  The shrimp patties and stuffed angel wings were also very good, but the spinach salad stole the show.  The shrimp patties were pretty much what you would expect.  The menu says \"Thai spices\" but the patties aren't spicy at all.  Decent size and the plum sauce drizzled on top tasted great. The stuffed angel wings are a little different than what I'm used to, but still yummy.  A lot more chicken than \"stuffing\" and with cilantro.  

For entrees, we had the spicy green bean pork and the basil beef.  Their spice rating system is from 1 to 5.  The spicy green bean pork can only be made a \"2\" or higher.  Hence the word \"spicy\" in the name.  We got the pork as a \"2\" and the beef as a \"4.\"  The \"2\" was just perfect for me and the pork with green beans was delicious.  The beef was also good but I could tell it had more oil on it and I would probably break into a sweat if ate too much.  The entrees come with white rice, which was cooked properly.  All the plates come with little orchids on them and are served family style.  I liked the presentation of all the dishes, especially the spinach salad.

For beer, they have Peroni, Blue Moon, and Coors Light on tap. We ended up having two Blue Moons, which went really well with the food. They do have some more interesting beers by the bottle, such as a Joseph James stout.  They have a very nice selection of wines but all the red wine is stored on shelves, so it might be too warm.  But they did have a sign outside offering 50% of wine by the bottle on Thursdays so I may have to check that out.  They also carry some sake.  

Most of the desserts have coconut.  It's a Thai restaurant so I expect that.  We ended up having the Thai donuts, which were really tasty.  The caramel sauce is supposed to have coconut in it, but I didn't taste it.

They took my restaurant.com certificate, no problem.  Service was great - very attentive and helpful.  

Small, cute place.  A little dark, especially in the bathroom, but the décor is nice.  Looking at the reviews, I think this restaurant has been paying attention and making adjustments because I didn't have close to the same experience other reviewers had. This restaurant is definitely going on my regular rotation."}
{"text":"I went to Nittaya's twice before and my wife and I sat at the bar. The food and service were both good. We recently went back with another couple and sat in the dining area. The food tasted different but that was not the problem. It was the service in the dining area. Everyone was nice and helpful but management apparently has them stepping over one another. The servers take the orders are are knowledgeable.THEN, they are basically finished as the bussers deliver the food! So what - right? No, not all right because the bussers don't know who ordered what and have to ask everyone what they ordered and are not able to answer questions. God help you if the order is wrong. They need to get the server to solve the problem. I feel bad for the bussers as they are not trained on the menu and shouldn't be expected to be knowledgeable on food and wine. Others in the room had quizzical looks on their faces as they tried to get answers before their food got cold. Too bad really. I won't go back with a party of three or larger."}
{"text":"My husband and I had some good friends in town, and wanted to take them somewhere for dinner that they couldn't experience where they live. Nittaya's certainly fit the bill!

Speaking of bills, I'll start there - we were shocked when the bill arrived, and were anticipating it to be about 30% more than it was. For $120 (before tip), we ordered:

The famous tempura spinach salad
Corn fritters 
Wontons 
Spring rolls
Shrimp pad Thai
Chicken pad Thai
FOB rice
Emerald rice 
a Thai iced tea

If you've been here before, you know that is a lot of food! We took home leftovers for sure!

My friend is a pescetarian, and our server was happy to have our dressing for the spinach salad prepared without ground chicken. She also pointed out that the corn fritters contained pork when she brought them to the table, which I thought was nice since we were sharing, and my friend hasn't seen the item description. 

My heat level here is 1-5, I ordered a 3 and was happy with that...their 3 would be a 4 at Le Thai. My FOB rice was astounding - full of tender chicken, and juicy pineapple. All the shared tapas were fantastic also! 

Our friends have been to Las Vegas many times, and we love taking them different places each visit, but they have already requested we come back here on their next visit this fall! So glad we decided to let them in on one of Las Vegas' best Secrets."}
{"text":"We went there Christmas Eve on the recommendation of friends who love this place. I would recommend reservations, as the room is quite small. One of my companions and I split tapas of beef jerky and egg rolls. The jerky was quite good, but the egg rolls seemed pretty standard. The spinach salad is amazing, and as I live close by, I drop by frequently to pick it up at lunch time to go. The entrees we had were very good... just the right amount of \"bite\" in the items that were supposed to bite. 

A couple of downs that kept me from giving it a fifth star. First, the room is *really* dark; so much so that my 17-year old couldn't see the menu, and he can read the Lord's Prayer off the head of a pin. The manager told me they'd had a few comments about this, and may invest in some penlights to help patrons. Since the menu is eclectic, it really helps to be able to read it. The second thing was that two of my companions are vegetarians, a fact of which I made very clear to the waiter when we came in. One of my companions ordered the Tofu Pad Thai, which she said was quite good until she was about a third through it and found that in addition to the tofu, it contained... chicken. Buzz kill. They were very apologetic, but this should *not* happen, ever, and it was exacerbated by the fact that the restaurant lights are so dim that it is sometime hard to discern what you're eating. 

Overall, I thought the food great, the service acceptable, but the ambience too dark.

That's just my opinion. I coud be wrong."}
{"text":"My sons took me here for Mothers Day, food was excellent. I had the duck curry and it was so tender it was like sweet butter melting in your mouth. The flavors  were rich but not overpowering! I think I had a glass of plum wine which I would highly recommend as it complements the curry magnificently."}
{"text":"It's my favorite restaurant in Vegas, it is a true hidden gem.  If you like great food and a great staff go here.  Their happy hour is super inexpensive but it doesn't matter what time you go the food is always going to keep you coming back.
Highlights of the menu: \"beef jerky\", served with a side sauce that is to die for, spiced edamame. no idea what all is in the seasoning but it will make your mouth happy, spinach salad is great, it's all over reviews but it's the dressing that makes the dish, you could put it on anything.  The staff is pretty fun, Lea is our favorite but everybody is super helpful and good spirited.
One more note, this is an all events restaurant, date night, yes, family dinners, yes, dining with friends yes.  There isn't an event that wouldn't work here.  Call ahead for a large party would be the only tip."}
{"text":"Had lunch there the other day. Had the drunken noodles, fried rice, pot stickers, and chicken satay. The food was decent, not greasy, ok flavor, but a bit overboard with garnishes everywhere. Just that non of the dishes made me say wow. For me the ambiance was a little off putting, to dark, and missing the traditional thai feel I'm used to. Feelt alittle rushed to eat and go. Just wasn't all that impressed, seemed like a overly priced thai restaurant with ok food. With all the good comments I expected more.  Probably won't go back, I'll stick with my thai mom and pop restaurant."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is wonderful. The employees were very friendly and  great at providing serve.  They make you want to come back.  The food is delightful.  I was there for lunch and I had so many excellent choices I had to solicit help from another customer. I will be going back very soon.  Forgot to mention the most important part..... Fabulous selection of wine."}
{"text":"What a total surprise.  This place came highly recommended but I didn't know the Thai food background of either person recommending the restaurant.  I have had Thai in several countries including those down under.  Just had exceptional Thai in San Diego soooooo when I got here I anticipated a good Thai meal & instead I had a meal that beat all the others.  The drunken noodles we're with broccolini & ground chicken (thought it wasn't going to be a good choice). This was cooked to perfection!  The eggplant dish was so good though I'm not a vegetarian I'd come back to just have this.  The red curry chicken was so flavorful & smooth.  While we were stuffed you simply can not leave a message like this without Mango & sticky rice....WOW.  oh I forgot to mention the infused water was refreshing.  Gorgeous atmosphere & I'd absolutely make sure to come back.  Hell I'd drive 6 hrs just to eat here again!"}
{"text":"Gf liked the boullabaise, spinach tempura interesting at first...fish cake rubbery but flavorful.  Very nice decor. Great napkin folding.  Waiter hawked a phlegmball just as we were taking our first bite in an otherwise quiet restaurant."}
{"text":"This is a small intimate restaurant. Great food. Great wine selection. One of the top Thai restaurants I've had. The duck breast curry was a little tough but delicious. The service is great. The prices are moderate but the portions are very generous. I had a great experience. Next time I have to try the spinach salad. It looked very delicious. 

This is definitely a hidden gem in Vegas! 

Oh yes and half off wine bottles on Thursday!"}
{"text":"I was visiting my boyfriend in Las Vegas and instead of acting like tourists on the Strip, I thought it would be fun to have a culinary adventure around town.  I had read an article about Nittaya's Secret Kitchen in a local magazine and decided to give it a try.  The atmosphere was great and the food was delicious!  As an appetizer, we ordered the \"spinach salad\" and the potato pouches in curry sauce.  Both were amazing.  I had never had tempura spinach before and I quite enjoyed it, especially when dipped in the accompanying sauce.  I think the measure of any Thai restaurant can be found in what their curry tastes like, and this one did not disappoint.  I look forward to coming back and ordering a curry entree next time.  The third dish we ordered was the drunken noodles.  It was a little on the sweet side, but still very tasty.  The reason why I knocked off a star, despite the phenomenal food, had to do with the snooty attitude of the hostess/waitress as we walked in.  My boyfriend and I decided to bike to the restaurant (so we were both in casual/sporty clothes) and the hostess/waitress seemed surprised when we said we wanted a table to eat there.  Nittaya's has a nice, intimate vibe, but I don't think we were so out of place as to deserve that reaction.  Especially since two women in yoga clothes walked in ten minutes later.  Despite that setback, I would definitely return to enjoy more delicious Thai cuisine!"}
{"text":"Excellent cuisine with a friendly staff and owner.  The dessert menu is aptly titled \"Happy Endings\".  For a Thai restaurant, its utterly hilarious!"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem in this town,  ten tables,  elegant and romantic atmosphere,  amazing food  great service.  This is one of our favorite go to spots. , me and my daughter had date night tonight and we had their signature spinach salad and it is literally one my favorite dishes,  I can't come here ever without ordering it,  you must try!!!!!!  We also ordered the shrimp padding Thai was amazing and the mango sticky rice for dessert, wow now that's what a mango should taste like,  warm,  sweet,  tender served with sweet sticky rice  yum!!! I have tried Alot of the dishes on menu  drunken noodles,  garlic spare ribs,  the curry   you really just can't go wrong here,  you will add this place to your favorites too!!"}
{"text":"Incredible, loved everything about this restaurant from the servers to the food and everything in between! Do yourself a favor and go. You will be so pleased that you did! One of the very best restaurants in all of Las Vegas! It is very small, so call ahead and make a reservation!"}
{"text":"There food is decent however for the price it's not worth it. As well as the customer service, they triple charged me which added up to around over $300. Not impressed which is unfortunate, I had high hopes."}
{"text":"Being from San Francisco I've grown accustom to the down home style cooking of Thai restaurants back there. Since moving out here (5 yrs ago) I've been so disappointed with every single supposed Thai restaurant I've come across. 

NITTAYA'S SECRET KITCHEN is the answer to all my food prayers. Her food gives you that warm feeling inside like it was cooked especially for you & makes you want to give the Chef a hug for such great food. 

A must try is her \"WORLD FAMOUS SPINACH SALAD\" its the most DELICIOUS thing I've ever tasted. Individually tempura fried spinach served with a chicken larb... OMG! i could seriously eat this everyday. 

You should also give her Pad Thai a try... its not your typical \"sour, orangie looking pad Thai\" It has the perfect balance of sweet, salt & sour 

I could honestly go on forever about this place but you guys should check it out for yourself. If you're all the way on the other side, it worth the drive!!"}
{"text":"I don't know how I didn't hear about Nittaya's sooner. I loved the atmosphere. The service was good the food was quality. I'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"The place was so much smaller than I originally thought, but we came after the dinner rush so it wasn't too crowded. We made reservations and they saved a nice booth in the corner for my boyfriend and I. 

We ordered the spinach salad and a large sake to start off with. For our entrees we got the salmon avocado curry and garlic basil lamb chops. Sooo flavorful! Although we were pretty full we decided that since we don't know when the next time is that we'll be able to stop by, we might as well try their dessert too. It was mango coconut rice with Thai mangos that are only in season for a few months. Next time I want to try the banana chocolate beignets! 

Overall, I was thoroughly impressed with everything. Food, atmosphere, and service. I would definitely suggest this to others."}
{"text":"This restaurant has good service but no AC in the hot summer of Las Vegas heat!!! It was a 110 degree day. My husband and I were sweating profusely during  dinner. We asked the waiter to make it cooler but he said the AC was  at the maximum setting. It literally felt like we were in Thailand ."}
{"text":"I've come to Nittaya's over a dozen times for lunch now and have yet to have even a mediocre meal. The staff are friendly and attentive, and the restaurant itself is clean, sleek, and modern with a wine bar and two intimate dining rooms. Both the red curry and basil chicken burst with flavor, also be sure to try the spicy garlic edamame. Bottom line, if you're a fan of Thai food, you're missing out if you don't try Nittaya's. While not inexpensive, prices are still on the reasonable side and the return in the quality of food and service is evident and well worth it."}
{"text":"This is a good Summerlin find, especially if you're a Thai and wine fan (thats me). 
They have a great selection of wine to choose from, along with some really good red sangria. I definitely recommend the sangria. 
I ordered the basil chicken and the muay thai fried rice. I liked that the basil chicken wasn't over sauced and had a bit of a kick to it for me. I can't handle too much spice, so this was just enough. But you can step it up asking for a spiciness from 1 - 5. 
I liked that the fried rice had a bit more to it, with peppers and basil. 
Overall, this is a good place for lunch or dinner, or just a glass of wine. 
ProTip: on the weekends, be sure to make a reservation for dinner."}
{"text":"INCREDIBLE !!! 
The service , the food , the vibe .. 
Just perfect for a date night .. If your into real Thai food not watered down versions then this is the place to be .. Thursday 1/2 off wine is a big plus ..  The volcano shrimp are made to perfection crunchy but not oily and the sauce  full of flavor not just spicy .. Oh wait almost forgot the lemon Grass soup the best I've ever had at a restaurant ... Last but not least I Totally recommend the spinach salad .. Now back to my date night with my wife before she kicks my Ars lol . 2 thumbs up and a slap on the ass :)"}
{"text":"spinach salad is awesome! Lunch specials are affordable which includes a small salad, gyoza and entree. Tried almost everything in the menu and so far not disappointed at all."}
{"text":"Five stars everytime!  We've been coming here almost weekly since we found out about this place.  Never had anything I didn't absolutely love and the food is always consistent! Amazing service, small and intimate.  Nittaya's cooking is an art form."}
{"text":"Not bad, but other nearby places offer better bang for the buck. Ugh- and the skinny white chair was extremely uncomfortable- not ideal for dining out. The seat of the chair had no padding and was too thin. A rethink of the chairs are a must and should be made an immediate priority."}
{"text":"The food was very good as was the service. I enjoyed the tamarind shrimp for an appetizer (although I would have loved if it was served with a small salad or garnish of rice or vegetables). I also had the pad see ew, which was very tasty and hot when it came out. The only downside was it got cold before I could finish it because it was on a plate. It wasn't as good cold. The service was also very good."}
{"text":"This is a pleasant little restaurant close to our Summerlin community. The food was adequate, however the hair in my salad was a bit of a disappointment.  When I showed it to our server, she said she was really sorry however no offer of a replacement was forthcoming.

The only suggestion I can offer to those who wish to go there is that they inspect their food carefully before eating it."}

Nittaya is one of the sweetest and nicest owners that you will probably not actually meet. The secret on Nittaya's has been out for a long time...almost as soon as she moved up Lake Mead, transitioning from take-out to one of the nicer Thai restaurants in town. So, unless you knew her from her previous incarnation years ago, or you are a true regular at Nittaya's Secret Kitchen, then the amiable chef and owner is probably the only secret left at Nittaya's.

The World Famous Spinach Salad with tempura spinach, lime dressing, and chicken has lived up to its name. I had loved Nittaya's curries before, but this was the dish that brought heightened interest and demonstrated that there was a lot more than traditional curries and noodles  to be had at Nittaya's. It used to be a staple anytime I came and I will still return to it from time-to-time.

These days I am just as likely to branch out and try something new, or return to something that I haven't had in a while. One of my favorites is the Salmon-Avocado Curry--green curry with eggplant, avocado, and zucchini. I don't see myself getting tired of this dish anytime soon.

Nittaya's can hold their own against most of the Thai restaurants in town. Certainly one of the better options, but what separates them is that they are one of three elevated Thai restaurants in town that incorporates great food with a lovely ambiance."}
{"text":"I really like this place I have been here many times. Food is tasty and atmosphere is cool and in the summer you can eat outside ."}
{"text":"Wonderful experience. The staff from the hostess, to the busboy, food runner and server was outstanding. The atmosphere is dim lit and very romantic and comforting. They start you off with a strawberry mint water which was very refreshing. We started with the spinach salad because it was so highly recommend on yelp. No idea how they fry and tempura loose leaf spinach like that, but it was very good. A little heavy and a very large portion for two people, so we barely dented the plate but it was still delicious. It was served with a special sauce that is rich and decadent, so be sparing. The Thai tea was a must have. And we split the green curry salmon which was served with an avocado on top, eggplant and zucchini. It was large enough to split for two. We were stuffed but had to order the mango sticky rice for dessert which was in season, and which I will probably be craving for the rest of my life! It was superb! I appreciate the fact that They only have it on the menu when the mango is in season and is just right. To me, that Really shows that Mrs.Nittaya is very dedicated to her menu and her beautiful creations. I would love to meet this fantastic chef. Every plate was divine. Decorated with flowers and special care. I highly recommend. My favorite curry is yellow, or massaman,  but I had to try something different. I look forward to going back for their lunch specials and also the happy hour!!"}
{"text":"Shawndee was fantastic! Kept us entertained but still allowed us to have privacy. Food was fantastic as always. Couldn't believe how good the mussels were!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best little gems in Las Vegas! Quaint, charming, intimate setting with incredible Thai food. I have always been a lover of Thai food but Nittaya's is taking it to the next level. It is inventive, creative and sexy! This is a great place for date night or to come have Thai tapas with friends and enjoy their happy hour. ($5 tapas $5 glasses of wine) You MUST try the spinach salad. It's individually tempura fried spinach leaves with an amazing Thai cashew dipping sauce! Also the Basil Tofu is fantastic as is the Coconut Curry Chicken! WOW I cannot say enough great things about this place!"}
{"text":"I mentioned this restaurant for a business meeting, I had eaten here before many times, as we had dinner and it was the worst experience I could have ever dreamed of. The bacon wrap was dry and so were the crab cakes.
The service was super slow, one of the members of our party asked for a steak, and it did not come out until we all had finished eating. The gentleman ate his steak, and the rest of us, having finished, just sat with him. Then, the server came out with a salad they insisted we ordered, and we had not! We had all finished eating!
We had to pay for the salad, they never offered to pack up for us to take and charged us for it! That salad went back to the kitchen and guaranteed, they served to the next person that ordered it!
Will never recommend them again, or will I ever eat there again."}
{"text":"The service here better than we expected! They had a beautiful seating area outside. We were served infused water. Definitely very fancy, fusion Thai food!! Our server was very informative and full of suggestions. He really made us feel welcomed."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, but more on the high end quiet restaurant type vs take out. I prefer it, but opted not to bring my 3-1/2 year old grandson (to spare others). 

My first visit there was a great experience, the food was tasty and cooked to perfection. We did have some miscommunication on the level of spice in my Pad Thai however. They offer a level of heat between 1-5. When I asked my waiter her opinion of the heat, she wasn't of much help and kind of insinuated that they don't make their food too hot. So I ordered a 5 (I like my food hot), but not so much that I can't taste the food! That said, I requested a 5, and told her if I wanted to go hotter, I could always add some in on the side- sort of determine that level on my own.

When she returned with my food, she said, \"I ordered you a 5, but I had them add extra to spice it up\". Hmmm. Well, that extra spice they added made the food intolerable. It was beyond what any restaurant should serve if they want their patrons to actually taste their food. It wasn't enjoyable at all (and I can eat hot chili peppers for breakfast) :)

Overall, the other food we ordered was very tasty. So we returned another night for take out. This time I ordered a level 3 for my Pad Thai. The second time around was not as impressive as the first. The Pad Thai had almost no flavor, spice or otherwise. Even after adding an entire container of chili paste they provided on the side. It was just bleh. 

The eggplant dish was absolutely delicious though, totally worth trying!"}
{"text":"Second time in two months I had lunch with a friend at this restaurant and once again, same bad service.  First off, seems if you order off the lunch menu, they assume you are in a hurry and rush to place the order and bring out the food.  The problem is that the food arrives before the salad and potsticker that is included in the lunch option. The food was not very hot either.  Asked the wait staff about the salad and potsticker and they just gave a rather blank, \"huh?\" kinda look.  Five minutes later, the salads came out and were strangely bland with a lot of vinegar on the lettuce.  

Another issue is that you are given two forks and a napkin, no knife.  So because we ordered noodle dishes, we asked for knives, again, blank look from the wait staff.  

We were not in a hurry, we do not work, bad assumption on the part of the staff, however, no excuse for the lack of manners and bad service for the second time.  We will not be back, ever!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for a date night out. The tapas are great. Thursdays are half off select wine bottles. Reservations are a good idea."}
{"text":"I have spent a lot of time in Northern and Southern California where there are big Thai communities and the restaurants work very hard to be the best in their food genre.
This place is cute and they worked very hard to make it look amazing...which it does.
The waitstaff is awesome. They are attentive and they are friendly.

The food is Thai food for people who haven't had real Thai food. Thai food should have layers of flavor all working together. 

For example..we ordered the Coconut Soup and the FOB Rice (Fresh off Pineapple Boat). These items were tasty, except the chicken that is being used for this was cooked in such a way that they could use in in both dishes. These means that the chicken has to be cooked with no discernable taste. Although the soup and the Rice were really awesome, when you get to the pieces of chicken, they haven't been able to develop any flavor and they are extremely bland. This takes a potentially awesome dish and kills the awesomeness.

We did order a few appetizers, Curry Puffs, Secret Stickers, and Edamame. The Curry Puffs and  Secret Stickers are interestingly enough cooked in what seems to be a Bisquick-type dough instead of the typical Thai-style dumpling shao-mai wrappers. The Edamame had the layers of flavor and heat that I was looking for.

When I expressed to the waitress that I wished that the food was a little hotter, she did bring me three things to add to my meal. The first one was a dish of pepper flakes, the second was something that may have been sriracha and the last was the sriracha with the pepper flakes in it. Thai sauces should vary, not just be about heat but should be about traditional Thai flavors.

We also ordered 2 entrees, the Crying Tiger Steak and the Kao-Soi (Pork Shoulder).
The steak arrived cooked perfectly but cold. (This is why many restaurants will tell you that a plate is hot when they serve your food...a room temperature plate will lower the heat of your meal by 10 degrees or more by the time it gets to your table) and the Kao-Soi in this bath of really tasty but a sloppy mess of slightly overcooked egg noodles. The pork was cooked perfectly. All was tasty.

WIll we go back? No.
There are so many places in Vegas that we will only return to the ones that have memorable food...and there are a lot of Thai restaurants to visit. 

Secret Garden, thank you for the wonderful memory...but for us, it's ."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by a friend of mine. I was a little skeptical at first, because my wife likes good, flavorful food. 
I was very impressed with the flavor, the PORTIONING, and the price. They also have a nice wine selection.  The service was great and Leah is an excellent waitress. I will definitely bring my friends here."}
{"text":"Very expensive for so-so food. Try the tapas but avoid the crying tiger steak. $24 for a small unseasoned ribeye is outrageous."}
{"text":"I hate writing a bad review but my experience was unpleasant and I felt compelled to vent. 

First let me start off with the fact that it is New Year's Eve and the restaurant was packed and I placed a to go order.  

The food is expensive for what it is, the portions are small but it tasted good (not amazing) based on the reviews I was expecting the best Thai meal of my life.  The total was $78.95 for potstickers, Bouillabaisse, Cornish hen, Pad Thai, bread pudding and fried banana.  

I was told that my order would take 1 hour to be prepared but since this was my first time driving there I wanted to make sure I was there with enough time.  It only took me 7 minutes to get there - so here is the breakdown I placed my order at 5:51pm and I picked it up by 6:27pm hardly 1 hour.  

The place was packed,  and the place is very well decorated.  I must say I'm a little bummed that I won't be returning because I really think I would have enjoyed my dinning experience there.  But coming from the service industry mistakes are all about the recovery. 

Ok now on to the negatives, my chicken Pad Thai was missing I called them right away to let them know and they said I can come back pick it up.  At this point I just want to sit and eat so I called them back and said that I was going to eat my food first so it wouldn't get cold and I would call them when I'm on my way so they could re make it.  Ok so this where I think it just went down hill for me, my food was cold!!!  The portions are already small for the price but the being cold on top of it?!?!   The Bouillabaisse was tasty but cold, the Cornish hen was a  dry but tasty, the potstickers were a little  raw, the bread pudding was hard and the fried banana was soggy.  Just a really expensive bad meal. 

So recovery--  hardly I call to them and stated that I just wanted my money back, the girl who answered the phone said she would give me a credit since they messed up, I told her that I most likely won't be returning and that I would like my money returned to my card.  She said that there wasn't a manager available tonight and she would take my information down and someone would reach out to me in the next couple of days.  As I was asking her for the managers name she had already hung up on me.  I tried calling back twice but no one answered.  

So unfortunately I have to give this place 2 stars and I probably will never return.  I read so many things and so many friends have recommended it that it truly breaks my heart that I am the one who had a bad experience.

Update went back last night to get my refund and a manager never came to talk to me, they took my card gave me the refund and ushered me out, no apologies.  I know that one bad review will affect the place but hopefully this won't happen to anyone else."}
{"text":"Wow, wow and wow. It has been years since I've been impressed by a restaurant other than one other. This place really deserves 5 stars. Every dish we had was excellent. You can see from my other reviews I'm not so easy to please. 
They do an excellent job of taking spices and adding flavors that are new and delicious without over doing it. I can't wait to try other things on their menu. This trip we tried the spinach salad (what a shock it's so good), the chicken masaman, the eggplant curry, a noodle dish that was top notch and the Phucket poppers (the most disappointing and still excellent). 
If I had one complaint it's time to replace the chairs unless it's just the one I had. It was extremely uncomfortable. No reason to downgrade restaurant, just a note. A little cramped, but hey, what can you do. It's excellent food, popular and limited in size. I own a restaurant and hope that my customers enjoy my shop as much as I enjoyed this one. I can't say enough about it. Thank you for a great night out."}
{"text":"The absolutely best food and customer service! The mix of fusion foods and flavors are incredible... make a reservation, seating is limited. This is a hidden gem"}
{"text":"Great Great Great thai food. This place used to be a secret but seems like everyone knows about it now. You have to make a reservation or else good luck getting in. Drunken noodles, steak salad, pineapple fried rice, and deep fried spinach are all amazing. All of their food is amazing."}
{"text":"I was in the Summerlin neighborhood, and had this spot bookmarked, so thought I would give it a try!  I've read earlier reviews, and it looks like they have established themselves nicely now.  The interior is very upscale, which wine glasses and fancy wood furniture.  The dining area is small, but nicely designed.  Wine bottles are fancily displayed in wooden shelves behind the bar.  There is even a small outside dining area, which might be nice on a summer night.  The easy listening music would have touched my inner yuppie, if I had one.

I had no issues with the service.  I made a bit of small talk with one of the waitresses, and she explained that Nittaya's has only been open for two months.  My water was always full, and they asked me how my food was.  This also was the first Thai restaurant I've been to where the waitress folded my napkin over my lap.  I wasn't even with anyone!  Can't complain there. 

My order: Thai tea, Crab Wontons, and Curry catfish.  
Overall impression: descent, Americanized Thai.

Thai tea was average, very creamy, but not very flavorful.  I would go ahead and skip the Thai tea at Nittaya's.  The water though had fruit in it!  This is how my old stoming grounds, Thai Grill, does their water, and it makes for a very refreshing, slightly tangy drink.  

The Crab Wontons were a little bland on the inside.  They used some sort of either immitation crab, or low quality crab, mixed with cream cheese and a couple of herbs.  The fried shells were nice though, thick and well prepared.   They came with two sauces, a sweet sauce and a spicy one.  Both were good sauces, particularly the spicy one, and they made the crab wontons definitely more doable.  Overall though, I wasn't too impressed.  

The curry catfish was alright.. not great, not bad though.  The curry sauce was thick, and on the sweet side, but in this case that was ok because catfish is always a little better with sweetness to offset the \"dry\" catfish taste.  The portion was a little small for the $13 price tag.  The curry came with a nice change of pace though: baby bok choy.  This did give the curry a little bit of a unique taste, I and enjoyed it.  

Overall, due to the sweetness of the curry, and the not-so-thrilling crab wontons, I wouldn't go out of my way to eat at Nittaya's again over some of the better, more authentic Thai restaurants in Vegas (see my List), but it would be a good spot to bring a date or the parents maybe."}
{"text":"When we 1st got in it took like 5 mins before anybody acknowledged us although it was busy in this small space they had plenty of seating outside which was really a nice vibe. The service wasn't good at all the server lacked confidence and messed up the order and forgot to bring my friend his wine.  I love Thai food Tofu pad Thai is my favorite and compared to most places it was pretty GOOD but a little over priced. Overall I like the food and the decor was very chill just wish the service was better because If I'm spending $17 for a dish I would like the experience to be as good as the food. Also the infused water was really good was good and refreshing"}
{"text":"This is the best Thai food ever :) amazing service and great atmosphere. Definitely will be coming here again"}
{"text":"I can see what all the hype is about.

The restaurant has a nice cozy atmosphere, definitely a place to go with friends after work.

The staff was amazing. Everyone was so friendly and courteous, which can definitely go a long way to making a dining experience worthwhile. 

The food was good. It wasn't great, like some of the Thai places in Chinatown or Lotus, but it was definitely good. Nothing we had tasted bad.

We had the Thai beef jerky, the spinach salad (this, alone, would be 5 stars), crab fried rice, drunken noodles, and the Cornish hen.

What's great is that this is just off rampart and lake mead, so it's a lot closer than other Thai places. Will probably back again to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"Anyone who doesn't give them 5 stars is out of their mind. Seriously. This place rules. I am there at least once a week for lunch meetings and they consistently execute at a high level on every dish. 
My go-to is Red Chicken Curry. The sauce is so delicious and combined with the perfectly cooked rice makes quite a tasty bite. The chicken pad Thai is also the best I've ever had. 
Even if you're not into Thai, try them out."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to come to this restaurant since I moved to Vegas. I finally got to have dinner here last night, and it exceeded my expectations. Hands down the BEST Thai food in Vegas that I have tried. The restaurant is small, and cozy, nice ambiance, beautiful lounge music playing in the background tied everything together. The food was delicious, our service was great (our server, her name was boy, she was fantastic) and I will def be coming back again."}
{"text":"I'm so obsessed with papaya salad and had not found one to die for since I was in highschool in Oregon. I've been in Vegas two years now and just came across this place. I was happy to see they had the papaya salad on the menu (as many Thai places if been to don't) so I ordered it with sticky rice. You have to eat the salad with sticky rice, with your fingers....it's the only way in my opinion. Do it. It was perfect! The perfect amount of peanuts and spice. In love- so happy. I ordered the pad Thai, because---u just have to. And it was great- although I could only eat a few bites. Too stuffed from the salad. I am looking forward the trying the mango/coconut dessert and some curry dishes. When I first started eating Thai food those were the best...all I ever ate. So thankful to have found an authentic Thai place to eat. Ps- I just ordered take-out. The staff was super nice and it was ready right when I got there."}
{"text":"After a long day getting my home ready and a visit to the DMV, I was hungry but too lazy to cook for myself. I haven't had Thai food in a long time, and it turns out Nittaya's is less than 2 minutes from my house. So I drove there to get my grub on, only to find that Nittaya's is packed to the gills.

Fortunately, there was a spot at the bar that I was able to squeeze into, and had a good conversation with a Vietnam veteran that I had a lot in common with. Having been to Thailand, my favorite dish is a chicken massaman curry, so that is what I ordered. Plus, I got some chicken pot stickers to whet my appetite. I will say that the menu is quite large, and there is a whole lot to choose from.

The pot stickers were excellent. Slight crisp, juicy inside, and the soy dipping sauce made for a perfect bite.

Then came my curry. The portions were very generous, and included a big bowl of white rice. Everything tasted exactly as it should, and the curry was the right consistency and flavor. The only thing I could gripe about was that it was not spicy at all, and could have used some heat. Next time I was ask them to bring it. :)

Besides that, it's a bit on the pricey side for Thai food, but I enjoyed it and will come back for more."}
{"text":"I know this going to come off as Biased since I work here but I honestly mean what I say. I have worked here for 5 years and the food is so amazing that I have yet to get burnt out on eating it. The flavors are incredible and the menu is huge! I am not a fan or steak, onions, lamb, and duck typically, but Nittaya makes all of these in a way that I really enjoy. She is very talented and puts hard work into every dish! So it is for that reason I am going to give this place 5 stars and review it as if I were a guest that came here for 5 years!"}
{"text":"Very impressive food. A must for any Summerlin visitors craving Thai! Kai
Soi was great."}
{"text":"We come here regularly and we appreciate the consistency of good service and flavourful food. Wine pairing suggestions from our server and bartender were excellent. The garlic spare ribs were perfectly crunchy and flavored. The best salmon green curry in town and  flavorful lamb chops were simply delish."}
{"text":"I have high expectations when it comes to Thai food and how spicy it should be and this place is beyond amazing. You can order your dishes on a spice level from 1-5, I got soup and the catfish curry at a 4 and my scalp sweated, which is how I like it. Major thumbs up. Will always make this a must when I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"BEST. THAI. FOOD. IN. VEGAS! I've been to soooo many and am a tough critic with thai. I crave their fried spinach salad often and their curries are great, the drunken noodles are my FAVORITE!! Wish it were closer to my house, open more locations!"}
{"text":"By far the best Thai restaurant in all of Vegas. We are never disappointed whenever we go. It's a lot of fun trying different items on the menu."}
{"text":"All I can say is wow! I agree with the other reviews.  They did everything right the food was great so perfectly on the spot for taste flavor and seasonings. Half price bottles of wine on thursday with a great selection of fine wines."}
{"text":"Gently flavoured Thai food, not to much spicy also  with smooth of coconut pulp.
Good ingredients (I had seafood) but too persistent sweet sensation in any plate.
Service level fair.
Honest check."}
{"text":"Great curry dishes and atmosphere. I highly recommend the Thai donuts.  It is a bit small so you're cramped or you're \"more intimate\" which is either good or bad depending how you look at it. It didn't bother me that much."}
{"text":"Traditional Thai flavors with some modern culinary twists?  Hmmm?... could go very, very wrong.  But, the chef here blends it all together well. 

The biggest problem I have with this place is price.  $19 for a small serving of pad Thai?...steep!  Rent around this area must be a doozie. 

And sorry to say, but service  isn't always great.  

We tend to stay away from dishes that aren't anything special and that we can get elsewhere for much cheaper (like pad Thai).  

We do enjoy the Grilled Salmon-Avocado Curry
(in green curry with eggplant, avocado, & zucchini), Fried Spinach, Eggplant with Thai Basil, & Garlic-Basil Lamb Chop. 

Give it a try.  But expect to pay twice as much as you would at other Thai restaurants for small portions."}
{"text":"Had dinner at the bar. Although it took longer than expected to receive service, it was worth it. Great menu selection and friendly staff. Food was excellent. Look forward to going back as the menu has many great options."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Excellent ambiance. Excellent service. It reminded my husband and I of the best Thai food that we had while visiting San Francisco. I can eat here every week!"}
{"text":"Absolutely phenomenal! Excellent customer service and food quality. Tried the lightly battered spinach appetizer and lemongrass soup. Excellent! Will definitely be back next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Excellent and creative Thai food.  The Spinach Salad was excellent and I am a bit veggie-phobic. Everything tastes great and presented nicely.  Service is efficient and friendly.  Setting quite nice although a bit cramped in some tables. Overall a great choice in the area. Definitely a level above even the good local Thai places around Summerlin."}
{"text":"Really liked this place. Great flavors. Decent pricing for tapas. Amazing service! And the desert was beyond yummy. Had the creme brulee trio. Go! Soon!"}
{"text":"Amazing. Amazing. Amazing. Thanks Yelp! Just searched and saw amazing reviews and took a leap of faith & found a gem! 

An overall great experience from the moment we arrived. First off, this place is a very small restaurant. When we walked in they asked if we made reservations. Of course we didn't because we were first timers. But luckily there was seating outside and Mother Nature was being kind that day. 

Someone automatically brought out our Lemon & Cucumber infused water. Fancy? The best water I ever had in a restaurant. Did NOT taste like tap water like most restaurants. I pay attention to the waters! I can't stand when waters taste like unfiltered tap water. 

Our waitress, Devynn, was amazing. She gave us great suggestions on what to order. 

World Famous Spinach Salad $11- this is a tempura spinach salad with a lime dressing that has ground chicken, onion, cashews, and carrots. This is probably the most unique dish I have ever ate in my life. You can either toss the salad with the dressing OR eat it like chips and salsa. We went with the chips and salsa method so we didn't drown the spinach tempura. It is a MUST GET. They are famous for this! I ordered it and the beau finished it! Lol that's how delicious it was. 

Beef Jerky $8- bomb! It actually wasn't too jerky if that makes sense. You were able to chew it and not struggle. It came with a roasted chili sauce that added the right kick. 

Shrimp puffs $8- they were like wontons that had shrimp, cream cheese & curry mixed inside. This was probably my least favorite in the meal we ordered BUT still had a good taste to it. I honestly could not taste the shrimp.. 

Chicken Pad Thai $16- BEST PAD THAI in town, hands down. They have really good spices so we ordered it as a level 2 and oh wow it was amazing. Spicy but not too spicy. It was a large portion which was appreciated. The noodles were cooked perfect. Everything about this dish was perfect. 

The presentation of the dishes were beautiful too. They added an Orchid to each plate. How did they know that Orchids were my favorite!?

Highly recommend this place if you are in the summerlin area!"}
{"text":"Great food. The spinach salad is great. Price is a little on the high side."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Salad and dumplings come with lunch special.   Tasty ginger salad dressing!   Chicken with mixed vegetables is my favorite    Also love the curry."}
{"text":"Super good but expensive. I would give it 5 stars if it was a little less expensive. My go to for Thai is Basil Beef and Chicken Pad See Ew and Veggie Egg Rolls. I was not disappointed at all. Everything was great, hence the great reviews. I got my order to go so I didn't get the basque in the ambiance of the cute little setting and scenery that is so popular. The employees are extremely friendly. 

Everything here is great like I said before, just pretty expensive. I would just go across the street to Thai Style Noodle House and be just as happy for less money."}
{"text":"By far our favorite place in Vegas for Thai food. 
Incredible service, people and food of course is amazing. We 've been here few times and always enjoyed it. My wife is vegan and I am vegetarian so they altered their food as we requested and everything and every time tasted great."}
{"text":"When my book club suggested we try a new thai tapas place as the venue for our book discussion, my eyebrows shot up in excitement. Thai? Tapas? Two of my favs, together for the first time? The thought was blissful enough for me to trek it up to Summerlin for a taster (well, the intrigue of thai tapas and, of course, my fab book club!) Sadly, I was a bit disappointed.... but maybe it was because my expectations were set too high. 

The venue itself is a bit of a surprise... the dark, somewhat seductive decor and lighting are nice... but don't really spring to mind when you think thai tapas. 

Service was extremely slow, though the servers themselves (two servers kept trading responsibilities throughout the night) were very nice. 

The food itself was hit or miss. Hits: White Fish Cake (the dipping sauce was awesomeness), the mango coconut rice (the bomb), and a visit by the chef/owner to our table at the end of our meal. Misses: Papaya Salad (especially after tasting some of the other fantastic papaya salads that Vegas has to offer), Panko-crusted avocado, and crab wanton (oil factor was out of control).  We tried several other tapas which were MEH.  

To be fair, we went when this resto was only a few months old... so, maybe the kinks have been worked out since I dined there. I hope so because the concept itself gets 1 star!"}
{"text":"Horrible horrible horrible horrible service. I like to think that I'm pretty patient and understanding but even this tested my patience. We came in with high hopes driving all the way from south Las Vegas to eat here. When we entered we waited about three minutes then we were seated. This is where everything starts... We waited 5 - 7 minutes for the server or anyone and nothing then a group of 3 came after us and immediately got water. We still hadn't received water or even eye contact at this point. About 13  minutes later I had to flag down the Asian busser to take our order he said he would bring the waitress again we waited and nobody came out. When the waitress went to fill the group next to us water she finally noticed we were staring at her and she came to fill our water. I had to ask her if she would take our order. So finally after all that we ordered crispy pork, crispy spinach salad, and avocado curry.. The group who came after us and ordered after us got their food. Finally when our food came it was delicious and we ate everything. But we had to flag the waitress down for EVERYTHING! Water, sauces, extra rice. Like wtf? Not even once did they come up to us and check us and make sure we were okay. We basically had to beg them to help us. Then later I asked for the check because once again nobody came to check up after they took all our plates away. I asked a white waitress for the check, then a group was next to us and water was spilt all over my purse and the group who was reviving the water. I mean that's okay but I had to clean up the water after he spilt it. Yeah.. Not cool. After another fifteen minutes of waiting for our check we had to ask another person to get it. Then we had to wait another 15 min to get our check and finish everything. I was so done by then. You guys were lucky we left I tip I felt like walking out and not paying because this was the worst service I have ever received in my life. I will not recommend this place to anyone. Food is not worth the hassle."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Food service everything is on point. Try the spinach salad to die for!"}
{"text":"Good food! Great presentation and customer service! Will definitely return and try out their other dishes!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was clean and comfortable. The food presentation was beautiful.  And the taste was delicious!  We came in just before the dinner rush but the service was just as good, even when the restaurant filled up. The prices were reasonable and there were enough leftovers to enjoy the dinner again."}
{"text":"Another 5 star Thai place, in the desert!    This one is a small little place in Summerlin, but its stellar.   Great service, great food, some specialties here that are pretty yummy.   The fried shrimp with peppers is insane.  Pad Thai amazing, they have it down.  The other dishes are just sublime.  Get jiggy with it and check out Nittayas secrets....they are secret, and they work wonders for your thai loving tastebuds....mmmmm   5 star stuff here!"}
{"text":"Wow. That is some damn tasty Thai food. 

Loved the tofu pad thai (our group of four ordered two plates!). Loved the eggplant drunken noodle. The papaya salad was crispy and refreshing. Nothing was overly sweet, which I find a little annoying at other Thai restaurants. Nice restaurant decor, too. It's an intimate place, so noise isn't a huge factor, and it's definitely good for a romantic night out. 

I only wish I could've fit more food into my already overfilled stomach. I am definitely coming back on my next Vegas trip."}
{"text":"I ate there for the first time last week. Excellent service nice quiet place. Great lunch specials, food was delicious and quick. Friendly staff.Ill be returning again very soon."}
{"text":"why would you want to keep this place a secret???

Naittaya is completely amazing. i went with some family has we had a few appetizers then each got our own meal. the fried avocado was amazing. i could have had that and left and been completely happy. but it continued. they also had some bacon wrapped items, OMG, perfection. we also got lettuce wraps which were crisp and tasty. I ended up getting the FOB (fresh of the Boat) rice. it came in a pineapple and had cashew and pineapple piece. it was delicious. my uncle and cousin got some steak that was delicious. we also got some dessert as well, they have a couple choice for ice cream and the green tea was the best in my opinion. i left completely satisfied. hoping to go back very soon."}
{"text":"As its name implies,Nittaya's Secret Kitchen is located in an easy to pass strip mall on Rampart near Lake Mead.

Their expanded dining area makes seating more spacious now and easier to get up and move about. Service at Nittaya's has been consistent for me for years...regardless of whether it's lunch with friends, a romantic dinner for 2, or a gatherings of a large group of people.  

On my most recent visit we ordered Red curry chicken with brown rice (+$1) and stir fried mixed vegetables with white rice from the lunch special. There are 14 dishes on the lunch specials  menu to choose from and all come with both house salad and a pot sticker for $11...a very good deal for a clean establishment, with yummy food, in a nice setting. 

As soon as you sit down, they will bring you cold, infused water with fruits and herbs...today it was with strawberry and cucumber...or you can go ahead order a glass of wine from their nice selection of wine.

I always try to make a reservation, even if it's two of us since Nittaya's Secret Kitchen's secret is out and well loved by locals. 

I thought about 5 stars for this review, but for me, it's a strong 4 stars."}
{"text":"Great Thai food here. It's definitely on the pricey end for Thai food but it's worth the extra couple bucks. Not he most comfortable restaurant to dine in because it's a small space, but if that doesn't bother you dine in. Otherwise their carry out is spot on. They even put items on the side that are supposed to be crunchy instead of putting it in the liquid of a dish. I enjoy their attention to detail."}
{"text":"Ate at our favorite Thai spot last night. Food was really good. Flavor, texture, temperature, of everything was perfect. My wife loves their lime flavored Tiger Cry steak and I love the buttery yellow curry chicken. Kids like the chicken fried rice. Very attentive and friendly service. Atmosphere is great.  It is a little bit higher priced than some of our other favorite Thai restaurants, but in this case you get what you pay for. We always pull up thinking it's closed because of the lighting and the way the front wood door looks...  well done Nittaya!"}
{"text":"Although I love this place for its cute intimate decor, I think it's pricey. I've come twice now because friends love it. Ordered drunken noodles which wasn't bad. The pineapple fried rice was not good, too sweet for my taste. There's a basil pork dish that I really enjoyed, tasted like what I expect it to taste."}
{"text":"AMAZING food. We came for an early dinner, and were so delighted by everything we ordered. Spinach salad, without chicken, is crazy delicious. Mussels were gigantic and the coconut broth w/ basil was blissfully light and full of flavor. The squid salad outshines all Thai restaurants in the area. The soft-shell crab, with apple salad...dreamy!"}
{"text":"It's a small but very well decorated spot. The menu was easy to read and went into enough detail so we weren't stuck asking 100 questions. The wine list was also very good and impressive. We sat outside in the middle of October. It wasn't very chilly when we sat, but as the night went on... It became rather cold. We asked the server to put on the heat lamps, but they were out of propane. The food was delicious. They were able to modify certain items and make them vegan for me. Everything tasted wonderful. The food did take quite some time to come out, close to 45 min. Luckily it was worth the wait. I thought perhaps they forgot us, but apparently they were just slow or backed up. My dad said the lamb was the best he has ever had. The seating was comfortable and the staff was nice for the most part. The bathroom was also clean and nicely decorated. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Nittaya's is another one of my staples I have to hit when I'm in Vegas. It really is a secret kitchen - tucked into a small shopping complex in Summerlin, it's a great place for locals to sit down for an intimate Thai dinner. The restaurant is very small, with only 6 or so low tables, a long bar that can probably sit 6 as well, and two high tables. Because of it's size, I highly recommend making a reservation. 

Their decor is spectacular and they have had many different large paintings on their back wall, I assume they change it out when it's been sold(?). I think it adds a bit of excitement to dining there, that you will typically see some new art. I can't rave enough about how much I love the atmosphere and staff at Nittaya's. It great for a date night, or dining as a family since ever dish is large enough to share.  

The food here is phenomenal! I am yet to be disappointed with anything I've ordered. I usually stick to the Pad Thai, Massaman Curry, Potstickers and Rain Forest Fried Rice. The Pad Thai always comes out spicy even though I usually ask for it more mild, so watch out for that if you're not a fan of spice. Other than that, the other dishes are normally served more mild."}
{"text":"Updating on my Nittaya's Secret Kitchen! I got the Fried Tofu, Phucket Poppers and Tofu Curry as my dishes. 
While I don't normally EVER order Tofu, the Fried Tofu is amazing, but I wish the Poppers had more of a kick to them. They were supposed to be quite SPICY (it had 3 little jalapenos next to them on the menu indicating their spiciness), but they fell a bit short. The Tofu curry was good though, but it also wasn't the best I've ever had. 
Overall, I still love this place. Will be back again once I'm on that side of town."}
{"text":"What can I possibly say about Nittaya's? Yes, it's a hidden gem. Yes, the food is SO good that I want to stand up, jump up and down, and shout to the whole world. But more so than that, it is divine. The food is perfect, and this is no exaggeration. This is the best restaurant to open off Strip in years. Worthy of note, everything on the menu, but especially the Whitefish Cake, the Lamb Chops, and the Cream Puffs. Service is outstanding, friendly, and attentive. My water glass never reached the halfway mark, and we sat on the patio. All that is left to say now is don't walk, RUN as soon as possible to Nittaya's Secret Kitchen, which as soon as word gets out, will not be so secret anymore. ;)"}
{"text":"One of my favorite thai places in town. A little pricey, but perfect ambience for date night.  Thursday is half price bottle of wine night and I love getting different tapas. Try the spinach salad!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Who doesn't love 1/2 price bottles of wine on Thursday. It's hard to get a table on the weekends, be prepared to get rejected if you don't make a reservation. And they are precise about their timing, don't show up 15 minutes late cause they'll let the next reservation have it. Why? Because they work hard at delivering an amazing experience and awesome food. Services is perfect here. Salmon in the Green Curry sauce is a favorite of my family. They have a small wine selection, but they've chosen them well to pair with the food. You can taste the freshness and feel the love from the staff. Keep it up, you guys are all awesome!"}
{"text":"first time visit....small and quaint place on seats about 30-35..awesome for dating. ahi tuna was special, veggie spring rolls delicious, garlic fried rice oh so tasty. My love had the Bangkok fried rice and said it was good!! This spot was perfect except they need a tad bit of help w customer service. It was empty upon arrival. However, we were admonished for wanting to sit certain places because they were saving tables for \"reservations\".  Empty restaurant....paying customers on deck....no sit down...waiting for future customers...not cute.  That took away from their potential 5, but we will come back!  Fabulous presentation. So, give it a try for certain!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty amazing.  So far I have ordered from it twice (to go) and eaten at it once. I'm hoping to eat at it again (hint hint :-)) I absolutely love the spinach salad which to me is more like spinach tempura.  I also love the Tofu Masamam Curry - I am not a big tofu person but my sister is and so I reluctantly tried this.  SO good! I have tried the Green Curry with Shrimp but it was too spicey for me (regardless I ate it but my mouth burned).  Their prices are a bit high but definitely worth it and I tend to be kind of frugal when I order food - but hey - this place is worth it.  Friendly enough staff (whenever I ordered my to gos, I chatted with the bartender) and pretty ambience - didn't take pics but it has a nice cozy feeling inside.   There is a main room with a bar then another room behind it that is bigger.  There is also wonderful art work around the restaurant by a local artist who's named I forgot (sorry) but he does beautiful and bright abstract paintings. Outdoor seating is available when the weather is nice - keep in mind that Nittaya's is in the middle of a parking lot but Nittaya's does a good job of having beautiful outdoor furniture with high surrounding bushes to distract you from that not too far places like Bank of America :-)"}
{"text":"The Thai food here was nothing special and I expected more for the inflated prices. I stuck with the two dishes I normally order when first trying out a Thai restaurant which is pad Thai and yellow curry. The pad Thai was solid but like most Thai restaurants the chicken was chewy and dry. I wanted a yellow curry but did not see it listed on the menu so I asked the gentleman serving us. He said the yellow curry is the Massaman curry. I have been to ample Thai restaurants and have never had a Massaman curry that is yellow in color. Another thing I did not understand is why brown rice substituted for white rice that comes with an entree is the same price as a side of brown rice. This policy does not make sense and the quality and taste of the food I have tried does not warrant the high prices."}
{"text":"To start the food was decent once I got it .

I went to the bar to order it to go I proceeded to wait approximately 5 to 10 minutes for someone to acknowledge me. I placed my order and after waiting for 45 minutes I asked the bartender how much longer would it be he said he will go back and check he later came back and said that they were just about to make my food after 45 minutes either he forgot to put the order in or they purposely put my order at the bottom of list. 

As there was a couple next to me that ordered shortly before me but receive their food and was packing up there to go bag and paying to get ready to leave.

 Overall the customer service there was very poor I would not be visiting this establishment again I had better food with faster service in the Las Vegas area then to drive all the way to Summerlin for poor customer service"}
{"text":"This is hands down the BEST Thai restaurant in town! The firecracker shrimp & spinach salad are amazing !!"}
{"text":"I'm very disappointed. I drove here 40 min this evening in 5 o'clock traffic to find out when arriving they don't have high chairs at all ! Don't plan on dining here if you have a child ! Who needs to sit in a high chair ? What day in age is this ?"}
{"text":"Have eaten here several times and everyone I bring absolutely loves it. Admittedly, restaurant is small and sometimes passing between tables is concerning, but staff is very friendly and caring.  Food plated in an absolutely stunning manner, with beautiful use of orchids and leaves.  

There are wine and sagria specials available, as well as Happy Hour.  Outdoor seating can be nice during the spring and summer seasons.

Eating tapas style is our favorite.  The pace of the meal is excellent and everything is flavorful and tasty.   Go to the restaurant's website to learn more."}
{"text":"So I walk in guy server walks right by me, no greeting. Lady comes to seat me because I'm waiting so long. I'm seated and waiting, another woman comes tonoffer me water with an apology. My server went to two other tables still no greeting. In fact he crosses my table to one that got to the restaurant way after me. He goes in the kitchen, back out and takes my order . Smh

The restaurant wasn't that busy, only like 5 tables filled, sooo

My food finally comes out, only for the server to take it to the wrong table  Seriously, I am writing this stuff as it happens. I can't make this stuff up.

My check comes, yep you guessed it, the guy server tells me he put in yhe incorrect server number so I will be charged twice! But dont worry because it will just fall off Let's get the service together, acknowledge your patrons."}
{"text":"Have I written about how expensive they are?  If not, you can go to any other Thai place in the valley and get double of what you will get here.  Check your Ferrari at the door."}
{"text":"I am completely enamored with this hidden jewel. It is the most contemporary quaint restaurant I have seen in Vegas. The restaurant holds about 9 tables and a tiny bar. You almost have to disturb fellow patrons when you are being seated to your table. The decor is very cute and they have art work on the walls that can be purchased. 

But, enough about the ambience. The food. Where do I even begin. The favors. The presentation. The aroma. It's all on point. This place definitely delivers a great experience. We ordered the Volcano Shrimp, Drunken Noodle, and the FOB Rice. The Volcano Shrimp was fried shrimp with Serrano peppers and a delicious sweet sauce. The shrimp arrive to your table on fire. Such a cute and fun presentation. The Drunken Noodles were noodle with chicken and basil. This dish has just the right amount of spice to it. Lastly, the FOB Rice was similar to fried rice but it had pineapple and cashews. I have always wanted to try this but thought that the cashews AND pineapple would throw everything off. Man, was I wrong. The presentation of this dish was absorbable! The rices was placed in the shell of a pineapple. For dessert we had the bread pudding. Simply delicious!"}
{"text":"Interesting menu and tasty, but has small portions that are overpriced. No exaggeration."}
{"text":"I had eaten here years ago and was honestly not impressed but I was convinced to give it one more try and I'm so glad I did!  Everything was cooked and seasoned  to perfection. The one down side is that it's pricier than most other Thai restaurants BUT you're paying for the atmosphere so it makes it worth it. It's quiet and relaxing in this restaurant, something most other Thai places aren't. On top of that the servers are friendly and helpful. I will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Cute mellow date night type of scene. Food was great and the Plum wine is a must have!"}
{"text":"The food is awesome and a great place to both casual dine and have a classy get together. Their far and away best dish is there Kao Soi. It's just as good reheated in the microwave as it is there- delicious chunks of pork marinated in a beautiful sauce. Also, their charred shishito peppers are so cool and fun. The peppers are like a little lottery system - there's a small chance you might get a super spicy one! They're addictive and delicious. Their Thai donuts are also quite good. Overall, this restaurant is great for almost every occasion with delicious choices for appetizers, entrees, and desserts."}
{"text":"A group of us decided to try Nattaya's for Happy Hour. We found upon arrival that the Happy Hour menu for restricted to the bar seating. Since sitting at the bar is not conducive to group conversation we decided on table seating. 

The dining room is small and cozy. Seating is very comfortable. The walls are nicely decorated with art. The room was very conversation friendly. 

The menu has many choices of tapas as well as full size entrees.  Our server Josh was helpful in explaining the choices as well as his personal favorites.
We started with several tapas: 
Chicken Satay with a peanut sauce
Garlic Edamame which was a larger portion
Secret Stickers served with a side cup of soy sauce
Volcano Shrimp served in a bowl of sauce with sliced jalapeños

The entrée was Basil Chicken which was served in a platter along with a large bowl of rice. Also a large House salad with mixed greens, cucumber and onions.

All of the choices were perfectly prepared and had great flavor. 

The wine prices are a little high but on Thursdays bottles are half priced and is the way to go."}
{"text":"So disappointed, this was my second visit, the first time was great. This time the food was cold and the noodles in the pad Thai weren't cooked enough and we're almost crunchy. Two entrees and a pot of tea: over $50, so not worth it."}
{"text":"My fiancee, Amy and I have been coming to Nittaya for a long time because the food is outstanding!! However, tonight was even more special because of the absolutely outstanding service we received!! Our server, Zack (sorry if I misspelled) was outstanding!! He was very attentive to our needs and was always there to assist us. We told him at the table and I will say it again here that he is the best server we have ever had at Nittaya. Everyone should DEFINITELY request Zack!!

Also, we definitely have to thank Josh who works behind the bar. Like Zack, he was also very attentive and checked to make sure we were enjoying our wine and our experience. Josh and Zack are both extremely nice and humble guys who really cared to make sure we had an awesome experience!! I have to say that Amy and I visit a lot of restaurants and the service we had tonight is some of the BEST WE HAVE EVER HAD!! Thank you so much to Zack and Josh for a job well done. You both are amazing at what you do! Oh, and I also have to shout out Gus because he did a great job, too!! BRAVO!!!!"}
{"text":"Was looking at apartments in the area and stumbled upon this little gem. 
When i first walked in, my initial thought was... \"ah man... just another mediocre americanized/fusion thai place\" but boy was I wrong. 

The pad thai here was great. It had lots of flavor and had good sizable portions. The green curry was a bit more on the bland side but the chicken in the curry was juicy and tender. I would skip the curry next time and stick with the pad thai. 

The service was great and there was at least 2 or 3 waitresses making sure we were good at all times. Most of the people here were a part of the older crowd with a few young people sprinkled in. 

All in all, a nice little restaurant to stop by for a date or if you are showing people around. I happened to be lucky and was able to snag a table before the dinner rush, but I would suggest making reservations beforehand."}
{"text":"Love this little quiet spot!!!! Tapas/appetizers are boss!!! Definitely one of our favorite \"date night\" spots. World famous spinach salad the best! Thai wings... Yum... Lemongrass soup...heaven... Coconut ice cream... Hit the spot Service is perfect.... Amazing job Nittaya!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat at!  I have loved all of the dishes I have tried and their red sangria is amazing!  Not too sweet and just perfect.  I would recommend to anyone that likes Thai food!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing!! I would order stuff with the intent in sharing. The food portions are very generous. You have to order the fried spinach and the off the boat rice!"}
{"text":"Liked it. 

Super small place. Sat at the bar (didn't make reservations). Overall service was good. Food was great. Didn't really care for the Thai chicken wings but the mussels were delicious. 

What we had
Thai chicken wings
Mussels
Ahi tuna
Bacon wrapped shrimp

Over all good. I will be back. Bedtime with a reservation. Lol."}
{"text":"Nittaya's is very good, but with Thai food price is very important to me.  I don't think any dish should ever be more than $12 unless there's crab or duck or some expensive protein in there.  You can find outstanding Thai food in Chinatown or Eastside for less than $20 for a full meal.  At Nittaya's you struggle to find an item on the menu for less than $20.  Even the salads are almost $15.  

Now that I got the price issue out of the way, I'll say that the venue is quite nice and romantic.  The staff is great and there is even a nice outdoor area.  The food was hit or miss for me. The chicken panang curry was outstanding.  But the bok choy wasn't even cut in the dish.  The chef just threw an entire piece of vegetable, root and all, into the dish so we had to cut it ourselves.  The dish could also have been better with more veggies and less chicken in my opinion, but it was tasty nonetheless.  The papaya salad was a nice dish and had a good kick.  The drunken noodles with chicken were fresh.  The chicken had a nice larb taste to it and the noodles were slimy as I like them.

I don't think I'll be back.  Way too expensive when I can go to Chada, Arawan, Lotus, etc. and get a better quality meal for 2/3 of the price."}
{"text":"This place is dope af.  Im stuck on the avocado skirt steak curry, that gets the 5 stars all on its own. The crying tiger app was great also.  Have had the bacon wrapped shrimp, chili lime squid (?) and pork belly. Those were good but nothing crazy.  Try the first two dishes i mentioned and youll be set.

Reservations for dinner time, small place."}
{"text":"A Thai friend and I decided to try this joint out since it received such good reviews.  We went at around 5 pm expecting the dinner crowd but to our surprise there were only 7 people total in this place.  

This place is so small that the person sitting the farthest away can hear your conversation.  If you have any form of Claustrophobia, please stay away.  The decor is very dark, but suitable for a wine/beer bar.   This may be considered \"hole in the wall\", but its nothing close to that description.  Its located at Rampart & Lake Mead which has huge plazas at all four corners and a lot of traffic.

The wait staff was 2 young White males who had the attitudes of, \"what time is it, and when can I go home?\"  But what can u expect from kids who have no idea what customer service is about.  The other was a young Asian female who took our order.  She was very nice, but the language barrier came into play when asking questions.

The Food:

We had to try this \"famous\" spinach salad.  Ummm people, its fried battered spinach with a salsa sauce that tastes like the dressing for papaya salad.  Only in 'Merica can we take something healthy and ruin it.  Think of potato chips and dip people, there is no \"Salad\". 
 

My entree was Green Curry, vegan.  I asked for more veggies since im not eating any expensive animal protein.  That was not the case or (language barrier).  It tasted like plastic and was basically a bowl of bamboo shoots.  There was only 7 little pieces of bell pepper in it.  Why am I paying 15$ for this again?  When I asked the waitress about it, she got very defensive/annoyed, and did not even try to see my point of view.  I also chose brown rice (which is an extra charge) but it was too mushy. (Used too much water cooking it).  

My friend's entree was pad-Z-U, vegan, which was just as bad.  Swamped in oil even after asking to use smallest amount of oil.  Very little veggies that had no flavor.  it was also too spicy for her, but then again they never asked.

They never asked us how spicy we wanted the dishes...wow seriously?

THEY ARE NOT VEGAN FRIENDLY!

We did find out Nittaya's Secret though!  Its called charging a fortune for low quality bastardized Thai food...and then retire and laugh at all you suckers!


The prices are just silly...I dont mind paying 15$ for green Curry if everything is organic, but for a small bowl of spicy plastic, no thanks.  I just wanna know why am I paying this price?

Oh the \"Tapas\" ripoff idea....yeah so their tapas (very small) portions are the same price as a normal size entree from any other asian foodie place.  There is no reason to pay these prices.

WARNING: Although we voiced our concerns to the waitress and we only ate a few bites of each item, they never offered to to remove them from the bill (other than the mushy brown rice) which tells me they are all about the dollar.  They just don't seem to care

Most other Thai takeout is way better than this place.  Quality of food, service, and price."}
{"text":"Met up here with some fellow brokers for a work lunch, and I love the place. I tried the Crying Tiger Rib-Eye steak, and I loved it! Meat was cooked more on the rare side (it's the only way to eat meat right?), and it was fantastic! I thought the prices may have been a little steep per quantity served, but perhaps maybe that's just me being a typical over-eating American.

Also, love how they decorated the place. Creativity always counts! I'll be back for sure. Next time I'll probably hang out at the bar and check out some of their cocktails. Until next time!"}
{"text":"The food here is AMAZING.  Haven't tried anything on the menu I didn't love.

Tiny but very pretty restaurant so I recommend getting a reservation.  But this place is all about the food.  Love, love, love, I go anytime possible.

And everyone must try the Spinach Salad.  It's not a salad - it's too much deliciousness to be a salad."}
{"text":"The love for Nittaya's is above and beyond. This quaint thai restaurant nestled in Summerlin is well worth the experience. The food, people, atmosphere, experience are superb. 

The spinach salad- NEXT LEVEL good.
The Avocado thai Salmon- dream worthy
Everything else- excellent. 

Keep up the great work Nittaya's!"}
{"text":"I came here a few months ago for a pick up order in the evening. The lad who took my order was nice and very helpful, as I was trying to make wise food choices for being a Nat noob. Upon his recommendations and my own inclinations, I ordered the bacon wrapped shrimp with mango sauce, red curry, and pad Thai (had to, it's my guiding light for Thai food judgement). Total: $43.24. Bam.

The space is cozy and intimate, and you can tell it's a local's spot. When I walked in at precisely 9.54 pm to pick up my order, there were 3 people seated away from each other at the bar area, chatting away. Very cool. It kind of reminded me of DW Bistro.

On to the fooood.

Bacon shrimp was not as awesome as I thought it would be. I couldn't taste the shrimp, but I certainly got the texture of chewy shelled animal. The bacon was good because bacon is always good. Mango sauce? Good not great, not particularly sweet. I was expecting a great flavor, something like a bacon wrapped date gives you. But this one was lacking in the flavor and texture department.

Pad Thai was very yummy. Great flavors, just enough heat, and plenty of chicken and egg to beef it up. I also appreciate that it didn't have that weird red dye color from the sauces most places use. Yay for quality ingredients!

The curry was overwhelmingly spicy. It overpowered the delicious coconut and spices underneath, of which I caught glimpses. It had a nice mix of bamboo shoots and red bell peppers. The jasmine rice it came with smelled divine and tasted great with the curry. No weird hard bits. They know how to make rice.

I would certainly go back."}
{"text":"Looks good, smells good, tastes good! We had the full experience here and everything from the water to the wine to the starters to the entrees was wonderful. Will be back!"}
{"text":"We were in town visiting friends and looking for an amazing Thai restaurant and this hit the spot dead on!

This place was delicious. All the appetizers to main courses had delicious flavors and had the right amount of spice.

The service was great as well. They continued to check on us and asked if we needed anything which is what I expect from any type of customer service. We will definitely come back the next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've ever had; and I eat Thai food almost every day. Their Secret Stickers are amazing. I'm obsessed with the Avocado Salmon Curry and Pineapple Fried Rice. Soooo good. I crave it all the time and my mouth is watering writing this."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, crab wontons and shrimp wrapped bacon on the tapas menu are delisious! Drinks also, one of the best neighborhood happy hours. Bartender is friendly and on the ball serving drinks and some awesome cucumber-lemon water!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing. Decor and atmosphere are very fun. The waitress was very helpful in us picking a wine we like and even brought us some samples! The appetizers were great and the salmon avocado green curry is to die for!!!"}
{"text":"We always love this place!!!
It's a small and cozy environment and the food is fresh and delicious!!"}
{"text":"Horrible !!!!! We Spent my birthday dinner at this establishment even made reservations AND they were informed before hand this was my birthday   . I WILL NEVER DINE HERE AGAIN ! When I presented a $25 dollar dining certificate from Restaurant.com ( it was purchased a few years back but clearly  states it never expires)  , they refused it and came back with a manager. The manager called it for lack of better words COUNTERFEIT! Called a crook on my birthday...  fabulous. The worst part is, my husband and I  have spent many a birthday and anniversary here and have even closed the place down drinking and eating 100 year old
Eggs ( Thai delicacy ) with the owner a few times in the past . This looks to be a case of a place growing too big to care about where they are from and their original customers . I understand policies change however , if you were involved with a 3rd party business during the years purchased it should still be valued. And if NOT something else should have been offered .. I asked if their was anything they could do and they denied ... I then said I wouldn't back and they didn't care. DISGUSTED. Happy birthday to me .  Angry !!"}
{"text":"Looking it up I thought it would be a lower-end Asian restaurant but Nittaya took me by surprise at how fancy they were.

The water they serve was infused with Strawberry and another fruit (can't remember). I could taste it a little in the first sip, but ultimately it's just iced water. Still, it was refreshing 

Half off bottles of wine on Thursday evenings; if I wasn't leaving the city that night I would've taken them up on it!

All the menu items sounded really good and authentic. Prices are slightly higher than normal but their lunch specials are really good deals (salad, a potsticker, and your entrée for only $11). After eating their lunch, I want to say their prices are justified. I guess I'll have to come back again to find out.

Service was also very good, water was refilled consistently and staff was very friendly.

I got the drunken noodles which came out with a small flower, cute. Flavor was solid, and meat was great. The chicken was minced into small bits, it was juicy and full of flavor; I almost thought it was pork! My only gripe is their spiciness is toned way down. I wanted it to be super spicy like many Thai dishes are so I bumped up the spiciness level to 4 (normally one). Unfortunately it was only a ~2 in terms of heat in my opinion. Besides that, this place was a terrific choice for a nice lunch."}
{"text":"Steak avocado curry amazing. Service was awesome and spinach salad amazing as well.  This place blows Lotus of Siam away!  You have to try this gem.  Probably get a reservation as the place is pretty small"}
{"text":"Food delicious and exquisite.  Very clean.  Service very cordial. Thumbs Up!!"}
{"text":"I hate to give only two stars but it's way over priced for the quality and quantity good you are getting. Plus the past two times we ordered to pick up. We ordered no heat & it's like they purposely made it extra spicey, so it was a huge waste of $$ past two times.
Bummer because this was a family favorite since the day she opened.
There is a great hole in the wall Thai place rampart/lake mead area by smiths!! Check it out!!"}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite restaurant in the Summerlin area bar none.  Nittaya's Thai food is exquisite.  The decor is lovely and the service is always good.  This was the first place I ever experienced dishes such green papaya salad, seafood prepared in a coconut husk, seafood madness or \"spinach salad.\"  I could never be satisfied at a run of a mill restaurant such as Archie's again.  Pad thai and yellow curry seem so boring now!"}
{"text":"Wow this place is amazing. It's a small hidden place located in Summerlin. It's so hard to find a delicious authentic Thai food, I love Thai food but most places I've been, I don't usually go back because they are not very clean. This place is just very clean, great fresh food and beautifully served. The detail is everything when they serve the meal. They are always very busy so make sure to make a reservation before going. (Not very cheap) If your a Thai food lover then it's a must try!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and friendly staff. If you're in this part of town and want Thai food, this is the place."}
{"text":"Quiet, small, intimate restaurant. Dishes were yummy, not disappointed.  They have a lunch special which is more than enough, but we wanted to try out other dishes, so I'm over stuffed."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner solo and enjoyed myself quite a bit (I am good company!)
The garlic rice was delicious. Very very tasty. I would absolutely get that again.
Very flavorful, and the rice was cooked perfectly. I also ordered the steak skewers. Eh, wasn't super impressed with them. The flavor was Ok, but I guess it was the cut of beef they used. 
Service was excellent. Menu seemed a touch pricey however, l will return to try some other stuff again."}
{"text":"Arawan has been my favorite Thai restaurant for a while but I think I have a new favorite.

We ordered:
Chicken Satay
Chicken pad thai
Mussels 
Garlic rice
Mango and sticky rice

We didn't leave anything on our plates lol. Everything was so amazing. My favorite thing was the garlic rice and it was paired perfectly with the mussels! The broth on the mussels was so good by itself.

I would come here again and again and again. The decor is cute, food is great, and the service was good."}
{"text":"I didn't think I'd find a massaman curry better than the one at Chada Thai. But, I did at Nittaya's Secret Kitchen. Located in a small strip mall on Rampart, this is definitely no secret. If you come on the weekend be prepared for a long wait. The interior is tiny with tables too close together and a bar area that has almost no separation from the dining room. The massaman curry ($16) is excellent, as is their \"World famous\" spinach salad ($11). Crispy, light tempura batter covers a heaping mound of spinach. Add the chicken  and lime dressing to it and it's unforgettable. For more subtle flavors, the coconut soup ($9) is the way to go with a thin, smooth broth bathing chunks of chicken, tomatoes and mushrooms.

If you can get a table, dining at this modern Thai place is worth the trip to the westside suburbs. It may not get the press that other popular Thai places get, but they are more than capable of challenging the heavy hitters in town for the title of best Thai restaurant."}
{"text":"Went to this place for lunch today and I am glad I did! This place is really a secret because it took me about 5-10 minutes of driving around the parking lot to find the place. The restaurant name is small so it is easy to miss, but place is located on the corner of the plaza with the dry cleaners. 

Upon walking in, I was impressed with the decor and atmosphere. This place has a more upscale feel to it compared to other Thai restaurants. Kind of reminds me of a winery (and they do have quite the selection of white and red wine!). 

I ended up ordering the massaman curry with chicken (I don't think you get to change the meat, but I didn't mind) which came with a small salad and one vegetable potsticker. The salad was really good because of the light dressing and the ingredients were a nice change from just the standard iceberg lettuce with carrots (they actually had cucumbers and some other veggies). The potsticker was really fresh and I really liked how the outer shell was crispy which gave a nice contrast to the contents. My curry was really good as well. The potatoes were fresh and had a strong flavor which I haven't really experienced in other restaurants. The chicken was nice and moist (not chewy like some other places) and the serving was pretty good considering the quality as well. I also ordered a glass of thai tea which was pretty good, but not the best that I've had.

Overall I would definitely recommend checking this place out. It has a nice, intimate atmosphere and the staff are really nice and attentive. Their water is also fancy! Today the water was infused with strawberry and some other fruit which I thought was pretty neat. I will be back to try some of the other dishes! 

FYI, the lunch specials are around $11 which is a couple of bucks more than other places, but it is worth it! Do it and treat yourself."}
{"text":"Visited for dinner on a Thurs night. We chose to sit outside, as the weather was nice. The restaurant is very small, but I didn't feel that the tables were too crowded. We ended up ordering about 8 different tapas, and they were all delicious! The one standout was the tempura spinach. I didn't even know there was such a thing! It was light, crunchy, delicious, and worked really well. I will be back."}
{"text":"Have been here twice. So good. The go to place if you want great Thai food and a great experience. Always super busy. Make reservations. A little pricey but quality and well worth it. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service, amazing place! Try the Spinach Salad, pad thai and Kai soi."}
{"text":"One of the best Thai restaurants you will ever find in Las Vegas,everything is good here and the owner and employers are very friendly and attentive to everything,the service is top!Just eat the young coconut curry my God so delicious.Thank you everyone I appreciate the great food and service :)"}
{"text":"It's a cute, cozy romantic place in my opinion. My boyfriend and I came here for lunch today. We saw this place last night when we were at the French restaurant nearby. We love tapas so he surprised me by taking me to this place today.

We had three small dishes: Golden Pouches that's potatoes inside an egg pastry with curry sauce, the potatoes was fresh and I like the curry sauce;  E-Saan Sausage which is pork sausage with lemongrass in it. I love the crispy pork belly. The pork belly was quite different the way they were prepared. It had a thicker breading but nonetheless they were so crispy and mouth watering.

The service was good. 
We also enjoyed the hot teas. They have a separate hot menu so don't forget to check it out. They also have happy hour from 3-6, and half priced select bottles on Thursdays.

The only drawback is the place is very small with tables so close next to each other. We could hear all the conversation to our dislike. Anyhow, we enjoyed our lunch and experience."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for lunch and got their chicken Pad Thai lunch special.  It came with a pot sticker, a small side salad with this fantastic vinaigrette, a nice size portion of Pad Thai.  I also had a glass of Riesling to round out my lunch.

While it was nice outside and they have patio seating I sat at the bar for lunch.  Service was quick and pleasant.  Before I even ordered the bar tender had poured me a glass of their strawberry and cucumber infused water.   My order was taken and he poured me a little carafe of the wine and then poured half into the glass leaving the rest next to the glass.  The dumpling came out first and was a nice start.  the salad came out next closely followed by the main dish.

The only complaint I had was that the Pad Thai had a little too much soy sauce in it but it was still good.  I can definitely see myself coming back and trying some of the tapas and some more wine."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem in Summerlin, seating is a little cramped but that's what gives it quirky appeal. The Thai cuisine was amazing, with a Asian fusion twist. 
 
A+on the cool 'secret door', love it!!!"}
{"text":"I just recently heard about this place and have been here once a week since. The first was with friends who recommended it, the second was with coworkers I recommended it to and the third was to pick up take out for my partner who has not eaten here yet. 

I am giving them 5 Stars not only for their delicious and incredibly flavorful food or the great atmosphere but specifically for their impeccable customer service. 

Tonight, after coming home and checking my take out order, I realized they had forgotten the dressing for the spinach salad (which I highly recommend). The dressing that comes with this salad is one of the best things on the menu and so I called to let them know it had been forgotten. I explained that it was a 40 minute drive round trip and coming back wasn't possible so this restaurant had one of their servers drive to my home to bring it to me! I have never experienced such a service! Thank you Nittaya's for making sure my order was right and going above and beyond. 

The drunken noodles, pad Thai, chicken satay, pineapple fried rice, chicken Panang, Thai donuts and mango sticky rice are all on my list of things you should try! 

I'll be returning soon!"}
{"text":"This was the first and most likely the last time I would visit this place..When we first walked in there wasn't a host stand, very few tables and extremely tight..The look we received from the 4 people that were there and from the staff was very unwelcoming just because we had two young ones with us..it's like they were all judging us just because we weren't dressed up all fancy and had kids..One of the staff finally came up to us and asked if we had reservations and we said no..they were able to seat us right away which was nice..The server came over and he was informative about the menu and seemed pretty chipper..the busser on the other hand was extremely rude..While pouring our waters, ice cubes and water was going all over the table..Our food was as follows:

Spinach salad - something different..it was pretty good and probably the only good thing we ordered
Chicken satay-4 skewers stabbed in a pineapple..very bland
Lamb chops - tender but way too heavy on the sauce
Tamarind shrimp - tasted nothing like tamarind..more like shrimp in fish sauce
Garlic rice - it was decent
Bread pudding - I don't thing it was made with bread at all..had more of a rice consistency,  too dense and no flavor..The homemade coconut ice cream was made with too much water..it wasn't creamy at all, more icy because there was too much crystallization. Also had a piece of hair but we just let it go

$100 for a couple of tapas, one small entree, and a dessert. I wish I could say it was worth it but it wasn't. To say that they're fine dining is a joke. I work in the hospitality industry at a 5 star resort on the strip and our cafe people has better standards and much better personalities than these people. To the arrogant busser who hit my hand while clearing the plates the I so neatly stacked for you just because you're too good to say a word to us like \"pardon my reach\" or anything along those lines, you suck! To all of the snooty people who give dirty looks when children are around: children are not a disease so please don't treat them like one..I'm sure each and every person was an annoying little child at some point in their life..Some even stay annoying in their old age..The only good thing I can say good about this place was the server faked being nice to us just enough to make me not flip out while there."}
{"text":"I had never even heard of this place until we were specifically looking for Thai food one night nearby. I was really pleasantly surprised by how cute and intimate the setting was and how delicious and diverse the food items were as well. They have a good selection of beer and wine and I found their prices to be affordable for a pretty nice restaurant. I think it would be a perfect date night spot or even just a place for a casual weekday dinner or drinks."}
{"text":"My wife and I found this place a few years ago and always make it a mandatory stop anytime we're in Vegas.  It's small without a lot of tables, but we've never had any problems getting in with large parties . . . even up to 11.  I don't have the menu in front of me, so I may get some of the names wrong, but these dishes are always on our list...chicken satay for the kids...they even love the peanut sauce.  Garlic rice and the pineapple rice.  The coconut soup is awesome and all the other chicken and beef dishes have never disappointed.  Hopefully the Secret Kitchen will always be a secret..."}
{"text":"Interesting decor , good foods. I enjoyed every dishes at the restaurant. But the only things that disappointed me was the coconut ice cream dessert. In the menu it say \" coconut ice cream for family \" so I thought it big or at least good for family like it said but it didn't . One plain coconut on the white plate ..if they just add  one flower on the coconut or an small Umbrella will make it look better. Little bit ice cream ( it's alright ) and sweet rice on the bottom ..it cost $13-$16 ( don't remember the price ) so OVER PRICE for just that. Everything else was perfect."}
{"text":"I love Thai food and I eat it a lot. I love Nittaya's. Service is friendly, food is absolutely amazing, and ambiance is nice and secluded. I would have never expected this place to be located in a Starbucks parking lot. Honestly addicted to their spicy garlic edamame! Love it here! By far my favorite Thai spot."}
{"text":"Food is excellent.   Service on most days is great.  However I came on a week where they sat us outside.   Service was horrible,  waiters rarely showed up, food was slow to get to our table and wrong order was given.   Servers was guessing which table ordered what.  It could be an off night or new employees.  Will come back maybe they can redeem themselves."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I needed a girl's night out. I had never been here but had read good reviews.  It was a small place with less then 15 tables and a bar area. There is a tapas menu as well as a dinner menu.  We arrived around 4:45pm on a Friday evening- they did ask if we had a reservation (we didn't) but they said they could seat us anyways. 

They wine menu is not large, but some well chosen bottles. They started us with a strawberry cucumber water- very unexpected and refreshing drink.  We ordered a bottle of wine and some tapas plates to try different things since everything sounded good. We ended up with the garlic edamame, secret dumplings, Phuket poppers and steak skewers.  The garlic edamame were phenomenal.  I foresee ordering these for takeout often!!  The steak was good- nothing to write home about and the dumplings and poppers were delicious.  The portions were good size for tapas, but we still decided we wanted something a little more. We ordered the Pad Z U (pad see eww) from the dinner menu. It was delicious as well.  

The edamame was reason alone to come back, but the dishes that others ordered look delicious as well.  Thrilled to have found this hidden gem of a restaurant and look forward to my next visit!!"}
{"text":"Nitayyas is one of our favorite places however, last night left much to be desired.  The person that waited on us did not present the service we are accustom to receiving at Nittaya's.  We did overhear him as he advised other patrons that he is the manager, if that was the case why was he semi-serving us?"}
{"text":"It was ok. I order the lunch red curry chicken and it was mostly bamboo strips. The pour of draft beer was mostly foam. Don't plan on going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Nattaya's never fails to be amazing.  Simply put, this is the best Thai food in Las Vegas!  My favorites are the spinach salad, crying tiger steak, avocado salmon.... and there is a special \"off-menu\" item that is made with clear noodles which may be the best thing at the entire restaurant.  Also, the soups and salads are amazing - particularly the lemongrass chicken soup.  Thursday's evenings are a bonus since wine bottles are 50% off!
And I'm not sure how below reviews say service is not outstanding; I've always received top-notch service at Nattaya's."}
{"text":"Great amostohere but kinda of dark.
Service is always on point.  Fresh infused water with fruit/herb every day
The avocado steak if AWESOME
The spinach salad is great but it's more like spinach tempura vs a salad, salad.
Spice level is only 1-5. So if you like super spicy you will be disappointed, but you can ask for the spice tray which has sambal, siracha, and cayenne pepper blend"}
{"text":"Great place! We come here frequently, it's pretty much our go to in mid/north Vegas. The service can be slow if they are min manned but generally it's great. I recommend calling on weekends to see if there is a wait, weekdays are best. Also get the spinach salad and tapas! All are absolutely excellent! The currys and entres are great too!"}
{"text":"Tapas were good, ambience great, i love the rustic/vintage theme of the restaurant. I just didnt like the Seafood Madness but i have yet to try their other main entrées. Im gonna bring my friends next time."}
{"text":"Sooooooo yummy!!!! 
Great vibes and atmosphere! Even better food, and I love the location. It's not to go for a nice a date, however it is on the smaller side so I wouldn't suggest large groups... 
but very very very good! 
They serve us fruit infused water to start, the famous spinach salad, 1 lamb entree and 1 salmon. Overall fantastic experience! And I will be returning!"}
{"text":"Amazing food great service,  and wine specials that are priced so well, you will buy the bottle."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I had an amazing meal at Nittaya's once again. We shared the Tempura Spinach and two wonderful entree's. The avocado ribeye and cashew shrimp. What a delicious combination to share and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"Just like their name, Nittaya's Secret Kitchen is a hidden restaurant that not a lot of people know about. I didn't know about this place for a long time until I found it on Yelp, probably because this part of town is not known to have a good selection of restaurants. My girlfriend and I were so impressed with the restaurant, we went back within a week. 
They serve fusion Thai cuisine. They have well-known Thai dishes like Pad Thai and some non-Thai dishes with their own twists. Either way, we enjoyed every dish that we ordered. Unlike a typical Thai restaurant, they pay a lot of attention on the food presentation too. Every dish comes out beautifully decorated. 
The service was awesome. Because it was our first time, we needed some help with ordering. Fortunately, the waitress was extremely helpful. She recommended some food with wine, and we literally like everything. She stopped by at our table a few time to make sure that we are good. It was a pleasant experience.
The restaurant is relatively small. It's better to make a reservation before you go. My reservation was at 6 P.M., and the restaurant was already almost fully occupied. The music is on the louder side, but not annoying at all. I don't think it's a good place to take kids because you have limited space for highchairs. It's a great place for a date though. 
You should definitely try Nittaya's Secret Kitchen!"}
{"text":"Came here to dinner with great friends and the food was awesome! Had appetizers, the spinach was great. Then had spicy basil, spicy catfish, Papaya salad and they were all amazing. If you're lucky enough to get a table you're going to live it."}
{"text":"This intimate location has become one of my favorites. The presentation and quality of the food is excellent. The bartender staff could be more personable but the overall environment is good."}
{"text":"Great tapas and great lunch specials.  This is a nice little hideaway with great ambiance and great food.  I recommend the lettuce wraps and the green curry with chicken."}
{"text":"The BF and I went here for date night last week and we had a great experience. This restaurant is located in our neighborhood and so we thought we would give it a try. The ambiance is well decorated, cozy and nice. Good for a dinner where you'd like to have conversation and not have to talk loudly. We had the deep fried spinach salad which lived up to the hype of being a signature dish here. We split that as an appetizer, and we ordered the Kow Soi noodle entree. Our server mentioned that the entrees are big, so that should be enough for the both of us. And she was right. This entree was HUGE! Prices were a little more than your average Thai place, but you get your money's worth. We were too full for dessert but the items looked great. 

The only area of improvement I would suggest is that in the main dining room there is a huge chalkboard mentioning happy hour, yet we were told it was only available in the bar area. I would suggest maybe not posting it in the dining room as we were confused as why it would be in there and not maybe featured near the bar area. Just my two cents. Happy hour ends at 6pm and when we asked at our table they mentioned it was over and only in the bar. (The time was 5:50pm). Again, just a preference to ensure a great dining experience. Other than that, it was really good and we can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"If there is any one cuisine that I would say I could be considered a reputable critic on, it would have to be Thai food.  My fiancé and I visit at least once a year and I lived there for a short time a couple years ago, while doing a scuba diving internship.  I've taken a coupe cooking classes  there as well, with a wonderful teacher named Miss Ya.  I'm very fond of a couple dishes that I learned during my first course, one is one of the spiciest dishes there is....PAPAYA SALAD!  And seems to be showing up on more and more on menus here in Vegas recently and the other is Massaman Curry, and we get both almost every time we eat Thai.  

After reading about this place in the Weekly and then reading the reviews on here, I've been wanting to go.  Two of my favs, Thai & Tapas, YEA!  Our first impression, like a few others have mentioned, is that the decor was a little off.  After careful consideration, we decided that we should offer to donate some of our Thai artwork, perhaps in exchange for some food, lol! 

Anyway, here's what we got:
Papaya salad- my fiancé even commented on it being quite authentic
Lemongrass soup- was pretty tasty, but I needed to spice it up some more with leftover papaya salad juice :-))
Massaman Curry- we both thought it was savory and had very good quality ingredients.  Although it could've been spicier and we were never asked what level of spiciness we wanted on anything.
Spinach Salad - I had to save the best for last even though we ate this before the curry.  It was simply AMAZING!  If you go here, you have to get this!  SERIOUSLY, this is not to be missed!    

Overall, the food was all pretty darn good and I will definitely call in orders, but the atmosphere is a little funky, however we'll see if we can't help change that :-).   

Oh yeah, I almost forgot, I LOVE the fact that they serve fruit infused water, nice touch!"}
{"text":"My #1 fav place! I know it's selfish and wrong of me to think about not telling people how great this little restaurant is, in fear of not getting a table, but that  would be so wrong of me.  So you should know that everything is great but I especially love the crispy spinach salad and the salmon with avocado sauce!"}
{"text":"So this is actually a nice little restaurant i would recommend to everyone I know especially knowing a lot of ppl that would of enjoyed the food but I'm not because I had a bad first impression and I wouldn't want what I experienced  to happen to anyone else especially since everyone I know goes out in big groups. Tonight I came with my family for dinner a group of 14 ppl , while everyone was already almost done eating I was the only one still waiting on my food as they brought me my food I asked them if i can take it to go  since everyone was already done . There apology was donuts I didn't even get to eat my food and they gave me donuts so basically I get donuts instead of my steak to eat . I'm not that type that expects things for free but my family thought that was really bad customer service and that they should have at least comped that one meal instead they came up to me a took the food back after it was packaged for me to take. When they were asked so what are you gonna do with the food they said \"well the owner will take it home \" when we asked to speak to her they said she wasn't gonna come out . All we really wanted was an explanation on why that even happened and to at least hear it from her but that's not what we got so I just hope that this doesn't happen to any else and they see this review as something to help them not make the same mistake ."}
{"text":"Very very delicious soft shell crab apple salad & amazing coconut shrimps!!! As for noodles, I loved their pad thai but their drunken noodle was okay (I'd like it a bit more spicy). But really, this place had a great servers & ambience, so I highly recommend this place to others!"}
{"text":"Great quality, flavor and presentation! A very cozy location.  It's must if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Found another hole-in-the-wall in town I like!

Came here for a work dinner, and was a bit surprised that it only had about 6 tables, very small. Intimate and contemporary ambiance with a nice fully stocked bar off to one side of the restaurant. We ordered an appetizer and 2 entrees and shared. The food was hands down Thai Fusion done right. The avocado curry was amazing, not something you will find in Thailand but nevertheless very delicious.

Our Thai waitress was very sweet and attentive, and so was the bartender who served our drinks. Our dinner came out to be a bit over $100 for 2 people."}
{"text":"One of the best Thai places in the world! The unique twist on some of those dishes leave your mouth full of confusion yet completely satisfied. The flavors, presentation, portions and service top notch! Next time I'm visiting Vegas I'll definitely find the time to grab drinks and delicious Thai Tapas."}
{"text":"A few weeks after our initial visit, we came back and ordered takeout. which took 30 min after placing our order, Food was still amazing and 2 dishes was plenty to share with 2-3 people and have leftovers.  The fact they do take out this quickly is a game changer. It wasn't too much more than ordering take-out from another place that focuses on take-out/delivery.  If you don't have the time to dine-in or want something catered, I would highly recommend trying take-out. It'd be hard to find quality this good at most take-out places."}
{"text":"This is Thai food elevated to the next level. When you enter, it doesn't really have a Thai look at all, but it is still great, authentic Thai food. What really makes this place different is that they serve tapas, which are what the real stars of the menu. You order a bunch of little things and you will still end up full. We got the Volcano shrimp, which come to you on fire, the Spinach salad, which is just tempura fried spinach with a life sauce, the garlic ribs, the Pineapple fried rice, which is served in a scooped out pineapple, the chicken satay, and the curry potato puffs. I also got the Thai iced tea, which I think is one of the best drinks in the world. All in all, the restaurant had a great interior, great food, friendly staff, and I will come again."}
{"text":"Wasn't really a fan of their food. The actual restaurant is cute but that's it. We went for lunch and I wasn't impressed. I ordered my soup spicy and it was so mild my baby ate it. My husband ordered the pad Thai and it seemed watered down. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"I don't really eat Thai food but this was my friends lunch pick & it was a great one! I had the Pad Thai chicken noodle lunch special. Came with a small salad & pot sticker. Salad was ok, the pot sticker was amazing! The pad Thai chicken noodles was really good! A little sweet.
Chicken well cooked. Very flavorful! I also tried my friends fried rice, yum! The service here was excellent.
Very attentive. I'd absolutely come back!"}
{"text":"Wish they had a LUNCH MENU!!! Would come all the time if it was more affordable to lunch here with my girlfriends"}
{"text":"We decided to get the heck off of the strip for our last evening meal.  Best decision ever made.

We found Nittaya's based on decent Yelp reviews, hubby's choice, and he hit it out of the ball park again. (so far, all of his out-of-town Yelp food picks have been winners so I suppose I'll keep him around!)

Bulletted thoughts:
-Super tiny space, fills up fast, definitely make reservations even if they are last minute.  We did and got two seats at the bar (we're not picky, we're there for the food!)
-Great service, even sitting at the bar

We Chose Tapas Plates All Around:
-Avocado fries---Yes
-Spinach Salad---Hell Yes
-Beef Jerky---super salty/umami chewy chunks of beef--do it for something different
-Mango Shrimp--Yes

-Coconut Sticky Rice Dessert had some of the freshest, softest most wonderful mango I've ever put in my mouth.  (Probably because I live in Buffalo NY and the only mangoes we ever see are hard-as-a-rock, funky, nasty, bitter things.) Hell-to-the-yes!!!

-A must-eat if you're into Thai.  We will recommend this to anyone traveling to LV who wants a taste of life outside of the strip (read: much more reasonably priced food done by someone whose not a rock-star celebrity chef who likely has no idea what's going on in their corporate kitchen)"}
{"text":"Thai is one of my favorite cuisines, this place did not disappoint. I'm not familiar with this area of town, and I had no idea Rampart was closed down to one lane, I had a 5pm reservation and I ended up being 45 minutes late and they were kind enough to still hold our table, I have an obsession with time, and I'm never late, being 45 minutes late to a reservation just about threw me over the edge. They were very understanding.

Onto the review. We started out with a pitcher of red sangria, not the best I've had, lacking some flavor, but the presentation was beautiful, topped with an orchid in each glass. There were so many appetizers that I felt compelled to try, but I settled on the Koh Samui Shrimp, only because I've been to Koh Samui, quite honestly that was the only reason, coconut shrimp usually doesn't do it for me, but this was actaully really good, I liked the dipping sauce. 

For my entree I ordered the young Coconut Curry, which was served inside a hollowed out coconut and served with the most amazng rice I think I've had. It was so light and fluffy, 5 stars alone just for the rice. My friend enjoyed her Tofu Pad Thai. 
For dessert, or as it's listed on the website, happy endings, we shared the Ginger/Lemongrass Creme Brulee, I'm a sucker for anything ginger and/or lemongrass, the flavors really came through. 

Yes you will pay a little more for the dishes here, you're not eating at Thai Food To-Go."}
{"text":"I love this place. Me and my wife are huge fans. It's a real small restaurant with a sheik ambiance. I love that the restrooms are really clean and decorated tranquil. But the food is what makes this place. We ALWAYS order the Spinach Salad. It's tempura spinach with some yummy Thai dipping sauce. It's a must. I also usually order a curry dish and a noodle dish. So far everything I've ordered is awesome. This is great place to take a date that you really want to impress. I recommend getting a reservation because it's a tiny restaurant. Also if you're into wine go on a Thursday, because it's 1/2 off wine night. This place is as good as it gets. Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"Nittaya's is a great date Thai restaurant with an upscale vibe. While the entrees are more expensive than your typical Thai place, the serving sizes are huge and more than enough to share between a group. 

Start off the meal with their famous spinach salad. As the parentheses on their menu implies, this is not really a salad, but delicious nonetheless. Spinach leaves are individually coated and battered in tempura and deep fried. It has a great spicy lime dressing dipping sauce that accompanies it. This dish is surprisingly large and filling, and probably should not be shared between only two people. 

For main courses, we shared the popular basil chicken, crabmeat fried rice, and drunken noodles. Of the three, I loved the crabmeat fried rice as it had a generous helping of real crabmeat. The drunken noodles also had ground chicken and basil, which made the order of basil chicken somewhat redundant. 

No meal is complete without a happy ending and the family style coconut ice cream is perfect to share. I love the house-made coconut ice cream, but the coconut sticky rice at the bottom became quite hard from the cold ice cream and I wasn't sure if that was the best use of sticky rice. But for coconut fans, you can't do better than coconut, on top of coconut, inside a coconut."}
{"text":"Not Lotus.
Not Komol.
But a nice addition to the Thai choices in town.
Decor is weird; sort of formal which does not suit the vibe.
And they charge $20 a bottle for corkage!
I do, however, love the name. It conjures up intrigue and exclusivity like the famous \"secret japanese steak house\" in Los Angeles.

I would go back, but it's a long drive and Lotus is just down the street."}
{"text":"Amazing Thai with a twist, great wines, went here twice over a weekend because the food was so good. Go early and book a table before you go if possible, this place is always humming and you could have a long wait if you don't. Also don't be shy, order a few dishes and try them all they are great and what you can't finish, box and take home, it tastes just as good the next day for lunch"}
{"text":"We love this place - both for sit down service and carry out. Tonight we had carry out (and we drive 25 minutes to pick up) and it was fabulous as always. 

We ordered the green chicken curry, glass noodle salad, fried avocados, pad thai, and chicken fried rice. So good. So good!"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews and menu online, my friend and I decided to try the restaurant. When we arrived and tried to order lunch, we were told that only dinner was served on the weekends. The dinners are almost double the lunch prices. This policy regarding dinners on the weekends was not mentioned anywhere on the website. Next, there was an issue on the price of substituting brown rice for white rice. The website said there was a $1.00 charge; the menu we were given stated there was a $2.00 charge; and then the waitress stated both those were incorrect. There is actually a $3.00 charge for the substitution. At that point, I was irritated, and we left. I think the restaurant needs to accurately state policies and prices, so there aren't surprises once seated at the establishment."}
{"text":"I've had a restaurant.com GC for this place for awhile, and my girlfriend and I finally gave it a shot tonight.  The place was a lot smaller than we had expected... it only had a few tables, and it was dimly lit.  The service was fantastic, though!  Our waitress Tatiana told us so much about the menu and about everything they do.

We tried to order the ahi tuna and another tapa, but they were out of those.  So we ended up getting the spinach salad, the minced shrimp puffs, and the shrimp pastry, as well as a dish of drunken noodles.  The shrimps dishes were OK, but not great.  The spinach salad was delicious!  No wonder this is their most popular item.  The drunken noodles was good, but the chicken wasn't in pieces and was kinda weird to me.

Overall, I was pleasantly surprised, and the service will probably get me back in through their doors.  Hopefully I can try their ahi tuna next time.  Mmmmm."}
{"text":"Amazing. Just go. Everything is delicious. My favorites have to be: Spinach Salad, Fried Avocado, Beef Jerky, Red Curry, Salmon Curry, and their sangria. Honestly, I have yet to have anything here that was less than excellent. Go now!"}
{"text":"Went here with a group of friends and we all had a really great time.  It was very tasty and there was a lot to choose from.  Also the day they went they had a deal where certain bottles of wine were half off so if you were cheap you could potentially get a bottle of wine for like 8 bucks which is always a nice deal.  

The food was very good and there was a lot to choose from.  We had an assortment of  a lot of different foods to choose from because we all ordered something different.  Nothing I had was bad so if you want some good thai food then I highly recommend coming here."}
{"text":"This was our first time. We had 3 people and chose to sit outside. Small seating area but nice when the weather is good. Our waiter was a nice, polite young man.  We ordered our drinks and placed an order for 4 small tapas. We waited, waited...watched people come after us, order, eat and leave and we still had NOTHING. Our waiter said our ticket was lost in the kitchen so it will be right out?? 48 minutes after placing our appetizer order we finally had something to nibble on. By this time the entire patio was empty and the staff began to clear the table cloths, etc. Not once did someone from management even stop by the table. We had to wait again to place an order for dinner. We ordered the Shrimp Pad Thai with a level of 3 of 5. It came out Zero of 5. Absolutely no spice at all. If we had a spice tray we could have tried to add some flavor.  After 2.5 hours it was a long process. The food should have been much better based on all the reviews.  

We will give this one more shot but they will need to seriously step it up. The food (will post pictures of each): Phuket Poppers: Jalepenos,  stuffed with cheese, breaded and cut in half. It has 6 but size pieces which equals 2.5 jalepenos for $9, 5 spice Ribs: ribs were spiced nice but were tough and not much meat at all. Presentation was nice. Would have preferred tender meat and more meat than bone. Larb Chicken Cups: romain lettuce leaves with chicken larb on top. Needed more lime, a few more slivers of red onion and the spice tray. Volcano Shrimp: bowl of butterflied shrimp, breaded in a bowl with sliced jalapeno slices that are presented on fire. Presentation was nice but only 4 shrimp and again not a lot of flavor. Yum baked shrimp ordered spice level 3. 5 shrimp served on a bed of romaine lettuce in a sauce. Forget the sauce. This came with the most flavor of any dish. Pad Thai shrimp: OMG this was just a bowl of super slimy noodles, NO and I mean NO flavor and 5 shrimp, few bean sprouts and tablespoon of crushed peanuts on the side. Two of us took two bites and told the third person they could have it. 

All three of us were just shocked and out evening. Again not once did the manager stop by our table. We weren't sure if our nice waiter had screwed up with our ticket or if management is just poor. But either way. The food we ordered should have been better all around. When we received our bill we would have thought they would have at least comped our Thai iced tea or something but Nothing at all.

We will try again and update pictures and review. Hoping for the best."}
{"text":"love the small space and the food is good too.  similar concept to raku on spring mountain.    we started with the crispy spinach.  it lived up to the hype and the peanut dipping sauce is a nice compliment.  we then had the glass noodle salad.  I didn't care for the texture of the noodles and the taste profile was too similar to the peanut dipping sauce.  for an entrée we ate the salmon with green curry and avocado.  i'm not a huge salmon or curry fan but the dish was really good.  the curry had a nice spice.  the avocado added nothing to the dish, nor was it very eye appealing.  for dessert we shared the sticky rice with mango.  it wasn't my choice and I really didn't care for it at all.  service was good and the beer was cold."}
{"text":"Came here with a girlfriend- her recommendation. Wow- impressed! It is charming and has an attractive dining room and good vibe. 
Food was presented beautifully and was delicious. Cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I like to start off with the coconut shrimp or the crab wontons!
my favorite dishes are the green/red curry, pad z ew, the slow braised pork noodle dish, and the eggplant shrimp!!!!!!!!!! seriously soon soon good. A little pricey compared to other places but super clean and authentic. I spent a couple months in Thailand and have to say this is pretty dang close!!!!"}
{"text":"The restaurant serves very small portions when it comes to the soups they have. The waiter said that it would feed two people and when my wife filled her small bowl up it was all gone. As far as the main course is concerned, mine was way too salty. The feel of the restaurant is nice in the inside, I just wish that they would have Windows that you can see out of. The whole thing is enclosed."}
{"text":"On the way back from DTLV, I stopped at Nittaya's for linner.  It was about 1 PM and during the time when the lunch specials were in effect.  $11 for a variety of lunch dishes that includes a pot sticker, and salad, and the dish of your choice from the list of noodle or rice dishes.

I opted for the green curry chicken with rice.  The menu had a notation that the dish was one of their spicy dishes--just what I wanted.  They did not ask for a hotness number I wanted such as a scale of 1-5 or 1-10.  It was made the way they make it.

First up, I was brought a pot sticker and a small salad.  The pot sticker was OK.  Nothing special and a bit soft on the bottom from the sauce on/under it negating the frying of the dumpling.  The salad was great with the flavor of rice wine vinegar being very prevalent.

The curry was very good and I was surprised that it had the zing it had.  Most places that indicate a dish is spicy with a small pepper or some other notation aren't really my spicy level--they're too mild.  This had a bit of zing. More would have been better but this was OK.

Service was good throughout.  I had never been here before, so when I walked in and saw the bar, I sat there because I was dinging solo.  It was only after my eyes got acclimated to the darkened interior that I realized there were two rooms.  It's quite a nice restaurant.

Service was very good.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the lunch special pricing at $11 is higher than other Asian restaurants doing lunch specials and I didn't see anything different about the quality of my lunch compared to other places I've been.

Nittaya's is worth another try for the evening menu.  There are some good sounding items I need to taste."}
{"text":"Amazing, love this place, one of the best restaurants in vegas, 
Try the salmon curry, delicious! !!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! Everything is so fresh and the flavors are unique with each bite. I would recommend the lettuce wraps and the Siamese egg rolls. Also , the island potato bites. The sauces are so flavorful that  they give you to dip your food in. The tapas are huge portions and over filled , which is great!  I saved room for the banana and chocolate crepe dessert..yes, it was yum.."}
{"text":"Be careful! Yelp says this is a 2 $$ restuarant, but its a 3 $$$!! Food was delicious, but my family had to share entrees because it was so expensive."}
{"text":"THEY DIDN'T HONOR MY YELP DEAL-BOO

My girlfriend Jesse and I stopped by Saturday night just for a cocktail. 

We ended up ordering the signature spinach leaves appetizer and some red curry shrimp. Spinach was greasy and shrimp was too spicy.

Service at the bar was very formal and attentive but the restaurant was quiet and everyone was on a date night.  So we probably didn't pick the best place to come and have a girl's night. 

When we were waiting for the check I decided to \"check in\" on Yelp.  I usually check in after I leave a place and I noticed there was a Yelp Deal. 

One free glass of Sangria with check in woo-hoo! Right?  WRONG!  Mr. Four-Seasons Bartender suddenly turned Motel 6 and wouldn't honor it.  (He's the blonde guy with glasses) He said I should have told him that when we first got there. Huh? Just for that, I won't be back.

UNACCEPTABLE!"}
{"text":"Finally made it in! It was worth the wait! 

I had tried to dine here previously but it was just too  busy. I did my due diligence and made a resi this time. The process was pleasant. 

Our reservation was respected and we were promptly seated. It was packed and service was notably slow. We were in no hurry so this was not an issue. I believe it was at least 30 mins before we even ordered apps. Plates were promptly cleared and water always filled so we were not abandoned but we barely saw our actual server. 

We had mussels, volcano shrimp, soft shell crab, and sausage. The mussels were life changingly good. The coconut broth was divine. They were perfectly tender and I literally ate remainder of the broth with a spoon. The sausage was pungent with lemongrass and very tasty. It was served in whole sausages but with all the fixings to make lettuce wraps. Yum. The shrimp were cooked nicely and tasty but nothing special. The soft shell crab was delightful. 

We had the signature fried spinach salad which was tasty and unique. 

We had the duck curry and avocado strip steak with green curry. I didn't dislike the duck but would not order it again. The combination of lychee, pineapple, tomato and curry ultimately did not work for me. I think warm pineapple freaks me out a little. The steak was phenomenal. The avocado, eggplant, zucchini and green curry were all perfect. The curry was the perfect thickness and texture. Absolutely delicious. 

We had a bottle of wine and our bill was just over $200 for 4 of us. We were uncomfortably full. My co diners had a dessert and a glass of dessert wine. I didn't partake. I would return tomorrow and order the mussels and steak and refuse to share. 

Go try this upscale yet affordable Thai treasure."}
{"text":"Last night we dined at Nittaya's.  The food was good but I did not leave \"in love\" as usual.  We started off with our usual-\"THE\" Spinach Salad.  The Spinach was light & crispy but the dressing seemed different-I can not exactly identify what was different.  I usually can not stop eating it but after 3 bites I was satisfied.  We also ordered the Fried avocado appetizer which was very tasty-the avocado was smooth and buttery and rich. 

I ordered the Beef Pad Z U (their spelling).  It just did not taste \"right\" to me (not bad, not horrible though).  My husband tasted it-thought the meat was chewy but declared it \"ok\".  We took it home.  He ordered the Duck Curry which he declared \"pretty good\".  One friend ordered the Salmon Curry which she liked.   Our other friend ordered the ribs which he loved.  

One con about this otherwise delightful place is the seating.  I am not a tiny person and have no one to blame but myself.  That said, the tables are so tightly placed as is the bar \"area\".  People generally will scootch their seat back and the people at the bar scootch their seat back.  Our party was already seated in the back and all avenues to get to our table were blocked with patrons having their seats back just a little BUT since the tables are so close together it was almost virtually impossible to get to our seat.  I noticed all of the very slender servers and staff having to turn sideways and such to get back and forth between the tables. (So of course my sizable ass was not getting through without a chair or something being moved).  After dinner we felt almost trapped at our table and did not feel comfortable trying to leave until the table behind us cleared.  

The service was wonderful as usual."}
{"text":"Such a romantic place! Small, intimate, and cozy. It was almost dream like. The prices are a little high for Thai food, but the portions are good sized and the presentation is beautiful. We had three of the small dishes: five spice ribs, secret stickers, and garlic rice. Each dish was very flavorful. The ribs were good sized and meaty and flavored with Chinese five spice. The secret stickers were much better than your average potsticker, stuffed with meat and spices, deep fried, and served with a delicious sauce. The garlic rice was buttery, redolent with the flavor of garlic, and a great taste of cilantro. I would have any of these dishes again. We went here on a whim and didn't expect it to be so pricey (the three small dishes were $27), but I would love to come back here for date night. They also have happy hour from 3-6, and half priced select bottles on Thursdays."}
{"text":"Good food, I liked it, very upscale. 

The service, however, does not even compare to a Podunk McDonalds. Service was extremely slow, do not come expecting a quick exit. Took 45 min after ordering to receive our meal. Took them 15 minutes to bring out a Pepsi. Seems like all the staff disappear into the kitchen and leave the lobby. Even the bar was unattended. I would not recommended this restaurant to any of my friends or family. 

The sad part is, there were maybe 10 tables full and one individual at the bar."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places and my husband and I always order the same things: mango grilled shrimp (normally I don't eat shrimp or bacon), chicken satay, and the chicken pad Thai.

I would give them five stars but although the service at the bar is always good, I think the restaurant is under staffed.  Nittaya - please hire more staff!  My second complaint is they don't offer any salads without meat.

I love the atmosphere - warm and cozy, kind of SF-isn"}
{"text":"Between 4 and 5 stars.  Everything was so spicy.  Great flavors.  Especially loved the fried avocado! yum yum yum.  I believe the owner was taking care of us and she was super friendly and had great suggestions for a Thai novice such as myself.  

Wine was half-priced on Thursdays and we took full advantage of this :) We stayed for hours, drinking and munching on the appetizers we split.  This is a small restaurant and it was packed.  There are apparently a lot of people in Summerlin who love this place and for good reason: It was delicious.  Beautiful lighting too.  Don't let the strip mall location fool you.  Great for a date spot or happy hour with the girls."}
{"text":"So, we drove from my house(east-side) to Nittaya's to take pictures since my BF is building their new website.  After about an hour there, we were starving so decided to stay and try out the food.
I'm going to start by saying that I have had Thai food plenty of times in SF but will admit that I am not an expert, although, I will say that Thai and Vietnamese share a lot of the same flavors and herbs.

Let's start with the atmosphere, it's very quaint and has a very mellow vibe.  White table cloths and lit candles- lovely place for locals to have a \"date night\" away from the kids.

The menu has Thai Tapas- smaller plates/appetizers that range from $4-$8 a plate as well as a good selection of entrees as well as a beer/wine/sake bar.  Wish I didn't have to work the next day otherwise I would've had a nice sake with dinner.

Okay- so we ordered a few different entrees/tapas.  Here's the low down:
Chicken Satay- nice and moist, slight char from grilling (which I like) and peanut sauce

Lemongrass soup-reminds me of hot and sour soup(which I love) but slightly salty. Normally I would eat it with white rice to balance out the saltiness, still still good nonetheless with great flavor

Spinach salad- the BOMB!! hello, not like a typical spinach salad!! The leaves are individually dipped in a tempura-like batter so is very light and comes with a ground chicken larb. It was SOO good! This dish alone would bring me back all the way to the other side of town for!

Green Curry with chicken-again, since I am not an Thai food expert, it was good but a little on the sweet side for me.  I usually have curry Indian style so am not used to the slightly sweet coconut flavor but the vegetables were perfectly cooked.

Combo Pad Thai-again, slightly sweet but nothing a few lime wedges and some sambal can't cure. 

We finished with the coconut sticky rice and sweet mango.  Loved the coconut sticky rice but wish it was a little more moist. Mango was perfect, sweet and ripe.

Overall, A+ for me, will definitely be back to try the other dishes on the menu!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food, and my man Bank is an excellent server.  The chili lime squid is superb. Love this place."}
{"text":"Looking for a fancy night out with some thai food? This is the place! When I walked in I was not expecting it to be super dim and so pretty. The workers there were super nice! We ordered quite a lot of food and shared it family style. We ordered pineapple fried rice, which came in a pineapple, papaya salad, green curry, catfish curry, and pad thai. The curry was probably my favorite just because it had the perfect amount of spice to it! Everything was super yummy, but each dish is a bit pricy."}
{"text":"Very good spinach salad.  
Wife thought was very romantic. 
Would go again ..










Like the fruit infused water too"}
{"text":"Epic!!! Tapas are incredible! I love them all! Spinach Salad is a must order. I think the Massaman Curry is the best Curry I have ever had. Also love the Green Steak Curry Avocado!

Everything is Incredible! I would fly from Roseville just to go to this restaurant. Best Ever!"}
{"text":"Fried spinach is delicious. 
Pad Thai, Drunken Noodles, and Seafood madness were excellent!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I have lived nearby for years and just tried this restaurant.  My wife and I came in for a late lunch and upon first impression of the interior of the place was it was tidy, quaint and pleasantly decorated.  The soft lighting brings you into an atmosphere private dining.

Many things sounded good to me but my wife is a vegetarian so she stayed away from the dishes that included meat.  I nearly ordered the FOB Rice (Fresh Off the Boat pineapple rice) - which after speaking to someone about the place later found out is awesome, but I decided to try the chicken satay and the cilantro beef skewers.  The Chicken Satay was very good while the beef as good, but nothing to write home about. 

My wife had a spinach salad that had tempura battered spinach and a citrus/cashew dressing sauce on the side.  I should point out that this dish normally comes with chicken but they told her she could elect to have it with tofu instead or without either entirely (which she elected).  I tried it and it was very interesting and tasty.  

We also ordered Garlic Edamame which was fantastic.  It had a great garlic flavor and they put in Serrano peppers as well in there which is a twist we had not tried before.

That waters served were infused with flower and strawberry very lightly- which gave it a hint of flavor and I had also ordered a Tropical Iced Tea which was great.

Overall, a very pleasant dining experience for about $20 for each of us.  I am definitely coming back."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai food restaurant has always been Kung Fu Thai, but now I have another favorite! I love their Angel Wings and their Pad Thai was cooked perfectly. Not too sweet and saucy, just right. They have a great lunch special variety for just $11. My boyfriend ordered green curry and that was good too. Can't wait to come back for dinner. I want to try the Avocado Steak Curry and the creme brûlée trio!"}
{"text":"How can I keep this restaurant secret but still write a review on Yelp about it?  OK, I'll pretend I didn't write this review if you pretend you didn't hear about it from me.  Deal?  

Let me just preface this by saying that I've been around my share of delicious Thai restaurants.  I mean, I'm from Hawaii, where we have an abundance of delicious Asian cuisine and Thai food restaurants galore.  With that said, I have to tell you that this place is a little gem.  Everything from the decor of the place where it has a nice, intimate setting yet plays pretty hip background music, to their furniture and coziness...just adds to the experience.  

I've had some dishes here that I have never had any any other Thai restaurant.  Sure they have your typical pad thai or Tom Yum Soup but the delicious tempura spinach salad was truly magical.  This place is definitely a place that I'd like to come back to again so I can try even more of their dishes.  

Shh...now go erase my review from your memory because I didn't write it.  ^_~"}
{"text":"Food was excellent. Service is friendly and fast. We ordered the spinach salad (a must try), pineapple fried rice, skirt steak with the avocado on top, loved it!!! The bread pudding was ok, but we were full! Great place would definitely come back."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and prices are very reasonable! One thing I noticed was the outstandingly friendly service from our server Leah. Thank you! We will be back"}
{"text":"I have long been a fan of Las Vegas' Lotus of Siam, often cited as the top Thai restaurant in the US. Years ago a friend recommended, Nittaya's Secret Kitchen... and I discovered the West Side's best kept secret.

Nittaya is located at Lake Mead and Rampart and is a west side local favorite. The decor is thoughtful and warm with wood and fabrics and an intimate even romantic feel. The restaurant feels small with two adjacent dining rooms and a wine bar.

The food is undeniably delicious with the usual variety of a top notch Thai restaurant. As good of Thai food as I have ever had, including Lotus and Thailand! While I dine here alone at the bar or as a couple often, I prefer going with a group so I can over order and get deeper in the menu.

My favorites are the citrus steak salad and the Kao Soi. The FOB pineapple rice is a great addition to any meal and the chicken dumplings are excellent. Actually, everything is delicious.

The service is warm and friendly, Josh has been there for years providing exceptional service. Thank you!

The wine list is decent, I highly recommend a bottle of Reisling to compliment your meal. Try the Schloss or Monchoff. Thursday, they have 1/2 off wine bottles."}
{"text":"The food was amazing!! Service was great.  We went in their for lunch and everyone loved every dish except the Tofu dish which they asked to be on a heat level of a 4 and it was not very hot.  I did not try that dish because it was not what I normally eat but there was 10 of us and I tried 8 of the dishes and they were amazing.  The spinach appetizer was fabulous.  It was like the best French fry you could imagine with a secret sauce that was out of this world.  When back in Vegas I would love to go back to this restaurant and try more dishes out.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. Very expensive but fresh and very very good. Best Thai food in Vegas."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for my take out!!! First off when I called to put in my order, the girl who took my order didn't ask once what level of heat I wanted on any of the entrees. Second she didn't give me my total, she just said our order should be ready in 15 minutes. When my mother and I arrived for our order. No one greeted us as we entered. I said I was there for a pick up the lady behind the bar went to get our take out. She came with a receipt and with her had out expecting the payment without even telling us our total until we asked. My mother handed her debt card. She returned with the receipt and didn't even say thank you for coming and just handed it like \"sign and go about your day\" with no words! 

The food was decent for Thai food. It is very overpriced for the amount of food. 

The service I expected for a place with such great reviews what totally unacceptable!"}
{"text":"ouch $8.00 for an order of edamame !! ouch highway robbery
other than that food was good."}
{"text":"This place was AMAZING. It's a hole in the wall for sure, very small but the food was so good. I don't think they do any take out or delivery, not that kind of place. Very much a fancy Thai place, maybe even fusion? Either way it was great, but don't expect greasy takeout style food (not that there's anything wrong with that). This is a white linen tablecloth kind of restaurant, without being snooty. Would probably be great for date night too!"}
{"text":"The best thai around! Love this little gem"}
{"text":"To start the water is strawberry and orange flavored, The vegetable egg rolls were fried to perfection with crisp vegetables inside accompanied by the right amount of spice, the House duck sauce was amazing ! I ordered the chicken pad see ew as my entree and the chicken was tender noodles were cooked to perfection and it was plated beautifully. i will surely be back"}
{"text":"This place has some of the best Thai food ever.  The restaurant is a little small and can get noisy when full, but the food is totally worth it.  I'd suggest trying all the appetizers so you can get an idea of how good it is.  The fried spinach plate is incredible, if you want a starter, that is the one.  I've tried about 60% of the entire menu and most of it was incredible.  The only dishes that were average were the short ribs and braised beef.  Some of the items come with a spicy sauce, but medium has a nice kick, not too hot.  They have a nice wine selection as well.
Enjoy!"}
{"text":"this place is phenomenal for a sit down Thai meal. the service was paced a little slower but it was a nice change from the hustle-you-out-the-door you can get at a lot of chains. would definitely suggest a reservation, we got lucky to find a table as walk-ins."}
{"text":"Food was very tasty. Large portions . Great value . Loved the decor . Small but VERY charming . Service was good until the end. We waited a long time for our check."}
{"text":"The edamame seems overpriced if you eat it as much as I do, but it's dressed up nicely here. 
YES to the avocado curry thingy. Sounds gross, I know, but just go with it. It's interesting. But I'm an avocado freak. I enjoyed their version of Drunken Noodles, and the Pad See Ew with chicken. 

It's a small and quant place and perfect for a date night or lunch date. Soft lighting and mood music."}
{"text":"Our first visit was on a weekend. It was good. Food was tasty and server (female) was attentive. On the second time, we went there on a Thursday. The restaurant was quite full. We waited to be seated, but servers went by without a word. 5 minutes later a bus boy finally acknowledged our presence and said he would seat us. Another 3 minutes went by and we were still standing there. We left, and we would not return to a place that could not provide the most basic service."}
{"text":"I've been to many Thai places in Vegas and this is by far the best. From appetizers to main course and desserts all have been exceptional. Clean and classy as well as more seating room then traditional Thai restaurants. Great wine and bottle specials. Plum wine is inexpensive and sweet great starter drink. And their infused water is so very refreshing on these hot vegas days! Nothing bad to say five stars all the way!!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch recently.  When I first walked in, the decor, music and ambiance got my attention - in a positive way.

The service was fast and excellent  - they even flavor the ice water with fresh citrus fruit. I don't know how they are able to make it so the pot stickers don't leave a thick greasy residue on your fingers but they succeed.  The basil eggplant had so many different and wonderful flavors that I almost forgot that I was having a vegetarian meal.

Overall great food, service, beautiful decor and you can tell that Nittaya put a lot of thought and care into the restaurant. Kudos!"}
{"text":"Ate in this place many times but noticed that they are not keeping the same quality. The food is expensive, but not enough food. Brought chicken green curry and there were no chicken. The same with the salmon. Last time I ate at this place for lunch, I got super sick. I still trying to feel better but my stomach and my belly hurts no stop. Not sure what was in that food that made me so sick. I will never go back there again."}
{"text":"There is no restaurant in Vegas that makes me happier than Nittaya's. From the intimate setting to the incredibly tasty dishes, they consistently hit it out of the park. If you like Thai food you have to try it. We go here for every major celebration that comes up and the spicy catfish and Thai donuts are a must have. Call ahead though, or you may not get a seat!"}
{"text":"I took my sister to Nittaya's Secret Kitchen for dinner.   Thursday is half price wine night, but we were already looking forward to their delicious fruity red Sangria.  We had the charred shishito peppers  - sweet, salty and delicious.  I had to have the spinach salad - the lime dipping sauce is a perfect compliment to the crispy tempura shrimp.  The coconut shrimp with mango pineapple was our third pick.  The shrimp were large, firm and flavorful.  Another great night at Nittaya's!"}
{"text":"OMG!!!! 

What happens when Thai food meet AMAZING? It's Nittaya's Hidden Kitchen.  This small local restaurant is a pleasant surprise!!"}
{"text":"I got the Shrimp Pad Thai. The shrimp was rubbery and didn't taste fresh at all.  Also, $20 dollars is overkill. 

I didn't know that this was a fancy sit down place.  They looked annoyed when I asked for something to go.  Overpriced food, extremely small, and full of Summerlin snobs.  I don't recommend going if you're a family or want to have an experience that was worth every buck you earn."}
{"text":"Love this place! Food has always been excellent and it's a great place for a date because the atmosphere is cozy and trendy. Make sure to get reservations on the weekend because it is very tiny and fills up quickly."}
{"text":"I ordered pad Thai with chicken and fried bananas and coconut ice cream to go. Will say that the food was 5 stars but the pad Thai portion was a little too small for $18"}
{"text":"OH MY GOSH. So happy I yelled nearby restaurants when I was bored! The food here is seriously amazing. Not like oh I think all Thai food is amazing. Like truly amazing. The spinach salad is the most ridiculous thing I've tasted could eat it all day! Penang curry was great! Papaya salad, coconut shrimp, crying tiger anything! Can't wait to go back!  One complaint is it's very busy usually. Be prepared to have a bit of chaos in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Great great place.. Must try tapas.. Spinach salad is spectacular..Although this place has the traditional thai dishes.. This place is has the tapas.. It's not a typical size tapas.. its more like appetizers, so 2 is more than enough.. They also have an fruit infused iced tea.. excellent service.. must try if you're in the area.."}
{"text":"We went here a few weeks ago, wanting Thai food and after reading the Yelp reviews deciding that this looked good.  Let's just say we were blown away.  We had the best server/bartender that was beyond helpful!  He helped us with recommendations and led us to a great meal.  We had the spinach \"salad\" which was amazing!  We also had the pineapple fried rice served in a pineapple boat and chicken pad thai!  Everything was beyond our expectations.  We cannot wait to return again with friends!"}
{"text":"Very authentic Thai food! The service was great and the food was delicious. The decor inside is very elegant, upscale, and Contemporary. My only thing is it's a bit pricy for the portion size. 

We ordered
Basil beef 5/5 stars
Pad see eww, chicken 4/5 stars
Potstickers 5/5 stars
Egg rolls 4/5 stars"}
{"text":"This should be kept a secret so that no one has the terrible food I had.  There are many great Thai places in Las Vegas and there is no need to eat here.  

The only plus is that the tiny dining room is cute.  Hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in.  

Firecracker prawns were deep fried breaded shrimp with some sauce drizzled on, really would a ramekin of sauce kill you?  Normally I am used to prawns in yummy egg roll wrappers. 

My husband sent back the drunken noddles because it had eggs, which we have never had in any Thai restaurant ever.  He then got a very unremarkable basil chicken which was had so much gristle he had to spit it out.  

My crab fried rice either had fake crab or really terrible crab. 

The only okay thing was the chicken satay we ordered for the children.  The water was infused with fruit, that wasn't bad. 

The presentation was all stick on a slice of pineapple.  Either figure out some new plating or serve it family style."}
{"text":"Had the take out for dinner tonight. Everything was delicious! We got the chicken potstickers, the chicken pad Thai, basil chicken and steak! Everything was great and the portions were larger than I expected. We had plenty of food leftover to enjoy tomorrow. I haven't experienced dining inside, but it's pretty small and intimate inside. Will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"I found this romantic and intimate gem via Yelp! I was reluctant to drive 30min to it given the abundance of food places in Vegas within 5min of any location. Well, this is a true GEM. The food was amazing - everything was fresh, prepared to perfection and served with great presentation. I loved the short ribs and the drunken noodles. I also had the lemon grass soup. This is not your typical Thai place. Every dish has an added detail that you would not find in single $ Thai places and there are plenty of unique dishes that add to the authenticity of this restaurant. I cannot wait to go there again.

I am always focused on the quality of the food and the level of services but there one more detail that makes this place superior. The interior is very well decorated and adds to the the experience of submerging you in Thai culture. It is just perfect. Perfect for lunch or dinner.

One thing to note is that the restaurant does not have high chairs. I would not call it child unfriendly but it sure made it hard to keep the kids from digging in all the yummy food.

Did I mention that the mango sticky rice is not to be missed?!"}
{"text":"Sooo delicious. Pretty expensive for thai food, but it's well worth it. The pineapple friend rice is delicious and served in the pineapple. The curries are delicious too. Honestly there isn't one thing on this menu I wouldn't eat. Love love love!"}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants I've eaten at in Las Vegas. The atmosphere is very nice, the service is attentive and quick, and the food is delicious. We got the tofu lettuce wraps, Siamese corn fritters, and fried avocado. All of it was great, but the tofu lettuce wraps in particular was incredible."}
{"text":"Some of the best Thai food in Vegas. We've eaten here many times and will continue to visit. Lunch yesterday was excellent as expected and the service was spot on attentive. The Secret Salad is fantastic (cue the dipping sauce... and one to go please:) as is much of there delicious & creative offerings."}
{"text":"Amazing amazing amazing. I highly recommend this place. It was so good. They have great inside and outside searing. I had the Massaman chicken. It's the best curry I've ever had. The service is a great and the food is outstanding. Go try it!"}
{"text":"Have you ever eaten at a place and loved it so much you didn't want to review it to prevent others from finding out of your little secret. In comes Nittaya's Secret Kitchen. This place is phenomenal and during every bite I knew I had to leave nothing but outstanding remarks. 

It's in a little corner barely visible from the street but when you walk through it's false door you enter a space that captures an atmosphere all it's own. 

For starters, I recommend the Lemongrass with shrimp soup. It it to die for. If this is the only thing they did well, I would keep coming back for it. However, that's far from the truth. Everything we had was fantastic. Truly a restaurant I hope to see expand. 

Kylie ordered the citrus steak salad. She wasn't in a spicy mood but thankfully, there are plenty of options for those who either lack the pallet or the tolerance for spicy foods. The steak came out perfectly cooked to medium rare next to this beautiful bed of salad with a citrus sauce along the bottom. Never too overpowering.

I've been in a seafood kick as of late. The polite staff recommended the seafood madness mix 3. Although, a huge fan of spicy food, I decided to not over do it the first time to keep the balance of the dish. A simple 3 on their 1-5 scale of spicy is sufficient to keep most happy. Out came a wonderful presentation of mussels, shrimp, and fish next to a flower and a plate of steamed white rice. Dig in because you won't want to share. 

On the drink side, they offer wine by the glass or the bottle. 

I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Lovely and tasty food. A bit pricey for dinner in this area, go for lunch instead. Fresh ingredients,  flavorful spices."}
{"text":"The food quality was good, not excellent. We did order pick up, I'm sure the ambiance of the place was great. Since we only ordered 2 entrees and it was $50+ Too expensive and not enough food."}
{"text":"Nittaya's Secret Kitchen won't be a secret much longer, as this tiny neighborhood gem in Summerlin has a lot of potential. Tucked back in a small strip center off Lake Mead and Rampart, it is a little tricky to find, but is worth the search. They describe themselves as a Thai tapas restaurant, implying there may be some fusion going on, but in actuality you can just expect a lot of Thai appetizers - really good Thai appetizers - and some traditional favorites. Most things on the menu taste healthy and clean, and there are plenty of vegetarian dishes. The tofu preparations here are better than most, and the eggplant dishes aren't heavily saturated with oil as they often can be.

You can't leave without ordering the unique Spinach Salad ($9). This isn't really a salad at all, but rather a mound of lightly tempura battered spinach leaves that serve as chips for a tangy 'dip' made from ground chicken, whole cashews, cilantro, carrots, and onions. The leaves are delicate, yet pack a crunch, and the spicy, sweet, loose dip is like a meat-fortified salsa. Sounds a little strange, but it's to die for. The Chicken Ginger Salad is similar to the Spinach Salad, except the spinach is replaced with iceberg lettuce, you get a lot more chicken, and you have the addition of tender julienne ginger ($9).

Skip on the 'Shrimp in Pastry.' Though tasty, and dramatically presented, there is no pastry to be found (just wonton wrappers). The shrimp are overwhelmed by the cream cheese, and the jalapeno and leek don't come through enough. It's also a culinary no-no to put inedible items on a plate, i.e. pineapple rind (see below). What the 'Shrimp in Pastry' lacked in cohesion of flavors, the 'Thai Bouillabaise' made up for, though the mucky color was off-putting. They also use frozen green lip New Zealand mussels, an ingredient I feel there is no excuse for in good places. Though I loved the broth, that was the break in the 'make-or-break' of the Bouillabaise for me.

I love that they have outdoor seating with views of the mountains in the distance, but the best kept part of Nittaya's secret is that you can get a $25 dining certificate on restaurant.com for as little as $1 when you sign up for their email list. Although I'm annoyed by their almost daily notifications, the discount codes are incredible and I save about 80% off their regular restaurant certificate prices on any given day. Plus, it encourages me to try new restaurants I otherwise wouldn't, even if I do defeat the purpose of the discount entirely by over ordering. If you go to Nattaya's make sure you visit restaurant.com beforehand, even if you don't have a code, because it will still save you $15 as a visitor.

Finally, go knowing that the service at Nittaya's is slow. Your food arrives promptly once you order, but everything else seems to take forever. The staff is friendly enough to compensate for this shortcoming, though it is worth taking into consideration if you are short on time or don't particularly like to linger. Hopefully this is just part of their opening pains."}
{"text":"This little place is beautiful, with just the right lighting to make it a special romantic hideaway. That also makes it a little difficult to read the price-gouging wine list, where a glass of Riesling goes for $12 for one brand and $10 for another. I think Nittaya has lost sight of the fact that this is a neighborhood restaurant nowhere the Strip. 

The waitress, whose English made her nearly impossible to understand, did a good high-pressure job of pushing the Tempura Spinach Salad appetizer, and we were glad she did. It was outstanding, though it's now $11, not the $9 previously reported.  Our party of four also ordered the Fried Avocado  appetizer and the Shrimp Patties, but the waitress brought the wrong shrimp appetizer, saying they had similar names.  She changed it cheerily.  The avocado was very good, but the shrimp patties were ordinary and greasy. 

For our main course, my husband and I shared a Chicken Musaman Curry, served with a side of jasmine rice. This was the only dish that didn't have an elegant presentation. It was good - not the best, but certainly not the worst Musaman I've had - but could have benefited from less sauce and more chicken. They didn't offer it with beef, which I like better. 

The other couple had much bigger appetites, ordering Salmon in an Avocado Curry, a Crab Fried Rice, and Catfish in an unidentifiable reddish sauce. She liked her salmon, he hated his catfish, and the fried rice was lukewarm. 

With visions of Yogurtland dancing in our heads, we bypassed dessert here. 

If we were to return, we'd probably order just from the appetizer/tapas menu. But then again, almost everything on that menu is either fried, stuffed with cream cheese, or both. We'd probably be best off leaving that kind of food for the younger set."}
{"text":"I wanted to go somewhere on St. Patrick's Day where I would least likely find beer chugging party goers. I just wanted to go somewhere that served Coconut Soup for my sore throat and some place very quiet because I also had a headache. I wasn't feeling too great as you can tell. When we stepped in it looked very cozy with the brown, gold and brick walls. The tables were draped in white it was very calming. 

I started off with the Coconut Soup it came in soup dish. The dish was a little shallow meaning that there was only one serving. I'm used to places like Thai Barbecue that serves it in a big silver server which comes with more than enough to take home. I was sick so I was hoping for more. I know that this is a Thai tapas place but my soup wasn't on the tapas menu so I thought it would be bigger. The soup still had a nice taste and the chicken pieces were not too big which was perfect. The only thing is I wish the soup was served hotter. 

My husband had the Citrus Steak Salad which had cucumbers, tomato, red onion and spicy lime dressing . That was really good and the meat was nice and tender. 

I tried the Grilled Mango Shrimp that was served with a Spicy Mango Sauce. I was afraid the dish might be too salty because of the bacon wrapped shrimp but it was a perfect balance of salty and sweet. It reminded me of the shrimp I used to order at Tom Ham's Light House in San Diego years ago! It was delicious! 

We also ordered some fried rice. It was good but I don't recommend taking it home because it doesn't taste good the next day . The rice is too mushy that it just doesn't keep well. 

My husband and I shared the Thai buttermilk donuts with Coconut Rum Caramel sauce . It was a sweet ending to a great meal."}
{"text":"Joy and Josh were amazing! The spinach tapas was a fabulous starter.  The lunch specials... Drunken noodle, chicken pad tai and basil chicken were all delish... Our team celebration was a huge success at our new find.  Thank you Yelp for leading us to our new yummy restaurant."}
{"text":"This truly is a hidden gem. We went for Valentine's Day dinner and would go back again and again.  The atmosphere was quiet and romantic.

The spinach salad was fantastic! I can appreciate the amount of time between appetizers and meal. We were given plenty of time to finish our appetizers before our meal came out. The menu was unique. This is first place that I have seen that offers curry avocado. 

The sangria looked amazing. It will be on my \"to order\" list."}
{"text":"Wow, what a wonderful surprise right in my neighborhood. This is such a charming and welcoming little restaurant. The atmosphere is so cozy, and the staff so friendly, I can't believe it took me so long to break away from my favorite Thai restaurant on Durango and give this place a try.
I know this echoes most all of the other reviews on Yelp for Nittaya's Secret Kitchen, but the \"Secret Spinach Salad\" is a must!!!! It is delicious, and now one of my favorite salads!
I also will highly recommend the Volcano Shrimp. The spices were fabulous!
The Short Rib Curry was a special, not on the regular menu, and very good. Just the right amount of spice to not overwhelm the flavor of the beef.
I will definitely be returning to Nittaya's very soon, gotta add this to the regular rotation!"}
{"text":"This is a beautiful little restaurant with delicious food! Everything our party ordered - including the vegan dishes my husband and I chose - was excellent. The servers were quite knowledgeable about what menu items are vegan, and were happy to find out for me when they didn't know. The food presentation was also lovely, though I'm used to less expensive restuarants, so the menu seemed a little pricey to me."}
{"text":"Food is delicious as always but waited one hour 23 minutes to get our food. When we inquired at an hour and fifteen they said the chef said it's coming. Acted like it was no big deal. An off-hand apology that wasn't convincing. For the price wen paid for dinner I expect more! 
Very disappointed tonight. Can't decide if it's worth coming back."}
{"text":"The food was very tasty and I was happy to find that when they advertised that the food was going to be a spicy it actually was! I ordered the spinach tempura salad as an appetizer which was wonderful, the dipping sauce was flavorful and sweet. As an entree I ordered the kao soi which was absolutely delicious! The pork shoulder was tender and flavorful and the curry was spicy and plentiful! My only complaint was flat is seemed that everything we ordered had some ingredient that was deep fried."}
{"text":"I live in Chicago now but used to go here often when I lived in Vegas. It's truly a hidden gem. Every time I come back to visit my parents, who still live in Vegas, the trip is not complete without an amazing meal at Nittaya's. Simply put, amazing."}
{"text":"Went here after this place was highly recommended, we ordered the following:
1. Duck curry with Lychee: good sauce so I enjoyed that but the duck was so hard. 
2. Coconut soup with noodle: Bad, it was sour
3. Pad Thai : Really good probably the best thing we ordered 
4. Bacon wrapped shrimp; it was decent too
5. Cashew shrimp: Ok, too much soy 
6. Chocolate mousse: average
7. Banana chocolate Bignet ; good
8. Coconut ice cream: good
9. Egg rolls: good
I probably would not return, hope this helps :)"}
{"text":"Wow. I've been here so many times in such a short time and it is my all-time favorite restaurant. The service is always amazing and the food is out of this world. I've tried many thai restaurants in Vegas and this has by far the best food. Try anything here, and you will not regret it! 
Everytime I come, I always make sure to order the chicken pad thai, crispy pork belly, and of course, the mango sticky rice. 
The chicken pad thai is very flavorful and it is bottom line AMAZING. The flavors really come alive once you squeeze the lemon on top. The noodles are always well cooked so there is a little chew to it. 
The crispy pork belly is a hit or a miss with the portions. The difference in sizes vary with a big difference depending on the chef. But regardless, it is soooo good. I usually don't like foods with a lot of fat, but my goodness.. It just melts in your mouth with that very light crispiness. The sauce that it comes with on the side complements it very well. It is a tangy spicy sauce. 
And my favorite... The MANGO WITH STICKY RICE! This place was the first place I've ever tried this dish. I will not eat this at any other place because my taste buds are spoiled!
When I went a couple weeks ago, there wasn't any mangos ripe yet because it's not the right season, so we got the deep fried banana and it was just as delicious. The outside of the banana is not your typical tempura; it's coconut shavings! It added a crispiness that's almost like a chip. The banana is also topped with coconut ice cream, which has actual coconut in it! I asked for a side of sticky rice and it paired well together with the banana and ice cream. 
Definitely recommend this place to anyone and everyone! Don't miss out on this gem!!!"}
{"text":"I just ate this place looks kinda small but i think i didn't really look at the other part of the restaurant i think We came at the end of happy hour literally minutes And was offered dinner was a little out of budget cause we only go out for lunch cause of the prices We let the server know that we were going to leave But then was offered a lunch menu which made us stay The service was really good  and nice But the main entree was real bland I had the same dish at another place and tasted exactly the same So maybe its just the type of food Or i should try something different"}
{"text":"Such a fun and different taste. I highly recommend a reservation as it is very small. Perfect for dates. Cilantro steak skewers are a must and literally the best curry puffs ever."}
{"text":"exceptional to say the least. very relaxing atmosphere. love it. be specific as to how spicy you like it. this is a keeper. janet s."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! We are regulars here and visit for a nice dinner or sometimes lunch. The food is so amazing, authentic, fresh and delicious! Service is usually great as well. You have to try papaya salad or the spinach salad. Everything on menu is delicious so you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"We originally booked for 7:30 but got a call that the table won't be ready until 7:45pm. When we got there at 7:42, we were told there will be another 20-25 minute wait. If that was the case, they could have just booked us at 8:15 instead of promising a table at exactly 7:45. The servers obviously didn't want to be there, they looked so miserable that empty plates were not cleared until you point them out to them. The lady who took the credit card payments also had some attitude problem (even if it was her fault), she charged the wrong amount for the credit cards. So we told her why was that the case? Instead of her being apologetic she raised her voice at us and even moving her arms about to make herself heard. I was a little uneasy when that happened since I've never had that kind of experience before especially from an establishment such as this. Overall the food was good, except that the curry was really dry and the sauce was like eating sea water. But other than that dish the catfish came out well. After such a long wait, we would have expected a really good service at least, but nothing, nada! Not even a good explanation. Don't know if I wanna come back and definitely not recommending this to peers. Too bad! It was our first and most probably our last time as well! Don't come here if you have hypertension, you're highly likely gonna get some serious issues! Ha ha!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Very good food! Service was fast and friendly and very attentive. Spinach salad is a must have!!! First time here and definitely won't be my last."}
{"text":"Never wrong! Always the right choice for an intimate dinner or a small group of friends. They changed the decor since I last visited but the food remains consistent and is a little celebration with each bite you take. If you do a little dance with the first (or every bite) it's okay and expected. Try, get addicted and return!"}
{"text":"Cute little spot about 20 - 30 minutes from the strip. 

The place is small, cozy, and very cute. Love the design.

The service is excellent. The menu extensive (including vegan options.)

We devoured everything thrown our way and I found myself eating stuff I'd normally never try.

The price was pretty nice considering how well we ate.

I highly suggest trying them battered spinach thingies (forgot the name). They are ridiculously good!"}
{"text":"delicious fancy Thai food at a slightly higher price point than traditional Thai fare. But great service, friendly staff, good wine selection (50% off bottles on Thursday!). The infused waters are a nice touch. Fried spinach \"salad\" and the avacado salmon are my fav dishes!"}
{"text":"Nittaya's was the perfect backdrop to a rendezvous with an old friend. The decor is quaint and quirky, the venue itself as small as the waiting area of a Cheesecake Factory. But these qualities were what made it a memorable experience to share an intimate gathering with.

We split an array of seafood-based tapas, as well as the tempura-style spinach, with white wines of our respective choosing. Their vino selection was so pleasing to the palate, and the bartender, an interactive treat of a host.

Left so satisfied, so full and so relaxed that I'm thinking about it a whole week later!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly very good food in a casual but almost upscale atmosphere. The food was plated nicely and brought out super hot (temperature), which I really appreciate.  I'm giving it 5 stars because the extra service I got. I forgot my credit card and called from the airport on the way back home to CA. They agreed to put it in the mail for me the next morning, which saves me the hassle of requesting a new corporate credit card. Thank you!"}
{"text":"We come here often. This is our favorite Thai place in town. Small and intimate. I suggest reservations. If you ask for Thai hot, you will get Thai hot. That's hotter than their 5 on the 1-5 scale. If you are really brave you can ask for it to be as hot as the employees get when she cooks for them."}
{"text":"Amazing place. Great green curry and their desserts are unreal. Highly suggest the green tea Crème brûlée."}
{"text":"Sometimes you miss the hidden gems in your own back yard.  Nestled in a small plaza on lake mead and rampart this restaurant offers a casual but intimate with a bistro style ambiance.

Menu items include tapas which are well priced and amazing flavor. The garlic edamame is wonderful with roasted garlic and Shoshito peppers.  The vegetable potstickers were also very good.

They serve cucumber water and have a superb wine list - with half price (select) wine on Thursdays! 

They have vegetarian options as well as great dinner entrees with meat and seafood made  with fresh ingredients and sauces.  Staff was all very friendly and attentive which made the Experience well worth the visit. Would definitely recommend it and will add to my list of regular places to dine!"}
{"text":"This neighborhood gem offers a great bounty of Thai favorites. I recommend the spinach salad if you've not tried it yet! If you enjoy spicy, the volcano shrimp also makes a great starter.
My favorite noodle dish is the drunken noodle. It's also known as pad kee mow. I substitute noodles for the chicken to give it the flavors I had while traveling in Thailand. The coconut curries are delicious and you can adjust your spice level to your liking."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic. Everything we had was prepared with great flavor, and presentation. The service was on top if its game too. I suggest trying everything especially their dessert. I love pad thai, and this place made a wonderful pad thai too. Will defiantly be back again."}
{"text":"Their curries are really tasty. I think they do a great job in keeping the authenticity. I really enjoyed the choice of wine and my favorite the pad kee mao.

Will definitely return here for some delicious Thai cuisine."}
{"text":"This recently opened Thai restaurant specializes in small plates though regular sized entrees are available.  We started off with the tempura spinach salad with ground chicken, shrimp and lime dressing (4.5 Forks) and white fish cake with lettuce, Thai spices and a sweet chili sauce (2 Forks).  Our second order was a stuffed chicken wing (4) and a crab cake in shell (3).  For dessert we enjoyed the housemade coconut ice cream (4)."}
{"text":"After many friends have recommended this place, my husband and I finally decided to come here for dinner earlier this week. The food was so good we came back today for take out. The drunken noodles are by far the best I've ever had. Switch out the chicken for shrimp. It's perfectly sautéed and tender, not rubbery. My husband ordered the rain forest fried rice, which was lightly flavored and full of veggies."}
{"text":"This place is so flipping awesome. In December, Ruben and I took our friends visiting from England based on a recommendation. I called for a table and all they had were four seats at the bar, which was more comfortable than we expected. It was a rounded corner, so it still allowed us to be facing each other and it was still intimate. We enjoyed everything we tried and the service was wonderful. Great atmosphere!

We tried the Lettuce Wraps, Fried Avocado, Curry Puffs, Esaan Sausage, World Famous Spinach Salad, Five Spice BBQ Ribs with Citrus-Ginger Glaze, Emerald Fried Rice, Calamari, Housemade Coconut Ice Cream, and Thai Donuts. My favorites were the EMERALD FRIED RICE (I mean, phenomenal), SPINACH SALAD (they'll warn you that it's not really a salad, but it really doesn't matter because the flavor of the lime dressing and the tempura spinach is amazing), ESAAN SAUSAGE (the flavors that they manage to pack in here is so great, you'll be wanting more than the three served), and CALAMARI (wonderful batter and delicious dipping sauce).

All of us truly enjoyed our meal and had so much fun with all the dishes. Because it's such a small space, definitely plan ahead and come with a large group to take advantage of trying a little of everything! They're very accommodating and I'm so happy we were able to dine with them. I can't wait to go back!

Edit (03/01/13): Ruben and I went back for a date night and made a reservation earlier in the day. We had a rocky start; they were really busy and since we were in the back, we felt ignored. No one even acknowledged us when we walked in the door, actually. It took a while and when I said we had a reservation, they just pointed to the table in the back. Once our order was taken, it was smooth sailing (well, it also started to die down from when we first arrived) and everyone was attentive throughout our meal. It's a hard restaurant to be in if you're claustrophobic because you're in extremely close quarters to EVERYONE seated around you. I didn't enjoy being sandwiched between two other parties and unfortunately, hearing their entire conversation. So although it's an intimate space, it's definitely not for an intimate evening. I will probably request the corner bar seating next time since we had a much nicer experience there.

The food was phenomenal again and that definitely solidified my love of Nittaya's. We ordered the same four dishes that stood out last time and it was just as good as I remember. We also ordered the Coconut Soup and Spicy Basil Eggplant as well. Both were delicious, but neither favorites of mine. Since they were out of their bread pudding (I really want to try this!), we opted for the Creme Brûlée trio of Green Tea, Coconut, and Ginger Lemongrass. YUM! We're not big fans of creme brûlée, but these weren't overly sweet and the unique flavors were fun. Oh, and their Sangria is great! I'll need to go back to redeem my free glass!"}
{"text":"Nittaya's is a diamond in the rough. I've been here twice and have had a sampling from the tapas and happy endings (dessert) menus. I would recommend particular dishes, but so far everything has been delicious...so try everything! The service is top notch, the decor is beautiful, and the aroma of fresh flowers only adds to the ambiance.  This is the type of place to have a relaxing dinner with friends, to bring a date or out of town guests, or to go just because.
 
P.S. Half price bottles of wine on Thursdays!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite neighborhood restaurant!  It is so cute and intimate!  The presentation of the food is beautiful!"}
{"text":"I've always come here for work events and during lunch time. I was recommended the \"world famous spinach salad\" this was really world famous. When people say deep fried things are amazing they weren't lying! This deep friend spinach is crunchy and filling as far as the sauce that comes along with it it's amazing. I always stick to the drunken noodle which I really recommend. I feel like lunch time sizes vary from dinner sizes and that there may also be the price difference. My boyfriend decide to get the Duck curry I believe and I'm not a huge fan of curry but he said it was delicious, the meat was definitely soft tasted really good.

I didn't try any drinks this time but they have a wide range of wine options and some unique beers, my boyfriend decide to order the Lucky Buddha beer which comes in this really unique glass. 

 It's a small place yet the service is great. I can honestly say that my glass was always refilled with water and someone always came to check up on us and not in an annoying overbearing way either.

If you're in the Summerlin area definitely check out Nittaya's Secret Kitchen."}
{"text":"Great food, but was a little slow on the service and a tad expensive for what you get. i think there are better places in town that have the same menu or close. If you live in the Summerlin area and want to a short trip with good food, Nittaya's is a safe bet. But if you live elsewhere, use the gas to hit up other places around town."}
{"text":"great thai fusion cuisine. very inventive and flavorful. great atmosphere and friendly service. definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"This place sucks horrible service and that's the secret I had to open a yelp account just to post this"}
{"text":"Wow I'd have to say that this place is a hidden gem! Romantic ambience and authentic Thai food is the theme. I started off with a beautiful white sangria that had a flower in it. Be careful, these are dangerous! They are very sweet and go down very easily. We tried multiple tapas including the golden pouches, fried avocado, and Siamese corn fritters. My favorite of these were the corn fritters. They had a crunchy exterior with a soft stuffing including kernels of corn, pork and spices. The sauce that came with these was delicious! It was sweet and had peanuts floating in it. The golden pouches were also very tasty. I got these to try their curry sauce which was excellent. These pouches were so pretty I didn't even want to eat them! The fried avocado was also very tasty and an interesting concept. At last I tried the chocolate banana beignets. OMG these were divine. They were stuffed with a deep dark chocolate and bananas in the inside. They were then drizzled with chocolate on the outside. They came hot and freshly fried. This place serves a multitude of wines and had two beers on tap.  It did not appear that they serve any type of mixed drinks or hard liquor. This secret place is definitely a restaurant that should not be kept secret!"}
{"text":"ooo I think about this place all the time. It is pricier than I would want thai food to be but I just crave the spinach salad. It is not what you are thinking... this is actually no salad at all. It is lightly tempura battered spinach leaves served as chips with this delicious dip made from ground chicken, cashews, cilantro, carrots, and onions. mm mm good! That is a MUST order when going here. I love the feeling of being in there too, they set the mood for Thai perfect.  Get off yelp & go!"}
{"text":"Restaurant is very small. I suppose that's the new fad. The food is superb. It is very pricey so be prepared to spend about $20 per entree."}
{"text":"What a great concept, my husband and I enjoyed the small plates Nittayas has managed to put a fun and creative way to eat authentic Thai food. The place is very pretty nice atmosphere, the owner and chef happened to stop by are table we  where telling her we are enjoying the taste treats, she said she uses her mother's recipes and also adds her own style to the dishes. I would definitely be going back maybe bring some of my friends on girls night out!!"}
{"text":"I have loved Nittaya's for years! Of course, the spinach salad appetizer is AMAZING, and everything else is perfect, too. I usually get the pad see ew, and it is great. I am happy they expanded into the space next door and there's more space to move around now!"}
{"text":"Great little find. The food is always amazing. My favorite is the Spinach Salad. Tempura spinach leaves with a flavorful dip."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely amazing and so delicious. Service was great. Food came out quick and hot. The coconut shrimp soup is a must. Highly recommend this place. The place is also decorated nicely and feels very homey."}
{"text":"We ate here twice and both times it was excellent. They had no problem converting dishes to our vegan preferences, replacing chicken with tofu in the spinach salad and making things without egg. You definitely want a reservation though. We stopped by on a random day of the week and there was a line out the door and they were unable to serve us."}
{"text":"Went there tonight for the first (and last) time and the first dish (Thai wings) was so bad, it ruined our night. See pic below - a feather in the skin! My fiancé tried to return them at first because she saw chicken HAIR. They claimed it was lemongrass - really?! So we each had one wing and then the feather. We promptly returned them and were able to get a refund.

The main dishes weren't so bad - Shrimp Pad Thai and Seafood Madness. But the price - $19 each?! There's better Pad Thai for half that price at a dozen other places around town.

Surprisingly this place was near-packed, though it's also quite tiny. I can mainly attribute the crowd to the fact that there are few other quality restaurants in the area.

Which brings me to my conclusion. We have basically a South Summerlin and a North Summerlin. Both have wonderful homes in beautiful neighborhoods. But a big difference - FOOD. We live in the South and are truly blessed to have a ridiculous amount of tasty restaurants in our area. Down the road from us (near Ft Apache) there are THREE Thai restaurants that are all a better value than Nittaya's.

To you North Summerlin folks - I feel sorry for your limited food options - please feel free to drive out to the South side for some REAL food!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness... So enjoyed everything on this little Thai gem, place is small but very nicely decorated,   Food was amazing I had spinach salad and steak avocado curry for lunch and it's delicious!"}
{"text":"We just thought this place was just the same old Thai Food but... when we tasted this place. OMG!It was the best place ever. All 8 of us had a huge table, no kidding, the whole table was full of AWESOME food. Like I think this place is the best Thai food ever!! My favorite here is the Papaya Salad. We got in total: Steak Curry, Salmon Curry, Basil Lamb Chops, 2 Sticky Rices, Papaya Salad, Pineapple Fried Rice, Shrimp Fried Rice and lots more! Emoji Style:"}
{"text":"The food and service were both very good, but definitely overpriced.  We had the secret stickers, angel wing and volcano shrimp.  All were excellent, but we didn't like that the sauce for the volcano shrimp was all the way at the bottom of the almost enclosed bowl.  You had to dig through the rest of the shrimp to get any sauce.  The drunken noodles were very good, but I thought the seafood madness was overly sweet.  Very nice place to come with great service, but you pay a bit too much for the food."}
{"text":"The most amazing Thai food!!! Great ambiance , music and staff is amazing!! Josh was our bartender and he rocks too!"}
{"text":"Excellent service by Leah, she was very nice and had great recommendations. I had the green curry and gf had the Massaman chicken curry served with brown rice. Both were fantastic! I wish I lived in Las Vegas to come to this spot. They will make any dish with Tofu for vegetarians. The lunch special includes the brown/white rice, a salad and fried vegetable dumpling."}
{"text":"Went here to try for lunch today. Going through Yelp photos just now at home, I realized the wait staff deliberately did not give us the lunch menu.   What a shame. So deceitful."}
{"text":"Great food. Great ambience. Great presentation. Great staff. Be sure to try the eggplant panang!"}
{"text":"Transported upon entry, this cozy dining room with a wine bar suggests a more European feel than a Thai restaurant.  Two menus are presented - one a conventional Thai listing with adapted names for American tastes, like \"Pad Z-U\".  The other is a tapas menu with an Asian bend.  The papaya salad with prawns tasted authentic but a touch spicy for my dining partner.  We were not offered the '1 to 5' spicy range, but notice the reviews include such a choice.  Nonetheless, I enjoyed the salad 'kick' without complaint.  The catfish was presented with a tasty curry-like sauce that worked very well.  We considered tapas, but our two dishes satisfied.

The wine list demonstrates a competent selection with an adequate variety by the glass.  However, our Pinot Noir must have sat in the bottle at least overnight and lacked character.  It's truly awkward to send back glasses of wine during a first visit as these glasses were \"borderline\" in my opinion, so we shifted gears for 2nd glasses and commented politely to the waiter about the 1st.  I suggest tasting before committing until they cycle their by-the-glass bottles properly.

Service was capable and polite.  Reservations are recommended as the size of the dining room is limited for your pleasure and comfort.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. I have seen this place while driving by so many times and the sign was just intriguing right off the bat - Thai * Tapas * Wine.... 3 of my favorite things!! Well how stupid am I for waiting so long to try it? This place was SOOOOO good. It was unique, very small dining room, cozy feel... We tried everything that was recommended to us for our first time and we were not disappointed. We did the chicken skewers with the peanut sauce, salmon avocado curry (which I wasn't too keen on from the description, but once I actually tried it I was so thankful I listened), we did the world famous spinach salad.... Not a salad at all, but the sauce was to die for. I checked in on Yelp to receive a free sangria... DELICIOUS and beautiful presentation! This place is a MUST GO TO! Recommending you make a reservation because we showed up at 5:30 and we were the only ones in the dining room - but 30 minutes to an hour later there wasn't a table available!! LOVE this place."}
{"text":"Just all around awesome. My friends and my favorite spot. Hidden and hopefully not everyone finds out about it. Will definitely keep it our secret."}
{"text":"My friend girl has been raving about this small intimate dining experience so naturally I had to give it ago!!

Reservations are highly recommended because Nittaya's Thai Kitchen is pretty busy (at least it was Friday 7/10)

We ordered Red & White Sangria for starters which I recommend! Delish...

*Siamese Egg Rolls (veggie) $9 were excellent
*Garlic Edamame
*Chicken Ginger Salad $16
*Calamari 
*Shrimp, Jalapeño, Cream Cheese Puff

$80+tip

I look forward to returning in the near future and thank you Pum for you phenomenal service!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. Everything i had tapa style was to die for. And that bread pudding with coconut ice cream. Ohhhhh heaven in your mouth. So good. I'll be back to this gem."}
{"text":"#latereview 08/09/2015

I enjoyed my time more being with friends than being here. I will give them a chance again but for now I have other go to places for Thai.

Now I know going in that I should be more prepared and check to see if reservations were needed. My friend suggested this place without a reservation. So we ended up being sat at the bar. No worries there. Completely our fault.

To start off the dinner with friends I ordered my usual papaya salad. Theirs had shrimp so I said why not? I enjoyed the flavor more than the dish itself. The dressing was on point, but the usual crispness that you would expect from a green papaya was just not there. The peanuts did lend to the crunchiness but it was not the same. I appreciate seafood but for some reason to me it did not pair well with the salad. I don't know how the shrimp was handled during preparation but it did not have a good texture. Like it sat too long in the dressing maybe? It was just off putting. I didn't get sick after the dinner so I'm not saying the shrimp was spoiled, but it did not have the usual characteristic of something fresh. 

The Duck Breast Curry was okay. Well, better than okay. I appreciated the fact that it was a duck breast which meant no bones to pick through, but it was just not the same as other duck curries I've had at other restaurants. 

By the time I got to the dessert, I was impressed by the presentation... Then this happened. This is more of the chef in me so I don't know if it goes unnoticed by most people, but seeing that same garnish (purple edible orchids) throughout all my courses... I think it's enough. Yes there's a time and place for it but not through every single course. 

All in all, I felt the food was okay. Would I go back? I would not actively do it but if friends suggested it I will still go."}
{"text":"Delicious and fresh Thai food! The fried spinach salad is a speciality of the house-- it is very unique and delicious! Highly recommend the chicken lettuce wraps and Bangkok fried rice as well"}
{"text":"Thai food in vegas can be quite difficult to find.  Next to Lotus of Siam, Nittaya's is my favorite.  They have some interesting dishes such as the spinach salad and the charred peppers and are also willing to account for those of us with dietary restrictions.  In addition to the above mentioned dishes I also had the basil eggplant with tofu.  I wish I had ordered it a 5 spicy, as I got the 3 and tasted no spice at all.  The flavor was great, and would get it again, just order a higher spice level.

The decor is great, the waitstaff is nice.  The place is tiny so reservations are recommended it was packed when we went."}
{"text":"I have never been treated quite this way at a restaurant. We first ordered two beers and 30 minutes later the waiter told us it would be another 5 minutes before we would get our beers. Ten minutes went by and we didn't get even a glass of water. We ordered two appetizers and one came out after an hour and the other didn't arrive after an hour and a half. We didn't even bother to order a dinner as we didn't feel like being there for an additional 2 hours. Then they tried to charge us for the beers that we never did get. I checked my credit card statement a week later and I found that the waiter double charged my credit card on accident. When I called to speak to Nattaya she was \"too busy\" to call me back and I had to keep calling until I finally spoke to her. She told me she just didn't have time to look through her statements and she would call me back in a few days. A few days went by and a waiter ended up calling me back telling me that he would have to be responsible for the additional money that was charged on my credit card. I will never go back to this restaurant again and Nattaya should check the labor laws as she doesn't treat her staff right. Mistakes happen, but you don't make your customer feel guilty for them. Avoid this restaurant at all costs."}
{"text":"My first time dining at Nittaya's Secret Kitchen and it is a beautiful place.  I love the different vegeterian dishes.  The spinach salad is great.  This place is tucked away and is truly a secret.  I can't wait to share Nittaya's Secret Kitchen with others."}
{"text":"Just got a take-out order from here, was recommended by a friend and definitely realize why, besides loving every dish We tasted, when we got home the pad Thai was missing from our order so we called them up, apparently they didn't have that we ordered it....  So they delivered the dish to our house, free of charge!   We kinda expected to pay for the dish and was just happy they were delivering it, so that was a pleasant surprise....   Not just going out of their way to make customers happy, but this food is awesome, try it if your nearby"}
{"text":"Wow what a treat! A friend recommended I try this place and I'm glad I did. I ordered the seafood medley but in Penang curry. The dish was beautiful with the clams, mussels, shrimp, fish etc. spice was good. I prefer so hot that it makes me cry. Not quite that but just right to taste it without over powering the other flavors. Friendly staff, great atmosphere, wonderful food. What else would you want."}
{"text":"I am slightly hesitant to give such a great review because the place is so small that if it gets too popular i will not be able to get a seat, but with this many great reviews, i would say the secret is out. Absolutely wonderful. I am always pleased when I eat here. By far and away the best item is the famous fried salad. It has a tangy vinaigrette with cashews and even a little bit of savory cheese. I really like the Panang curry, a little spicier than many places but by no means Thai spicy. This is a really small place, I recommend reservations. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Loved the spinach tempura salad and wine list. The tapas portions are large. Will be back!"}
{"text":"This is such a cute little date night spot! Very intimate and inviting. I didn't want to cook tonight so I ordered take out but now that I've been this is definitely a higher end Thai food place than I usually go for take out. I ordered beef pad se ew and chicken pad Thai. This cost $40 where my usual place would of been $20. The quality of beef was a noticeable difference. Both dishes were delicious but next time I'd prefer to eat there to take in the ambiance. I'll take the hubby on the next date night."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places. Innovative. Scrumptious. Always fresh and served beautifully and with a smile. Just great in every way."}
{"text":"Treasure in Summerlin!  Cozy atmosphere.  Authentic Thai cuisine served by very friendly staff.  Thursday night is half of wine bottle night.  The menu is extensive enough that you can eat there regularly and always have something different.  They did this place right!"}
{"text":"Great ambience; contemporary and cool. Plates beautifully presented. The food vibrant and fresh. Truly representative of an eatery in Summerlin (Hawaii yeeps, think Kahala)

Authentic Thai? No. Unless you think people in Thailand eat orchids.  But a prettied up example for Western palates.

Every dish I've ever sampled has highs and lows. For example, the spinach salad that so many rave about. The tempura spinach is excellent. Crispy with just the right salinity. Perfect fresh out of the clean oil. Unfortunately a dip in the sour, herbaceous sauce muddles the flavor and does nothing but make the dish soggy.

The server recommended marinated crispy pork, very moist with deep five spice flavor, with a crisp breaded coating, tasty. When mixed with the accompanying chili sauce, the crust becomes soggy and the oil becomes pronounced.

Golden pouches, pretty, but the deep-fried wrapper is too thick to bite through, forcing you to turn it upside down and soak it in the curry to soften. All good as the pouches break open and the creamy potato taste great with the curry.

In general Curries are very flavorful. Great coconut taste well integrated spice. You won't see chili oil floating on the surface. Proteins in the curries are well cooked.  Chicken and pork are especially tender and still moist.

Conversely, sauces don't complement dishes very well. All good, it's fun getting the pork into the curry and the spinach into the chili sauce. All better flavor combinations.

Great added touches such as an orange cucumber infused water.

Service is very welcoming and off Strip friendly.

So why four stars? Simple, The food is intriguing. Take the highs of each dish, play with your food make your own combinations.  In the end, a fun dining experience."}
{"text":"Tai do it's for desert they are good and I don't even eat sweets. The order is large and comes with 5 per order. 

My only complaint is all the chicken dishes come with very little chicken. If you don't order extra chicken in the chicken friend rice you get 5 pieces and same with the curry. It's very little chicken and all potatoes. Substitute the potatoes for veggies and order chicken extra."}
{"text":"I have had a few Thai restaurant experiences, but this one was by far excellent. The restaurant's ambience is great,  the staff is friendly and attentive, and the food is delicious. The lamb chops were done superb. The basil and garlic sauce was perfectly done and the meat melted in my mouth. I also tried their pot stickers as appetizer, they were spectacular. The only thing that could have improved the experience would have been bigger tables and chairs. As a guy who is 6'5\" the seats were too low and soft and the tables appeared to be below even standard height."}
{"text":"Why haven't we come here sooner? This is the best restaurant we have been to since moving to Las Vegas. We ordered a bunch of small plates and soups. Everything was fantastic! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Nittayas is by far the nicest, classiest...and most expensive Thai food restaurant I've visited!  I'm pretty sure this was the first time I've ever been asked if I had a reservation...for lunch...for Thai food lol.  And it was the only time I've ever felt self conscience for my 2 year old Little Foodie Dude eating with me during lunch!

It is very chic, glamorous and date night appropriate! Service was great as well...and food was outstanding...but you'll pay for it!

Coming here during lunch is a great deal! They have $11 lunch specials (yes, expensive compared to others around $5-7 range) but they are packed with flavor and use quality ingredients...you really can taste the difference! The lunch specials also come with a house salad and pot sticker which were both pretty good.  Portions are decent as well, so you should leave satisfied :)

I went with my standard Drunken Noodles aka Pad Kee Mao. This was an excellent rendition, with lots of flavor even with chicken instead of pork! I love chinese broccoli, so I was excited to see it in the dish! I asked for it extremely spicy though, and what I got was a 1/10 on my scale...I should have sent it back, but it was soo good even without the spice! 

Also tried their version of Pad Thai. Surprisingly, this was more spicy than the request for 10/10! I really liked their version of this dish, and is probably the best Pad Thai I've ran into so far, although I don't often order this dish.

But what if you don't come here during lunch? Expect to pay $16 for drunken noodles ala carte. They had $15 desserts on the menu. Yes, there are some cheaper alternatives, but I don't even remember seeing $15 desserts in some of the best steakhouses in town!

But you need to check this place out if you are a Thai food lover...just go during lunch IMO!"}
{"text":"I'm not very generous with five star reviews, but Nittaya deserve's each and every one.  From the general atmosphere (intimate and romantic) to the hibiscus lemonade,  the bacon grilled shrimp to the pad thai, everything is done with skill and flair.

Each item on the menu marries traditional with experimental and results in a fusion of pure flavorful bliss.  Nittaya's Secret Kitchen is a secret gem tucked away in Summerlin that I will continue to visit as long as I'm able to."}
{"text":"The signature dish here is the spinach salad, which not really a salad, but fried and lightly breaded spinach that you dip into an addictive dressing. This appetizer is so good you want to rub it all over yourself, but won't unless you want to end up in jail. 

The decor is tasteful and modern reflecting the Thai fusion style of the restaurant. The wait staff and knowledgeable, friendly, and attentive. 

We had the drunken noodles and the  the coconut seafood curry. Both dishes were delicious, with complex, rich, and spicy flavors. The drunken noodles were tasty, different, and unique with the addition of basil and Chinese broccoli. The coconut seafood curry was an amazing combination of fish, shrimp, mussels, clams, and scallops in a sumptuous curry sauce, just flat out fantastic!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner on a Thursday night abs had a great experience. First of all, wine is half off the bottle on Thursdays....can't go wrong with that! Outside patio is nice (minus the bench seat very uncomfortable) and perfect when the sun is setting. Overall one word for the food....amazing. The spicy catfish is delicious and the shrimp pad Thai is amazing. Will be back again....and again."}
{"text":"Nittaya's is a Beautiful little secret kitchen. Call and make reservation in order to guarantee your seat in this small intimate dining area.....once you do, you will be pleased you did. They serve so many wonderful dishes that you must return to try them. Some of the must haves are the Spinach Salad and Beef Jerky tapas. The tastes are amazing. Move on to the entrees and you will be pleased with the freshness and the tastes that come. Service is great. Atmosphere is unique and sexy. Food is top notch. My favorite Thai!"}
{"text":"All in all, food was excellent...Service was so so. They lost our reservation and we squeezed in at the bar, then 40 minutes later they found it and we finished our dinner at a table. Bar tender was not friendly and seemed overwhelmed. The rest of the staff has nice and hospitable and apologetic. The spinach salad was amazing and the eggplant Panang was excellent.  Pad Z U was above average. I'd go back but make sure they repeat back to you your reservation so you don't have any problem."}
{"text":"The service was attentive and fantastic. The food was great and this is a very nice hidden gem. I found this location by accident while searching for a lunch spot on Yelp"}
{"text":"One of mine and my sisters favorites! The staff is amazing and this place seriously got me hooked on coconut soup! It's super cozy and perfect for a date night or just hanging out with friends."}
{"text":"I really really enjoy this secret kitchen... it is no longer a secret as it tends to always be busy every night.

The wine selection is amazing, the food is always so fresh and mouthwatering.
They always serve infused water, which here in the desert is so nice and satisfying as it refreshes you and cleanses your palate.

I am embarrassed to say that I am one of those that cannot handle too much spice when it comes to food, I have tried and tried to no avail...my friends and family have a running joke that even ice is too spicy :) for me.

Here they always listen to my request when I say p,ease make it a 0 with no spice and I have never been disappointed 
My family likes the 5-8 spice range and they also are always satisfied.. if we share a dish they always split it and make sure that my \"ice\" spice is separate from the better seasoned (ha ha)
Food.

We always get the same order and then try one new dish.
Our favorite appetizers: chicken lettuce wraps, yummmmmmy .. they come in orders of 4 wraps and yes, the sauce is on the side, I can handle a little bit of it but you really don't need much sauce as the flavors are wonderful.
The crispy spinach and the secret stickers or potstickers.

Main course we get an order of massaman curry Chicken with you guessed it, no spice 
And the Basil chicken.
Pineapple fried rice which is served inside half of the pineapple

They always bring extra spices for the table which is usually kept at the other end of the table.
We also get one other dish to try each time and have never been disappointed with the experience 

I usually pass when it comes to desert, my suggestion here... Don't! Their deserts melt in your mouth, the ice cream is creamy and yummy... the fried banana is done to perfection and the fried donuts are scrumptious.

This is a place that we go to often, yes it's in a strip mall (not a big deal)  but so adorably decorated.. it is a bit on the smaller side, but so worth the crowded feel..they do have patio dining I have never tried that but it looks comfy... they have excellent happy hour items and great offerings for happy hour.

Always a great meal."}
{"text":"I love the spinach salad it's amazing!! The drunken noodles were awesome too. I ordered a 5 heat level didn't really feel like it was that hot but I know I tend to eat spicier than most people."}
{"text":"Beautiful and intimate little restaurant. The service was stellar and the food was delicious. Nice wine list. The only drawback is you are very close to to your neighbors."}
{"text":"We had this for lunch. Excellent food and service. Small intimate place with mellow music and ambiance. 

We had muay thai rice, ginger mushroom chicken, and drunken noodles with potstickers and salad. The drunken noodles were the overall favorite but all were fabulous."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem. By far the best thai food ive ever had. Cant go wrong with anything starting from appatezier to dessert"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved everything!!! There was not one dish that we got that was not delicious. And, the Secret Sangria was excellent, and obviously a favorite because I had four. Definitely a MUST if you're looking for an out-of-the-way spot, with an intimate setting. Perfect for a date. It was date night with my husband, and Nittaya's was totally his idea. I was so pleased with his selection."}
{"text":"Service was awful and extremely slow. We were seated by the front door when every few minutes the door would open and let in the light and heat which was blinding. When asked for extra sauce for the extremely dry chicken satay we were informed that there would be a charge, agreed, the our waiter proceeded to not bring it. We asked several waiters for assistance but nothing happened.  Highly not recommended"}
{"text":"I can see why this place has such good reviews and is booked out so often!
We arrived at 5pm for an early dinner without a booking. We were seated immediately and had the table available til 7, which suited us as we were off to a show. The staff were polite and very efficient. Our water was topped up after a few sips every time! The food was absolutely delicious. Very well presented, cooked perfectly and authentic, dynamic, balanced flavors. 
The venue is well stocked with wines and very ambient and cosy. A great location for romantic dates, but also popular for larger parties. The waitresses were very attentive and made sure we were happy with everything. This restaurant is a surprising and impressive hidden gem in Summerlin!
We can't wait to eat here again and will be taking our visiting families here soon also."}

Island Bread Pudding with Coconut Rum Caramel Sauce and Coconut Ice Cream

Sharing a city with one of the most highly acclaimed Thai restaurants in the United States cannot be easy but with Lotus of Siam's largely traditional menu routinely garnering hour-plus waits for both lunch and dinner it could also be said that Las Vegas is an ideal locale for something small, intimate, and innovative - a description defined by Chef Nittaya Parawong and her Secret Kitchen.  Featuring a style described as \"Thai Tapas\" alongside traditional curries and noodles with each dish made by Nittaya herself and served by friendly Taiwanese servers in a modern yet elegant space a meal at Nittaya's Secret Kitchen is a relaxed and refined affair beginning with complimentary flavored water and although the menu featured no less than a dozen items I'd have liked to try, the decision was made to start with a variety of tapas, appetizer, and curry plus dessert - each item prepared to order, ample in portion, and served with impeccable pacing.  Intentionally incorporating fish, vegetable, and meat before progressing to dessert and focusing on the more innovative options both the crispy fish cakes and the tender duck breast would prove delicious and well prepared with light sweetness acting to temper the heat and moving on to the \"famous\" salad I really have no idea how the chef manages to produce a batter so light and a flavor so vegetal but whatever the method it should be embraced, the dish one of the best things I've eaten at a Thai restaurant and without a doubt the most innovative 'salad' I've had in years.  Moving on to the dessert menu there was never really a question as to what I would order and with tender pineapple pudding rife with coconut milk custard topped off with both ice cream and caramel of the same I really cannot think of a better 'Thai' dessert, traditional or not, nor a better thing ever done with a coconut."}
{"text":"Someone let the cat out of the bag, since lots of people seem to know about this hidden gem. 

They were able to accommodate our party, even though I made a last minute reservation on Christmas Eve. Sadly, I did not get one of the white cushy chairs; they brought in an outdoor table and chairs, in order to squeeze us in--literally. By the way, the restaurant was super busy that night, and I was just thrilled to be back.

Our server was sweet and very witty. She made the best recommendations, and made us feel well taken care of.

We ordered Pad Thai, Pad Si Ew, fried tofu, green curry chicken and their signature spinach salad. The salad was the perfect appetizer for our party of four. We enjoyed it so much that I ordered it for dessert (for the entire table of course). Be advised, this is a savory, deep fried salad, with a sweet sauce on the side. 

Normally, we order several desserts and tea, but we were stuffed. Their pastry chef does a fine job, so please don't skip dessert."}
{"text":"Best Thai food I have ever had! I will never go to Archie's again! Service is great and the food is even better. The restaurant is beautifully decorated and it is treated as an upscale restaurant.I highly recommend coming in for lunch because their lunch specials are so much cheaper and they are just as amazing! Even ordering to go is smooth. I highly recoupment the pan fried noodles, the drunken noodles, the spring rolls, and the mango sticky rice!"}
{"text":"Was in Vegas for a conference and it had been a long day - 6 hour flight followed by a drive to Death Valley. On the way from Death Valley to my hotel, I called the the restaurant around 9:15pm and they said to come on down, even though they close at 10pm.  

First, the excellent customer service - I got there at around 9:35pm, but they were very welcoming and not for a moment did I feel that they were in a hurry for me to leave. Very nice!

I ordered a green chicken curry but with extra vegetables - they were happy to oblige. The vegetables were actually the star of the show - perfectly cooked, for each type of vegetable they put in - perfect balance of firm and tender.  And they did not skimp  on the quantity or variety   - mushrooms, green beans, carrots, broccoli, egg plant.  

The curry itself was of just the right  consistency-  not too thick and not watery, with just the right amount of heat and deep, complex flavor.  Just to note, the quantities are very generous- enough for two.   

Finally, I ordered the donuts which had just right amount of sweet to end the day.  

Highly recommended and well worth the money."}
{"text":"This place is the BEST! I ordered this to go, but I have eaten at the restaurant and it is just as great. We ordered a ton of food tonight including drunken noodles with tofu, fried avocado, spinach salad, ribs, pad thai, edamame, and chicken fried rice. The drunken noodles were for me, usually it comes with chicken but since I don't eat chicken they were able to substitute it with tofu. My other favorite thing from here is the fried avocado. I really can't think of anything I like more than fried avocados. If you were to dine in the restaurant it is a bit nicer than other Thai restaurants I've been to in Las Vegas. It's definitely a great spot for date night or girls night. The restaurant is pretty small, so I would recommend making reservations if you were to go on the weekend. Also, this place is very vegetarian friendly!"}
{"text":"Always crave the spinach salad. Finally tried the garlic rice minus the cilantro.  Nice wine variety. This is my new favorite and must have this at least once a week:)   This is my 4th time here and finally ordered dessert! Fried banana and coconut ice cream WITH caramel rum sauce. Now, the coffee served French press style! 4 stars, place is a bit tight."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic, service was pretty good, but I have never been asked to leave a restaurant because there were people waiting for our table. Unbelievable! Very rude! Never in my life have I had this happen. Our feeling was that once we paid our check we were no longer valued. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"The decor is nice, rustic, Napa Valley-like exposed brick and wood with concrete floors making it seem you are in CA.
The food is outstanding in flavor with just the right seasoning, not too spicy or pungent. Good portions and selection with a twist on traditional Thai flavors.
The service on the day we went was terribly slow and the waitstaff did not pay attention to customers, reacted slowly to requests and seemed to lack a sense of urgency. It's the only reason the review earns 3 stars. Otherwise it would have been a 5 but 2 hours for lunch is excessive."}
{"text":"Thanks to my sister for this recommendation. My fiance and I came here for lunch this time around at 1pm in the afternoon. Only a few others were here, and the perfect time to take  your time to eat. If you plan on coming in for dinner highly recommend to make reservations as they get packed. 

For our second visit, I noticed the menu is more expansive. They do have lunch specials going for $11 with salad and chicken potsticker from 11am-3pm. The rest of the menu has appetizers, tapas, entrees, a huge list of wine, cocktails, and alcohol and desserts. 

What we ordered: the famous spinach salad w/the lime sauce, thai beef jerky w/the green sauce  (beware, this green sauce is soooo addicting), pork belly w/the spicy chilli sauce, shrimp, secret stickers (basil chicken flavored) and the muay thai fried rice. Everything we ordered came mostly off of the tapas menu and the muay thai fried rice we decided to get from the dinner menu. 

Everything we tasted has been the best thai food we have tasted in so long.  Spinach salad is enough to feed a party of 4 to 5 ppl. Spinach also has been perfectly cooked. Adding the lime sauce adds a bit of the kick. Definitely recommend for first timers. Pork belly with the chilli sauce and the pork was tender. This is the thai version of the Filipino version of lechon. Shrimp was on point with the chilli sauce. The chicken basil pot stickers, were different. Crunchy on the outside and juicy, tender when you bite right into it. Last, the fried rice was fluffy and evenly seasoned and enough to feed a whole family.

The service: by far one of the best. They were attentive, suggested other options, on point with refills. 

Overall: we enjoyed our service and definitely recommend if you want to enjoy dinner or lunch. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"A beautiful restaurant in Summerlin.  Great ambience and perfect for date night but but BUT, make a reservation as this place is tiny and has limited number of tables.  I went here for our lunchthey're not too busy for lunch. We got a free sangria with our Yelp check-in.

They have a great lunch special menu which comes with a salad with ginger dressing, pot sticker and entree for about $11.  I got pad thai spicy 3 out of 5,drunken noodles spicy 5 out of 5.  My pad thai came out really spicy and the drunken noodles were milder so we swapped towards the end when I was covering my nose with tissue.  Despite that, I thought the food was delicious.

Service was great.  Our server was attentive.  The food is more expensive here than other Thai restaurants but this is more upscale Thai cuisine.  I'd have to come back here for their tapas and I know I will be back."}
{"text":"Lovely staff. I tasted 3 wines before settling on one. Waitress was friendly, patient and informative about the food. Very unusual selections. Corn fritters made with ground pork, tempura spinach, cilantro steak skewers. All fantastic with individual sauces! Our first time but will be back."}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised about this hidden gem. The reason one star is missing is because they were out of each wine we tried to order on their half off night- which was frustrating.  However, the rest of the meal pleased us.  Never would I think a fried spinach salad would taste so good.  We also enjoyed the drunken noodles and  red curry. The dining room is small, so a reservation is highly recommended."}
{"text":"We loved the spinach salad and the soups! The entree were good, but the rice was below average. Could have been an off night for the rice. The service was good and they let us have our dog join us on the patio. There are no patio heaters, so it might be a better to do with your well behaved puppy during the spring. We will definitely return, good wine selection too."}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant for several years.  
I moved to other side of town and had not been back for at least a year.  I returned again recently and must say I still love their dishes.  
      It's considered by some as gourmet Thai food! 
You must have the fried spinach and shishito peppers to start.  
    My favorite dish is the avocado curry salmon. I simply can't get enough of this delicious combination.  I also still think it's one of the best Pad Thai in town. 
     They have a great wine selection. 
     One thing I will say and perhaps it was on off night when we went, but service was slow , floors were a bit dirty and setting wasn't as polished as I had remembered it to be. None the less, their food is so very flavorful."}
{"text":"Nittaya's Secret Kitchen is just that (a secret) it definitely is a diamond in the rough in regards to location. It's a little hard to find if you don't know the area well. It's tucked away behind all the buildings on the Southeast corner of Lake Mead Blvd. and Rampart Blvd.
I had to bring the crew here because I've been telling them about it for a while. They were blown away. They absolutely loved it, it was good to see how much everybody else liked it. I feel like I'm always biased because of how much I like my favorite restaurants but this was different, everyone at the table couldn't stop talking about how good the food was. So I knew it wasn't me being biased. The staff is extremely friendly and kind. The restaurant itself is decorated with style and class. It's very clean inside and they pride themselves with running a tight ship. Anyway if you decide to make the trip down to Nittaya's Secret Kitchen just order your favorite Thai dish and buckle up because you're in for a treat..!
Ciao"}
{"text":"Checked out the website today, looks like they updated it and it looks great, plus they've taken out the prices and added some tempting lunch specials.   Fully upgrading to the 4 stars that the food deserved.  Everything seems A OK now!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about my recent dinner. As a huge fan of Thai food, I was pleasantly surprised to find a nice mix of familiar favorites and wonderful modern new twists. We had the Spinach Salad (of course!), volcano shrimp, Cashew Shrimp and Chicken Masaman Curry. Every single dish was delightful. The flavors of the cashew shrimp were bright and slightly spicy. The curry was creamy, slightly spicy and rich. An OMG the spinach salad was insanely addicting. 
If you are in Summerlin this is a fantastic relaxed date night spot or a great gathering spot with friends. Also, Thursday night is half price bottles of wine and they do have a happy hour from 3-6p, I believe."}
{"text":"I tried this place recently and loved it.  I went there with a group of friends and We usually just go to the same chain restaurants over and over so we decided to try something new.  

We were very pleasantly surprised with this restaurant.  We split several dishes, like Tapas.  The food is amazing.  Each dish was unique and we enjoyed trying a number of different dishes.  The prices were also reasonable. We will definitely be back.

Tip: make a reservation.  The restaurant is small and popular, so it fills up quickly."}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW is this place good!!  My husband and i stumbled on this spot and we are hooked.  It is VERY small inside but it lends to the cool vibe.  Service is EXCELLENT and very attentive.  The food is off th ehook.  Be sure to ask for specials, we learned that trick on visit #3.  ALso, you should try the tempura fried spinach salad, it is remarkable!!"}
{"text":"Several unique dishes we loved - Kao Soi noodles, shrimp pad Thai and chicken satay. All very good. Excellent home made coconut ice cream. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The restaurant is small and intimate.  The service we had was excellent. Very attentive but not to the point where we felt they were interrupting us.  The food was fresh, hot and very tasty.the Tapas selection is great and Curry dishes are delish.  Great wine selection.  The first time I've been to a Thai place. Very enjoyable time. Looking forward to a return visit"}
{"text":"I am giving this place 4 stars based upon the quality of the food.  It was very good. However,  the prices are ridiculous. I understand that it is supposed to be an upscale Thai/tapas/wine place, but no Thai restaurant should charge $16 - $24 an entrée.  I ordered drunken noodles & the Angel wing, and my bill was $26, and the potions were small. I got 1 stuffed wing for $8.
While the food is good, I will not be back."}
{"text":"I've eaten in plenty of Thai Restaurants, here and even in Thailand. This was some of the finest I've had. We had Drunken Noodles, a spinach salad that was done as tempura and a Cornish hen....excellent!!! I definitely recommend this establishment"}
{"text":"It was my mine and my husbands first time here and we absolutely loved it. The atmosphere was so nice. It was very clean and the service was amazing. The food was very high quality. We have the beef jerky, panang with chicken and the red curry and for desert we got the mango and sticky rice. It was all so good and so fresh. Probably the best Thai restaurant I have ever been to."}
{"text":"My gal pal who knows all the hot spots in LV brought me here one night and it was an authentic experience.  We started with the papaya salad which was spicy and tangy sort of like biting into a freshly rained on Thai jungle.  

The fried avocado was tempura style so very light and came with the most mysteriously delicious green sauce.  The shrimp skewers were seasoned in light curry and presented atop a fresh pineapple slice.  Peanut sauce seemed homemade.  The tropical chicken rice was an earthy delight.  All the ingredients were fresh and colorful without feeling heavy.  The coconut ice cream was like an angelic glimpse into what could be if I lived inside a saccharine coconut.  Still thinking about it."}
{"text":"4 stars doesn't do this place justice. This is a 5 star place!!!! The ambiance, quality of food, and prices are unbelievable!!!! Better than high end places in downtown Las Vegas"}
{"text":"First time here.  Food and server James were excellent. However we almost left before we were even seated....  made a reservation as we knew that was a must.  Arrived at 6:15 for our 6:30 reservation. Hostess offered us a high top table next to the bar.  We would have had everyone standing and waiting to be seated practically on-top of us. So we asked for another table.  She told us that we could have another table however we would need to finish by 7:15.  .  It was 6:15. When we questioned that she left to ask someone else. Came back and pointed to a corner table across the room and stated \" you can go sit in that corner\". Never walked us over. Just pointed.  We almost walked out at that point. Glad we didn't as James apologized numerous times and provided a great dining experience. He inquired what we liked and made some wonderful recommends. James saved the day.  Would have been a 5 star except for experience with hostess."}
{"text":"Very good Thai place in Summerlin 
Got the Thai seafood bouillabaisse in a coconut curry broth 
Pineapple fried rice 
Fried tofu 
Will definitely come back again and try other dishes on the menu"}
{"text":"It took us a year to get here but we finally did and loved our lunch experience. We love the decor and sat in the main room. There is a quieter room in the back which also looked inviting. We ordered two appetizers based on reviews and were not disappointed: the spinach salad and the spare ribs. The spinach tempura salad was perfection with an ideal lime dressing. I would say that it was the best tempura dish I have ever had. The five spice sauce on the ribs was also perfect. Both had excellent after tastes that lingered on. The lunch salad was ample with a wonderful light rice vinegar based dressing. Our main dishes were also delicious and of course, we were too full to eat them all. They tasted great the next day. One was a glass noodle dish with lots of veggies snd the other had flat rice noodles with chicken. Standard fare but very tasty sauces. We cannot wait to return to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Nittaya's is always one of our go to places! Love their food and the service is always great!"}
{"text":"Excellent!
A hidden gem. 
After our awesome meal, we had the thai donuts and paired it w the coconut ice cream. It was great!"}
{"text":"Almost everything we got was great!  The dough on the Curry Dumplings was just a bit to heavy and seemed to suck in all the oil.  They were kind of thick and the presentation was a bit odd with them served on a very skinny dish all in a row.  Maybe a different serving presentation, dough and a sauce of some sort would help.  The seared tuna tapas was wonderful and dinner of skirt steak avocado curry and garlic saffron rice was amazing!  The place is a bit small for the type of seating they use so when its crowded you really have to plan your exit.  Would I go back?  Yes, there are many more items i can't wait to try!"}
{"text":"What ever you do you must order the spinach salad!!! Thank goodness my mom lives down the street... I always have reason to visit this gem. One of the best Thai restaurants I have eaten at. Don't expect to leave with a left over bag, you will probably eat everything on your plate since the portions are just right."}
{"text":"Tried Nittaya's last night on the recommendation of a friend. So GOOD! After reading Yelp reviews, we called ahead to reserve a table for four, which turned out to be a good idea, even on a Monday night. Great service, great food. Fried avocado, beef salad, angel wings, duck breast curry, combo pad thai, coconut ice cream. I look forward to the warmer weather so we can sit outside and sample more delicious dishes!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've ever had, and I've had a lot of Thai food! 

Perfect pot stickers. The pork red curry noodle dish was my heaven. My husband had a basil pork dish with rice and devoured it.

It's a lovely little restaurant tucked away in a shopping center. Open for lunch and dinner. Depending on the night, you might still need a reservation.

Happily we live close to it, because while this was our first visit, it won't be our last!"}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service. Get the friend spinach (it's like spinach tempura). You dip it in this tangy vinegary dip that has cashews, ground chicken, green onions...it's magical just order it. 

The drunken noodles are a must also. Perfect every time.

Consistently delicious. Nice atmosphere. My family and I love it."}
{"text":"4 stars only because I'm not sure if I would go out of my way to go back. The restaurant is very cozy and clean. Service and food was good especially the spinach tempura salad! I'm glad I tried it and it was definitely worth it so now I can move on. The other dishes were pretty much typical in flavor of any other good Thai restaurant."}
{"text":"If you are looking for an intimate setting for a  date night with your significant over or just a fun girls night out on Thursdays for half price wine night and LOVE Thai food, this is the place. 
I've heard nothing but fabulous reviews about this little restaurant, and Nittayas did not disappoint. They offer an array of tapas and thai entrees. The Ahi tuna was fresh and melt in your mouth delicious. The soft shell crab and green apple salad was refreshing and a new dish for me, but I loved it. I also had to try the fried avocado which left me wanting more with its creamy, crunchy texture. By the tune my spicy basil eggplant entree came out I was stuffed and only able to eat a few incredible bites before throwing in the towel. 
I cannot wait to go back to this little gem. Oh and did I mention their staff is delightful?!"}
{"text":"The food here is very good, portions are large, but it's pricey for a single diner.

I had the eggplant dish with chicken added.  (24.00)

Not many peppers, would have liked more, but tons and tons of eggplant--best tasting eggplant I have ever had at an Asian restaurant.  Sliced chicken breast was OK, but nothing special.

Really could have shared this dish it was so large and I am a tremendous eater.

Don't think anyone will have a bad meal here.

Service is very friendly and efficient. 

Nice place--fine for a romantic diner. 

Give it a shot."}
{"text":"Awesome little secret place. When we walked in it was dark and we noticed it was super nicely decorated. It looks more like a romantic place where you can get a little privacy. Food was good and the owner was around making sure everyone was happy. My husband wanted a lemonade and she heard when he asked the waiter. She quickly came to let us know they had their own home made lemonade (I think lavender) and we decided to go for it - it was delicious. They had no high chairs (I guess it is not really a kids place) but the tables are ok to sit kids at. We had both our kids in and while we were dining another family came in with 2-3 kids. We did not get any dirty looks :)
Overall great experience and I hope to make it back soon without kids for more of a romantic meal."}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely incredible!  I have been here a few times, and made a reservation for Valentine's Day.  We were seated quickly, and the service was well-timed and unobtrusive.  The waitstaff have always made excellent recommendations on wine every time I have been here, prices are very reasonable for the serving sizes and quality of food, and extra steps are taken on presentation.   A perfect date night thanks to Nittaya's."}
{"text":"truly the best thai food in las vegas!!!  that atmosphere is fabulous - the service incredible!  nittay the owner is absolutely adorable and takes such pride in her cooking!  she sent a plate of her special fried spinach - so we have everytime we go there - which is now about 3x a week!  a definite must if you have not been there!!!
make sure you make reservations at dinner time!"}
{"text":"This little place has been a couple of different restaurants that haven't made it, but I sure hope this latest reincarnation lasts.  It's another place right in my neighborhood and I'm happy to report that it was a fine dining experience, as in great!  I had the spinach salad, which, as other reviewers have said, is a must:  it's tempura spinach--where else can you get that?  I also ordered the grilled mango shrimp, which is shrimp wrapped in bacon with a mango sauce: I did not share this dish.  My date had the  grilled salmon-avocado curry, which he loved and ate all by himself because I'm allergic to fish, but it gave me a good excuse to hoard my shrimp.  We finished off the meal with the fried bananas with coconut ice cream--wow!  Service was excellent throughout, but it's hard to be neglected in such a small space--I would recommend reservations if you go.  This place shouldn't be a secret because I want it to stay--check it out for yourself soon!"}
{"text":"Hands down! the best Thai Restaurant in the city. The service and food is exceptional, very high standards."}
{"text":"I like this place when I go to Vegas. It's the bomb. The quality is amazing and they care about their customers. I get the pineapple fried rice with gf sauce."}
{"text":"I and my friend came here for lunch. At first I thought we went to a wrong place because I didn't realize the tables and chairs I saw in the pics were back in 2012. Haha. Anyways, this place got good reviews (That's why I picked this place) so, I had a high expectation of customer service & quality of food. It turned out that the food wasn't as expected. I was surprised Tom Yum wasn't listed on the menu. I asked the server who told me it was called \"Lemon Grass soup\" in the appetizer section.

Anyhow, the server could have been more pleasant. He looked like he didn't want to work there.

The Seafood Madness I ordered was way too salty. I didn't feel it was worth the price. Surprisingly, they brought a (small) bowl of rice for me & my friend to share. I would have preferred to have my own bowl of rice instead.

Not sure if I'd return......"}
{"text":"Not going to lie. Very disappointed. I don't know if they changed staff but this visit was very bad. Ordered the fried rice but asked for no egg, and it was so bland, no taste at all. So switched it for the pad Thai. And waiter then said that chef couldn't comped it because we asked for no egg. But I don't understand why that's enough of an excuse for the rice to still be bland. I go to le Thai all the time and ask for no egg on top of my fried rice and it's still Amazing!!! If I would recommend Thai food I would say le Thai there is a long wait BUT there's a reason there is !!!!! Never leave yelp reviews until now. I had such a bad experience I felt like I needed to share it."}
{"text":"I found this place on Instagram. And when I checked the reviews, they were all good. This place is a very cute hidden gem. It is beautiful on the outside with the vines. And, it is very elegant & intimate on the inside. It is dark but not too dark. There were candles on the table and dim lighting. The bar was very pretty also. 

The food was good. We asked for the shishito peppers as an appetizer, but unfortunately, they were out. So, we got the spinach salad as an appetizer. I still don't know if it was fried or dehydrated spinach, but it was pretty good. 

He got the tiger steak which he liked and I got the Pad see yew with shrimp. My Pad see yew was pretty good. I have had better, but it was still pretty good. For dessert, we shared the mango sticky rice. It's a very simple and refreshing dessert. Basically, sliced mangoes and rice. It's very pretty to take a picture of it. I like the way that they put flowers on every dish. Orchids, I believe.

Overall, I like this place. The atmosphere was just perfect. I will definitely have to come back to try their shishito peppers. And, I would try a different entrée."}
{"text":"Best hidden secret in Las Vegas. This is by far our favorite place to eat out. We are always treated to kindly by the staff and the food is beyond amazing and excellent. 

The meals taste fresh and you can tell are made to order, with everything having it's own unique twist to it, and it works. 

Thank you Nittaya for giving us years of enjoyable dinners and evenings !"}
{"text":"The only reason I'm not giving this place 5 stars is because of the service. The food: OUTSTANDING! The atmosphere: Cute and Comfortable. The wine list: Lots to choose from. The staff: Friendly. The service: Really slow...... We shared a bottle of Sauvignon Blanc and 2 starters, the Tempura Spinach Salad and the Calamari. Entrees were the Spicy Green Bean Pork and the Grilled Skirt-Steak Avocado Curry. I'll definitely go back (and probably order the same thing because it was so damn good). I just hope they consider hiring more staff to accommodate when the restaurant is busy. We dined at 8:45pm on a Friday."}
{"text":"I eat here a lot. I can't resist the spinach salad. I admit sometimes I come here at lunch just to have that spinach salad. The sauce that accompanies it is spectacular! I love the assortment of wines. I have not been disappointed with any of the wines. All of the food I've ordered has been delicious, full of flavor. I recommend this place for some home made Thai food that isn't commercialized."}
{"text":"This place designed very nicely, but the best part is not only the design, their food is great!
Until now it's the best Thai restaurant I ate, especially in Las Vegas.

I love their \"happy nooners\" menu, great value for your money!
The service was good, restaurant was clean and because of yelp - another great find (I found this restaurant few months ago).

For desert I tried the mango coconut rice, I enjoyed it :)"}
{"text":"Love, love the decor. This is definitely a perfect place for a date or someone to impress, it's very serene and tranquil and was just a complete relaxation from the usual (but I'm probably saying this because I went right when they opened so it wasn't overly crowded with noise and chatter.) The service was excellent, they were friendly, professional and had immaculate timing with food, refills, etc. (probably because I was one of the few there at the time but still you'd be amazed at how many restaurants suck at this). I also really liked the bathrooms, they weren't the usual dingy bathroom, it kind of felt like a hotel bathroom. I know ... a bathroom review is weird but sometimes it's just good to know. 

I had the E-Haan Sausage, Calamari, Spinach Salad, Drunken Noodles and the Salmon Avocado Curry. The curry was recommended as the \"best dish ever in the city\" by the server and with that bold statement I knew it would fail to live up to expectations. It was good, not a standout but still good. The calamari was actually really good much to my surprise. It wasn't over breaded, had the perfect consistency and the sauce was spicy but sweet, a good complement. 

The E-Haan Sausage was different, you wrapped it in a lettuce wrap and it had different toppings, original, good and different. The drunken Noodles tasted like...drunken noodles. Nothing outstanding, they tasted exactly what they were supposed to taste like. 

I was a little confused about the hype over the spinach salad. The lime dressing is actually amazing, I love lime and I could drizzle that stuff over anything but the actual salad is just fried lettuce or tempura battered lettuce. I have an inner fat kid so anything fried tastes good, I'm not a fan of carrots but guess what's good? Fried carrots. Almost anything fried can be good so I'm not sure why this dish is overhhyped.

All in all not a bad place to check out, good environment, good wine selection, but not five stars because the food was good, but I can't see myself ever craving it or telling someone they have to go here to try a specific dish."}
{"text":"In a city of many fine Asian restaurants, this one is a gem for Thai food.  The food is original and delicious.  Pad noodles, salmon in green curry, lamb chops, appetizers--all good.  Service and ambience are fabulous.  Small intimate dining in a hideaway location."}
{"text":"My only regret here is that i wasn't able to try more of the menu. My personal favorite is the fried avocado wedges. Theres also a great wine menu too. All in all a good place to take friends or someone special."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of dinning at Nittaya's Secret Kitchen last night after hearing great reviews from three other people. I consider myself a foodie and thought the secret is out now. You may want to make reservations. This small and intimate place has limited seating and fills up fast. This is not your ordinary Thai restaurant.  Each plate is a work of art served in a progressive style of unique combination of food to tantalize the taste buds.  I shared several delicious plates, tender Lamb Chops, a tasty and colorful Salmon-Eggplant with Avocado dish, a crunchy and clever Spinach Salad, and a tapas Golden Pouch that looked like a wrapped gift.  Everything was a culinary delight.  By far this is one of my favorite Thai restaurants."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS! Been here 3 times now...twice for dine in and once for takeout.  To name a few dishes...drunken noodle, volcano shrimp, and fried avocado. Flavors for all were spot on, the tempura batter was perfect.  For the take out we just reheated a little in oven for a few minutes on the avocado and shrimp and it did not ruin the tempura.  We also microwaved the drunken noodle just a little bit and did not spoil the texture of noodles. Just noting here in case you live a little distance and are concerned on reheating. Looking forward to trying some other dishes.  Thank you Nittaya for creating great dishes!! You are a gem!"}
{"text":"This place is about 20 minute or so away from the strip. I been searching and wanting to try something different in Vegas. This came up in my search and decided to bookmark it to try. I ended up making reservations about two weeks in advance. It was really busy when we got there so it is better to have one than have to wait. 

The parking was super easy. I really like the feel of the place. Nothing too fancy, kind of remind me of a regular Thai place. 

What we ordered: 
World famous spinach salad-this thing was so good. It was just spinach tempura but the sauce is so good. It has a little kick to it. The spice and the limey taste really made the dish stand out. 

Crab roll-these were good. I thought the price was kind of high for the four rolls we got, however, they were yummy. 

Salmon-Avocado Curry-I really enjoys this dish. It had a green curry with a big piece of salmon with eggplant, zucchini, and avocado. You can change it to any protein you like. I decided to stick to the salmon cause that's what they are known for. This was worth the $24 price tag. 

Crying Tiger Steak-grilled rib eye steak was just okay. We would pass on this dish next time. 

Service-Great 

Overall, I would come back for the spinach salad again!"}
{"text":"Made a reservation here.  When we arrived no one acknowledged or greeted us.  Stood at the front by the bar for 5+ minutes with no acknowledgement.  Left without eating."}
{"text":"Great restaurant. Very cozy. Excellent service especially Josh. The food was amazing. Our waitress recommended the spinach salad. It is tempura spinach (how do they do that) and it has great flavor and the dipping sauce was perfect with it. We also tried garlic ribs, potstickers, pad Thai, cashew shrimp all were excellent. Desserts were just as amazing. Try the Thai donuts and the crime brûlée trio."}
{"text":"Went here for dessert one night ... It was a small little place , cute inside , took a look at the dinner menu as well as we were seated and it looks just crazy pricey for Thai food! We had the bread pudding and the doughnuts ... Very tasty!!! But also very pricey... Won't be returning because of the prices unfortunately"}
{"text":"I can't believe it's taken me this long to write a review of Nittaya's secret kitchen. This is absolutely, by far, the best Thai restaurant in Las Vegas. My favorite meal here starts with the lemongrass coconut soup with shrimp. It's a flavor explosion in your mouth. Then I follow it up with the panang catfish. The baby bok choy are super tender and the sauce on the catfish is terrific. Last time I was there I switched it up and got the salmon with the avocado sauce. Avocado sauce turned me off at first but I tried it anyway. It was spicy and delicious. The only thing that reminded me of avocado was the color of the sauce and a sliced fresh avocado on top. The Thai Michelin star cheff over on the east side is not even close to as good as this restaurant. Well Don Nittaya!"}
{"text":"We love this place. Order a ton of different things. The noodles, the shrimp, the fiery noodles. Can't stop eating!!!"}
{"text":"Quaint and cozy little restaurant. Excellent food, reasonable prices, lovely atmosphere, attentive staff who were readily available for recommendations. Enjoyed our time here and we will be back!"}
{"text":"I don't usually give out 5 star ratings but this one kind of deserves it. We got 4 different dishes and I loved them all. 2 tapas, 1 curry, and 1 dessert. I've been to a few tapas joints but none are worthy of my 5 star rating. This is as best as it gets for both Thai and tapas :)! It's also definitely 2 $$s.

Absolutely no complaints about service either. This is also a very cozy little place so there's not a lot of room. It'll be a lot more busier during dinner time because of the small space. It's got dim lighting but it's a very peaceful environment especially with the soft music. The servers are ultra polite, professional, and friendly. You also get a special type of water but not sure if you can really taste it. If they didn't tell me at the beginning I don't think I would have noticed it at all. Ours had apple and something else (not sure) but I really couldn't taste it -- but that's not really important, I suppose :b.

WHAT WE ORDERED:
Cilantro Steak Skewers
(BBQ) Thai Wings
Duck Breast Curry
Family Style Coconut Ice Cream (has sticky rice)

THEY'RE ALL GOOD :)! So feel free to try them. Good as in I'd totally get them again. Heard some good things about the mango shrimp so I'll give that a try next time!"}
{"text":"Good food hidden off of Lake Mead!  Big variety of food to please everyone.  Make a reservation on the weekend, it is busy!"}
{"text":"More than excellent......superb!
The salad was a pleasant surprise and the veggie pot sticker a real bonus!
Can't wait to return ....."}
{"text":"Food was delicious. I didn't try any of their wine, but the flavors of everything else were spot-on. Be aware, however, it's a tight space, and rather classy, so it was awkward having our toddler there with us. It's rather far from our house, so we probably won't be back anyway."}
{"text":"The definition of a hidden gem.  When my friend and I walked in, he immediately said he felt like he had been transported to a different place than Las Vegas.  The atmosphere is great.  Very dark, chic and kind of romantic.

The service was pretty good.  We ordered fairly quickly and we were never lacking for water.  The food came out quickly with the exception of one dish that basically came after we were done eating.

Now lets get to the food.  Very high quality with intense flavors.  The entrees and tapas are expensive but you get quite a bit for your buck and seriously the flavor is so good you won't care how much it costs.  The spinach salad is a must have.  YOU MUST GET THIS.  The sauce it comes with I could drink.  The mussels are pretty good too.  We added the coconut sauce it comes with to our soup, it was so good.  I did not like the homemade ice cream.  It was flavorful but very icy and grainy.  

Definitely worth a try.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing! The ambiance is suitable for a causal dining with friends after a day of shopping or it's perfectly romantic for a nice date night. The food is also amazing! The Manfriend and I (the man in the picture stuffing his face on my profile) LOVE the noodle dishes, emerald rice, and the basil chicken pot stickers called the secret stickers. We used to go once a week but toned that down a bit to twice a month. Honestly I've never tried anything terrible - well except I was not a fan of the shrimp dishes (bacon wrapped shrimp or the shrimp tom yum soup)."}
{"text":"Spinach salad is a must try.  Pad thai is good, not as good as Lotus of Siam.  Pad see ew tastes similar to Pin Kaow.  Really good thai iced tea.  Pricier than most thai restaurants.

Service is good and fast.  Decor is lovely.  I will probably go once in a while but since Pin Kaow is nearby, this will not be a regular place for me."}
{"text":"Only two words can describe my latest experience here... Oy & Vay. 

The food that I had was quite delicious (lettuce wraps, pineapple fried rice, chicken skewers, garlic edamame) so that's why they earned 3 stars. 
The deduction, however, comes from the HUGE communication problem with the chefs when it comes to making changes due to food allergies. Lost in translation, maybe? 

Listen carefully, if you can not eat shellfish, dairy, gluten, etc. you may want to pass on dining here. Two of the friends I came with have severe (life threatening) food allergies and have never felt so frustrated, annoyed and disappointed while dining out before. It was made crystal clear about the allergies and yet two dishes were still served to them with the allergic ingredients in them. The server seemed to think it was funny, but we didn't find the humor in it. Then our food was cleared away before we were even finished eating it. To make matters worse, when I mentioned it to him, he just laughed it off again. Sadly, nothing was ever compensated from our bill, and two of the girls ordered pizza when they got home. Dinner fail."}
{"text":"OMG where do I start!  Cute little place.  The staff was great!  I am a rigid Pad Thai girl but the menu was very interesting!  We started with the Spinach Salad (tempura spinach), then the crispy pork belly, next the phuket  poppers and finally the drunken noodles!  Everything was awesome...in the order I listed :)  I really liked the infused water as well."}
{"text":"Great Thai in a romantic setting. Perfect for a date night! Make sure to call ahead for reservations, this place isn't very big and it's popular! The Spinach Salad was GREAT!"}
{"text":"Wow that is so good .. Amazing food .. No wonder a lot people here to get a table ... Thank you for food .."}
{"text":"This place is too cute. It looks like any old restaurant in Vegas from the outside. Once you step in, it is such a cozy vibe! We ordered mostly appetizers and they were all delicious! Great place for an intimate date or just a place to drink wine, eat and hang out with your girls."}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite spots! You just can't go wrong with the exotic mix of flavors! We try to mixing up every time but the spinach salad and the avocado curry are just a few of our favorites! You won't be disappointed! Ever!"}
{"text":"TL;DR Don't get the drunken noodle. Don't get any noodles. Stick to fried rice or curry. Get the world famous spinach salad, but stay away from the thai ice tea.

This place for me was meh for me. Everything was great until I had the thai ice tea then it started going downhill.  

World Famous Spinach Salad: Rating: 5/5 The best part of the meal. Really good. If you com here, you have to get the world famous spinach salad. Come with an appetite as it will fill you up. Who knew spinach would be so good deep fried. 

Thai Ice Tea Rating 2/5 I expected better. It came in a wine glass instead of a tall glass. Honestly it wasn't that great, but at least it wasn't fake thai tea made from powder. I always get thai ice tea as it is a staple drink for any thai place. Meh #1.

Crying Tiger Steak Rating: 4/5 The sauce was very good with the steak. Medium rare. I feel like one of the best thing here is the sauce.

Drunken Noodle Rating: 1/5 Honestly this ruined my entire dining experience. Not only did it come out last and late compared to the crying tiger steak, but it was soggy and falling apart. I would stick a fork into the noodle and it would fall apart from it's own weight. Not only that, it was too salty, and the sauce flavor destroyed the entire dish. The only thing you could taste was the salty sauce. I talked to a waiter about it and he said it should be like that. What it tastes like is like leftover drunken noodle plates were recycled and recooked into my plate with some extra sauce to cover up the recooking process. I wouldn't even feed that to my dog. He might die from the sodium overload."}
{"text":"Nittaya makes the best Thai cuisine I've ever had. I used to go to Pin Kaow until I found Nittaya's secret kitchen. Reservations are recommended. This place fills up fast!"}
{"text":"Love love love Nittaya's kitchen. It is wonderful to have such a good place that is close to home and convenient! The food is delicious and the service has always been great. The atmosphere is pretty and cozy, definitely feel like staying awhile and sipping a cocktail or a glass of wine! It's a must if you love Thai food and it's a great date night spot."}
{"text":"Great food and at a reasonable price.  Pretty amazing, considering the atmosphere is so fancy."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant for lunch and found it to be very cozy and warm the food was delicious and the service was very good."}
{"text":"We sat out side for 15 mins with our mom and wouldn't let us even sit inside to stay cool
I would not go to this place"}
{"text":"What a great place! I can't believe I've been living in Summerlin for 3 years, and just started coming to Nittaya's... 

The food here is not exactly authentic Thai, but the flavors and the dishes are incredible! The noodles are delicious, but come here for the appetizers/tapas! Tapas are good for sharing, and I've heard their potstickers and wings are delicious!  I ordered the Secret Spinach Salad....which, despite the name, is not at all a healthy dose of spinach. It's crispy fried spinach with an awesome tangy light dressing that is just a tad bit spicy....it's incredible. I also ordered the Crab Meat Fried Rice, which was very tasty and had some good chunks of crabmeat :) 

I will definitely be back to try some more dishes.  Decor is dark & romantic. Service is solid. Only thing is they don't really like to make substitutions/changes to the menu (ie we asked to remove the fried egg from the bangkok fried rice, but the waitress said no)."}
{"text":"We came here for New Years and was not disappointed .. We expected to have to wait since it was a holiday but they were able to seat us right away! The food was delicious and the service wasn't bad either .. The server assistants were very quick to refresh our waters and food came on a timely manner and was very fresh.. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I have been to Nittaya's on a number of occasions after my first visit and it's as good as it's always been.

My first few visits were exclusively for dinner and they serve great options, but recently I've tried their lunch menu and they offer some exceptional meals at a good value. My favorites are the drunken noodles and any of their curries but I haven't had one thing at Nittaya's. The fried spinach salad is always a favorite and despite not usually liking deep fried food, this dish is always a treat.

The restaurant is small so reservations are always suggested."}
{"text":"This was a rare find. Loved every little bit of this place. The Servise was impeccable. The food was five stars. They even put the napkin on your lap"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! I have been there several times, and I have never had a meal I didn't love.  They have small plates as well as full meals, but I am a fan of the small plates... that way I get to taste more things! Their Spinach Salad is really fun - it is actually tempura battered spinach leaves. They also have this yummy dessert with mango slices and sticky rice... very simple, and the perfect end to a perfect meal. 
Anyhow - I recommend this place - I think you'll enjoy it!"}
{"text":"Shhhhh...don't tell anyone because this is a secret kitchen.  I have had this restaurant bookmarked for awhile because I kept reading about the world famous spinach salad.  I love spinach.  And I love anything deep fried.  It is a match made in heaven.  

I met a friend for lunch here and upon entering we were impressed with the elegant and serene atmosphere. We decided to start off with the spinach salad to share, and each ordered from the $11 lunch menu.  

I now understand why this spinach salad is \"world famous\".  It was delicious.  Perfectly crispy, and the larb/lime dressing that accompanied it was fantastic.  I would eat salads (even non deep fried ones) everyday if I could pour that dressing on it.  

I ordered the Basil Eggplant and it also came with a small salad a potsticker, and my friend went with the classic Chicken Pad Thai. Everything was beautifully presented. And more importantly, tasted delicious.  I had stuffed myself silly with the spinach salad, but could not resist licking my entree plate clean.  My dish automatically comes at a spice level of 1 (on a scale of 5) and I upped to a 3 to give it that perfect kick. 

The service was sweet and friendly. Our fruit infused water glasses were never empty. 
Thanks Nittaya! I'l be back! Can't wait to come back and try the tapas and wine!!"}
{"text":"First time visitor, lifetime customer. Crying Tiger! Crying Tiger! Crying Tiger! 
If you love Thai food, if you've been to Bangkok or Phuket or Thailand at all, you will love this place. Smaller dining room, friendly servers. I have to remember to set aside 1 hour lunch time. Love it."}
{"text":"This place was cool , cozy, mood lighting was awesome... The food by far was amazing.. AVOCADO FRIES ARE YUMMMMMMMMM AND SECRET DUMPLINGS... The waitress was cool and nice.  
The only problem was the couple nxt to us, they were arguing about non-sense and making small scenes (go home and do that) 
Overall i will def. go again."}
{"text":"When I am sick, their coconut milk broth is the only thing I want.  Owner is always there, cooking, placing fresh flowers.  Food is great, a little higher priced for the portions but sit at the bar, there is always someone nice and interesting to talk to.  They are closed on Sundays, and do zero advertising - it is all literally word of mouth so that tells you a bit about the place.  Great place to take family in from out of town or just get out for a night.  Nittaya makes the best mango sticky rice, but only when mango is in season."}
{"text":"Great place. Probably offers the best Thai food in Las Vegas. Mr. Wynn, one of our senators, zdogMD (sorry zdog, but I've seen you there twice), and other famous locals like to dine at Nittaya's. My favorite dishes are: tuna tartar, basil eggplant, catfish, and naked shrimp. Thai doughnuts is a good dessert choice."}
{"text":"Stopped here for grabbing a quick lunch. Ordered two appetizers recommended by our server, the tempura spinach was good while the volcano shrimp was way too sour. I wanna try their duck curry dish but unfortunately they ran out of duck that day. They have a lunch special menu so we opted for pineapple fried rice and massaman curry chicken. Both weren't impressed. Service was good."}
