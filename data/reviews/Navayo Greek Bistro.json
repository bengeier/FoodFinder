{"text":"Chicago style Gyro is a must have! In house made fries remind me of a resort style taste. Everything is made fresh and by hand for the daily dinner rush."}
{"text":"Enjoyed dinner here recently. My husband had the homemade Greek sausage--delicious and a little bit different, not spicy but with a distinct seasoning. I had the breaded and deep-fried calamari (also available grilled), which was also good. Entrees come with the traditional Greek potatoes, rice, and Greek salad. We thought the rice was especially good, and appreciated the fact that the salad was separately plated. The host and the server were both very friendly and helpful. Currently the menu is divided between Greek dishes and American ones (burgers and so on) which is probably sensible while they're getting established. As time goes by, I hope to see additional Greek classics like moussaka. A welcome addition to a strip that doesn't have a lot of restaurants."}
{"text":"Recently went here after a food shortage at home. Amazing food! Food was served fast, and was delicious! I had the chicken souvlaki and my father had the beef souvlaki. The beef was succulent, and cooked to perfection. The chicken tasted like it was made with magic.  The atmosphere was very relaxing. The ambience was perfect, and the restaurant was clean and presentable. Staff are really friendly and if you're lucky, you'll be asked by Peter the Owner about your experience.  Overall, an amazing Tuesday night in the food department. I 110% recommend this place. No need to go to Greektown anymore!"}
