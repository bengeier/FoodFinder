{"text":"New owners and food is awful.  It is the worst Chinese food I have ever had.  colored artificial sauces with no taste and the greasiest egg rolls Ive ever seen.    We ordered take out and had to throw out the food."}
{"text":"Used to go there all the time.  Tonight, I ordered 3 dishes, nothing unusual, at 7pm.  They said 40minutes so I stayed home and waited, until 8:20 when I finally left with what turned out to be the wrong order, poorly cooked and an order of potstickers an hour old as a gift for waiting.  I fear this place is dead.  It used to be so good."}
{"text":"I would rate the food, but since my order never arrived I don't know if it is good or bad. I can say that the service is terrible. After waiting 45 mintues for an order we were told would take 20 minutes, we called and were told it was OUR mistake, and it would take 45 mintues.  After 45 minutes we called again. This time he should be there \"any minute\" After an hour we called again. After getting the manager to admit that the driver had been in an accident, we offered to go pick the food up if they could remake it (its been over an hour since we called). They REFUSED to remake the food even if we came to pick it up. This is not a place i could recommend to anyone based on the way they treat paying customers."}
{"text":"Exceeded expectations!  Although atmosphere is very generic, the food was really good...  Big fan of Kung Pao Chicken and usually do not finish at other places because of excessive veggies and very little chicken.  Joe's had the perfect amount of chicken and veggies!  Delish!  I also like the fact that they cook to order right up front.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I was sad to see they had closed a year ago. By luck, I found out that they reopened. After over a year, the food was still as good as ever. They have an A health inspection posted on their door. I had the lunch special Mongolian beef. Egg drop soup was fantastic. All I can say is.. I'm never going to pei Wei again. The only negative was that the server seemed to have trouble keeping track of 4 tables but I can forgive that. Keep it up, guys."}
{"text":"20 minutes after eating at this place I had to run home and Purge my bowels don't know what they put in that crap but man it does not stay with you food wasn't that great service sucked prices were high went there one time and only one time never going back"}
{"text":"menu is lacking and no atmosphere.  much better places to go to around there but if you have to I guess you could no worse."}
{"text":"I and a friend stopped by Tasty Joe's for dinner today. We got three different dishes, all with chicken and white rice -  Eggplant Tofu in Garlic Sauce (Chinese Eggplant, Tofu, Scallion in Tangy Garlic Sauce)  Stir-Fry Mixed Vegetables  (Garlic Ginger Wine Sauce, Broccoli, Carrot, Zucchini, Napa Cabbage, Celery, Mushroom)  Cousin Thai (Chili Pod, Onion, Scallion, Red Pepper, Peanut, Cilantro)  The mixed- veggies were tasty, if nothing mind-blowing. My friend really liked the Cousin Thai, and I will be making a repeat vist, because their Eggplant Tofus is made of *delicious*."}
{"text":"A few months ago I would have given this place 5 stars. But with their significant decrease in portion size with no reduction in price, I can't even give it 4 stars. When I eat here I usually get take-out because the atmosphere is not great. I would recommend it for take-out but not dining in."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time and it was super good. We've been looking for an Asian restaurant in this area so we will definitely go again :) we had the cashew chicken and the happy family chef special and egg rolls. Yum!"}
{"text":"This place is a really good spot for lunch they have $5 lunch specials a different special each day today Wednesday was kung pao chicken fried rice egg roll crab Puffs and egg drop soup can beat it definitely adding it to the lunch rotation."}
{"text":"Outstanding meal, excellent service! We'll definitely be back. New owners with a better menu."}
{"text":"Had to visit a medical center in East Mesa, so I yelped for what was nearby,  and found this. The line was long but moved pretty quickly, and the smiling girl was very nice and excited to help me.  I waited for a short time for the food, and was not disappointed,  the flavor was tasty and not overbearing and the veggies were very fresh.  Great time,  if I'm out here I will come again."}
{"text":"Every time I walk into Tasty Joe's, I feel as though I am in a chain restaurant.  The place is laid out like it is ready for franchising:   The menu is posted on the wall and is very limited.  You walk up to a cashier and place your order.   The table layout is very predictable.  Very neutral decor (lacks ethnic flair).  Again, very chain-like.    However, the food is very fresh - everything is made to order. I've tried five different dishes and have generally been pleased.  The only thing that keeps me from giving a higher rating is that something is missing from each dish.  Some basic seasoning, whether it be salt, soy sauce, or pepper needs to be added.  Another way of syaing it would to that there is no \"pop\" to the food.  Portions are generous and prices are very reasonable.  All-in-all, Tasty Joe's is going to stay on my list of places to go."}
{"text":"For years, my husband has been wanting to stop by here.  \"Tasty Joe's,\" he would say. \"It must be good. The name wouldn't lie.\" Now we live down the road, so it seemed like a good time to give them a try. First of all, I am always nervous about Chinese takeout. Will the price be right. Will the food taste nastier than a squid's behind? So, of course, I come onto Yelp.  The good reviews were enough that it was worth a try. So, we met up with a friend to try it out.   Yes, it's a bit fast foodish in atmosphere, but I went in expecting that. My friend and I both ordered the orange chicken. I ordered crab puffs, and my husband ordered a spicy dish. When the menu here says spicy, believe it.  My husband's order was definitely spicy. Not scorching. But, a little more than expected.  We agreed that the orange chicken was wonderful. Although, next time, I will be asking if I can substitute noodles  for the brown rice.   Everything we had was great.  The only problem was the odd sauce used to did the puffs and the eggrolls into. BTW, the eggrolls were little, but yummy. They live up to the name. Definitely tasty.  We have found someplace within walking distance for Chinese takeout."}
{"text":"The flavor of the food was amazing. I thought it was way better than pei wei. They put more vegetables in their dish and I feel like I get more for my money. The people working there are so friendly. I will come here again for sure. Thanks for great service!"}
{"text":"Yikes! Tasty Joe's was not very tasty.   I tried this place for the first time and was not impressed.  I either went on an a very off day or my taste buds exceed that of the approving reviewers.  The potstickers were severely FRIED and without any flavor. The dipping sauce was flavorless. Are potstickers not usually boiled, steamed or light pan fried?  There was an odd burnt or chemical taste/smell associated with the Thai noodle bowl. (almost like the cooktop had a considerable build up of bad oil and other things?  I ate perhaps (3) three bites from the pad thai noodle bowl. I could not choke down anymore.   I did something I have not done in years, I left the food on the table.  Feeling guilt over the ensuing wastefulness and anger at having wasted the money.  My friends singapore noodles was one of the most vile tasting concoctions I have tried.  The woman behind the counter was very nice and accomodating however."}
{"text":"Good food. Good price. Great service. Easy to customize your dish. Try the firecracker!"}
{"text":"Several steps above Pei Wei - I come here for lunch frequently.  The Singapore Noodles are great, as are many of their stir frys.  Locally owned and operated!  This place has many regulars, I know of one couple that eats there every day!"}
{"text":"Ok. I used to get the lunch specials - They are soooooo gooooood.  After coming here for years, I decided to try something different. Wow, I should have tried this sooner.  First, I tried the house special Egg Foo Young. I have been to quite a few China Town's in my travels. San Fran, Toronto, and others. And I have always tried Egg Foo Young at all these places. And they were all good. But the \"house special\" one at Tasty Joe's, is by far the best I have had.  Next, I tried the \"House Special\" Lo Mein. It is really good too.  Now I have more choices. I love this place. And run by a really nice Chinese woman, we call \"Z\". Beautiful lady, and classy.  So many choices, so little time.  Two words: Eat Here!"}
{"text":"MEH  Nothing special, food was just ok.  Agree with Tyler M assessment.  Person managing on Sunday afternoon was rude to customers."}
{"text":"I walked in and wasn't greeted, so we waited up front to be seated. Once we were seated, we gave our drink orders. I wish he would've told us his name, or gave us a recommendation but that's okay. We ordered our food and they catered to our add-ons which was great. We started with egg rolls which weren't that great, spare ribs, which were ok, and the wontons, great crispy taste but I wouldn't order again. I had the veggie stir fry and added shrimp, told them to make it spicy. So yummy! So my meal was great but the appetizers we ordered weren't my favorite. There are other Chinese restaurants that are better but this place was good. Would probably go again, but not my top choice."}
{"text":"Solid Chinese food! Each time we go the food is good. Very consistent. BBQ pork fried rice is excellent."}
{"text":"I would say this is the best Asian food I have found since moving to Mesa a year ago. I was afraid to order egg foo young because I've have been disappointed every where I've tried it around here. The waiter told me it takes a little time because they make it fresh. I was a little nervous as I never was told that anywhere before. It turned out to be well worth the wait. I've never had egg foo young that was light and fluffy. The taste was very good. The only thing I would have liked to see is more bean sprouts in them. My husbands General Taos Chicken was different than he's had elsewhere but was also good. If you are looking for ambiance this will not be the place for you. If you want good food and friendly service I would highly recommend it.   I will be back."}
{"text":"Great chinese food!  The owner used to be one of the primary chefs for PF Changs or something.  Their Cantonese sweet and sour is the best I've had.  Very reasonable and very good."}
{"text":"Tasty Jose is that exactly in their name tasty Jose  Chinese take out and sit in restaurant food quick service wonderful taste"}
{"text":"One of my buddies took me here one day.  I've driven past it a few times and thought the name didn't sound like Chinese Food.  So when he suggested it, I was a little skeptical.  Wow...was I wrong.  The food was fantastic!  The restaurant was very clean (cleaner than my kitchen), service was great.  Very much like Pei-Wei in that you seat yourselves and eat with silverware.  The \"don't judge a book by it's cover\" adage seemed true here.  In this case, the name.  Tried the Orange Chicken, Chow Fun Bowl, Lettuce wraps.  All great."}
{"text":"Been here several times already, and I always wanna come back for more! All of the food is really fresh and delicious. Restaurant is very clean. People are very friendly and provided great customer service. You can't really ask for anything more. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"My quest to find good General's chicken ended here. By far the most flavorful and the dinner portions are huge. Lunch portions are also plenty big enough, but it's the amount of flavor that I haven't found elsewhere. This is the only place I'll go now!!"}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant since it opened about 5 years ago (I think).  I love noodles, and this place has really good noodles!  I usually get the singapore noodles with tofu and shrimp.  This is my favorite place when ordering tofu.  My husband usually gets the mongolian beef.  We also love the chicken and potato entree and lettuce wraps.  USUALLY the food is perfect, but there have been a couple of times when the food was \"just\" good, possibly due to a different chef of something.    We usually order about once a month or so as we do not regularly dine out.  This is my favorite place for Asian food and/or noodles."}
{"text":"I have to coming here since they opened up and I think the food is delicious and the service is great. I have never had any complaints with anything and it is very convenient."}
{"text":"the food is excellent BUT the service including the manager is poor. The woman in charge is rude and always in a hurry. There is no customer service from her. If you want good food yes, if you want a enjoyable evening NO! The owner, she is just rude............"}
{"text":"My parents live put in the East Valley, and my dad really wanted some Chinese food. It didn't look like I had very many options so I thought I'd give this place a shot despite of the Yelp rating. That was my mistake.   We had a party of 5 and were seated promptly! That was a good thing since we were all hungry.   We ordered appetizers right away, and when they came out they were hot. They gave us both hot mustard sauce & a sweet and sour sauce. The chicken egg rolls were no flavor & mushy. Not edible at all! The ribs I didn't even try them but they looked okay. I did try the crab ragoons that were only cream cheese filled.  The best part of my meal was the entree. ordered the stir-fry veggies with shrimp that was good."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch around 11:00. I'm not an Asian food expert. There are only a few places I've eaten at because I've had issues with gristly meat at several. It makes me leery to try new places. I ordered the lunch special ($5) which was chicken Kung Pao. It comes with egg ribbon soup, spring roll, and a crab puff. I usually only have one sip of the soup because it's flavorless at most places. This one had chicken broth that tasted just like my Grammy's chicken broth. You could tell it didn't come from bouillon. I ate almost the whole thing and would've but I was too full by the end. The other thing I liked tremendously was the spring roll. Again, not something I usually care for but this one had the lightest, crispiest crust. It tasted so fresh and light. I've never had better. The crab puff was as expected, all cream cheese, no crab. The only ones I've ever had that actually have crab are the ones from Pei Wei (like I said, I only eat at a few places regularly and this is one). The Kung Pao was also good but I've never had it before so not sure how it compares to other places. What stood out is that the chicken was very tender and there were actual vegetables! So many Chinese places skimp on the veggies. I liked the large chunks of celery, zucchini and bell pepper. I also ordered a yummy ice tea which tasted fresh and home made. I left there stuffed and will definitely go back again to try some of the other dishes."}
{"text":"Having eaten here a few months back, I was surprised at the \"Grand Opening\" sign.  Same name, new owners I guess.  And whereas before you ordered at the counter and then sat down, they now seat you and take your order at the table like a full-service restaurant.  Staff was pleasant but I was rather unimpressed with the food.  You do get a good value for your money, however.  For $6 you get soup, 2 wontons, 1 egg roll, and a lunch portion of your dish with fried rice.  Personally, I'd rate the quality of the food a little above Panda Express and a little below Pei Wei.  I got the chicken lo mein and it was all right, but didn't have great flavor and the whole meal felt a bit cheap.  BUT... it was inexpensive, so that's why the 3 stars instead of 2.  You do get what you pay for.  For anyone wondering, they are currently working on their liquor license so that they will be able to serve alcohol in the future."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised to find a decent Chinese restaurant in Mesa! Food was good overall. I will be back! General chicken was not what I expected, but was delicious and the have the sauce right!"}
{"text":"First time here under the new ownership,  the wait staff is very attentive which I'm not used to for most Chinese restaurants. The menu has a nice variety and something you never see, I'll paraphrase so forgive me \"if there is something not on the menu you would like let us know ands we'll be glad to make it\"! I ordered the special which is asparagus stir fry, which comes with egg flower soup and steamed rice, i also ordered fried dumplings (10). The dumplings seem to be the standard frozen kind not terrible but definitely not made in house, to kick up the dipping sauce I added hot oil which is available. The egg flower soup was delicious served steaming hot. The special was served very hot portion size is a little large so you could share,  the asparagus and shrimp cooked perfectly and tasted fantastic, I like it spicy so added hot oil. Definitely will be coming back if they maintain these standards"}
{"text":"Well ...... newly reopened apparently. New owners. The service people were very nice but unable to handle all the tables very timely. They need more staff. food was meh.    Don't think I'd go back."}
{"text":"My daughter and I like to go here for lunch. The food is fantastic. I love the hot n sour soup, but it is $2.00 more to substitute it for the regular soup. They also don't serve any kind of wanton chips that I like to put in my soup. We always get the Kung Pao chicken-my fav! And she gets the orange chicken. Great lunch prices and will fill you right up!"}
{"text":"Very nice place I like the food I like everything about it. in the front of the restaurant there is a huge fish tank with pretty fish. The food was fantastic I had orange chicken, BBQ pork fried rice, lo mien chicken noodles chow mein dumplings everything was really tasty. If ever I am in Mesa again it's gonna be on."}
{"text":"Been there 3 times in a month.  Excellent service.  Family place and takeout. Best by far is General Tsou chicken along with their soups.  A very pleasant spot at a reasonable price"}
{"text":"Yucky Lunch had just ended. So we would have to order off the dinner menu.  Tea wasn't offered.  Hot & sour soup was good. But then the orange chicken arrived - was it microwaved ? Left over from the lunch rush and sold at a dinner price? Swishy no crunchy & questionable? It wasn't hot !  Not like the freshly made Kung pao that arrived - which was perfect!  The white rice was sticky & the size of a small custard dish - it also was moderately warm!  When finally asked & told that the food was not hot - it was our fault.... We were sorry we mentioned it!  Did the food make us sick or the $18.63 on not very tasty food Joe !?!  We won't be back!"}
{"text":"Straight up affordable and yummy Chinese. Accommodated my shrimp allergy and still brought a side of it for my husband to get it for his soup. It was a small touch but it made all the difference. The combination dinner was plenty to eat and we had leftovers!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat. The food is the best we found anywhere. Staff very, very friendly. They make you feel like family just as soon as you walk in the door."}
{"text":"It's so average that it's tough to really go for or against it. It's just the most basic Chinese food I've ever had. Not great, but not bad. Super affordable, and big portions!   I went for a late lunch on a Wednesday and it was slow. There is some good Thai and other Asian options in the area, but if you want \"ok\". It's at this place."}
{"text":"Decent Chinese, we get takeout there on occasion.  Probably the best of the Asian food in the East valley that we have found."}
{"text":"The food is great, the portions are good and the price is right.  The lady who runs the place is very sweet.   Its not fun listening to multiple customers complain about how cheap the owners.  I've been here quite a few times and had to wait a rather long time for my food because they are under staffed.  I'd recommend they invest in some additional labor, and equipment repairs (men's restroom, HVAC).     I'd like to see this place succeed because the food is GREAT and the staff is very nice."}
{"text":"At first glance it is hard to tell if this place is open or not however as I approached the building I knew it was. For some odd reason I can't figure out why there is an industrial swamp cooler in a new building that obviously has a new air conditioner. Thank god I am pleased with the food quality. I had Kung Pao Chicken and an order of pot stickers. Both were very good. I would have given this place 4 full stars but in ARIZONA as a restaurant you run your air conditioner not a swamp cooler."}
{"text":"This place is horrible, their combo plater is 4 options, ended up ordering fried rice, egg roll and quart of wonton soup.   The soup was the worst, 4 wonton and soup was watered down, almost clear, tasted horrible Little to no flavor, will never go back there again, a combo with chicken and lo mein is almost $20.   Stay away, almost nobody in the place"}
{"text":"Unfortunately this is one of the better Chinese places I've been to in east Mesa, which in it of itself is a ridiculously low bar. I had the pork fried rice and general tsao's chicken--the rice was tolerable, but the chicken was soggy and disappointing."}
{"text":"Services was amazing and so was the food and cleanliness of the restaurant.  I'm from Cali and come to AZ from time to time.  This is my new Asian restaurant spot that I will go to.  Family owned and ran, very attentive to their customers, service with a smile and the food was great!"}
{"text":"Great Service , Food was ready when I got there. Employee was very Friendly, and portions were large enough for the next day, very tasty also affordable. will be going back"}
{"text":"New owners now. Warning! This is not the Tasty Joe's of old. They don't do the good old stir fry anymore. The food was VERY bland and I had kung pao chicken. That dish should never be bland. I was excited when I saw the grand opening sign and the same name, thinking it was going to be the same thing. Very, very disappointed."}
{"text":"Went in for the lunch special to go. The waiter shows me the menu which includes crab cake, spring roll and soup. I get everything but the soup. The owner tells me soup isn't on the to go menu and wants to charge me an extra $2 for a tiny soup, even though the waiter admits he made me a mistake. I'm never coming back to this tightwad place again."}
{"text":"We liked the old the old Tasty Joes, but their service got pretty bad in their last year. We tried the new version the other night and it was quite good. It was obvious they still had a little start up awkwardness, but the attentive server and food made up for it. I look forward to another visit very soon!  Update:  After 3 more visits, we have determined that Tasty Joes is our favorite Asian food restaurant. Good service, good food, and reasonable prices...what more could you ask for? :)"}
{"text":"One word - AMAZING!   The owner is a peach, such a sweet girl! Very generous portions! I personally love the Mongolian beef, ask for it spicy, she will hook you up!   Very clean inside which is VERY important to me! All around great local joint! I'm not sure why I'm just writing a review now as I'm a repeat customer!"}
{"text":"The food is no different than any other typical chinese restaurant, but the service was terrible.  They acted like they were doing me a favor being there and that we were a major inconvenience.  We ordered the lunch specials and the waitress told us the soup would be out later, but she never brought it.  also. the cokes we ordered came in small glasses that were filled with ice.  No problem, i thought.  Wrong.  after two refills, which probably totaled most restaurants normal glass, (maybe), we were told no more refills.  Huh?  If that is the policy, it should be written or at least let the customer know before they order one.  But seriously?  how petty can you be.  They clearly don't care about the customer.  We won't be going back.  Don't waste your time.  Anywhere else will be better.  It bothers me that people treat customers that way.  They need to learn that if you don't treat people right, you won't do well."}
{"text":"I have wanted to try this restaurant for quite some time.  So glad I did as I have been looking for a great Chinese Restaurant for a very long time.  I ordered take out.  Everyone was very nice and the cook even gave me some extra crab won tons to try.  They were a real hit. I also ordered Kung Pao Chicken.  It was so delicious and one order was enough fo two meals.  For sure I will be going back.  Quality food and plenty of chicken too.  It was just perfect."}
{"text":"This place is great!  The staff here is very nice and professional! They helped me pick my selection, my first time visiting here.   The food tastes absolutely amazing! I cannot believe the amount of selections they have on their menu. I tried the Orange flavored chicken entree and it was very delicious. The meal comes with quite a bit of food too!   This place is conveniently located on the south west corner of Brown Rd and Power Rd.   The atmosphere is some what contemporary, with a little oriental touch. I love it!  I cannot wait to come here again, I think I'll try the Mongolian Beef entree next time!"}
{"text":"Didn't care for the gravy sauce they put on some of their dishes.  Food tasted different/strange to us.  We eat out about 3 times a week at all kinds of restaurants.  If we find a place we like, we go their often.  This place, we won't go back to."}
{"text":"Decent average Americanized Chinese food. The tofu teriyaki bowl isn't bad and has lots of veggies. Sadly there are slim-pickins in East Mesa."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in the phoenix area. delicious dishes with fresh ingredients, reasonably priced and friendly service. The hot and sour soup is excellent as are all the dishes I've tried so far. Really like the lo mein with chicken or veggies and usually have leftovers for lunch :)"}
{"text":"Sorry but when you've had really good Thai food up the street at Tum Nuk Thai, this place doesn't even compare.  Had the pad Thai bowl and it had very little flavor  with very few nuts.  In addition, I went on my lunch hour and waited almost 25 minutes for take out.  Not a happy camper and definitely not worth the wait.  Sorry."}
{"text":"I was pretty impressed by this place! Their prices are really great and I loved my vegetarian curry dish I ordered for take-out! It tasted fresh and reminded me a more authentic and less expensive version of Pei Wei."}
{"text":"Awesome little sit down esque place to either bring a friend or two or if you want to go have a nice quiet afternoon lunch before you go in for a shift at work. They have a great daily lunch deal and offer amazing service in addition to that. Meals come out relatively quickly and they give you bottles of sweet and sour as well as spicy mustard I believe, so if you love your sauces then they are good to keep you nice and supplied during your meal. All in all, great place to eat and enjoy your day!"}
{"text":"My favorite spot for Chinese food! I love it. Great service! Very nice & accommodating. It's a 15 minute drive but it's definitely worth it. They just reopened with new owners. Very nice people.  My favorite is their fried rice. The egg flower or egg drop soup is so tasty!"}
{"text":"Pretty good, but not on par with Pei Wei.  Nice atmospshere, good service, quality food.  It was just missing a little something I can't quite put my finger on."}
{"text":"The pot stickers were decent, but that was about it. The egg foo yong was the size and shape of a hamburger and had a texture I had never before experienced. There were no bean sprouts as far as I could tell and the gravy was something out of a dry mix for home cooks. The egg rolls and pork chop suey were all very tasteless. I am not from the Mesa area, and where I am from we have a Chinatown - so, admittedly, I'm a bit spoiled. However, this place had nothing redeeming for me.  I will say that my in-laws love this place and highly recommend their chicken cashew. I did not taste that."}
{"text":"Wow! This was unexpectedly fantastic! After reading the reviews we went in with mixed expectations, but we were actually blown away by the delicious food and warm service. Our waiter Chao was enthusiastic about the menu and engaged us in pleasant conversation throughout our meal. The food was just like the great Chinese food my husband and I had back east--me from Michigan, my hubby from Boston. To start the egg rolls were crisp and fresh and omg that mustard was HOT! Chap explained they add wasabi to it for that extra bite. The hot and sour soup was hands down the best we've had. Unlike most, it was full of flavor with shrimp, green onions, shiitakes and that wonderful tang. I'm glad I had some left over! For entrees we ordered General Tsos chicken, sweet and sour pork, and Kung Pao beef. All were delicious, but that General Tsos was unlike any other I've had. Instead of deep fried nuggets of chicken, it was large slices of chicken with a delicate batter. The sauce was homemade and a great balance of sweet, spicy, and tangy. We are so happy to have this in the neighborhood and will be back soon."}
{"text":"Get the Mongolian beef. Had a slight kick to it and the beef is very tasty. Prices are great at lunch time. Dinner plates can easily feed two."}
{"text":"Way too humid inside the place.  Food was average, kinda cooked to death veggies and mystery meat combo.  Service was good, that's about the best it can get here."}
{"text":"This place is a must try place!!!! I have loved everything I've tried. My kids love it as well. Everyone is very nice and our drinks were never left empty. They have good deals for lunch and dinner with huge portions. After eating here you will never eat at panda again!!"}
{"text":"They take the time to get a very good meal to the table. Steamed veggies were delicious. Egg flower soup awsome. I have had lemon and orange chicken, mongollon beef, honey walnut shrimp. All were very good. 15 large shrimp"}
{"text":"I like the orange chicken personally with some crab wontons. Sometimes I will mix it up and get the sweet and sour. Food is always delicious. People are very nice. If you are looking for some good Asian cuisine  I would highly recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"I went to Tasty Joe's for the first time today, and this will be my last trip.  We were there after the lunch rush and there were 5-6 dirty tables left over from lunch, but we were the only people in the restaurant. The food portions were good, but I felt the prices were too high given the quality of the food. They also used too much oil, as my broccoli tasted like old grease.  I also agree with previous reviews stating the place has an overwhelming stench of wok oil. Overall it was just disappointing."}
{"text":"I love Tasty Joes! This place is a wonderful little Thai place for takeout during the week. It's fresh, fast and can be extremely flavorful if you ask for the right hotness. I see some reviews on here comparing it to Thai restaurants, let's not compare apple to oranges. This is in the same category as Panda Express but is higher quality, better tasting, fresher and is cooked in front of you to your preferences. Delicious."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. The place was empty except for the two waitresses. The rice seemed hard, sauce overkill on the S&S pork.  No soup served with dinner. The empty pace should have been a sign. Don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Stopped next door at Piefection and saw Tasty Joes. We decided to check it out and oh are we glad we did!  We started with eggrolls and fried shrimp. The eggrolls were old school good! Great filling and flavor. The shrimp were hearty and large. They were served with a hot mustard and sweet and sour sauce carousel. Delish. By the way, SUPERIOR service and charming staff. Now the big deal.... $8.95 for a huge plate of fried rice, chow mein, and your choice of an entree. We chose sweet and sour pork and  broccoli beef. Four thumbs up!!!! We brought half of it home. Awesome food and experience. Definitely coming back over and over!!!!!"}
{"text":"This visit was great, i can not get over how kind and genuine the staff are, if you are ever in the need of some smiling faces and good food, drop in for a bite.  More importantly, the food..  I enjoy any place that gives me an asparagus option, i got it with beef, i am not sure what oil they use, but it burns so clean that i got all the seasoning flavor without it being overwhelmed by any oil tinge.  Will definitely go back.. again and again"}
{"text":"Our meals were not tasty or fresh.  Very disappointing when you are craving some good House Special Fried Rice and the beef ends up having an odd greenish purplish tinge to it.  The Happy Family was almost entirely vegetables.  I was not that happy and neither was my family.  This was our third try.  It's close to my house so I really wanted it to be great.  Sorry Tasty Joes you are chopped."}
{"text":"Couldn't be happier. My go-to chinese is General Tsao's...very nice. Perfect spice (normally made on the lighter side...ask for fire). Orange peel chicken is super flavorful. Third guest had sweet and sour chicken...again, perfect. Wait staff is super helpful and the menu is not complicated. Note: they do encourage you to ask for something special if you want something tweaked to your liking.   I would encourage you to give them a try.  /Pepsi products/Bottled Beer/Wine/Limited cocktails"}
{"text":"Food was mediocre at best,  sweet and sour chicken was greasy, tough and didn't have any pineapple or pepper chunks.  Cashew chicken, tasteless with mostly celery, hardly any chicken.  Only thing remotely good was the moo shu pork.  Decent portions, the waitress made 4 decent size moo shu tacos.  Not sure if we would go back.  Poor service, overcrowded and didn't even get our greasy egg rolls before our meals came out...."}
{"text":"Got there early and we were the only couple in the restaurant.  Needless to say service was excellent.  We started with the potstickers.  Very tasty with a soy sauce and ginger.  Ordered the chicken curry dish to split.  Also very good.  As we sat there more and more people started to arrive.  The hostess knew  a lot of them by name so it's a good sign of returning customers.  When we left the place was filled.  I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who is looking for good Chinese food."}
{"text":"This place is frustrating. Almost every dish is on the cusp of being good, but lazy dining standards ruin it. The food can be greasy for example. This won't make me shy away from eating it, but then you can taste that the grease is old. So the flavor of the grease permeates the dish and ruins they actual really good flavor a they are trying to put on a plate. Seriously, rotate your oil more often and that alone would probably take you from two to four stars."}
{"text":"As promised I have returned (not my first visit since my original review) not for my usual paid day off lunch outings, but for dinner. Tonight 10-20-17 was a particularly unusual evening, and my visit to this restaurant was like icing on the cake... so to speak. Anyways, we walked in...and were rapidly greeted and sat. The entire restaurant was busy with many people sitting and a few milling around waiting for their carry out.  Once we sat, I noticed an unusual stain on the red sheets covering the table. It sort of resembled bodily fluid that dried up, but it was on the other side of the table, so it was avoidable. After about 9 - 12 minutes of waiting, a rather goofy acting young man materialized to my left, and mumbled out... \"you guys want something to drink?\" And in somewhat disbelief, we ordered ice water..and ordered or '$8.00 dinner combos' which tonight was sweet and sour chicken. However, I ordered the Orange Chicken, which was a little bit more and came with soup and eggroll. About 15 minutes later the goof came back to me and asked if I wanted the chicken chow mein bonus option with my eggroll. In another thought of disbelief, I responded NO, I just want the eggroll with my orange chicken. The order taker dude, then walked away to their service window picked up the plate and then huddled with his young female coworker when the older lady server started to bitch him about something. Mind you he still has a plate of food in his hand....which he then walks to the side area where their garbage cans are. He then proceeds to scoop something off the plate straight into the garbage can. This took about 50 seconds... so then he walks back to the service area with that plate and proceeds to start scooping fried rice onto the plate. Guess what... it was my orange chicken. The guy then walks over to my table and proceeds to say..'orange chicken' and swiftly walks away. I push the plate back as the remnants of the chow main slime are dripping off the plate and was thickly coated on the plate. The entire plate look disheveled and pretty gross. I started to laugh...and told the old lady..take this back and just cancel my order. We asked for the next plate to boxed, we paid and left. They are now officially blacklisted in my book of options. Goodbye!"}
{"text":"Steer clear of this place! The food tastes like something you buy in the freezer section.....at the dollar store. Orange chicken was hard, cold and lacking flavor. Girlfriend had the Hunan chicken which was better than mine but not by much. Was on our way to Panda but came here instead because I'm not a big fan of Panda. Left wishing we had made it to Panda. The people that say this is better than Pei Wei or compares to it are crazy! First and last time at not-so-tasty joes!"}
{"text":"It's been a long time since I have been to this spot. It used to be a quick service restaurant but it is now full service.   My meal was solid and the service was friendly, prompt and attentive.   I had the beef and broccoli. The beef was incredibly tender and juicy. Flavor was great. The fried rice was just ok, a bit under seasoned and lacking much texture.   Great portion size and value at ~$9 for soup and entree.   Overall, I will come back for more."}
{"text":"Excellent food and authentic Asian cuisine.  Good came hot and was made exactly perfect... reminds me of east coast cooking and that's the best thing about it.  Everything was amazing.  Great place def recommend food came fast in 20 mins and piping hot.  Will order again"}
{"text":"Good, fresh chinese.  Unique flavor combos and you can order healthy here.  brown rice, steamed veggies, etc...."}
{"text":"This is in a little strip mall however, I was impressed with the atmosphere for the quality of food and the pricing.  My kid's actually discovered this place and have been going her for quite some time on a regular basis but I had never tried it before.  The kids wanted a \"to go\" order and asked if I would pick it up for them.  My daughter ordered the \"Orange Flavored Chicken\" and I'm not sure what her boyfriend ordered but they were both fantastic.  I personally preferred the Orange Chicken. Believe it or not, it was still crispy (even though it had orange sauce on it) by the time I got home with the food.  I also liked that it was all white meat.  On the website they offer free crab puffs or Pot stickers if you order 2 meals so for the first time we tried a Pot sticker and really enjoyed them.  We have always been hesitant to try them but thought since they were free, why not give them a try. They also were hot and fresh by the time we got it home and we all loved the dipping sauce..  The\" to go\" containers for the food (with sauce) that they used were also greatly appreciated.  I hate to order any food that has sauce and it ends up dumping all over the place (especially if it is in the car).  Nothing more annoying than getting the food home and have to clean up the car etc. I will definitely order from here again and would recommend it to others. The service was friendly and accommodating which is always a big plus!"}
{"text":"I came here one time years ago and was not very impressed.  I decided to give it another shot today for lunch.  I walked in and they had done some remodeling.  It looked nicer and was a nicer sit down type place now instead of a place where you order at a counter.  I ordered Kung Pao Chicken lunch special which comes with a spring roll and 2 crab wontons.  Well they forgot my spring roll and crab wontons, but the sweet and sour sauce was there.  I was really disappointed!  I didnt realize until I got the food home and I wasnt about to go back for that stuff.  2 stars because my kung pao chicken was ok, veggies werent over cooked.  Could have used more flavor and the sauce was pretty thick and gummy.  I wont be back."}
{"text":"It was right around 9pm and as we were driving to Tasty Joes we placed our take out order.  Tasty Joes is pretty consistent with the flavors.  I ordered the Mongolian Beef, the sauce was good and the heavy amount of onions were nice.  The dish was a little oily, but the flavor was still enjoyable.  The wife went with Mapo Tofu, it was good not great. The menu claims this dish is spicy but didn't have really any heat to it. We did get what we expected.  Price was about average, two entrées and an order of crab puffs for $30 after tip."}
{"text":"Tasty Joes just reopened after being closed for a year with new ownership and great tasting food. We have tried the orange peel chicken and Mongolian beef which has a hint of spice and a few other dishes at different times. The portions a a good size, let's say enough for at least 3-4 people. You won't be disappointed. A lot of people do take out also. :)"}
{"text":"New management prompted me to update this. Sadly the only thing tasty here is probably Joe. The rest of it is all pukalicious."}
{"text":"\"Tasty\" is accurate. This is Chinese for white people, but in the best way."}
{"text":"I am a fan.  Almost too much proportion wise.  The staff is pleasant, and the food is good.  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"So walking in its pretty lame, there is no ambience, no background music no nothing. Its awkwardly quiet in there. We sat down service was decent. We ordered the potstickers which I thought were very good. I got the sesame chicken with fried rice my daughter got fried rice and honestly I thought it was just so plain. The food had no flavor to it. That's what ruined the whole experience for me. The flavorless food along side a boring dining room, I wouldn't go back since there are so many other tasty options in the area."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch.  Previously tried to eat dinner there once but decided to leave because the air was too thick with oil.  Lunch today was slightly better but it's clear they have an HVAC problem.  Soda machine was out of carbonation so no soda today either.  That's kind of a one off thing so maybe not much of a knock.  On to the food...  I had some sort of chicken dish.  Don't recall the name but it was halfway decent.  The rice...not so much.  It had the consistency of Uncle Bens.  Real unusual for an Asian food place.  In that I've set the bar pretty low for Asian restaurants (mostly because I've found a bunch of mediocrity) this one clears it.  I'd probably eat here again, but it would be good if they could fix their HVAC problem."}
{"text":"Well to start off.  The atmosphere was good, wait staff was nice, but the food was mediocre to say the least.  The sweet and sour chicken and shrimp were more breaded than meat.  The BBQ pork was ok but not my style.  And we are used to combination meals that can feed a crowd.  Not used to ordering ala cart for every dish."}
