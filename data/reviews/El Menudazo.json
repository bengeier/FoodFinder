{"text":"If your heart's desire is either Mexican menudo or pozole, this is THE spot in Las Vegas! Their cuisine is authentic to the core. Make sure to try their homemade tortillas; their bolillos con mantequilla are as delicious. When you visit, ask for Arlene. She was super nice and helpful."}
{"text":"OMG, this place is great Kristin is our waiter, well the only one here right now eight booths are full of people and he's very attentive to each customer. Best waiter I ever had in Vegas. The food is delious YAAASSSS WE WILL BE BACK. Thank you Kristin."}
{"text":"The food and the service were great. I recommend it to everyone it's like eating at home fresh tortillas"}
{"text":"Menudo was great! Had the menudo Blanco with just a bit of grano, the home made tortillas were awesome, overall best place in Vegas for Menudo in my opinion."}
{"text":"Good food Mexican. Good music good service well served don't have to wait in line an foods comes out quick great place for a family dinner"}
{"text":"Good service , great pricing and amazing menudo. They also  have complimentary agua fresca and coffee. I will definitely be returning and bringing friends along."}
{"text":"menudazo has the best menudo in vegas, and possibly the best in the US. Manny is usually our server and on point, always takes great care of us!"}
{"text":"ARLENE .  Les agradecemos su buen servicio y su amabilidad  por eso una y otra vez venimos a el Menudazo por su exelente trato.."}
{"text":"Best menudo in town great food ,great service menudo blanco the best.  Like a salsa I have only seen here called salsa Sinaloa.  Very good"}
{"text":"Came here for menudo. Awesome food!!!
Will definitely be back to try the rest of the food they have. They are only open for Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. You know a place is good when they can open for only three days and sell out of most of the menu."}
{"text":"This place smells good but the food is horrible the menudo at Robertos is 1000 times better the service was great the people were nice but the food is horrible they gave us spoiled sopa de fideo , if there is something you cannot mess up in the Mexican cuisine it's should be salsa and fideo"}
{"text":"Menudo was good, hand made tortillas were better and service was Great! Arlene was professional, attentive and knowledgeable...they even boil my Menudo to a boiling point... I'll definitely go back,... specifically, after a drinking spree!"}
{"text":"the menudo taste homemade. I love it, definitely. going back. Quesadillas are great too. hits the spot when your craving traditional Mexican food."}
{"text":"The menudo here is so good. Arlene was so kind and assisted promptly. will come back next time in Vegas."}
{"text":"For those who are familiar with this traditional Mexican dish called \"Menudo\"  also known to cure hangovers, this place is amazingly delicious for that and they have the choice of white or red menudo, with your choice of home made tortillas or toasted bread  with butter, and forget to get the tall Mexican glass bottle of Coca-Cola. They also have seafood. Great place!"}
{"text":"First time trying this place. Took my wife and son today. Right when we walked In we were greeted and seated, The place was well organized and very clean even the bathrooms. I order the large size bowl of menudo and my wife had the small bowl. They were huge and delicious l. My son had the tenders and fries. Our server Lemy was very knowledge and right on point with everything. Saw when our drinks were low didn't even have to ask for refills he was right on point with everything. Arlene was very nice to us as well. We will be back again to try the other Items on the menu soon."}
{"text":"Spent a few days on the strip I needed to get the hell away and back to reality and partake in some real authentic Mexican food and we struck gold this place is got great service the staff was very friendly and actually seemed to enjoy being here and serving us and the medulla was top-notch and the tacos are a 10 out of 10"}
{"text":"Where to get menudo during the week and in Las Vegas ? Found this place and it was awesome ! The service was great we were greeted as soon as we walked in , defiantly a family friendly place . The menudo was very tasty got lots of options :) definitely will be back for more thank you again !"}
{"text":"Someone at the hotel we were staying at recommended this place for menudo, it was great, hand made tortillas and excellent menudo!! Will return again next time we visit Las Vegas :)"}
{"text":"Heads up, the hours listed on Yelp are wrong- they're expanding hours to include weekdays as of January 12! Hallelujah, now you can get your menudo fix any day of the week not just on weekends. However, I believe they'll still be closing at a ridiculously-early time of 4PM, so plan ahead.

The menudo and pozole are the highlights of this menu, both available in rojo or blanco broth- I'm only familiar with red, so that's what I had. There seemed to be minimal difference between the two soups, but I did prefer the menudo.
Unfortunately, maybe because I came in so late (2PM), both orders we received were mostly hominy, bone, and gristle/fat.  BF tossed the pozole, saying it was the greasiest he's ever had, and all of the \"meat\" it contained were pieces of fat. The broth is good, but $10 for good broth is not what I think of when I venture to this side of town.

In addition to the soups, they also offer plates, tacos, and burritos- the beef in verde sauce appears to be another of their specialties. Tortillas and sopes made fresh in house, service is polite and speaks English."}
{"text":"Awesome Menudo and Pozole! Never have been disapointed with the quality of food! Excellent customer service and atmosphere! Been coming here for sometime..when I would visit from California I would eat here! Now that I live in Las Vegas...I visit on a weekly basis! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"El menudo mas delicioso en Vegas  Excellent service and great food. Menudo my favorite"}
{"text":"OMG besides my grandmas home made white menudo this has been the BEST menudo I have had in the US. They give you the option of white or red, maiz o no, pata o no. You can wash it down with a real Mexican coke. One of the best things is you gave the option of bolillo or hand made tortillas. They also have pozole, tacos, quesadillas and burritos. The service is great always stopping by asking if we needed anything else. This place is only 10 minutes from the strip. It's worth the drive"}
{"text":"Probably the best menudo I've ever had. The flavor was perfect and not greasy at all. Ate it with handmade tortillas and a coke.  Perfect!  Craving some right now. The area is not the best but went on a Tuesday morning."}
{"text":"If you like menudo, then this is the place you want to go in Vegas. You can tell its home made and not canned like other places around town. Neighborhood is a bit sketchy and its a bit of a drive, but the menudo is worth it.  The other food I've tried here was OK, but if you come here, only try the menudo."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed  with all the reviews, after eating there this morning came to realize that all of you were beyond intoxicated when you posted your reviews! Food  was terrible and over priced not that money is an issue for us, but horrible food!! Not just that all these homeless would walk in asking for money not very pleasant to smell before your meal!! That is not permitted at our Aunthentic Mexican Restaurant! The menudo seems like they boil it with just garlic and onions once people order they add the green or red sauces disgusting taste literally the tribe still smelled like where it came from!!!"}
{"text":"Every time I am in Las Vegas we come for breakfast. The red menudo is amazing and with fresh hand made tortillas it is a complete meal! We all love this place after a night of drinking"}
{"text":"Came in from San Diego with all my family and were looking for good pozole and menudo, found this place and OMG!! It was bomb, the tortillas were hand made, the quesadillas and pozole were in point!!! Definitely coming going back when we're in town."}
{"text":"I give it a one star for the customer service we were waiting for 15 mins it wasn't packed it was slow there were 4 servers and all of them didn't come near our table nor offer any drinks it was a group of 4 we were looking forward in trying it out because we kept seeing it on Facebook we came from Cali"}
{"text":"We cleaned our own table when we got here. We waited and no one came to take our order. The writers did come and pick up tip from the people sitting here before us but that's it. Come when it's empty if you want food service but if you like shity service and  ridiculous wait times I recommend coming on the weekends. The table behind us said they had been waiting even longer and they still hadn't had their order taken."}
{"text":"Worse menudo ever. Full of fat and oil no flavor whatsoever over priced. The restaurant was extremely hot they didn't turn on the ac. The wait was so long"}
{"text":"DO NOT COME HERE unless you wanna over pay for low quality food ..  i paid around 12 dollars for a carne asada plate that looked like they took the meat from tacos to serve me a plate .. meat was a bit undercooked and didnt taste right .. service wasnt great .. i asked for many plates that they did not have ready to serve .. i will definitely never come back"}
{"text":"Second time being here and only for the menudo, the menudo was delicious, no grease, no fat on the meat, highly recommended. 
Only thing is they charge a ridiculous high amount for their drinks. Two sprite soda cans for $3.98, seriously? And if you want water they give you a water bottle and charge for that as well."}
{"text":"Had the best red pozole, outside  of  mine ,.The menudo was disappointing.The broth was bland ,the  tripe not well seasoned.Seems like they make all white menudo then just put the red sauce in .Ends up being bland.The birria is freaking literally melt in the mouth  delicious.The corn tortillas are great but they charge for both the flour and the corn.Who eats menudo without tortillas being included?All in all give this place a try it's  worth the drive!"}
{"text":"The red menudo is great flavor always hot and the taco perron awesome also the Micheladas mmmmm."}
{"text":"Good food for the Vegas turnt up .  woooo !!!! . Try out the Menudo and free mexican bread ( pan dulce, with free hot coffee ) .......... Located in North Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Arlene was a really great waitress. She was very attentive and had all ears on high alert.  I ordered the tostada de ceviche and it was delectable. You could taste some Clamato in the mix and the shrimp was cooked very nicely."}
{"text":"Service was very slow but food was delish
I don't think I will ever be back because of the area but I recommend to anyone that is ever near by"}
{"text":"The menudo and pozole were delicious. Perfect cure for a hang over. Service is a little slow but the food is worth the wait."}
{"text":"The food is okay but the service is bad ! the lady kept on forgetting things and they charged us for tortillas that came with the plate ! Smh ?"}
{"text":"So if you in Vegas and hung over lol! This is the SPOT for you. Just a mile away from downtown Freemont street! We drove up to this hole in the wall restaurant in North Las Vegas. Its my new hangover spot I ordered the menudo rojo , yes they also serve white menudo which I was surprised. I remember as a child my grandmother making and serving white menudo. Anyway when it arrived with chunks of meat with home made tortillas in a huge bowl it was delicious. I also had the specialty Carne's asada taco. When that arrived on a flour tortilla with beans and guacamole I was skeptical but it was amazing. Our waitress was very attentive and nice. So if your close to this place don't miss it! All I can say is menudo, posole.... Your in Vegas the best handover food!"}
{"text":"Super tasty menudo!!! Y las tortillas a mano no se quedan atrás....we will be back!!!"}
{"text":"I have to say I was really leary about eating here. .but the service was great and their menudo is to die for. .I know I will take some home and will look forward to return there every time I vist.i really recommend their Menudo. .take it from a expert. ."}
{"text":"Everything on their menu is great except the Menudo. Which really throws you off since they are named El Menudazo, aside from bad menudo we loved their sea food and they have awesome tacos and tortas as well as the burritos. We will continue to come"}
{"text":"Service was really slow, if menudo is all they serve then the wait shouldn't be so long.. As for the menudo itself it's just ok.. Growing up with a father who made menudo , this wasn't even close. The chili was a bit watered down and it lacked flavor. I ordered extra hominy since I'm not real crazy about tripe  , my dad use to use the large hominy and always added extra for me. This hominy was on the smaller side and it was ok.. We live WAY across town and came to this place on a friend's recommendation . We probably won't be back.. Boy do i miss my dads menudo !!"}
{"text":"YELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(86/365) \"The Hangover Cure\"

We came by Menudazo for our Menudo/Pozole fix recently and found out that they had shut down their white building location and moved back to their original location just a few doors down and have been here for the last three months now. 

The restaurant is a bit smaller, but the menu here is still the same. We started out with a Quesadilla with Chorizo, Queso, and Nopales(Cactus). This thing was pretty huge and as much as we wanted to finish this, we couldn't because we had no idea it was spicy chorizo and our mouths were ON FIYAH!!! We also shared their two popular dishes, Menudo Rojo, and Pozole Rojo. (Two sizes available, mediano $6.99 and grande $ 9.99)Both dishes were plentiful, hearty, and filling. For both the Menudo and Pozole, they also offer a Blanco and Verde style as well, but I've only had the red broth, but I'll probably return and try the white and green broths on future visits.

If Menudo and Pozole is not your thing, they also have tacos, burritos, and combination plates as well. Their hours are Friday-Sunday 7 am-8 pm and located in the Belmont Plaza. If you're feeling a little hungover from a night of partying and are looking for the best cure, or just want some tasty authentic Mexican food El Menudazo has some of the tastiest selections around. Give 'em a try!!!   ALOHA!!!

{"text":"Food was awesome! Arlene gave great service had the hand mane quesadillas pozole Birria and mojito was the best! Try it!"}
{"text":"I'm sure there's a restaurant that has great Menudo, sadly places like El Menudazo give our amazing Mexican dish a bad rep! Skip this place on the Menudo they fall way below standards for their Menudo, unless you like the smell of $#!7 in your food! NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Felt like I was at home eating homemade menudo! The staff is very friendly and attentive. The service was great...we ordered the Menudo and Pozole and they both came out super fast! I would definitely recommend this place and will definitely be back next time I'm in Vegas and In need a hangover remedy like menudo! lol"}
{"text":"Their food was pretty good. I came on a Sunday and it was pretty empty. The only thing that bothered me was that I found like 3 eyelashes in my food but they could've been mine so idk . Other than that menudo was great."}
{"text":"This place has the best menudo any way you want it! Red, white, with hominy without with pata or no pata!!! It's so fresh and they have it 7 days a week!"}
{"text":"this was not my favorite place to go eat !!!! you guys charge the tortilla's for a soup of menudo what the heck !!!!! first time and last time i'll be going there"}
{"text":"very good menudo!!.. our server cristina was very attentive and polite ... i will surely come again!"}
{"text":"Menudo was really good. I did notice some yelpers comment that the menudo was bland. My friend and I stopped by and had a medium bowl of menudo rojo. It was a little bland FOR ME, but the good thing is that it was just right for my friend. The best part is that they give you the condiments to add some spice and kick it up a notch or two. After I added onion, lemon, hot sauce and other condiments, it was perfect. You cant add bland to spicy food, but you can add spicy to bland food. The corn tortillas are obviously home made and delicious and they give you plenty. The servings come in medium or large bowls, no small size. The medium serving was more than plenty. I could not finish it all. Our waitress was Arlene. She was sweet and very kind. I only come to Las Vegas once a year and plan on stopping by on my future visits."}
{"text":"I don't understand the 4 stars !!!
The menudo has no taste, both my husband and I ordered the same thing.
Salt,Chile,oregano, onions, cilantro Nothing gave it flavor. Completely disappointed."}
{"text":"Came to visit El Medunazo after a hard night in Vegas.  While visiting we discovered this spot and have to admit the fact that they offer Red and Green menudo with or without hominy.   The service is superb and free coffee and sweet bread as you wait for your food."}
{"text":"I came specifically to this place because i heard they make the best menudo in Las Vegas. I ordered the regular sized menudo with housemade corn tortilla. The menudo had plenty of tripe which was tender and delicious. The broth itself was a little lacking in flavor and a little bland. Dont get me wrong it was still a good menudo, but i dont think thats the best menudo in Vegas......i had a better menudo from a food truck at the outdoor swapmeet in Cali. I really liked the torillas, they were great with the soup. The service was good and the restaurant is ok. Maybe next time ill try something else."}
{"text":"this place is absolute trash! BEANS IN A STREET TACO?!?! like really?? awful. Ordered fries, got shitty rice. Menudo was basically fat in red water. Garbage. Do not eat here."}
{"text":"Really nasty taste, menudo has no good flavor it taste like hot water and grease. It smells like when your sink gets clogged. I WILL NEVER COME BACK HERE... Over price for the food quality.    Bad bad bad"}
{"text":"The menudo was delicious this is my favorite spot to come and get my menudo from. It's a very clean place service is good my server was Arlene she was great! This is definitely the place to go to if your craving some really good Mexican food."}
{"text":"The customer service was great and food was great also thank you Arlene for a asking us if we needed anything else will recommend it family and friends"}
{"text":"So we had a craving for Menudo after a long night of drinking and wanted something authentic . we came across El menudazo and wow amazing .... We tried the pork in red chili taco thinga taco and a asada in green chili wheewww so good. The flavor made me have to take my glasses off and take it in. The pozole rojo was on point. You get your moneys worth for sure. The Menudo w pata is very authentic big pieces of meat though. I prefer the meat more chopped up but nonetheless amazing . service was awesome very attentive and gives a home feeling like your in mama's kitchen . all around a great place will come back 4 sure every time were in Vegas !!!"}
{"text":"All I have to say is.....Menudo, hand made Corn tortillas, and a cold Coke. Nothing better for breakfast on a Sunday morning, or Saturday, or Friday, maybe even Thursday! 

Guys, and Gals if you want good Me...(squirl!) sorry, Menudo try this place you won't be disappointed. And if you are, call me I'll finish your plate at no charge!

Just tell them Eddie sent you!...just kidding they don't even know I exist! Lol!"}
{"text":"Ok...my review 
I bought a Groupon that led me to this place...I love hole in a wall restaurants they usually have a certain quality which this one completely lacks.  Ok on looks just plain looking on the smell as you walk through that door a mixture of weird smelling cleaner with sewage water ok now onto the food...Menudo was good not great the Carne asada tacos we're very low on taste the hero of this trip was the quesadilla which was hand made large corn tortilla....would I come back???
Not from my house in Summerlin like I did today but if I'm at longhorn getting $1.00 beers on Friday...maybe just try to try thier pozole...which they sat they have won awards"}
{"text":"My wife tried White Menudo and I tried Pozole, they were both good. Arlene was our server and she was very friendly and explain the menu to us really well. The variety of food is great so I'll have to come back and try different plates."}
{"text":"Service is great the server (Arlene) was great and attended to my needs.this is the second time I came here and the food was great. Especially the tortillas"}
{"text":"This place has potential, and obviously a lot of customers.  Unfortunately they are really unorganized, and wait times are ridiculous.  I ordered a big plate of red menudo.  When our food came out, I was not impressed at all.  
The flavor was lacking, as an experienced menudo cooker, some tips for the cooks in the back: 

 1.  hominy should be cooked in the broth so it can absorb some flavor 

2.  The broth needs a whole lot of flavor, throw some more garlic and onions in there!

I hope this place can rehabilitate itself and become a menudo hotspot in Las Vegas, we desperately need it!"}
{"text":"Went here based on some positive Yelp reviews on their supposed good menudo.  Sadly the menudo was subpar and lacked flavor.  However the service was good and the homemade tortillas were excellent.  So far Pepe's Tacos on Decatur blvd has provided the best menudo in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"My wife and I are a very picky eaters especially when it comes to Mexican food and Menudo bowls. Well let me tell you guys that this place doesn't disappoint. I love the clear menudo and my wife loves the red one and it's filled with so much stomach and harmony. We came in here based on the reviews, in which we brought some friends with their kids and everyone was happy. Service was great, price was really good and the location was kind a out of the way but worth it."}
{"text":"The pozole was bomb, but everyone else's food was disappointing: flavorless beans, store bought chips, watery salsa, and okay rice. The service was great and the beer was cold, which is awesome on a hot day. I wouldn't make the trip from the other side of town again, but the pozole is worth a stop if I'm in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"5 Stars for our delicious dishes! The menudo was absolutely tasty. 
Clean restaurant, friendly service and a menu that is going to make me go back for more!
The bread and butter with menudo was so good. (I brought the left-over bread - home)
Everyone in our party enjoyed their order. 
We will be back-"}
{"text":"I go to Albuquerque 2 to 3 times a year and have always gotten my pozole fix out there where they know how to make it. Little did I know that here back home in Vegas, there's this place right near my house that makes a 'da bomb' pozole! After reading a glowing review in our Desert Companion (southern Nevada lifestyle) magazine, I decided to stop here tonight on my way home. I met the cooks-Manny, Eloy, & Beto-who were super nice guys. I ordered a medium pozole, some tacos de lengua (tongue-cos), & a carne asada quesadilla to take out. Manny & Beto went back in the kitchen while Loi & I engaged in a cool conversation about the different variations of Mexican cuisine according to regions. It seems that the style here was on the Michoacan/Veracruz side which was a-ok by me! I was pretty excited to get home & try the stuff. The pozole was spot on-chunks of tender meat floating & hominy grits just the right texture all in that oregano etc infused red broth mmm mmm mmm! The tender morsels of lengua melted in my mouth together with the cilantro, onions & killer salsa....damn shoulda ordered more tacos! And the quesadilla was to die for...homemade tortilla wrapped around the perfectly grilled meat-had a smoky, toasted flavor to it. And that green salsa they gave me knocked me up to heaven, man! Can't wait to try the menudo & other items. I am very happy to discover this place right in my neck of the woods. Kudos to Manny & the guys for super service & great food!"}
{"text":"I don't even eat menudo, but the gal I was with said it was extremely good.

More importantly, they actually had it on a weekday, unlike Roberto's.

Tortillas were fresh and had that homemade feel to em. 

Staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Best Menudo in town is right!!! Was worth the short drive. Service was outstanding thanks to Arlen. We have eaten menudo so many places and El Menudazo was outstanding.."}
{"text":"Terrible service! We went there based on yelp reviews, wow those were wrong. We walked in and the restaurant was like an oven. We sat down to order. We ordered two menudos with grano( hominy). When the waiter brought our food we noticed the menudo had no hominy. I asked and he said they had run out and were cooking more. I asked for the hominy later and the waiter said it wasn't ready. I returned the menudo only to still be charged for it. I called this to the attention of manager who only appologised and still charged me for the menudo I didn't eat. Won't eat there ever again!"}
{"text":"Not really worth the drive for me from Henderson... expected more but the flavor was just ok, the quesadilla was good."}
{"text":"Estamos muy muy contentos el menudo es una de mis comidas favoritas , tiene muy buen sabor el servicio es muy bueno sobre todo por la atencion que nos brindo #Arlene servicio excelente .... es la primera vez que venimos y de hoy en adelante seremos clientes de este riquisimo lugar .............     Gracias Arlene"}
