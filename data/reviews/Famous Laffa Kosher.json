{"text":"MASSIVE SHITHOLE.  These people take \"kosher\" to such an extreme their confusing a restaurant for a synagogue.  I went here with my wife and 9 month baby.  My wife was feeding my son from an organic baby fruit pouch while we reviewed the menu to order.  Out of nowhere two women rush to our table exclaiming, \"no non-kosher food allowed!\", and proceeds to take the pouch from my wife's hand to see \"if it's kosher\".  Upon seeing some symbol to their satisfaction they give it back so we can continue feeding our son (thanks lady).  Then the older fat one points at my sons cookies and says, \"what about those? they're not kosher\". So we put them away.  By far one of the weirdest experiences in a restaurant setting.  Keep in mind, this restaurant is not wrapped in a bubble, it's in a food court and it sits in close proximity to McDonalds of all places if they're worried about \"contaminating\" their holy place with non kosher food.   Super rude and disrespectful people.  I don't see them lasting with that service, and frankly I hope they don't.  You shouldn't be in business treating your customers that way.  I appreciate no outside food allowed, but to react the way they did while feeding my baby? blatant disrespect and unacceptable.   We packed up and left, they don't deserve our business after that.    0 stars."}
{"text":"This is a past due review from 2 months ago (btw I am Jay's husband). I took my daughter for dinner there and I had a hommus appetizer, falafel laffa sandwich. My daughter had the kebab skewer. I have to say the quality was truly amazing and the quantity was HUGE ( I am a big eater!) so we ended up taking the leftovers home with us. Everything was fresh and tasty. Their famous laffa bread is baked in store and was exceptional (they offer it as a treat). I chatted a bit with the owner/manager and I could tell she pours her heart into everything she offers. This place is a gem for authentic middle eastern and mediterranean cuisine that is not to be missed! We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"TERRIBLE. If you want to wait more than 40 minutes to get your food because there's only 1 person doing all the work then go try this place. If you want to be disrespected to your time then go here. I would give 0 stars if I could.   Think of it like this at subway- you go in and you have to wait for someone to make the bread. Then you only have 1 person putting the sandwich together. But then you have 10 people in line and you are the 11th person in line and there are people jumping into the queue because the line is so messed up.   I ordered the shawarma laffa but soon noticed that the line was not moving at all. After about 30 minutes of waiting in a line that was moving very slowly, our laffa finally arrived. This is when the problem started. Some guy that had ordered after us decides to cut us off in line and claimed that he was in the line first. So what do they do? They serve to the cheater first. Sure it would be no big deal if we weren't already waiting over 30 minutes and we don't have to wait another decade for another laffa to come out of the oven.   If you're business is based on making fresh laffas, make sure you have enough laffas coming out of your oven. And the most important thing is make sure the line is moving. They have 1 guy doing everything. It seemed like he was the only guy doing everything. We complained about how they let people cut in line- and what do they do? Roll his eyes together with the guy that cheated in line. Yes they support cheating in lines. Dumb cashier lady at the front kept saying \"its ok don't worry it's not a big deal\". Really? It's okay to cheat in line eh? If you're gonna wait in line here just cheat and roll your eyes through the line. It really works here.  I don't know any food court line that makes you wait more than 10 minutes to get your food. This place is just ridiculous."}
{"text":"Friends told me not to go there but the place was decorated impressively so I decided to try it any way. All I ordered was humus and falafel. The falafel was uneatable, the laffa bread was chew and the humus was so so. I spoke with the person in charge and told him that  my complain is for the restaurant's sake. I think he agreed that the falafel was bad (not sure about that) and he offered to replace the laffa. I asked for whole wheat. He left and never came back neither did the laffa. I asked for the bill and the waiter was wondering why didn't I eat anything? I told him the story and he called another person in charge. This person went to the kitchen and got me a freshly baked laffa that was specifically baked for me per the request of the first guy but the kitchen didn't know who to deliver it to, and ... it wasn't whole wheat. I ate two more bites and left the place never to come back"}
{"text":"I went there yesterday. Every week my wife and I take our son to Gymboree along with another couple and their son. Afterwards, we eat in the foodcourt together. It's a weekly affair so this is definitely a loss for infamous laffa.  I ordered a shwarma laffa for myself and a plate of felafel from the kids menu for my son. The felafel plate is 6.99. This teenager makes my laffa. He does an AMAZING JOB. WOW, enough food for 2 people and delicious. Thumbs up.  Then comes my son's felafel plate. I'm asked to wait at the side while it's prepared. The menu says \"served with rice or fries and a can of pop\". I ask if they can put a little less rice and a few fries. Big deal! Right? Apparently so. I'm told first that the felafel plate only comes with 4 felafel balls and no rice or fries. I argue and the manager says\" a. he's been working there for 3 years (the place has been open a matter of weeks).  b. he says I ordered the felafel plate and it doesn't have rice or fries or a drink, it's 6.99. I should look at the menu. I point to where it is on the kids menu. He insists I ordered from the felafel plate on the adult menu and says I should read it. But he can't seem to point to it on the menu because it's only on the kids menu.   So he agrees to give me what I ordered. But then he says no rice and fries, either or, no exceptions. Like screw you buddy. So I said fine, just rice and then asked for some of the salads. He said no.  Let me make this clear. The kids felafel plate and the adult felafel plate (which isn't on the menu btw) and the felafel in a pita are all 6.99. In the pita they put everything you want, but on the plate, it's either rice or fries and the salads they normally put in your pita you can't have. So the felafel plate is rice and felafel balls and NO salads. Just 4 dry felafel balls and some rice... oh and you don't get the drink.   So my son didn't get his felafel. I demanded a refund. The shawarma was good, hence one star, but I would NEVER recommend this place to anyone. None of the 4 of us, nor our children will ever eat there again. BTW, the people at Aroma are really nice.  They were so rude, even yelling at me. If could curse at them on yelp, I would."}
{"text":"I got a Laffa with eggplant took 2 bites and throw it to the garbage. It was disgusting..."}
{"text":"This place used to be located on Magnetic Drive around the Dufferin and Steeles area. I had gone there many times for lunch to dine in and take out. They had very knowledgable and friendly staff and amazing food. The best shawarma in a laffa anywhere in the area. Great salads, soups, meat, felafel, everything you ordered was delicious. They were even featured on an episode of \"You Gotta Eat Here\". The Promenade location is so far from that it's ridiculous. First of all, the food is nothing like it used to be on Magnetic. They've cheaped out on everything from the salads to the quality of the meat. The staff is made up of completely different people and none of them seem to really care about the customers, it seems that they've hired cheaper work (young kids/teenagers) for minimum wage instead of hiring people that actually care and paying them a normal wage. Secondly, I understand it's a kosher restaurant, but when you're in a mall food court, you cannot be closed for most of the day on Fridays. It's ridiculous. I'm so disappointed with this place, it makes me sad that I'll never again have the laffa that I fell in love with at the Magnetic Drive location."}
{"text":"This place is okay. They charge a lot for nothing. It tastes good. But Their Laffa is filled with veggies and very little meat.i could hardly taste my chicken. I don't think paying 15$ for veggies and bread is justified. I guess people Love it because it's all kosher but I've been to other kosher and middle Eastern places with good quality and quantity. I would prob only order food from here if it was the ONLY place for miles. It's huge only because it's packed with all sorts of veggies."}
{"text":"Ok, but just ok.  Dr. Laffa, 3 minutes' drive away on Clark Ave. and Hilda is leaps and bounds better."}
{"text":"I have been three times to try to take out a pita sandwich. All three times they were out of pita. So all three times I had to leave. I think pita is a simple request.  Also the girl at the cash helps by putting dips in take out containers for customers, with dirty hands from handling money. I brought it to the manager's attention. He was very apologetic.  The next time I was there, she was doing it again.  I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Disorganized and slow, but most of all, RUDE.  The cashier obviously didn't want my business since she motioned another patron to CUT IN FRONT OF ME.  They also forgot to make my friend's order.  I miss the days of Dr. Laffa.  I'll take my laffa cravings somewhere else that actually wants my patronage, sorry I offended you by trying to be your customer."}
{"text":"Great decor. They just opened and and really busy and seem to be doing the best they can to make sure everyone is as happy as can be.   My wife and I really enjoyed the food.    They said they are applying for their liquor license and should have it in a week from now. That will be great as there aren't many options nearby and it would be nice to be able to have a beer here and some good food after a movie or after a walk through the mall.   Numerous staff asked about how we were doing and if we were being taken care of.  Our food came really quickly and was actually there when we got back from a quick stroll (we were feeling restless on this rainy day and went for a few mins walk through the mall).   The wait staff was extremely friendly and helpful.   The food was amazing. And the laffa was great.   At the end we had to pack up our food and the staff replaced our half eaten laffa bread with a fresh, whole laffa. Pure class.   Yes, it is a strictly kosher place. And yes, I had to discard my coffee that I happened to be drinking before we came in.  But honestly. It's a kosher place so I really should have known to discard my coffee and it was no big deal.   The decor is really pleasing and ultra modern which was a surprise.  And the bar ledge that opens out onto the theatre area that was kept from the richtree days was a nice touch.    Highly recommend the shakshusha.    Cheers!"}
{"text":"Ten of us celebrated my dad's birthday there. Despite being busy, our table was ready at the time we booked it. From the time we walked in, the service was excellent. The owner/manager was very attentive and the wait staff were really personable and maintained excellent service throughout dinner.   The food was excellent. The hummus is probably the best I've had. The laffas are fantastic and we kept ordering more. We had a variety of main courses, all of which were delicious.   This was not the first time I had eaten there and the food is consistently good.  I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who enjoys middle eastern cuisine."}
{"text":"Decor & Ambience: Contemporary, clean & gleaming surfaces, well lit. Service: Welcoming & friendly.  Food: Excellent, priced right, vegetarian friendly, generous portion sizes which make for a good meal at home the following day.  Their laffa bread is quite delicious & versatile. They have mouth watering laffa sushi - as dessert rolled up with chocolates & nuts & cut like a sushi.  Tip: They have a special everyday. They open after sabbath on Saturday."}
{"text":"Met a friend for lunch today as he wanted to try this place. We sat inside the restaurant as opposed to the food court. The server was very attentive and got our meals out quickly.   The bean soup was okay, nothing special with very few beans. The laffa bread left on the table was very tasty.  Interestingly and strange is that we were told that they didn't have any chef salads with only vegetables but had these salads were available if meat were added to them!  Odd.. Ordered the  tabouli salad which was fresh and tasty.   Odd that coffee refills aren't free. Lots of mishegas!  My experience over the years with kosher restaurants has lead me to avoid them. This one wasn't as bad as most but not good enough to bring me back."}
{"text":"It seems like this place has a lot to learn when dealing with families and non-kosher eating clientele from some of the reviews I'm seeing.  I've like Famous Laffa since their early days on Magnetic Drive (Dr. Laffa) and I always wondered how they were going to get their oven into the Promenade (it seems like they succeeded in that). It does seem like they've begun batch making their laffas so they come out not as fresh to tables which is a bit disappointing but not a deal breaker for me.  When I went recently I got the schnitzel laffa with everything in it. I did notice a severe lack of the schnitzel in half of my laffa which was concerning as it's the main reason why I order it. Otherwise the sandwich was built fine and getting the food to the table took a decent amount of time.  My biggest concern (and it seems to be a trend) is that my wife was asked to feed our baby outside of the establishment. I understand there are Kashrut laws in play for the Kosher eaters that regularly dine there but if you are going to appeal to non-kosher eaters and ask them to leave because of what they are bringing into the eatery, you are going to lose out on customers and you are going to gain a poor reputation. My wife and I keep a kosher home and we understand the laws involved. Everything we brought in was either hechsered (marked kosher) or made at home from fruits or vegetables. But from this experience, you've lost me as a customer. The food was OK, I can get better elsewhere and get treated better as a customer."}
{"text":"This is a review for their takeaway area. I have tried their shawarma on a laffa and chicken kebob on a laffa. The shawarma beats it hands down purely on the amount of meat in the wrap. Its so tasty and gigantic. One order is good to share with a friend. Not sure why  the chicken kebob has so little meat, but it is priced the same as a shawarma (10.99$)  The complaints about the service is real. The takeaway service suffers from a lot of confusion and inefficiency. First you gotta wait in line to order and pay. You will get a receipt, and then you have to wait in line to have your order made by the one food prepper. Sometimes people automatically assume that after they've paid, their food will be made in the correct order. In actuality, the food prepper has no idea whos order to make next unless you have waited in line in front of him. This can be quite frustrating, especially if you have some random customers who are friendly with the prepper and jump the queue without any consideration that an order has already been established before theirs.  This was really only an issue when they opened in the first month or so and were busy. They dont have so much traffic now.  Another issue i had with this place was the lack of food handling and safety skills. A couple of times i would see slip ups like placing a plastic bag over and on a fresh laffa that was on the counter, or touching the insides of my laffa while packing it into the paper bag. Lately though it seems to have improved somewhat, the food preppers now use disposable gloves (thank you) and change them as needed... i just hope they also wash their hands more frequently."}
{"text":"The Laffa is gigantic and delishious. Lots of salads and variety of dishes. Staff is friendly and funny sometimes. The decor is amazing,  these guys invested a fortune to make a really nice experience. I've never seen such a nice kosher restaurant.   The restaurant has regular inside seating, they also have a takeout counter in the food court which is brilliant idea. I much prefer the food court even when dining in. At the food court the food comes out much faster, I can customize my sandwich easily, I can get easy and stress free seating for my kids in the food court, I don't have to tip a waitress.  Eating in the food court is literally what keeps up coming back. It's a great way to dine with a family with young children. It's also really nice to eat in a mall atmosphere. Usually kosher restaurants are small and constricted areas. We eat once at Dr. Laffa close by, and there was no atmosphere there. It was just a dark room without any life. The Mall food court is bustling with life and a fun place to hang with the family.   Overall, thank you for making this restaurant. It's not easy owning a kosher restaurant, there are so many rules. So, we should be appreciative of what these guys are doing."}
{"text":"If only the magnetic  drive  people read this and realize many many original magnetic drive patrons agree and were excited  when they opened here   They will be in trouble soon with all the decent falafel around  They were head and shwarmas ahead of ALL OF THEM! Now the food is salty  Shwarma  not same at all Portion size ok but were HUGE  Rib steak baaaaad Etc  Only the laffa remains as a staple    Dont ruin this opportunity to be the best       This is the place for  Freshest largest delicious  laffa ( like naan)  Leanest tastiest spiced perfectly shawarma  Amazing large fresh falafel balls  All salads and dishes fresh and delicious  And many things to try like  fantastic  sabich( like a fried dumpling ) as a dish or in a    Pita  An all around knock out for middle eastern/Israeli food  Dine in or take away counter  Remember closed for Shabbat Friday afternoon"}
{"text":"Ordered their Famous Hummus and it was really good, on of the best in Canada. Their Dark meat Kebab was OK, very similar to other places in Vaughan."}
{"text":"Anyone here remember the days of Magnetic Drive? The shawarma was authentic Israeli style, made of turkey, with the tomato and lamb dripping off the top? Delicious...  Well those days are over.   If I can describe this restaurant in one word, it would be: inconsistent.  Sometimes I order the kebab, and it looks like charcoal on a skewer (see attached picture) .. burned to a crisp. And they have the audacity to actually put it in a box and charge me for it, when any other restaurant would apologize and throw it in the trash. Shameful.   The little appetizer salads are absolutely flavorless. Just gross. You can tell no effort went into making them.   The chicken skewers aren't any better. 5 tiny morsels of chicken on a skewer... and the portions seem to be getting smaller and smaller.   I mentioned Shawarma and turkey up above, now its chicken, which consists of chicken fat and cartilage that you'll be spitting out after every couple of bites or so.   One day the babaganoush is great, the next day it tastes completely different. I've asked around and the kosher community knows that this place is a joke. People look forward to eating in NYC, or Israel because over there they feed your eyes first, with delicious generous portions, and then your stomach.   This is a kosher restaurant that knows the kosher community doesn't have much of a selection, ESPECIALLY when it comes to meat. So they serve you subpar food and charge you whatever they'd like for tiny portions, because they know they've monopolized the market.   Verdict:  Do not eat here."}
{"text":"this is the spot for shawarma!  Just had lunch there while christmas shopping in the mall. i tried the chicken breast dinner with israeli salad and wow loved it!  My mother in law got a shawarma and shared it with my fiance and they loved it too. everything was right the service was excellent and the staff checked on our table more than once.  Atmosphere is clean and bright.  def. a place to check out when in the mall"}
{"text":"0 stars does not even begin to describe this abomination of a \"restaurant\". I'm forced to give it a 1 star due to the rules of Yelp, but if I could give it a negative rating, I most certainly would.   First of all, the food is DISGUSTING, I have never had a worse shawarma or laffa in my life. It smelled gross, and had absolutely no taste whatsoever.   More than the food itself, the service at this restaurant was hands down the worst service I have ever experienced when dining outside.  The waitresses were extremely rude, disrespectful, and had no problems neglecting their customers. This place had some old lady waitstaff which were probably the slowest people I have ever seen in my life, and the bar tender was also was ill mannered.  I came with my sister and her baby son, and the female employees at this restaurant had the audacity to tell my sister to stop feeding her child while inspecting the baby food.  First of all, I understand it is a kosher restaurant, but how dare you grab baby food from a child? Are you an animal? These people don't understand that they're placed in the middle of a mall where people of all countries and religions are there to enjoy food and shop around.   This restaurant is the least inviting place I have ever seen in my life, especially to those who are non-kosher and are not aware of the rules. Definitely one of the worst dining experiences of my life.  DO NOT go here, it is not worth the time, money, disrespect, or offence to your tastebuds.   0/5 stars."}
{"text":"When they were located at Magnetic Drive, the food was amazing.   Today was the first time we visited after the relocation and the food completely went downhill. We visited after lunch time and ordered a shawarma hummus and a shawarma laffa.  The laffa that comes with the hummus was cold. The shawarma laffa was also cold. And taste very blend."}
{"text":"I only recently had laffa for the first time, but really loved it - so I was thrilled to hear that we were getting a well known Laffa joint in the mall. Seemed like it was under construction forever, but have now had the chance to check this place out three times.   My first visit was during the opening month and I ate inside. The staff were super pleasant, though the waitress did not come around all that much. What was great was that I have a fairly minor food allergy and had some topping questions. The owner took me to the open kitchen so I could find out what was in some of the toppings directly from them. That was certainly unnecessary, but appreciated.  The Laffa was gigantic. Really did not need the sides I ordered - but everything was really good. This Laffa was more on the savoury side, where the one I had before was sweeter. Not really comparable in my opinion (I've seen similar differences in Donair joints), but I did really enjoy the food.  My next two visits were to the take out station. The food is prepared really fast and I've again tried some different Laffa variations. Everything has been good and super fresh. They are moving a lost faster now than they were a couple of months ago (it used to be a place I would not go to if I was in a rush to get back to the office - now not a concern at all).  I wish they had bottles of pop, because the food is so big you run out of drink first - but honestly that is my only complaint.  They have a frequent customer swipe card that you can get. They send out offers every couple of days by text message that get attached to your card and get you a percentage off or a free drink. It's worth singing up for it. Hopefully they will be able to attach this to an app-based service at some point, as I'm not in the habit of carrying around cards so I don't get to use this component as much as I'd like.  The food is really good and probably the best offering here at the mall. I'm really surprised by the negative reviews. Clearly Laffa (and the competing businesses) are something some people are really entrenched in. As an outsider it all means very little to me and I definitely feel this is not a reflection on the food.  I feel bad for the person who had the negative experience with brining in food for their child - but my understanding (from an Orthodox peer at work), that the Kosher rules are brutally strict. They have a take out counter and there are nice tables right beside it - so I think that shouldn't be a huge issue."}
