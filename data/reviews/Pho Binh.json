{"text":"Thank you Yelp for finding me a real Pho restaurant in the West Island. It's completely authentic - the pho had a rich, aromatic broth and was served piping hot. Imperial roles were light and crunchy and the homemade lemonade was fresh and tart. It's the real deal and I highly recommend it. They have a full Vietnamese menu which I look forward to sampling if I can ever tear myself away from the Pho!"}
{"text":"My husband and I come here at least a couple times a month, and when friends visit Montreal we always bring them here. The service here is very helpful, quick, and friendly. The broth here is absolutely the best I've had anywhere, it is so aromatic and you can taste hints of star anise. The broth is why we trek out to the West island, and it is worth it every time. They are very friendly and accommodating when my husband asks for less noodles or we ask for any adjustments. The servings are very large and we have never been able to finish even the smallest size pho. Now on to the non-pho items. The beef wrapped in betel leaves is so tasty you will have a very hard time choosing between it and the pho. It is truly amazing. It comes with rice wrappers, lettuce, pickled veggies, herbs and vermicelli and you wrap it all up at the table and dip it into the most delicious lemongrass sauce. It's so addicting! Also I can never finish such a big portion so I wrap up the last two rolls and they pack it up for me with more sauce to take home. All the grilled items are very delicious as well. We have never had anything here that we didn't love. Make sure you order the iced coffee. I hope these guys stay open forever so we can keep going there."}
{"text":"#1 Pho restaurant in the West Island. The food is very traditional to the Vietnamese culture. My husband and I always enjoyed the food very much. Among our favorite dishes: the Pho soup, their grill meat dishes, their special \" Bo La Lot\" dishes and their weekend special spicy soup!"}
{"text":"Im writing this review, because I don't want this place to go away. Pho Binh, by far the most authentic Vietnamese cuisine in the West-Island. No need to drive to Cote-des-Neiges area to have some hot Pho soup. It's the real deal, but it may be more pricey 9$ for Large. No need to worry about the parking and again, it may be the only Authentic Vietnamese cuisine in the West-Island."}
{"text":"Been here more than 20 times Best Vietnam cuisine in Montreal.  Way better than those in downtown area  Food, portion, price, speed, service all perfect   recommend their weekend special and the other one on same page.  All phos have unique taste which shows they really put effort and authentic spices."}
{"text":"For the price point, there are many places that make better food for less. The service was horrendous, I've never seen a waitress telling customers what to do, like the attitude being downright disrespectful, to the point where they are so greedy they commented on us not ordering enough meals, and slap an extra fee on top of their already overpriced food for take out. The nuc chom sauce was like a dessert sauce. The spring rolls were chewy and minute. The crispy noodles were bland. The pho was standard with most places in the city and well, the only standout was the imperial rolls."}
{"text":"First time visit. Friendly, inviting dining room. Service was polite and efficient. The Bun Bo Hue was fantastic! Quite spicy. A treasured meal. Would go back and recommended for those who have not tried this place yet. You have to try the Bun Bo Hue!"}
{"text":"Awesome place for pho! My mom and I came here for an early dinner and it was absolutely delicious. We had the imperial roles to start and then had a soup each. My mom had the chicken soup and I had the beef special. The service was very fast and we both enjoyed the meal so much that we can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Wow was I ever disappointed with this place. It looked very clean inside...almost too clean for an authentic pho restaurant. Nevertheless we sat down and ordered a \"Large\" bowl of pho and fresh rolls which they called \"clear spring rolls.\"    Anyways,  the price for a bowl of pho is $10 for a large and $11 for an extra large. For the price I thought I would be getting a pretty big portion in a decent sized bowl. My bowl of pho barely had any meat or noodles in it and for $10 a bowl it seemed like they were trying to milk every penny of profit from this bowl.  The fresh rolls were good and so was the actual broth.  However, I would not come back here if I was in Montreal again.. Im pretty sure there are cheaper pho bowls out there with bigger portions."}
{"text":"Yup! This is my go too for PHO in the West Island. Legit. They also make good Vietnamese specialties if you're not into the soup. Very little spot, few tables and very modest decor. You come here for the food, look at your soup. They don't take credit cards, only debit or cash."}
{"text":"Arrived at Courtyard Marriott around 8pm. Found this restaurant about 10-minute drive. Great Pho (I had well done flanks and tendons) and nice service (the waitress was smiling genuinely)."}
{"text":"It was very nice to eat in a CLEAN Vietnamese restaurant. The Tonkinese chicken soup was very tasty. We also had the shrimp spring rolls and shredded beef rolls. They were fresh and very tasty. The service was friendly and efficient. We don't like to sit around a long time in a  restaurant and didn't have to. We were in and out. I dont think tjey take credit cards but do take debit. Thanks!!"}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant several times since my last review and I leave happy every time! I've ventured from the soup section and tried some of the other food as well and it is great! The combo meals are good value and taste delicious. I will keep returning, that is for sure!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! My boyfriend and I always have a great delicious meal each time we go! Catch us there every sunday! The food and service is always great! and its a BYOB which is always a plus :)"}
{"text":"Review #400  Wow, I can't tell you how happy I was to find an authentic Vietnamese resto in the W Island!  I could tell by walking in that this place was the real deal!  Chopsticks and asian soup spoons on the table + hoisin and Siracha sauce!  It's a definite sign it's true Vietnamese!  I'm so tired of restaurants claiming they are Vietnamese only to look at their menu and being disappointed because they do Quebec stir-fry!  Most of these restaurants that pretend are so mediocre it's sad!    As it was a hot day I was not in the mood for pho so I ordered a B7 (grilled chicken, spring rolls vermicelli). Portion size was not huge but just enough for lunch!  Flavour and taste was decently good!  Not the best Vietnamese I've eaten but definitely better than good considering the dearth of Vietnamese in the West Island!    Price is a bit higher. Usually you can get a dish for sub $10 but they charge $11.50 for a Vermicelli!    Next time I'm going to hit up the Pho!"}
{"text":"Closest thing to pho lien you will find on the west island!!! Great pho and imperial rolls. Decent service and cleaner than most Vietnamese restos"}
{"text":"Another time in West Island, another opportunity to try the local Pho. Yea I'm a pho madness. Again, I ordered my usual combination: Pho, imperial rolls and iced coffee.  Imperial rolls: really fresh, hot and crispy. They've made a great job in marinating the filling, the minced porc and minced tarot. My only complaint... Why are they so cheap with the sauce... I can barely dip the tip of the rolls in it.  Pho: soup is very tasty and it's super boiling when it arrives. Thumps up!  However... The noodles is a but too soft (maybe over cooked) but it's very good overall.  The iced coffee, you can't get any better when it's freshly brew at your table... I only wish they would bring it to me before my foods arrive and not after.  Overall experience, it is yummy. I just find it a bit overpriced compares to others... Especially you would expect slightly lower price since it's in a little town, a little street mall..."}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE: It's a very clean little restaurant in the West Island. Not much decor, it's just very simple.  FOOD: Honestly, the taste is good but the quantity is not filling for me. Especially the rice plates. One time, they brought the soups out and upon noticing how little they gave us, they came back with a bowl of noodles on the side. Honestly, that's just sad. I will say that I appreciate the fact that you can ask for no fat in your soup (only place that offers this in my experience). I wish I didn't have to give negative comments to such a friendly restaurant but I just am not satisfied with their dishes.  PRICE: Prices are pretty affordable. However, like I said, it's not worth the portions that they give you. You can find better places for lower prices in the area or downtown. I'll only be coming here if it's my last option in the West unfortunately.  SERVICE: Service is always very friendly. They are efficient and the owner is super nice."}
