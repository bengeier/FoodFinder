{"text":"My lunch experiences here have all been great. I've only had one dinner experience and a couple happy hours. The tomato bisque and salads for lunch are perfect every time. The 5 for $5 apps at happy hour are wonderful paired with a good wine selection. The dinner menu is varied and interesting. While I wasn't ready to scream from the rooftops about how great my dinner was, it wasn't horrible. Service is attentive and professional."}
{"text":"Wow. This place is ritzy and pretentious... But if you like that kinda' thing it's definitely top-notch. The whole experience makes you feel like a million bucks...

The place is surprisingly small once you get in, and at 8 on a Saturday we were one of, maybe, 4 couples there. That let the waitstaff focus entirely on us. I didn't have to pour a single drop of wine or ask for a refill on my water.

And then there's the food. No wonder this place gets all the accolades. I was a little scared of the lobster nachos, but I couldn't imagine going back without having them again. The steak was fantastic, and my wife loved the seafood bouillabaisse. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Even though it's not in the poshest or hippest area of downtown, One Walnut exudes nothing but class.  The service is textbook perfect, and everything is properly laid out - the pacing of the courses as well as the table.  This is definitely a place for a long, celebratory meal.

My last visit was for such an indulgent occasion.  As expected, there were no flaws, but it wasn't as amazing as previous times.  My calamari had a remarkably airy crust, but felt a little greasy.  The salmon was nothing revelatory but was cooked perfectly.  The duck was remarkably tender even though it was cooked more than I prefer, and the rosemary cornbread pudding that accompanied it was an excellent pairing.  The honey glaze might have been a little over the top.  The scallops with risotto was probably the best of the entres at our table, and the lobster nachos are always popular.  Among the desserts, my black currant panna cotta was magnificently rich and an excellent conclusion.

If you wish to linger, be sure to ask about their teas, which are blended exclusively for the restaurant.  My white tea was a delicate finale to a wonderful meal.  I was surprised at how empty it was for a Friday night; perhaps everyone now knows that it's good but not quite as great as it used to be."}
{"text":"We visited this restaurant in February 2010.  The whole experience was terrible, but laughable now that some time has passed."}
{"text":"I went here with a friend during Restaurant Week, but didn't end up ordering off the Restaurant Week menu. The atmosphere was fairly dressy - I was in a suit and felt pretty comfortable, while my friend was in jeans, and felt under-dressed.  We shared the calamari, the duck, and the lemon tart. The calamari was delicious - swimming in some sort of tomato-y broth and very tender. The duck was amazing! Perfectly cooked, and ample portions. The tart was a total disappointment, however. It was on the Restaurant Week menu, so perhaps it was prepared too far ahead of time? The crust was gummy and thick. There was barely any filling. Not a great way to end an otherwise good meal. Overall, it was a little overpriced for what it was, but it did have some high points. It was solidly OK, but not amazing."}
{"text":"I've been to One Walnut a number of times and have never been disappointed (except for the time I ordered the fish special and, though delicious, was tiny!).  The tomato bisque and lobster cobb salad are fabulous."}
{"text":"Fine Dining?? More like dressed up overpriced stouffer's

Now a disclaimer. I normally will not write a review of a restaurant unless I have had more than one occasion to visit the establishment but as our experience was as bad as it was I refuse to look towards this disaster ever again.

When my friend from college Laura called and told me about Downtown Cleveland restaurant week and we selected the establishments we wanted to try, I instantly wanted to try One Walnut. We called to just barely get a Friday night reservation and the disaster commenced. 
That Friday driving in downtown was INSANITY as there was a Cavs game. I called to tell the hostess we would be a little late, when we walked in I realized that it really was an exercise in futility as the dining room was near empty. Imagine how upset we were to be seated next to the ladies restroom. Despite the crappy table, the decor was so-so Some decor was reminiscent of a 1940's fancy club the rest of the decor reminded me of a cheap banquet hall. Sad to say the least. 
Our first interaction with the staff left me taken a bit aback. They were truly attentive to the point of being overbearing. We could hardly carry on a conversation. We ordered our drinks and our food. The Downtown restaurant week menu left quite a bit to be desired so we ordered the 3 course meal off the regular menu as it was not much more expensive. Here is what we ordered

Laura ordered 
pomegranate mandarin orange salad
Duck with cornbread stuffing and lindonberry sauce
vanilla bean creme brullee with fresh berries

I ordered 
sesame crusted calamari with lotus root
sweet pork filet with roasted sweet potatoes and brocollini with a candy apple apperitif
vanilla bean creme brullee as well (there was a true lacking in desert choices nothing was what you would call revolutionary)

Before our first course came out they brought out a amuse bouche of tuna tartare with wasabi creme fraiche. Sadly it was barely palatable. The tuna was extremely fishy tasting and the wafer it was served on tasted like a cheap grocery store cracker.

The first courses arrived soon after. My first impressions were the portions were large on any person's standard of a first course. They mounded off the plate. Laura's was nothing special. Basically a salad with pomegranate and canned mandarin orange slices (a true abomination for fine dining). My first course was well deplorable. It was deep fried with a generic tempura batter with all of 5 sesame seeds. The wasabi sauce was mayonnaise (eww eww eww) with wasabi. The calaari were so overcooked they were nearly inedible. And the lotus root chips were horribly bitter.

Not a single minute passed between the time our first course plates were taken and our entrees arrived. Our stomachs hardly had recovered from the previous assault. The entrees were about as large as the first courses. Laura's duck was visibly overcooked it was gray. My dish was a mess. A mound of meat. I tried Laura's duck which was rubbery, greasy and definitely overcooked. The cornbread stuffing was what stouffers cornbread stuffing would taste like if they made cornbread stuffing. It was also overcooked. The pork spare rib apperitif seemed an afterthought to the entire dish but turned out to be the most palatable item of the evening. The filet was properly cooked but has a teryaki flavor which made it seem like a misplaced protein. The potatoes were overcooked to the point of being mushy. The brocollini (to use the words of anthony bourdain who i heart) looks like it came out of Bob Marley's closet after spending 7 years in there. It was tough and rubbery and worst of all BITTER. yuck yuck yuck.

Like the experience after the first course the moment after our entree plates were taken our deserts were brought out. The creme brullees were horribly overbrulleed. The normally hard caramel exterior was instead burnt marshmallow.  The interior was runny not fully set and made me wish I weren't a sucker for creme brullee.

This meal was a total disappointment. I'd love to have the Gourmet magazines food critics eat the meal I did and call this a good restaurant.

What I recommend:
Go to Light or the Flying Fig your money will be better spent.

Avoid like the plague
This culinary disaster"}
{"text":"I don't know why more people don't frequent this place - come on, Cleveland, this place made Gourmet magaine's top 50 restaurants two years running!  It's a fine restaurant for people with fine wallets.  My wallet isn't so fine, but I came here during the Cleveland Originals restaurant week ($30 for a three-course grand prix fixed menu), and had a fabulous experience from start to finish.

Atmosphere: I remember it being kind of soft grey and black, actually quite nice.  It's private, a place where you can have a conversation, and it's not overdone or overly pretentious.

Food: What to order?  You can get a three, four or five-course meal here.  The three-course meal was more than enough for me, and I like to eat.  I've been here twice - I *love* the hangar steak.  It's tender, perfectly done, and the portions are perfect.  The chef's signature flourless chocolate cake is divine, and the cheese plate is awesome.

Service:  Fabulous.  Here's the story: While waiting for a table, I ordered a rose wine that I just found really awful.  It's since been taken off the menu.  Anyway, I wasn't going to ask for an exchange, but the hostess noticed that I hadn't finished more than a third of it by the time we were seated.  She ascertained that it wasn't to my liking, and immediately swapped it for a wonderful white wine by an Oregon vineyard called Arneis).  It was an unexpected, and very nice, gesture.

ETA: I finally remembered the name of the wine I had!"}
{"text":"We walked here several blocks from the hotel. It was great. 

I was so happy after I ate here I didn't really care how much we spent (it wasn't that expensive). It was what I think of as Michelin stars dining.  Eat as many courses as you can, it's all good. Ask for wine recommendations, it's good stuff and they know what they're doing. 

The two waitstaff makes it look easy, I suggest you tip them well, they earn it. 

Best food I've had in some time, speaking as a culinary student from Schoolcraft college.

If your wallet can take it, I'd recommend taking everyone you know. If they know food and appreciate it, then the smiles on their faces makes it even more worth it."}
