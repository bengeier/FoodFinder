{"text":"Horrible horrible. I am SO angry. I at here yesterday and was throwing up in the middle of the night. I had the chills so bad I couldn't stop shivering to be able to go to sleep (even after wearing 4 layers and under 4 blankets). I have a pretty strong stomach, and never ever throw up (last time was many many years ago).  I intend on filing a complaint and asking for my money back as soon as possible."}
{"text":"I had some sort of curry with eggplant made with coconut milk which was pretty good. It is pricey for the quality though.  The service was also good."}
{"text":"Reviews are spot on. Tasteless, small portions - Pad Thai tasted like nothing. Really not worth it when there are so many choices nearby. Skip"}
{"text":"I ordered sweet and sour pork, broccoli (mixed veg) and noodles. The sad part is it was crazy expensive for the amount I got. And the noodles were the best part, but they were too dry! Not worth the price-tag."}
{"text":"Being an engineering student, I usually spend my weekends working in labs and the intensive hours of clicking on a computer works up quite an appetite. I suddenly had this urge for Thai food however for some oddly strange reason, it seems every single Thai place within a 2 km radius of UofT was closed on a rainy saturday afternoon!! What the hell! I finally went to College Park to grab some groceries and make my own pad thai when I saw, Thai Bowl... at this point, I didn't care what it was, I just saw thai food and I WANTED IT  Oh how wrong I was... my mind was telling me to get away but my gut said no, it says Thai food right there, I need it now! But trust me... this place is NOT Thai food. The only Thai thing they have is pad thai noodles and it was absolutely disgusting - soggy, bland. Run by Chinese folk, it was pretty much Man Chu Wok but 10 times worse AND it was also more expensive! $7.50 for a crappy plate of FAKE FOOD?   I swear to you I gagged at the first bite I had and threw the rest out... STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE"}
