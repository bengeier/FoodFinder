{"text":"Food is good, but I really appreciate the service and for the value of the food you are getting in this area, it probably is the best.  It is a mix of indian, singaporean and chinese fusion blend that makes it a very interesting as well as they do a very good job of blending those 3 choices together.  In terms of price I have to admit that they are one of the best in the GTA and the portions are massive as they really do not cheap out on the quantity of food they provide.  

Is it the best food I have ever had, no, but it gets the job done and is very satisfying especially given that it is in the north york area where there are really only 3 good asian (chinese particular) restaurants which includes Tin Tin Congee, Hakka and Noodle on Finch."}
{"text":"Decent Hakka food. Vegetarian Manchurian balls were my favourite. The Bombay paneer was not like your traditional chilli paneer but it was more like barbecue paneer. The Hakka noodles were good, we ordered them spicy but it was almost unbearable because of that. Medium is probably good for most."}
{"text":"The best hidden Hakka joint in Toronto. 
Bombay tiger prawns are a must try. 
Soups are good. Service is awesome. 
Ambiance is weak and plaza / neighbourhood isn't great which is probably why this place doesn't get love. 

But you need to come here for at least that shrimp."}
{"text":"The best Hakka food ever. Good quality + big portions + cheap!!! Really really really good"}
{"text":"Great place. good food, awesome prices.
soups are awesome.

Been comming since it opened. Always happy"}
{"text":"We LOVE Hakka food. We work in Scarborough and love the many restaurants around our work. We were so excited to learn of Hakka Bros near our house. And we were so excited to read that they had some great reviews! Unfortunately, we were so disappointed in their food that we'll never eat here again. We ordered the shrimp pekoras which were not fresh. The shrimp used was frozen, probably had freezer burn on it, and tasted old and not made when ordered. I hate wasting food but I couldn't stomach them. The chili chicken, although tasted fine at the time, gave us awful indigestion and unpleasant bathroom time. The only good thing we ordered were the Hakka noodles, but they aren't good enough to get me back through the door."}
{"text":"I've only gotten take out from this place, but it satisfies my cravings every time! They give you a lot of food for the price and it tastes great. You really can't go wrong with any dish (I've been going through the menu to try different things, along with the usual sweet and sour chicken). The delivery is a bit slow during busy times. Takes about an hour or so, but other times it's usually around 40 min or so i would say. All in all, love ordering from here."}
{"text":"First time trying and really enjoyed the food.
 Take out order, so hard to tell you about in house service. But  Paul was a great
Food was prepared very well and fresh. It was steaming hot. 


Lollipop chicken - 4/5
Chicken Wings - 5/5
Manchurian chicken (gravy) - 4/5
Kungpao chicken - 5/5
Beef w/ beans and mushroom - 4/5
Szechuan fish(gravy) - 5/5
House fried noodles - 4/5
Yeng chow fried rice - 4/5


Portions are large, economical.  And they gave me order of white rice with all gravy orders. Order was loaded up with condiments and cutlery also. 

 Place looked clean and very spacious.

Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"At first I wanted delivery but once they told me that I needed a min order of $30 I was like hmmm let me think about this. I had already picked what I wanted and read the yelp reviews which usually doesn't lead me wrong so I did it I went out to the place. Glad I did. 
The place itself is nothing to write home about. Like other post says they have plastic ones like you would use at a party. Lots of table can't really get a theme.
Other than that the food was great ... flavorful. I had the Manchuria chicken with gravy and the fish and black bean sauce. Soo good and they give u lots and lots of food. This meal could feed a family of 4. I took most of it home. I could not believe how much meat there was. Can't wait to have my left overs."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery so I didn't have the opportunity to dine in and check out the customer service but from what I gather, the delivery guy was really polite and smiling lots when he delivered. I got variations of fried rice and all were pretty good. You get a solid amount of food for what you're paying. The food taste really good and the price wasn't too bad. I'd definitely order from here again"}
{"text":"Great food! I had the Hakka house special noodles and the honey garlic chicken wings. The service was friendly and attentive as well. Will Definitely return."}
{"text":"Good value for your money. Plenty of food. Taste was comparable to Federics and Lin Garden."}
{"text":"Big league tasty. Just tried the Crispy Ginger Beef and Manchurian Chicken xtra spicy.. Both were the best I've had. Can't wait to go back.

Update.. got takeout again but this time everything was soggy:( Food clearly doesn't travel well"}
{"text":"Been here twice. The decor isn't very appealing and parking is tricky but the food is delicious. Service is okay.

They have really inexpensive food (lunch special and dinner combos) I am surprised that they did not raise the price since the minimum wage rise. Soup is especially great

As for the disposable cover on the table, it is something I used to see in Asia, as it is easier to clean up the mess after. It is nostalgic to see it here. Not environmentally friendly though, I have to admit.

Great place for Hakka food."}
{"text":"We really, really, really, wanted to like this place. Thought this would turn out to be another good find for Hakka food, as the dishes did look quite good in the pics. 

We ordered fish pakora, chicken Manchurian, Bombay chicken, and Manchurian chicken noodles. Our order took a really really long time to be served. All guests that got seated after us got their orders before us. Then the food arrived ....in reverse order....lol. 
First came the noodles, then came the two chicken dishes, and finally came the appetizer. We were told that the fish pakora takes a long time to be prepared. While one of the owners was upfront and apologized for the delay (appreciate it), the other owner said we had ordered after all the other guests....which was just made up. 

But the delay wasn't really a big deal. Sometime some dishes may take longer for any number of reasons, it's very understandable. Our experience of the dinner here wasn't really affected by the wait for the food....but by the food itself. 

Food arrived, backwards, but looked good. 
Both the deep fried dishes: fish pakora and Bombay chicken had a bitter after-taste with every single bite. They tasted of stale overused oil. Clearly the fryer oil was being reused way too much and not being cleaned. This is quite unacceptable as it should be very obvious for any cook to notice that the fryer oil is not fit for cooking anymore. 
The chicken Manchurian had tons of cornflour....both for coating the chicken and for thickening the gravy. It was still edible while piping hot, but as the fi started cooling down...it just became more and more disgusting. 
Manchurian noodles were average at best, had a strong flavour of some stock powder or flavouring. So it wasn't to our liking. But I guess that's their recipe. 
 
I do think that the restaurant has the potential to be good. But at this point, a lot of effort is needed on their part. The restaurant is quite popular, and seemed busy enough....which means it must be appealing to the taste of some guests. So I guess you can give it a shot and might have a better experience than we did. But our experience here was quite disappointing and won't be dining here again."}
{"text":"This place is great. One of those gems that you stumble across by accident. Food is good. Portions are big. Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"The food was much better than expected. I'm a sauce-heavy Hakka fan, so Manchurian was my way to go. It was solid. As was the Hakka noodle dish. What the place lacks in ambience (it lacks a lot. They seem to not care that there's no music or just about anything beyond chairs and tables) it makes up for in portion size and good service. 

Our server had a sense of humour and was willing to guide our lunch choices based on preferences for dry/wet dishes and a good balance of flavours. That alone earns solid stars.

The prices are also ridiculously low for lunch. $6 for a giant plate with one of spring roll/soup/pop? Wild. The food was fresh and fried well--crispy and not left to drown in sauces for hours. 

Go there so they stick around. The neighbourhood needs them."}
{"text":"wanted to try a new hakka place - and this is only about 10-15 min from my house. 

plastic table cloths, cheap terrible decor... the machurian chicken and fish pakora were good. it's a bit sad in the restaurant tho. more just a take out place i suppose."}
{"text":"This was our second visit, and the food was excellent with large portions. We went on 09 May 2018 at around 13:00.  It wasn't busy but the take away certainly was.  It took awhile to get a menu, and the fellow was in a \"just do what you have to do\" mode.  Since the portions are huge, we decided to just share the Honey Garlic Chicken combo which I asked for the soup of the day.  It was hot and sour soup, and it was in a bit of a small bowel but it was delicious.   We shared the Honey Garlic Chicken with rice and still had plenty to take home."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of good Hakka and it is really hard to get me to switch from my regular Hakka spots. This was a really good meal. Especially in the area. No longer do I have to venture into rexdale or Scarborough for good Hakka. Chilli Chicken was decent but my favourite would have to be the Manchurian chicken. Saucy, tender and full of flavour. Crispy ginger beef was pretty good too. Generous portions and ample seating. A bit tucked away from the main road but definitely a place to check out when you're in the area and have a craving for Hakka. Did I mention great lunch specials too?"}
{"text":"Gonna make this review easy for both me and you.

PROS
- Affordable lunch and dinner specials. Check out their Hakka Style (family) dinners  that work out to be about $12/person.
- Flavorful spicy HOT food.
- Friendly waitress with a sweet smile that keeps your water glass full.
- Large space with high ceilings and lots of elbow room to enjoy your food: smallest table seats 4. They even have a private party room in the back.
- Open 7 days a week and holidays from 12noon-10pm.
- Free WiFi.
- Hot & Spicy Shrimp was flavorful and crispy on the outside. Decent sized bouncy shrimp. The fried rice that came with it was spicier.

CONS
- Layers of plastic table cloths on the table and fake plastic plants. Yeah, the decor leaves much to be desired.
- Fish Pakora was mostly batter with a little bit of fish, spice level HOT! Served with a dip that tastes like a sweet thousand island dressing.

Obviously the pros outweigh the cons here. Happy eating!"}
{"text":"OMG food is so good! People are amazing, proprtions are great. Very cost-worthy and the firendly staff. Overall a clean place. Recommend eating there when served fresh.

{"text":"Great place to visit but not my top choice for hakka food in Toronto. Chilli Chicken was very good."}
{"text":"Highly Disappointed!!
As soon as we entered the restaurant, plastic sheets on their tables was a total put off. The decor is weird. They have huge space and could have done a better job at making it beautiful.
Though the decor was a total put off we still decided to eat as the reviews were just fine. We ordered Fish Pakora in appetizers and ordered Bombay Chicken, Munchurian Chicken and Munchurian Chicken Chowmein. We waited there for almost 45 mins for the food. People who came after us got their food before us.
When the server brought our food, he first brought the chowmein. My husband and I got very confused as we haven't even been served our starter and this guy brought chowmein without our other Main Course dishes. I think they have no system, they don't plan how food should be served. This was another disappointment.
Food wasn't great either, it had a weird bitter taste. My husband said that it comes when you use dirty oil to fry. We couldn't eat anything so asked them for some boxes and packed everything to go.
When we tried the food again it tasted even worse so we had to throw everything. Would never go again. Total disaster and waste of money."}
{"text":"BEST DELIVERY IN AREA! Portions were incredibly big and very dish was so tasty! Will order again and again. We will have the fried rice in our fridge even after feeding on it 3 times!"}
{"text":"The chilli chicken is super flavourful and the portions are huge. We go out of our way to get lunch from my office."}
{"text":"The price is affordable and big portion - ranges from $5-15 per dish. Family style. Food is delicious but it's a hit or miss sometimes. I don't recommend getting pad Thai. Chilli chicken and Bombay chicken are great. Favourful. They're fried rice is mediocre. They're Manchurian fried rice just looks like regular fried rice, unless they mixed up my orders. 

All in all, they're a great place to go if you want affordable prices, family style and leftovers. Also, they have lunch specials on the weekdays :-)

The service is OK. Nice staff."}
{"text":"The food is good but the service isn't very great. Good customer service goes a long way."}
{"text":"Big portions small prices. Ordered the Manchurian chicken and steamed rice for two people, which wasnt even $12 before taxes. The chicken was enough for about three people, the service was quick, and the food was tasty. It was spicy, but not so spicy that it was unbearable. The only con about this place is the decor (plastic tables and chairs) but that's not a big deal considering the amazing prizes."}
{"text":"You're not going here for the ambiance. 

Food is on point. Scarborough Hakka good - cause most of the better Hakka joints in the city are in that borough. 
Lunch special portions at $10 mean you can have lunch AND leftovers for dinner!"}
{"text":"Chilli chicken...nothing to write home about! Very spicy but no flavour. If you want cheap, it is but it's not good. I pick Federicks any day!"}
{"text":"Ordered house special manchurian noodles. Mixed meats but very scarce.  Order was ready with 15mins they specified. Boring and bland. Place was empty late Sunday night."}
{"text":"I had the unfortunate opportunity of visiting Hakka Bro's couple days ago with a group of guys. To start off...we had made a reservation for 7:30 and when half of the group arrived, the waiter/owner/chef said that if the rest of the group did not show up by 7:30 we would lose our reservation (the whole restaurant was empty FYI). The service was 1/10 since the waitress did not even know what was on the menu herself and had a hard time understanding our orders that she had to call the waiter/owner/chef to write up a completely new order, wasting 20 mins of our time already. Usually hakka joints serve their food pretty fast but this place served their food faster than they took the order and that was pretty odd and questionable. The food tasted 5/10... nothing special. But thanks to Hakka Bro's, majority of the group suffered from horrible food poisoning the day after. IF YOU ARE READING THIS...SPARE YOURSELVES, unless you are looking to clear your system.. in that case go right ahead.

WILL NOT BE RETURNING"}
{"text":"I was hesitant given some reviews but I still gave it a try since it's close to home.

If you are picky and care about decor, then follow everyone else's review - plastic table clothes and plants. But if you're like me and can lool past that, then what a gem for food. 

Yes, there are some items that are not the best but overall, thus place gives generous portions and the food is great.

4 stars from me"}
{"text":"Went for the lunch special. Had Manchurian Chicken with fried rice. Quantity was great for the price paid, but the chicken basically just tasted of Cilantro and salt. Flavour was not well-balanced and there was so much Cilantro I was picking out long strands in the hope of salvaging some of the dish,  with little success. Service was adequate as I was the only one there."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch today, been wanting to try HB's for a while, glad I did!

First impressions, walked in, decor was neutral however the plastic tear away table cloths and spiral bulbs hanging off the ceiling demonstrated that it was done on the cheap. 

Looked over the lunch specials, choices were Menu A for $5.95 and B for $6.95, both had choice of pop, spring roll and soup, upgrade to fried rice was an acceptable $1.50. We ordered the Manchurian chicken and Szechwan chicken.

Plates arrived and first thing I notice is the potion size,  was definitely above average. Flavor on the Manchurian chicken was quite good, spice was perfectly balanced and the fried rice was a great combination. The szechuan chicken was more on the safe side and didn't have the usual veg and peppers that make it an exceptionally tasty dish. 

Overall, HB's is definitely worth a try...good food, larger portion size and price makes it a great value and the flavors are on par with most Hakka places...so would I return?  Yes! this place falls into the days I want to eat hakka to fill a hungry appetite without breaking the bank, and best of all, you don't have to drive to Scarborough for it!!"}
{"text":"Whenever I go to a specific type of restaurant, I seem to have a particular food to judge whether I might like a place.
When I DimSum, it Ha-Gow.   Pub-Wings.  Italian - Penne Arrabiata.  Steak - NY Strip.  Sushi - California Roll...and Hakka...Chilli Chicken!

I haven't been to a Hakka place in a while.  I used to go regularly to Wok of Asia when I was assigned to a long term project in the area.  Now that I'm stationed near Hakka Bros., it was great to find this place.

As I mentioned, I like to try to the Chilli Chicken when I go to a Hakka place for the first time.  Ordered the CC and Soup special - $5.95+tax.

The Hot and Sour soup was thick and a decent portion for a combo soup.  However, though it had some heat, it didn't have any real flavour.  Added a bit of salt and that helped.

The Chilli Chicken portion was generous.  Not a lot of times that I don't finish my meal but I had to give up as I was going into a food coma!  The chicken was moist and the batter was still crispy when served.  It had nice heat with about the right amount of peppers.  The rice however was a bit of a mess as it smelled off.  The trials and tribulations of going there well after the lunch hour.  

If I had to rank my CC experience, it would be Wok of Asia first, this a close second, Asian Garden, then Hakka 77...dead last...Hakka #1.

Nonetheless, this place is a good find.  Without the Yelp App, it would have been another fast food lunch bag letdown.  Probably back there even tomorrow to try the second dish I like at Hakka...General Tso-Toe-Tow-So-or whatever (they really need to figure out a standard way to spell his name!)."}
{"text":"If you want delicious meals with big portions for cheap, this is the place! Trust me, we always go here if we eat out."}
{"text":"I love hakka so gave this place a try... Here are my thoughts:
The 'gravy' in the Manchurian and chili dishes are bland.. watered down and thickened with corn starch. The fried rice is lackluster, the meat and shrimp in the fried rice was still cold.. The chef probably should fry it for more than 10 seconds after adding all the ingredients..

That being said.. I LOVE their chicken pakoras. Probably the best I've ever had. And they are served super crispy and piping hot. Sauce is delishh too."}
