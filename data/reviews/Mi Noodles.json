{"text":"Came here for lunch with the fam as it recently opened on Centre St. They have a private lot in the back that is shared among the other stores in that strip mall plus street parking in the neighbourhood. The restaurant itself is not very big but quite clean and well lit.  Their menu is offered in both English and Chinese and they serve Taiwanese and mainland China style noodles, food, and drinks. Upon being seated, you get a small serving of salted roast peanuts, which was nice but overly salted. I got a cup of water and was horrified that my cup smelled like bleach. Perhaps it's how they're going to keep their white plastic cups sparkling white.  I opted for the Taiwanese beef and tendon noodles in a tomato soup base. The beef was tender but the tomatoes were extremely sour, the tendons were a bit underdone, and the overall flavour of each component was lacking. I also got one piece of carrot and one piece of daikon thrown in there, which was not bad. The appetizer we shared was the steamed Shanghai dumplings. They are smaller and more expensive than the ones you can get at dim sum and again, they lacked flavour.  This restaurant has potential but needs to revamp their flavours. The prices are on the higher side, so for us, it was three bowls of noodles plus an appetizer that came up to just over $50+tip. Would I come back here again? Right now, it's a no."}
{"text":"I was there a few weeks ago, a total of 4 adults plus a baby.    The noodles were delicious but for the cost of the bowl of braised beef, it seemed quite costly.  After all, a big pot of braised beef is made in advance and all the chef has to do is to put it with the noodles.  I got one piece of daikon, one carrot and 3 pieces of beef and 2 pieces of tendon.    Service was horrible!  The waitress semi threw the menus on the table.  Came back to take our orders but didn't ask what we wanted to drink.  We were there with our 6 month old, of course along with a car seat and a diaper bag.  The waitress asked us to remove our items from the bench so in case customers came in, they can use the table despite numerous empty tables.  The waitresses were too busy talking to each other or on their phones to check on us.  They never once came by the table to refill our drinks or ask if the food was okay.    I should add that we were at the restaurant at 2pm on a Sunday.  It is definitely not a child friendly restaurant."}
{"text":"Pretty decent size bowl of noodles, we had the spicy beef house special. Service is good. Don't bother to get the expensive steamed buns. The buns weren't very good and you can buy better ones to steam at home (if you go to the chinese supermarket across the street). This place has a nice vibe and good service."}
{"text":"Just ok. The signature spicy beef soup wasn't spicy at all. Yes, you could add some on your own, but the only available heat source was chilli oil.. which I personally find kinda gross. Plus that's not the point. The standout for me was the appetizer of steamed spinach which came in a light ginger sauce with peanuts."}

{"text":"What should I eat on a cold winter Calgary night? The N1 - Mi Signature Spicy Soup Noodle with Braised Beef Shank & Beef Tendon!!   The first time I ate this, I was worried that the portion was small compared to what I'm used to having in a noodle soup (pho). But honestly, by the time I ate the delicious chunks of beef shank/tendon and chewy noodles and drank some of the rich beef broth...I was a happy camper! The big chunk of carrot, daikon and half an egg also helped round out the soup. Mi Noodle has a condiments station where you can get your own sauces to customize your soup. I like a combination of the pepper oil (numbing not spicy) and chili sauce with a tiny splash of black vinegar to add some acid to the soup and break down the richness.  Now that we have been back a half dozen times, I've officially declared this as one of my go-to soups...something that I crave when I haven't had it for a while. As a comparison, I've had a few Taiwanese beef noodle soups in Vancouver, and while this one is slightly lighter (broth and density of noodles), I can honestly say that this one is one of my favourites!   What about the rest of the menu?   The bubble teas and slushes are good! I've been too chicken to try durian fruit, but tonight I had it in my mango coconut milk slush...oh yum! Not stinky or scary like I imagined.   The Chinese Beef Pancake Roll was only ok. The beef was cold inside and the pancake wasn't hot enough to compensate for it.   Since I come here for the N1 soup, it's been hard for me to order anything else. Maybe next time!  Service is courteously friendly and attentive but not overly personable.   Bonus points: lots of parking in the back and parking on the street in front after 6pm and on weekends."}
{"text":"Ordered the \"braised beef in original broth soup noodle\" for $12.95. The pricing is on the upper limit of what a normal expected range would be. You can find cheaper noodles in Chinatown comparable in quality and amount. However, the overall quality of the food is good. The broth was sweet with a mild spice, but not too salty. The meat was free of residue and was tender. Each item was cooked appropriately and offered excellent texture without dryness or blandness. The portion size was just right. The noodles themselves were chewy and good; but, I'm wondering if it was a tad TOO chewy/firm, which caused the noodles not to harmonize completely well with the rest of the dish. The noodles were unique in that they were like two spaghetti strands fused together and then flattened. Overall, I wouldn't purposefully go out of the way to drive to this place to eat. However, if I'm in the area, hungry, and looking for some reliable noodles and properly/appropriately cooked/selected ingredients, I would stop by. The place is also bistro-styled, so it offers a good atmosphere to come chat and mingle."}
{"text":"The place is super cute. We chose it because every other restaurant was closed for some reason. It doesn't look that great on the outside but inside is modern and chic. But the décor is better than the good. It's kind of bland. I got the braised beef soup and it wasn't horrible but it's not the best soup either. I was disappointed."}
{"text":"I decided to stop by this little establishment and try out their noodles. I was not disappointed. I ordered their Braised beef in original broth noodle with half shank and half tendon. Which was not spiced heavily like other Chinese restaurants but it was mild enough that you could go to their small sauce station and pick your own sauce. I chose their pepper oil which was not at all disappointing. It was fragrant and made my lips and my mouth feel numb but not spicy. It totally enhanced the flavor. Then I ordered a traditional Chinese pork burger with their own sauce, which was OK....flavorful but still a little lacking in quantity and sustenance. Then I ordered the Century Egg (100 year preserved egg) and Tofu. Again it was more of a snack for sure. It was good but this is something anyone can make at home, for the price. Should not order it. Overall the service was awesome! The waitress made suggestions and was welcoming and filled my water when needed. The only thing I was a little bothered by was they propped the door open so all these flying pollen was everywhere inside and landing on my food. I'm not sure if they don't have air conditioning or was just wanting fresh air? But by food regulations doors can not be propped open due to insects and vermin. But still after picking the pollen off.....Food was good."}
{"text":"Today was my 3rd visit, met and old coworker for lunch. I was able to call to make a reservation which was nice. I got the mi signature spicy noodle soup with half shank and half tendon which is my go to and it was delicious. I love their noodles here! The popcorn chicken is a must order along with the juicy pork dumplings. They have a table at the front with different sauce- chili oils, vinegar etc. There is parking in the back."}
{"text":"Pork rib noodle soup was good.  Pork ribs were very tender and tasty.  Service was good but slow.  Hopefully they will be more efficient.  Food over all were tasty.  Choice of tea was unique."}
{"text":"We had lunch here, as guests of my dear sister-in-law. She and I are fans of Taiwan and Taiwanese snack food.   Some things we enjoyed today:  Noodles with intestines in spicy sauce (very yummy and satisfying, a splurge item for me).  Shanghai-style pork soup dumplings (compared to those in my summer home of Shanghai, they were pretty good).  Chongqing thin noodles (my daughter seemed to like them).  Fried chicken nuggets and chicken wings."}
{"text":"Tried the spicy noodle with braised beef and tendon.  Liked the noodles and the beef was tender.  Broth was flavourful and went really well with the noodles.  Also tried the clear noodles with chili sauce.  Really liked the chili sauce, but the noodles were not what I expected - they were like cold ho fan noodles that just came out of the refrigerator.  We also tried a variety of steam buns - all very delicious and made fresh.    Overall the food was very good - a bit on the pricey side, but delicious.  They also served a very fragrant tea that was absolutely wonderful to drink.  Sooooo warm and comforting."}
{"text":"I came here on a whim to order their juicy pork buns. I also ordered some hot milk tea. The food is acceptable but their milk tea is not. I paid over $5 for premixed powdered stuff I could make at home. I'm sorry, but how much trouble is it to make a real milk tea with real tea leaves? How about charging less if you're gonna just give customers premixed packets?"}
{"text":"This is a new noodle house that has opened up on centre street. I went here with a girlfriend to try out their food. For the vegetables, we tried the cucumber and the lotus. I enjoyed both and I liked that the lotus had some spice. We shared the beijing little stew noodle soup.  The noodles were chewy and veggies were good. I felt the broth was a little bit lacking in flavour. I'm not sure if its because they haven't opened for that long but it definitely needs some more depth.  We also tried the chinese burger, the bun was a little dense and the meat was just okay. The chinese burgers at  Auntie's Chinese are better. We didn't try the steamed buns but if I come again, I would probably try that."}
{"text":"This place is really a 3.5 stars rating. Had to round up.  So came here for dinner and we ordered a few dishes. My friend recommended me to this place. Well there are not a lot of restaurant that serves this kind of Chinese noodle soup. I got the braised beef noodle soup with chicken broth, the mini steam bun stuffed with juicy pork, Mi \"Rouga Mo\" Traditional Chinese Burger in Mi Sauce (Beef) and Seasonal Vegetables.  So the braised beef noodle soup with chicken broth was ok. It didn't have much flavor to it. But the beef was very tender that is for sure. Also the portion isn't really big. The mini steam bun was good and they did have soup in the middle. Only issue was the skin too thick. But this is Calgary and not Vancouver so can't expect too much.  The Traditional Chinese Burger was not bad either. I know restaurant in Vancouver makes it differently and usually uses a different sauce with more flavor. The Seasonal Vegetables were the best out of all dishes. I like the flavor and it goes well with the bok choi. Overall, for Calgary standard, its not bad. Also they are one of the few restaurants that serves this kind of noodle (in Vancouver you can easily find a handful). Choices are limited and may be a good thing.   Décor is nice inside but from the outside it looks nothing special. Girl washroom is weird It had an inset area which they covered with a poster. I had to go look and see if it doesn't lead to a kitchen or something.   Overall, would recommend coming here for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"***3.5 stars***  MI Noodles doesn't conform to either of the Chinese restaurant boxes Calgary is known for. It's not a big dim sum or banquet offering restaurant nor is it an HK style cafe. Think of it as more of a boutique style restaurant. If I was to base it solely on food I would give it 3 stars. I loved the lotus root and cucumber appetizer but thought the noodles dishes could have used more finesse. The noodles itself was good, but the flavors lacked a bit of substance. Value wise, there was a good amount of noodle to meat/veggie ratio and I liked that there was veggies in the noodle soup (absent from most HK style cafes now), although it came at a cost of about $2 more for the noodles than most cafes. What made MI noodles standout however is their quality of food. The noodles were handmade and fresh, the broth seemed to have less MSG and it wasn't a greasy mess of 90% noodle to protein/veggie ratio.   Compared to similar places in Toronto and Vancouver, this place can't hold a candle to them. But in our lil city where we have a lack of places like this, I think it's pretty good! I didn't try the fresh steam buns but every other tables around us did and seemed to enjoy it. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, but if I was in the vicinity and was to suggest some here, I would suggest MI Noodles.   isn't a big Chinese restaurant nor is it a HK style cafe"}
{"text":"First ever Taiwanese restaurant.  I was blown away. I can't say a bad thing about this place. Get a seat before it fills up."}
{"text":"Review: dinner.  Bottomline: average Taiwanese food with a higher price tag than other similar restaurants.  Atmosphere: the restaurant is full of decor that represent Taiwan, which I thought was pretty cool. What I found weird was the place they store their high chairs: inside a washroom.  Food: we ordered the mi signature spicy noodle soup and the braised pork on rice. The mi signature spicy noodle soup had good flavor and interesting noodle texture, but otherwise nothing spectacular to write home about. The braised pork on rice was a bit over-seasoned and monotone. In regards to the drinks, we complimented our meals with the coconut milk and red bean mango slush and the black plum green tea. The mango slush rose above everything else but the green tea fell flat. The slush was fresh and everything worked really well together. The green tea was unbelievably sweet.  Value: prices were more expensive than other Taiwanese joints with portions being small to average. Drinks were expensive, especially if you were looking for fresh fruit. The most expensive bubble tea there will run you close to 10 bucks, which I'd rather spend on a pint of premium beer.  Encore? No I don't think I will be coming back."}
{"text":"This place is new and unique in calgary as far as I know. It's something different to pho or ramen. They have good selection of Chinese style noodle and a good selection of sides. Everything taste good and the price is very reasonable. Can't wait to go again"}
