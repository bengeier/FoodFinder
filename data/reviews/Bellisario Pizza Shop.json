{"text":"Okay so I just moved to the outskirts of Duquesne, PA which is outside of Pittsburgh from Harrisburg, PA of all places. Where I am at, really there is no delivery but these guys did. They were nice and cordial and cheap but I have been spoiled by the pizza shop in Harrisburg, Downtown, run my an old world Italian guy named Luigi. That pizza is/was MILES better than this. This crust, while thin, did not have flavor and was hard. The slices were small for their 8 slice which I did like. The cheese was good. The sauce was meh. I've definitely had way better. 2 stars for being cheap and delivering."}
{"text":"This pizza is awesome New York style pizza. Sauce is just the right balance of sweet and savory. Toppings are ample. Thin crust dusted with flour. Excellent pricing, too. 
Located in the breezeway of Duquesne Village shopping center. Only takes cash so be prepared for that."}
{"text":"Incredible. The Pizza is the best in the area, by far. The Sandwiches are great as well, but in my opinion the best food they have is their Calzones, which I highly recommend. This place deserves a 5-Star as far as their food is concerned, but the dine-in potion of the shop is tiny and makes dining-in quite unenjoyable, so I'm forced to give them 4-stars. Would highly recommend either picking up or having something delivered, not so much on eating there though."}
{"text":"There is a reason they were given the best pizza award. The pizza is huge and the hoggies are awesome. The family that owns this place are really Italians. So your getting authentic italian pizza and food. They have late hours but no delivery past a current time."}
{"text":"We started ordering here because we were looking for a good thin crust pizza and now we don't order from anywhere else. It is absolutely the best pizza in West Mifflin. The crust is thin and crispy. The sauce is simply perfect,  and the topping are taste fresh and flavorful. We also like the Italian hoagies. If you like thin crust pizza, don't even try any other place."}
{"text":"What, you haven't been to Bellisario's yet? This is about the only red sauce pizza I ever get a craving for, and boy howdy is it good. The crust is on the thin side and ever so crisp on the bottom, while still having enough dough on the edge to provide a nice chewy bit at the end of your slice. The dough itself is flavorful, not too... well, doughy. The sauce is great, and they don't drown the pizza in it. There's just enough cheese; not so much it's an overwhelming grease slick and not so little you can't tell it's there. If you can go while Mama's working, all the better.

You can eat in here; they have four or five booths and generations worth of family photos on the walls. Two of us split a small (8-cut) pizza with one topping ($9) and with our two cans of pop we were out for $10. You can't beat that. And I'd put Bellisario's pizza up against any in the city.

I grew up a five minute walk away. My mom loved Bellisario's and I have a lot of fond memories of walking through the alley to pick up a cheese pizza to bring home, my mom being too dollar-conscious to pay for delivery when there were perfectly able-bodied children around to go pick it up. Every time I have a slice, it brings back great memories. But I've had outside confirmation that it really is as awesome as I think it is.

It's a little divey, stuck in the back of an old shopping plaza, but it's perfect. If you're in West Mifflin (say, going to Kennywood), drive over and eat a pizza. They've also got hoagies and calzones, and I think that's about it. But with pizza this good, who cares?"}
