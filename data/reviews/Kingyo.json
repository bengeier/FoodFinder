{"text":"Great space, a lot of fun with all the pachinko machines on the wall. It may have the best combo meals in the city! Health vegetarian combo @ $9 is a steal! Everything taste delicious, and there is a lot of it. Don't miss out on the dessert menu, tofu tiramisu, yummmm."}
{"text":"Now I don't need to wait for trips to Vancouver to get my fix. This is the best Japanese tavern in town. It's much more comfortable than Guu (chairs have backs). The Tuna Tataki is brilliant. Try the addictive Pork Ramen."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere here, its an open space concept and the restaurant is quite big. This was my first time here and the service was amazing, best service you could get! Our servers were friendly and helpful with the menu they also recommended really great dishes.   In my opinion these dishes are a must try: the mackerel sushi (slightly seared and really fresh), uni shooters (raw quail egg with potatoes) and ahi tuna salad. Those were my fav dishes that we ordered here."}
{"text":"Great service. Very nice ambient and relaxing lighting and music. Food is amazing. The hot stone beef tongue is a must order. The appetizer jewel box is also absolutely wonderful."}
{"text":"Personally think it beats Guu. Great service, food and ambience!!! The sashimi is so fresh tho I've no idea what fish exactly those are from. The desserts are just heavenly good and they are not too sweet. Try the roasted beef tongue or whatever, and the scallop ceviche! Omg my mouth is watering just thinking of them."}
{"text":"Amazing place! My favourite izakaya in Toronto. Dishes are always great quality. Good portions. Nice clean cute place. Service is great and friendly staff. When you walk in, you see dorameon playing by the bar area. Overall good dining experience with great food!"}
{"text":"This is my go to restaurant in the city! I probably visit this restaurant once a month and without a doubt they never disappoint! Also, the pricing is very very good for the quality of food."}
{"text":"We've been here a couple of times and have found the service slowly diminishing but the food has always been well cooked.   Unfortunately this time as the server was brining us our food she spilled hot miso soup on my husband scalding his leg and ruining his pair of shorts. She did not notify the manager and then avoided our table the entire meal. We had to notify the manager and their initial response was that \"hot soup is tricky and can be spilled easily\". We reiterated that they could have really hurt somebody and reluctantly she offered to pay for the cleaning of my husbands shorts. The main issue was that she scalded my husbands leg. Unfortunately we won't be returning and please beware of spilling soup!"}
{"text":"Amazing and friendly service! It's a great place for large groups and families too! I appreciate the fact that we can make reservations here, unlike the other ramen and guu-like restaurants/bars. My favourite is the pork belly dish, salads and ramen! A satisfying and filling meal! I would skip the lineup at other Japanese restaurant and head over here instead!!"}
{"text":"The Ramen soup and ribs were very memorable. The servers are very attentive  and the ambiance is modern mixed with traditional. Nice unpretentious restaurant."}
{"text":"Recently revisited this restaurant with a more adventurous group.  This was a much better meal as my eating companions were more willing to try out some of the more adventurous menu items. We had the tofu with mushroom and ebi mayo were both good, although the ebi mayo had too much mayo in my taste.  Ordered the Tantan Ramen again, which was delicious.  We also ordered the hamachi carpaccio, which was refreshing.  I would recommend also the teriyaki black cod cheek on the specialty menu.   The sea urchin shooter was not worth ordering, despite the other reviews, unless you really need a sea urchin fix.   Overall, glad with the restaurant as it is a nice addition to the Japanese Izakaya scene and more authentic that Guu."}
{"text":"Love this place! It has become a regular spot for me now and thought I'd write a quick review.   Food is a little pricey but it's well worth it and the atmosphere is fun, loud and entertaining if you're by the bar. If you're looking for a quiet place to eat this is not the place then.   Some of my favorite dishes  1. Karaage (deep fried chicken)  2. Short Rib (must be starving to order this)  3. Ebi-Mayo (prawns) 4. Salmon carpaccio (d-lish)  I suggest to make reservations for the weekend!"}
{"text":"Food: I ordered tuna avocado tartar and karage.   tuna avocado tartar: *** stars. 4 mini garlic baguette slices were served along with the tartar. Fair size of avocado and tuna was mixed inside it.  Couldnt taste much of tuna to be honest. Waiter also mentioned that additional baguette slices would cost 50 cents. Sauce lacked creativity. Was too close in taste to plain soy sauce...  karage with magic powder (their signature dish): * star. Oh... that magic powder = salt w slight hint of pepper. (Typically served with korean chicken actually)  Service: ** stars. the waiter messed up my order and I received my first dish by the time my friends almost finished eating their second dishes. Then when I mentioned that my second dish (karage) hasnt arrived, he quickly apologized but when it was served shortly after it tasted like a microwaved kfc chicken. It was soggy on the outside and oily on the inside as well. My friends all mentioned that they seemed to have reheated what they made a little earlier to expedite the serving time.   I would not return to kingyo and certainly not recommend to others..."}
{"text":"Not a huge fan of expensive Asian food but this place was suggested by a friend whose a fan of the Vancouver location.   I couldn't help but compare this place to Guu the entire time since both places originated in Vancouver.   It's more spacious than Guu and they take reservations. Service was amazing and very attentive - I couldn't believe how happy and friendly everyone was!  The food was plated beautifully and some dishes were a little pricey but they have a good handful of \"economical\" dishes which I really appreciated.   Their famous fried chicken dish was good...but not mind blowing. There were only two of us at the table so we couldn't order a huge variety. I would go back if we had a larger group so we could sample more dishes."}
{"text":"Amazing food! I went there for a friend's bday party and the dishes were tasted fantastic. It's been a long time since I had a satisfying experience at illaya place like this.  I order fried Brussels sprouts, tuna sushi and grilled fish from the special menu. My friends tried different things from the menu and we shared or tasted each other's dishes. I liked all the dishes!   Favorite is fried Brussels sprouts, tuna sushi and pork belly, hotpot beef noodle.  I highly recommend it. One star less because even though they were super friendly they didn't pay as much attention as they could have to us. we have to wave them two times for our bills. But it's minor to me. I am going back there again."}
{"text":"Stone grilled beef tongue is the best. The food decor is fabulous, every dish is like a small painting btw I like the \"actual\" wasabi here"}
{"text":"Chose this place for my husband's birthday and it could not have been more perfect. The menu is huge and on top of that they had many food and drink specials. The home made ginger soda was the best i've had (and I've had homemade ginger soda at a number of restaurants). Our group had a variety of picky eater. I dont eat red meat and some other don't eat fish, but there was still plenty for everyone.   Favorite dishes: My husband and brother in law could not stop raving about the short ribs. I loved the black cod, and ebi-mayo. We also had scallop sushi off the specials that was very yummy as well as an avocado, tuna and shrimp tartare.   Also, the desserts were phenomenol. We had the almond tofu, which had a delicious berry layer. If I wasn't so full by that point I would've had three of them. We also had a green tea creme brulee from the specials which was also amazing.   The chicken wings and crab salad were good too, but probably not something I would rush to order again.   Every dish was nicely presented and our server was very attentive.   Because the menu was so big, this is definitely the type of place I need to go back to. There were so many dishes we didn't even get to try, especially from the sashimi section. Prices also seemed very reasonable for most dishes and they take reservations which is great!"}
{"text":"Very good Izakaya and better than Guu as it is way less noisy and the food as good or better. Carpaccio dishes are excellent - we tried all of them - Tuna being the best one. Karaage is amazing (table of 4 we had two orders)  the baterra style Sushi is good, especially the Aburi Toro & Avocado 2Tone Battera... however we thought the carpaccio's were better  definitely worth the visit and I will return it's a great place"}
{"text":"I had heard a lot of good things about this place and been wanting to try it for a while, but unfortunately was quite disappointed. We ordered the sashimi sampler (which was probably the best dish), oysters (not good) and avocado/toro sushi (lacking flavour and rice was bitter and too hard)."}
{"text":"Made a reservation for a good size group of people to enjoy this top 10 restaurant of 2012! This place replaced 'Stone Grill'. And I'd say it was a good replacement. The restaurant has a lot of booth station set-up and is a bit dark. But my focus is usually on the food only.  Our server is a white guy who speaks japanese with his fellow colleague which is interesting. We wanted to order the famous 'Uni Shooter' but they were all out.  For drinks we got some mojitos which were yuzu orange flavour the pomegranate. Both were alright and refreshing. I also got their home made ginger ale which was not bad.  For food we got a whole heap of it....So here goes...  Karaage- Deep fried chunks of chicken with white powder. The chicken was nice and moist and delicious.  Cream Buta Kukani- Pork belly slowly stewed in potato sauce. The piece was generous on this dish and was the size of one lasagne piece. My gf enjoyed this very much, and it convinced others to order as well.  Big Kingyo Short Rib- Again, good size portion on the rib. It wasn't short rib, but something else. It was very meaty, but the down side is the sauce is a bit overly salty.  Grilled Black Cod- This fish is very expensive and I got a 5oz size which is the standard for most restaurant charging the premiums on this fish. Nice and tender and delightful.  Stone Bowl Seafood Sea Urchin Bowl- Rice on a bowl with seafood and uni...What's not to like.  Real Crab California Roll- The name says it all..Real crab meat, but I find it was a little watery with the crab meat.  Aburi Toro w/Avocado- Basically seared toro with avocado. Each size looks rectangular bite size portion. Was the most expensive roll, but they do work on this roll.  Spicy Chopped Tuna with Manga- Good roll.  Spicy Chopped Scallop Roll- Good roll as well.  They also have daily specials on another menu. This place is an Izakaya, but not overly loud where you can't hear your friends conversations. The service and food was great, and I would definitely come back to try other stuff here.  This place you can definitely splurge or can go nice and easy. If you taking a date, you should make the call on the order so you can control the spending...unless you looking for bow chica wow wow!!!"}
{"text":"Great appetizers! Excellent service and a great selection of dishes such as battera sushi"}
{"text":"Unfortunately Kinyo lost 1 star on my 2nd try. My favourite beef tataki was almost well done which made it become one of the worst; and the Aburi shime saba battera still collapses when picked up. -------------------------------------------------- I'm always more interested in the sashimi side of Japanese food than the others, and Izakayas tend to focus less on sashimi. That's why I didn't go until yesterday although I have heard about Kingyo a long time ago.  It was a mistake. After yesterday, I am happy to announce that I think Kingyo is just as good as Jabistro.  We went 10pm so there were lots of seats, we got the corner booth, it was comfortable and roomy. The lighting was perfect, not too light or dark. The service was awesome as well, most of them were Japanese girls who were pretty, friendly, and professional, which is rather rare in a lot of Japanese restaurants.  It was a birthday dinner so we ordered a lot a lot for two. The pomegranate mojito was okay, it would be a \"good\" if they can make it generally stronger in flavour. Their special kozaemon sake was good, reasonably priced (I guess that's why they are \"$$$\" while Jabistro is \"$$$$\" lol) and served.  First dish was the cold lotus root. It was decent, but not too special.  The beef tataki was awesome. I'm a big fan of beef tataki, so I order it whenever it appears on a menu. Kingyo's can be rated as #2 best in downtown area in my opinion; the first was Kaizen's, which the beef itself is simply more flavourful without any sauce. As of Kingyo's, it's a perfect combination of good quality beef, tasty sauce, a touch  of deep fried garlic, and the greens. Just wrap it, dip it, eat it, and smile. Definitely recommended.  The sashimi was simply a big surprise. As I mentioned before, Izakayas tend to focus more on their kitchen menus than sashimi, they tend to have less options. Also, a lot of them are serving frozen fish or a mixture of fresh and frozen ones, even the well rated ones. The difference can be only tasted by someone who really loves it. So we ordered the $50 seven kinds assortment, and I have changed my mind on Izakaya's capability on sashimi, well just Kingyo's. They have normal kinds: salmon, tuna, hamachi, scallop. My favourite uni, and a new kind: Katsuo. Everything was fresh, and you definitely know they are good stuff when something simple as salmon would melt in your mouth.  I also really appreciate the amount of time they put on the food and detail. The soy sauce it came was not the ordinary ones, it was specialty sashimi soy made of sweet soy mixed with wasabi sauce. And the candle decor we got on the plate was made of very thin sliced radish, so delicate.   Grilled snow crab. It was recommended by the host, we tried, no regret. Fresh crab legs  with taste of sea water was good enough already, they made it even better with mayonnaise and katsuo flower soy sauce.  Shojin assortment. $18 a bit pricy for 9 tiny dishes of vegetable. But it's definitely cheap for the amount of effort and time needed to make, that's why I guess they only make 10 of them per day. This dish is made for someone who appreciates life, who appreciates the art of making 9 different kinds of vegetable in 9 different ways, all very light, but extremely tasty.  Stone grilled Tajima beef. Flavoured tajima beef with hot stone, just imagine how juicy and delicious it can be. Just the word tajima explains itself. The sauce it came with were white soy and barbecue sauce, well mixed but as the beef was already flavoured it seemed a bit salty for me.   Aburi shime saba battera. I like how creative the chef was with the sauce and combination, the flavour of the sushi was definitely top notch. But we found the sushi rice was a bit harder than it should, and how easy it collapsed was also a little disappointed for a nice place like this."}
{"text":"They have limited amount for the deluxe lunch bento, which I recommend. The portion might not look a lot, but once you start eating you will get full in the end. I also tried the katsu-don bento, which is very good. So, make sure more than 2 people go so you can try variety from the menu."}
{"text":"I would definitely give Kingyo a rating of 4.5 stars normally, i've been here many times for both lunch and dinner and have had good experiences every time, this 3 star rating is based on service and what could have been better.   Initially booked for a larger group, while booking on the telephone they tried to convince us to take on the set menu for a set price, but here is the thing, they only force you to take on that set menu if you have a group of 20 or more, we reserved for 12 people and they seemed very insistent. We sternly rejected it.   Initially we tried to asked for seperate bills of 2, since we were all couples were sharing amongst themselves, we didn't think the request would be too difficult. They told us they would check and told us no. That was totally fine, we'd work out the math afterwards. The problem was when we started ordering our food, some couples ordered the same thing and they decided to platter it on one giant plate despite couples who ordered it were sitting in different areas of the table, how were they suppose to share? This happened TWICE, another couple ordered sashimi, and another couple ordered just salmon sashimi, they decided to plate it all on one platter and didn't inform anyone that the salmon was for the other couple at the end of the table.   The server comes to us when we were literally just about finishing up our sashimi platter only to inform us that the salmon sashimi was for the couple down at the end of the table, she looked at us as if we were suppose to do somethig about it? No one told us, your servers just plopped it down on my table, everyone was confused as hell. She stood there awkwardly as if she was waiting for me to give the rest to my other friend. She said she would talk to the chef as if we were at fault. Anyways, they brought over new fish for my friends and that was thankfully over...sorta. The severs did not know who ordered what either, a lot of back and fourth was going on. We all stayed in our seats, nobody shuffled around, we ordered in couples...why was this so difficult?   We do enjoy your food Kingyo, we'll probably be back but I do wish it wasn't so complicated."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! The food was absolutely delicious, the atmosphere was fun and friendly, and the service was great. I can't wait to go back. The most authentic Japanese restaurant I've been to in Toronto!!  Kudos to Koji!"}
{"text":"A cockroach crawled across the table.  I can write about everything else, but that was really the highlight of the evening for me.  We asked to speak to the manager about it, they never came out.  Though the server apologized, she did not discount our bill.     The decor is very nice, but we waited over an hour for our appetizers and couldn't flag a server down to save our lives throughout the meal. The service in general was extremely slow and disorganized.   I have no complaints about the food, and thought the prices were reasonable and the plating excellent, but for some reason I just couldn't take my mind off the cockroach that crawled around the table.  Maybe it's just me.  I will never come back."}
{"text":"Came there with high expectations but was disappointed in their food, especially the drink. I ordered a cocktail Lychee Chu Hi, it tasted just like lychee juice diluted with water, couldn't taste any liquor. If you go for there food is fine, but not the drink!"}
{"text":"First time here for lunch today. They have various lunch selections. Apart from their regular set of lunch, They also served tapas that you can order separately including their famous stone grilled beef tongues and chicken karaage. I ordered the chicken karaage and KatsuDon, which is their special for anniversary. They were both delicious and the price was reasonable. However, I like their dinner better."}
{"text":"I seen really great reviews and awesome yummy looking photos from this place so we figured we would give it a try. When we got there the hostess said it would be a half hour wait which was expected since they were busy and took down our number to call us when the table was ready. The thing that ticked me off was that there were a few tables empty for a long period of time and no one was being seated. Maybe they were waiting for a bigger crowd...fine. They finally called us and we were still waiting. BUT there was 3 people that came in well after us that also had to wait at least 20 minutes even though there were empty tables, suddenly they were seated!! I noticed that the hostess knew one of the 3 guys and that is why I believed they were seated before us. I questioned another staff why they were being seated and they advised they had reservations?! Really? If that was true, why were they not seated at that empty table 20mins ago when it was empty for so long? Is it now a coincidence that I complained and we are being seated at that other empty table that no one was sitting in for an hour? Ot doesn't male sense to me at all!!  So we are finally seated. The food was disappointing...sadly...the shrimp thing was very saucey and nothing original, the fried chicken was umm..can't find a good word for it BUT the sashimi was very fresh and good.   That's all I can say about this place. I will never come back...usually crappy food makes me sad but this place jus pisses me off. Oh yea n pricey for the food that is not as great as everyone makes it seem. Tsk"}
{"text":"Enjoy the food here. Unexpected amount of fat on the vinegar short ribs. Expected amount of fat on the pork belly ;P  Would go back. Definitely many creative dishes to try. Worth the price"}
{"text":"This place is great.   The special daily lunch is incredible! Delicious,  varied.   The staff was so friendly too"}
{"text":"Honestly, the best Japanese Izakaya restaurant I have been to in Toronto!!! Eat your heart out, Guu!   Hamachi Carpaccio: Must-try! The yellowtail is so tender and flavorful! I'm not a fan of overly  tart and citrusy flavors so I really appreciate how the lemon wedge is placed on the side so you can dictate how tart you want the dish to be! Normally I don't order carpaccio because it is overly tart but I'm so glad I took the risk this time!  Stone Grilled Beef Tongue: Really chewy but good if you are a big red eat meater which I'm not. Ordered for the kick of cooking the beef on the hot stone, but I'm Asian, so it equates to eating hot pot, that's why I'm neutral on this dish.  Marinated Kaisen Don: All kinds of wonderful! The salmon caviar just adds a lovely texture when you pop the litle bubbles in your mouth!   Spicy Chopped Tuna Battera: Another must-try! The sushi was so tender that you could split the sushi with your chopsticks! The equivalent of letting a knife slice easily through steak! It was heaven! All sushi should be pressed in my opinion but not realistic alas! So is life. Haha.  Pork Tantan Ramen: My friend had this and let me try a little. I don't want to judge it based off my bite but it tasted really good. It is different from traditional ramen though so if you're a traditionalist about your ramen like me it might not suit your personal preference.  Brown rice tea: Very high quality, with a unique almond flavor which was heaven for this tea lover!  All in all, the food was incredible, the quality of the sashimi was undeniable and the service was great. They didn't notice us leaving until we were near the exit, but when they did finally notice, the waiter ran towards us just so he could open the door for us!"}
{"text":"If you like Izakaya, maybe you will like this place. We went to this place nestled in the heart of Cabbagetown to celebrate my sister-in-law-to-be's bday.  As you enter, you are greeted loudly by a hostess followed by numerous echoes reverbrating throughout the restaurant.  I personally am not a fan of Izakaya because generally the greeting is not genuine - its built-into the job description, the food is trendy but pricey with hit or miss quality, and the all female wait staff, although appeared genuinely Japanese, do not speak much english.    The decor was a cross between a bar and a hip lounge resto.  There are neon flashing decor and a giant screen playing japanese anime.  It had features that reminded you of a traditional Japanese resto such as wood panels and japanese fabric visuals however it is lined with burgundy benches akin from a sports bar, and an open bar/kitchen akin a trendy japanse lounge/resto.  This place is hip/cool but treading so many styles as if it could not make up its mind on what it wants to be.  As for the food, we ordered many dishes  - Real Snow Crab California roll - $10.80 - was OK, too much mayo - could not taste the crab - Spicy chopped scallop roll - $9.20 - was Excellent but a little skimpy on the scallop. Would order this again. - Lightly Seared Tender Beff Tataki roll - 10.50 - Mediocre - tasted like any other beef roll, not bad but nothing orgasmic - 5 kind of sashimi - assortment $30 (3 pieces of Prawn, 3 x hamachi, 3 x salmon, 3 x tuna, and 3 tiny slices of one scallop) - great display and tasted fresh but overall lacked wow factor - Garlic Tuna Takaki & Ponzu Jelly - $8.20 -  Was below par - did not taste as moist as you would expect, portion was ok but the ponzu jelly was piled on top and too sparse - served with raw onion slices and deep fried garlic - was expecting my eyeballs to roll to the back of head from the experience however was very underwhelmed - Salmon Oyako Battera - $12 - 5 pieces - Excellent! Salmon was fresh and covered with roe/herbs, served with Ponzu sauce. - Red Tuna and Tiger Prawn Avocado Tartar - $10.80 - Hot Mess - This mix came in a shape of a hamburger and 4 slices of crustinis.  It didn't take long for it to look like a hot mess after we tried to top the crutinis with the world's smallest wooden spoon.  I could not taste the red Tuna -we all agreed it tasted fresh, but overall UNmemorable.  - Deep fried chicken wings - $8.20 - this tower of 6 chicken wings were crispy drizzled with some kind of tasty spicy almost cajun powder - these were a HIT!   The waitress came around taking all of our sauce trays away after the first food tray.  It seems they advocated that 4 people use communal saucers to dip their soya/wasabi mix.  uh hmm...I DONT THINK SO!  Soya sauce was sparse and came into a small jar with a cork lid the size of you thumb - the kind that comes with a keychain and sand from a souvenir shop.  Wasabi came on a piece of wood cut and painted like a small shirt - very cute, was tempted to take this home in my pocket.   For drinks we had sake $9, kyoto lemon green tea $1.8 per person (tasted like any other green tea served FREE in other japanese restos) and served in a cafe press, sapporo beer $5.50 a pint, and two glasses of white wine from a very limited wine selection.  The service was OK - we had 3 different servers/food runners throughout the meal none of which could speak fluent english. We did receive a wet towel  that came in a tablet that looked like an antacid but expanded as water was poured over it.  I felt like it was an intermission at a play. A fresh towel to wipe our greasy post chicken wing hands.  The bathrooms are equipped with mouthwash and instruments to floss your teeth. Apparently, someone cares about your oral hygiene.  We were seated underneath a vent so i ate my entire meal wearing my leather coat the whole time. I looked around but no one else had their coat on. All kitchen staff are men that wore a wool toque or a bandanna - regulation or are you COLD too?!. They were all asian with the exception of one caucasian - he was tall and stood out - we joked he must be the only one who is mute when others hollered greetings in Japanese.  The logo for this place was a goldfish.  We wondered the whole night if the name Kingyo had anything to do with a goldfish - no we have nothing else better to do than to contemplate these deep thoughts.  The damage was $160 with tax and tip for 4 people for everything listed above so it was $40 per person. We were all fairly full and not in need of a second meal.  Overall a good place for a first or second date - the place is so full of noise that you will definitely not be stuck with awkward silence."}
{"text":"Been coming here for lunch. Last time we went there, the price was increased by $3-4 each meal. That's a lot for lunch. Kids lunch used to be $10 if I remember correctly is now $13. Who will pay $13 for kids lunch? Yes they added ice cream which was not included in kids lunch before, but $13? Really? Lunch menu is now the price of a dinner. I'm very sad to see this price change. Won't go back."}
{"text":"The food was delicious, and the staff was friendly. Too bad about the *enormous rat* scurrying around the dining room. (Our waitress was apologetic, but our bill came in at full price.) Could never go back."}
{"text":"Loved this place!! I love Guu but here I could actually have a conversation with my dining partner."}
{"text":"Came here with a party of 8 people for a birthday dinner on Friday November 13, 2015. I read other Yelper's mixed reviews and had my fingers-crossed for a great evening.  My first, and my LAST time coming here.  Here's what happened: we had reservations for 6pm, and we were informed there is a 2-hour seating limit. Everybody arrived by 6:10pm. We placed our food orders and were served water. So we sit, chat, and wait. At 6:55pm, the waitress comes to our table and tells us its \"last call\" for food from our table. WTF? I told her that the entire table has not received ANY of our food, we were sitting at the table drinking our water and you have the audacity to tell us that? She says \"yes, sorry.\" Wow, such fake empathy!  8 people and they still mess up our orders. They missed our Pork Tantan Ramen ($10.80). We cancelled the order and they still charged us for it - always double check your bill); 2 friends ordered the Kingyo Bomb dish....at 7:20pm, we follow-up on its whereabouts. Guess what? \"Sorry, because we only have one person inside the kitchen that makes it\". She says it hasn't been made yet and it \"may\" take another 10 minutes. Both decided to cancel the order.  I have to be honest. The Yuzu \"Ankake\" Bokkake Udon ($11.80) barely passed the grade. The $21 Short Ribs was expensive but was good. The \"sampler\" Jewel box ($13.80) sucked and was a total ripoff.  It annoys me when I see a restaurant put food on top of a big green leaf and  suddenly they call themselves a \"high-class\" restaurant LOL. Oh and to top it off, they charged me an auto-gratuity because of the party.  Take my $5.79 tip Kingyo, because you won't get another cent off me!   *We drove to Sansotei Ramen afterwards because we were still hungry. Afterall, we basically only had \"appetizers\" in the 2 hours we were at Kingyo.  Pics with comments to follow...."}
{"text":"This restaurant is huge! It looks like they revamped an old bar into a restaurant and the decor is ok. Doesn't feel like an izakaya.   The food is good. We tried a lot of dishes that had unique platings. It was fun! Prices are a little steep considering the portions are small. There is a lot to choose from the menu  Side note: there are really annoying games that are mounted on the walls in the front part of the restaurant with constant flashing lights."}
{"text":"It's ok, nothing special. I still think Sushi Run is better. Their price is kind of high for little amounts of food. Hubby and I ordered 5 assorted sashimi and we only got about 10 pieces for $27. Spicy tuna sushi had too much rice. The only cool thing about this spot is that it's actually Japanese owned."}
{"text":"Tried to make reservations for 5 the night before and they told me that only the  large \"fish table\" (communal table) was available from 6pm to 8pm on Saturday night.  They allowed us to sit until 8:15 and I still did not see any other parties waiting for the communal table.  It was busy but not packed. More toned down atmosphere than Guu.   Service was efficient and attentive.  They were helpful in making suggestions.    Sea urchin shot did not blow me away.  Not crazy for the rice.  Felt like I was eating urchin cold congee.  And quail egg was already broken for us which is unusual.  However, in terms of the flavours they were light and independently refreshing.    Sashimi - freshest that I've tasted so far. 7 assortiment $45 gives you 3 slices or portions of various sashimi including sea urchin. Tuna was awesome.  Gorgeous display.  Would highly recommend.   Draft sake also very good warm as server suggested.  We ordered a second round 300ml but was puzzled at  getting another bottled kind instead.  Doubled checked the menu and discovered it was  the one for 16$ sake.  Server came to apologize and asked if we'd be ok with drinking this one.  We agreed and thought our bill would be adjusted.   I didn't double check the bill before paying and realized that they did not adjust the difference of 6$, which is not significant amount but think that if I'm paying for the yummy draft kind I should have been enjoying that instead.  The 16$ bottle had stronger alcohol taste.  Definitely inferior to the addictive draft kind. So double check your bill if your orders have been mixed up.  All other dishes were good, and better portion sizes than Guu.  Atmosphere and spacious design is definitely more chillaxed than Guu.  Personally prefer Kingyo over Guu in this regard.  Especially in terms of comfort, even the fish communal table is double the size of Guu.  The entire time we were there, our table was only seated by another couple at the far corner, so we still had privacy and not worrying about how I can get out of the bench tables without hitting someone like I did at Guu.    At the end of the meal they even gave a little packet of Pocky sticks to my son which was really sweet.  Would return for more draft sake, sashimi and carpaccio dishes.  A soothing Izakaya joint that hits all the right notes."}
{"text":"Kingyo is a solid addition to the izakaya scene - hopefully it's not too early to the new east-end scene in Cabbagetown.  Compared to Guu, I thought Kingyo's food was superior overall and the vibe is a little more chill - they still yell out Japanese greetings and goodbyes, but it's not nearly as cramped or loud as Guu.  Some of my favourite dishes: - Ebi-mayo (deep fried prawn with chili mayo sauce) - Grilled black cod - Stone grilled beef tongue (more for the spectacle than the taste, which wasn't too exciting) - karaage with magic powder (deep fried chicken served with salty spice)  Other dishes: - The ramen was actually quite good - The seafood sea urchin stone bowl could have had more punch - Aburi tuna was extremely fresh  Overall a great dinner experience.  Sidenote: if you're a pachinko addict, this place will drive you crazy. They have pachinko machines up on the wall where you can't reach them"}
{"text":"worth to try and nice environment with sweet service:) I have been visited a lot of izakaya(and even some in Japan) but this one makes me feel so close to Japan. I highly recommend the taco wasabi with the option hot&hot(BTW I am a wasabi person haha), the uni shooter the beef tongue. For some personal reason that I didnt really enjoy the fried chicken cuz it was fried too dry. Overall, great experience for me and my friends:) We will go Kingyo again."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Izakaya i've been to in Toronto.  We went on a friday night without making reservations. Arrived at around 7pm and we got seated in about 25mins. The place was pretty much packed by that time and a long line up started building.   We ordered the Goma Ramen Salad with Pork and Spicy Cod Roe Dressing (loved the ramen), Hamachi Carpaccio (pretty good), Nagoya Style Ebi Tempura Rice Ball (very nice presentation), and Kyoto Style Shojin (very interesting, this is supposed to be vegan Buddhist monk food, and they only make 10 servings a day). Everything was really good, good service, good food, good ambiance. Portions are decent, and everything came very quickly.  We also tried the 2 Color Almond Tofu and the dessert special matcha green tea creme brulee for dessert.   I would come back for sure."}
{"text":"Maybe due to personal preference or high expectations, I found this place lacking. Despite not being at capacity - service is beyond slow here.  We started dinner at 8:15 and did not finish until close to 10:30. I'm not sure how serving a dish of raw beef tongue to be cooked at the table could possible take 2 hours to come out (Note we asked them to rush the dishes a little b/c we knew everything would be turtle speed if not). Anyway, I'm not an overly adventurous eater and I found that there were few items on the menu that I was able to eat. Most of the people in our party of 8 do love this place and prefer it over Guu. However, I think Guu and even Hapa (Vancouver as I have not been to the Toronto location) have a better menu for my tastes. We were here for a birthday dinner so ordered a lot of items on the menu but by 10:30 we needed to be elsewhere and ended up cancelling 3 dishes as they had not come out. The one thing I liked about this restaurant is the atmosphere - it is quiet compared to the likes of Guu and means you can actually have a conversation with the person next to you.  I really enjoyed the Pork Belly dish."}
{"text":"Recently, there is a hype around Kingyo Izakaya, the Vancouver-based Izakaya that has recently opened a store Toronto. We have heard a lot of good reviews about it and saw plenty pictures on facebook, even from our friend who tried in it Vancouver! JW and I couldn't bring ourselves to miss out on this!  Arriving around 7pm, Kingyo was not as crowded as Guu; the tables were placed fairly far from each other and there were not a lot of people.  Yet, for the same reasons, the atmosphere certainly didn't feel as lively. We were being seated at a huge table with live Kingyo (aka Goldfish) swimming in a fish tank that is embedded into the table. Very interesting!  I want to start off by saying that the food at Kingyo comes really really fast. Shortly after we ordered, we had 4 dishes on our table ranging from Seafood don and shooters and sashimi. I recommend one to ask the servers to slow down like we did or else you will be way too overwhelmed and won't be able to truly savour the food.  We started off with Mr. Sada's Sea Urchin Shooters. I was very very very excited about the sea urchin shooters because of the extremely pleasant experience I had at Chicago's Arami. Yet, I was quite disappointed with Kingyo's sea urchin shooter.  My excitement sank when I saw the raw egg floating on top. But that wasn't not their fault, it was just me so I just spooned out the egg. Following our server's instructions and mixing everything very well, I took a sip of the shooter. The stickiness and taste of the yam was just not my thing. The next thing I realized, there was rice in the shooter and it was kind of weird! I know you are supposed eat the rice with the sea urchin and the combination is perfect when you are eating a sea urchin sushi. But with the yam in the shooter that created the slimy texture, it was just not right. Even though with the freshness of the sea urchin in the shooter, the whole thing was rather tasteless.  Next, we had the Hamachi Carpaccio. This dish came with Hamachi along with salad vegetable and garlic oil drizzled on top. It was very delicious, but rather nothing surprising. At this point, we all know that garlic oil goes very well all kind of fish and we have tried this in many japanese restaurants. One thing I want to point out is that the fish at Kingyo was not very fresh. JW tried to taste pieces of fish on its own and said it wasn't fresh; it was the flavour added to it that covered up the lack of freshness in the fish.  Then, we had the Stone Bowl Seafood Sea Urchin Don. This was also one of the dishes we looked forward to the most. Like sea urchin in a bowl of rice, can our lives get better? But, we were disappointed again. Although there was a generous amount of sea urchin sitting on top, the seafood don lacked a directing flavour; the seafood don had a very light soya sauce taste with a hint of vinegar. However, it was not strong enough to tie all the ingredients together. They were more like individual pieces that were put together by accident and did not really go together.  We also ordered the Aburi Toro & Avocado 2Tone Battera, which we expected to highly resemble Jabistro's ebi and salmon oshizushi. Yet, we were wrong again. The Toro wasn't fresh. The balance of rice and fish was off and there was too much rice. Although there was a sauce that tasted like vinegar and a hint of garlic oil, the sushi was extremely tasteless. Very disappointed.  Lastly, we had two sushi rolls from today's special menu. I forgot their names but I think they were spicy scallop roll and beef tataki roll. These rolls did its job by wrapping our meal with disappointment.  Expected the spicy scallop roll to taste like Blue Ocean Roll from ND sushi, the spiciness from mixing mayo with sriracha sauce was blunt and tasted exactly like spicy sashimi rolls found in all japanese bentos. Totally not worth the $10 or even more.    The sauce on the beef tataki roll was quite surprising and went pretty well with the fried noodles-like thing on top. But the beef was tough and hard-bitten.  verdict:  not roasted  We entered the restaurant with excitement and left with disappointed. Everything was very disappointing. We will not come back for sure.  visit http://theroastedacorn.com/2013/03/18/kingyo-izakaya/ for awesome pictures of the food i mentioned :)"}
{"text":"I was originally going to give one star but I gave two because the food wasn't bad at all.  However, it's one of those terrible dining experiences when I thought usually Japanese restaurants are detail oriented.  We ordered the price fix menu for $35 per person for 4 people. The logic from how they serve the food is just ridiculous to me.  First of all, they served a few plates of hot dishes first then served us with sashimi. I asked the server shouldn't sashimi come first? She responded me that I need to request that if I want sashimi to come first. I thought it's common sense that cold dishes always served before hot dishes in a Japanese restaurant   Second, the number of food item per plate is weird too. The price fix is specifically for 4 ppl. We had a plate of sashimi with 3 pieces of each kind of fish and there were 5 different kind, so even you multiply it still an odd(15)number for 4 ppl? And for other dishes like ebimayo, wagyu, capacio, it's all served with odd numbers like 7.  Are we suppose to fight over food when we already pay a price fix per person?   The experience absolutely did not make sense and the responses of servers were unprofessional as well. If you are looking for good detail-oriented considerate Japanese service, DONT COME HERE."}
{"text":"After hearing and seeing a ton of photos of kingyo I finally decided to try it out. It is a small, cute little place in cabbage town. The place has a nice vibe, a bit on the noisy side but not extremely loud like guu. The decor with the flashing lights was a little disturbing and very uncomfortable for the eyes.   It is a reality expensive place for the food that they serve. The food is not terrible but I don't think some of the items were worth the price.   As well, when I went they revised their menu and removed a few things like the bone marrow and sea urchin shooter from the menu which was what I was looking forward to, so that was rather disappointing.   The food:  The ramen was bland, oily and not very appetizing at all.   The fried chicken was nice and crispy, tasted a lot better then I expected. It comes with salt and pepper but it's not necessary. It's good on its own as well.  The tuna, prawn and avocado tartar was very disappointing. You can barely taste the seafood and the avocado lacked flavour. The whole dish was rather bland and disappointing.   The duck cooked on the hot stone was one of their specials. It was a cool and neat thing to order, def something different.   The tuna salad was very tasty and flavourful. I would say the best dish I had there. I def recommend this!   Overall, I think this place is a bit pricey for the food that you get and a bit disappointing. Don't go in with high expectations!"}
{"text":"This is good place to sample different small plates of Japanese flavors.  I would recommend the Stone Bowl Mushroom Tofu, Chicken Kara-age and Cream Buta Kakuni (Pork Belly).  The Tonkutsu Ramen is not on the regular menu (it was that night's special), but hopefully it will make its way on to their regular menu."}
{"text":"I am raising my rating of Kingyo because I was impressed how quickly the owner contacted me after review of our unfortunate experience was pulbished. I received an aplogy and promise that custome service in the restaurant will be approved. Owner offered me a full refund for our bill and we agreed that he will donate the amount to the  Sick Kids Foundation."}
{"text":"Yay for the Izakaya trend coming to Toronto. I am no longer held ransom to long waits at Guu. The food is interesting and tasty here, I love that they take reservations and the space is more spacious that Guu yet still have an Izakaya feel.   Most of the dishes I tried were great but a few were average, there were no bad dishes. The excellent dishes that we tried were :  Sea Urchin Shooter, it was fresh and had yam and rice underneath with a quail egg, very yummy.  Stewed pork hot stone rice bowl (forgot the exact name), I loved this dish, the pork was flavorful, moist and soft and the rice was not too mushy, the dish was just saucy enough, simply delicious, I can eat 3 of these.  Beef Tongue Ramen: Pretty good, the beef tongue was tender, but the broth was not flavorful enough for me, the noodles were great and al dente, but the broth underwhelms, the bowl is also significantly smaller than other ramen places, so know that a bowl of ramen would not full you.  Tantan Pork Ramen - spicy miso pork ramen, this was pretty average, the broth again was not flavorful enough and it came out lukewarm, I like my ramen hot in temperature. The noodles again were nice but the broth underwhelms, again the bowl was pretty small for a ramen so it is not fulling.  Overall, I really like this place, there are lots of dishes I want to return to try since they look pretty interesting. I like that they take reservations and that the seating is not as cramped as Guu. The noise level is also quieter than Guu. Service was good, quick and attentive."}
{"text":"I came with a group of 5 people and so we got to sample many items on their menu. They were all delicious and I definitely will go back!"}
{"text":"This is a GREAT place to eat if you are heading to a show at the Phoenix later, since that area is basically a disaster for any sort of decent pre show dinner.  The ramen here is amazing - we only had the ramen salad, but the texture of the noodles were phenomenal and is probably some of the best (in terms of noodle quality) I've had in Toronto, ahead of Kinton, Momo, and Santouka (just the ramen, not the broth).  Overall quality is great, and they take reservations"}
{"text":"I love Kingyo's pork loin cutlet. The meat is quite juicy and tender, and the slice is fairly thick.  I have tried Mr. Tonkatsu's pork cutlet. It was very dry although the cut is thinner than Kingyo's. Kingyo's price is slightly higher than Mr. Tonkatsu's, but I think it is worth it. The space in Kingyo is big, you don't have to sit very close with strangers. I will definitely go back and try other dishes on the menu."}
{"text":"My husband and I are regulars here and we love it. Always amazing food. They often have specials on pitchers of beer and the atmosphere feels authentic. We always receive a warm welcome and enjoy prompt, attentive service. Highly recommended to anyone who enjoys Japanese cuisine. The best of the Izakayas in Toronto, in my opinion."}
{"text":"This is out of expectation the menu includes a seafood tartar, a stone grilled duck,  a pork belly rice and a red bean paste strawberry sauce green tea ice cream.   All of which are very delicious"}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday night. Restaurant was busy, not full though, but the service was extremely slow. We ordered 5 dishes ( portions are small and tapas style) and it took over an hour for all the food to arrive. We were still hungry afterwards but didn't want to wait any longer for more food.   Highlights ( or lowlights in this case):  Aburi Saba and Toro sushi:both were a disappointment. The Saba and Toro lacked the flame seared taste that warrants it to be called Aburi style sushi. The Saba tasted almost completed cooked, and the Toro was minced so finely that it had a really mushy texture. Also, there there was so much sauce that it really overpowered the flavour of the fish.   Special dinner menu item: i wish i took down the name of the dish that we ordered from their seasonal special menu, as I can't recall what it was called, but need to warn others of this awful dish. It was mainly chopped salmon with scallion and a quail egg yolk that you wrap in seaweed. Their was too much egg yolk in the dish that it tasted really slimy and also bland. We couldn't even finish it although we were starving.   The remaining dishes were average and not worth mentioning. The server did give us complimentary ice cream after to apologize for the slow service but it was not enough to compensate for the poor quality of the food.   We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Our Japanese guests said their unagi dishes were better than what they've had in Japan. Needless to say, our dishes were also excellent.  Need I say more?"}
{"text":"If you're looking for an authentic Japanese restaurant, you've found it.  The decor is Amazing. The walls have pachinko machines, Japanese style looks, they had an old school Japanese movie playing from a projector by the bar area which was lined with Japanese alcohol. The bathrooms look like they're from a 5-star hotel. Complete privacy AND they had mouthwash and wet towelettes! I just thought that was different, and something small I really appreciated.  Food: My friend and I ordered the tofu+mushroom bowl which was okay, the sauce was amazing. I got food poisoning from a different restaurant with this style tofu so I'm still a bit traumatised.   The calamari was ONE OF THE BEST I've tried. I'm Italian, seafood is important to me. They served meaty chunks of calamari lightly breaded with a tartar sauce and a Japanese style bruschetta which was SO. DAMN. GOOD. Only $6.99 (it was on special the time I went), if you like calamari this is A MUST!  Then we ordered the spicy tuna and salmon sushi. Came beautifully layed out in a traditional wood style plate. I liked the salmon a bit more, but both were really good. The salmon was a little thinner than what I'm used to but it did have some salmon pieces embedded in the rice as well.  Overall we paid $40 total. Great prices for quality foods!  We sat near the bar and the bartender was great. Very social and spoke to us about traditional Japanese food. When you first walk in, expect to be greeted by ALL STAFF. When you leave, expect the same thing.  Overall it was a great experience and I'll definitely return."}
{"text":"Upon my second visit to Kingyo, I took a friend, who had previously said that she wasn't impressed by any Japanese cuisine in Toronto.  After a dinner at Kingyo, she said her \"confidence in Japanese cuisine in Toronto has now been restored.\"  Our dinner consisted of the following: Watermelon Kimchi, Red Tuna/Black Tiger Prawn Avocado Tartar, Assorted Sashimi, Kingyo Style Death Chicken, Spicy Chopped Tuna Battera, Pork Tantan Ramen, Frozen Matcha Creme Brulee.  About half of these dishes I've already commented on in my previous review, so I'll just comment on the ones I had for the first time.  The Kingyo Style Death Chicken, is basically their Chicken Kaarage with a spicy sauce, essentially an improvement over the latter, making it excellent.  The warning on the menu is an exaggeration, so go ahead and order it.  The Pork Tantan Ramen is one of the best ramen I've tasted in the city.  The broth is extremely rich, flavourful and incredibly delicious.  The Frozen Matcha Creme Brulee is fantastic.  A strong matcha green tea flavour, that has the consistency of firm ice cream and is a perfect complement to all the strong flavours of the prior dinner dishes.  As always, try to sit at the bar, because it's far more interesting than the standard tables, and it's the best area of the restaurant for sound if you want to avoid yelling at your dinner guest's face.  Again overall, Kingyo serves some of the best food I've had in city, and has yet to fail to impress."}
{"text":"Oh yay! Was seated at the sushi bar and was mesmerized by the action while we ate our dinner.   Our dining trio had a variety of items to share, including the crunchy lotus root, toro & avocado 2Tone batter, karrage chicken, the vegan box (like a little jewelry box!) and ebi tempura rice ball. The pudding and the sponge cake for dessert. The food was lovely, and would like to try many more things next time I go.   The best part was being seated by the sushi counter and watching the sushi and sashimi platters being created. It was like having your own personal cooking show right in front of you. Although, next time, I think I would like to sit in the restaurant part to get a vibe for that. The service was cute and charming, if a little slow, but the servers seemed genuinely interested in matching us with the perfect food selection.   Would return. Next time will try the drinks and sit in the restaurant part. Also interested in a noodle bowl of some type."}
{"text":"This place WAS one of my favourites. Went as part of a group of four on January 2, 2018. It's not my favourite anymore!!  Things to know.....  1.  There is no longer a lunch menu.  We ordered the tonkatsu and while it was still good, the price has increased to $20+ for a combo, that's almost an increase of $5. 2.  We ordered an appetizer that never did arrive. 3.  Although it was lunchtime, we were told the ramen was sold out for the day (@12 noon) 4. Very slow service....they brought the dessert menu and 25 minutes later they came and took the order.   We actually enquired  as to if the restaurant had changed ownership..  To recap....increaased prices and decreased service.    We won't be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place with 3 friends last week and glad that we did.  We ordered: -Tako Wasabi(3/5) -Ume Seaweed Hotate Carpaccio(4/5) -Tan Tan Men(5/5) -Somekind of duck salad(3/5) -Grilled Black Cod(3/5) -Stone grilled Tajima Beef(5/5) -Karaage(2/5) -Sea Urchin Don(5/5) -Aburi Toro Battera(4/5)  Out of all of the above, the Tan Tan Men is most memorable. We think the noodle is not one that can be bought anywhere in Toronto and deduced that it must be handmade. The broth also had a pretty good umami flavor to it, but not too strong to the point it would make you have chinese food syndrome.  The stone grilled tajima beef is a must to order if you come here. It's very soft and taste like it melts inside your mouth with barely any seasoning. (they provide some sauces though)  The Sea Urchin Don is a must try too. The uni provided the buttery taste to the rice and make it to taste like paella with no tomato puree. The buttery taste from the uni and the ginger sauce to get rid of the smell just brings out the flavor of the other seafood on the bowl.  Overall, we're really satisfied with the food. We're planning to go to other place for our desert, but the waitress brought us some frozen grape for us. The service was decent considering how crowded it was. Though, I'm still a bit pissed that my glass had some red hair or something inside it and the waitress didn't even say sorry and just left to get me a new glass (one that I hope she didn't spit on)."}
{"text":"After my several visits at Kingyo, I am still impressed their excellent food. But, I actually have mixed feeling on their service, it basically fantastic and informative but I feel like it really depends on the server.  There were few times that really disappointed us but, I will give one last shot when I have a chance to visit.   Anyways, I highly recommend to have tuna and avocado tartar, Karaage with magic powder, and toro and avocado Battera sushi. The sushi was melting in my mouth...Ummm  You may find a bit pricey for dining but, its all worth it because all the dishes has a good portions, compared with other Japanese Izakaya.  Again, you must visit here if you wish to try Authentic Japanese Izakaya food!"}
{"text":"We had a reservation for a late dinner on Friday and we got seated very quickly after being greeted by a group of friendly and polite waitstaff. The restaurant has an interesting decor. The sashimi was very fresh. I especially enjoyed the sweet shrimps and scallops. Unfortunately, they ran out of sea ursin that day. The big Kingyo short rib came in a huge portion, but it was a bit too sweet for me. The menus look a bit worn down and should be replaced. Definitely looking forward to trying their lunch menu next time."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is nice, unique, and fun. Big greeting upon arrival (similar to Guu) Much quieter in comparison so I can hear myself think! lol Here for dinner. Service is awesome. Switch plates during meal along with new napkins. Food is excellent. I recommend the wings for a try. Overall, very happy and would encourage a visit to this joint :)"}
{"text":"Delicious food and drinks and the service is amazing. It's a quieter izakaya place, unlike guu. More of a date night atmosphere. A favourite for me!"}
{"text":"Always a great meal at Kingyo.  Authentic atmosphere, and a menu authentic but with a slight unique twist.  Will certainly go back many times again!"}
{"text":"Great decor, but I was disappointed with the food. I think good Japanese food should highlight great sashimi. Was not impressed with the staples. But there was a lot of distractions."}
{"text":"The best dish that we ordered is the yellowfish cheek.  It was grilled so right that the meat is smooth, silky-like and has a mild taste.   The server is attentive that changed our plate after the fish dish."}
{"text":"Excellent spot for a late dinner! Sushis were good, service was fast and sake was absolutely tasty! We had a great time even if they're displaying some weird Japanese movies behind the bar - which is actually cool because it made us laugh a lot! I highly recommend this izakaya for a couple or for a group, both options work well. Try the unfiltered sake it was absolutely delightful! Sushis were good too and they put them in flames!!!"}
{"text":"I don't usually write reviews unless a restaurant really impressed me or really dissapointed me.  Good: the food was actually good. The decoration was okay and somewhat authentic to the Japanese culture.  Bad: the service. For the entire time I was there, I got one smile from the servers. One who didn't even serve us. I had to ask the waitress for some water even 15 minutes after I had finished my glass. The servers just made this whole experience, which I paid approx 20$ each person, not worth my while. It was the first time and last time going there."}
{"text":"Tasty food and great presentation on beautiful dishes. Quite loud for our liking and on the pricey end...however we will return. We didn't make any reservation,but were seated in a few minutes ( close to 9 pm). Place is packed."}
{"text":"Japanese izakayas in odd neighbourhoods...the new Toronto trend.  I do think though that Kingyo is the best of the explosion of Vancouver izakayas that has hit Toronto in the last year or so.  The food is so fresh and tasty, and the portions, while not large by any stretch of the imagination, are larger than their competitors.  I usually don't order noodles at izakayas because they make me too full to eat all the other goodness that's being served, but at Kingyo I have to make an exception because my two fav dishes so far are the ramen(s) and the udon with sea urchin in it. And I don't even like sea urchin!!  Another nice thing about Kingyo is that there is free street parking outside and the ambiance inside isn't too loud. It's a good place to go with groups of any size or even just two or three people."}
{"text":"It was a very special experience. And will return. The staff were friendly and very experienced. Ambiance was lovely the quality of the fish and meat, superb. Waiter even asked our opinion on one of the featured dishes."}
{"text":"Came here after church service on a Sunday. We had a large group, but thankfully, one of our group members called in with a reservation beforehand, which turned out to be a great move as we had 19 people! Credits to them for accommodating us, even with ever-shifting numbers. Our server was great, trying and generally succeeding in giving us all individual bills.  I ordered the burdock kakiage and shabu shabu udon. My order was one of the last ones to arrive, but boy did it ever arrive with quite the presence - easily the largest bowl by far on our entire table. While I wasn't the biggest fan of the burdock tempura - definitely more personal preference than anything - the rib eye had just the right amount of fat on it and cooked perfectly with the hot water that our server poured in. The bonito soup base added great depth to the flavour.  As with all previous times I've been to Kingyo, I enjoyed the ambience, although the large table didn't lend itself to conversations across the table. The pond in the middle needed more water. And too bad the pachinko machines downstairs were inoperable..."}
{"text":"Okay experience, love that they take reservations.   Here are some things we ordered that I can remember:  Mushroom stone bowl - delicious and mushroomy! One of our favorite dishes  Stone grilled beef -  very neat, cook your own beef on a hot rock. Meat was tender and delicately seasoned  Oyster & uni shooter - I didn't have a good experience, the uni was pungent and did not taste fresh  Best chicken wings? I think not. Pretty plain and disappointing, even worse the chicken wings were under cooked and really bloody.  Black cod - delish  I do love the frozen grapes they give at the end of the meal. But grapes are cheap... Why not more than one! I hassled my server for extra lol.    Overall the food was good but I'm not dying to go back. The bill adds up quite a lot quickly. I'd rather go to Guu. Food wise I would give Kingyo 3.5 but there is no such thing, and I'll also give them points as I received very good service on my visit."}
{"text":"Took the girlfriend here for dinner on a Saturday evening. The environment was lively but wasn't busy. Great energy and the staff are very polite.   We ordered the following plates:  Salmon Sashimi A Big Kingyo Shortrib Pork TanTan Ramen Hamachi Carpaccio Aburi Toro & Avacado 2 Colors Battera   Of all the dishes above, the top choice would go to the Big Kingyo Shortrib. The Shortrib costs $21 but it's worth every dollar. Strong, bold flavours and the meat is so tender. Just thinking about it makes me hungry again.   Overall, if you're looking for authentic Japanese cuisine in small plates and portions, this is your place. Food was amazing"}
{"text":"Lots of variety and the food is excellent! Make sure you try to jumbo shrimp sashimi, it is so good and the size is big! Definitely will come back!"}
{"text":"Used to be my go to place for lunch all the way from north. Haven't been here for couple months, so come for lunch today.  Very disappointed,  lunch special menu gone, price jerk up to the roof, portion went down to the drain, food quality went south.  Too bad, another authentic Japanese place can't maintain their discipline due to high labor and food costs.  So sad!!"}
{"text":"Loud. Decent dishes, decent drinks, decent desserts. They do special combos and deals quite frequently. Ideal for bigger groups.   The decor was one of the things that was memorable about this place. Very retro yet traditional. Nudity all over the men's  washroom if you're into that."}
{"text":"They have 2 pachinko machines in the basement which you can play for free to get 10$ your next visit.  This place was pricey and not spectacular, however that matcha creme brulee was really really good."}
{"text":"Very good place to have Japanese food. They serve modern Japanese  food, or Japanese fusion food.   Must haves: Beef tongue (stone grilled) Pork belly fried rice (seasonal item) Mushroom age tofu  Check out their season menu! From time to time there are goodies as well."}
{"text":"Great food but TOO MUCH YELLING. Very noisy! Warning to migraine sufferers or anyone prone to seizures: the flashing of the wall mounted pachinko machines may be triggers for you. Delightful service."}
{"text":"The hot stone beef is a must. Honey lemon ginger ale drink is made in house and tastes amazing. The wasabi octopus appetizer is also good, but it's not for the weak. The ambiance is nice and far from noisy."}
{"text":"The food was superb and especially for the price, it's hard to beat this super authentic Japanese fare. Great flavor, fresh and just really enjoyable overall. Definitely recommend the tasting menu with sake. Every course was delicious."}
{"text":"Kingyo Izakaya is my favourite izakaya in toronto. I love the ambiance of this place, so much quieter than Guu (Kinka). The food here is also amazing. I really like the waygu beef bbq on a hot stone. The beef literally melt in your mouth. I've had almost everything on the menu and I like all of them except the torched sushi. Don't get me wrong, the sushi taste alright, but they fall apart very easily.   I also want to point out that the category should be changed for Kingyo on Yelp because currently it's only marked as Ramen. I mean they do offer Ramen but I wouldn't categorize them as a Ramen restaurant."}
{"text":"Long-ish wait. Was told over the phone that they don't take reservations yet when we arrived at the place the seater asked if we had reservations. Was told It was a 30 min wait from there but we were seated a lot sooner.   Staff is very friendly and food was outstanding. We got the salmon carpaccio and loved it so much we got another. Small portions - tapa style but really good quality healthy options.   Would definitely return but probably sporadically as its a bit on the pricier side."}
{"text":"This was a spur of the moment visit. My friends were already feeling happy after a tour of the Ontario Sake Company and wanted to continue the party and what better way to do that than visit a Japanese pub. So after meddling with two choices of Izakayas we settled on this spot. The place was packed (it was Saturday night so expected). We were put on a communal table with a limited time frame as there was big group coming over with reservations.  I have been to their Vancouver location and other tried a couple of dishes there so was expecting a similar setup. However this place is more like Guu and is quite loud.  Never mind as I do enjoy a good energy level.  We started out with Nama Nama (un-pasteurized version) and then ordered a combo of items to share. Meanwhile as we waited we munched on some edamame and discussed the benefits of Sake (from what my friends were told :)  On to main Tako Wasabi. Very good.  Ebi Mayo: Good. Nicely fried with thin batter. The mayo was seasoned well. A benchmark dish for Izakayas done well.  Red Tuna & Black Tiger Prawn Avocado Tartar: Poor. The taste of tuna was completely lost here. No seasoning at all and shrimp were wasted as well the avocado overpowered everything else here. The toasts that are provided were not enough and we had to wait quite a bit for an extra helping to mop it up.  Spicy Chopped Tuna Battera and Salmon Oyako Battera: Average iteration of sushi here. Presentation is nice but a very mundane take on sushi. I might drop by again to try other dishes as I think our experience would have been better if we had ordered some other dishes. For now 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"I kept passing by the one in Vancouver and never got to try it, so finally I decided I would when I came here and lo and behold, it wasn't exactly the greatest izakaya experience I've ever had.  I started off with the unagi don and truthfully, I've had better at ayce places (ni ji, even Sakura). There wasn't much unagi to begin with, therefore definitely not worth the $15.80 tab. Next was the beef tenderloin. It was not a bad presentation - a hot stone abed a wooden board, where you place each raw strip on the hot stone to grill. This was also $15.80 but not really worth the price either bc the strips were few and tiny. Last was the ebi mayo which I thought and was hoping would be stellar, but after one bite and look, I could tell it wasn't worth the $9 cost either. Miku and Nomé have wayyyy better ebi mayo's and they dress them up/present them very well (sauce-wise) Miku also accompanies their ebi's with salad which is actually delicious! I found Kingyo's ebi mayo to have TOO MUCH mayo that even my guest said the same thing and the spring mix salad they were sitting on were also drenched in mayo (pero why?) -__-\" (also, check my pic! You will see what I mean)   I was really hoping it would've turned out better, however the decor was interesting lol - I will say that. I don't think I would ever come back here at will, nor recommend this place because there are far better."}
{"text":"It is very good, i was so surprised! I was wondering what should i ate that night,  then i found it.  So nice!"}
{"text":"Very loud greetings as most Japanese restaurants do  :) Service was friendly and efficient We tried some special items of the day:  Fried soft shell crab salad, okay one, seasoning of the salad was better than the soft shell crab Hot stone bowl unagi don. Liked it! Perfectly seasoned , hot and delicious. Kingyo style calamari, good   Karagaee with magic powder wasn't that magical.  Enjoyed the beef tongue on a sizzling stone. Thinly cut and very fresh . The wow was frozen matcha crème brulee. So delicious! Liked it!  Was about $50 per person"}
{"text":"Solid lunch specials.    I've been here for dinner a little while back. I think in terms of value, you want to come here for lunch.  Dinner was a bit expensive for the portions.  However, regardless of time of day, the service is consistently attentive but not overbearingly so.    If I were to dissect each dish of my makunouchi lunch set, it would take way too long.  Overall, for quality, taste, presentation, and value, I would say a solid 4 stars.  I'm definitely coming back for the sashimi lunch combo!"}
{"text":"The girlfriend was invited out by one of her infinitely stylish and in the know foodie colleagues and I got to tag along.   Just off the main drag in Cabbagetown we were ushered in through an unassuming entrance by a very loud Japanese host yelling welcome! Ah yes an Isakiya joint.   Due to watching lots of \"Mind of a Chef\" on Netflix I'm kind of on Japanese food kick and was excited to sample lots from the menu.   To that end I got the Chefs selection appetizer box and the beef tongue cooked on a hot stone. My lady had the tempura and the house special karage chicken.   After what seemed like forever the food started to appear. While my tongue made an appearance the server appeared to tell me that they were out of the appetizer platter. O well I would drown my sorrows in some plum lime. I also ordered the battered shrimp with mayo.   The beef tongue was good and came with some interesting chimmicuri type sauce. The shrimip with mayo was good but I found it very very salty.   I also tried my girlfriend's chicken and tempura. The chicken even came with extra salt for dipping, not that it needed it.   Looking at everyone's else's plates we noticed that everyone has ordered ramen or a rice dish. They all looked good and were maybe not as saline as what we ordered.   When it finally came to settle the server made a big song and dance about not being able to split bills.   Overall my food was okay, the service was lacklustre and the decor was neat (see my picture of the video games outside the bathroom)  I'm not sure if my soso experience is because of my inexperience in picking dishes or the kitchen having an off night. Even though I didn't have a great experience I'm willing to give these guys a second chance."}
{"text":"Well, went there with high expectation, but not as good. Ramen is too salty, and we also ordered the beef tongue, which is more for fun. Very interesting decoration, but I won't recommend ordering Ramen there, maybe could try sushi or BBQ meat dish."}
{"text":"Everything here is great! The food is delicious and presented exquisitely. The service is attentive. The portions are small but hey, that means you don't overeat."}
{"text":"Would I come back? Yes. I liked everything I ate to varying degrees.   It's a lot like Guu/Kinka, but without the yelling. The decor is cool with the brightly-lit games on the walls, otherwise dimly-lit space, and dark wood furniture.   We ordered the following (don't know if these are the exact names): -- Sashimi shooter -- Duck tataki  -- Karaage (fried chicken) -- Omurice (omelette) -- Pork Ramen -- Cheesecake and mango sorbet  My favourite is a toss up between the ramen or the omurice, with a close runner-up of the sashimi shooter.   The shooter had an interesting gooey texture that I think might put some people off, and to be honest while I enjoyed it, it wasn't exceptional. It's not something I'd say is a must-try. but the presentation was really special.   The ramen and omurice were both good. The karaage was made perfectly, although I prefer Guu/Kinka's; I feel like Kingyo's isn't as crunchy-fried and has an interesting herby/spice flavour that deviates too much from the pure fried chicken taste I like.   I would pass on the cheesecake and sorbet. The portion was puny and while it was good, it wasn't a satisfying portion-to-price ratio.   I prefer the laid-back atmosphere to the boisterous Guu/Kinka and I feel like there are so many things on the menu to choose from that you're bound to find something. Based on how everything we ordered was good without a bum note, I wouldn't think twice about coming back."}
{"text":"Had: - uni shooters (not my favorite, and a little pricey) - sashimi (amaebi and hamachi - my friend raved about the amaebi) - toro battera sushi (OK, avocado overwhelmed the toro a bit, and sushi to fish ratio was a bit off, but was still very good and fresh). - kimchi udon (must-try, udon was perfectly cooked and very creamy dish) - uni don (unanimous favorite dish of the night, must try - textures and flavour were heavenly, not too sweet). - chicken wings (perfectly crispy (not battered), just a hint of spice, would order again) - almond tofu (silken heaven, with the perfect amount of cream, much better than Guu) - brown tea (they offer it in a french press, and they keep refilling the hot water!)  Pros: - the decor (yeah, ambiance :D!) plus there's this wonderful little fishbowl at your table with your own little goldfish; presentation was also fantastic - fish is super fresh here, and sourced from the west coast - wait staff is super friendy and attentive (but not pushy)  Cons: - expect a short wait, or book ahead, it was busy by 6:45pm on a weeknight  Overall Impression: I love the Vancouver location, and Toronto doesn't disappoint. It's a more traditional izakaya than Guu or DonDon, I'd put it closer to Ematei. The fish dishes are much fresher than at Guu, although Guu does fusiony dishes better (e.g. cheese bibimbap). There are lots of dishes here that I would recommend over any at Guu (unidon, the stone-grill beef or beef tongue, almond tofu).  This is not your average sushi restaurant, it's an izakaya, and it is pricier (although if you don't eat a lot of sashimi/hot stone dishes, it won't come out to a lot - about $30ish pp for us tonight).  Extra tip - if you don't mind, sit at the bar - we did that, and it was great, one of the sushi chefs chatted us up, and it's fun to watch them make battera sushi as well."}
{"text":"If you're wondering what service is like in restaurants in Japan, this is pretty much close to it. Amazing food, highly recommend the beef sashimi salad, toro sushi roll, and of course the tako wassabi."}
{"text":"Somebody needs to check on the size of their Asahi \"Pints\" which are $7 and are nowhere near 500mL or...a pint--more like 300mL.  When I asked them out of curiosity--they said \"that's what an \"Asahi\" pint\" is.  Hmmm...not sure that's a legit answer...  The food was ok, but not great for the price.  We ordered snowcrab with yuzu sauce, the spicy ramen and a stone rice bowl--all pricey (for what they were) and not particularly filling, special or memorable.    Our vegan friend appreciated the separate menu--but no joke--we had to go out for patties and poutine right after~!  We tried reserving ahead of time for 7 people, but got the run-around when they said they couldn't accommodate it, until they figured that they could just push two tables together (!)   Toronto authentic Japanese places have got it down--not this one so much.  So many other great places.  Will prob not be back."}
{"text":"I went to Kingyo last night on a whim after having seen it on NOW Toronto's 25 Hottest Restaurants article. 4 hungry people, 10 great dishes, several delicious cocktails...we were very happy customer's by the end of the night.  Having been to Guu, I knew this was going to be a somewhat similar izakaya experience, but I found several notable differences.   1)The service was much better than at Guu. Our waitress was very helpful and knowledgeable about the food, and the dishes came quickly but they were perfectly spread out over the course of our meal.  2) The atmosphere isn't as in-your-face as guu. Still loud but not as much yelling.  3) The food - I found there to be a bigger selection of dishes at Kingyo.  More about the food...  We ordered: * Tsukemono Pickels Assortment * Stone Bowl Mushroom Tofu * Red tuna & Black tiger prawn avocado tartar * Beef tataki Salad with Ume dressing * Assortment of Sashimi * Fried Chicken with \"Magic Powder\" * A Big Kingyo Short Rib * Udon Noodle Special * Spicy Chopped Tuna Mango Roll  Some highlights included the Short Rib - my mouth is still salivating just thinking about it and it's deliciously sweet and salty sauce. The assortment of pickled vegetables were surprisingly all delicious and I found this to be a perfect palate cleanser to start the meal. The fried chicken was perfectly crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside and while the \"magic powder\" just seemed to be some sort of salt, it didn't matter because the chicken was to die for. The beef tataki salad which was recommended to us by our waitress was one of the best salads I've had in a long time and unlike any salad I've ever ordered. I'd order everything again except for the Mushroon Tofu bowl which had great flavours but texturally it was a little slimy.  All-in-all this is a Cabbagetown geme of a restaurant. I'd recommend it to everyone and I'd go back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"After checking this place out, I've decided that I must go back.  We came here for dinner because one of our vegan friends was joining us, and they had some vegan options. Everything was delicious. Everything. I'd like to go back and take advantage of their happy hour drink and food deals (after 9pm on weekdays) and try their beef tongue, which comes raw and is cooked on a hot stone. I thought this might be a bit insensitive to try with a vegan at the table.  Service was impeccable and the place itself is beautiful. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Always welcoming staff and exceptional service when I come here for dinner or lunch. The king of lunch bento is my go to during lunch. They only serve 10 of these a day so it's a good idea to go early!   The bento is a great way to try a variety of their dishes in snack size. It is super filling and at a great price ($19).   You can really tell the quality and effort the cook places on each bento. What you get in the bento changes from time to time as well!"}
{"text":"Better to make a reservation. Classy little restaurant located in a quiet neighborhood. Pricy but worth it."}
{"text":"We always liked kingyo although there service sometimes really test your patience. Then what happens on us on Nov 7th at night, really turned out back on kingyo. It started with we didn't make an reservation that night and decided to wait in line. We waited there over an hour.   During our waiting time, these are what happened:  1. The host with no simle? acts like the queen of the restaurant doesn't give us any number, but just put our name down to her secret paper.  2. During the while time we are waiting? there are 2 tables for 6 people, one table for 4 people, one table for 3 people and the lower bar area empty  3. While there is long lineup at the front of the restaurant, the host kept received calls during our waiting time and put reserved sign in the empty tables. This really confuses me. I understand u keep the empty table and no time to put reserved sign. But after we waited their for 40 mins, we saw one of the girl reserved a call, and put a reserved sign on an empty table right after.  4. Then, The host take people waiting inline randomly. I really don't want to go to the bias topic. Honestly, you guys can't be less obvious. When we start questioning the host for taking people in we arrived after us. All of suddenly, they start taking us seriously and arrange an empty area at bar for us asap.  5. While the host brought us the menu, she saw we are trying to leave a complaint on Yelp. Suddenly there is simple, there is apology, there is free dish for making us waiting so long. We decided not to take any of their free dish, instead we offer them our free comments.   Either kingyo doesn't know how to run their business, or someone peed in the host's cereal in the morning. I always wonder how a host could be such snobby and mannerless at any restaurant. If leaving bad comments can bring their smile and manner back. We don't mind to do so.   Honestly, instead of ordering tasty take out from restaurant and awesome home kitchens, people came to restaurant for your atmosphere and services. Therefore, kingyo is such a failure and removed from our top restaurant list ASAP after that night.   If you don't wanna this kinda services ruin your food and night, kingyo is your NO GO ZONE!"}
{"text":"This place was alright until I've realized that the cold sake we were served was from Fukushima (where the huge radiation accident took place few years ago). The sake was apparently one of the most popular ones at the time of visit couple months ago. Too bad that I realized it half way through the bottle, since it was written on the label (in rather tiny letters) with no mention of it on the menu."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service! Very high quality fish and probably one of the top places for izakaya and very fresh sushi and sashimi."}
{"text":"Great izakaya!  Good service, nice place,  perfect for date nights!  Highly recommend the torched sushi!"}
{"text":"Quite similar to guu, service wasn't great, some of the asian servers were NOT attentive nor friendly at all. Reservations booked but yet i was still kept waiting.   Dishes were great, they looked cool, some had cool concepts like grilling the raw beef slices on the hot stone but not that efficient.  the wings were a big rave apparently but i wasn't crazy about them.  the only dish i loved were the oct-wasabi and sashimi, which i can get elsewhere.  Comparing to guu, i like guu and their dishes, service, servers better but i liked the seating arrangement at this restaurant, it has tables and chairs where as guu has picnic tables."}
{"text":"This place may look like an a small restaurant from the front, but once you walk inside you are surrounded with very nice and quaint atmosphere, as well as being greeted by very polite and welcoming servers and hostesses. The service they provide is excellent; they really go out of their way to keep our tables neat and presentable.   Most of the food comes in 2, which is perfect for a date night. The food there is cooked to perfection. You pay for what you get, and what you get is quality food made by talented cooks. I ordered the seared scallop carppacio and it was very good. They had a limited edition grilled jumbo shrimp on their menu so I ordered that as well and the flavours in it were really good. The server even asked us for feedback on it because it was new on their menu. I also ordered the stone grilled tajima beef. It was one of their popular dishes and it was very creatively presented. The flavours were again amazing.   As for dessert, I ordered the almond pudding. I've always loved the almond pudding from Guu, and this place makes them similar in smoothness. They added an extra fruity element to it which surprisingly blends well with the dessert.   Overall I had a pleasant experience from this place. I would definitely recommend those who like izakaya food, or want to try quality izakaya food to try here."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.   We ordered 5 dishes - 2 sushi dishes were okay and the other 3 were just too rich and sweet.   Renkon Kinpira (spicy lotus root) - it was mostly just one note - sweet. I could only eat one.   Stone bowl seafood + sea urchin don - Judging from the name, you can't go wrong with that right? it has my favourite sea urchin. Wrong, it was very rich not in a fresh ocean way where it usually reminds you of the breezy ocean. This time it reminded you of the smelly polluted sea. Also, it has big pieces of daikon that doesn't go with the rest of the texture. Overall it's a confused way of using uni.  Kingyo Style Death Chicken - on the menu it says 'do not order if you aren't too good with spicy food'. It was not spicy at all, if anything it should say 'do not order if you aren't too good with sweet on your meat' because that was the main taste.   By then I was too disappointed to try dessert, I also asked for a box to bag the left overs.  Leftovers, you guys. This is the first time i've ever had to doggy bagged izakaya. I took it for lunch the next day and still had a hard time eating it."}
{"text":"Kingyo is a contemporary Japanese izakaya featuring various Japanese tapas. The ambiance is casual. The decor consist of light-blasting pachinko machines on the wall and Doraemon cartoons behind the bar. The service is attentive. Frozen grapes (instead of candy) are delivered with the bill.  The sushi and sashimi are not bad, but the sushi and sashim are not Kingyo's speciality. Having said that, the daily sushi and sashimi were fresh and a great way to start the meal.  The hot food is what Kingyo does best. The hot stone bowls were excellent. Kingyo's hot plates are refined, thoughtful, artfully presented. In fact, the dishes are better than izakayas that I have been to.The dishes are cooked to order and built on bold textures and flavours, designed to go down nicely with drinks - this is an izakaya afterall.   I would recommend Kingyo if you are in the mood for Japanese hot plates."}
{"text":"I went here on Friday December 4th, 2015 around 9pm with 7 of my co-workers for dinner. When entering the restaurant it was pretty packed and I found the environment to be really loud. As for the food it was just decent, nothing spectacular.   I ordered the Diced Beef Tenderloin Steak and Ebi-Mayo. I found the tenderloin to be very chewy and I personally felt it lacked flavour considering the fact that I was trying to scrape off the remaining sauce  on the hot plate (Sauce was poured over the meal but I felt like there wasn't enough!). As for the Ebi-Mayo, the spiciness was very overwhelming and kind of destroyed the meal itself. Throughout all the dishes that were ordered that night within the group, the 'A Big Kingyo Short Rib' were the best. The ribs were very moist that it can slide off the bone and the portion was huge. To conclude, the portions of the food I found were really tiny and it was some what overpriced for what you received. However; I do give the presentation of the dishes 4 stars.   As for the service, we had two waiters so it wasn't too bad! One of them had a sense of humor so that was pleasant, the other was really polite and filled our waters when needed. Overall it was a great night and I wan't ecstatic about the restaurant or food too much.  ~ Service is: great ~ Decor is: appealing ~ Noise level is: LOUD ~ Food is: moderate ~ Price range is: eh"}
{"text":"I hate to compare it, but being the pioneer of the izakaya movement in Toronto, it's inevitable that we compare all similar Vancouver based restaurants to Guu. KINGYO is like the grown up version of Guu. It's got the izakaya feel and vibe, with a bit of class, quiet, originality and fun.   We walked in to its high ceilings and blinking antique pachinko machines along the wall and a silent projection of Doremon reaching for his red bean pancake on the wall. This place is going to be fun.   The servers are extremely attentive, knowledge and friendly. Food came quickly and with good timing between them, not too close together and far apart enough for us to digest.   The menu has a lot to offer, and lots of unique dishes. Not a lot of fried tempura stuff which is really an easy cop out.   Their presentation of the food is really nice, with different ways of containing some of the side dishes. Although repetitive with the banana leaf on everything it made for some nice photos. This is like AsiansTakingPhotosOfFood heaven.   What we ordered: - LOTUS ROOT  - Renkon Kimpira (okay, good to share not amazing, not spicy)   - TAKE WASABI, pickled octopus in wasabi to wrap in seaweed (if you don't like wasabi skip this, also if y)ou don't like slimy foods would skip it too)   - SEA URCHIN SHOOTER. I wanted to try this egg with shiso, yam, yuzu and sea urchin.. It's awfully expensive at $7 and really have to be adventurous to like this one. You would be able to share this with a close friend or partner  - STONE GRILLED BEEF TONGUE ($10) - it's quite gimmicky cooking your own meat on a stone, but it's a great way to impress people who have never seen it before (my first time too). Impressed this rock stays so hot, and almost instantly cooked the thin pieces of meat. A good sharing plate  - BIG SHORT RIB - they weren't kidding, this thing was huge. It came nicely at the end of the meal and filled everyone right up. A sweet and tangy vinegar sauce made the braised meat crunchy, sticky and tender. Get this one.  - PORK BELLY - Cream Buta Kakuni - This had to be the best dish of the night. So fatty it was creamy. But so much flavour it was explosive, almost. Get this too  - CHICKEN KARAAGE - the first dish that landed on our table. Whatever this magic powder is, I want some. At $8, it was one of those that was worth its value for sure. Good for sharing (ask for a knife). Soft and succulent inside, and perfectly crispy on the outside. Get this three.  - KINGYO YAKIUDON - this was off their special menu. I love kimchi udon and since starting to make it at home my husband feels that it's not special anymore and wanted to try something more plain. But this was anything but plain - filled with mushrooms and beef and seasoned with their magic powder (no really, how do I get some of this)  - UNAGI DON - off the special menu - best unagi don I've ever had. something about the unagi mariande gives it a sweet soy based flavour. served in a stone bowl, it was hot and cripsy without me having to leave the rice in there and pressing it so it will cook.   - GRILLED SQUID KABAYAKI - off the special menu - wasn't amazing. It was a little tough, and not that tasty.   We skipped the sashimi this time because of cost and the fact we wanted to try so many other cooked dishes. Based on the careful preparation of all the food here, I'm sure it will be amazing and worth the price tag.  They also have a special vegan menu that is limited and is an all day lunch box. Worth a try for $15  For dessert, they had only a few.  ALMOND TOFU - soft and silky, but still prefer the one at Guu EGG PUDDING - a creme brulee basically, still very good CASTELLA SPONGE CAKE - you know the cakes you get from the Korean supermarket. It was this drizzled with some sweet sauce and served with ice cream. It wasn't spectacular.  We skipped the dessert on the special menu but maybe we should have gotten that too.   After all was said and done, 5 people, a few pints of Sapporo and a bottle of sake with all this food, it all came out to about $45pp which was a lot less than my first outing at Guu. I think this is quite reasonable! We were full and waddled out of the restaurant with shouts of ARIGATOGOZAIYEEMAAASSHEETAA!!!"}
{"text":"Good reviews should always be given to good places, great food, good menu, big pints of beers and tasty! that should sum it up for you to go here, service was also attentive and on time!"}
{"text":"My favourite Japanese restaurant in GTA.  Reason for recommendations: 1. Fish quality is one of the best in GTA. 2. They know how to cook miso soup properly. You can tell from the taste that they cook the miso soup from dashi. And not many Japanese restaurants makes miso soup properly as they do. More importantly their dashi is the best! Got very deep taste to it. 3. Rice cooked properly. Not too hard or soft just right for your food. 4. Everything they put out and I had so far is prepared in care. No chipped dishes, cups, glass, beer from tap is chilled just right, and so many details make you feel the chef cares. 5. Flavour is the best. Every dish I had there is designed for you to \"experience\" the combination of texture, and flavour of different ingredients. Not an average Japanese place can do."}
{"text":"What an incredible find! I was in Toronto for a few days, and came to Kingyo based on a local's recommendation that it was very authentic and delicious.   Staff: Super friendly. And whenever customers arrive or leave, the whole staff greets/bids farewell in Japanese.  Ambiance: Really clean and cool. Jazz music playing in the background and Japanese film projecting on the back wall - an odd combination but I was digging it.   Food: Just amazing - two of us shared 4 appetizers and a noodle dish and were beyond stuffed. 1) First was the \"death\" chicken, which was basically deep fried chicken thigh in a diablo chili sauce. Super juicy and moist, but the sauce was a bit one-note (a bit too salty) and was probably my least favorite dish.  2) Next came Agebitashi, which is marinated eggplant in sake, mentsuyu, and crispy bonito flakes. Fresh, flavorful, melt-in-your-mouth goodness.  3) Yuzu ankake bokkake udon, which came with stewed beef tendon, soft boiled egg, sour plum, scallions, marinated kelp and tempura bits, all accompanied by a thick yuzu flavoured sauce. This was my absolute favorite! The blends of flavors and textures were spectacular.   After eating the first dishes, we were so impressed and decided to order more!  4) Stone bowl mushroom tofu, thick mushroom paste on deep-fried tofu. This came out sizzling and delicious. They added okra and dried scallops to the sauce which made it extra sticky and flavorful. This was really fun to dig into and eat! 5) Tako wasabi, which is raw and/or cooked diced octopus marinated with wasabi stems and sea kelp, and served with nori seaweed paper. I preferred the cooked octopus over the raw, which was slightly too wet and slimy.   All in all, an amazing experience. Not sure if I'll have the chance to travel back to Toronto anytime soon. But when I do, I'm definitely paying a visit to Kingyo!"}
{"text":"I imagine this to be the kind of place cool kids go to eat in Japan. They have Doraemon playing at the front, arcade game machines on the walls, and a dark modern wooden interior.   The lunch menu prices range from $12-20. I ordered the pork kakuni bowl ($12.8) which is pork belly that was stewed for 6 hours and served with a poached egg, rice and mayo. The combination was so flavorful and the pork belly was SO SO tender! My mom enjoyed her meal which was the negitoro avocado bowl ($11.8), it was a mix of chopped tuna, avocado, green onion and seaweed. It came with a soy sauce mixture and sesame seeds that you could grind for more flavor. She also ordered Tako wasabi ($4.8), octopus in a wasabi sauce that you wrap in seaweed and you can choose for it to be raw, cooked or both! I am not a big fan of octopus because of the texture but I did enjoy the strong wasabi flavor. At the end of the meal, they served cute frozen grapes on skewers.   The service was friendly and I had a great time enjoying the atmosphere and delicious food! Come to experience a different and interesting side of Japanese food that is not sushi/sashimi which most of us know it for!"}
{"text":"The premium wagyu beef was so tasty. Very flavourful. They only serve 10 servings each weekend, luckily they still have it when we ordered it. Sashimi selection was fresh. The black cod, I think it was a bit undercooked. I've ordered the uni rice, I find it a little too sweet to my liking. Service was very good. Just the two dishes can use some fine tuning. Good sake selections!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, fresh sashimi and love the sake and meats.  I recommend you try the whole menu Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"SUPERB SERVICE!   Everyone there really goes the extra mile to serve you! e.g. changing your plates, AND TISSUE (even when it's not even that dirty) making sure there is a staff at the door to bow and greet you out the door ALWAYS Smiling Complementary dessert for our special day celebration, not upon request, but to our pleasant surprise!  Food quality was AMAZING!  tako wasabi was a great starter for those who like sashimi-type food Famous \"O-Sho Restaurant\" Karaage is definitely better than any other fried chicken would totally reorder Tofu and mushrooms bowl! Tuna tataki with ponzu jelly was oh so yummy! Stone bowl pork rice was definitely on the too salty side  Le matcha crème brûlée was \"the best dessert\" my husband said he had ever had  (We did have a late sashimi lunch so I think that also helped since the dishes at Kingyo are meant to be small (Izakaya style))  We also love that we were able to order and enjoy the dishes one at a time.  Prior to going to Kingyo, the only other Izakaya experience we had was Guu.  However, we found Guu a little too loud for our liking.  Kingyo is not as noisy.  The staff still shouts out when welcoming customers, but not noisy.  You can still have a romantic conversation and enjoy some unique food without feeling disturbed.  When there's another date night, I'd totally call up Kingyo!"}
{"text":"One of the better tasting izakaya in town. Tried a variety of items such as boxed sushi, ramen, stone pot tofu and beef tongue, hot sauce chicken and seared tuna.    The seater tuna topped with ponzu jelly sauce and the boxed sushi were particularly delicious. Both made to perfection.  However I took away points for missing an order. And not being able to make a later reservation time, even though plenty of table were empty at the time I left."}
{"text":"I came here with a few people on Saturday and I quite enjoyed the experience.    I ordered the Kingyo Deluxe Bento for $17, of which they only make 10 a day.  Not sure why they limit it to only 10, but ah well.  What's included (salad, soup, tuna tataki, a roll of egg, shrimp tempura, fried chicken, pork belly and fried taro ball).    While it sounds like a lot and looks like a lot (when you receive the tray), it's actually a reasonable amount.    What I really liked: -Miso soup had plenty of veggies and seaweed on it. -Fried chicken had a great mixture of fat and meat to it.   -Shrimp tempura was crunchy.   -The presentation -Their bathrooms! They took so much pride with the Halloween decorations, it was epic.   What I didn't like: -The salad was bland  Overall, the deluxe bento was not bad and it was one of those thing that you had to try, but I wouldn't order it again.  However, when I looked around the room, there were other interesting dishes and they all looked amazing.  I think I would go back and try something different as the service was very friendly (though a bit soft-spoken) and the food was decent enough at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"The sea urchin shooter is a must! It was my favourite of all our dishes - and everything was great so that is saying quite a bit.   Service is friendly and attentive, and the decor is... interesting! Definitely a good venue if you're looking for a new experience! We went for my birthday and it made it memorable."}
{"text":"Of all the sushi restaurants I've tried, Kingyo is definitely one of the top three on my list! It's not your average sushi restaurant where it's all rolls. It's different from what I'm used to seeing in the United States. They serve items such as carpaccio, wagyu, toro, etc. I definitely recommend trying the beef tataki salad, yuzu salmon carpaccio, the toro, and the wagyu if you can get it in time -- they only serve ten orders a day."}
{"text":"I've been following this restaurant for a while now on Instagram and every single dish they post just looks so savoury and delicious!   I didn't eat here but I'm giving 3 stars because of my first impression upon coming to this restaurant. If it wasn't for the Instagram account I am following for Kingyo, I wouldn't be remotely interested in checking this place out again. However, the interior design of this place is pretty awesome and inviting. What wasn't impressive was the greeting I received and the hostess. First, I walked in and no one greeted me. There was a girl who had a uniform on but looked kind of lost. She eventually made her way to the front and then went a table and then came to me. But she was also talking to someone else at the same time while greeting me so it was super awkward because I didn't know what was going on.   Btw, (REWIND) I tried calling to make a reservation on Good Friday. I called on Thursday and Friday morning but the line was busy/ it kept ringing with no answer. When I got to the restaurant at 12:30pm there were tons of empty tables but also a lot of people waiting (about 4 groups were ahead of us). The waitress told us it would be a 30 minute wait and if we didn't want to wait, we should have made a reservation. I told her about the phone situation but she just repeated herself.... Okay, so I'm supposed to call to reserve but I can't get through to make the reservation. One guest suggested that it's busy because they don't want to overwhelm the kitchen. My question is if there aren't enough chefs to cook food for the number of seats in the restaurant, then why aren't there more chefs being hired? I have read other people said the same thing about the long wait, lots of tables issue. I also read that they provide board games to play while you wait so I'm not sure why they didn't just seat us, tell us that it's going to be a wait until we can be served and give us some board games. That would've been cool!   Needless to say, I was starving so I left. I really want to try the food here (although I'm reading that it's kind of mediocre)... But I'll make a reservation next time and do a real food review! Until next time..."}
{"text":"I really like this place. It's a slightly more upscale version of Kinka in Cabbagetown.   There's pachinko machines adorning the wall and Doraemon playing on the projector. The atmosphere is quieter than other Izakayas.   These are some of the dishes I've had:  1. The stone bowl mushroom tofu - if you like fried tofu with enoki mushroom and an umami explosion, this is a must have.  2. Tako Wasabi - bits of octopus with sea kelp and wasabi that you wrap in nori (seaweed) 3. Garlic tuna tataki - quite good but what you would expect 4 karaage - what you would expect  5. Duck - not on their standard menu 6. Mabo Tofu Spring Rolls - a combination of two flavours I love. It didn't disappoint despite the otherwise weird union  7. Dessert:matcha creme brûlée. Not your typical creme brûlée. Felt more like a cake. It was great though.   Service was good and hospitable and my water was filled regularly.   Overall, it's of the nicer Izakayas in Toronto."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of 5, no reservations and only waited for 10 mins on a Friday night during TIFF weekend. So that was pretty awesome.  I felt that service could've been a bit better as every table looked like they've been waiting to be serviced for a while. Although they were under staffed they still accommodated to my needs of ordering sake bombs (a pitcher of sapporo+sake), I guess it's not a common order since the waiter didn't know what I was asking for so I had to explain it to them.   Here's a little 411 on sake bomb Beer+sake= sake bomb (Asian style of a jagger bomb) fill the beer Mug halfway, make sure the sake cup is filled up and slightly held up by the chopsticks. I think there might be a chant before you slam the table but wishing your friend happy birthday is good enough and at the same time everyone slams the table so that the shot drops in like a bomb ... Literally a mess so make sure you have tons of napkins. Important part of this is that everyone chugs it to the last drop!! (please drink responsibly )   Food was impeccable and different.  I loved the presentation of the food but the portions of it makes me want to cry. Prepare to order two of everything or go to McDonalds after :p  Izakaya is tapas style so don't expect to get full off of it. Atmosphere is more upscale than Guu and not as loud and live. I thought the Japanese games on the wall were cool but definitely ruined the feel of a warm lightly dimmed venue with its colorful flashing lights."}
{"text":"Kingyo is my new favorite hidden gem in Toronto!  This place is reminiscent of a revamped, better, cooler version of the old Typhoon in St. Marks, NYC.  Think Izakaya meets 5-star chef meets hipster underground dive bar.  Yeah...everything you could need, right?  The food was incredible -- uni shooters, gorgeous hamachi carpaccio, the crispiest yummiest fried chicken EVER MADE...  all washed down with cold beers (oh the cocktail list was to die for also -- we diidn't have any, but they looked scrumptious).  Not to mention amazingly kind and warm-hearted staff that do their best to make your experience great.  I just wish this place were closer to where I live so I could go every week.  I'll definitely be back, many, many times.  Thanks Kingyo!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! I consider this the best Izakaya Japanese food restaurant in Toronto"}
{"text":"Tried dinner with my friend for the first time. I liked how staff were very polite. Ordered hot bowl unagidon, tan tan noodles, and some other sushi. Unagidon was okay but I liked how the staff mixed it for me. Other food were great as well."}
{"text":"I would give thia a 3 stars.  Nice little izakaya place with some decent food.  We got the beef tongue, which was slice nice and think, which was then cooked on a hot rock.  Also got some sashimi sweet shrimp and scallop, which was decently fresh.  Also ordered two donburi one which contained uni and the other contained beef.  The uni did not taste fresh and the beef was slightly dry."}
{"text":"\"I love this Izakaya!\"  The staff are top notch and very friendly and attentive, always greeting you at the door and escorting and thanking you as you leave.  It's more upper end than say(Guu) and don't expect big portions, but what you can expect artfully decorated yummy dishes.  The Karaage, tako wasabi, and grilled mackerel are safe bets and are my favs.  All in all one of the best I've been to."}
{"text":"Attentive service! Mouth watering food! Great atmosphere!  Everything we ate was beyond our expectations. Think of \"Guu\" but a level up and not as loud.  Started with the torched toro pressed sushi. Very soft and warm rice. Toro was melt in your mouth. Came with six pieces. Was not served with soy sauce.   Kajima beef is a must order! Raw pieces of sliced Kobe grade beef served with a hot rock and three delicious sauces. A bit pricier than the beef tongue alternative but so worth the feeling of the fatty Kobe beef dissolving on the tip of your tongue.  Ordered the bokkake udon as my main dish and it just beyond any of my expectations. Served with a soft boiled egg, beef cubes, tempura bits, and scallions. You are to mix all the ingredients together then enjoy! The udon was perfectly al dente. All of this drenched in the most delicious yuzu sauce. I finished every last bit!  Finished with their 2-layer almond tofu. Comes in a regular and small size but when asked which size would be best, the server insisted that small was just \"oooohhh nooo, small is TOO small, nono!\" LOL. Needless to say we went with the regular size and had absolutely no regrets. Smoothest almond tofu I've ever had!   Dined on a Tuesday evening and there was no wait but most tables were full. Greeted promptly by cheerful staff. Very nice and modern decor. Plenty of seats for couples and a few large party tables (there were a couple of birthday celebrations when we were there). Really loved the pin ball machines on the walls!  I will definitely come back! Really eager to try their lunch menu, as the options are different. Can't wait!"}
{"text":"Came here as part of a farewell dinner to send some friends off across the pond.  The izakaya atmosphere is relaxed but also fun.  There are pachinko machines, samurai swords, and artwork hanging on the wall in the room while bunches of retro and novelty items appear at the bar to entertain if you happen to find yourself there.  There are actual pachinko machines places just outside the restrooms to enjoy if you can figure out how to use'em lol.  The menu offers a lot of choice for meat and veggie lovers alike and there were a few favourite that I would recommend:  Tako Wasabi (raw): I like it better than the cooked version.  Get more of the octopus flavour.  O'Sho Kaarage: really well executed deep-fried chicken with some sea-salt and pepper  Real snow crab pressed sushi: I really enjoyed the crab paste that contained crab brains.  Kinchan Chicken Wings: the touch of curry flavour gave it a little bit of heat that was nice.  What was slightly a let-down was the Kingyo-stye \"death\" chicken.  The menu warns that \"Do not order if you aren't too good with spicy food!\" but had less kick than tabasco or siracha in my opinion.  It was only saved by the fact that it was $10 pitchers of Sapporo. :)  Overall, I would come here again to try more items on the menu like the sushi and sashimi offerings coupled with the stone-grilled beef tongue or kobe beef."}
{"text":"I went to Kingyo with my mother for an early mother's day dinner. I went to Kingyo once before and it had been quite good so I decided to go there again to impress mom!   The food wasn't as good as I remembered it to be. I was actually quite dissappointed and so was my mom!  The service was really good, but it seemed off base compared to the food they were delivering.  We ordered the tuna ponzu dish which was the best of the lot. The waitress recommended the kalbi which was really rough and tasteless. We also ordered the uni rice and it was super super salty =( we them ordered the natto which was also one of the better dishes. The tofu mushroom soup was quite gross and sticky =( unlike the last time i tried it =( Also the avocado red tuna dish was not good...too much avocado overpowering the dish.  Overall, I was sad to spend over 70+ for food we didn't really finish. We walked 30 minutes to get there and disappointment all around"}
{"text":"I've been to Kingyo at least 10 times now and was never disappointed with the quality of food and service every time. The menu has changed since I first came here and there are lot of new items to try, though I wish some of my old favorites were still available such as the ramen salad. The karagaee and pressed sushi are really good and definitely worth trying. Seating is comfortable with a good ambience. I recommend reserving ahead of time on weekends to avoid a long wait time."}
{"text":"I've been mulling over this review for the better half of a week now. I came for two reasons: my birthday, and because with the Asian Food Festival deal Kingyo has right now, you can get a combo for 4 which includes 11 courses, and costs $35/person. I'm a cheap foodie, but I thought this was justifiable for my birthday, and also for the quality of the food and service we received.   Prior to coming, I made a reservation online for Tuesday at 6pm. My confirmation email had a heading that said Tuesday at 6pm, but inside the email, it said Wednesday at 6pm. I called and let them know what had happened, and they told me they'd call me back when they figured it out. I waited a few hours and then called them again. I had to explain the issue again, at which point they fixed my reservation. I had also inquired as to birthday specials, and they offered me a free dessert. They wanted to know how to spell the birthday person's name (so I gave them my own name. Sigh.), and they wanted to know which dessert I wanted (which was nice). I asked for the Otona no Pudding, and they asked if I wanted a half portion or a full portion (full, of course). When we got to Kingyo, they had our reservation right, so that issue ended there, which was nice.  The courses  in our dinner did not all come separately. Some of them came at the same time. My biggest issue of the night was that for a 4 person dinner, a good number of the dishes (the ebi mayo, beef tataki, sashimi, battera, waygu) did not come in multiples of four. There were six shrimp, three pieces of each kind of sashimi, six pieces of each of the battera, and nine pieces of wagyu). How does one split 3 pieces of sashimi between four people? With the others, at least there was enough for each person to try at least one. For the sashimi, we didn't each get to try all of them. We did let the servers know, and they agreed that it was odd and said they would inform the kitchen, but they didn't actually resolve the problem for us.  Stone bowl kinoko mushroom tofu - Think agedashi tofu but with a thick goopy mushroom sauce. Hot and delicious. The presentation was a tad sloppy though. One of the four tofu pieces had fallen to the side of the dish.   Beef tataki with ume plum dressing - The beef was tender. The dressing was on point. The greens were fresh. Fried garlic slivers? Yum.  Tuna tataki with ponzu jelly - Picture perfect. Tuna was delightful. Ponzu jelly was a tad strong for the tataki. Love the little bottle of sauce they serve with it. Very cute.  Hamachi carpaccio - A tad messy. Hard to see the actual hamachi because of all the other stuff on the plate. Tasty, but the hamachi got a bit lost. Difficult to share between four people when the star of the show is next to invisible.  5 kinds of assorted sashimi - Once again, 3 pieces of each. Not cool. Sweet shrimp (a tad gooey on the outside), salmon, albacore tuna?, scallop (sweet), and hamachi? (very fatty in a good way).   Ebi mayo - Fried nicely. Could have been a tad neater in presentation. Sauces looked a tad sloppy. Mayo was a tad strong.  Chicken Karaage - Very juicy. Big hit with my dad.   Beef Steak Tenderloin - A tad overcooked, but perhaps that's because I like my steak, even in cube form, rare to medium rare. I like that it was served on a sizzling plate, with the sauce poured on table-side. Tasty, but in terms of sequence in our dinner, this really shouldn't have come to our table right before the A5 wagyu got here.  A5 Wagyu Grilled on a Hot Stone - The beef is brought out raw (check out the lovely marbling), and you grill it on the hot stone provided. What I appreciated was that our server suggested the proper doneness for our beef. The stone doesn't stay hot for too long (we had to get a second one to finish cooking our 9 pieces of wagyu), so we wanted to start grilling immediately.  My issue was that when the wagyu came, we had just started on our tenderloin. Logically, we should finish that before we start the wagyu, so that we upgrade, and not downgrade the beef we're eating, but that meant we had to rush the tenderloin. Once we got to the wagyu, it was so incredibly juicy. Definitely worth the price point for this meal.  Aburi Shime Saba (mackerel) Battera and Toro (tuna) and Avocado Battera - Both kinds of battera came on the same plate. We were told that they had already put soy sauce on them, so we wouldn't have to. The general consensus was that the sauce they put on it was a tad strong (both in salty and sour notes). This was especially the case for the mackerel, as it's a salty fish. The battera fell apart quite easily. Both kinds of fish were very fresh and very tasty.  Otona no Pudding - About the size of a standard creme brulee. Kind of an egg custard with berries on top. Caramel on the bottom was quite bitter. Not quite offset by the sweet caramel on top. Could have been a tad sweeter. Really rick and eggy though. Yum.  All in all, a fairly satisfying meal for four. Happy birthday to me!"}
{"text":"For something that is rated so highly and spoke so fondly of, I was immediately surprised to find it DEAD at 9:30pm on a saturday night? The place is big, fancy and aesthetically pleasing.. but why was there only 1 other table? Also, it left me wondering why an izakaya, especially a popular one located downtown closes at 11:30pm on a weekend..  The service was awesome and they were very efficient. That's on an empty night though, hopefully it would be the same for a busy one. Does it get busy here?? The menu of drinks were super unique and next time I'm getting the doraemon punch for sure! Sounds yummy and super cute names definitely sell me. They had a bunch of interesting cocktails and a nice list of sake. We ended up being basic 4ever and getting a pitcher of Sapporo as we always do.   The food was pretty good! I found the vegetarian donburi with tofu & taro + rice & spring mix was perfect. I couldn't finish it because it carbed me up too fast. Also had the kimchi cucumber sticks, which is a really nice snack to munch on. He had the tan tan ramen, karaage and this fish thing that he said he liked - when the pickiest person about their fish actually likes it, that's a good sign right?   Overall a cute place and I'd definitely be back to visit if I was in the area. Just wish it opened later and was a bit more 'lit'"}
{"text":"Went here on a Tuesday night. Super nice environment . Sashimi are so fresh and soooooo good. Even though is abit pricy and and food portion is not enough to fill you, but is a nice place for a little snack and drink. Would def. Come back."}
{"text":"Probably the best Izakaya in Toronto! Had an awesome time and everything was delicious. Great staff and really nice interior. A must."}
{"text":"I was blown away by the quality of the seafood here, and the service is also very friendly and quick!  What I ordered:  - Hamachi (seared): very fresh and tasty with Japanese dressing. - Fish cheek: slightly crispy and with just the right amount of seasoning. - Bone marrow: rich and flavoured nicely, very indulgent! - Scallops: definitely part of my last meal repertoire...SO fresh and sweet! I could eat plates upon plates of this!!!  Prices are pretty reasonable as well for the quality you get!"}
{"text":"I came here with a friend after she heard raving reviews and saw amazing pictures from this place. That night, we went all out and ordered: karage (fried chicken), two sets of torched pressed sushis, a ramen each, an assortment of 5 types of sashimi, half a dozen of oysters, a grilled mackerel cheek and a serving of uni (sea urchin). Lets just say that the bill was not cheap... but the food is definitely good.   The standout dishes were the fried chicken that was super well seasoned and extremely juicy, the torched sushis, especially the mackerel one that was so smokey and rich in flavours and the sashimi (sweet shrimp, tuna, salmon, mackerel and I forget the last one).  Overall, the food is great here but expect to pay. The portions are not very big either (we finished absolutely everything). I"}
{"text":"Ordered the lunch AAA steak. It came with miso soup.  Portion was perfect. 171lb man. It was cooked rare with a nice pink center.   We also had the Pork Loin Cutlet (Tonkatsu) combo, it arrived with a mountain of cabbage. It was cooked just right. Juicy, tender with the perfect krisp.   Not expensive which we were both surprised. Will definitely return. Hospitality is wonderful."}
{"text":"Nothing special to write about. It's surprisingly a pretty big place and we came at a quieter time. Had some high expectations but the delivery was poor. Certain dishes poorly thrown together and sometimes cold. Dishes are hit or miss on freshness. Disappointing because the potential is there. The menu just isn't executed well enough. Uni shooters are cool but not when the uni isn't fresh. Guu may be slightly better but the current state of izakaya in Toronto hasn't yet found a worthy standard bearer."}
{"text":"My favourite Japanese restaurant for lunch. The lunch menu is a steal and it's a luxurious bento. The servers are attentive and professional which is hard to find in Toronto. The food though is a hit or a miss as I tried the regular menu on other occasions and it wasn't the best, super norm. Still, the lux bento box makes up for it! Come here for lunch!!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner (finally) and oh boy I was so glad we checked out their dinner menu!  One of the great things about this place is that they constantly update their menu depending on the season and demand. I follow them on instagram to be kept updated.   GREAT SERVICE. Super friendly, attentive, and polite.  EVEN BETTER FOOD. We ordered like five different items. They all blew our minds. Their shooters ($9.8 each) were worth every penny. Fresh and just delightful. Great start to a great meal. Beef tongue on a hot stone ($10.5). We wanted to try at least one item that we get to grill on a hot stone. The tongue was thinly sliced so make sure you don't overcook them. Brussels sprouts. You will enjoy this dish even if you are not a big fan of them. They are smothered in sauce and bacon fat. Omelette yakisoba (special menu for limited time) was also great. The sauce was not too sweet or overpowering. Noodles were perfectly cooked. Matcha tiramisu and strawberry shortcake (limited time only) were not too sweet but still satisfying.   I became a fan of this place after this meal. There were so many items I wanted to try on the menu which means I need to come back."}
{"text":"My favorite Izakaya place! the servers are soooo cute and the dishes look sooo pretty!"}
{"text":"Recently came across a list of the Top 50 'must eat at' restaurants in Toronto, so making it a mission to try them all - eventually.  Kingyo was one of these.    Location/ambience: - Located just off Parliament in Cabbagetown, we lucked out and got a spot right out front of the place, so can't complain - but then again it was around 9pm so you might need to park further if you come early.  Nicely decorated inside, louder than most restaurants, and you're greeted quite openly when you arrive.  So far so good..  Food/price: - Took the advice from several other reviewers in deciding what to get, so here's the rundown:  - TAKE WASABI - got a split of half hot, half cold octopus with seaweed wrap.  The cold was a little slimy (which I expected) but also very chewy (which was a negative).  The hot was much better - if you're trying it, get the hot.  Not a great value but makes for a nice starter.  - TUNA-TATAKI WITH PONZU JELLY - bar none best dish of the night.  Get it.  The tuna just melts in your mouth and the jelly is amazing.  Don't question it - just get it.  - STONE GRILLED BEEF TONGUE - for $10, it's expensive.  You get maybe 8-12 pieces of very thinly sliced beef to cook on a hot stone, with a few condiments (oil, hot paste) for dipping.  High on novelty so was neat to try - do it if you want to try something different, not if you want to get full..  - CHICKEN KARAAGE with magic powder - ok I'm guessing the 'magic powder' is just salt, pepper, and MSG - but who knows.  It was good - the chicken is dark, juicy, and has some gristle to it (which I like but you might not), and has a great batter.  Most Western-feeling dish of the night  - PORK BELLY - very fatty, but so good.  Scraped off most of the top fat and had the rest (though I admit it was tempting to eat the fat too, it was that good..)  - SHORT RIB - last dish of the night, and it was BIG.  Nice and tender and with a great sweet dark sauce, if you weren't full before this, you'll be full after you're done..  Overall: - Definitely enjoyed the range of different dishes.  Price-wise, it's not the greatest value, especially the Take Wasabi and Beef Tongue, but until I compare some other places on the 'Top 50' (Guu, I'm looking at you..), I'll reserve judgment over whether I'll return again."}
{"text":"I've been here twice already. It's family friendly even with young kids.   We loved almost every dish. Tuna tataki rocks and we've ordered a couple of those. The chicken wings rock. Also try the seafood rice that comes in a hot stone bowl. Delicious.   Enjoy your meal with hot sake and enjoy the bar type vibe without the crazy loud yelling of orders like Guu."}
{"text":"Walked in here on a Sat evening and saw a pretty packed house. Great vibes, loved the interior, and hostess was quick to find us a place to sit. Once we sat down, we realized this was a really trendy place. Honestly the menu was hard to understand and nothing really stood out. Waiter barely knew English so we had to repeatedly ask twice for the same thing. Overall portions are quite small but tasty. This is a place more for starters and to have a beer. Would not recommend this place for dinner."}
{"text":"???downtown??????????ok???????????????????????????kinyo??????????d????????????????a????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"I came here for a birthday dinner and man is this a cool place with It's a lively yet intimate setting. The loud Japanese greeting as you're seated helps build the setting of the place. They had Ultraman playing in the background, I mean for people who know what it is how cool is that?  The service came quick and the food started coming fast. I strongly recommend the following items:  Hamachi Carpaccio: A well balanced fish dish, with a hint of citrus flavour. It delivered an amazing Japanese and south american fusion flavour that you need to try!  Beef tongue on hot stone: the thinly sliced tongue is cooked on a hot stone. The thin meat just melts in your mouth flavour with a citrus punch. Watching it cook on the stone was entertaining to watch as well!  If you haven't gone here yet, book your reservation and go!"}
{"text":"In the midst of Cabbagetown, Kingyo is a cute place tucked away in a small street just off of Parliament Street, north of College Street.   The ambiance of this Izakaya is clean, with lots of Japanese contemporary decor, arcade machines used as wall fixtures.  In addition they've got a big TV by the bar playing some Japanese anime. Kingyo after 9 pm can gets busy as they have featured after hour specials; among they Oysters are $1 and Sapporo is on special by the pint.   Our group of 15-17 came here for a birthday party hence it was recommended to pre-order; either their $30 or $40 fixed menu of various Japanese tapas. (I chose the $30 menu)  The service was excellent, but most of all attentive, friendly and knowledgeable.  For me half the dishes that came out needed explanation as they were being served to our table.  The food quality and presentation was excellent but their portions are small. in terms of food our fixed menu included the following items: *Beef tataki salad- 4.5/5 great cut of beef and fresh!  *Chicken Kigare- 3/5 felt like I was eating basic fried chicken.  *Tofu in hot pot- 4.5/5- great melody of flavors. *Tuna tataki- freshly cut, not too thick. *Ox tongue- 3.5/5 cooked on a hot rock, *Aburi shime saba (mackerel) sushi- 5/5  *Toro (tuna) and avocado sushi.- 5/5 loved the avocado, really complimented this dish!  Overall the place is great! quality is excellent, however be prepared to pay a bit more!"}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday - portions are sort of small for what you pay. Seafood rice bowl is delicious."}
{"text":"Oh, Kingyo. A dinner reservation (a recommended must) ensures my walk across to the wrong side of the Don River to this Cabbagetown izakaya was not a waste. Then I have to contend with the mesmerizing flashy Japanese pinball-esque machines (pachinkos) as decor that I can never figure out how to use quickly enough, even if my life and a free meal depended on it (I'm told you can get $10 off if you win).   It's a more dim and classy atmosphere than, say, Guu, and not as noisy. Our service was slow at first but only seemed to pick up as the night got busier. Like other such upscale Japanese eateries in this fine city, you have Japanese waitpersons whose English is a tad better than my mom, but nonetheless make the effort to deliver high friendly service with a bit of quirk that makes going to these places so fun without ever going overseas.  Many of their dishes are a fusion take on Japanese food. After getting past the the overwhelming exoticness of their menu options and the fancy platings, I found many of them to be a delight of flavours of all sorts. We went all over the map: tomato kimchi (cherry tomatoes with a bit of heat and umami), tako wasabi (kind of an octopus ceviche with a kick of wasabi), seafood and sea urchin don (hot mixed rice bowl with a light buttery and seafood-slimy taste haunting you), and the frozen matcha crème brûlée (kind of like the green tea ice cream many Japanese restaurants serve for dessert, but done in clever crème brûlée form with that burnt fragile top layer). And whatever else that sounded disgustingly exotic (stingray? stingray!). We were mesmerized by what other diners had, like beef slices grilled live on a hot stone.  Watching all that food and the bill add up (to about $50/person), still I was hungry against all odds. I had been eying something in the menu all this time: \"Kingyo style Death Chicken.\" The name sounds as menacing as its accompanying description: \"Deep fried chicken tossed in original diablo chili sauce. Do not order if you aren't too good with spicy food!\" Even our server seemed shocked with my request. \"You sure? I think it's very hot! I can't believe you.\" Which only piqued my curiosity further.  When the HELL'S CHICKEN (as this dish is referred to in the receipt--yes, in all caps) arrived, I braced myself and took a bite. It tasted like your average bar suicide wings-and suicide wings to me taste like nothing extreme. There was sufficient heat and the greasy batter texture of suicide wings, but as hotness is subjective, I have to remind myself that chili novices (and clever marketing names) tend to overexaggerate the level of spiciness of many hot foods. Fellow chiliheads should skip this one.  That definitely-not-deathly chicken was the only major disappointment of an otherwise savoury and fun night. The men's room downstairs is stocked with dental floss, mouthwash and other such toiletries so you can freshen up. Keep a cheeky eye out for some dirty magazine covers displayed in a dark corner.  {TTC: Winchester Street ????????????? [65] ?????????. Or just take the 506 to Parliament/Carlton and walk further a couple blocks.}"}
{"text":"\"Serious f'n goodness\" is how I captioned my thoughts on this restaurant on another social media site. We were in Toronto for a few days, first time visitors, and we were almost overwhelmed with the choices when it came to Asian cuisine. We were beyond lucky that there were seats available at the bar for walk-ins!  I can't remember everything that we ordered but each one was seriously f'n good! The uni and the duck sukiyaki were particular standouts...happy to say that the beautiful presentation was surpassed by the delicious flavors of each dish.  Our server/bartender was incredibly attentive and he guided us through the choices. Our restaurant experience was definitely a highlight of our short visit to Toronto."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by a Japanese friend. We came here on a saturday and it was reasonably packed. Not too packed but yet nit quiet.   We ordered the meal for 2 which was came with quite a few options. I thought the food was very well presented, and I like the interactiveness of the meal. Cooking meat on hot rock, wrapping food in dry seaweed, etc.  The food was also delicious and very rich. I barely give a place a 5 star but i thought everything was about the experience  and they deliver."}
{"text":"Excellent service.  Presentation of the food is wonderful.  Their dishes all have flavour and are tasty.  The pachinko machines on the wall are a tease.  Wish there was one you could actually play, but I guess that wouldn't be appropriate in a restaurant.  LOL.  I agree with another review where they have to work on their desserts, but I'm not one to order desserts anyways.  I would not go regularly due to the prices on their dishes, but when I'm feeling to treat myself, I would go here since it's a 10 minute walk from where I live....dangerous!  My husband loves the Pork Ramen, calamari and cod.  I have yet to pick a favourite dish.  But I seem to enjoy more of their sushi than their cooked dishes."}
{"text":"Great restaurant. Came here with a  group of 4. Reasonably priced (our tab was $200 tax and tip incl) and good portions.  I'm giving it 4 stars because their dessert menu needs a little bit of work. However, their stone grilled beef and seaweed calamari was great.  In my opinion, Kingyo is better than Guu for the quality of food."}
{"text":"I was doing a search on Yelp and found this place. Since my gf likes sushi, and it's our anniversary, we reserved a table here. We came for lunch, it wasn't too busy at that time. The server was aware of our special occasion, so specifically led us to a booth table. His intention was to give us a bigger space and obviously, we like his initiative.  We ordered a few signature dishes, which are highly recommended in the reviews. The food came very fast. The uni bowl and the beef tongue came first. The size of the uni bowl is small, but the taste is very delicate. My gf likes all kinds of seafood and she knows if the ingredients are fresh or not, and no doubt, she gave credits to the dish, since the uni is fresh and the combination of the ingredients was well selected. The beef tongue was extremely fresh. After we laid the tongue on the hot stone, the smell made us more hungry. The servers constantly came around to see if we needed additional assistance. He saw our stone was too small, so he brought us a bigger one without our request.   The Makunouchi combo and 7-piece sashimi combo were our entrees.  I have to say that both of the dishes were so exquisite, from its decoration to the ingredients. As shown in my photos, they had different combinations, we had chicken, beef, pork and various kinds of fish. After we had all, the server presented us the ice cream as the dessert. As our occasion, they wrote 'happy anniversary' on the tray, which we thought it's very sweet and thoughtful.   Overall, I gave them the highest rating, which is not just the compliment for the taste of the food, but also their mindful and outstanding service."}
{"text":"Food 4.25/5 Service 2.5/5 Overall: 3.75/5  I've eaten at Kingyo a few times in the past and have always enjoyed it. Food is tasty and nicer than what you get at other izakayas, such as Guu. However, I came here with my family for a birthday dinner a few weeks ago and it left a sour taste in my mouth.  I had booked a reservation online. When the server came to take our orders, we asked for the $40 course menu, which is listed on their website. The server said that it could not be done because we needed to request it in advance. Now, I had clearly read their website, which states: \"...if you wish to have something swapped out, you must contact us at least 2-3 business days in advance, so we can prepare the special items for you!\" I explained to them that on their website, it says that we have to call ahead IF WE WANT TO HAVE SOMETHING SWAPPED OUT. However, we had no intention of making any changes to the menu; we were happy with it as is. The server asked me what website I was looking at. I had to pull it up on my phone to show her that I was, in fact, looking at the correct website. She said the website had wrong information. She said that the kitchen wasn't able to prepare the course menu because they weren't given sufficient notice. Now, I don't understand how that could be - all the items on the course menu appear on the regular menu! The course menu was simply a better deal, money-wise, which is why we requested it (we were a group of 6). What if I had simply ordered the same items a-la-carte? Would they tell me they couldn't fulfill my order? I asked to speak with a manager. She said the manager wasn't in.   After having us sit there for about 20 minutes without water or anything, the server came back and said that she called the manager and they agreed to do the course menu for us. For 6 people, we got 2 of each item (1 dish to be shared among 3 people). There were about 10 or 11 dishes total.  All of the dishes were quite good and we were quite full at the end. I appreciated the variety of food - raw food, salad, fried food, rice. Since it was my birthday, I got a complimentary frozen green tea creme brulee. That was a nice touch.  I would go back for the food, but service left something to be desired. Maybe they should revise their website to read: \"If you would like to partake in our course menu, you must notify us X business days in advance.\""}
{"text":"Great food! Everything that we had was delicious. Keep in mind that it is a small tapas/plates kind of place so the portions are small! You'll have to order quite a few things if you're hungry but that's the beauty of it. They also have some very creative, delicious cocktails. Our waitress was very sweet but she had a difficult time speaking/understanding English. We ordered a sashimi plate, and when we realized it wasn't coming, we had to order it again to get it. She didn't understand the first time. The other waitresses seemed to have a better grasp of English though. All in all, I would gladly return!"}
{"text":"Unique dining experience - will take a few more visits to try everything I wanted to on the menu. Sashimi is fresh and fatty, battera rolls are a must-try, and as someone who doesn't eat much meat, the pork belly was too good to pass up. The two-seat tables were a little close together but great decor and atmosphere overall. Prices are on the high side - comparable to Jabistro. If you're looking for more value, I'd stick to Guu. Ask the waiter if the Facebook promotion is still on - if you \"like\" the restaurant's page on Facebook, they'll give you a free dessert voucher for your next visit."}
{"text":"Absolutely a great place to eat some and drink some. Kingyo defines itself as an izakaya but the atmosphere here was really high end and classy and nothing like an izakaya like Guu or Zakkushi. Don't get me wrong, it's just more restaurant-like rather than a place to just get loud and to have a good time.  The decor in here is standard, nice wooden tables with comfy chairs and semi-open booth seats (there might be a name for these seats but..oh well). The lighting in here was very dim-lit and dark but it was bright enough that I can see what I was doing, eating and drinking.  Onto the drinks, their drink menu is great and the drinks themselves are great tasting and delightful. My favourite drink of all time is their Ramune Peach Drink Cocktail. If you're there, definitely order that or try it out and you might just fall in love like I did too!  So my friend, her sister and I went all out. We've been meaning to eat at Kingyo for the longest time ever so when we got there, we ordered like no tomorrow. We got the octopus appetizer (tako wasabi), kaarage chicken, yellow tail carpaccio, salmon sashimi, black cod, stone bowl pork kakuni don and the stone grilled beef tongue.  The presentation of every dish was great but the presentation of the tako wasabi took home the medal. I didn't even want to eat it because it looked so good. The appetizer dish itself was delicious. We ordered the half & half (half cooked and half raw octopus) and it was flavourful. Each bite packed a punch and I mean it literally. It threw punches to my mouth because of the little itty bitty wasabi bits infused into the marinade.  The kaarage chicken was standard, it was juicy, soft and still ever so crunchy.  The yellow tail carpaccio was delicious. Each bite was an explosion of awesome and the flavours of every element on that dish went so well together that I would go back for that same dish every time.  The salmon sashimi was great too! Super fresh and creamy and you could also taste that fresh fishy taste but it wasn't too strong, it actually gave the fish more flavour.  The pork stone bowl rice was actually pretty good. Normally I never order these stone bowl rices because it either tastes meh or even more meh but I was surprised, this dish was good. The sweet flavour of the crispy yet soft rice and the chewiness of the pork, it was a good combination.  Holy cod (yes), that black cod was absolutely delicious. You may think, \"Yooo why is she amping this dish up\" but trust me, I'm not. The cod was grilled to perfection, you get the hints of the charred brown bits on the cod but it was still smooth. You can really taste that natural cod fish taste but infused with the flavours of the grill. The miso sauce they had that goes with the fish was definitely unique. It was creamy, buttery, flavourful and had a hint of citrus in it. This sauce was very new to me but it went really well together with the cod.   Finally, the one dish that you've all been waiting for (ok not really), is the stone grilled beef tongue. At first, I was teasing my friend, begging for her to order this but she didn't like beef tongue so we opted out from that and ordered the regular beef but to my surprise, our waitress came out with beef tongue instead. We didn't care so much and didn't want to hassle the waitress to get the regular beef so my friend risked it and tried it out. She loved it (I hope she did, but I really liked it!).   Next time we will definitely order the regular tajima beef instead of tongue but overall this stone grilled dish was delicious. I wish they gave us a little bit more pieces for the price but it was a unique eating experience because you were given your own little heated rock (or I should say, stone) to use to cook your raw meat.   Overall, this place is a great place to kick back for food and drinks. Food's a little bit on the expensive side but it's definitely a real treat. You can also just come here with some friends for a couple of drinks because they make their drinks like they mean it."}
{"text":"Kingyo offers decent Japanese food for above-average prices ($15-20 for a one-course lunch). I had the Tan Tan Noodle Combo (small bowls of ramen and chicken don) which was flavourful but too salty for my liking. The food was heavy on carbs and light on meat and vegetables. It tasted good, but it was not worth the price tag.   The atmosphere is eclectic with modern wooden decor alongside whirring Japanese arcade games. The service was good, and overall it was an enjoyable meal."}
{"text":"Came here with a family of 6. The environment is more open than similar izakayas like Guu but more open and spacious. We ordered several don's, udon's, sashimi, and fried chickens. Prices were as expected at a place like this (kinda pricey). Our server along with other waitresses were very helpful and polite with what to order and explaining the dishes. We enjoyed the dishes as they were very tasty. The diablo sauce for the fried chicken was not very spicy. Strangely, the servers kept dropping dishes throughout th restaurant. Would definitely come back for a special ocassion."}
{"text":"AWESOME place! Love the food! And they even has Pa-chin-ko to play (near the washroom)!!!!!"}
{"text":"Service : 4 / 5 Environment : 4 / 5 Food & Drinks : 4 / 5 Price : 3.5 / 5  Overall : 15.5 / 20  Comments: - I find food and service is alot better then Guu on Church - definitely call in advance for reservation, this place is gets packed really quickly on weekends.   Pictures of the food I ordered can be found here: http://goo.gl/ByJfi"}
{"text":"I think this restaurant is definitely on my list of top 10 favourite restaurants in Toronto. Food is simply unbelievably amazing, the seating area is comfortable (ahem, not something you can exactly say at most Izakayas in Toronto...looking at you, Guu) and the service is fairly attentive!   Pro tip, I recommend the Unagi lunch special. I've had it many times and it really does not disappoint. The most unique aspect of the meal is the kettle that holds broth to soften the hardened rice at the bottom of your stone bowl. So delicious!   Make sure you check out the bathrooms before you leave. They're quite cool!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars  This is a really authentic Japanese restaurant that serves Izakaya and sashimi.   I've been here twice. I remember the first time, I was really impressed with the freshness of the sashimi and the kingyo izakaya set (only makes 10 sets a day). Perhaps it's what we ordered this time around, but the food was underwhelming for me. We ordered the pork Kakuni and sashimi bowl with rice. The pork was a bit dry, but the sides were really good. I especially enjoyed the tofu. The sashimi was really fresh, but they added some cooked salmon in the bowl, which was a it dry. I wish they added uni in it!   They have beer for $3 at lunch. I enjoyed the frozen grapes as a dessert. For $45 for lunch, I feel it wasn't worth it. You pay for quality here, but I didn't find the food prepared well this time around."}
{"text":"The portions were really big, which justified the pricier options on the menu. Everything we ate was absolutely delicious, and the noodles were cooked to the perfect amount of chewiness. Would recommend to visit!"}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's birthday dinner. I loved the Mio sake, and God Fish cocktail.   Fried chicken was great, so as the other dishes we ordered. I like that Kingyo is not very noisy as other Japanese restaurants, you can actually sit down and have a conversation.   Will recommend to friends and come back!"}
{"text":"Very authentic Japanese food for sure. I love coming for lunch because there's never a wait and it's calm and quiet. The food is spot on. The sashimi is extremely fresh too. Service is great and they have very cool Japanese decor. This is definitely somewhere I would bring friends and family who are visiting as I have always been able to impress them!"}
{"text":"This is my second time at Kingyo and since the last time I've been here, the menu seems to have changed a lot - for the better! All the dishes were really great, super tasty and lots of different textures and flavours. We ordered the Diced Beef Tenderloin Steak, Yuzu \"Ankake\" Bokkake Udon, Chefs Special Kingyo Appetizer Bento Box and Aburi Toro & Avocado Torched Sushi.   The Diced Steak came on a sizzling hot plate and the waitress poured the sauce over it as they served it, so it sizzled even more. Great quality meat and really tasty with the radish.   The Udon came with an assortment of veggies and a poached egg that you mix in with the hot soup. All the flavours combined were fantastic.   The Bento Box, as they say on the menu, is a great way to taste a little of everything if it's your first time at Kingyo. Great assortment of little appetizers such as Chicken Karrage, Okra Kimchi, Beef Tataki, Chopped Tuna, etc. Such a great deal for $14.50. It was very cutely presented as well.   The Sushi was pretty good as well. Not the best torched sushi I've had, but pretty high up there. Very filling as well!  Loved Kingyo, great service, really great food and great atmosphere. Highly recommend to anyone who loves Japanese food!"}
{"text":"Haven't had good sashimi in a while.  The dinner menu is a bit pricey, so we came here for lunch instead.  I got the Kaisen Don which is assorted sashimi, grilled salmon, ikura (roe) and tobiko over rice.  The rice bowl was very tasty, with the perfect amount of sauce and flavour!  The miso soup that came with the don was not any ordinary miso soup.  The miso soup had a meaty broth flavour to it, and came with radish and carrot slices.  My friends got the Chef's Choice Sashimi Combo and the Kingyo's Assorted Delux Bento, and they both seemed to enjoy their meal.  It is definitely more wallet-friendly to order the Chef's choice Sashimi Combo than to order sashimi on it's own.  The waitress mentioned that the assorted sashimi came from places like Ontario, Vancouver (BC) and Japan.  Coming from Vancouver, B.C., I find that sashimi/sushi quality and price is definitely better over there, but that's to no surprise."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite Japanese izakaya! It has a really chill vibe with pachinko machines decorated on the wall. And definitely less noisy than some of the other izakayas. It might not be the authentic experience some may be seeking. But it's better for conversations.  Of course, the best part is the food!  All the sashimi pieces are extremely fresh. The salmon is the best I've ever tried in Canada. The uni (sea urchin) is delicious as well. The scallops has a refreshing sweetness to it.  The Hot stone BBQ was a fun experience. The meat was served raw with a sizzling hot stone on the plate. When the meat is placed on the hot stone, it stuck to the stone surface and can be easily removed when it's cooked. The hot stone stays surprisingly hot for quite some time. The meat was very tender and delicious.  I tried otona no pudding as dessert. It tastes like creme brûlée but has more of an eggy flavor to it. Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"Ok people... Food was De-Lish!!! ;) the Pork belly rice was super tended and just the right balance of sweet. Did the sponge cake for dessert... Meh... Nothing to write home about. If you love Sashimi... Eat it here! So fresh and so yummy! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Went here before a show at the Phoenix Concert Theatre and here's what we had:  Watermelon Kimuchi (3/5) - I think considering the rave reviews I read, this was pretty disappointing. Lacked the acidity I feel is really important in any good kimchi.   Wings (4/5) - Great! Tasty but a bit too salty and not particularly special in any way.   East Coast Salmon Sashimi (4/5) - Really fresh, came with really good wasabi, but not worth the 12 bucks we paid for the 7 pieces we got.  Hokkaido Scallop Sashimi (5/5) - Superb! Definitely get this if available.   Beef Tongue (5/5) - So good! Just make sure you don't cook it on the hot stone too long or it'll be tough.   Uni and Scallop Rice (2/5) - I'm sorry but I hated this! Cooked uni? No thanks.  Toro Pressed Sushi (1/5) - This was the worst dish of the night. The fish was clearly not fresh--it was tough and stringy and I ended up eating less than one piece.   Pork Tantan Ramen (4/5) - Good, but once again, way too salty. The noodles were yummy though.   Soft Tofu with Mushroom (5/5) - HANDS DOWN the best dish of the night. The skin of the tofu was soooo tasty.   All desserts (3.5/5) - We got the pudding, the creme brûlée and the gelato. The pudding and the brûlée were good, but the gelato was so lacklustre.   The service was great. Our waters were always full, they were also very attentive and kind. Wish the food was better though. For the three of us, after tax and tip, we paid around $145."}
{"text":"Hostess was outrageously inexperienced.  Gave random, false wait time and was still unable to accommodate a party of 2 with a table after having waited more than double the time as promised. That's 1.5 hr wait. No systematic booking system but a simply old note pad.   Don't bother coming without reservation. And don't trust the hostess."}
{"text":"Ordered the pork loin cutlet (tonkatsu) lunch combo, a jasmine tea and the matcha creme brulee. The food and service was excellent and will definitely revisit and the near future"}
{"text":"I came here with fellow yelper, Vanessa C., for my farewell dinner. We had reservations, because we were worried that a lot of people were going to be there -- but it ended up being a super duper snowy day in Toronto - so there weren't that many people there. However, it definitely started to fill up afterward!  We ordered the following:  - TAKO-WASABI: One of my favourite appetizers of the evening.  - TUNA-TATAKI WITH PONZU JELLY: Absolutely delicious - I would recommend. - SEARED SCALLOP CARPACCIO: Was a bit of a disappointment, comparatively speaking to Guu Izakaya's. - STONE-GRILLED BEEF TONGUE: DEFINITE recommend. I've never had stone-grilled food before, and this was quite the treat! - ABURI TUNA TORO PRESSED SUSHI: It seems like the trend nowadays is to get pressed sushi! It was quite delectable. - STONE BOWL SEAFOOD SEA URCHIN DON: Fellow yelper, Justin C., had recommended this to us... But I was quite disappointed with it. - RAMEN: Don't get it. I was sad. :( - Special: AGEDASHI CHEESE & CHERRY TOMATOES: Initially it sounded pretty disgusting, but the waitress had recommended this, so we had it -- and it was UBER good.  The food arrived really quickly -- pretty much all in one go. I was sitting there going, \"Oh shoot, do we still have space on our table for all this food?!\" Service was also great -- the waitresses and the hostess were very nice and tried to make conversation every time they came by. However, it was pretty funny when they asked us if we had ever had uni before (and if it's a usual thing to get in Canada). I guess they're new to the country?  From my end, I could see the large screen TV playing some cheesy old school Japanese shows. My friend could see the crazy dizzying pachinko machines in the background though, which would've totally given me a seizure.  Too bad I didn't get more of a chance to check out Kingyo before I left for San Francisco! However, definite recommend to all!"}
{"text":"One of, if not the best Izakaya in Toronto. I have visited multiple times and have not been disappointed. Their Happy Hour menu is also a great deal for beer and oysters. I recommend the Tako Wasabi, Pork belly in hot stone bowl, beef tenderloin on a hot stone, Ebi-shrimp and their pressed sushi. Can't really go wrong with anything here. The prices are very reasonable given the quality of food and pricing of Izakaya food in general in Toronto. Much better than Imanishi, which seems to be gaining in popularity for reasons that I don't understand."}
{"text":"I love their lunch menu; and their Makunochi bento is always my fave.  It's sumptuous and reasonably priced.  $19 includes ten small dishes of salad, veggie, fish, meat, tofu, pickles, rice and miso soup. Everything is in small servings which are beautifully presented in some stylish Japanese ceramic dishes and are nicely placed on a big tray.  The bento gives me surprises every time; coz what are in those dishes will change once in a while. The bento is limited to 10 each day though!  Tan Tan noodle is my next fave; the ramen is chewy and the spicy ground pork sauce is flavorful.  The bowl of ramen always arrives on the table sizzling hot with the bold aroma.  Their pork cutlet is in thick cut; juicy and tender.  Great ambience, inexpensively priced lunch menu, a crew of attentive servers and a solid 5 star; still not convinced?!!"}
{"text":"Oh man, did I eat A TON here. It was my first time at Kingyo but I kept hearing from friends how great it was. First thing I gotta say is I love the decor of this place. It's classy yet casual and they've got real, operating pachinko machines set into the brick walls of the main dining area as decoration; so cool! Not only that but there are two more downstairs outside of the washrooms that I think you might actually be able to play!  Anyway, we ordered a whole bunch of items: tako (octopus) wasabi, stone bowl mushroom tofu, garlic tuna tataki w/ponzu jelly, hotate (scallop) carpaccio, red tuna and black tiger prawn avocado tartar and stone bowl seafood & uni (sea urchin) don, as well as the jewelery box off of their specials menu.  The tako wasabi was great. We ordered it raw (you can get it raw, cooked or half&half), and the wasabi has good punch but won't have you on the verge of tears like other tako wasabi I've tried. You can also get unlimited extra nori if you run out. The stone bowl mushroom tofu was one of my favourites. It's cubes of silken tofu coated in a gelatinous rice flour batter of some sort dropped in a sizzling hot stone bowl, garnished with sliced okra. They then pour a enoki & shitake reduction over it. Highly recommend it if you like tofu and/or mushrooms. Make sure you don't let it over-cook in the bowl though, as it will burn and get charred!  The garlic tuna tataki was also a dish I thoroughly enjoyed. The presentation is quite lovely with this dish; the ponzu sauce comes in a little bottle so you can pour as little or as much dressing as you like on your tuna. The tuna itself was lightly-seared on the outside and melted in my mouth. I'm a big fan of the ponzu jelly, too. The hotate carpaccio was probably my favourite dish of all. I've never tried raw scallop before, but it was so unique and amazing. The best way I can describe it is that it is mildly sweet and again, just melts in your mouth. They pick a perfect arrangement of flavours and textures in this dish to compliment the scallop. This is a must-order dish!  The tartar was also another great dish. You mix it yourself on the plate and it comes with garlic toast to eat it with. Probably the least-challenging flavour-wise out of everything I tried; would be a good intro dish for someone not used to Japanese flavours. My only complaint with this dish is that the toast to tartar ratio is very unbalanced and they do charge extra for more toast. The stone bowl uni don was a really special dish. The uni actually turns the rice orange after being mixed. It is delicious and flavourful, with all kind of goodies mixed in there (shrimp, scallop, kombu). If you like sea urchin, this is a really special dish. Don't miss it!  Finally, the jewelry box is a special item. A two tier-box with eight special mystery items for you to sample. The contents vary from day to day. The presentation is lovely. Of all the items our box included, my favourites were the taro balls, kurage (jellyfish), and tuna tartar. I love anything reminiscent of an omakase-like experience, so I'd definitely get this again in the future. I like being surprised!  My final verdict is that this place is amazing! I highly prefer it to other izakayas in the city that I've tried. It feels more authentically Japanese somehow, the dishes are more interesting and complex, and above all, it is more affordable! The service and ambience are great and it makes for an exciting dining experience. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"No.very fresh sashimi; toro only available as sushi.verboten pork belly. Tongue on stone a starvation portion. Attentive amateurish service .Attempts at ' creativity'directly proportional to loss of terrior or just foul up .Crowd younger mildly trendoid. I had fine company. Back to EmaTei. 2 Stars."}
{"text":"This restaurant may look unimpressive on the outside, but step inside and you'll soon find yourself checking out a variety of pinball machines and anime playing on a large projector behind the bars.  Like others say, the service is a bit slow, but very friendly. The quality of the food is very fresh and simply divine!  As a starter, we ordered a Sampler Jewel Box which is up to the chef on what he puts in. Our box consist of a sweet and tangy hamachi fillet, deep fried potato croquette, fried chicken, tomato salad, tofu, and some other things long forgotten. I did not find one thing that I didn't like and it is perfectly portioned for two people.  Our second appetizer is the fatty tuna and avocado. This dish is simply divine and the toro is so soft and decadent with a hint of sweetness. If you can imagine full fat cream sitting on the top of a milk bottle, that's how creamy it is. This appetizer is must try.  Our third appetizer is the stone grilled beef tongue and kobe beef. The kobe beef has the perfect proportion of silky fat and juicy beef. Any fresher beef than this and you'll have a dancing cow in your mouth. I've had beef of all kinds and the meat here is fresh as can be. The tongue is sliced almost paper thin and tasted like lean beef slices without the chewiness. The boyfriend and I took turns cooking our raw meat on the sizzling rock and had so much fun watching the meat curl around the stone. When the stone gets cold, we simply asked them to bring out another hot one.  Lastly, we ordered the uni don to split between two people. Although we've only ordered appetizers up to this point, we're already getting full. The uni don is beautifully presented and tastes as good as it looks. The rice bowl is a perfect harmony of umami and delicate fattiness, the uni is slightly bitter, slightly sweet, and slightly salty. Perfection.  In the end, we were both stuffed to the brim, but just had to get dessert to end our perfect meal. We ordered the matcha creme brulee with a scoop of green tea ice cream. Perhaps the other dishes were so delicate that our palates had not yet adjust to the shockingly sweet dessert, but it was average in our opinion and certainly cannot compare to anything else we've tried.   At the end, the total cost less than $120 for two people. They gave us frozen grapes as dessert and we left the restaurant floating on seafood clouds. Ahh...."}
{"text":"We came here because we saw a picture of the lunch special bento box. We ordered the bento box, steak don and beef carpaccio. The steak was perfect cooked to medium rare. Super tender and tasty!!! I loved the bento box because of its variety, all of the 9 dishes are great. On top of that AMAZING SERVICE !!!!! Definitely coming here again."}
{"text":"I'll start with the good: the food. Four of us split the chef's appetizer--tofu, spicy pickled cucumber and tofu, the ox tongue  on hot stone, salmon carpaccio, death chicken and yellowtail cheek.   The food was all delicious. The yellowtail cheek was by far our favorite. I also really enjoyed the death chicken--don't be deterred by the portents of spicy doom on the menu. We all found the sauce to be quite flavorful and not overtly spicy. The ox tongue was OK, we had to get a second hot stone for cooking and it was kind of difficult to balance the meat on it. The salmon carpaccio was also delicious.   Cocktail wise we tried a variety of the fresh ginger cocktails and they were all refreshing.   Now onto the reason for the 3 star review. The service. We had a reservation at 8pm. Two of us arrived a few minutes early but our table was ready so we were seated immediately. When we got there, it was sweltering in the dining room --something I mention only because it was busy and I really wanted a glass of water. When the rest of our party arrived, no one came to our table to give them menus. We ended up sharing ours and had to flag down a server to get water. Our server arrived and we still needed a few minutes to decide. About ten minutes later, we had to flag down another server to order drinks.   Mid-way through our meal, we ordered another round of drinks. Apparently we made the mistake of asking for the \"ginger whiskey highball\", a drink we'd already ordered. When a server came back with a completely different drink we were confused but decided since it was so difficult to get the order in the first place we'd roll it. One of our members asked to get the original drink and the server informed us that we had ordered incorrectly. Apparently, our phrasing ordered us regular highballs (which of course are more) instead of the \"fresh ginger\" highball--which we had already had a round of. Look, I get it. It's busy, etc, whatever. Just spare me the indignity of pushing back over a DRINK ORDER when we didn't use the exact wording on the menu. We at least didn't get charged for it.   We had originally been open to trying more food but at that point decided to settle up and move on. It then took FOREVER to get our bill. We were there for about two hours, 30 minutes of which were spent actually eating food.   Food was outstanding but our service was a solid \"meh\"."}
{"text":"I was impressed with this izakaya, from the food to the decor. Try their grilled beef tongue, you will be given a hot stone to grill the thinly sliced tongue on it. Also, if you're interested, the pachinko machines in the basement of the restaurant can be played."}
{"text":"Reserved a table for my birthday - a thing to note (for a party of 10+ they ask you to spend a minimum amount, for me a party of 15 a minimum of $350)  Food - I've been to multiple Izakayas in the past and this has been one of the best ones with a good selection!  - calamari was buttery but flavourful  - poke was also very delicious  - the avocado tuna tar tar was a little bland (not pictured) - the spicy salmon sushi was very fresh and not overwhelming with all the toppings (My friends who had the meat tapas also really enjoyed their dishes)  Environment - our table had fish swimming it (it's kind of cruel but I guess was meant to fit the aesthetic of getting the 'bigger' table) -- other than that it was dim lit but made to match the intimate atmosphere of sharing food and hanging out with friends  Overall, a little pricier than regular izakayas but worth trying!"}
{"text":"Service was absolutely wonderful. They constantly changed our plates and our water glasses were always topped up. The servers were extremely gracious and knew the menu very well. Very impressed with the service :)  The TAKOWASABI ($4.20) was a delight for the eyes and for the stomach. The presentation was on point and I almost didn't want to eat it! We went half and half (you get the choice of raw/cooked/half and half). The presentation was so extravagant for just takowasabi!  We didn't hear too many good things about Kingyo's fresh fish but decided to give it a shot anyways. We ordered the MAGURO CARPACCIO ($11.20) and were pleasantly surprised by the size of the dish. Thinly sliced ahi-tuna carpaccio were placed on a bed of spring mix, avocado, radish sprouts, daikon radish, onions &amp; topped with crispy garlic chips and their house dressing. While it was great that there were so many ingredients, this can also be a pitfall as you lose the delicate tuna flavour amongst all the other ingredients. Still a refreshing started and we really can't complain about the size of it!  KARAAGE has always been a must-order for us as we love our fried chicken. Kingyo's famous deep fried chicken karaage from \"O-Sho restaurant\" in Japan was served with a magic powder (a sansho pepper blend) and a small lemon wedge. The portion was quite generous with large, moist pieces of crispy fried chicken. The chicken was delicious on its own and the magic powder was not necessarily needed.  We were hoping to order uni shooters when we went but they didn't have any on their special menu :(  The STONE GRILLED BEEF TONGUE ($10.20) was an incredibly fun dish. Thin slices of raw beef were placed in front of us along with a sizzling stone. You cooked the meat yourself on the stone for about 1 minute or so before dipping it into one of the sauces provided. Just a note, the stone loses its heat after while and they will replace it for you.  J didn't particularly like the KIMCHI UDON ($8.80) as it was too creamy but I really enjoyed it. We both agreed it could have used a LOT more kimchi though especially when that's the name of the udon!  The GOMA RAMEN SALAD WITH SPICY COD ROE ($7.80) had a combination of BBQ pork, cucumbers, marinated sea kelp and spicy cod roe. It was tossed in a tangy house sesame dressing. Cold ramen done right! The sesame dressing was addicting and this was a really refreshing dish  We ended off the meal with their 2 COLOUR ALMOND TOFU ($5.80). A small Jasmine jello layer at the top and a layer of berry sauce in the middle of an almond tofu. We made the regrettable mistake of only getting one almond tofu - get two, you won't want to share.  The food and presentation were amazing at Kingyo. You're definitely paying a premium, in comparison to other izakayas but it is worth your money."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing Japanese izakaya style restaurant. I visited during lunch hours on a Sunday and the quality of ingredients, execution, and service all deserve five stars. Would definitely recommend their sashimi (sweet shrimp and sea urchin) and their lunch sets. I ordered the pork cutlet set and was offered refill on my soup and my cabbage salad. The rice that accompanies each set is also high quality and lives up to the Japanese standard.   Will definitely go back during dinner service for some of their more unique dishes."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I arrived on a Friday evening - having made a reservation for 7:15 previously. When we arrived, I thought, perhaps I was being overcautious since there were tables available and it didn't look too crowded. But not more than 10-15 minutes after we sat, I realized that the place was filling up (and quickly)!  Food:  - Tako Wasabi  - Stone Grilled Beef Tongue  - Hamachi Carpaccio  - Stone Bowl Seafood Sea Urchin Don  - Aburi Toro & Avocado 2Tone Battera  - Otona No Pudding  To drink, we shared a bottle of sake - the Kaze Mizu Hitoyo.  Our food arrived very quickly (almost overwhelmingly). The food was delicious, and our favourites were the definitely the Tako Wasabi and the Sea Urchin Stone Bowl. Both were full of flavour and executed well.   Atmosphere: We were seated at a communal table in the company of other pairs - that included a small fish pond embedded in the center. Besides this table, there was bar seating and individual tables too. The volume was lively but not too.  I would definitely come back to try the other dishes. At the end of the meal,with our bill came a pair of frozen grapes on skewers. She also mentioned that they are updating their menu, adding more specials - and invited us to come and try them in the future and try more food."}
{"text":"The walls are lined with Pachinko machines.     They flash with reckless abandon as the sounds, smells and sights of modern Japan flicker about.  Service wasn't the fastest, but this ended up being rewarded in the quality of all the dishes that we were served.     As far as we could tell, there's only one sushi chef so this became the determinant variable in the overall timing of our meal.  Izakaya is always cool, and Kingyo doesn't need to rely on the tried-and-true trick of yelling obscenities at their customers upon entry in order to be awesome."}
{"text":"3.5/5, +.5 for service  Take this at face value: I prefer Kingyo over Guu/Kinka overall. I love the energetic atmosphere that Guu has, but in terms of food quality I liked Kingyo over Guu.  There seemed to be a heavy Power Rangers theme in Kingyo, and it showed via many of the decorations, in addition to an actual Power Rangers clip behind the sushi chefs' table. Even the washrooms in the basement had some Power Rangers decorations, in addition to very traditional Japanese music.  Anyway, on to the food...my family ordered tako wasabi, garlic tuna tataki and ponzu jelly, Kingyo legendary chicken wings, stone grilled kobe beef, grilled black cod, aburi toro, aburi shime saba, and frozen matcha creme brulée.  Personally I enjoyed almost every one of these foods in different ways! The tako wasabi was unique, as you're given both a raw and cooked option (or both). I went with a mix option, as I've never had cooked tako wasabi before. It honestly tastes just as good! The garlic tuna tataki was seared nicely and the ponzu jelly had a very unique taste to it. The chicken wings were also juicy and delicious, and I can definitely see where the \"legendary\" aspect came from. The stone grilled kobe beef wins for uniqueness; you're literally grilling beef on a stone! The black cod was also very good (why is that not in the everyday menu?) and the frozen matcha creme brulée was one of the best I've had in an izakaya joint.  This leaves behind the aburi toro and aburi shime saba...I liked the aburi toro, however the rice fell apart too easily for my liking. Considering that was the most expensive dish of my meal, I had to dock some marks off. Finally, the aburi shime saba was too fishy for my liking, and I didn't notice anywhere where the mackerel was torched.  Service was great; the servers were very knowledgeable about their products and consistently made sure we had enough water and the fact all our food has arrived.  Overall I definitely enjoyed my visit, considering it was my birthday dinner. I like how there are other izakaya restaurants in Toronto that I can choose aside from Guu, and this place definitely is up there in my favourite izakaya places I've visited in the city!"}
{"text":"A rare 5 star for me. I think this is really a hidden gem with a feel of actual Japan. Most Japanese places these days are effectively fast food sushi, and while good they lack authenticity. This place is different. It has a wide range of options that you'd find in Japan, and some very unique dishes. They even great you with Ishamaese.  The staff is very Japanese and the mild struggle with English makes it that much more fun. We had the octopus ceviche on with dried seaweed papers, tomato Kimuchi, and Tuna avocado tartar. All fun and tasty. For mains we had a short rib special which was very good and a surprisingly delicious vegan tempura salad. We topped it off with a cold house Sake. Nestled in Cabbagetown on Winchester just east of Parliament make sure you make a reservation and get their early if driving to find parking.  It's worth trying."}
{"text":"Possibly new favorite Izakaya!  The plus is that they do reservations and they have lots of tables to accommodate large groups. I didn't think they would fill up but they were busy when we got there at 8pm. You can put your name down on a wait list but they will not call you to alert you your table is ready, so you have to go back after a certain time to claim your table. We came back after 9pm and the place has opened up a bit, and they have a happy hour menu with discounted drinks, but not food. Even though it's on the happy hour menu it's the same price as listed in the everyday menu.   Our tuna carpaccio came and it was very unique and tasty. A lot of different flavors and texture. However, we probably waited 20-30 min for our next dish, which was a bit annoying. The tempura salad, again, is unique and flavorful. The duck breast special was good but not fantastic.   Will definitely come back soon!"}
{"text":"Had a nice dinner here for a friend's birthday on Saturday night. It gets crowded so reservations are a must. The menu is extensive with a lot of unique dishes to Kingyo. Unlike other izakayas found in Toronto, it's not too loud so you can actually carry on a conversation without having to lose your voice. I was impressed with the drink menu as they offered a lot of interesting cocktails - my favourite would have to be the yuzu mojito. I took photos of some of the items that we ordered; since it's all tapas here, there are too many items to list, but a couple of items that I would recommend are the steak on a hot stone (very cool looking), chicken wings, and the pork rice bowl. I would skip the tomato+kimuchi dish as it was super bland (in spite of the kimuchi). Anyway, can't wait to come back during their lunch hour.  Good for: groups, Japanese, tapas, drinks"}
{"text":"Kingyo is one of my all time favorite izakayas in Toronto. You can make reservations online, and there is usually a decent sized crowd chilling inside the restaurant ranging from classy-looking students to families. While it's tucked away in a weird part of Cabbagetown, that just makes it a cool place that always has availabilities for walk-ins!   It's really pretty, and they always have some sort of Japanese movie being screened at the bar area. The drinks are delicious and aesthetically pleasing, and the menu has a wide selection to choose from. I love how fresh their sushi is and there is never a long wait for your food.   The washroom downstairs has cool-looking (nonfunctional) arcade games, which they also have upstairs as decor. Finally, the desserts are super cute and they change up the selections from time to time. The price is a bit more expensive than a normal restaurant but it's a very lovely semi-formal dining experience that caters to a variety of events. I come here frequently and I will definitely continue to munch my way through the menu!  Favorites: garlic tuna tataki, tuna battera, frozen matcha creme brulee"}
{"text":"Their yummy Tonkatsu needs no intro. It's good but what's lessen known is their miso soup! It's incredible! It's made with vegetable instead of just plain miso and water at most places!"}
{"text":"Lots of interesting dishes here! My friend and I shared the brussels sprouts, daikon radish and tempura salad, avocado/tuna tartare, salad rolls, and one of the specials, karaage chicken tacos. Brussels sprouts were great, almost candied with bacon. Tempura salad was good, dish used a unique kind of tempura - lots of veggies fried into a brick, rather than stand-alone pieces of vegetables. Spring rolls were good, although the tacos and tartare were just okay. Overall we were happy with the dishes and the portions.  Unfortunately the service could have been better, it wasn't busy when we were there (a Wednesday night) but still seemed like we had to wave the servers down to make our order and to get the bill. I also didn't love the decorations on the walls, which were flashing neon lights, making it hard to concentrate on having a conversation. Overall a good dinner and I'd go back if I'm in the area - but not if I was in a hurry, and not if I had to sit in the area with the flashing neon!"}
{"text":"Poorly ventilated.  Upper scale price range.  I noticed differential treatment between Japanese and  non Japanese,  and  I belong to the latter group. Their menu changes from time to time.  There were a few items listed on their menu that they didn't have that day,  I commented on that but the server took it personally.  Found that weird.  Ingredients were fresh,  and taste was good.  Food was great.  Seniors should use caution when walking as the hardwood floor is slippery, probably caused by kitchen air from the poor ventilation.  Bathrooms are downstairs, nicely stocked up with personal essentials.  Wreaked of marijuana tho."}
{"text":"As much as I enjoy Izakaya dining experiences, I'm not thoroughly impressed with Kingyo. I really don't understand the hype behind this place. Perhaps this place is very spacious compared to other izakaya venues, which provides sufficient personal space without having to bump shoulders with strangers while dining. In fact, this place is about twice the size of Guu and probably triple of Nome. However, the tightness in space is more authentic in izakaya experience. That being said, the venue size didn't really make much of impression on my overall rating of this venue. I came to this place with my company for a holiday dinner. We pretty much ordered everything off the menu. Having tasted most if not all items, I have yet to find a particular dish that impressed me. There was NOTHING on the menu that I was dying to have a second bite or make a second order. I think the failure was caused by their attempt to fusionize Japanese bar food with South Eastern Asia spices and with western styled cooking. It's just a bit all over the place."}
{"text":"This is a very strong contender to be one of the best Izakaya places in Toronto.   To start with, the decor is just so fun, somewhat quirky and has a huge dinning room. I really like the video poker machines all around the dinning room and washrooms. There's a very big table to accommodate a large group.  As for the food, very happy with what we had.  We had Hamachi fillet, squid with wasabi, seared beef with plum dressing and beef tataki.   We chose to go with the house sake that was served at the perfect temperature.   The service was good and efficient. All the waitresses were very pleasant."}
{"text":"Aiming to avoid the long wait times at Guu, my girlfriend and I went to try Kingyo down the street from my place.  We both heard good things about Kingyo from different friends that have gone.  The wait without a reservation was only 15 minutes and the hostess was friendly.  The environment was loud even though the wooden benches were spread-out throughout the restaurant.    The fresh ginger cocktails and gin-based cocktails were definitely my style.  As we looked at the exotic menu, we found it difficult to make food choices but were fascinated to see the dishes for other tables come out in very fancy plating.  I found the food itself to be extremely disappointing in taste however.  We had a recommended torro and avocado sushi roll, soft-shell crab salad and the chicken wings.  The soft-shell crab and chicken wings were way too salty.  The roll was bland and didn't satisfy.  Where Kingyo did set a high bar was the women's washroom.  The washroom kept a consistent wooden theme as the restaurant itself and the best part of the washroom (other restaurant owners should take note here) is that they provided little toiletry items such as mouth-wash, feminine pads, cotton pads, nail filers and bobby pins.  In my opinion, every female washroom should have these essentials!  I re-pinned my hair that had been annoying me all night and we set off with me in a little bit of a better mood."}
{"text":"Cute little place in the most unexpected neighbourhood.  Decor was very well thought out.  The retro and vintage design was all very fun.   This is my first time here after seeing a myriad of my friends posting lovely photos of the food many months ago.   I should have came earlier because I didn't know I was missing this much greatness.     This is a slightly more civilized place than Guu.   Personally, I don't care for Guu that much.   I think I like Kingyo more because this Izakaya can essentially be a family friendly place to dine at.  (Less noise and much roomier).  Service was impeccable!   Foods were all Japanese fusion of some sort.   Don't expect to come here looking for traditional Japanese sushi cuisine.   It's funky and quirky at times.   All in all, I think Kingyo just wanted us to have a little break from the stresses of city life and come in to have a little fun-ness in their humble abode.     They seated us at the bar and unexpectedly, I was so glad they did.  Normally, I would detest to that idea.   But having cute little toy games to play and a large projector screen playing the Japanese version of \"Godzilla\" in front of me wasn't too shabby at all.  Nope!  Not one bit.     Now onto the food.  It was good, but really, they have a complicated menu, where I couldn't remember the names.   Heck,  when I got there, I opened up yelp and ordered off of the yelper's photos.   Dishes were beautifully presented, a little pricey for some, but well worth it because everything was super fresh.    I think if I come back for two again here,  I'll definitely sit at the bar!  Giving this place a perfect 5 because there was absolutely nothing bad to say about it.  When we left, the waitress walked us out to the door until we got into our car.  Lolz...  A little exaggerated, but yes, she opened the door for us, looked out, and waved like crazy with a huge smile saying, \"thank you and good bye.\" How sweet!   Haha..."}
{"text":"This was my first time - I think typically you would need to make reservations, but it was rainy so we got a table immediately :)  Great service! Food was fantastic. We had the warm sake which was delicious. It is A la carte, and each plate was beautifully presented and tasted wonderful. I repeat: service was exceptional."}
{"text":"We have had a number of fun family birthday dinners at Guu.  It IS super noisy which makes dinner with children and toddlers less stressful.  The servers are all very friendly and attentive - the shouting is part of the izakaya experience we've found, but if you can't handle the noise I would avoid.  We enjoy the food.  Kids love the chicken wings and exotic fruit drinks.  The unravelling tea is fun.  Decor is fun.  The godzilla film playing above the bar and video games on the wall are intriguing for kids of all ages.  Recommend reservations."}
{"text":"It was a great dinner! There were 12 of us and we were glad we had a reservation. I have to say the service was amazing! They split us up to 2 small groups and we can order separately (I would be really impractical if we wanna share for 12 ppl). The food here was really excellent as well and I had the best taco wasabi ever!!   It's a great place for friends to hang out!  You can come and check the food photos in my blog (alo it's in Mandarin): http://lizzieh.pixnet.net/blog/post/296173007"}
{"text":"As a group of 5, we came on Sunday evening right when the restaurant opened at 5 30pm. We should have made reservations as this place usually require reservations, but we got lucky and hot seated quickly.  We ordered three rounds of food and two rounds of drinks. Even though the seating limit was 2.5 hours but we stayed for 3 hours. No rush in kicking us out though at a time the restaurant must have being full!  We agreed our favourites are tomato kimchi and the two sashimi platter!"}
{"text":"There are better options for Japanese food in the city. I really wanted to like this place as it has been on my list for a long time & suggested to me by my friends who love this place. Maybe I went on an off day but the quality of fish was not worth the price.    We got the 3 type sashimi for $17 and upgraded to uni +$2. I'm not a big fan of hotate but the hamachi wasn't very fresh. The uni was also discoloured and some were not sweet at all but quite bitter.   We also had the avocado hamachi tatare. It was very lacking in flavour and there was barely any fish. The butter bread made the dish overly oily as it was so full with avocado as it was. This dish was very lazy.   We were also able to enjoy the $1 oyster (happy hour everyday). The ponzu, spring onion & grated radish worked surprisingly well.   Our group all had the kaisen don as our main. I did not feel like it was worth it at all. We had a few slices of marinated fish in each dish. The cuts were not to par, and I had so much rice left over as there was so little fish.   I did enjoy the fresh wasabi here but overall I would not come back unless there was major changes to the menu."}
{"text":"If you've read my previous reviews or know me personally, you'll know that I love izakayas and sake. I came with a group of friends to celebrate a friend's birthday. Being seated at a ginormous and elaborate table with a goldfish tank inlaid to the table built my expectations of what was to come.   Slabs of marbled meat on lava stones, displays of vibrantly fresh raw seafood, sizzling stone pots of rice and deeply savoury ingredients, Kingyo was an experience vivid with flavours of briney, fresh, umami and all the deliciousness I could ever want from an izakaya. And my gosh, the uni. UNI FOR DAYS. So delicious.   In a fervent hunger for this deliciousness to continue, me and my friend got carried away and over-ordered. But it was worth it. The sake, the uni, the sashimi, the sake again, another wow-factor dish like wagyu on a sizzling stone appears and disappears. It was a delightful blur of indulgence. The only small burr in our night was the noodles. To be fair I can't tell if at that point we were so stuffed we couldn't fully appreciate it, or if it was really something so simplistic or unremarkable that we regret ordering. Yes it was one of those nights. Kingyo isn't even AYCE. Yeah I'll be back."}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants in Toronto! Have been here at least 10x, and continue to go at least monthly.   Delicious food, well sized portions and good service. My go-to dishes are the tako wasabi, mushroom/tofu bowl, hamachi carpaccio, and Saba sushi. Every one is a hit!   One thing, they are not stroller friendly and they do not have high chairs. Although every time I've gone, we've been the only table with a baby, so probably not a place many people with babies go to."}
{"text":"Ordered at 9:15 and dishes started coming out in an hour, even for the most basic dishes. Drinks took about 30 minutes to come out. Ordered short ribs at 9:15 and they came out at 11:15. Right before the store closes. Never again and don't recommend."}
{"text":"2.5 stars rounding up to a 3..   Overall, food was great and they try to provide good service.. but we didn't get good service this time...  They screwed up our service on many occasions! From not properly seating us to a correct size table (we had rsvp), to taking 20 minutes to serve our first pitcher of beer, to not plating the correct Sashimi items as ordered, and they also questioned our requested for extra utensils 3 times? When we ask for a 4 extra forks - why do you have to ask us 3 times and what makes you think we will change our minds - dumb waitress...  I would only choose to come back here for a dinner date 1 on 1, probably never come back as a group..  Bill was $80 per person as expected..  Some really good things to try: -Jumbo Shrimp Sashimi - really fresh and no tank water taste - Uni Rice in a Stone Bowl - one of the best I have had - Sashimi Shooter - really tasty and worth it for his restaurant's price range - Ox Tonge cooked on Stone - just cuz it looks great - Albacore Tuna Tataki - the garlic was the highlight of this dish - Fluke Sashimi - must try if you're a red snapper fan  Items which weren't so good: - Uni, small size, (Boston Uni) - Taco Wasabi  - Sashimi Platter - nothing special, but Kingyo pricing - Scallops Sashimi were small and previously frozen - Pork Belly Rice in a Stone Bowl - couldn't take any Pork Belly flavour - Chicken Karaage - we ordered both the spicy and non-spicy one.. spicy (death chicken) was actually sweet, not spicy, regular Karaage was flavourless and not juicy"}
{"text":"I love this place. The service was excellent.   Food is umami, decor was very izakaya. I would go here occasionally, great experience first time."}
{"text":"Wow! That's all, just wow. Ambience (whimsical, classy, rustic) service (like a warm hug) presentation (art) freshness (ziiiing!) flavour (more ziiiing!) I left feeling like I had the first perfect dining experience I've had in years. Pricier than your average Japanese restaurant, but not you average Japanese restaurant. Want gyoza or a Calidornia roll? Piss off."}
{"text":"I heard this place openned up from Vancouver. Izakayas that come from the west coast of Canada is always goood news! The food here was very well made. The portions are ginormous and we shared 2 meals between 3 girls and still had leftovers. The sauce and broth they use is incredible. The amount of meat they give you was so good, it was the perfection of crunchy and deep fried. I love that the proportion of food to rice is so perfect you have just enough and maybe a little more food to rice which makes it so good to eat. I also like that our waitress helped us out with what they would recommend us eating and they were very honest of how much we should be ordering."}
{"text":"Très sympa et très bon !! De la bonne cuisine japonaise dans un chouette restaurent comme je les aimes. La carte est varié et les plats ne sont pas très chère. En revanche, il faut commander des accompagnement avec les viandes et autre car les portions peuvent être petites et donc surprendre ! Ou ce retrouver juste avec de la viande !!  Il faut aussi mieux savoir bien parler anglais car ils ne sont pas très indulgent..."}
{"text":"Pretty solid place for izakaya!  Good variety but I feel the fish is on the weaker side."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at a Japanese Izakaya restaurant and Kingyo was a great introduction to it. We ordered a bunch of food so here it goes one by one!  Drinks: I never really enjoy or drink alcoholic drinks but literally EVERY drink I tried here was amazing and I would order them all again. My favorites were the Yuzu gin tonic and the ice peach but the mango calpico cocktail was great too.  1. Yuzu gin tonic  2. Fresh ginger honey lemon cocktail 3. Mango calpico cocktail  4. Ice peach  5. White wine sangria   Food: The presentation was beautiful for every dish, especially for the Stone grilled beef tongue and the Tako wasabi.   1. Bone marrow 2. Grilled salmon and ikura don  3. Chicken karaage w/ magic powder - My favorite! Magic powder....uh yea...totally    magic.  4. Stone grilled beef tongue - A fun dish where you can cook the beef tongue on a hot rock.  5. Tako wasabi 6. Stone bowl pork kakuni don - I would order this all for myself next time.  7. 2 color almond tofu - Delish. I am the biggest almond lover and would absolutely also order this for myself next time.   Kingyo is large and spacious inside. It was hard to flag down the servers when you needed something but they were friendly when you managed to get them. I'm told Kingyo is a bit more expensive than other izakaya restaurants considering the smaller portions but I can't deny that the quality of food is terrific."}
{"text":"From the manager of GUU Vancouver - we get Kingyo.  Overall, he's done a great job with his restaurant and has once again, elevated the Izakaya experience. But he does fall short in a couple of areas.   1) They need to find a better source for their salmon. It's flavourless but very fresh.  2) They need to look at their pricing. Some dishes are severely over priced and others have wayy to much bang for your buck. At the end, you pay a pretty hefty bill which doesn't fully translate into the experience. 20% less would be more appropriate. Spending $70 on food alone isn't something i'd like to do at Kingyo again. And i was still a little hungry after.  3) Lack of patio and location - huge problem for the summer.  Overall, the service is out of this world. The little touches between courses is amazing. The dishes have really good flavours, and the freshness of all the dishes is welcomed."}
{"text":"Fun place to go for Japanese izakaya. Great for small or larger groups, friendly service. There was a great variety of food that's quite fresh, have a good selection of sake.  For a group of 4, with three bottles of sake, it was about 50$/person. Definitely order the green tea creme brulee"}
{"text":"I've been to Kingyo quite a few times now for lunch and dinner and I have to say their lunches are much better than dinner. Their portions are decently sized for downtown portions but more importantly delicious! The restaurant is well furnished and has a great atmosphere for hanging out with a group of friends and family. The service staff are all really friendly and it's just a great time here. Highly recommended!  My favourite dish from Kingyo is the Fried Pork Cutlet. It's crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. It also comes with a bowl of rice, two small appetizers, miso soup and some lettuce. Words cannot really describe how good this is! This lunch costs about $15 and it's worth every little bit.  At the end, you'll get a frozen grape as dessert. It's a simple but sweet dessert and helps cleanse your palate at the end of the meal."}
{"text":"Was able to get a spot at Kingyo's relatively last minute and was sat down at 8:30. We got a spot at the communal table but we were the only ones there so it worked out. We ordered 4 things for the 2 of us. The deep fried brusselsprouts, deep fried seaweed calamari, spicy chopped tuna battera, and the stone bowl seafood sea urchin don. The brusselsprouts were better than expected although a bit oily. It is deep-fried after all. The calamari was nothing special. The spicy tuna battera was really good. The tuna had a good kick but not too spicy. The tempura bits added a crunch to the sushi and a healthy amount of green onions balanced it off nicely. And finally the seafood sea urchin don arrived and was mixed very well by the waitress. The don had a good amount of seafood but none of it really stood out when all mixed together. The uni was tasty but not overpowering the rest of the don. Overall a great experience with the service and food. Would recommend and come again."}
{"text":"I love Kingyo, I'm always satisfied when I come here and have yet to order something I don't like. A couple of staples I always order are, the sashimi salad, tako wasabi, hamachi cheek, ebi shrimp the green tea matcha dessert."}
{"text":"Went here last weekend. Overall the food was pretty good. We had some great meals. I had the soft shell crab salad and a pork and rice dish. Both were excellent. My one complaint would be that the service was very spotty. Slow service is ok for food but drinks and bussing of tables is another story. Great food. Service average. I won't rush back but I will go back eventually."}
{"text":"Kingyo is such a treat to have in our neighbourhood; the service is always really attentive and considerate and the food is always outstanding.   I tend to go to Kingyo with a group of ~5 people and always just order every single item off of the vegan menu (and often we double up on some items), some ginger ales and some edamame. Never a bad dish and never a bad time.  That being said, I can only personally speak to the dishes that don't have animal in them. My friends who eat animals, however tend to have the same feelings as I do towards their non-vegan dishes - including one guy that takes food pretty seriously. So I assume the greatness of all the dishes are pretty high.  The atmosphere is always nice - everyone is polite, even as their yelling at you and the kindness of everyone comes through as genuine and sincere.  I like this place."}
{"text":"wow it's like a level up from guu--in terms of variety and presentation. (however I feel guu's small selection of dishes are always delicious whereas here they're not quite as consistent.   however it was a great experience and a def must try for anyone who's a fan of izakaya style restaurants! :)   they also have amazing and fun servers, and very cool decor--some old school video game-looking things hanging around, and a couple machines for you to play with outside the washrooms!!   will definitely come back :)"}
{"text":"Kingyo is a gem tucked away in cabbagetown. If you walk quickly you might miss it. Those who do visit however, will be rewarded with an authentic and fun Japanese izakaya.  Food is great here, and I find prices to be ok for what it is. I would have given it 5 stars if it were situated closer to Yonge street, but then again, the prices would not be as good.  Do check out the washroom downstairs for the functional pachinko machines (yes you can play them!)"}
{"text":"Wow! The food at this place was amazing. I had the Shrimp Kimchi Marine, Stone Grilled Beef tongue, Grilled Tontoro Pork Cheek, Stone bowl Sea Urchin Don, and Burdock Kakiage and Shabu Shabu Udon. This was my first time cooking meat on a stone grill and the result was as good as I had hoped it would be! As the meat sizzles on the hot stone, cooking quite quickly, I had to seriously try not to wolf down everything and slow down and enjoy it slowly. The rest of the food we ordered were great as well, but I've got to say in the end the Sea Urchin Don surprised me the most. I'm usually not likely to order a sea urchin dish, due to past experiences of it tasting too fishy to me. On a whim I decided to share it with a friend and I was so surprised how yummy it tasted. Heat of the stone bowl and the rice cooks the sea urchin enough to mellow the fishy taste for me personally, and for me it was the perfect way to have sea urchin. In combination with the rest of the bowl, I think the sea urchin gives it almost cheesy taste overall. The server mixes the don in front of you so you  can see exactly what kinds of  goodies are in the Don. With every spoonful of the don the burst of fish roe gives the extra salty burst of  flavor that provides so much savory satisfaction. This interesting combination of flavors work so well together that I couldn't stop eating! The services was also top notch. They're always there to top up our water and take away finished dishes before we ask. Overall this was definitely one the best restaurant experiences I've ever had."}
{"text":"I love lunches that offer bento boxes-love trying a little bit of a lot of things. Kingyo in particular offers one really interesting dish called \"KINGYO's super famous delux Makuno-uchi\" bento (limited only 10 sets per day) for $17.  Here is a bit more about the restaurant.....  Kingyo is another Japanese restaurant that has made the move from Vancouver to Toronto, following the success of Guu, Guu Sakabar, Kinton, Hapa Izakaya and Ramen Raijin.  Koji Zenimaru, formerly head chef at the original Vancouver location, is joined by a team of former Kingyo and Guu staffers. The 120-seat room has plenty of goldfish paraphernalia (kingyo is goldfish in Japanese).  Well, what sold me on this restaurant is that they offer their lunch menu on weekends! And after reading many reviews, reviewers consistently noted that the lunch menu gives you more value for your buck.  The Good  The reservation process was very straightforward--can be done over e-mail Most dishes are under $20 - only items over $20 are the sashimi (3 Kind Assortment $22.00 & 5 Kind Assortment $35.00) They offer their lunch menu on weekends I love that on their website you can see an image of every dish  The Not So Good  Service was slow and staggered - I had to get my own water and had to refill it myself  The food - I ordered the Makuno-uchi bento box and I only liked 2 items out of 10. I don't even know what 75% of the items were. We asked our waitress for an explanation, and found her description of the items to be unclear. Also, although I knew that I would not be able to eat several of the items in the box (they had lots of onions), you are not allowed to substitute. Nevertheless, I was too curious about this box to go with something else. Thoughts?  I don't get the hype. The restaurant is clean, spacious, and the menu is extensive with reasonable prices. The food and service however did not cut it for me. I was starving when we left the restaurant because I did not like or could not eat some of the items in the box. And because the portions were so tiny, the items I did like, I did not get much of.  The friends that got the bento box with me agreed with me--food was not great and no value for money. Those that ordered something else from the menu were satisfied with their food. Not blown away, but it was acceptable. We all agreed however that Kingyo is not worth a second visit."}
{"text":"Food: 5/5 Ambiance: 5/5 Service: 3.5/5  First of all, the decor of the place is very nice. The place isn't noisy but has a good vibe. The place has very good selection of jazz music. On the other hand, the washroom has the traditional Japanese folk music which is pretty cool. There is a big screen showing Japanese movie/animation which brings me back a lot of childhood memories. There are game machines at the basement that you have to check them out!  I am very impressed with the quality and quantity of food. Lunch menu has a wide selections of set lunch and appetizers. My family and friends ordered five different sets. The portion is generous. We are all very happy with the dishes and they are tasty.   Our favourite ones are:  Sizzling grilled eel stone bowl- you can add the soup when it is half finished to make it another flavour.   Grilled two kinds of fish - fish is very fresh and well done.   Pork loin cutlet - it is served exactly the way in Tokyo. The pork loin is juicy and flavourful. The sauce is specially good with the mustard!!  Service is a slow. There is only one waitress serving is difficult given half of the dining hall is full. But I have to say that the serving lady is very polite and friendly. She always offers children cutlery without special request.   Tea is quite expensive. It serves fancy tea and seeing the tea leaves blossom is entertaining but it is too pricy and wish it offer a free refill.   I will definitely go back for lunch if I am in the area. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere Izakaya, food is decent, not too good or bad overall. Stay away from the sushi & sashimi, soggy from refreezing? Service was ok from some, less so from others. And the hostess that sat us was sub par; sat 4 of us at a table beside a busy server station, so we requested if we could sit somewhere else, she reluctantly pointed us to another area but ended up sitting us beside the only other server station even though there was a nicer, quiter spot right beside it. Totally oblivious to customer service, not sure if I am just getting older, crankier and more demanding or some people in the front lines of the service industry are in the wrong job!"}
{"text":"My first izakaya experience was at Guu and it wasn't a positive one.  I found a majority of their dishes to be over deep fried, greasy and salty.  So, I wasn't sure if I'd ever like izakaya again.  Enter Kingyo.  Last minute reservations were made easily online.  Met up for dinner with Daniel O. and his sister.  They arrived just before me and started the night off with a pitcher of Sapporo ($17).  I got a hearty Japanese welcome when I arrived (similar to Guu but that's probably where the similarities end).  Kingyo's dining room was spacious and relatively quiet, only a few tables where filled but these got snatched up as the evening progressed.  We were seated near the wall with all the potential seizure-causing video game machines.  We ordered:  - Spicy Soft Shell Crab Sui Choy Salad ($11.80) - Garlic Tuna Tataki & Ponzu Jelly ($8.20) - Ume Seaweed Hotate Carpaccio ($10.80) - Stone Grilled Beef Tongue ($10.20) - Famous \"O-Sho Restaurant\" Karaage with Magic Powder ($8.60) - The Legendary Chicken Wings by \"Kinchan\" ($8.20) - Pork Tantan Ramen ($8.20)  The dishes were all delicately prepared and beautifully presented especially the hotate carpaccio (scallops) and tuna tataki.    The karaage and chicken wings were both deep fried, but not greasy.  The soft shell crab salad was one of my favourites - tangy dressing with crunchy greens, could have used a bigger piece of crab though.    The grilled beef tongue was just okay, probably more novelty as you can grill it on a hot piece of stone that accompanies the dish.    We opted for a second pitcher of Sapporo rather than ordering dessert.  My faith has been renewed in izakaya cuisine.  I thoroughly enjoyed this meal and I'm itching to go back.  Any meal that ends with frozen grapes in a cute flower vase is okay by me."}
{"text":"I LOVE Kingyo and I highly recommend taking advantage of their Specials menu (limited time items). I've been there twice, most recently yesterday, and I like that the location is not in the centre of downtown because it doesn't overcrowd. So far, I haven't had to wait in line and I showed up with no reservations both times (Thursday and Sunday night).  These are the FAVOURITES/MUST-TRY'S:  - Miso ramen (\"Super Rich & Original Mixed Mild Miso Ramen): This is on their Specials menu and is seriously the BEST MISO RAMEN I've had in Toronto, and I've tried out a lot of ramen places. I can tell by looking at the broth they add extra seasoning which gives it its unique flavour. It's so good I'm still thinking about it! I hope they keep this on their menu! SO GOOD.  - Chicken karaage (\"Famous 'O-Sho Restaurant' Karaage with Magic Powder\"): Can't really go wrong with fried chicken but they really do it well here. Not only are the chicken pieces larger but adding their \"magic powder,\" which is a mixed pepper seasoning, makes the chicken taste THAT much better.   - Pork belly (\"Cream Buta Kakuni\"): This pork belly basically melts in your mouth. Enough said.  - Beef short rib (\"A Big Kingyo Short Rib\"): For $19 this item is quite pricey for an izakaya dish but well worth it! It's larger than most izakaya plates and has a unique BBQ blend sauce. A friend mentioned it was too garlicky for his taste but I love garlic so it was perfect for me.  Besides that, I've also had the Pork Tantan Ramen and a chocolate parfait from their Specials menu (no longer available). These were also good but not memorable (there's better spicy pork ramen at Sansotei).  They have a promo going right now where if you like/follow their social media and show proof to the waitress they'll give you a voucher for free dessert for your next visit.   Definitely coming back again!"}
{"text":"Kingyo came from the famed original spot in Vancouver.  The one in Vancouver is constantly on the top Japanese restaurants out west.  Seeing how I love izakayas, I had to try Kingyo and see how it was compared to my favourite Guu.  I would say Kingyo is far more bigger in size and capable of handling large tables without issues.  The space is clean but like most izakayas... dark and with very little lighting.  The use of tree stumps for table legs is cute touch as well as the Pachinko machine screens on the walls.  There is a large bar space so if you want to sit and watch the sushi chef make the food, there is ample space.  Service here is mostly good as they're quite a few of them but they're zooming EVERYWHERE.  To grab their attention might be a bit hard cause they're often running to somewhere else.  BUT they do clear your dishes the moment you're done... I've only seen sneaky speeds like this when a dog is trying to sneak bacon.  They do refill your tea often and I do appreciate that.  Also, they're more than happy to be help tell you the specials and best dishes on the large menu.  The menu was missing a few izakaya classic... gomaee, takoyaki, or okonomiyaki.  If anything, it had a few more sushi and sashimi offerings than other spots.  They do have the good karaage, grilled squid, and ebi mayo that is on most menus.  I would recommend to take a look at the specials menu... sometimes you'll spot something very unusual and grab it while you can.  Also they do have a phenomenal deal on oysters...  $12 for 6 or $24 for 12!    Sizzling Mekabu Agedashi Tofu - If you love mushrooms, savoury notes, or umami, this would be your dish.  This was just amazing... custard silken tofu are fried and lightly crisp.  Then a whole bowl of amazing mushrooms (shiitake, enoki, and shimeji) are braised and create this amazing sauce ... it's then poured on top of the tofu that sits in a stone bowl.  It's a bubbling bowl of goodness.  5/5  Karaage chicken - Chicken leg is used for this particular dish and it is pretty good.  Thick tender and generous pieces are coated and deep fried.  I found the coating to be thinner and not as crispy as Guu's.  It did come with 3 different salts... some are nuanced but it's still salt.  3.5/5  Fried Brussels Spouts and Bacon - They should call this dish Bacon and Spouts... honestly.  I think there was as much good crunchy bacon pieces as they were sprouts.  The flavour was really good with the sweet and salty soya sauce with a mild kick of heat from the spices.  It is definitely an oily dish so for those who don't like that... you might want to stay away.  But who can say no to bacon?? 4/5  Waygu steak cooked table side on hot stone - Novelty... absolutely.  Fun... oh yes.  Well priced for ridiculously fatty juicy meat... uh huh.  I was surprised that we got 8 pieces of Wagyu.  Easily around 4 ozs ... though it was not like the A5 kobe pieces, each piece was super tender and flavourful.  Just little great bites of fatty beef.  Warning... the stone does cool quickly so put on the fattiest and thickest piece immediately and keep cooking!.  4/5  Spicy chopped tuna battera - This was far better than it was described.  A nice bold spicy sauce is mixed in with tuna, green onions, avocado, spicy wasabi dressing, and topped with tobiko & tempura bits.  It had tender and crunchy parts.  Just really good.  It was also quite a large amount ... great size to share.  4.5/5  Matcha creme Brûlée - One of the favourites at Kingyo and I can see why.  It is a petite dessert that reminds you of matcha ice cream but a bit more creamier.  I also like how it has caramelized ice shards in it.  The addition of the cream and berry topping puts it over the top.  It was sweet but not overly sweet.  Just enough to satisfy a sweet tooth.  4/5  Overall, I do like Kingyo better than Kinka's.  I find Kingyo more about the atmosphere and food quality compared to Kinka's.  Its like the older family oriented brother to Kinka.  Guu is still my favourite izakaya with it's amazing tastes and dishes but Kingyo is deserving of love as well! Yes"}
{"text":"tried this place over the summer and was somewhat disappointed.   ^ that was a draft i never ended up finishing a year an a half ago (my first time there)   I came back today with my two best friends. We were told they were fully booked but when another couple came in they offered a spot but had to leave in an hour and half. When they refused it she came back to us and offered it... Why were we not offered it in the first place?   I found it very difficult to understand the servers. The food took very long to come out. At first it was consistent... But three of the dishes were missing and 2/3 came out 40 minutes after the first 3 came out....   The server came back 40 mins later telling us that they ran out of rice... I doubt it. How do you run out when dinner rush is about to hit you in the face... lol   It's probably because they forgot or they wanted us to finish up our food and be out before the next party arrived.   Overall my experience is still not the best here trying it the second time..   Food is good. Small portions tho   Service is slow and needs improvement  Also thanks for only giving us one menu for three people. way to go"}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I came here but first time coming here for lunch on the weekend.   Kingyo Assorted Deluxe Bento ($19) Gotta love this cute and delicate 9 dish bento set. Comes with unlimited miso soup and rice. Their miso soup is actually different than normal miso soup - has quite a lot of other ingredients inside like lotus and some other veggies. The 9 dishes from top row left to right, fried taro balls, japanese hamburg, tofu, japanese egg, shrimp tempura, black cod, braised pork belly, green onions, and chicken karaage. All dishes tasted really good. What stood out to me was the taro ball - the other layer was sticky chewy like mochi, but the inside filling was nice and soft. The black cod was really tender, but not the melt in your mouth kind. It doesnt look like a lot but it's actually quite filling.  Beef cutlet ($19) Similar to their pork tonkatsu cutlet, but this was beef steak instead. Comes with unlimited miso soup, rice and cabbage. What caught my attention was in the menu they mentioned the steak would be served medium. Most pieces were, but there were some pieces that were more on the done side. I do have to say the portion was a lot smaller than the pork tonkatsu. The breading was nice and crispy, it didn't taste greasy at all.   Food was good but quite expensive, and service was slow. We waited probably more than 30 mins for our lunch to be served and the restaurant wasn't even too busy."}
{"text":"Went there for the $1 oysters. Normally you'll be expecting bad quality ones for such a cheap price, and not much sauce to pick from. But they have four sauces, each one of them is quality made, my personal favorite is their ponzu sauce, can't be found in many places and it tastes like Japanese chips. Their oysters are not the skinny \"meat-less\" type of oysters, but fatty ones. I'm quite surprised when I see them. Well worth the price paying. Will consider going back again for their oysters for sure."}
{"text":"The food was really good but the service was really slow. If it wasn't for the service I would have given it four stars. We were a group of ten on a Wednesday night at 8 pm.  I started the night with a pomegranate mojito. It was a great summer drink. They had a beer special after 9 pm where the first Sapporo was $4.50 and then the second was $4 and the third was $3.50. So cheap! My brother and I shared the  karaage, tuna avocado tartare, beef tongue and the spare ribs.  The chicken was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. I liked that it came with salt so that you can put as much as you want on it. The avocado tuna tartare was really yummy and it came with garlic bread but there was not enough tuna in my opinion. The beef tongue was fun because it came raw and you had to cook it on a black rock. It came with garlic oil and a chili paste. The spare ribs were on the special menu and it was the best dish of the night. The plate was huge. It wasn't too sweet at all and the meat fell off the bone."}
{"text":"Excellent tuna tataki, fried chicken with house \"death\" sauce, bento box is OK (nothing special)... next time I'll have the tongue or beef on hot stone!  (not five this time as the A/C was down, so it was pretty hot inside and no free drinks or discount...we'll see next time)"}
{"text":"I had sashimi lunch and was not impressed. First thing first, the quality of sashimi was not good at all. It wasn't fresh. I suspect it was previously frozen. I might have been served some leftover. Downtown sushi take-out places serve better quality, shame on you, Kingyo!  The servers failed to make eye contacts, didn't say anything more than yes or no, except a girl who answered my questions regarding the menu. No one came to check how things were during the meal (suspicious). After riding the bike entire morning along the Don River, I was not so eager to complain, but here is my review.   The miso soup was very good (2 stars for that) and the ambiance was interesting. Food was beautifully presented. I'm sure they can do way better than this. However they cannot claim to be an upscale Japanese food restaurant if they serve this surprisingly low-in-quality sashimi. Not in my book."}
{"text":"Kingyo has dropped a notch or two since I dined here last a few months ago.  From the loud rock music, to an item that was ordered but never arrived, to a slight drop in presentation, Kingyo is not quite what it was. Oh yes, the lunch menu is gone which means everything is more expensive.  Still ok but not a lot to separate it from the competition anymore."}
{"text":"My friends and I came to Kingyo to celebrate a friend's birthday. As odd as it may sound coming from someone who has yet to visit Japan, it can only be described as the most authentic izakaya experience I've had thus far. At least, authentic with respect to my romanticization, imagination, and social media-driven impression of what it should be. From the heated stones to grill the wagyu and beef tongues, the overt and unadulterated freshness of the seafood, the thought put into composition of these vibrant dishes, the tasty synergy to the sake, to the live goldfish aquarium in the middle of our table; Kingyo has been the most memorable izakaya experience up to the time of this writing.  The two highlights I'd like to bring forth include the stone bowl uni don and the kaisen don. The briney and creaminess that is uni with the scallions and the vegetal crisp texture of nagaimo fit perfectly with the piping hot rice. Just sampling once from my friend's bowl prompted me to get my own to devour, despite the party having moved on to the birthday cake. The kaisen don I was barely able to restrain myself long enough to snap a shot. Beautifully put together and very fresh.  Every course, plate, and bowl that arrived initiated a sort of ritual. To savour slowly to extend the bliss as much as possible, take some sips of sake which in turn lead to more anticipation for the next bite. I definitely would like to come back for the noodles, lunch specials, and other limited/special menu offerings. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Excellent value Izakaya! Food was tasty and very reasonably priced. Service was great and enjoyed the atmosphere. Food was delicious, but variety wasn't the same at similar Izakaya places."}
{"text":"Kingyo had been on my radar for sometime, and I finally made it here for dinner. We'd made same-day reservations and got an 8:15 slot. Arrived 15 minutes early but they were able to accommodate us right away, which was always a plus. Service was excellent, albeit on the slightly slower side towards the end. Understandable, as it was a Saturday night. I call it the Japanese hospitality, polite and efficient.  Between my boyfriend and I, we had:  Mabo sticky rice - this was one of their daily specials and admittedly, I did not pay enough attention to the description. The mabo sauce was savoury and flavourful, but I wasn't too keen on the deep fried mochi (sticky rice?).  Hamachi Carpaccio - fan favourite. Everything worked well together, and I especially liked the tanginess of their house sauce.   Stone Grilled Beef Tongue - need I say more?   Stone Bowl Seafood and Sea Urchin don - I am a big fan of anything cooked in hot stones, especially love the crunchy rice you scrape off the bottom of the bowl.. mmm.. however I find this dish too rich after a while. I suspect it's the Uni? The diced pieces of daikon also threw me off texturally.   We had some beers as well, decently priced. Lastly, we finished with some desserts. It's worth mentioning that they do half-sizes, which I absolutely appreciate. I like variety, and normally can't eat a lot of sweets. We got the black sesame ice cream, and Otona no pudding which reminded me of crème brûlée.  Overall, I had a good experience at Kingyo. Food is tasty and reasonable priced; it is a little on the noisy side, as commonly found in Japanese establishments with seats closely placed together and servers shouting their welcome and goodbyes."}
{"text":"My favourite izakaya in the city hands down. This is one of my go to places when I want to prove that Toronto has a great food scene. I have gotten most if the food on the menu, and it is all good.   10/10 don't even need to write anything more. But some must haves are the stone pot rice with uni and the beef tongue on the hot stone. Like no matter what else u order, make sure you also get those."}
{"text":"My favorite japanese restaurant at all time!  Their lunch set are so good and cheap!  My favorite is negitoro (avocado, minced tuna and japanese paste on rice bowl).  They have also got the best miso soup in the world!  So much ingredient inside with unlimited refill!"}
{"text":"BOTTOM LINE: Chef Tsuyoshi Yoshinaga (of Kaji Sushi) elevates the Toronto izakaya scene to more than just bar food. The dishes are more intricately prepared but comes at a small premium.  I'm a fan of the Vancouver location and wanted to see how this place stacked up. We sat by the bar and unexpectedly recognized chef Yoshinaga as the sous chef from Kaji (he's the one with the ridiculously big smile...and the stylin' undercut and permed faux-hawk!)! We knew we were in for a treat and he didn't disappoint! The place is also bigger than most of the other izakayas in town, so hopefully there won't be ridiculous lines.  Kingyo is an izakaya in a loose sense but their dishes seem catered towards more high end offerings - the quality and presentation is clear from each of the dishes we ordered, undoubtedly inspired by Kaji.  The highlight of the night was easily the ABURI TORO & AVOCADO 2TONE BATTERA with its flame seared tuna boxed on top of layers of rice and avocado. It tasted amazing! The TAKO WASABI came with a lot of pieces of nori and had a good kick to it. I'd probably avoid the STONE BOWL MUSHROOM TOFU because it was rather plain (4 deep fried tofu with some sauce and enoki mushrooms) for $8. We ordered the staple FAMOUS \"O-SHO RESTAURANT\" KARAAGE WITH MAGIC POWDER - these deep friend chicken balls were ginormous and sublime! And finally, we ordered their PORK TANTAN RAMEN for $11, which had thicker and springy-er noodles (like the Chinese \"dam dam\" noodles) than the ramen shops around town, delicious spicy broth, but they skimped on the pork. We paired our dishes with BROWN TEA, which is excellent for sharing because they'll keep refilling your french press with hot water, and their FRESH GINGER HIGH BALL cocktail from their homemade ginger ale - tasty and sweet, but I couldn't taste the booze.  Their menu is huge and having had a front row seat of the preparation, it would appear that each dish, from those involving oysters, sashimi to even vegan dishes looked quite impressive. I'm definitely looking to coming back for more!  PS - As an aside...finally, a menu that is NOT in PDF format! I encourage all resto websites to recognize the post-Y2K world we live in."}
{"text":"Kingyo never disappoints whether you are in Vancouver or Toronto.  Their pressed mackerel is my favorite and a definite must try if you go.  It is a bit expensive if you order mainly sashimi and sushi, but if you get their stone pot rice bowls or some noodles (tantan noodles!) they will help fill you up a bit more and they are always good."}
{"text":"Kingyo used to be my favourite Japanese restaurant in Toronto. However, they recently changed the menu. They no longer have a wide variety of appetisers and small portions of food. Instead, they added more bento boxes kind of food - rice and bento. Very disappointed. In addition, they raised their price significantly. Probably won't come again anytime soon."}
{"text":"Make a Reservation!   I am so impressed with how Kingyo handled my reservation. My table was ready exactly the time I reserved: Saturday 8:30 pm.   Service was attentive and courteous. The vibe was buzzing and full of energy but a lot more quieter than Guu.  Food wise, I was not as impressed. Everything was a little off in taste. A little too bold and overwhelming in some.  We ordered:  Vancouver famous chef Sada's Sea Urchin Shooter ($7.80) - Love the presentation   Goma Ramen Salad with Spicy Cod Roe ($7.80)  - meh! The sesame oil overpowered everything and ended up being a little heavy as a salad  Stone Bowl Seafood Sea Urchin Don ($13.80) - I have high expectation, maybe a little too high... - Or I prefer my Urchin raw, fresh from the shell  Eel Puff Pastry ($10.20) - I like the puff better than the eel stuffing and I love eel - The filling just way too salty  I will give Kingyo another try when I am in the area. Nothing really wow me. Maybe other items on the menu are much better?!"}
{"text":"Had a chance to come here the other day and was pleasantly surprised. Was pretty busy, so had to wait about 15 or 20 minutes before being seated - would recommend a reservation.   We tried a number of dishes. The ebimayo was really good. The ramen was one of the best I've had in Toronto. Lots of flavor and the noodles were cooked really well. We had the steak dish as well which was quite good with white radish. The only dish we tried that wasn't that great was the avocado/seafood ceviche dish - too much avocado, not enough seafood, wouldn't order that one again.   Servers were kind enough, but service was quite slow overall."}
{"text":"My SO is obsessed with this place and used to take me here once in a while. I wasn't particularly crazy about it until recently when a large group of us came in for a late dinner. The food was spectacular, everything tasted super delicious!! The atmosphere is great and the drinks are delicious! Literally everything on the menu is worth trying, regarding drinks do try the Japanese jelly drink, it comes in a small can and also try the sake bomb if you're with a large group of people."}
{"text":"Pretty much everything here is good, and the plating is gorgeous. The decor is also really cool, with pachinko machines hung on the walls, but I'd be careful if you're sensitive to flashing lights. There are also two playable pachinko machines in the bathroom area which I could not figure out how to work, but if you win a jackpot, you can get a coupon for your next visit.  O-sho karaage: Perfectly crunchy on the outside, perfectly juicy on the inside.  Stone-grilled beef tongue: The quality of the beef tongue seems inconsistent. The first time I had this, the beef tongue was flavourless, but the second time, it was richly flavoured and smelled awesome when grilled.  Stone bowl pork rice: Eh. Acceptable, but nothing special. A bit too salty.  Sashimi: Heads and shoulders above what's served at typical cheap sushi places. You definitely get what you pay for.  Creme brulee: It's OK. The cream tastes fresh, as it should, but I think you could get better creme brulee elsewhere.  Almond tofu: Standout dessert. Perfect level of sweetness."}
{"text":"It was my first time here. The atmosphere of the place was great, the staff was super friendly, and the ambiance was cozy and inviting.   We made no reservations but didn't need to wait too long to be seated. I ordered the tan tan noodles with chicken karaage don as a lunch set, and the portions were much larger than I expected. The noodles were a bit too salty for my liking (almost uneatable), but I enjoyed the chicken don. Our waitress also checked up on us periodically and was super sweet.   I left with very good vibes and a satisfied appetite.  I would definitely recommend this place for the experience."}
{"text":"Came for lunch and loved the experience. The food could be a bit better though, so minus one star for that, but I would definitely return.  Love the set lunches. The sets come with soup, veggies, and rice. We got the special ($17) and the sashimi ($15.80) so we could try a bit of everything. It worked perfectly since everything came with two pieces. Everything was good, but nothing especially amazing on its own. The sashimi was ok, not the best quality, but passable.  A 150ml carafe of sake was $9 and the lunch beer is only $3!  A great value and great service!"}
{"text":"Been there several times, I like their fried chicken and hot stone beef tone... Tried four kinds of sushi, feel it is just ok.... Sashimi salad was good, I like the dressing. I'm a big fan of uni, however their uni is fresh enough, but most of the Japanese restaurants use frozen uni anyways."}
{"text":"This is my first time at an izakaya-style restaurant but my overall experience was pleasant. The atmosphere was loud and energetic but not frenetic to the point where it was unpleasant. The non-seafood dishes arrived quickly however the seafood ones took quite a while. I had the tuna and shrimp tartare which had a tasty avocado base and was served with garlic toast. It had less tuna and shrimp than I was hoping for (mostly avocado) but it was very tasty nonetheless. The stonepot rice dish I ordered had sea urchin and other assorted shellfish and was tasty and prepared well. The portion sizes and prices are reasonable. The main drawbacks was the wait time for food and how long it took the server to figure out our bill (we waited for at least 20 min)."}
{"text":"Please go here! I ate lunch here two times I visited Toronto and I loved it! The whole restaurant staff acknowledges you with a loud greeting when you first walk in. The menu seems expensive but the quality and presentation of the food is on point. My friends and I have tried the Kings Lunch set, tuna steak rice, ramen, and more... They get me full every single time. We end off with the green tea creme brûlée and let me tell you...that thing is out of this world. I could eat 5 of those all by myself if my wallet wasn't stopping me... The flavor and the crunch is unreal. They finish off with cute frozen grapes. This place may be tucked away in Cabbagetown, away from downtown Toronto, but the visit is really worth it!"}
{"text":"SUMMARY:  I went here with my boyfriend and my best friend right when they opened for dinner time at 5:30pm. The food truly did not disappoint! If you love Japanese food and tapa style restaurants, this is the place for you!! The restaurant is quite spacious and as the night goes on and the restaurant becomes more lively as the places begins to fill up. The staff are very friendly and inviting.  MY MEAL:  Dish: Yuzu Orange Salmon Carpaccio Review: I love me some salmon!   Their salmon was really fresh and I really enjoyed it with the salad and the in-house dressing they had! Yummm  Dish: Beef Tataki Salad With Ume Dressing Review: My must have dish with every meal! Their beef was really fresh, tender and lean! I liked it with the salad, in- house dressing and wasabi mayo! Great light appetizer   Dish: Duck Special (I can't find the actual name) Review: I don't know why but I always gravitate towards ordering dishes that have duck in it . Any who, it was rather delicious, meat was tender and moist! I enjoyed it with the potatoes, asparagus and tomatoes! Yummmmm   Dish: Assorted Sashimi (5 Types) + Uni Review: Tell me how can everything from here be soooooo good?! Sashimi was really fresh and just melts in your mouth   Dish: Stone Grilled Beef Tongue Review: Must have if you go here! It was fun to cook on the hot stone and the meat was super tasty and tender! Make sure you try it with the different sauces as well.  Dish: Matcha Creme Brûlée  Review: I love me some matcha   to finish off such a tasty meal! It was sweet, moist and torched perfectly on the top.   Dish: Matcha Tiramisu  Review: Tiramisu has to be one of my favorite desserts  and whenever matcha is involved ! It was a light dessert, great way to end off a meal!"}
{"text":"Kingyo is one of the best restaurants in this city! Affordable cocktails, delicious top-notch food, and reliable service. I'm a repeat customer - even without a reservation. Go!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday after the lunch rush hour so it wasn't too busy, which was great. They close at 3 to prepare for the dinner rush so come early if you want the lunch menu. It isn't as extensive as the dinner menu though.   I ordered the tan-tan noodles combo (or something along the lines) which was around $14. It was a reasonable price for what you paid for. Portions are generous if not reasonable and it comes with a side rice dish along with two other small side dishes. The soup flavour is A+ and the noodles are nice and chewy.   For dessert I ordered the black sesame gelato which was really good, I must say. I also ordered the frozen matcha creme brûlée which was really good and creamy on its own; personally I liked it better without the red bean saucing.  This would be my second time visiting and I'd visit it a lot more if it was closer to UofT campus. One star off for being so far off. It's a good 40 minutes walk from Queen's Park if you're not taking TTC."}
{"text":"now that i have been to both locations in Toronto and Vancouver, i am a fan. they have similar menu but not identical. both places are good. they have good cocktails. at least in Vancouver, i have tried their premium sake which was great (but not cheap). the food is very good. not extremely pricey. worth a trip. in Toronto though, worth making reservation."}
{"text":"Oh my the short ribs are awesome!!!! Had to get 2 orders of these!!!  The salad was quite delicious and the ramen was ok. I'd pass on the ramen and get it from a ramen place. The bill wasn't expensive either. I would definitely go back!!!!  - signed a foodie from NYC"}
{"text":"I was in Vancouver about two months ago and had food at the Kingyo branch there.  I loved it and it was one of the best meals of my life.  I was so excited then to find out that there was another Kingyo in Toronto so I decided to check it out last week.  I ordered the yakiudon and the short ribs with rice.  The yakiudon came out quickly and it's basically a big bowl of noodles with some soup, seaweed, and a cracked egg on top with beef.  It was quite savory and filling.  My short ribs came out a little while later.  I had had this previously in Vancouver and found it amazing there.  This wasn't amazing, but it was still good.  It kind of reminds me of Korean galbi jjim only with a bit of a balsamic vinegar-like taste.  I couldn't eat all of it as the portion size was huge!  I packed the rest to go.  Other things: The restaurant is quite spacious and I didn't have much trouble getting a seat at dinner time.  The restrooms were clean.  I also have to add that the service was on point.  I was treated very well as a customer and my glass of water was refilled periodically.  All in all a good experience and I would definitely think about coming back here, if I lived in Toronto."}
{"text":"Kingyo was one my favor spot to get lunch. However, lunch menu is changed recently. The pork lion cutlet lunch set goes up from $14.80 to $21. And the portion of food is much smaller than before(see the image). Also this time, the cutlet is cool down when they served it which is never happened before. Last thing is NO MORE RICE REFILL!!! Probably it's all because the minimum wage goes up but the food quality like these is not okay to me :( too bad"}
{"text":"NO COMMON SENSE . . . WHATSOEVER  Came here ordered 4 PPL prix fix menu, guess how many piece of sashimi they give us? 3 on each type of fish and 7 piece of ebi mayo. Is it a math problem or a logic problem? Isn't 4 people means everyone should get an equal portion of it? Or One person is just not as important, or you expect us to fight for it? Is 2 person prix fix will have 1 piece of sashimi too? Common...   2nd...fried food and hot food come first...but sashimi come at 3rd plate? When we ask the server isn't raw food should come before cooked food? Guess what she said: \" You can request for it.\"  Well...I guess I need to request some COMMON SENSE next time.   3rd...they kept giving us the wrong dish for 3 times. And when we asked how many dishes are there left? She went away come back with a dish we had already ....  really?   You guys strike 3 most impossible dining experience in a roll!   4th...isn't summerlicious or any sort of this thing should include a dessert as well? Not saying that I'm dying for a dessert or can't afford a dessert, it's the most inconsiderate dinning experience ever.   Kingyo...what happened to you and your excellent management and menu ?      Bottom, food was alright. But the whole experience just ruin it all."}
{"text":"Seulement 3 étoiles car l'accueil et le service qui nous a été réservé pour notre deuxième soirée dans ce restaurant n'a vraiment pas été à la hauteur :/ C'est d'autant plus dommage que la qualité des plats est vraiment au rendez vous : c'est très bon ! En revanche, les serveurs/serveuses poussent un peu à la consommation... on comprend vite que les pourboires sont d'autant plus important que la note est haute... Je vous conseille ce resto néanmoins."}
