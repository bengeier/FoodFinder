{"text":"Regular here. I'm from Vancouver and I always keep an eye for decent sushi in Toronto. I used to go to this place once a week... not anymore

Good sushi, fair price, discount of takeout, what's not to like? 

Yesterday, I went there for my usual Love Boat take out order and I noticed that huge price jump. The price for the Love Boat B was 45.99 and it's now 62.99. I was initially confused by it and then realized that they've changed all menus. Looked around and the restaurant is now empty without any take out order then everything started to click and I know why. 

Since I have to wait for the order to come, I went back to my car and grabbed the old menu and went back to the restaurant to compare with the new prices. The lady came by and took my old menu away! Sneaky sneaky

If anyone has any recommendations to any other comparable sushi restaurant, it would be greatly appreciated. $17 price jump on the same order is not cool. As much as I love sushi, I'm not paying that.  

I'm going to miss that nice lady that yells \"hello, AKANNNEE\" on the phone"}
{"text":"So, my friend and I were googling yummy sushi joints in Thornhill/Richmondhill area to have dinner. We never found this place, we initially wanted to go someplace else, but couldn't find it! So, we just settled for this place after much dispute and hunting. and boy am I ever glad we did!! THEY ARE NOT STINGY LIKE THE OTHER PLACES! OMG. Korean owned and operated, this place DELIVERS QUALITY ROLLS! The AMOUNT OF AVOCADO the green rolls have...I must've consumed some 3 avocados in one sitting. Keeep itttt cominnn!! They have some AMAZING rolls. We ordered 7 rolls, a bento box, and some sashimi. All of which were excellent!"}
{"text":"Nice owner!! Service good !! Food OK!! I really really love Sundae Roll so much!"}
{"text":"Any all you can eat Japanese restaurant are better than them.  Rolls are horrible, they r wet and rice falling apart, tempura mix they only give u 6 slices of pumpkin and 3 small shrimps at least they r fresh, seafood udon they only give u tiny tiny squids.

No more chance to go back again"}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times over the years, but recently the quality and attitude of the staff has deteriorated beyond belief! While my friend and I were ordering the waitress (which may have also been the owner) just walked off half way through our order to fix something in the front of the store. That's just plain rude. After ordering, she brought us our salad and slammed it down in front of us without even saying sorry! We already were not impressed with the service. When we got our bento boxes the amount of rice we got was 1/2 of what the usual amount was! On top of this, she got our order wrong! The sashimi was poorly sliced and was quite small. Overall, terrible experience. I've never had service this terrible even at bubble tea restaurants. After being a loyal patron all these years, I've finally reached my limit. Definitely not going back."}
{"text":"The food is average for a competent sushi restaurant. Good value in their combo sushi Bento boxes. The decor and service is a bit old and tired though. And there is an aroma in the air that all good sushi restaurants do not have. However, the sushi / sashimi was tasty and fresh."}
{"text":"UPDATE: I initially gave AKANE a high rating, but after last night that is changing to a 1! Placed an order for pick up, my usual: spicy tuna roll and spicy sashimi salad. I was in disbelief of how much they have shrunk their portions. I am not talking by a little bit, before my spicy tuna roll was huge with lots of tuna inside and the rice was thin. They have now shrunk the portion to not even half the size it was before ALSO it is now basically ALL rice and barely any tuna. I will never order from here again and will be looking or a new sushi spot.   

I have to say that I am a sushi addict and have gone to many Japanese restaurants not only here in Toronto but also sushi town in Vancouver and after going here I am convinced there is no place with better sushi or service. Yes its not the fanciest and by no mean upscale, but if we are just talking quality of food and service than this is your spot. From the lady who takes your order to the sushi chef, everyone is so polite, friendly, and all around just amazing customer service. The food is delicious, big portions and great quality. I always call and order 2 spicy tuna rolls with sashimi salad and each time I get my order I am more than satisfied. HIGHLY recommended and the best sushi place hands down!"}
{"text":"My new go to sushi spot! I'm a sucker for cheap, quality sushi and this place absolutely hits the spot. Bento boxes from 7.99 for lunch, all day specials at 10.99 (more than enough food) and the sushi/rolls are very fresh."}
{"text":"FRESH FRESH FRESH is what this place has to offer. 

Located in a quiet strip plaza along the busy Highway 7, you would definitely miss it driving along.  Thru reading other yelpers reviews, I decided to give this place a shot. 

We, party of 2 arrived on a Saturday night 6:30pm and only a few tables were occupied out of a total 16 tables.  The father and son were behind the sushi bar creating an array of pretty, colorful dishes while the mother was the only waitress on the floor.  There was also another employee in the back manning the cooked food. 

The menu was extensive, with LOTS of pictures of the food selection--I love it when sushi places show what the rolls are because half the time, I don't know what's in it just based on the names. 

Based on reviews, we ordered a Small Love Boat of 22 pieces sashimi/12 pieces sushi/6 pieces roll ($31.99) and a Fire Dragon Roll ($12.99). The boat had well over 40 pieces and the selection of fish that we got was remarkable. Some key ones that stood out--fatty tuna (melt in your mouth goodness), sweet shrimps/squids/scallops (sweet and succulent), yellow tobiko gelled with a piece of mackerel (interestingly unusual) and hamachi belly (my favorite out of all). The temperature of all the fish was spot on and the taste was simply divine.

The Fire Dragon roll was amazing as well, with the rice ever so chewy and the avocado tasted like butter!  The only bummer was the seaweed was a little chewy. Presentation won it all though. 

Last but not least, there was ice cream on the house, a choice of green tea or mango. Nothing special, your usual staple. The bill took a little long to come but hey, it was a full house by the time and the poor lady was running all over.  Still, this place deserves my big fat 5 stars!  

A side note, during the time we were dining here, not only did the chefs have to create the food for in house but the amount of orders for takeout was tremendous yet we still didn't have to wait long for our food.  You get the exact same amount in takeout as dining in (some places offer less!)."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant!! If I don't grab takeout from sushi Bong this is my other place! The restaurant is cute, love the chef he's so sweet, always gives us on the house handrolls which he knows I love ! The ultimate roll is AMAZING, spicy salmon/tuna roll is  AMAZING! They have fantastic bento boxes, love the jap chae noodles!! This place has great fresh sushi for a good price! If I ever want to sit in instead of takeout this is the place:)"}
{"text":"Yum! I love this place for their sushi boats. Came here for lunch as a party of 7 on a Saturday and even though it wasn't busy at all, it is recommended that you call ahead because their tables aren't set up for large parties so it gives them time to arrange the tables. 

We ordered the largest sushi boat, salmon sashimi roll and blue mountain roll. The sushi boat is generously portioned for 5 people and comes with an assortment of sashimi (scallops are my favourite), nigiri (including unagi and uni!), and 3 maki rolls - everything was fresh! They were even kind enough to give us a plate of fried salmon head on the house."}
{"text":"Always order there love boat,  comparing to before, their food quality is goes down, the sashimi is not fresh as before.  Today is the worse.  Salmon is outdated and it's smell bad.  Owner just exchange me two salmon after I told her.   ????"}
{"text":"Great selection of lunch specials at an amazing price! Decent sushi and makis. I like how the combos come with agedashi tofu and japchae. Bring cash to get 13% off for take-out."}
{"text":"This is my go to when I want a full a la carte meal for a reasonable price and a variety of sushi selection. 

Food - For 2-3 people
Love boat A 
You get a variety of sushi/sashimi (amaebi, uni, salmon, unagi, hotate, ika etc.) and a spicy salmon roll (can change to dynamite at no additional cost). Presentation is top and food quality is decent.
Riceless roll 
These are amazing since rice fills me up too quickly. They simply replace the rice filling with more veggies and protein. 

Cost - Mid range pricing. 
The boat is approximately $40 and roll at $10. 

Service - There is usually only one lady that runs the front of the restaurant. Service can get a bit frustrating when it gets busy as she can't attend to you immediately. 

Ambiance - Family run restaurant with approximately 40 seatings so it's usually not too noisy.

P.S. They serve miso soup, salad and jap chae as starters. Dinner service comes with green tea or mango ice cream at the end of the meal too! 

Highly recommend this place for anyone that's looking for good value and variety in sushi."}
{"text":"Service really kinda sucks here. Not so friendly. But the food is fairly good value, I have to admit. We got the medium sushi boat and could not finish it (three people). The sashimi was fresh (except the uni) and there was a good selection. Other people in our party ordered bento boxes and they were also satisfied. I wouldn't rush back anytime soon given all the other japanese options around but I wouldn't object to coming back again if it's suggested in the future."}
{"text":"The best sushi restaurant we've found in the area.  It's not all-you-can-eat, but the portions are a good size, reasonably priced - and most importantly - very good.  It's also small and family run which gives it a homey feel."}
{"text":"Uh oh, I think we have to say good bye to ichiban fish house Richmondhill  :( 

We visited Akane last night (Sun), order love boat (like all Yelpers), and veggie tempura. 

Fish was FRESH, and good variety.  they didn't give you fake crab meat or surf clam as sashimi count.  

Also, can't believe we get soup, salad and ice cream tooo...

will try take out next time!!!"}
{"text":"This used to be a favorite place for decent sushi for the price, but seems to have gone downhill. Service was never that great, but the new server they hired was terrible as she ignored tables and customers. The menu and food remained only adequate, but the prices jumped way higher than the food items they served. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Been coming here fairly regularly for years (dating back to when it was Gal Sushi here).  Its impossible to find another place that gives the same quality and quantity for their low price!! Have yet to find another place that gives nearly the same amount for $7.99 (lunch) and all-day boxes for $10.99.
 The fish is sliced proportionately, and the fish-to-rice ratio in the rolls/sushi is great. 
Some people here are complaining about the staff/service, but even though there is usually only one waitress that might not always seem the most friendly, she is very efficient and gets the job done despite often having a full restaurant to serve by herself.
Will continue coming back to this place as my go-to sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch at around 2pm, place was not too full but guessing because it's a holiday they only had one server. There were a couple tables and the server had told us to sit at the table next to the door in which I asked if I could sit in the table inside. She insisted that we sit at the table next to the table couple more times until she finally let us sit at the table inside. Was that not reasonable to ask since it is -20 outside and you have several tables empty?

We quickly ordered since there were a number of tables also visiting to get their orders in. Our food was the fastest to arrive which was great for us, but not for the others who came before we did (but no complaints from us here). We both got L4 sashimi combo which comes with standard soup and salad  ($9.99). The menu almost looks identical to Gal, pretty sure it's still owned by Gal (which I believe was what it used to be anyway). Back to the food.... everything was delicious, portions were a little smaller compared to Gal.

By the end of lunch, the server was calmer and she did ask how everything was. Think I will stick with Gal sushi even though it is further for me, my service and food experience overall was better there."}
{"text":"I used to frequent this place religiously because they honestly have one of the best sushi in Markham. The love boat platters were my favorite and for take out you receive a 13% discount (so no tax). 

Just went there yesterday to order my usual tray to find out they jacked up the price that is worst than inflation. I'm not sure how many regulars would be returning after seeing prices increase like that. Love boat A was 31.99 now its 39.99, love boat B was 45.99 and now is a WHOPPING 62.99!!! I was shocked.

Sushi is good. But not THAT good. Won't be returning.

Service is iffy. They're nice but at the same time don't give a shit about you. I don't know how I feel about that."}
{"text":"I like visiting this place since the sushi is fresh and you get a lot for what you pay. The prices are very reasonable .  There are other sushi joints really close , but at Akane, you get a lot more ."}
{"text":"This is my go to place when I'm craving sushi. The quality is great. Their fish is fresh tasting and made to order, good sized portions and their prices are very reasonable. It is a small place with only about 10 tables though, so I usually just get take-out."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. And this is me talking mainly in terms of the service. When we came to the restaurant it was 8:00pm on a Friday night and it was apparently full, but the waitress lady didn't spoke a word to us. We only got a few glances from her and that was it. We had to wait standing for half an hour, when the lady finally gave us some attention and asked how many people were eating. At the time, a couple just came in, they were served almost immediately and before us, apparently they were regulars...hmmm I see some favouritisms going on here.

-----Food: Moderate------ 
Bulgogi     --      I'd rename this dish as the Chopstick Master Exam. Seriously. How would you expect anyone to eat rice and bulgogi on a dish, without the use of a spoon or lifting the plate? (Why didn't you ask for a spoon then? Because it was a one-lady show and by the time she got to our table, I was already done.) And the meat. Some of it was still rawish. *wince* The meat was leaning more towards the bland side of the spectrum, don't get me wrong, there definetly was some sort of taste to it, the marinating was simply weak. That aside, it was a-ok, there are plenty of Korean-run restaurants or even Chinese-run in some cases, that make much better bulgogi at much better prices ($10.99 for bulgogi?). 

Sushi Boat B     --     Since I am no raw sushi or sashimi lover, I can't really comment on it. But I see no ice flakes, the fish looked fresh and wasabi was indeed left out of the sushi as requested, so I'm guessing it was a good sign. I tried one of their cooked rolls, not sure what was in it...and found that the rice was falling off. Who knows? It just might be my poor chopstick skills that's affecting the rice. 

Japchae     --     It was another alright dish. They used the same sauce from the bulgogee I had for dinner, much watered down though. And the noodles were wet, thick, and only had slivers of carrot within, this is certainly not the authentic japchae. 

-----Atmosphere: Moderate-----
Not much to say. A bit cramped, but in general it was reasonable being a small conventional sushi restaurant. With your average decor and limited spacing, I thought the place was quite fair. The restaurant did get pretty darn loud as expected from an Asian condensed food area.   

-----Service: Poor-----
Gah! I had to comment AGAIN on the service--too slow and need more hands on deck. Waited about 20 minutes for food and at least 5, to order. I really feel sorry for the lady, having to run all over the restaurant and sometimes messing orders up. Based on the menu and restaurant name, this is a sushi restaurant, so logically thinking, I would not think that one sushi chef would be enough to cover for the entire restaurant.  

*----- Final Thoughts: ------* 
A disappointment, despite its high ratings. 
Food: 3/5 
Service: 2/5
Atmosphere: 3/5"}
{"text":"Great sushi joint. We been eating here for almost a year and they never disappoint us. They use fresh seafood. Sushi rolls are good looking and most importantly very tasty. Sashimi is great too ... no complaints whatsoever. Few times we ordered some takeout (sushi trays) and it was made on time, ready for pickup. The parking situation is quite painful but it's not their fault ... the entire plaza is packed with restaurants. If you arrive there around 6-7pm, give yourself at least 15-20 minutes to find a parking spot."}
{"text":"Their food is consistent and it was well priced BUT I think they are under new ownership and as such they have changed all their prices... A dramatic increase with some dishes, for instance the Red, Gold, Gold roll used to be 21.99, now it's 29.99! 60p sashimi used to be $42.99, now it's $59.99!

Some of their prices don't make much sense either. For instance a 45p sashimi platter is $39.99, but their 60p is $58.99. How is it that when I order more, it also costs more per piece. 

They also got rid of the cash discount. It has to be on orders over $30 now. This used to be my go to place for sushi but with the drastic increase in prices and odd pricing schemes, I'll go somewhere else.

."}
{"text":"Came here with a party of 5 people. Great food but horrible service, the waitress starting giving me attitude when I asked her for hot tea and ice water.  Asked for the bill and wasn't offers ice cream till I asked. Then heard the table next to us about attitude as well. Too bad, would've been a good place to eat if it wasn't for the bad service."}
{"text":"Yesterday my friend and I went here for lunch, something we've done several times before. However, this time the server had changed and the service has gone from excellent to non-existent. It took more than 30 minutes to get proper acknowledgment from the server. My friend didn't even have chopsticks set on her table. She had to go to the back and get some herself. We had gotten the server's attention several times and made it clear that we have a limited time for lunch, to which she said \"yeah, yeah\" and did nothing that was requested. She didn't refill tea or water and my mouth was shriveling like a raisin by the end of my frustrating dining experience. The food was good as usual but it was all overshadowed by the awful, awful service. If this girl was new she shouldn't have been working on her own as the sole server. I don't think I'm going back."}
{"text":"Relatively decent pricing. Portions of rolls are definitely above average. Udon is pretty good compared to other places in the area. 

Service is okay."}
{"text":"For the price and quality, it's def the go to for sushi place."}
{"text":"One of my all time favourite sushi places in Richmond Hill.  Not the best but very good for the price.  They make some fantastic maki rolls too.  The only place I know that makes a carb free maki.  Tulip!  Mmmmm. Great spicy tuna too!

Small place and decor a bit out dated...family owned and run.  When they get very busy the service lacks as the entire place is looked after by one or two service staff.  But overall service is good."}
{"text":"A fantastic family run Sushi bar!

I was introduced to Akane by a colleague and haven't looked back since. The ingredients (ie. fish) are always fresh and the portions are rather generous. I've yet to explore the entire menu but I've covered it on the Maki, Nigiri, and Sashimi fronts with no complaints. 

Noteworthy dishes include the classic Spicy Tuna/Salmon Roll, Caterpillar Roll and any of the (rice free) Well Being Rolls. 

As far as service goes, it's no doubt a friendly establishment if not on the slightly slow side; still, don't let this take away from the great experience and consistency offered at Akane."}
{"text":"Been to this place a few times, food is decent. But customer service is terrible. The server, also the cashier never seems to smile and is rude. I placed an order today by telephone and stated I would be there in 10 minutes. The server agreed it would be ready for pick up. When I arrived, she seemed surprised and no order was even placed. I had to wait unnecessarily in a restaurant that was already packed. She did not even apologize. Rude beyond belief."}
{"text":"Only go here if you like to be treated like dirt. 

I used to frequent this restaurant a lot since the price was decent. That was until I was shocked by the extreme rude attitude of the waitress. 

I went there for lunch and while I was chatting with my family, the middle-aged waitress snatched the menu from our hands! She said \"L2 right??\" (which is usually what we order) The waitress didn't even give me a chance to read the menu! I didn't know they have the super power of mind-reading!! I was extremely shocked with the way we were treated. I wanted to make sure that the correct order was put in, and she said \"yeah yeah, all salmon\" and gave me a dirty look. 

Since I believe in giving second chances I went there again. The second time, she still gave us dirty looks, no smile, and generally hostile attitude. I'm really puzzled by her rude attitude. I always always treat my servers with respect and complete politeness. I thank them for handing me my food every time, and I tip reasonably. So I'm not sure why she decided to treat us with such disrespect. 

Needless to say, I will not go back."}
{"text":"Look at the menu and found that the price is economical.   The place is decent.  The servers are nice.

Lots of rolls are around $4 and the portion is huge.   The roll is around 8\" to 10\" long.  2 will stuff you for the whole meal.  We tried the spicy salmon roll and can't complain with the price.  There are lot of combinations of sashimi and sushi platter.  The price once again is very reasonable.  Although they are not the top notch quality but given the price tag, it is a deal.

The fried udon's portion is a bit small and very oily.  It is not recommended.

Overall, the place is nice and quiet. Service is good and the price is very reasonable."}
{"text":"Take-out was ordered. It was a boat and sushi/sashimi platter. The food overall was fresh. The choice of selection offered by the restaurant is considered above average. It does not offer the common and cheap-graded Tai (red snapper) and the white Butter fish. The portion per order was decent, not horrible, but not huge. For a 5 star, I would expect greater portion per order and greater size per piece. The size per piece was smaller compared to the majority of other Japanese restaurants in Toronto and Asia. Otherwise, food would have been a 5 star. 

The service was great. The waitress over the phone and at pick-up was well manner, polite, friendly and greeted with a big warm smile. Whether you like the free food or not, the order came with free sample of food. I'd give the service a 5 star.

Overall, 4.5."}
{"text":"this place is fab...wait for it...ulous, fabulous! you get UNI with the boats for no additional cost, so mouthwatering altho it is small but w.e. they also giv u freebies time to time like salmon head, rolls, etc. great prices and polite and friendly waitress."}
{"text":"Well... If you don't want to splurge on sushi, this is definitely the place to go. But if you're looking for good service, don't bother coming here. 

Came here on a Saturday night around 7:30pm. Took us 5 mins just to get noticed by someone to seat us. And then maybe another 10 minutes just to get our orders in. The table next to us started complaining about how 2 party trays of takeout have already gone out, meanwhile they have been waiting for almost an hr for their order. From that point on I had a sense that that was going to be an interesting night ahead, and indeed it was. 

First, the older lady ended up spilling liquid all over the floor, and instead of using a mop to clean up, she decided to just wipe it and lay newspaper all over the floor. Then as she cleaned up another table and walked by, she clumsily knocked into me and spilled some gross liquid all over me. She apologized and gave me an entire roll of paper towel to clean up. 

I believe her daughter was also working there and ended up spilling tea on another Table as well. Seems like everyone was having a bad day.

Our order ended up taking about 30 mins to come, not bad considering the angry table next door who eventually walked without getting their meal. The bentoboxes were around 15.99 for dinner. The sashimi and sushi pieces were pretty big, however the side dishes were ridiculously small. My rice was like 2 spoonfuls, my japchae was all chopped up into bits. 

My bf ended up finding a piece of hair in his roll. Ugh. Gross. We didnt even bother complaining to the owners and just wanted to leave after basically losing our appetite. We won't be coming back here. The service pretty much ruined it."}
{"text":"Super friendly, good service, good food, definitely recommend for dates the love boats are amazing"}
{"text":"This is the place I go to for my quick sushi fix that's good value for money. I've gotten takeout here many times. The Loveboat A is a really good deal ($40 if you pay by cash). Has uni, hamachi, toro and salmon (although the uni isn't always fresh. Some days it reeks of fishiness and some days it's alright). Menu says there's 40 pieces for 2 people (nigiri, rolls and sashimi), but there's usually way more than 40 pieces (maybe 50-60) and there's always leftovers for the 2 of us. Food quality is generally consistent (except for the uni sometimes).

Never dined in before but when I pick up take out during dinner time, the place is pretty packed.  

Call in your takeout order a day in advance and get free japchae. 

Would recommend for your standard Japanese sushi fix."}
{"text":"What a great lunch spot! My bestfriend loves this spot and couldn't wait to bring me here. Once you walk in you, you are instantly happy. All the lovely ladies and their traditional uniform. You cant help but smile. The place was clean and tidy. We had the special spicy salmon maki roll and the pink lady. Hands down the BEST spicy salmon roll I have had. I've been really expensive sushi spots in NYC and nothing comes close to what i had here. The reason for the 4 star is because i really wish they had more people working. This lovely lady was doing it all. The phone, the ordering, the greeting. But anyways, will definitely be back for more of that salmon roll. The price is so reasonable for the quality you get. Thanks for such a great meal!"}
{"text":"Recently found out about this place and it's definitely one of my go-to's for sushi! A huge portion for a decent price! Lots of variety for sushi and the quality of the food is great! 

For lunch, they serve miso soup, salad, and japchae (glass noodles) in addition to what you order. For dinner, they also serve the above, but also salmon head and ice cream for the same price . 

We (4 people) usually order the love boat for 2 people and one maki roll. There is always more than enough. 

The server (usually a Korean woman) doesn't really understand English and is pretty rude, hence, 4 stars."}
{"text":"Good service and great value for fresh food! We came here twice, never had to wait, generous portions for a very reasonable price!"}
{"text":"Very nice friendly staff. The food was made fresh. There's a mix of Japanese and Korean style dishes. If you ordered a Korean dish it comes with a few Korean sides at no extra cost. Their eel bimbambap was a tad too oily was hoping for it to be less oily. Very clean and nicely renovated area."}
{"text":"The lunch specials are filling and worth the price. I love how there's a discount if paid for takeout with cash. Waiters are always friendly. Chef remembers your preferences!"}
{"text":"TL;DR: (Summary)

****FOR OLD CLIENTS: THEY MARKED UP THEIR PRICES SIGNIFICANTLY, EXCEPT FOR THE SMALL BENTO BOXES (WHICH ARE STILL $9.99 EACH). EVERYTHING IS MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE. PLEASE LOOK AT THE NEW TAKEOUT MENU BEFORE GOING. 

****FOR NEW PEOPLE: Feel free to try. Their food is good, and you can expect good service. For me personally, I used to go 2-3 times a month. I am now going once every 3-4 months. 


----------------------------------
I am very disappointed in Akane Sushi. One of the biggest reasons my family and I go there is because the owner (a lady) is very nice, the sushi rolls and dishes are delicious, and most importantly, it was very WORTH IT. You could've spent $50 there, enough for 2 meals (because the portions were massive), where other restaurants with the same proportions would need $70-$90.

THIS IS NOT THE CASE ANYMORE!
They increased their prices and assumed nothing was wrong. It is definitely reasonable to mark up prices due to the declining Canadian dollar and what not, but for example, their love-boat B used to cost $45.99, now it cost $62.99. THEY MARKED UP BY $17!!

This is ridiculous. Their portions didn't change either--everything on the menu, like a good 90% of the dishes, were marked up by $2 or 80% of their original price. Take Spicy Salmon roll, for example, now it is $5.99 when it used to be $3.99.

In terms of quality and service, the waitresses definitely provided good service--BECAUSE MOST OF THEIR CLIENTS LEFT DUE TO THE MARK UP. They used to be so busy because there would be 10 take out orders on their backs while having to serve 20 people. Now they stand around. I went yesterday and a lot of people were marvelled by the mark up, and took 10 minutes to decide. The restaurant had virtually 5 tables filled, when it used to be at 5 PM exactly, the entire restaurant was full of people. Worse was their takeout--I sat there for 1.5 hours and only ONE person came for their takeout, when it used to be 10-20 people per hour, during the dinner hours.

WORSE: They didn't even tell their clients, the old ones, that prices changed. An elderly Asian Man came in to get his takeout, to find the $50 he brought wasn't enough to buy the food.

The quality of the food stayed the same, obviously. Their dishes were delicious as per usual, although I was very sad that the cost of buying 1 Spicy Salmon Roll cost as much as buying 2 of them before the markup.

In Conclusion:
-prices marked up by a lot, except for some dishes
-qualtiy and service improved because less and less people are going
-still better than a lot of sushi places in Toronto Area"}
{"text":"Always my go to place for reasonable price, good quality sushi~if you order takeout and pay cash, save the tax as well. Love this place!! My favourite is the love boat and also their lunch special Gyoza box!!"}
{"text":"Bad service, bad attitude, very disappointed as they used to be good. Stay away from this place, never going back"}
{"text":"Akane has great quality sushi served in a quick manner. Lunch, dinner, and all day bento boxes are cheap, and affordable, ranging from $10-$20CAD (appotximately). A nice and quite spot to eat with family and friends. One of the best sushi places in the GTA (considering value)."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on Sunday. They are not like it used to be. The lady who look like the owner was serving, she was rude, bitter, giving attitude, and was quite mean. She gave attitude not only to myself but she also did it for other customers. 

I ordered a lunch special box, wanted to change my white tuna to any other fish. The owner refuse and said \"no changes allow, if you want all salmon needed upcharge $1\". (Makes no sense to me when salmon isnt that expensive; there are only 2 white tuna sashimi and 1 white tuna nigiri in the lunch box anyways.)

The table next to me ordered a sushi boat, the child wanted an ice cream and it was expected that dessert was included; especially ordering from the regular menu. The owner said \"no ice cream, ice cream is only serve after 5pm for dinner\". They went on for a few minutes, arguing how the sushi boat was the same price regardless of the time of ordering and there is no ice cream given for afternoon. Owner lady even said very loudly when asked so there's no ice cream in your fridge, \"no there's no ice cream\". Ended up: customers left unhappy, the little girl was upset and so was her parents. 

Few minutes later, another Canadian couple wanted to change their seating from window to further inside the restaurant and the owner lady yelled from the end of the restaurant to the store front \"no you cannot sit there [table the couple wanted to change to] for two people\" (when there was at least 3 free tables available) 

Quality of food went down, the maki was poorly rolled. Nigiri was just pretty much placing the fish on top of the scrunched up rice. The sushi rice was dry and cold. The salmon sashimi still has part of the skin fat and a piece of scale on it.

This restaurant's experience just make me shake my head the entire lunch. For price, quality and service I will definitely not come back."}
{"text":"I recently found this place through a friend. She told me it was $10 for a lunch bento but considering I usually get my sushi from sushi bong I was already used to that price point.  But unlike sushi bong i didn't realize that for that $10 it includes 8 pieces of nicely cut slices of sashimi (4 salmon, 2 butterfish,  and 2 tilapia) , 4 pieces of sushi, 6 rolls, tempura tofu, Korean cold noodles and rice. 

Having the sashimi alone for that price trumps any other place I've been to so far. Will continue to come here for sure."}
{"text":"Amazing! Great food. The rolls are the freshest. It was like when you have that sip of coke after being nearly dehydrated for two days. Life altering. The service is wonderful. Very nice people. Very accommodating for our cultural differences. The soup magnificent.  I had a four star experience. If you pass by and you don't stop you are denying yourself the finest things in life. Service is faster than I formally knew that was humanly possible."}
{"text":"Recently stopped by this sushi restaurant as I was passing by the Richmond hill area. Man, oh man! Service here was rude as hell! The server I had was probably in her late 50's, and she had that typical \"I hate the youths of today\" attitude. She gave off a really bad vibe the moment she told us where to sit. Basically, she was unresponsive, uninterested and unfriendly towards my table! She didn't like answering questions my friend had about the menu, and I could tell she was hastily trying to get my table out as fast as possible. Only positive thing about her was that she at least offered complimentary ice cream (but I believe she had to give it out because it's a restaurant standard). One could tell she was stressed out as the restaurant was a full-house and she was the only waitress on the floor, but still, you can't expect good tips if your service etiquette is comparable to that of a TTC drivers. If she wasn't so rude, I would have given 3.5 stars, because the food was good. I ordered the daisy maki and I actually enjoyed it. 

Would not come back here again unless my expectations of the service changes."}
{"text":"Currently my favorite sushi place. I've tried both the small and large love boats and must say both are amazing. The selection on the large love boat is impeccable. The fish is always fresh. Theyre sweet shrimp and yellow herring are my favorites. Their salmon belly sashimi melts in your mouth. Their rolls are pretty good too! Their sake is really decently priced. We came in one night and stayed for an hour and half after closing. They were really nice and even gave us a big 8 piece soy paper, spicy salmon roll on the house (after closing). That could because we are regulars there, but they sure know how to keep their customers satisfied and coming back. Their service is usually great! Maybe once I received mediocre service. But overall, a great sushi place. Really fresh sashimi. Am definitely a regular when I'm back in town."}
{"text":"Akane has good lunch and dinner specials. I've been here a few times and the food is consistently good. Service is pleasant and the staff are always cheery.

Bento boxes come standard with miso soup and salad, as well as glass noodles and cold fried tofu. Sashimi and sushi taste fresh. The teriyaki salmon is pretty good and flavourful.

Nothing bad to say about this place - would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I get takeout from here once a week. For best value, definitely get the love boats. Me and my boyfriend always order love boat A for $32. They have uni, hamachi, scallop, mackerel, and ebi. Their sushi rice flavour is on point. 
The dynamite roll is super yummy as well. 

On their menu, they only have three sizes for love boats, but if you require a bigger one, they can do it for you. All you have to do is ask. 

Owners are a nice Korean couple. They work really hard, 6 days a week, more than 12 hours a day. Sometimes you'll see their daughter or son working too. 
It's not the best looking sushi but the value is there. Miso soup is solid too. They don't cheap out on flavour. 

If you order takeout, here's a tip. They usually give you packaged soy sauce. Don't get this. Ask for their homemade soy sauce. It's on the sweeter side but compliments the sushi very well. You'll thank me for sure."}
{"text":"I had a craving for sushi since my return to Toronto and this was my first pick. When we got here, my friend and I were worried that there wouldn't be enough seats for us. It was a friday night afterall. However, although they were packed, the seats were available pretty quick - maybe we got lucky. But I didn't see any lineups going past 10 minutes. 

We ordered the smallest loveboat for dinner. It came with salad, soup, glass noodles (?) and also dessert. The food actually came really quick, which is definitely a plus when you are super hungry. The sushi was very good. I'd say 90% of the food was quite fresh. There was also enough variety to not bore our palates. I have been to a few sushi restaurants (not buffets), and this one is definitely one of my favourites. What we ordered was perfect; in fact it was quite filling for the two of us. There were so much options on the menu too! - Definitely another future visit to try other items. 

It was also a fairly good pick in my opinion! The service was great. However,, keep in mind the place is quite small. So it may feel cramped depending how comfortable you like your seating."}
{"text":"This place truly went downhill in the last year. It looks like there is new management and their process is total chaos. We arrived with a group of 4 people at 7:15pm on a Saturday for dinner. They had one table for 6 available but had us wait 20 minutes until a table for 4 opened up. The table of 6 was made up of connecting tables and could've easily been split up. 

We asked for water and it took another 20 minutes to get it.  It has been over 30 minutes since we put in our order and we still don't even have our salads or soup. 

Server does not seem to understand English and came back after 20 minutes to confirm our order. 

As other yelpers have pointed out, they raised their prices significantly, albeit the portions did get bigger. Slices of fish are bigger and thicker than before and more rice in sushi (too much actually). A small love boat was $31.99 and is now $39.99, medium love boat was $42.99 and is now $63.99. 

Do not come for dinner if you are hungry and want your food quick. Lunch on a weekday might be ok."}
{"text":"Sushi was good.  Wellbeing sunflower roll was good add well. 

Hope you speak Japanese, because theydon't speak English.

Nice place"}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try and won't be returning. The sushi was average and nothing memorable. Their prices were decent however the service was unenjoyable. Not sure if the older lady that served us was having a bad day but she had a grumpy expression the entire time we were there."}
{"text":"As you know, I'm a regular at this joint and my girlfriend and I always order the small love boat. 

We've been able to swap the dynamite roll to spicy roll with no additional charge (we offered prior to ordering) but it was never on the bill. Not sure if this applies to all rolls but don't be shy to ask. 

Due to service has improved, I'm giving it 5 stars but this is based on my visits. We usually go on weekends between 8-9:30pm...being Asian, I eat late.  You may have had slow service, but it is to be expected when one poor lady is serving all tables.

As always, sushi is delicious and fresh!"}
{"text":"This is our go to Sushi restaurant when we are tired of an AYCE Sushi place. This restaurant is Korean owned and it's located in a very busy Chinese plaza. Depending on the time of day, parking might be an issue even though the parking spaces are plentiful. 

We always choose the Sushi boats option as they have above average Sashimi and Sushi. We have yet to have a bad dining experience here. They also provide us with a complementary plate of fish head. I also like their Udon especially their noodles. 

In regards to service, I do tend to agree with the other reviewers that it can be a toss up but it might also partly be due to language barrier. Unfortunately, English is not their strong forte. 

Definitely give this place a try, as they also do takeout, you won't be disappointed.

Highly Recommended."}
{"text":"Such a great date spot! Richmondhill is subpar when it comes to mediocre sushi -- but Akane is above and beyond!! 

Like others mention the fish is fresh and melt in your mouth. 

From other suggestions we ordered the small love boat and a bottle of sake! 

We arrived at 8 on a Saturday and were greeted and sat immediately. Service was prompt and steady throughout the night. We didn't leave until 10 and never felt rushed out despite the amount of hungry people walking in after us. 

I'd recommend this place any day, fresh and lovely - cant wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I am absolutely in love with this place. This is my go to sushi place. what keeps me coming back is the quality of the sushi for the price. I haven't found another place with decent sashimi at such prices. 

All bentos and loveboats come with soup and salad, and dinner/all day bentos and loveboats come with ice cream at the end, too!

I cannot exaggerate how many times a day I think of the fresh, mouthwatering sashimi from this place. My boyfriend and I ordered the small loveboat and every piece of it was heaven. The sashimi melted in my mouth, there isn't a lot of rice on the sushi, and the rolls were pretty good, too. 

I am very satisfied with this place."}
{"text":"My friend and I wanted some sushi the other night, but didn't want AYCE so we decided to try somewhere new. I had read on yelp that this location had some of the best sushi boats, so we gave it a try. I guess you can say that I was very pleasantly surprised!

With all sorts of different fish and options on the love boat, I'm glad we came here. We went for the Love Boat B, with 60+ sushi/sashimi/rolls for about $62.99. It was a great choice as they gave different options of fish, along with some pricier items that most places would leave out like uni, scallop, and eel. I got to admit that I was quite impressed with the spread they gave and everything seemed to be very fresh!

Service was quite good overall. We did see something questionable in one of our tea cups, but they were very apologetic and gave us a new cup right away. They were quick to assist us and very friendly as well.

Great sushi for a great price is always good in my books. Definitely a place I will be coming back to when I'm looking for a la carte sushi boats."}
{"text":"Best place to order take-out sushi rolls for a quick snack or light dinner - Spicy Salmon and California Rolls are my go-to combination each time! Always ready in about 10-15 min, I usually call in advance so I don't have to wait. Their phone number is on my speed dial."}
{"text":"Excellent Quality  - Great Price.
I went with my girlfriend on a Friday evening, it was packed. Wait was about 10-15min, it was definitely worth the wait. We ordered a small love boat, consisting of many fish that would not be included in the same kind of combo as other restaurants (uni, toro, white tuna). The soy sauce was very good quality along with the freshness of the sashimi. Bill ended up to be about $45 with a side order of spicy salmon roll which my girlfriend loved there. I would recommend Akane."}
{"text":"Out party of 6 came for dinner on a Saturday night.  It was busy but we got a table right away.  There was only 1 server for the whole restaurant when we arrived at prime dinner time 730pm.  Took about 30 mins before we could flag our server to take our order.  Then a second server appeared from the kitchen.  We ordered 2 bento boxes and 1 large sushi boat.  The bento boxes came first.  Our sushi boat came about 30 mins after the bento boxes so 2 in our party were already done eating.  Good thing they didn't wait or their food would have been cold.  The bulgogi in the bento box wasn't very good.  The sushi rolls that came in the boxes were pretty bad too.  The rice was wet.  When our sushi boat came we had asked for 2 small plates - they only gave us 2 and we needed 4.  

During this time, there was an irate customer who was waiting to be seated.  They had a party of 6 as well.  They sat a party of 2 first who came in after them, then when a booth and a table of 4 cleared up next to the recently seated party of 2, the party of 6 wasn't able to sit together.  He was yelling at the server and wrongfully yelling at the table for 2 saying the restaurant seated the mainlanders before them.  This was incredibly rude and uncomfortable for us.  

With all the commotion, they forgot about the 2 plates we asked for.  This is now 1 hr after the rest of our party ate their bento boxes already.  We politely asked for the plates again and the server was obviously agitated.  

After we wolfed down our food as we were starving at this point, took another 20 mins to flag the server down for our ice cream then bill.  This was an almost 3 hr dining experience.  

The food itself was also very off this day.  The uni sushi that came in the boat was rancid.  My cousin almost puked it out.  I couldn't enjoy the rest of my meal with the foul taste in my mouth.  

We have been here once before and it was alright...probably 2.5 star on that day.  But this time...definitely just 1 star.  Will not be returning.  Very reasonably priced, but incredibly slow service and poor quality food."}
{"text":"I have been a regular customer here for at least 6 years. I usually get take out here. It deserves 5 star most of the time but I realized it really depends who is the server that day. The older lady server there has excellent customer service. Meanwhile the younger girls can be confused sometimes. It is better to check your take out order before you leave.

It locates in a busy Chinese strip plaza. The parking lot is busy but they have underground parking and a smaller parking lot at the back. It is a Korean owned sushi shop with above average quality. Their sushi love boat is my favourite. With $48 we get a huge boat which has more pieces that what they listed on the menu(see image)!! It include 2 piece of uni sushi. I had an experience which the substitute with ikura sushi when they ran out of uni. They sometimes give you a freebie like chap chae or fish head. I will keep coming back."}
{"text":"This place used to be my favorite sushi place in the area but after my last visit I was left very disappointed. The quality of their ingredients has definitely dropped. I think ownership may have changed because now there is a scary old lady yelling orders and ushering people in and out at top speed. She comes off a little bit frightening... 
I understand that you would want to maximize the amount of customers, but I felt very rushed and just uncomfortable with the noise level and scurrying of patrons left and right."}
{"text":"One of my go-to-places for sushi takeout. I go there frequently (once/twice a month) and order the sushi love boat A all the time. 

Quality is usually consistent and comes in really good portion size for $40 cash. Sometimes they switch up the sashimi/maki depending on what they have for the day. 

Only caveat is that they're a bit slow, hence why I prefer to takeout instead of sitting in and waiting at least half an hour until the meal is served."}
{"text":"This has been my go to sushi restaurant for many years now, and it really saddens me to see how much the quality and service has worsened in my most recent visit. My husband and I came here on a weekday night for dinner. Both of us had a late lunch at work that day, and weren't very hungry, so we ordered our usual - the Kawartha Combo. The Kawartha combo comes with a Rainbow Roll, Caterpillar Roll and Spicy Salmon Roll. Usually, we would order another item as well, however on nights when we are not that hungry, this combo alone is just the right amount of food. But boy were we disappointed when the rolls were placed on our table. They were so much smaller than what we had gotten in the past! 

In the past, every time we've come here for dinner, we get complimentary miso soup and salad. However, this time, we were not given these. I just assumed that maybe the waitress forgot, so I asked her about it.  And she told me that because the combo I ordered was too cheap, it would not include the soup and salad. I mentioned that in the past, this was not the case, and she told me that this had always been the rule. I hate it when restaurants I've been a loyal customer to lie to me and pretend that I'm the one that doesn't know what I'm talking about. Usually upon getting the bill, the restaurant would also provide complimentary ice cream, but of course, this was not provided this time as well. Also, if the combo we ordered was considered too cheap for both of us, we should have at least gotten one set of miso soup, salad and ice cream, since it definitely should have been more than enough for one person.

Sadly, I will not be coming back here again. And I will need to find a new, reasonably priced sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"4 stars because it is very good value for the quantity and decent quality of food. Of course you don't go in expecting top notch sushi, but for the price you pay, it is a good deal. I would recommend this over sapporo sushi around the corner. This isn't a place I would go to if I want excellent sushi, but it gives you a quick sushi fix. Plus their bento boxes give a nice variety of food. 

Customer service is horrible with the woman basically screaming at me, but I don't go into these restaurants expecting much in terms of service so I didn't mind."}
{"text":"I don't like their toro. I think that's not toro at all. The love boat is great value but tasted ok . One time is enough."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and their lunch sets(size, variety, pricing) was very similar to that of Gal's Sushi on highway 7 and warden. It's a much smaller restaurant in comparison, but for a Sunday lunch it wasn't busy so I'm guessing it's not too hard to get a seat. 

Since it's so similar to Gal's, i'll be basing my review by comparing the two. Portions here were reasonable for the price, but they do charge you $1 to change to salmon, whereas Gal's does not - for me, this put the price up by a bit because i only eat salmon. While the sushi was of comparable quality to gal's, i found the rolls to be worse as the crunchy bits in the spicy salmon roll were not crunchy. What i did really like about Akane Sushi was their soy sauce!! For some reason, it has a hint of sweetness to it that i found different from the store bought soy sauce i usually have at other sushi restaurants. 

To sum it up, I still prefer Gal's over Akane Sushi, but i had a good experience here and wouldnt mind revisiting if i was in Richmond Hill."}
{"text":"Good tempura, good rolls (dragon, california) - a great neighborhood place with good value for money. We go a couple of times a month with the kids for a quick sushi fix. Very nice service. We also bought party platters from them and our guests loved the rolls. 
The only issue I have is that they use far too much mayo -- almost every special roll has mayo in it."}
{"text":"Worst service ever! Came for dinner with my husband and daughter and what ended up happening was we were seated however we were waiting for the server to provide us with menus. As I was sitting I noticed another couple came in and the seated right away. They even got the menus and Auntie before we did! It was as if the server completely forgot that we even existed there period after my husband asked for the menus once again she did not bring them to us. We just got fed up that we decided to leave at the point. As we were leaving the server then brought us the tea and menus and I said to them it was fine. It was actually very disappointing as we did hear good reviews about the food but unfortunately with this experience I can't even give them a fair judgement on their food. I recommend if you were to give them a try best to go on a Monday or Tuesday early evening because it seems that they are short staffed."}
{"text":"Pretty good place for mid tier sushi! Price is reasonable and you get a good variety of stuff. I usually get the love boat A for two people and it comes with a good selection of rolls, sashimi, and sushi. You get some good stuff such as uni and toro for about $40. 

They also always give you free ice cream and appetizers such as japchae. Not the fanciest place but it does satisfy your sushi cravings!"}
{"text":"What are you peeps talking about???!! 
I'm learning on yelp you have to be able to distinguish between yelpers who understand quality and those just looking for a deal.
This place sucks and I'm really surprised with all the positive reviews. Must be yelpers who like the $30 love boat. However when I receive watery sashimi and sloppy rolls... I'm done. Decent service, no smiles... And what's with the jap chae with plastic chopsticks??!!! Impossible to eat.. Anyways I'm just about to get my free ice cream, so hopefully that's not a bust too.
And btw as soon as this gui lau hits highway 7 chaos begins.. Not into fighting with terrible drivers looking for parking spots...
First and last.

Had to edit review...didn't get ice cream and almost tripped on door stop on way out...

Done and doner."}
{"text":"This is a very small Korean family-owned sushi restaurant and I was surprised to see that it was a full house when I stopped by for dinner on Friday. I am happy to say that I've found a go-to sushi place when I don't feel like doing AYCE or breaking the bank. Great quality & quantity!

We ordered the spicy salmon roll ($3.99) which was quite decent. The amount of tempura flakes and level of spice was just right. Not to mention it was a good size. You just can't go wrong if you're a spicy salmon roll lover like me.

The highlight however, is the loveboat. I think every table ordered one because it's the best value. We had Loveboat A ($31.99) which came with uni, sweet shrimp, scallop sashimi AND toro! These items are not only usually very expensive but are rarely included in sushi combos, let alone at that price. Everything tasted pretty fresh and might I also add that the salmon belly was amazing. The meal also comes with a salad, miso soup and complimentary icecream (choice of green tea or mango).   

Another good deal would be the bento boxes. There are three types: lunch which goes for $7.99, all day $10.99 and dinner $13.99.  Can't beat these prices. Good variety and filling!

Parking can be hard to find as the plaza is extremely busy with restaurants galore. The service could definitely be improved and that would be the only complaint I have about this place. We weren't acknowledged for a good 10 minutes and weren't seated until another 15 minutes or so after that. Regardless, it won't stop me from coming back for more cheap but quality sushi!"}
{"text":"It took a while for us to get seated. They were very under staffed. The sushi wasn't really fresh but giving 3 stars for quantity, price and selection."}
{"text":"For the price you pay, the quality of sushi and the fish you get is amazing! This is now my go-to-place for fresh sushi/sashimi takeout for dinners as the quality of the fish and sushi is always consistent and superb!

I found this restaurant under the recommendation of a friend and I really do feel the prices are extremely generous for the food you can get. Their rolls are also AMAZING - extremely delicious and the proportions are huge! If you are a sashimi/sushi lover, I definitely recommend getting the lover's boat."}
{"text":"I found this place based on a recommendation from a friend. IT is a little a la carte family restaurant, run by a korean family i believe. I really enjoyed this place. i went here for both dinner and lunch as well. i find they are the perfect kind of sushi joint i like, which is not the cheapest or the most expensive but delivers a good bang for your buck. The first time we came here we ordered a Love boat, it had quite a bit of sushi and sashimi to pick from. the variety was pretty good, and both me and my wife were very happy with it. We had also ordered a shrimp tempura separate. and the tempura was very good. it was done in the old school way. which was with patients, and the batter was very light and crispy. 

I have also been to this place for lunch and ordered a bento box, which included quite a few things, in sushi and tempura. and was a decent quantity and quality for the price you pay. it seems this place is popular relatively with local people as i see they are relatively full most of the time. although not so much that you need to worry about not finding a seat. 

I would highly recommend people to try this if they don't want to eat a all you can sushi place, and just want some a la carte that is great bang for buck. this place to me is better then GAL sushi which is the bigger and more popular joint along highway 7."}
{"text":"This is my favourite Sushi place.   It's a small Korean family run Sushi bar and with a cozy sit in, which this location was formerly owned by Gal Sushi (moved to Warden & 7).  

The quality of the fish is top notch, fresh served at the right temperature (not frozen, not room temp).  Their Maki rolls are skillfully put together with some creativity with their carb reduced rice-less rolls; Sunflower Roll, ask for their spicy sauce.  Delicous.

My favourite orders are the Sushi Love Boat, Sushi / Maki / Sashimi Combo, Udon & Tempura & SunFlower Roll.   

Price is very reasonable. 

Customer service is great and friendly, although sometimes hard to communicate with the older lady.  I'm a regular there, and she has some bonuses (extra large Chap Chae or sometimes a grilled Salmon head)."}
{"text":"The service here is super friendly, its a little family owned business, i used to come here for lunch take out, cause its near my work and the lunch special are amazingly priced. from $7-$9 (take-out is tax included) now that it changed it's name; everything is still the same, still an awesome lunch! my favorite is the L4, the sashimi was always fresh, the rolls are always a different combination and it's delicious! I'd definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I dropped in this evening without reservations on my own to taste this 4 star Yelp rated Sushi place. First of all they made me wait 5 minutes at the door while they looked after a take out customer. Then the woman maitre dis approached me and when I asked for a table for 1 she would only agree to seat me at a table right beside the single (not double cause the 2nd door is held wide open) front door on this -12C night while the rest of the restaurant was basically empty. So much for Akane sushi, I won't be back"}
{"text":"Thanks Yelp, you definitely didn't disappoint. This place is awesome; the sushi was delicious and the value was amazing. 

We came here for lunch. My parents wanted the lunch bento boxes but I had heard way too many good things about the love boats so I had to lobby them to get a love boat. It was the best decision ever. We got the love boat B, 60 pieces for $60 but I swear there was way more than 60 pieces. Apparently the jacked up the prices but it's still worth it. As you keep on eating there's still tons of sushi left! What was even better was the selection in that love boat..ebi, tako, herring, uni, unagi whattt. Sushi/sashimi/rolls, this boat has it all. I really liked that spicy salmon crunch roll in the boat, I will definitely come back to try their special rolls. We got some complimentary rolls for the love boat as well. We left absolutely stuffed and we were famished when we first came.

We came with four people, clearly the love boat said it was for three but we still got an extra soup and salad (for a total of four). Plus there was complimentary jap chae, and ice cream at the end. Service was on point;  prompt and  extremely friendly. 

This place is awesome! Come here for the love boats and you won't be disappointed, I don't think it's possible."}
{"text":"First of all, the price was definitely good, $36 after tax for 4 rolls (Akane combo roll-blue mountain, Alaska, dynamite, spicy salmon) 

The rolls were all huge, the only thing weird was that, the rolls were really oily. The salmon and blue mountain were my favorites, but they were messy to eat. Both of these rolls had a lot of sauce and crunch bits, very very oily. Tasty when you are eating the sushi, but awful feeling after, would not try again."}
{"text":"As an Elite Yelper, I usually don't give 'one-star' ratings. But if it weren't for the okay food at this place, I would be providing a big round ZERO if it was available but alas there is no such value in the rating system. For starters, the place is small and tight so it really isn't comfortable for large groups. Next, they only have two individuals working the tables and the two aren't so friendly. Their command of the English language is poor. I'm sorry but this is the GTA and not Seoul, Korea. Next, the tables are not cleaned that well and we had to ask for at least two new glasses of water due to the fact that they had particles of something in the first two glasses. Not clean at all. Funny thing is that at least a few other tables had 'issues' with their service. I certainly am one to NEVER EVER EVER go back. Plus the parking is just bleah. Not plentiful. Sorry. This place fails in my books."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and both times I had loveboat A. This was shared between me and 2 other girls. We also ordered an udon to share one time. The amount of sushi and sashimi is the right amount and we are super satisfied each time. The variety of fish is good and most importantly it is fresh. I absolutely love the fatty salmon that just melts in your mouth.  Oh!  Did I mention that uni is included? So bomb.. Lol thinking of the boat just makes me crave sushi. The udon was alright but doesn't compare with the sushi/sashimi.
Be sure to have patience as the sushi restaurant is rather small. The restaurant's parking lot is also shared by a number of restaurants in the plaza... So be prepared.. It is worth it!!

If you are looking for good value,  this is also the place!"}
{"text":"Comes up under the AYCE search but it isn't and at 5:30 there wasn't one customer. Maybe that's why?"}
{"text":"Akane never ceases to amaze me. It has the best quality of sushi for reasonable prices. Presentation is nice. Service is very good no matter how busy it was. We went for dinner at 7pm. 

Food came in a timely manner with complementary japjae which was good as well.

It is a nice family owned restaurant. Their special rolls were delicious and on the love boat has a variety of sushi and sashimi with higher tiered fish. 

Would definitely recommend to come back as it was my second visit and quality and service was exceptional both times."}
{"text":"In terms of value, this is one of my favorite sushi places. For $32 me and my bf got a boat with over 34 pieces of sushi and sashimi including uni, scallop, and salmon belly(yum) 

Service is friendly and you get free salad, glass noodles, soup and ice cream at the end.

Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"This has been my favorite sushi place. Whenever I come I always order they boat which comes with sushi and sashimi. They're fish are always fresh and they charge a very decent price. They start you off with a complentary miso soup and salad, following they gave us a big plate of glass noodles as we waited. Sometimes waiting times are longer, but for sure less than 20mins, because there's only one sushi master making all the orders. There are no other place comparable to the quality of food and the price. I highly recommend it to my friends. Servers are very friendly and polite too. They also give you a choice of ice cream to end your meal. They don't kick you out once they close, we were able to sit an hour after they were close."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I have to deduct a star for the service.  Food is good.  We ordered a 100pcs sushi and roll combo.  Very fresh sushi and sashimi indeed.  The sushi rolls were all good.  We ordered separately an Ultimate Roll.  It got soft shell, crab meat, cucumber and shrimps etc.  The roll was huge and was super delicious.  We also had veggie tempura.  Food was absolutely up to standard.  However, the service could be more welcome and attentive.  

Our group enjoyed our good time and food since this was a farewell dinner for our kickboxing instructor despite of the impatient service.  Some of our buddies were absolutely disappointed with the service.  I felt bad for the only woman there serving the whole dining room by herself on a Sunday busy dinner hours.  I totally understand the stress.  She finally gave us a true smile after we paid our bill.  Blessed:)"}
{"text":"Terrible service, I came here today with my family for the long weekend. We had 6 people with us, we ordered a Sushi boat. We started eating, 10 minutes in the waitress came to our table and told us she needs to remove a table and have one of us sit on the side. I found that really rude especially since we started eating. She should have done that before we ordered. The WORSE part is that we made reservations too so this isn't a walk in. I will NEVER come back here again. The food is a 4/10, my stomach has been really gassy an hour after eating this sushi. SERVICE IS BEYOND TERRIBLE! I RECOMMEND YOU NOT TO COME HERE YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED!!"}
{"text":"Came here with a group of 6 adults & 2 kids.
It's a pretty small restaurant, so a table of 8 already took up almost 1 full wall area. Our original table was next to the sushi bar. But it was quite tight for all of us to sit there. A table behind us left, and we asked if it was ok to switch to the wall table. At first she was saying isn't this one better? Pointing at our original table. But we explained it was a bit tight and the wall one was a bit more spacious. She said we have other reservations but the was no one standing at the door, and we explained that we also made reservation as well. So she said ok and tried to quickly clean the table but didn't do it thoroughly. We were also missing 2 sets of dishware...and we asked several times and they didn't understand what we wanted..only gave us a extra part of chopsticks.... :\ 

Also the 2 cups of cold water we received had particles floating in it...One had 1 black speck and the other one looked like water calcium flake.

They were totally under staffed. Only 2 mid-aged Korean ladies worked all the tables. And their English wasn't very well. We ordered the 108 pcs Love Boat Sushi Sashimi and the lady heard wrong and gave us the 40 pc one instead. We didn't realize it until we ate it all and said huh? That was 108 pcs??? Told the lady and she insist that we told her we wanted the 40 pcs..but we told them no 40 pcs is only for 2 ppl we have more than 2 ppl, why would we ordered that one. So she said ok and got us 108 pcs. They did apologize and gave us 2 Free Grilled Salmon Heads. 

But when the bill came they charged us for both 40 pcs and 108 pcs Love Boat. One of the lady told us you ordered both so you have to pay both.......but we ordered the 108 pcs and never asked for the 40 pcs....so they recalculated the bill and gave it back to us...but the total was even more than before?????? Ok so what is going on here?? The lady came back and said sorry sorry this is wrong bill and gave us another one...

And I was also eavesdropping other tables were also complaining about the service.

I feel for them because they really need to hire more ppl that can communicate well in English. Save both the customers and business owner's headaches. 

Their food was good though, just the service needed to be improved on."}
{"text":"This is the second time since a year ago. The last time the sashimi was too thin but this time was much better. The service is very good and it didn't take long for the food."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Waited 30 min and nobody offered water or take order. Only one middle age lady taking order, deliver food, doing the cash and taking phone call for take out order. Lots of customers waiting by the door and they don't even care."}
{"text":"I've been to Akane several times now, it's a small little place among a strip of other restaurants. Seating is usually easy enough to get, but parking can be annoying.

I really like the bento boxes here. The fish slices are cut generously and taste fresh, and they have several combination options to combine with other things. Price is good too. This time, I ordered a Unagi + Sashimi combo bento box. It comes with miso soup and salad. Filling and very tasty. There's also ice-cream at the end.

Price is great. Will come back again when in the mood for some sushi and in the area."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this more since it seemed like a nice mom & pop establishment, and it was pretty cheap, but I guess you get what you pay for. I was on a lunch break at a conference so I didn't have a ton of time to get lunch, could't find the restaurant I was trying to find, and stumbled across this place.

First of all, if you're in a hurry, this place is super fast (I ordered sashimi, in hopes for minimal prep work). By the time I had taken my credit card and paid, my food was ready. It was faster than getting take-out at McDonalds.

I got a sashimi lunch special for $8, which came with glass noodles, deep fried (but cold) tofu with a drizzle of some sauce, white rice, 15 pieces of sashimi, 3 pieces of California roll, and 3 pieces of a spicy tuna or spicy salmon roll. That's a lot of food for $8 - probably what you'd pay at a fast food place, but much healthier.

The fish was fine, but didn't seem overly fresh to me. It wasn't the kind that melts in your mouth, but it wasn't something that made me want to keep eating more and more. The tofu was cold, oily, and seemed like it had been made hours ago, so I didn't eat it (and I like anything deep fried). The spicy salmon / tuna roll was fine but the rice was kind of dry. Noodles were fine, but nothing exciting.

Also, per the other reviews, i expected to get miso soup & salad, but didn't get anything. This place is fine if you're craving sushi and don't want to spend a lot of money. But I think I'll be taking my business elsewhere, with so many other sushi places to go to."}
{"text":"Great place for reasonably priced sushi! Fresh and good quality sushi, sashimi and maki. Big menu with lots of options including Korean dishes. They have lunch and all day bentos which is a great deal. Also great party trays and our go to is the love boats because they come with premium fish like uni, ika, scallops, and sweet shrimps."}
{"text":"I used to come here often.  The sushi and sashimi is fairly fresh and has never disappointed. The meals come with the usual miso soup and salad with the sweet and sour dressing. For the price you're paying it is extremely good value.  However, the service tends to be very slow at this restaurant due to lack of staff.  If you are coming on weekends expect there to be a wait (usually 15-30 minutes).  The spicy salmon roll is one of the items on the menu with the best value."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite sushi restaurants! You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu. The sashimi is super fresh! The rolls are proportionate not too much rice or too little ingredients. I have ordered their bento boxes many times. They have great lunch bentos as well as dinner bentos at reasonable prices. I have also ordered their Sashimi/Sushi combos for larger parties and they are great! 

Some of my favorite things about this place is.. 
1. Quality of Food- Sashimi is super duper fresh! 
2. Service is awesome! 
3. Value- one of our favorite roll is their Spicy Salmon roll $3.99!!! The roll is stuffed with spicy salmon in the middle and on top!  I also love their Salmon Sashimi Roll- the roll itself does not have any rice component but instead it is wrapped with a layer of rice paper and large piece of salmon sashimi for $7.99. I would describe this roll similar to a California roll with salmon sashimi replacing the rice. The combination of avocado, crab sticks, and salmon just goes so well together! It's like an explosion of freshness in your mouth. 

I have been coming here for over a year now and still enjoy coming here to treat myself to some awesome sushi."}
{"text":"Quite a decent little sushi place located right along Hwy 7 in the Chalmers gate plaza. As you drive along Hwy 7 you can see it's big red sign.

The workers inside were all work no play, as in they were not the friendliest, but they did their job with quick effectiveness.

My wife and I got a \"love boat\" with 40 pieces mix of sushi, sashimi and roll. It also comes with soup, salad, jap chae, ice cream (mango or green tea) and your main meal.

The love boat is just enough for 2 people, just right. Not too full, not left hungry. The rolls were quite creamy, in a good way. Not overly \"chunky\", things were finely diced and minced.

The sashimi pieces were a tad on the small side, pretty well cut and not too sinewy.

Sushi pieces were well proportioned, a smidge too much rice, but still well proportioned. 

The uni was surprisingly very tasty, a clean taste with little to no odd after taste.

The place is a bit small so I can see this place filling up quickly, so you may want to come early.

Funny thing to note, the love boat was meant for 2 people and every piece of sushi is evenly portioned. So 4 salmon sashimi, 4 salmon sushi, 2 uni sushi, 8 pieces spicy salmon etc. So each person gets a \"fair\" potion.

It's overall a very nice sushi meal, definitely date worthy."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Fresh and great quality. Attentive staff. Best spicy Salmon rolls ever! Price is extremely reasonable."}
{"text":"First off: $4.99 Spicy Salmon Roll. Secondly: $30 loveboat

Do i have your attention yet?

Their LOVEBOATwas SO worth it and I wholeheartedly encourage everyone to get it.
$31.99 and it included fresh uni, scallop, toro, yellowtail, salmon belly and ika!! Absolutely beautiful in presentation and tasted fantastic (and fresh!). Note: the loveboat also includes a large plate of japchae (Korean glass noodles), soup and salad. 

We naiively ordered a SPICY SALMON ROLL ($4.99) on top of the loveboat. Big mistake - we were STUFFED and had to get it in a doggy bag. The size of the roll was huge ! Like Frank L., we easily could have eaten two and been full.

The staff was extremely friendly :)

For the price, you really can't complain. I will most definitely be back !!"}
{"text":"It has always been my go to place for sushi.  Today, as I was waiting for my takeout, I saw one of their sushi chef took a picture of the party tray he made with \"bare\" hands, wiped his hands on his pants, then went back cutting sashimi. I was so grossed out....  Well..I still think this is one of the best sushi places in Richmond Hill, I'm just hoping the restaurant will see this post and improve their measure of sanity."}
{"text":"I had really high expectations with all the high reviews but sadly those expectations fell a bit short. Came on a Saturday evening at 6:00pm and the restaurant was almost maxed out of seats. Mind you this restaurant is very small and seats about 36 individuals if my count was correct. I believe this is a family run Japanese restaurant run by Koreans. There were a total of 4 workers: one in the back kitchen, 2 dedicated to making sushi and 1 waitress. People who came after us complained that they made reservations and still could not get a set.

Service was extremely slow and clumsy. We didn't get tea until we asked for some and they forgot the wasabi for our sushi boat. I felt sorry for the waitress because she had to deal with taking orders, serving, cleaning and taking complaints from upset customers waiting.

We ordered the largest boat on the menu which had about 90 assorted pieces of sashimi/sushi for $65. Meals come with salad and miso soup with ice cream as dessert. This massive boat fed the 4 of us and we were quite full by the end of our meal. For $65 I found the price to be lower than most other places. A good bargin for what you get. The presentation of the boats were very nice and this was actually the main reason that convinced me to visit. 

I really liked the miso soup as it was not overly salty. The cuts of salmon were very large and thick and was quite fresh. The boat also had tuna, red snapper, shrimp, scallop, BBQ eel, squid and uni. The uni was really small and wasn't fresh at all. It had a strong fishy taste. I was pretty sad about this because looking at all the pictures posted it seemed pretty decent. 

Overall a pretty decent Japanese restaurant."}
{"text":"Sushi is really fresh. Quick service. Friendly. Reasonable prices. Tastes amazing. One of the best sushi houses in GTA."}
{"text":"This area up in Richmond Hill is a tough one for restaurants because of the vast variety of Chinese, Sushi, Hot pot, Korean that you have to compete against.  

I've eaten many of the local places and wanted to try a new sushi restaurant.  The evening I came here there was no one else in the restaurant.  I found it a bit odd for Tuesday night but this has never scared me.  

Looking over the menu they have all the usual variety's.  One thing I noticed about the menu was the big selection of affordable bento's available!  So I ordered a Sakura Bento as I thought some of the others were smaller for a lunch, and I was here for dinner.  

Bento came with a typical green salad and miso.  Salad was nice.  Your usual green salad.  Soup was nice and light.  Not too much wakame or tofu but the broth was done well, not too salty!  

As my Bento was being prepared they had a few fresh tanks and some interesting flat fish in the bottom tank.  I asked the lady who was my server and she mentioned it was Halibut.  She said \"very good as sushi\"!  I thought they were quite small for Halibut but hey, I've never seen one pulled from the ocean!  

Bento came out and was very fresh and taste and texture was great!  

To wash it down I enjoyed some nice mango ice cream.  

Superb sushi at very reasonable prices!"}
{"text":"Overall I'm not impressed, sushi here is good (not great), it's cheap, but the portions here are unfortunately smaller than what I'm used to, plus the sizes for the spicy salmon rolls are cut quite unevenly which can get annoying...however the service is just ABSOLUTELY HORRENDOUS!!

I went here to order takeout sushi today on my way back from the doctors and as I was paying, I asked to pay with my credit card since I had NO cash on hand. That's when the problem started, their credit/debit machine wasn't working and so they spent about an hour and half trying to fix it which meant that I had to wait that long just for takeout, till I could finally pay and get out. Now I'm a pretty patient person, but waiting that long was just ridiculous...and unfortunately I didn't have a car so I couldn't drive out to a nearby bank and withdraw some money, which would've been much faster btw, than having to wait on them. Also while they were trying to fix their machine, they never actually told me that it wasn't working, I came to that conclusion myself when I saw them struggling to fix it by taking it apart and calling to figure out what the problem was, but it would've been nice for them to at least directly tell me what was going on instead of just basically ignoring me like that.

Finally when they did get the machine working, I was able to paid with my credit and handed me my food. However, they never apologized to me for the long wait and inconvenience. They basically acted as though nothing happened...it was unbelievable. I wasn't really expecting a discount or anything to compensate, even though it would've been nice and would've made me a lot less pissed off, but c'mon not even an apology for the long wait/inconvenience? Are they serious? How could they pretend like nothing happened?  SO RUDE! Never coming back here again, there are sushi places out there with tastier sushi, friendlier/talkative staff and MUCH BETTER service, go there instead or else you'll regret it."}
{"text":"Heard some good things about this place.  Today was okay I guess.  Service was okay.  Food was okay.  Nothing spectacular.  They korean owners were speaking super loud to each other.   They weren't yelling at each other tho, but it made the experience a little less enjoyable.  The food...what's the best way to put it...you get what you pay for? Nothing special.  Prices are good for a cheap meal.  But flavours don't pop.  Not very memorable.  I'll pass next time."}
{"text":"3.5/5, +.5 for service

In terms of sushi fish I will rate it around 3 stars, but I'm adding .5 for the price factor, and another .5 for excellent service.

This a la carte sushi is probably one of the few places that successfully combined sub-$10 lunch specials and great quality sushi fish, rolls, soup, and salad, among others. For $7.99 I ordered the sushi lunch box, which consisted of a salad, miso soup, 8 pieces of sushi, 6 rolls, japchae, and lightly fried tofu. I've been to sushi places charging $12 for lunch specials and I've gotten worse quality sushi fish, and less items in general! 

The salad and soup were great, not too strong on the dressing or the salt/MSG content in the soup. The sushi pieces were huge; could've done with less rice but the fish was as I said great quality given the price. So were the rolls! The japchae I've had better, but at least it wasn't those warm ones I've had in other restaurants. Finally the tofu didn't taste like anything, but it is tofu after all...don't expect much of a taste to it.

Service was excellent, and the waitresses informed us the food will take a while due to a massive party tray order that came in before us. We were fine with that; it was a Saturday late morning and we weren't in too much of a rush.

Sad all the decent sushi places are in Richmond Hill now. Markham needs to step up; you lost Toro and Sakana-ya in the past 3 months!"}
{"text":"I have always went to Sapporo sushi which is in the same plaza and thought I give this place a try, reminder to self, stay with Sapporo from now on

This place has a lot of variety with a lot of bento box selections but quality wise, it isn't up to par with Sapporo
Service is kind of slow here since they only had one waiter to cater for so many tables 

We ordered the sashimi and eel dinner box, eel was not bad but the sashimi just didn't taste fresh too me, it wasn't fully sliced either...we also got the white Christmas roll which was a disasterrrrrrrrr to pick up, it falls apart immediate in Gravity, we were not aware that it had no rice and was substituted with fake crab meat, it tasted horrible and cost $11 bucks for that crap

Maybe we picked the wrong items or something but I'm sticking with Sapporo"}
{"text":"So to start off I would come here at least once a week. And it was my fave go to spot.

The service sucks, lets be honest. but the food was good and the price was even better.


I went there and now they changed the menu's, price's went up for somethings almost double (spicy salmon rolls). So i ask her, oh why did you guys change the menus and the prices went up? she gets offended and starts yelling at me in Korean, why am I asking these question?

Anyways food was the exact same, just a new menu (new prices). Used to cost me 17$ with tax and tip now I paid 31$. For that price Id rather go to KAKA down the street and have the best Torched sushi and white tuna i have ever tasted."}
{"text":"The quality of sushi can be a hit or miss depending on the traffic that day. Sometimes when they get busy the sashimi is poorly cut and other times its melt in your mouth goodness. Don't expect any type of service, you won't get any. Their take out party trays are almost identical to the ones offered at Gal's sushi. The price is slightly lower, but the quality can vary. If you order a day in advance you will receive a box of japchae. It's a decent place but I wouldn't travel out of my way for this sushi joint."}
{"text":"This place is extremely understaffed and I, as the customer should not have to take the staff's attitude for it.

I used to frequent this place weekly, mostly during the weekend lunch bentos and dinner sushi trays..but have not gone back since two horrific experiences.

The sushi here is decent and very reasonably priced but the serice is just ridiculous.

During weekends and weekday evenings, this place place is usually a full house, with one staff waiting all the tables.

On one busy weekend around noontime, my boyfriend and I came here and ordered two bento boxes, after waiting over 10 minutes to get the menu and having someone take my order. The waitress (usually the only one, an older korean lady) was running back and forth serving customers and trying to clean tables, it got to the point where a table was not cleared after half an hour of a customer leaving.

All meals are served with salad and miso soup, in this case, I got my sushi box first, then subsequently had two bowls of miso soup thrown onto the table, never got my salad. When the waitress walked by again, I requested for some spicy mayo on the side, as I always do...rudely, she shook her head (acknowledging that she heard my request) but proceeded to ignore me, I never got what I asked for.

Ever since that last experience, I promised myself to never come here again. There is another sushi restaurant in the same plaza, Sapporo sushi, they will be getting my business from now on."}
{"text":"Akane is amazing!

Love boats starting from $30 (includes uni and toro) how could you go wrong? Also included with each meal is miso soup, salad, korean japchae noodles and ice cream.I probably come here once a week and everything always tastes so fresh and consistent. 

Staff is friendly but service can be slow at times since there are only two waitresses. They do offer free dishes at times which I guess makes up for the slow service."}
{"text":"I tried this place with my boyfriend tonight and we've already decided it will be our new regular sushi spot! 

We got dinner bento boxes D6 (sashimi and tempura) and D12 (sashimi and unagi don - grilled eel on rice). Each bento box came with salad, miso soup, japchae, crispy tofu, rice, a california roll AND ice cream! 

Overall the food was VERY plentiful (we were both stuffed before we could even finish our boxes) and quite tasty - the only thing I was less impressed with was the crispy tofu which was a little less than crispy. 

The service itself was a little lacking - the waitresses were really really nice and friendly but they forgot the modifications I made to my order (double japchae rather than rice and all salmon sashimi) but were more than happy to fix the bento box when I reminded them. It was also a little hard to get their attention to order. 

The value of the meal was probably our favourite part - the bento boxes were only $13.99 and included everything mentioned above. 

We'll definitely be back - and often."}
{"text":"Came back on 2/19/2016 around 2:30Pm, sad to update that the menu and pricing changed.  The sushi and sashimi combine A and B are no longer the same.  We got the 40 pieces Love Boat for two but the sashimi are half the size now and not as fresh."}
{"text":"I always come here because they have a huge variety and I love the prices for the all day bento box which is 10.99. Lunch boxes are 8.99 and the dinner boxes are 13.99. The service here isn't the best but it isn't the worst either. The interior is really casual but a very comfortable atmosphere. All the bentos Comes with miso soup and green salad. At the end of your meal you get a complimentary dessert of your choice of mango or green tea ice cream. The sashimi is fresh and the sushi is decent. I always find my way back here because of their low prices!"}
{"text":"Great love boat for two, fresh sushi, sashimi, uni and unagi sushi. Roll was soso, nothing special there. I was still hungry after what we ate which was the down part. Sashimi they use is pretty good, amaebi, scallop, some unique fishes too. The ambiance of the place isnt that great so is service. Food is outstanding!"}
{"text":"Big fan of Akane as a take-out Sushi joint. The portions are generous, the prices are very fair and the quality of Sushi is pretty good. It's not going to compare to some of the more upscale, dine-in options in Richmond Hill, but it's the perfect place to order a take-home boat for two so you can hang around and watch Netflix. I'd advise you to make sure you're familiar with the different varieties of fish ahead of placing an order for a platter or boat, because this isn't a salmon & tuna sushi place. You can expect to see a great variety, including scallop, shrimp, squid, mackerel, snapper, etc."}
{"text":"This is our favourite sushi spot. Really great quality sashimi for a very reasonable price. We love going here.  The staff are also very friendly. They have really good green tea and mango ice cream here."}
{"text":"Best thing about this place are the prices and the quality. Perfect.

I've been trying to cut out rice, or at least find places with good brown rice sushi. This chef comes up with the 'well-being' roll. No rice, just packed with salmon, avocado, and either soft shell crab, tempura shrimp, or more salmon. Plus, the proper veggies. It's just a mouthful of awesomeness.

The roll was so epic that I couldn't finish the rest of my order. Need to come back here. Need to bring lots of friends."}
{"text":"Their English is limited. They messed up 4 times. The food is good but hire ppl who speak English. No more. Never again. Very disappointed. How do you mess up 4 times?!?!?!"}
{"text":"Dunno if it's because I came at 3:30pm a very late lunch! I was one of two tables of one so maybe the main sushi chef was on break but the young sushi guy that did my L1sushi, sashimi bento box set was kinda wishy washy! The salon sashimi tasted fresh but upon pickup with my chopsticks the salmon weren't even fully sliced! I have never had almost sliced sashimi before! Lazy knife work chef! And the sushi, oh how the rice crumbled upon pick up! C'mon even AYCE sushi they stay together! The rice that came with the bento box was barely a tablespoon size! I will be in the area a lot so might give it one more go (since this place have such good reviews!) before giving up! Hope it's just am off day!"}
{"text":"Friday is usually sushi night!  There's about 10 Japanese/Korean places in Markham/Richmond Hill area that we like to rotate.  We called around yesterday - Sushi Aoi, Oyaji were both full, Inaho was closed on vacation, and Mi-Ne and Haru were two that we have been recently so I decided with Akane.  Also, we didn't want all you can eat places since I was craving for higher quality sashimi and going to Yutaka/Yuzu/Japango was a little too far from home.

We have always enjoyed the bento boxes at Akane which are really good value.  But it was never a place that stood out for me.   It was always just ok since we always selected the boxes.  But after reading the Yelp reviews, there were lots of compliments on the Love Boat B (63 pieces) for only $62.99 so we order this.  This was a really good combo which had lots of sashimi, sushi and 3 specialty rolls.  I'm sure that there were more than 63 pieces!  The salmon sashimi and the rolls were delicious.  I really liked the shrimp and scallop sashimi which were really sweet!  There were a few sashimi pieces which I think was hamachi was a little fishy which we didn't like.  But overall, other than that, everything else on the boat was delicious.  It also included 3 Uni sushi(Sea urchin) but I asked them to substitute the 2 Uni for salmon instead.  Both my husband and daughter are not big fans of Uni.  I'm not crazy about it either but I'll keep eating it because I think that I'll appreciate it one day!

The Love Boat dish definitely won me over and we'll likely be back if we want just sushi!"}
{"text":"This sushi restaurant is really good when you want a quick bite of sushi. The staff here are super friendly. I usually order a bento at lunch or all day bento which all has generous/just right to make you full portions. If I'm feeling like having a share platter for 2-3 people the love boat is a perfect size to get everyone full. I love how with the bento boxes they offer you soup to begin with and ice cream after to end with! Good local sushi restaurant overall :) Sushi is portioned right with just enough rice:fish ratio."}
{"text":"Tldr: Wide selection of a la carte and bento box options, great quality at reasonable price. Would recommend

Akane is a solid place for quality bento boxes and a la carte sushi options. When i'm not feeling the AYCE route for sushi, i will usually come here for my sushi fix. What i like about this place is the wide selection of bento box specials (Lunch, All day, and Dinner) at an affordable price. There's pretty much a box for any combination of sushi, sashimi, and tempura. With whichever box you get, it comes with soup, salad, rice, japchae, and a couple of pieces from a simple roll (It will be California, spicy salmon, or dynamite depending on the type of box you get). You can't beat the price for the quantity and quality of fish that is offered at Akane. 

The service is ok. Not the worst, but not the greatest either. The waiters may look somewhat rude at times, and will rush the bill to you when the place gets busy. The interior is not that big, so i would suggest making reservations if you want to minimize wait times. Food comes at a reasonable time, and i'm pretty full when i walk out. Overall, i think Akane is a great place that will satisfy your sushi cravings while keeping your wallet happy. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Can never go wrong with this place, always get the bento box, sashimi is pretty fresh and the service is great. Feels like a small mom and pop kinda restaurant, the place looks great though. They do cheap out on a few things like rice but they make it up for thick pieces of sashimi"}
{"text":"This place IMHO is great for reasonably priced maki, sushi, sashimi, and bento boxes. They've picked their niche - reasonable quality of food at an affordable price. The ratio of value for the money at this place is solid. I usually order a $14 shrimp tempura salmon sashimi bento box and it's as good as it gets for $14. Really great value for the money, even though I'm paying $1 extra for all salmon sashimi.

They're maki and sashimi are alright. Nothing to write home about. The salmon they serve is probably farm-raised as opposed to wild salmon, but 6 pieces as part of the $14 combo is a great deal as far as I'm concerned.

The service is great. The Korea ladies working there are very friendly and courteous, even though they barely speak any English. I have no complaints about service whatsoever.

There are a ton of more expensive and better Japanese restaurants in the 1km radius, sure. However, if you want affordable Japanese food without too much of a dent to your bank account, Akane is a pretty good choice."}
{"text":"ordered a sushi boat to share for 2. it was more or less what i expected of a little sushi shop. nothing that blew me away. good variety though. it wasn't great, but it wasn't bad. i'd eat here again."}
{"text":"It is the best and my favourite sushi restaurant in Toronto! Prices are affordable and sashimi is always fresh! The only thing to notice is that, if you want to get a take out at weekend, call at least an hour earlier. The store is always so busy!"}
{"text":"It is tough finally writing a review for Akane because I want to keep this my wife and I's little secret.  Judging by how busy this place sometimes gets, I feel like others are doing the same.  Akane deserves a lot more praise then it is getting.  

This is a small family run business and it serves some of the freshest and tastiest fish around.  This has been my wife and I's go to place as it is very reasonably priced and we always get great service.

Onto the food:

Akane has lunch and dinner bento box specials that will satisfy most for under $10 for lunch and $12 for dinner.  But what my wife and I always get is their sushi/sashimi boat.

We get the small one for I believe $32.99 and we are never able to finish it.

I believe the menu states that it's 40 pieces or something, but we always get a lot more than that.  The variety changes depending on what they have on hand but it is always delicious.  The variety of fish is fantastic ranging from your typical salmon and tuna.  It includes: sea urchin, scallop, squid, octopus, hamachi, salmon belly, sweet shrimp, toro at times and other varieties that I don't know the names to.  It definitely is not your boring boat you normally get at some places.  It would be hard pressed to find a better deal in this city than this boat.  Best part, free ice cream to finish off the meal.  

Service is always friendly and they even remember the fact that we like some spicy mayo on the side for our rolls and bring it to us without asking.

It's about time this Mom and Pop shop gets some recognition even though I likely would have to share my secret with more people.  

Go try them, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is another non ayce sushi place so quality is better. The sushimi is fresh and the sushi rice is made delicious. The price for a sushi lunch is not bad. Spicy Salmon is one of the best dish if you want to get that. The key to good sushi is freshness and they got it down correctly. This is now my new go to place for lunch."}
{"text":"Drawn here for the Sushi Boat for 2 for $30 and the promise of 2 uni nigiri, hamachi and salmon belly and about 40 pieces in total of sushi, nigiri or rolls - on paper a potential great deal. But you get what you pay for. Low grade quality fish, paper thin sashimi and hard rice. 

The waiter and chef were extremely nice however and I would come back for them sure why not? But the food is not good enough to draw me back. Perhaps really desirable once upon a time... but not anymore."}
{"text":"Akane Sushi replaced Gal Sushi (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/gal-sushi-richmond-hill#hrid:IGzihCfV3RYY_5fy-mpFJA/src:self). Nothing much has change, since the \"New\"  Korean owner just stuck the new name over the old one.. and now they ready for business!! 

Menus has been reprinted. It changed a little but the lunch menu is similar as before, but there are a lot of new rolls available (see photos). 

I was the only one here for early lunch as I got quick, fast and friendly services! The Sushi and Sashimi lunch I order is quite standard and taste quite fresh too.. and for $7.99 that includes soup and salad is an excellent value! 

They have all day specials Bento box for $9.95... so even if you cannot make it for lunch, drop by for dinner and give it a try!"}
{"text":"Been a regular at this place for years! Their lunch bentos are a great value ($9.99 and has tons of food), but I think this place is most popular for their love boats ($39.99). Their love boats have maki, nigiri and sashimi, and have expensive ingredients such as uni, unagi, scallops, and sweet shrimp. Have recommended this place to lots of friends and they all love it."}
{"text":"Amazing sushimi, and rolls. Good quality sushi, and cute spot to eat. But TERRIBLE service over the phone"}
{"text":"Called in to order a large platter (100 pieces) and hung up on me. Told them ready for pickup in 30 minutes which they agreed to but when going in, told us to wait an extra 10-15mins, When going in to pick up the platter, I asked for extra ginger and wasabi and refused to give it."}
{"text":"A solid takeout place for sushi party trays. I feel like because they're always so busy with takeout orders, the service can seem lacking for people who are dining there especially on weekends. But their sushi and sashimi have always been fresh every time I order and they're very timely with the orders.

Thankfully I rather just order to go and eat in the comfort of my own home while watching Netflix."}
{"text":"This is an amazing sushi restaurant!! I go here literally at least once a week. First, the prices are incredible, especially their lunch bento boxes. I always get their sashimi box, which is only $7.99 and the portions are great! As well, the sushi is super fresh and the service is incredibly fast. Right after you finish your miso soup and salad, your meal is usually already served. Not to mention, the lady there is so sweet and friendly! I always feel full and satisfied after dining there and I would recommend it to anyone looking for quick and delicious Japanese cuisine. To sum it up, this small sushi restaurant offers fast and friendly service, fresh taste, delicious flavours all at an incredible cost. You have to try it!"}
{"text":"This place is a little difficult to get to if you're coming from the West end and are trying to avoid the 407. Google maps told me to make a U-turn at Saddlecreek Drive but I turned left onto South Park Road and into the plaza Akane was in which was way easier.

After seeing a bunch of delicious pictures on Yelp about this place I decided to finally make my way out here. My friend and I were trying to decide between \"Love Boat B\" (63 pieces) for $62.99 and the \"Sushi, Sashimi, Roll\" platter (66 pieces) for $59.99. Love Boat B had uni, hamachi, toro, unagi so we chose that. This platter also came with soup, salad, and thick glass noodles. No ice cream though like the online menu says, but I was so full afterwards I didn't care. It was supposed to be a boat for 3 people LOL.

Shortly after having the soup, salad, and noodles, they were done making the platter. It might have taken them 15 minutes. They gave us tasty green tea as well. I didn't want to eat it because the presentation was beautiful. Everything tasted fresh and delicious. I also had leftovers which is fabulous.

I tend to frequent AYCE sushi places but this is one sushi place I would return to."}
