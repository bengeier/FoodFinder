{"text":"Pizza is amazing, my boyfriend asks to come here once every week. The crust is delicious and the toppings taste very fresh and this is probably the best pizza I've ever had that's not from a big pizza chain company like Pizza Hut. I recommend the fries as well, really fresh! I really do enjoy how it is also a variety store and I can pickup some ice cream for dessert. They have a nice variety of drinks as well, one fave which is Arizona Strawberry Tea :)
Don't be fooled by the place's small and a bit shabby appearance, their pizza is doesn't fail to deliver!  (Literally, they deliver too)"}
{"text":"I have had many of the items in the menu, and are all very good.
The pizza is a good standard, but the walk in price keeps creeping up.
Panzorotti was very well done and packaged perfectly so as to not go all soft during the transportation home.
The wings are hit and miss.  Last time I ordered it was a miss.  Too small for the price.
Pizza is their speciality and they do it well."}
{"text":"This is one of those weird places that shouldn't work but some how, some way, it works.

It's a stark variety store with a pizzeria in the back.

Don't let the variety store fool you, these guys can sling pies.

The toppings are actually big toppings with no sign of skimping. Homemade quality all the way through.

Not only that, but they also have Korean pizzas that I haven't seen anywhere in Toronto.

A local secret worth driving out of your way for. Also kind of convenient to be able to pick up chocolate bars, drinks an ice cream in one place."}
