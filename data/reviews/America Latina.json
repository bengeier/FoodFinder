{"text":"We LOVE this place!  Great, authentic tacos and wonderful guac! Love the cheap breakfasts on Sunday mornings.  

However, it has been closed since thanksgiving with a sign in the window saying they'll be back in two weeks. I hope they come back soon!!!"}
{"text":"Some of the worst food I've been served in recent memory.  The burrito I had was greasy and completely tasteless.  I couldn't eat it.

I'll never go back.  I only wish I could give this place zero stars."}
{"text":"I had a great experience here.  It seems like its family run and it was definitely a nice atmosphere.  It would be about what I expect for this type of place, very sparse in the dining area, but great food.  My whole family originally hails from the West Coast and I am back there quite often and I am always discouraged by the lack of authentic Mexican food here in Madison.  This place definitely lived up to my expectations of what a Mexican spot should be, great food, very cheap.  

I've had both pork tacos, chicken, steak, fish tacos as well as the quesadila, rice, and beans.  I'm not a big fan of beans, but my friend who was with me ate mine and said they were good and made from scratch and not from a can.  The rice was also very good.  I have been here 2 times in the last week and definitely will be going back again.  I'd give it 5 stars but they do not as of yet serve alcohol and I do not know if they will.  Overall though its great and I'm glad its close and can't wait till I can go back!"}
{"text":"This nice family run business just opened one week ago.  We live near by and noticed it while driving last.  We are thrilled' with excellent food and friendly service.  A great addition to this very ethnic corner of restaurants."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! I love authentic Mexican food, which is really difficult to find on the west side of Madison, as other reviewers have pointed out. Everything I've tried here is wonderful. Their tacos al pastor are absolutely lovely and well-seasoned, and phenomenally priced. The gorditas are superb, too - try the ones with chicharrones if you can spare the calories. 

They also make fantastic (and /huge/) tortas. The bread is fresh, and the sandwich comes stuffed with meat and veggies (I especially love the thinly sliced avocado on top - that, combined with the sour cream gives it a nice creamy/sweet note that sets off the meat well). 

It's a lovely place, with friendly staff, and I hope they do well!"}
{"text":"First let me say it is nothing \"fancy\" and I'm not factoring that into the review. 

The food was excellent. I had the fish taco dinner, which was awesome, and the kids liked their food too.

 I was also very happy with the prices. Instead of the usual fast food night crap, consider going here instead. The prices might even be lower than the usual fast food.. $2 tacos are a bargain.

The other thing I liked is the the owners were very friendly and happy to have us there. It is a small locally family owned place, and I look forward to going back."}
{"text":"When Taqueria Guadalajara burned, we scoured the entire Mad area for our authentic Mexican fix. We moved here from Los Angeles and it's something we've missed dearly. THIS IS IT!

It's just like taco truck Mex, but clean, friendly and inviting, like sitting at abuelalita's kitchen table. 

Very friendly, family run, great service, even better food!"}
{"text":"Tragically, America Latina has permanently closed. A new family has taken over the space and there is a sign out that it is going to now be called El Burrito. Boohoo."}
{"text":"It's always a great day when I discover a new Mexican place really close to work and not too far out of the way home for a good takeout dinner. Not only that, I love me some breakfast tacos and they serve breakfast daily, so I will surely be visiting upon my next hangover.

But for today, I brought home a shredded pork taco, an al pastor taco and a chicken taco, all with the traditional onion/cilantro toppings. The meats were roasted, juicy and seasoned, with generous portions on each taco. I also ordered a pollo suiza entree -- grilled chicken and carmelized onion made into gooey goodness after being topped with melted cheese. 

The guacamole, something I'm not usually a big fan of -- was fresh and tasty, a strong hint of lime and not too many onions. The only way I like it, and that's how they do it.

Fresh, well-presented food, this close to work and home? Si senors y senoritas, I will be back."}
{"text":"Bringing some (much needed) south of the border flair to the west side

Who woulda thunk it - decent Mexican food on the far west side?!?  All the recent debate about Madison's best nachos had me on the prowl for some solid Mexican eats.  So I grabbed the WaunaQueen on her lunch break and we headed over to America Latina.  While I'm sorry to report the hunt for the Nacho Holy Grail came up empty (sorry GeekySteve!), this little eatery served up some seriously delicious Mexican grub.  

Things I liked:
 * The complementary chips and salsa were solid.  The chips were extremely fresh and came with three salsa choices: mild, hot and verde.  The verde offered a mouthful of tomatillo goodness with a kiss of heat.  While I wish the tomatillos were charred more, things were off to a very good start.

 * Our server was personable and efficient.  She walked us through the lunch menu and checked in with us often.  She made a fresh pot of coffee for me when I arrived and kept my coffee cup full throughout the meal.  The restaurant was spotless and bathed in natural light from the front windows.

 * The $2 el pastor taco was fant√°stico!   Pork and pineapple living in perfect harmony.  I will dream about this dish for quite some time and sleep with a smile of contentment on my face.

 * The $7 chicken tinga quesadilla was a hit with my dining companion.  The 12\" golden brown corn tortilla was brimming with moist chicken in a mild tomato sauce. While the dish could have used a little more zip, that problem was easily remedied with a shot of the hot salsa.

Things I didn't:
 * The chorizo taco fell flat for me.  It wasn't bad - its only crime was that I consumed it after I ate the transcendent el pastor taco.

 * The place was near empty during the lunch hour.  My wife works across the street and had no idea this place existed.  It would be a damned shame if this place doesn't survive.  Tell your friends about this place - they will shower you with praise for suggesting it.

That it for the negatives.

While I was there, the server shared that the restaurant sells $1 tacos on weekend between 2pm and 4pm.  ONE DOLLAR TACOS, folks!!!  So now you have no excuse at all for not giving this place a shot."}
{"text":"In brief: I was pleasantly surprised. 

For Mexican food, I like more \"authentic\" (I mean, as much as I as a food nerd in Wisconsin can reasonably claim to know about authentic Mexican) than Midwest overstuffed-with-dairy Mexican.  

A couple of my preferred Mexican joints have shut down lately, this place opens up like a mile from my house.  Hey potentially solid Mexican place real close to home is worth investigating.  

It's in a strip mall, in a space that's been a couple other restaurants before. Inside it's pretty bare. Definitely mom-n-pop. When I went, one daughter was taking orders, her mom was cooking, and another sister was helping in the kitchen.  

So look at my surprise when one of their standard meats that you can throw in pretty much any shape & size of masa dough, is cochinita pibil (slow roasted achiote rubbed pork shoulder).  A lot of places that's like an entree unto itself but here you can get it on anything. 

I had a cochinita pibil huarache which was plenty of food, and really good. My friend who had been lifting all day got 4 tacos (cochinita, pastor, steak, chicken), and a GIANT chicken quesadilla (1/3 of which I ended up eating). Then he wanted to try the fish taco special and tried to order 1 fish taco, but we ended up with a whole order of fish tacos, so I had one of those and it was pretty solid too. Nice slaw & salsa. 

Way too much food, but all good, and very cheap.  Support my new neighborhood Mexican joint. Because I want to eat there more!"}
