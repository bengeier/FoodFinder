{"text":"Fantastic service in this place.  We had a large party for dinner and the service couldn't be better. Friendly staff/waiters who made sure we had everything. We felt right at home.  Also, good value for the money."}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner last night.  We shared the calamari which was very good.  I had the seafood linguini which was loaded with seafood and a light rose sauce.  My husband has the pesto gnocchi not too heavy and very flavorful.  The waitress was friendly and attentive.  This is our 3rd time being there and we have loved the food and service!"}
{"text":"Great food 
Good. Guys
Like family

Keep up the great work

Strongly recommended this place"}
{"text":"We order lunch from here often and they never disappoint. Great food generous portions and very authentic. Pasta Pizza or salads all are great."}
{"text":"Excellent Italian food! I tried the famous polenta fries ...sooo good! My husband hates polenta, but he loved them too!  Excellent service - we had a waitress named Patrizzia and she was awesome!"}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant for the first time with my brother and sister-in-law and we all enjoyed it.  Arrived around 2 p.m. and the place was not busy as the lunch rush was over.  We started with bruschetta which was quite tasty.  We then ordered the ravioli with braised beef, penne vodka and a veal dish.  I sampled each, and they were each delicious and authentic tasting.  I was happy that the food was fresh considering they were not busy, as some places serve stale tasting food during non-rush periods.  We finished up with a chocolate cheesecake which was from Cheesecake factory and delicious.  I had a tea which was ordinary tasting as it did not appear to be a premium blend. I'm guessing an Italian place focuses more on coffee (which I don't drink) than tea.  Although there was only one waitress we had no issues with service as other reviewers have mentioned.  Everything was brought to the table in a reasonable amount of time and the waitress consistently followed up to make sure we were happy.  I highly recommend this place for an authentic Italian experience."}
{"text":"That's Italian is located in a small plaza, and it's definitely easy to miss in the dark. The restaurant itself is fairly small, and seats maybe 20-25 people. They also have a takeout counter with a slightly different menu where you can also order items not available in the dine-in menu (like sandwiches). 

We were given freshly baked focaccia to start off with, and it was SO good! Crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside - it was so delightfully buttery.

We ordered: 
- Calamari Fritti: Small bite size pieces, lightly battered and very crispy. This was a perfect size to share between two people as an appetizer. 
- Sidernese Pizza: So good! The crust was thin and crispy, with an ample amount of toppings. The arugula very fresh, and balanced well with the prosciutto and white sauce. 
- Pasta with whitefish in a white wine sauce: This was ordered from their specials menu. Pasta was cooked perfectly al dente, and while the sauce was light, the white wine flavour really shone through and paired well with the whitefish. 

While the service was very friendly, it was really slow because they only had one server. It makes sense, given the small dining space, but it took about half an hour to bag the leftover pizza, to give us the bill, and to process the bill because he was busy serving the other customers, and I left the restaurant fairly annoyed because of this. If you're in a hurry during peak dining hours, I suggest you call ahead and order takeout instead."}
{"text":"Fettucine marre a monte, was pretty good! well balanced proportions. Mixing in the hot sauce gave a little kick. Wanted something between alfredo and tomato sauce; tbis was the one! Would come again."}
{"text":"My family had a Christmas party this past week and the food was incredible. The amount of food that we received allowed us to have lunch for the following day. The atmosphere is inviting and our servers Mary and Janette were amazing. So friendly and helpful and lots of smiles. We will definitely be back again. The owner was seen walking around saying hi to people which is rare now a days. It was nice to see someone taking pride in their business. Keep up the great work."}
{"text":"Excellent, good quality food. Service is always top notch. Have also hosted a few private events here with zero complaints. Definitely one of the best restaurants in Woodbridge."}
{"text":"The welcome at the door was warm and friendly by the owner. He recommended dishes right away. The atmosphere is nice with nice table touches and good quality flatware. The welcome by the owner and watching him go table to table talking with people made it feel more like dinner at his warm and welcoming house than a restaurant.
The bread was served with a very spicy dipping sauce that is very addictive.
We had seafood pasta, arugula salad and spinach/white pasta with asparagus. I was sad when I finished as it was soon good. 
Desert was a delicious cheesecake..so good..."}
{"text":"Solid food and service. Menu is kinda standard fare (pizza and pasta) and a little expensive for a restaurant located in a plaza, but the servings are filling and the waiter is very upbeat (almost aggressively so, haha)."}
{"text":"I recently decided to check this place out being around the area. Unfortunately I cannot say I will be eating here again. I came on a Friday night with a party of 4 and it took an overly excessive amount of time for our drinks to even get to the table. By the time our food had arrived to the table it had been an hour of sitting down waiting.

We started with the calamari which was actually really good, but for the price point and quantity delivered to us, it did not seem reasonably priced. For my entree I had gotten a cacciatore pizza. I was very displeased that the pizza was already cold by the time I had started to eat it and requested it be placed in the oven to be heated up. The pizza was delicious though once I had gotten it back! I would say the quality is almost there but still a bit quite overpriced for what was received.

Long story short, I feel the restaurant has plenty of potential to be successful. I feel where they have went wrong is trying to overdress basic quality pizza to the extent that they advertise it to be something extravagant which sets the expectations a little too high. Still a great place to try and would recommend giving it your own try."}
{"text":"Had a birthday dinner with family. Difficult decisions to make when ordering from their menu as they have tons of great selection. I eventually decided on the pizza and my wife had the seafood pasta. Huge portions and very delicious. Looking forward to coming back. Definitely a hidden gem in Woodbridge."}
{"text":"I have never had the opportunity to eat at the restaurant, but tonight I decided to order take out from there.  I ordered an Americana Party Size pizza for delivery.  I have to say \" It was delicious.!!!\"  I will definitely have to check out the restaurant & will  be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"best italian place i have ever been to daniele and karm were sooo nice
The food the pasta the pizza the ice cream all soo amazinggggg
Saw uts reviews on google and yelp both read all good reviews so went to try it out"}
{"text":"Great local Italian place...which is saying a lot in a neighbourhood flooded with Italian restaurants.  The specials change all the time and are always great."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here to grab a quick bite. We both decided on getting the arugula salad with chicken breast, as we thought this would be quick, as we had an appointment to attend to. We waited at least 25 minutes for salad to be served to us. Menu stated arugula salad had cherry tomatoes and shaved parmigiano cheese. The salad we got was very small for price, there were maybe 6 pieces of halved cherry tomatoes and barely no shaved cheese. When I asked for some bread, waiter responded that \"we do not usually serve bread with salads\". He brought us 2 pieces  of white pizza reluctantly. From my experience today, I'll take my business elsewhere thank you.  Response from owner below very condescending."}
{"text":"I went to this place after a night bowling.   I enjoyed this food as they accommodated different food allergies.  I also like this place as the ambiance is nice.  The wait staff generally did a good job at answer my wife's and friends questions.    The pizza and pasta's are quite good.    The place is clean and they make a very good cappuccino.

Plenty of parking.  No reservations.   First come first serve basis.   Good with children since they make cheese pizza for them or various kinds of pasta children typically enjoy.   

They have done their grand opening yet but will soon."}
{"text":"I wanted  to treat my friend to an Italian dinner for her birthday. I had high expectations because of the reviews. Maybe it was the off night but, both of us ordered penne primavera  and both of us thought that it lacked significantly in flavour. I couldn't taste any spices, if at all. I had to garnish my dish with pepper and mozzarella quite a bit but, it still wasn't palatable. Disappointed.

In addition, the restaurant is on a smaller side so, the noise level was very loud. Not the best place if you want to have a chit chat. also, I want to add that I went on a Friday night."}
{"text":"Great pizza and good service. Everything we had here was good and well worth the money. Good selection of wine including vino Ciro which shows that the owners have good taste.v overall we spent a wonderful night here with family and had a great dinner.vid highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"This place has a lot to be desired. I hated everything about my experience.

The dining area is probably only 500 square feet and yet, the waitress did not pay attention to us at all. 
For a small space, it was terribly LOUD , I couldn't hear the person across from me. 
Also, I sent back my Eggplant Parmigiana because it was 2 very sorry, very uncooked pieces of eggplant smothered in sauce and cheese. INEDIBLE. 

They brought me Gnocchi instead and even THAT dish, the tomato sauce tasted very fatty and acidic. 

Also, I don't know what kind of Italian restaurant doesn't offer Olive Oil and Vinegar with their bread, they brought us Butter. Bread and BUTTER? At an ITALIAN resto? More like EYE-talian.

Marinara sauce and butter are not my thing. Don't eat here."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, fast service, and awesome food! The pastas are great especially the lobster pasta! I also recommend the polenta fries for appetizers. They are amazing! I will definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to go for date night. It's a small Italian restaurant with an intimate atmosphere and great food. They get all of their bread from a local bakery and have a nice antipasto selection with sausage, cheese, olives, the works! They also have a pretty nice wine selection, and a bar up front, so you can get your drink of choice too. 

The food was really good, real Italian food too, not 'Italian tasting'. The owner came around too to see how things were going. A really nice staff. If you're in the area, give this one a try."}
{"text":"I was here this past weekend for my son's 2nd birthday along with some members of my family.  None of us had ever been here before, but had read some positive reviews online so decided to give it a try.  So glad we did!  First off, the customer service was amazing!  Angie and the rest of the servers made sure that we were well taken care of.  All of the dishes that we ordered came out in a reasonable amount of time and they were all so delicious!!  We were all pleasantly surprised at how tasty everything was.  If you are looking for an authentic Italian restaurant which is fairly priced, with delicious food and great customer service, look no further!   We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"One of the worst experiences we have had while placing an order from a restaurant. The restaurant staff is extremely rude and thinks they are doing you a favor by serving you food. We have never had someone talk to us so rudely, ever, in Toronto or Canada. The staff is a big black blotch on the good name of Canada. Lost our appetite after having to deal with them. Plus after seeing some of the other reviews on yelp, I would stay well clear of them."}
{"text":"Found this restaurant on yelp and glad I did! Lots of veggie options. We started with an order of arancini.  They are the mini version and had a great texture. The Pomodoro sauce was delicious. I enjoyed it on baked gnocchi with mozzarella. My parents each had the eggplant parmesan and if was perfect. Thinly sliced with crispy coating. Very friend service and very clean facilities. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Food wasn't bad but I will definitely not be returning. It was a Saturday night and we were a party of 5. There was one other table already seated when we walked in and they already had their delicious looking personal pizzas.

Firstly, the appetizers. We got calamari (both ways) and two orders of bruschetta. There was so little tomato and barely any garlic on the bruschetta. Basically, we received cheesy bread. Disappointing. You do not get your money's worth; I could've made something better at home.

Again, we were the only other table for a while. This is why it was very hard for me to accept the fact that it took them half an hour to get our appetizers and a little over an hour to get our entrees. It was Saturday. They should have been prepared. My gnocchi, when it finally arrived, was overcooked (read: mushy) and bland. The pesto cream sauce was lacking flavour and the dish was skimpy with the chicken. But everybody else seemed to enjoy their entrees much more than mine which was nice.

While we were still waiting for our food, the server came and pulled up the blinds at the windows, which we were sitting next to. After my mother asked him not to, he said \"sorry, I have to let people know we're open.\" A tip for this establishment: attracting customers is important but making them want to stay and return is just as crucial. 

Some good points? The server, albeit a little unconcerned of how unsatisfied we were, was quite nice. He was not afraid to have a conversation and frequently filled our water glasses. He was very busy, which I can understand. The homemade chili oil was delicious. The ingredients were fresh and the restaurant was clean. If you do find yourself considering this restaurant, perhaps try the Woodbridge location instead and stick to a pizza."}
{"text":"Love love love this place. staff is friendly and polite and the food is always good and If there's ever something wrong, they are quick to fix it and make sure you leave happy. Owners are very hospitable and welcoming as well. One of my favorite spots for sure. Highly recommended !!:):)"}
{"text":"It was our first time trying this restaurant yesterday and it exceeded all of my expectations.   We ordered ahead for pick up, but I goofed up on locations so when I arrived had found out I ordered from Woodbridge.  Luckily I had arrived soon enough to cancel the other in WB.  The team here was very kind and accommodating.   

We ordered the garlic toast, calamari, penne alla vodka, veal and chicken entree.  The food by far was well seasoned, well cooked and was excellent for an italian eatery in Richmond Hill.  The vegetables with the veal were not soggy.   Penne alla vodka was excellent compared to others I've tried.  Good amount of cream and pancetta.  Chicken cutlet not dry.  Calamari was the hit amongst my family.  Would suggest asking for more lemon wedges with the calamari as we only got 2.   

Interior was very nice.  Very clean, modern and well managed.  Although on the pricey side, we will be back for sure."}
{"text":"This is our local authentic Italian restaurant. We have always dined in and enjoyed delicious Italian cooking which tastes homemade. For Christmas Eve, I pre-ordered a tray of calamari fritti which are so difficult and messy to prepare at home. When we picked it up, the tray was a very generous portion, and the calamari were hot and fried to perfection... not over-cooked or rubbery, and they tasted fresh. The guests and I enjoyed them, and I had the luxury of not doing any super-hot deep-frying. Would definitely order from That's Italian for future family festas and will be dining in again soon."}
{"text":"Was excited to try this restaurant out as I've read the reviews.
My friend and I came here for lunch on a Saturday afternoon. We were pleased with our experience here. The restaurant was clean, the food was delicious, waitstaff was helpful. 

On this visit we ordered the Rice Balls, Polenta fries as appetizers and we both had the \"Gnocchi alla Sorrentina\" for our main. Everything we ordered was delectable, although I found the Polenta Fries to be a little more seasoned with salt than I would like but that could differ from someone else's palete."}
{"text":"Great food!! Sharp deco. Quiet as in not too noisy . Surprising location: strip mall."}
{"text":"Been a few times but will not go back. Service is just ok. Check your bill carefully as they will include tip and not tell you. Ended up tipping twice. When I brought this to the owners attention, I was made to feel as if it was my fault.


We had 6 people in our party for the record and eived a less than professional response from the establishment! This was the typical answer I expected hence the reason I won't be going back! Rather than worrying what your customers are doing Christmas eve, you should worry about integrity in your restaurant!"}
{"text":"I love that's Italian, probably because I'm in love with Italian cuisine. 

I only came for take out, but waited inside for my order, and its very family friendly, it's also very clean and classy for a restaurant with the words \"express\" in the name. 

I tried their gnocchi in the vodka sauce, and I have already fallen in love with them. It was perfect, it was a nice thick creamy sauce, like it should be. The gnocchi was cooked perfectly tender, and just a little chew. How I personally like it. The service was fast and the portion was huge. 

I can't wait to go back to try some of there other sauces."}
{"text":"Only had their pizza from taking them out.  Quality is consistent.  Friendly service. It's really good Italian style pizza.  Would definitely recommend trying it if you are in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"One of the best pizza place and pasta place. The staff was friendly. Their pasta is always juicy and al dente. We love their pizza. This place is always packed in weekends, so I normally come in odd times to avoid the wait. I highly recommend"}
{"text":"Based on other reviews, I was very excited to take my hubby here for his birthday dinner.  I made reservations as I expected a busy Saturday night.   I was right.  We had to wait for our table at the bar but that was fine. 

There were a few young ladies and another lady who I assume is the owner serving.  This is where I think relying on your staff to serve a section is really important as although the food was great, the service was terrible. 

After ordering our meals (of which owner was walking away from the table before I finished ordering), I was only offered one glass of water with my food for the whole evening.  Hubby got a Coke but no offer for water.  Dinner arrived and it was really good...I could understand the previous reviews.  But no one came to check on us to see if we were ok.  But, the owner managed to check in many times with the table beside us.

Another server came by to take our plates and asked if we would like coffees or espressos.  Espressos sounded great in keeping with the theme and would have been nice with dessert.  They only had two items for dessert and no dessert menu, so if you have a sweet tooth, I would suggest dinner at 5-6 pm, and not 8 pm like we did.  Anyways, the pecan pie came which Owner made and it was really good.  But no espressos!  As owner was hurriedly walking away with our plate, I asked about the espressos and she said no one told her.  We did get them...after dessert.

Soon after we were finished, another waitress arrived with the bill at our table.   Funny, I didn't ask for the bill.  It wasn't busy and no where near closing time. 

We really enjoyed the food but we didn't appreciate the service at all.  Hubby tried to make the best of it, but I was embarrassed to take him to a restaurant that treated us like an inconvenience.  I mean, if i wasn't interested in being served, we could've gone to McDonald's or some other fast food place.  Instead, we supported a local business and this was our \"thanks\" in return.  

Their food saved this review or it would have been one star based on their service.  I'm not sure if we will come back."}
{"text":"I was a fan of their Woodbridge location, the food, service and management were outstanding, but the fact that they've opened a take-away/ sit down spot in my hometown, gives me extra reason to jump for joy!

That's Italian Express is located just north of Yonge and Crosby in the DQ plaza across from Avante Mazda. You might need to slow down a bit as you drive north on Yonge, as I myself have driven past it due to the plaza being set back from the road and book ended by car dealerships.

Behind the front counter is their quick and dirty take out menu, which includes, pizzas, sandwiches, pastas and more - you can order and be out the door for under $20 in under 20 min.

However, I've become accustomed to enjoying my lunch so I stayed in today and ordered a person (12 inch) Diavola pizza. This place is the dark horse of pizza so be prepared other pizza joints, Pizza is what That's Italian does well. The Diavola was lightly spiced (not crazy spicy - but they can amp it up to order), perfect fresh dough, great sauce, fresh cherry tomatoes and toppings! I can't speak for the restaurant but in my opinion, this is definitely their signature pizza! My mouth is STILL watering as I recount my lunch!

To drink I asked for a glass of water which was kept full and chilled at all times! Tony, working here today was awesome, super friendly, kept me company during my lonely lunch (just kidding) but his service was on point my entire meal, even kind enough to offer me an espresso once I was finished eating.

I'm looking forward to coming back for dinner soon, as they've got some mains (cornish game hen) and others that make limited appearances on the menu that I've got to try. Also, their gnocchi looks incredible!

Pro-tip: If you can handle your spicey foods, ask for their in house made hot pepper sauce on the side. Tickles the taste buds!!

Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"Wow. I can't believe this place has good reviews. They must either be their friends and relatives or they have never had good food. We had Caesar salad and it was store bought sauce and stale lettuce. We also got grilled calamari which tasted fishy and the membrane wasn't removed. We had the \"warm grilled vegetable salad\" let me tell you it's NOT a warm grilled vegetable salad. 
We had the veal scalapini it had powdered gravy sauce it was over cooked and do hard to chew. 
The food came to a $113 and it wasn't even worth $1. Canned and powdered food and worst of all fishy clams that were for sute canned. If you can't find fresh clams than don't use it in your seafood pasta."}
{"text":"We held our son's birthday dinner at 'That's Italian' with a group of 16 - and we all left happy and full! 
The menu offers so many great selections its hard to choose but once you get your serving- the size is more than reasonable & the flavours are just right! Also, reasonably priced. 
The staff is attentive and all work as a team to make your experience enjoyable. 
Would recommend to give it a shot!"}
{"text":"It's been a couple years since my last dinner at That's Italian and I'm happy to report that the service and good quality has not changed -it's still truly exceptional.

It was my dads 65th birthday and I knew he was hankering for some home style, old school Italian eats. I got in contact with owner Joe and listed some of the speciality items that my dad was craving that his mother used to make - gnocchi, rabbit and snails (Lumache).

Just as soon as I made the requests Joe was off the phone and hunting for all the special ingredients to make this special, off-menu, dinner happen. He hunted high and low but unfortunately, the snails were out of season but found some delicious rabbit and promised that we'd have more gnocchi than we could eat. Sounded good to me.

We gathered here last Tuesday and luckily for us the restaurant wasn't too busy which meant we got a lot of attention - specifically my dad. We all started with the house caesar salad which was creamy and full of garlic flavour, positive points for using romaine lettuce and not that iceberg crap.  Soon to follow was a giant 6 service platter of Gnocchi Pomodoro (tomato sauce) served Centro Tavola (family style, served from the table).

The gnocchi was heavenly, soft pillows of potato dumpling goodness, covered in a beautiful red sauce. Anyone who has made gnocchi before knows that it's a labour of love to execute this difficult dish - That's Italian pulled it off with style! Dad had seconds... and thirds!

Lastly, it was time for the rabbit. Bugs Bunny never looked so good, properly quartered and served in a tomato base sauce with olives and other seasoning items. I haven't had Rabbit in nearly 20 years and it was a delicious white meat, with the texture of chicken and a mild white meat taste - not gamey at all!

The staff here really deserve as much praise as the kitchen staff, our server(s) were friendly, helpful and totally all about making sure we had a great night - and we did. We event shared some birthday cake with them as a thank you for all their help and service.

Got a special occasion? That's Italian is the place to be!"}

{"text":"Stopped in for a late dinner after a business meeting in the area. Upscale atmosphere with large and small tables, comfortable seating with table linens etc. friendly and efficient wait staff. Opted for the Isulata Mista to start and the House special fettuccine with clams, shrimp, cherry tomatoes in a white wine sauce. The Mista had nice crisp greens, cherry tomatoes, and cucumber but the homemade Italian dressing was quite bland, basically an oil and vinegar dressing without any seasonings what so ever. Quite bland. 

The fettuccine special was also quite bland with little to no flavoring and missing the shrimp entirely. The waitress offered powdered Parmesan at the table for the main which I thought was kind of cheap considering the price. I inquired about the shrimp and was brought a few shrimp in a side dish sometime later when I had nearly finished my meal. Needless to say the flavor of the shrimp didn't add to the dish and the shrimp by themselves were bland as well. 

No complimentary bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar with the meal and and beer at $8.00 a bottle. 

So all in all, fairly pricey for an average and bland meal."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the food and the service. Have been twice already and each time was perfect. Warm and friendly. A must if you like great food and great service"}
{"text":"This place is sort of hard to find, but once you do you'll be glad you found it. Its small, but its extremely nice inside with a very cosy modern feeling. We went on a friday night with no reservations and was able to get a table, but it was very busy, so i think if you were to go with more than 2 or on a special occasion I'd suggest reservations.  This place was awesome when it came to the food - you could tell everything was made from scratch and had a real authentic taste to it. But on the other hand, the service was extremely slow. I know our server was busy but i mean we were always waiting. Not that we were in a rush, but I mean menus would be nice to have (we waited about 15 mins just for a menu), and then waited to place a drink order, which took about 20 mins to get. The food took as long as a normal restaurant so that was ok, it was more the server being slow. she seemed very flustered, like she kept forgetting we were there, and when she did come talk to us it was always rushed. My boyfriend would never get the chance to order another beer before she ran off. Overall the service needed some major work, but i'd go back for the food - it makes up for the service."}
{"text":"When getting a big group together for a meal, an Italian restaurant seems to be best choice because everyone (including my 8 year old twin sons, who between them have several food allergies) can find something to eat. Last weekend, my family got together to celebrate my nephew's college graduation. I've heard good things about That's Italian Ristorante from friends. Our entire party consisted of 12 people; we had a reservation for 7PM. Most of us showed up at 7 but it took them more than 15 minutes to get table ready. While the restaurant is physically on the small side (which may explain why we were not seated right away and the reason for my rating), I can say that the food was good and we all walked out full and happy. Again, I would rate it 4 stars if not for the wait."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere.The best staff!Warm and friendly .Its like eating with family."}
{"text":"Amazing pasta. I always get their seafood pasta. The dough appetizer is amazing too. 

The place is nice and cozy too. Although it's small, I've never had to wait for seats. But reserve ahead of you want a guaranteed table. Price is reasonable too. 

Plus side it helps when the manager/server is hilarious."}
{"text":"Great pizza huge portions.
Had a very good lunch. Nothing spectacular but very good value, especially the pizza."}
{"text":"Likes:
- Fresh ingredients
- Generous portions
- Wine is well-priced

Not as impressed:
- Service is on the slow side 
- Website indicates the restaurant closes at 10pm, but it actually closed at 9pm which caught us off guard. I generally like a sweet finish to my meals, so it was disappointing we couldn't order desserts.

I came here on Thursday evening before the Easter long weekend. I made a reservation for 7:15pm and we had to wait around 15-20 minutes or so before being seated as the restaurant was full. The restaurant had an ordering counter for take-out and catering, and approximately 20 plus seats for dine-in customers.

My friend and I ordered the following:

Insalata Mista ($7) - The portions were generous and the mixed greens were really fresh. I missed the tanginess in the homemade Italian dressing, which lacked flavour overall, but because the mixed greens were so fresh, I didn't mind it too much.

Di Bosco ($18) - Generally, I prefer tomato over cream sauce for pastas. Our server recommended this dish to us, and since the restaurant is able to make a tomato version, we decided to give it a try. It is the first time we had truffle oil with a tomato sauce, and although I still find that it compliments a cream sauce better, we enjoyed the new combination a lot. The parpadelle was al dente and sauce to pasta ratio was perfect. The Italian pancetta in the pasta was scrumptious, although there wasn't much of it.

Margherita Pizza ($15) - The bocconcini on the pizza was creamy and delicious. Unfortunately, I wasn't a fan of the texture of the pizza. I prefer the crust to be crisp outside and airy inside, but the crust was a bit dense, especially after it cooled.

Overall, this is a great place for simple down to earth Italian fare. The portions are generous for the price you pay. Service, however, is on the slow side, since there is only one server taking care of all the tables."}
{"text":"Access
The restaurant is located in a plaza but may be difficult to find at night time (at least for us it was). My advice is to use GPS and don't be worried about driving a \"little\" slower once you drive North of Major Mackenzie. The restaurant itself is not very big and making U-Turns would definitely be a hassle if you are driving on Yonge.

It is a small restaurant that serves no more than 10 tables. Even though the place is super small, you are immediately welcomed by friendly staff at the front. It is a good idea to make reservations on a weekend. We arrived around 7:30pm (30 minutes before our reservation time) but the restaurant was able to seat us immediately. Unfortunately, the first half of our experience was slow and the waiter was a bit stressed out from all the orders. It took him a while to get to us but that's okay, we will live. I think I may be a little sensitive but I could sense a bit of uneasiness from the waiter when I declined to order drinks. My boyfriend elected to order beer after but the selection was limited so we declined again. As the night went by, our waiter opened up more and eventually apologized for how he was so busy. We were surprised and appreciated this honest gesture.

Food
Before I go into the details, I just want to say that the portions were perfect. I probably ate more than I should but that's a good thing. The only disappointment I had was in the dessert but we will get to that soon. For some reason I made a stupid mistake and took all my photos vertically, it doesn't look appealing at all in my blog lols. By the way, my boyfriend ordered a special menu that included an appetizer, entree, and dessert, all for $30. Definitely a deal!

Appetizer and bread:
For some as inexperienced as myself I'm going to guess that I had ciabatta buns (and I did like it), but please correct me if I'm wrong. I find it rare to ever taste good bread at a restaurant; most of the time the bread is dry and flavourless. Even though butter will help, I think the bread itself has to taste good in the first place. The calamari was quite good, crispy outside, and not too tough once you chew past the crispy skin. It's quite salty already and the sauce doesn't really add much (it's actually sour).

Pasta
My linguine (on the right) was better lols. Anyhow my dish did not have an extra sauce, all the seasoning was already absorbed by the pasta. I find this to be pretty unique because my boyfriend's dish was soaked in sauce (though everything is in the bottom). I will give the dishes a double thumbs up for not cheaping out on the seafood and those tiger shrimps were delicious. The pasta was alright, but I've had better.

Dessert:
It is unfortunate that the tiramisu didn't turn out amazing; in fact it was lacking. The top layer was done alright but some parts of the dessert were still frozen (not good!). I'm glad they gave us two scoops of the tiramisu so we could share.

I see potential in this restaurant and feel that they could do really well with more experience. I wouldn't mind coming back to try their pizza or even order by delivery."}
{"text":"Our new favourite pizza place.
Friendly, courteous and great tasting food.

Thanks for the espresso."}
{"text":"We recently vacationed in the Toronto Area and had dinner here. The food was delicious I had chicken Parmesan the chicken was tender and juicy with an excellent home made sauce. My husband had a seafood dish with pasta and he was also very pleased with his meal. Service was also excellent. The waitress was very friendly, she chatted with us for a while about the area. It was an overall great experience and I would definitely recommend this Restaurant and will return when in the area again."}
{"text":"Yet again and spot on! Customer service is excellent and this is food you can feed your kids. Italians and Greeks like to indulge, but only if the table set is with healthy and hearty food. 

Keep destroying the \"Pizza)&@@&\" name trade. 

And I am not an employee.

Thanks guys. Spot on. 




Tired of Pizza Nova with horrible customer service, over-priced pizza which tastes like cold salt bread when delivered with horrible drivers (not all, but enough), we decided to try this place based on reviews.

The customer service was amazing. Since it was our first order they waived the delivery fee; was kind and pleasant and wanted us back even while we were making the order! Huh?

Then the pizza came...

Delivered by a wonderful driver. Open it up and a concoction of fresh ingredients and a pizza you could feed your kids if you weren't so greedy. 

The lousy pizza chains benefit from a low cost/no care product. The so-called higher ends ones benefit from a public who believe that an extra 10 bucks makes a better product. How sad.

This little store deserves your attention. It may cost an extra buck or a leap of faith but man...what a meal."}
{"text":"Fantastic service and awesome food. I went last week getting the prosciutto white sauce pizza as well as the chicken parm! It's very juicy and tender. The pasta had plenty of sauce and the pizza was of a great size to share. Not too small at all. If you aren't into blue cheese you might not like it but I personally love it would definitely go again.

Update: so I went again yesterday to that's Italian. You know how sometimes second time may not be as good as first?! Well was I wrong! The service was still amazing if not better. Me and my bf got the 25 dollar course set which was so worth. Big portions and fantastic taste. Better than any summerlicious or winterlicious deal. This is because they do not pick and minus the portion sizes. Definitely go! :)"}
{"text":"The calamari was amazing... Super fresh and crispy and served with the cone bowl and wax paper.  The bread has definitely improved from our last visit... Warmed and super soft.  The pasta I had last time wasn't on the menu but they were able make it for me... Which was definitely a plus. The lasagna was amazing... Super cheesy and the sauce was definitely home made. Last but not least... The service was amazing. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here tonight to celebrate a friend's birthday and the food was really good. This place is a hidden gem and although the place is small it can get quite busy.  Good place to get some Italian food."}
{"text":"Finally had date night with my girl. It was our two year anniversary and out of a handful of restaurants, we decided to go back to That's Italian. Not only is the food delicious but it's the customer service that keeps us coming back. Tony is amazing at his job and knows exactly how to cater to a gluten free guest. If you're looking for a great Italian meal and a warm and friendly environment this is the place. The small restaurant size makes the experience cozy and romantic.  Word is spreading about this place so make a reservation.  We had yet again another amazing night out at That's Italian. Thanks guys... ps. Complements to the chef."}
{"text":"OMG this place is SO overrated!  I had seafood linguine and it tasted fishy.  Note to the chef, if you don't have fresh clams, don't put them in the dish!  Pizza is also average, not thin crust.  I honestly have no idea why people like this place so much.  Nonna's Oven is a better option in the area (about 5-10 min drive)"}
{"text":"I haven't had food here yet, but I'm going to get some pizza tonight because it was highly recommended by someone my mom knows. 

Now, I'm giving this place a 5 star based on the idiotic reviews I'm reading when people give them a 1 or 2 stars. 

First of all, most of them said the food was great.. Pretty sure that doesn't mean because you think it tastes good but is overpriced is a good enough reason to rate them badly. This is someone's business you jerks. You're making their ratings go down because you're cheap? 

Anyway... 

5 stars because I'M sure it'll be great! 

****UPDATE***** just as I predicted. Delish!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is absolutely delicious.  We had dinner here on a Friday night a few weeks ago,  the place has a romantic atmosphere and the food is amazing.  I am Celiac and they had gluten-free pasta which was so fresh and it was honestly the best gf pasta I have ever had.  My bf had regular pasta(not gluten-free),  I can't remember which dish but he loved it.  In fact he wants to go back tomorrow for his birthday.  The service is great and the prices are responsible.  Thanks guys for the great experience,  we will be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, great atmosphere. Angela is the best! We were celebrating my birthday with friends and the tiramisu was a delicious way to end an amazing meal. We will definitely be back!! Thanks Angela for all your recommendations."}
{"text":"Not a lot of Italian choices in Richmond Hill so this restaurant is a welcome addition.  They have mistakenly called it express, which I think confuses customers.  I think of express like Me Va Me, which has the restaurant and then the take out \"express\" beside it.  I had to leave the kids in the car and go in to make sure they had seating.

I got the Linguine alla Pescatore.  Sauce was light and the seafood fresh.  They didn't chince out on the shrimp either.  My son got the margarita pizza.  Very good and I will try ordering this for delivery.

Restaurant is very small but also set up as higher end than you would expect from a restaurant like this.  Their mistake is that they are not welcoming to families as there are not even any high chairs.  With a family style menu this does not fit."}
{"text":"I had dinner at That's Italian on a Friday evening. My party of 5 had reaervations for 6:30, and when we arrived the restaurant was fairly empty. We were seated at a nice table near the back of the restaurant. The restaurant is fairly small but they have quite a few tables and a good sized private space downstairs by the restrooms that seems to be used for parties. We ordered polents fries (so good!!) and fried calamari (which got rave reviews by the others in my party and looked amazing) as appetizers. For dinner, I ordered the griglia pizza, which had peppers, zucchini, mozzarella, and bocconcini. It was amazing. The others in my party also enjoyed their dishes very much (diavola pizza, pollo entree, and seafood linguine). For dessert I tried their feature of the evening, pumpkin cheesecake. It was delicious and tasted just like pumpkin pie. All of their cheesecakes come from the Dream Factory, which is the company that makes The Cheesecake Factory cheesecakes.

Our server was very friendly and patient, and the service we received was outstanding. I would definitely return to That's Italian!"}
{"text":"Went tonight with the family for a late dinner.
Service was quick and friendly. Food was quick and really tasty. We had the rigatoni with meat sauce and we had the grilled chicken breast with sautéed mushrooms and an arugula salad.
Will definitely go again and recommend this place.
Reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I wanted to eat vegatarian tonight so I ordered a Veggie Sandwich to go. The sandwich is supposed to include grilled and Marinated red peppers, zucchini, eggplant with arugula and balsamic reduction. Right off the bat I opened the sandwhich and noticed that there was no arugula whatsoever and not a drop of balsamic reduction. On Top of missing two main ingredients this sandwich was so skimpy, there was literally less than 2 tablesppons of chopped vegetables. Also, the sandwich had absolutely no flavour. Give me a break, what a waste of $10! 

Heres a few suggestions: 

1. Use big pieces of grilled veggies 
2. If an ingredient is listed in the description MAKE SURE ITS IN THE SANDWICH
3. Put a pesto on the bun for more flavour (try an olive and parsley pesto)
4. Use a better bun, my bun was kind of falling apart everytime I took a bite 



Make it happen!"}
{"text":"Me and my wife recently ordered Delivery for the first time from Thats Italian Ristorante. Once we placed the order, our food arrived very quickly and very hot. We ordered the grilled calamari, 1 Margherita pizza, Goat cheese filled agnolotti with pesto sauce and the chicken marsala. The calamari was delicious and so was the pizza but I have to say that the agnolotti dish was disgustingly greasy and completely lacking in flavour, i was very disappointed especially that its being made at an iItalian restaurant. We were also very disappointed with the size of the chicken marsala and the greasiness once again, we got 3 little pieces of chicken in a huge take-out container full of grease.  The taste was very nice and the salad that came with it was a very good size. So overall this restaurant has a lot of pros and cons, but unless the cons are addressed I think I would rather find another Italian restaurant, Which can't be too hard in Woodbridge!"}
{"text":"Sorry guys... Consistency issues... Pizza crust has been different each time we've picked up.
Ordered the eggplant parm and it was inedible... Eggplant wasn't cooked....
My advice... Try and standardize the pizza dough making process... It needs to not taste like cardboard."}
{"text":"Went for dinner yesterday. Ordered the arugula salad. Big portion. Salad was fresh and crisp. dressing was delicious. 

Ordered the baked gnocchi in tomato sauce. Gnocchi was good, a little dry in sauce (I like extra sauce) and very cheesy. 

I've heard their pizza is pretty good, will need to try next time. 


Worth a visit."}
{"text":"After last night's disappointing delivery from Il Fornello, my boyfriend and I were still craving decent Italian food. We decided on That's Italian and we are so glad we did! For starters, we ordered the Nodini. It was so crispy on the outside, and so perfectly soft on the inside. We also had the garlic bread, which was fresh and deliciously simple. Then, we ordered the 4 Formaggi Pizza, which was to die for. Compared to last night's disappointing pizza from Il Fornello, this one was crispy and had the perfect blend of cheeses on it. The crust was not too thin, not too thick, just right. Our other main was fettuccini alfredo. Upon first bite, I admit I was a little bit disappointed because it tasted under-seasoned, but the more I had, the more I started to love it and realised it was so good because it didn't have 5 pounds of salt on it. It was extremely creamy and buttery, and perfect. It didn't NEED all the extra salt because it tasted so good in its essence already. I'm not sure if it's home-made, but it definitely tasted like it was, just like everything else we ordered from them.

Shout out to That's Italian - thanks for restoring my boyfriends faith in quality Italian food again. 

Will definitely order from this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Excellent authentic Italian food.  Pizza is excellent with a not too thick not too thin crust.  Service is very good and it's a off the beaten path type of place.  Definitely worth a try, but make reservations first since it gets very busy.  Pasta was al-dente and the salads were delicious.  Dessert were homemade and very authentic."}
{"text":"Friendly atmosfere. Good food for a much fare price. I recomend pasta with meetbals and chicken parmegiana."}
{"text":"Good Italian food. Had fried calamari -perfectly fried at the right temperature. Had the penne panceta with Vodka - pasta all dente and great sauce. Place is elegantly decorated."}
{"text":"We went there thinking it was very good based on the Yelp reviews.  The feel of the restaurant is almost a fast food/take-out delivery ambiance with a sit down area. It's nicely decorated with very friendly staff.  The arugula salad was yummy as were the pizzas, however the crust wasn't the thin crust we were hoping for (kinda bland too).  We were talked into getting the fresh spaghetti but it was VERY al dente.  Very undercooked."}
{"text":"No change from my early review.  Still loving this great Italian place.   Everything was very fresh like last time.  The pizza was great and not greasy.   Lasagna was perfectly prepared in a generous portion.   Seating was comfortable and relaxing.   Not sure what else to say but you gotta make your way up to this place in a small assuming strip mall on Yonge in RH."}
{"text":"These folks have an amazing catering group

Having just attended a conference in Richmond Hill these folks knock it out of the park

A very trendy and curated offering to surprise everyone

Awesome pastries, fruits and yogurts and gluten free items

Cheese and veggie and humus dip trays with artisinal breads for a snack at break

Chicken and eggplant parm sandwiches, salads, innovative wraps (red and green breads with cool fillings) and Tiramisu,    connoli and more for sweet teeth

Plus other treats 

Sure beats the ugly catering we have had in the past at many other events we have attended"}
{"text":"Classy jazzy quaint and romantic   this is the place for a date or for a glass of wine and pasta


I enjoy going to the mom and pop restaurants because they take a level of pride and recognize their influence on the level if enjoyment

Joe  is one of those guys

Fresh generous salads, anything with Arugula gets my nod, and a properly done (meaning crisp batter and served right out of the fryer) Calamari

I enjoy polenta and I enjoy making it with a dollop of slow cooked sauce and melted cheese on top.....Joe does it the same way

Now the pizza arrives and a well cooked crust and the right amount of heft to every slice

They also do take out and the family sized pizzas keep the locals well fed but you can order anything and enjoy it at home. 

Honest and authentic Italian food is what they do and they do it very well

Mangia!"}
{"text":"Went there for a large family event. Great food and great service. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Great service being one of two tables on a later part of a Friday evening (we were there until close). 
I was very happy that our server let us half the pizza when we couldn't decide between cacciatore and Quattro staggione.
We also had the lasagna and pappardelle di bosco. You can really taste the ingredients and how fresh all the pasta is. 
I find both dishes delicious- nothing really outstanding but will definitely be my solid go to for Italian in this area."}
{"text":"Amazing homemade authentic and affordable!  Staff is friendly, portions are generous, ambiance is comfortable.  Angela took amazing care of us, so welcoming and friendly!!! 

We will for sure be back!!!!!"}
{"text":"I finally made it to try this place after the Yelp GTA Rock event.  Yay!

I gave it a 5 star based on my first-visit experience!  I had a very enjoyable dinner.  I am pretty sure I will come back again to try other food on the menu.

I read other yelper's reviews and so I did not expect this is a fancy restaurant.  However, when I first walked in the place, I knew I like this place.  The restaurant is small but cozy and comfortable.  I am pretty sure the owner invests money and efforts to his business from the stylish tables to the very cool app!  BTW, make sure you download their app and redeem a free appetizer.

For a two-persons dinner, I guess we ordered a lot.  We had Stagioni Pizza, Pappardelle Di Bosco Pasta to share.  For drinks, we had red wine and Arranciata.  We ended our dinner with very creamy but not too sweet Tiramisu and two cups of very nice Espresso.  Tony probably noticed that we were very stuffed with those delicious food, he gave us a lemoncello (an Italian lemon liqueur) to try as an after-dinner drink.  He said it supposedly aids in digestion.  That's very nice and attentive.  Thank you Tony!

It was a very Italian meal!

I might try their delivery service later, though I guess I enjoy eat-in here:).  I just noticed they are now doing a 15% off for checking-in.

I am so tempting to try That's Italian Ristorante in Woodbridge soon."}
{"text":"It just keeps getting better... They get a five, because the whole experience is good, it's always good! Of course the service and personalities are great, thanks Tony, Joe, and now they bake their own focaccia, crispy on the outside and soft and delicious on the inside, and dipped in their hot sauce, excellent. 

Their wine always works just right, and tonight the veal Parmesan was excellent, and they used sauce made that afternoon and that makes the difference between good and great!?...

I always feel welcomed and always leave full and feeling great, and that's what keeps me coming back! Oh and don't forget their pizzas , their Quattro Stagione is the best, just like in Italy, you need to try one!!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere to dine with your family or significant other. The vodka penne is delicious. Waitress was friendly. Nice place"}
{"text":"What a fantastic outing. Wanted to catch up over lunch with a friend. The restaurant we'd planned on going to was closed, and That's Italian was at the top of my list to try. Glad we did.

Instantly when we walked in the door we were greeted, seated at a great table, and the polite, professional and mindful service continued throughout our lunch. 

The menu has a lot of offerings that caught my eye. Asked for a recommendation from the waiter, and after he dialed in on my preferences he suggested a lovely pasta with mushrooms and cream sauce. Delicious, and filled me right up. My friend was kind enough to share a slice of his pizza Diavola. Agree with Kris U, it's great.

Also got to try the chile and oil with some really nice bread.

Lovely decor. 

All in all, a great meal. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Odd location for a restaurant.  We found it via search coming back from Wonderland.  

The restaurant is comfy but dimly lit.  They sell pesto,  sauces and olives at the front,  as well as other Italian staples.

Excellent well flavoured dishes.  Our group of 6 all had pasta and enjoyed it.  I had the raviolone - the pesto was delicious.   Could have used more chicken - only a quarter of a chicken breast was used. 

A few issues.  The bread was truly a disappointment for an Italian restaurant.  Cold and stale.  The pasta portions were very small,  even for the smaller eaters in the group.  To have a good meal, even a light eater would likely need an appetizer as well as an pasta dish,  so likely at least $30-$40 dollars.  The entrées may be bigger,  but are also more expensive.  I would say this restaurant is more $$$ rather than $$. The service at the end was incredibly slow considering how quiet the restaurant was."}
{"text":"We came here for an impromptu dinner date on a weekday.  Upon entry, there was a big take out counter.  We walked to the right, and there was a pleasant dine-in area.  That's Italian did a good trick in furnishing this space. It gave a uplift in class without much renovation investment.

Food wise, we took advantage of an incredible Yelp Check-In offer which was 2 cheese and vodka pasta for the price of 1.  The regular price for this entree is $18.  Using this deal, we effectively got a sit down dinner for $9 per person. Total deal! Thank you That's Italian.  Thank you Yelp.  The pasta was very simple: cheese and vodka on penne.  The cheese was very creamy.  The portion was substantial for $18.  For $9, I was not sure the restaurant had much profit margin.  Please note that That's Italian rotates the check-in offer periodically.

Services was extremely friendly and cheerful.  There was not a hint of resentment about the ultra low dinner bill, which obviously impacted his tips earnings.  Similar to their Vaughan location, the server here aims at giving you a good time and a good experience.  I start to think that you would appreciate their services no matter your opinion of their food."}
{"text":"I have visited That's Italian twice, once for a Savour York Region promotion, and another for a Yelp Elite event.  Combining both experience, the food was delicious.  The ambiance was casual fine and cozy.  I liked that the waitresses and bartenders were friendly.  Even we were here for discounted Savour York Region food, the waitress allowed me to use a Yelp Check In offer to get free rosemary garlic bread.  By the way, the garlic bread was very good.  The portion is big here, so don't over-order.

I get the feeling that the owner really wants to give customers an Italian good time, with a friendly atmosphere, lots of good food and laughter."}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday dinner and it was good.  The restaurant is clean and the service was on point.  I ordered the veal parmesan with the pasta side.  The veal was crispy and the pasta was the perfect texture.  The price was reasonable ($22).  I also got the Nodine, these were very good, crispy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside.  I look forward to coming back for more pasta soon!"}
{"text":"I first sampled a pizza from That's Italian Express during a meeting at the Richmond Hill Chamber offices and loved it!  And for someone that's not normally a huge fan of pizza, that's saying a lot!  Since then I have tried a number of items and their menu and really enjoyed everything I've had.  The flavours are wonderful, the portions are generous and always feel that no matter what I order, it's been created just for me.  Would highly recommend dining in as well as getting them to cater your next event!"}
{"text":"Food is good but service is terrible lol, older woman who served us and she only acknowledged the men at the other tables, while she forget half our food......"}
{"text":"Great food, great service! From the salad to the pasta to the pizza, you can't go wrong!!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here with my coworker on Monday. I had the gnocchi it was just like my grandma's. Very homemade and the portion was perfect. The polenta fries were really good also. I would return here any time i am back in Canada."}
{"text":"Lukewarm soup, small portion of pasta with no flavour. Not impressed at all, many more great Italian restaurants in Woodbridge. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"First time trying the place.  Service was mediocre at best. Food was okay.  Disappointing first experience wouldn't return as it was lacking in what could be a great home style experience"}
{"text":"I visited this place recently with my boyfriend and my cousin and although I enjoyed myself I'm wondering if the company and fact that I hadn't seen my cousin in forever played the largest part in my positive experience there.

The location itself I found a little hard to find, it's in a small industrial like plaza and was rather unassuming but it did have the plus of free parking. The space was in my opinion on the small side however it did seem rather spaciously laid out with a clean and classic decor. It seemed like they did have a patio located at the back of the restaurant however we opted for a quaint little table so I was never able to check it out.

The service was above par, our waitress was extremely pleasant, knowledgeable and made the dining experience a treat with helpful suggestions and just the right amount of banter for a chuckle or two. She directed me to a delicious cab red which was delightful and paired rather well with my dinner selection.

Because we all weren't famished we decided to go straight for our main courses. Now it may just have been a a poor selection on my part but I did decide to try one of the house specials, the sword fish which I will admit I had never tried before and it didn't really knock my socks off. However The gnocchi my cousin ordered was literally to die for it was melt in your mouth good and I believe made fresh in house. The parmesan chicken was another super flavorful and hearty dish but out of the three mine was unfortunately my least favorite. 

The delicious fresh baked Nutella bun was a real treat and def made up for my entree but I do feel that even though they claim to be authentic Italian they seemed to miss the mark a tad for me. For the price and portion sizes I felt that a little something was missing and as a result I'm a little on the fence when it comes to rating... In all fairness I would give them a 3 1/2 star but I would def return again."}
{"text":"My family and I went last night for dinner and it was fantastic! We had reservations and were seated quickly. We ordered to start...bruschetta pizza, grilled calamari and polenta fries.

The bruschetta pizza was fantastic! It's 10x better than regular bruschetta. The calamari were cooked perfectly...cut with a fork and tender not chewy! Which led to everyone fighting over the garnish for the calamari because that was equally delicious. The polenta fries were good as well but the calamari was the star.

For our entrees we ordered...

eggplant parm which was amazing! The sauce you could tell was homemade and delicious.

Linguine alla pescatore...fish and pasta again cooked to perfection. They were generous with the fish which is always appreciated! No here's a single shrimp for you kind of deal lol 

Gnocchi Sorrentina which was also fantastic! 

We also had the daily specials of fish which was great. However, the real winner which we all fought for a bite of was the Papardelle con Capra which is goat. It was amazing!!!! Our pickiest eaters loved it! 

After all this despite being stuffed to the brim we opted for dessert. We had tiramisù and a coconut cream cheesecake! They were amazing! Again you could tell they were homemade and fresh.

If you're looking for authentic Italian food and dining experience...this is it. No the restaurant is not huge and no you won't get in and get your meal in 3 minutes. This is true Italian dining. It's loud, it takes its time and it's delicious and worth every minute! 

My Italian father who does not eat out...left planning his next meal! Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"This is my first review ever and I felt so compelled to write this that I created an account especially to call out our experience. 

Was serviced by a man named Tony - who appears to permanently have a chip on his shoulder.

QUESTION: Can we order grilled Calamari?  
TONY: No.

QUESTION: Do you have a kids pasta? (had a table of 4 kids)  
TONY: No, kids don't come to this location. 

QUESTION: What's the catch of the day?  
TONY: Fish and Chips. 
QUESTION: May I have it un-breaded? I'm GF. 
TONY: No. 
***(What kind of \"FRESH\" catch of the day is FISH AND CHIPS?!)

QUESTION: There is something on your Richmond Hill online menu that's not on the menu here, can I order that? 
TONY: If you read the website properly you would have seen that it says \"subject to change at any time!\"

TONY: Hey lady, I don't make the rules. Joe does!

The tone with which he spoke was extremely condescending and left a very bad taste in our mouths (no pun intended).

Ultimately we left. My friend's kids who arrived very hungry stayed because I insisted they don't leave due to my poor experience, but she was visibly embarrassed for us. In fact we briefly argued about it because she wanted to leave as well. I'm sure the food was great - but service was terrible. 

Joe, if you really want customers to come back to your restaurant, you need to get rid of this guy! 

Likewise, you can't ask people in your own restaurants to only leave \"positive\" reviews as stated on the promo material sitting on the tables. We tried to address the issue \"before\" - as requested - to no avail. 

Finally, you need take on a more diplomatic approach when customers leave reviews you don't like or agree with on Google, Yelp, etc. The spirit of reviews is to be open to both positive AND negative. Perception is everything. Rather than retaliate against those customers by responding with YOUR WAITERS version of events (questionable as they don't want to lose their jobs!), you should address patrons more respectfully - because you yourself were NOT there. I get you have a small business to run and protect, but the readers following your replies to bad reviews are shaking their heads."}
{"text":"My husband was celebrating a special birthday. We looked for a Restaurant that would accommodate my husbands requests. Gnocchi is always a favourite of his and Thats Italians homemade version was light and delicious. They were so good my husband had two servings. The second course was rabbit another favourite. I can't bring myself to cook such a furry friend so he had his craving filled.  We had a set menu which included a fresh Caesar salad, gnocchi, rabbit cooked in a red wine and tomato sauce with potatoes and green beans. Food was delicious. The staff where friendly and funny. They gave us a glass of champagne each to toast the occasion. Highly recommend this restaurant to eat."}
{"text":"My wife and I just finished an early Sunday dinner here.  We were in the mood for some great pizza, and Yelp led us to this little gem we wouldn't have found otherwise.

I had the quattro pizza and she had the vegan friendly pasta.  Both very delicious meals.

This place was surprisingly very upscale on the inside,  even though the outside is a bit misleading.

Food was fantastic, but a tad overpriced which is why the 4 stars.  

Will definitely be back at some point.

**UPDATE** It's been 2 days since I've been here and I've been sick both days from something I ate.  Not food poisoning,  but something here did not agree with me at all."}

The atmosphere was friendly and the price was reasonable."}

The order took a little bit to come out but that was understandable because we came right when hey opened but the wait was totally worth it! The service was great and very friendly. Between three people we ordered a pizza and a pasta to share which was more than enough. The pizza was made with fresh ingredients and was stone baked. It was nice and thin but not soggy like other ones I've had, this one had a good crunch to it. The chilli oil they give is also really good and has nice flavour with just the right amount of spice. Although the pizza is their specialty here what really blew us away was the pasta we ordered. The texture of the pasta was perfect and the heaviness of the cream sauce didn't make me feel sleepy or overly fatty tasting. It was a generous size serving and more than enough for the three of us. I will definitely be coming back here."}
{"text":"Went on saturday, and was completely surprised by the experience.  It doesn't look like much from the exterior.  However when you are walk in there are a few tables and the interior is nicely decorated and very clean.

The food was excellent, pizzas are great, pastas look yummy, calamari looks  yummy, fresh salads, great fish entree, and excellent wine selection too.

Waiter was friendly and attentive.

If you are planning on going highly recommend making a reservation as there are not many tables."}
{"text":"Really good pizza and amazing pastabusy night no reservation they squeezed us in next time we make a reservation but really good looking food"}
{"text":"Great place but Saturday nights be prepared for a long wait on take out or delivery.  Else dine-in seems to be good.   Online menu is up to date as opposed to the paper take out menu in house.  Good variety and great food!"}
{"text":"I love this place so so much. The have the best thin crust pizza as well as gluten free pizza. Absolutely amazing."}

That's Italian was pretty good! Came here for lunch on a weekday and got seated immediately without a reservation. The restaurant was quite easy to find and there is ample parking in the parking lot. 

The restaurant is very clean and is decorated modernly - yet still has a nice home-y feel to it. The server provided us with the daily special as well as the full menu (there's no special menu for lunch). 

I tried the daily special which was gnocchi in a cheesy sauce with truffle oil and mushrooms, as well as the nodini as an appetizer. 

The fresh bread and nodini came first and that was absolutely delicious! Nodini is a pizza dough twist with garlic and cheese sprinkled on top. It was perfectly crispy and great for sharing. 

The gnocchi came next and it was delicious as well. Perfectly cooked, and the flavours were incredibly rich. A classic dish executed amazingly. However, the sauce was a bit heavy. Next time I would opt for a tomato sauce as gnocchi tends to be very filling, and the creamy sauce made it even more filling. If you have a big appetite, it's perfect! 

The service was great! Very fast, friendly and courteous. The lighting was also perfect for food photography, which us Yelpers really appreciate ;) 

It is a bit on the pricey side, but definitely worth it. I'll add this to my list of places to visit regularly."}
{"text":"The portion of the food and the wine is great compared to any Italian restaurants you would go in Toronto, I guess that's because this is Italian area. I had the sea bass which was very soft and good, glass of wine was very generous in portion for only $8 glass.
Based on what the party says, the food was great, potions good and service not bad at all. Good atmosphere as well. I would certainly come back again and try the pastas and pizzas. Should make good venue for valentine, anniversary, birthday, etc."}
{"text":"Usually get take out here once a week  Food is outstanding and quality is always high.  Their online ordering system is great and portions are generous.  Love this place."}
{"text":"This review is based on my experience during Savour York Region $25 Dinner Menu at That's Italian Express.

* My Choice from the Winterfest 2014 Menu *
Insalata di Funghi Misti - Warm Mushroom Salad was so good, high recommend if you are a mushroom lover like me! (I don't see this on regular menu...)
Pizza a Scelta Sidernese - Prosciutto Heaven! Though this is a white pizza with no sauce at all 
Tiramisu - House made was just so creamy!

*My Dinner mate Choice from the Regular Menu* (yawn)
Caesar Salad ($8) - Standard, nothing compare to Insalata di Funghi Misti!
Linguine Pescatore ($18) - Noodle a little overcooked but quite enjoyable!

Seems like the dish I choose from the Winterfest menu was a hit as I was forced to share my food with my dinner mate while I have zero interest in his salad or pasta!

Service was really attentive. 

We were also given a Lucky Red Pocket at the end of the meal with a $10 gift card to celebrate Chinese New Year. I guess I will be back again!

Just note: that their Home made Spicy oil is good but really spicy!  And the menu has less selection than That's Italian Ristorante in Woodbridge."}
{"text":"Dropped by That's Italian Ristorante for Savour York Region 2013: Lunch Menu $20

Polpetti Al Forono - Homemade Italian Meatballs smothered in tomato sauce, topped with Grana Padano Cheeses and served with crostini

Fettuccine Di Bosco - Truffle-scented cream sauce, portobello and porcini mushroom topped with crispy Italian pancetta

Tiramisu 

Food is quite delicious. Love the rich creamy pasta. Meatballs were a little cold inside. Tiramisu made in house was divine!

The service though is definitely an issue. There was only 1 waitress working during lunch shift while I was dining in and being understaffed, service definitely lacking. I do feel sorry for the lone waitress but I don't like to feel I am such a nuisance when I ask for some iced water 3 times when my glass never got filled up since I sat down."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of eating at That's Italian when my Zio (uncle) recommended it last minute. We had already made reservations at a nearby Italian restaurant but decided to try this place out. We walked into what seemed like a tiny restaurant (much more seating downstairs) and were excited for an authentic Italian dinner. 

Service: First and foremost our server, Janette, was great.  I am guilty of being very critical over service but Janette did her job seamlessly. She was courteous but not pushy and validated our experience by asking how everything was when we were enjoying it. The hostess was also appreciated by offering us a espresso when we finished eating and delivering it promptly. 

The food: We order grilled calamari as an appetizer which was delicious (Guilty pleasure is that I prefer fried). I ordered the grey goose penne alla vodka. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. Why you ask?
- Huge portion
- Full of flavour
- Panchetta.. You can't go wrong with panchetta 
- Who doesn't like premium liquor?

On a side note - I am impressed by the owners involvement on this yelp page! Going the extra mile to impress your customers is what keeps a restaurant successful for many years."}
{"text":"Polenta fries are delicious! Pizza is also very tasty. If you are hungry do not share the pizza, order one for each person. Very cozy place as well."}
{"text":"Had a great evening with delicious food, pleasant decor and good service.  The seafood linguini had generous portions of seafood. Brother had vodka penne - very flavorful.  Friend had veal in lemon caper sauce.  Quite lemony but good.  Side veggies were perfectly cooked - broccoli, tender green beans and heavenly little roasted potatoes.  Wine options by the glass, half bottle and full bottle with several Italian beers to wash it all down.  I live in TX but will definitely come back when I'm in town."}
{"text":"This would be a 5 star rating had it not been for the uneven service. Food was AMAZING!

We visited this restaurant as a friend had heard about it and wanted to try it for her birthday. Reservations were made and our table was ready when we arrived.

Our waitress was quite welcoming, asked if we had ever visited before and then made some recommendations. We ordered a bottle of wine and appetizers......fresh, lightly dressed salads...excellent...and a pizza. It was excellent as well.

As I was the DD for the evening, I ordered a pop....it did not come when the wine came. Asked again...waitress apologized and said she would bring it right over. Didn't. Asked a third time.....same drill..an apology but still no pop. Our appetizers came and were consumed....still no drink....main course arrived...still no drink. Asked again.....same routine. Finally..after asking for it a 5th time, she went and got (I'd say a good 45 minutes after the first time asking for it). Every time she said she'd get it...she'd wander off elsewhere...a few times (while walking by) she'd say...\"I'll get you your pop\" but never did. It became a running joke at our table.

Our food was delicious. I ordered the gnocchi...perhaps the best I've ever had at a restaurant. 5 plus stars (yes it was that good). Dining companions ordered a pizza (said it was amazing), penne a la vodka (excellent), scaloppini (excellent as well).

Dessert had to be ordered as well.....and as the cakes were from the Cheesecake Factory bakery, it was mandatory (lol). They did not disappoint.

Ordered a tea while companions ordered coffees, lattes, cappuccinos. My tea did not come...had to ask for it. Apology again...but still no tea. Asked a 2nd time...she finally brought it over and apologized while laughing and saying something about a mental block concerning my drink orders. 

In summary...the food was excellent, nice dining atmosphere, EXCELLENT food, excellent desserts, VERY POOR SERVICE. 

Would love to go back, but memories of the service has prevented it from happening."}
{"text":"It just wasn't my style. Based on the pictures and menu I was hoping the atmosphere and ambiance of the restaurant would be more quiet / romantic, but it's more on the casual side. 

As far as positives go, the wait staff was very attentive, provided us with things like butter for the bread when we asked. We were seated quickly, and the fixtures in the restaurant all look quite new, and stylish (particularly liked the style of the stone tile feature wall along the back of the dining room)

The bruschetta was much more cheesy than typical bruschetta. We found some of the food to be very salty. The calamari didn't have any form of breading as you would expect, and was served on paper with tongs.

For main course we both tried the seafood linguine - portion was good and there was a good amount of seafood included, but again, the saltiness was too much. 

Based on the reviews here, it appears that many people do enjoy this restaurant, so my opinion is in the minority. There was clearly a disconnect between expectations and experience, and in the end this place is not for me, but glad to see that a family restaurant can maintain clientele and business in the competitive restaurant industry for so many years. that alone is something to be proud of.

**Added November 7th in response to manager**
The pictures of the restaurant look quite nice, that's why we decided to go. It's not that we are looking for booths or some privacy or anything, in fact, we were just hoping to get the atmosphere that the pictures portrayed. I have nothing against the big family dining locations, I often find more to enjoy in a place like that, my comment is merely to point out the disconnect experienced between the beautiful pictures shown and the in-person experience. And I did look at reviews, and found mentions of quiet, - one literally said \"Classy jazzy quaint and romantic\".

As for the saltiness, I didn't mean to imply the bruschetta was salty - I have edited that in the description above to clarify. Regarding cheesiness, I'll be honest, only on the rarest occasions have I had bruschetta with cheese, and even then it's only a little. I guess I am more used to the more common style that doesn't have a lot of cheese.

The calamari was on the salty side, but sometimes calamari is prepared that way, so I can accept that. It's just the calamari wasn't breaded as you typically expect. I'm by no means a chef, but this was the first time I've ever had 'fried' calamari that didn't have a little crispiness to the fried batter. There wasn't really any notable batter at all. You are right though, I did see the picture showing the calamari, and that should have signaled to me, but pictures are often an unfair judgement, and taste should be what matters, which is why I gave it a shot (it's one of the items I typically order at Italian restaurants.)

We ordered the seafood pasta because that's my favourite dish, and I was glad to see you had one on the menu - which I certainly reviewed before visiting, in no way am I expecting Michelin-star food. The seafood pasta was definitely salty. I don't know if that came from the sauce, or how the seafood was seasoned / prepared, but it was. And though I didn't mention it before, the shrimp used in the seafood pasta were cocktail shrimp - which get rubbery when cooked again...

You are right, I didn't mention the good qualities, so I have added that above as well so that it counts. I'll even bump up the rating, because I do appreciate your effort to reach out..."}
{"text":"My friend and I arrived at That's Italian, this being my second visit but it being his first. We were promptly seated and as soon as we ordered, a small basket of bread was given to us on the house. The bread appeared to be just freshly toasted and lightly kissed with melted butter. Shortly after we dived into snacking on the bread, we were informed they had just run out of lasagna. To apologize for this, they gave us some deli meat to snack on.

I noticed our glasses of water were constantly refilled meaning that they were attentive towards our needs. Also, the way the restaurant is decorated makes it look very fancy despite the fact that you can come in for just a casual meal. I definitely felt more high class than usual because of the decor. 

The food was honestly just as good as the first time I ate here. Both times, I received such a large portion for what I paid for that  I had to ask for a takeout container so that I could finish it at a later time. 

Oh, don't forget to check in using Yelp at this place. I heard they switch up the promotional deal when you check in but when I did it, I received 10% off my total on the bill!

I will definitely be coming back again!

Visited on November 6th!"}
{"text":"Ordered from That's Italian Express a while back to cater a party I hosted, I am only now getting the chance to review it. I ordered 2 different types of pasta (alfredo & alla vodka), a party size margherita pizza, and a caesar salad tray for my guests and I. 

The food was prepared as requested. Everything was there and the pickup process was right on time, this is where That's Italian Express scores its bonus star. 

Speaking to the food, I was very underwhelmed with the quality in contrast to what I paid for it. The alla vodka sauce did not have much taste and the alfredo had the consistency of glue. The pizza was very average, but not enough to warrant me giving the restaurant another star. The caesar salad I found to be extremely overpriced. For $25 I could have purchased enough lettuce, croutons, cheese, and dressing to make nearly 5x that amount. This, however was my mistake for ordering it. 

All in all, below average take-out pasta and OK pizza leads me to believe that I will not be returning to this restaurant."}
{"text":"After seeing great reviews and delicious posts on Instagram, I decided to give this restaurant a try. Best choice ever. The service was amazing. Joe and Tony makes you feel like family. The calamari was my favourite! The batter was light and airy, absolutely delicious. The pasta was good, but the pizza was better! Yummmm. Although the drive took forever, food was great.  Definitely coming back again."}
{"text":"After reading so much about this place, the little lady decided without any uncertainties that we are going Italian.

That's Italian is located north of Major Mac on Yonge (actually north of Crosby for those who are familiar).  You will probably see the Dairy Queen sign before you see their sign.  Plenty of parking - actually when we went, prime time dinner hour, there were parking everywhere as we were the only ones at this restaurant.  Kind of made me nervous - what is wrong with the place?

We still went in and sat down.  The place is family run and have homemade food.  According to our server (I guess he's familia), they do a lot of catering and take out.  I hope so as we were the only peeps during our whole dinner time.

We had the Americano and Quattro Stagione Pizzas, Arancini, Chicken Parm with Penne.  The portions were quite large.  I would say their pizzas are equivalent to in size to a medium pizza nova.  The Parm was huge and delicious.  The Arancini - hmmm...OK.

Overall, the meal was enjoyed by the fam.  We even had to take some food home.  The meal wasn't too expensive but not sure if we wanted to make the trip back up when I have Abruzzo's across the street.

Hope business picks up for them as they do serve good homemade food.

Cheers!"}
