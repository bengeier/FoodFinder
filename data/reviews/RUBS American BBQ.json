{"text":"Excellent barbecue. Tried ribs, pulled park, brisket and beer, enjoyed them all.
Don't miss brisket (egg roll) appetizer"}
{"text":"Although their beef rib melts in your mouth, I found something that just didn't belong: a leftover tooth pick in my smoked jalapeno pepper. The food was absolutely delicious but proceed with caution."}
{"text":"This place was both awesome and hilarious. They have an amazing peach cocktail. For the first round of drinks, we all got different cocktails/wine. For the second round of drinks, we all got peach cocktails. I had the macaroni and cheese burger and it was phenomenal. For why it was hilarious - it was like walking into an answer to \"What is the 'American' stereotype to Canadians?\", and the answer was country music, American flags, and macaroni and cheese burgers."}
{"text":"Très bon resto bbq j'ai manger dans les meilleurs bbq aux États Unis et je vous le recommande sans esiter"}
{"text":"We have been here a couple of times by ourselves and with friends. The concept is cool; mega-meat fest. :-)  Vegetarians will not have an easy time finding something. lol.

Lots of creative dishes, and HUGE portions. I couldn`t bring myself to order the chocolate-covered bacon with ice cream.. lol. 

I found the decor rather dark, but nice."}
{"text":"Wow this place is outstanding. A true American bbq joint. No microwaves. No freezer. Everything fresh and cooked or smoked perfectly. The food quality is crazy. Menu has so many options. Can't wait to try more. It inspired me to buy my own smoker at home. Jalapeño poppers are to die for. A great bar to watch sports at. I am definitely making it my place to watch hockey next season. The service is great. Fully bilingual. Manager is always present. I really am impressed by the concept and how well the execute the idea of American bbq. Way better than la belle et la boeuf. The brisket is mouth watering. Ample seating. Tons of parking. Just watch that waste line because nothing in there seems low cal lol. I've been twice and I will continue to keep going."}
{"text":"Highly over-rated and over priced. I had the ribs, mediocre and cold. Plate was dirty and poorly presented. My server was lost even though the place was quiet. He seemed uninterested and poorly trained. Maybe he was a \"newby\" but not a excuse for no effort.
Not recommended...I liked this place better when it was Rotisserie Scores. At least I was getting value for my money :("}
{"text":"Entrer pour manger seulement une bouchée sans trop de flafla. J'ai pris une Poutine avec une sauce au goût fort de \"gras-fumée\" qui au début me semblait trop fort mais auquel je me suis habitué sans problèmes. Le seul défaut était le fromage froid ce qui nuisait au bon goût.  À corriger. Je vais y retourner pour essayer d'autres choses.  J'aimerais qu'ils proposent une sorte de sandwich au buf fumée genre \"smoke meat\" que je n'ai pas vu sur le menu."}
{"text":"Beef ribs were good. I wouldn't compare it to Lockhart Texas but a good place for carnivores. Service was a little slow although the restaurant wasn't very busy."}
{"text":"viande plus fumée que cuite. Pas dans mes goûts. Très prisé par les anglophones Atmosphère sympathique et décontracté Faites vous une opinion car c'est particulier !"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. Service was below par. Asked some questions about the food and the answers didn't match what we received. It was Saturday night but the service was very slow."}
{"text":"Amazing! We tried the ribs and pulled pork and the meat was fall off the bone delicious - moist and packed full of flavour. Fries were also super crispy and tasty. Tried the smoked Mac and cheese but it was just so so for me."}
{"text":"My husband and I, with our 2 kids, stopped by on our way to Tremblant. The food was outstanding. I  ordered the Brie burger and he ordered the baby back ribs. The burger was one of the best I've ever had,sweet and spicy BBQ sauce with Brie cheese and smoked bacon. The baby back ribs fell off the bench be and had an outstanding smoker flavor. The kids loved the mac and cheese burger. 

The service was excellent. Our waiter was very attentive and the food arrived promptly. It was the perfect stop over on a long drive. 

Thank you Rubs!"}
{"text":"I had the fortune to travel to 49 states mostly down south. Texas; Tennessee; Kentucky and North and South Carolina just to Name a few where I've tasted some of the best BBQ.

RUBS is not only good BBQ but is in my top 5. I went there after a friend told me about the Prince Arthur restaurant and have been going ever since.

Service is great and the food holds it own. Recently, I took my Friend from San Antonio TX. As we walked in I saw Mike (owner) and told him where my friend was from and we came straight from the airport. He didn't have too but he said if he didn't like them we wouldn't have to pay.
Well we ordered the Brisket Nachos;  beef Ribs and Pork Ribs. Well we happily paid for our meal and I would highly recommend it.

My son swears that the burger is the greatest he has ever had. I haven't had it myself but he doesn't throw  comments like that easily. 

Thanks for placing your comments. They are helpful for me."}
{"text":"Samedi soir 10 d attendre, le restaurant bondé,  5 min d attend à la table le super serveur prend la commande et en 2 min on a nos boisson et 5 min nos repas et entre. J ai pris l'gros cochons, super gros et bon. Serveur super gentil et très efficace ( George).  Pas de dessert, j ai trop manger."}
{"text":"Très bon service, très bonne bouffe mais un peu cher,nous allons y retourner ç'est certain."}
{"text":"I signed up to Yelp just to give these guys the credit they deserve. Stopped by here during the summer and was blown away by their smoked wings and ribs. Flavour profile that you can't get any other way other than taking the time to smoke them just right. Haven't had ribs this good since I was a kid growing up in Detroit . If you need anymore convincing, their freebie snack to munch on while the rest of the food comes is deep fried smoked bacon bits."}
{"text":"I used to go to their location in Montreal quite often, and now that this one has opened up closer to my house I go a lot more! The food is just as great as always, while the continue to add items to their menu. I'm a bit confused with these negative reviews about their service seeing as I always have exceptional service. I suggest you try this restaurant out for yourself, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Being on my list of restaurants to try, my son and I visited tonight. We started with smoked chicken wings and they were not tender and lacked seasoning. My son had ribs (again lack of sauce and seasoning). The side of mac & cheese and fries were very ordinary. I had the brisket and although very tender it was fatty and tasteless. When we barely finished we were asked if we wanted dessert and when we said no, we promptly got the bill. $110 with 3 beers for less than average food is insane. Way overrated and can't understand why people go there with so many good restaurants out there."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of ribs, but once in a while, I have a craving for it. Wanted to check out this place as I haven't really found a resto that serves good ribs, and I must say that this is the place!

Ordered the chickens strips and the Kentucky fried wings. The chicken strips were a tad bit dry, but the wings were amazing.

Got the smoked beef brisket plate with fries and coleslaw. Found the coleslaw a little too sweet for my liking. Loved the crispy fries and how they had an almost burnt taste to them. The brisket was tender and juicy, loved the fat on it as well.

Got to try the St. Louis ribs, and they melted off the bone. Lots of meat, and liked the fact that our waiter Chris gave us extra sauces to try out as it was our first time.

Our waiter Chris was very attentive, answered all of our questions and very friendly, service was quick.

Couldn't finish my meal, portions are huge, ended up taking it to go. 

Also had a Yelp coupon for a free beer with a purchase of an entree, so that was pretty nice.

Overall had a enjoyable experience, will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Great food, a little expensive. Smoked beans = Awesome. Big Hog = Awesome. Smoked Meat Brisket = OK"}
{"text":"Ce fumoir n'a rien à envier aux bbq américain.  Très appréciée ma longe de porc dans sauce au pêche. Les côtes levées sont ecourantes selon mon chum qui en mange fréquemment ailleurs."}
{"text":"French or Italian restaurant will serve you bread to start... Well here you get sinfully delicious fried bacon bits! This place isn't for the faint of heart.

Their smoked chicken wings are the best around town. Nice crispy and smoky on the outside, tender and juicy on the inside.

All appetizers (wings and chili) and main dishes we tried were very good. Tender and juicy meat great flavor. Side dishes were a disappointment though (such as fries or mac n cheese). Portions are substantial but you can bring home the left-over.

Strongly recommended for hungry men! I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Been there once & I agree is totally different concept ...a smoke house which they don't have stove or microwave to heat up ...would go back & good ambience"}
{"text":"The food was great. Real big ribs. Service was awesome too. Stay away from the apple pie. Cold as ice and tasted like dough"}
{"text":"C'est le fun de finalement avoir autre chose dans le coin, vu que le cartier Sainte Rose est pas trop touristique! La bouffe était bonne, vraiment américain. Un peu cher par contre, raisonable voyant la grosseur des assietes! Le serveur était gentil, pas de trouble pour ça!"}
{"text":"Resto bien situé sur Curé-Labelle. J'ai goûté à plusieurs éléments du menu et je dois dire que le poulet est délicieux. Que ce soit les ailes de poulet, le poulet fumé ou le classique poulet frit et gauffre. Je recommande aussi tous les mets qui contiennent leur porc effiloché qui est succulent. Petite mention à ceux qui aime manger épicé... vous devez essayer l'entrée de piments jalapeño fumés. 
Ce resto plutôt relax convient bien aux réunions entre amis ou seulement pour prendre une bière et quelques ailes de poulet ;) (le bar est vraiment bien)."}
{"text":"Love the ambience. Staff is super friendly & fast service. Has to be one of the best smokehouses in Laval for sure!! Enjoy their take out & enjoy going to the resto. Definitely one of my go to s if I am craving me some rubs!"}
{"text":"My last review was 5 stars but I have been twice after that and both time the waiter was borderline rude, the service was slow and the food was not good at all. 

I was shocked because its a much different experience than what encountered before. 

Both time I went during the Fifa and the place was empty. The first time we had a few different appetizers and they were cold and the blooming onion was greasier than usual. The second time I had the tacos and I was expecting soft shells but to my surprise I got stale old el paso hard shell tacos. The filling was ok but not great.

Not sure now if I will be going back kinda left a bad taste in my mouth"}
{"text":"After hearing about Rubs from many people, we decided to finally drive out last weekend to have dinner there. It was a Saturday night and we were very quickly seated around 8pm. Upon a quick glance at menu, I literally wanted to order one of everything. Instead, I decided for the next best thing: a platter to share with hubby full of ribs, brisket, smoked chicken, pulled pork, sweet potato fries, mac n cheese, and coleslaw. Sounds like a lot of food, right? Well, yes. But you better believe we ate it all (except for a couple spoonfuls of pork)!! The food came out pretty fast for a Saturday night and was pretty yummy. The chicken was delicious!! The ribs were flavourful but not fall-off-the bone as they should be while the brisket was yummy but incorrectly textured (super dry). The pulled pork was great as were all the sides. Overall, for $50, and for the portions you get, we were happy. Would we come back? Not really but just because there are other restaurants that offer the same cuisine more central to downtown with the same or better taste/quality. Definitely a good place to eat and would give it a solid 3.5 but rounding up for great service throughout the evening."}
{"text":"The ambiance was alright.  A lot of choices on the menu.  The ribs were not nearly as tender as they should have been.  Pulled pork was good.  Coleslaw was too small and the blooming onion a little pricy for the size.  Had trouble keeping our water full.  Chicken was good."}
{"text":"BBQ at it's finest!

I've eaten here a couple of times and these guys can smoke meat! I've ordered the pulled pork; it was excellent. I've ordered the St. Louis ribs; also excellent. The beef ribs; excellent!!! See where I'm going here?

I can't say I've been blown away by the side dishes, though. The mac n' cheese was average and the smoked vegetables lacked flavor. All you taste is smoke. The coleslaw is ok, but can also use an overhaul. The meat is really the star of the show. The sides are the back-up singers you don't really pay attention to. The portions are big but not obscene. 

I had the chocolate covered bacon and ice cream for dessert. It was ok for me, but the others I've dined with found it to be outstanding. It's bacon and ice cream- i could take it or leave it. It's a big portion so it's easily big enough to share with another person (or 2)!

Service is ok. Again, not outstanding, but they get the job done I guess. Prices are reasonable as well."}
{"text":"Un match hors concours du Canadiens et pas capable de changer la dernière TV du coin du bar pour regarder le match de l'impact. #bigfail"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place. We had a blooming onion, for 10$ that's an amazing entree. Big, crispy and tasty. So worth it. We then took the Texas Platter for 2 (could easily feed 4). The beef ribs are by far the best thing!! Some of the best ribs I've had. The pulled pork was very good but not exceptional. The brisket and chicken were tasty but dry. I'm happy I got to try abit of everything. The coselaw is very good not creamy or vinegary. 
I can't wait to go back to try the chicken and waffles and the bacon brownie Sunday."}
{"text":"I definitely miss me some good ol' American BBQ. So when my boo invited me to a family outing at \"some American BBQ place in the burbs,\" I was IN! To my surprise, RUBS didn't just suffice, it actually surpassed my expectations. The St Louis style ribs were nicely smoked, sticky, and fell off the bone just right. The prime rib was grilled to perfection, nice and juicy. But what threw me for a loop was the ice cream sundae with chocolate covered bacon. WHUT!?! Indulgent and probably over the top but you only live once! The atmosphere is nice and family friendly, they had some nice cocktails as well. Definitely planning on coming back, probably to the one in the Plateau since that's a little closer, but who knows, maybe if we happen to be in Laval we'll make a pit stop here :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner at RUBS American BBQ recently and I have to say, it was pretty good.  The prices and portions remind me of America!  In other words, reasonable prices and large portions.  

I had the Pulled Chicken Tacos ($15) and my husband got the Smoked Salmon ($19). 

My tacos came with 2 sides and I ordered fries and coleslaw.  They accidentally gave me sweet potato fries instead of regular fries, but hey I didn't complain because I also like sweet potato fries (and they are usually an extra $3). Free upgrade, woo hoo!  :)  The tacos were stuffed with meat and cheese.  There was so much meat in there; it was pretty awesome.  They were tasty too.  The pulled chicken was tender and smoky.  The only thing I was slightly disappointed with was that the soft taco shells were made of flour instead of corn.  They did hold up well though and it wasn't a soggy mess.  I got 3 tacos with my order and they were huge.  I gave my husband an entire taco and I was still full (at most places, if I gave away 1/3 of my meal, I'd be left pretty hungry).  The coleslaw was vinaigrette based and not mayo based, which I liked.  The sweet potato fries were good.  They were not battered, which I appreciated. 

My husband's dish automatically came with smoked vegetables and his choice of 1 side.  He chose regular fries and received regular fries.  I had some of his salmon and it was good, although it didn't have a strong smoked flavour.  The vegetables he got were bell peppers, corn, asparagus and zucchini.  I had a piece of bell pepper and it was good, although a bit too oily.  I had some of his fries and they were good too.  They are also not battered and were fried to golden perfection.

Our server was nice and he was attentive.

Decor is typical of mega-restaurants.

Overall, I thought the food was good, and we got a lot of food for what we paid.

I would come back, although I'd probably go to their Montreal location since I'm hardly ever in Laval."}
{"text":"Fries were amazing, the beans are great, coleslaw is fresh and the beef ribs are excellent."}
{"text":"I've had the good fortune to eat at Rubs a few times. Each time the service was amazing; as good and/or better than the last. Never had to wait when reserving ahead of time, and you will want to do that. The place is always full, which should already tell you not only is the service fantastic but the food is gastronomic....but make sure you bring and appetite, you'll need it! For the best ribs and smoked cooking that rivals Memphis and Texas BBQ's, I highly recommend Rubs!"}
{"text":"After all the rave reviews from fellow yelpers, how could I not try this place? As expected, it did not disappoint. We tried the blooming onion (so good!!!) and the Mac n cheese donuts (kinda bland if eating without the accompanying dipping sauce). For the mains, we had the beef ribs (tender and fall off that massive bone) and the fried chicken and waffle which I preferred over the beef ribs. For the sides, I tried the smoked vegetables which I highly recommend, in fact I could eat a whole plate of those as a main! Service was excellent, and the restaurant was kid friendly, my son stared at the giant smoker for the longest time and at one point there was a line up of kids standing alongside it mesmerized!"}
{"text":"Bon resto familial. Portions gigantesque pour appétit et shape de cowboy. Ne commandez rien pour le plus jeune, LOL! Un peu cher mais vu les portions c'est correct. Une vraie cuisine du Sud des États-Unis avec des classiques comme le Mac N' Cheese, le poulet frit et gaufres et les ribs. J'aime aussi beaucoup les fèves fumées en accompagnement et la salade de chou. Le repas est assez gras et lourd par contre alors prévoir une petite marche pour digérer..."}
{"text":"MEAT MEAT MEAT TASTY MEAT

Restaurant proposant toutes les formes populaires du US BBQ, du Texas, à la Caroline du Sud en passant par le Missouri ... les portions sont plus que correctes, c'est généreux, c'est pour la plupart des cuissons à basse température pendant une demi-journée voir plus, génial !

En repas du midi, vous aurez le droit à des petits prix pour un plat énorme, les côtes St Louis, assez généreuses même en \"demi-portion\", je n'ose imaginer la portion \"normale\" avec un slide et une boisson, le tout pour 16 dollars, c'est donné.

Si les côtes St Louis sont très bonnes (surtout grâce à la sauce dans laquelle ils ont été marinées), j'ai un peu moins été emballé par le Brisket (plat star du Texas) car j'en ai déjà mangé du meilleur et surtout plus fin, mais il restait bon et la croûte sel&poivre plutôt bien réussie. Coté slides, les frites sont correctes et servies en quantité, le coleslaw est aussi bon, et le mac&cheese fumé plutôt pas mal.

RUBS est au final un genre de disneyland pour amoureux du BBQ, avec la décoration très far west et très clean, les grands écrans qui passent des clips et des spots RUBS à reste sympa tout comme le service !

Petit plus : la petite odeur de fumé quand on rentre dans le restaurant, dû au fumoir !

Sinon, j'en rêve, mais je n'ai pas pu le tester, faute de place dans l'estomac : le poulet frit servi sur gaufre de Georgie ... une prochaine foiiiiis ?"}
{"text":"I have been ranting and raving about this place since our last yelp event and finally was in the neighbourhood so dropped in for a early dinner.

We were greeted by a nice guy named pascale who led us right to the bar section and gave us a booth. As soon as I checked in I had the option to use my free molson  Canadian beer when I bought a entree so why not ? We both got two to share, the wings & pickles. Both were good but I would pick Alabama white sauce next time instead of the blue cheese one that comes with it.

For drinks we both love bourbon so why not a pitcher of the bourbon lemonade. It was good not to strong and pascale came by to fill us up when ever it looked half empty. Great service.

For the main we shared the beef rib for 35$. Last time I had it it blew my
Mind and this time it did the same thing. There's no place I know in Montreal where you can get such a hearty slab of meat for that price. It was very good and exactly what the doctor ordered. 

I ended up using my gift card I won for the bloody Cesar contest and our waiter was actually there and got to taste the 3 finalist cocktails which I didn't remember but it was nice that he remembered.

I love this place they really have a great staff and I'm dying to take the classes next spring !"}
{"text":"Went a Sunday afternoon and the place wasn't busy. The beef ribs were perfect and  had a great flavour. Unfortunately the rack of pork ribs was still cold in the middle which was puzzling."}
{"text":"Fantastic St-Louis style ribs. Great Mac & cheese. Drinks are great. Service is super slow. We waited one hour for our food! Not normal in this kind of restaurant. You expect that from a hipster, griffintown, nouveau-style eatery. Next time I'll make sure I eat before going to eat there so I won't starve to death!!"}
{"text":"De loin mon Resto favoris à Laval. Le seul bémol leurs choix musical. Par contre la bouffe est superbe!!!!!"}
{"text":"Miam. Love this place. Delicious food. Love the Mexican bulldogs, basically a margarita with a corona in it. Wings are killer. Brisket is delicious. Ribs are the shiznit! This place rocks. Make no mistake, this is the real deal."}
{"text":"Let me get this out of the way first: Any restaurant that upon being seated offers you \"Bar Bacon\" instead of bread is fucktits awesome.

Which is what this place does.
What is \"Bar Bacon\" you ask? Just incredibly spiced fried pieces of bacon for your munching pleasure. 
Yeah.

What else is good?
How about a ghost pepper Bloody Caesar?
Or stupidly big, tasty & tender beef ribs?
What about some great beans as a side?
Yeah.

Go here.
But come hungry, because they serve you \"holiday at grandma's house\" sized plates."}
{"text":"For the meat lover. Just like down south. Smoked bbq. Very tasty and moist. We were 10 large men and ordered two platters of meat. We didn't finish them. Nothing healthy here. Bring your meds and your alcaseltzer. Sides are just as expected, beans fries coleslaw mac n cheese. My favourite would be the beef brisket. They have tvs and a bar like decor. Two locations. Its good but not too often if you are watching your weight or cholesterol."}
{"text":"Very very very good chicken thigh. One of the most tender and juicy meat I've eaten. Seasonned and grilled to perfection."}
{"text":"Holy mother of God this is soooo nasty GOOOOOD!!!!
I had the 16once burger, with fries and regular coleslaw and NOTHING WAS REGULAR ABOUT THIS MEAL! Gorgeous restaurant with a great ambiance and really nasty good burgers. Will be back asap. Here or at the one on Prince Arthur later on this summer. Fantastic greasy spoon kinda resto with a western style decor in Fabreville?  Yes! Worth the detour!"}
{"text":"Nous adorons ce resto! Donc nous sommes gagnées d'avance! Cette fois nous avons opté pour des hamburgers! La viande étais succulente! Juste un petit bémol! Pas de condiments ou presque! Un peu de sauce et fromage! Et c'est tout! Je sais que c'était la description! Suggestion: ajouter tomate salade et ognons hihihi!"}
{"text":"Ribs, ribs and more ribs!  They're smoked and they just fall off the bone! The only word to use is delicious. Always have room for dessert and I ordered the key lime in a mason jar. Refreshing! I was disappointed that the cappuccino machine was not working, had to have ordinary coffee. Lol. Will return when craving comes  back. Heard the Brisket  is also something to try. Next time...btw they have tv's throughout and  I wanted to watch the Golden Knights win another game... they did."}
{"text":"Complimentary bacon bits. Quite tasty. 
Ribs and jalapeño poppers are spot on! 
Reservation recommended."}
{"text":"So this was my second time at Rubs and the meal was tastier this time around with the pulled pork sandwich. I tried the ribs and Mac and cheese the first time and I wasn't very impressed, maybe I just have high standards? I thought the ribs were a bit dry but I'm also used to baby back ribs fall off the bone type which is not the case at Rubs I also like sharp cheese in my M&C and thought it was a bit too bland and \"liquidy\" to my liking. Service is always nice, friendly and quick however it wasn't busy so I don't know how it is on Saturday nights. The Pulled pork sandwich was really juicy and bursting with flavor but I wasn't really into the coleslaw, I usually like mine with a vinegary kick and I kept craving pickles with this sandwich for some reason. Overall I would go back for this sandwich and ask for pickles and try different sides. Worth a visit that's for sure !"}
{"text":"If you like the taste sauce and seasonings, you will like rubs very much, but if you like the taste of smoked pork and beef never go there. I took the onion blossom and it tasted like oil and seasoning, the spicy mayonnaise was good to hide that. Also, I had the monster burger, a burger with beef patty, pulled pork, cheese and bacon, the meat was over cooked and the only thing I was able to taste was the surgary flavor of the sauce for the pulled pork and nothing else. 50$ for all this, is a huge deception, over priced for a less than average meal."}
{"text":"You HAVE to bring your apetit with you for sure, because its definitively not for those on a diet!

Food is good (southern fried chicken with a waffle and a yummy jack daniel's maple sirup, fried coolaid pickle, ribs, etc.) all is good, but in very large quantity. I often only have an apetizer. 

Sitting at the bar during a Habs game is the best!"}
{"text":"It's quite a pricey smokehouse. The food was okay - nothing special. We tried the Beef Ribs and the Fried Chicken with Waffle."}
{"text":"I have 2 picky children who never agree on where they want to go for lunch. But while visiting Montreal my cousin suggested this place and we thought we would check it out. We were not disappointed.  Poutine is a 'must have' whenever we visit and this place has a pulled chicken and pulled pork 
poutine we thought was delish. 
And, for all the mommies who care, the bathrooms were super clean."}
{"text":"Best ribs ever! I like ribs but it usualy not the first meal I will try in a restaurant because I've had bad experience, but just with the smell from the parking lot I knew what i was having. My girlfriend and I share a the fried onion(10$) and the full plate of ribs (30$) with the fries and mac'n cheese replacement (extra 3$).

And that was more food than we could eat. The onion is probably best to share with at least 4 people but it was soooo good. Perfectly season and battered and delightfully crispy.  
The ribs were just melting off the bones and had that perfectly caramelized edge. 
Mac'n cheese was good. But next to such grandiose food I expected a little more, but perhaps my palate was already saturated. 
And the fries were real potato fries, but we left most of the them on the plate because you know priorities! 

And thanks to the yelp coupon I got a free molson beer which they gave me a glass from the tap instead of a bottle but it was fine by me."}
{"text":"Cannot take-out certain item on the menu... Absolutely ridiculous. I'd rather eat elsewhere than be forced to eat in their empty restaurant."}
{"text":"90% de mon travail se fait au États Unis. Je mentionne ça d'emblée seulement pour ajouter à la crédibilité de ma revue parce que ce resto se voulant être du genre BBQ américain. 

Je crois sincèrement que l'effort est réussi. La bouffe est authentique et Rubs ont eus la bonne idée d'associer certains de leur plats aux états dans lesquels on peut typiquement les retrouver. 

Mon seul point moins positif est que ce qui n'est pas du tout américain dans tout le concept est au niveau du service. L'attente interminable et l'entregent frigide des serveurs sont quelque chose dont on ne vit pas au États Unis en général. Ça vaut tu une étoile de moins? Non, je crois que ça serait injuste car on peut comparer la bouffe mais pas la culture. Si on veut vraiment vivre la totale, faut aller au \"deep south\" en personne. Pour un resto à Laval, c'est vraiment bien?"}
{"text":"I took my parents here for father's day.  The portions were huge, too big i must say, but the meat was tasty.  I had the smoked brisket and it was very close to the BBQ that I had in Dallas.  Overall, I and family enjoyed this place, we were all too fullnat the end and had plenty for doggy bag."}
{"text":"Nous avons pris la grosse assiette 1/2 poulet ,brisquet , la cote levée, le porc effiloché et 4 accompagnement pour 80$ ben je vous le dit ça vaut la peine ! Délicieux"}
{"text":"When I heard Fumoir Rubs was opening near to my house, I practically fell off my chair. Who can blame me, right? A southern, Americana BBQ styled menu in Laval? I can count those who offer this in Laval with the fingers of my hand.

So off to the review, after 2 visits, had to make sure, see? *squints eyes*

First visit was during a weekday lunch with a friend, no line-up at noon, got a \"banquet\" in a quiet corner and ordered the pulled pork burger, with side fries and 'apple' coleslaw. The burger was HUGE and more importantly, AMAZING. I've had pulled pork countless times in my life but this was probably the best pulled pork burger I've eaten in awhile, if not ever. Did I mention it was HUGE? I could barely pick the beast up and take it out of its fat misery.

The side fries were a bit disappointing and the 'apple' coleslaw didn't really taste like either apple nor coleslaw. It wasn't terrible but not for me. Either way, after the burger, I didn't have any more space.

The price tag was reasonable and the service very efficient. I got my meal within 10 minutes and my drink in 2 minutes. All in all a perfect 5 star experience.

The next visit was a few mere days later with wife and friends on a Saturday night. As I bought my infant with me, our visit was in mid-afternoon, before the possible Saturday night rush. We were placed in the back with similar families and children, a smart and efficient way the staff took care of business to segregate guests accordingly. As a new parent, the last thing I want to do is annoy other patrons and with similar patrons all on the same side of the restoraunt, the other patrons without children can be left in peace.

This time I went with the St-Louis ribs, my friend went with the Beef ribs and we decided to share them. The food arrived after 25 minutes and I got lucky enough to have the same waiter who provided once again more than adequate service. He was obviously rushed but he took care of us and got tipped handsomely (I hope he felt that way) for his efforts.

As a rib man, I like many types of ribs and know my ribs and the St-Louis ribs looked impressive when they arrived but someway, somehow, I felt neutral about them. Maybe it was the sauce or the fatty cut about them, I didn't particularly care for it. The Beef ribs were slightly better but still not my cup of tea.

This time I went with the side sweet potato fries ($2 surcharge) and the standard coleslaw. The sweet potato fries were exceptional and loved them. The coleslaw wasn't for me.

We ordered dessert (cheesecake) and a cappuccino and they were both very good. I hope they try to expand the selection of desserts in the future by 1-2.

My wife was disappointed the mac-n-cheese burger wasn't available and went with the normal burger which she found decent but nothing to write home about.

All in all, a good experience.

Will be back."}
{"text":"I have been to this location many times and I enjoy it. Probably some of the best American BBQ in the GMA. The service is usually about average and food is always good. 

Menu items I liked: burger, pork ribs, brisket, mac n cheese, salmon, pulled pork sandwich, pulled chicken sandwich. 

Don't bother with the blooming onion. Desserts are just ok. 

Tried the delivery service tonight. Food was packed extremely well in elegant cardboard boxes and was warm and fresh. The delivery driver was polite and arrived faster than I expected for a Saturday night at supper time. 

I find that eating here is over-priced. I ordered the basic burger plate with no frills and an appetizer of pulled pork rolls, and my bill was $35 including tip for the driver. That's why this restaurant will remain a luxury for me."}
{"text":"Have eaten here 3 times now and it's been a hit and miss each time. First time was lunch with kids. We had lunch special ribs and pulled pork sandwiches. Ribs were tender and flavourfull, porc sandwich in brioche type bun was amazing. Fries were soggy and burnt as if they weren't blanched. Second occasion was for catering. We felt portion sizes didn't justify the $90 price tag. Brisket and porc were amazing, so was the chicken but the ribs were like rubber, no one touched them. We had to slow cook them at home for another 2 hours. Third time was for supper. All of our meals were great. We had the fried chicken for $17. You basically are served 1 piece of chicken, one drumstick and a wing on a Belgian waffle for $17. Fries seemed refried and weren't touched. Porc sandwich was now served on a focacia type bun. Side of beans consisted of red kidney beans in an inedible amount of sugar either from syrup or molasses. Service was quick. No other place matches authentic BBQ in town like Rubs, some minor tweaks would make this place spectacular."}
{"text":"Restaurant excellent ,la nourriture excellente, le décor , les serveurs, la musique on ce sens comme au Texas je le recommande à tous , et les portions son généreuse!!"}
{"text":"The ma n cheese was INSANE! It's a smoky one and honestly I think it beats any mac n cheese I ever ate."}
{"text":"One of the best american BBQ restaurant! Quick and nice service. Took a Texas RUBS platter for 2 (50$) and we were full! The beef brisket and the ribs are very tender. Would go back another time!"}
{"text":"Excellent home made BBQ and tall 22oz beers with a decent tap selection!

I had the pulled pork and ribs plate. The ribs were a bit dry but still fall off the bones good, the pulled pork was flat out amazing. There were pieces of chared meat mixed in, that were to die for. 

Don't miss out on this gem!"}
{"text":"My 2 friends and I stopped by on our way to the airport.   Service was prompt and efficient.  Between the 3 of us, we had chicken and waffles, chicken wings, half a rack of pork ribs and a prime rib sandwich.  The food was better than I expected!  The batter in the chicken was light, crunchy and had a nice subtle flavour.  The prime rib was juicy and flavourful and the ribs were pretty decent.  I'd come back if I was ever in the area."}
{"text":"Tried Rubs for the second time and it was better than the first visit. The last time we shared the big mix platter, but this time we all choose something different. My wife had the combo dish and the smoked chicken was the real deal. Not only perfectly smoked but ever so succulent! My daughter pf course here  favourite, which is ribs, equally good. My son had the fried chicken very moist but there was missing a certain punch in the batter, but over all very good. I had a special which they don't offer very often on the regular menu, and that was the Kobe beef burger. Well let me tell you not only is it presented in a dome dish with a smoke show, what was the kicker is the thick slab of back bacon and the arugula inside. The beef cooked perfectly to medium rare and the taste of smoke in every bit. Yum yum!!!!the dishes are huge the food is great and service was good. Definitely a keeper."}
{"text":"Finalement de la bouffe sud américaine à Laval. Merci!

L'amuse-gueule de bacon est très gouteuse, parfaitement épicé et délicieuse avec un cocktail ou un bonne bière. Avec modération car à la longue çà peut être rebutant. Une bonne variété de cocktail à ne pas manquer. 

Attention, plats pour grand mangeurs! Les burgers sont succulent et juteux, leurs accompagnements parfaits. Mon plat favori le chicken and waffles OF COURSE!!!  Malheureusement, dû aux quantités gargantuesque, je n'ai pas encore eu la chance d'essayer le fameux sundae avec le bacon trempé dans le chocolat... Un jour... Peut-être....

Dû à notre paresse et comme le resto est à quelques pas de la maison, nous avons fait l'erreur de prendre des poutines pour apporter. L'attente de la commande était longue et arrivé à la maison le tout était plus qu'ordinaire, mais je ne les blâme pas, we should have known better."}
{"text":"Decent first experience!  Solid 3.5 stars. Service was ridiculously good at the bar and my friends and I were catered to all night long. The food was good, however my plate was simply ok. We all had a pulled-something sandwich. I had pulled chicken, and my friends had a pulled primerib and pulled pork. Out of the three, mine was definitely the least flavourful. 

Despite my plate, I will definitely be returning to try some other stuff on the menu. I mean, who else does a Mac and cheese burger bun? Yup, I love gimmicks.

This place is worth checking out."}
{"text":"I've wanted to try Le Fumoir Rubs for quite some time while noticing that American style BBQ is getting more popular here in Montreal!

We booked the place for 20 people for a group function and were given the option of a more private area so we gladly chose this!  It was nice, not too loud and comfortable for us to stretch out to two tables!  

Onto the food.  We ordered the pulled pork nachos as a started and Chicken wings as well!  The PP Nachos were amazing!  The chicken wings were good with a nice smoked flavour but were complete wing tipped versions!  Not the best I've eaten in my life but definitely very good!  

For the main meal we ordered the Texas platter.  It came with 4 sides which we chose (mac N cheese, sweet potato fries, apple coleslaw, beans).  Only complaint is the serving portion was a bit smaller for the sides that only allowed for a small amount per person (we were 5).  Onto the meat, there was a very large portion of beef brisket, pork ribs, chicken & pulled pork.  It was seriously so damm good!  Barney Rubble and Fred Flinstone would be in heaven or any other meat loving carnivore!  

To wash it down I had the Key lime pie.  Not as good as in Florida but passable for Quebec!  

All in all everyone seem satisfied although we probably had to all undo the belt buckle a notch or two!  

Having a bunch of beer it was around $50 per person (tax & tip) which is very reasonable!"}
{"text":"Et oui je le redis cest un super de souper tu aimes les côtes levées le poulet les brisquets mais il faut absolument essayé le bluming oignions avec une trempette Mayo shipotlé je pourrais écrire plus mais je vous laisse le choix vous pouvez pas vous trompez le serveur pascal je vous le recommande je dois dire que les serveurs sont souriant ici et le patron viens te voir j aime et je partage cette place avec vous ...."}
{"text":"I can't say it was anywhere near the best BBQ I've ever had but definitely not the worst.  Portions are enormous however prices are high too.  It's a sports bar atmosphere, casual and relaxed.  They need to figure out how to brew REAL sweet tea and not serve the fountain variety - ick!  Overall a decent experience and a good attempt in a non-traditional BBQ market."}
{"text":"La nourriture malade j'ai  jamais manger du bbq comme ça  ...tout étais  bon ...les côte lever qui fond dans la bouche...le porc effiloché tendre et savoureux. ..les bine fumer et délicieuse. ...le poulet frit tendre et juteux. ..tout ça  pour dire que c'est   vraiment une belle expérience. ..je vais revenir ici"}
{"text":"Rubs is the best smokehouse in Montreal.

The ribs are incredible, as is the pulled pork. Don't go to rubs unless you're bringing your appetite. It's a got a great smokehouse vibe and awesome drinks.

I've been here multiple times and I just recently tried the Fried Chicken and Waffles, it was awesome. 

The mac and cheese is also great!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at this location thanks to one of my friend who suggest me to go. Just recall this was a former Scores restaurant. The ambiance is amazing with the dinner section and the bar section. A lot of people and obviously when a restaurant run really good that you know is approx 45 min wait but it's worth it. Menu really easy to read, alcohol great selection for a very good price. Order my baby half rack of ribs and I will return for some more. Didn't had the chance to eat the desert due to lack of space lol. Overall the service were amazing and I will recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"Very nice food if you like BBQ and smoky flavours,  generous portions, vast choice of dishes ( chicken , pork, salmon and beef) ; not a place for vegetarian :) service was fast, tried the smoked salmon salad and enjoyed it , dressing was little bit sweet to my taste but the salmon was very well smoked not too dry, vast choices of alcohol drinks (rather short on the beer list but good choices of whisky) . One of my kids did not like the Mac N Cheese (she is not into smokey smokey flavours and rather classic in her choices) however my little one really enjoyed the chicken sandwich along with the fries and coleslaw. Prices are on the high side for this kind of food and you can easily spend 40-50$ per person if you take a main dish and appetizer not to add 5-10$ per alcoholic drink. All this said i recommend it for meat and BBQ lovers."}
{"text":"My son and I came to Montreal to attend the 50th Running of the Canadian Grand Prix. We stayed at the St. Martin in Laval. On our first day (Friday), I let my son decide where he wanted to eat, and he decided on Rubs. I looked at him and said, \"Why do you want to try Southern BBQ in Quebec, Canada?\" He said to me, \"You said I could pick.....\" I said \"ok, ok\" so we went, me thinking this is not going to be good. When we arrived at Rubs, while perusing the menu we ordered the Smoked Jalapeno Poppers--one bite and I was in love!  For the main course I had the St. Louis Ribs--again I was floored, these are the very best ribs I have ever tasted!  My son ordered the Dixie Blue Burger, and I saw the look on his face after his first bite:  he was in heaven!  We stayed in Laval for 3 nights, and ate at Rubs all 3 nights. These folks from the North should open up in the USA to teach Americans how to cook their own food!  Besides the food being fantastic, the serving staff was truely professional, caring, and made us feel very welcomed. My hat is off to this awesome establishment. I shall return!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent quality meat cuts, they sure know how to BBQ. Price is very good, shoutout to the Sunday ribs deal and the beer buckets.  Everything is fresh and you can taste it.  Go hungry and with a designated driver."}
{"text":"This hits a very specific dining target. There are plenty of BBQ places but the smokehouse experience is rare and they nail it. Start off with the bacon cubes for free and then pick your pleasure. Pulled pork is flavourful without being too salty. The fries are great and not just run of the mill. Very creative and diverse drink menu. Honestly, it is just a unique experience."}
{"text":"Yummy Texas/American style BBQ!  Very good beef ribs!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this BBQ resto , lively ambience , lots of seating , friendly staff and great prices ! the pulled pork sandwich was delicious - definitely going back to try more of their dishes !"}
{"text":"Il est rare que je mange dans ce genre d'endroit mais j'ai succombé. Le menu est idéal pour le \"meat lover\" en moi! La spécialité est évidemment les côtes levées. ÉNORME! L'assiette déborde de viande! De plus on nous propose des frites ou de la salade de chou. Il y plusieurs écrans pour regarder des matchs lors des compétitions. Le décor avec ses cornes accroché sur le murs donne une ambiance très américaine. Un conseil si vous choisissez un de leurs burger: il sont tous mi-cuit."}
{"text":"If you love meat, this is the place to go. Their seasoning is perfectly balances with the smoked flavors. The portions are more than you'll need to satisfy your hunger"}
{"text":"A new love is born!

This is an update to my first review of their other location http://www.yelp.ca/biz/le-fumoir-rubs-montr%C3%A9al#hrid:l01Z-P8OwPMOy08cM6bADg

This restaurant opening is the most exciting thing that's happened in 2014 as of yet! I'm a HUGE fan of Rubs' smoky deliciousness that-stays-on-your-fingers-for-days and used to go to their Prince Arthur location on an almost weekly basis, since they closed down temporarily, I'm so glad I got a fix elsewhere. 
This Laval location is beautiful, much roomier than their first restaurant, lots of banquets and a big bar that could accommodate a good dozen people. Also, plenty of parking!

I went on Feb 1, opening day, despite some computer glitches and slow orders, the food is as good, if not better than what I remember a year ago. We came back the following evening where Superbowl Sunday proved to be much quieter and found more things to like from their menu. Prices have gone up a little bit, you now have to pay 1.95$ extra for premium sides like mac and cheese, grilled veggies and sweet potatoes when they used to be included at no additional charge. They are so worth it though, you cannot come here and not get their smoked mac and cheese!! 
They finally have a drinks menu and have added a couple new food items. Initially we wanted to order the prime rib but it wasn't available unless you wanted it sliced in a sandwich. I would suggest calling in advance if you really want it because they only have it on weekends, first come first serve. My dining companion can be picky but he absolutely adored the beef ribs he \"settled\" for and has been fantasizing about them since. 
The salmon may be overlooked as it doesn't seem like a popular item to get at an american bbq place, but I assure you, the buttery, smoky tenderness of it WILL satisfy. Pretty much everything is worth a try, my mouth is watering as I type this...

It's rare that I get to interact with people behind the scenes, I love that one of the owners (shout out to Mike!) is very hands on and present at the location. He always comes by to check up on customers and if there's any issue, he is willing and able to please. Whoever runs their Facebook page also does a great job of being responsive to fans. I'm loving this business, spreading the word and wishing them all the best to thrive!!"}
{"text":"I've been passing by this place for months and finally stopped in to get the skinny, so here it is.  

The staff are super friendly and most all speak great English which is perfect for a yankee like me. It was pretty busy so I opted for a seat at the bar which meant no waiting.  Nice.  

The server came over almost immediately and recommend a beer after some questions and it was a nice selection.  I wasn't sure what to pick so I went with a combo platter and it was a lot more food than expected.  Oops. Lol.  

The rib meat pulled off the bone and was juicy and flavorful.   My only compliant was maybe my own issue in that I kept getting bone from the ends in my mouth.  I'm used to eating baby backs and I guess they don't have as much bone/cartilage at the ends.  

The chicken was not just a breast but a
1/4 chicken.  It had great flavor but it was just a little dryer than I like.  It was still good enough to devour though.  

I finished with a death by chocolate dessert.  Yummy!   

This is the best BBQ in Quebec so far.  

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"C'est un resto que j'avais bcp d'attente,un peu déçu 5.5/10.lambiance correct pour un resto de ce concept.La bouffe ouf.La brisket n'avais aucun goût de fumé, la Côte levée de porc bonne."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst American BBQ i have ever tasted . My boyfriend and I went there a Friday around 6 pm . We sat on the Large Terrasse as It was perfect wheather outside . 

We ordered their speciality platers to share : The dish included , BBQ Ribs, Pulled Pork and Beef brasquet served with fries and salad .
We also ordered 2 drinks , a cocktail and blond beer . 

The only eatable thing on this platter was the salad and ribs 

The meal arrived cold and untasteful .
No seasonning , No flavour , Overcooked meat 
Overall description : hard and cold meat ! 

The cocktail tasted like cheap minute maid juice with vodka . 

Bill was about 75 $ plus tip . I regret every penny spent !!!! 
I should have gone somewhere else ."}
{"text":"Great food,  large portions, great ambiance, ice cold beer. Definitely not for vegetarians! Lol.  Oh....and the fried bacon bits are great with the beer!
Ordered the pull pork tacos with beans and coleslaw...they were great!  Coleslaw was cool and crisp, beans were perfectly cooked and the taco shells were nice and crispy.  And of course the pulled pork was super tender!"}
{"text":"Les viandes sont succulentes, une très belle découverte pour une soirée sans chichi avec de bons amis. L'accueil est chaleureux et le gérant passionné par son fumoir, il faut dire que ce dernier est particulièrement impressionnant! 

Les côtes de buf sont tout simplement incroyables... 

J'y retourne bientôt, c'est sûr!"}
{"text":"I was not very impressed with the food. For a smokehouse it failed in my opinion. Overpriced and the sauce was not what I would expect from a smokehouse. Although, the people I was with enjoyed it so I guess it comes down to your taste."}
{"text":"I'm usually picky when it comes to my food but this place is so good and the man that was serving us was amaZing ... definitely coming back"}
{"text":"American BBQ in all it's glory. We tried a few things and all was very good. Even the sides are great. No other place compares to them in Montreal/Laval in terms of BBQ. 
Staff is nice and friendly... And effective! Owner is also very friendly. Great for family outings or even for groups."}
{"text":"Food was ok, nothing too exceptional and doesn't compare to the smoke houses I've tried in the US. 
Their brisket was pretty bad, it was dry and chewy. 
Ribs were ok, but were lacking sauce. 
Chicken was very good, really moist. 
The blooming onion was ok, but much oilier than the ones I've had at Outback, for example. The plate was dripping with oil when we finished eating the onion, which shows poor execution when frying the onion. 
Waitresses were young, pretty, but really airheaded. I suppose they were selected for their looks more so than for their experience or ability to exchange with their clients. 
Overall it was not impressive at all, and considering that this food counts as a debauchery, I would have expected to leave much more satisfied."}
{"text":"This IS the place for a real BBQ experience. The ribs and all different red meats taste sooooo good. Make sure to ask for an extra BBQ sauce. They have good portions, so half size meal should be plenty for an average Joe.

Fried chicken is fair, similar to PFK from my point of view. The fried onion as an appetizer is a must! But do share, because otherwise you won't appreciate your perfect cooked BBQ meal!

You'll get a free beer if you used the Yelp coupon (still working in August 2017)."}
{"text":"It's a nice place with friendly staff, but I find that it's too expensive for what you get. The food is o.k. but prices are too high.
My son and his buddies love the place, I guess if you're 20something you will love it."}
{"text":"The ribs were excellent. The brisket was dry and burnt.  The beans were so salty I couldn't eat more than a mouthful for every gallon of water. The spicy fries were crispy and seasoned just right. So I'll give an overall score of 3"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good but very overpriced. I go down south pretty often can eat much better for much cheaper so this is why avoid most smoke houses in montreal. Theyre all overpriced not just rubs. Rubs is pretty good but again very pricy for this type of food...."}
{"text":"Finally a good ole American BBQ in Quebec. It seems these people have got it right. Ordered the Onion flower or what ever they call it and it was to die for. Best ever in Quebec. Then came my beef ribs. At first I noticed that there was only 2 but I also did not notice the size of these ribs....holy shit I rolled outta this place. Finger licking good. I will be back."}
{"text":"La Poutine au porc effiloché est malade ! Les Ribs sont sportifs pour les amateurs du CH."}
{"text":"The Porobello Burger was amazing! The coleslaw was really tasty and the sweet pickle tasted like kool-aid :)"}
{"text":"Super place le service super un peux cher mais on a visite le fumoir a viande apres le souper avec le boss"}
{"text":"cuisine américaine typique. Tout goûte pareil, pas bon, très très gras. On à tous eu mal au ventre dans la soirée et personne à prix là même chose. En plus, C'était même pas intéressant. Des hamburger saignant? Non merci. On m'a dit que c'était normal et fait ainsi..."}
{"text":"If you ever have a craving for American comfort food this is the place. Ribs are fall off the bone and brisket and chicken are very tasty."}
