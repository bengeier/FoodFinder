{"text":"To be honest, I did not know what to expect for my lunch at Shiraz. I chose them based on the fact that they use OpenTable for reservations (major props to them for that) and that they serve Halal (double major props) so I booked a table for two on a Sunday afternoon (though they weren't that busy when we walked in so the reservation wasn't really that necessary).  After we walked in the door, we were greeted kindly, and guided to the dining area to be seated which had an elegant yet comfortable feel to it and I remember thinking to myself \"hey, this could be pretty good\" - and so the expectations were set.   The rest of the meal went on to be more than just that: the food was excellent, the service was great, the bill definitely reasonable, and we left the place thinking \"hey, that was freaking amazing!\".   Shiraz Persian Cuisine does so many things well, and you can see it in the details: small things like meticulous plating, being asked consistently throughout the meal how you're finding each course/item. And then there's things like asking questions about the food (because if you aren't Persian and it is your first time, you WILL have questions - but that's a good thing) and getting an actual answer that doesnt leave you more confused than you were at the start, and makes you feel confident about your choice, that's a big deal and quality service.    We ordered the Kashk-e-bademjan (Roasted Eggplant) which was simply incredible. It's honestly of one of the most delicious items I've ever tasted, the layers of flavour and the textures - you just have to try it and you will understand. Next, I ordered the Spicy Vaziri dish and my wife ordered the Beef Stew. The Vaziri was 10/10 - delicious, the most flavourful and moist chicken and kebab combo I can remember (and I'm Desi, curries are what we do!). We were advised the particular Beef Stew we ordered was a traditional Persian taste, and it was good just not what my wife was expecting (it's a Stew that comes with rice and they are to be eaten together, and it could have used a little more beef in it). Finally, after both deciding were too full to go any further, we were asked if we would like dessert and were told they have in-house prepared Rose Water and Cardamom Ice Cream, after finding that out we decided we have to at least try a bowl and so we split one. The Rosewater was more prominent for us and it was divine. Pretty incredible meal overall if you remember I walked in not knowing what to expect.  We were told that it's a family-run operation with the Waitress's father in the back preparing the dishes and that made me smile. Everything comes from a point of passion and you can taste it through the food and feel it through the service and conversation. Shiraz Persian Cuisine had me feeling inspired. One day I'd like to open a restaurant and serve the quality experience they provide. I can't give any higher praise than that."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to Shiraz in over two years, but was excited to take my out-of-town, gluten intolerant sister there for dinner. What a disappointment!   A plate of about 1 cup of plain rice with a little saffron for colour and a small bowl of fesenjaan with 4 small bite-sized pieces of chicken and the rest sauce is NOT worth $20. We had to order an $8 salad separately which was another small bowl of diced tomato, onion, cucumber that I could have whipped up in under 2 minutes. This boring little side salad should have been included with the meal. (The eggplant dip was good.)  The two stars are for the service; our waitress was lovely. I would address this with the owners but there is no email address on their site."}
{"text":"I saw this restaurant at taste of Calgary in 2013 but never tried their food until a couple weeks ago. I ordered the ground chicken kabob and my fiancé ordered ground chicken pizza. They were both delicious! We booked online and were seated in a secluded area, which was kinda of nice.  Also, the service was great. Our waiter was fun and so nice."}
{"text":"Great Persian food and a great price. Would recommend definitely. Will be coming back next time when in town."}
{"text":"Shiraz is great because of the food,which, if you're arent familiar is similar to most Middle eastern fare. Very fresh, and has both meat and veggie options. We were warmly welcomed by the owner, and when we were served our food, the daughter of the owner made sure we understood everything we saw on our plate, and how its traditionally eaten.   We started with the Platter, which had various starters on it. It was a huge portion, and had us half filled up before our main. We shared the #3 special, which had a combo of lamb and chicken skewers. It came with rice and veggies. Soooo good. The meat was tender, and the rice was ever so slightly greasy..which I love.  We were too full to try dessert, but this gives me an excuse to return, hopefully soon."}
{"text":"Pros: The food can be a bit expensive, but for the quality of Persian food, it is better than Atlas and definitely TeaSpooon. I would always recommended for the first timer, the chicken kabob plate or the lamb shank are good options. Never skip on an appetizer of kashk-e bademjan if you want to try something new (it's a dip made of eggplant).   Cons: everything here is a bit pricey for what it is, but if you don't want to cook and are looking for Persian food, you honestly don't have a lot of options anyway."}
{"text":"After purchasing a LivingSocial deal last year for Shiraz, my boyfriend and I (finally) decided to have dinner there last week.  We called for reservations and they were able to take us the day we called, and bonus, parking in the back!  The decor was warm and inviting, and the service was great!  The owner was so enthusiastic and welcoming, and more than willing to help us out with the menu.  He was delighted to find out that it was my first time, and even more delighted to find out that it wasn't my boyfriend's first time.  My boyfriend had the Kabob-e-Koobideh, and ordered extra grilled tomatoes on the side (definitely order those!) and I had the lamb shank.  The lamb shank was fall-off-the-bone tender, and the sauce and rice flavourful and delicious.  The Koobideh was beautifully spiced, and the combination of meat, rice, onion and tomato was perfect together.  With our LivingSocial deal, the price was definitely right, but we are more than willing to go back and pay full price.  With the platters, we think that this would be a great place to go with a group and share the wonderful experience of Persian food.  The whole experience was really fantastic and Shiraz is definitely a place that we will visit again.  Go check it out!"}
{"text":"Four stars for uniqueness of the cuisine and good execution. The menu consists of a number of appetizers, stews, and kabobs, plus a few rotating specials like Persian pizza (which they invented) and well priced chicken combo lunches. The ample warm eggplant appetizer was very tasty, as well as the stews. If you haven't had Persian food, it focuses on sweet (e.g. pomegranate), sour (which you supplement with sumac from a table shaker), and savory (e.g. whey) flavors with lots of nut oils (e.g. walnut) and little spice. It's a nice, different cuisine to introduce people to that don't venture far from meat and potatoes. My only major complaint was the somewhat under sizing of the stews. The decor won't win any awards, but our servers are usually quite enthusiastic and attentive. The unsweetened homemade saffron ice cream paired with baklava was a great, unique way to finish the meal. We'll probably be back."}
{"text":"Because Persian food is on my favorite list I decided to try this place out even though it was kind of far from home. I'm glad I did though!   The restaurant itself is a bit dated but the food allows you to look past that. I tried the pizza which is a first at any Persian place I've been to. And wow! It's absolutely the best tasting pizza I've had. The ingredients were so different from the typical pizza that it felt like I was having some other dish.  Recommend everyone to try the pizza here!"}
{"text":"Heading north on Centre Street from downtown, you may have noticed some new signage next to the tiny building on the corner of 11 Ave NE.  They have transformed this outdated and now defunct Asian restaurant into an oasis of food, wine and conversation.  If you like great food, stellar customer service in a warm friendly modern  environment you must take in the splendour of this Casbah of delectable delights.  They specialize in 100 % authentic Persian food - there specialties are Salads, Stews, and Kebabs  You won't be disappointed ...and for all you social media and tech geeks they have free Wi-FI"}
{"text":"Overpriced.  Service was average and did not feel the dining experience matched the amount of money spent on food. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"This place was a real find. The food was very tasty and a nice change from the plastic food that seems to be a mainstay in so many Calgary restaurants. Each dish was well thought out and executed with great flavour. It wasn't fussy yet it had a nice sophistication to it. The service was wonderful-our hostess guided us through the menu and made really good recommendations to ensure we had the best dining experience. This  was great because most people in our party hadn't had much experience with Persian cuisine.  I felt a bit like I was sitting down at her family's dinner table rather than sitting in a restaurant. I really enjoyed our evening there and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for authentic food made with care and served with equal attention to detail. The prices we very reasonable and overall the experience was memorable.  I look forward to going back to try other things!."}
{"text":"The food was awesome. Very authentic Persian Cuisine. The eggplant appetizer was superb.  The other foods are good fantastic too. But don't know the names.  Service was 5 star as well. Owner came out to see how we like the food. It's shows they care about you. Worth trying if you like middle eastern Persian type of food."}
{"text":"This little restaurant is becoming one of our favourites for casual dining after work, and as it is on our daily commute on Centre Street, it is becoming increasingly difficult to ignore it on our way home. After only two visits, my wife and I are hooked. First, the welcome by the owner and his wife (I presume she is) is always pleasant and makes us feel right at home. The decor is nice and not tacky, and the ambiance is usually pretty relax even when the place is full. Service is great, pleasant, quick, and always attentive. Then the food. My wife and I typically order a couple of appetizers and share one entree and it is sufficient for us. If you have a big appetite, one entry each would be better, but you may not have room left for dessert. On our first visit, we had the Hummus (garbanzo beans, tahini sauce, olive oil, garlic and lemon juice) which was a little different but lighter than what we are used to in other middle-eastern eateries..The hot Kashk-e-bademjan Roasted eggplant mixed with kashk with sautéed garlic, onions & mint is superb and complemented very well the hummus. When our Khoreshteh Fesenjaan (Pomegranate Stew) came, we were almost full but this stew is delectable. Prepared with chicken, onions, walnuts, and pomegranate juice, it is served with saffron steamed basmati rice, it is particularly surprising to someone new to Persian food, and really succulent, especially with the sumac seasoning! I recommend it. Other stews worth of mention which we had on subsequent visits are the Ghormeh sabzy (Persian green herb stew) and Khoreshteh bademjan (Eggplant stew), also served with saffron rice, but I honestly cannot wait to go full circle and have the pomegrate stew once more. There is also an okra stew on the menu and even if I am not a fan of okra because of its slimy nature, I might try it on my next visit. I've heard a lot of good things about the saffron ice cream but haven't had it, as we are usually full even if we share an entree for two. But it's on my list. Overall, this is a nice family restaurant with reasonable prices that I warmly recommend for its food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Very good food, service and atmosphere!  So much flavour and very unique Calgary food experience! Awesome owner / chef / server who is excited to share Persian cuisine. First time, but definitely not last."}
{"text":"Some friends of mine recommended this place, so the first chance my wife and I had, we visited this restaurant.  We started with the Dolmeh and Hummus for appetizers. The Dolmeh was _perfect_ and so delicious. We nearly fought over the last one. Hummus was spot on delicious, and when the server came to remove our dishes before the main course, we grabbed the leftover hummus and moved it away from her clutches. We wanted every last scrape from the plate!  Then came the \"Shiraz Special & Shirazi Salad\" for two. We ordered it because this was our first time (definitely not the last!) at this restaurant, and we wanted to sample a variety of meats. Well ... this was the right choice! The lamb was as succulent, juicy, flavourful, and delectable as any lamb we had ever tried. Beef was fantastic, the chicken was amazing--especially with the hot sauce they offered (and I accepted). Their salads, yes, just a simple tomato-cucumber salad, was so good that we scooped it up and ate it all.  There was absolutely no flaw with our food at all. So good, and so memorable!  Service was exemplary, with attentive and polite helpful servers. Great response, and oh so friendly!  I recommend this place entirely. We'll be back to try more of their amazing food ... they have a large pizza menu we need to explore next. See you there!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  The owner is fantastic, food is amazing. I love the Kashek Bedenjan and koobideh !  Great option in this part of town.   Probably best Persian food in town."}
{"text":"Not the best value for money, the competitors offer more food, better quality for a cheaper price. Still kabob though"}
{"text":"Shiraz is a location I have often driven past but never remember about when thinking of where to have dinner. Shame on me and lesson learned! Went with a group of friends and glad we did as there were so many tasty dishes to try we ended up sharing everything.  Went for Yelp International Supper Club and were privileged to have Mehdi, the owner, chat with and gave us some great advise for choosing the dishes we ended up having. So glad he did as it was a taste sensation!   Note that even though we went for Yelp International Super Club, all the dishes we tried are standard on their menu.   Loved that he took the time to check the table for any allergies to nuts or gluten before bringing anything out. We had one vegetarian in the group and he let her know he would do a separate dish for her - veggie pizza - and when it came out he made sure to let her know exactly what was on the pizza. That is caring for your guests. He also let us know they have 3 separate stations when preparing their pizza and one is dedicated to celiac so they can make sure that nothing contaminates the food. Kitchens are always so careful about allergies but this is going the extra mile to make sure no cross contamination happens. 5 stars just on that.  Started with delightful eggplant dip and Kashik-e-bademjon (eggplant) pizza. The dip was fantastic and the pizza had the best crunchy crust. The boy isn't into eggplant at all and le enjoyed the dip and loved the pizza.  Mains were a Shiraz Special platter made up of lamb, ground beef kabob and chicken kabob with basmati rice - all deliciously flavoured and cooked to perfection with the lamb nice and tender. We also got to try 2 Persian stews. A beef + bean stew (Ghormeh Sabzy or Persian Green Herb Stew) and chicken pomegranate walnut stew (Fesenjoon stew) - both great but the chicken pomegranate stew made me want to lick the bowl clean it was so tasty. The portion sizes were great too, was so full at this stage I though there was no room for dessert. I was wrong.   For dessert we had rose water + cashew ice-cream. Just wow! Creamy and sweet but not too much. The boy actually did lick his bowl clean on this one... then licked my bowl clean. Think he liked it.  Throughout Mehdi told us about the persian cuisine, where they source their ingredients from, how it is prepared, and how they got started at their restaurant. Love that we got to hear all about what we were eating and made me appreciate it that much more.  I loved the food so much and we will definitely be back with another group to try as many other dishes as our stomachs can handle. Alternatively I have a couple of friends who live close by and when I am over at their place I am absolutely suggesting we get some pizza to go from Shiraz!"}
{"text":"10 of us went to this restaurant and were greeted by Elaina.  She single handedly was the hostees and the waitress.  The food was very good.  The service was excellent.  Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant after looking at yelp for a restaurant in Calgary not too far from the airport. The service was friendly and fast. The food was good. My girlfriend and the beef kabob and chicken kabob plate and I had their special pizza with chicken, beef kabob and lamb. It was really good. The addition of the bbq sauce on the pizza gave it an inreresting taste. I took the medium pizza but it was bigger than I was expecting. I only ate half of it. Prices are a bit high but I find that they are ok for the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Two words: Persian Pizza. I don't really know a thing about Persian food, but I do know that when you make it into a pizza the result is incredibly delicious.   You know the tasty little scoops you make with Indian food, taking the naan, adding saffron rice and whatever meat chunks and curry you ordered, then pop the whole thing in your mouth? Well it's kind of like that, except then covered in melted cheese.  I was stoked on the Yelp reviews and wanted delivery so I perused the online menu. Although not on their menu, I came across this description of their own original creation: The Persian Pizza - \" ...it's the only non-traditional Persian dish on the menu. The Italian dish gets a Middle Eastern makeover, with 14 types featuring a cheese base, saffron rice and various sauces on a thin, crispy flatbread crust.  What are the 14 types? No idea, but I had to call and find out more. Listen up friends, this information hasn't been available anywhere on the internet... Until now!  Of the supposed 14 types, their most creative and most popular ones are the Hawaiian - not your typical Hawaiian, this pizza is made using a house-made pineapple sauce instead of pizza sauce and their chicken instead of ham.  The one I ordered is the Chicken Barg. Flatbread with a saffron rice sauce, chicken, cheese and then topped with these tangy, sweet cranberry-esque dealies. No idea, but so tasty all the same. Savoury with tangy sweetness, filling but by no means heavy and not even a drop of grease.   Delivery is apparently cash only - Had I been smarter I would have just hung up the phone and ordered from SkipTheDishes.ca, but I drove down. It gave me a chance to check out the restaurant and confirm that it would be a really nice place to go for dinner. I can't wait to check out some of their Traditional dishes.   I don't really know a thing about Persian food, but I do know that Shiraz has inspired me to learn more."}
{"text":"The food and ambiance are just great. Try the eggplant appetizer and the sirloin or chicken or the chicken pomegranate. Just wonderful!"}
{"text":"Great dinner with friends. The food and the friendly service is incredible. If you are not sure what to order, just ask them. Don't miss the lamb chops! The pistachio ice team with rose water flavour was amazing."}
{"text":"I have been hosting meetups at Shiraz Persian Cuisine in 2015 because the environment is perfect for our meetings.  It is business related group and there is enough space that I can get a larger table, its central, the staff and the food are fantastic.    Even though everything I have had here tastes amazing, I have to give a special shout out to their hummus. Its creamy, garlic-y deliciousness has me drooling on the drive over there, anticipating it.    Also, another shout out is to their spicy-ness.  My tolerance is fairly high of spicy foods, and often when I go to restaurants and there is a regular and a spicy option, I find the spicy quite.... regular.  Not at Shiraz.  If Shiraz says spicy.  They mean spicy -- and delicious flavorful spicy.  Not hawt hawt with no substance.    Long and short of it, if you are looking for amazing Persian cuisine, Shiraz is a must!  Free parking in the back as well, which is unusual for inter-city dining.  And... if you are hosting a large group, they can accommodate."}
{"text":"The food quality is really great here. It is family-owned and the staff are really warm and friendly. It has become our usual restaurant on Tue. or Wed. nights which it has koobideh kabab promotion.  We tried traditional Persian ice cream for dessert tonight, and believe me you can not find anything like it in Calgary.  I should say that it's price is a bit high but the quality that you get is totally worth it."}
{"text":"The pita and hummus was the most bland I've ever tasted in my life.  Almost like eggplant but with no spices.  I've had better pita and hummus from a supermarket and both were way past their expirary dates.  Bazille totally blows this place away in pita and hummus, so viisit nordstroms for that bazille pita&humus.  I had the chicken and sirloin.  Both came undercooked and bloody.  The steak smelled  like it had grown legs and started to walk around in the kitchen.  The shiraz salad was bland and mostly vinegar and just cut-up vegetables.  I was so hungry I ate the bloody chicken anyways, hope I dont end up in the hospital with salmonella.  Its all about the risk, you can eat chicken tartare and sushi every day, just pray you dont end up in the hospital..  They have some kind of yogurt drink.  It tasted aweful, not like any other yogurt middle-eastern drink i've tasted.  it was very clumpy and salty.  It was made a while ago , probobly in the summer, and should be thrown out and re-made.  Yogurt has an expirary date for a reason, you just cant leave it out on a shelf for months and let it puff out and think its still good you level 5 hoarders at shiraz persian food.  The YYC pizza was interesting.  Rice/chicken/pinapple with cheese on a thin crust.  Probobly the best thing they make is something totally not persian in any way..."}
{"text":"This is the best Persian restaurant in Calgary right now. I would recommend having as many appetizers as you can, and to defiantly get the chicken. The koobideh is decent but everything else is great. Good price and service as well"}
{"text":"Excellent lunch.  Really enjoyed the feast.  sexond time here and still loved the taste."}
{"text":"I was excited to see Shiraz pop up on Just-Eat.ca which allows it to deliver now.   I brought several \"Taste of Persia\" combos and dolmeh into the office for a lunch meeting and it was a huge hit.  Ordering salads kept it from being too meat heavy for a lunch hour meal - which I find otherwise.   TofP combo holds true to \"feeds 3\" while feeding a group of meat loving guys at a lunch hour served in a free fed buffet style  - not something that's always true!  I was disappointed with Just Eat's delivery - 45 minutes late which is a terrible thing for a meeting... but they don't cater to the corporate crowd.    The food was still good (but I prefer it in restaurant personally but I'm not going to knock down the rating because of that)"}
{"text":"Very good food. A little pricey but overall good. The service was good too, wish I could eat here everyday!  I would recommend this place hands down."}
{"text":"Although I had food here a few years ago if you like Middle East food with interesting subtle spice vacation and excellent service . Go to this place warn an friendly place"}
{"text":"Excellent food at a very reasonable price.  I came here for lunch this one time and was surprised by how delicious the food was.  Of course, my Persian friend and dining mate that day had suggested it, based on stories he had about it from other Persian friends.   He ordered for us.  I'm usually a chicken-at-lunch kinda guy but since we were visiting Calgary for a day, I figured I could might as well indulge in some red meat.  We got two orders of the koobideh kabobs.  The serving of rice with these kabobs was a lot and would be sure to put me off to sleep while driving back on the QE2.    However, with the large serving of rice were two skewered pieces of ground meat, deliciously flavored and spiced.  The meat was not just succulent and fresh, but also dazzled my senses.  We had ordered a yogurt appetizer that we chose to wait with till the main arrived.  Apparently, Persians like to have this yogurt thing with their meat.  It was certainly a delicious combination!  The menu is of good size with enough variety, including grilled okra or something like that, if I'm not mistaken, for vegan/vegetarian folk.  Great stop for lunch.  Come with sufficient time on hand, since it gets crowded!"}
{"text":"Great tasting food and friendly service. A must visit. Try the walnut pomegranate stew - it was unbelievably good."}
{"text":"Great food great service great decor.  We had a platter of beef, beef and chicken.  Saffron rice. All good tastes."}
{"text":"After moving to Calgary, I thought I can add a few details to my original review,   We dined here in a group of 4. The restaurant was empty and we were the only customers.   We had the koobideh, herb stew and the barley soup. All of them were disappointing and way below average for Iranian food. However, the biggest disappointment was the service.   We were \"lucky\" enough to be served by the owner himself. He was always interrupting us and asking us random question. Then he switched to cursing and bad mouthing other Persian restaurants in town. So not professional. And finally when my friend asked for a piece of lime for the barley soup, the owner made fun of him and told him it is not going to taste good with lime!!!!!!!!! (It actually taste very good with some lime)   In conclusion, totally not recommended, there are much better options for Iranian food in Calgary."}
{"text":"After being warmly welcomed by the owner's daughter, we were in an adventurous mood, despite never having had Persian food before, On her suggestion, we tried a creamy roasted eggplant appetizer infused with garlic and served with pita wedges, oh so yummy! For mains, the Tour of Persia platter gave us a taste of the overall menu: chicken and beef with fragrant saffron Basmati rice and a beef and bean stew on the side. For dessert we ordered their signature mango pistachio ice cream made with rose water. It was delicate, subtle, and not too sweet."}
{"text":"Easy convenient corner location.    After the positive Yelp reviews here, I originally intended to try the persian food to compare back home since we also have Iranian population in North Vancouver, a burb off Vancouver but I digress.  But after speaking to the owner who was doing some pretty good PR to every table--which I'm always been a fan of, shows that they care about their food, service, etc.---he showed his awards for best pizza!  With a persian twist of course...the lamb kabob, of all things.  Even for a small pizza, came with generous toppings, in particular the huge chunks of tomatoes, not those super-diced cheap stuff you find at those fast-food chains.  thin crust was average, would've preferred some density.  Accept amex.  date worthy material, nice booth seating on the right side and some nice decor all around."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service! In from Dallas Ft Worth for a week and wanted our friends to try the kind of food I grew up on -we picked the right place! Ghormeh sabzi was great as was the fesenjan. Hospitality to the nines as well - felt right at home. Thanks for an awesome experience for our first time friends!!"}
{"text":"We went here for dinner with a friend.  They weren't busy at 6 and we were able to get a table right away.  We ordered the salt and pepper wings with pomegranate sauce on the side, eggplant, hawaiian chicken pizza and the chef special with shirazi salad.  The chef special comes with three skewers (beef tenderloin, chicken breast, and ground beef), two plates of rice, salad and grilled tomatoes.  The wings were tasty and crispy.  The eggplant was flavourful but I didn't enjoy the whey so I would probably order it without next time.  The pizza was pretty decent but I found it a little on the sweet side.  The highlight of the meal was the meat kebabs and the salad.  There wasn't anything that was memorable for my taste."}
{"text":"This is the new branch of Shiraz restaurant. The original branch is located on Centre street north.  I've eaten here once, and they are pretty new. Let's give them an OK to begin with. Will revisit this rating in in the future after they've completely settled in :-)  first experience: The service was good, but we were a big group and some of the dish arrived a bit cold. They allowed us to bring our own wine and charged 15$ corking fee per bottle. It's a nice option to have, however I find 15$ per bottle a bit steep. Good luck!"}
{"text":"I have to say in our recent visit, Shiraz really impressed us and now it's officially the best Iranian/Persian restaurant in Calgary in my books! Excellent service, really decent food quality and ambience. Good job!!"}
{"text":"Best. Pizza. Ever.  I could leave that as my review and be completely content. I won't, but I could.  I've been a fan of Shiraz since they entered in the inaugural YYC Pizza Week. Their entry that year was so well received that it has since been added to their regular menu. I even witnessed first hand Mayor Nenshi almost eat an entire one to himself. He had to fight others off to do so. Ya, it's that good.   Needless to say, on my last trip there that's exactly what I had (it's called the Shiraz Hawaiian Chicken Pizza btw). Mehdi (the owner) definitely earns his title as the Pizza King of Calgary (a moniker he's known by in Calgary pizza circles) for this creation. On top of that I ordered some pomegranate flavored wings and a dish called Cheesy Tropical chicken (basically the toppings from the pizza I order but served in a side dish). The pizza was excellent, as I expected, as was the cheezy chicken dish. The pomegranate wings were interesting. Not bad, just not a taste I'm accustomed too.   At any rate, if you're looking for top notch pizza that's a little different than the regular, I'd highly recommend Shiraz."}
{"text":"After not having eaten Persian food for a week and a half while in Canada, we were missing it. My family and I was a little skeptical eating Iranian food so far from home; but, we decided to give it a try and were pleasantly surprised.   We ordered the Mast-O-khiar, which is a yogurt and cucumber dip that was served with pita bread. It was pretty good, just needed some salt in my opinion. For the entree I ordered the Green Salad while my parents ordered the Kabob-e-Barg and Kabob-e-Koobideh. The Green Salad was super light and refreshing with the lemon juice olive oil dressing which I really loved. The Kabob-e-Barg is one of my favorite Iranian dishes and they did not disappoint. The meat was so tender and juicy. It was served with traditional rice and grilled tomato. Kabob-e-Koobideh was made spicy for my dad since he loves spicy food. Side note: this dish isn't normally prepared spicy so we were curious to find out. The spice they added was a type of curry which was really good, but super spicy. I could only do one bite (I'm a weakling with spicy food). The meat was cooked perfect! It was tender and juicy and super satisfying.   Shiraz Persian Cuisine definitely made us feel at home with their delicious dishes. If I am ever in Calgary, I would return for their Barg, Green Salad and to try that Iranian Pizza. I am very curious to see what that entails."}
{"text":"Went here last weekend, service was terrible. Watched our server struggle how to make our drinks, our empty plates sat infront of us for about 20 minutes before i went up to her and asked for the bill and a to go box. She was focused on other tables. Amazing food though besides service."}
{"text":"Service was not the greatest, restaurant was almost half full and only one person was serving the table, I ordered eggplant stew and it wasn't the greatest, the rice portion was small. On the other hand the atmosphere was great, cozy place clean and neat. It will not be my first choice for Persian food in the future."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised when I walked in the door, as the decor and atmosphere is nice, which you'd never know as a passerby on the street.  I was thankful that our server took the time to review the menu with our group, as we all were inexperienced with this type of food.  It was very flavorful, well presented and reasonably priced.  It was cool that I got to sample the carbonated yogurt beverage.  I particularly enjoyed my appetizer, Kashk-e-bademjan.  It was quite busy so a bit noisy for awhile, but it quieted down later and made it easier to visit with friends.  Staff are super friendly and courteous, service was moderately paced.  Some menu items are only served on certain days and there was one dish mentioned to us that wasn't on the menu.  I'd encourage anyone to check out Shiraz at least once, primarily for the great food.  Being served by such hospitable staff is an added bonus."}
{"text":"We started with salad and then had the tour of Persia which was a meal for three.  It included rice, chicken and beef kabobs.  We finished with pistachio ice cream.  Everything was very good."}
{"text":"If you're food's 15.99 advertise it as such. Don't come back with a 18.99 bill and tell me it's the new price because the economy's bad.  I went to Shiraz today for lunch since it's a block away from where I work. My plan was to go there all the time since I recently started working at my new job and love Persian food. However after my first experience today, the Vietnamese restaurant and the donair shop across the street are where I'm gonna go for lunch..   I ordered the chicken which was labelled as 15.99 on the menu. When the bill came back, it was 18.99. I asked for the menu and the server said he couldn't give me a menu. I told him the price for the chicken was 15.99. He said he knows, but the economy's bad and we have to charge 18.99.  I paid the 18.99 but they lost a potential regular over two dollars. Expect them to go out of business before the end of the year.   That blew my mind. Who says that?   Class, get some."}

{"text":"Very good iranian cuisine to dine in. The owner was very friendly.   Ash soap was excellent.  Kashk e badmnjan was one of the best I have ever tasted. The rice was also tasty. Kabab kobedeh was good but not the best. Kinjajeh (lamb tikka) was of a fresh lamb meat, I could easily tell.  Improvement that I might think of are iranian in house made Bread instead of ready made arabic bread. The tea after the food was not also a typical Iranian tea, it was just a tea bag type."}
{"text":"Best Persian cuisine in Calgary.  I am really glad to finally found a good Persian restaurant in Calgary. The food is really delicious and the staff are very friendly.  I really like their Kabob-e-Koobideh (Ground beef) and I usually order Kashk-e-bademjan for appetizer. Then for dessert I sometimes get their saffron ice cream.  They have a good promotion on Tuesdays and Wednesdays for Kabob-e-Koobideh.  I highly recommend this place to eat, for exotic and tasty Persian food."}
{"text":"Great food!!! Lamb was to die for!!!! Dolmas were very good and rice dish was very flavorful. Even a simple seasonal salad was very good. We were too full to order dessert but will do next time."}
