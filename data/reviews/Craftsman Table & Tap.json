{"text":"Craftsman is probably my favorite of the Food Fight restaurants. Delicious food, friendly and knowledgable staff, a nice atmosphere, and good prices.  Some menu highlights for me would be the cheese curds (some of the best I've ever had), the brisket sandwich (flavorful, generous on the meat, and filling), and the smoked chicken and cheddar salad (probably the least healthy salad ever, but packed with delicious smoked cheddar, chicken, bacon and homemade buttermilk ranch).  They have a great beer selection that changes often. I've discovered some fantastic beers there, with the help of their knowledgable staff.  The upstairs party room seems like a great place to have a get together, and the outside patio is perfect for summer dinners."}
{"text":"Don't go here!  Ok, the beer is good and we enjoyed the pretzel.  A well done burger was bright red.  Perch was muddy and way too much batter and air.  The fries were soggy and resting in grease.  The management was great and very accommodating, but there are too many great places on a Friday night to spend time here.   Cooking a burgers or fries is not a high bar..."}
{"text":"The food was great! We randomly took a wrong turn in the neighborhood and decided to stop for lunch. It was a busy, family friendly place. Food was prepared quickly and service was great. We had cheese curds, the brisket sandwich, and the Craftsman burger. All were very enjoyable and hit the spot for an average Saturday afternoon. Prices were about average for a bar & grill."}
{"text":"I have to believe that the Craft Table and Tap is still a work in progress.  I have been a few times and I am/was hoping to find similar menu and quality as Coopers.  I tried the burgers which were pretty good but the fries were not hot?  This is a basic.  Appetizers are OK but everything is fried. The Mac and Cheese side is boring.  Salads are good!  I found the bar service to be better than the table service - I'm not sure why?  Finally, I like the beer selection.  It would be great if they could have more rotating beers (say 5 or 6) based on special available craft beers.  The only thing is the prices for a glass of beer.  I think that $4 or $5 a glass is enough for them to make their fair profit.   Is it trying to be a regular tavern?  Then lower prices and options.  I think the market is looking for a bistro with better food options (less fried food and some entrees).  I will keep going back for a while because I want them to make it.  Something is still not right."}
{"text":"We had heard positive remarks about Craftsman.  I can't say that we enjoyed the food as we never got that far. We waited for a table for 45 minutes, which is fine, as they told us up front. But once we were sat, we were never greeted by any waitstaff or served. After about 15 mins we did ask a busperson to ask our waitperson to stop by.  After another 15 minutes with no contact and repeatedly seeing who appeared to be the manager and other waitstaff walk by and making eye contact with us and gestures by us for assistance, still no service or even a \"hello, I'll be right with you.\"  So we got up, gathered our coats, and quietly left.  Maybe because we left quietly, no one raised an eyebrow on our way out or said goodbye.  In all fairness, I think this is unusual for a Food Fight restaurant and I tend to doubt that this is a pattern.  We may try it again but there are so many other options in the area on how to spend our dining dollars, we are likely to give other places a chance before going back to Craftsman and giving them another."}
{"text":"We went in for dinner on a Friday night. They don't take reservations but they have an upstairs lounge with drinks and apps to sit in while you wait for a table. We didn't have to wait too terribly long. We didn't get drinks but just ate dinner. The burgers were fantastic and the fried perch was very good as well. Service was attentive and friendly and the prices are reasonable. They get a slight mark down for the lack of entree options in the upstairs lounge but overall very pleased. We will likely be back!"}
{"text":"Cheese curds are amazing.  The menu is small but very good.  I enjoy the pear and walnut salad, burgers are good, my favorite was the steak sandwich but unfortunately the menu is seasonal and they haven't brought it back yet.  Fries could be better, too thin and soggy not crisp.  Outdoor seating is available, gets a little busy during dinner time, they have tvs near the bar but monks is a better destination if you plan to watch a game while you eat."}
{"text":"Decent beer selection. Curds were good. Even really enjoyed the atmosphere and friendly staff. Was less than impressed with the mushroom burger. The seasoned mushrooms were so salty that it was hard to eat. I'd go back if in the neighborhood but not as a destination."}
{"text":"Just ok. Price to quality ratio for food isn't good. Atmosphere is reasonable. The extra 4.99 for salmon cakes on a salad were a joke. Not pleased with whole experience, but also not a total loss. Just average."}
{"text":"I really LOVE the atmosphere of the table and tap. It looks nice and new, everything seems fresh and clean. The servers are all very friendly, except for the one waitress who gets way too pushy and asks if you're ready to order every 1 minute. Their food is quality but I always find myself taking forever to decide because I don't really love anything on the menu. Do you want an okay sandwich for 11 dollars or a steak for 30? Hm. The place is nice but their prices are a little higher than I like. Oh but I should mention their fries are fresh and taste amazinggg!  Their cheese curds are great and they're known for them, but really, 9 dollars for fried cheese?  For whatever reason, I always find myself wanting to go back. Probably the great atmosphere, staff, and location."}
{"text":"In the top tier of brunch options in Madison. Some of the highest quality food options around, and restaurant is also well designed.  Many tvs available as well. Very strong brunch menu, and they have multiple scramblers and Benedict variations that may be the best in town. Highly recommend a visit for brunch."}
{"text":"Craftsman has become one of our Madison favorites, and we have been there numerous times, usually for lunch or libations.  We repeated yesterday.  Something was off from the very start.  First no one took our initial drink order, despite the fact that we were seated at the same time as the outdoor table next to us.  Then it appeared that the same waitress for that other table noticed that no one had come to our table, so she took our order.  It subsequently turned out that she was not our waitress at all, but a different one brought the drinks and rapidly disappeared, despite the fact that we were ready with our food order.  When she finally came back, she took our order.  By now the next table had been served their lunches and were well into them.  And we waited, and waited and waited.  The other table finished, had another drink, and left.  After a half hour wait, we managed to catch the attention of our waitress who stated, \"Oh yes, it will be right out.\"  Wrong again.  Another ten minute wait and I finally caught the attention of the one person in the place that really appeared to be working the hardest, who must have been the young woman in charge, Ashley.  She heard our concerns and left.  A couple of minutes later, she appeared with our food.  Hot sandwiches were already room temp and the fries were cold.  I wonder how long this stuff sat in the kitchen waiting for somebody to claim it.  Anyway, Ashley was very solicitous and realized how messed up this had been so far.  Then our waitress reappeared, and I asked if there was some problem today and why everything was so messed up.  No excuse, no reason, just \"so sorry\", and disappeared again.  We can only assume she was having some kind of personal problem.    Then, when we finally finished, Ashley came back and made the whole thing right by not charging us for the lunches.  Great way to keep two dissatisfied customers coming back.  I am giving Craftsman five stars, because it would be unfair to detract from their rating after we were treated right in the end."}
{"text":"Service was wonderful! Our server was so warm and friendly and fit in with our group with ease.   My friends tried the beer flight...ill let you draw your own conclusions as to the hilarity of THAT situation.   I got the crockpot. Was a little bland. Like the flavor was there, but it just needed to be kicked up a notch. The steak Oscar was definitely missing something, steak portion was very gristle-esque.   Cheese curds were good! I've had better but they were definitely on par.   Great establishment overall!!"}
{"text":"Do you like locally sourced foods (and let's be honest, if you're in Madison and reading Yelp I'm pretty sure I already know the answer to this question...)?  Are you on a quest to eat all of Madison's best cheese curds? And by the way, if you just answered \"No,\" you either need to update your bucket list or go see the doctor about options to treat lactose intolerance - perhaps both.  Do you like extensive, rotating taps?  Do you want to meet a beer sommelier who also offers \"Beerology\" classes and runs a beer blog?  If you answered yes to any of the questions above, it's probably time to venture outside of the Isthmus to visit this surprisingly cool Middleton spot!"}
{"text":"Went there with a herd of gallimimus on a Friday night.  I was hoping that it would be a mosquito in the amber type of place, but I was wrong.  Having to wait for a table was like waiting for the jeeps to start back up after the power went out during the test run.  Service was about as slow moving as a brachiosaurus trying to eat some leaves and branches off a 200 foot tall tree.  The fries were cold, under-seasoned and thinner than raptor claws.  We ordered the turkey sandwich, that left a little to be desired.  The brisket sandwich was quite good.  It reminded me of the time I first bit in to a blood sucking lawyer that was taking a poop in the bathroom stall.  My favorite part of the experience was the delicious scotchypoo that I sucked down faster than a cow being dropped in to a raptor tank.  In summation, it was a nice looking dining room with slow service and okay food. Don't waste your helicopter ride."}
{"text":"I've been here for lunch and dinner, never had bad food. Love the cheese curds, might be best in town. Great fish fry, though a little pricey for two pieces. Service however has been questionable a couple times."}
{"text":"This was horrible. We read the poor reviews but thought we'd give it a shot considering it's a Food Fight place. The host seemed uninterested in being there. The waitress was completely absent from the get-go. No drink refills or any checking in on us. We went around 6:15 on a Friday, so it wasn't a super busy time but not a dead time, either.   The food was not good to the point that we left food there (even my husband), which isn't typical. We had the brisket sandwich (bland) and fries (the fries were good), the pork verde (I didn't try it but my husband didn't eat most of it), and the crispy fish appetizer (fine enough but greasy and have since discovered that we don't like smelt, which is a small fishy tasting fish that's eaten/fried whole with the bones in).   I can't remember the last time we ever went somewhere and left with such a distaste for the whole experience-- the food and service.   Maybe if you were going just for the bar later in the night, it'd be worthwhile. But then again, I'm not sure what food you'd order aside from fries. All in all, a big pass for us."}
{"text":"Was recommended by another famiy member so met everyone there.  First of all it was very noisy - had to talk over all the noise and it was cold.  By the end of the meal, I had to put my hands in my jacket pockets.  Food ?  The french fries were terrible - McDonald's are better than theirs - lots of small bits of warmish fries.  Had a Cuban Pork Sandwich.  Couldn't decide what the flavor was because it was very bland.  Waitress came by several times to fill our water glasses but otherwise not a place I would ever go back to."}
{"text":"Went last night for dinner with 4 other people. Beer selection was good and the bartender was prompt with service while we waited for our table.   Our server was attentive at first and the service gradually declined throughout the evening. She is the main reason the review is a 3 and not a 4. The food was very good. We had the cheese curds and the pretzel. The curds have to be in the top 5 of the city. Definitely better than The Old Fashioned. The mustard and cheese sauce with the pretzel were excellent.  One person had the teriyaki steak and the rest of us had burgers. She forgot one person's burger and he had to wait at least 15 min while the rest of us ate. She said she entered his burger and deleted a comment on it and accidentally deleted the whole burger. She gave him a free dessert so that made it better.  She did not refill our waters at all and was slow with beer refills.   It is too bad because the food was very good and the atmosphere was great. I'd give it another chance but I cannot give 4 stars. Better luck next time."}
{"text":"Compared to anything else with in walking distance Craftsman has the best beer selection. The overall food selection isn't bad. I've had the Ba Minh. a daily special, and the burger which were all well executed. I did the seasonal Risotto once with steak and I wasn't as impressed. Risotto didn't have a ton of flavor from the vegetables and the steak was under seasoned. The cheese curds are great.   My biggest complaint is the music. It's an horrible mix of 90s and some 2000s pop hits. I'd honestly have 2 or 3 more beers but the music is that bad."}
{"text":"The food here is great, and I've never had a problem with the service. But the temperature of this restaurant is positively polar. I was told that nothing could be done about it due to the design of the space and HVAC systems. Bring a jacket when you go!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place - reminded me a lot of Cooper's Tavern. I had a burger the first time I went and it was AMAZING. Had the brussel sprout salad the second time which was a little disappointing. They also have some amazing breads for their sandwiches."}
{"text":"The best portobello sandwich I have ever had!!! Must try!! And hand cut fries to die for!"}
{"text":"Craftsman is one of my favorite places to go. Their staff is incredibly friendly, food is wonderful and their rotating beer selection gives you an opportunity to expand your taste."}
{"text":"Solid food, but nothing exciting or different. I'm not sure what kind of theme they are going for, which makes the place lack personality.  Strengths - good wait staff and some good beer options  Downfalls - not sure it is worth the price and nothing too exciting."}
{"text":"Great food! Great beer!! Great service!!!  I visited this place with four others on Saturday, March 8, 2014.  I had the beef stew.  It was fantastic.  Loaded with tender beef.  I was incredibly impressed with our goddess of a waitress, Erina.  Her professionalism was superb.  Despite clearly falling for me, a gray haired man many years her senior, she continued to deliver phenomenal service.  :)  I hope she's still there next time I'm in Wisconsin!"}
{"text":"Our first visit was on a Saturday night. The joint was jumpin', service was friendly and efficient, food was very nice. I had the bleu cheeseburger with the side greens. It was delicious. Two others in our party had salmon, I believe. They loved it. The fourth member of our party had the pork chop. I remember him really liking it.  Second visit was a Monday night a few weeks later. It was two of us just looking for a nice meal in the neighborhood after a lo g day. The World Cup soccer games were on. LOUD. We couldn't hear each other across the table.   It took a good 5 minutes before anyone took our drink order. The restaurant was largely empty. At that point, we should have left but we liked the place before and it had been a long day.  I ordered the green pea curry. It was described as \"vegetables of the season\" and cashews, as well as the peas. It comes with a side of housemade naan and rice. $13.95. What actually appeared: a bowl of thick pea soup flavored with curry and maybe 6 snap peas stirred into it. There couldn't have been a Tablespoon of cashews in it. As for vegetables of the season - that was half a mushroom. The rice was dry and the naan was as stale as a crouton.  I will not be back."}
{"text":"I'm sorry to call out Elizabeth V. below, but you are an idiot.  Soft shell crab is exactly what it sounds like-  a soft shelled crab.  Your sandwich was supposed to have a shell on the crab.    I've been to this place twice.  The best cheese curds that I have ever tasted!  They are so crunchy, but still light and fluffy.  I don't know how they pull that off.  Amazing!  Their burgers are great.  A good lean piece of beef on a pretzel bun with blue cheese from a local farm that could be a blue medal winner!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by Craftsman Table & Tap. I went here for dinner--expecting run-of-the-mill, Wisconsin pub food, but found this restaurant to be a whole lot better than average.  Their cheese curds were great (and I've had a lot of curds since moving to WI) they have a lighter, crispy breading that is unique. I got the fish and chips and found the fish to be quality. Everyone in our party seemed happy with their meal selections.  The atmosphere was nice and cozy and we like the surrounding area this restaurant is in."}
{"text":"We have eaten at Craftsman many times and I'm always happy with the food and ambience, but almost always frustrated with the wait and organization of being seated and served. There are two entrances to this restaurant which I feel confuses getting your name on the seating list and getting seated in general. They don't take reservations but I just found out that they will put your name on the waiting list if you call ahead. This was a bit frustrating as I watched so many people getting seated before us. Oh well, I guess I'll just have to call ahead from now on.  I ordered the GF salmon last time with a specialty Crispin. It was really delicious and more filling than I expected. A good place to eat in Middleton, if you're ok with waiting. Call ahead."}
{"text":"Nice hidden gem, local joint with character. All our entrees were good, fish and chips and cheese curds top notch. Good beer menu and nice wait staff, will try again if in Middleton"}
{"text":"Wanted to try out the newest Food Fight restaurant as they always seem to have good food and service.   Atmosphere was nice, the building is simple yet formal.  Beer selection is good as you would expect from a tap house.   Tried the cheese curd appetizer, which was excellent.    It was a Wednesday night and was fairly busy, we were told there would be a 45-60 minute wait for a table for four.  We found a seat at the bar, ordered drinks, and within twenty minutes were called for our table.      We placed our order and for some reason there was a backlog in the kitchen that caused our food to not be served for well over an hour,  which was obviously unacceptable.    Normally I would give a negative review for the experience, but the manager handled it very professionally.  Once she realized our order had become lost she not only came out to the table to apologize, but ended up comp'ing the meal.  Classy act.    Overall, I would eat here again and give them another chance.  The food was good, the restaurant is nice inside, and they have a great selection of microbrews."}
{"text":"I am from out of town so I always like to check out local restaurants. Shandi was my server, she was very pleasant and knowledgeable about their menu. I had the Crock pot meal and the Brussels Spouts salad. Everything was great! I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"The fish fry I ordered was terrible, and not worth ordering ever again. I may go back there an try something else, because I liked the overall environment and beer choices.  I had to send my fish back because I felt it was undercooked. It was very dense, and not flaky at all. The breading was too crispy. The coleslaw was not very good either. Total dissapointment.r"}
{"text":"Great food and great service! Really enjoyed the New Years Eve dinner special and thought it was really reasonably priced for a three course meal and three beers to accompany each course. The reason I couldn't give five stars was because of the misquoted wait time and the inefficiency of the hostess. We called in when we left our home to get a wait time and put our names on the list and the time was 45 min. It took us twenty minutes to get there and after checking in it was another hour before we were seated. Fortunately, we were out on a date so the extra time waiting was just more time to share laughs and stories but I do believe there should be more of an effort to under promise on wait time and over deliver on the time you get seated.   Once we were seated the rest of the night was above par and we will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, excellent food! We ordered the pretzel rings for an appetizer, and (what seemed like very quickly) our waitress came over and apologized they they had run our pretzels to the wrong table, so they were going to make us new ones and take them off of our bill. We didn't even think we had been waiting long for them, but it was very nice for a place of business to take responsibility and try to right a wrong (unfortunately most places don't bother these days). The food was delicious and they have an awesome selection of beer and other drinks! We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Staff was very friendly.  We were by on an off time 9 PM but the outside area still had plenty of patrons.  My only real issue was that for the price paid I expected a little more fish.  The fish and chips only had 2 really small pieces of fish, should have taken a picture, and it was about $15.  On the plus side, my wifes sandwich was really good and the portion was proper for the price paid.  They also had many craft beer choices.  When I'm in Madison area again I will stop by but I'll probably get something other than the Fish and Chips."}
{"text":"The upstairs lounge is a great place to grab a few pre-dinner cocktails and some great appetizers.  Kicking myself for not getting the cheese curds, but did try the pretzels.  Totally awesome.  I had the fish and chips - the fish was some of the best I've had in Madison and their tartar sauce was out of this world, along with the coleslaw.  Hubs had the steak oscar and said it was great, and the steak fries - wow, where did they find giant potatoes?? Service was good and it's a food fight restaurant, so they have extra deals during food week! Recommended!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate there recently and both ordered the lake perch special.  It was less than mediocre.  There were only 3 relatively small pieces and the breading was soggy. The fries included in the special were room temperature and clumped together.  The cole slaw had way too much mayonnaise.  We don't plan to return for food.  Despite the unsatisfactory food, service was prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"This is a go-to restaurant for me and my family. Excellent food, good mix of entrees and sandwiches, and a tasty mixed-greens side (or fries, for the carb enthusiast). Drink selection is great, and though there are rarely deals available I think the drink prices are comparable to other pubs in this price bracket.  Can't go wrong here. Give it a shot."}
{"text":"Gauging solely on service since no one came to take our food order. Waited 30 minutes after being seated and left to go somewhere else to get dinner. There was hardly anyone here at the time. Dining with kids, our party doesn't have much patience. Not recommended for dining with kids. They serve up some weak sauce.j"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and each time I was not that amazing. I was never greeted at the door when I entered, and once I was sat, the service was very slow, even if the restaurant wasn't busy. The first time I went, I had the Craftsman Burger. I couldn't even finish it because it was so bland. The meat had no taste and the toppings (bacon, cheddar, garlic mayo, lettuce, and onion) provided no help with that. The second time, I was going to give a go at the Seasonal Pasta Bake, but that was only served after 5pm (I was there for lunch). Instead, I got the BBQ Pulled Pork sandwich. Decent, but nothing memorable. Overall, I would only go back there for the cheese curds and not order anything else."}
{"text":"Craftsman Tab and Table, is a great Bar/restaurant... The service was overall good and the servers were nice! The food was great and very well season! The craftsman Burger was really good and well season! Beside all that we did have a issue when we received our BLT club sandwich witch was suppose to be with Bacon, Turkey, Tomato, Lettuce but the BLT did not have Turkey witch is really odd because it's a BLT! We did tell the server about the issue and he was very kind and apologize to us and did not put the BLT in the pay check! Overall I would return!"}
{"text":"Two stars for the food tonight, which was fine, as usual. But knocking off 3 stars because our server was sick and kept coughing on us. Just while taking our orders, she coughed multiple times, right over my infant in a highchair at the end of the table. I gave her a surprised \"you've got to be joking\" look and she just kept on doing it, didn't step away or anything. It's flu season and it's a really bad year. My family has been very careful with hand washing and trying to avoid exposure this season, so it's not fun to be trapped in a seat with someone coughing over you. We stay home when we're unwell. Too bad others don't show the same courtesy. The managers of this restaurant should send sick workers home when they show up at work coughing-- especially in food service."}
{"text":"I went there one night and the experience/ambiance was really well done for a pub setting. I ordered the 6OZ beef tenderloin with fingerling potatoes, grilled spinach, and grilled asparagus. I was a fan of nothing in that meal except for the asparagus. The spinach was good for the first few bites, but was too rich for my liking, and it was obvious they just soaked the potatoes in vinegar/salt water. The steak was a major disappointment. I ordered it medium, but it came out much too rare and was extremely chewy, as a direct result of not being cooked long enough. The asparagus as I have mentioned before was exquisite though, perfectly seasoned.  I sampled some of my mom's tomato basil soup and her fries, and I was subtly stealing fries from her plate all night, they were so amazing. The TB soup was really good too, very smooth. My dad wasn't a fan of his angus burger, and I don't think this will be our first choice when choosing a restaurant in Middleton. If you go there, the fries are a must, and you can't go wrong with the soup, just don't order any red meat."}
{"text":"This place is great. Super friendly staff, lovely spaces, approachable food--the chef does experimental stuff and comfort food with equal aplomb. Solid tap beer selection, lots of locals mixed with interesting craft & imports. I was pleasantly surprised by the Monaco, a cocktail with balsamic reduction and sparking wine."}
{"text":"This was my first experience at this place. As someone else mentioned, when you first walk in, this place is very \"classy\" and looks like a higher end restaurant and bar. My friends and I just went to get a quick drink at the bar before we had to be somewhere. For a Thursday evening, the place was crowded. We barely found a spot at the bar, but eventually, we were able to get our drinks. I look forward to coming back and trying their food."}
{"text":"Incredible cheese curds!!! Came with a large group and service was great. Very friendly and welcoming staff. Had the craftsman salad which was a healthy and filling substitute for the usual burger and fries. Although I did try some of my boyfriends fries and they were awesome. Will visit again if in town!!"}
{"text":"I SO wanted to love this place - okay, even like it - and am incredibly disappointed by the food and service.  We went 5/1/12 - seemingly long enough for them to have worked out the initial kinks.  I came away insulted that they call themselves a \"gastropub,\" as it's some of the worst food I've had in years.  Hummus app was laughably bad quality - and by the time our horrid salads came (and we ate only half of them because they were so flavorless, not fresh, and stingy on ingredients) - we were not laughing.  Neither was our waiter.  I don't mind a curmudgeon, but this guy was just plain rude from the moment he first approached our table.  I used to be a waitress, and if I get bad service, I only tip 15%...I wanted to stiff this guy, he was so unfriendly.  Dude, why are you in the SERVICE industry?  Craftsman, why do you HIRE such folk?  I want to support my local pub, but they have MAJOR overhauling to do on their menu, in their kitchen, and in the front of the house.  At this point, I would only go back to have a beer."}
{"text":"I'm a Craftsman loyalist; sure, Tipsy Cow is better, but that's a haul from the west side. The patio is great in the summer and the staff is always friendly. If you're looking to get blown away with taste, this isn't your spot. But if you're looking for a consistent roster of good food Craftsman is a solid option."}
{"text":"Modern pub with an excellent selection of beer and some great food choices. Seating choices include tables (indoors or out),. booths. and at the bar.  I had the mushroom and beef stew, which tasted like it was cooked in wine. Excellent, and they give you a fork because it is so thick that a spoon is not needed,  My wife had a wrap, which she said was excellent.   Both of us were unable to finish our meals because portion size was generous.  And probably because we started with their famous cheese curds. Excellent!  You'll like it..."}
{"text":"Great breakfast! Corned beef hash and yogurt are fantastic. Every plate we saw looked really good. Service was excellent. Steve took great care of us. I will definitely eat here again!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I did a spur-of-the-moment visit after work on a Monday. Service was pleasant and attentive; and that's really all that went well. Appetizer (little fish bites) and entrees (salad and burger) were no better than average, while \"hand-cut fries\" were over-done yet somehow still tasteless. Tried to order a beer off the menu, but they were out; even the back-up diet Coke tasted funny.  We don't intend to ever return - there are too many nearby options much, much better than what we experienced."}
{"text":"Been there on two occasions, once on business & once with wife. Food is definitely above average, beer selection is impressive, cheese curds are easily 2nd best in town, staff is professional, ambiance is enjoyable."}
{"text":"It's okay...nice bar, great drink selection but the food isn't as creative as I expected. The quality was fine, but from the upscale look of the place I thought the menu might be more exciting."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and am just not impressed.  My most recent visit sealed the deal for me not coming back.  Service is always slow.  Takes about 15 minutes to receive a drink order from the bar for mixed drinks off their menu.  About 1.5 hours for lunch, which is long.  My friend ordered her burger medium and it came out well.  Didn't send it back since it took 45 minutes to receive our food and we didn't want to wait any longer to eat.  Our son's chicken tenders came out burnt, so we had to send those back.  Brisket sandwich was bland and dry, but luckily they serve au jus with it for dipping.  I've had three different soups here and each time I couldn't eat them, they just did not taste good.  Food is on the pricey side.  Cheese curds are the one bright spot, so it would be worthwhile just coming for drinks and cheese curds."}
{"text":"Big fan of this restaurant. I've been here twice, most recently for FoodFight week. The BEST cheese curds you will ever eat. Another fun app is Poutine, also great. Upper scale bar food with a dim cozy atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went with my parents last weekend. We requested to sit at the bar for a whole before we were seated. The bar staff was very attentive with drinks and refills. My mom was excited that they had her favorite, Capital Supper Club. We enjoyed the famous cheese curds. My mom and I loved them, but my dad did think they were salty for his taste. We were then seated at our table and our server was pleased to see we already had drinks and appetizers taken care of. The restaurant was very busy as it there was a football that day. I ordered the grilled salmon with mashed potatoes and roasted brussels sprouts. Everything was so delicious. My dad enjoyed his burger, but again found the fries too salty. I tried some of his fries and he was right. My mom enjoyed everything on her plate. The server was clearly new, and like I said earlier, it was busy, so service was a bit slow. The quality of food definitely made up for it though, at least in my book."}
{"text":"Hubby and I went her for Date Night this past month.  It was a great night, weather-wise, so we sat outside.  It was a Sunday night and it was not very busy, so the service was attentive and friendly.  Hubby and I both ordered beers to start.  Unfortunately, they had run out of my first choice, so I had to find another.  We started with German style pretzels with two dipping sauces (beer cheese and a horseradish based sauce).  I was not a fan of the horseradish sauce because it was an overly horseradish taste.  Very strong flavor.  For dinner, I had the bacon burger with sweet potato fries and hubby got the brisket sandwich with fries.  I only ate about half of my burger.  The bun was pretty big/filling and the flavor of the burger itself was just okay in my opinion.  The brisket sandwich was good, but a little dry.  For dessert, we got the caramel pecan creme brulee, which was probably the best part of the meal.  I liked the flavor and thought it was cooked perfectly.  The price for everything was reasonable and the service throughout the night was great.  My biggest regret is not ordering the cheese curds because I've heard good things about those."}
{"text":"First the good: cute interior, great low lighting. My party all thought the cheese curds here were the best we had in Madison and we went to many places and had them (including the tourist trap The Old Fashioned. Just don't.). These curds were fried in a very light batter that elevated them. The pretzels are also delicious. Last, they offer many unique local beers and wine.  Now for the bad: everything else. No joke. Supposedly their prime rib sandwich is their house specialty so three of us ordered it. It was bone dry... Inedible. They do not serve it with au jus but this sandwich is screaming for it. It is a terrible entree. None of us ate beyond two bites. Even the waitress seemed embarrassed about the poor quality. The other person with us ordered salmon cakes and sweet potato fries. She too found it disgusting in both texture and flavor.  In summary, this is a great choice for drinks and appetizers but I recommend going elsewhere for dinner."}
{"text":"Crafstman Table and Tap is a terrific local restaurant and bar owned by Food Fight Inc. I generally enjoy Food Fight restuarants because the service is usually very good (they tend to hire people who are passionate about good service (always friendly, usually make sure a water glass is filled, they have a smile, and regularly checking on you and your needs)). And that is the case at Food Fight. Even when the bar is a couple people deep with folks, the bartenders get frustrated (I know I used to tend bar) but the never show it. They are always patient and friendly.  I have eaten here at least a dozen times. Craftsman has some great sandwiches. I love the Cuban and the Brisket sandwiches. The Cuban is heaping mounds of pulled pork and ham atop crunchy pickles, with swiss, whole grain mustard that has a nice tang to it, and a perfectly grilled focacia. The Pulled Brisket is similar. Lots of good, locally sourced brisket with cheddar, garlic and caramelized onions, and again that perfectly grilled focacia. My kids love this sandwich. Add in a few distinct touches like beet salad (yummy!), fried walleye cheeks and german pretzels, plus some standards like out-of-this world cheese curds, burgers, meatloaf and tasty sweet potato fries and you have the makings of a good local  eatery.  SO while the food is good, the beer selection is spectacular. 18 Beers on tap from all over, many local, including New Belgium, Bells, Oso, Central Waters, Ale Asylum, New Glarus, just to name a few. many more available in bottles.  Great party room upstairs. We have been going here for our FFL draft every year since it opened and I have attended graduation parties and other events there. Plus they have a balcony that looks out onto the neighborhood. Food was good too.  Four Stars because as good as it is it is not spectacular and may be a little on the pricy side."}
{"text":"The brunch on Sunday was great, the best breakfast you can get in Madison area. Portions are big. Bloody Mary's comes with a huge chaser. Must have brunch in Madison area.   PS for people complaining: don't go to any restaurant on Friday/Saturday night to expect great service or food, places are JUST TOO F... BUSY, just my 2 cents..."}
{"text":"Went there on a Saturday for breakfast and was surprised to see only a few people in the place, which always makes me a little nervous. Server was great and responsive.   Between the four of us, we all had different dishes. All of them were awesome. The scrambler's were th ebest and they used actual cheese curds rather than shredded cheese. This was incredible! Portions may have been a little less than I would have expected, but I'm used to the greasy spoon type places that give you way too much. That being said, we all left satisfied and it was an awesome meal. We will for sure be back again!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch for the alleged \"best curds in Madison\" and boy did they not disappoint. The curds were awesome, and had a great selection of beers from stouts to sours. Also had the brisket sandwich which was equally delicious. Prices were very reasonable, and the restaurant was clean and well put together. If you're looking for lunch in the Middleton area, this is a must. Make sure you have an early lunch as it fills up very quickly!!"}
{"text":"I've gone to Craftsman multiple times, and never reviewed them because I always left disappointed. I live in the neighborhood and wanted nothing more than to love the place, but it was always just blah.  About two weeks ago they hired a new chef, and WOW! It is fantastic now and I'm so happy to have this place so close to my house! He has made just small changes to the menu so far but they have made a huge difference. Even the lettuce in the salads is better.  We started with the curry poutine which was amazing. I dream about it. I will go back to Craftsman just for that. My husband got a burger and it was so juicy and full of flavor! Before, it was just fine. Nothing special. I got the chicken and smoked cheddar salad, which could possibly be one of the best salads I've ever had. The lettuce was fresh, the bacon was crunchy, and their buttermilk ranch dressing is addicting.  If you have gone to Craftsman in the past and were not impressed, stop back in now."}
{"text":"Yes, yes, and more YES to this place!!!  My first time here was for Beer-O bingo in February, which runs all year except football season (I was told).  They have a guest brewery who sponsors and offers prizes.  The only requirement is that you spend at least $10 in order to participate, which is not hard to do.  It was really fun and exciting and they had many rounds; so, it felt like you truly had a chance to win.  I ended up winning the grand prize that day, which included a Craftsman gift certificate.    A few weeks ago, I went to redeem my gift certificate.  It was a nice day so we sat on the patio.  We were served by Erin who was absolutely spectacular.  She made great suggestions (such as the watermelon beer they offered - It was perfection for my palette).  She was also super accommodating.  When we mentioned we were going to split our meals, she took the extra step to ask the kitchen to cut our sandwiches in half to make things easier.  So A+ for the service for Erin!!  Now, onto the food....  There is a reason this place was voted best cheese curds in Madison.   The batter is so light, crispy, and flavorful.  I could eat these all day!  We also ordered a burger and a chicken pesto sandwich.  THEY WERE DELICIOUS.  I had to force myself to stop eating and the only reason I did that is because I wanted to savor the deliciousness and would have something to look forward to for dinner when I took the other half of my meal home.  My only \"complaint\" is that the patio chairs have armrests on them and, thus, are not super comfortable or friendly to those of us with wider hips/legs.  So my legs were pretty sore when we finished.  It would be awesome if they had chairs that did not have the armrests for the patio.  But, alas, that \"complaint\" will not stop me from returning and talking about Craftsman.  This place is absolutely amazing and I really can't wait to go back and try some other dishes (and eat more of their cheese curds)."}
{"text":"Excellent service, friendly staff - really enjoyed the outdoor patio. Cheese curds were fluffy inside and crisp on the outside and made with local fresh cheese."}
{"text":"I you're looking for a quaint yet lively suburban gem, look no further. Craftsman Tap and Table is  just the place to get your fill of traditional American fare. Do yourself a favor and order the cheese curds as they are definitely in my top five. Sit on the patio and enjoy one of there many drink choices: excellent wine selection, lots of ciders and always a great beer selection. If you're looking for the perfect suburban date night venue then look no further."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place.  We can even take our dog when it is nice outside and sit outside."}
{"text":"This place was amazing in every way possible. It had a great vibe. I've been their twice, had two different waiters and two different bartenders. Each one of them was great at their job.   The beer selection is amazing also. On tap, they have some popular breweries, but they have brews that are a bit rare or very small batch productions.   Cheese curds- Amazing Sweet Potato Fries- Amazing Bacon Cheese Burger - Amazing Pulled Brisket - Amazing  Was in town for 3 days and I went here twice, if that tells you anything!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have visited Craftsman Table & Tap twice since we moved to Madison. It is located in a trendy Middleton neighborhood and isn't too far of a drive from where we live. It is the perfect place to enjoy a casual (but delicious) meal and good drinks.   I wouldn't consider myself a cheese curd connoisseur in any way shape or form, but I feel like I have had many cheese curds in my life, growing up in Wisconsin and all. I have to say that Craftsman's cheese curds are THE BEST cheese curds I have ever had in my life. I say that with complete honesty and no exaggeration. They are incredible. I don't know what in particular makes them so delicious, but I don't think I could visit this restaurant and NOT order them. Seriously, check them out.  Aside from the (amazing) cheese curds, the entrees themselves were delicious as well. The first time we visited I had a burger which was cooked perfectly. On our most recent visit I had their fish fry, which was a decent deal and a generous portion. The breading was perfect and the fish was not over or under cooked.   They have a decent beer selection and would be a good place to visit if you're looking to try out a number of new beers.  Overall each time we have been there is more enjoyable than the last. We will be back!"}
{"text":"The only good thing about brunch today were the cheese curds. Our waiter was arrogant and didn't listen. We asked him 3 times for a glass of milk and asked him to hold the chocolate sauce on chocolate chip pancakes. He held the chocolate chips. He was so slow too. Not a pleasant person. The pancakes were over cooked. McDonalds does better. The place was not busy and I can see why. Unless they overhaul their service, I'm done going there (and learn how to cook a pancake)."}
{"text":"An interesting foray into the restaurant business by Sears.  Craftsman tools have been going downhill slowly for years now, so it is surprising that they chose to diversify in this way. But I guess Quaker State has a place a few blocks down so why not?"}
{"text":"Our party of eight arrived here at 10:30 on a Saturday morning and had no problem with getting a table. We were looking forward to a post-run Bloody Mary and the brunch menu! The drinks hit the spot and were served with a few fun extras - cheese curd, bacon, pickle, blue cheese stuffed olive....as well as the trusty sidecar.  We ordered cheese curds for the table and they were among the best I've had - melt in your mouth delicious.  I ordered the breakfast burrito which was filled with egg, red pepper, a little bacon, Pico de Gallo, and was supposed to be topped with a verde sauce made from braised pork.  The burrito was good - though I don't know if it's just me or what but this was the second burrito I've tried from different places that just wasn't able to be kept warm enough from kitchen to table. I did find one large chunk of pork in the chili verde sauce but that was it; would've like to see more as the flavor was good. I'm not a fan of how Craftsman does their breakfast potatoes - medallions, fried with a spice rub.  These same potatoes made up the hash part of the corned beef hash, and my husband felt the same way about them. Not bad, just didn't feel very complementary to either of the dishes.  I appreciate the multitude of vegetarian options here which makes it a good option for my family. They have a nice beer selection - Zombie Dust was on tap; is everyone still going nuts over this? I feel fortunate to live in a city where there are so many 3-4-5 star places to eat - this is a good meal, it just hasn't particularly stood out any of the times I've gone. Except for those cheese curds this time!"}
{"text":"We just had a really nice experience here with our two little ones.  I had the fish and chips... really liked the fish because it was nicely cooked and not too greasy.  The fries were yummy, but a little heavy on the salt.  I actually even liked the cole slaw and I don't usually eat that.  My husband had the steak special and thought it was \"good\".  Our little girls shared a grilled cheese and that was standard.  Overall, the service was excellent, the food was solid, and we were in and out quickly which is key for us.  Oh, and they have a great beer selection!"}
{"text":"I'm a regular. I almost always sit at the bar and the staff treats me like family. The beer tap list changes at least daily. The food is great pub fare. It's busy most days from 4:30-7:30 so be prepared to wait for a table."}
{"text":"Underwhelmed.  Hostess nice. Bar service mediocre.  Had the fish and chips which were \"ok\" but slaw was awful. Dining alone at bar I guess doesn't get great service, but the bartender was busy. Just \"meh\" overall."}
{"text":"I'm gluten free and our waitress was very helpful selecting a dish when I couldn't decide due to all of the options! When the kitchen delivered my meal with the wrong side (cross contaminated) she rushed to correct the error! Here on Valentine's Day, only waited 20 minutes for a table for brunch, food and drinks were great, and surprise Beero Bingo during Sunday happy hour a delightful surprise!"}
{"text":"Deeeelicious!  First, the upstairs is a pretty cool area to sit and wait for a table. When we arrived we realized we forgot to make reservations (sigh) and were forced to wait around for an hour. But luckily they have a bar and seating area upstairs where you can order drinks and appetizers while you wait! I had wine, my boyfriend had beer and we of course ordered some cheese curds. They are so good, some of the best in Madison! Perfectly seasoned and still gooey inside.  When we were finally seated, I wasn't as hungry as I thought I'd be (probably from eating almost all of the curds) so I ordered a soup and salad combo. You get a lot of food for a cheap price ($6.99). The soup was a creamy tomato soup and the salad is a simple tossed salad with lots of feta. Both were yummy, I really enjoyed the soup though and I could have eaten an entire bowl of it. My boyfriend had the Craftsman burger and really enjoyed it. Service was great, too.  We will be back, next time with reservations!"}
{"text":"So the good: Josh Ruffin is super fun to talk to - you know so many interesting things about beer! I've been reading some beer books and while they are fun and informative, you are more fun and more informative. So maybe write a beer book, m'kay? There are also beer classes which I haven't attended, but what a good idea. The outdoor spaces are excellent. What a lovely porch and rooftop terrace. The cheese curds are really good. (*Whispers*:  Maybe better than Graze).  Now the \"needs improvement\": Your food could be better. The burger had essense of freezer and my risotto was announced as full of vegetables but was sadly not full of vegetables. Let's help keep healthcare costs down, m'kay? Give a girl a little kale.  So the summary is that if you were downtown and I could walk to you, Craftsman, I would drink beer on your porch with the same enthusiasm that I do at the Terrace.  But you are in Middleton, so if I'm going to go, the food better be good and it's not there yet, so you are going to be in trouble."}
{"text":"I went with my friend the other day for lunch. The food was fantastic! The ambiance and the atmosphere was just perfect. Our server was great and the host seated us promptly. Highly recommend!! Can't wait to try their dinner menu!"}
{"text":"This is the second time I have been to craftsman table and tap, and both times have been disappointing.   I made a note to the waiter that my food was undercooked. They brought it back to the kitchen and I am not sure what they did, because they did not cool it any more.   I left without eating it. That being said, the owner was Very very apologetic to the point I felt bad and he gave the meal for free and offered to pay dessert too.   Even with all of that, I did still like the place its a great atmosphere and great menu I think the execution was just wrong. I will go back again to give one last try- I have a feeling it was just a noob in the kitchen because my boyfriend and I ate the curds and a salad and got very sick off of it.   Great beer. Curds are too oily and yuck both times I've been- I think their oil is not hot enough.   Proceed with caution. Order a burger or something basic and I have a feeling you won't go wrong. Steer clear of the teriyaki steak."}
{"text":"Food was OK/Good but the service was terrible.  Fries came out cold but sandwiches were warm and good  We were repeatedly ignored by multiple members of the wait staff.  There were open tables in sight so it was clearly not rush hour.  Our appetizers never came out so I cancelled them when our entrees came.  Waiter seemed be hiding from us as we could never find him to order drinks, appetizer, or ketchup.  I eventually walked to another section of the restaurant to find another waiter who happily and rapidly got us drinks and ketchup.  The two runners who brought us waters and our entrees said they would bring us drinks and appetizers, but were never seen from again  I would never eat here again."}
{"text":"Wow--first I will say our server was great...but that was about it.  Their special was a soft-shell crab BLT...the crab shell was left on and it was like trying to bite thru wax paper...and when 2 of us sent it back because it was completely inedible, the kitchen insisted thats how it's supposed to be made.  Perhaps so, but then they should warn people...we reordered something else, but it took a long time to come.  Their fries were good but the rest of the meal was nothing special.   To top it off they double charged us for the crab BLTs!! Took about 15 min for them to figure out.  The manager never came to talk to us...very disappointing.  Will not go back."}
{"text":"Food was excellent! Service was outstanding! Draft beer and cocktail menu was unique and fun. Friendly, warm and welcoming atmosphere. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"My husband and I really wanted to like this place since it's a Foodfight owned establishment and we love some of their other restaurants. We walked in hoping to sit outside and noticed there were two empty tables in their patio area. We were told it would probably be a 15 minute wait, no problem, so we sat at the bar.   The bar was steady but not packed - there were even some empty stools. There were two bartenders working and we noticed there were quite a few interesting microbrews on tap we wanted to try. However, we sat at the bar for almost 15 minutes and neither bartender ever even came and talked to us. We walked out.  There are a LOT of great restaurants in the Madison area, so Craftsman Table & Tap will need to step up their game big time if they want to stick around."}
{"text":"A little off the beaten path, this pub is a lovely hidden gem. The cheese curds are AWESOME. My faves come from the Great Dane and Old Fashioned, but these are a very close second!   Seating is a little hit and miss. Sometimes you can get seated right away, and sometimes there is an hour wait. There seems to be no rhyme nor reason to this. Of course it's packed on game days, but now and again it's randomly hopping!   Their fries are delightful, with a hint of parm and garlic, and their ranch dressing is delicious.   It's definitely \"just a pub\", there's no secret pull or anything amazingly different, but it's the feeling like you can just relax after a busy day -- no bells and whistles, no frou-frou drinks -- that's what I really like about it. Fantastic place to chill out."}
{"text":"Fan with 4 stars. I've had several lunches here.  Staff is on cue, helpful and down right cheery. The soup and sandwich special is where it is for lunch. Last meal I had an amazing mushroom and ham sandwich with truffle oil.  Soup was tasty, hot and just the right amount.   While the food is always good, I haven't been blown away yet.  Still waiting..."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place. Went on a recommendation from a friend. Great beer selection, though light on stout options. Food was rather good. I did the craftsman burger and sweet potato fries, also tried the butternut squash soup with a maple creme fresche. The bacon on the burger was a bit over done but it had great flavor as a whole. The fries were excellent, especially with their chipotle mayo. The soup was great if not a touch heavy on the maple flavor. Oh, and, I also tried the cheese curds. Great cheese curds!! In my top 2 all time now!  Four stars for this type of an establishment!"}
{"text":"Ridiculously delicious! We opted to dine at the bar rather than wait 45-1hr (arrived just after 6 on a Friday night). We ALL (3) opted for the Craftsman burger and were all very impressed.  Burger was done to perfection,  bacon was somehow better than normal bacon...  The fries were maybe a bit soggy and unseasoned, but still tasty. When I asked for mayo I had a plethora of mayo options...the garlic mayo was amazeballs.  And then I asked to see the dessert menu just to look...but couldn't resist!  Buddy got the root beer float with the house-made maple bacon ice cream and refused to share. I got a scoop of salted caramel ice cream with brownie chunks (also house-made). I winced at the price ($4 for a scoop) but OH MY GOD it was actually worth it.  So good. Will return."}
{"text":"This place was the highlight of my trip! Another person in the hotel had been visiting for a month for Epic training and said this place was her favorite place in town. She was right on the money! Great food, fast and friendly service, and the cheese curds were amazing and the burger was cooked perfectly and the best I've had in recent memory. Sadly this place is in Wisconsin and I am on the east coast."}
{"text":"It's a great place for burgers. Try the truffle aioli !  Only downside is I wish it was bigger for more seating so the wait wasn't as long.  But defiantly worth the wait."}
{"text":"Every time we are back to this place.. They don't disappoint with the sumptuous fried cheese curds. They are so good. I had a falafel sandwich for a change. They were a little dry but the sauce was yum and made up for it. My brother had a blue cheese burger and he loved it. Cooked to perfection he said. A must go if u are craving great American food!!!"}
{"text":"This isn't my favorite place, but I eat here often because it is really good for lunch. They do everything well but nothing great from what I can tell. More of a place to be seen but offer strong food options."}
{"text":"Normally would be a 4* but because of lower ratings want to drive the average up some.  Pesto is amazing and really good beer on tap. Served by knowledgable bartenders."}
{"text":"This place has a nice layout, beautiful outdoor seating and calm inside.  Not too loud atmosphere.  Cool music too!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast here last Saturday... delish! I want even aware they did breakfast... pleasant surprise!"}
{"text":"Had high expectations from the menu descriptions for food fight foodie week...guess they were a little too high. FYI the place doesn't take reservations but you can call in ahead to get your name on the list, which was about an hr wait. My pear & walnut salad was pretty good but my hubby had a hard time finding any clam in his clam chowder. My main course of spinach & chickpea stew had perfectly seasoned, tender chunks of sweet potato however the chickpeas were a little too firm for my taste. The spinach curls seemed undercooked as well. The flavor had a nice balance of acid from the tomatoes with just a hint of smoke & spice; very savory. My husband got the burger and said it was cooked and seasoned perfectly but the bacon and fries were both floppy and left something to be desired.  My seasonal sorbet and his butter pecan creme brûlée were also disappointing. The textures were off on both. My strawberry sorbet had that icy crunch, as if freezer burnt. My husband, a connoisseur of creme brûlée, said the only thing it had going for it was the temperature and flavor combination. He likened the thick, burnt sugar crust to a ceramic tile and said the amount of pecans completely overwhelmed the dish. Also the texture of the creme was somewhat pasty and thick, more like a pumpkin pie than the silky smooth pudding-like consistency he's accustomed to. The bartender's service was fantastic though so no gripes there."}
{"text":"I have been to the Craftsman Table and Tap twice, and both have been very good experiences.  To begin...let's discuss the cheese curds.  I'm wee bit obsessed with cheese curds. I'm making it my mission to try every curd in town.  The curds at Craftsman are one of a kind.  They have some kind of crazy crispy breading that is like none other.  My first bite I was unsure of them. The second bite I was intrigued. The third bite I was excited...they are good. Different, but really good.  Of course I had to take a picture or two of the bucket of curds spilling out onto the plate...like every other person who goes there.  They also have an excellent beer selection, and I appreciated the server's beer suggestion!  The first time I ate there, I ate off the lunch menu, which doesn't have a ton of vegetarian options. I chose the Falafel Pita. I like falafel...but I don't eat it very often, so my standards are probably not all that high.  Personally, I thought it was good with nice fresh vegetables and a good soft pita.  And...it was pretty, which is obviously very important. ;) The second time I chose the quiche of the day which included fresh green beans and tomatoes. This was maybe the third time in my life that I'd ever eaten quiche. I can't say I'm really a quiche fan...but I was trying to be adventurous and try something new.  I don't know that I'd order it again, but that's more my fault than the restaurants. I'm sure to all the quiche lovers out there it would be delectable!  Both times I ate outdoors. The seating area is nice, save the crazy loud trucks going by all the time.  Both times we had friendly, helpful servers. I am excited to go back and try out some more of their vegetarian menu options!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and this place is consistently good.  Today 4 of us came for birthday lunch.  We had the Blue Cheese Burger, Brisket Sandwich, Chicken Salad, and Tuna Melt.  All of our meals were very good. We had the hummus appetizer (could have used a bit more pita), and the cheese curds (which were good but a bit too greasy for my personal taste).  The service was excellent, and pricing is in alignment with the quality.  They were kind enough to give the birthday girl an amazing sundae- maple bacon sundae over a brownie. Yum!"}
{"text":"Visited for my first time last week. When we arrived around 7:30pm we were told there was a 45 minute wait. We chose to have a drink at the bar while waiting for a table. The service was quick and the bartender was very friendly. We ended up only waiting for 30 minutes and were even given a choice of two different areas to sit. I ordered the steak with crab and was pleased with everything. Great service, our waitress was very attentive. Would suggest trying it out if you're on the west side of Madison.  -large bar -plenty of room for large groups -tvs near the bar area -has both booths and tables -street parking"}
{"text":"3rd visit.  Not as good as the other two, because of the service we received from Shandi.   It is surprising too because it wasn't as busy as the other times.  She seemed preoccupied with cleaning duties (at 7pm ... it's not like it was closing time).  The cheese curds are (still) the best of four times we had them at different places in Madison this trip.    I ordered a pot roast that had no flavor.  My coworker who ordered it as well agreed with me; we tried salt and pepper and ended up trying to give it some \"oompf\" with Worcestershire sauce that Shandi brought us from the kitchen once we tackled her when she occasioned by.  The Jury is out for me if I am going to bring someone else here on my next trip.  Madison has too many other places I'd like to try.   Ah... but that roasted brussels sprout salad may make me come back.  And the cheese curds!"}
{"text":"Food is pretty mediocre. The beer is good but when we went, it was very overpriced."}
{"text":"This is my second check-in here, and this was a fabulous visit. The happy hour deal includes apps for $6, and my husband and I really enjoyed the three good-sized smoked salmon cakes that had a lot of great, smoky flavor and were high in salmon and not breading.  I ordered the spinach and chickpea stew - delicious! It was plenty of food and had a good back end kick to it. The price was also impressive because it seems so unusual to find an entree for $11.  The staff was very friendly, too. Casual but attentive (not overly, like some can be), plus they have a room with board games to invite \"campers\" which is appreciated."}
{"text":"7 of us were there on Thursday. The parking can be a challenge. We waited outside for about 30 minutes with drinks as it was busy inside. The hostess and server were very nice. The food was good. I Probably ate too much. :)"}
{"text":"The food is definitely what earned them their 3 stars while their less than ideal service took away two. The hostess was disrespectful to the family in line ahead as it was obvious due to a language barrier the parents didn't understand why they were unable to sit outside. She was then short with us while taking us to our seat. Our waitress was polite but didn't check on us until it was time for the bill. We could have used a water refill and wanted to dessert for the birthday celebration but wasn't offered any. The atmosphere was overall just okay. the brisket mac and cheese was delicious so I will go back and give it another try, could have been just an off night."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now! My favorite dish that I got was the mushroom burger. They have some of the most amazing cheese curds I have ever had. The staff is very friendly. There are outdoor and indoor sitting options. I'm glad I live so close I will definitely go back for a third visit."}
{"text":"The cheese curds are greasy, as most are, but melt in your mouth delicious!  I have not had a fried curd in a while that has the cheese and fried batter equally at the same temperature.   Delicious.  I had the portabella mushroom sandwich. Stay away!  just very bland, my favorite thus far is Babe's.  Mac and cheese side- I agree with another reviewer....no good.   Service was good, bloody marys look good, beer list is nice...If it is on tap, you can sample it...I hear the brisket sandwich is delicious. Id go again. Just not order the same thing.  Menu could be a little more expanded..."}
{"text":"This place is very cozy and clean, and I love going here over my lunch break, as it's not too far from my office. I am normally not one to get any kind of burger other than beef, but you MUST try the walnut burger. I now no longer want any other kind of burger. It's delicious. Try a tap beer with your meal, they have great options. The ambiance is nice for an upscale bar and grille."}
{"text":"They've really improved things in the kitchen over the years.  The craftsman salad  is one of the best bargains you can find.  The brisket sandwich is good, and the hummus plate is well done, but short on bread.  The curds are fantastic, as others have said, but they are fresh with a simple breaking that works well.  The bartenders are fun and skilled. Beer selection is very good and they keep it interesting.  Wish they mixed in more Belgians, but they do a good job overall."}
{"text":"Great beer selection, the food was good, the price was fair. I'd recommend and would go back."}
{"text":"My boss and I came here for an extremely quick lunch while we were in the area. I was excited because I have heard good things, and I was not disappointed.   We arrived on a Friday around 3 p.m. The place was pretty empty, a few people were at the bar. We had an attentive waitress who was very nice. We both got a half sandwich half soup lunch combo with the portabella sandwich (their daily special) and the broccoli cheese soup. The sandwich was amazing--it was warm and full of flavor with brown bread. The soup was good, but a strange and almost gritty texture. I still liked it though.  The decor here is very chic and very Middleton Hills. I like the Middleton Hills vibe, so this was a fun treat. I would love to come back for brunch or for dinner and drinks."}
{"text":"We were told if you like unique craft beer that this is place to come locally.  Our sources were correct.  They had 20 beers on tap maybe.... but these were not just your normal beers you find at every resturant.  So I was super excited to see that selection.  They also had a great bottled beer menu. This alone just won me over as a new customer.   The buisness itself is located in a cool complex style building stuck right in the middle of the community in Middleton, WI.  It is a newer, clean, well kept establishment.  Staff were all friendly, smiling, and happy to answer any questions we had.  They even offered up suggestions which should me they knew thier stuff. We did try the cheese curds that the bartendar reccomended to us.  They were delicous tasting and homemade.  The batter was wonderful!  You have to try these!  They came with a really good tasting garlic aioli sauce of some sort.  I will try thier food next visit.  It all looked and smelled really good as the sandwiches past us by at the bar.  This visit was strictly meant for drinking....  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent cheese curds. People told me they were the best around, but I was skeptical. Turns out they really are the best! I was there for a work function, so the other food was a little hurried to get it all out at the same time, but it was still pretty tasty!"}
{"text":"Craftsman Table and Tap is set in a quaint little neighborhood in Middleton. You may be asking...is it worth the drive...yes it is. My husband and I attended an event there recently, we loved our experience.   The staff went above and beyond to provide good service. They were knowledgeable about the menu and the food. We had an opportunity to meet one of the chefs. He had paired food and drink combos that went together very well; items I would have never thought of putting together.   Two words...beet salad! Beet Salad served with a strawberry balsamic reduction over champaign...I could have stopped right there and been satisfied all night!   Cheese curds... the best I've ever had...brisket...all worth trying. For an appetizer try the hummus platter. The hummus is creamy and paired with a great selection of sides.   If the weather is nice, aim for sitting on the upstairs outside deck. You can even play life size Jenga up there. :)   Overall, a fantastic experience! My husband and I will be on the look out for babysitters as to enjoy another night at the Craftsman Table and Tap."}
{"text":"I found the food at Craft Table & Tap a 3 at best. I went for Friday night fish. The fish was coated with a bit too much batter. The fries were soggy, my fiance order a sandwich that had turkey on it. I tried a bite of the sandwich and it was awesome. They have a nice selection of ales. The service was mediocre, our server didn't seem interested in any of her tables. I would go back to sample ales and try a sandwich, however I would not recommend the fish fry."}
{"text":"I had some friends come from out of state that were looking for the  quintessential  Wisconsin experience, but we weren't in the mood to venture far from the west side. So we decided to try Table and Tap for the first time.   Overall, I enjoyed the trip. The atmosphere is great, it feels a bit like an upscale tavern. Our waiter was extremely friendly and informative. The midwest nice definitely surprised my non-Wisconsin friends. We ordered the cheese curds, and I can honestly say they are the best I've had in the Madison area (whatever seasoning is in the breading is stupid good). With a table of 5, we should have had two orders. Everyone liked their main dish, but I must admit there wasn't anything too adventurous to choose from.  It was a good choice to bring my friends for good standard Wisconsin fare. This is the type of place you could bring your parents for dinner and they would love it... in fact, it's probably where I will take mine the next time they come in from out of town."}
{"text":"I've been living in Madison for nearly 3 months now, and while I love 99 percent of everything here, my side of town (west sidddddeee!) is severely lacking in bars. Let me explain. I just moved here from the Bay View area of Milwaukee where I literally had 8-10 bars within a walking distance of less than a mile. And these were nationally ranked bars like Sugar Maple and Burnhearts. So, to move to a quieter part of town with no craft beer bars within 2 miles, well it hurts my beer soaked soul a little.   Thankfully, while not in walking distance, Craftsman has been a go to staple for my husband and I when we need a good beer and great food.  The beer selection is constantly changing and has a wide variety of types and flavors. If you can't find something here, well then you are just too darn picky.   The food too has always been on target. For appetizers, try the hummus plate! I know what you are thinking, really, hummus? BEST HUMMUS PLATE I HAVE EVER TRIED. Two words, pickled onions. Will blow your mind! The veggie burger was quite good and really juicy!  Service has always been very fast and friendly, and the prices are comparable to many restaurants in the area.  Really great, relaxed atmosphere to enjoy a great meal and an even better beer. Cheers!"}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times both for brunch and dinners. I can't say it's in my top favorites, but it's always consistently good. On our last visit I got the Sweet Corn Poblano salad with blackened chicken. It was great, but wished there was a tad more chicken. My husband always gets one of the burgers and loves them. The cheese curds for an appetizer and that dipping sauce is super good!! We love this place for it's convenience and think it's a solid Middleton option. Will for sure always keep going back!"}
{"text":"In terms of food, this place is incredible! When they say that they have the best cheese curds in town, they totally mean it. I love all cheese curds, but some just have too much breading on them. That is not the case for these gooey nuggets of gold. And the ranch sauce that comes with them is like the cherry on top. We have only lived in this area for a little over 2 months and have been to Craftsman three times now. The first time was to try it, second time was for their \"Paws on the Patio\" on Tuesday nights with our dog, and third time was to bring family visiting (so they could try the best cheese curds in town). I gave them 4 stars because the service has only been 'pretty good' each time, not quite matching up with the greatness of their food."}
{"text":"Oh Craftsman, I have begged, begged, begged to come to your restaurant since tasting your foods at my daughter's home in Madison. Last Sunday after I flew in from Los Angeles it did not take my kids too many guesses as to where we should eat. I shared a mushroom burger and a vegetarian sandwich with my daughter, halfsies.  Delicious! The sweet potato fries were among the best. We had some of those Crispin (blackberry I think) hard ciders and whoa! Just great! Sitting outside on the patio and enjoying the super friendly helpful staff was a treat. Going home entirely crashing from the goodness and napping was the only way to go... Back Soon!!"}
{"text":"Great Fried cheese curds! some of the beer on tap was good too like great summit and Belgium Pilsner. It can get a little pricey but the burgers and steak sandwiches are worth it."}
{"text":"Wish the menu was a tad larger. I get the same 3 things. I like them all enough to order them over and over again, but I guess there is not a whole lot of other things I want to order/try. Not been in for a fish fry, but a really good ff is hard to come by. Everyone has cheapened the fish to keep the price \"wisconsin comfortable $\"  Waitstaff is average.   I love love the decor. It's simple and it's clean in there. That is all I care about. Parking is good. Easy to get to."}
{"text":"We came here for their $10 Badger Bus deal, and that worked out great.  A great deal if you are headed to a Badger game.  When we got back the place was very busy (around 4 pm) on a Badger Saturday and service suffered.  They seemed understaffed at that point.  Overall the bus deal is a great thing.  We'll come back for dinner or lunch sometime when it's not game day and see how things go..."}
{"text":"Husband and I have been here a few times since they opened. It's very convenient to us, and a nice change from other bar & grill places that we tend to visit too much (The Vintage Brewing Co, The Great Dane, Old Fashioned, Coopers).   I love the cheese curds. Batter is unique - I'd say I'd put it in my top 5 fried cheese curds in the city of Madison. I think there's some cornmeal going on in there...which imparts a little sweetness. I think it makes them sorta taste like Cheeto's, but better. Which, if you're me, is phenomenal. I do think they're still working out the cook time on these - we've had some batches that are perfectly fried, but the batch this weekend was a little greasy for my taste.  Beer selection is interesting. Beer on tap is NOT limited to WI-based beers which is nice.  I've had the burger, wings, brisket sandwich. Brisket Sandwich was the one that left me going \"OMG\". Burger was perfectly paired with beer and when craving a burger, is a perfectly delicious choice although I don't like their Red Robin-like doneness options of No Pink, Some Pink. Wings were good and meaty, but I wished they were spicier. Mac & cheese did leave a little to be desired.   Prices are pretty reasonable, which is not to surprising given that the menu is mostly sandwiches & salads.   Would like to see desserts. When we first went (first weekend open) they didn't have them yet, and am not sure if they are available now...  We've tried to go on a Friday night but the wait times of 1hr were insane. Saturday or Sunday lunch seems to be optimal for no wait."}
{"text":"So let me tell you little boys and girls a story about the craftsman.  It is mothers day 2016, and I am preparing to get my brunch on.  But not too hard, because sober Samantha said that I had to behave.  So I order a bloody mary, and it comes out in the largest mug I have ever seen - tall, skinny, and beautiful.  However, the bottom of the bloody was warm, and it was not strong enough for my taste.    There was a beer release for the vintage pink IPA, so I requested this as my chaser.  A porter came out, and the waitress assured me that the beer was pink if I held it up in the light - when she realized her mistake she brought over an entire pint.  Then another waitress realized the mistake and brought over a new beer chaser.  All of a sudden, bam! its mothers day, and I have four drinks in front of me.  Sober Samantha was not pleased until after her fourth mimosa - they were bottomless for only 10 bones - what a deal!  The food was amazing - I had a BLT Benedict, which is an amazing eggs Benedict on toasted foccocia with jalapeno aioli.  The breakfast potatoes are on the fringe between very thick pub chips and circular french fries.  Are you wondering whether that is a good thing? Well it is - they rock socks.  I was tricked into feeling like the service was great - pro tip to restaurant owners: It doesn't matter how negligent your waitstaff are, as long as they are trained to apologize in free drinks.  Finally, please remember that rooftop patios are the best kind of patios."}
{"text":"I've been here 4 times now.  5 if you count us walking out the door after being told it would be an hour and 45 minute wait with no bar space to get a drink..... They don't take reservations but I think I overheard the bartender say that they do take call-aheads?!  When you can get a table it is definitely worth it! In the summer they have a small patio which is nice to sit and have some cocktails with brunch.  They have a very tasty Bloody Mary and a DIY Mimosa kit that comes with a lovely picnic basket full of one bottle of champagne and three small carafes of different juices.  Their cheese curds are melt-in-your-mouth delicious!  Their half sandwich and soup combo at lunch is quick and delicious with the sandwich option rotating daily. You can get full service at the bar if the restaurant is too busy.  The half hummus plate is a perfect light lunch especially if you pair it with a shared cheese curd order!!"}
{"text":"I'm going through a BLT phase right now. Don't you judge me!    I stopped in for a bite for lunch and ordered the Tuscan chicken BLT with a side of greens. The sandwich consists of grilled chicken, applewood smoked bacon, Swiss cheese, lettuce, tomato, and pesto mayonnaise served on griddled focaccia.   It was the perfect sandwich! Perfect! Absolutely delicious. The mixed greens they served with it were heaping on my plate and tossed with vinaigrette.   I could have ordered any of their shared plates and been happy: the hummus plate, artichoke spinach dip served with pita, the German pretzels  hand rolled in-house, and the Carr valley cheese curds would all have been welcome at my table.   Plenty to eat, plenty to dream about, like their open face meatloaf melt!! **drools** or what about their beef and wild mushroom stew?!   I'm a fan. This is comfort food.   Also, also I should add that my waitress was totally on point, just genuinely sweet, and efficient, quick, and aware of the fact that the lunch crowd on a weekday usually needs to be in and out quickly.   Great service, food, and atmosphere."}
{"text":"This joint is your perennial gastropub...in a suburb.  Warm and welcoming decor, friendly staff, and tasty food and beverage.  The go-to here - and the reason why I visited - was the cheese curds.  I've tried at least 5 pub curds in the Madison area and these are by far the most special to date.  They seem to be prepared in a light bread coating - possibly using Fat Tire - which turns into deliciousness.  I recommend waiting 3 minutes before biting in to let them solidify to the desired 'squeak' factor.  Only minor ding is this place has a bit of an upscale chain vibe and the patio seating isn't that relaxing near a busy road..."}
{"text":"Got the craft burger and the cheese curds. Food was good. Wait staff was attentive and friendly. I would definitely make a trip back here."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I went on a Friday night and we were big fans! Our burgers were fantastic, the fries were good and the beer was great! The service was friendly and quick considering how busy they were, the atmosphere was nice, and the drink menu was great!"}
{"text":"Hands down best cheese curds in the Madison area! The Craftsman burger is my go to entree item. Burger, cheese, bacon, garlic mayo what's not to love?!? My only complaint is that it's served on a rather non-descript sesame seed bun. A nice burger bun or hard roll from one of the local bakeries like Clasen's or Madison Sourdough would be a lovely change. Plan to share dessert. The portions are huge. Highly suggest the banana caramel bread pudding!"}
{"text":"I'm kind of surprised that, after many visits to Craftsman Table & Tap, I haven't written a review until now.  I've been a fan since they opened - how could I not be a fan with their impressive tap list - and they've also been the starting point & destination of our cycling club's Tuesday night rides.    First, let's talk taps.  Over 20 beers between the downstairs and upstairs bars, with a lot of rotation, but some that will make their home for a while.  I've *really* liked this aspect of their beer menu - it's great to have a choice of something new or an old favorite.  Wisconsin and other great Midwest brews are well represented (Toppling Goliath was very present this summer), but they bring in great beers from all over, including imports.  Lagunitas Undercover Investigation Shutdown Ale and I became very good friends this year!  They're also doing a lot of cool tap takeovers (folks from a featured brewery come in and \"take over\" all or many of the taps for a night.  Great chance to try some rare or limited release beers) and beer dinners.    The food, I'd call it gastropub fare (not sure if that narrows things down much...) is delicious and the variety runs from casual (it's a great place for a burger and fries) to more upscale, dinner-date type of items.  One of my very favorite meals in Madison is their pulled pork bahn mi sandwich, served with either fries or greens, depending on your mood.  Like the beer list, there are staples, and rotating dishes.    Craftsman's cheese curds deserve special mention, and are on my (and many of my friends') short lists of best curds in town.  I'm too noncommittal to name a single favorite of anything, but these very well may own that slot for me when it comes to cheese curds.  The staff and service are excellent and the servers & bar staff really add to the fun of a visit.  The one time we had an issue (just kind of a Murphy's Law of restaurants thing), I brought it up and they were super responsive - truly one of those cases where I was more impressed with them than if there hadn't been an issue at all.    Tip:  Go on a Sunday afternoon.  The Packers will be on, and they have Beer-o Bingo!  This is as much or more fun than it sounds, and you may walk away with a coupon for an order of curds and a token for a draft beer or a Bloody Mary!"}
{"text":"currently here. Joyless bartender and seriously overcooked eggs and incinerated chicken fried steak."}
{"text":"I enjoy coming here for lunch and brunch. When I come for lunch I always get the pear and walnut salad with chicken. I think it's wonderful. I've had the beef brisket sandwich and porta Bella both yummy. When I come for brunch usually a Bloody Mary, perfect spice and all the good stuff ( bacon, pickle, cheese curd, olive, celery, lemon lime, asparagus) I eat the biscuits and gravy Benedict so good! Biscuit is soft. I love the potatoes it comes with. The mimosa kit is really fun too!  Staff is great. I like the bartender Alex and the manager with the red hair is very nice! All the servers have been good! Hope you enjoy it as much as I do"}
{"text":"Craftsman has good food, great beer, superb events, and the best cheese curds in Dane County I've had.  The wait for a table can be a bit long and wait service a bit slow because of how full it gets & smaller size, and that's really the only downside.  Sit back and relax with a beer from their amazing tap selection while you wait for a table, and you will be perfectly happy as I am.   Besides the cheese curds, okay maybe rivaling the cheese curds, are the beer-based events, like Tap Takeovers, Beerologies, and the Middleton Beer Fest.  These are superbly run by Liz and Mari, cover a wide range of topics and beer styles, so if the event one week doesn't trip your trigger, the next one likely will. These are so good, and if you are a local beer lover, you should definitely get to Craftsman for them."}
{"text":"Been here 2 times and I must say love the atmosphere, not many place that aren't downtown near state street give off this vibe. Ive had the hummus platter which was huge (meant to be an app but i wanted something light) made for great leftovers though. Last visit I had the brisket sandwich, BEST I have ever had, the juices and cheese they used were so yummy. My boyfriend got a salad both times nothing special or out of the ordinary, wasn't a big fan of the soup both times we got it and the drinks are on the pricey-er side but that wasn't a problem for us. The outdoor seating is an awesome feature too!"}
{"text":"We dined there yesterday (Friday) evening with a couple of friends.   The weather was nice so we waited for an outdoor table.   It worked out well for us. The beer menu wasn't quite current as I found that my first 2 choices were not available.   But I found something else satisfactory. Our waiter was new (2nd day) but was courteous and seemed to be well trained though not well informed.   By this I mean that he was unaware of offerings that were not available.   It wasn't a big deal for us.    The couple we were with both ordered the fish and chips (Friday night of course) and enjoyed them.   No complaints! My wife and I both had salads though she enhanced hers with the addition of brussel sprouts.   Both salads were good. It was a satisfactory evening.   I can't say it's a 4 star yet but would return hoping to make that judgment!"}
{"text":"It was decent. There was a large group of us. Our waiter was friendly. I had a brisket sandwich that was good. Everyone else liked their dish. My MIL felt her food was salty.   Issue, everyone who ordered fries had cold fries come out. We told our waiter, we got fresh hot fries, and s couple of desserts were comped! Our server kept apologizing, but t it wasn't his fault!  I also like the beer and spirits menu. I'd go back! Oh, also, I liked the atmosphere. Casual, trendy, fun."}
{"text":"A local friend suggested we start our day at Craftsman, as she had been to several restaurants in the same group and found them all to be pretty tasty. She was not wrong. They have a nice beer selection with a good variety of local beers.  We started out with the pretzels, which were good but nothing special. I feel like if pretzels are something common in your town, you really have to do something to make them stand out a bit--these were pretty simple.   I ordered the bahn mi sandwich, and it was delicious. I'm not a big sandwich person (I leave that to the hubs), but if I had to pick a sandwich to convert me, this is a contender. Soft bread, slightly spicy mayo, and flavorful meats and vegetables. It's not really a bahn mi, so if you're a traditionalist, you might want to skip this one. The cheese curds I ordered as my side were crispy, creamy, and had the right amount of squeak. The hubs ordered the biscuits and gravy benedict, which he said was delicious. They come with skillet potatoes which basically look like thick potato chips. Salty and slightly crispy on the outside, smooth and creamy on the inside.  After we had finished our meal, someone came by and let us know that beer bingo would be starting soon. Beer bingo? I love beer bingo! We hung out for a bit, played a few rounds, and had a couple more brews before we decided to head out. There are beers and gear available as prizes (I won a beer for knowing the answer to a trivia question!).  Do it. Go play beer bingo!"}
{"text":"Came here based on Yelp reviews that the cheese curds were awesome and all previous reviews were on point - some of the best cheese curds I've had since moving to Madison and a very unique sauce to dip them in, it was almost a garlic ranch. The service was fantastic, he was prompt and friendly with decent beer knowledge. The beer taps were all unique and there was a large variety of them, so craft beer drinkers should be able to find something that they like. We all ordered from the sandwich menu as no one in our group was a big brunch person, and the consensus was that the food was decent quality. I had the chicken sandwich, my husband had the brisket, and my dad had the Craftsman Burger. We all walked away satisfied and full! The atmosphere was nice but casual, would be a good place to spend a happy hour with friends during the week!"}
{"text":"Cheese curds, cheese curds, cheese curds. Get them! If you don't like them, I'll refund your money. Well, no--but I'll finish them for you.   These are the BEST I've had--surpassing the Old Fashioned's. Yep, I threw down!  Sadly, the two sandwiches(reuben--not on the menu any longer, and the roasted veggie) I've had there have been decent, but not a re-order item. I really like the feel inside, and I think it's a good place for a group. Sort of Great Dane-ish, but a little more upscale, with about half the menu(not a bad thing).   They have decent outdoor seating, and I'm looking forward to trying brunch. Service has been friendly, albeit slow.   But...the cheese curds!"}
{"text":"We were in the neighborhood last weekend and thought to stop in for a quick bite to hold us over until dinner.  We opted for the hand rolled pretzels along with the large hummus plate.  True to it's name, the hummus plate had a good selection to choose from-feta, olives, roasted peppers, pickled red onions, hummus, and pita bread.  I will say the portion sizes were somewhat confusing as we had a boatload of olives yet the hummus was fairly small in comparison.  While everything was ok. special shout out for the pickled onions.  While they were on the verge of being too \"cinnamony\", they were definitely some of the best I ever had.  The pretzels were somewhat disappointing.  Flavorwise, they were on point yet they came out without almost no salt on the surface.  No idea why and the waitress was confused as well.  Disappointed that she didn't offer to bring us a replacement.  The beers on tap are fine but would like to see a broader more unique selection.  Pretty sure they have the same basic taps from the last time I visited (which was a while ago).  Besides the service misstep, our server was friendly and quick with service.  As we live downtown, don't think we would ever make a planned trip to eat here but if in the neighborhood under similar circumstances, I would consider stopping in."}
{"text":"The cheese curds are their go to item.   Solid menu and a very good ever changing beer list.   The beer and drinks are a bit pricier than they should be.   The bar staff gets a 5 star!"}
{"text":"Had the mushroom and Swiss burger today and fries, the wife had the Tuscan chicken sandwich. Both were excellent, I really like their food we have been there for lunch often and have always had quick polite service and excellent food. Great beer selection as well."}
{"text":"Came at the recommendation of a colleague and Craftsman lived up to my expectations in every way.  Our waitress was fantastic - told us right away that she had one other table which was a very large party helping set the tone for the pace of things.  We were there to relax and take our time - reassured her - and then she managed to balance both us and her other table fantastically.  Cheese curds were great - Churrasco wrap was fantastic and flavorful - beers were never empty (they had Great Lakes on draft!!! Swoon!) and overall just a great meal.  Everyone was so friendly and accommodating despite being a bit busy - great staff and leadership at this restaurant."}
{"text":"I love this place for a few very solid reasons. 1-the food and drinks are tasty 2-everyone who works there is friendly and 3-I had a 30 person wedding reception in the private room upstairs and the whole experience was delightful. Nick S., the GM and chef, was amazing. We underestimated both our food and cake (brought in from Clasens) orders, which was 100% our fault, and he replenished our stock quickly and seamlessly- he came back to cut the top tier of cake that we planned to save. We also had an amazing bartender (I forgot his name) who made a mean old fashioned and somehow kept up with our boozehound guests. I would HIGHLY recommend Craftsman for events and can't say enough about the atmosphere the staff helped us create."}
{"text":"Vast beer selection, rotating options. Bartenders highly attentive. Hot curds are a must have. Recommend portobello mushroom sandwich (It's juicy!) and brussel sprout salad (Well seasoned!)."}
{"text":"This place is run by the same people who run DLUX and Cooper's Tavern and you should expect similar quality. I guess I would call it halfway decent rustic American fare. It is a great place to go if you don't feel like getting out of your comfort zone, you're party is large, or you are out with your picky bitch of a roommate for whom even the distant rumor of spice is off-putting. They keep the inside kinda cold for my tastes so if it is a nice day I sit outside, they have a lot of seating out there. I like the brisket sandwich"}
{"text":"Just ate here again.  We live so close it's hard to avoid.  Somehow the food just keeps getting worse.  Kids meals are inexpensive, but a clear step down from culvers.  I just don't understand why food fight doesn't put more effort into this restaurant.  It'd be packed if it was anywhere near decent."}
{"text":"Here's hoping there are still kinks being worked out.  I really, really WANTED to like this place. It looks great on paper- locally sourced food, tight menu, good drink selection, close to my neighborhood, food fight affiliated... I was even willing to give it the lovable-enough-because-it's-closeby handicap.   But.... this is weird. Somehow they are able to make all of their food without flavors. I KNOW!  My husband and I went on a Saturday, mid-afternoon, so we were able to be seated right away. Our server was super nice (though he kept calling my husband \"brother\", which made me think of Desmond from Lost) and the food was delivered quickly. We had the cheese curds based on Yelp reviews. I am a cheese curd fan. I even like bad cheese curds, because hey, cheese curds. These are not top 5 in Madison quality. They want to be, but they were greasy (not in a good way), and yes, FLAVORLESS. How do they do it?!!?! The presentation in the bucket was super cute though. Props to that. And there seemed to be some promise in the breading.  I had the Italian grilled cheese, which I regretted ordering after I ate too many greasy cheese curds. The sandwich was ok- the tomatoes had good balsamic flavor, and the bread was good. The fries were super boring and wilted. My husband had the BBQ pork sandwich... and had to ask for a side of BBQ sauce because there wasn't any on it? He had the greens for a side, which were fine but a little over dressed. We didn't finish more than half our plates, and didn't bother taking the leftovers.  Oh, I almost forgot- I also had a bloody mary. I swear they have some kind of flavor-extracting device in the back. How do you make a bland bloody mary?!? (Just in case you are starting to doubt my tastebuds, my husband agreed that it was bland! We really like food!)  I didn't want to write you a bad review, Craft! I'm not sure the food is enough to bring us back, but the impressive beer list and that rooftop bar might be awfully appealing come summer. Hopefully they'll find their spice rack by then."}
{"text":"Best. Cheesecurds. Ever.  I agree these are some strong words, but they are fantastic.  The curds themselves are local, and the breading tastes like fish fry batter. They have a nice beer selection, as well.  On one occasion I ordered an asian salad that ended up being a bit too vinegary for my taste, but they more than compensated and our waitress (Cait) was fantastic! I try to make a point to get to the north/west side of town just so I can stop by and grab some curds."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place. We stopped in on a Thursday for our first try of this promising restaurant and were wowed by the decor. The restaurant was pretty full and we were excited to try out the menu. We were there around 6:30pm and the menu states that Happy Hour goes from 4-7--yippee!  Alas, our waitress told us that the menu was old and that happy hour only goes until 6 now. Ok. Well, water for us. :(  We decided to go forward and try the German soft pretzels and cheese curds. The cheese curds were very good with a light tasty coating. The soft pretzels had very little flavor. They were saved by a tasty beer cheese sauce that was offered as a side. We then chose to order a Craftsman Burger with the sweet potato fries. The burger was ok. Not great. Not awful. Better burger is found at Hubbard Avenue Diner. The sweet potato fries were very fresh, but sadly lacked seasoning. So disappointing. We cut our loses at that point and didn't stay for dessert. We won't be back. There are plenty of better restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"I've now been to Craftsman twice - once for dine-in brunch and once to pick up dinner to go. Both experiences were wonderful.   For brunch service was quick and quiet with a friendly waiter. I had the morning bun french toast and it was perfect for my sweet-leaning breakfast preferences. The caramelized sugar in the bun was delicious, and the rich custard sauce cut the sweetness (but made for an incredibly indulgent dish).   When I went for takeout the other night the bartender who took my order over the phone was funny and accommodating, and the coordination with the kitchen was excellent - I had given him my expected arrival time and they literally delivered my box to the bar as I was walking in the door. I had gone for the brisket melt with fries and I couldn't have been happier.   As a barbecue fan, for me the meat was more reminiscent of pot roast than what I generally think of for brisket, but it hit the spot all the same. The cheese had melted into the meat and the caramelized onions rounded out the flavor. The fries were browned and flavorful, and surprisingly held up despite getting a bit steamed in the to-go container on my drive home from Craftsman.   In addition to the food, the restaurant hits a nice note with its design - it's on Frank Lloyd Wright Avenue and the designers clearly pulled their inspiration from the road's namesake."}
{"text":"Gave it a second try. Their menu has a total of 4 different burgers, and 4 salads. Then there are sandwiches, but no more than 10. And no entrees. Better than the average Middleton tavern, but not what it aspires to be."}
{"text":"Today I gave this place a 2nd chance, my mistake. I ate her a year ago and by far it was simply terrible service. I waited forever after everyone else at my table was served. My server never checked in to see if we were all served and after 15 minutes I had to call over a different sever to ask where my food was and she told me that she would send my server over. She soon returned to tell me that my server was too busy to come back. I complained to the manager and finally, 20 minutes after everyone else at my table was served, I received my order. My server never came back.  I decided to give them another shot today, we sat at the bar to eat in the hope that the service was better. The service was still slow but not terrible. Unfortunately, sitting at the bar for about 40 minutes I got to see the manager, Ashley work along side the bartender. Ashley collected cash, punched in orders, retrieved dirty plates, etc. Not once while I was there did she ever wash her hands. That's not a big deal it that's all you do, but she also prepared several Bloody Mary's  wherein she stuck her filthy, bacteria filled fingers into the jar containing pickled  asparagus and containers filled with pickled mushrooms and raw celery. After witnessing this over and over, as I was leaving I asked her why, especially as a manager would she be potentially sickening her customers with hygiene that if witnessed by the board of health would shut the place down. She said \"I apologize\" but I didn't order a Bloody Mary, she should have apologized to all those that she served that drink and god knows what else so that they may know why they get sick tonight.    It was a disgraceful performance and I will never go back, I strongly suggest that you follow my lead, unless you want to spend some time in an ER."}
{"text":"I love the Craft!  Best cheese curds in town. I'm obsessed with the Bahn Mi sandwich. Josh, the bartender is awesome. Overall, the wait staff is super  friendly. My only suggestion would be to do a little analysis of the beer selection. Seems like the whole draft beer menu is solely focused on hoppy IPA beers most all of the time."}
{"text":"Went there with my husband on Valentine's Day for a quick dinner in the neighborhood.  Hostess told us there was a 45 minute wait for a table so we put our name on the list and sat down at the bar for a drink.  I had a Sidecar and it was really delicious and my husband ordered a beer.  They were out of his first choice (on tap) so that wasn't great since it is his favorite.   The 2 bartenders seemed overwhelmed and could have used a barback to help or some other type of assistance.  The hostess came over after about 15 minutes and told us our table was ready, far faster than anticipated.  Unfortunately, we decided not to stay because we found the menu too limiting for us.  The food being served around us looked very tasty, but was far too unhealthy for our tastes...mostly fried, cheesy, bacon-y or red meat which we don't eat.  We would have stayed if there were even a few entree's on the very limited menu that would have met our dietary need, besides the few salads they had listed...a turkey burger would be great or even a chicken sandwich that didn't have to have every item removed to be remotely healthy.  I enjoyed the atmosphere and think it is a great addition to the area, but if you are looking for anything but basic bar fare elevated to a bit more sophisticated level then it is not for you.  I would go there again to meet for drinks but unless they expand the menu I won't be staying for dinner."}
{"text":"Possibly the best cheese curds I've ever had.  Also great salads and sandwiches!! Casual atmosphere but still a really nice, relaxing and friendly ambiance."}
{"text":"Upon walking in the place is gorgeous! Very clean and decorated nicely.  However, the multiple windows are somewhat of a down fall in late fall.  We froze the entire meal.  We ordered cheese curds and a few craft beers to start, which were great.  The cheese curds melted in my mouth, and were seasoned wonderfully.  That's about as good as the meal got.  I ordered the beat and goat cheese salad.  It arrived without dressing (I had to ask for some) and the beets were canned (not fresh) and not seasoned.  Also my salad came without bread which I thought was strange.  I also ordered their broccoli cheddar soup that had only broccoli flavoring and not a lick of seasoning.  :(. My husband ordered the Craftsman burger which he didn't finish because of the lack of flavor, a salad came with his that was also not dressed (had to ask Again for dressing).    Our waitress was overwhelmed and rushed.  Only briskly stopped by our table not giving my poor grandma enough time to order an appetizer.  :( She was also extremely hard to track down when we needed drink refills.    Overall, if you are looking for a nice meal and great service, there are far better establishments in the great city of Madison.   If you're looking for a place to get a good beer and yummy cheese curds stop here, otherwise don't waste your time.   The 3 stars are for the beer and cheese curds alone!"}
{"text":"Great spot.  Parking a little rough.   But great place to grab a cold one.  Service was timely and we had a large group.   I would go back.   They even had my Hendricks Gin with a cucumber!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent cheese curds- almost at the level to compete with Old Fashioned ;) tuna melts, burgers and salads are never disappointing and I leave with a satisfied tummy and leftovers. Ambience is nice and laid back. There are outdoor and rooftop seating. Service is usually good"}
{"text":"Recently celebrated my birthday here with my family, 9 of us total. They were the third restaurant I called to make a reservation as the other two restaurants wouldn't take reservations and couldn't guarantee we would all be seated together. When I called the woman who answered first advised they don't take reservations. I expressed my frustration and said all I want is to make sure I can be seated with my family on my birthday. She made an exception. Shout out to Riley! Thank you so much!!! You knew it was my birthday; but what you didn't know was that my dog had recently passed away, I was super depressed and didn't want to go out in the first place but was doing so for my family, I was at work crying at my desk before calling because of all this and the frustration with the other two restaurants. Your small kindness was a huge relief to me, and by the end of the night I was feeling better. That being said, everyone loved the food! The cheese curds are the best, the brisket sandwich was tender and delish, the salads fresh and tasty, the burgers juicy, and the Rueben sandwich spot on. I've recommended Craftsman to my friends and co-workers."}
{"text":"Went here Friday night with a group of seven expecting a wait since it's a small-ish place. Waited 1.5 hours for a table, which I would never mind for a good meal. Unfortunately, this was not a good meal. To be fair, the waitstaff is awesome. Very friendly, accommodating, etc. The food is so-so and that's being awfully generous. I love traditional Wisconsin fried-food types of pubs but this was blah. The only thing worse than their over-cooked and bland French Fries was, wait for it, their Mac and Cheese. So sad! Fair selection of liquors at best but a solid selection of beers. Would not return unless I heard they made some fairly significant strides in improvement."}
{"text":"The weekend brunch here is amazing! The Quiche is to die for as are the Biscuits and Gravy! (Awesome Bloody Mary too!)"}
{"text":"The restaurant has a warm and cozy feel when you enter the door. Upscale, but casual. Seems to fit into the Middleton vibe pretty well. We sat at the bar for a casual lunch and beer. Their selection of beers was nice and covered a variety of palates. It's hard to find multiple dark beers on tap at a restaurant and they had three! My brussel sprout salad was really good. It was a nice portion of greens, sprouts, nuts and other mix-ins. The prices were a little higher than expected. We each got a lunch item and 2 beers each and the bill was $55+ for lunch (tip extra). The beers are served in a variety of glasses, so don't expect a pint for the price listed. Some of the beers have high alcohol levels, so do consult the board or the menu for additional details on this too. It's the holiday season and the restaurant was all lit up. It probably looks cool after dark. They do have a variety of seating available and seemed to fill up pretty well over a Monday lunch hour. If you have a larger party (6 or more) you may want to check to see if you need a reservation."}
{"text":"I haven't lived in Madison now for about 5 years so whenever I'm back, I'm excited to meet up with friends at places they like. Usually it works out since Madison has so many fantastic restaurants, but Craftsman....not as much.  I arrived after my friend, who had ordered us the German pretzel for an appetizer. It was pretty good and came with some good brown mustard and some beer cheese sauce.   For the dinner, we both ordered fish fry because I do miss a good WI fish fry every now and again. I was excited, but it just was average. The breading was too thick and crunchy for my taste, the coleslaw too creamy, and the fries were average as well.   Apple crisp for dessert was quite good but overall, just an ok dinner compared with other Madison spots. Maybe I should have had the cheese curds as this seems to be what people have raved about.   With the competition for this type of place in Madison, Craftsman needs to step up its game."}
{"text":"The weather was perfect for dining outside, so we did just that. At 11AM on a Sunday morning, the restaurant was sparsely occupied, and most of the other patrons at brunch were also seated outdoors.  This was our second time at Craftsman in a week, so we were pretty familiar with the menu (a nice variety of bar foods). My friend ordered the Cuban Pork Sandwich with the hand-cut fries, while I got the Craftsman Burger and substituted the hand-cut fries for sweet potato fries. If you are in the market for some protein&carbs, you really can't go wrong with either.   The Craftsman Burger was a basic bacon and cheese burger. I asked for it medium well, and it came out perfectly juicy - I think if I'd gone with medium it would have been a little too undercooked for my liking. I'm a huge fan of sharp cheddar, so I really appreciated that component of the burger as well.   The Cuban Sandwich was delicious as well. They were certainly very generous with the meat and pickles, and I loved the combo of the hot/cold deli meats! :9 I must say that the Craftsman's Cuban is one of the best I've ever had.   The sweet potato fries were another highlight of the meal. If you are already planning on taking the...less healthy route (fries instead of greens), you might as well substitute the regular fries (which looked like strips of fried potato skin) for a mound of sweet potato fries. You will regret it later when you need to loosen your belt by a couple of notches, but it's wellll worth it!                The portions were ridiculously huge and neither the sandwich nor the burger should have been consumed by any one individual, but we were famished so we had an excuse (yea right). A mid-day food coma courtesy of Craftsman was a great way to our Sunday afternoon. (:"}
{"text":"I worked with the general manager, Liz, to get our large group of 15 ladies dinner with Craftsman, and it was wonderful. The food was tasty, our tables were in the middle of the restaurant, and our servers were kind and attentive. I will have to go back, it was great!"}
{"text":"We had the absolute perfect meal here, so either this restaurant is amazing or we got the best items they had to offer. Start with the German pretzels because the beer cheese sauce is TO DYE for.  We split the Brussel sprout salad, so delicious perfect amount of crispy Brussels and candied pecans.  Then we split the chicken sandwich which was good, fries and garlic aioli even better. Perfect amount of food for two. Under $65 with wine, even better!"}
{"text":"Easily on my top five list for fried cheese curds. So oooey-gooey, lightly breaded with a yummy oniony seasoning, and nicely salty. They can get a little greasy, but it's the right kind of greasy. An appetizer easily serves three. Try to polish it off yourself and you'll have cheese-belly. They always have a good tap beer selection for craft beer lovers and discounts on apps during happy hour. The bar seating gets full during prime happy hour, which is frustrating. But the atmosphere is great, and bar service is usually very good."}
{"text":"Came here after doing an online search for restaurants in the area.  I noticed they had a decent beer selection so wanted to give it a go.  It was a nice quiet place (relatively) with quick service. I had the cheese curds as an appetizer with a tasty local beer. I also had the sandwich special with the soup of the day. The sesame tomato soup was unique and tasty... and the sandwich was almost a winner. The contents were tasty but they really failed on the bread. The toasted white bread was no match for this sandwich and was a tad soggy.  A nice hearty bread would have been better. Overall the menu seemed good and the beer selection was pretty decent. I would stop here again when I am in the area."}
{"text":"My husband is in Middleton a couple times a year for conferences so this is our 2nd time eating here. We really enjoy the food and beverage choice. They also have a great happy hour. The atmosphere is very relaxing and they have a couple different dining options (bar, dining room, patio). We have 4 kiddos and they were treated very nicely here. This is quickly becoming one of our go to dinner spots for sure. Great service, great food and a great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"The curds were good for sure. I don't know if they were the best ever but that seems a silly thing to hang your hat on anyway. The space felt like Applebee's 2.0 to me. I'd been wanting to try this place ever since I moved here but now that I have, I doubt I'll be back. I won't actively avoid it, but I won't seek it out either. Nothing special."}
{"text":"We stopped in for brunch on a Saturday morning. The place was pretty empty- there were maybe 2-3 other tables of people in the whole place.  The decor is nice enough- as the name would imply, it is decorated in a craftsman style and accented with various tools and such.  It seems a little out of place in a brand new building in a yuppie neighborhood across from Starbucks, though.  The whole theme would be more believable in old downtown building, but whatever.   Anyway, on to the food. I had the craftsman scramble, which was tasty. It was interesting that instead of shredded or melted cheese, they throw in cheese curds. In an egg scramble? Yes.  And somehow, they worked! The skillet potatoes that came on the side were delicious! Best part of the meal, in my opinion. My husband had panuchos and said it was pretty good and VERY filling. We noticed that they have a happy hour special for teachers, so even though we don't work near Middleton and would never be able to take advantage of it, we certainly love any place that supports teachers!"}
{"text":"Stopped by last week for a late lunch/early dinner. Hummus app was great, as was the blue cheese burger. Wife thoroughly enjoyed the half soup and sandwich special. Very much on par with previous good experiences here."}
{"text":"This place is excellent.  New beers on tap every couple of weeks, great food specials and excellent service.  Highly recommended.    I am especially fond of the brisket sandwich.    Show up early or late if you want a spot at the bar, always very busy between 6 and 8."}
{"text":"Fabulous beer selection. Favorite bartender in all of town!  Good food curds may be my favorite as well."}
{"text":"I REALLY REALLY wish I could rate this a 3.5 stars. Maybe I'm leaning towards a 4.  A recent visit pushed this more up to a 4 but not quite because of their excellent tap list.  Fish fry is good but not outstanding.  On a small note, I noticed that the women's restroom had a sign saying that there was a baby changing station inside. The men's did not.  If this is true and it's not an absolute impossibility of putting a baby changing table in the men's room, Craftsman should establish some parity between the genders when it comes to....unpleasant tasks."}
{"text":"My second time at Craftsman and it did not disappoint! There is plenty of parking outside and lots of seats indoors with a bar area and TVs. In the summer, you can also sit outside on the outdoor patio or on the rooftop patio. We came during happy hour which featured 4$ old fashioned and 4$ Wisconsin drinks. I had the signature Craftsman burger and upgraded cheese curds as my side for an additional 2.99$, which was worth every penny. The food came out very quick. The cheese curds were amazing, melt in your mouth cheese curds, easily top 5 best cheese curds in Madison. The burger was done well and I would definitely recommend it. Perfect place to go to for a meal or to just get drinks and cheese curds with friends!"}
{"text":"Great lunch spot. Tried the German pretzels for an app. The pretzels were good and came with two really good dipping sauces. The beer cheese sauce was delicious.   For the main course, we split the Tuscan chicken sandwich and the Brussels sprout salad. The chicken was a bit dry but everything else with the sandwich was really good. The brussel sprout salad was the best part of the meal. The salad was huge. The Brussels sprouts were cooked perfectly. I'd highly recommend, if you like Brussels sprouts.   Overall, it was a great lunch."}
{"text":"We love this place. Great curds, great drinks, great entrees. We've ordered all sorts of things here and have yet to have a bad meal."}
{"text":"UPDATE::: I gave the place another chance, and though it wasn't mind blowing, I felt it was good and the staff treated me well. I didn't order dessert this time, but the pretzel was quite good,  Creme brulee? More like butterscotch pudding with torched sugar on top, and raw pecans.  The best part was the pecans."}
{"text":"What happened to this place?  I went this past Friday at 8:30pm and it was a ghost town.  What's worse, is that there was a group of four people sitting in a booth a few down from us, and there was actually an employee mopping right by their table!  She actually put the 'Wet Floor' sign right at the end of their table!  WTF?  They were mopping the dining room as if preparing to close (and this was before 9:00pm on a Friday night).  I ordered the Halibut ($18.99) and my wife ordered the Salmon ($14.99).  I knew something was wrong when the waitress came back in about 5 minutes with our entree's.  I could totally tell that they had thrown our food in the microwave!  The fish was dry and rubbery - number one sign.  Then, the waitress didn't even ask us if we wanted another round of drinks.  She just said 'I'll bring your check right out'.  It felt like all the waitresses working were just wanting everyone to leave so they could clean up and go home and it was only 9:00pm by this time.  I remember going here a few years ago and it was packed (I actually had to wait for a table back then).  When you wonder why nobody is at your bar on at prime time on a Friday night, you better look at your staff.  The only reason I give 2 stars is because they do have good beers on tap.  However, you won't find me spending my money here anytime soon."}
{"text":"The meatloaf sandwich with onions was served without the advertised onion rings.  The brisket sandwich was good but needed BBQ sauce instead of catsup.  The three mini burgers are no longer available.  Prices are somewhat high.  Ambience is good.  Service good."}
{"text":"First off, I must say that the cheese curds are excellent and definately in the best of Madison range. However, on our 2 visits there were clearly some problems with the main meal. The corned beef in the reuben, while flavorful, was so tough that once it was bitten into the whole sandwich came apart. The burger was ordered med-rare and came out well done on a bun that was past its prime. Fries were served cold both times and the mac & cheese was flavorless. Our service was flawless, but there needs to be some more attention paid to the food. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Food was excellent as was the service.  It's a wonderful family environment to watch football and basketball."}
{"text":"We had family visiting and took them here for Lunch on Sunday. They have enough space to accommodate big groups which is nice.  We played beer Bingo and had a great time.   They had a nice beer selection. The beer flight is pretty cool because you get to try small glasses of 4 different beers. There happy hour specials were a good deal.  The food is fine/pretty good...nothing spectacular, but nothing wrong with the food. 3 stars is the perfect way to describe it. I was a little disappointed that they were still only serving the Brunch Menu at 2 PM on a Sunday. I was hoping to order an entree, but the selection was limited to breakfast items, salads, and sandwiches.  I'd probably come back here again if I'm looking for a fun place to go for happy hour with a large group, but there are other places I'd rather go for a meal."}
{"text":"I'm giving Craftsman a two star rating. The food is just ok. The French fries are awful.  Yes the cheese curds are good but I've had much better at other restaurants (wendigo, bay 5) in dane county. The wait staff wasn't very personable either the girl who seated us couldn't smile? Our waitress seemed ok in the beginning until the girl I was with found a BUG swimming around in the bottom of her coffee cup! I informed our waitress showed her the bug happily swimming in the cup and she barely apologized. She just got defensive and said something like \"I don't know how this could of happened\" well it did happen! I'm sorry but this kind of attitude is unexceptible to me! She obviously didn't inform anyone either because the manager never came over to apologize which you think would be standard in this situation? She never offered to comp the half drunk coffee either or our meal which I really wasnt looking for but in this case should have been offered. I don't care where the bug came from how it got in the glass or when it got in the glass it was there!! This was before we got our food mind you. So you can imagine how we felt having to eat our food wondering is a bug going to come crawling out of our hamburgers? It seemed like from this point on our waitress just wanted to forget about us. When she brought out our food she asked us if we needed anything else and I said yes I'd like some ketchup please and my friend asked for a glass of water since she no longer had anything to drink because there was a BUG in her coffee!!! She came back to our table about 5 min later empty handed and said \"oh ketchup!\" Then disappeared for another 5 mins?  I want to come back here when I'm in the area because the food is ok except for the fries I'm sure it's probably better then anything else in the area  but I dont know if I can now."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place for breakfast after looking at the menu online.  Don't bother.  We arrived a little after 8:00 a.m. and the man who seated us almost acted surprised we were there.  There was only one other table occupied.  The place was freezing and the music was way too loud.  I ordered corn beef hash.  There is no description on the menu, but when it arrived it consisted of fried potatoes on the bottom of the plate (best part of the breakfast), strips of corn beef layered on top of the potatoes, topped with two eggs.  A biscuit came with it.  I have never seen hash this way.  In fact here is a Wikipedia definition they may want to refer to:  \"Hash is a dish consisting of diced meat, potatoes, and spices that are mixed together and then cooked either alone or with other ingredients such as onions.\"  Although it was not bad tasting, it was not hash.  There is not an option for toast, which I would have preferred to the dry biscuit. Coffee was warm, not hot, and tasted old and bitter.  Before leaving I used the restroom...another huge disappointment.  There was evidence it had not been cleaned from the night before.  Inexcusable!  All in all it was not a good experience and I will not return for dinner."}
{"text":"The restaurant is trying hard but seems to be encountering a bit of issues on several critical areas that are just killing them - the bar tendering and the kitchen help. The drinks were painfully slow in arriving and all the waitress could tell us that the bartender is behind. The appetizer and dinner arrival was much the same in terms of slow arrivals. To make matters worse the wife's dinner order was not submitted. They gave us a freebee but all the wife had mentioned was how hungry she quite a while prior to arrival. I wish them well - great beer selection but food and drink issues at a restaurant are killers and we're not the only ones with this feeling tonight."}
{"text":"When I am in Wisconsin to attend Epic classes, I typically stay in downtown Madison where I have access to great food! This time, I was stuck in Middleton without a car so I was limited to the hotel's shuttle where they will only drive guests within a 5 mile radius. The front desk recommended this place for people looking to eat at a local Wisconsin restaurant. The front desk also recommended their cheese curds, which I am a huge fan of!!   As my group of 4 arrived, we were greeted by a very friendly host. The place was packed, but there was no wait time to be seated. It is located in what looked like a dead plaza. I ordered their Car Valley Cheese Curds, Steak Oscar, and washed it all down with a nice bottle of Sprechier gourmet root beer. The Car Valley Cheese Curds is deep fried with a coat of beer batter. It was amazing! The batter was very crispy and the cheese was gooey. I really enjoyed them with a side of ranch. However, I do believe that the Old Fashioned had better cheese curds. The Steak Oscar was a miss. My entire table ordered this dish and we were not happy. My dish particularly came out warm and overcooked. I asked my steak to be medium-well, but it came out more well done. Also, the steak potatoes fries were all burnt! I couldn't eat them at all cause they were hard. The Sprechier root beer is also recommended. It was sweet and creamy...but not thick.   The staff members were all very nice and took the time to answer any questions. My group shared the cheese curds and we each needed separate itemized receipts. Instead of charging one of us for the cheese curds, she automatically split the price and added 25% of the cost for each of us. How nice is that! She did that without us having to ask for it. That's forward thinking there and I wish other restaurants would do that too. The entire restaurant itself was very nice. Once you walk in, you can tell that it has a nice bar and decorated to celebrate their football team! When I return to Madison, I don't think I'd return to this place. If I am in the area, then I would only have their appetizers and drinks."}
{"text":"Usually decent.   The curds are excellent, but everything else mediocre to just above mediocre.  I do like the ambiance and beer selection.  Got the Brussels sprout salad last time and it was just plain bad.  If I could give 3.5 stars I would.  But since everything on yelp gets easily inflated I always round down.   This place falls into my typical opinion on Foodfight places \"usually good, but never great\". (I do give Cento a nod for being a step-up & I haven't tried Fresco)"}
