{"text":"Yes, they are slow, but the food is cooked to order in a small kitchen!  It's worth the wait......so think about chillin while you wait. If they tried to rush you out to boost their volume, you would be mad about that!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Cajun Yard Dog. Every time I come here, the food is amazing and the service is excellent. Such a cute place to go with friends or family. I love their jalapeno deviled eggs and their bread pudding. OMG best bread pudding ever. I usually get the tabasco strips with mashed potatoes and mac and cheese. I never regret it. Some of the tastiest food in Charlotte, in my opinion."}
{"text":"NOM .COM!!! This place is really really good. I've been coming here for about 10 years, and haven't been disappointed yet. The fried chicken is probably the best chicken I've ever had in my entire life. The place is really small, and there's always a short wait to get in, but it's definitely worth it. Definitely the best Cajun place in the area, and probably one of the best places in general in my opinion."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere 
Jalapeño deviled eggs were an amazing appetizer. We had the shrimp and grits, andoille pasta, and the crab cakes. All were extremely flavorful. We ended with the bananas foster dessert witch was amazing and was devoured  in a manner of a shark feeding frenzy"}
{"text":"This place is well over priced for the service, food and atmosphere. Strike one is that in our visit for our first time was with a large party, and we were initally informed it would possibly be anywhere from an hour or 2 to be seated. The hostess was not willing to truly work at first with us, and made us feel that we were inconviencing her. We nearly left, but we were given the option to be seated in another fashion and we gave it a try. Honestly, the service was poor. Our server didn't smile an inkling, and it felt as though we were somehow an imposition on her. Our food was delivered in a timely manner, but to be frank...the food was average. It tasted good, but it was very laden with oil and the balsamic vinaigrette for the salad is extremely sweet. And something I ate there left me ill by the end of the evening. To top it all off, the decor is extrmely tacky and you could see dust around the restaurant. My husband and I, personally, will not recommend this place to our friends...nor will we be returning."}
{"text":"It's not 100% authentic Cajun but it fulfilled the craving of a La/TX transplant. The fried chicken was incredible and fried to order. Shrimp and grits were very tasty. The only disappointment was the gumbo - good flavor, poor consistency. I will visit again soon."}
{"text":"The Cajun Yard Dog is always good for catfish, blackened salmon & étouffée. Great sides including fried okra, smothered cabbage, grits, Mac & cheese + greens. The restaurant is small so expect a wait until later in the evening. Consistently good!"}
{"text":"I eat here at least once every two weeks for one dish and one dish only, a bowl of seafood gumbo! I'm from the south and have tasted some good homemade gumbo, but this is some of the best I've had in a restaurant. Huge shrimp top it all off and the seafood in it is a meal all by itself! 

It's not on the menu though so ask for it by name but I guarantee you'll be as pleasantly surprised as I was. I gave it 4 stars because a friend of mine recently came with and tried the Ceasar salad, chicken gumbo side, and red beans n rice side. He said the salad was amazing but bigger than he thought and the sides just tasted ok. 

I can ONLY vouch for the seafood gumbo."}
{"text":"Love it! The service is always great the food is even better! There is a wait sometimes, but it's definitely worth it! The people are nice a really homie place!"}
{"text":"Everything is made from scratch from the appetizers to the desserts and everything is to die for. The fried oysters were fantastic even for those who don't usually like oysters. Everything fried was delicious, the crust is just perfect. The grilled fish was also very flavorful and fresh. 

Beyond the food, our server was incredibly nice and helpful. You can tell that everyone who works there loves it too and wants you to enjoy your meal as much as possible. The line is always out the door at peak times and for obvious reasons. If you are trying to avoid the line, coming early is always a good idea."}
{"text":"Geesch, where can you stop by for the BEST shrimp/grits, collards, and ice cold beer??? The Cajun Yard Dog. This place will not disappoint. Ask for Alexandria too. She was very informative/helpful. Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Horrible! We waited a really long time to be seated, then waited a really long time to be served. I ordered the special skirt steak which was so overdone it was like rubber. It had no taste or seasonings at all! My husbands chicken cordon bleu was horrible as well. The roumalaude sauce was ketchup mixed with horseradish...have these people even been to New Orleans! Very expensive for quality and quantity! Will not be returning!"}
{"text":"Family vacation to visit friends who now live in NC. We are all originally from NOLA and wanted to give this place a try. We were in the mood for home cooking. I have to say they were not bad. The fried chicken was good and they do something really special with their cabbage that I have never seen but made it really good. My girls 7 and 9yrs had the mac n cheese and loved it. The red beans were luck warm when they came to our table and tasted can. The seafood was OK but could use a little more seasoning (you know how we like our seasoning). The service was also good the waitress was very nice."}
{"text":"This was my first time here! I had the FGBLT (blt with fried green tomatoes).  It was delicious! The atmosphere is cozy and fun.  The service was excellent.   The right combo of efficiency and friendly!!  I'm only sad it's not closer to my house."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.  Ask for Jenna to be your server, she's awesome.  I have had the blackened Mahi and Wahoo, both excellent.  My wife gets the jambalaya, which has just enough spice and the seafood in it is delicious.  However, the highlight is the fried okra?!!!  

You must go here and discover this gem in the arboretum..."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant!  We've been coming here for years and have always had a wonderful experience.  I've read some of the other negative reviews and I couldn't disagree more!!!  We are regulars too, but we do not expect special treatment.  Isn't a wait a good sign of a great restaurant with excellent food and terrific service??  

I cannot speak more highly of the food.  I absolutely LOVE their cajun dishes and always end the meal with a dessert (the chocolate/pecan pie is my favorite!).  

I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great meal in an awesome atmosphere."}
{"text":"Fantastic food.  Would definitely come back here next time I am in Matthews.  My grandmother loved it."}
{"text":"We eat here about once a month.  The food is good quality and spiced just right.
The staff is very welcoming and friendly, the owner is always there and very friendly.   Great specials, seafood, meatloaf, mac & cheese, cheese grits,  and veggies, the desserts are the best!!!   Never had a bad meal here."}
{"text":"This place's menu held much promise for me, but was quite a disappointment.  I've only been there once, but there was a common characteristic running through all their food that was hard to ignore...no seasoning!

I love Cajun food, primarily because I enjoy the type of food and the spices.  At CYD, you can find all your favorites on the menu; just don't look for them to be properly seasoned.

Jalepeno Deviled Eggs:  there was an essence of jalapeno but absolutely no kick...and no salt.  Just a bland deviled egg.

Fried Oysters:  A little too greasy and absolutely no seasoning in the batter.  I'll go so far to say that they were the most bland fried oysters I've ever been served.

My sides were \"all day green beans\" (bland), collards (bland), and slaw (bland).

The quality of food was pretty good.  Just don't look for authentic cajun flavor here.  Maybe I hit them on a bad day, but you'd think that I would've liked something here...but not so much.  Seriously...salt, cayenne, and peppers are pretty cheap.  CYD ought to invest five bucks and give these a try."}
{"text":"I consider myself a connoisseur of fried food.  And while that may not strike some people as anything to brag about, Cajun Yard Dog acts as proof that there is a right and a wrong way to fry.  And by God, they do it right.

I could go on for pages about this place, as it's certainly my personal favorite in Charlotte.  But I'll simply mention the sides, service and the beer.

Most entrees are accompanied by 2 sides.  Those sides range from collared greens to sweet potato fries, from gumbo (extra $) to some of the best mac and cheese I've ever eaten.  

The service isn't always fast.  But even someone as picky as I am about service will be pleased by the friendly, knowledgeable waiters. 

The beer selection is pretty phenomenal for a place of this breed.  Lagers, Ambers, Fruit beers (including Purple Haze from Louisiana's Abita) Porters, Stouts,etc.  Basically, even micro brew drinkers can consistently find a beer that they've never tried.  

If you enjoy spicy food, fried food, good food or good beer, do yourself a favor and try Cajun Yard Dog: Charlotte's creole connection."}
{"text":"My dull witted friend suggested we try this place. I agreed only because my planet smashingly hot girlfriend agreed with him for some reason. Usually we know better than to go along with his harebrained schemes.
Ordered apps, catfish bites, fried green tomatoes. Both pretty unremarkable. I don't know when the last time the kitchen changed their frying oil, but  by the taste of it probably about 14 years ago. Green tomatoes were weak at best.
Ordered the jambalaya and it was a mushy practically tasteless mess.
Dumb friend didn't much enjoy his meal, but he's dumb so I don't lend much weight to his dumb opinions...cause he's dumb.
The eye scorching dame I call my girl ordered the fried chicken, tasted like it was fried in ash, And the topper was cold french fries!! Really? Cold french fries, Total bushleague shit CYD.
Won't be back."}
{"text":"We have been going to the Dog since we found it tucked away in Arboretum a few years ago.  Everything is consistently fresh and extremely tasty.  We go for lunch at least once a month on Saturdays and my wife always gets whatever the fresh catch of the day is and it is always wonderful and she can be picky!

We have tried almost everything and it is always great.  Last year, I had all my buddies from the office there to rave reviews.  If you like a bit of spice, ask for the dog sauces...the one with the ghost pepper is fantastic; flavor with good kick.

One thing though...bring back the pulled pork sandwich!!!  That was the bomb!"}
{"text":"We love this place! By our second visit we had met the owner so by our third visit he knew our names. Wait staff and owner did all the could to make sure we enjoyed our meal. Food has been great each time: blackened salmon, shrimp/andouille pasta and the Seafood Jambalaya all were amazing! Def one of our favorites!"}
{"text":"Great little restaurant.  One of the best places in Charlotte.  Been numerous times and never had a bad anything.  Staff is great.  One of the only places I take visitors to Charlotte to eat."}
{"text":"Brought home a 16pc box this evening based on friends' assurances it was some of best in Charlotte. I found the chicken to be devoid of spice and way over cooked.  Maybe they were having an off night, but there is no way that I would order fried chicken here again . However, the collard greens and Mac n cheese were quite good."}
{"text":"Great restaurant for years. We have been hundreds of times. Lately we limited our ordering to fried chicken which remains great.  Other choices have been declining in quality to the point of being sometimes inedible.  We have sent fish back three times in a row.  Veggies watery and overcooked except the greens which have gone from sublime to tasting like cardboard.  You have to beg for the included biscuits and pay a dollar for honey.  Waits for tables are always long and even regulars are ignored when there are open tables at busy times.  Last night we planned as usual to arrive before the rush at 5:45 so we could dine in time to reach a movie.  Two tables for 4 were open when our friends arrived and they asked to be seated.  The hostess was rude and nasty saying they would have to wait until we all were there.  We were late by 5 minutes because of a call about our mother from the rest home she just moved to.  They complained and asked the manger to seat them explaining their predicament.  They got the last table for 4 and the gruff hostess knowing we were soon arriving promptly ripped the additional two chairs from the table even though there was no one waiting at that minute for these two chairs without a table.  Knowing this would not work,our friends left.  On the way out,the father of the hostess who has to our knowledge no association with the restaurant flipped off our friend and his wife and told him to, \"get a life di..head\".  At which point our friend appropriately dropped the f bomb toward this sicko.  When I arrived and was told of what happened by our friends wife, I asked to meet with the owner,Ron Atherton, who told us the hostess was simply following policy. He called our friends liars even though i didn't tell him what they said. I told him it was a stupid policy and that it was now our policy not to dine there again despite being regulars for years,essentially since the day it opened.  Will miss the chicken but not the rest of the crap.  There is always New South in the same center, always great with the nicest owners in the world and the fantastic Table274 in Cotswald to replace this tired old dive with a rude owner."}
{"text":"This spot is FOR REAL. I've been up and down this menu and have yet to find something I don't like. The service has always been good, and Al (the owner) is always present and asking how everything is. Great local spot, and true New Orleans flavor!!"}
{"text":"Sorry, this place doesn't get it. I went two years ago and it was ok but this week it was C- at best. The catfish was greasy and the oysters were soggy. Must have changed hands recently."}
{"text":"Been here a few times in the past since the \"new\" ownership took over a few years ago.  Hadn't been there for a while... decided to return with the family for dinner.  I was SHOCKED to see how much the prices had risen.  I've worked in several professional kitchens.  I understand food costs, profit margins, etc.  Trust me, WAY overpriced.  Needless to say, I was disappointed.  I gathered the family and left as soon as I saw the menu...something I've never done.  Like I said, the food's alright.  I respect the individual restaurateur, usually some of the hardest working people you'll meet.  But, I work hard for my money too.  CYD, you're gonna have to do better than that."}
{"text":"Cajun - Smajun - this place rocks!  Cabbage is to die for!  Quirky wines and unknown beers are there for the adventurous.  Lynn is a hoot - ask her for beets next time you are in (inside joke).  Their pimento cheese could bring world peace!  A must try but an even bigger repeat performance restaurant - eat here regularly and have never had anything but the best!"}
{"text":"Great food (blackened red fish was AMAZING), and excellent service. Fun for the whole family. Definitely going back!!!"}
{"text":"First time here. Surprised by the quality of our lunch. Staff very friendly. Chicken waffles great. Mix of Cajun and southern foods. We all enjoyed the food and experience. I'll be back for the shrimp and grits next time."}
{"text":"I love this spot. Great food and service. Specials everyday [maybe weekdays only?]
Plenty of room. Recommend"}
{"text":"Celebrated New Years with some close friends and wanted to brag about what a great experience we had. Our Server Lynn, was very friendly and knowledgeable. She made great recommendations. We all had different plates from fried chicken, Blacken Mahi Mahi and the Spicy Cajun Jambalaya. Great Food, Great Service and nicely priced."}
{"text":"The service was really good as our server was attentive and prompt. My date was pleasantly surprised by how delicious his fried was."}
{"text":"I had a seafood craving and did my Yelp research on this place.  It was seat yourself and it took a bit to get anyone to the table even though the dining area was almost empty, so of course I'm sititing there freaking out wondering if this was a good idea while checking out the distressed walls, some TVs, and a non-overpowering Mardi Gras theme.  Not sure what was my apprehension because I was overwhelmingly pleased with Everything!
I had to try one of everything, but settled on the shrimp platter, meatloaf po boy, etouffee, and seafood jambalaya.  Like I said, everything was good, but let's focus on the that meatloaf.
My sons have never had a real po boy, which in my experience has always been a battered fried seafood.  I asked our server her recommendation and she \"promised\" the meatloaf version would be worth it.  Oh, if I could eat one of these every day!!! 
I'm also a beer girl and had a little bit of trouble navigating the list, as it was just the labels and not the style of beer, but again my knowedgable server was able to assist.  I had a refreshing german pilsner while waiting for the food to arrive but switched to a New Orleans Dixie lager with the remainder of our meal.  I liked it so much I went to the store and bought a sixer!  
The staff was so nice! The food - I guarantee (I hope you read that in your best Justin Wilson voice)
 And Get There EARLY because by the time we finished this place was packed and a line was going out the door!"}
{"text":"Great fried chicken.  Crispy and not greasy -- perfectly cooked.  The sides are good, but not great.  I agree with another reviewer about the green beans -- they're ok but they put some ingredient in there that isn't quite right -- maybe sugar???

The etoufee is also very good.  Lesser favorites are the blackened meatloaf and the chicken cordon bleu.

Great comfort food and great, friendly service."}
{"text":"Lynn was our server and she was terrific. This was our first time to Cajun Yard Dog and it was a great experience. The chicken & seafood jambalaya was delicious and filling. The fried chicken was so delicious too.  Mac n' cheese makes a great side. If you get a dessert, try the bread pudding (so good). Great atmosphere and great people add to the wonderful experience at Cajun Yard Dog."}
{"text":"Change of ownership.   Maybe I caught them on a bad day.  They were having air conditioning issues and the restaurant was hot.  Most of the former employees were gone.  The food seemed to have dropped a notch in quality.  I will give them one more try."}
{"text":"Perfect joint if you're looking for a truely SOUTHERN REDNECK HANGOUT where the regular patrons are loud, rude, and vulgar. The wait staff have grungy fingers and hair and like to chat rather than wait tables. So if you have time to spare and don't mind redneck gawking as a past time, feel free to stand around and wait while the \"regulars\" drink, swear, and watch tv.
Why would anyone ever eat here?!
BTW - Lying about the number of stars is the only way to prevent honest negative reviews from becoming buried in cyberspace."}
{"text":"One of the worst meals I have ever eaten. We usually go to the Cajun Queen, but some friends wanted to try this place. I ordered the shrimp étouffée since I normally get the barbecue shrimp dinner or étouffée at the Queen and figured that would be a good pick. When it came out, it looked like can gravy was just poured all over the dish. That's pretty much what it tasted too...no spice, no flavor just blah. This was the first time I had to get something to eat after going to a restaurant. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"We have been to the other location at the arboretum and loved it.  Food is wonderful but the service was sloppy.  I'm hoping it's because they have only been open a few weeks and it will get better.  Check it out if you and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"When first going to the Cajun Yard dog, I thought that it was fantastic. I continued to go and notice that there was an inconsistency with the food; one day its good the next  day not so much. I notice especially with the side dishes, the collard greens are ALWAYS overcooked, the macaroni and cheese is always a different consistency.  When they fry things it's never cooked all the way though there are always uncooked parts of the batter that they use and on top of that they are moderately expensive for inconsistent food. I have decided its best that we part ways. Oh and the management is rude and never speaks to anyone. I will NOT be going back!"}
{"text":"This place is too good not to shout about.  We waited about 20 minutes on Friday night around 5:50 for a table at this adorable restaurant that makes you feel like you are part of the family. Sat at the bar with friendly bartender, Graham seated us and consistently checked on us throughout the meal.  Lynn was our server, this woman works hard but still has time to talk to the regulars and make first timers feel welcome.  Then there is the food, the food is really good.  We started with the fried mushrooms and BBQ shrimp and grits.  The biggest, most delicate mushrooms we have ever had, accompanied with a homemade horseradish sauce.  The shrimp and grits were also amazing, we had to take over half of it home, because the portion was big.  We ordered the Crawfish Etouffee, the sauce was fantastic, the rice perfect (I prefer Crawfish when in season March - June) I think shrimp would have been a better choice, however my companion loved it.   The Chicken Cordon Bleu, was great.  Light crispy fried chicken, with Swiss, ham, and a sauce that was out of this world good.  I believe the owner/manager stopped to talk to everyone in the place, including us and was extremely friendly and bragged about the generous portions.  We will be enjoying our leftovers for lunch today and then hitting the gym to work it all off.  This is a great, casual, family dining place.  No frills, no pretension, just a Big Easy kind of place to grab great meal with great people."}
{"text":"We actually have a real cajun yard dog, and even she wouldn't eat the leftovers. Seriously, some of the worst cajun food on the planet. I've tried cajun food in many different cities and this stuff is bottom of the barrel, especially at these prices. 

If you like bland overcooked under-spiced cajun food, this is THE place to eat. I tried the Jambalaya. It came out mushy, very bland and had a strange orange-ish hue. Folks, Jambalaya is a dirty rice dish..Not supposed to be mushy, orange and certainly not bland.  

Charlotte needs a real cajun restaurant. So far all the available choices are underwhelming."}
{"text":"Brought my family here last week after finally choosing this place for my birthday night. Wow it impressed us. My dad loved his fried catfish strips, my mom ordered some fried oysters that were also delicious. The chicken my sister ordered came out fried to perfection. My girlfriend cleaned her plate of Blackened salmon and collared greens so I'm sure that was pretty good too! My meal, the seafood jambalaya, was just awesome. A big helping of crawfish, shrimp, chicken sausage, and mussels mixed together in Cajun rice was enough to fill any man up. The mac and cheese I chose as a side was good and deffinitely made from scratch. At the end of the meal the kind hostess offered us a free dessert to try and I chose the banana foster. It was tasty but a little runny. Not gunna complain though much, it was free! We all really enjoyed our meals and deffinitely will be back!"}
{"text":"I really like this place, we were in North Carolina for a couple of days and wanted to find a southern ma' and pop' kind of place and this was exactly what we were looking for. Low prices and large delicious portions. Great find for us."}
{"text":"I love the theme of the restaurant, super cute. It's was lunch time, so it was a little wait, about ten minutes which wasn't bad. I had the chicken and seafood jambalaya with the smothered cabbage. It was amazing. I never had cheese in my cabbage, but it was surprisingly good. For desert I ordered the bread pudding with a side of ice cream. Amazing!!!!!!!! I will definitely be back to visit."}
{"text":"I grew up in Southern Louisiana so I have had a few authentic Cajun meals in my day.  By far, CYD has the best Gumbo in the City and I have tried most places that offer Gumbo.  When I say best, it's the closest to the dark roux southern Louisiana gumbo I remember.  The red beans and rice are good and the etouffee is excellent.  Prices are moderate.  From reading some of the reviews, it seems prices are being compared with McDonalds.  No they don't have a dollar menu.  Try Burger King."}
{"text":"Always ggreat!!  too small location so wait line can be long.  Been going to CYD for 13 years."}
{"text":"Ate at this restaurant and had the Po Boy fried shrimp sandwich with sweet potato fries. The sandwich lacked flavor and the sweet potato fries looked dehydrated, and tasted disgusting.  Did not live up to my expectations. Waste of money and will not be returning."}
{"text":"Waste our money. First the house style chips came to the table burn.  That should have been I clue to leave but we decided to stick it out and hope thing would improve; boy where we wrong. The food was BAD all around. My wife is from New Orleans so we know how the food should taste.  This place doesn't rate a one star. About the only item I would give just an OK to, is the shrimp and grits.  Dine at your risk. You been warned."}
{"text":"We truly enjoyed the food. We had oyster Po boy, Salmon, mahi mahi, étouffée and all of the meals were good. The dessert was kind of fun too beccause they had an eggnog pound cake. It's a casual restaurant with really good food and lots of options."}
{"text":"Pros - Red beans and rice, shrimp po' boy, fried okra, bread pudding, and RED OAK beer. 

Cons - Really bad live music.

Solid little joint serving good food and cold beer. Service has always been good as well."}
{"text":"Love it.  Fried Chicken, Mac/Cheese, Red Beans and Rice are wonderful.  Tough to get in.  Wish the restaurant was bigger!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. We tried deviled eggs, Tobasco chicken, potato salad, coleslaw, jambalaya, grits. Shrimps were a little oily. The lemon pound cake was to die for!! On the whole a most satisfying meal for my kids & parents."}
{"text":"Easily my family's favorite restaurant to go to in Charlotte. Family's been weekly regulars for the better part of the last decade. I always try to hit the Dog when I'm town.

Everything I've ordered on the menu has been fantastic."}
{"text":"Being that I am from Louisiana... it was nice to finally get some Cajun food home away from home.

The food was OK, it isn't the BEST tasting cajun food. The food was a bit bland, but OK.

I loved their chocolate pecan pie! - I dont really like far stretched sweets... I like my sweets simple, but the pie was good!

The place was also a bit pricey for that little food but great customer service! Very sweet people and atmosphere. I'll come back for their live band on weekends!"}
{"text":"Wow! Wow! Wow! So Amazing! Best Fried Chicken Ever! Best Service Ever! We love the food and the staff are always so friendly,respectful and helpful! 
A++++!!! Yum!"}
{"text":"I can't believe it took me so long to give this place a try but omg! Everything I've tried since has been great but the fried chicken is some of the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"This place is about as authentic as you can get to New Orleans. It doesn't try to live up to its atmosphere. I can't tell if the people who own the place used to live in New Orleans, but they do act as if they do. I really hate to say that I believe that the place is authentic, as that its decorated with a few beads, and a \"burbon street sign.\" However, the beer lights are authentic [had the new orleans feathers], and the LSU flags were dead on.  Given that it was authentic, the food and service is not fast. I'm not sure if its because the kitchen is slow or if they are meticulous. 

The food is simple. The place was packed [at lunch on a Monday]. The food had a small kick to it. The prices do seem a little high, but the portions are large. If you get a poboy, there will be a lot on your plate, enough for more than one meal. Additionally, given a no/low carb diet, you can ask for the rice&beans to be without the rice. Awesome! This place is comparable to my diet, close to where I work and live, and is close to average for a decent plate of food. I'm sold!

I had the catfish, and I liked it. I dinned with family members [who had never had Cajun food before] and they liked it as well.

Lastly: The TVs. Typically I abhor a television at a restaurant, but the sound was muted   and it didn't really take away from the atmosphere. People were happy to be here, liked the food, and were happy to be around each other."}
{"text":"We have been there a few times. It's one of those things that it's hard to find LA Cajun style food in this area. I find that this place is a hit and miss. The fish was under cooked this time, but it was seasoned well. The big problem that I had was that they charged for refill on sauces. Really? If it was outstanding, wouldn't mind paying those prices. So, we will keep searching for that delish Cajun seafood."}
{"text":"It is what it is I guess. I rolled with it all till the end but If you don't mind being rushed to order by a no patience, rather be somewhere else waitress(which you  have empathy with at first)  who brings you food and forks but no napkins and then seater who points out the  $18.00 dish he brought you is missing its side and he will bring it later but never does, and no ever comes and checks on you (so you never have a chance to remind anyone) and then this hurry up waitress leaves you waiting ten minutes for the to go box never asking how the meal was, then you catch the seater walking by  as we were putting the food in the to go box and let him know that he forgot our side,  his response was a glib  non apologetic do want some to go, I said hell no, now its about me saying \"hell no\" vs the bad service we received, i quickly apologized to the guy so I wouldn't have to smack him. then waited another 15 minutes for my credit card back. Food was ok, some sides were cold, don't know if they were meant to be(rice and beans-maybe?) So go there if you don't mind there expectation of you being an efficient customer(because they are busy), than receive inefficient service with cold overpriced missing food."}
{"text":"In Charlotte for a conference and wanted to try something different outside of the hotel. Service was great, food was good. The fried chicken was definitely on point and was some of the best I ever had, even me being from L.A.!  I really was craving jambalaya, but found theirs to be too wet and too salty for my taste. Mac n cheese was pretty flavorless, greens were good."}
{"text":"Best Po Boy in Charlotte, excellent catfish and sides also.

Awesome food, this is a hidden diamond

A punch and lots of flavor"}
{"text":"One of my very favorite restaurants. Good food, friendly people, excellent service. Haven't had anything on the menu I didn't like and I've tried a lot of the menu!"}
{"text":"Yum. Our fav restaurant in Charlotte, now in Fort Mill!  Maybe not as much character as the original location, but I'll settle for close to home and much more space. 

In our first visit to this location, we had great service and great food. What more could you ask for?  The manager/owner came around to check on tables which is a dying art in restaurants today. 

They always have wonderful specials, so definitely ask your server. And order the mac n cheese. Best in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"First off, I'm not going to enter into a debate about authenticity.  Authentic to what?  To how your mom, your grandma, his grandma, my grandma makes it?  If you travel to New Orleans (or Rome, or Paris, or Hong Kong) you will find \"authentic\" food prepared hundreds of different ways.  

So, who cares?  Does the food taste good? That's what I care about and the food at the Cajun Yard Dog tastes good!

The restaurant is small and feels like the kind of place where after you visit a few times the wait staff gets to know you and you become a friend.  I love that.  The food (appetizer and entrees) arrived quickly, were correct and were delicious.  The waitress was friendly and kept our drinks filled.  She smiled pleasantly at our kids dropping noodles and fries on the floor.  She was a winner:)

All the items we ordered were great.  I am pretty sensitive to spicy food and my Shrimp and Grits were not spicy at all.  I realize that most expect food at Cajun establishments to be spicy.  If you like yours spicy, I am sure they will adjust the heat.  The mac n' cheese was so awesome.  I cannot imagine the calorie content, but it was stellar.

Personally, I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Authentic Cajun cuisine. Great atmosphere and great food. I went on a Monday night and watched the place fill up, I can't imagine what a Friday night looks like."}
{"text":"Love this joint in the Arboretum, uber casual eatery where you can count on a good po' boy NoLa style anyday. A favorite for a lazy Saturday lunch for us, a seat yourself kinda place most days, with a fair selection of microbrews for a place so small. Hot sauces abound at the bar (past what's on your table already), just ask the bartender to pass one over to you! Mac and Cheese side....yum! And plenty of other sides (lots like Okra, collards....) to choose from. The Gumbo the last time we were there? Delicious! This is a favorite of ours, make it one of yours too (just don't go when we need a table- ha!)"}
{"text":"My very first visit to Cajun Yard Dog occurred soon after I returned to Charlotte, NC after a year in Miami, FL in 2005/2006. The eclectic decor was charming, definitely a conversation starter, like a visual story that got my imagination running.  On my first visit (pre-dinner), there was NO WAIT!!!  I sat at the bar even though there were available tables back in the day - the staff swears there are \"No Wait\" times that happen throughout the day currently, but I've never seen it myself :)  I had a glass of wine & the etouffee; I was hooked!!  I've NEVER had a bad meal there, not one single time!  As a matter of fact, the food is ALWAYS INCREDIBLE!!  Cooked and prepared to perfection consistently and with fresh ingredients - this applies to everything I've personally tried on the menu (to include specials on the board); appetizers, fish, sides & DESSERTS!!!  Anything fish at Cajun Yard Dog is my favorite...fried, blackened or grilled.  To date I haven't had a bad fish experience there & honestly I think that speaks volumes!!  On our most recent (but definitely not last) visit there about a week ago, I had the catfish bites, my partner had the trout and our guest (out of town from Ohio) had the redfish - ALL THREE DISHES WERE SCRUMPTIOUS!!!  We split a HEALTHY sized portion of Peach Cobbler that was \"right out of the oven\" and it was mouth wateringly divine!!!  Mind you, I haven't tried EVERYTHING on the menu, but I've probably come close after patronizing this restaurant for 9 years. 

For me and my partner, we choose to return to a restaurant because the food is amazing, but I must say the gang at Cajun Yard Dog is FANTASTIC, too and you'll want to come back to visit with them just as much as coming back for a delicious meal!!  Chances are you might find yourself soon conversing about kids going off to college with the wait staff after a few visits!!

I've read a few reviews here today about Cajun Yard Dog and frankly was a tad bit surprised about how some people make it personal; one claiming it was a redneck hangout, a few reviewers felt the need to point out the staffs hair (something along the lines of not being perfectly in place), fingers or they way the staff appears as if they want to be somewhere else.  I've worked in the food service industry - it's a demanding job and all I have to say about that is \"THANK YOU STAFF\" for working your butts off and making this NON-CHAIN, NONCONFORMING little slice of yummy paradise a gem!!!  I don't give a damn if your hair isn't perfect and though you didn't expect to have to work 4 or more doubles/split shifts in a row...you did anyway and not only did you do it, but you were AWESOME while doing it!!!  Hell, I KNOW I secretly daydream of being off in a place far, far away from reality at times - sometimes I even dared to daydream while I was at WORK (especially if I'm having a crap week).  I think it's pretty hilarious, too, that a restaurant would be judged / rated on whether or not they serve alcohol; I go to a restaurant to eat, not to have a \"Hurricane\" frou-frou drink. 

Cajun Yard Dog is UNIQUE and is NOT your typical pretentious / \"Charlotte-Stepford Style\" / let's keep up with Jones' / where to be seen local \"hot spot for the minute\" kind of place - THANK GOODNESS!!!  Cajun Yard Dog has substance, heart & soul - the quality of the food and the staff sees to that.  Guess that's why they've been around a while!!

Already dreaming of our next visit :)"}
{"text":"I almost don't want to write this review because I want to keep it a secret. This place is a hidden gem in south Charlotte. You cannot go wrong with anything you order but a few of the must try items are the blackened meatloaf, chicken cordon blue and gumbo. They have a great portion sizes. Unless you go really early or really late you will have to wait for a table but it is work the wait."}
{"text":"Amazing. This place rocked. Definitely fair priced and everything was cooked perfectly"}
{"text":"We have been in Charlotte just over 2 years and love to try new restaurants every time we go out but we love CYD and go frequently enough that we have become recognized regulars by Keith, the best server ever!  Between the food and Keith's fun serving style, it's easily our favorite spot in the area!  Whenever we have visitors, CYD is always on the list of things to show them, and have yet to have anyone not love it!  The shrimp and grits, jambalaya and mac and cheese are amazing! The owner always makes the rounds checking on each table which is a nice personal touch.  The decor is fun Mardi Gras style.  It's not a fancy spot but if you're looking for good food, fun servers and fun atmosphere, you absolutely can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate at Cajun Yard Dog for the first time tonight. We thoroughly enjoyed the food, and the service was excellent. The owner or manager ( he sounded like a true Ragin' Cajun'!) checked on us several times while we were eating. My husband had the Shrimp Ettoufe with mac and cheese, and was very happy with the entire meal. I had the barbeque shrimp (not really barbeque, but in  butter w Cajun seaoning), the smothered cabbage and fried okra. Everything was very tasty. The only reason I did not give the Yard Dog a 5 is because my cabbage was not hot and barely warm. We had the chocolate pecan pie and sweet potato pound cake for dessert- yum for both! Not an inexpensive meal, but a real treat."}
{"text":"I had only eaten at the Arboretum location once and it was excellent. On our only other attempt, we left because the wait was so long. How sweet it is to have them right down the road from us now, with plenty of convenient parking!

Don't recall our waitress's name, but she did a good job without being overbearing. We went before the dinner crowd and were seated immediately.
 
The fried green tomato appetizers were excellent; fresh, crisp and not greasy. I had blackened meatloaf, smashed potatoes, and collard greens. Wife had crab cake, smothered cabbage and mac/cheese. All was excellent, just the way I remembered from the Arboretum location, without the bumper to bumper traffic.

The beer selection was very good, although they had sold out of Dixie Blackened Voodoo. No problem though, as they had a number of very good local and national craft brews to choose from. They had a number of wines to choose from, but I don't know much about wine. 

Ambience was pleasant for a strip mall restaurant which just opened a couple of weeks ago, but we didn't go for ambience, we went for a good, reasonably priced dinner. We were not disappointed."}
{"text":"Awesome crab cakes!!!!  Getting 4 stars only due to a tiny waiting area and a lengthy wait at times. Call ahead"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place, best Cajun food in town. We drive almost 45 minutes to go eat here because it's completely worth it."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that my only reason for giving Cajun Yard Dog 4 out of 5 stars is that they do not offer beignets.  And honestly I have only found one Cajun restaurant, not located in Louisiana, that offered beignets.  I feel like they are a staple of Cajun cuisine.  Ok, rant aside, the restaurant is small, and they do not have a hostess that greets you and takes your name if there is a wait.  When you arrive and walk in there is a yellow pad of paper sitting on an entry table that you add your name to and the number in your party.  It's best to arrive early if you do not want to wait to be seated.  We did not know this when we arrived and there were about six parties ahead of us, however, we chose to wait as our mouths were watering for some Cajun/creole.  And we were so glad we did!  Our waitress was very sweet and attentive.  I ordered the chicken and andouille jambalaya, my husband had the red beans and rice and my father ordered the blackened mahi.  By the time we sat down and ate it was late and the waitress returned to the table to explain that they were out of mahi but could substitute tilapia.  He was not at all disappointed by the substitution.  In addition to our entrees we were each given the option of two sides.  I had the fried okra and the green beans.  The okra was delicious and I assume they must have used the same batter that they use on their fried chicken that all the yelpers talk about.  Delicious.  And the green beans were spot on, cooked perfectly keeping their bright green color while still having a little crunch.  Mixed in with the green beans were slivered almonds, if you have a nut allergy be sure to mention it as it does not indicate that the dish contains nuts on the menu.  The restaurant is decorated with Louisiana flare making you feel like you are in a café on Bourbon Street.  The noise level is high, which is not unexpected given the size.  There is a bar with seating for approximately 9, if you don't care to wait for a table keep an eye open for space at the bar.  The restaurant also offers carry out!  Happy to have found a little slice of Louisiana in Charlotte.  We will surely return."}
{"text":"Love the oyster po-boy and the fried green tomato po-boy! The smothered cabbage is amazing. Great seasonal beers and Abita Turbodog always on tap."}
{"text":"Everything we had was good-jambalaya, po boy and catfish. Service was also prompt and knowledgeable."}
{"text":"Had a great New Orleans theme that matched the theme of their food.  The Crab Cake po boy and shrimp n grits were great.  The place was packed and had maybe 20 tables and a bar area.  We were dissapointed only in we were looking for New Orleans food since my wife is from New Orleans.  The red beans n rice and the gumbo did not pass the test for her.  The cajun spices just were not there.  Great place for a local that just wants to have a nice dinner,  we would have to do take out in the future as there is not enough room to wait outside with a big party if we brought family from out of town."}
{"text":"This place is OUTSTANDING, and Al the owner always takes the time to say hi. My favorite is the 'Shrimp and Andouille Sausage' I add crawfish to it, its off the hook! It's tough not getting the fried catfish or chicken. The only thing wrong with this place is I want to eat it everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"Come start the new year off right with a healthy salad! This one I got topped with jumbo BBQ shrimp and it out if this world!"}
{"text":"Not impressed. Went there for lunch on Saturday with the family based on a recommendation from a friend. We got the jambalaya, the blackened meatloaf, and the shrimp, all of which were disappointing. The food wasn't bad, it just wasn't good and certainly lacked the Cajun feel and spice that we were looking for. I've had better jambalaya from a frozen California Pizza Kitchen bag from the grocery store. Would not recommend!"}
{"text":"The food is alright but they give so little. Had the chicken jambalaya the second time and it was a lot smaller than before. Maybe half the size as before.. we came both lunch times so portions should have been the same."}
{"text":"So excited to see one of our favorite restaurants here in Fort Mill. The food is great just like the other location. However, the service could stand to be improved. We have been here three times and each time we came in service was slow. The last time we came in three people standing behind the bar, three tables needing to be cleaned. We sat down at one table only to realize that it needed to be wiped off also. Thank goodness the food here is so fantastic."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely delicious. I've been many times and have never had a bad experience. The staff is her fun and friendly and the food is absolutely delicious. Make sure to ask for it spicy if you want a little kick!"}
{"text":"We would go to the Arboretum location but it was a little far for us so when we found out they were opening up the Fort Mill location, I was super happy!  We went yo the Fort Mill location hoping it would be as good as their original location and IT WAS!!  I had the Chicken & Seafood Jambalaya and the hubs had Crawfish Etoufee - both delicious.  We finished our meal off with Blueberry & BlackBerry Cobbler.  Happy - happy!!"}
{"text":"We actually traveled like 45 min to eat here.. I'll give it a 2 only bc our fish was hot... nothing to write home about. Overpriced and the sides were baby size. The fry was good on the catfish. Won't be going back.. service wasn't the best either"}
{"text":"Good food, fun New Orleans cajun music playing and attentive service.  All spicy items can be served not blackened, salmon was a good choice.  Fries are not the best, too dark and not crispy, however, mac and cheese spiral noodles were tasty, the greens were spot on almost dare say best ever with bits of bacon and extra fresh and flavorable.  Shrimp combo was delicious, the shrimp was in a golden crisp batter, this will definately be a reason to return.  Several made on site desserts, including bread pudding, chocolate pecan pie and several other temptations."}
{"text":"My husband and I finally tried this place after having it Bookmarked for years. 
I will have to say we were SURPRISED and far from disappointed. I am giving this place a 4 star rating because I personally couldn't eat much as it was still my first trimester of my pregnancy and my tastebuds were off but my husband and I have similar taste so I know that my pregnancy was causing some of my taste to be off plus I was still at the point of not holding food down and just experimenting to see what I can get with. 
We ordered several apps and our server suggested the house made yard sauce which I mixed with the sauce that came with the fried oysters per her suggestion and man did it fix my tastebuds with all the food I ate (yum yummy sauce).
After eating apps my husband noticed a chicken fried over at another table that the man seemed to have inhaled so he asked our server about it and was told that it's their number one seller. My husband immediately ordered it and the server let him know that it would take 20-25 minutes or more as it's cooked fresh and he was okay with that.
The chicken arrived looking so wonderfully crisp and he and my son dived in and ate it down to the bone. My husband says it was the best fried chicken he has had since we moved to NC and he has been talking about returning for a long time now so we may have to make the trip over really soon.
My only hang up about this place is the lack of compassion for those who don't eat pork. I mean I have Louisiana roots and even in Louisiana there are options to not have pork adolli or pork included in gumbo, etoufee, etc.. Those options are limited here as my family are none pork eaters and recently I have become vegetarian20%/Vegan 80% so I'm not sure I'll be able to eat anything here the next visit I'll be there to take pictures of my husband food and take his opinions to heart."}
{"text":"Made Pre call way in advance to get a party Catered...was told call on Wednesday before our Saturday event.
Called on that Wednesday and then was told\" oh we can't do the catering\"
Really left us hanging.
What Losers... Never even think of giving them a big order...you will regret it."}
{"text":"The place is really as good as it gets.  If you like your food a little on the spicy side and enjoy a laid back but cool setting you should give this place a try.  I mean seriously, everything on the menu is fantastic.  They have everything Cajun/creole, from seafood dishes to red beans and rice.  It's a pretty small place so if you have a big group you might want to call ahead, but if you're looking for a nice place to hang out or even a romantic place to take your significant other give this place a try."}
{"text":"Fresh house-made salad dressings, warm and crisp fried oysters, and tasty fish!  The food is fantastic, the atmosphere fun, and the service is friendly.  My friend and I have had 2 fun ladies' lunches here and we will keep coming back.  I bring the little guy and he LOVES the cheesy grits and okra!!!"}
{"text":"Food was good, bartender/owner? was awesome &very helpful .
Haven't gotten a chance to visit New Orleans or Mardi Gras this place is cute and decorated so festive...feel like your there!
Little kick in almost everything but great!
Gumbo full of chicken & some sausage.
Catfish with panko breading tasty.
Okra great, shocked it was frozen!
Jambalaya with chicken & sausage...could use more sausage but yummy.
Mac & cheese creamy good & slight kick.
Red beans & rice awesome!

Bananas foster was perfect!

Will come back, so much more to try!!

Oh only beer & wine  no liquor"}
{"text":"Great food, no matter whatcha get. (Try the smothered cabbage if you haven't yet!!) The staff is always friendly and attentive. Get there early cause it gets packed!"}
{"text":"The blackened meatloaf was very tough and rubbery. My friend ordered oysters (or clams) and was pleased. I've eaten here only about 5 times and the other meals I have had were good. Stay away from the meatloaf though."}
{"text":"Well, first the sanitation rating is 90%. The wait list is sign your self in. Definitely a first. Very friendly casual environment. The tables are so close that the waitress kept bumping me. 

Our waitress was very friendly and engaging. 

Ordered fried green tomatoes for apps. Delish. 

Entree it all went to hell. Ordered the Chicken Cordon Blue. It was more like fried chicken with a slice of ham slapped on top with some kind of cheese corn sauce. It looked and tasted unappealing. The waitress was very accommodating and switched out my meal for seafood gumbo. The seafood was OK but the rioux was salty. 

It was a packed restaurant so obviously, i got the wrong meal! would go back and try something different.

3 stars for the friendly waitress and owner that came around to tables to check on customers."}
{"text":"Possibly the worst service that I've ever had. This used to be one of my favorite restaurants years ago, but what I understand is New Management,and it has gone to the dogs. The last three times I was there I actually got up and left in the middle of my meal. I kept going back because I hoped so much that it was just single bad experience and it would improve. It has not. There are many great restaurants in Charlotte, there is no reason to risk another major disappointment and such absolutely terrible service"}
{"text":"Had lunch Togo there the other day. The portion was good and the homemade sauce was bomb.  I definitely want to bring my family here to dine in for dinner.  The only issue I had was with the soda it was sorta flat.  Other than that I'm glad to have a new place to eat!"}
{"text":"Ate here the other day.  Greeted as soon as I opened the door.   Got a appetizer and a beer.   BBQ shrimp was cooked right and the beer was cold.    Staff is attentive and friendly will be back."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in the Arboretum. Go here regularly for the fresh fish. Lots of sides to choose from- everything is always excellent. Try  and get there early- they fill up fast and the wait can take awhile."}
{"text":"Best place in town to get REAL New Orleans food!! Went to one at Arboretum but happy to have one closer to home. Hubby & I like to stop by for a Blackened Voodoo Lager & a Po Boy. Our server Michael was great."}
{"text":"One of the best places on South charlotte. The blackened meatloaf is awesome . The fried chicken is the best in town!"}
{"text":"Visited Cajun Yard Dog tonight and had a wonderful meal - fried oysters with fries and smothered cabbage. Absolutely delicious! There were five in our party, and the others had fried chicken, catfish, shrimp and grits, and blackened meat loaf topped with shrimp (poor man's surf and turf). Everyone was very pleased with their meals. So happy to have this relatively new place in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Was a great place to go to, but unfortunately, the food has been very inconsistent over our past 4 or 5 visits and the expertise that use to exist at the restaurant has moved on to other establishments.  May go back in a few months to see if they can fix the problems."}
{"text":"I had lots of anticipation coming here, I love Cajun food. Owner and staff were very friendly. However, food came up a little short. It needed more spice and more flaire. The mac n cheese, my bellweather, was tasteless and cold. They salted and chilled my beer glass - not what a craft beer drinker wants. The creole was good, but lacked spice and kick. Shrimp was good. I will try again."}
{"text":"It's been a while since we have been to CYD and boy do I miss this place.  We had the fresh catch of the day;  blackened swordfish and the special entree; 2 salmon/goat cheese grit cakes w/ blackened shrimp.  These 2 meals had awesome flavor and good size portions.  We also chose several side items beets, okra, jalapeño deviled eggs as an appetizer.  We will be back soon."}
{"text":"Ordered the catfish sandwich that was recommended by the waitress and the bread was too thick, the sandwich was dry, The fries were oily as hell and little they look like they were fries remains. What I ever go back? No. The atmosphere was nice but I wouldn't go back...my first time and it wasn't a great experience."}
{"text":"We went here tonight for some po'boys and couldn't be happier with the restaurant.  Service was great, food was just like what we had in Cajun country.  Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"My wife & I have had dinner and drinks here a couple of times and have loved the food. The menu has a nice selection and everything has been great so far."}
{"text":"One of my favorites in Charlotte!  You will find fantastic southern fare and seafood & delicious authentic cajun dishes here.  I never leave disappointed...or without eating way too much.  A few of my favorite dishes: the pimiento cheese and pickled beets appetizer is incredible.  I'd never be one to order pickled beets but they're awesome and the pimiento cheese is perfect.  There are great sandwich selections (shrimp po' boys, catfish, fried chicken ....) but my favorites are the platters.  You'll get a huge helping of your choice of fried oysters, shrimp, chicken, blackened mahi...the list of mouthwatering choices goes on and on...and then you also get a choice of two yummy southern-style sides.  Mac n' cheese, collards, smothered cabbage, sweet potato fries....seriously it will take you a hot minute to decide between all the menu choices.  Lucky for us, there's a pick two platter option if you can't choose between fried oysters and blackened mahi--yes please!  I'm always part of the clean plate club here, so I've only been able to try dessert twice (pretty sure I was pregnant both times!) but no surprise it was amazing.  Loved the bread pudding with bourbon sauce and their pecan pie.

The atmosphere is fun--a small restaurant with tons of New Orleans gear hanging everywhere--beads, alligators, beer signs, etc.  The staff is extremely friendly and helpful.  I've never had to wait more than a few minutes before someone comes over to take drink orders.  There's a good beer selection and a fun bar with sports channels.  Nothing goes better with some friend oysters than a nice cold beer and some SEC football!  There is limited seating, so it can be tough during the busiest dinner hours.  But remember, good things come to those who wait!"}
{"text":"I recently moved to Charlotte from L.A. and was looking for a good spot in my new neighborhood.  My son and I saw the yellow sign and walked in.  This was a month and a half ago.  Since then, we've been back at least 4 times.  I could go every week..but my son wants to \"eat healthy.\"  Yeah...good for you.  The staff is always friendly..personable....with the charm that I didn't find that often at L.A. Restaurants.   

The first meal I had was the fried catfish with jalapeño tartar sauce and greens and potato salad.  Loved the catfish..the greens were pretty good and the salad was okay...a little too much mayo though.  Since then I've had the blackened mahi...it was just okay.  I think it could have used a bit more seasoning.  Every time I've gone, I've seen people eating the fried chicken.  Finally yesterday, I tried it.  I'm a dark meat person.  It was great! I had a leg and a thigh.  The seasoning was just right...the crunch was...crunchy.  I had to tell the waitress how much I enjoyed .  She said they have a to go box.  You can call in advance..it'll take 1/2 hour or so.  Great to know...because I'm always at the Arboretum

I know what I'm doing this Mardi Gras.  They have big Mardi Gras celebration (duh!)..crawfish boil...possible alligator meat.  The waitress said its a busy, fu time. I can't wait. 

One last thing...on our first visit..one of the daily dessert specials was a cobbler...I forget which one.  My son ordered.  It was HUGE!  Big enough for 3-4 people.  I don't like cobbler so it was left to him to try to eat after his meal.  I wish the waiter had told us that it was for sharing.  Needless to say, my son couldn't finish and he's a big 21 year old.  It came with ice cream..so couldn't take home.  

After all is said and done, Cajun Yard Dog is our fav neighborhood place to eat..and will be my go to place for out of town visitors."}
{"text":"The food is really good, esp. the beans & rice. The bread pudding is good & enough for two. The moscato wine is good. My biggest complaint is that one of the female servers always looks as if she'd rather be anywhere but at work. And she always looks that way. She's a long-time employee & if she reads this she knows who she is. Cheer up, you bring people down!"}
{"text":"There are lots of other comments here in reviews that describe the Yard Dog. I've always enjoyed the food here (whether it's \"authentic\" or not). There for a while it was taking too long to be served to make this a lunch spot during work week. But lately, the service has been much faster. We've been able to get in and out in 45-50 minutes. I work nearby and with all of the restaurants in the area this one stays on the list. Get there early (e.g., 11:30) and you'll get a good seat. Wait much longer during the week and it will fill up. Shrimp and Grits are excellent.

I just wish they would bring back the biscuits."}
{"text":"Excellent food!  Tried the blackened meatloaf, crab cakes, and fried green tomatoes. All were very good.  We will be back."}
{"text":"After trying Cajun Yard Dog for the first time yesterday I am even more convinced that I don't love Cajun food. I think I have tried every Cajun food place in Charlotte and each time I leave dissatisfied. Yesterday was no different. I was certainly underwhelmed by the food. 

The atmosphere was cozy and a little over the top tacky but in an entertaining way. My guest and I sat at a corner table. No one puts Baby in a corner! Sorry I just had a Dirty Dancing flashback.  I was fine sitting in the corner. 

We were greeted immediately which was nice and the waitress was more than happy to give us the rundown of the menu and her personal favorites. She did not like the Etoufee. Oh that's not a good sign. My intention was to order the Etoufee. Now what?

I had the Fried Oysters and I will say this, they were probably the BEST Fried Oysters I ever had! The coating was DELISH! Light, crispy and non greasy. I could have pigged out on the oysters alone and would have left very happy. The only problem was there were only 6. I personally would have liked a few extra on the plate. The big disappointment came with the sides. Fried Okra (hello, one of my favorite veggies!) and Red Beans and Rice. Doesn't get anymore Cajun then that. The Okra was over fried and VERY GREASY. Yuck! The Red Beans and Rice was equally disappointing. It was very bland and they were luke warm.  

For what we got I felt the price was high especially for lunch. 6 oysters, Red beans and rice, Fired Okra and a club soda, $15.80 before tip.  A little steep IMO. Throw a dozen oysters on the plate and then I will gladly pay the $$."}
{"text":"Loved the catfish and fried shrimp.  Mac & cheese was like that from the family reunion - so good!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend Cajun Yard Dog. I honestly consider it to be the best Cajun food in charlotte, even better than Cajun queen. The service is very attentive. The menu is authentically Louisiana, complete with abita root beer(the best) and abita beers. The vibe is casual and energetic. I had the fried oyster po boy and it was great! Shrimp and grits were also excellent. I can't wait to come back and try out more of the menu!"}
{"text":"Good, not great. For starters, the place needs some cheer. It is very dark inside and kind of drab. Add some lighting and it would be more inviting. We came for a late lunch and spent $40 easily excluding tip, so a little pricey for lunch.  The okra is very tasty- light and not overly greasy. Kids meal options are slim, but you get good portions. The dessert looked good, but did not want to hit $50 for, again, lunchtime.  Despite our server being over assigned to multiple tables, she did a pretty good job. On a few instances, we had to remind her of a missing item/request. We would go back, but not a weekly type of place for the costs."}
{"text":"Wow great place and a great Cajun vibe. I've only had the shrimp and seafood jambalaya dish, but it was awesome! The only thing is the pricing. The menu that is on here with yelp must be an old one because there is about a $7 difference on site!! I paid roughly $20 for the jambalaya dish!! But great place, only thing negative is it is a little pricy for what you get"}
{"text":"So I decided I would check off one of my bookmarks...Cajun Yard Dog wasn't too far from my location, so I headed over. It's located in Arboretum shops...literally next door to Michael's. The location is small, busy and loaded with aromas. My server Lynne was very friendly and enthusiastic! She talked me into a strawberry Abita (very good) and an appetizer. I have no clue how I agreed to try the deviled eggs, but that menu item was NOT \"eggs-cellent\"! Something's missing from the mixture. There was no flavor and they are just blah on a plate! At least they were cold...I had to chip the ice off! 
I ordered the catch of the day, swai topped with a cream sauce of crawfish and shrimp. My two sides: mac-n-cheese and fried okra.  The fish was cooked perfectly! Very tender and flavorful. The cream sauce was delicious and the shellfish wasn't overcooked. The mac-n-cheese was spiraled pasta, made with a bechemel and cheddar cheese. I could taste the butter in the pasta which makes the flavor pop! The okra was fried crispy just how I like it. I even rolled a few pieces in the cream sauce.  Price wise, you're looking to spend $30 (app, drink & entree).  There's no liquor, just beer and wine. The location is small, so to avoid a wait, go at an off peak time."}
{"text":"I often venture into Arboretum for a range of miscellaneous reasons and one day, I noticed Cajun Yard Dog. What does Cajun Yard Dog even mean? Does it matter? No, not really, but it definitely caught my eye. To me the name said simple, very casual and authentic. I bookmarked it immediately vowed to come back and see how it upholds to my beloved, Cajun Queen.

My cousin was visiting from California and we were yelping through Charlotte trying to figure out where to eat for dinner. I mentioned that I've been meaning to try Cajun Yard Dog just because the name is just so random and cool. That was enough reason for him and let me tell you, BEST life decision ever. We ordered fried oysters, deviled eggs, gumbo, fried green tomatoes, fried chicken, fried fish and much much more. The madness does not stop for fat kids. How do you judge how amazing a place is on the amazingness scale? It is how guilty you feel after every bite yet you still finish every single thing you ordered!

I've been back maybe 10 times since that first visit and Cajun Yard Dog never fails me. If I HAD to recommend a few dishes to you, it would have to be the Crawfish Etoufee, Shrimp & Grits and the Blackened Whatever the Fish of the Day is. I've had the fish of the day three times and every single time, it was AMAZING. Squeeze the slightest bit of lemon on there and viola! PERFECTION. The Crawfish Etoufee is steaming of flavor in every bite and they are mighty generous with the amount of crawfish you get (and for $10!). If you don't get the shrimp & grits, you HAVE to get the cheese grits as a side along with the Green Bean Almondine. No idea what kind of wizardry goes on in the kitchen, but I am beyond addicted to Cajun Yard Dog! The food is amazing. The staff has that southern hospitality that makes you feel just at home and the prices are RIDICULOUS.. ridiculously CHEAP! See this is where I'm conflicted. As much as I love Cajun Queen, the prices are steep! Cajun Yard Dog gives me the authenticity, the quality and the bang for my buck. Let's just say I've cheated on my beloved CQ quite a bit nowadays.

Side note: I recommend going for lunch instead of dinner. The portion sizes between lunch and dinner aren't significantly different, but the prices definitely are! Lunch prices are about $10 or less and dinner prices are close to $20. I have to admit that even though I know this, I still came back for dinner once because I couldn't get the yard dog cravings out of my system and the next day was Sunday (the only day that they're closed)! Not my fault, I was trapped."}
{"text":"This is one of the best spots in town.  The atmosphere is fun and entertaining. 
The staff is friendly and the food is phenomenal!
Tasty doesn't begin to describe it. 

As far as price goes, you'll save a heap and not go home hungry for lunch!
The gumbo is fabulous and the mac and cheese is a definite yum!"}
{"text":"Excellent service.  They gave a sample of the mac n cheese to our daughter to see if she'd like it; we all did.  The nightly special Two Step Bayou over dirty rice was awesome.  We highly recommend Cajun Yard Dog"}
{"text":"Recent open, but not great and pricey 

Bartender seemed engaged, but is poorly trained and no knowledge of the food, heritage, etc

Lots of Hispanics trying to cook Cajun 

Good music"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in town. I always come on a  Saturday and get the chicken & waffles. Well actually I get a double order of chicken. And judging by the reaction of the staff, I'm the only one who orders double. 

In doing so I had the pleasure of meeting and talking to the chief a few times. I will continue to come here for a long time. I couldn't be more pleased with the service and the quality of food. Small restaurant with great staff and spectacular food.

I have also had the fresh mahi one evening, absolutely wonderful as well.

Thanks 
From the Guy who gets double chicken"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this restaurant!! One of my favorite places to eat in SC. There's two locations both have great friendly staff and laid back atmosphere. Good for fresh seafood and craft beers. My go to dishes are the seafood gumbo (which is done the correct way) collards, catfish tenders, and calamari. Huge portions and also a good place to bring the family."}
{"text":"I am still a fan of the Cajun Yard Dog, but on my most recent visit, I did notice a couple of things that have gone downhill...which is why I dropped to 3 stars instead of 4 stars as in my previous review.  

For starters, the place really needs to expand a bit...either with more regular table seating or a bigger bar that will accommodate more people. The wait times are just getting really long based on my last couple of visits. 

Most recently, we arrived between 6-6:15 on a Friday, and had a 45-55 minute wait for a table.  This wouldn't be too terribly bad if there was sufficient room at the bar, or in the \"waiting area\" but neither is the case.   My S.O. had suggested we leave and go somewhere else, but I was really craving some Cajun food.  So he was a good sport, and agreed to wait. 

When we were finally seated, we pretty much knew what we were going to order.  To start, we had an order of calamari.  I would not order this again. Our order was made up of less than 1/2 calamari and the rest was just the breaded fried okra and breaded fried onion. A little of that would be ok, but I would have liked to see more calamari.  On the plus side, I don't normally love rémoulade,  but the stuff they served along with the calamari & okra was very tasty. 

So, for my entrée, I got the usual - shrimp etoufee with fried okra on the side. Usually this is my favorite combination... but honestly, they were just a bit off tonight. 1) If I had known how much fried okra they included in the appetizer, I would have ordered a different side item. 2) the Fried Okra was not as delicious as usual... it was a bit flat - it tasted sort of like the frozen stuff I buy at the grocery store. And 3) my biggest disappointment was my entrée.  Usually, the etoufee is super flavorful, and very generous portion size. This time, my plate was full of rice, but the etoufee itself was a bit on the sparse side and not as flavorful as normal. I hope this is an anomaly, and that next time the quality & quantity is back up to par. 

Our service was a-ok, considering how swamped they were. Oh, and kudos for the beer menu  - they always have a nice selection of different beers on the board."}
{"text":"The hubby and I were searching for a new restaurant to try out for a quick lunch and we ended up at Cajun Yard Dog.  The place is a little small but quaint.  The ambiance was relaxed and casual with a seat yourself approach at the front door.  The menu offered plenty of tasty cajun options including the standard jumbalaya and po' boy sandwiches.  I enjoyed the fact that they had a long list of classic southern sides to choose from on the menu (however corn bread, one of my favorites at cajun restaurants, is not included in this list).  I ordered the pimento grilled cheese sandwich with a side of collard greens.  My meal was delicious.  The pimento cheese had quite a kick to it and my nose was running by the end of the meal.  My husband ordered the seafood jumbalaya.  He's long been in search for the best jumbalaya in Charlotte and has ordered it at several restaurants only to be disappointed.  He actually seemed to enjoy it at this restaurant even though it was served with mussels which is usually outside of his seafood range.  
The service was decent despite the fact that only one waitress was serving the entire restaurant by herself.  I liked that I was able to get a to-go cup for my tea when we were leaving.  It made up for the fact that they didn't offer splenda in their repertoire of sweeteners on the table."}
{"text":"Ok..I am from Charlotte actually Matthews...why in the world I haven't been here before is beyond me. Outstanding crawfish and shrimp pasta. Great craft beer..great service..cool atmosphere. We missed the line at the door but I know why it was there. I will be back many more times with friends. Yahay..for me finding this place! !!"}
{"text":"Finally made it in to Cajun Yard Dog! This place can be a bit tricky with getting a table! Quaint inside, popular for sports fans and great food can pack out the inside in no time flat. My wife and I ventured in for an early-ish dinner on a Saturday night. 

The menu houses a phantasmagorical array of Cajun choices. Etouffe, jambalaya, seafood....all choices apropos for the bayou-seeking culinaries. 

First, we ordered a few drinks and an app. Great beer choices. Red Oak from outside of Greeensboro, and Abita root beer. If you haven't had Abita's root beer, you must. It's incredibly flavorful and not overtly laden with sassafras. The house-made chips are wondrously prepared. A little more done than most, served with herb sour cream and a BBQ cream. The BBQ cream is faint and sweet and the herb is much more pungent.

My wife ordered a menagerie of side items. Veggies, Mac n' cheese, fried okra and jalapeno cheese grits...oh, those grits. They are incredibly creamy and packed with flavor(s). All were fantastic. 

I had the chicken jambalaya. A HEAPING plate of jambalaya packed with chicken, smoked summer sausage, rice, spices and a brilliant sauce. Each bite is packed with that roux-y, tomatoe-y, spicy sauce and the chicken/sausage chunks in each bite are subtle and plentiful. The level of spice is manageable for anyone, in my opinion. Not over the top but definitely enough for you to recognize throughout the meal. There was so much of it, I had to take most of it home!  

Prices are fair and the service was great. Next time, have to try the desserts!

So happy with this quaint, festooned with Mardi Gras accoutrement, Cajun joint! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. My mother in law took me here for lunch one day and I have a seafood allergy, but the staff and cooks took great care of me. They told me the foods that I should stay away from and told me that they would cook my food separately so I wouldn't have a reaction. I know it was hard with all of the seafood but thank you for taking great care of me :) We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Amazing! Tops the two day trip to New Orleans. Catch of the day was swordfish, my wife had that and Tabasco marinated catfish fritters, I had the chicken and seafood jambalaya. Sides were mac and cheese. 
Price was perfect and for the first time I didn't need to season my food no salt or sauces like I normally do. 
Owner was working lunch and I always respect a restaurant that the owner takes pride and works to keep quality and service up. 
Live in Boone NC but will be back!"}
{"text":"We were greeted by a very nice young lady. Service was great! We ordered Shrimp Po boy sandwich. They were ok, not special just ok! My daughter had shrimp etoufe! That was pretty good! So food was ok! But when I go to a restaurant I expect the restrooms to be clean. No paper towels, no hand soap! To me that's disgusting! I could see the kitchen from the restrooms and the kitchen was very dirty! Food all over the floor!"}
{"text":"The prices are a bit high but the food is great. The blackened meatloaf is excellent."}
{"text":"We had dinner here for the first time last night -- and it won't be the last. The fried mushroom starter was delicious -- prepared very well and not greasy. We followed that with the chicken cordon bleu. The chicken was crispy and the sauce was a creamy wonderful surprise. The portion was very generous. We followed with a fabulous blackberry cobbler served with ice cream and whipped cream. From start to finish, the meal was delicious, the service attentive, and the owner went the extra mile to ensure that we were enjoying our meal."}
{"text":"Mm mac and cheese is so delish and creamy. Their jambalaya is great and the service is 8/10."}
{"text":"This was our sixth visit and thought it was time for a review. On previous visits the fish special and sides have been......OUTSTANDING! Last night I enjoyed the Red Fish special. Despite a small portion, the fish was seasoned perfectly, moist and full of flavor. The entree included fried green tomatoes which were crisp and tasty. My other side, the collard greens were.......Amazing! Service was very good, as usual. On previous visits, Etouffee has been inconsistent based on how busy the CYD is on that particular night. When the house is full my four stars can slip to just two. Sides never disappoint with the Jalapeno Deviled Eggs and Smothered Cabbage joining the greens as a must try! Last night, before 6:00, was a five star experience!

1/14/17 Tried the fried chicken and it was some of the best I ever eaten! Crispy and well breaded while remaking very juicy. These guys know what their doing when it come to their chicken! And the side......see the comments above."}
{"text":"This place is enjoyable, but it's not the best cajun food I've ever had. I've been twice and had the shrimp and grits and the catfish po' boy. Both were decent. That's about all I can say about it."}
{"text":"Consistently good food.  I really like the fried chicken. The restaurant is TINY so if there are diners waiting then you may wait for a while."}
{"text":"Food was delicious! I got the chicken and rice jambalaya and macaroni and cheese. Macaroni and cheese was so delicious I got a second order. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Friends introduced us to the yard dog and omg, I am in love.  Amazing food, amazing service, fried green tomatoes were a hit with the hubby who never had them before...the fried catfish is absolutely perfect, beautifly flavorful, and juicy inside with a battered outside which wasn't greedy in the least bit.   The green beans almondine, were to die for.   I could deff see us becoming regulars.  Amazing, absolutely amazing.  Brought me back to time spent in nola"}
{"text":"This place is always amazing. They are always packed so be sure not to come too hungry. The place is pretty small. However, the food is worth the wait. Today I had the fried shrimp and bbq shrimp. It was really good. The cabbage is to die for!

If you are looking for a nice quiet place to have dinner, this is not it. However, if you are looking for good New Orleans food with a loud and fun environment, this is the place. The restaurant is very unique, and the staff are always really friendly.

Also, if you are looking for mixed drinks and a full bar, this is not the place, but if you are looking for really cool beer that you can't find anywhere else and an assortment of wine, this is your place. I absolutely love coming here."}
{"text":"This place could be mistaken for a fried food Louisiana sports bar... But it is much more than that.  This is most likely the best quality food in the area.  The right mix of authentic with their own twist will keep you coming back.

Our Fried catfish bites came out hot, fresh, and perfectly seasoned and prepared.  If you order smashed potatoes ask for the gravy.  I ordered blackened meatloaf which was fantastic, but my wife's shrimp poboy was equally as amazing.  We finished it off with hot blackberry cobbler that was freshly prepared and served with cold vanilla ice cream.  I left uncomfortably full, but every bite was worth it.

Give this place a shot.  You'll have a new favorite."}
{"text":"Cajun food is supposed to be flavorful and spicy right? Well not at Cajun Yard Dog. We tried the étouffée and jambalaya and Neither has much taste to it. Very dumbed down. They are also quite skimpy on the seafood. Service was slow for lunch because it seemed like only one waitress ran the restaurant."}
{"text":"Sean, Brayden and I had a great experience on Sat. for Sean's bday dinner. The small place is in a strip mall, decorated very cute with a Mardi Gras theme, the wait wasn't too bad, but we came early, 6:15pm. Our waitress was very sweet and attentive. She has been there for 14 years! We had the chicken seafood jambalaya with fried okra, fried chicken, smothered cabbage, fried shrimp, and mac n cheese. There wasn't anything that wasn't awesome!! The dog sauce was flavorful and not too spicy. It was great on the fried chicken, but the chicken was so good by itself. Even the blueberry and blackberry cobbler with ice cream was delicious. The chocolate Pecan pie was not as moist as we thought it could be, but it was still delicious. We also bought a tshirt as a souvenir."}
{"text":"Have nothing bad to say... 

The BBQ Shrimp and Grits(Appetizer size) is really enough for one person. I can't imagine what the entree size looks like. Perhaps that's best for 2 people. This dish is similar to the one at Cajun Queen. Its not spicy but the flavor is still on point. The grits were creamy and there was just enough sauce for some bread if needed. Would have liked some more sauce but it's all good. 

The Fried Green Tomatoes are a bit under seasoned. Throw a bit of salt in those bad boys and we're in business. My Homie likened this dish to eggplant Parmesan with some crunch.

The service was top notch. Our waitress was very attentive even checking on us when we were done with our dishes and she collected them. I think the manager or owner (?) came over to make sure everything was okay with our meals. Stellar service... Smiles, patience, attentiveness... These are a few of my favorite things when it comes to service. 

I'll have to come back with the dude to try some of their other tasty dishes."}
{"text":"The shrimp and grits was some of the best I have had! The service was really slow , I sat at the bar on my 1 hr lunch break and got over looked for several min and they were not even busy..but once I did get serviced it was great and I would definitely give them another try!"}
{"text":"I went by the CYD to grab some gumbo to go. Wouldn't you know it, I locked my keys and wallet in my car! While waiting for the locksmith, the owner graciously gave me my gumbo and asked if he could offer me anything else. Totally amazing service, food and a very hands on owner! and if you need a locksmith, call Neil Williams 704-307-8536 at Consolidated Locksmiths. He opened my Mercedes after other professionals said it could not be done without the car \"locking up\"."}
{"text":"Appetizer: Jalapeño pimento cheese
Entree: Fried Catfish
Result: Delicious and unique.
Need somewhere for a fun, unusual night out? Cajun Yard Dog is worth a try. So much better than the same old chain. Staff has always been friendly and attentive. Basically what I'm trying to day is, you could do a lot worse for southern fare."}
{"text":"I ate here the other day and it was amazing!!! We were welcomed as soon as we walked in the door and was seated. The hostess took our drink order immediately and brought over a drink menu when I asked about what specialty drinks they have. All of them were very reasonable priced ($9 or below). I ended up getting the Mardis Rita which was excellent. We ordered the Gumbo as a starter which could also be considered a side for the entrees. The gumbo was so good and some of the best I have had in the Charlotte area. For the entrees we ordered the Fried catfish and shrimp and crawfish etouffee. Both were amazing!! The only issue is the menu did not state you got catfish bites for the entree so it was assumed it would be a filet but it was still so delicious there was no reason to complain.

I will definitely become a regular here even if I just come in for a bowl of Gumbo. Can't wait to return!!"}
{"text":"Last night was our first visit to this Fort Mill based restaurant. I say Fort Mill based because there is the Charlotte location. It was busy but no wait time for a seat when we arrived at 6:30pm. We had really good wait staff. Quay was attentive but not over-bearing. Our meals were very good. My husband and I decided to have gumbo which really was a hearty bowl of soup with mussels on the side as well as shrimp (large and small), chunks of chicken and was delish. We thought it would be a cup of soup so by time we consumed every drop we were full. Our meals were great as we did the pick 2 choices. We both had fried jumbo shrimp and I had crab cake while my husband had catfish. All was good. My husband wasn't a fan of the cole slaw. Wish we had room in our tummies for desert so Quay suggested we start with desert next time :) That's what I'm talking about ... good looking out. We do like to venture to other restaurants for different dining experiences & not because our failure to return is based on bad experience. 

The only critique would be to develop a good cocktail menu with established options. We ordered created cocktails but found them to be OK and as such the 4 stars. 

The team at this restaurant worked well together in providing good service. Location is very close to our home so revisiting in the future is a definite. Maybe 5 stars if the cocktails are on point and the food is consistent. Something to look out for with next visit...."}
{"text":"Wanted to visit this place for a long time. Had the crawfish etoufee with a side of mac n cheese. It was awesome!  Sat at the bar and the lady who waited on me was incredibly attentive and charming. They pride themselves on their selection of hot sauces, but the best on offer is the the one that they make. If you like a little extra spice, ask for the \"dog sauce\".  It's incredible!  Nice people, fast service, great food and friendly employees. It is a great strip mall find."}
{"text":"We had the BBQ Shrimp for an appetizer. They were very good and flavorful. The grits were 2 thumbs up. The tobasco strips were homemade and had a great flavor. The Mac and cheese was exceptional."}
{"text":"If I could I would give these place 3,5 stars but unfortunately I can't so 3 stars will do.
They have a nice decoration that reminds of New Orleans. My husband was raised in New Orleans and he mentioned this place so many times that finally we went check it out.
We were sat right away and our waitress was very sweet. 
Their menu has many options, however it is pretty pricey for the kind of food they serve.
Considering that the place was very busy the food didn't take too long to be served.
The food came and I was kind of disappointed with the amount that was served. We ordered a combo with 3 options (fried shrimp, fried fish and crab cake) we also had two sides, fried okra and cheesy. The food was just okay, nothing to brag about. They also charge fo
With that being said the probability of us going back is very small."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE Cajun Yard Dog! My first time going was a few years ago when I use to live in Charlotte. My boss took me and we liked it so much, we went back with our entire team. So since I was recently in town for CIAA, I met with a former employee there. The food was great - we had the jalapeño devil eggs as an appetizer (perfection), both of us has the crab cakes (delicious - seasoned to perfection...I wish it was bigger tho), and I had a side salad and sweet potato fries. My friend had mac & cheese & cucumber salad. The mac & cheese was so good, we ordered an additional side of it & shared it. The service was okay, but in the waiters defense it was his second or third day. But I have confidence he'll be great going forward. He was kinda cute too . Another great experience and the food was great too. I will definitely be returning again."}
{"text":"What a wonderful meal! I had the Shrimp & Grits with collard....YUMMMM....hubby had catfish....yumm again!  Be sure to sit in Quay's section......she 'da bomb!"}
{"text":"This was our first time visiting the restaurant. We were very please in our selections and was greeted with a welcoming style. The decor is definitely NOLA and my husband and I thought is made us both feel like we were in New Orleans. The food portions are huge and the beer selection was decent. Would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"The MOST amazing find!! Who knew New Orleans was hiding in the Arboretum!! This place is great! The owner Allen has done an amazing job with keeping the food 100% creole and creating a genuinely southern ambiance!! The Etouffe is rich and flavorful, and a good portion. The Collards made my lips smack...if your a soul food officianado you know that means good!!! The potato salad and Mac&cheese were excellent! I've found my new Favorite Place!!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner on a Friday night.  The place is small and was very crowded so we had to wait for probably 30 minutes.  I had heard good things about this place but ultimately ended up leaving disappointed.  He ordered the crab cakes and I had the grilled chicken.  The chicken did have good flavor but it really needed to be charbroiled - I'm not sure how it was prepared but I just left wondering if they had boiled the chicken and then coated it with the seasoning.  I only ate half of my plate because it was very unappealing.  My husband's crabcakes were good - crispy on the outside.  The remoulade was also tasty.  Overall, I thought it was overpriced and underwhelming.  Likely will not be returning."}
{"text":"Awesome authentic NOLA food and atmosphere. I travel to that part of the country and this is as good as it gets. Portions are huge, fresh, and fairly priced. Great local and micro beer selection and tasty desserts. Does get pretty busy on weekends so just be prepared to wait... Fast bartenders make that tolerable! One time had fried green tomatoes that were out of season, but that's the only negative in 10 visits."}
{"text":"Currently sitting in Cajun Yard Dog, I just demolished my seafood jambalaya. It was incredible as always. We are up visiting family and there was no question where we were headed to dinner tonight.

Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"This place is the real deal. The Tabasco strips are unmatched. Excellent beer selection! If you can get in early on a Saturday do yourself a favor and order the chicken and waffles...if they haven't run out yet! I have yet to be disappointed with any dish in this place. My only gripe would be that there isn't a lot of seating, but this kinda adds to the whole atmosphere and gives it a touch of hometown charm. Bravo Folks! Keep doing what you do!"}
{"text":"I know from experience that it's a server's worst nightmare to have a table of 25 be seated!  Our service at the CAJUN YARD DOG was impeccable; the servers were friendly, attentive and knowledgeable.  Our drinks and food arrived in a timely fashion and everything was hot and delicious, with generous portions. Again, that's just short of miraculous when you are talking about a group of this size!  We all were impressed and delighted.  Well done, CAJUN YARD DOG!  Thanks for making this celebration a special night to remember."}
{"text":"Delish!!! Eat here when I am at the Arboretum. If you like Cajun food you will love it"}
{"text":"Listen, the food here is great. The employees very attentive and nice. My problem is the absolutely ridiculous side charges for something that should be a part of the meal. $10.95 for a lunch of meatloaf I can live with, what is a normal side with meatloaf? Why yes mashed potatoes, well if you want that here it's $2.95 extra so now we are at basically $14.00 for lunch. Get my meal and its a little tiny, tiny bowl of potatoes, ugh, ask if I could have some gravy for the potatoes was told sure but thats $1.00 extra. Are  you kidding me. Absolutely crazy. Will certainly reconsider ever going here again. It's like booking an airline flight where you have to pay extra for everything."}
{"text":"Hubby and I have gone here about half a dozen times .  The last visit was not the best... it appeared they were short staffed in the kitchen, so the wait was pretty long. But -- the food was still great.  I gave 4 stars instead of 5 just for that visit.
Other than that -- we have become HUGE fans of this place.  I was a little reluctant to try bc I'm not a huge Cajun fan, but glad we did.  Their specials have always been really good -- especially the pan fried trout with creole andouille and crawfish cream sauce.  They have good selection of fried platter options, including shrimp, oysters, and catfish and their app menu has some great options too.   The owner and staff are all super friendly and very eager to make sure your experience is a great one. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Yuck is all I can say. The service was good but that's where it ended for me. I ordered the hamburger 'Po Boy' style. It was way over cooked (I ordered it medium) and was not juicy whatsoever. The side I ordered was the sweet potato fries. They were overcooked and limp with little flavor. I feel like I totally wasted my money. I won't be back."}
{"text":"This tiny local haunt has been a favorite of mine for years. They're not too many Cajun alternatives South Charlotte. This place is very casual and is typically stuffed at lunch, mostly with loyal regulars. Although not a regular, I do enjoy lunch here every couple of months or so.

I normally choose the mahi, with the mashed potatoes and the collards. Everything is served with their homemade biscuits. The Shrimp Po Boys are also tasty. Service is always reliable and the restaurant consistently reflects pride of ownership."}
{"text":"New location but the same great food. Now CYD has the best Cajun fried chicken in two states

Great location and it's double the size of the CLT location. I hope they open the comedy club next door again and give Fort Mill/Tega Cay a night spot."}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed. They sat us near the back by the men's bathroom and the exit door. Which you could see the staff going out and in taking cigarettes breaks. The smell tells it all. The food isn't Cajun at all...we've been to restaurant that serves real Cajun food and this isn't one of them"}
{"text":"The fried chicken is to die for and the Mac and cheese will make you like your plate. I love finding these little gems in my home town!"}
{"text":"Yay! Cajun Yard Dog is here! Great service and wow what a great job they did remodeling the location. It really makes a difference for the shopping center.

As for the food, it's just what I expected excellent. Clasic Cajun favorites. Things not to skip out on: 
The salad with honey mustard dressing. The honey mustard dressing is a scratch dressing with garlic and a mild chili pepper that give it an excellent flavor almost like a pepper jelly.

The fried catfish- super light and flakey you cannot miss with this.

The fried chicken on the bone. You will have to wait a bit longer but it is very worth while. The chicken is pressure cooked with a unique light flaky batter.

Red beans and rice. My favorite side has a nice flavor and comes with huge chunks of jambalaya sausage on top.

Chocolate pecan pie. Done right. The pecans are chopped which makes for a naturally sweeter pie and they are plentiful. Best pie around!"}
{"text":"Great cajun fried chicken but suuuuch a looooong wait. But all the food is so good here. It's hard for me because I have no patience. I have opentable and I am used to walking in and sitting down, but the food is just so darn good here I give in every time. Hmm. What do I like. Umm. Everything.  But most of all the chicken, the catfish, the fried green tomatoes, the jambalaya. The owner is also omnipresent which shows just how much the place means to her. The desserts are really great too, but you knew that.  I would tell you what time of the day I noticed it was slower, but then it wouldn't be slow at that time anymore now would it? So fend for yourselves!  Just kidding. It seems to be slow around 2pm. When I say a wait I mean 1-2hrs 5-9pm every time I've gone so if you can go at an off time and you have ants in your pants like me do so."}
{"text":"We ordered the deviled eggs, crawfish etouffee, and the chicken jambalaya. 

The deviled eggs were super tasty and had a nice kick from the jalapeno that made for a unique twist on a common dish.

The etouffee was pretty good and had a ton of crawfish but I thought the chicken jambalaya was better.  The macaroni and cheese was out of this world delicious.

Service was friendly and good.  It was definitely a casual restaurant but definitely delicious food."}
{"text":"This cozy lil spot serves up the best New Orleans, Deep South cuisine. My favs are the catfish nuggets- so fresh, crispy and well seasoned, and the smothered cabbage. Yum yum yum . It's not for the fitness faint of heart but super flavorful and satisfying. You can always burn off your calories by walking around the Arboretum!  Staff are friendly and seem to know the regulars. Bar selection good too! Very affordable and healthy portions... Depending on how you look at it lol"}
{"text":"Small and intimate joint with limited seating and a modest beer and wine bar. Everything was on point. The Shrimp and Grits were rich and flavorful, with a hint of beer, jalapeño and Cajun spices. They were complemented by wonderful collard greens and smashed potatoes. No problems, but the portions could have been bigger. Since I live right across the street and expectations were pleasantly exceeded, I'll make it a point to come back."}
{"text":"Exceeded our expectations.  I had the seafood Gumbo and the Shrimp and Crawfish etouffe and it was very flavorful and enough spice to actually taste.  Was a little scared about the atmosphere but it was much more  family friendly than I thought."}
{"text":"Our second time to this location.  Menu and food was great, done right with large portions.  One of us had the fried oysters, the other had the  chicken and seafood jambalaya.  Had a slight mixup in one drink order, but they correctly it immediately.  Very pleased with our meals.
Something struck us as strange, though.  As good as the food is, we did not see many customers at all on a beautiful Saturday evening.  Also, we both felt the staff was almost overly attentive (you don't see that these days!), as if they were trying too hard to please for some reason.  Maybe it's a fluke, but it struck us as unusual.
Overall, great meal and service."}
{"text":"Great Service!  Early dinner here last night... Crawfish Etoufee very good (4.5 yelp stars), Collards (4 stars), Sweet Potato Fries (5 stars Fantastic with a little vinegar on top), Anduole Sausage (3.2 stars) and for Dessert: Chocolate Pecan Pie (3.9 stars)."}
{"text":"If you like New Orleans cuisine you'll love this place. The etouffee is REALLY authentic and tasted delicious. We started with the jalapeño deviled eggs - great flavor. They have a good beer and wine selection. The food was a bit slow to come out but the service was very attentive without being overbearing. We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Loved this place. Will definitely be back when in the Charlotte area. Fried oyster appetizer was fresh and lightly breaded. I had the wahoo (catch of the day) sandwich and it was very good. My husband had the fried chicken which was awesome and a lot of food (it does take extra time to prepare so it's fresh). Great menu wig good options for seafood, Cajun, southern."}
{"text":"Awesome fries green tomatoes and shrimp and grits! The appetizers make a great lunch!"}
{"text":"Really bad experience at the Cajun yard dog.  Salad was warm, soda flat and my meal was room temperature.  I will never go back there again.  After we decided this was not worth it, we went to the Cajun Queen orderd the exact same meal and it was 100 times better.  The service at the yard dog wasn't much better."}
{"text":"Thumbs way up: a variety of Abita to choose from, including root beer for the kiddies.
Thumbs kinda downish: gumbo that smells and tastes like pepper gravy and BBQ shrimp that don't seem BBQ'd at all. More like stirred up in some tomatoes in a pan.
Thumbs really really down: zydeco mardi gras hell atmosphere
I know you are never gonna get real Cajun, Louisiana cooking in the Carolinas or elsewhere, but why? Why is it that even people FROM Louisiana can't open a place in another city and have it be authentic? It's like there is an Authenticity Force Field around south Louisiana. 
I am giving this place 3 stars because of the Abita and the fabulous appetizer called the Calamari Okrachokie (fried okra, calamari and artichokes with a sort of Cane's sauce, if you know what I mean) and the perfectly breaded and fried catfish filet. It's harder than you think to fry stuff in a truly appetizing way. And the very friendly and accommodating staff gets my appreciation as well."}
{"text":"TL;DR version: Food is definitely lacking, but not inedible. Fried catfish appetizer was best. Sauces and Dressings were decent. Blackened fish was inexcusably dry and overcooked.  Banana Foster was good, although the ice cream was noticeably old even after being drenched in cognac sauce. Ambiance was lively and enjoyable. Server (Marc) was knowledgeable, timely, and friendly.  Host (possible owner?) was a total dick.


This was our first ever visit to the CYD.  It was around 7:45 on a Saturday night. We added our name to the legal pad by the door and I asked to see a menu as the host was leading a party to their table. \"Absolutely\" he said, as his eyes pointed towards the floor. No smile. A few minutes later he returned and crossed our name off the list, and asked if we were ready to sit. 

\"Actually, We'd like to see a menu before we make a decision.\" I said. We immediately decided the menu would be acceptable (for the teens, that's why we asked).  Another group of four entered the restaurant. The host sat them ahead of us, then had the audacity to tell me they were there before us. It wasn't a huge deal, as the next  table had just become available, which he explained.  He led us to the still dirty table, and as he was wiping he told us that we could just let him know when the 4th member of our party arrived and he would bring a 4th chair.  I wasn't down with that plan. He wanted us to sit down, but then when our 4th member (who was still in the car) walked in, you want me to get up from my seat, chase you down to ask you for a 4th chair while she just stands there? Don't think so, buddy. So I grabbed an empty chair from the table beside us and pulled it up to our table. \"I have chairs over on that side.\" he tells me. Good. Good for you. Go get it yourself. WTAF?

 Our server was prompt and polite. We enjoyed the beer selection...from the list that the host failed to provide us with. (Can you tell this dude rubbed me the wrong way? Letting it go now ;) We ordered the fried catfish app which was piping hot. There were five pieces. That fifth piece was highly coveted. I had a side salad, which was reasonably fresh. It was a spring mix with shredded carrots, tomato wedges, and sliced cucumbers. No complaints there.

Entrees: Blackened salmon w/horseradish sauce. Sauce and seasoning were satisfying. Salmon was dreadfully overcooked. Regular & Sweet potato fries were both acceptable. Mahi--same issue. Tooo dry. I had the special, which was blackened tuna over dirty rice with a crawfish basil sauce. Tuna was (can you guess? I bet you can guess.) waay overdone! The rice? Tasted like it came right out of a stainless steel 1/9 pan. Definitely not fresh. It wasn't even warm.  I liked the crawfish, though. You might be asking why we did not alert our server to our distaste, especially before writing a less than stellar internet review. That's a fair question, and as shitty as I have made it sound, we ate ALL of our food. 6 hours in the hot sun at a Rugby tournament, and you too would eat whatever was set before you in its entirety. The food wasn't THAT bad, but it was unequivocally unimpressive. Except the Banana Foster. That gets a solid thumbs up. Yum!

Another shout out to our server, Marc, who never let our drinks run dry, spaced our courses perfectly, and answered all of our questions. He cleared and reset the table between each course.  Great job, Marc!"}
{"text":"New ownership at this place,  however the food is as good as my prior visits.  On my previous  review I gave it four stars because the place was starting to look run down and dirty  and the health score had dropped as well. That's not the case anymore. It looks cleaner and the health score has gone up too.  Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"The food is always amazing and the service is too! Little hole in the wall spot with a fun authentic feel inside too. Love it"}
{"text":"This was my first time here. Friends have highly recommended it and others advised me to pass. I decided on carry-out. 

I had the chicken cordon bleu (blue?), potato salad and mac n cheese. I also ordered some jambalaya. The chicken itself was very good. It was crispy, moist and nicely seasoned. Essentially a great fried chicken breast with a slice of ham on top followed by cheese and maque choux. Chicken, slice of ham, corn, cheese and spices. Although good, not exceptional. The mac n cheese was good. The potato salad was average. The jambalaya was good, but not exceptional for a Cajun restaurant. Maybe I was expecting more? I would go back, but not necessarily out of my way."}
{"text":"Food is well seasoned and you won't go home hungry. Overall a good experience. I will be back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome we had the chicken jambalaya perfect, gumbo perfect,fried oysters,Mac and cheese also yummy and the deserts were bread pudding and bananas foster super delicious our server Jennifer was funny and great. We definitely will be back"}
{"text":"I have the pick 3 with catfish and double oysters. And it came with two sides. Which didn't come out until 10 mins after the fish and oysters?.?. The fish tasted like the freezer, the sweet potato fries were old and the Caesar salad was not a Caesar salad. It had blue cheese and cooked red peppers which is not normal. And when I let my waitress know that I didn't like the salad. She did nothing. I will never come back."}
{"text":"Deb was awesome and such a great atmosphere to be at. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a New Orleans experience"}
{"text":"I have a love hate relationship with this place.  My belly likes it but my abs hide from it.  If you love savory or salty food this is the place for you.  I happen to love savory but some of the dishes here were a bit too salty for me, like the catfish. And the collard greens.  The fried chicken is well seasoned and tasty but very tangy so if you are not into vinegar marinades this fried chicken is not for you.  I like it.  The fried okra is delicious and salty... Maybe a little too salty but I think we all new what we were getting into going in.  I mostly do take out here because it's very close to home and the service isn't phenomenal.  The servers always seem overworked or like they have another pressing matter to attend to that just doesn't happen to be the diners.  What I love most about this place is for about 30-35 bucks I can get a quality bucket of 16 pieces of chicken and two sides and for a busy mom with a party of 5 and boys who play lots of week night sports, this saves me time and sanity which I'm sure some of you can appreciate."}
{"text":"This place is outstanding. I don't know why I haven't been here before. It's a lot smaller than I thought and can fill up fast. Started with the calamari, totally different then I have ever had before. It come with fried okra and artichoke. I then had the mix platter with fried oysters, fresh and cooked perfectly, and fried shrimp, cook perfect, and BBQ shrimp. Never had BBQ shrimp before so I don't have anything to compare it to but I will be ordering it again but as a full dinner. And if your not real hungry the BBQ appetizer is big enough to be a meal and it's served with grits. Well worth the Arboretum traffic."}
{"text":"The service was great and the food came out quickly. He food was great. I will definitely be back. The fried shrimp and oysters were perfect, battered just right!!!!"}
{"text":"I became a big fan of Red Oak (beer) because they have it on tap here.  I'm not a huge beer fan but I would definitely recommend it!  I LOVE their shrimp po boys and I recently tried the gumbo.  Big portions and great prices.  Also, I am down with the buffet of hot sauces!  they don't make things too spicey...so if the thought of hot Cajun cuisine scares you (because you are a baby kitty...) no worries.  This is a great spot!"}
{"text":"This our second time here and we have enjoyed it! Apps-crabcake -excellent and calamari/artichokes/okra - very good (some of the best okra we have had)The shrimp and grits was very good! The Jambalaya was ok. The meatloaf was good and the swordfish was very good and cooked very well. The bananas foster is awesome (more ice cream, please)! The wait staff is friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"This is what Tega Cay needed! Good Cajun food in a casual atmosphere. It's a much needed improvement to the previous Madison's on the corner, a neighborhood bar with mediocre food. 

The bar area stayed along with the tv's so you can still watch a game and grab a draft craft beer. I appreciate that they are currently carrying Windy Hill cider.

It was my birthday. We were seated quickly. Our waitress was friendly,  but seemed to be rushed. So there was no \"Have you eaten here before?\" conversation or let me suggest a few items. And throughout the evening several different servers stopped by to check in on us. We went with a shrimp and grits appetizer to start. It was good. The grits had a good flavor, but I tasted a slight bitterness that tasted like parmesan cheese which didn't quite fit the dish. But the shrimp were cooked perfectly and paired well with the grits. My husband ended up ordering a larger portion as his dinner. 

For my main course, I had the shrimp and chicken etouffe with a side of gumbo. The portion was huge. The etouffe was spicy and full of flavor, just how I like it. I'd definitely come back for this dish. The gumbo was okay.  It was pretty thick and didn't seem as flavorful as the other dishes. I'd probably opt for the seafood gumbo next time instead. I also wish some bread was served with the meal. I like to sop up every bit of sauce.

So, we finally got to dessert and asked if they did anything for birthdays. The waitress wasn't sure but later came out with a piece of cake and said \"Happy birthday.\" The cake tasted like a lemon pound cake and it was divine. It was heated up and just melted in my mouth. It was moist and sweet, but not too sweet. 

There's still a lot of things on the menu I want to try and I'm happy this is right down the road from me."}
{"text":"With my visit to the city my friend recommended this place. I've only had one previous experience with Creole/Lousiana style food and it was painfully (pun intended) so. I was hoping that this new experience would turn me towards the light of Creole/Cajun food. Meh, not so much.
 
We ordered a app, essentially fried okra, calamari and artitchoke and on the menu it said it was to be served with a remoulade. First, I do have to admit everything was fried nicely- even the calamari. Typically most resturants cannot fry calamari correctly to save their asses. Cajun Yard Dog (CYD) did this well. The amusing thing that happened when our waitress dropped off our app is the 3 of us instantly noticed that dipping sauce was no remoulade by anymeans. It looked more like ketchup and mayo mixxed together because it was not throughly combined before placed in the ramekin. I was already hesitant to taste it just because of the unappealing appearance of this sauce. After we all tasted it, we concluded it tasted like cocktail sauce with mayo mixxed in. I did not use the dipping sauce after that and simply ate the app on its own.
 
I ordered the crawfish etouffee. When I ordered it I was really walking into it blind. I knew I wanted to try something different and I've actually heard of a etouffee. But I figured crawfish, rice in a sauce, it really cannot be too bad. I got my etouffee with a side of collards. My friends got a meat gumbo and a blackened chicken po'boy.
 
First appearance of my plate I was taken aback. There was a very hearty helping of crawfish indeed. But the sauce was a very dark brown murky looking color with bright red crawfish atop and small scoop (albeit) white rice underneath it with a small saucer of collards placed next to it. Appearance is not everything in food, I've learned that. Jumping headfirst into tasting it because I was eager to see what this etouffee was supposed to taste like, I took a large bite. First taste impression? I thought it tasted like sort of a muddy river. It reminded me of watered down dirt. It did not taste like much else so I covered it in the hot sauce they had sitting on the table hoping I'd like it more. I did. About 20 so splashes of hot sauce it was more appealing to me. My collards were a disappointment. I love collards. A school friend from back home prided himself on cooking 'soul' food well, and he does. His collards I can still remember the flavor and texture. Just soft enough where the leaves would melt, but the stems need to be slightly chewed and a delicious bacon-veggie flavor. I got none of that from my CYD collards. I thought the collards could have been cooked a little bit longer and it needed more overall flavor.
 
I had a small taste of my friends gumbo, she did not say much. So I guess it was not much to talk about. The blackened chicken po' boy was a very hearty size. I did not ask about the taste, but he seemed fine with his sandwich.
 
Though CYD has not turned me off from Cajun/Creole cusine I am still saddened I cannot find or understand what this love of spicy, heavily season cajun/creole food when all the food I've tasted has not been spicy and or even that flavorful to me."}
{"text":"So glad I FINALLY found this place.
The food was great and the waitress was just as awesome.
We will definitely be going back soon"}
{"text":"Food was great! Had the grouper blackened. Also enjoyed the craft beer selection. Unfortunately there was only one server for the whole restaurant and service could've been quicker. Still recommend this place none the less."}
{"text":"Went here with co-workers on a Friday. Definitely a place that deserves repeat business. 

I ordered fried oysters and red beans and rice - and I got some of the best fried oysters I've had in a long time. I've notoriously had trouble finding any place in Charlotte that had fried oysters that I liked. (Only notorious because I complain about it loudly.)

One of my co-workers got a fish sandwich that looked to die for. One got a BLT which I'm sure was just great....

I can't remember what the rest of the table got, because I was too busy shoving oysters in my mouth and going \"yum\"."}
{"text":"Just ok....  service was slow and we arrived around 4:45pm on a Thursday.  Cucumber salads was not fresh and lacked flavor.  My guests liked the catfish po'boy and jambalaya.  Fried oysters were ok.  Definitely not New Orleans grade, but ok."}
{"text":"Was a little unexcited to try the new Cajun Yard Dog, but since it is close to home, we decided see what it is all about.  We are SO glad we did.  Have been there 4 times and not once have we been disappointed.  Portions are very generous, food is cooked to perfection and their specials are out of this word delicious!  Not knowing anything about Cajun Yard Dog, we anticipated a step above fast food and we were so shocked to find a pleasant atmosphere, great service and fabulous food.  Has become a regular stop for us."}
{"text":"How awesome to have really good, authentic, fresh Louisiana cuisine so close to home! We've been here several times since February and are never disappointed. We've had the jambalaya, etouffee, gumbo, salmon, trout, collards, okra and look forward to sampling everything else, New favorite place for spicy, flavorful Cajun food, c'mon!"}
{"text":"Really good!  We tried this place last weekend and the food was great.  Catfish, deviled eggs, potato salad - all awesome.  My friend had the pasta dish with shrimp and sausage and it was seriously good.  Very good service too.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"As the name would imply this is a Cajun restaurant in Fort Mill, SC. All of the food that I have had from them has been good except for one time when a new cook was in training. They have a different special every day and they serve the lunch menu until 4 PM. They have a full bar with a decent draft beer selection. I have always received good service at this restaurant. It's the same great food as the Arboretum location without the crowd!"}
{"text":"Weve made 2 trips.....grand opening day, good service, good food, a bit pricey...we had catfish app, etoufee, and tabasco strip sandwich with cabbage....only thing to note is that tabasco chicken, had no spice at all....2nd trip on Thursday, i had meatloaf po boy, while good, very little to no spice to it....supposed to have a sauce, but none detected...she had blt po boy and cabbage (yes, she loves the cabbage!)..blt was very good....2 issues on this visit ( none with food)..when we arrived, only several filled tables, we asked for booth, host said they save them for larger parties???, they seat 4.... we were sat at a 4 place table!....to add to that, after denying us a booth, we pointed to a table, he said, no, we will seat you \"here\".....we said, ok, wow......2nd issue wife noticed while going to restroom, with open view to kitchen, noticed floor was very dirty....she said, \"filled with food\".... we will give another shot, but will wait a while to hope they \"get the bugs out\""}
{"text":"This used to be one of our favorite restaurants,  but it has taken a downhill turn the last few times we have been here.   Tonight,  the chicken cordon bleu arrived with no cheese.   The maux choux sauce had no corn,  no peppers, or anything in it.   Just a dull cream sauce. I don't know if there are new owners,  etc., but definitely no where near the quality and taste. I'm sad."}
{"text":"Cajun Yard Dog is amazing! We finally tried this place for date night. I love the feel and vibes of the dining area but I do not love having to sign my name on the wait list. We only had to wait a couple minutes and a bus boy (?) seated us at the only open table. After being seated everything was wonderful. The service was attentive and all the food was delicious. I ordered the salmon with veggies and potato salad. Everything was perfectly cooked and the portions were huge. Hubby ordered jambalaya with Mac and cheese and his food was amazing as well. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Smothered cabbage. 

I almost want to end this review with those two words. Smothered freakin' cabbage. 

If you haven't had the smothered cabbage, you are missing the true meaning of life. I can't even properly describe it, as the description won't do it justice. No matter how many times I wash my hands, my fingers are not clean enough to type of the holy deliciousness that is Cajun Yard Dog smothered cabbage. It's something like cheese sauce that the cabbage is in...I'm not sure what that stuff is, really, but it's GOOD.

There's all kinds of wonderful cajun specialties, and the menu also has a few Southern classics, like the pimento cheese plate. I enjoy the pickled vegetable salad as well. Their prices are reasonable, the service is good, and the decor is as charming as anywhere I've been in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Yum. Just Yum. Came here because it was so convenient to shopping and was so surprised by how delicious our lunch was. Had Shrimp and Grits with Collards and my daughter had Red Beans and rice. We will definitely be back. And we didn't get dessert but the bread pudding that was served to the ladies at the next table was beautiful and they raved about it.  We all wanted more as soon as we finished!"}
{"text":"The staff was great and owners were really nice. I love Cajun food, however my food was a bit too greasy for my liking."}
{"text":"So happy to have a yummy Cajun restaurant close by in Tega Cay! I coordinate a monthly lunch group which numbers between 20 and 30 people and we love checking out local restaurants. Cajun yard dog wasn't known to many of my group but we were made to feel at home right away and the service was spot on. Lisa took care of our section and she had all sorts of good recommendations and advice that made our dining experience even better! I had the crawfish étouffée with a side of green beans almandine and both were delicious. My mom had shrimp and grits and I had a bite (since I can because I'm her daughter) which was very good. The sweet potato fries were a little tired. I went around the table and checked with everyone and they were all happy with their orders and felt it was good value for the amount of food that we got. Besides the great service, what also impressed me was that the manager/owner came over a number of times and made sure that all was wonderful. I'm looking forward to going back and trying out other tempting Entrees. Also the desserts looked awesome! If I wasn't so full I would've split one with my mom, but then I would've had to waddle back to my car and that isn't pretty. All in all we had a wonderful lunch and I would highly recommend Cajun yard dog for delicious Cajun food!"}
{"text":"I should try this place more often. The first and second times were pretty good experiences for me. Sometimes they're busy so it takes a few minutes before a server starts things out for you. The food is great, the interior is fancy and decorated with lots of Mardi Gras things. The sign is very bright neon yellow which is easy to find. The green beans a bit weird though, I wouldn't try those again. They mix it with something else which takes away the taste of the green beans. 
The inside is a bit small though, limiting the seating if it's crowded."}
{"text":"Delicious!!!

Appetizer #1: jalapeño deviled eggs.....very good!!!!

Appetizer #2: seafood gumbo...freaking delicious!!!!

Dinner for the wife: shrimp and grits with side of fried okra....she loved it!!!!

Dinner for me: crawfish creole with side of collards...the bomb dot com!!!!!

Dessert:  double chocolate pound cake...wow!!!!

Service by Bridget was excellent and the owner, Al was very nice."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in a long time and I've been taking about it to my wife for a while and we decided to go when we were in the area. Not only did I grow up in Charlotte, but I grew up in New Orleans too. So, I would call myself a Cajun food expert. 

There aren't that many places in or around Charlotte that have Louisiana/New Orleans level Cajun food and I always considered CYD to be one of them. However, on this trip, I just wasn't impressed. Years ago, I would swear this was the best place in town, but not so much now. Not to mention the prices are a little on the high side. With the food competition cranking up, you have to have really great food to charge high prices. 

It's always sad to see a restaurant you use to call the best not live up to its expectations, but it wasn't terrible either. The service was great, the atmosphere was great, it's just the food was decent and the prices were too high. 

I'll save my next Cajun food craving for when I'm in New Orleans."}
{"text":"Celebrating my son's forthcoming 14th bday.   His choice was this place largely for the fried oysters and Cajun  did not  disappoint.   Two orders of fried oysters and fried shrimp.   My wife loved the shrimp bc the breading is so light. Service was great too."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! Had never heard of this place, and a friend took us out for lunch. Great environment and service. Ordered the chicken and seafood jambalaya, it was delicious!"}
{"text":"I had the gumbo and the blackened mahi. The gumbo was delicious. It was spicy and had a lot of stuff in it. I would've gotten a bigger bowl if I had known it was that good. The Mahi was huge! I couldn't believe it was only $15. It was a really good value and included two sides. I got the smash potatoes which was good and the rice which was meh and a bit on the salty side.

I found this place on Yelp and it definitely did not disappoint. I don't think I'll be back in Charlotte anytime soon but this place would definitely be worth coming back."}
{"text":"The kitchen is very dirty and the food is over priced. Being a past worker I would not suggest anyone waste their money eating here. It's recipe based Cajun food that misses the mark and the authenticity. Blahhhhh"}
{"text":"If you like Cajun food you'll love the spicy salty food they have there

The staff was attentive,  the menu prices moderate and the food choices plentiful for a small restaurant decorated with a variety of  New Orleans and Cajun glitz

We ordered the beer battered mushrooms which were  very delicious and not greasy with a tasty horseradish sauce on the side

 I ordered the blackened salmon with two sides. My sides were  a cucumber salad, fresh sliced
 cucumbers in a vinegar, hot sauce marinade with red onions which I  personally did not care for 

The smothered cabbage with cheese was my other side,  good but the cheese made it to salty in my opinion.

 The salmon was tender and delicious with the same sauce  the mushrooms came with.

 My hubby's creole chicken was hot and spicy which he enjoyed.  His one side he chose was sautéed vegetables, a tender squash medley which to my surprise was very bland so I traded sides.!

Soup on the menu  but not served in the summer
The restaurant offered a nice variety of sweet desserts and beverages. There is always a catch of the day, market price.

I'd go back again to try something else"}
{"text":"We always have a great meal here. The husband and I went for dinner on date night. Everything we ordered was fantastic, not to mention the great service. The servers always remember us and we don't even go that frequently.  This time, the owner who has an eerie resemblance to Mark Margolis...great actor...oops, I digress. :-)  anyway, the owner was awesome and gracious. Awesome experience, as always."}
{"text":"I love cajun/N.O. styled food so once I heard about this place I had to stop in. When you walk in, there is a sign up sheet to be seated instead of a hostess which is a little odd. They weren't busy so we found a table immediately and were greeted. They have a good variety of items on the menu which is great. I went with the Jambalaya and smothered cabbage. The Jambalaya was great and tasted really fresh and homemade. I'd definitely go back for this. The smothered cabbage was different, but ok. It was like cabbage with a cheese sauce over it. The prices are a tad expensive, but they do give you quite a bit of food. The server was talkative and friendly. Apparently they also have some really good pound cake according the the table next to us. I'll be going back to get my cajun fix!"}
{"text":"If it would let me give a 3.5, I would. CYD is a story of almosts, yes, plural. My friend and I were trying to escape the downpour. We saw this place across the parking lot and decided to make a run for it. I'll try to keep it short. 

The menu got me stupid excited. It was like I was three years old and stumbled into a candy shop, only full of Cajun food. Every dish sounded great. It was a list full of classics. We got there after three, so we missed the chicken and waffles! Dammit! 

I decided on the Catfish po'boy so I could eat half and save room for the chocolate pecan pie later. My friend ordered the blackened meatloaf with mashed potatoes and mac and cheese.  My po'boy was okay. I've had better, but it wasn't bad. My friend's meatloaf and sides were very good. Though, there was nothing blackened about that meatloaf. A bit of a misnomer, but awesome nonetheless. 

Dessert fell flat. My chocolate pecan pie tasted more like a melted hot fudge sundae. I wish the chocolate had more body to it, like a custard. My friend's bread pudding was also just okay. 

I plan on returning, but next time I'll try an entree instead of a po'boy. OH, no liquor here. They only serve beer, wine, and nonalcoholic drinks. It's too bad. I wanted a hurricane. The whole experience had a lot of potential. It was almost great."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Cajun Yard Dog. Used to travel long distance to their Charlotte location. Great to have one of their restaurants in Fort Mill. Ate there tonight! 

I recommend the Deviled Eggs to start (jalapeños in the mix for extra flavor). For the entre, get the golden-fried catfish with jalapeño tarter sauce. See a pattern here? Level it out with potato salad and mac and cheese. Boom! For dessert, get the chocolate pecan pie and a coffee. Done. 

Cajun Yard Dog y'all!!!"}
{"text":"Cajun Yard Dog is a great restaurant. I had the fried catfish. It comes with jalapeño tartar sauce and two sides (of which there are many). I chose the mac and cheese and the sweet potato fries. For dessert, have the bananas foster. Awesome!"}
{"text":"Don't be discouraged by a line. Small place, delicious food, worth the wait!

Calamari Okrachokie is a MUST. Fried okra, calamari, artichoke... with a delicious dipping sauce. We almost ordered a second!

You can't go wrong with their daily specials-I had the fried trout that came over the crawfish etouffee, and a side of collards. My boyfriend ordered Seafood Jambalaya with macaroni and cheese. Everything was excellent-and the mac and cheese is a must order!

They also have an awesome beer selection! I can't wait to go back and have their shrimp and grits!"}
{"text":"Had a great pre Thanksgiving dinner here.  The service was personable and the ambiance was welcoming.  Had the fried green tomatoes for an appetizer, and all the enteees were great. I had the excellent chicken jambalaya, and my kids had the crab cakes and Cajun chicken.  Both were fantastic , especially the crab cakes - and we are from Maryland so praising NC crab cakes is saying something!  Can't wait to come back, but I highly recommend for anyone in the area!!  Great for a pre- or post -movie night bite to eat!"}
{"text":"A very solid 4/5 stars. With any restaurant I always ask myself Would I go back? Sure. 

Good food Delicious food."}
{"text":"Lovely red beans and rice and you do get the feeling that you would like to see someone earn their beads"}
{"text":"The best EVER! Myself and my entire staff eat here at least 3 times a week. The catfish, salmon, Mac n cHz, smothered cabbage EVERYTHING is amazing and friendly customer oriented staff"}
{"text":"How could this place get a 4...it's so awesome! 5 stars all the way. This is a quaint hidden gem with delicious authentic Cajun cuisine. I usually go to Cajun Queen because of the convenience and they also offer I standing Groupon deal but this is definitely the better of the two.

I have been here multiple times and it never disappoints. It is very small and you generally have to wait if you come here on a weekend for dinner but it is so worth the wait. 

Though their specialty is Cajun food it definitely has a soul food flair. I could honestly just come here and just eat sides. They have the best cabbage I've ever had in my life and their Fried Chicken is to die for.

Tonight I opted for the special because it looked way too good to pass up and it came with two sides. It was a blackened sea bass top with blackened shrimp and a sea crab sauce. Whatever you're thinking it tasted 10 times better.

If I had to find one fault it would be that they do not have a full bar however they do have beer and wine and they have some great local beer from New Orleans. Get the Dixie Voodoo. Trust me you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"My ultimate spot for Cajun food.  I always tell coworkers, friends, and family about this place.  My favorite meal is the Seafood and Chicken Jambalaya with mac n cheese as one of the sides and mash potatoes.  I recommend that for any first timer.  I've eaten here on my birthday at lunch time.  It's usually always packed in the evenings.  My new favorite is the fried chicken.  The chocolate pecan pie is divine!  I didn't care much for the blackberry cobbler nor the smothered cabbage (not my taste).  The food is usually consistently good but had times recently where I got the catfish for the first time but no sauce was in my bag for it, bland almondine string beans, and bland mash potatoes in that particular order.  Other than that I still like this place a lot."}
{"text":"Tucked away in the Arboretum Shopping Center is a little piece of Bourbon Street, dressed with mardi gras masks, Christmas lights, and beads.  Somehow they managed to keep it classy, with intimate seating arrangements and quiet music.  Think New Orleans jazz hangout rather than Girls Gone Wild.  

I love their great beer selection with a big variety of IPAs, lagers, and stouts.  I have never once eaten craw fish in my life, and I decided to brave it out and order the Black and Blue Craw fish Pasta, the special of the night.  It was a portion large enough for two meals and it was scrumptious.  I thought the blue cheese complimented the crawfish (and I was a little scared of this combination at first).  

Taylor, our waiter, spoke with us about the restaurant and his love of Cajun food.  I felt very welcomed and I am a craw fish fan now as well."}
{"text":"Blech!!!! Cajun, seafood blech!
The fish was so cooked that it fell apart with all the bones. Couldn't even get a bite w/o the bones."}
{"text":"This is a very hard review for me, but hopefully ... My explanation will help you understand the low rating. I ordered the blackened salmon with two sides of the smashed potatoes and the cucumber salad. Everything was very tasty. But the piece of salmon that I received was seriously 1 inch wide by 6 inches long. For $10! Now I'm not sure why, but every time I go, it seems like the salmon serving gets smaller and smaller. Not sure if it's because it's lunch? But I'm a big girl and I like a normal piece of fish. 3-4 inches wide by 6 inches long. Very odd experience for me. I wish I had taken a photo, but it was just so surprised that I just dug in and ate what was there."}
{"text":"This is a good new restaurant in Tega Cay, SC. 
I had the fried catfish and my wife had the fried chicken dinner. The fish was very well cooked and the breading was crispy with a nice hint of heat. The chicken was very crispy, moist and flavorful. 
Our server was very friendly and professional. 
We will definitely be going there again soon!"}
{"text":"Let me preface by saying that I am a New Orleans born and raised native living in the Carolinas.  That being said, were this restaurant in Louisiana they'd be tarred and feathered and run out of town.  My husband and I started our meal with the chicken and andouille sausage gumbo. It was good. It did not taste like any gumbo I've eaten before, but it wasn't a bad soup if I forgot that they consider it gumbo.  My husband ordered the shrimp po-boy and I ordered the red beans and rice with andouille sausage. His shrimp were undercooked, definitely under seasoned and drowning in mayonnaise.  Water has more taste than these shrimp.  Red beans and rice from Louisiana is often considered creamy.  Red beans are cooked with ham and sausage until they fall apart and they have a creamy consistency and a pink color.  These beans needed several more hours of cooking.  The sausage in the beans tasted boiled.  The beans themselves were spicy and that is the nicest thing I could say about them.  To be honest, if you want decent red beans and rice outside of Louisiana go to Popeyes, at least they are creamy with some flavor."}
{"text":"Great food and very flavorful. Also the drinks are top notch and that's something your not going to expect from a little place in the corner of a strip mall. Decor is kind of ok but let's face it if you want affordable top quality Cajun food this is the place to go."}
{"text":"I was very dissatisfied with the place and I had heard such great things about it my service was terrible I'm not sure if she was having a bad day or what but she was very inattentive I disliked the food as well everything I ordered was bland only thing good to me was the chocolate pecan pie"}
{"text":"So solid and crispy reliable.

I have no idea if this is authentic Cajun food and I really don't give a shit.

All that matters is, this is tasty eats.  Check it out if you are in the mood for some fried semi-greasy goodness."}
{"text":"I love the food here. I don't know how authentic to Cajun the food is - never had true Cajun - but I've never not enjoyed my meal. The remoulade is delicious as well - perfect heat. My only complaint is that their wait times are outrageous. They need to offer reservations or move to a bigger building with more staff. No one wants to wait an hour with no other option but to just wait for their name to be called. Worth the wait, though, if you ask me."}
{"text":"Fantastic menu and preparation. Great beer and wine selection. Friendly and extremely knowledgeable staff. Very neat story."}
{"text":"The food was A-Mazing!  One of the best Southern meals I've had.  The fried chicken and blackberry cobbler were to die for."}
{"text":"I was very interested in visiting CYD (Cajun Yard Dog) simply because Madison's was gone and they're new. Which is great for this area! I ordered the deviled crab cake and Okrachokie minus the okra... (I am an okra snob and frozen just doesn't cut the cake, but that's just me). What was left was artichokes and calamari. I also LOVE red beans and rice. This version contained andouille sausage. 

How was it? The calamari was fried with the artichokes and that's where it goes wrong. Calamari cook extremely fast, so fast in fact that the breading is often under cooked while the calamari over cook. They come out a bit rubbery and the artichokes were soggy. The breading was a bit bland. Which was a bit of a shock.

When I was looking the menu over I was rather intimated by all the Cajun and jalapeño ingredients, but I shouldn't have been. The heat is warm and builds, but stays rather mellow. Sauce is king here, delish! 

Next up is the red beans and rice. I got here at 7:45-8pm and they close at 9. I am saying this because it is rather late to be ordering food. The rice was perfect. The seasoning was spot-on! Really good flavor here. However, the sausage tasted like it had been cooking for about 24 hrs, way over cooked and a bit grainy textured. The beans were good, maybe a bit dry, but again, the flavor was as really great! 

Lastly, the crab cake. I saved this for last because it was my favorite! I am a Floridian originally and this deviled crab cake took me back to my home state. They are thick (possibly a bit too thick) but taste just like the thinly battered deviled crab I grew up with. Don't expect it to be a Maryland crab cake... this is purely the Southern deviled crab cake. 

I'll will be returning to tray actual dinners and at a better time. 

Update! I returned to CYD this evening and got the red beans and rice again, the crab cake again, and this time a kids shrimp with Mac and cheese. All the items were cooked to perfection! The crab cake was superb for a Cajun crab cake (which is served deviled crab style, I love it!) I also ordered fried pickles, which are new to the menu and they are probably the BEST fried pickles I've had in a long while! They are dill and crunchy! I say this because pickles are wet and that usually makes the batter coating a bit soggy, not the case! These are crunchy dill and the breading stays crunchy also! The sauce has just enough kick for you to know it's spicy, but I was still able to keep dipping.

I am happily updating my three stars to 4! Can't wait to try more of the seafood!! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"It was good and cooked to order, but not cheep. 
Kids meals $6.00 plus side and drink; but no milk!
Blacken salmon with two side- dressing good sweet fries not so good. 
Shrimp po boy- good job with it
mac and cheese- good
Kids loved their fried shrimp"}
{"text":"This place rocks! It's right by my house so we just went there after church. I got the jambalaya and my husband got the meatloaf po boy. Both of us took home leftovers because the portions were so huge! Food was authentic and tasty!"}
{"text":"The food was wonderful! We had the Seafood Jambalaya and the Crawfish Ettouffe with the fried oysters as a starter. Oysters were a little small, but flavorful. Both the jambalaya and ettouffe were delicious! Only one thing that would prevent us from revisiting is the awful long wait. We waited about over an hour! The place is very small, so be sure not to show up hungry on a weekend night! :)"}
{"text":"I have been only twice, and have gotten only the fried chicken and the fried catfish (woe to my arteries). Both have been among my favorite meals in recent memory. The fried chicken was juicy and well seasoned. The catfish was expertly prepared and was almost melt-in-your-mouth. Okras were delicious. Mac and cheese was among the best I've had. Slaw was unique. I recommend this place with no reservations."}
{"text":"Great 1st time experience.  The staff was friendly, the food was great, and the environment was nice.  There's something on the menu for everyone and a few televisions are available for the sports fans."}
{"text":"Always love the catfish bites!!! Sometimes that's all we order for the table. Service is not always that friendly and they have turned our group away in the past, but we'll keep going back for the catfish."}
{"text":"Found this hole in the wall. Everything we ate was delicious. Mac n cheese is top 3 best I've ever had. Definitely will be returning! Keep it up."}
{"text":"Went for lunch had the fish it was to strong like it was old. The owner was rude he made our group feel very uncomfortable. Won't be back"}
{"text":"Had lunch here with my husband and I must say the best food in Charlotte hands down. We're Caribbean so we tend to look for flavor without adding anything extra. My husband ordered shrimp & grits and the red snapper. I ordered the catfish with masked potatoes and it reminded me of grandmothers cooking. I ordered a slice of key lime pound cake and fell in love. All of my childhood memories in one spot."}
{"text":"The key to this place is ordering right! Highly recommend their fried chicken or chicken jambalaya. Friendly staff and owner keep us coming back. This is a must to try if you are in the south Charlotte area. 

But keep in mind seating inside and the outside waiting area is limited and its first come first serve."}
{"text":"Had a date night here.  I had chicken etoufee and wife had blackened salmon and gumbo.   Both dishes were tastefully presented and tasted good.
I give it a 3 star b/c it was a little pricey for the atmosphere.  Also the etoufee did not appear to have REAL Rox sauce.   What I got looked like tan gravy versus the real dark, rich Rox sauce I love.
Lastly there was no Dixie land jazz music which I like to hear when I'm at a Cajun restaurant.  Take a couple pointers from the Cajun Queen in charlotte and y'all be alright."}
{"text":"The Yard Dog has style, their own style, that is. It's campy and fun to go there. I like their menu (my husband is crazy about their cajun meat loaf) and they have a calamari appetizer that is amazing. 

I highly recommend their fish entrees if you like fish (steamed or fried or, of course, cajun!) Not particularly impressed with their red beans and rice, but their etouffee and gumbo are excellent. I love their side dishes, which includes mac n cheese, fried okra, cucumber salad, green beans and much more. 

The Yard Dog always has fun beer options and a great dessert menu, as well as an easy kids menu that will please the picky little eaters in your family."}
{"text":"Great little hole in the wall place. the seating area is small in this strip mall. but the flavors are huge. For lunch we wanted some Cajun flare. Immediately upon walking in you think its a little cheesy decorated place, but then we seated ourselves and was soon greeted by Lynn who says she was going on her 9th year there. she was so joyous and helpful with lots of information. She made our daughter feel great buy teaching her how to make a star in the bead necklace, (Lynn---Shelby thanks you!) 
After reading reviews here we decided to order the deviled eggs, although they were tasty- I think my own have bolder flavors. BUT the fried green tomatoes was outta this world!! WOOT WOOT we had the fried chicken which was recommended by Lynn and it was really good, I could taste that they are either soaked in Texas Pete or it is at least part of the breading process. but detected no \"heat\" per say. The chicken was crispy outside and very juicy inside. The mac n cheese is nice as well as the cucumber salad. 
Great place to get some fried foods that are made to order and in house!!! no pre processed crap here!"}
{"text":"The fried oyster is my go to when I stop by. Heck, it's the only reason I drive over to the area. I've ordered the dish since 2012 or so. Recently, it seems like they've changed the recipe for it. They used to be full sized oysters that was coated nicely in batter. Now, it's bite sized pieces and when I ordered my take out, it was overcooked. If I had the time, I would've requested them to remake it but today, I had to eat what was given. 

They have other food items which aren't that bad. It's the only nearby creole that I know of. The decor has that Mardi Gras feeling. Very causal but it's a small seating area. If you plan on a large group, it's best to call in before stepping in. 

Sometimes it's busy but at times when it's not, you would expect the servers to check on you every so to make sure you're good on the beverages. 

It's a nice little restaurant and if you're in the mood for the type of food and are nearby, then definitely stop by."}
{"text":"The hostess station is weird. I wouldn't even call it a station. It's a legal pad and your write your name and party number. 

I ordered the shrimp and andouille pasta. It was creamy and amazing. Our waiter was friendly and hospitable. I have a long list of dishes that I'd like to try. 

They receive pound cakes on Tuesday from a local bakery and the cakes are usually sold out by Friday. I've heard great things about the pound cake & can't wait to try it."}
{"text":"I love this place!  I eat here several times a month and it has always been good.  The seafood gumbo, crab cakes, crawfish etouffee, cajun meatloaf, catfish and sides are great!  I have probably ate here 50 times at least.  Everything is fresh made and the service is fantastic."}
{"text":"Very good food, good wait service, but we got a horrible table that completely killed the experience. We watched the host and owner debate how best to divvy up 3 tables for a 6 top and 2 top. Ultimately, we as the 2 top got the shaft and were placed right next to the door and those waiting for a table. They were less than a foot away, and the host and owner manager kept walking up to our table, and talking to the people behind us. Terrible experience, although if we were at any other table, we would have had a great time. That one table sabotaged the entire experience for us and I can't see going back."}
{"text":"Wow it was really great, the oyster app was only $10 and had at least 12 oysters, perfect to share.  Blackened salmon was amazing, loved the grits and stir fried veggies, and husband got etoufee and it was filled with crawfish.  So thrilled that for once we were able to have a relaxing meal in a restaurant where we weren't rushed.  She took our order after our appetizer arrived, which was great.  Perfect service-you could definitely see the owner's influence and attention.  Which is rare these days."}
{"text":"Tonight we stopped by Cajun Yard Dog for dinner and it was outstanding. We split the fried calamari as an appetizer, which was absolutely delicious - I loved the creamy cocktail sauce, and it also had some fried okra and even a couple of pieces of fried artichokes in the mix. 

For our entrees, I ordered the fried oysters with a crab cake, and a side of mac and cheese and grits. All outstanding! The crab cake was especially good with a spicy sauce on top and a crispy outside. 

My husband ordered fried shrimp, blackened Mahi Mahi and a crab cake with a side of sweet fries and Mac and cheese. The Mahi Mahi was delicious and I highly recommend that combined with the crab cakes for the perfect combo. 

Service was really good as well. We will definitely be going back! We would have taken pictures of the food but we ate it all too fast!"}
{"text":"We LOVE the Cajun Yard Dog!!   My Gumbo cravings keep me coming back!  My 12-year-old loves the Tobasco Strips with Mac and Cheese.  He also has to check out the desert menu which has fresh surprises every week.  He enjoyed the sweet potato spice caramel pound cake this week.  On a scale of 1 to 10 he gave it 100!  I feel the same about the Bananas Foster!"}
{"text":"This place is a true hole in the wall but an amazing find! It's super small and you'll def have to wait for a table but that's about the only complaint. I had the shrimp and grits and it was amazing! The grits were perfectly cooked and not overly cheesy, the shrimp were good size and flavorful it had just the right amount of spice. I had the Mac and cheese as my side, its home made creamy and delicious. My boyfriend had the fried catfish which was the best I've ever had. It was super crispy, the breading stayed on and not greasy at all. The only subpar thing was the chips appetizer we ordered, they weren't hot and probably been fried a while ago and the dipping sauces were pretty bland. Over all it's authentic cajun/creole and worth a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to go to satisfy my taste buds. The food is absolutely delicious! And the owner ensures that the service is top notch! I can't recommend just one thing because everything is good!"}
{"text":"I love this place!! The fried chicken is amazing. The macaroni and cheese is fantastic! Shrimp and grits are great. 

So far I haven't had anything I didn't like! 

Here's a tip: try the dog sauce!!!!

The staff is very friendly. This place has a very comfortable feeling. New Orleans style restaurant. If you haven't been you need to go!"}
{"text":"Creole cooking - the largest mystique of my culinary curiosity. Sure, I've eaten a lot of weird shit; it's a trait that comes with shoving an item in your mouth as your first method of solving general curiosity. But Cajun food... how does it work? What the hell is in it that is supposed to make it so good?
My general impression of Cajun food is that people, living in a swamp their whole lives, lived off dredging the bottom of river beds and boiling or frying whatever came up. Usually when people are faced with the most unusual ingredients, then they'll work their hardest to make it taste good, and there came the allure. Creole became my culinary unicorn. 
Living in New England, I didn't stand a chance at finding any creole. I read up on it a lot, but also couldn't find a lot of the ingredients, like a gumbo file or crawfish. 
When I moved to Charlotte, I had my first Cajun experience at the Cajun Queen. I split a seafood etouffee. While not holding the spice I was hoping for, it was pretty good all the same. 

Thusly.... we come to the Cajun Yard Dog. It was an interesting night to go. I had loaded up on margaritas and wasn't feeling all that hungry for the fried oyster po'boy I had been eyeing on the interweb for months, so instead went for the gumbo. 

I got the wrong damn gumbo. I wanted seafood gumbo, because chicken, sausage and rice doesn't interest me, and it was in a beef broth, not seafood stock, so it wasn't particularly to my liking. For what it was, though, it was pretty good. I was expecting something much thicker, however. There was a spicy tang at the end, but not much of a flavorful palate to begin with.

We did start off with the fried artichoke/okra/calamari app, and that was pretty good, but standard fare. Their 'remoulade,' as a lot of people have pointed out, really tastes like mayonnaise and cocktail sauce slightly stirred together. Not impressed. 

One person I was with got the crawfish etouffee, but it wasn't as flavorful as the one at the Cajun Queen, not to mention that there was too much rice and it overwhelmed the sauce. Also, the collards were undercooked. 

The last item that didn't disappoint, was that my friend got a blackened chicken po'boy. This was a frickin' huge sandwich, and the chicken was cooked well, was spicy, and had huge slices of tomato with lots of lettuce on flavorful bread. The one thing that I really wanted turned out to be the only really good thing at the table. 

Bottom line: 

The atmosphere was friendly, and the service was good.
For food, stick with the po'boys. I am definitely going back because I need a fried oyster po'boy! Everything else that I experienced... I'd want to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I am so excited about the awesome new restaurant! Finally something new and different in the general area. 

First - they have made changes since it was Maddie's. New paint, lots of decorations making it a fun space to hang out in. I had been trying to dray my fiancé here since it opened. Apparently he thought it was some form of hot dog place. What? No, definitely Cajun food without a hot dog to be seen on the menu.

We went late one Saturday for dinner and it was only moderately crowded. Our waitress was friendly and prompt with all of our orders. We started with the jalapeno deviled eggs which were just okay. Far too much salt for me to love them. I ordered the crawfish etoufée because I like crawfish but hate dealing with the shell. Etoufée is one of my only options to enjoy crawfish. I upgraded my side to gumbo and had it come out first because why wait any longer than you have to for gumbo? The gumbo was a full delicious bowl with just the right amount of spice. My etoufée was also yummy and came out on a huge plate. Even without a side or app it was definitely a two meal amount of food. 


The real winner of the night was my fiancé's delicious chicken and seafood jambalaya. It had all sorts of seafood in addition to chicken and sausage. It also came with a touch of heat and the restaurant provides three different hot sauces to kick it up a notch if you want. 

While the weather definitely called for some spicy rice based dishes on this visit I was also excited to see lots of blackened fish and other lighter options. I love places that offer a variety of choice. It looks like they also rotate fish based specials as well!"}
{"text":"I heard very good reviews on this place but was not thrilled.  First, the service was poor.  I don't know if there weren't enough servers, but it took a while to be served.  I had the Cordon Bleu, which I love, so was hoping the reviews were correct.  I ordered a beer as well.  Not the best selection but manageable.  Anyway, as soon I saw the ham and cheese on top of the chicken, I was skeptical.  Yup, not the way to prepare this dish.  It was a little dry.  It wasn't horrible but I was expecting a lot more. The mashed potatoes were just okay as well.  The waiter never asked if I wanted another beer and my wife had to hunt another staff member down to get water.  I may try it again if friends wanted to go, otherwise, I don't think so."}
{"text":"Not the best Cajun food I've had, but still very good. Owner seems to take pride in creating a great restaurant. Great addition to a Fort Mill area that's greatly lacking food diversity."}
{"text":"After taking over the previous dive of a sports bar, I was curious to see what the folks associated with CYD had to offer Fort Mill. The interior looks slightly different after they took some time to re-do it. I wouldn't consider it to be a sports bar anymore, more of a family restaurant. Even though they still have the flat screens from the previous bar, they are not open late like a sports bar.

They definitely disappoint on the food side of things. The waitress talked us into the catfish \"bites\" as an appetizer, as you can see in the photo - \"bites' is not an adequate description! You could definitely consider these a meal by themselves! They were tasty indeed.

I ordered the meatloaf with side of collards and red beans/rice. The meatloaf was very good! So huge I forced myself to stop eating half way or I would need to be rolled out to my truck! Jeez. My friend is a po-boy connoisseur and he came back with two deep fried thumbs up after chowing down on the shrimp pro-boy.

They do not offer draft beer, but they have a very small list of bottled beer including some Louisiana favorites. They bar can also assist in select liquor drinks. (Editor's Note: Unless you;re craving a vodka/red bull, they do not stock red bull.)

Simple. Cajun. Goodness. I would return."}
{"text":"I had heard good things about the 'dog, and have to say that in general, I was a bit disappointed.

We happened to be in the area for one reason or another, and so we stopped in for what we hoped would be a quick meal. The menu looked appetizing, and after placing our order, we settled into a nice discussion and waited for things to arrive. And waited. And waited. And waited.

Eventually the dishes showed up, which meant we were able to dig into our dishes, and it just led to some disappointment. To be fair, it could have been because of the huge wait. But the dishes really didn't live up to the description on the menu, or to the level we  had been hoping for that was seen by many other reviews. They weren't bad - they just didn't have the kick we were expecting.

Off night? Perhaps - it happens to everyone. We may try again, but since they aren't in our neck of the woods, it might be a while.

On the upside, the decor was definitely interesting, and because of the service misses, we had plenty of time to look at it."}
{"text":"Had lunch on a Tuesday with friends; we arrived just before noon and had no trouble getting a table; but, the tables filled quickly, and became quite loud. Our server was nice and checked in on us through out the meal. I had the Fried Crab Cake with the House made Macaroni and Cheese: both were tasty. It was an enjoyable experience and I will be back again."}
{"text":"I went to CYD for the first time last night with a friend. As I am a vegetarian, this may have not been my first choice, but I'm always up for trying new places and my rating is a balance of my experience. Five stars for the fried okra and chocolate pecan pie, 2 stars for the deviled eggs  and 1 star for the iceberg tomato salad. I wanted the Cesar salad, but they were out of romaine lettuce. The place is small and we waited at least 40 minutes for a table, but there's a lot of shops in the strip mall to pass the time. Our server was courteous and efficient. If I go back, I'll get the fried okra again and try a few more sides."}
{"text":"Grossssssss! Walked in and immediately smelled like someone was smoking in my face. The bartender said \"it's probably the owner\" ummmm Ok that makes it even worse. Left immediately."}
{"text":"Don't know how people are saying the food was bland, we thought it was awesome! Tons of flavor, everything made from scratch in house. Awesome shrimp and grits and crab cakes! All sides were delicious. Service was also fantastic. Came out very fast. I'm just visiting but my family will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We were looking for a restaurant close to my friends house and found Cajun. I asked the waiter about the most popular Po-boy and he suggested the shrimp. So I ordered the shrimp Po-boy with the smash potatoes and a side of the pickled beets. My friend had the fried shrimp, collards and fried okras. The Po-boy was larger than I expected and was delicious with just the right amount of shrimp, tomatoes and lettuce. The pickled beets was one of the best I have had from a restaurant, and plenty of them.
My friend had the shrimp and they were large jumbo shrimp that wasn't heavily dipped in batter. The were light and flakey. She said the collards were good. I didn't taste them because they were  cooked in pork. A good night and a good choice of restaurants. 
The only bad thing was waiting for a table and waiting for our food. I'm glad we didn't order an appetizer because we took home another serving of food."}
{"text":"Great menu. Blackened mahi mahi very good. Smothered cabbage really good. Price is a little high for lunch (around $11  for entree and 2 sides) 
Good bottled beer menu, around 8 beers on tap. Great service and personal attention from the manager. Definitely a nice addition to the area"}
{"text":"Have been going to the Yard Dog for years and am surprised it is just now receiving attention on Yelp! The food is fantastic with daily specials. You can't go wrong ordering as I have never been disappointed by any of their offerings. The staff is just as authentic as their food and the decor adds to the experience. Looking forward to the next visit!"}
{"text":"Spent over $100 on a Togo order for company after getting a recommendation from a girl I met shopping. Well 75% went in the trash. We had entrees and apps. Nothing was appealing. Maybe we should have dined in."}
{"text":"This is one of the few Charlotte restaurants my husband and I visit on a regular basis and is one of the few restaurants we take visitors to Charlotte to.  Although small inside, the atmosphere is jumping with everything \"southern\" and \"Louisiana\" on the walls.  The waitstaff is very friendly and have great recommendations for first timers. The jalapeno deviled eggs are an excellent starter. For lunch I always get the Catfish Po Boy with sweet potato fries.  For dinner the red beans and rice entree is my favorite.  Be sure to save room for Chocolate Pecan Pie or take it to go. Good beer and wine selection too."}
{"text":"Wow. Exceeded my expectations. Loved the hand cut french fries. Cajun food was authentic. Great for kids too."}
{"text":"Great place in Tega Cay with authentic Cajun food. I had blackened Mahi, collard greens and pickled beets and my nephew had the jambalaya and fried okra. All of it was fantastic!  Met the owner, Al, who guarantees the best meal or your money back."}
{"text":"Food is always good! Small place so allow yourself enough time to enjoy your meal. They close at 10 and are usually busy. You will be waiting for an average of about 20mins to be seated. Don't keep this friendly staff at work longer than they have to be."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic.  Service was good.  Wait for table was bearable.  Bar selection was okay.  We liked the small atmosphere with eclectic decor.  We will be back.

What we ate:  
Calamari Okrachokie - delicious artichoke and okra, pretty good calamari.  
Shrimp & Grits - Over-the-Top Delicious.  Makes my mouth water to type.
Blackened Mahi with pickled beets and green beans - very good fish, really liked the beets, green beans were good but nothing too special.
BBQ Shrimp with Jambalaya and sweet potato fries - BBQ shrimp and jambalaya were great, SP fries just okay.
Bread pudding - huge portion of incredible dessert - melt in your mouth delicious."}
{"text":"I guess coming from NY, I have high expectations when it comes to flavor and cajun food. Sadly, I didn't think this was as good as it is hyped up to be. The southern charm is real though.. employees and waitstaff are super friendly but the food itself has been made to please the pallet of the southern people. Do not expect true, authentic or spicy, deep ingredient cajun food here."}
{"text":"This place is as close to True Cajun Cooking as I have experienced since I left Louisiana!  I had the Chicken Jambalaya with Mac n Cheese on my first visit and it left me with definate desire to return.  The Jambalaya is exactly the way I had it Down in LA.  Who DAT?  The Cajun Yard Dog is Dat!  The texture and the Flavors were right on mark.  It was an explosion of different flavors going off on my taste buds!  Not just a meal, an eating experience!  After all isn't that what we all want when we go out to eat.  Well you will find it here.  The Mac n Cheese is to die for.  It is very similar to my wifes Mac n Cheese and I absolutely love her Mac n Cheese.  Creamy, Rich and the pasta cooked just right, tender buit not soft and mushy.  Delicious!
My wife had the Fried Catfish with Jalapeno tartar, fried Okra and Red Beans and rice!  I sampled each of her items and this is my opinion of them.  The Catfish was nothing short of amazing!  Very Crispy on the outside and light and fluffy inside with a hint of spice(heat) in the batter. Mouthwatering by itself but the Jalapeno Tartar made it pop!  The fried okra was just like Mama made it!  Delicious!  The Red Beans and Rice were so good It'd make you want to slap your Mama!  A perfect blend of seasonings and spice to drive your taste buds wild!  The best Red Beans and Rice I have ever had and I have had plenty.
I asked the waitress how the Gumbo was and she quickly brought me a sample.  It was just like I had expected.  Right on the money!  All thier dishes are made fresh daily and have the flavor and feel of a homecooked meal.  The atmosphere is upbeat and vibrant with that small romantic New Orleans Cafe feeling!  Awesome for a lunch date or any occasion.  To sum things up, I had an outstanding meal with a decent price in a comfortable environment.  What else could you want.  My family and I will definately be back!  WHO DAT?  WE DAT!"}
{"text":"While on the wait list I had to use the restroom.  Thankfully I got to experience how little they care about cleanliness at this place.  The men's one person restroom had a lock on it that didn't work, a stall that you couldn't close and lock, urine and paper towels littering the toilet seat and floor, and a sink that after use would make you feel more dirty than when you started.  After returning from the restroom we walked right over to Panera Bread.  Too bad as I was looking forward to trying this place for the Cajun food, but I probably saved my wife and I from an evening of stomach pains!  After a few episodes of food poisoning over the years I've learned that if a restaurant cares that little about the customer experience (that they refuse to even fix their restroom) how could anyone believe they care about your experience with their food/drink."}
{"text":"Tried to get lunch and after ten minutes of no attention in regards to menu order etc. I walked out while the place was at 40% capacity at best. No idea how the food is but the service seems to be horrible. No one seemed to care."}
{"text":"Bon temps.  Very good substitute for being in New Orleans.  Debbie was a doll and took good care of us.  Save room for bananas foster and bread pudding.  Hello food coma."}
{"text":"This place was good; the calamari and okra appetizer was great, excellent meatloaf, the BBQ Shrimp were good, and the pecan pie was GREAT!
I don't know how authentically cajun this place is, but they serve comfort food, and I left comforted!  
This is a great place to split an appetizer, main dish, and dessert between two people...plenty of food.  Good value!"}
{"text":"Delicious food all the way around, I got the Tabasco po boy and my daughter got the meatloaf po boy. Both were really tastey and I even had half of hers for lunch the next day. I was originally drawn here for their bananas foster dessert, it seems like the only place around that serves it and they definitely delivered. We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in all of Charlotte. Friend okra, calamari, blackened salmon, po boys, all of it. Everything is great and staff is ALWAYS friendly."}
{"text":"We've eaten here a number of times for lunch & have always enjoyed our meals. The shrimp & grits are excellent, as is the shrimp po' boy."}
{"text":"First time here. Chose this because of yelp reviews.  The cajun Chicken breast was the best!  And the smothered cabbage was to die for! Greens were way to  salty for my liking. Fried green tomatoes were yummy!!  The jalapeño tarter sauce was not working.... but great customer service and i will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food was okay, but it took almost an hour to get our food after we ordered it.  When the food was finally brought to us, we still had to wait for a side that was being \"made to order.\"  Really, it takes over an hour to boil some noodles and make a watery cheese sauce for mac and cheese in a small side dish bowl?  The unsweetened tea had gone bad and I had to send it back.  My friend was brought the wrong beverage and then argued with when she said it wasn't what she ordered.  The owner was nice and apologized about our wait when we told him our problems, but we were only offered a free dessert after being told about their small kitchen and a large to-go order that had come in slowing down the restaurant.  At that point, we just wanted to leave.  

This was my first experience at this restaurant.  I had heard good things, but good things wasn't my experience.  I hope they were just having an off day.Not sure I'd go back."}
{"text":"Once again a great experience. Food was fantastic and service was spot on. Sunday 4pm, no one there so we sat at the bar. The blackened swordfish special was great. It came covered with pineapple slaw and a wasabi honey mustard sauce. Cooked perfectly and a good size portion. The red beans and rice were better than I expected. The catfish fingers and Mac n cheese are seem to be consistently good. We were sold on bananas foster, it did not disappoint.. We will return!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places - I've been frequenting this place for as long as I can remember. I usually go to the Arboretum location but am excited there's a new location in Fort Mill (eventually I'll get there). My parents are Yankees that moved to LSU for college and they said it's at close as you can get in CLT. I've been to NOLA three times myself and agree. I usually get the crawfish etoufee, seafood gumbo or fried oysters. When they have blackened trout on special I get that. Their green bean almondine are the best green beans I've ever had. If you're feeling extra fat kid get the chocolate pecan pie. Servers are great and I love that it's the same crew since I started going here which usually is a good sign in how they treat their staff."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here a few times and have yet to have a bad experience! The staff is friendly and attentive but aren't intrusive or bothersome.  Prices and portions are reasonable.  The food is delicious!  I am not a spicey food person so Cajun food is generally out of the question for me, but I have to say I really like this place! On our most recent trip I got the chicken cordon bleu with a side of mashed potatoes -- highly recommend!  My husband has tried the gumbo and etouffee and loved both.  Give the Cajun yard dog a try you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Small place in Arboretum out-door mall. Great food! Reasonable to lower prices. Some unique low-country/Cajun dishes. Live music on Fri. and Sat. evening. Get there early the band has their own following!"}
{"text":"The food here is delicious, the service spectacular, BUT do not order the blackened salmon during lunch if you are looking to receive more than a 3oz filet. I don't think I have ever been to a restaurant that serves 3oz as an entrée... I could type about this for the entire review but I will move along :-D

Lunch items ordered:
Jalapeno deviled eggs: just regular deviled eggs with pickled jalapenos in the middle of the plate
Blackened Salmon - cooked perfectly but very small, seasoned just right.
Almond green beans- yummy, but a little to overcooked
Collards-DELICIOUS, I will just order two servings of this next time lol
HOUSE SAUCE- I put this on the deviled eggs and they definitely made them better, worthy of the \"not your mama's deviled eggs\" title after the addition of the sauce.


I will most likely visit the original location In Charlotte, NC . Maybe the dinner size salmon will be at least 5oz. ?"}
{"text":"We have been here several times since moving to Charlotte.  Not being a Southern boy myself, I can't attest to the authenticity of the recipes, but the food is just straight up good.  My wife always goes with the shrimp and grits, while I might go with a blackened fish of the day or the fried chicken.  And don't forget the rice and beans as a side."}
{"text":"On the very enthusiastic reviews of Rebekah, Joy, and others, we headed to the Cajun Yard Dog last night and it was as good as advertised.

The staff was one of the best and most friendly in Charlotte.  The gumbo and jambalaya was very good and, as Joy so fervently reported, the smothered cabbage was excellent.

We finished it off with a fresh buttermilk pie which was absolutely delicious.  

Great staff, delicious food, cozy ambiance and Abita on draft.  What else could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Crap I'm so full I can hardly write this review. My stomach is way beyond my pants. I really tried to stop but the bread pudding came out and it was a beacon of  deliciousness and shamefully I did inhale. Prices are 10-20 per plate. Bread pudding was just under 6$ not including 1.50 for ice cream. Fried shrimp not over cooked amazing. My son said the Mac and cheese was the best. Service was good. It's smaller inside then I thought. Def worth a try. I really wanted more crawdad on the menu but oh well it was still good and we will be back"}
{"text":"Food is delicious. Really love the Jambalaya. Owner is super cool too. He came by and spoke with us several times. Very personable!"}
{"text":"Very laid back child friendly atmosphere! Our waitress was very sweet and attentive. The food was satisfying but I cannot give this place 5 stars because nothing was extraordinary about it.

Definitely worth going to for lunch!"}
{"text":"I heard a few months back that Tega Cay was getting a \"Cajun Yard Dog\". I have never been to the Arboretum location, but I have heard great things. That, plus being a fan of Louisiana food, convinced me to give it a try... and loved it! I ordered the Crawfish etoufee and the Mrs got their special cob salad. We both really enjoyed the food. Cool restaurant inside. Now the place just opened up, so the typical \"kinks\" will be ironed out, but I am convinced this place will be around for many years!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the servers here are wonderful. Friendly, attentive, caring, and quick. Now I will start with the appetizer...catfish bites. Ok...the flavor was good, but second bite into them I pull out a hair in the batter. Absolutely disgusting.  The server quickly took it away and was very nice. I didn't order another. The second course took forever to come out. It was a busy Saturday night, but I still think here should be some type of order or limit to how long customers should wait for food.  I ordered the blackened tuna, smothered cabbage, and cucumber salad. The tuna was good, nice taste.  The smothered cabbage was delicious, I was happy with that.  I would not get the cucumber salad again...it wasn't bad, just not what I had thought. The blackberry cobbler was very cinnamony and lacked blackberries. The manager took the catfish bites off the check, but didn't come out to apologize or offer anything to make up for the hair or the wait.  All in all, I'd rather spend that kind of money somewhere else."}
{"text":"I read good things about Cajun Yard Dog so we decided to try it last night. Our server was great and the food was delicious. The tabasco strips were very tasty. We are glad Tega Cay is getting some better restaurants."}
{"text":"Omg. Soooooo good. A lot of fried /fatty food so if you eat healthy this is a good \"cheat day\" spot. I never had fried catfish and it was so good I am open to try it again. Their specialty yard dog sauce was sweet and spicy- definitely one of a kind. Collard greens didn't have much flavor but I was okay with that as everything else I got was so flavorful . My boyfriend got steak with bbq shrimp and the shrimp was good (I don't eat red meat) as well as the steak per his words. He was in love with the sweet potato fries and homemade honey mustard , I swear he inhaled them. I will say for the price it isn't a lot of portion. No left overs as everything seemed to come measured in 1 cup servings. Other than the price vs. quantity of food everything was great!!!!"}
{"text":"This place was packed on Saturday night, so I was really expecting to have my socks knocked off, especially considering the reviews on here. The place is small, so expect a wait if you go during peak times. The food was ok, but not spectacular.  Waitstaff was nice and friendly.  I had the fried flounder special over fried green tomatoes with a bleu cheese slaw.  The fish was ok, but under seasoned, and the fried batter just fell right off and was a bit soggy and not as crispy as I would expect.  The fried green tomatoes were the best thing on my plate, they were very good.  The slaw was alright, but not very strongly seasoned or flavorful.  We had some gumbo, which was ok, but again underseasoned, and had lots of rice and not much meat or veggies.  Someone else ordered the blackened trout, which was ok, but still, underseasoned.  Blackened should be very spicy, but it wasn't at all.  The mac and cheese was ok, but with that runny cheese sauce like out of a box, not stringy like there was actual melted cheese in it.  Collards were ok, nothing to brag about.  The best thing we had was the Jambalaya, which was still skimpy on meat and mostly just rice.  It was seasoned very well though and had a little bit of heat.  Overall it was an OK meal, but I've had a lot better.  When I end up dousing everything in hot sauce its clearly not a great meal."}
{"text":"It took us a long time to get down to this place, but I am so glad we did. The food was delicious, I can't wait to come back again.

We ventured down to south Charlotte, and found ourselves there right before the dinner rush (and yes, there was quite the rush/wait after we got in). We started with the calamari that had artichokes and okra. There was a lot more okra than I wanted, but the calamari was light, crispy and delicious. Then I ordered the shrimp etoufee for dinner with a side of beets. The etoufee was just the right amount of subtle spice, but extremely flavorful and I wanted to lick my plate clean. The beets were delicious, some of the best I've had out in Charlotte, and I wanted more of them! My husband had the fried chicken, and he was raving about the crispy skin but moist chicken inside. He nicely shared a bite with me and I couldn't agree more, it was delicious!

Cajun yard dog is definitely a place we will frequent again and again!"}
{"text":"The food was so good.  The catfish bites were amazing...melt in your mouth amazing!  The gumbo was delicious.  The fried shrimp and bbq shrimp entrees were excellent, but I definitely would order the fried shrimp next time.  And the best item was a side item...smothered cabbage, OMG!  I've never had cabbage like this before, smothered with Swiss cheese.  I also tried the Mac & Cheese which was great, but I would try another side next time. Lastly, you must try the banana bread pudding with vanilla ice cream to top your meal off!"}
{"text":"Smothered cabbage was delicious. Very friendly staff and comfort feel inside. The jalapeño deviled eggs and fried oysters or calamari or anything else are mandatory"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Best etouffee in Charlotte.  Great fried chicken.  Great sides.  Their smothered cabbage is like nothing you have tasted."}
{"text":"Been dying for fried chicken and tried this place on the suggestion of a friend. Ok, the way some of these people described this place made me think I was gonna walk into some kind of shithole. This place is adorable!! Small and cozy. Very Mardi gras themed, but not over the top. We went around 6:15 on Saturday and were seated right away. Waitress really nice, knowledgable, and attentive. We ordered the jalapeño deviled eggs and they came with a ton of jalapeños which weren't needs, since the eggs had a nice kick already, but needed more mayo. Obviously premade, but good. We saw other plates coming out and they looked big so we split the half fried chicken and two sides. The wait was a little long, but it's cooked fresh and it was understandable. The chicken was hot and fresh and crispy and good.! Not the best fried chicken I've ever had but very good. Spices were really nice and not over-the-top but delicious. Tasted very homemade. The potato salad was really good had some horseradish in it. I've never had fried okra but they're on the same type of flavor profile as a zucchini and they were pretty good too. Overall,  the chicken was good and I would definitely go back but I definitely want to try another chicken place that might beat this one. I think it might be Price's Chicken Coop as far as I hear."}
{"text":"Wow, what a let down. I've read so many of these great reviews, I had to try this place out. Met my daughter for dinner here tonight. The place is small but comfortable. It was busy although we didn't have to wait. I ordered the chicken & andouille sausage  jambalaya w/ mac & cheese and my daughter got the crab cake po boy w/ sweet potato fries. My daughter's meal looked great and she said it tasted good too. The sweet potato fries were alright. My meal was a different story. The jambalaya was bland and must have been put on the plate too early because it was luke warm when it arrived. The portions were small and overpriced (14 bucks for the jambalaya). The mac & cheese was the saving grace. It was damn good. I will go back again but will have to try some other dishes. The service was very friendly."}
{"text":"Food was amazing!! It was my first time there and I'm so glad that I tried it! I had the fried oysters and jambalaya. I topped it off with the chocolate pecan pie! I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped by this place with the fam, told me it was really good which it was. The service was great to us. I ordered the fried shrimp Po-Boy with sweet potato fries and mac and cheese. I enjoyed it. They had a nice bar in there as well, nice place to stop by!"}
{"text":"Cajun Yard Dog is a hidden gem, tucked away into a giant strip mall.  My sister insisted on taking me and my family here for lunch (dinner gets crowded and we don't like to wait).  They have a pretty nice beer list that includes Abita, naturally.  I had the shrimp and grits with a side of fried okra.  I make shrimp and grits at home and I'm a pretty good cook, but this was much better than the one I make!  The grits were very creamy and cheesy, and the shrimp were flavorful!  The fried okra was fantastic; the coating was light and not greasy at all.  My sister always gets the chicken and waffles if they have them on special and she said it was fantastic!  My dad had the fried oysters and red beans and rice and his plate was clean at the end of the meal.  
Service was fantastic, Jennifer did a great job of treating us like family and checking up on us as we enjoyed our meal.  If you love cajun/creole food or just want to try it, Cajun Yard Dog is your place!"}
{"text":"Good food not amazing Cajun food. If everything was 3-5 bucks cheaper they would have MUCH more business. Nearly every negative review is because of the price. I will pay 18$ for a large Bbq shrimp but I want to taste the garlic, lemon, Cajun spices and taste that it is homemade. I'm not saying that this place doesn't do their Cajun food homemade but it seems to me a lot of the stereotypical \"Cajun\" food taste a little to generic not like it was made from scratch. Just my opinion check it out and decide for yourself. I'll take my business to Cajun queen im Charlotte where you pay 18$ and lick your plate clean."}
{"text":"It's like be transported many miles to New Orleans, Louisiana. The etoufee and jambalaya were authentic and nicely spiced, the seafood combos were plentiful, and the beer selection was great. Don't let its location in a shopping center steer away"}
{"text":"Love this place. Service is always great.  Food is outstanding. Special are always a wonderful surprise. Some portions big enough to share so apps, dinner and desert are doable as shared."}
{"text":"Food was ok.  Very small place, but everyone was nice.  I got the fried shrimp which lacked any seasoning but was perfectly cooked. I also had blackened trout, again lacked seasoning big was perfectly cooked.  My husband had the fried chicken, perfectly cooked lacked seasoning.  All in all not impressed but I did get a descent meal."}
{"text":"Excellent. Came here for lunch a few weeks ago with family. I had the chicken and seafood jumbalaya. Awesome. For dessert we had the sweet potato pound cake--whew! That is like a slice of heaven for a pregnant woman. 

My drs.office  is right across the street and I am dissappointed they will not be open today after my appointment is over. Otherwise I would be eating cake for breakfast."}
{"text":"Absolutely deserving of 5 stars.  Not just because the food was amazing, but also because this place is a little tucked away.(alot of people we talked to in town don't even know this is a sit down restaurant! Criminal!).  That's mostly the fault of whoever decorated the outside.  In desperate need of a change to their facade to attract attention.

Notables:
-beer menu has a lot of unique options.  and 3.50 each one!
-great choice of sides.  our favs were the cheese grits and fried okra.
-all 3 entrees we had were amazing.  cooked really well and used really high quality ingredients.

People, just go, okay?  this place is way better than it looks."}
{"text":"We are happy to see a new restaurant in Fort Mill. We enjoy the Tabasco chicken and chicken cordon blue. The Mac and cheese is yummy, but don't care for their other sides. The owner is always so sweet."}
{"text":"This place has excellent food. Definitely a gem in charlotte. HOWEVER. They must figure out a better way of making people wait. There has always been a wait each time I've gone, so I'm sure the restaurant knows they are popular and people will wait for their food. At the moment they have a sign in list at the front, on a normal legal pad, with no one monitoring it. People write in their own names and a restaurant employee comes over every once in a while to call out a name. There is limited waiting area inside and some space outside. During the winter months it is cold and most are forced to wait outside to hear their name. THey need to introduce something where they can text you when your table is ready, or have a heated area outside for people to wait. There is a nice wine bar in the same complex where we went while we waited  but we're worried we'd miss our name. We came back only to wait at least 30 minutes longer in the freezing cold because there is no heating outside. I love this restaurant, I really do, but please update your waiting area situation to make it more appealing to diners."}
{"text":"I can't stop talking about their grits! 
The atmosphere/decor sets the mood for Cajun, our waitress was attentive, and the food looked and tasted great!
We started with the catfish bites (great breading!), he had the crab cake poboy and I had the shrimp and grits! Delicious!
For dessert, he had the red velvet pound cake and I got the bread pudding...we were both very satisfied with our selections!
The portions are great and the price was fair for the quality and quantity! 
We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Excellent service & the best fried catfish, shrimp & grits & Cajun food outside LA!! Will come back!"}
{"text":"All the food here is amazing but the fried chicken is the best I've had anywhere in the country! Love how the staff treats everyone as family like we all eat together there all the time."}
{"text":"The chicken Cordon Bleu is very good, we went for lunch and the only thing lacking was the lunch portion size of chicken... We just needed more chicken it was great the mashed potatoes were great as well!

We learned that we could order the dinner portion which we would do the next time because the chicken was great!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Stopped in for a quick lunch while house shopping from out of town. The staff were all super friendly and gave excellent suggestions. The blackened corvina fish was excellent, as were the macaroni and cheese and sweet potato fires (to die for!). Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I've been to Cajun Yard Dog a few times before however this is the first time I actually remembered to take a picture and leave a review haha. So this time around I got blackened meatloaf with tomato gravy and two sides, sweet potato fries and mac and cheese. The meatloaf was amazing and the tomato gravy made it 100 times better, the sweet potato fries are the bomb and the Mac and cheese was pretty good, the flavors are all there it was just a little salty for me. I don't remember what I had last time but I live near ballantyne so this place is a good drive, but it is definitely worth it. Mostly for the prices they have it's probably the best for cajun food. However if you're looking for a little upscale, it's a bit pricy compared to Cajun Yard Dog but, you should try Cajun Queen."}
{"text":"Menu was very intriguing...it was my first time there didn't know what to order and I settle for fried chicken, grits, and greens. my grits s and greens were cold, was not impress...on the other hand the fried chicken was to die for...Delicious! Will definitely g go back to try some of their other menu items."}
{"text":"I wandered into this place for a lunch meeting after discovering that the Katz New York deli is closed on Monday and we did not want the \"usual\" Quizno's/Subway/etc. I will say that unless you know what you're looking for, there's just no way to tell from the outside what the Cajun Yard Dog serves.

At 1:00 on a weekday, the place was surprisingly busy and we were only able to find two seats at the bar, where there was a large TV tuned into a sports channel. The bartender took our drink order (a sweet tea for me and my friend went with a Red Oak draft) while we reviewed the menu.

I settled on the hamburger Po Boy, which was probably a mistake. Not that it wasn't good, but it was a burger on a baguette with mayo lettuce and tomato. I should have tried something a bit more Cajun, which was my own dang fault. I did get the sweet potato fries as my side and they were absolutely perfect - sweet and salty and plenty of 'em!

My friend asked the bartender for a recommendation and went with that - the meatloaf. He said it was very good with the two sides - mixed vegetables and mac & cheese.

The service was good and I was very pleased with the price too. Good, good food. I could see into the kitchen from the bar and it looked very clean. The only downside is that the place is very small  only  a handful of 2- and 4-top tables plus 4 or 5 seats at the bar.

Would I come here again? Absolutely!"}
{"text":"It is not your average-Charlotte menu. Most of the food is fried and it is certainly flavorful, but I wouldn't say spicy or hot. 

It is a decent casual place to grab lunch and I would certainly go back."}
{"text":"Food was ok . Very disappointed with entrees . Just didn't taste that great . Deviled eggs were good . Services was also very good"}
{"text":"We went for my wife's birthday.  It is a small, nicely decorated Cajun restaurant in a nice strip mall.  We had to wait a while as it does not take reservations but that didn't matter. The food was spectacular, our waitress, Lynne, was awesome and gave us spot on recommendations for entrees. spices were dead on, the trout was the best I've ever tasted, and the fried oysters were great which is saying something because I don't even like oysters. The owner, Al, came over and introduced himself and immediately made us feel welcome.  Lynne and Al made the night for us and we can't wait to go back.  Make sure you go. It is outstanding food."}
{"text":"Tried the pineapple cider for the first time. It was delicious!! Try the catfish Mac and cheese with collards!"}
{"text":"This is a very small restaurant beside Michaels in the Arboetum Shopping Center.  We adore this restaurant.  Try the fried okra, fried oysters, shrimp pasta, collard greens.  Get a vegetable platter.  Go early as seating is limited.  You may want to google their hours of operation too.   We have been fans for a very long time!"}
{"text":"The food was good and the service was great.  The only thing that I didn't love was my fish had a lot of bones that were not removed.  It was very obvious that they were there and the cook was careless.

Also, I think we were seated close to the back area where employees can take their smoke breaks, it smelled very strongly of smoke.  It was only an issue for me because I'm sensitive to cigarette smoke."}
{"text":"The food was good and the service friendly. That means a lot, so I would come back. However, the atmosphere inside wasn't that great. They have a concrete floor that has been painted. They have plain wood chairs and older style tables. Feels like a 60's diner or that old family restaurant that you never liked as a kid. We ordered 2 margarita's and I didn't care for them. Seemed to have little Tequila and the flavor tasted more like orange juice than Margarita. Perhaps they make their own mix, because they had several specialty ones. Probably my mistake to not have ordered the speciality. For an appetizer we had Calamari Okrachokie. It was tasty. Some fried Calamari, Fried Okra, and Fried Artichokes. I mean, fry anything and it's good right? I had Shrimp Ettoufee and it was tasty, pretty spicy. My wife had blackened Salmon, she said was good. My daughter got Fried Chicken, which was very good. My other daughter got a swordfish and fried shrimp, again good. 
So, if you want some Cajun style food this isn't a bad place. However, don't go here for the atmosphere. It has a mix of old diner and sports bar feel to it."}
{"text":"I've been working in the area for 3 years and never heard of this place. Why not? Its awesome!! I went for lunch with my 3 coworkers. We all ordered different entrees. I also ordered the Calamari since I HAVE to order it anytime I see it on a menu. For the most part I enjoyed it, though I wish it had been fried a bit crispier. It had Fried Okra and Artichokes in it which was a nice touch. I ordered the Chicken Cordon Blue. It was sooooooooo good! Soooooooo much flavor. It excited me as soon as that first bite hit my tongue. I also tried a bite of all of my coworkers food and everything has so much flavor. I was very pleased and excited to come back and try other dishes at this restaurant now knowing that nothing we ordered was bad. We also ordered the Banana Bread Pudding....... just no words... other than delicious!! I had only a couple bites because it is so rich. We all shared on and had some left over, even with me only having a couple bites. I will definitely be making this place a lunch regular!"}
{"text":"I got the Catfish platter with Mac & Cheese and Potato Salad. It was some of the best catfish I've ever had, and I am pretty picky about catfish and Lowcountry food in general. The batter was awesome and so was the tartar sauce. The Mac & cheese was smooth, creamy, and cheesy. The potato salad has a kick to it. Our waitress was the sweet and knowledgeable Miss Emerald. Her expertise with the menu helped us pick the perfect meals. She knew how to engage in just the right amount of conversation to make us feel welcome and appreciated. Overall great experience. I'll be back, for sure."}
{"text":"So decadent! Had the shrimp and grits - to die for! Also had the chocolate pecan pie a la mode - no words, heavenly! Service - outstanding! Will be back again!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat in South Charlotte.  Great Cajun food.  My favorite is the fried oysters with cuke salad and their awesome mac 'n' cheese (their mac 'n' cheese is NOT out of a box).  Their sweet tea would make my Southern grandma proud. 

To avoid crowds, for lunch I recommend arriving before 11:30 a.m. or after 1 p.m. and for dinner try to get there before 6 p.m.   CYD is not open on Sundays."}
{"text":"This is just a great little find with great N'Orleans-style food. Had the blackened trout. Mr. Bill had crayfish. Shared an appetizer of fried green tomatoes. I normally don't care for collard greens, but they were delicious. You have to try the bread pudding, if you have room. Pleasant staff. Good food. What more can you ask for! Oh, yeah, great variety of libations. Thank you for a new Tega Cay eatery that's good!!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing and our waitress was friendly. There were a few regulars and they were more than happy to share their favorites. One lady even gifted my mother and I an order of bread pudding.... which replaced my mom's entire meal. The bread pudding came with ice cream and was drizzled in a sweet bourbon sauce. 

I ordered the Shrimp and Grits... the Grits were creamy and well seasoned. There were some other options that caught my eye, so I will be making my way back to this side of town."}
{"text":"First time here and not a fan. Had to order to go since my toddler was not feeling good.  First of all, $6 for a kids meal was a little high, especially when the only \"healthy\" option was simply buttered noodles.. . Anyway, it said it came with a drink, however I was never offered one. I had to ask and didn't find out there was a $1 upcharge for milk until my bill came! I would have happily got my daughter juice, but there was never a mention of an additional charge for milk!  I ordered the Cajun Cobb salad for myself but asked for no bleu cheese. When I got home I realized that while there was no bleu cheese, the dressing that I was provided with was bleu cheese dressing! Wouldn't it just make sense to offer a different dressing if the customer said no bleu cheese?! $18 for this... no thanks"}
{"text":"I came with a huge craving for shrimp and grits and after scouring reviews found this place! It wasn't too busy when I came in, in fact the couple waiting for their table got seated within a minute of me walking in. And then I waited. and waited. I seriously waited for about 10 minutes and wasn't even acknowledged. Where is the host/hostess? Who monitors the front???? The waitresses stayed busy not even looking in my direction so for me to flag someone down to even talk to would have been disruptive. Not one person stopped by to even tell me I could sit at the bar which I was willing to do or even to wait just a few til a table came ready...there were several seats open but I stayed right by the sign that said \"Please wait to be seated\".. Standing .. right there...being ignored. Well I lost all interest in shrimp and grits and whatever else this place has to sell... I don't care how good the food is, customer service has got to be a priority..."}
