{"text":"extremely nice staff. the chef offered me samples on my way in and way out. the meat selection here is fantastic, you can't go wrong. they will offer to marinate some meats for you if you ask. glad I found this place."}
{"text":"This carniceria is located on the NE corner of 32nd St and Thomas.  It is a small building right off the street.  Like a typical carniceria they sell meat, cheese, tortillas, salsas, some produce, and other typical market items.  They also sell food ready to eat.

It is clean but small.  They speak English and take credit cards.  

I have only purchased tortillas, salsa, and guac.

The guac was very good, fresh, and mild.  I bought the hottest salsa the butcher recommended.  It was a nice bright orange color.  It tasted like fresh habeneros blended with salt, onions, and garlic.  Very good and not too hot.  The tortillas were also fresh and good. 

While I didnt purchase any meat it looked pretty good and they were chopping fresh meat during my visit.  I would come back here to try more stuff out.  

If you like carne asada, salsas, tacos, pollo, etc you would like this place."}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out to pick up some Carne Asada, salsa, & tortillas for dinner. Staff was very helpful, carne Asada and marinade was good. Prices competitive. Good local spot."}
{"text":"I came here on recommendation of a friend who was grilling one day and the meat was quite tasty. 
I went here today on a whim and didn't realize they also have a nice selection of ready to eat food. I figured why not try some... I got some nopales, rice, soup, and the tripe. I'm not familiar with the correct names but you get the idea...
The owner was also there (didn't know it was the owner til later), he was very friendly, helpful and although I didn't see what I was looking for (ox tails) he sure enough had some on the back. 
The shop was very clean, which when you're a meat eater is a must. Great cuts, great selection.
Long story short, I got home and thoroughly enjoyed everything I picked up to eat (they cook it all fresh daily). I'm definitely going back. My ox tails, looking forward to cooking them."}
{"text":"Coming from L.A. where Carne asada is a must and there are meat markets in every corner, Phoenix tells otherwise but one great place for carne. Carniceria del pacific not only the best meat for asada and Pollo preparado and they grill it for you on the spot if you want to be lazy. The prices are a little bit more than usual but well worth it. Bistec a la plancha is the less expensive version of ranchera but does not substitute the ranchera flavor they carry."}
{"text":"Great hidden spot for all types of authentic Mexican food! My family was looking to buy food for a graduation party, and we ended up buying 30 pounds of marinated carne asada to grill. They had all types of salsas, fix-ins, and side dishes as well. Very fairly priced, especially because we were buying food to serve about 60 people. Definitely will be coming here again!"}
