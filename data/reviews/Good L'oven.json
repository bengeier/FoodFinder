{"text":"So great! Best cookies- crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside. A little pricey, but bought a dozen to share with my family from out of town...and let's just say they didn't last very long!! 
Love their new location, just wish that there was some seating available to enjoy their awesome food! 5 stars because I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Cute place!  I went in to buy some cookies and saw they had a full menu for lunch sandwiches and such.  They also have coffee and breakfast food as well.  I had the Italian sandwich and it was really nice with fresh spinach and tomato.  Give this place a try, I'll be back for more!"}
{"text":"Such a great small place. Food is fantastic and the cookies are amazing!! The store also has little odds and ends you can purchase as well! Not to mention the workers are so personable and nice!"}
{"text":"Everything here is delicious! I love the cookies and that other pastries. The coffee is always fresh, and the people are always friendly. Definitely take a look around the shop to see the little items for sale. This is definitely a place I like to come back to over and over again"}
{"text":"Stopped in because the sign on the front window said breakfast lunch and dinner. I wasn't looking for a cookie at the moment. I ordered the\"Bucky\" or \"Buck\"? Sandwich, a container of corn chowder soup (which surprisingly came with a loaf of bread included!) and hit the road.  WOW is all I can say. The sandwich was huge and absolutely worth every penny (not even expensive!). I couldn't stop taking another bite. Got the soup warmed up and my hubby went crazy on it! He especially loved the bread bonus we got.
I highly recommend this little shop and will be back for sure! Next time I will bring back some of their fresh baked and monster big cookies too!"}
{"text":"If you love cookies, (why would you be reading this if you didn't?) you know from the Bellevue location that these are very good cookies. This new location has lots more room for the trinkets and crafts, also adding lunch items. They also have sourced in bagels, chocolates, etc. from local businesses. Awesome!
As you choose your favorites, the brownie cookie, snickerdoodle, and oatmeal raisin for me, (please please double the raisins!) they also play with some interesting combos involving chips, cereal, and other cookie head scratchers. 
Try the cookie of the day! The Raspberry Chocolate Truffle changed my life!!! Okay, hyperbole notwithstanding, it did make an average day spectacular!!"}
{"text":"After a text message showing me the menu, pictures and some good word of mouth from my co-workers who have been nothing but impressed with the huge cookies from Good L'oven, I finally stopped by for some breakfast with a friend last week.  I walked in with high expectations and happily they were met.

I may have been a bit embarrassing with my enthusiasm when I first walked in.  I was so excited by everything I saw.  All the different cookies, the lunch and breakfast menu.  Beaver bagels! Italian meat pasta salad!  Zeke's coffee! Fancy sodas! Milk! Eggs! Soups! Pittsburgh Pickles! 

I'm not above ordering 6 cookies and a container of milk and just eating that.  However after I ordered my cookies (half a dozen huge cookies for $8), I remembered that I told my co-workers I'd be back later with treats and I knew I couldn't let them down. So the box of cookies waited patiently as I ordered a Breakfast Burrito.  My breakfast burrito contained egg, bacon, cheese, spinach and tomato and came with sour cream and salsa on the side. An added surprise was the extra little cup of yogurt with some fresh fruit (strawberries and blueberries) that really hit the spot.  The burrito ingredients were all fresh and refreshing.

As I bounced around, I saw a sign listing daily specials (we were there on Friday which is free cookie with lunch purchase day).  They also have several different flavored syrups and creams at the coffee bar. And I can't say enough about how friendly the staff is.  The cookie flavors rotate so every day there is always something different.  We were told the food menu changes frequently as well.  

My only complaint was some of the non-food items available for sale. It seemed like a bit much that they were selling clothing and jewelry while there were only two tables where we could stay and eat (with no chairs).  There is a fair amount of space that I think could be better used to accommodate patrons who don't want their food to go.  This is my main reason for deducting one star.  But that burrito and those cookies were too good to keep me away for long. Especially since I've heard they make an amazing strawberry pretzel salad cookie."}
{"text":"For the past two years I have been enjoying these delicious cookies. I work downtown and when the farmers market rolls around in May the first stop I make is to Good L'oven. I've never been that big of a sweets person, but I could never live without cookies. I value cookies over cake any day. There are some very important rules when it comes to indulging into the perfect cookie. It can't be rock solid, it can't crumble to pieces when you break it and the shelf life needs to be there. I don't want to buy a half dozen and then they are stale the next day. I have never had this problem with Good L'oven cookies. They are always soft, fresh and filled with some of the best flavors. Did I mention they are huge? At the farmers market they are $1.75 for 1 or $3 for  2. 

It was my first time visiting the store this past weekend. They have so many different things to offer here. It's not just a cookie shop. It's also a gift shop. A place to stop if you want to pick up some soup or a quick sandwich. They also make a variety of other cookies as well that might serve you well for parties. I ordered a half dozen cookies for $8. My favorites were elf toots and s'mores. Both had marshmallows inside. The s'mores had Golden Grahams cereal and chocolate chips. Both were warm and gooey. Highly recommend! I love the catchy names they come up with for their cookies. A lot of thought goes into each cookie name and ingredient mix."}
{"text":"One of my newest favorites!  Cookies are amazing!  Lunch options are great and soup is excellent!  A wonderful little shop that has gifts too!  Right on my drive to work-so its perfect!"}
{"text":"Baking is one of my hobbies, and I'm a fat kid at heart with a huge sweet tooth, so I have pretty high standards when it comes to baked goods. This adorable little bakery sells more than just cookies....they also have some light lunch items like soups and sandwiches. But on the day of my visit, I was on a mission to try only the sugary goodness.

They offer several different varieties of cookies...probably at least 10 or 12. The flavors vary from your basic cookie (e.g., chocolate chip) to interesting and creative concoctions (e.g., meat and potatoes, which is a cookie with bacon and potato chips!) The cookies are quite large and prices are reasonable. The more cookies you buy, the less each cookie costs (I think I got 6 for $8, which is about $1.33/cookie). 

I opted for a variety of cookies...M&M, Almond Joy, Meat & Potatoes, Peanut Butter, Sugar Sprinkle, and Steel City (brownie/cookie swirl). The first thing that struck me about these cookies is that they seem to be made with high quality ingredients. I can taste real butter, real vanilla, etc. and that's key in creating tasty baked goods. Another thing I noticed is that they are generous with the cookie add-ins...you don't have to go hunting to find an M&M in their M&M cookie. So another thumbs up there. The one thing holding me back from giving these cookies five stars is texture. The texture was hit or miss depending on the cookie. Now of course this is one of those things that is subjective...some people love a crunchy cookie, others love a soft cookie. But in my opinion, a cookie should ideally have a verrrrrry slight crunch on the outside....just enough to make your teeth have to lightly pierce that initial layer...then it should give way to a tender and chewy bite. A few of the cookies I sampled at Good L'oven achieved this elusive textural balance and were pretty much perfect. But other cookies were overbaked and dry (which is so disappointing...I think overbaking is the biggest cookie crime one can commit).

Overall, I like that they offer a variety of cookies and the flavors of everything I tried were on point...if they can become more consistent with their cookie texture, they will achieve cookie perfection across the board. But as it stands now, they're pretty darn close....I will definitely be making a repeat visit!"}
{"text":"How have I not yet written a review for my favorite cookie and soup place?! Probably cause I want to keep it a secret from all of you. But I'm sharing now. 
Their turtle sea salt caramel cookies are AMAZING. Hands down one of the best cookies I've ever eaten and they are always perfectly cooked. Man alive. I also love the creme brûlée cookie. Be advised that their selection for everything changes daily so you should visit more than once. 
The soups are made from scratch every day. I've enjoyed every single one I've tried, my favorite was the Pittsburgh pickle soup. Holy cow it was good, creamy with a hint of pickle bring and slices of pickles, carrots, onions. My favorite.
Their sandwiches are also delicious and everything is cooked to order so you know your food hasn't been sitting under a heat lamp.
They also sell containers of soup to go, farm fresh eggs, pickles, and some frozen foods. 
The gift shop is cute and has tons of nice gifts for friend, family, or even kids (the hand painted children's chairs are adorable). 
Service is always very friendly and quick. My favorite to-go lunch spot in the area!"}
{"text":"Good L'Oven is my favorite bakery of all time! First, the cookies are delicious. The variety of flavors are wonderful, the crispness/softness ratio of the cookies are perfect, and the taste of the cookies are delicious. I often bring the cookies to various parties for work and family events and they can't stop raving about them. Second, the staff is very helpful and very friendly. They always go out of their way to extend their kindness and gratitude for shopping in their store. There is a lot of pride and positivity in Good L'Oven and it shows."}
{"text":"I am thoroughly disappointed with our cookies today. Staff was friendly and helpful as usual but after getting home and trying them, they were harder than last time, like they forgot something in the batter and they all tasted the same to me today and they shouldn't. They all tasted like chocolate chip except for the brownie that tasted the best and was softest. I hope this was just a bad day. I will try again, I hope it gets better. :("}
{"text":"Good L'oven now has a sister bakery which is located near Reis Run Road in the North Hills. This location has a lot more to offer than the one in Bellevue. In addition to their famous cookies you can order breakfast, lunch sandwiches, soup, or even frozen goods to prepare at home. 

It is more spread out than the other location but they have the same large cookies for the same prices. The more you buy the more you save. Nice thing about their cookies is that if you can't eat them then you can wrap them and freeze them individually. They can last up to two months that way.

In addition they have various children's clothes, tea towels, hand painted glasses, honey, and all types of knick knacks for sale. You can even get candy, chocolates, just about anything. It's a great place to browse around. Some are even sports themed. Yes, they sell my Zeke's coffee which is already preground or in small packets for small coffeemakers. You can even purchase their regular blend to drink or anything you'd like from the refrigerator. They do have a small eating area near the window. My girlfriend treated me to a delicious home made scone which I was told they make fresh daily. Covered with tasty almonds it wasn't overly sweet and I was able to save some of it to take home later as a snack.

I saw that on Sats they have various local vendors come in and discuss their products. Tomorrow they will have a local farm come in and talk about chicken, eggs, and pork. Although I can't be there tomorrow I will make it a point to return to check out one of these vendors. I love to shop local and no better way than to find a spot that offers it.

I purchased 3 cookies which I have frozen for future use. I'm pleased with the second location since it is easy access off the highway and ample parking is available. Looking forward to checking out one of those vendors in the near future."}
